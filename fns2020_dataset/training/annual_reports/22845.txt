Currency market
Though growth prospects in the currency 
market remain broadly unchanged, there 
is a shift to more formal, technology-led 
procurement. Many customers buy the 
complete banknote from one supplier, 
but others are moving to a multi-supplier 
model by disaggregating note buying into 
its individual elements: substrate, security 
features and printing. Tenders are also 
becoming more common.
Over one third of the world’s population 
has no access to any form of finance 
except cash
2
. For many people banknotes 
are the only available option that enables 
them to trade freely and securely. We 
estimate that there are c162bn banknotes 
issued worldwide each year and expect 
that demand for banknotes will continue 
to grow at approximately 3-4% a year
1
. 
Central banks issue new banknotes to 
replace poor quality notes in circulation 
and to fill demand driven by GDP and 
population growth. While note replacement 
remains the most important factor, other 
drivers for issuing new notes include 
changes in note design, changes in 
monetary policy and the introduction of 
new anti-counterfeiting security features.
The demand for banknotes and the 
substrates they are printed on is largely 
satisfied by state print works (SPW) 
and state paper mills (SPM), with a 
proportion of it being met by a number 
of commercial manufacturers, including 
De La Rue. De La Rue leads by volume 
in the commercial banknote print market 
and is amongst the top three players in 
the commercial banknote paper market.

SPWs and SPMs regularly turn to 
commercial providers for help in fulfilling 
demand, known as ‘overspill’. Overspill 
orders typically account for 1% to 3% 
of the market and can have a noticeable 
effect on the commercial print and paper 
markets. Conversely, the unpredictability 
of overspill creates market volatility.
Of the banknotes in circulation, 97% are 
printed on cotton-based paper. As central 
banks seek to reduce the ‘cost of cash’, 
next generation substrates such as 
polymer are increasing in popularity due 
to durability. Polymer currently accounts 
for 3% of the substrate market and we 
expect it to grow at approximately 10% 
per annum over the next ten years
4
. 
As the second supplier to the market and 
the only integrated producer with polymer 
manufacturing and printing capabilities, 
De La Rue is well placed to capture this 
growth opportunity.
While pricing pressure in print and paper 
persists, value in a printed banknote is 
moving towards security features such 
as threads and holograms, making security 
features an attractive market. Most 
countries purchase security features from 
the commercial market, which provides the 
opportunity for De La Rue to sell directly 
into the SPW market. Several players 
dominate the security features industry, 
including De La Rue.
Our markets 
continued
Identity solutions market 
Demand for identity and security products 
and services continues to rise, although 
market drivers and customer behaviours 
are changing. The physical product is still 
highly important but there is an increasing 
emphasis on technology, as customers 
seek end-to-end digital solutions.
Comprising passport identity cards and 
identity software solutions, the global 
identity market, over half of which is 
available to commercial manufacturers, 
is valued at around £5bn
4
.
With expected growth of c9% per 
annum
4
, the passport market remains 
attractive. Customers are increasingly 
valuing security features and the systems 
and services that surround the physical 
product. While we believe demand for 
physical passports will remain for the 
long term, the market is transitioning from 
Machine Readable Passports (MRP) to 
chip-based ePassports (ePPT). This drives 
demand for full integration of highly secure 
passports with other government systems 
and processes, as well as for project 
management expertise.
The national ID market is expected to grow 
at c4% per annum
1
 and is also digitising. 
Today, c65% of national ID in circulation 
worldwide is chip-based. Technological 
advances in recent years have enabled 
new types of ID schemes, combining 
traditional ID functionality with payment 
and cross border identification.

.
Product authentication & traceability 
market (previously Security Products)
Governments continue to work hard to 
protect indirect tax revenues on products 
such as alcohol and tobacco by minimising 
illicit trade. A major catalyst for change 
has been the need to respond to the 
World Health Organization Framework 
Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), 
which is committed to eliminating illicit 
trade in tobacco products. This will require 
governments to apply unique and secure 
codes onto cigarette packs and to be able 
to track and trace the products through 
the supply chain. This is expected to drive 
wider adoption of authentication and 
tracking solutions.
For global commercial organisations, 
revenue loss from counterfeit goods 
remains a real threat to brands and 
consumer confidence. Highly secure labels, 
connected to technology-led authentication 
and tracking solutions, ensure brands are 
protected and that consumers can be 
confident of buying genuine products.
 
Cash processing market
Cash processing is an aspect of the 
currency lifecycle, to authenticate the 
cash in circulation and ensure its integrity.
With the increasing volumes of cash 
in circulation, central and commercial 
banks demand efficient and secure cash 
processing solutions. Due to long product 
lifecycles and a stable customer base, 
demand for cash sorting machines and 
the associated support and maintenance 
services has remained steady. In addition, 
there is a requirement within banknote 
print works for end of line inspection and 
processing of newly printed banknotes. 
Cash processing is a mature, consolidated 
market, dominated by three suppliers.
As central banks and commercial banks 
increasingly focus on reducing cost of 
ownership, there is increasing demand 
for more sophisticated software systems 
to help better manage the cash cycle.

Strategic report Directors’ report Accounts
Some of our markets have become 
more competitive, while others present 
excellent growth opportunities. Against 
this backdrop, we set out a clear strategic 
plan in May 2015 to revitalise and grow 
the business over the five years to 2020.
The 2020 Strategic Plan looks at the 
business in two parts: the business lines 
where we will Invest and Build and those 
where we will Optimise and Flex.
Invest and Build
Invest in the business lines that are 
exposed to higher growth markets: 
Polymer, Security Features, Identity 
Solutions, Product Authentication & 
Traceability (PA&T).
Optimise and Flex
Optimise the business lines that are 
facing increased competition and pricing 
pressure: Banknotes and Banknote Paper. 
Invest and Build strategic 
priorities:
Diversifying our revenues 
Currency accounts for two thirds of the 
Group’s revenue and more than 70% of 
our operating profit. However, the currency 
market is historically lumpy and changing 
market drivers and customer behaviours 
have exacerbated volatility. To reduce our 
reliance on currency products and curtail 
volatility, we aim to diversify by expanding 
into new markets, broadening our 
customer base and growing our recurring 
digital and service revenues.
Expanding into new markets
We entered the polymer substrate market 
with the launch of Safeguard
®
 in 2012. 
Building a polymer substrate capability 
has diversified our product portfolio 
and increased our addressable market. 
We aim to grow our market share by 
targeting existing polymer customers 
and paper customers looking to switch 
to polymer, as well as converting low value 
coin denominations. As we are the only 
integrated polymer provider (manufacturing, 
design and printing) and substrate 
agnostic, we believe we are well positioned 
to capture this growth opportunity.
 
The identity market is expected to grow 
as governments focus on population 
authentication and border security. 
De La Rue is the world’s largest 
commercial passport manufacturer, 
supplying international ID to more than 
40 countries. By leveraging our strong 
position in passports, building in-house 
capability and partnering with industry 
specialists and technology firms, we 
aim to expand into the adjacent national 
ID market.
Broadening our customer base
Excluding the UK, the top 10% of contracts 
in Currency account for c40% of our 
revenue. To reduce revenue concentration, 
we seek to grow our customer base by 
expanding our product range and targeting 
larger market segments, such as state 
print works (SPWs). Unlike central and 
commercial banks, SPWs regularly source 
individual banknote components from the 
commercial market, either because state 
paper mills cannot meet their demand, in 
the case of substrate, or it is uneconomical 
to develop their own, as in the case of 
security features. Selling directly to SPWs 
gives us an alternative route to grow our 
substrates and security features.
 
Revenue demonstrates our ability to deliver 
growth. This year, market conditions remained 
challenging but Group revenue grew by 7%.

Growing our digital and service revenues
Unlike many physical products, software 
and service contracts are typically 
multi-year and generate recurring revenues. 
We plan to grow our digital revenue 
through continuing product development 
and equipping our sales force with new 
skills. An increased proportion of stable 
income from medium to long term 
contracts will smooth out our revenue 
volatility over the longer term. Diversifying 
toward software-based solutions will 
also help transition De La Rue from a 
manufacturing-led banknote and passport 
printer to a technology-led integrated 
security product and service provider.
Increasing differentiation through 
innovation and design
Innovation and design are part of our 
heritage. De La Rue has amassed over 
1,000 patents in its 200 year history and 
has more than 500 applications pending. 
As proven by our past success, innovation 
is vital for our future.
Enhancing our product innovation
We plan to double our investment in 
research and development (R&D) in 
the years to 2020, prioritising product 
development in high growth and high 
margin businesses such as security 
features, polymer and digital solutions.
Continuous innovation gives us greater 
product differentiation in a competitive 
market. We will focus on developing next 
generation security features and better 
managing the lifecycle of each feature 
in our portfolio, to ensure continuity of the 
new product pipeline. In addition, we are 
looking to convert current paper features 
for use with polymer substrate.
We will also further enhance our digital 
offering, by accelerating our software 
development through technology 
partnerships and potentially through 
acquisitions, which will give us a 
competitive edge in the identity and 
product track and trace markets.
Strengthening our design capability
Our design capability is an essential 
component of our product development 
and integrated business model. We design 
products according to our customers’ 
individual needs. Design plays an important 
part in each stage of our integrated 
process, from early customer engagement, 
to product development, to manufacturing 
and delivery. We believe that our design 
capability is unique amongst our 
competitors. We will continue to strengthen 
the skills and capabilities in our design 
team through training and development, 
as well as bringing in new talent.

strategic priorities:
Driving efficiency
We are looking to create a leaner and more 
agile organisation. We have completed a 
thorough assessment of our current work 
practices, resources and capabilities, and 
identified opportunities for improvement. 
This may involve reducing or outsourcing 
some support functions to generate further 
savings without jeopardising business 
operations and productivity. This exercise 
is ongoing and we will continue to review 
and revise our methods, in order to operate 
more efficiently.
Implementing Operational Excellence
Industry overcapacity, compounded with 
value shifting towards security features,  
has caused pricing pressure in banknote 
paper and to some extent in banknotes.  
It is crucial for us to keep these businesses 
as competitive as possible. In 2012,  
we launched an Operational Excellence 
programme to modernise our banknote 
production and seek continuous 
improvement by introducing world class 
manufacturing methods. Driving down 
production costs enables us to remain 
competitive on pricing, while protecting our 
margin (see page 22 for more details about 
our Operational Excellence programme).
Restructuring manufacturing footprint
The banknote market is oversupplied. 
De La Rue can produce up to eight billion 
banknotes a year, equivalent to 38% of

the commercial market. We will restructure 
our print manufacturing footprint in the 
next two years to reduce our capacity 
and cost base by reducing the number 
of print lines and consolidating banknote 
print productions to four locations: Kenya, 
Sri Lanka, Debden and Gateshead. 
To drive further efficiency in the Banknote 
operation and ease increased pressure 
from the reduction in production lines,  
we will upgrade the remaining print lines 
and create a common manufacturing 
footprint to make them more productive 
and give us more flexibility. The plan is 
expected to take two years to complete 
at an incremental capital expenditure of 
£15m and a one off cost of £8m. It will 
deliver around £13m of savings per annum 
from the third year onward. (see page 20 
for more details about the footprint review).
Exploring options for CPS 
We manufactured our cash processing 
machines in the US and provided aftersales 
service and maintenance through 15 
centres worldwide. The cash processing 
market conditions have become more 
challenging recently, particularly in sorting 
machines. Following a ‘root and branch’ 
review in the second half of the year, 
we decided to exit the business through 
disposal. The sale of the CPS business 
was completed on 22 May 2016.
Using assets effectively
Establishing partnerships
Establishing reliable long term partnerships 
will enable us to increase our flexibility, 
maintain our competitiveness and 
reduce our capital requirements and 
operating costs.
In Banknotes, we need access to surge 
capacity so we can handle sporadic 
overspill orders from SPWs. We will create 
outsourcing partnerships with commercial 
printers and other SPWs, which often have 
excess capacity but lack routes to market. 
This will allow us to flex our capacity from 
six billion notes per annum following the 
footprint restructuring to seven billion and 
above when required, as well as providing 
us with local expertise and logistics. 
We are also building stronger partnerships 
with our key suppliers to ensure continuity, 
greater flexibility of material supply, 
and to reduce costs by sharing best 
practice. The flexibility provided by reliable 
partnerships, coupled with cost efficiencies 
from the footprint restructuring, will help 
to fortify our number one position in the 
commercial banknote market. Banknote 
paper is an important part of our integrated 
offering and provides a gateway to markets 
for other products, such as embedded 
security threads. In addition to improving 
efficiency in our paper production, 
we are pursuing strategic partnerships 
to rationalise industry overcapacity and 
reduce ongoing capital requirements.
Maximising internal synergies
To better capture internal synergies, we 
have moved the business to a functional 
structure, focusing on three new functions: 
Innovation & Technology, Customer 
& Commercial and Delivery. The new 
structure encourages greater collaboration 
between functions and improved 
utilisation of our resources and capabilities 
throughout our product offering.
This involves identifying opportunities 
to fully utilise existing products, such as 
applying banknote security features to 
identity documents and adapting paper 
features to be suitable for polymer, as 
well as ensuring multi-purpose product 
development. While many customers 
have rewarded us with loyalty and 
trust over decades, we always look to 
strengthen our longstanding relationships. 
Assigning dedicated resource and 
employing local knowledge will help 
improve our understanding of customers’ 
needs, thus ensuring we offer the right 
products and services to our customers 
and take advantage of cross selling 
and up selling opportunities.
Driving a high 
performing culture
We recognise the importance of having 
a culture that aligns with our strategy and 
corporate goal. We are in the process of 
forging a dynamic, results focused, high 
performing culture that will drive business 
growth in the years to 2020 and beyond, 
through a combination of:
• Focusing on performance
• Bringing in new talent and expertise
• Developing leadership capability
• Open and effective communication

Risk and risk management 
How we manage risk 
Effective risk management requires 
collective responsibility and engagement 
across the entire business. The Board has 
overall responsibility for risk management 
and is supported by the Risk Committee 
which comprises members of De La Rue’s 
Executive Leadership Team. The Risk 
Committee is accountable for identifying, 
mitigating and managing risk. Further 
details of this Committee can be found 
on page 48. We have a formal risk 
identification process, to evaluate and 
manage the significant risks we face in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
Group risk register identifies the risks, 
their potential impact and likelihood 
of occurrence, and the key controls 
and management processes we have 
established to mitigate these risks. Each of 
the Group’s functional areas also maintains 
a risk register. The Risk Committee meets 
twice each year to review our management 
of risk arising from our activities and to 
monitor the status of key risks and the 
actions we have taken to address them 
at Group and functional level. Regular risk 
reporting occurs at the monthly Executive 
Leadership Team meetings to highlight any 
material changes. The Audit Committee 
also reviews the Group’s risk report and 
De La Rue’s risk management framework

receives regular reports from the Executive 
Leadership Team on the material risks at a 
functional level. Management is responsible 
for implementing and maintaining controls. 
Controls by their nature are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk and can 
only provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. See page 51 for further information 
regarding internal controls.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The following pages set out the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group, 
which could crystallise over the next 
three years. The Board has undertaken 
a robust risk assessment to identify the 
Group’s principal risks. The risks are not 
listed in order of materiality. There may 
be other risks that we currently believe 
to be immaterial, which could become 
material to the Group. These risks, 
whether they materialise individually or 
simultaneously, could significantly affect 
our business and financial results. We have 
modelled potential scenarios of these risks 
crystallising to support the disclosures in 
the Viability Statement. See page 17 for 
further details. Due to the very nature of 
risk, the mitigating factors stated cannot be 
viewed as assurance that the actions taken 
or planned will be wholly effective. 
Principal risks and 
uncertainties related 
to our business and 
our strategy, and how 
we manage them. 15 De La Rue Annual Report 2016

Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk Exposure Impact Mitigation Outlook
Strategic risks
Failure to maintain 
competitive and 
technologically 
advanced products 
and services
We operate in competitive 
markets. Our products and 
services are characterised 
by continually evolving 
industry standards and 
changing technology, 
driven by the demands of 
our customers. Longer term 
threats include the growth 
of e-commerce, cashless 
societies and increasing 
ease of manufacture.
Failure to maintain 
technical innovation and 
intellectual property may 
result in lower demand, 
loss of market share 
and lower margins.
We maintain sustained levels of investment in research and 
development to ensure a pipeline of ideas generation. Our product 
roadmaps are designed to deliver our customers’ needs. We 
centralise our materials science expertise and our software science 
team in the UK. These teams deliver through defined technology 
management processes, which include regular pipeline and 
portfolio reviews.
We continue to invest in new technologies to enable us to advance 
our R&D capabilities. We have increased our focus on digital 
technologies since the strategy review in 2015.
We look to double our R&D investment in the five years to 2020.
Cultural change In order to ensure our 
continued success and growth, 
an internal organisational 
redesign took place in 
2015/16. The focus in 2016/17 
and beyond is on achieving 
sustained cultural change 
in our organisation to be able 
to adapt to a rapidly changing 
market environment.
Without the culture 
change we seek to 
achieve, we may not 
be able to execute 
the strategy laid out 
in May 2015.
In 2015/16 we completed the formation of the new Executive 
Leadership Team. Extensive training on strategic leadership skills 
was rolled out to the Senior Leadership Team. 
We have set specific targets for performance appraisal and 
employee engagement.
The strategic plan envisaged a three year programme of training, 
communication and recruitment to fill capability gaps. The outcome 
is expected to be a change in behaviours and skills that will allow 
De La Rue to be a more dynamic, agile and high performing 
organisation. The plan is on track.
Financial risks
The timing and 
size of substantial 
contract awards 
can be uneven 
and unpredictable
Political and other factors can 
delay government procurement 
decisions for sensitive products 
like banknotes and passports.
The timing and size of 
contract awards is often 
uncertain and delays in 
awards result in volatility 
in the order book and our 
financial performance.
We maintain close and regular contact with customers so that 
any changes in timing and requirements are recognised promptly.
We monitor sales activity, order pipeline and forward order book in 
order to ensure that our production planning is optimised to deliver 
on time and in full to our customers.
We also monitor any delays in order confirmation on a weekly 
basis to ensure that the supply chain remains flexible and is able 
to accommodate required production planning changes.
For the long term, we proactively pursue longer term commitment 
from customers, as well as aim to grow recurring revenues by 
expanding our digital and service offerings.
Failure to win 
or renew a 
material contract
While we operate globally and 
have a diversified geographic, 
product and customer profile, 
we rely heavily on a small 
number of medium and longer 
term material contracts.
Failure to win or 
renew a key contract 
could restrict growth 
opportunities and have 
a material impact on our 
financial performance 
and reputation.
Our track record of delivering product innovation and our 
commitment to quality, combined with a commercial approach 
to tendering, places us in a good position to win or renew strategic 
or significant contract opportunities. 
The business is focused on retaining its key contracts, as and 
when they fall due for renewal, and on winning new opportunities 
as they arise.
Political risk A number of the countries 
that we sell to have a history 
of unstable government or 
conflict. There is an ongoing 
risk that orders may be 
unexpectedly cancelled or 
cannot be fulfilled; outstanding 
debts do not get paid; 
or performance guarantees 
do not get cancelled because 
of local political issues leading 
to financial loss.
Losses from cancelled 
orders and non 
payment of debt could 
lead to a reduction in 
operating profit. Where 
performance guarantees 
remain outstanding, 
credit facilities will be tied 
up, restricting our ability 
to utilise those credit 
facilities to support new 
contracts or investment.
We assess overall risk of contract pre-tender, including credit risk. 
There are defined approval limits for management and the Board 
to approve material contracts based on risk as well as contract size. 
We negotiate payment terms with substantial down payments 
requested in higher risk situations. 
All performance guarantees are approved by the Treasury 
department prior to contract signature.
Risk appetite
At each of its meetings the Board reviews 
a number of the principal risks so that over 
the course of the year all principal risks 
and uncertainties are covered. The Board 
considers a report from management with 
their assessment as to whether the principal 
risks are within a proposed acceptable level 
of risk appetite, and where they are not, 
what further investment is being made to 
reduce the likelihood and potential impact 
of the risk. The Board either approves 
the level of risk being taken, or requires 
management to reduce the risk exposure. 
For core areas of the business, the Board 
exercises control that management 
operate within an accepted risk appetite 
through a number of means. These include 
delegated authority levels, the approval 
of specific policies and procedures and 
the approval of the annual insurance 
programme. The Board receives regular 
feedback as to whether management are 
operating within acceptable risk tolerances 
through regular operational and financial 
management reports, internal audit reports, 
external audit reporting and any reports to 
the whistleblowing hotline. All members 
of the Executive Leadership Team have 
individual ownership for one or more of the 
principal risks. Management of those risks 
forms part of their personal objectives. 16 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Risk and risk management

Risk Exposure Impact Mitigation Outlook
Operational risks
Quality 
management  
failure
Each of our contracts has 
a unique specification on 
product quality and delivery. 
Some of these contracts 
demand a high degree of 
technical specification.
A shortfall in quality 
management may 
expose us to additional 
cost to remake and 
to warranty costs in 
the event of the need 
to remake.
We have an established quality management system operating 
across all of our production sites. Our major sites are all certified 
to ISO9001 quality management standards.
In 2012, an Operational Excellence programme was introduced 
to further drive continuous improvement across our manufacturing 
sites. This programme is well established and continues to drive 
enhancements to the operation.
Supplier failure We have close trading 
relationships with a number 
of key suppliers. Some 
are unique producers of 
specialised components 
that we incorporate into 
our finished products.
Failure of a key supplier, 
the inability to source 
critical materials or poor 
supplier performance 
in terms of quality or 
delivery could disrupt 
our supply and ability to 
deliver on time and in full.
Our exposure is reduced by the fact that we source many of our 
components from within the De La Rue supply chain.
Where external supply is required, we have established procedures 
for identifying possible risks for each supplier. Key suppliers are 
managed through a supplier relationship management programme 
that includes checks on their financial strength, ability to deliver 
to our quality standards and security and business continuity 
arrangements. Key suppliers are audited on a rotational basis.
As a contingency, alternative suppliers are pre-qualified wherever 
possible and where necessary we retain higher levels of stocks.
Product security Loss of product or high 
security components from a 
manufacturing site could occur 
as a result of negligence or 
theft. Loss of product while 
in transit, particularly during 
transhipment, through the 
failure of freight companies or 
through the loss of an aircraft 
or vessel as a result of an 
accident or natural disaster, 
is also possible.
There is the potential 
for reputational and 
financial damage in 
the event of the loss of 
product or high security 
components. Under 
contracts with our 
customers, we may be 
liable for those losses.
We have robust physical security and materials control procedures 
at our production sites, which reduce the risk of an inadvertent 
loss or theft during manufacturing. We apply stringent operational 
procedures and use carefully selected carriers and personnel to 
handle movements of security materials between our sites and 
onward delivery to customers. All movements are risk managed 
and monitored globally on a 24/7 basis. The Group maintains 
a comprehensive global insurance programme.
Health, safety 
or environmental 
failure
All of our activities are subject 
to extensive internal health, 
safety and environmental 
(HSE) procedures, processes 
and controls. Nevertheless, 
there is a risk that failure 
of process could result 
in a serious incident.
Failure of an HSE 
management process 
could lead to a 
serious injury or an 
environmental breach.
We operate a robust HSE management system which is internally 
audited and certified to the OHSAS18001 and ISO14001 standards 
in all major facilities.
All of our activities are subject to extensive internal HSE procedures, 
processes and controls.
The Group HSE Committee regularly reviews HSE performance 
which is also monitored by the Chief Operating Officer’s leadership 
team and reported to the Board monthly.
Each manufacturing facility has clear HSE action plans which 
are prioritised, monitored and subject to review by local senior 
management to ensure that health and safety standards 
are maintained.
Loss of a key site There are a number of 
manufacturing sites across  
the business which are 
exposed to business 
interruption risks.
The total loss of any one 
of these key sites could 
have a major financial 
impact, particularly where 
the site forms a single 
source of supply for 
the business.
We are accredited to ISO22301:2012 Business Continuity standard 
for our Head Office and the banknote production operations in 
Debden, UK. 
The business has a high degree of interoperability between sites 
for banknote production and security printing. We aim to minimise 
risk by adopting the highest standards of risk engineering in our 
production processes.
In recognition of increasing customer requirements regarding 
business continuity standards, we continue to enhance our 
business continuity resilience in line with the ISO standard 
across all of our major facilities.

Legal / regulatory risks
Breach of legal 
and regulatory 
requirements
It is possible that employees 
or overseas representatives 
of De La Rue, acting either 
individually or in collusion 
with others, could act in 
contravention of the Group’s 
stringent requirements 
in relation to bribery and 
corruption, anti-competitive 
behaviours and management 
of third party partners (TPPs).
Major reputational 
and financial damage 
to the business.
We are accredited to the Banknote Ethics Initiative. This 
accreditation provides governments and central banks with 
assurance in respect of maintenance of high ethical standards 
and business practices.
The ethical tone of the business is articulated in the Code 
of Business Principles which is supported by underlying 
policies. These are regularly reviewed and enforced robustly. 
Non-compliances are dealt with through disciplinary procedures 
where necessary.
Particular focus is given to ongoing awareness raising and training 
on anti-bribery and corruption and competition law. Our policies 
and processes are independently audited.
We have a process for the appointment, management and 
remuneration of TPPs which operates independently of the sales 
function. The behaviours of TPPs are strictly monitored and the 
TPP process is overseen by the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary who reports directly to the Board on these matters.
The Group’s whistleblowing policy and procedure forms an integral 
part of the compliance framework.
Information risks
Information  
security risk
The confidentiality and 
integrity of our customer, 
employee and business data 
could be affected by factors 
that include human error, 
ineffective design or operation 
of key data security controls 
or through breakdown of 
IT control processes.
Any compromising 
of the confidentiality 
of information could 
impact our reputation 
with current and 
potential customers.
We maintain accreditation to the ISO27001 Information Security 
standard in respect of our corporate information systems.
A strict control environment exists to enforce disciplined 
information security practices and behaviours. There are a number 
of key technical controls in place to manage this risk including 
network segregation, access restrictions, system monitoring, 
security reviews and vulnerability assessments of infrastructure 
and applications.
We keep all aspects of information security arrangements under 
regular review and employees undertake mandatory information 
security e-learning.
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Viability statement
The Directors have considered  
the longer term viability of  
De La Rue plc in line with the 
recommendations under the  
UK Corporate Governance Code.
Period of review
While the Group has a five year strategic planning horizon, the financial performance 
of the Group is inherently less predictable in years four and five, therefore the 
Directors believe that an appropriate period to consider the Group’s viability is over 
three years. In assessing the viability of the Group, the Directors have reviewed the 
principal risks as set out on pages 15 to 17 and considered foreseeable scenarios 
of one or more of the principal risks crystallising in the same time period in the 
context of its strategic plan. 
The Directors have focused on principal risks that could plausibly occur and 
cause the Group’s future operational results, financial condition and future prospects 
to materially differ from current expectations, including the ability to maintain a 
dividend, meet current investment plans and compliance with liquidity ratios. 
Scenarios that are seen as implausible have not been modelled, nor have all 
potential mitigating responses. The Directors have assumed that the current 
revolving credit facility remains in place with the same covenant requirements 
throughout the three year period. 
The result of reviewing plausible scenarios is that the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group is viable and will be able to meet its obligations as they 
fall due up to March 2019. 18 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Chairman’s statement 
Together with the interim dividend paid in 
January 2016, this will give a total dividend 
for the year of 25.0p per share (2014/15: 
25.0p per share). Subject to shareholders’ 
approval, the final dividend will be paid 
on 3 August 2016 to shareholders on 
the register on 24 June 2016.
Board changes
There have been significant changes 
to both the Board and the executive 
management team in the past year. 
We have welcomed four new Board 
members since the AGM on 23 July 2015. 
Sabri Challah and Maria da Cunha joined 
the Board as Non-executive Directors to 
replace Warren East and Gill Rider who 
stood down after serving eight years and 
nine years respectively. Sabri Challah was 
appointed Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee in July 2015, replacing Gill Rider. 
Jitesh Sodha, appointed in August 2015 to 
replace Colin Child as Chief Financial Officer, 
and the Group’s Chief Operating Officer 
Rupert Middleton also joined the Board 
as Executive Directors after the 2015 AGM. 
Victoria Jarman has informed the Board 
of her decision to step down after the AGM 
having served six years as a Non-executive 
Director. We are in the advanced stages of 
recruiting a new Non-executive Director to 
the Board whom we anticipate will succeed 
Victoria as Chair of the Audit Committee. 
We would like to thank Victoria for her 
significant contribution she has made 
during her time on the Board.
We believe that the current Board 
composition offers the right balance of 
experience and skills to provide insightful 
strategic guidance as well as robust 
corporate governance to the business.
People
To coincide with the organisational 
restructuring, the Group has also 
embarked on a culture change programme 
initiated by Chief Executive Officer 
Martin Sutherland, which aims to forge a 
dynamic, agile and high performing culture 
throughout the Group. 
As always, I would like to acknowledge 
the skills and dedication of our colleagues 
at De La Rue. They have worked hard 
to deliver a solid performance and good 
strategic progress amid volatile market 
conditions and the many changes that 
have taken place internally.
Outlook
The Group’s 12 month closing order 
book of £365m provides good visibility 
for the year ahead. Whilst, as previously 
announced, a material contract came to 
an end, we are confident we can mitigate 
the impact and our expectations for the 
current year are unchanged.
Group results
I am pleased to report a solid performance 
in a year of important changes for the Group.
Against challenging market conditions, 
the Group delivered 7% revenue
1
 growth 
to £454.5m (2014/15: £422.8m) and 2% 
underlying operating profit
1
 growth to 
£70.4m (2014/15: £69.1m). Underlying 
profit before tax
1
 was 2% higher at £58.5m 
(2014/15: £57.5m) and consequently, 
underlying earnings per share increased 
to 48.1p (2014/15: 46.1p). Net exceptional 
charge before tax
1
 in the period was 
£3.6m (2014/15: £16.9m) primarily relating 
to site relocation and restructuring and 
asset impairment, which were offset by 
an exceptional gain from the sale of land. 
As a result, profit before tax
1
 was 35% 
higher at £54.9m (2014/15: £40.6m).
Underlying operating cash flow, comprising 
underlying operating profit adjusted for 
depreciation and the movement in working 
capital, increased by 17% to £100.2m 
(2014/15: £85.6m). Net debt at 26 March 
2016 was at £106.1m (2014/15: £111.0m).
Strategic progress
We have made good progress in the 
first year of the 2020 strategic plan which 
aims to focus De La Rue into growth 
markets while driving operational efficiency. 
During the year, we have completed a 
review of the manufacturing footprint, 
a key component of the Optimise and Flex 
strategy, and have a clear plan to drive 
efficiency and reduce costs in banknote 
manufacturing. In addition, we decided 
to exit the cash processing business as a 
conclusion of the ‘root and branch’ review. 
We have continued to invest in new 
capabilities and technologies to support 
future growth. The number of patent filings 
more than doubled year on year. The 
Group has launched Active™, a lenticular 
technology-based security thread that 
features a colour shifting effect and has 
designed and launched a new UK passport 
featuring one of our latest inventions, 
Continuous Bio-Data Page™, which helps 
to prevent counterfeiting. The Group has 
also made good progress in its digital 
offering with the launch of its first software 
suites for both Identity and Product 
Authentication and Traceability – DLR 
Identify™ and DLR Certify™, respectively. 
Dividend
We continue to focus on maximising 
shareholder value through a combination 
of growing profits, managing working capital 
better and being disciplined on capital 
expenditure. Taking account of all of these 
factors, the Board proposes to maintain 
the dividend at the 2014/15 level and is 
recommending a final dividend of 16.7p 
per share (2014/15: 16.7p per share).

Chief Executive Officer’s review
In May 2015, we announced a clear 
strategic plan to transform De La Rue in 
the five years to 2020 into a technology-led 
security product and service provider, with 
a more balanced business portfolio that 
will deliver growth and increased profits, 
as well as reduce performance volatility. 
Changes in the market and customers’ 
shift towards more technology-based, 
value driven procurement mean we must 
be more flexible and agile in our approach 
to managing our customer relationships, 
product pipelines and delivery.
As our product lines are exposed 
to different market dynamics we have 
identified two courses of action: Optimise 
and Flex and Invest and Build (see pages 
10 to 13 for a detailed description of our 
strategy). We have set out implementation 
plans and a clear roadmap in each of 
these areas with the aim of achieving:
• Better business mix
• Less volatile performance
• Lower customer concentration
• Higher quality earnings
 
During the year, we reorganised the 
business to a functional structure (see 
below for more about the reorganisation). 
In parallel with the reorganisation, 
I strengthened my Executive Leadership 
Team with a number of new hires, including 
Chief Financial Officer Jitesh Sodha, Chief 
Technology Officer Selva Selvaratnam and 
Chief Commercial Officer Richard Hird, 
as well as streamlining and reshaping our 
Senior Leadership Team to align with the 
functional structure. We also established a 
product management team to ensure focus 
on the development of each product line.
We are one year into our five year plan 
and have already made good progress 
in expanding our polymer product line 
and enhancing our product and service 
offerings with the launch of two end-to-end 
software solutions. We have also taken 
actions to address the overcapacity in 
Banknotes and sold the underperforming 
cash processing business. I am pleased 
with the progress we have made in the 
first year and I am confident that the right 
foundations are now in place to grow the 
business. However, there is still much more 
to do in order to deliver our strategic goals.

our capabilities by continuing to drive 
operational efficiencies and cost reduction. 
The volatility of the banknote market means 
it is essential that we build flexibility into our 
production capacity.
Banknotes
We made good progress in achieving 
production cost reduction through 
our ongoing Operational Excellence 
programme. We finished rolling out  
the Advanced Product Quality Planning 
(APQP) system, giving us a standardised 
process across all manufacturing sites.  
This enables us to share best practice, 
improve productivity and reduce spoilage. 
 
In December 2015, we announced 
the results of our manufacturing footprint 
review. The review concluded that we 
can achieve more than £13m of annual 
savings from FY2018/19 by reducing the 
number of print lines and consolidating 
banknote production into four centres of 
excellence. This will reduce our banknote 
print production capacity from eight billion 
to six billion
2
 notes a year, matching current 
and long term average market demand, 
as well as increasing our machine utilisation. 
The implementation of the restructuring 
plan is now under way following the 
conclusion of the consultation with affected 
employees (see below for more about the 
manufacturing footprint review).
We plan to gain access to additional 
capacity, as and when required, through 
external partnerships. During the year, 
we have successfully outsourced the 
printing of 500 million banknotes to three 
commercial and state banknote printers. 
We are now looking to build stronger 
relationships with selected third parties.
 
Banknote Paper
In the past year we saw increased 
demand for Banknote Paper though pricing 
remained competitive as a result of industry 
overcapacity. We made good progress 
in reducing production costs by driving 
efficiency and reducing overheads. We will 
continue to drive down cost and focus on 
growing direct sales. We are also seeking 
strategic partnerships in this market and 
exploratory discussions with a number 
of parties are ongoing, though they are 
complex and will take time. 
Cash Processing Solutions
In November 2015, we announced a 
‘root and branch’ review of CPS to address 
ongoing underperformance. We have 
completed the review and concluded that 
whilst CPS has a strong product profile and 
excellent long term customer relationships, 
we do not believe that this is a business 
which should form part of our portfolio. 
In order to focus on our core businesses, 
we have decided to exit the cash 
processing market by selling CPS to Privet 
Capital LLP . We believe that the business 
will benefit from standalone ownership.
Manufacturing 
footprint review
In light of the continuing overcapacity in the 
banknote industry, we launched an extensive 
review of our manufacturing footprint in May 
2015. We completed the review in December 
2015 and concluded that in order to improve 
efficiency and reduce cost, a restructuring of 
the footprint was needed. We plan to reduce 
our banknote print production capacity from 
eight billion to six billion
2
 banknotes per year 
by reducing the number of print lines from 
eight to four and consolidating banknote 
production into four centres of excellence: 
in Kenya, Sri Lanka, as well as Gateshead 
and Debden in the UK. The existing banknote 
production in Malta will be closed. We will have 
the ability to increase capacity up to seven 
billion notes through built in flexibility and to 
access to additional capacity through external 
partnerships. In order to accelerate growth in 
Identity Solutions and Product Authentication 
and Traceability, we plan to invest in new 
technologies and skills to create a centre of 
excellence for identity and security print at the 
current site in Malta. The restructuring requires 
an incremental capital investment of c£15m, 
with an associated one-off cost of £8m over 
the next two years. The plan is expected to 
generate more than £13m annual cost savings 
once it is complete in FY2018/19.

Invest and Build
We continue to build on De La Rue’s 
long history of innovation, investing in 
differentiating features, new technologies 
and digital solutions. We have restructured 
our R&D team and prioritised our efforts in 
high growth and high margin product lines. 
We plan to double our R&D investment 
by 2020.
In order to accelerate growth in Identity 
Solutions and Product Authentication and 
Traceability (PA&T), we plan to invest in new 
capabilities and skills to create a centre of 
excellence for identity and security print at 
the De La Rue site in Malta. We have also 
put in place a dedicated team with new 
skills to strengthen our sales effort for both 
Identity Solutions and PA&T.
Polymer
Launched in 2012, sales of our polymer 
substrate Safeguard
®
 have started to gain 
traction. We built on the progress made in 
2014 by growing the number of customers 
from seven to 14, including all three 
Scottish note issuing banks. We reached 
an important milestone by winning our first 
volume customer, with a significant three 
year contract of polymer substrate and 
a technology partnership. This raises our 
nominal market share to c5% by volume. 
We aim to continue to grow our market 
share by targeting customers that already 
use polymer as well as those looking to 
convert paper and coins to polymer. 
 
Revenue breakdown
 Optimise and Flex 69% 
 Invest and Build 31% 
We continue to focus much of our 
R&D efforts on developing our polymer 
capability, expanding the number of 
polymer-suited security features and 
enhancing the process for substrate 
manufacturing and banknote printing. 
There is a growing interest in polymer 
banknotes as central banks look for ways 
to reduce the overall cost of banknote 
ownership. As the only integrated polymer 
substrate manufacturer and experienced 
polymer banknote printer, we are well 
placed to capture this growth opportunity.
Security features
We believe that continuous innovation will 
give us greater differentiation and a unique 
advantage in a competitive market. 
In 2015 we made good progress in 
security feature development, with the 
launch of a micro-optics security thread 
– Active™ – which has already won its 
first two customers. The combination 
of cutting edge lenticular technology with 
microscopic fine line printing gives the 
new feature a distinctive 3D colour shifting 
effect that is simple to verify but difficult 
for counterfeiters to replicate. 
To maximise the value of our existing 
product capabilities, we have started to 
explore cross-product utilisation, such as 
applying polymer and holographic features 
to passports. We also leverage our award 
winning design capabilities to enhance 
the sales channel for our new features 
by incorporating them into banknote 
and passport designs. In order to be 
at the forefront of technological progress 
and to accelerate product development, 
we continue to seek partnerships with 
research institutes and universities.
Differentiating 
through design
The design team plays an important role in 
each stage of our integrated business model. 
Our refined engraving skills and a century 
of knowledge and experience in banknote 
production give us a competitive advantage. 
The introduction of our polymer substrate 
Safeguard
®
 provides further opportunity 
for design innovation, illustrated by the new 
Maldives banknotes (see image) launched 
in November 2015. Moreover, the new 
UK passport, designed and produced by 
De La Rue, won the 2015 London Design 
Award for its sophisticated security layering 
and intricate design.  22 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Chief Executive Officer’s review 
continued
Continuous innovation
According to the World Bank, more than 
100 countries around the world don’t have 
efficiently functioning civil registration systems. 
DLR Identify™ CRVS (Civil Registration, Vital 
Statistics) extends the DLR Identify™ service 
from passports to civil registration. It enables 
governments to record life events of their 
citizens such as births, death and marriages 
more efficiently and cost effectively. The data 
recorded establishes the rights of individuals to 
services such as education and health care as 
well as providing vital statistics to governments 
for future planning.
Identity Solutions
In collaboration with Her Majesty’s 
Passport Office (HMPO) in the UK, we 
redesigned the UK passport. The redesign 
was launched in November 2015. The 
passport won the prestigious London 
Design Award for its intricate design and 
sophisticated security layering. It includes 
one of our latest inventions, the Continuous 
Bio-Data Page™ construction method 
which makes the passport much harder to 
counterfeit. To further enhance our passport 
offering we also acquired expertise, unique 
manufacturing capabilities and technologies 
by partnering with Japanese printer 
Dai Nippon Printing Co.
As countries increasingly look for 
secure and technology based population 
authentication and border control, there 
is expected to be a growing demand 
for end-to-end solutions and services. 
In June, we launched our first identity 
software suite – DLR Identify™ which 
provides an end-to-end solution for 
governments to manage and monitor 
the process for authenticating and 
issuing a passport. 
Product Authentication and Traceability
We made steady progress in PA&T during 
the year, with the launch of our next 
generation digital solution – DLR Certify™. 
The end-to-end solution provides a track 
and trace capability, helping governments 
and commercial organisations to protect 
tax revenue and the integrity of their 
products and brands. We have already 
secured our first customer and will 
continue to focus on building credibility 
by securing reference customers. We have 
also initiated discussions with a number of 
potential technology partners to strengthen 
our digital platform. 
Operational excellence
As part of the Operational Excellence 
programme, we have introduced the 
Advanced Product Quality Planning system 
used widely in the automotive industry into 
our product development process. The 
purpose of this process, known as ‘design 
for manufacture’, is to design products 
according to our manufacturing capabilities 
and allow potential problems to be fixed in the 
design phase, avoiding substantial wastage 
at the manufacturing stage and saving costs. 
Rigorous quality control is then applied at each 
stage of the production process by shop floor 
operators, who are accountable for meeting 
cost and quality targets.

Driving a high performing culture
We recognise the importance of corporate 
culture to the success of our strategy. 
In order to become a dynamic, agile and 
results driven organisation, we have made 
significant changes in the last 18 months, 
including the complete reorganisation 
of the business and a revision of sales 
incentive schemes. To create a flatter 
organisational structure, we have reshaped 
the Senior Leadership Team to a smaller 
number of talented people with increased 
accountability, and reduced total average 
headcount by 10%.
To encourage a performance driven 
culture, we have launched a recognition 
programme – High Five – where employees 
can be recognised and rewarded by 
their colleagues and managers for 
demonstrating the Company values and 
for outstanding performance. We have also 
put in place a performance management 
framework, including regular personal 
development reviews for all employees.
As part of our leadership development 
and succession planning, 50 of our Senior 
Leadership Team members took part in 
a customised Harvard Intelligent Strategy 
programme. The programme builds 
insight and capability in strategic thinking, 
strategy execution and managing change. 
With the first phase of the programme 
completed in December 2015, the second 
phase has now started and focuses on 
implementation. In addition, we launched 
the Centre for Learning platform that will 
provide best in class training for all 
De La Rue employees.
Currency performance
The Currency segment comprises 
Banknotes, Banknote Paper, Polymer, 
and Security Features.
The segment grew its revenue by 
11% to £353.3m (2014/15: £317.9m) 
and operating profit by 9% to £55.1m 
(2014/15: £50.5m), primarily reflecting 
the increased volumes in Banknotes.
While volatility in the banknote market 
continued and orders remained lumpy, 
overall margins in the year were stable. 
Banknote volumes increased by 9% to 
7.1bn notes (2014/15: 6.5bn) partly due 
to winning overspill orders. Following 
extensive trials, production of the new 
£5 Sterling polymer notes began in 
October 2015 and is progressing well. 
Banknote Paper volumes were up 6% 
to 10,000 tonnes (2014/15: 9,400 tonnes), 
also benefiting from overspill contracts. 
Margins, however, continued to face 
downward pressure from oversupply 
in the industry.
Polymer gained encouraging momentum 
marked by the significant three year 
contract with a large customer, which 
resulted in a modest revenue contribution 
and a small operating loss for the year. 
Security Features performed as expected, 
though an important five year contract, 
which had contributed annual revenue 
of £30m, came to an end and was 
not renewed. While this is expected to 
affect the profitability of this product line 
in 2016/17, we are confident that we 
can mitigate the impact through other 
opportunities that we are actively pursuing. 
We remain optimistic about the long term 
growth prospect of this business.
At the year end the 12 month order 
book for Currency including estimated 
call-off orders for material contracts was 
up 85% at £278m on a like for like basis 
(2014/15: £150m). This provides good 
visibility for 2016/17. 24 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Chief Executive Officer’s review 
continued
Identity Solutions performance
Revenue was 5% lower at £65.8m 
(2014/15: £69.0m) and operating profit 
was down to £6.4m (2014/15: £11.1m). 
The decline in both revenue and operating 
profit was expected and predominantly due 
to contractual reduction in contribution on 
a large contract.
The ten year contract with HMPO in 
the UK to produce and issue passports 
continues to perform well. Volumes were 
up 2% year on year. A new design of the 
passport was launched in November 
2015 which included our latest security 
features Continuous Bio-Data Page™ 
and SkyLight™. 
Sales of e-passports were slower than 
anticipated as a number of expected 
tenders were delayed, although the sales 
pipeline remained good. Our main focus 
in the next 12 months is to convert some 
of the pipeline to revenue and profit. 
In June 2015, we launched our first identity 
software suite, DLR Identify™. During the 
year, we successfully installed the software 
with its first customer.
 
Product Authentication and Traceability 
performance
Revenue was flat year on year at £39.5m 
(2014/15: £39.6m), with operating profit 
up 19% to £8.9m (2014/15: £7.5m). The 
higher operating margin was due to cost 
savings from the closure of the Dulles site 
in 2014/15.
We continued to focus on building 
reference customers in both the public 
and private sectors, aiming particularly at 
central governments and enterprises that 
produce high value goods or operate in 
highly regulated industries. 
Our track and trace solution DLR 
Certify™ was launched in April 2015 and 
successfully delivered to its first customer 
in November 2015. 
Cash Processing Solutions 
performance
Sales volumes in Cash Processing 
Solutions (CPS) were affected by increased 
competition and adverse exchange 
movement, which resulted in a 33% decline 
in revenue to £33.9m (2014/15: £50.7m) 
and an operating loss of £7.9m 
(2014/15: operating profit of £0.4m). 
Following a ‘root and branch’ review 
initiated in November 2015, we have 
decided to exit the cash processing 
business. The sale of the CPS business 
was completed on 22 May 2016.

Introduction
I am pleased that in my first year as 
Chief Financial Officer, full year underlying 
operating profit was better than expected. 
Following a strategic review, the Board 
decided to dispose of the Cash Processing 
Solutions (CPS) business. It is a business 
that has underperformed for a number 
of years. The results for the CPS business 
have been treated as a discontinued 
operation in this Annual Report and its 
net assets are disclosed as an ‘asset held 
for sale’ on the balance sheet. Excluding 
discontinued businesses underlying 
operating profit increased to £70.4m 
(2014/15: £69.1m). All figures presented 
in this section are for continuing operations 
only unless stated otherwise.
Financial results
Group revenue increased by 7% to 
£454.5m (2014/15: £422.8m) and 
underlying operating profit increased 
slightly to £70.4m (2014/15: £69.1m). 
Underlying profit before tax increased 
by 2% to £58.5m (2014/15: £57.5m) 
and consequently underlying earnings 
per share increased by 4% to 48.1p 
(2014/15: 46.1p). 
Net exceptional charges before tax, in the 
period totalled £3.6m (2014/15: £16.9m). 
Further details of exceptional items are 
noted on page 26.
Profit before tax was £54.9m  
(2014/15: £40.6m).
On a pre disposal basis, underlying 
operating cash flow, comprising underlying 
operating profit adjusted for depreciation 
and the movement in working capital, 
was £100.2m (2014/15: £85.6m). 
This represents a cash conversion ratio 
of 160% (2014/15: 123%). 
Net debt at 26 March 2016 improved by 
£4.9m at £106.1m (2014/15: £111.0m).
Dividend
The Board is recommending a 
final dividend of 16.7p per share 
(2014/15: 16.7p per share). Together 
with the interim dividend paid in January 
2016, this will give a total dividend for the 
year of 25.0p per share (2014/15: 25.0p 
per share). Subject to approval by 
shareholders, the final dividend will be paid 
on 3 August 2016 to shareholders on the 
register on 24 June 2016. The proposed 
total dividend for the year is covered 
1.6 times. 
Finance charge
The Group’s net interest charge was £4.8m 
(2014/15: £4.6m) reflecting an increase 
in the average level of net debt during 
the period. The IAS19 related finance cost, 
which represents the difference between 
the interest on pension liabilities and assets 
was £7.1m (2014/15: £7.0m).

Exceptional items
During the period exceptional items on 
continuing operations, summarised below, 
totalling £3.6m net, have been charged 
(2014/15: £16.9m net – see note 4 
for details).
Site relocation and restructuring 
costs in 2015/16 were £9.2m net 
(2014/15: £2.8m net). Restructuring costs 
were incurred as part of the redesign of the 
organisation structure and the optimisation 
of manufacturing capabilities including 
the impact of the manufacturing footprint 
review which will reduce our banknote print 
production capacity from eight billion to 
six billion
1
 notes a year.
The sale of surplus land in Overton 
generated a profit of £9.5m while 
surplus warranty provisions of £1.3m, 
previously charged as exceptional items 
(2014/15: £3.0m) were released in 
the period.
Following a review of capitalised assets, 
£5.2m of tangible assets within the 
Currency segment were written down 
representing assets linked with specific 
products whose future income streams 
are forecast to be insufficient to support 
the current carrying value.
The net cash cost of exceptional items 
for continuing operations in the period 
was £12.5m. £17.6m of cash costs 
related to prior periods and predominantly 
reflected the settlement of the invocation 
of guarantees provided for as a post 
balance sheet event in 2014/15. 
Exceptional charges on discontinued 
operations were £26.0m – see note 2 for 
details. These related to CPS which was 
sold on 22 May 2016.
Site closure and restructuring costs in 
2015/16 were £2.6m (2014/15: £1.9m) 
mainly reflecting the closure of the 
Brazil operation.
Asset impairments of £23.4m arising 
on the remeasurement of the disposal 
group to fair value less costs to sell have 
been recognised. The impairment has 
been applied to intangibles of £1.6m 
and goodwill of £4.0m and inventories 
of £17.8m.
The cash cost for exceptional items, 
on discontinued operations, was £1.0m 
(2014/15: £1.7m).
Cash flow and borrowings
All figures stated in this section are on  
a pre disposal basis. Underlying operating 
cash flow, comprising underlying 
operating profit adjusted for depreciation 
and the movement in working capital, 
was £100.2m (2014/15: £85.6m). 
This represents a cash conversion ratio 
(underlying operating cash flow divided 
by underlying operating profit) of 160% 
(2014/15: 123%).
Net debt decreased by £4.9m to 
£106.1m (2014/15: £111.0m). This was 
predominantly from improved working 
capital with increases in advanced 
payments received from customers.
The Group utilises a £250.0m 
revolving credit facility which expires in 
December 2019. The Group has operated 
well within the key financial covenants on 
this facility. These are that the ratio of EBIT 
to net interest payable be greater than four 
times and the net debt to EBITDA ratio 
be less than three times. At the period 
end the specific bank covenant tests 
were as follows: EBIT/net interest payable 
of 12.9 times and Net debt/EBITDA of 
1.25 times.
Capital structure
At 26 March 2016 the Group had net 
liabilities of £145.6m (28 March 2015: 
£146.9m) mainly due to the recognition of 
the long term retirement benefit obligations 
of £219.9m (2014/15: £236.7m) in 
accordance with IAS19.
The Company had shareholders’ funds 
of £174.4m (2014/15: £199.6m) and had 
101.4m fully paid ordinary shares in issue 
(2014/15: 101.1m) at the year end.
Taxation
The net tax charge for the year was £6.3m 
(2014/15: £7.7m). The effective tax rate 
before exceptional items was 14.7% 
(2014/15: 17.6%). The tax rate is lower 
than the prior year primarily as a result 
of favourable changes to UK tax rates, 
reducing from 21% to 20% in the current 
year and further reducing to 18% from 
April 2020. The Group has also benefited 
from the increasing relief available under 
the UK Patent Box regime. 
Net tax credits relating to exceptional 
items, on continuing operations, arising 
in the period were £1.8m (2014/15 £2.4m). 
In addition there was an exceptional credit 
of £0.5m (2014/15: £nil) in respect of the 
determination of the tax treatment of a prior 
year exceptional restructuring item.

Pension deficit and funding
During 2015/16, special funding 
payments of £19.1m (including scheme 
administration fees) were made to the 
Group’s UK defined benefit pension 
scheme (closed to new members in 2010 
and future accrual from April 2013). The 
Group’s formal triennial funding valuation 
of the UK defined benefit pension scheme 
as at 5 April 2015 has not been finalised 
as the Company and scheme Trustees 
continue discussions with the Pensions 
Regulator. The previous valuation took 
place on 5 April 2012 and identified that 
the scheme had a deficit of £180.0m. 
The Group had agreed with the scheme 
Trustees and the Pension Regulator 
deficit funding payments to the scheme 
of £18.9m in 2016/17, rising by 4% per 
annum. Pending finalisation of the 2015 
valuation, the special funding arrangements 
agreed in 2012 which aim to eliminate the 
deficit by 2022 remain unchanged.
Recognition of the current deficit in 
accordance with IFRS when combined 
with overseas unfunded obligations results 
in the negative net assets shown on the 
Group balance sheet.
 
The valuation of the UK pension scheme 
under IAS19 principles indicates a pre-tax 
scheme deficit at 26 March 2016 of 
£217.6m (28 March 2015: £234.1m). 
The decrease of £16.5m is largely a 
reflection of the increase in the discount 
rate used to project the value of the 
scheme liabilities (3.5% in 2015/16 
compared with 3.2% in the prior year) 
and the Group funding contributions. 
The decrease has been partly mitigated 
by an increase in the life expectancy of 
members and lower than expected returns 
of scheme assets.
In common with other final salary schemes, 
the scheme valuation is very sensitive to 
any movement in the discount rate, with 
a 0.25% increase in the discount rate 
resulting in a £49.0m decrease in liabilities 
or vice versa. The deficit would reduce 
should interest and discount rates increase 
in the future.
The charge to operating profit in respect 
of the UK defined benefit pension scheme 
for 2015/16 was £1.2m (2014/15: £1.1m). 
In addition, under IAS19 there was a finance 
charge of £7.1m arising from the difference 
between the interest cost on liabilities and 
the interest income on scheme assets 
(2014/15: £7.0m).
Post balance sheet events
Since the year end the following material 
non adjusting event has occurred:
On 22 May 2016 the sale of the 
Cash Processing Solutions business 
was completed. The net result will 
be recognised in the half year ending 
24 September 2016. This includes the loss 
on disposal of current assets and liabilities 
held for sale (refer to note 2), the recycling 
through the income statement of 
accumulated foreign exchange translation 
movements recorded in reserves and the 
estimated costs of disposal.
In addition to the cash payment upon 
completion and deferred cash payments 
there is also a contingent element of 
consideration which is dependent upon 
the disposed business meeting certain 
future targets.

Reward and recognition Centre for learning
Responsible business
Our approach
We use our resources wisely and take 
our relationships and responsibilities 
seriously. We have responsibilities that 
go well beyond pure commercial gain: 
to the environment and to our customers, 
employees, local communities, suppliers 
and investors. These responsibilities 
are key, as we commit to invest in 
and develop our people in addition to 
dealing ethically with all our stakeholders. 
We have maintained our membership 
of the FTSE4Good Index which identifies 
companies that meet recognised 
standards of corporate responsibility.
Accountability
The Board is responsible for assessing 
how corporate responsibility issues 
could affect the Group and for setting 
appropriate polices. The Chief Executive 
Officer is the Board member with 
designated responsibility. He is supported 
by the Executive Leadership Team, the 
Risk Committee, and the Health, Safety 
and Environment (HSE) Committee. For 
the responsibilities of each Committee, 
see pages 31 and 38.
Resources
Our employees are the key to our success. 
They are a vital resource that we value and 
are keen to retain and develop. We have 
launched a number of initiatives this year 
to engage and develop our employees, 
some of which are detailed below.
Engagement and development
Centre for learning
In 2015, we launched a new centre 
of excellence for learning to focus on 
developing our staff and equipping them 
with the most appropriate knowledge, 
skills and behaviours. It has a clear mission 
to provide best in class learning and 
development for all our staff, to enable us 
to realise our strategy. It focuses on two 
key areas, which are crucial to our long 
term success:
•  Developing our leaders – equipping 
them with the business and people skills 
to execute our strategy 
•  Developing our high potentials – ensuring 
we identify, engage and effectively 
manage our talent 
In 2016, we will build on these two key 
areas and begin to offer function based 
skills training. We will also continue to 
build on the great work achieved by our 
Delivery function through the Operational 
Excellence programme.
Reward and recognition
As part of our performance management 
strategy, we have introduced a global 
recognition programme called ‘High Five’, 
which is underpinned by our five 
corporate values. 
The initiative was the result of feedback 
from our global employee survey, which 
told us we could do more to recognise 
high levels of performance.
Employee assistance programme
An Employee Assistance Programme was 
recently launched for our UK employees. 
This offers free and confidential help and 
advice provided by an independent third 
party. We offer similar support to our 
employees in other regions.
High Five programme
High Five is an online platform, which 
helps us to share and celebrate success 
and commitment around the business. 
Employees can send recognition to each other 
and managers can allocate ‘points’ for great 
performance and behaviours that employees 
can turn into gifts. The online platform 
also gathers nominations for our Annual 
Recognition Event that recognises employees 
who have gone ‘above and beyond’ their day 
job in driving De La Rue’s success. 
We meet recognised 
standards of corporate 
responsibility with 
regard to our resources, 
stakeholder relationships 
and the environment.  29 De La Rue Annual Report 2016

Equality and diversity
Our policy is to treat all employees 
fairly and equally in recruitment, training, 
development, promotion and in their terms 
and conditions of employment, irrespective 
of their gender, transgender status, sexual 
orientation, religion or belief, marital 
status, civil partnership status, age, colour, 
nationality, national origin, disability or trade 
union affiliation.
We provide all line managers globally 
with equal opportunities training, as 
part of our Management Fundamentals 
training programme. We also re-trained 
all employees on our Code of Business 
Principles (see below) so they understand 
that treating others with fairness and 
respect is inherent to our business. To the 
extent permitted by local laws, we collect 
certain data on staff diversity. 
Gender diversity

For further information about Board 
diversity, see pages 42 and 45.
Communications
We are committed to direct and open 
communication with our employees.
It is vital that all our employees understand 
their part in achieving our strategic goals. 
The Executive Leadership Team, in 
conjunction with local management, have 
held face to face presentations and global 
calls to explain the strategy to their teams. 
We followed these events with a series 
of digital, print and video updates.
As a result, 97% of respondents in our 
recent pulse employee survey agreed that 
‘De La Rue’s Group strategy has been 
communicated to me’.
To encourage two way communication, the 
Chief Executive Officer holds regular global 
update calls in which all employees can 
participate and ask questions. In addition, 
the executive management meet operational 
teams at our manufacturing sites regularly. 
This direct and open approach has ensured 
that a high proportion of our employees 
believe in and understand the strategy.
Human rights
We fully support the principles set out 
in the UN Declaration of Human Rights 
and the guidelines of the International 
Labour Organisation. This includes 
respecting diversity, supporting the drive 
to abolish child labour and complying 
with national legal requirements regarding 
the minimum wage and working hours. 
The Code of Business Principles was 
recently relaunched and demonstrates 
how the organisation is fully committed 
to ensuring that the highest ethical 
standards are embedded throughout 
our business. The Code covers issues 
including whistleblowing, human rights, 
protecting personal information, bribery 
and corruption. Through training for all 
employees relating to the Code of Business 
Principles and with monitoring of feedback 
through our De La Rue CodeLine, we seek 
to ensure that our policies work in practice. 
We are not aware of any human rights 
issues in our business. 
Relationships
In addition to our employees, we have 
important relationships with many external 
stakeholders and engage with them on 
a daily basis.
Customers
The customer remains at the heart of 
everything we do. We are very proud of 
the long lasting customer relationships 
that have been built, some of which span 
decades and even centuries. To measure 
our performance, we undertake regular 
market surveys to collect meaningful 
information from both existing and 
prospective customers. 
In addition to regular meetings and 
interactions with individual customers, 
we attend industry conferences to 
reach as wide an audience as possible. 
We also run our own regular training 
courses and conferences, both in specific 
regions and centrally in the UK. Our 
Advanced Banknote Manager Course 
is available to our central bank and SPW 
customers and offers the opportunity for 
in-depth interaction with and between 
the delegates.
Third party partners
The Group has a number of third party 
partners (TPPs), who support the sales 
process and customer relationships around 
the world. We have an independent central 
team which manages all third party partner 
appointments and renewals. The team 
reports directly to the General Counsel and 
Company Secretary. The process is subject 
to audit and external verification and all 
appointments are subject to appropriate 
due diligence. We provide our TPPs with 
mandatory training covering anti-bribery 
and corruption, competition law and our 
third party partner policy, which sets out 
our requirements in terms of the partners’ 
ethical and business behaviour. 
Suppliers
De La Rue applies consistent procurement 
policies and processes. This ensures 
accountability and sustainable value 
for money while minimising risk and 
enabling us to fulfil our legal and financial 
obligations. We expect our suppliers to 
share our commitment to best practice 
standards in HSE matters. We also require 
suppliers to meet defined quality, product 
security and business continuity standards.
We require our suppliers to abide by 
the Group’s Code of Business Principles 
and the United Nations Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and International 
Labour Organisation Conventions 138 and 
182. As part of our ongoing procurement 
programme, we will continue to monitor 
our key cotton comber and linter suppliers. 
De La Rue subscribes to the policies in 
the UK Government’s Prompt Payment 
Code. We undertake to pay suppliers on 
time, give them clear guidance on payment 
procedures and encourage good practice 
amongst our lead suppliers. 30 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Responsible business

Community
Many of our sites across the world engage 
with their local communities by supporting 
charitable organisations, often focusing on 
smaller, locally based charities where our 
employees can have the maximum impact. 
Over the last twelve months, employees 
have participated in a wide variety of 
activities including:
•  Refurbishing a residential home 
for people with disabilities
• Sponsoring a local children’s hospice
•  Collecting tinned foods for an 
organisation which provides assistance 
for families who need a helping hand
 
 
 
 
 
Like many sites, our head office supports 
a charity of the year, voted for annually 
by our employees. We hold themed events 
throughout the year and have managed to 
exceed our fundraising target every year.
Our annual Three Peaks Challenge in the 
UK has raised over £148,000 in five years.  
This year, 10 teams of employees competed 
to complete the event in the shortest 
time, with prizes also awarded to the best 
costume and the most unusual item to 
take up a mountain. For UK employees 
undertaking their own fundraising activities, 
the De La Rue Charitable Trust offers fund 
matching. We also offer our UK employees 
the opportunity to donate to their chosen 
charity directly from their salary, via our 
Give As You Earn scheme.
 
Leaders of the future
We continue to work with local 
communities and customers to deliver 
wider economic benefits. In the UK, we 
work with charities and schools to engage 
young people in employability skills and 
to promote and inspire them to pursue 
science, technology, engineering and 
maths (STEM) subjects, by sharing details 
of the varied STEM-related careers within 
De La Rue.
We have run the De La Rue Scholarship 
programme in the Caribbean since 
2002 and now have 42 scholars from 
Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the 
Eastern Caribbean and Barbados. We 
offer scholarships through the University 
of the West Indies for students studying 
economics, finance and actuarial sciences. 
In summer 2015, we ran a two month 
internship for two scholars, giving us the 
opportunity to use their expertise and 
giving them the opportunity to live and 
work in the UK.
Responsibilities
Ethics
As one of the founding members of the 
Banknote Ethics Initiative (BnEI), De La Rue 
continues to drive best practice across 
the banknote industry. BnEI promotes 
ethical business practice, with a focus on 
preventing corruption and on compliance 
with anti-trust law in the industry. The 
independent accreditation provides 
customers with assurance in respect of 
the ethical standards they want from their 
suppliers. De La Rue’s BnEI accreditation 
covers the whole Group, not just our 
Banknotes business.
We require all employees and business 
partners to follow our Code of Business 
Principles when they are representing 
De La Rue. We have re-launched the Code 
across the entire business, with a number 
of updated policies and materials. All 
employees and third party partners receive 
training on the Code and the standards 
of ethical behaviour De La Rue expects. 
In our recent pulse employee survey, 91% 
of respondents agreed that ‘At this site we 
are encouraged to always act in an honest 
and ethical way’, a 6% increase since the 
2014 survey.
A steering group of senior employees 
meets regularly to look at ways to ensure 
that the Code’s principles are embedded 
in everything we do. The steering group is 
also a central point of advice and support 
for our network of site based ethics 
champions. The ethics champion initiative 
helps us to understand and respond to 
the needs of each site in a focused and 
effective way, and ensures they have local 
support and representation for Code related 
matters. In October 2015, all our ethics 
champions attended a second training 
conference. The champions also schedule 
regular conference calls, to highlight issues 
and provide a forum for discussion.
‘There is fantastic support from 
employees for the work that we 
do with local charities, whether they 
contribute to fundraising, spend 
time coaching school students or 
simply donate items to a collection. 
For staff it also creates development 
opportunities and the chance to 
get to know employees from other 
departments and business areas.’
Amanda Wiltshire, Head of  
De La Rue For Good Team 
at Basingstoke
‘The internship was absolutely 
fantastic. I had complete freedom 
over the direction of the research 
project once the topic was selected 
and I really got a chance to put my 
econometric skills to use.’
Travis Atkinson, intern 2015
‘I met dedicated and fascinating 
people who take the role seriously 
and I’m confident will be able to help 
if asked.’ 
‘Real life examples prove again and 
again that ethics principles must not 
be undervalued.’

Strategic report Directors’ report Accounts
The Audit Committee reviews our 
whistleblowing policy and procedures 
each year. These enable employees who 
have concerns about the application of the 
Code of Business Principles or business 
practices within the Group to raise them 
either internally or through the De La Rue 
CodeLine, an anonymous telephone and 
email helpline operated by an independent 
third party. The Board and the Ethics 
Committee receive details about any issue 
raised and how it has been followed up.
Health and safety
The Group Health, Safety and Environment 
(HSE) Committee is responsible for 
monitoring HSE activities throughout the 
Group, identifying areas for improvement 
and making recommendations on strategy.
A working environment in which every 
individual cares about the health, welfare 
and safety of their colleagues is necessary 
for a highly productive and good place 
to work. We have a responsibility to 
safeguard the health and safety of all 
stakeholders affected by our operations 
and to keep our employees safe and 
secure when they are at work and travelling 
on business. We have clearly defined 
systems that identify responsibilities, 
training requirements, hazard spotting, 
risk assessments and other appropriate 
controls at all of our facilities, to help 
us to achieve this.
Our employee survey this year 
confirmed that over 92% of our people 
think De La Rue is a safe place to work. 
To enhance existing training, we have 
launched a global travel security awareness 
programme for all employees, to raise 
awareness of potential travel security and 
safety risks and identify appropriate action. 
This is particularly important to us and we 
offer enhanced training for our employees 
who travel to higher risk countries to carry 
out our business.
We have just received a Bronze award in 
the UK’s Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Accidents (RoSPA) annual Occupational 
Health and Safety Awards for consistently 
good H&S performance.
All of our main manufacturing sites have 
maintained OHSAS18001 certification 
for their health and safety management 
systems, which is externally audited by 
accredited providers. We are currently 
working towards centralising these scopes. 
During the year, no De La Rue operation 
was prosecuted for infringing any health 
and safety laws or regulations. 
 
The Executive Leadership Team and the 
Board receive confirmation that all sites 
comply with Group health, safety and 
environmental policies and any applicable 
legislation through external and internal 
audits on their management systems. 
We measure sites against any corrective 
actions identified and use these reports, 
along with employee suggestions, to 
develop effective continuous improvement 
programmes. Our Global HSE Manager 
reviews our HSE standards and audit 
protocols annually and updates these 
where needed. This ensures we continue 
to drive good practices and that our 
standards and protocols are aligned with 
the phased approach used in the Delivery 
Operational Excellence programme.
De La Rue works with its main suppliers 
and contractors to ensure their health and 
safety processes are robust. Our focus 
on machinery safety continues, with many 
improvements completed this year. An 
independent machinery safety consultancy 
checks all the machinery we purchase, 
to verify its compliance with the latest UK/
EU machinery safety standards. As part 
of the footprint review, we are relocating 
several large machines and we will conduct 
full safety reviews prior to refurbishing 
and shipping them to their new location. 
We also continue to invest in and improve 
our fire risk management, with several 
sites upgrading their on-machinery fire 
suppression systems. 
We achieved all of our health and safety 
objectives for 2015/16. We reduced our 
overall number of lost time accidents and 
lost time work days due to accidental 
injuries by 50% and increased our near 
miss reporting by a further 6%, which we 
view as a positive trend. With continuing 
organisational changes, we have 
successfully maintained our positive 
safety culture and excellent internal 
reporting processes and continue to 
engage employees in our safety training 
programmes. We delivered over 2400 
man-days of HSE related training this year 
across the company, about 20% was part 
of our new Making Good Safety Decisions 
programme. We will continue to set robust 
health and safety objectives and targets 
and verify our compliance and good 
practice programmes through our internal 
audit programme. 
Our health and safety objectives 
for 2015/16 were:
•  To continue to reduce at work injuries  
and move to a Lost Time Injury Frequency 
Rate per 200,000 worked hours 
(to enable benchmarking) – Achieved
•  To continue to demonstrate 
manufacturing site improvements 
within our internal HSE audit levels 
programme (Levels 1-5 are verified 
on Group audits) – Achieved
•  To achieve a Lost Time Injury Frequency 
Rate (LTIFR) per 200,000 worked 
hours of 0.55 or less (ie better than UK 
manufacturing rate) – Achieved 0.31
•  To ensure that all older machinery, 
after independent safety assessments, 
is upgraded or replaced over the 
next four years – On track part of the 
manufacturing footprint restructuring
•  To obtain OHSAS18001 certification 
at Head Office, with a view to bringing 
all manufacturing sites under this scope 
by December 2017
Our health and safety objectives 
for 2016/17 are:
•  To maintain a world class lost time injury 
frequency rate per 200,000 worked hours 
(<0.62 LTIFR)
•  To continue to demonstrate 
manufacturing site continuous 
improvement by our internal HSE 
audit levels programme
•  To continue progressing our new 
Making Good Safety Decisions training 
by completing three modules at 
Delivery sites
•  To ensure that all older machinery, 
after independent safety assessments, 
is upgraded or replaced over the next 
three years
•  To obtain ISO45001 certification at 
Head Office with a view to bringing all 
manufacturing sites under this scope 
during 2016/17 32 De La Rue Annual Report 2016

Environment
We continue to measure greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions arising from 
all of the activities for which we are 
responsible worldwide. 
As in previous years we have reviewed 
our data collection and reporting processes 
in line with best practice with support 
from independent specialist consultants 
Carbon Clear. 
Using an operational control approach 
the Group has collected activity data and 
reported on all material GHG emissions 
including scopes 1 and 2 and a range of 
scope 3. The validity and completeness of 
the data were checked both internally and 
by Carbon Clear, with the internally assured 
data being used to calculate the GHG 
emissions for the Group. KPMG LLP also 
reviewed the process used for collecting 
and analysing the data in 2014 and this 
has not changed.
The calculations performed follow the 
ISO14064-1:2006 standard and the results 
presented in the table on page 33 give 
absolute and intensity factors for Group 
emissions. The Group uses renewable 
energy and exports electricity to the grid 
at some sites. These practices have been 
quantified and accounted for against the 
Group’s gross GHG emissions to show 
a net reduction.

This year the figures can be compared 
to last year with confidence as several 
improvements to data collection techniques 
and calculation methods were again 
achieved. The emissions intensity, which 
is reported relative to Group revenues 
is 213 net tCO2e per million turnover. 
This shows a decrease of 6% compared 
against last year’s figure of 226 net tCO2e 
per £m turnover. This improvement 
has partially been affected by the 3% 
increase in revenue but also reflects a 2% 
reduction in the emissions associated with 
electricity consumption.
In real energy terms the natural gas 
consumption emissions were up 2.3%, 
primarily affected by increased production 
volume at the Overton site.
Water used per gross tonne of banknote 
paper produced is dependent on 
product mix and volume and also reflects 
complexity of specifications and security 
features and has remained level with 
the previous year. Overton Mill is one of 
De La Rue’s major installations. Its sole 
water resource is abstracted groundwater, 
which is in turn cleaned and discharged 
into the River Test, within 500 metres 
of the point of abstraction. The river is 
classified as a Site of Special Scientific 
Interest protected by UK conservation 
regulations. We share the keen interest 
shown by varied stakeholders in ensuring 
that the water quality and quantity is 
optimised for good ecology, and so 
follow best practice regarding our use, 
treatment and release of freshwater. Our 
water treatment facilities meet and exceed 
expected quality standards as stipulated 
within the installation’s environmental 
permit. Overton Mill cleans and returns 
to the river most of the water abstracted, 
which provides an important and valuable 
contribution to the ecology of the region. 
 
Examples of environmental achievements 
during 2015/16 include:
•  We have achieved ISO14001 certification 
for Head Office and have already 
included some manufacturing sites in this 
Group scope. We have also maintained 
certification at all other Delivery sites 
receiving an expected low level of minor 
non-conformances all of which have 
been promptly rectified. We are aiming 
to transition to the new ISO14001:2015 
over the next 18 months 
•  We have improved our overall solid waste 
recycling to 83%. The volumes of solid 
waste going to landfill sites is similar to 
the previous year partially due to some 
local restrictions at some overseas sites
•  Over £0.5m investment in energy 
efficiency projects at our sites. Examples 
of these include:
 Overton – air compressor replacements
 Debden – lighting replaced with LEDs
  Gateshead – centralised compressors 
and vacuum system
 Bathford – micro-turbine extended trial
  These activities are lowering fixed costs 
and showing an annual reduction in GHG 
emissions of 500 tCO2e
Environmental objectives for 2016/17 are:
•  To continue with our ISO14001 
certification alignment for all 
manufacturing sites so that they are all 
covered by one central certificate and 
audit process
•  To reduce our greenhouse gas emissions 
in tCO2e related to output by 3% per

Chairman’s statement on corporate governance
Philip Rogerson
Chairman
Dear Shareholder
As a Board, we are committed to 
maintaining the highest standards of 
corporate governance. We strongly believe 
that good governance is at the heart 
of and is fundamental to the effective 
management of the business and its long 
term sustainability. The Board is committed 
to ensuring that it provides effective 
leadership and promotes uncompromising 
ethical standards. One of the ways in which 
the Board achieves this is by requiring that 
good governance principles and practices 
are adhered to throughout the Group.
Good governance also involves the 
exercise of judgement as to the definitions 
of success for the Group, the levels of 
risk we are willing to take to achieve that 
success and the levels of delegation to the 
executives. The exercise of this judgement 
is the responsibility of the Board. 
The Executive Leadership Team is required 
to provide such information to the Board 
as the Board needs to enable it to exercise 
judgements over these matters. The Board 
sets the tone for the Group. The way in 
which it conducts itself, its attitude to 
ethical matters, its definition of success 
and the assessment of appropriate risk, 
all define the atmosphere within which the 
Executive Leadership Team works.
In September 2014, the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) published the latest edition 
of the Code. This contains broad principles 
together with more specific provisions 
in relation to Board leadership and 
effectiveness, accountability, remuneration 
and relations with shareholders. The 
new version of the Code incorporates a 
number of changes to the previous edition 
including amendments to the principles 
and provisions relating to directors’ 
remuneration and risk management and 
internal control. It has also introduced a 
new requirement for the Board to make 
an annual viability statement. Details of 
the viability statement can be found on 
page 17 and the going concern statement 
on page 86.
 
We recognise the importance of planning 
for the future and, in line with our 
succession planning strategy, with help 
from the Nomination Committee, we have 
continued to develop our Board with a 
number of new appointments. See pages 
35 to 37 for information on the Board and 
Board Committees.
Each year, the Board undertakes a formal 
evaluation of its effectiveness. This year 
we have had this process facilitated 
by an external independent facilitator, 
Lintstock Limited. In addition, the Senior 
Independent Director has led a review 
of my performance with input from other 
Non-executive Directors. Further details 
of the evaluation process can be found on 
page 41. I am satisfied that the Board and 
its Committees are performing effectively 
and that there is the appropriate balance 
of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Group to enable the 
Directors to discharge their respective 
duties and responsibilities effectively. 
I am also satisfied that members of the 
Board, and the Non-executive Directors in 
particular, have sufficient time to undertake 
their roles at Board and Committee 
level, so as to be able to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively. 
In the pages which follow, we have set 
out our governance policies and practices 
and included details of how the Group has 
applied the main principles and complied 
with the relevant provisions of the Code. 
The corporate governance report includes 
reports from each of the Committee 
Chairs to provide details on key matters 
addressed by the Committees during 
the year.

The role of the Board and its Committees
Board
The Board is collectively accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate governance and all Directors are responsible for 
complying with their legal and fiduciary obligations. The Board believes that good corporate governance is not just a matter of compliance: 
it should contribute to the Group’s performance by making sure we have a clear strategic direction, manage our risks to the right level and 
keep the business under control. The diverse range of experience offered by the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors means that they 
are well qualified to scrutinise performance, assess the Group’s risk management and control processes, provide constructive challenge and 
to support the Executive Directors.
The core objectives of the Board are: 
• Delivering value to shareholders and other stakeholders 
•  Maintaining the Group’s reputation for integrity as the Company’s foundation of its relationship with shareholders, customers, employees, 
suppliers and other stakeholders

Board roles 40 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Focus of the Board for the year 
In the period under review, the Board’s 
focus has been on strategy and ensuring 
that the structures, capabilities and reports 
are in place to support the Group strategy. 
The Board has received regular reports 
from the Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer and the other members 
of the Executive Leadership Team.
In particular, time has been spent 
considering:
•  Review and communication of our strategy
• Our products and product strategy

•  Full and half year financial statements 
including dividends

and procedures
Governance principle: leadership 
The Board is collectively accountable 
to the Company’s shareholders for good 
corporate governance and all Directors are 
responsible for complying with their legal 
and fiduciary obligations. The Directors’ 
biographical details on pages 35 to 37 
demonstrate the skills and experience 
of the Board. The balance of skills and 
experience ensures that the duties and 
responsibilities of the Board and its 
Committees are discharged effectively.
Under the Board’s leadership, the 
Group has put in place a comprehensive 
management structure together with 
clearly defined policies, procedures 
and delegated authority. 
 
Operation of the Board 
The Board has a programme of meetings 
during the year and also meets on an ad 
hoc basis as required. The Board’s core 
procedures are set out in the terms of 
reference for the Board, its Committees 
and Directors and include the control 
of risk.
To ensure Directors maintain overall control 
over strategic, financial and compliance 
issues, the Board meets regularly 
throughout the year and has formally 
reserved certain matters to itself, generally 
being those items which affect the shape 
and risk profile of the Group. These matters 
are reviewed regularly by the Board. Full 
details are set out on the Group’s website. 
Key aspects of the Board’s role include: 
•  Determining the responsibilities of 
Directors, in particular those of the 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
•  Reviewing the effectiveness of internal 
control processes 
•  Approving the terms of reference and 
membership of Board Committees
•  Setting authority levels, financial and 
treasury policies and approving any 
material acquisition or disposal
Subject to the provisions of relevant 
statutes, the Company’s articles of 
association and any directions given 
by special resolution, the Directors may 
exercise all the powers of the Company.
Non-executive Directors are expected 
to participate actively in Board discussions 
involving the following key elements: 
•  Strategy: constructively challenge and 
contribute to the development of strategy
•  Risk: ensure that the financial and other 
information is accurate and appropriate 
to enable the Non-executive Directors to 
fulfil their roles and that financial controls 
and systems of risk management are 
robust and defensible
•  People: contribute to the development of 
appropriate levels of senior management 
(including Executive Directors) and 
succession planning
•  Performance: review the performance 
of management in meeting agreed goals 
and objectives 
Corporate governance report 
continued
Board composition and responsibilities 
As at the date of this report the Board 
comprises four independent Non-executive 
Directors, the Chairman and three 
Executive Directors. The Board has 
concluded that its composition throughout 
the year was appropriately balanced and 
remains so. 
There was a clear division between 
the management of the Board and the 
Executive Directors’ responsibility for 
managing the Group’s business. However, 
no individual or small group can dominate 
decision making. 
Andrew Stevens succeeded Warren East 
as the Senior Independent Director on 
23 July 2015. Shareholders may contact 
the Senior Independent Director if they 
consider that their concerns are not being 
addressed through normal channels. 
The roles and responsibilities of other 
Directors are also clearly defined. The 
Executive Directors and the other members 
of the Executive Leadership Team operate 
within clearly defined limits of authority 
delegated by the Board.
Colin Child, Warren East and Gill Rider 
all stood down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the Company’s AGM 
on 23 July 2015.
Two new Non-executive Directors, Sabri 
Challah and Maria da Cunha, joined the 
Board after the AGM on 23 July 2015. 
Sabri Challah succeeded Gill Rider as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
Victoria Jarman succeeded Warren East 
as Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Rupert Middleton, Chief Operating Officer, 
joined the Board as an Executive Director 
after the AGM on 23 July 2015.
Jitesh Sodha replaced Colin Child as 
Chief Financial Officer and joined the Board 
on 10 August 2015.
Victoria Jarman has informed the Board 
of her decision to step down after the AGM 
having served six years as a Non-executive 
Director. We are in the advanced stages 
of recruiting a new Non-executive Director 
to the Board whom we anticipate will 
succeed Victoria Jarman as Chair of 
the Audit Committee.
The Non-executive Directors hold letters 
of appointment which will be displayed 
at the AGM, together with the Executive 
Directors’ service agreements and 
Directors’ indemnification agreements. 
  41 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Strategic report Directors’ report Accounts
Governance principle: effectiveness 
Board effectiveness 
The Board timetable ensures that the Board 
receives regular reports and presentations 
from Executive Directors and members 
of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT). 
At each scheduled meeting, the Board 
is supplied with reports on business and 
financial performance including the approval 
of financial statements and budgets.  
During the year, the Board focused on 
areas of importance including amongst 
other things technology and innovation, 
customers, operations and health, safety 
and environment and also conducted a 
review of its governance arrangements. 
Directors receive agendas and Board 
papers generally seven days before each 
Board meeting; minutes are circulated after 
the meeting. The Board reviews progress 
on implementing actions arising from the 
Board and its Committee meetings each 
time it meets.
The Chairman of each of the Board 
Committees provides verbal reports on 
matters discussed by that Committee since 
the previous Board meeting. There is also 
a defined procedure for dealing with urgent 
matters between Board meetings. 
Any Director can request additional 
information from management at any time.
Senior management and advisers are 
invited to attend Board and Committee 
meetings where appropriate to contribute 
to discussions and advise members of the 
Board or Committee on relevant matters. 
The involvement of senior management 
helps strengthen the relationship between 
the Board and senior management 
and helps to provide the Board with a 
greater understanding of operations and 
strategy. The Board Committees make 
use of Company resources to enable 
them to undertake their duties.
Executive Leadership Team 
The ELT is the senior decision-making 
executive body and is chaired by the Chief 
Executive Officer. During the period, the 
ELT implemented the strategy approved 
by the Board and put in place functional 
reports to provide an effective process 
and system for tracking strategic drivers 
and KPIs and to facilitate transparency 
across all functions. It also reviewed health, 
safety and environmental performance, 
governance, principal risks, financial and 
operational performance.
Board evaluation 
The Board recognises the importance 
of reviewing its practices and performance 
on a regular basis and has evaluated its 
performance and that of its Committees 
and individual members. The performance 
evaluation followed the same format as 
in previous years and involved the use 
of an external independent facilitator, 
Lintstock Limited.
The review process involved completion 
of online questionnaires which focused 
on Board composition, expertise and 
dynamics, quality of the decisions made, 
Board support and processes, structure, 
behaviours and other key issues such 
as strategy and succession. The review 
also addressed delivery of the Board’s 
objectives and any issues identified during 
the previous review or which became 
relevant during the year. A report on the 
performance of the Board and each of the 
principal Committees was compiled by 
Lintstock. The results of the questionnaire 
as they applied to the Board were 
discussed collectively and objectives  
for the coming year agreed. 
The Chairman and each Committee 
chairman have discussions with each 
Director or Committee member based 
on the responses. The Senior Independent 
Director is responsible for appraising the 
Chairman’s performance in discussions 
with the Non-executive Directors and the 
Executive Directors in the absence of the 
Chairman. The Chairman holds one to one 
meetings with all Directors. 
The reviews undertaken in the year have 
concluded that the performance of the 
Board, its Committees and individual 
Directors was effective. A number of 
positive points were noted as well as areas 
of focus for the coming year, which will be 
monitored and progressed at the Board 
meetings scheduled for the year. 
Directors’ terms of appointment
Executive Directors are employees 
who have day to day responsibilities as 
executives of the Group in addition to their 
duties as Directors. Each Executive Director 
enters a service contract on appointment 
(see page 60 for further information).
Non-executive Directors are generally 
independent of the Company, are not 
employees and do not participate in the 
daily business management of the Group. 
Non-executive Directors receive a letter of 
appointment setting out the conditions of 
their appointment. Non-executive Directors 
are appointed for an initial period of three 
years, which may be extended with the 
agreement of the Board. 
Outside commitments 
On appointment, all Non-executive 
Directors are advised of the likely time 
commitments. The Directors’ biographies 
and other appointments appear on pages 
35 to 37. The Board’s policy is that the 
Chairman and Executive Directors should 
accept appointments to the boards 
of other companies only with the prior 
approval of the Board. Non-executive 
Directors must seek the agreement of the 
Chairman and confirmation by the Board 
before accepting additional commitments 
that may affect the time they devote to 
their role. The Board must be satisfied 
that these commitments do not conflict 
with their ability to carry out effectively 
their duties as Directors of the Company. 
The ability of individual Directors to 
allocate sufficient time to discharge of their 
responsibilities is, where necessary, part 
of the Directors’ annual evaluation process 
overseen by the Chairman. 42 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Appointments and annual election
A formal, rigorous and transparent 
process is followed during the selection 
and subsequent appointment of new 
Directors. All Directors are required to 
submit themselves for annual re-election. 
New Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity after 
their appointment. Non-executive Directors 
are appointed for an initial period of three 
years with the expectation of one further 
three year term subject to satisfactory 
performance and annual re-election by 
shareholders. Terms beyond this period 
are considered on a case by case basis 
and only, following a rigorous review, 
taking account of performance and ability 
to contribute to the Board in the light of 
the knowledge, skills, experience and 
diversity required.
The Board, having carried out the 
effectiveness and evaluation process, 
considers the performance of each of 
the Directors standing for election and 
re election at this year’s AGM to be fully 
satisfactory and is of the opinion that they 
have demonstrated ongoing effectiveness 
and continued commitment to the role.
In accordance with the Code, all of 
the Directors will submit themselves for 
election or re-election at the AGM to be 
held on 21 July 2016. The Board strongly 
supports their election and re-election and 
recommends that shareholders vote in 
favour of the resolutions at the AGM. 
Succession planning 
The Board reviews its composition at least 
annually, assessing the skills profile, diversity 
and type and number of Non-executive 
Directors required to enable the Board to 
perform effectively. The Board also reviews 
the Group’s internal talent review process 
in planning Executive Director and senior 
management succession.
Diversity
The Committee and the Board recognise 
and understand the importance and benefits 
of gender diversity. As at 26 March 2016 
the Board has two female Non-executive 
Directors (25% of the Board).The Board’s 
preference is to maintain the number of 
women Directors to at least the current 
level, but the over arching aim will continue 
to be the recruitment of the best candidate 
on merit regardless of gender. 
The Group’s equality and diversity policy 
is discussed further on page 29.
 
Induction and training 
An induction programme is agreed for 
all new Directors aimed at ensuring they 
are able to develop an understanding and 
awareness of the Group’s core processes, 
its people and businesses. 
During the year, Jitesh Sodha, Sabri 
Challah and Maria da Cunha received 
such induction, which included: strategy, 
operation and activities of the Group 
(including key financial data, and business, 
social and environmental risks to the 
Group’s activities). Together with Rupert 
Middleton they also received advice on 
corporate governance matters such 
as the role of the Board and individual 
Committees, and the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures as outlined in this 
report, as well as the duties and obligations 
of directors of a listed company. 
Site visits and meetings with senior 
management are also arranged. Newly  
appointed Directors are invited to attend 
external training covering directors’ duties 
and responsibilities within a listed company. 
Jitesh Sodha, Maria da Cunha, Sabri 
Challah and Rupert Middleton all attended 
such training.
Directors are briefed, where appropriate, 
by the Group’s external advisers and 
functional management on changes to 
legislation, regulation and market practice. 
Briefings from individual businesses are 
also received throughout the year. The 
Directors have the opportunity of attending 
appropriate training sessions. 
Visits by Board members to our 
operating sites are an important part of 
both induction and continuing education. 
The Board visits at least one operational 
site each year (Debden in 2015/16). 
Directors are encouraged to visit other sites 
and meet with staff. The General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, in conjunction 
with the Chairman, ensures that there 
is proper communication between the 
Board and its Committees and senior 
management and that Non executive 
Directors receive appropriate information. 
All Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary.
Directors may take independent 
professional advice at the Group’s expense, 
although no such advice was sought during 
the year.
 
Corporate responsibility
Information on the Group’s initiatives 
and commitment to corporate responsibility 
can be found on pages 28 to 33.
During the year we reviewed our current 
policies and procedures to ensure 
compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 
2015 which came into force in October 
2015. We are scoping and developing an 
implementation plan to ensure compliance 
with these new regulations is achieved in 
line with the timelines set out within the 
Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Risk management and internal controls 
The Board retains overall responsibility 
for setting the Group’s risk appetite, and 
for risk management and internal control 
systems. In accordance with section C.2.3 
of the Code, the Board is responsible 
for reviewing their effectiveness, and 
confirms that: 
•  There is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating, and managing 
the principal risks faced by the Group
•  The systems have been in place for 
the period under review and up to the 
date of approval of the annual report 
and accounts
•  They are regularly reviewed by the Board
•  The systems accord with the FRC 
guidance on risk management, internal 
control and related financial and 
business reporting
During the period the Board has directly, 
and through delegated authority to the 
Audit Committee, Risk Committee and 
the Executive Leadership Team, overseen 
and reviewed the performance of risk 
management activities and practices and 
internal control systems within De La Rue. 
Through both its ongoing involvement and 
overview in risk management and internal 
control activities, the Board is satisfied that 
the risk management and internal control 
systems in place remain effective.
This review does not extend to associated 
companies or joint ventures where the 
Group does not have management control. 
Further details on the ongoing risk 
management and internal control systems 
can be found in both the risk management 
section of this Annual Report and the Audit 
Committee report on pages 14 to 17 and 
pages 49 to 52 respectively.

Governance principle: accountability
Financial and business reporting
The Audit Committee has considered 
the requirement to put the audit out to 
tender every ten years. Further details can 
be found in the Audit Committee report 
on page 51.
The Group has a comprehensive budgeting 
system with an annual budget approved 
by the Board. Revised forecasts for the 
year are reported to the Board. Actual 
results, at both a segment and Group level, 
are reported monthly against budget and 
variances are kept under scrutiny.
The Directors consider the annual report 
and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Investor and shareholder relations
The Company places great importance 
on communications with and accountability 
to shareholders. During 2015, various steps 
have been taken to improve performance 
in this area. These included strengthening 
our investor relations department with the 
addition of an experienced professional. 
The investor relations department plays 
a key role in building stronger, clearer 
discussions with current and potential 
investors. On 27 January 2016 De La Rue 
held an analysts day at the Debden site. 
The purpose of such events is to highlight 
particular issues, themes or announcements 
that the Group believes develop a better 
understanding of the business or which 
warrant further explanation or clarification.
A full annual report and accounts is made 
available to shareholders either in hard 
copy by post or via the Group’s website 
and the interim statement is posted on 
the Group’s website. Other information 
about the Group is also available on 
the website including current business 
strategy, historical financial data and 
recent presentation materials. 
 
Announcements are also regularly made 
by the Company through a Regulatory 
Information Service to the London Stock 
Exchange. The shareholder register is 
actively monitored. The Group conducts 
a dedicated investor relations programme 
with institutional investors which includes 
various formal events during the year, as 
well as a regular series of one to one and 
group meetings. The views of shareholders 
and analysts’ and brokers’ reports are 
reported to the Board and from time to 
time a survey of institutional shareholders’ 
views is carried out by the Company’s 
brokers and reported to the Board.
The Chairman and the Senior Independent 
Director are available to meet key 
shareholders to discuss strategy, 
governance and other matters if they 
have concerns that contact through the 
normal channels has either failed or is 
deemed inappropriate. 
All holders of ordinary shares are 
entitled to attend the AGM and receive 
the notice of meeting which is posted 
at least 20 working days before the AGM. 
They are also entitled to speak at general 
meetings of the Company, to appoint one 
or more proxies or, if they are corporations, 
corporate representatives, and to exercise 
voting rights. Shareholders may vote and 
appoint proxies electronically. Shareholders 
are encouraged to register their email 
addresses so that they may benefit 
from immediate communication of the 
publication of notices of meetings and  
our online annual report.
At this year’s AGM, voting on resolutions 
will be conducted on a poll, the results 
of which will be made available to 
shareholders on the Group’s website. 
At the meeting, the Chairman will provide 
a trading update and Chairs of Board 
Committees will be present to answer 
questions on any matters relating to the 
Group’s business. Shareholders will have 
an opportunity to meet Directors informally 
after the meeting.

Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board I am pleased 
to present the 2016 Nomination 
Committee report.
The Nomination Committee has an 
important role to play in ensuring that the 
Board and its Committees have the right 
mix of skills, experience and diversity. 
This year, as part of our Board succession 
planning process, we have seen further 
enhancements to the composition of 
the Board. 
On 22 May 2015, we announced that 
two long serving members of the Board, 
Gill Rider and Warren East, would both 
step down at the conclusion of the AGM in 
July 2015. At the same time we announced 
the appointment of Maria da Cunha and 
Sabri Challah as Non-executive Directors 
on the Board effective 23 July 2015. 
Both bring highly relevant experience of 
strategy and change management which 
will enable them to make an excellent 
contribution to the Board at an exciting 
time for the business. Rupert Middleton, 
Chief Operating Officer, was also appointed 
an Executive Director to the Board on 
23 July 2015. Rupert Middleton has a 
proven track record of driving productivity, 
quality and procurement improvements 
and his experience will be an important 
asset to the Board.

Child, Group Finance Director, would step 
down from the Board at the conclusion of 
the AGM on 23 July 2015, and we were 
pleased to announce the appointment 
of Jitesh Sodha as Chief Financial Officer 
and an Executive Director effective 
from 10 August 2015. Jitesh Sodha’s 
wide ranging financial and commercial 
experience gained within a number of large 
international businesses will be an asset 
to the Group.
Biographical details of the members of the 
Board who held office up to the date of this 
report can be found on pages 35 to 37.

the Chairmen of the principal Committees,

aligned to and evolves to meet the ongoing 
strategic aims of the Group.

Strategic report Directors’ report Accounts
Succession planning and diversity 
The Group adopts a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the appointment 
of new Directors and senior executives with 
due regard to diversity and gender. Prior to 
making an appointment, the Committee will 
evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge, 
independence, experience and diversity 
on the Board and, in the light of this 
evaluation, will prepare a description of the 
role and capabilities required, with a view 
to appointing the best placed individual for 
the role. In identifying suitable candidates, 
the Committee:
•  Uses open advertising or the services 
of external consultants to facilitate 
the search
•  Considers candidates from different 
genders and a wide range of backgrounds
•  Considers candidates on merit and 
against objective criteria ensuring that 
appointees have sufficient time to devote 
to the position, in light of other potential 
significant commitments
The Board and the Committee recognise 
and understand the importance and 
benefits of gender diversity and as at 
26 March 2016 the Company has two 
female Directors, both of whom are 
Non-executive Directors. The Board’s 
preference is to maintain the number of 
women Directors to at least the current 
level but the aim will continue to be the 
recruitment of the best candidate on merit 
regardless of gender. The Company’s policy 
on diversity applies across all levels of the 
Group, and further details on the approach 
to diversity are set out on page 29.
Focus during the year 
During the year, the Committee focused 
on the composition of the Board and, in 
doing so, it considered the tenure, mix and 
diversity of skills and experience of existing 
Board members and prospective Board 
members in the context of Group strategy. 
In its search for Non-executive Directors, 
the Board retained The Zygos Partnership, 
an independent executive search 
firm which does not have any other 
connections with the Company. The 
Committee agreed the process, timetable 
and mandate for the Zygos Partnership. 
Sabri Challah and Maria da Cunha were 
identified by the Nomination Committee 
as part of the external search process and 
were subsequently recommended to the 
Board for appointment on the basis that 
they met the criteria required, including 
having sufficient time to discharge the 
requirements of the role.
In reviewing succession planning and the 
composition of the Board the Committee 
made a recommendation for the 
appointment of Rupert Middleton, Chief 
Operating Officer as an Executive Director 
on the Board with effect from 23 July 2015. 
Rupert Middleton joined De La Rue 
in October 2011 and has extensive 
experience of manufacturing with a 
particular emphasis on printing. During his 
time with De La Rue Rupert Middleton has 
transformed the manufacturing function 
through implementation of an Operational 
Excellence programme.
The Committee retained an external search 
consultancy (Russell Reynolds) which 
does not have other connections with the 
Company for the search and appointment 
of a new Chief Financial Officer. Russell 
Reynolds was provided with a brief of the 
desired candidate profile based on merit 
and against objective criteria, and their 
services were used to conduct a search 
to identify suitable candidates. A list 
of potential candidates was assessed 
against these criteria and Jitesh Sodha 
was interviewed and his appointment 
was recommended to the Nomination 
Committee. The Board appointed Jitesh 
Sodha Chief Financial Officer with effect 
from 10 August 2015.

De La Rue’s ethical framework
As an organisation we are fully committed 
to ensuring that the highest ethical 
standards are embedded throughout 
our business.
The Group’s ethical framework is 
supported by the standards, policies 
and internal controls as shown above.
The Code of Business Principles (CBP) 
was reviewed recently and our nine core 
principles have not changed and continue 
to underpin the way in which we all 
conduct ourselves and work on a daily 
basis. Adhering to the CBP will ensure that 
we demonstrate complete integrity in the 
way we behave towards our customers, 
colleagues and business partners.
 
De La Rue is one of the founding members 
of the Banknote Ethics Initiative (BnEI) 
as reported on page 30. BnEI sets out 
a rigorous framework for promoting 
high ethical standards in the industry 
and requires members to commit to 
a Code of Ethical Business Practice 
that was developed in partnership 
with the Institute of Business Ethics. 
The initiative was established to promote 
ethical business practice, with a focus 
on the prevention of corruption and on 
compliance with anti-trust law within the 
banknote industry. Compliance with the 
code is rigorously tested through an audit 
framework developed in conjunction with 
GoodCorporation, recognised worldwide 
as a leading company in the field of 
corporate responsibility assurance and 
business ethics. Renewal of De La Rue’s 
accreditation in February 2016 will be 
followed by a full re-accreditation audit 
later in the year.

During the year to 26 March 2016 
the Committee focused on the 
following activities:
•  Reviewed the steps taken to implement a 
network of Ethics Champions throughout 
the Group
•  Proposed structure for the management 
of TPPs
• CBP activity update
•  Reviewed the Employee Engagement 
Survey results on perception of 
ethical behaviour
•  Reviewed the internal audit findings of 
the implementation of actions arising from

Audit Committee report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the 2016 Audit 
Committee report. This report describes 
the Committee’s ongoing responsibilities 
and key tasks as well as its major activities 
in the period ended 26 March 2016. 
Composition of the Committee

Maria da Cunha 23 July 2015
Andrew Stevens 2 January 2013
There has been significant change in the 
composition of the Committee in the year. 
Warren East stood down as Chair on his 
resignation from the Board at the AGM 
on 23 July 2015, and I took over as Chair 
at the next meeting in September 2015 
having previously been a member of the 
Committee since April 2010. Gill Rider also 
resigned from the Committee in July 2015 
when she left the Board. My thanks go to 
them for their contribution to the work of 
the Committee over the years.
Maria da Cunha and Sabri Challah joined 
the Committee in July 2015. All members 
of the Committee are Independent 
Non-executive Directors. The Board is 
satisfied that the membership of the Audit 
Committee meets the requirement for 
relevant and recent financial experience. 
I have continued with the practice under 
Warren East of inviting the Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, 
Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, Director of Audit, 
Risk and Assurance and the external and 
internal auditors to join meetings of the 
Committee. The Director of Audit, Risk 
and Assurance, who is the chief internal 
auditor, and external auditors each meet 
the Committee without Executive Directors 
or other employees being present. 
 
Role and responsibilities
The Audit Committee provides an 
independent overview of the effectiveness 
of the internal financial control systems and 
financial reporting processes. Its principal 
responsibilities are: 
•  The appointment of the external auditors 
including the agreement of the terms of 
engagement at the start of each audit, 
the audit scope and the external audit fee
•  Monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal financial controls 
and internal control and risk management 
systems and the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function
•  Reviewing the integrity of the interim 
and full year financial statements
•  Reviewing significant financial reporting 
issues and judgements contained in the 
financial statements
•  Reviewing and monitoring the external 
auditor’s effectiveness, independence 
and objectivity including the nature and 
appropriateness of any non-audit fees
•  Reviewing reports on the effectiveness 
of the Group’s whistleblowing procedures 
and arrangements, details of which are 
set out on page 31
•  Advising the Board on whether taken as 
a whole, the annual report is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy
The terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee are available on the 
Group’s website.

Significant accounting matters 
The Audit Committee is responsible for 
reviewing whether suitable accounting 
policies have been adopted and whether 
management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements in the preparation 
of the financial statements. In respect 
of the financial statements for the period 
ended 26 March 2016, the significant 
issues reviewed and how these issues 
were addressed is summarised below:
Accounting Treatment for the 
Cash Processing Systems (CPS)
During this financial year the Board 
decided to carry out a strategic review 
of the CPS business. 
The Board has considered a number 
of options for the CPS business. 
The Committee considered the accounting 
treatments of the most likely outcome 
of the review. The Committee received 
updates from the executive management 
team on progress against various options 
being considered. The Committee 
concluded, after enquiries of both the Chief 
Financial Officer and the external auditors, 
that for the purpose of the Annual Report 
the appropriate accounting treatment of 
the CPS business follows the requirements 
of IFRS 5 covering discontinued operations. 
Accordingly, the activities in the financial 
year for CPS are shown as a discontinued 
operation on the face of the profit and loss 
account. Notes 1 and 2 to the accounts 
provide sufficient information to gain an 
understanding of the impact of the CPS 
business. Prior year comparatives have 
also been restated where applicable. 
Revenue recognition in the Currency division
The Committee considered the Group’s 
revenue recognition and contract 
accounting policies and procedures 
to ensure that they remained appropriate 
and that the Group’s internal controls were 
operating effectively in this area. Feedback 
was also sought from the external auditors 
over the application of the revenue 
recognition policy including a specific 
review of shipments pre and post year end. 
Following a review of the varied sources 
of information received, the Committee 
concluded that the accounting treatments 
were reasonable and appropriate.
Post-retirement benefit obligations
The Committee received and considered 
reports from management and the external 
auditors in relation to the valuation of 
the defined benefit pension scheme and 
challenged the key actuarial assumptions 
used in calculating the scheme liabilities, 
especially in relation to discount 
rates, RPI inflation rates and mortality. 
The Committee discussed the reasons for 
the decrease in the net pension deficit and 
was satisfied that the assumptions used 
were appropriate and were supported 
by independent actuarial specialists. 
Details of the key assumptions used  
are set out in note 23.
Valuation of inventory in Currency 
The Committee reviewed the Group’s 
policies and procedures over the valuation 
and recoverability of inventory in Currency 
(£54.7m). The Committee received 
confirmation that the valuation principles 
had been consistently applied and noted 
that the majority of inventory items were 
made to order rather than held for generic 
stock and hence the recoverability risk was 
low. Accordingly, the Committee concluded 
that the accounting treatments were 
reasonable and appropriate.
Estimation of warranty provisions
The Group holds a number of provisions 
relating to warranties including present 
obligations for defective products and 
known claims as well as anticipated 
claims that had not been reported at 
the balance sheet date. The Committee 
reviewed and discussed reports from 
management and the external auditors 
concerning the significant provisions held 
for such matters including any provisions 
with notable movements. The Committee 
considered the background to such 
provisions and challenged management 
over the judgements applied in determining 
the value of provisions required. The 
Committee enquired of management and 
the external auditors as to the existence 
of other matters potentially requiring a 
provision to be made. The Committee 
concluded that it was satisfied with the 
value of warranty provisions carried.
Classification of exceptional items
As part of the Committee’s deliberations 
over whether the annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable, the Committee also 
considered the amounts disclosed as 
exceptional items. The nature of the items 
classified as operating exceptional items 
during the period is described in note 4. 
The Committee considered the accounting 
treatment and disclosure of these items 
in the financial statements including 
seeking the views of the external auditors. 
On the basis of this review, the Committee 
concluded that the accounting treatment 
and disclosures in relation to these items 
were appropriate. 51 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Strategic report Directors’ report Accounts
Independence and objectivity  
of external auditors
The Committee ensures that the external 
auditors (KPMG) remain independent of the 
Group. The Audit Committee has a detailed 
policy covering: 
•  Choosing the statutory auditors and 
approving the audit fee
• Commissioning non-audit work
•  Defining circumstances in which it is 
appropriate or inappropriate for incumbent 
auditors to be allowed to provide or be 
prohibited from providing non-audit work
•  De La Rue’ s procedures for procuring 
non-audit services from external sources, 
which specifically prohibits KPMG from 
undertaking certain types of service 
(including but not limited to services where 
it would audit its own work, where it would 
act in an advocacy role for the Group 
or where it would participate in activities 
normally undertaken by management) 
It may be cost effective for KPMG to 
perform certain non-audit services, in 
particular where the skills and experience 
required make KPMG the most suitable 
supplier. Certain categories of non-audit 
services, including corporation tax 
compliance and due diligence services 
must be subject to competitive tender 
unless it is justifiable in the circumstances 
not to do so. Areas which would not 
normally be acceptable non-audit services 
but in exceptional circumstances may 
be considered appropriate, such as 
litigation and compliance services, require 
my prior approval. The selection criteria 
include detailed proposals, timescales, 
local resource, cost and the safeguards 
put in place by KPMG to avoid conflicts 
of interest or loss of independence. 
In addition, the Group’s policy is for any 
individual assignment to be undertaken 
by KPMG where the fee is likely to be 
in excess of £50,000 to be approved 
by me prior to commencement of work. 
During 2015/16 the amount of non-audit 
fees paid to KPMG was £0.1m.
The safeguards KPMG put in place 
avoid compromising their objectivity 
and independence. They provide a written 
report to the Audit Committee on how they 
comply with professional and regulatory 
requirements and best practice designed 
to ensure their independence. Key 
members of the KPMG audit team rotate 
and the firm ensures, where appropriate, 
that confidentiality is maintained between 
different parts of the firm providing services 
to De La Rue.
Appointment of auditors
The Audit Committee assesses annually 
the qualification, expertise, resources and 
independence of the external auditors 
and the effectiveness of the audit process. 
The Audit Committee’s assessment 
is performed by an audit satisfaction 
questionnaire completed by the Chairman, 
relevant senior management and Audit 
Committee members. 
KPMG have been the Company’s auditors 
since 11 October 2006 following the last 
tender of the external audit. The Audit 
Committee considers that the relationship 
with the auditors is working well and 
remains satisfied with their effectiveness. 
During the year, the Audit Committee 
considered the tenure, performance and 
audit fees of the external auditors, and 
the level of non-audit work undertaken, 
and has not considered it necessary 
to date to require KPMG to re-tender 
for the audit work. Accordingly, the 
Committee recommended to the Board 
that a resolution for the re-appointment of 
KPMG for a further year as the Company’s 
auditors be proposed to shareholders 
at the AGM. 
The Committee acknowledges the 
recommendation in the new EU legislation 
and the report of the UK Competition and 
Markets Authority that the external audit 
contract should be put out to tender at 
least every 10 years. The Committee will 
keep under review the timing of its next 
tender process but does not currently 
intend that the audit will be put out 
to tender during 2016/17. 
The Audit Committee places great 
emphasis on the objectivity of the 
Company’s auditors, KPMG, in reporting 
to shareholders.
The KPMG audit partner is present 
at Audit Committee meetings to ensure 
communication of matters relating to 
the audit. The Audit Committee has 
discussions with the auditors, without 
management being present, on the 
adequacy of controls and on judgemental 
areas and receives and reviews 
the auditors’ highlights reports and 
management letters which are one of  
the main outputs from the external audit.
The scope and key focus of the 
forthcoming year’s audit is discussed with, 
and approved by, the Audit Committee. 
Internal control and risk management 
As noted above, the Committee is 
responsible for reviewing, on behalf 
of the Board, the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal financial controls and 
the assurance procedures relating to 
the Group’s risk management systems. 
These controls and procedures are 
designed to manage, but not eliminate, 
the risk of failure of the Group to meet its 
business objectives and, as such, provide 
reasonable but not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The key elements of the Group’s risk 
management framework and procedures 
are set out on page 14. The Committee 
reviews these topics at each meeting 
and considers that none of the areas 
identified for enhancement during the year 
constituted a significant failing or weakness 
for the Group.  52 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Internal audit 
Assurance over the design and operation 
of internal controls across the Group 
is provided through a combination of 
techniques. The Board through the Audit 
Committee monitors the effectiveness of 
internal control systems through reports 
received from the internal audit function 
during the period. The internal audit 
function has been outsourced since 
2009. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
have performed this role since the start 
of 2013/14. The Committee has asked 
the Director of Audit, Risk and Assurance 
to report back in 2016/17 as to whether 
the existing model continues to be fit 
for purpose or whether a new internal 
audit model should be implemented 
from 2017/18. 
Internal audit continued to ensure that 
their efforts were better aligned to the 
operational risks that the Group faces 
while maintaining an emphasis on 
reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness 
of general finance and IT controls across 
the Group on a cyclical basis. In addition 
to internal audit work, there is a system 
of self assessment internal control 
reviews by which management are 
required to detail and certify that controls 
are in operation to ensure the control 
environment in their business areas is 
appropriate. Actions agreed are followed 
up by senior management to ensure that 
satisfactory control is maintained. The 
internal audit plan is set and reviewed 
by the Audit Committee. Additionally, the 
Audit Committee reviews reports from the 
external auditors on internal control matters 
noted as part of their audit work.
The 2016/17 Internal Audit plan has been 
approved by the Committee in April 2016. 
The focus of the plan is to provide 
assurance that mitigating actions being 
taken against a number of the principal 
risks are proving effective.
 
Fair, balanced and understandable view
At its May 2016 meeting, the Committee 
reviewed the content of this Annual Report 
and accounts and advised the Board 
that, in its view, taken as a whole, it is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
In making its recommendation to the Board 
the Committee enhanced its robust existing 
governance arrangements by:
•  Comprehensive Group and subsidiary 
accounts process, with written 
confirmations provided by the business 
unit senior management teams on the 
health of the financial control environment
•  Reviews of the annual report undertaken 
at different levels of the Group and by 
the senior management team that aim 
to ensure consistency and overall balance
• External audit review
•  Clear guidance and instruction of the 
requirement provided to contributors
•  Written confirmation that information 
provided by executive management 
has been done so on a fair and 
balanced basis
•  Additional reviews by the Committee 
Chairman of the draft annual report in 
advance of the final sign-off in the context 
of the revised Code provision
Final sign-off is provided by the Board, 
on the recommendation of the Committee.

Dear Shareholder
As the recently appointed Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee, I am 
pleased to present the report on the work 
of the Committee during the period to 
26 March 2016. 
There has been significant change in the 
composition of the Committee in the year. 
Gill Rider stood down as Chair on her 
resignation from the Board at the AGM on 
23 July 2015, and I took over as Chair at the 
next meeting in October 2015. Warren East 
also resigned from the Committee in July 
2015 when he left the Board. My thanks  
go to them for their contribution to the 
work of the Committee over the past years. 
Maria da Cunha joined the Committee on 
joining the Board in July 2015. 
We regard the remuneration strategy 
as integral to our successful commercial 
strategy. We want to ensure that 
remuneration will support achievement 
of long term objectives, reward the 
right behaviours among our people and 
reinforce our desired culture. We aim to 
ensure that executive remuneration is fair 
and competitive and enables the Group 
to attract and retain the talented individuals 
needed to drive our strategy forward. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code) places great emphasis on 
ensuring that remuneration policies are 
designed to promote each company’s 
long term success. It also emphasises 
that arrangements should be in place to 
enable withholding or recovery of variable 
pay, when appropriate, as well as holding 
periods for deferred remuneration. I am 
confident that the relevant performance 
targets are in place to measure progress 
in delivering our plans and strategy and 
that the malus and clawback provisions 
are in line with best practice. We continue 
to keep the deferral and holding periods 
under review. 
The Committee’s overriding objective 
is to ensure that the Group’s executive 
remuneration policy encourages, reinforces 
and rewards the delivery of sustainable 
shareholder value. When considering 
remuneration for our senior executives, 
the Committee has used the policy 
framework approved by shareholders 
in July 2014 and takes into consideration 
reward across the whole Group, not just 
for the Executive Directors.
De La Rue’s strength lies in its relationships 
with central banks, governments and 
specialist commercial organisations. 
Our strategy is to be a professional and 
innovative leader in the markets in which 
we operate. In doing so we will ensure 
that employees are engaged, aligned 
to the strategy and fairly rewarded as part 
of the performance culture required to be 
a successful organisation. The successful 
execution of the strategy will provide 
shareholders with increasing value from 
each of our businesses and from the 
Group as a whole.
We are not proposing any changes to 
the remuneration policy for the year ahead. 
I am pleased to present our directors’ 
remuneration report for 2016, which sets 
out the amounts earned in respect of the  
period ended 26 March 2016 under the  
terms of the remuneration policy for 
Directors of De La Rue plc approved 
by shareholders in 2014.
Outcomes 2015/16
Annual Bonus Plan (ABP)
The maximum opportunity for Executive 
Directors under the ABP is 135% of salary 
for the Chief Executive Officer, 115% for 
the Chief Financial Officer and 100% of 
salary for the Chief Operating Officer. 
For 2015/16 the bonus opportunity was 
based on an element of personal objectives 
and financial measures including:
• Group revenue 
• Group underlying operating profit
• Group cash conversion 
No payment is made on any element 
of bonus (including the personal element) 
if a minimum operating profit threshold is 
not achieved. Full details are on page 58.
In light of the above structure and ABP 
measures, I am pleased to report that 
the ABP payout against the financial 
measures outlined above will be 41.6% 
of a maximum of 80% of entitlement. 
In this regard, during the year the 
Committee reviewed its stance with respect 
to the disclosure of annual bonus targets 
for Executive Directors. The previous policy 
of the Committee was ‘not to disclose 
specific targets while still commercially 
sensitive’. After full discussion, the 
Committee has agreed that, although we 
would continue not to disclose the specific 
targets for the year in which they operate 
(on a forward looking basis), the measures, 
weightings and the performance achieved 
for the year being reported on will be 
disclosed retrospectively. The outcomes 
for the financial measures that were used 
to determine the 2015/16 bonus are 
contained on page 58.

Annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 54 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Executive Directors did not receive 
awards under the PSP in 2013/14 and 
consequently none are due to vest in 2016.
Awards 2015
The Remuneration Committee made 
awards under the ABP and PSP in 2015 
and details of award levels and the 
performance conditions are on  
pages 58 to 60. 
Remuneration arrangements in 2015
This report is designed to demonstrate 
the link between the Group’s strategy, 
its operational performance, and the 
remuneration outcomes for our Executive 
Directors: Martin Sutherland, Chief 
Executive Officer, Rupert Middleton, 
Chief Operating Officer, and Jitesh Sodha, 
Chief Financial Officer.
The policy relating to the recruitment of 
Executive Directors in 2015 was used as 
the basis for determining the remuneration 
packages for Rupert Middleton and Jitesh 
Sodha. Rupert Middleton was appointed 
to the Board on 23 July 2015. Rupert is 
an internal appointment and his base salary 
was set at £320,000. The remuneration 
package that the Committee has put in 
place is in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy. On joining the Board 
on 10 August 2015, after an extensive 
search process, Jitesh Sodha’s base 
salary was set at £320,000. In line with 
best practice, the remuneration policy 
for Directors is that increases in salary 
for Executive Directors will not normally 
exceed the range of increases awarded 
to other employees in the Group except 
in circumstances listed in the binding 
policy. The exceptions include situations 
where an Executive Director took on 
increased responsibility. 
The business strategy has remained 
constant for the Group including 
the continuing drive to improve the 
efficiency of our operations. As a result, 
no changes have been made to the 
current remuneration arrangements 
and no changes are being proposed 
to the current policy at the forthcoming 
AGM. We continue to believe that our 
remuneration policy, which aligns executive 
rewards with shareholders’ interests and 
with our strategy, positions us to deliver the 
performance and long term success that 
the Board and shareholders expect.

Remuneration policy framework
The Remuneration Committee believes that performance-related pay and incentives should account for a significant proportion of 
the overall remuneration package of Executive Directors so that their remuneration is aligned with shareholder interests and the Group’s 
performance, without encouraging excessive risk taking. The overriding objective is to ensure that executive remuneration encourages, 
reinforces and rewards successful execution of strategy and provides shareholders with increasing value from each of our businesses 
and from the Group as a whole.
This section of the directors’ remuneration report gives information on directors’ remuneration and incentive out-turns for 2015/16, 
and details how the remuneration policy, set out on pages 66 to 73, will be applied in 2016/17.
The bar charts below show the total remuneration received by the Executive Directors against the range of potential remuneration as 
illustrated in the 2014 directors’ remuneration report (see page 73). The figures for Jitesh Sodha and Rupert Middleton include actual 
and potential total remuneration prorated for the period of their appointment as Executive Directors as appropriate.

Individual elements of remuneration
Base salary and fees
Base salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and are set with reference to individual 
performance, experience and responsibilities, Group performance, affordability and market competitiveness. An annual salary review 
was carried out by the Remuneration Committee on 18 May 2016. Following that review the Committee agreed an increase in salary 
for Martin Sutherland, Jitesh Sodha and Rupert Middleton for 2016/17 payable from 1 July 2016 as follows:

In line with best practice, the directors’ remuneration policy, approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, is that increases in salary 
for Executive Directors will not normally exceed the range of increases awarded to other employees in the Group except in the specific 
circumstances listed in the binding policy. 
The remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, is determined by the Board. Fees reflect the 
responsibilities and duties placed upon Non-executive Directors while also having regard to the market place. The Non-executive 
Directors do not participate in any of the Group’s share incentive plans nor do they receive any benefits or pension contributions. 
The Chairmen of the Remuneration Committee and Audit Committee and the Senior Independent Director received an additional fee 
of £8,000 to reflect their additional duties in 2015/16. Basic fees payable to Non-executive Directors were increased by 2% for 2016/17 
effective from 1 July 2016 and are as follows:
Non-executive Director fees
2016 
£’000
2015 
£’000
Basic fee 49 48
Additional fee for chairmanship of Audit and Remuneration Committees and Senior Independent Director 8 8
The Chairman will receive a fee of £190,250 with effect from 1 July 2016. 58 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Performance against targets (audited)
Annual Bonus
The annual bonus is delivered under the Annual Bonus Plan (ABP). 
ABP performance measures 2015/16
The ABP was operated on similar terms of structure, financial measures and weightings as in 2014/15. The bonus opportunity 
was based on an element of personal objectives (20%) and a number of financial performance metrics apportioned as follows:
• Group revenue (20%)
• Group underlying operating profit (40%)
• Group cash conversion (20%)
No payments will be made on any element of bonus (including the personal element) if a minimum operating profit threshold is not 
achieved. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to consider other factors, such as ethical behaviours, corporate responsibility, 
environment and health and safety matters as it sees fit when determining awards.
Annual bonus payments to Executive Directors have the following additional restrictions: Sixty per cent of the bonus opportunity 
is payable in cash with the remaining 40% deferred in shares. Half of the deferred shares will vest one year after the cash payout 
and the remaining half of the deferred shares will vest two years after the cash payout. There was no change to the maximum 
bonus opportunities for Executive Directors as described in the Directors’ remuneration policy table on page 67.
Disclosure of 2015/16 bonus targets
The target ranges for financial measures used to determine the 2015/16 bonus were not disclosed in last year’s Annual Report 
as this was considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive information. Last year’s report also stated that it was intended 
for retrospective disclosure to be made. The chart below sets out the financial measures and their weightings (inner circle) and 
the performance achieved against their maximum (outer circle) to determine the 2015/16 bonus. 
Following a review of achievement against personal objectives for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee concluded 
that of a 20% maximum opportunity:
• Martin Sutherland should receive a payment of 15% 
• Jitesh Sodha should receive a payment of 8% 
• Rupert Middleton should receive a payment of 15%
The 2015/16 cash bonus and deferred share element is detailed in the table below:

ABP 2016/17
The Remuneration Committee has determined that the bonus in respect of 2016/17 will be operated on similar terms of structure, 
financial measures and weightings as in 2015/16. The performance measures are appropriately weighted and incentivise the Executive 
Directors to achieve the desired outcomes without undue risk of focusing on any one financial measure. No payments will be made on 
any element of bonus (including the personal element) if a minimum operating profit threshold is not achieved. There will be no change 
to the maximum bonus opportunities for Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee considers that the annual bonus targets are 
commercially sensitive as they provide our competitors with insight into our business plans, expectations and our strategic actions and 
should therefore remain confidential to the Company. However, the Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how bonuses paid 
relate to the performance measures on a retrospective basis. A malus provision exists on deferred shares and since 2015 post-vesting 
clawback provisions will apply to the cash and share based elements.

Long term incentive – Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
The PSP is a share based long-term incentive aligned closely with interests of shareholders and business strategy through the 
performance measures chosen. The PSP is designed to provide Executive Directors and selected senior managers with a long-term 
incentive that promotes annual and long-term performance and reinforces alignment between participants and shareholders.
Executive Directors did not receive awards under the PSP in 2013/14 and consequently no awards are due to vest based on the 
2015/16 performance.
Performance measures applying to PSP awards in 2014/15 
The targets for awards made under the PSP in June 2014 were based on compound average growth in underlying EPS (75% of award) 
and average return on capital employed (ROCE) (25% of award) subject to the specific performance measures outlined below. Sixty per 
cent of an award will vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of grant and 40% will vest and become exercisable on the 
fourth anniversary of grant.
EPS was chosen because it is a key performance indicator for shareholders. ROCE supports the strategic focus on growth and margins 
through ensuring that cash is reinvested to generate appropriate returns. Award vesting levels will apply as follows:
Vesting % of EPS element of 
award for Executive Directors EPS growth
Threshold 25% 5%
Maximum 100% 10%
Vesting % of ROCE element of 
award for Executive Directors ROCE
Threshold 25% 40%
Maximum 100% 45%
The Remuneration Committee believes that the performance necessary to achieve awards is sufficiently stretching.
All awards are made as performance shares based on a percentage of salary and the value is divided by the average share price over a 
period before the date of grant in accordance with the rules of the PSP . In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that 
the vesting reflects the underlying performance of the Group and retains the flexibility to adjust the vesting amount to ensure it remains 
appropriate. Any adjustments will depend on the nature, timing and materiality of any contributory factors. The Remuneration Committee 
will disclose how the Group has performed against each of the performance metrics at the end of the 2016/17 performance period.
PSP awards made in June and September 2015 (audited)
Martin Sutherland and Jitesh Sodha received PSP awards in line with the directors’ remuneration policy as follows:
Number of 
shares awarded Date of award % of salary
Face value 
£’000
Vesting at threshold 
(as a % of maximum)

Martin Sutherland 85,675 29 June 2015 100 453 25 31 March 2018
Jitesh Sodha 67,092 23 September 2015 100 312 25 31 March 2018
All awards are made as performance shares based on a percentage of salary and the value is divided by the average share price over 
a five day period prior to the date of award, being 541.00p for the award on 29 June 2015 and 476.95p for the award on 23 September 
2015. Face value is the maximum number of shares that would vest multiplied by the share price (528.50p on 29 June 2015 and 
465.50p on 23 September 2015) at the date of grant. A clawback provision will apply pursuant to the Rules of the PSP . No payment is 
required at grant, vesting or exercise. The Remuneration Committee may add dividend shares accrued on vested shares over the period 
between the award date and the relevant vesting date. The performance measurements in respect of the PSP awards are shown below.
The award under the PSP to Rupert Middleton was made prior to his appointment to the Board and is therefore excluded from the 
table above, but the awards under the ABP and PSP held by Rupert Middleton are shown on page 62 and the performance conditions 
relating to the awards are shown in this report. 
Performance measures applying to PSP awards in 2015/16
Threshold vesting levels under the EPS and ROCE measures (outturn to be reported at the end of the 2017/18 period) will be as follows: 
Vesting % of EPS element of 
award for Executive Directors EPS growth
Threshold 25% 5% 
Maximum 100% 10%
Vesting % of ROCE element of 
award for Executive Directors ROCE
Threshold 25% 26%
Maximum 100% 32% 60 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Performance measures applying to PSP awards to be made in 2016/17
The Remuneration Committee has decided that the performance measurements, weighting and award vesting levels in respect  
of the PSP award in 2016 to Executive Directors will be as follows:
Vesting % of EPS element of 
award for Executive Directors EPS growth
Threshold 25% 5% 
Maximum 100% 10%
Vesting % of ROCE element of 
award for Executive Directors ROCE
Threshold 25% 30%
Maximum 100% 36%
EPS growth ensures any payout is supported by sound profitability. ROCE supports the strategic focus on growth and margins ensuring 
cash is reinvested to generate the appropriate returns. The vesting levels under ROCE have been adjusted to take account of the impact 
of a discontinued operation held for sale as described in note 2 to the financial statements. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied 
that the performance measures which are appropriately weighted support the Group’s strategy and business objectives.

During the year the Company made contributions to the defined contribution plan of £36,666 and his cash allowance was reduced by  
a corresponding amount. Pension contributions ceased on 29 February 2016 and the cash allowance reverted to 30% of his basic salary.

In accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement signed in connection with termination of his employment and in full and final 
settlement of claims brought or intimated against De La Rue plc, James Hussey, former CEO, was paid £372,829.40. The settlement 
in no way implies an acceptance of liability by De La Rue plc.
Remuneration for the former Chief Financial Officer
Colin Child stood down from the Board on 23 July 2015. He remained an employee of the Group until 8 September 2015 and continued 
to receive a salary, pension and benefits including holiday pay totalling £89,188 until the date of cessation of his employment to ensure 
a smooth change over. He did not receive a bonus payment in relation to his period as a Director or as an employee after he stood down 
from the Board. He also did not receive a PSP award in 2015. The award under the PSP in 2014 is subject to performance conditions 
as reported on page 59. 
External directorships of Executive Directors
The Board considers whether it is appropriate for an Executive Director to serve as a non-executive director of another company.  
As at the date of this report Executive Directors do not hold any non-executive directorships outside of the Group.
Share retention policy
The Remuneration Committee believes it is important that the interests of Executive Directors should be closely aligned with those of 
shareholders. The Committee has adopted a policy that Executive Directors should be encouraged to build up a shareholding over five 
years, equivalent to one times salary. This may be achieved either through market share purchases or retention of vested share awards. 
Executive Directors have started to build up a shareholding in line with the above policy as shown below.

This section of the report enables our remuneration arrangements to be seen in context by providing:
• De La Rue’s TSR performance for the seven years to 26 March 2016
• A history of De La Rue’s Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration for the current and previous six years 
•  A comparison of the year-on-year change in De La Rue’s Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration with the change in the average 
remuneration across the Group
• A year-on-year comparison of the total amount spent on pay across the Group with profit before tax and dividends paid
TSR performance
The graph below shows the value, at 26 March 2016, of £100 invested in De La Rue plc on 28 March 2009 compared with the value of 
£100 invested in the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts, assuming in each case the reinvestment of dividends. The other points 
plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends. The FTSE 250 has been chosen as it is the index of which De La Rue was a

importance of ensuring that shareholders continue to support the remuneration arrangements. All voting at the AGM is undertaken 
by poll.
Remuneration advice
The Remuneration Committee consults with the Chief Executive Officer on the remuneration of executives directly reporting to him and 
other senior executives and seeks to ensure a consistent approach across the Group taking account of seniority and market practice 
and the key remuneration policies outlined in this report. During 2015/16, the Committee also received advice from Towers Watson UK 
Limited (now named Willis Towers Watson following merger). Willis Towers Watson has been formally appointed by the Remuneration 
Committee and advised on executive remuneration levels and trends (including malus and clawback), directors’ remuneration report 
preparation and target setting for incentive plans. The Remuneration Committee requests Willis Towers Watson to attend meetings 
periodically during the year.
Willis Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and has signed up to the code of conduct relating to the 
provision of executive remuneration advice in the UK. In light of this, and the level and nature of the service received, the Committee 
remains satisfied that the advice has been objective and independent. 
Total fees for advice provided to the Remuneration Committee during the year by Willis Towers Watson were £18,000.
Dilution limits
The share incentives operated by the Company comply with the institutional investors’ share dilution guidelines.
The directors’ remuneration report was approved by the Board on 24 May 2016 and signed on its behalf.

risks to be taken
For 2014/15 the bonus opportunity will be based on an element of personal 
objectives and the following financial measures: 
• Group revenue 
• Group underlying operating profit 
• Group cash conversion

Remuneration policy framework
The Group’s remuneration policy aims to align the interests of the Executive Directors and other senior executives with those 
of shareholders. The overriding objective is to ensure that the Company’s executive remuneration policy encourages, reinforces 
and rewards the delivery of sustainable shareholder value. The Remuneration Committee believes that performance related pay 
and incentives should account for a significant proportion of the overall remuneration package of Executive Directors so that their 
remuneration is aligned with shareholder interests and the Group’s performance, without encouraging excessive risk taking. Performance 
related elements of remuneration therefore form a significant proportion of the total remuneration packages. The Committee believes that 
an effective remuneration strategy plays an essential part in the future success of the Group. 68 De La Rue Annual Report 2016

Annual share award with a three year performance period and 
performance metrics which, while challenging, will not encourage 
excessive risk taking
60% of the award vests after three years provided Group 
performance (two metrics) criteria are met and the balance will 
vest after a further one year subject to continued employment
The Remuneration Committee may add dividend shares accrued 
only on vested shares during the performance and extended 
vesting period 
The Remuneration Committee has the right to clawback any PSP 
awards within three years of an award vesting to the extent there 
has been misconduct, or a material misrepresentation in relation 
to the performance of the Company
Vesting of awards is subject to continued employment until the 
vesting date but, as described on page 72, PSP awards may also 
vest early in ‘good leaver’ circumstances
Awards under the PSP will vest early on a change of control 
(or other similar event) subject to satisfaction of the performance 
conditions and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines 
otherwise, pro-rating for time
The maximum number of shares which may be subject to an award granted to 
eligible employees in any financial year shall be an amount equal to such percentage, 
not exceeding 100% of salary as at the award date, as may be determined by 
the Remuneration Committee. The Committee retains discretion in exceptional 
circumstances to grant awards with a face value of up to 150% of salary
Awards will vest subject to the achievement of Group performance over a period 
of three years against key metrics set by the Remuneration Committee which 
are aligned to commercial business needs and strategy. For proposed awards 
in 2014/15, the vesting of PSP awards will be subject to EPS (compound 
average growth rate) and return on capital employed (ROCE) (absolute) 
performance conditions
At least 5% pa growth in EPS must be achieved for threshold vesting of 25% 
under the EPS performance measure with maximum vesting at 10% pa
A return of at least 40% must be achieved for threshold vesting of 25% under 
the ROCE performance measure with a maximum vesting of 100% at a return 
of 45%
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that vesting reflects the 
underlying performance of the Group and retains the flexibility to adjust 
the vesting amount to ensure it remains appropriate to the business 
performance achieved
The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the performance conditions 
and targets to ensure they continue to be aligned with the Group’s business 
objectives and strategy and retains the discretion to change the measures and 
their respective weightings to ensure continuing alignment with such objectives 
and strategy
The Remuneration Committee maintains the ability to adjust or set different 
performance measures if events occur or circumstances arise which cause 
the Committee to determine that the performance conditions have ceased to 
be appropriate. If varied or replaced, the amended performance conditions must, 
in the opinion of the Committee, be fair, reasonable and materially no more or 
less difficult than the original condition when set and these will be disclosed 
in the annual report on remuneration
PSP awards pre 2014/15 Same principle as above Awards vest after three years provided performance criteria met
Clawback provisions apply to awards from 10 July 2012
As above
As reported in the Group’s 2011 annual report and accounts the Committee 
exercised discretion, on an exceptional basis, and made share based awards in  
June 2011 under the PSP with a maximum face value on grant of 150% of salary
The performance measures and outturn for awards made in January 2011 and 
June 2011 are described on page 53 (2014 Annual Report)
The award in 2012 under the PSP is dependent on achievement of the following:
• Up to 75% of awards will vest subject to annual growth in EPS:
 – EPS>RPI + 12% pa will achieve 25% of maximum vesting
 – EPS>RPI + 15% pa will result in 100% of maximum vesting
• Up to 25% of award is based on average cash conversion over three years:
 – Cash conversion of 80% – 25% of maximum vesting
 – Cash conversion of 100% – 100% of maximum vesting
All employee share plans Encourage employees including the Executive Directors to build 
a shareholding through the operation of all employee share plans 
such as the HMRC approved De La Rue Sharesave scheme in the 
UK and the De La Rue US Employee Share Purchase Plan (‘ESPP’) 
established in the US under the Internal Revenue Code
Executive Directors may participate in the Sharesave scheme  
on the same terms as other employees
Under the UK Sharesave scheme, the option price may be 
discounted by up to 20%. Accumulated savings through payroll 
may be used to exercise an option to acquire shares
Under the ESPP , employees in the US may purchase the 
Company’s shares at a 15% discount to the market price. 
Purchases are funded through accumulated payroll deductions 
The maximum savings amount currently offered is £250 per month over a three or 
five year period under the Company’s Sharesave scheme. The rules of the scheme 
provide for savings up to the legislative limit of £500 per month
Under the ESPP , participants are eligible to save up to a monthly maximum of 10% 
of salary (US$25,000 per annum) to go towards the purchase of shares at the end  
of the offering period (currently one year)
No performance measures but employment conditions apply
Note
In addition to the specific provisions of this policy, the Company may also honour any pre-existing arrangements to make remuneration or loss of office payments to current 
and former Directors which remain at the time that this policy becomes effective (including the satisfaction of any outstanding awards of variable remuneration made to 
Executive Directors). Details of any such payments will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. 69 De La Rue Annual Report 2016

EPS growth ensures any payout is supported by sound profitability
ROCE supports the strategic focus on growth and margins through 
ensuring that cash is reinvested to generate appropriate returns 
Annual share award with a three year performance period and 
performance metrics which, while challenging, will not encourage 
excessive risk taking
60% of the award vests after three years provided Group 
performance (two metrics) criteria are met and the balance will 
vest after a further one year subject to continued employment
The Remuneration Committee may add dividend shares accrued 
only on vested shares during the performance and extended 
vesting period 
The Remuneration Committee has the right to clawback any PSP 
awards within three years of an award vesting to the extent there 
has been misconduct, or a material misrepresentation in relation 
to the performance of the Company
Vesting of awards is subject to continued employment until the 
vesting date but, as described on page 72, PSP awards may also 
vest early in ‘good leaver’ circumstances
Awards under the PSP will vest early on a change of control 
(or other similar event) subject to satisfaction of the performance 
conditions and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines 
otherwise, pro-rating for time
The maximum number of shares which may be subject to an award granted to 
eligible employees in any financial year shall be an amount equal to such percentage, 
not exceeding 100% of salary as at the award date, as may be determined by 
the Remuneration Committee. The Committee retains discretion in exceptional 
circumstances to grant awards with a face value of up to 150% of salary
Awards will vest subject to the achievement of Group performance over a period 
of three years against key metrics set by the Remuneration Committee which 
are aligned to commercial business needs and strategy. For proposed awards 
in 2014/15, the vesting of PSP awards will be subject to EPS (compound 
average growth rate) and return on capital employed (ROCE) (absolute) 
performance conditions
At least 5% pa growth in EPS must be achieved for threshold vesting of 25% 
under the EPS performance measure with maximum vesting at 10% pa
A return of at least 40% must be achieved for threshold vesting of 25% under 
the ROCE performance measure with a maximum vesting of 100% at a return 
of 45%
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that vesting reflects the 
underlying performance of the Group and retains the flexibility to adjust 
the vesting amount to ensure it remains appropriate to the business 
performance achieved
The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the performance conditions 
and targets to ensure they continue to be aligned with the Group’s business 
objectives and strategy and retains the discretion to change the measures and 
their respective weightings to ensure continuing alignment with such objectives 
and strategy
The Remuneration Committee maintains the ability to adjust or set different 
performance measures if events occur or circumstances arise which cause 
the Committee to determine that the performance conditions have ceased to 
be appropriate. If varied or replaced, the amended performance conditions must, 
in the opinion of the Committee, be fair, reasonable and materially no more or 
less difficult than the original condition when set and these will be disclosed 
in the annual report on remuneration
PSP awards pre 2014/15 Same principle as above Awards vest after three years provided performance criteria met
Clawback provisions apply to awards from 10 July 2012
As above
As reported in the Group’s 2011 annual report and accounts the Committee 
exercised discretion, on an exceptional basis, and made share based awards in  
June 2011 under the PSP with a maximum face value on grant of 150% of salary
The performance measures and outturn for awards made in January 2011 and 
June 2011 are described on page 53 (2014 Annual Report)
The award in 2012 under the PSP is dependent on achievement of the following:
• Up to 75% of awards will vest subject to annual growth in EPS:
 – EPS>RPI + 12% pa will achieve 25% of maximum vesting
 – EPS>RPI + 15% pa will result in 100% of maximum vesting
• Up to 25% of award is based on average cash conversion over three years:
 – Cash conversion of 80% – 25% of maximum vesting
 – Cash conversion of 100% – 100% of maximum vesting
All employee share plans Encourage employees including the Executive Directors to build 
a shareholding through the operation of all employee share plans 
such as the HMRC approved De La Rue Sharesave scheme in the 
UK and the De La Rue US Employee Share Purchase Plan (‘ESPP’) 
established in the US under the Internal Revenue Code
Executive Directors may participate in the Sharesave scheme  
on the same terms as other employees
Under the UK Sharesave scheme, the option price may be 
discounted by up to 20%. Accumulated savings through payroll 
may be used to exercise an option to acquire shares
Under the ESPP , employees in the US may purchase the 
Company’s shares at a 15% discount to the market price. 
Purchases are funded through accumulated payroll deductions 
The maximum savings amount currently offered is £250 per month over a three or 
five year period under the Company’s Sharesave scheme. The rules of the scheme 
provide for savings up to the legislative limit of £500 per month
Under the ESPP , participants are eligible to save up to a monthly maximum of 10% 
of salary (US$25,000 per annum) to go towards the purchase of shares at the end  
of the offering period (currently one year)
No performance measures but employment conditions apply
Note
In addition to the specific provisions of this policy, the Company may also honour any pre-existing arrangements to make remuneration or loss of office payments to current 
and former Directors which remain at the time that this policy becomes effective (including the satisfaction of any outstanding awards of variable remuneration made to 
Executive Directors). Details of any such payments will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise. 70 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Directors’ remuneration report 
continued
Directors’ remuneration policy  
continued
Remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-executive Directors
Element Operation by the Company
Chairman fees The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Remuneration Committee. Fees are set  
at a level which reflects the skills, knowledge and experience of the individual, while taking 
into account market data
Non-executive Director fees Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed for fixed 
terms of three years renewable for a further three years. Terms beyond this period 
are considered on a case by case basis 
The Board (excluding Non-executive Directors) is responsible for setting Non-executive 
Directors’ fees. Fees are structured as a basic fee for Board and Committee membership. 
Committee Chairmen and the Senior Independent Director receive an additional fee. 
Reasonable expenses for attending Board meetings are reimbursed by the Company  
and the Group may pay any tax due on such benefits
Fees paid to Non-executive Directors will remain within the limit set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association of £750,000 per annum
Non-executive Directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not 
participate in any of the Group’s annual incentive arrangements, or share option schemes. 
No compensation is payable to the Chairman or to any Non-executive Director if the 
appointment is terminated
Remuneration policy for new appointments
When considering the appointment of Executive Directors, the Committee balances the need to attract candidates of sufficient calibre 
while remaining mindful of the need to pay no more than necessary. The Committee will typically align the remuneration package with 
the above remuneration policy. Base salary may be set at a higher or lower level than previous incumbents. Where possible, salary may 
be set at an initially lower level with the intention of increasing it over the following two years dependent on performance in the role and 
experience gained. In certain circumstances, to facilitate the recruitment of individuals of the required calibre, incentive arrangements 
and awards may also be higher. The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to make payments or awards which are outside 
the policy to facilitate the recruitment of candidates of the appropriate calibre to implement the Group’s strategy. In addition, remuneration 
forfeited on resignation from a previous employer may be compensated. The form of this compensation would be considered on a case 
by case basis and may comprise either cash or shares. Generally (though not necessarily in all circumstances) the Committee will favour 
share awards with appropriately stretching performance targets attached and at a minimum expects that:
• If forfeited remuneration was in the form of shares, compensation will be in the form of shares 
•  If forfeited remuneration was subject to achievement of performance conditions, compensation will be subject to no less challenging 
performance conditions 
• The timing of any compensation will, where practicable, match the vesting schedule of the remuneration forfeited
A newly appointed Executive Director may be provided with reasonable relocation support.
Internal appointments will receive a remuneration package that is consistent with the remuneration policy. Legacy terms and conditions 
would be honoured, including pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards.
Subject to the limit on additional maximum variable remuneration set out below, incentive awards may be granted within the first 
12 months of appointment above the maximum award opportunities set out in the policy table above. Excluding payments or awards 
to compensate for remuneration forfeited on resignation from a previous employer, the maximum level of variable remuneration which 
may be awarded to a new Executive Director, above the maximum levels set out in the policy table above, is one times base salary. 
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that variable remuneration is linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging 
performance measures and will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not met.
Fees payable to a newly appointed Chairman or Non-executive Director will be in line with the fee policy in place at the time of appointment.
In the absence of a Chief Executive Officer interim arrangements were put in place. Philip Rogerson, Chairman, assumed executive 
responsibilities until a new Chief Executive Officer joined the Board and he was supported by Colin Child, Chief Financial Officer, who 
was appointed Chief Operating Officer on a similar temporary basis. In order to reflect the additional time commitment Philip Rogerson 
was paid an additional fee of £297,500 per annum, to take effect from 1 April 2014, to be pro-rated for so long as he continued 
in this role. 
  71 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Strategic report Directors’ report Accounts
Pay policy for other employees
When determining the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration 
the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group. In particular, the Committee is kept informed of:
• Salary increases for the general employee population
• Overall spend on annual bonus
• Participation levels in the ABP
The remuneration policy applied to the Executive Leadership Team and the most senior executives in the Group is similar to the policy 
for the Executive Directors in that a significant element of remuneration is dependent on Group and individual performance. The key 
principles of the remuneration are applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of seniority and local market 
practice. The Group aims to offer competitive levels of remuneration, benefits and incentives to attract and retain employees. The 
Remuneration Committee consults with the Chief Executive Officer on the remuneration of executives directly reporting to him and other 
senior executives and seeks to ensure a consistent approach across the Group taking account of seniority and market practice and the 
key remuneration policies outlined above. On authority of the Committee, the Chief Executive Officer has discretion to make awards to 
a limited number of employees not being Executive Directors or Executive Leadership members.
All UK employees may join the Company’s HMRC approved Sharesave scheme. Options are granted over De La Rue plc shares, at an 
exercise price equal to 80% of the prevailing market share price at the time of grant. Eligible US employees may participate in the ESPP . 
The purchase price is 85% of the lower of the market value of a De La Rue plc share either at the beginning or end of the offering period.
The Remuneration Committee considered that it would be impractical to consult with employees when drawing up the remuneration policy.
Shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee engages in regular dialogue with shareholders to discuss and take feedback on its remuneration 
policy and governance matters. In particular, the Committee discusses any significant changes to the policy. The Committee consulted 
De La Rue’s largest UK shareholders, the main investors outside the UK and the main UK institutional investor bodies on the proposals 
for the redesign of the ABP and the PSP . The Committee welcomes an open dialogue with shareholders and intends to continue to 
consult with major shareholders before implementing any significant change to the Executive Director remuneration policy.
Service contracts
The Board’s policy for current and new Executive Directors is that service contracts are one year rolling contracts with a notice period 
that should not exceed one year. 
The Remuneration Committee recognises that in the case of appointments to the Board from outside the Group, it may be necessary 
to offer a longer initial notice period, which would subsequently reduce to 12 months after that initial period.
Non-executive Directors
Philip Rogerson, Chairman, was initially appointed as a Non-executive Director and Chairman designate on 1 March 2012. 
All Directors offer themselves for annual re-election at each AGM in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. Service 
contracts for Executive Directors and letters of appointment for Non-executive Directors are available for inspection at the registered 
office address of the Company.
  72 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Payment for loss of office 
In determining compensation for early termination of a service contract, the Remuneration Committee carefully considers the specific 
circumstances, the Company’s commitments under the individual’s contract and the individual’s obligation to mitigate loss. The table 
below outlines the framework for contracts for Executive Directors. Should additional compensation matters arise, such as a settlement 
or compromise agreement, the Remuneration Committee will exercise judgement and will take into account the specific commercial 
circumstances.
Policy
Notice period on termination 
by the Company
12 calendar months. The Remuneration Committee recognises that in the case of appointment to the 
Board from outside the Group, it may be necessary to offer a longer initial notice period, which would 
subsequently reduce to 12 months after that initial period
Termination payment at the 
Company’s sole discretion
On termination on notice by either the Company or the relevant Executive, the Company retains the 
discretion to make a payment in lieu of notice not exceeding 12 months’ basic salary, excluding bonus 
but including benefits in kind (including company car or car allowance and private health insurance) and 
pension contributions (which may include salary supplement)
Benefits provided in connection with termination payments may also include, but are not limited to, 
outplacement and legal fees
Change of control Under the ABP , share awards will vest in full on change of control. Awards under the PSP will vest early 
on a change of control (or other similar event) subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions and, 
unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, pro-rating for time
Vesting of incentives 
for leavers
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to determine appropriate bonus amounts taking 
into consideration the circumstances in which an Executive Director leaves. Typically for ‘good leavers’, 
bonus amounts (as estimated by the Remuneration Committee) will be pro-rated for time in service 
to termination and will be subject to performance, paid at the usual time 
The vesting of share awards is governed by the rules of the appropriate incentive plan approved 
by shareholders. Typically for ‘good leavers’:
•  Under the ABP the provisions allow awards to vest in full at the normal vesting date or earlier at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee
•  Under the PSP , awards, pro-rated (unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise) 
to the date of departure, will vest at the normal vesting date if the relevant performance targets have 
been met unless the Remuneration Committee decides to test the performance targets early and 
accelerate vesting
•  Good leavers under the Sharesave scheme, which is HMRC approved, are entitled to exercise options, 
pro-rata to the savings made
•  If awards are made on recruitment the treatment on leaving would be determined at the time at the 
Remuneration Committee’s discretion in accordance with the relevant plan rules
Pension benefits Will be paid in accordance with the rules of the pension scheme. Where an early retirement pension 
is paid from a legacy UK defined benefit arrangement, a reduction will be made to the pension to reflect 
early receipt using factors determined and set by the Trustees from time to time

Report of Directors
Introduction
De La Rue plc is incorporated as a public 
limited company, is registered in England 
and Wales under the Companies Act 
1985 with registered number 3834125 
and has its registered office at De La Rue 
House, Jays Close, Viables, Basingstoke, 
Hampshire, RG22 4BS.
The Directors of the Company are required 
to produce a directors’ report on an 
annual basis under the Companies Act. 
The Directors are also required under 
the Companies Act to publish a strategic 
report for the Group and the Company. 
The directors’ strategic report must:
•  Contain a fair review of the Company’s 
business and a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing  
the business 
•  Be a balanced and comprehensive 
analysis of the development and 
performance of the Company’s business 
at the end of that year, consistent with 
the size and complexity of its business
This section of the annual report sets out 
the information required to be disclosed 
by the Company and the Group in the 
directors’ report. Certain matters that 
would otherwise be disclosed in this 
directors’ report have been reported 
elsewhere in this annual report and 
consequently this directors’ report should 
be read in conjunction with the strategic 
report on pages 1 to 33 and the corporate 
governance report for 2016 on pages 34 
to 52, which are incorporated by reference 
into this directors’ report.
The Strategic report and this Directors’ 
report together with other sections 
of this Annual Report incorporated by 
reference, when taken as a whole, form 
the management report as required for the 
purposes of Disclosure and Transparency 
Rule 4.1.5R. The management report for 
2016 has been prepared and presented 
in accordance with and in reliance upon 
applicable English law and the liabilities 
of the Directors in connection with this 
report shall be subject to the limitations 
and restrictions provided under such law.
Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe 
harbour limits the liability of Directors in 
respect of statements in and omissions 
from the strategic report and the directors’ 
report. Under English law, the Directors 
would be liable to the Company, but not to 
any third party, if the strategic report or the 
directors’ report contains errors as a result 
of recklessness or knowing misstatement 
or dishonest concealment of a material 
fact, but would not otherwise be liable.

Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting (AGM) will be 
held at 10:30am on Thursday 21 July 2016 
at The Hampshire Court Hotel, Centre 
Drive, Great Binfields Road, Chineham, 
Basingstoke, RG24 8FY. The notice of 
the AGM accompanies this annual report.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 8.3p was paid on 
6 January 2016 in respect of the half year 
ended 26 September 2015.The Board is 
recommending a final dividend of 16.7p per 
share, making a total for the year of 25.0p 
per share (2014/15: 25.0p per share). 
Dividend details are given in note 8 to the 
financial statements. Subject to approval of 
shareholders at the AGM on 21 July 2016, 
the final dividend will be paid on 3 August 
2016 to those shareholders on the register 
on 24 June 2016. 
Post balance sheet events
Details of post balance sheet events 
are reported in note 28 to the financial 
statements. 75 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Strategic report Directors’ report Accounts
Share capital 
As at 26 March 2016, there were 
101,358,815 ordinary shares of 44
152
/175p 
each and 111,673,300 deferred shares 
of 1p each in issue.
Deferred shares carry limited economic 
rights and no voting rights. They are not 
transferable except in accordance with 
the articles of association. 
The ordinary shares are listed on the 
London Stock Exchange.
Power to issue and allot 
At the AGM in 2015, authority was 
given to the Directors to allot new 
ordinary shares up to a nominal value of 
£30,251,454 equivalent to two-thirds of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company providing that, consistent with 
the Investment Association’s guidelines, 
any amount in excess of one third of the 
existing issued shares should be applied 
to fully pre-emptive rights only.
The Companies Act 2006 requires that 
any shares issued wholly for cash must 
be offered to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their existing holdings unless 
authorised to the contrary by a resolution 
of the shareholders. A special resolution 
was passed at the 2015 AGM to affect a 
disapplication of pre-emption rights up to 
the maximum nominal value of £4,537,718 
representing approximately 10% of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company. This disapplication authority is in 
line with institutional shareholder guidance, 
and in particular with the Pre-emption 
Group’s Statement of Principles which 
were revised in 2015 to allow the authority 
for an issue of shares for cash (otherwise 
than in connection with a pre-emptive offer) 
to be increased from 5% to 10% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
provided that the Company confirms that 
it intends to use the additional 5% authority 
only in connection with an acquisition or 
specified capital investment. Authorities to 
renew for one year the power of Directors 
to allot shares without regard to the 
pre-emption provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 will be sought from shareholders 
at the AGM. 
Details of shares issued during the year 
and outstanding options are given in notes 
19 and 20 on pages 110 to 113 which 
form part of this report. Details of the share 
incentives in place are provided on pages 57 
to 59 of the Directors’ remuneration report.
Authority to purchase own shares
At the 2015 AGM, the Company was 
authorised by its shareholders to purchase 
up to 10,113,356 of its own ordinary 
shares representing 10% of its issued 
ordinary share capital either for cancellation 
or to be held in treasury (or a combination 
of these). No purchases have been made 
pursuant to this authority and a resolution 
will be put to shareholders at the AGM 
to renew the authority for a further period 
of one year.
Rights and restrictions on shares 
and transfers of shares
Certain restrictions, which are customary 
for a listed company, apply to the rights 
and transfers of shares in the Company. 
The rights and obligations attaching to 
the Company’s ordinary and deferred 
shares, in addition to those conferred 
on their holders by law, are set out in the 
Company’s articles of association, copies 
of which can be obtained from Companies 
House in the UK or the Group’s website 
www.delarue.com. The key points are 
summarised below.
Ordinary shares
Notices of meetings must be given 
to every shareholder and to any person 
entitled to a share unless the articles of 
association or the rights of the shares say 
they are not entitled to receive them from 
the Company. The Board can decide that 
only people who are entered on the register 
of members at the close of business on 
a particular day are entitled to receive the 
notice. On a show of hands, each holder 
of shares present in person and entitled 
to vote has one vote and, upon a poll, 
each such holder who is present in person 
or by proxy and entitled to vote has one 
vote for every share held. Electronic and 
paper proxy appointments, and voting 
instructions, must be received by the 
Company’s Registrar no later than  
48 hours before a general meeting.
Dividends and distributions to shareholders 
on winding up 
Holders of ordinary shares may receive 
interim dividends approved by Directors 
and dividends declared in general 
meetings. On a liquidation and subject 
to a special resolution of the Company 
the liquidator may divide among members 
in specie the whole or any part of the 
assets of the Company and may, for 
such purpose, value any assets and 
may determine how such division shall 
be carried out.
 
Transfers of shares
The Company’s articles of association 
place no restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares or on the exercise of 
voting rights attached to them except: 
(ï) in very limited circumstances (such 
as a transfer to more than four persons), 
(ii) where the Company has exercised its 
rights to suspend their voting rights or to 
prohibit their transfer following the omission 
by their holder or any person interested 
in them to provide the Company with 
information requested by it in accordance 
with part 22 of the Companies Act 2006, 
or (iii) where the holder is precluded from 
exercising rights by the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s (FCA) Listing Rules, the City 
Code on Takeovers and Mergers or any 
other regulations.
Dealings subject to the Model Code  
of the Listing Rules
Pursuant to the Listing Rules of the FCA, 
Directors and other persons discharging 
managerial responsibilities and certain 
employees require the approval of the 
Company to deal in the ordinary shares 
of the Company. The Group will develop 
its policies to take account of the new 
EU Market Abuse Regulation effective 
3 July 2016.
Exercise of rights of shares in employee 
share schemes
Awards held by relevant participants under 
the Company’s various share plans carry 
no voting rights until the shares are issued. 
The Trustee of the De La Rue Employee 
Share Ownership Trust does not seek to 
exercise voting rights on existing shares 
held in the employee trust. No shares are 
currently held in trust.
Shareholder agreements and consent 
requirements
There are no known arrangements under 
which financial rights carried by any of 
the shares in the Company are held by 
a person other than holders of the shares 
and no known agreements between 
the holders of shares with restrictions 
on the transfer of shares or exercise 
of voting rights.

Directors
The names of the Directors who held office 
during the year are set out on pages 35 to 
37 and changes in the membership of the 
Board are summarised on page 40 of the 
corporate governance report. Details of 
Directors’ remuneration are provided in the 
directors’ remuneration report on pages 
53 to 73. The interests of the Directors 
and their families in the share capital of 
the Company are shown on page 61 of 
the directors’ remuneration report which

Powers of Directors
Subject to the Company’s articles and 
any directions given by the Company in 
general meeting by a special resolution, 
the business of the Company is managed 
by the Board which may exercise all the 
powers of the Company, whether relating 
to the management of the business of the 
Company or not. The powers of the Board 
are described in the corporate governance 
report on pages 34 to 43.
Conflicts of interests
The Board has established a process to 
review at least annually and, if appropriate, 
authorise any conflict of interest and has 
carried out such a review during the year 
and authorised all Directors’ situational 
conflicts. Any transactional conflicts are 
reviewed as they arise. Directors are asked 
to review and confirm reported conflicts of 
interests as part of the year end process.
 
Indemnity
To the extent permitted by the Companies 
Act 2006 and the FCA Listing Rules the 
Group indemnifies certain officers so that 
the Group may advance defence costs 
in civil or regulatory proceedings on such 
terms as the Board may reasonably 
determine but any advance must be 
refunded if the Director or officer is 
subsequently convicted. The indemnities 
were in force during the financial period 
and remain in force at the date of this 
report. The indemnity will not provide cover 
where the Director or officer has acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly. The Group also 
maintains directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance cover for its Directors and 
officers. This cover extends to directors 
of subsidiary companies.
Change of control 
Contracts
There are a number of contracts which 
allow the counterparties to alter or terminate 
those arrangements in the event of a 
change of control of the Company. These 
arrangements are commercially sensitive 
and confidential and their disclosure could 
be seriously prejudicial to the Group.
Banking facilities
The £250m credit facility between the 
Company and its key relationship banks 
contains a provision such that, in the event 
of a change of control, any lender may, if it 
so requires, notify the agent that it wishes 
to cancel its commitment whereupon the 
commitment of that lender will be cancelled 
and all its outstanding loans, together with 
accrued interest, will become immediately 
due and payable.
Employee share plans
In the event of a change of control, 
automatic vesting would occur in 
accordance with the relevant scheme 
or plan rules.
 
Political donations
The Group’s policy is not to make any 
political donations and none were made 
during the period. The Company will 
propose to shareholders at this year’s AGM 
that the precautionary authority granted at 
the 2015 AGM, pursuant to the Companies 
Act 2006, be renewed and details are 
included in the notice of meeting.
Essential contracts or other 
arrangements
The Group has a number of suppliers of key 
components, the loss of which could disrupt 
the Group’s ability to deliver on time and in 
full. See more details on pages 14 to 17.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the annual report and the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of 
Ireland, and applicable law. 
Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and Parent Company and of their profit 
or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
•  Select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently
•  Make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent
•  For the Group financial statements, 
state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU
•  For the Parent Company financial 
statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the Parent Company financial statements
•  Prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Parent Company will continue 
in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company and Group’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Parent 
Company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a strategic report, directors’ 
report, directors’ remuneration report 
and corporate governance statement that 
comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on 
the Group’s website. Legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
 
Directors’ responsibility statement 
Each of the persons who is a Director at 
the date of approval of this report confirms 
that to the best of his or her knowledge:
•  The Group financial statements, 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole
•  The Strategic report on pages 1 to 33 
and the Directors’ report on pages 
34 to 77 include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face; and
•  The Annual Report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy
The Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report were approved by the Board 
on 24 May 2016.

Opinion and conclusions arising from our audit
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of De La Rue plc for the period ended 26 March 2016 set on pages 81 to 126. In our opinion:
•  The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 26 March 2016 
and of the Group’s profit for the period then ended
•  The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union
•  The Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
•  The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, 
in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition 
and its inclusion in the 
appropriate period for the 
Currency division – £353.3 
million (2015: £317.9 
million) Risk vs 2015: tu
Refer to pages 50 
(Audit Committee report), 
88 (accounting policy) and 
89 (financial disclosures)
Reflecting the specialist nature of the Currency 
division’s products, many customer contracts 
include specific terms that impact the timing  
of revenue recognition on those contracts.  
For example, a number of customer contracts 
have complex acceptance conditions and some 
allow for ‘bill and hold’ arrangements where 
the customer asks the division to store finished 
products on its behalf. Due to these contractual 
complexities there is a risk that revenue may 
be misstated
In this area our procedures include reading significant new contracts to obtain  
an understanding of contract terms, and in particular those relevant to the timing  
of revenue recognition, testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls 
designed to ensure that revenue is recognised in the correct accounting period and 
testing of specific  revenue transactions recorded before and after the year end
To test revenue recognition on contracts with complex acceptance conditions we  
obtain appropriate evidence of customer acceptance on a sample basis. In relation 
to revenue recorded under ‘bill and hold’ transactions we evaluate the underlying 
contractual arrangements and obtain third party documentation that demonstrates  
when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer
We also assess the adequacy of the Group’s disclosure about significant judgements 
in relation to revenue recognition
Valuation of inventory in 
the Currency Division – 
£54.7 million (2015: £42.7 
million) Risk vs 2015: tu
Refer to pages 50 
(Audit Committee report), 
88 (accounting policy) and 
99 (financial disclosures)
At the balance date the Group has significant 
inventory, including work in progress on customer 
banknote orders. Production of banknote paper, 
printed banknotes and other security products is  
a complex process reflecting the tight specifications 
set by customers and the many embedded security 
features which are often bespoke to each product
Accordingly, there is a risk that work in progress 
will fail quality control checks at a later stage in 
production and need to be scrapped or reworked. 
The Group provides for this through allowances 
based on past experience and known issues but 
there is a risk that this allowance will be misstated
Finished goods inventory is valued at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. Due to the bespoke 
nature of each product, fluctuations in production 
efficiency and spoilage rates could affect the 
allocated cost and carrying amount of inventory
In this area our procedures include testing the Group’s controls over the  
determination of inventory allowances, considering historical experience and  
assessing the appropriateness of estimates used in light of current manufacturing  
quality. We also consider the adequacy of the Group’s allowances for specific issues  
by reference to current and recent customer complaints
In performing the above procedures we assess information obtained from the quality 
control and sales functions in relation to quality performance levels and overall customer 
satisfaction respectively to identify possible emerging trends
In addition, procedures include testing of the approach to the allocation of costs to 
work in progress and finished goods inventory and assessing the net realisable value 
by reference to the selling prices relevant for each product
We also assess the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in relation to the significant 
judgements in relation to the carrying value of inventory including work in progress
Estimation of warranty 
provisions- £5.9 million 
(2015: £18.8 million) 
Risk vs 2015: tu
Refer to pages 50 
(Audit Committee report), 
88 (accounting policy) and 
110 (financial disclosures)
As noted above, the Group’s products are 
complex and produced to exacting standards. 
Product quality issues can be identified 
subsequent to delivery to customers.  
Accordingly, at any point in time the Group  
may be in dialogue with customers over  
potential product quality issues
The Group holds provisions for the potential 
costs associated with these risks. The 
assumptions underpinning these provisions 
are inherently uncertain
In relation to provisions for specific known issues, our procedures include challenging 
the basis of the Group’s calculations by reference to the Group’s risk assessment, the 
status of discussions with the relevant customer (determined by inspecting relevant 
correspondence) and the cost estimates for rectification work. In performing these 
procedures we have regard to past experience in addressing such matters
In relation to unidentified issues, we assess and challenge the Group’s methodology for 
determining the level of provision required taking into account the key assumptions such 
as historical accuracy of provisioning, the levels of expense incurred over time together 
with current information on product quality experience.
We also assess the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in relation to the significant 
judgements in relation to warranty provisioning and related contingent liabilities, if relevant
Classification of 
exceptional items –  
£29.6 million (2015: £18.8 
million) Risk vs 2015: q
Refer to pages 50 
(Audit Committee report), 
88 (accounting policy) 
and 92 to 93 (financial 
disclosures)
The Group discloses separately ‘exceptional 
items’ which the directors consider to be items 
of income or expenses which are important to 
identify to shareholders to aid their understanding 
of the ‘underlying’ business performance 
Determining which items should or should not 
be disclosed as exceptional is judgemental.
Accordingly, there is a risk that inappropriate 
selection and disclosure of exceptional items may 
result in the Group not meeting its’ objective of 
giving a view of company performance that is fair, 
balanced and understandable
In his area our procedures include assessing the basis of the Group’s determination 
of exceptional items as compared with their accounting policy and past practice and 
considering whether the amounts so classified have been disclosed appropriately and 
consistently with due regard to the need to be balanced
Based on our understanding of the Group’s activities and results of the business for the 
period, we assess the classification of items as exceptional and challenge whether any 
additional items should be disclosed as exceptional
We also assess the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures around the exceptional items, 
especially announced restructuring activity, and the basis of selection of exceptional items
Independent auditor’s report to the members of De La Rue plc 79 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Strategic report Directors’ report Accounts
The risk Our response
Presentation as 
discontinued operation 
and related asset held 
for sale treatment – 
£31.0 million result of 
discontinued operations 
and £11.2 million asset 
and £10.5 million liabilities 
held for sale (New risk)
Refer to pages 50 
(Audit Committee report), 
88 (accounting policy) and 
91 (financial disclosures)
The Group has presented the Cash Processing 
Systems business as a discontinued operation 
in the income statement and as a disposal 
group held for sale within the balance sheet. 
These accounting treatments require specific 
conditions to be met and judgements made at the 
balances sheet date around the identification and 
measurement of assets. There are also detailed 
related disclosure requirements
In this area our procedures include assessing whether the underlying facts and 
circumstances support the accounting treatment adopted. This involved reading 
of minutes and other relevant supporting documentation as well as discussions with 
management and their external advisors. In performing these procedures we considered 
whether assets and liabilities presented as held for sale have been accurately identified 
and appropriately measured
We also assess the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in relation to these matters
Post-retirement benefits 
– £219.9 million (2015: 
£236.7 million) Risk vs 
2015: tu 
Refer to pages 50 
(Audit Committee report), 
88 (accounting policy) and 
115 (financial disclosures)
The Group has material defined benefit pension 
schemes. Small changes in the assumptions 
and estimates used to value the Group’s 
post-retirement benefit obligations would have 
a significant effect on the financial position of 
the Group
In this area our procedures include assessing the membership data provided to support 
triennial valuations and testing of asset valuations used in determining the net deficit
In addition, with the support of our own actuarial specialists, we challenge the key 
assumptions used to determine the Group’s net deficit, which are the discount rate, 
inflation rate and mortality/life expectancy. This includes a comparison of these key 
assumptions against externally derived data
We also consider the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of the sensitivity 
of the deficit to these assumptions
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £2.3 million (2015: £2.5 million), determined with reference to 
a benchmark of Group profit before tax (from continuing and discontinued operations), normalised to remove the impact of separately 
identified exceptional items (as disclosed in notes 2 and 4 of the financial statements) of which it represents 3.9% (2015: 4.3%). 
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £115,000 (2015: £125,000), 
in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 70 (2015: 70) reporting components, we subjected 12 (2015: 12) to audits for group reporting purposes and six 
(2015: seven) to specified, risk-focused, audit procedures.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group’s results (including continuing 
operations and discontinued operations held for sale).
Group revenue
 Audit for group reporting purposes 80% (2015: 76%) 
 Specified risk focused audit procedures 9% (2015: 11%) 
 Subject to Group level analytical procedures 11% (2015: 13%) 
Group profit before tax*
 Audit for group reporting purposes 84% (2015: 83%) 
 Specified risk focused audit procedures 8% (2015: 4%) 
 Subject to Group level analytical procedures 8% (2015: 13%)
*normalised to remove the impact of separately identified and audited exceptional items.

Range of materiality applied 
to component audits

Misstatements reported  
to the Audit Committee 80 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
The components for which we performed specified risk-focused audit procedures were not individually financial significant enough to 
require an audit for group reporting purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed. For the remaining 
components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks 
of material misstatement within these. 
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved the component materiality levels used, which ranged 
from £0.1 million to £1.8 million (2015: £0.1 million to £2.0 million), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across 
the components. The work on six of the 18 components (2015: six of the 19 components) was performed by component auditors and 
the rest by the Group audit team. 
The Group audit team visited three (2015: five) component locations in the UK (2015: in the UK and Malta), including to assess the  
audit risk and strategy. Telephone conference meetings and remote file reviews were held with all component auditors. At these visits 
and meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group 
audit team was then performed by the component auditor.
Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion:
• The part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006
•  The information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial period for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements 
We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
•  The directors’ statement of longer term viability on pages 15 to 17 concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based 
on that, the directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation over the three years to March 2019; or
• The disclosures on page 86 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting
We have nothing to report in respect of matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, 
a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
•  We have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ statement that 
they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides  
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
•  The report of the Audit Committee report on pages 49 to 52 does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the  
Audit Committee
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
•  The Parent Company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement  
with the accounting records and returns; or
• Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• The Directors’ statement, set out on page 86 and 17 in relation to going concern and longer term viability
•  The part of the corporate governance report on pages 34 to 47 relating to the Company’s compliance with the eleven provisions  
of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 77, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of 
financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made

Share premium account
This reserve arises from the issuance of shares for consideration in excess of their nominal value.
Capital redemption reserve
This reserve represents the nominal value of shares redeemed by the Company.
Hedge reserve
This reserve records the portion of any gain or loss on hedging instruments that are determined to be effective cash flow hedges. 
When the hedged transaction occurs, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is transferred out of equity to the income statement. 
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss on the related hedging instrument previously recognised in 
equity is transferred to the income statement. 
Cumulative translation adjustment
This reserve records cumulative exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign entities since 
transition to IFRS. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are recycled to the income 
statement. This reserve also records the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.
Other reserve
On 1 February 2000, the Company issued and credited as fully paid 191,646,873 ordinary shares of 25p each and paid cash of 
£103.7m to acquire the issued share capital of De La Rue plc (now De La Rue Holdings Limited), following the approval of a High Court 
Scheme of Arrangement. In exchange for every 20 ordinary shares in De La Rue plc, shareholders received 17 ordinary shares plus 
920p in cash. The other reserve of £83.8m arose as a result of this transaction and is a permanent adjustment to the consolidated 
financial statements.

Group cash flow statement
for the period ended 26 March 2016 86 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
The Company
De La Rue plc (the Company) is a 
public limited company incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom. 
The address of its registered office is 
disclosed on page 128 of this Annual Report. 
The consolidated financial statements 
of the Company for the period ended 
26 March 2016 comprise the Company 
and its subsidiaries (together referred 
to as the Group) and the Group’s interest 
in associates. The Company financial 
statements present information about 
the Company as a separate entity and 
not about its Group. The principal activities 
of the Group are described in note 1. 
Statement of compliance
European Union (EU) law (IAS Regulation 
EC 1606/2002) requires that the 
consolidated financial statements, for the 
period ended 26 March 2016, be prepared 
in accordance with international financial 
reporting standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the EU. These consolidated financial 
statements have been approved by the 
Directors and prepared in accordance with 
IFRS including interpretations issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention with the exception of 
certain items which are measured at 
fair value as disclosed in the accounting 
policies below. The accounts have been 
prepared as at 26 March 2016, being the 
last Saturday in March. The comparatives 
for the 2014/15 financial period are for 
the period ended 28 March 2015.
The Company has elected to prepare its 
financial statements in accordance with 
FRS 102 Financial Reporting Standard 
applicable in the UK and Republic of 
Ireland. This period is the first period 
that the financial statements have been 
prepared under FRS 102. They are set out 
on pages 122 to 126 and the accounting 
policies in respect of the Company financial 
statements are set out on page 124.
The principal accounting policies adopted 
in the preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements are set out below or 
have been incorporated with the relevant 
notes to the accounts where appropriate. 
These policies have been consistently 
applied to all the periods presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
 
During the period a number of 
amendments to IFRS became effective 
and were adopted by the Group, none 
of which had a material impact on the 
Group’s net cash flows, financial position, 
total comprehensive income or earnings 
per share.
A number of other new and amended 
IFRS were issued during the period, 
which do not become effective until after 
27 March 2016. IFRS 15 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers (effective for 
the year ending 30 March 2019, not yet 
endorsed by the EU) provides a single, 
principles based, five step model to be 
applied to all sales contracts. Based on 
a provisional assessment, IFRS 15 is not 
expected to have a significant impact on 
the timing of revenue recognition in the 
Group. The group will continue to assess 
the impact during 2016/17. Otherwise, 
none of the new or amended IFRSs are 
expected to have a material impact on 
the Group for the 2016/17 period. 
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out on pages 4 to 33 of the 
Strategic report. In addition, pages 101 
to 107 include the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for financial risk 
management, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities 
and its exposure to credit risk, liquidity 
risk and commodity pricing risk. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described on page 26 of 
the Strategic report. 
The Group meets its funding requirements 
through cash generated from operations 
and a revolving credit facility which expires 
in December 2019. The Group’s forecasts 
and projections, which cover a period of 
more than 12 months, taking into account 
reasonably possible changes in normal 
trading performance, show that the 
Group should be able to operate within its 
currently available facilities. The Group has 
sufficient financial resources together with 
assets that are expected to generate cash 
flow in the normal course of business. 
 
As a consequence and notwithstanding 
the net liability position being reported 
in the consolidated balance sheet, 
which has primarily arisen due to the 
value of the deficit in the retirement 
benefit obligations, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group are well placed to manage 
their business risks and to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the Directors continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and accounts.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements 
incorporate the financial statements of 
the Company and entities controlled 
by the Company (its subsidiaries) up to 
26 March 2016. Control exists when the 
Group has the power to direct the activities 
of an entity so as to affect the return on 
investment. The results of subsidiaries 
acquired or disposed of during the period 
are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control 
commences or until the date that control 
ceases. The majority of the subsidiaries 
prepare their financial statements up 
to 26 March.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary 
are measured at their fair values at the 
date of acquisition. Any excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the fair values 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of 
the cost of acquisition below the fair values 
of the identifiable net assets acquired 
(ie discount on acquisition) is credited 
to the income statement in the period of 
acquisition. Where necessary, adjustments 
are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used 
by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated 
on consolidation. 
 
Accounting policies 87 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Strategic report Directors’ report Accounts
Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies adopted 
in the preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements have been incorporated 
into the relevant notes where possible. 
General accounting policies which are not 
specific to an accounting note, for example 
foreign exchange, are set out below.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
These financial statements are presented 
in sterling, which is the functional and 
presentational currency of the Company. 
The functional currency of Group entities 
is principally determined by the primary 
economic environment in which the 
respective entity operates. 
Transactions in foreign currencies entered 
into by Group entities are translated into 
the functional currencies of those entities 
at the rates of exchange at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the 
balance sheet date are translated at the 
rate of exchange ruling at that date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency non-monetary items 
measured in terms of historical cost are 
translated at the rate of exchange at 
the date of the transaction. Exchange 
differences on non-monetary items are 
recognised in line with whether the gain 
or loss on the non-monetary item itself 
is recognised in the income statement 
or in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain 
foreign exchange risks, the Group enters 
into forward contracts (refer to note 13 
for details of the Group’s accounting 
policies in respect of such derivative 
financial instruments).
Financial statements of foreign operations
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations, 
including goodwill and intangible assets, 
are translated at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Income and expenses are translated 
at average exchange rates (which 
approximate to actual rates). Exchange 
differences arising on re-translation are 
recognised in the Group’s translation 
reserve, which is a component of equity. 
When a foreign operation is sold, exchange 
differences that were recorded in equity are 
recognised in the income statement as part 
of the gain or loss on sale.
Exchange differences in respect of 
foreign operations that arose before 
27 March 2004, the date of transition to 
Adopted IFRS, are presented as part of 
retained earnings, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Net investment in foreign operations
Foreign currency differences arising 
on the re-translation of a financial liability 
designated as a hedge of a net investment 
in foreign operations are recognised in 
the translation reserve to the extent the 
hedge is effective. To the extent that the 
hedge is ineffective, such differences are 
recognised as finance income or costs in 
the income statement. Cumulative gains 
or losses in equity arising since the date 
of transition to Adopted IFRS are taken 
to the income statement on disposal 
of the foreign operation.
Revenue recognition
Group revenue predominantly represents 
sales to external customers of 
manufactured products which fall within 
the Group’s ordinary trading activities. 
This excludes VAT and other sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised in the income 
statement to the extent that it is probable 
that the economic benefits associated 
with the transaction will flow into the Group 
and the amount can be reliably measured. 
In practice, the timing of the transfer of 
risks and rewards varies depending on 
the individual terms of the sales agreement. 
For sales of products and associated 
components, when sold separately, 
the transfer usually occurs on loading 
the goods onto the relevant carrier or, 
at an earlier point in time when conditions 
are met for recognition of revenue on a bill 
and hold basis.
Revenue is recognised on a bill and hold 
basis when a formal contract is in place, 
the product is in hand and ready for 
delivery, the customer has acknowledged 
acceptance of the bill and hold transaction 
and normal payment terms apply.
Revenue on service based contracts 
is recognised as services are provided. 
If the services under a single arrangement 
are rendered in different reporting periods, 
or under an arrangement that also includes 
the sale of goods, then the consideration 
is allocated on a relative fair value basis 
between the sale of goods and rendering 
of services and then allocated to the 
appropriate reporting periods in accordance 
with the transfer of risks and rewards and 
the contractual life of the service contract. 
Revenues and costs on a small number 
of project based contracts are recognised 
by reference to the stage of completion, 
based on the work performed to date 
and the overall contract profitability. 
The assessment of the stage of completion 
is dependent on the nature of the contract 
and is assessed by reference to reviews 
of work performed, achievement of 
contractual milestones and costs incurred.
Classification of assets held for sale 
and discontinued operations
Following a root and branch review of 
the cash processing systems operation 
(CPS), the Board concluded that whilst 
CPS has a good product profile and long 
term customer relationships, it does not 
believe that this is a business which should 
form part of the Group’s portfolio and 
decided to exit this market. In line with 
the requirements of IFRS 5, where the 
carrying value of an asset will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use, the disposal 
group has been classified as an asset 
held for sale on the balance sheet and 
the segment as a discontinued operation. 
This treatment has been made with regard 
to the requirement for any disposal group 
to be immediately available for sale, the 
sale should be probable and expected to 
be completed within the next 12 months.
  88 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Critical accounting judgements and  
key sources of estimation uncertainty
Management has discussed with the Audit 
Committee the development, selection and 
disclosure of the Group’ s critical accounting 
policies and estimates and the application of 
these policies and estimates. Management 
is required to exercise significant judgement 
in the application of these policies. 
Estimates are made in many areas and the 
outcome may differ from that calculated. 
The key assumptions concerning the 
future and other key sources of estimation 
uncertainty at the balance sheet date that 
have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are set out below.
Revenue recognition and cut-off in Currency 
Customer contracts within the Currency 
business will often include specific 
terms that impact the timing of revenue 
recognition. The timing of the transfer 
of risks and rewards varies depending on 
the individual terms of the sales agreement. 
For sales of products and associated 
components, when sold separately, 
the transfer usually occurs on loading 
the goods onto the relevant carrier or, 
at an earlier point in time when conditions 
are met for recognition of revenue on a 
bill and hold basis. Judgement is used 
in interpreting these terms and conditions 
in assessing when the risks and rewards 
have been transferred to the customer 
especially where they include complex 
acceptance criteria. 
Valuation of inventory in Currency
At any point in time, the Group has 
significant levels of inventory, including 
work in progress. Currency manufacturing 
is a complex process and the final product 
is required to be made to exacting 
specifications and tolerance levels. 
In valuing the work in progress at the 
balance sheet date, assessments are 
made over the level of waste contained 
within the product based on the production 
performance to date and past experience. 
In assessing the recoverability of finished 
stock assessments are made to validate 
that inventory is correctly stated at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value 
and that obsolete inventory, including 
inventory in excess of requirements, 
is provided against.
Classification of exceptional items
The Directors consider items of income 
and expenditure which are both material 
by size and/or by nature and non-recurring 
should be disclosed separately in the 
financial statements so as to help provide 
an indication of the Group’s underlying 
business performance. The Directors label 
these items collectively as ‘exceptional 
items’. Determining which transactions 
are to be considered exceptional in nature 
is often a subjective matter. However, 
circumstances that the Directors believe 
would give rise to exceptional items for 
separate disclosure would include: gains 
or losses on the disposal of businesses 
(other than those within the scope of IFRS 5), 
curtailments on defined benefit pension 
arrangements, restructuring of businesses 
and asset impairments. All exceptional items 
are included in the appropriate income 
statement category to which they relate.
Post-retirement benefit obligations
Pension costs within the income statement 
and the pension obligations as stated in 
the balance sheet are both dependent 
upon a number of assumptions chosen by 
management. These include the rate used 
to discount future liabilities, the expected 
longevity for current and future pensioners 
and estimates of future rates of inflation.
The discount rate is the interest rate that 
should be used to determine the present 
value of estimated future cash outflows 
expected to be required to settle the 
pension obligations. In determining the 
appropriate discount rate, the Group 
considers the interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated 
in the currency in which the benefits will 
be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related 
pension liability. See page 116 for detail 
of the relative sensitivity of the value of 
the scheme liabilities to changes in the 
discount and inflation rates. 
Estimation of warranty provisions
The Group measures warranty provisions 
at the Directors’ best estimate of the 
amount required to settle the obligation at 
the balance sheet date, discounted where 
the time value of money is considered 
material. These estimates take account of 
available information, historical experience 
and the likelihood of different possible 
outcomes. Both the amount and the 
maturity of these liabilities could be different 
from those estimated.
Presentation of disposal group held for sale
The Directors have exercised judgement 
in assessing whether the criteria for 
recognising a disposal group as held 
for sale were met in respect of the CPS 
business at the year end, including whether 
a sale was considered highly probable. 
Further judgement was required in 
estimating fair value less costs to sell when 
determining the remeasurement of assets 
and liabilities within the disposal group 
based on the lower of the carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell. 
Other accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions
Tax
The Group is subject to income taxes 
in numerous jurisdictions and significant 
judgement is required in determining the 
worldwide provision for those taxes. The 
level of current and deferred tax recognised 
is dependent on subjective judgements as 
to the outcome of decisions to be made 
by the tax authorities in the various tax 
jurisdictions around the world in which 
the Group operates. It is necessary to 
consider which deferred tax assets should 
be recognised based on an assessment 
of the extent to which they are regarded 
as recoverable, which involves assessment 
of the future trading prospects of individual 
statutory entities. The actual outcome 
may vary from that anticipated. Where the 
final tax outcomes differ from the amounts 
initially recorded, there will be impacts upon 
income tax and deferred tax provisions and 
on the income statement in the period in 
which such determination is made.

1 Segmental analysis
The continuing operations of the Group have three main operating units: Currency, Identity Solutions and Product Authentication and 
Traceability. The Board, which is the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, monitors the performance of the Group at this level and 
there are therefore three reportable segments. The principal financial information reviewed by the Board is revenue and underlying 
operating profit, measured on an IFRS basis.
The Group’s segments are:
• Currency – provides printed banknotes, banknote paper and polymer substrates and banknote security components
• Identity Solutions – involved in the provision of passport, ePassport, national ID and eID, driving licence and voter registration schemes
•  Product Authentication and Traceability (previously Security Products) – produces security documents, including authentication labels, 
brand licensing products, government documents, cheques and postage stamps 
Inter-segmental transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. 
Discontinued operations – The Cash Processing Solutions operation, primarily focused on the production of large banknote sorters  
and authentication machines for central banks, has been classified as a disposal group held for sale (see Note 2).

2 Discontinued operation held for sale
The Cash Processing Solutions business (‘CPS’) is presented as a disposal group held for sale following the conclusion of a  
root and branch review. The Board concluded that whilst CPS has a good product profile and long term customer relationships,  
it does not believe that this is a business which should form part of the Group’s portfolio and has therefore decided to exit this market. 
This will enable the continuing Group to focus on its core business and future growth areas, as well as allow CPS to achieve its full 
potential under new dedicated ownership.
The CPS assets and liabilities that the group planned to dispose of were transferred into the disposal group at their carrying value. 
A charge of £23.4m arising on the remeasurement of the disposal group to the lower of the carrying amount and its fair value less 
costs to sell has been recognised in exceptional items. This has been applied first to non-current assets and then to inventory within 
the disposal group.
In line with IFRS 5 no remeasurement has been applied to financial assets. The fair value reflects the anticipated sales price to be 
achieved upon completion.
No UK pension liability will transfer as part of the disposal group.

Asset impairments of £23.4m arising on the remeasurement of the disposal group to fair value less costs to sell have been recognised. 
The impairment relates to intangibles of £1.6m, goodwill of £4.0m and inventories of £17.8m. 
The cash costs for exceptional items in the period was £1.0m (2014/15: £1.7m).

Accumulated foreign currency translation gains and losses within the disposal group held for sale
The Group has accumulated foreign currency translation gains and losses in relation to the entities included within the disposal group. 
IAS 21 requires recycling of these foreign currency translation gains or losses, which have previously been taken direct to reserves, 
through the income statement at the point of disposal. At 26 March 2016 these foreign exchange gains or losses have not been recycled.
Subsequent to the year end the disposal of the CPS business has been completed (see note 28).

Site relocation and restructuring costs in 2015/16 were £9.2m net (2014/15: £2.8m net). Restructuring costs were incurred as part of 
the redesign of the organisation structure and the optimisation of manufacturing capabilities including the impact of the manufacturing 
footprint review which will reduce our core banknote print production capacity from eight billion to six billion notes a year, excluding the 
site managed on behalf of Bank of England.
The £9.2m net exceptional operating charge in respect of site relocation and restructuring (2014/15: £2.8m) comprised £8.4m 
(2014/15: £2.8m) in staff compensation, £1.0m (2014/15: £1.9m) for site exit costs offset by credits on existing provisions of £0.2m 
(2014/15: £1.2m) in staff compensation and £nil (2014/15: £0.7m) for site exit costs. The £9.2m charge was split between the operating 
segments as follows: Currency £8.7m, Product Authentication and Traceability £0.5m.
The sale of surplus land in Overton generated a profit of £9.5m while surplus warranty provisions of £1.3m, previously charged 
as exceptional items due to being significant one-off claims (2014/15: £3.0m) were released in the period. 
Following a review of capitalised assets, £5.2m of tangible assets within the Currency segment were written down representing assets 
linked with specific products whose future income streams are forecast to be insufficient to support the current carrying value.
The net cash cost of exceptional items for continuing operations in the period was £12.5m. £17.6m of cash cost of exceptional items 
related to prior periods and predominantly reflected the settlement of the invocation of guarantees provided for as an adjusting post 
balance sheet event in 2014/15. 
In addition the following exceptional items were incurred in the prior year: £13.3m of charges in relation to the invocation of guarantees 
and £3.8m write off on first generation software within the Product Authentication and Traceability segment.
Tax credits relating to continuing exceptional items arising in the period were £1.8m (2014/15 £2.4m). In addition there was an exceptional 
credit of £0.5m (2014/15: £nil) in respect of the determination of the tax treatment of a prior year exceptional restructuring item.  94 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
5 Interest income and expense
Interest income/expense is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset/liability to the net 
carrying amount of that asset/liability.

All finance income and expense arises in respect of assets and liabilities not restated to fair value through the income statement.
The gain to the income statement in respect of the ineffective portion of derivative financial instruments was £nil (2014/15: £nil).
6 Taxation
The tax expense included in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the 
taxable income for the year, including adjustments in respect of prior periods, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, 
in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, or result from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit 
nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where 
the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are only offset to the extent that there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
assets and current tax liabilities, they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current 
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise an asset and settle a liability simultaneously.

7 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted for the impact of the dilutive effect 
of share options. 
The Directors are of the opinion that the publication of the underlying earnings per share, before exceptional items, is useful to readers 
of the accounts as it gives an indication of underlying business performance.

9 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or valuation, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated provision for 
impairment in value. Assets in the course of construction are included in property, plant and equipment on the basis of expenditure 
incurred at the balance sheet date.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated over their estimated useful 
economic lives of 50 years. Other leasehold interests are depreciated over the lesser of the unexpired period of the lease and 50 years.
The Group’s policy is to write off the cost or valuation of all other plant and equipment evenly over their estimated remaining useful 
life at rates which vary between 4 per cent and 50 per cent per annum. The principal annual rate of depreciation used is 10 per cent 
on plant and machinery and on fixtures and fittings. No depreciation is provided for assets in the course of construction.
Depreciation methods, residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end, taking into account 
commercial and technical obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, provision being made where the carrying value exceeds 
the recoverable amount. 
Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised 
as part of the specific asset.

10 Intangible assets
All intangible assets, except goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination over the 
Group’s share of the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the business acquired at the date of acquisition. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is not amortised and is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. At the date of 
acquisition, the goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment 
or when there are indications of impairment. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business. Goodwill arising on 
the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented in goodwill, and goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is presented in investments 
in associates. Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 27 March 2004 
(the date of transition to IFRS) has been retained at the previous amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Intangible assets purchased separately, such as software licences that do not form an integral part of related hardware, are capitalised 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Software intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over the 
shorter of their useful economic life or their licence period at rates which vary between three and five years. Expenditure incurred in 
the development of products or enhancements to existing product ranges is capitalised as an intangible asset only when the future 
economic benefits expected to arise are deemed probable and the costs can be reliably measured. Development costs not meeting 
these criteria are expensed in the income statement as incurred. Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight line basis 
over their estimated useful economic lives, which vary between five and ten years, once the product or enhancement is available for use. 
Product research costs are written off as incurred.
Distribution rights are capitalised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses and are amortised over their useful 
economic lives as determined by the life of the products to which they relate.

Impairment testing
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount 
is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet ready for use, the recoverable amount 
is estimated at each reporting date.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. In addition, goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. Impairment tests are performed for all Cash 
Generating Units (CGUs) to which goodwill has been allocated at the balance sheet date or whenever there is indication of impairment. 
For all other intangible assets, an impairment test is performed whenever an indicator of impairment exists.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the latter being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use and, in the case of goodwill, 
is not subsequently reversed. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
For other intangible assets, at each balance sheet date an assessment is made to determine whether there is any indication that 
an impairment loss recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or has decreased. Where such an indication exists, an impairment 
loss is reversed to the extent that the asset’s carrying value does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, 
net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Development costs with a carrying value of £1.6m 
have been transferred to assets held for sale to be included within the disposal group. See note 2 for further details.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs identified according to business segment and country of operation.
The £4.0m (2014/15: £3.7m) of goodwill relates to the acquisition of CSI Inc, a provider of cash processing systems, in 2001. 
This goodwill has been transferred to assets held for sale to be included within the disposal group. See note 2 for further details.
With regards to development costs in the table above, ‘disposals’ relate to decisions taken by the Board during the year to cease 
continuing with the development of particular products or features, resulting in a write-off of the costs capitalised up to the decision date. 
‘Impairment’ relates to developed products where an assessment has been performed, based on the policy set out below, at the year end 
that identifies that the carrying value is in excess of the recoverable amount, leading to an impairment charge needing to be recorded. 
11 Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average 
cost basis and comprises directly attributable purchase and conversion costs, including direct labour and an allocation of production 
overheads based on normal operating capacity that have been incurred in bringing those inventories to their present location and 
condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and selling costs.

The provision for impairment in respect of trade receivables is used to record losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery  
of the amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the financial asset directly.

Balance at end of year (3.5) (3.8)
Amounts can go past due before collection in situations where the customer may have raised queries over contractual compliance. 
Such issues arise in the normal course of business and are routinely addressed to the satisfaction of the customer. The Group believes 
that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on historic payment behaviour 
and analysis of customer credit risk, including underlying customers’ credit ratings if they are available.

13 Financial risk
Financial risk management
Overview
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk.
The Group’s financial risk management policies are established and reviewed regularly to identify and analyse the risks faced by  
the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The use of financial derivatives  
is governed by the Group’s risk management policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the  
use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. The Group’s treasury department is responsible  
for the management of these financial risks faced by the Group.
Group treasury identifies, evaluates and in certain cases hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s operating units. 
Group treasury provides written principles for overall financial risk management as well as policies covering specific areas, such as 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities where due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash 
equivalents. The level of headroom needed is reviewed annually as part of the Group’s planning process. 
A maturity analysis of the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings is shown below in the reporting of financial risk section together 
with associated fair values.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income 
or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The Group uses a range of derivative instruments, including forward contracts and 
swaps to hedge its risk to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates with the objective of controlling market risk exposures 
within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. Derivative financial instruments are only used for hedging purposes.
(a) Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with 
respect to the US dollar and the euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, 
unrecognised firm commitments and investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in 
the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group treasury. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions 
or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. Group treasury is responsible 
for managing the net position in each currency via foreign exchange contracts transacted with financial institutions.
The Group’s risk management policy aims to hedge firm commitments in full, and between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast 
exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months to the extent that forecast transactions are highly probable.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. The Group’s 
policy is to manage the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations primarily through borrowings 
denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
The Group’s policy is not to hedge net investments in subsidiaries or the translation of profits or losses generated in overseas subsidiaries.
(b) Interest rate risk
All material financial assets and liabilities are maintained at floating rates of interest. Where the Group has forecast average levels of 
net debt above £50m on a continuing basis, the policy is to use floating to fixed interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on a minimum 
of 50 per cent of the Group’s forecast average levels of net debt for a period of at least 12 months.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the 
Group’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on 
credit risk. Geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk. Where appropriate, letters of credit are used to mitigate the credit risk 
from customers.
The Group has established a credit policy that ensures that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit 
history. The Group has a policy to procure advance payments during order negotiation which further reduces credit risk. Derivative 
counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions and the Group has policies that limit the 
amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. 102 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
13 Financial risk continued
Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The gain or loss on subsequent fair value measurement is recognised  
in the income statement unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting when recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends  
on the nature of the item being hedged. 
Cash flow hedges 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and are effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in 
equity are recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement. However, if the 
hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts accumulated in equity on the hedging instrument 
are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. Hedge accounting is discontinued 
when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, for 
forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is 
transferred to the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Fair value hedges 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, 
the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in net income. 
Gains or losses from remeasuring the derivative or, for non-derivatives, the foreign currency component of its carrying value, are 
recognised in net income.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when 
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value. 
Any unrealised gains or losses on such separated derivatives are reported in the income statement within revenue or operating expenses 
in line with the host contract.

Fair value measurement basis for derivative financial instruments
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest 
at the reporting date. The valuation bases are classified according to the degree of estimation required in arriving at the fair values. Level 1 
valuations are derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, level 2 valuations use observable 
inputs for the assets or liabilities other than quoted prices, while level 3 valuations are not based on observable market data and are 
subject to management estimates. There has been no movement between levels during the current or prior periods.

Forward exchange contracts used for hedging
The fair value of forward exchange contracts has been determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps
Interest rate swaps are measured by reference to third party bank confirmations and discounted cash flows using the yield curves 
in effect at the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives
The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated based on the present value of forecast future exposures on relevant sales and 
purchase contracts and using quoted forward foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Determination of fair values of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities
Non-derivative financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest, 
are recognised in profit or loss. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Non-derivative financial 
assets not classified as at fair value through profit or loss are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective 
evidence of impairment. 
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Hedge reserves
The hedge reserve balance on 26 March 2016 was £2.3m, 28 March 2015: (£3.5m). Net movements in the hedge reserve are shown 
in the Group statement of changes in equity. 
Comprehensive income after tax was £5.8m comprising a loss of £4.1m of fair value movements on new and continuing cash flow 
hedges, a loss of £1.5m on maturing cash flow hedges for capital expenditure and a £1.6m charge to the income statement to match 
the recognition of the related cash flows in effective cash flow hedge relationships. Deferred tax on the net loss of £7.2m amounted 
to £1.4m. £0.1m of the (£1.4m) operating expense relates to discontinued operations.

The Group has a revolving credit facility of £250m which matures in December 2019. The covenants require that the ratio of EBIT to  
net interest payable be greater than four times and the net debt to EBITDA ratio be less than three times. At the year end the specific 
bank covenant tests were as follows: EBIT/net interest payable of 12.9 times, net debt/EBITDA of 1.25 times.
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables, bank loans and overdrafts, trade payables and other current liabilities 
have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.
As at 26 March 2016, the Group has a total of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, all maturing in more than one year,  
of £106.0m (28 March 2015: £110.1m in more than one year). The amount of loans drawn on the £250.0m facility is £144.0m  
(28 March 2015: £139.9m). Guarantees of £nil (28 March 2015: £nil) have been drawn using the facility.

to the income statement at various dates between one month and 30 months from the balance sheet date. 
Short duration swap contracts
(i) Cash management swaps
The Group uses short duration currency swaps to manage the level of borrowings in foreign currencies. The fair value of cash 
management currency swaps at 26 March 2016 was £nil (2014/15: £nil). Gains and losses on cash management swaps are included 
in the consolidated income statement.
The principal amounts outstanding under cash management currency swaps at 26 March 2016 are US dollar 34.0m, euro 4.0m, 
Swiss franc (6.8m), South African rand 10.0m, Australian dollar (1.4m), Japanese yen (1.2bn) and Canadian dollar 0.1m.
(ii) Balance sheet swaps

Embedded derivatives
Embedded derivatives relate to sales and purchase contracts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the 
customer/supplier, or a currency that is not deemed to be a commonly used currency of the country in which the customer/supplier 
is based. The net fair value of embedded derivatives at 26 March 2016 was £7.5m (2014/15: £1.0m).
Gains and losses on fair value hedges
The gains and losses recognised in the year on the Group’s fair value hedges were (£0.1m) relating to balance sheet hedges  
(2014/15: (£0.1m)), (£2.2m) relating to other fair value hedges (2014/15: £3.8m), and £nil relating to cash management hedges

Fair value adjustment to credit risk on derivative contracts
The impact of credit related adjustments being made to the carrying amount of derivatives measured at fair value and used for hedging 
currency and interest rate risk has been assessed and considered to be immaterial. These derivatives are transacted with investment 
grade financial institutions. Similarly, the impact of the credit risk of the Group on the valuation of its financial liabilities has been assessed 
and considered to be immaterial.
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business. 
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, which represent the Group’s definition of capital 
for this purpose.

Net debt 21 106.1 111.0

The long term pension deficit has been removed as a separate agreement is in place regarding the funding for this deficit which is paid 
out of cash flows from continuing operations. The Group’s debt financing is also analysed in notes 17 and 21. 
Included within the Group’s net debt are cash and cash equivalent balances that are not readily available for use by the Group. 
These balances are not significant, and are not readily available due to restrictions within some of the countries in which we operate.
Earnings per share and dividend payments are the two measures which, in the Board’s view, summarise best whether the Group’s 
objectives regarding equity management are being met. The Group’s earnings and dividends per share and relative rates of growth 
illustrate the extent to which equity attributable to shareholders has changed. Both measures are disclosed and discussed within 
the strategic report and notes 7 and 8.
The Group’s objective is to maximise sustainable long term growth of the earnings per share. 
De La Rue’s dividend policy is to provide shareholders with a competitive return on their investment, while assuring sufficient 
reinvestment of profits to enable the Group to achieve its strategy. During the period, the Group invested £37m in ongoing research 
and development and capital expenditure. The proposed total dividend for the year is covered 1.6 times. 
The decision to pay dividends, and the amount of the dividends, will depend on, among other things the earnings, financial position, 
capital requirements, general business conditions, cash flows, net debt levels and share buyback plans. 
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
14 Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank balances and cash held by the Group and short term deposits with an original maturity  
of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form part of the Group’s cash management are included  
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.

Other deferred assets and liabilities include tax associated with provisions of £2.4m (2014/15: £2.9m) and in respect of overseas 
tax credits £4.5m (2014/15: £4.2m).
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses available to carry forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit 
through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £6.1m (2014/15: £3.0m) in respect of losses amounting to £19.7m 
(2014/15: £10.4m) that can be carried forward against future taxable income. Similarly, the Group has not recognised deferred 
tax assets of £10.0m (2014/15: £11.2m) in respect of overseas tax credits that are carried forward for utilisation in future periods.
Unremitted earnings totalled £201m at 26 March 2016 (2014/15: £502m). Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised for the 
withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal 
can be controlled and it was considered unlikely that dividends would be paid from those subsidiaries.
UK capital losses of £329.2m are carried forward at 26 March 2016 (2014/15: £330.1m). No deferred tax asset has been recognised 
in respect of these losses. 
UK tax rate
A reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20 per cent to 19 per cent (effective from April 2017) then 18 per cent 
(effective from April 2020) was substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. This will reduce the UK Group’s future current tax charge 
accordingly. The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 26 March 2016 have been calculated based on the rate of 18 per cent 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
It was announced at the 2016 Budget that the main rate of UK corporation tax shall be reduced to 17 per cent from April 2020. 
This amendment was not substantively enacted at 26 March 2016 and therefore has not been reflected in the deferred tax figures  
on the balance sheet.

As at 26 March 2016, the Group has committed borrowing facilities, all maturing in more than one year, of £250m. Up to £100m  
of the £250m facility can be utilised for either loans or guarantees.
As the draw downs on these loans are typically rolled over on terms of between one and three months, the borrowings are disclosed  
as a current liability. This is notwithstanding the long term nature of this facility which expires in December 2019. 110 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
18 Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation in respect of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best 
estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted where the time value of money 
is considered material.

Restructuring provisions principally represent amounts for various reorganisations, in Currency and Product Authenticity and Traceability. 
In December 2015 we announced the results of our manufacturing footprint review which will reduce our core banknote print production 
capacity from eight billion to six billion notes a year. These provisions include related amounts for staff compensation and site exit costs, 
which are expected to be utilised over three years.
Warranty provisions relate to present obligations for defective products and include known claims as well as anticipated claims that 
had not been reported at the balance sheet date. The provisions are management judgements based on information currently available, 
past history and experience of the products sold. However, it is inherent in the nature of the business that the actual liabilities may differ 
from the provisions. The precise timing of the utilisation of these provisions is uncertain but is generally expected to fall within one year. 
The utilisation for the year includes payment of £13.3m in respect of the invocation of guarantees, provided in 2014/15. 
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates. There are no individually material provisions within 
this total in the current or prior period.

20 Share based payments 
The Group operates various equity settled and cash settled option schemes. For equity settled share options, the services received 
from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options. The fair value is calculated at grant date and recognised 
in the consolidated income statement, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity, on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the numbers of shares that are actually expected to vest, taking into account non-market vesting conditions 
(including service conditions). Vesting conditions, other than non-market based conditions, are not taken into account when estimating 
the fair value.
For cash settled share options, the services received from employees are measured at the fair value of the liability for options 
outstanding and recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period. The fair value of 
the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. 
At 26 March 2016, the Group has a number of share based payment plans, which are described below. These plans have been 
accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2, Share Based Payments, which means that IFRS 2 has 
been applied to all grants of employee share based payments granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005 
and cash settled awards outstanding at 1 January 2005.
The compensation cost and related liability that have been recognised for the Group’s share based plans are set out in the table below:

An expected volatility rate of 30 per cent (2014/15: 30 per cent) has been used for grants in the period. This rate is based on historical 
volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield  
on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. The rate applied during the year was  
1.0 or 1.4 per cent depending on the vesting period.

Savings Related Share Option Scheme
The scheme is open to all UK employees. Options are granted at the prevailing market price at the time of the grant (with a discretionary 
discount to the market price) to employees who agree to save between £5 and the maximum savings amount offered per month over 
a period of three or five years. 
There are no performance conditions attaching to the options. After the three or five year term has expired, employees normally have 
six months in which to decide whether or not to exercise their options. A pre-vesting forfeiture rate of 5 per cent has been assumed.

US Employee Share Purchase Plan
De La Rue operates a US Employee Share Purchase Plan for US employees. Under the plan, employees have an option to  
purchase De La Rue plc shares at the end of each 12 month savings period at a price which is the lower of the market value of the 
De La Rue plc share either at the beginning or the end of the offering period, less a 15 per cent discount. In 2015/16, 11,335 shares 
(2014/15: 13,979 shares) were allotted pursuant to the plan. The Company has suspended future offerings from 1 January 2016 due  
to the low number of participants and corresponding shares awarded, as it is no longer considered a cost effective incentive and benefit 
to US employees. 
Market share purchase of shares by Trustee De La Rue Employee Share Ownership Trust 
The De La Rue Employee Share Ownership Trust (Trust) is a separately administered trust established to administer shares granted 
to Executive Directors and senior employees under the various discretionary share option plans established by the Company. Liabilities 
of the Trust are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the Trust mainly comprise shares in the Company. Ardel Trust Company 
(Guernsey) Limited is the Trustee. The own shares held by the Trust are shown as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. The shares will be 
held at historical rates until such time as they are disposed of. Any profit or loss on the disposal of own shares is treated as a movement 
in reserves rather than as an income statement item. With effect from 20 April 2015 Ardel Trust Company (Guernsey) Limited completed 
a change of name to Equiom (Guernsey) Limited.
The Trustee held no shares at 26 March 2016. 114 De La Rue Annual Report 2016

A lease is defined as an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee the right to use a specific asset for an agreed period 
of time in return for a payment or a series of payments.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Benefits 
received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.

23 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates retirement benefit schemes, devised in accordance with local conditions and practices in the country concerned, 
covering the majority of employees. The assets of the Group’s schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts or are 
insured. The major schemes are defined benefit pension schemes with assets held separately from the Group. The major defined benefit 
pension schemes are based in the UK and are now closed to future accrual, with all members being deferred members or pensioners. 
The cost of providing benefits under each scheme is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in operating costs in the Group income 
statement. The interest income on the plan assets of funded defined benefit pension schemes and the imputed interest on pension 
scheme liabilities are disclosed as retirement benefit obligation net finance expense respectively in the income statement.
Return on plan assets excluding interest income on the assets, changes in the retirement benefit obligation due to experience and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which they arise.
The liability recognised in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair 
value of the scheme assets, as determined by actuarial valuations carried out at the balance sheet date.
The Group has considered whether the minimum funding commitments made to its schemes could give rise to an additional liability 
under IFRIC 14 and determined that no additional liability is required based on the Group’s rights.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.

The Diversified Growth Fund is a diversified asset portfolio which includes investments in equities, emerging market bonds, property,  
high yield credit and structured finance and smaller holdings in other asset classes. The Liability Driven Investment (LDI) fund consists of 
fixed interest bond holdings (approximately 59 per cent), index linked bond holdings (approximately 33 per cent) and cash (approximately 
8 per cent). Interest rate swaps and floating rate notes are employed to complement the role of the LDI fund for liability risk management. 
Other UK assets comprise cash, interest rate swaps and floating rate notes. 116 De La Rue Annual Report 2016

Future pension increases – past service 3.60 – 3.60 –

The financial assumptions adopted as at 26 March 2016 reflect the duration of the scheme liabilities which has been estimated  
to be 19 years.
At 26 March 2016 mortality assumptions were based on tables issued by Club Vita, with future improvements in line with the  
CMI model, CMI_2013 and a long term rate of 1.25 per cent per annum. This assumption has been updated from that used in  
2014/15 based on the expected assumption to be used at the 5 April 2015 funding valuation but removing a margin for prudence.  
The resulting life expectancies within retirement are as follows:
2016 2015
Aged 65 retiring immediately (current pensioner) Male 23.0 22.2
Female 24.4 24.6
Aged 50 retiring in 17 years (future pensioner) Male 24.1 21.6
Female 26.9 24.0
The defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to the following main risks:
Mortality risk – an increase in the life expectancy of members will increase the liabilities of the schemes. The mortality assumptions  
are reviewed regularly, and are considered appropriate.
Interest rate risk – A decrease in bond yields will increase the liabilities of the scheme. Liability driven investment strategies are used  
to hedge part of this risk.
Investment risk – The pension schemes invest in a range of assets to mitigate the risk of any single asset class, and align growth  
and returns to the long term funding objectives. The investment strategy is reviewed regularly to ensure it continues to be appropriate.
Inflation risk – The liabilities of the scheme are linked to inflation. An increase in inflation will result in an increase in liabilities. There are 
caps in place for UK scheme benefits to mitigate the risk of extreme increases in inflation. Liability driven investment strategies are used 
to hedge part of this risk.
Any increase in the retirement benefit obligation could lead to additional funding obligations in future years. 
The table below provides the sensitivity of the liability in the scheme to changes in various assumptions:
Assumption change Approximate impact on liability
0.25% decrease in discount rate Increase in liability of c£49m
0.25% increase in RPI inflation rate Increase in liability of c£32m
Increasing life expectancy by one year Increase in liability of c£32m
The largest defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Group is in the UK. A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is currently being 
carried out by a qualified actuary as at 5 April 2015.

During 2015/16, the Group made special funding payments of £19.1m (including scheme administration fees). The Group had agreed 
with the scheme Trustees and the Pensions Regulator deficit funding payments to the scheme of £18.9m in 2016/17, rising by 4 per cent 
per annum. Pending finalisation of the 2015 valuation, the special funding arrangements agreed in 2012 which aim to eliminate the deficit 
by 2022 remain unchanged. 
(b) Defined contribution pension plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans for which the charge in the consolidated income statement for the year was 
£9.4m (2014/15: £10.0m).

26 Contingent liabilities
De La Rue has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation 
matters from which, in the ordinary course of business, contingent liabilities can arise. While the outcome of litigation and disputes 
can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries, the Directors believe that adequate provision has been made to cover these matters. The Group also provides guarantees 
and performance bonds which are issued in the ordinary course of business. In the event that a guarantee or bond is called, provision 
may be required subject to the particular circumstances, including an assessment of its recoverability.
The Company has received notification from the relevant UK law enforcement authorities that they have closed their investigation related 
to certain paper mis-certification issues in 2010. No action has been taken against the Company.
27 Related party transactions
During the year the Group traded on an arms length basis with the associated company Fidink S.A. (33.3 per cent owned).  
The Group’s trading activities with this company included £24.2m (2014/15: £24.4m) for the purchase of security ink and other 
consumables. At the balance sheet date there were creditor balances of £3.2m (2014/15: £5.7m) with Fidink S.A. 
Intra-Group transactions between the parent and the fully consolidated subsidiaries or between fully consolidated subsidiaries 
are eliminated on consolidation.

28 Events since the balance sheet date
Since the year end the following material events have occurred:
Non-adjusting event
On 22 May 2016 the sale of the Cash Processing Solutions business was completed. The net result will be recognised in the half year 
ending 24 September 2016. This includes the loss on disposal of current assets and liabilities held for sale (refer to note 2), the recycling 
through the income statement of accumulated foreign exchange translation movements recorded in reserves and the estimated costs 
of disposal. 
In addition to the cash payment upon completion and deferred cash payments there is also a contingent element of consideration which 
is dependent upon the disposed business meeting certain future targets.

Company statement of changes in equity
for the period ended 26 March 2016 124 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of De La Rue 
plc (the Company) have been prepared 
in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 102 The Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) as issued 
in August 2014. The amendments to 
FRS 102 issued in July 2015 and effective 
immediately have been applied. The 
presentation currency of these financial 
statements is sterling. 
Under section s408 of the Companies  
Act 2006 the company is exempt from  
the requirement to present its own profit 
and loss account. 
In the transition to FRS 102 from old 
UK GAAP , the Company has made no 
measurement and recognition adjustments.
FRS 102 grants certain first-time adoption 
exemptions from the full requirements of 
FRS 102. The following exemption has 
been taken in these financial statements: 
Separate financial instruments – carrying 
amount of the Company’s cost of 
investment in subsidiaries is its deemed 
cost at transition date, 30 March 2014.
In these financial statements, the company 
is considered to be a qualifying entity (for 
the purposes of this FRS) and has applied 
the exemptions available under FRS 102 
in respect of the following disclosures: 
•  Reconciliation of the number of  
shares outstanding from the beginning  
to end of the period 
•  Cash Flow Statement and related notes
•  Key Management Personnel 
compensation 
As the consolidated financial statements 
of the Company include the equivalent 
disclosures, the Company has also taken 
the exemptions under FRS 102 available 
in respect of the following disclosures:
•  Certain disclosures required by FRS 
102.26 Share Based Payments
•  The disclosures required by FRS 102.11 
Basic Financial Instruments and FRS 
102.12 Other Financial Instrument Issues 
in respect of financial instruments not 
falling within the fair value accounting 
rules of Paragraph 36(4) of Schedule 1
•  The Company proposes to continue 
to adopt FRS 102 with the above 
disclosure exemptions in its next 
financial statements 
The accounting policies set out below 
have, unless otherwise stated, been 
applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these financial statements.  
On first time adoption of FRS 102,  
the Company has not retrospectively 
changed its accounting under old UK 
GAAP for derecognition of financial assets 
and liabilities before the date of transition, 
hedge accounting for any hedging 
relationships that no longer existed at the 
date of transition, accounting estimates 
or discontinued operations. 
Judgements made by the directors, in  
the application of these accounting policies 
that have significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant 
risk of material adjustment in the next year 
are discussed on pages 87 to 88.
The accounts have been prepared as at 
26 March 2016, being the last Saturday in 
March. The comparatives for the 2014/15 
financial period are for the period ended 
28 March 2015.
The following accounting policies have 
been applied consistently in dealing 
with items which are considered 
material in relation to the Company 
financial statements. 
Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared 
on the historical cost basis except that 
the following assets and liabilities are 
stated at their fair value: derivative financial 
instruments, and financial instruments 
classified at fair value through the 
profit or loss.
Foreign currencies
Amounts receivable from overseas 
subsidiaries which are denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the appropriate period end rates 
of exchange. Exchange gains and losses 
on translating foreign currency amounts 
are included within the interest section 
of the profit and loss account except for 
exchange gains and losses associated with 
hedging loans that are taken to reserves.
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into the functional currency 
at the rates of exchange prevailing at 
the dates of the individual transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are subsequently 
retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date. Such exchange 
differences are taken to the profit and 
loss account.
Dividends
Under FRS 102, final ordinary dividends 
payable to the shareholders of the 
Company are recognised in the period 
that they are approved by the shareholders. 
Interim ordinary dividends are recognised 
in the period that they are paid.
Investments in subsidiaries
These are separate financial statements 
of the company. Investments in subsidiaries 
are carried at deemed cost.
Employee benefits
Defined benefit plans
The pension rights of the Company 
employees are dealt with through a self 
administered scheme, the assets of which 
are held independently of the Group’s 
finances. The scheme is a defined benefit 
scheme and is closed to future accrual. 
The Group agrees deficit funding with the 
scheme Trustees and Pension Regulator. 
The Company is a participating employer 
but the Group has adopted a policy 
whereby the scheme funding and deficit 
are recorded in the main UK trading 
subsidiary of the Company, De La Rue 
International Limited, which pays all 
contributions to the scheme and hence 
these are not shown in the Company 
accounts. Full details of the scheme 
and its deficit (measured on an IAS 19R 
basis) can be found in note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Share-based payment transactions
Full details of the share based payments 
Schemes operated by the Group are 
found in note 20 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based  
on the result for the period and takes 
into account taxation deferred because 
of timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without 
discounting, in respect of all timing 
differences between the treatment of 
certain items for taxation and accounting 
purposes which have arisen but not 
reversed by the balance sheet date, 
except as otherwise required by FRS 102.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial 
guarantee contracts to guarantee the 
indebtedness of other companies within 
the Group, the Company considers 
these to be insurance arrangements and 
accounts for them as such. In this respect, 
the Company treats the guarantee contract 
as a contingent liability until such time as 
it becomes probable that the Company 
will be required to make a payment under 
the guarantee.

8a Share capital
For details of share capital, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
9a Share based payments
The Company operates various equity and cash settled option schemes although the majority of plans are settled by the issue of shares. 
The services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options. The fair value is calculated at 
grant date and recognised in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ funds, on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other than 
market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. FRS 102 has been applied to share settled share options 
granted after 7 November 2002.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiary undertakings these awards are accounted 
for by the Company, as an additional investment in its subsidiary. The costs are determined in accordance with FRS 102. Any payments 
made by the subsidiary undertaking in respect of these arrangements are treated as a return of this investment.
Share based payments recharged to subsidiaries are recorded via the inter-company loan account.
For details of share based payments, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report 
on pages 53 to 73.
10a Related party transactions
The Company has no transactions with or amounts due to or from subsidiary undertakings that are not 100 per cent owned either 
directly by the Company or by its subsidiaries.
For details of key management compensation, see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.

Warning to shareholders  
– boiler room fraud
We are aware that some shareholders 
might have received unsolicited telephone 
calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. These are typically 
from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target 
UK shareholders, offering to sell them what 
often turn out to be worthless or high risk 
shares or investments. These operations 
are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. 
These ‘brokers’ can be very persistent 
and extremely persuasive. You should 
always check any firm calling you about 
investment opportunities is properly 
authorised by the FCA. You will find useful 
advice and information about protecting 
yourself from investment scams on the 
FCA website www.fca.org.uk/consumers.

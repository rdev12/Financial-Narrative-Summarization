Hikma has once again delivered an outstanding 
performance. W e have focused on integrity, high quality 
sales and cost management across all areas of our 
diversified business model, achieving record sales of 
$637 million and 36% growth in net income 
Chairman’s statement
Branded 
Our businesses in the Middle East and North Africa 
(“MENA”) region continued to grow ahead of the 
underlying markets, reinforcing our position as the 
leading regional pharmaceutical manufacturer. 
Injectables 
While revenues in our global Injectables business were 
down slightly compared to 2008, we expect that 
during 2010 this business will return to the growth 
profile it previously enjoyed. We continue to make 
good progress in implementing our oncology strategy,  
and saw Hikma’ s first oncology products launched in 
the MENA region during the second half of the year. 
Generics
Our US Generics business had an excellent year, 
achieving record sales and an impressive return  
to profitability as our new US management team 
implemented strategic and operational changes.  
The competitive environment remained challenging  
in the US but reduced competition in certain product 
lines helped the recovery of this business, enabling  
us to maximise our opportunities and increase  
our market share in key products. 
Quality 
Underlying all of our achievements in 2009 was  
our continued commitment to quality and integrity. 
We continue to adhere to the highest quality and 
ethical standards across all of our operating units  
and believe these are essential to delivering long‑ term 
shareholder value. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 
6.5 cents per share (approximately 4.3 pence per 
share), which will make a dividend for the full year  
of 11.0 cents per share, an increase of 47% on  
2008. The proposed final dividend will be paid on 
27 May 2010 to shareholders on the register on 
16 April 2010, subject to approval by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting. 
Balance sheet developments
Our focus on working capital management during the 
year has delivered excellent results. Significantly higher 
operating cash flow has materially lowered our net 
debt compared to 2008, strengthening our balance 
sheet and giving us financial flexibility to pursue 
future growth opportunities. 
Shareholder value
From the Company’ s listing in October 2005  
through the end of 2009, we have delivered a total 
shareholder return of 87.5%. We are delighted with 
this performance, which exceeds that of the FTSE 250 
index and the FTSE Pharmaceuticals index, which 
grew by 32.5% and 17.7%, respectively, over the 
same period.  07
Delivering Strong performance
Outlook
Hikma should continue to benefit from the overall 
pharmaceutical market growth in the MENA region, 
which we expect to remain higher than the global 
pharmaceutical market. Our share of the MENA 
market should also continue to increase as we further 
penetrate into existing markets, expand into new 
markets and grow our portfolio of own‑ brand and 
in‑ licensed products. There also remains considerable 
scope for us to grow our global Injectables business 
following the significant investments we have  
made in portfolio development, 
sales and marketing and 
manufacturing capacity.  
Our US Generics business is on a strong footing and 
we are confident that we can maintain the positive 
momentum we have created in this business. Overall 
for the Group we expect to deliver Group sales 
growth in the low‑teens in 2010 and expect gross 
margin to be broadly in line with the improved gross 
margin we achieved in 2009.
Going forward
In summary, I am confident of the Company’ s 
prospects for this year and for the years to come.  
This confidence is based on the diversity of our 
business model and the strength of each of our  
core businesses within it.

Business and financial review 12  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Strengthening our leading position 
in the MENA region
Our position as the leading regional pharmaceutical 
company in the MENA region remains solidly in place. 
We continue to increase our market share across the 
region as a whole – expanding our product portfolio 
in growing therapeutic areas and penetrating further 
into new markets, while maintaining our strong 
position in the field of anti-infectives. In rapidly 
changing markets like Algeria, we have demonstrated 
our ability to turn obstacles into opportunities – 
delivering a strong performance relative to other 
players in this market. Increasingly we are benefiting 
from the acquisitions of Hikma Egypt and Arab 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (“APM”) – which  
are now well integrated into the Hikma Group.  
Developing our global product range 
in growing therapeutic areas
Our product portfolio continues to grow with 24 new 
compounds and 47 new dosage strengths and forms 
marketed and sold this year. A further 114 approvals 
across all regions and markets ensures that we will 
maintain a steady stream of new product launches in 
2010. Our portfolio also continues to develop in new 
therapeutic areas, with new launches in oncology, 
CNS, diabetes and respiratory.
Extending our reach and diversity 
through partnerships
We continue to deliver a strong performance from 
our in-licensed products, which grew by 25% in 
2009, reinforcing our position as the licensing partner 
of choice in the MENA region. We signed three new 
licensing agreements during the year that will bring 
four new products into our portfolio over the coming 
years and will strengthen our product offering in key 
therapeutic areas. Using our local manufacturing 
capabilities, we will be able to introduce these 
products into multiple markets simultaneously  
across the MENA region.
Increasing the scale of our speciality 
Injectables business
Our efforts to build scale in our global Injectables 
business continue, with 16 products launched across 
our markets in 2009 and continued investment in 
sales and marketing. The 41 approvals received across 
all regions and geographies in 2009 will help to 
deliver growth in 2010.
Leveraging our expertise and capacity 
in the US market
During 2009 a considerable effort went into 
continuing the turnaround of our operations in  
the US, with outstanding results for the full year.  
The performance of the Generics business in the US 
has exceeded our expectations and I am confident 
that the operational issues we have faced in the  
past are well behind us. We have refocused the 
business on providing higher service levels and we  
2009 has been a very successful year for Hikma  
in which we have made excellent progress towards 
achieving our strategic objectives
Chief Executive Officer’s review Delivering Our strategy

are successfully utilising our high quality, lower cost 
MENA manufacturing facilities in the US market. 
Through well-coordinated and collaborative efforts, 
our teams in the US, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have 
delivered excellent results, significantly increasing  
sales of our global products.
Maintaining our world class 
manufacturing capabilities
I am extremely proud of our manufacturing and 
regulatory personnel, whose teamwork and 
commitment to the highest quality standards really 
paid off this year. Our plant in Portugal passed its  
FDA inspection this autumn with no observations, 
demonstrating the true excellence of the Group 
regulatory team. This teamwork and commitment to 
excellence was reinforced in January 2010, when our 
Jordanian facility (which includes a general formulation 
plant, a penicillin plant, and a chemical plant) also 
passed its FDA inspection,  
again with no observations. 
Quality is proving to be a 
key differentiating factor 
and our investment in  
and commitment to quality 
continues to deliver results.  
Implementing our new organisational structure
To achieve our growth ambitions, we must have  
the right personnel and systems to support them  
in place. Thus, during 2009, we implemented a  
new organisational structure, which was sufficiently 
established to contribute to the year’ s success.  
The new structure created corporate-level marketing, 
operational, HR and business development functions 
designed to improve the efficiency of our activities 
across the Group. I am confident that the new 
structure will enable us to focus on efficiency and 
deliver on our strategic objectives going forward. 
Through our new corporate HR function we are 
implementing fundamental processes that will help  
us to recruit, develop, retain, engage and manage  
our people, thereby supporting our short and 
long-term strategic business objectives. 
I am confident that the new structure will enable 
us to devote an even higher focus on efficiency and 
quality in all of our operations, thereby enabling us  
to deliver on our strategic objectives going forward.

Strong results in 2009
All of these efforts have enabled us to achieve 36% 
net income growth for the Group in 2009. In the 
context of the difficult economic environment,  
these results are truly impressive and demonstrate  
the strength of our diversified business model, our 
dedicated efforts to improve efficiency and the  
hard work of the Hikma teams around the world.
Looking ahead
Looking forward to 2010 and beyond, we still have 
much work to do. We will be implementing the 
following key initiatives to help us deliver continued 
operational excellence and strong financial results.
Improving efficiency continues  
to be a high priority
Because of the value to be generated, we continue  
to challenge and engage every person in the Group  
to innovate for efficiency while maintaining quality. 
Maximising plant utilisation, lowering overheads, 
reducing inventories, better cash collection – these  
are just some of the areas where our people are 
committed to creating value. There is always scope  
to do what we do better – and every little bit helps.

Delivering Our strategy
Centres of excellence in manufacturing  
will enhance our global product range 
Global products are integral to our growth strategy. 
Developing and strengthening our global product 
range is essential. Through the creation of 
manufacturing centres of excellence, we have a 
significant opportunity to grow sales and improve 
margins by better utilising our manufacturing  
facilities across the Group. In our Injectables business 
we are already doing this – we manufacture in 
Portugal and sell across the US, Europe and MENA. 
Our oral cephalosporins, which are produced in  
Saudi Arabia and sold across the MENA region  
and also in the US, are another good example.  
Yet numerous other opportunities remain. 2010  
will see the launch of our oncology products in the 
MENA region and continuing efforts to prepare our 
oncology manufacturing plant in Germany for the 
manufacture of FDA approved products. We expect 
to leverage further our cephalosporin plant in Saudi 
Arabia and our penicillin and general formulation 
plants in Jordan to produce not just for MENA but 
also for the US and, in some cases, Europe. 
Strengthening Group communications
Improving communication across the Group is  
also critical. Strong communication and excellent 
teamwork paid off in 2009 from a regulatory 
perspective. The US turnaround was also made easier 
by the well coordinated efforts of the US, Jordanian 
and Saudi teams previously mentioned. Facilitating 
communication across departments and geographies 
in our rapidly expanding Group will remain a priority.  
Growing through acquisitions
We remain very ambitious for the longer-term 
prospects for the Group and we have an excellent 
track record for making successful acquisitions and 
integrating them swiftly. Acquisitions in the MENA 
region remain a priority – both to enter new markets 
and develop our position in existing markets. We will 
also continue to look for opportunities in Europe,  
the US and Asia, particularly when it comes to 
acquiring new global products and new technologies.  
Developing new partnerships
Our commitment to developing our in-licensed 
portfolio remains very much intact. We believe  
that we remain the clear partner of choice in  
the MENA region for licensing opportunities,  
as the recent additions to our in-licensed  
portfolio demonstrate.  
Investing in our people
As a company we have always been committed to 
developing our people. As the Group grows, this is 
increasingly important. We will continue to challenge 
ourselves to improve and commit to providing the 
opportunities necessary for our teams to develop. 
Striving to make Hikma the employer of choice will 
ensure we retain the skills required to take our 
business forward.
Going forward
I am very excited by the opportunities we have 
to expand our business in 2010 and beyond.

and audited financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2009. For the purposes of this report, 
“Company” means Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC  
and “Group” means the Company and its subsidiary 
and associated undertakings.
Key performance indicators
The Board measures progress on our strategic 
objectives by reference to five key financial 
performance indicators (“KPIs”) applied on a 
Group‑ wide and segmental basis. These same 
indicators are used by the executive management  
to manage the business. Performance in  
2009 against these indicators is set out in  
the table below, together with the prior year 
performance data. 
Group performance
Revenue for the Group increased by 9.7% to 
$636.9 million, compared to $580.7 million in 
2008. During the period our Branded business 
continued to perform well and we saw a considerable 
improvement in our US Generics business compared 
to 2008. These strong performances were partially 
offset by a slight decline in Injectables revenues 
compared to 2008, reflecting the impact of negative 
foreign exchange movements and our strategic 
decision to curtail private label sales in the US.
Exchange rate movements had a negative impact 
on Group revenue of approximately $16.3 million,  
or 2.6%, and on Group operating profit of 
approximately $8.3 million, or 7.8%. The impact  
on sales resulted primarily from the strengthening  
of the US Dollar relative to the Euro, Algerian Dinar, 
Sudanese Pound and Egyptian Pound. The impact on 
operating profit resulted from the strengthening of 
the US Dollar relative to the Algerian Dinar, Sudanese 
Pound and Egyptian Pound. On a constant currency 
basis, Group revenues increased by 12.5%.

The Branded business continues to represent 55%  
of Group sales and the combined Branded and 
Injectables sales in MENA now make up 63.5%  
of total Group sales. 
The Group’ s gross profit increased by 18.7% to 
$304.4 million, compared to $256.5 million in 2008. 
Group gross margin was 47.8%, compared to  
44.2% in 2008, and well ahead of the targeted two 
percentage point improvement that we set at the 
beginning of the year. This improvement primarily 
reflects the increase in profitability in our Generics 
business, which was driven by strategic price increases 
across our portfolio and a shift in product mix. Production 
efficiencies and our continued efforts to optimise our 
API sourcing also delivered cost benefits during the year .
Group operating expenses grew by 12.1% to 
$197.1 million, compared to $175.8 million in 2008, 
but as a percentage of sales remained relatively stable 
at 31.0%, compared to 30.3% in 2008. The paragraphs 
below address the Group’ s main operating expenses 
in turn.
Group sales and marketing expenses grew more 
slowly than Group sales during the year, increasing  
by 8.3% to $98.1 million, compared to $90.6 million 
in 2008. Consequently sales and marketing expenses 
decreased slightly as a percentage of sales from 
15.6% in 2008 to 15.4%. This reflects better control 
of sales and marketing expenses in the Branded 
business, despite continued investment in developing 
our sales and marketing capabilities across the region, 
and strong growth in the Generics business, with its 
lower associated sales and marketing costs.
General and administrative expenses increased  
by 17.3% to $66.7 million, compared to $56.9 million 
in 2008. This is due to an increase in the cost of 
Group‑ wide employee compensation and incentive 
schemes and an increase in bad debt provisions of 
approximately $2 million. General and administrative 
expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 
10.5%, from 9.8% in 2008. 
Investment in R&D decreased by 24.0% to 
$16.8 million, with total investment in R&D now 
representing 2.6% of Group revenue, compared  
to 3.8% in 2008. The decline in 2009 came from 
reduced investment in bioequivalence studies for  
our US Generics business and increased emphasis  
on in‑ licensing and acquisition of new products. 
Going forward, we expect to increase our investment 
in R&D as a percentage of sales as we re‑ focus our 
efforts on developing our global product portfolio  
and on the fast growing field of oncology. 
Other net operating expenses increased by 
$9.3 million to $15.5 million in 2009. This increase  
is due primarily to an increase in provisions for slow 
moving items and foreign exchange losses resulting 
mainly from the depreciation in the Algerian and 
Sudanese currencies and the Euro. 
Operating profit for the Group increased by 
33.0% to $107.3 million, compared to $80.7 million 
in 2008. Our Group operating margin improved by 
three percentage points to 16.8% compared to 
13.9% in 2008.

The MENA pharmaceutical market
Branded 
2009 highlights:
Branded revenues up 13.1% in constant currency 
Strong demand for our leading anti‑ infectives
Successful development of our cardiovascular  
and diabetes business
Excellent progress in the rollout of key  
in‑ licensed products
Branded revenues increased by 9.9% in 2009 to 
$352.7 million, compared to $320.8 million in 2008.  
In constant currency, Branded revenues increased  
by 13.1%. Prioritising high quality sales and 
continued investment in developing our sales and 
marketing capabilities helped to increase customer 
demand across most Branded markets and to develop 
some of our newer markets including Iraq, Egypt, 
Sudan and Libya. We continued to focus on promoting 
new and recently launched products in key therapeutic 
areas and on building greater brand recognition across 
the MENA region. 
As a result of these efforts, Hikma is the largest 
regional pharmaceutical company in the MENA region 
and the fifth largest pharmaceutical company overall 
in the MENA region, with a market share
1
 of 3.7%,  
up from 3.4% at the end of 2008. 
Our business in Algeria performed well in 2009, 
considering regulatory changes introduced during the 
year. At the end of December, our market share in 
Algeria had increased to 6.9%, compared to 6.4%  
at the end of December 2008, and we improved  
our market position. At the end of December 2009, 
Hikma was the second largest pharmaceutical 
company and the largest generic pharmaceutical 
manufacturer by value in the Algerian market.  
We have expanded our product portfolio during  
the year, which now includes cardiovascular  
products such as Blopress
®
 (candesartan) and 
Iminopril
®
 (imidapril), the oral diabetes products 
Actos
®
 (pioglitazone) and Glorion
®
 (glimepiride), 
and the dyslipidemia product T orvast
®
 (atorvastatin). 
We expect that the recent regulatory changes  
in Algeria, which included government imposed 
limitations on imports and sales, reductions in the 
pricing of locally produced products and the need  
to trade through confirmed letters of credit, will 
continue to impact the pharmaceutical market in 
Algeria in 2010. In the past we have demonstrated 
our ability to manage disruptions in this frequently 
changing environment. We expect that the expansion 
of our local production capacity, the optimisation  
of our sales channels and our enhanced sales and 
marketing efforts will enable us to address these 
issues and continue to perform ahead of the market.
In Saudi Arabia, our specialist cardiovascular sales 
team is focusing on building a leading position in the 
treatment of chronic heart conditions and diabetes 
through the promotion of key products like Blopress
®
, 
Actos
®
 and Glorion
®
. At the same time, we continue  31
Delivering Our strategy
to see steady demand for our leading anti‑infectives 
in this market. At the end of December, our market 
share in Saudi Arabia had increased to 5.4%, 
compared to 4.9% at the end of December 2008.  
We are now the fourth largest pharmaceutical 
company by value in the Saudi market, compared 
to the fifth largest at the end of December 2008.
In Jordan we have maintained our position as 
the market leader with a market share of 12.9%, 
up from 12.4% at the end of December 2008. 
We delivered a strong performance in Jordan during 
the period supported by strong sales of our leading 
anti‑infectives and tender sales. 
In Egypt, we delivered strong growth across most 
of our product portfolio and began the rollout of 
some of our key Branded products, including Actos
®
, 
T anatril
®
 (imidapril) Blopress
®
, and Omnicef
®
. At the 
end of December, our market share in Egypt was 
stable at 1.4%.
Other markets that performed well during  
the year were Iraq, Sudan, Libya and Lebanon,  
where we benefited from more favourable  
operating environments, strong demand for our  
own brands, and the launches of some of our  
leading in‑licensed products. 
Revenue from in‑ licensed products grew by 24.9% 
in 2009 to $133.6 million, representing 37.9% of 
Branded sales. Actos
®
 has now been launched in 13 
markets, Blopress
®
 has been launched in 15 markets, 
and Blopress Plus
®
 and T akepron
®
 have been launched 
in nine markets. Our sales and marketing teams are 
working hard to establish these products as leading 
cardiovascular and diabetes brands in the MENA 
through a combination of medical education 
programmes, sponsorship of scientific conferences 
and targeted marketing campaigns.
We continue our efforts to develop our portfolio  
of in‑ licensed products, evidenced by the signing  
of three new licensing agreements during the 
year. In June we signed an agreement with 
T eikoku Pharma USA for our own brand of 
Lidoderm
®
, the first and only US FDA approved patch 
for post‑herpetic neuralgia. This agreement covers  
the territories of Algeria, Morocco, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, 
and Tunisia. In July, we signed two agreements with 
Faes Farma SA, a Spanish manufacturing company 
– one for the manufacturing and marketing of 
mesalazine, a generic product used for the treatment 
of inflammatory intestinal disease, and one for  
the license to manufacture and market the novel 
anti‑histamine Bilastine
®
. 
In December 2009, Astellas Pharma Europe, Ltd. 
granted Hikma the license to promote and distribute 
Advagraf
®
, Astellas’ prolonged‑release once‑daily 
formulation of Prograf
®
, the immunosuppressant 
tacrolimus, in the MENA region. Through this 
agreement, Astellas grants exclusive rights to  
Hikma for the distribution and promotion of 
Advagraf
®
 across 17 MENA countries. Hikma will  
also continue to distribute and promote Prograf
®
  
in the same territories.
In early January 2010, we signed an exclusive 
agreement to represent BioCryst, a US‑ based 
biotechnology company, in respect of its anti‑ viral 
product Peramivir for pandemic flu treatment 
stockpiling opportunities with governments in 
MENA region. 
All of these agreements reflect our position  
as the partner of choice for marketing branded 
products in the region.
In 2009, the Branded business launched a total  
of 71 products across all markets, including six  
new compounds and 18 new dosage forms and 
strengths. The Branded business also received 69 
regulatory approvals across the region, including  
10 for new products. 
Gross profit in the Branded business increased by 
8.6% to $187.6 million, compared to $172.8 million 
in 2008. The Branded business’s gross margin 
declined slightly to 53.2%, compared to 53.9% in 
2008, reflecting the depreciation of the Algerian 
Dinar, Sudanese Pound and Egyptian Pound.  
Branded operating profit increased by 4.5% to 
$91.4 million, compared to $87.5 million in 2008. 
Operating margin in the Branded business was 
25.9%, compared to 27.3% in 2008. This change is 
mainly due to the negative impact of exchange rates 
described above. 
In 2010, we expect low double digit revenue 
growth in our Branded business, with sales spread 
more evenly over the course of the year than in 
previous years, reflecting a shift in the geographic and 
product sales mix.  If foreign exchange rates remain 
stable in 2010, we expect Branded operating margins 
to be broadly in line with 2009. 32  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Injectables
2009 highlights:
Injectables revenues down 3.5% to $144.1 million 
14% growth in Injectables sales in the MENA region
Strategic decision to curtail private label sales  
in the US
Successful FDA inspection of our sterile 
manufacturing facilities in Portugal with 
zero observations
Injectables revenues across all regions recovered in  
the second half of the year, enabling us to close  
the year only slightly down on 2008, with sales of 
$144.1 million, compared to $149.3 million in 2008. 
The slight decline in full year sales was due primarily 
to our decision to curtail private label sales in our  
US business and the depreciation in the Algerian  
and Sudanese currencies and the Euro. 
MENA Injectables sales increased by 14.0% to 
$62.3 million, compared to $54.7 million in 2008. 
On a constant currency basis, MENA Injectables sales 
grew by 18.5%. This increase is attributed to strong 
growth in Iraq and Algeria, an increasing contribution 
from existing markets like Lebanon and Jordan,  
and an initial contribution from newly launched 
oncology products. 
Having successfully built a hospital sales force in 
the US, we now have greater capability to market  
our own products in this market. In the second half  
of the year we more than doubled own product sales, 
benefiting from a new supply agreement signed with  
a leading group purchasing organisation and from 
new product launches. 
Due to a strategic decision to curtail private label 
sales (approximately $11 million in 2008), US Injectables 
sales declined year on year to $17.0 million, from 
$24.8 million in 2008. 
European Injectable sales reached $64.8 million  
in 2009, down 7.3% from $69.9 million in 2008. 
The decline is attributed to the depreciation of the Euro, 
a loss of $3.6 million in sales from a discontinued 
in‑ licensed product and continued pricing pressure  
in Germany, our largest market. This was partially 
offset by increased sales from new product launches 
and an increase in market share in some of our  
newer markets.
In 2009, the Injectables business launched a total 
of 55 products across all markets, including 16 new 
compounds and 26 new dosage forms and strengths. 
The Injectables business also received a total of 41 
regulatory approvals across all regions and markets, 
including 24 in MENA, nine in Europe and eight in 
the US. 
Injectables gross profit decreased by 0.7% to 
$62.9 million, compared to $63.4 million in 2008, 
with gross margin increasing to 43.7%, compared 
to  42.4% in 2008. The increase in margin reflects  
the increase in sales from the MENA region as a 
percentage of total Injectables sales.
Injectables operating profit decreased by 30.6% 
to $15.3 million, compared to $22.1 million in 2008. 
Injectables operating margin decreased to 10.7%  
in 2009, down from 14.8% in 2008. This decline is 
explained by lower sales in the US and Europe and 
increasing operating expenses relating to higher sales 
and marketing expenses in MENA and the US and  
an increase in foreign exchange losses. 
Following the investments we have been making 
in our Injectables business in recent years, we expect 
strong growth in Injectables sales in 2010 driven  
by our expanding product portfolio, increasing 
demand for contract manufacturing and continuing 
momentum in sales, particularly in the MENA region 
and the US.

Delivering Our strategy
Generics
2009 highlights:
Delivered significant improvement in Generics 
revenues, up 27.8%
More than doubled gross margin to 38.9%, up from 
18.3% in 2008
Revenue in our Generics business increased by 27.8% 
to $135.1 million, compared to $105.7 million in 2008. 
This strong performance reflects the actions of the 
strengthened US management team and in particular 
focused sales, marketing and operational improvements. 
Over the past 18 months we have rationalised our 
product portfolio, increased our focus on our higher 
margin products and implemented price increases 
across our portfolio. Through focused sales targeting 
and improved service levels, we have been developing 
better relationships with key wholesale and retail 
customers, and are consequently improving the 
predictability of our revenue streams. At the same 
time our operations have become more efficient. 
The strong performance also reflects the changing 
competitive landscape in the US. The absence of some 
of our competitors from the market has created new 
opportunities, increasing demand across our product 
portfolio and reducing our reliance on any one product. 
Demand has been particularly strong for the anti‑infectives 
we produce at our FDA approved facilities in Jordan 
and Saudi Arabia. During 2009 we tripled sales of 
anti‑infectives produced at these facilities. 
 
 
All of these actions led to an increase in Generics 
gross profit of 172.1% to $52.5 million, compared  
to $19.3 million in 2008. Gross margin more than 
doubled from 18.3% in 2008 to 38.9% in 2009. 
Consequently, the Generics segment achieved an 
operating profit of $25.0 million in 2009, compared 
to an operating loss of $5.8 million in 2008. Generic 
operating margins reached 18.5% in 2009.
In 2009, the Generics business launched two new 
compounds in three new dosage forms and strengths. 
Having returned to profitability in our Generics 
business in 2009, we are confident that this business 
will continue to perform well in 2010 and currently 
expect high single‑digit sales growth for the full year.

Other businesses 
Other businesses primarily comprise Arab Medical 
Containers (“AMC”), a manufacturer of 
pharmaceutical packaging, and International 
Pharmaceuticals Research Centre, which conducts 
bio‑ equivalency studies. These businesses, which 
supply third parties as well as other Group operations, 
had aggregate revenues of $5.1 million, compared 
with aggregate revenue of $4.8 million in 2008.  
This represented 0.8% of Group revenues in 2009.
These Other businesses delivered an operating 
loss of $2.3 million in 2009, compared to an operating 
loss of $3.7 million in 2008. The slight improvement 
can be attributed to increased efficiencies in corporate 
research and development costs.
Research and development

The Group’ s product portfolio continues to grow.  
In 2009 we launched 24 new compounds, expanding 
the Group portfolio to 382 compounds in 795 dosage 
forms and strengths. We manufacture and/or sell 40 
of these compounds under‑ license.
Across all businesses and markets, a total of 
129 products were launched. In addition, the Group 
received 114 approvals. 
T o ensure the continuous development of our

Delivering Our strategy
We estimate the approximate addressable market for 
our portfolio of pending approvals to be approximately 
$27 billion, based on the 2009 full year sales of the 
currently marketed equivalent products in the markets 
covered by the pending approvals.
At 31 December 2009, we had a total of 71 new 
products under development, the majority of which 
should receive several marketing authorisations for 
differing strengths and/or product forms over the  
next few years. 
Net finance expense
Net finance expense decreased to $12.3 million, 
compared to $16.7 million in 2008 due to  
lower interest rates and lower net debt levels  
as explained in the operating cash flow and 
investment section below.
Profit before tax
Profit before taxes for the Group increased by 48.0% 
to $94.8 million, compared to $64.0 million in 2008. 
Tax
The Group incurred a tax expense of $15.5 million  
in 2009. The effective tax rate was 16.3%, compared 
to 10.8% in 2008. The increase in the effective  
tax rate reflects the return to profitability in our  
US Generics business. 
Non-controlling interest
The profit attributable to non‑controlling interest was 
negative $1.6 million in 2009. This primarily arose 
on profits in our 51% owned subsidiary in Sudan.
Profit for the year
The Group’ s profit attributable to equity holders  
of the parent increased by 36.0% to $77.7million. 
On constant currency, growth in profit attributable  
to equity holders of the parent increased by 49.9%.
Adjusted profit for the year
Excluding the amortisation of intangible assets  
(other than software), the Group’ s adjusted profit  
for the year attributable to equity holders of the 
parent increased by 24.1% to $83.6 million for  
the year ended 31 December 2009, compared  
with $67.4
3
 million in 2008.
Earnings per share 
Diluted earnings per share for the year to 
31 December 2009 were 40.1 cents, up 35.6% 
from 29.6 cents in 2008. 
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of  
6.5 cents per share (approximately 4.3 pence per 
share), which will make a dividend for the full year  
of 11.0 cents per share, up from 7.5 cents per share 
in 2008, an increase of 46.7%. The proposed final 
dividend will be paid on 27 May 2010 to shareholders 
on the register on 16 April 2010, subject to approval 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.  36  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Business and financial review continued
Operating cash flow and investment
The Group achieved an overall improvement in 
working capital for the period, reducing its working 
capital days by six days. Improvement was made in 
the MENA region and in Europe, where we generated 
significant cash flow from operations. This increase is 
a reflection of our continued focus on improving 
collections, increased factoring of receivables and a 
leaner supply chain. This improvement was offset, 
however, by our US Generics business, where 
receivables increased due to a change in customer 
mix and where a planned increase in inventories is 
helping us to maintain high service levels and 
improve profitability.
Group receivable days increased by seven days 
compared to 31 December 2008, from 109 days to 
116 days as at 31 December 2009. Inventory days 
increased by three days to 177 days reflecting an 
increase in inventories in the US related to our efforts 
to improve service levels. Increases in receivable and 
inventory days were offset by an improvement in 
payable days of 15 days.
Working capital improvements coupled with 
improved profitability led to a significant increase  
in operating cash flow to reach $119.0 million, 
compared to $75.0 million in 2008.
 
 
Balance sheet
Capital expenditure declined to $37.0 million  
from $56.7 million in 2008. During the period, 
expenditure was focused on the completion of our 
new lyophilisation plant in Portugal, the expansion of 
our manufacturing capacity in Algeria and Egypt and 
overall maintenance capex across all of our facilities.
We will increase capital expenditure in 2010 as we 
expand our manufacturing capacity in the MENA 
region to support demand for our global products.
As a result of working capital improvements 
and reduced capital expenditure, net debt decreased  
from $170.9 million as at 31 December 2008 to 
$116.9 million as at 31 December 2009 keeping 
the Group in a very strong financing position. 
Outlook
Hikma should continue to benefit from the overall 
pharmaceutical market growth in the MENA region, 
which we expect to remain higher than the global 
pharmaceutical market. Our share of the MENA 
market should also continue to increase as we further 
penetrate into existing markets, expand into new 
markets and grow our portfolio of own‑ brand and 
in‑ licensed products. There also remains considerable 
scope for us to grow our global Injectables business 
following the significant investments we have made 
in portfolio development, sales and marketing and 
manufacturing capacity. Our US Generics business is 
on a strong footing and we are confident that we can 
maintain the positive momentum we have created  
in this business. Overall for the Group we expect to 
deliver Group sales growth in the low‑ teens in 2010 
and expect gross margin to be broadly in line with  
the improved gross margin we achieved in 2009.

How we ensure that we act responsibly 42  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Overview from Mazen Darwazah, Vice-Chairman
2009 has been a rewarding and productive period  
for our corporate responsibility (“CR”) programme. 
Throughout the year, we have focused on developing 
a long-term, sustainable strategy, which not only 
addresses the very real social issues affecting society 
today but does so in a way that makes sense for our 
business and reflects the core Hikma values. 
Since the Company was founded in 1978, we 
have been committed to honesty, integrity and the 
highest possible standards in everything we do.  
We are dedicated to the welfare and education  
of our employees, committed to the communities  
in which we work and determined to preserve  
and protect the environment in which we operate. 
These principles have guided us for the past 30 years 
and will continue to do so in the future. 
T o that end, we have designed a five-year plan 
taking us from 2010 to 2015. The plan revolves 
around two broad themes – wellbeing and education, 
and four key platforms – our people, our community, 
our environment and global welfare. These have been 
chosen specifically because they combine our very  
real commitment to stakeholders and society with a 
desire to embed CR into the heart of our business.
2009 achievements
Corporate responsibility is and always has been an 
essential part of the Hikma way . Strong commitments  
to our community and the environment have helped 
to make Hikma what it is today – a highly successful 
international pharmaceutical company with a 
reputation for integrity.
Over the last three years we have sought to 
formalise our approach to CR to ensure that it is 
increasingly embedded in the way we conduct 
business. We began this process in 2006 by creating 
a Group-wide CR programme and introducing an 
official Hikma Code of Conduct. The following year, 
we built on that progress and in 2008 established 
a Board-level steering committee and an expanded 
working committee.
In 2009, we increased the number of CR 
Champions across the Group. The champions are 
focused on raising awareness of social, health and 
environmental issues in our business. In employee and 
community matters, we gave particular emphasis to 
four events: the Hikma Global Volunteering Day, ‘You 
are Hikma’, Hikma’ s Day against Breast Cancer and 
Hikma’ s Day against Diabetes. Volunteering is an 
important part of Hikma’ s CR approach and the 
annual Global Volunteering Day focuses each year on 
a different healthcare theme. We also spent time in 
2009 developing and refining the five-year strategy 
for CR, endorsed and supported by our executive  
and non-executive Board members. 
Aligning business and CR
We believe we owe a duty of care towards our 
employees, our customers, our suppliers and the 
wider community. Our commitment to operating 
responsibly has and will continue to differentiate us 
from our competitors. It has helped us to build our 
strong brand and, ultimately, it will help us to drive 
sales and to operate more efficiently.
Developing a long-term sustainable strategy  
that addresses the social issues affecting society today  
in a way that makes sense for our business  
and reflects the core Hikma values

Number of CR Champions Delivering Responsibly
At the end of 2008, we undertook a significant 
review of our CR governance structure in line with 
our ongoing aim of embedding CR throughout the 
Hikma Group and driving the CR programme from 
the Board and senior management to operational 
functions. This year was the first full year of operations 
for the Board-level CR Steering Committee and 
CR Working Committee.
The seniority and breadth of experience that the 
members bring to these committees ensures that 
CR remains focused and aligned to the business. 
Facilitated by the Corporate Communications and 
CR team, the Group is responsible for agreeing strategy , 
endorsing activities, reviewing activity reports and 
assessing progress. This approach provides coherence 
and economies of scale as well as a framework 
to share best practice across our markets.
On the ground, CR Champions work to implement 
our strategy across the Group. At the end of 2009, 
we had a team of ten CR Champions, each dedicated 
to one of our manufacturing facilities. During the 
course of 2010, we will build on this initiative,  
adding two new Champions to the existing team.
These Champions work to deliver initiatives, 
engage with and report to country managers and 
encourage and motivate employees to make CR part 
of their day-to-day operations. All our Champions are 
full time employees with a range of experience and 
expertise, which ensures that CR remains focused 
on business benefit and is embedded in employees’ 
working lives.
Our Champions deliver monthly reports to the CR 
department and their country managers. These 
managers then report back to the Group on progress, 
encouraging diligence and continuity. We are now 
establishing KPIs for senior management to deepen 
their support for CR in their respective markets.
Reporting
We have continued to use the Global Reporting 
Initiative’s G3 guidelines as a benchmark tool. Building 
on our work in previous years, we have focused in 
particular on community investment, environmental 
impacts, employees and labour practices.
Many of our subsidiaries began reporting against 
GRI metrics for the first time in 2009, including Egypt, 
Germany, Italy, Jordan’s APM facility and Saudi Arabia. 
We have also started to use dedicated reporting software, 
underlining our commitment to the GRI approach 
and enhancing comparative reporting in the future.
People
We value our people as our most important asset.  
To successfully grow our business, we need to develop 
and reward our people.
With our commitment to maintaining the  
highest quality standards and cGMP (current good 
manufacturing practices), technical training has 
always been a top priority across the Group. In 2008, 
analysis of GRI data helped us to identify areas of 
need for further training. On this basis, we targeted 
an increase in non-technical training for 2009. In line 
with these targets and in recognition of the important 
role CR plays within the Group, a two-day training 
workshop was held in 2009, focusing on developing 
the champions’ knowledge and understanding of  
CR and discussing future strategic aims. Of course,  
we also maintained our Continuing Education 
Scheme, which supports employees in full funded 
further education programmes.

Health and safety
Health and safety lie at the core of our business. 
We cannot operate successfully and deliver quality 
products without ensuring the health and wellbeing 
of our employees.
Communication of Hikma’ s Health and Safety 
Policy – to meet and, where possible, exceed all the 
labour laws and regulations with regards to workplace 
health and safety in all the countries in which we 
operate – was prioritised during the year. We are 
committed to continuous improvements in health and 
safety and will be working towards the Group-wide 
implementation of OHSAS ISO 18001, the occupational 
health and safety management system, or its 
equivalents in 2010.
Our Health and Safety Policy is becoming more 
widely implemented across the Group. Developed in 
2007 and launched in 2008, the policy involves the 
appointment of an HSE supervisor in each business 
unit. The appointment process continued during 2009.
Health and safety training was offered to all 
employees across the Group in 2009. This was part  
of a commitment made in 2008 and we are proud  
to have achieved this goal. We have also made 
significant progress on absenteeism and occupational 
injury rates. Occupational injury rates were less than  
1 per cent in 2009 and, in many countries, a zero 
rating was achieved. We hope to make further 
improvements in 2010, following the launch  
of an explicit programme targeting zero level 
occupational injuries.
Promoting the health and safety of our employees 
is clearly aligned with our key business objectives – 
to deliver better health to the markets we serve. 
In 2009, our businesses focused on developing a 
strong presence in the growing fields of heart disease, 
diabetes and  
cancer. Sponsoring 
symposia and 
conferences for 
doctors, we have 
helped to build 
a strong knowledge 
base in the  
MENA region.
In 2009, two 
important events  
were organised 
to raise awareness of 
cancer and diabetes 
among our employees 
and our communities 
and to promote 
healthier lifestyles – Hikma’ s Day against Breast 
Cancer and Hikma’ s Day against Diabetes.
The Day against Breast Cancer was a Group-wide 
event with participation from all business units. Free 
breast examination and mammograms were offered 
to female employees in some business units. Other 
initiatives included poster and brochure campaigns, 
awareness e-mails, lectures on prevention and 
fundraising in support of cancer research.
A similar approach was taken with our Day 
against Diabetes. Awareness of the causes and risks 
of diabetes was heightened through lectures and 
poster campaigns at a number of Hikma business 
units. In others, blood sugar analysis tests were offered 
to employees and in the US, employees took part in 
the American Heart Foundation’ s Heart Walk campaign.
Ethics
Hikma is committed to the highest ethical principles 
and we endeavour to ensure that all our employees 
conform to the highest possible standards of integrity 
and honesty.
We are members of the Global Compact, a 
UN-sponsored initiative for businesses committed  
to aligning their operations and strategies with ten 
universally accepted principles in the areas of human 
rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. 
Hikma remains committed to upholding these 
principles and embedding them into its operations. 
In 2009, further steps were taken to train existing 
staff and all new joiners now receive guidance on  
our commitment to the Global Compact as part of 
Occupational injury rates were less than  
1% and in many countries zero.

issued a Communication on Progress report 
underlining our actions to date.
We now audit all our main suppliers with regard 
to their employment practices. The practice was 
initiated two years ago and we constantly seek 
to improve communication with suppliers and 
gain more feedback from them.
We are also making progress with our Code  
of Conduct. In 2009, more than 65% of all 
employees signed the code and it was incorporated 
into the induction process for new employees.  
In 2010 our Code of Conduct will be included  
in performance appraisals.
In 2009, we also updated our “Equal Treatment 
of Employees & Harassment” policy, which states that 
we do not condone favouritism or inequality in any 
shape or form.
In 2009, Hikma Pharmaceuticals was awarded 
the Best Company in an Emerging Market Award at 
the annual Scrip Awards. This award is testament to 
the continued progress the Company is making to 
be a leader in the MENA region across all areas of 
its business including CR.
Community
Active and effective engagement with the community 
is an essential part of our CR strategy.
The Hikma Global Volunteering Day, held in 
April each year, aims to encourage employees across 
the Group to invest time in their local communities. 
The number of participants more than doubled this 
year – from 500 in 2008 to 1,200 in 2009. Aligned 
with our business objectives, the Volunteering Day 
aims to support better health in our local communities. 
This year, staff worldwide participated in a variety of 
charitable activities, including donating blood, cleaning 
hospitals, kindergartens and orphanages and spending 
time with the children, and raising money for research.
Of course, we are active in our communities 
throughout the year through a number of other 
initiatives, including providing funding for students 
in the fields of T echnical Pharmacy and Applied 
Medical Sciences. The time, interest and funding that 
we provide to local students is a real indication of our 
ongoing commitment to the communities in which 
we work. Over the long term, these efforts should 
also help to ensure that we can continue to attract 
well-trained employees in each of the markets in 
which we are operating.
Across the MENA region, Hikma volunteers also 
supported poor local communities, providing financial 
and practical assistance to those in need. In the 
United States, fundraising was undertaken and 
support was given to local homeless groups, 
disadvantaged families and the elderly.
Hikma has also partnered with the Global Fund 
to fight Aids, TB and Malaria. In 2009, the Company 
and the Samih Darwazah Foundation donated the 
seed money to establish the MENA Chapter of the 
Global Fund. This is located in Amman Jordan, and 
will operate across the Middle East and North Africa. 
A board of directors has been selected, an executive 
director has been hired and in 2010, the Chapter will 
launch its first awareness and advocacy campaigns.
Across the Group, we continued through 2009 
to give generously to local causes, donating medicines 
to NGOs and communities in crisis. Our employees 
also volunteered their time to many NGOs worldwide. 46  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009

Environment
Hikma, like every business, has an impact on the 
environment, both locally and globally. We are 
working towards limiting that impact by educating 
our staff and encouraging them to think about their 
effect on the environment in everything they do. 
We are also actively exploring ways in which we 
can reduce carbon emissions across the Group and 
reduce waste, particularly harmful waste.
Hikma’ s Environmental Policy five key pledges:
to integrate our environmental policy across 1. 
the Group;
to reduce our impact on climate change; 2. 
to comply with environmental legislation and 3. 
regulation in every country in which we operate;
to strive for continuous improvement in our 4. 
environmental protection; and
to implement and develop ISO 14001 or its 5. 
equivalent at every production site across 
the Company.
In 2008, we made good progress in this area, 
obtaining the ISO 14001 certification at our AMC 
facility and our Hikma Jordan facility. In 2009, both 
facilities gained the continuity certificate. In 2010, we 
are committed to continuing our work on ISO 14001 
and exploring more international accreditations.
GRI data collection continued to heighten 
awareness of energy usage in 2009 and helped  
to identify ways to drive a reduction in energy 
consumption across our business units. The collection 
and analysis of data improved considerably in  
2009 and we expect to report further progress  
in 2010.
In many units, real advances have been made in 
energy and water consumption since 2008. In Algeria, 
electricity consumption fell 11% year on year from 
1.5 million KWh to 1.3 million KWh while diesel 
consumption was 21% lower at 57,000 litres over the 
same period. The business also intends to drive forward 
a more aggressive recycling programme and incinerate 
hazardous waste in a more effective manner.
Hikma Jordan and AMC reduced diesel 
consumption by at least 10%, thanks to a concerted 
effort to be more energy efficient.
Hikma Jordan’ s water consumption fell dramatically , 
from 44,674 cubic metres to 27,168 cubic metres, 
Portugal reduced water consumption by 15% to 
74,431 cubic metres and Saudi Arabia cut water 
consumption by 16% to 47,430 cubic metres.
Across the Group, Company vehicles have been 
upgraded to more environmentally efficient options. 
In addition, there is an ongoing and regularly 
reinforced awareness campaign, which stresses 
Hikma’ s desire to reduce its environmental impact 
and stresses the part that each and every employee 
can play in this endeavour. We will be reporting back 
on our progress to all our stakeholders.
Following initial work in 2009, Hikma will be 
assessing its carbon emissions in Jordan during 2010. 
This analysis is based on the Carbon Disclosure Project 
framework and will provide valuable insights across 
the Group on how to measure our emissions and  
take steps to reduce our emissions as a Group in the 
coming years.
Moving forward – our five-year plan
We have designed a five-year plan taking us from 2010 
to 2015. This revolves around two broad themes, 
wellbeing and education. Wellbeing is intrinsically 
linked to our role in the pharmaceutical industry and 
our core duty of care to those around us. Education 
is integral to the effective development of the 
Company and the communities we serve.
These themes will be a reference point for our 
CR efforts over the next five years and within this 
framework, we have created four key areas of focus: 
our people, our community, our environment and 
global welfare, which reflects our awareness of the 
need to enhance health and wellbeing wherever we 
operate and wherever we do business. While we have 
implicitly recognised these areas as being of crucial 
importance in the past, explicit recognition will, 
we believe, allow us to reinforce our efforts to 
drive CR internally and on the world stage. 47

Combined code
The Board is responsible for, and committed to, meeting the standards of 
good corporate governance set out in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance published by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2008 
(the “Combined Code”) and the corporate governance principles  
set out in the Markets Law of the Dubai Financial Services Authority  
(the “Markets Law”) (together the “Corporate Governance Principles”).  
This report, the Audit Committee report set out on pages 57 to 59 and 
the Remuneration Committee Report set out on pages 63 to 74 describe 
how the Board applied the Corporate Governance Principles during the  
year under review. 
The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Markets 
Law require the Group to report on their application of the principles of 
good governance and the extent of their compliance with the Corporate 
Governance Principles. This statement provides details on how the Group 
has applied these principles.
During the year under review, the Company applied the principles  
set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code, including both the main 
principles and the supporting principles, and the Corporate Governance 
Principles. At the year end the Company was in full compliance with  
the Corporate Governance Principles.
The Board
The Group is led and controlled by the Board of Directors.  
The Board is responsible for setting the strategic direction and 
monitoring the financial performance of the Group against its targets. 
The Board also promotes good corporate governance within the Group, 
and ensures that the Group meets its responsibilities to shareholders, 
employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders. There is a  
formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board for consideration  
and decision, which is reviewed and, if necessary updated, annually.  
This includes approval of strategic plans, approval of financial statements 
and the annual Group budget, approval of material investment decisions, 
acquisitions and divestments, and review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’ s systems of internal control. 
The Board delegates its powers to the CEO who is responsible for 
delivering the company’ s strategic objectives and is assisted in this task  
by the executive management team. 
The senior management team who report directly to the CEO  
meet with him to discuss strategy and key objectives for their areas of 
responsibility. The CEO reports on operational progress in these areas to 
the Board and the key senior management team present to the Board, as 
appropriate, to highlight and debate developments in their business. 
Composition of the Board
The Board comprises eight members, half of whom are independent: a 
Non-Executive Chairman, five Non-Executive Directors, one of whom is 
not classified as independent for the purposes of the Combined Code 
and two Executive Directors. The Board considers the independence of 
the Non-Executive Directors on an annual basis during the corporate 
governance review that takes place in December each year.
The names of the Directors and their biographical details are set out on 
pages 50 and 51. The Chairman and the Executive Vice-Chairman were 
appointed to the Board on the incorporation of the Company on  
8 September 2005. The Chief Executive Officer was appointed to the 
Board on 1 July 2007, and save for Ronald Goode, who joined the  
Board on 12 December 2006, each of the Non-Executive Directors  
joined the Board on 14 October 2005. The Non-Executive Directors have 
diverse business backgrounds, skills and experience and as such bring 
independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance, 
resources, key appointments, standards of conduct and other matters 
presented to the Board. In 2010, Ronald Goode offers himself for 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting.
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate, 
and the Board has approved a statement of their responsibilities in 
writing. These guidelines are reviewed annually by the Board. Prior to  
the appointment of the current Chief Executive Officer the Board 
undertook consultation with its major shareholders and external advisers 
regarding the continuation of Samih Darwazah in his role as Chairman. 
The Board concluded that his former executive role should not prevent 
him from remaining as Chairman, especially as he has an in-depth 
understanding of the Group and the business and is able to provide a 
valuable contribution in his capacity as Non-Executive Chairman. 
The Board does not classify Ali Al-Husry as an independent Director 
for the purposes of the Combined Code as a result of his involvement 
with Darhold Limited, the Company’ s largest shareholder. He was also a 
Director of Hikma Pharmaceuticals Limited prior to the Company’ s listing. 
However, he continues to bring broad financial experience to the Board 
as well as a detailed knowledge of the MENA region which is significant 
to the Group’ s business.
The Senior Independent Director is Sir David Rowe-Ham who remains 
available to shareholders should they have concerns that they do not 
wish to raise with the Chairman. Sir David is also Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee and is responsible for chairing the meetings  
of Non-Executive Directors conducted without the presence of the 
Chairman or executive management. 
The Board continues to discuss its composition and the skills and 
business experience of its members. All of the directors believe in the 
necessity for challenge and debate in the boardroom and consider that 
the Board relationships encourage honest and open debate with the 
Executive Directors. Furthermore the Non-Executive Directors maintain 
strong relationships outside the timetabled board meetings with  
senior executive management and visit company subsidiaries regularly.  
They believe that the Board’ s decision making process is inclusive,  
and is not dominated by any individual or group of individuals.
Information flow
Board and committee papers are circulated to members in advance  
of the meetings. In addition to formal meetings, the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors maintain regular contact with each other  
and executive management outside the formal Board timetable.  
The Chairman also holds informal meetings with Non-Executive  
Directors without the executive management present to discuss issues 
affecting the Group. Senior executives attend Board meetings and make 
presentations on the results and strategies of their business units.
Corporate Governance report 55
This year the Board received presentations from all members of the  
senior management team on their areas of responsibility. Strategic 
presentations were received on human resources, sales, compliance, 
supply chain management, finance and operations. Each of the senior 
executives has been scheduled to update the Board on their initiatives 
during the course of 2010.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that good board procedures are 
followed and for advising the Board through the Chairman on all matters 
of corporate governance. The appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board. To the extent necessary, the 
Directors are able to obtain independent professional advice at the 
Company’ s expense in the performance of their duties as directors.
Board T raining/Continuing Professional Development
The Directors maintain a close dialogue between Board meetings, 
ensuring that, amongst other things, the Non-Executive Directors are  
kept up to date with major developments in the Group’ s business.  
The Board is also encouraged to visit the major business units and  
to meet the senior management teams in order to facilitate a better 
understanding of the key issues facing the business. In the year under 
review, the July Board meeting was held at the Group’s facilities in 
Portugal where the Board had access to the senior management team  
and reviewed the construction and progress of the new lyophilisation 
plant. The Company’ s brokers and financial advisers presented industry 
and market updates to the board four times in 2009. These sessions are 
in addition to the written briefings on areas of regulatory and legislative 
change presented at each Board meeting in the form of the Corporate 
Governance Paper. This year briefings took place on the Companies  
Act 2006, the Walker Review, the FRC Review of Combined Code,  
Listing Rules Review and the Bribery Bill. The Non-Executive Directors  
have attended a number of training sessions specifically aimed at 
Non-Executive Directors addressing the Walker Review and other 
corporate governance topics.
Board meetings
During the year under review the Board held eight scheduled meetings 
and one unscheduled meeting. The Company Secretary attended all 
Board Meetings and Committee Meetings. A table showing attendance 
at these meetings is set out below. T o the extent directors are unable to 
attend additional meetings called on short notice, or are prevented from 
doing so by prior commitments, they receive and read the papers for 
consideration at that meeting, relay their comments in advance and, 
where necessary, follow up with the Chairman on the decisions taken.
Board performance evaluation 
The Non-Executive Directors, other than Ronald Goode, were re-elected 
on 14 May 2009, having first been elected by shareholders on 25 May 
2006. Said Darwazah was appointed on 1 July 2007 and elected by 
shareholders on 15 May 2008. Ronald Goode who was appointed on  
12 December 2006 will be seeking re-election by shareholders at the 
AGM on 13 May 2010. He was first elected by shareholders at the AGM 
on 6 June 2007. All Directors are subject to re-election at intervals of  
no more than three years. Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an 
initial term of three years, which can be renewed and extended for not 
more than two further three-year terms.
As required by the Combined Code, a formal evaluation of the 
performance of the Board, the Chairman, the Committee Chairmen  
and the individual Non-Executive Directors was undertaken during the 
period under review. 
During 2009 the Board reviewed its approach to Board evaluations 
and approved a three year evaluation process, which includes seeking 
external consultation every third year. In 2009 the Board evaluation  
was managed internally by the Senior Independent Director. In 2010  
the Board will continue to review its performance internally with  
the assistance of a consultant and in 2011 it will seek an externally 
moderated evaluation. 
This year the Board refreshed its approach to the appraisal process 
using a new format of questions specifically targeted on the quality  
of decision making and information made available to the Board.  
As in previous years the evaluation process was led by the Senior 
Independent Director, who met with each of the Directors and the 
Committee Chairmen to undertake an appraisal of the performance  
of the Board, its Committees and each of the individual Directors.  
The results of the evaluation process and feedback were reviewed  
with the Chairman and formed part of his appraisal of the overall 
effectiveness of the Board and its members. Overall the review concluded 
that the Board functions well, with good communication, and with  
issues raised in good time to allow for consultation, debate and  
effective decision-making. Recommendations were made regarding  
the enhancement of some of the information provided to the Board  
and amendments to the Board timetable and these are being 
implemented in 2010.
In addition to the matters set out above in respect of all Directors,  
the Senior Independent Director met with the Non-Executive Directors  
to undertake a formal appraisal of the performance of the Chairman.  
This review addressed the effectiveness of his leadership, the setting  
of the Board agenda, communication with shareholders, internal 
communication and Board efficiency. The Non-Executives concluded  
that the Chairman gave clear leadership and direction to the Board,  
and where necessary implemented changes and managed the agenda  
to reflect the changing business environment in 2009.

maintains three committees - the Audit Committee, Nomination 
Committee and Remuneration Committee. 
Each of the three Combined Code committees has terms of 
reference, which were reviewed during the year. Copies are published

regular reports of the Committees’ business to the Board.
Other Committees
The Group also has an Ethics Committee and a Corporate Social 
Responsibility Committee, which draw their members from the Board 
and senior management of the Group.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee consists of two independent Non-Executive 
Directors – Sir David Rowe-Ham (Committee Chairman) and Michael 
Ashton – and the Executive Vice Chairman, Mazen Darwazah.  
As required by the Corporate Governance Principles, the majority  
of the members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive 
Directors and an independent Non-Executive Director holds the 
Chairmanship of the Committee. 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for succession planning 
and for ensuring that all appointments to the Board are made on 
objective criteria. In accordance with its terms of reference, the 
Committee is required to take into account the skills, knowledge  
and experience of the Board in making its decisions and is able to use 
external search firms or open advertising to compile shortlists of 
candidates for the Board. It is also charged with reviewing the 
appropriateness of the size, structure and composition of the Board.
The Nomination Committee met twice during the year, with full 
attendance. It met to discuss and review succession planning and to 
discuss the performance evaluation and appraisal system for the Board. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of the Company’ s four 
independent Non-Executive Directors – Michael Ashton (Committee 
Chairman), Breffni Byrne, Sir David Rowe-Ham and Ronald Goode.  
The Remuneration Committee therefore complies with the membership 
requirements laid out in the Corporate Governance Principles.
The Committee met six times during the year with full attendance.  
The Committee is responsible for setting and reviewing executive 
remuneration and that of the Company Secretary and is able to take 
advice from external consultants when required. A full report on the role 
of the Remuneration Committee is set out in the Remuneration 
Committee Report on page 63. During the year under review, there has 
been close co-operation between the new corporate Head of HR and the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee to ensure that executive 
remuneration policies and structure are appropriate and adequately 
reflect the remuneration structures and policies in place for the Group’ s 
employees as a whole. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of four independent Non-Executive 
Directors – Breffni Byrne (Committee Chairman), Michael Ashton,  
Sir David Rowe-Ham and Ronald Goode. The Audit Committee therefore 
complies with the membership requirements laid out in the Corporate 
Governance Principles. 
The Committee met eight times during the year with full attendance. 
A full report of the role of the Audit Committee and details of how  
it carried out its duties is set out in the Audit Committee report on  
pages 57 to 59.
Ethics Committee
The Ethics Committee is chaired by Ronald Goode and draws its 
members from the Board and senior management across the Group.  
The Ethics Committee meets on an ad hoc basis to respond to issues as 
they arise across all areas of the Group’ s business. Thus, the Committee  
is responsible for the oversight of all of statements and policies on ethics, 
conduct, values and principles within the Group. 
CR Steering Committee
The CR Steering Committee is chaired by the Executive Vice-Chairman, 
Mazen Darwazah and draws its members from the Board (Ronald Goode)

reviewing the strategy and direction of the Group’ s social, community 
and environmental programme. The Committee is also responsible  
for the oversight of the CR Working Committee to undertake the 
implementation of the Group’ s CR programme.
Internal Control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’ s systems of internal 
control and risk management and has complied with the requirements  
of the Corporate Governance Principles in establishing a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks the Group 
faces. The Board is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of these 
systems on an ongoing basis and, at least annually, conducting a formal 
review of the Group’ s policies on internal control. The system of internal 
control provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 57
Governance and financial results
The key elements are as follows:
a reporting structure with clear procedures, authorisation limits, 
segregation of duties and delegated authorities;
annual budgets and updated forecasting for the Group that identify  
risks and opportunities which are reviewed and approved by the Board;
a comprehensive system of internal financial reporting which includes 
regular comparison of financial results and key performance indicators 
against budget and forecast, informed by management commentary;
a clearly defined process for controlling capital expenditure and other 
financial commitments, including appropriate authorisation levels, which 
are monitored and approved by the Board as appropriate;
written policies and procedures for all material functional areas with 
specific responsibility allocated to individual managers. 
During the year under review, Ernst & Young continued its management 
and execution of the Group’ s internal audit function on a global basis 
under a three year contract which commenced in 2009. This involves  
a risk-driven approach to internal audit which is overseen by the Audit 
Committee. The internal audit process focuses on reviewing areas of 
business risk, internal controls, financial reporting and other systems in 
the Company’ s main subsidiaries and at the corporate level, with regular 
reports of its findings made to the Audit Committee. Ernst & Young have 
direct access to the Audit Committee and the Board Chairman.
The Board confirms that, in accordance with the requirements of  
the Corporate Governance Principles, a review of the effectiveness of  
the Group’ s systems of internal controls was conducted during the year 
under review. 
Whistleblowing
The Group Whistleblowing Policy contains arrangements for the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Senior Independent Director,  
and Ronald Goode (as a US-based member of the Audit Committee)  
to receive, in confidence, complaints on accounting, risk issues,  
internal control and other instances of allegedly improper behaviour  
by Group employees.
Insurance
The Company maintains an appropriate level of Directors’ and Officers’ 
insurance in respect of action taken against Directors.

reviewed and approved by the Board. 58  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Composition
Hikma’ s Audit Committee comprises four members – Breffni Byrne, 
Michael Ashton, Sir David Rowe-Ham, and Ronald Goode – all of  
whom are independent Non-Executive Directors, and whose biographical 
details are set out on page 51. The Committee is chaired by Breffni Byrne, 
who is a chartered accountant and who is considered by the  
Board to have recent and relevant financial experience. No members  
of the Committee have links with the Company’ s external auditors.  
The Company therefore considers that it complies with the Corporate 
Governance Principles regarding the composition of the Audit 
Committee. The Committee Chairman receives additional remuneration 
to compensate him for his additional responsibilities.
Responsibilities 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities 
with regard to financial reporting, external and internal audit and internal 
control. This includes reviewing the Company’ s annual report and 
financial statements, interim report, Interim Management Statements 
and trading updates, reviewing and monitoring the extent of non-audit 
work undertaken by external auditors, and monitoring the effectiveness 
and output of the Company’ s internal audit activities, internal controls 
and risk management systems. The Audit Committee is also responsible 
for making recommendations to the Board on the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of the external auditors, as well as the 
effectiveness of the audit process. The ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the annual report and financial statements  
and the half-yearly reports remains with the Board. The Board has also 
delegated responsibility for the operation of the Company’ s policies on 
monitoring directors’ conflicts of interest to the Audit Committee and 
thus has been included in the Audit Committee’ s terms of reference. 
Meetings
The Audit Committee met eight times during the year under review, with 
the Chief Financial Officer and the Company Secretary in attendance.  
The Audit Committee reviewed the 2008 annual report & financial 
statements, the 2009 interim report, the two Interim Management 
Statements released by the Company and each of the regulatory 
statements made by the Company in respect of trading and results issued 
during the year. The Committee also reviewed and approved the audit 
plans for 2010 for both internal and external auditors and the related 
scope of internal audit work to be undertaken. The Committee reviewed 
the effectiveness of the Group’ s internal controls and risk management 
processes and the disclosures made in the annual report & financial 
statements on these matters and reported on these to the Board.  
The Committee also reviewed its own terms of reference and general 
effectiveness, both specifically and in the context of the overall annual 
review of corporate governance matters conducted by the Company. 
The Group’ s external auditors, Deloitte LLP , attended four Audit 
Committee meetings for the purposes of presenting their 2008 audit 
results and findings, the results of the 2009 interim review and their audit 
plan for 2010. The internal auditors, Ernst & Young presented the results 
of their audit programme for 2009 to the Audit Committee together 
with their proposed audit plan for 2010. The Audit Committee continues 
to review the response by management, proposed action plans and  
the overall effectiveness of the internal audit function. In accordance  
with the Combined Code, the Audit Committee also met with the 
Group’ s external auditor and internal auditor without executive 
management present. 
In addition, during 2009, the Audit Committee Chairman met  
with external auditors in the USA and Portugal. The Audit Committee 
Chairman also met with Ernst & Young in Jordan to discuss the results  
of the 2009 internal audit programme. 
Attendance of members at Audit Committee meetings is shown  
on page 55 of the Corporate Governance report.
External auditors
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, implementation 
and monitoring of the Group’ s policy on external audit. Oversight and 
responsibility for monitoring the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors lies with the Audit Committee, and day-to-day 
responsibility with the Chief Financial Officer. The Audit Committee is  
also the point of primary contact for contact with the Board. The Group 
has adopted a policy in relation to the provision of non-audit services  
by the external auditors. The policy also sets out the categories of 
non-audit services which the external auditors will and will not be 
allowed to provide to the Group.
In line with audit independence requirements the external auditor 
does not provide services such as information system design and 
valuation or advocacy work which could be considered to be inconsistent 
with the audit role. In addition, audit-related and non-related services 
provided by the external auditor in excess of certain monetary limits 
require prior approval by the Audit Committee. The Committee has 
reviewed the non-audit services provided by the external auditor and  
is satisfied that the nature of these services has not compromised  
the auditor’ s independence. 
Fees paid in respect of audit, audit-related and non-audit services  
are outlined in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Audit-related services are services carried out by the external auditor by 
virtue of its role as auditor and principally include assurance-related work 
and accounting advice. 
A policy has also been adopted whereby prior approval by the Audit 
Committee is required before the recruitment of a senior member of the 
audit team or the recruitment of an employee of the external auditors to 
a senior finance position within the Group.
It is also the Committee’ s policy to consider every year whether there 
should be an audit tender process and whether using auditors from one 
audit network continues to enhance the quality of the audit.
Corporate Governance report continued 59
Governance and financial results
T o fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the external 
auditors, the Audit Committee reviewed:
the external auditors’ plan for the current year, noting the role of the 
senior statutory audit partner, who signs the audit report and who, in 
accordance with professional rules, has not held office for more than  
five years, and any changes in the key audit staff;
the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit relationship;
the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external  
auditors; and
the past service of the auditors who were first appointed in for the  
year ending 2004.
The Committee has considered the likelihood of a withdrawal of the 
auditor from the market and noted that there are no contractual 
obligations to restrict the choice of external auditors. 
T o assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the Audit Committee 
reviewed:
the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors’ independence  
and objectivity;
the external auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and any 
variations from the plan;
the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in their handling  
of the key accounting and audit judgements; and
the content of the external auditor’ s reporting on internal control.
Overview
Consequently, the Audit Committee concludes that it has acted in 
accordance with its terms of reference and ensured the independence 
and reviewed the effectiveness of the external auditors. The Audit 
Committee also recommends to the Board that Deloitte LLP be 
reappointed. The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available  
at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions on the work  
of the Committee.
Dialogue with shareholders
Ongoing communication with shareholders is a high priority.  
The Company undertakes a continuous programme of meetings with 
institutional shareholders in the UK, Europe, the United States and the 
MENA region. This programme includes but is not limited to one-on-one 
meetings, investor days, conference calls and presentations at investor 
conferences. In addition the Company makes formal presentations  
at the time of its annual and interim results which are webcast and 
disseminated on the Company’ s website. The Chief Executive Officer, 
Executive Vice-Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and other senior 
corporate executives have all participated in the investor programme 
during the period under review.
The Senior Independent Director and Chairman met with institutional 
investor protection committees who requested meetings during the year 
to discuss Corporate Governance matters, the business as a whole and  
its management.
The principal ongoing communication with shareholders is through 
the publication of the Company’ s Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
Interim Results and Interim Management Statements, together with  
the opportunity to question the Board and Committees at the Annual 
General Meeting. Shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM  
and if unable to do so are encouraged to vote by proxy. Copies of 
presentations made at the AGM are available on the website after the 
event together with the results of the voting. The full Board is present  
at the AGM. The Company maintains a website (www.hikma.com) 
containing financial and other information which is updated regularly. 
Additionally, the Company presents a balanced view of the Group’ s 
performance and prospects through the release of appropriate press 
announcements and other updates. 
The Board is kept updated on the views of shareholders and the 
market in general through the feedback from the investor meeting 
programme and results presentations. Analysts’ reports are circulated to 
the Board members together with monthly Investor Relations reports.  
The Investor Relations Director also presents to the Board to provide 
feedback from institutional investors.
Procedures to deal with conflict of interests
The Company has implemented procedures to deal with directors’ 
conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest. Responsibility has 
been delegated to the Audit Committee to operate, monitor and review 
the procedures, which have operated effectively during the year. 60  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Directors’ report
The Directors are pleased to present their report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Business Review
The company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to set out a fair 
review of the business during the year and a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Company, noting the performance and 
development of the Company during the year and the position at the 
year end. The information that fulfils these requirements and which is 
incorporated in this report by reference, is included in the following 
sections of the Annual Report: 
a review of the business and strategy and expected future developments 
is set out in the Chairman’ s statement on pages 6 and 7, the Chief 
Executive’ s Review on pages 12 to 15 and the Business and Financial 
Review on pages 28 to 36; 
the principal risks and uncertainties are set out on pages 37 to 39 and 
financial risks are described on page 39;
key financial performance indicators are described on page 28;
information on environmental, social and community issues is set out  
in our Corporate Responsibility report on pages 42 to 47; 
the principal operating subsidiaries are set out on page 131;
the Corporate Governance report is set out on pages 54 to 59.
Principal activity
The principal activities of the Group are the development, manufacture 
and marketing of a broad range of generic and in-licensed 
pharmaceutical products in solid, semi-solid, liquid and injectable final 
dosage forms. Hikma’ s operations are conducted through three business 
segments: Branded Pharmaceuticals, Injectable Pharmaceuticals, and 
Generic Pharmaceuticals. The majority of Hikma’ s operations are in  
the MENA region, the United States and Europe. 
The Group’ s net sales, gross profit and operating profit are shown by 
business segment in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Results and dividends
The Group’ s profit for the year attributable to shareholders in 2009  
was $78 million (2008: $57 million). The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 6.5 cents per share (approximately 4 pence) (2008: 4.0 cents). 
The proposed final dividend will be paid on 27 May 2010 to shareholders 
on the register on 16 April 2010, subject to approval at the Annual 
General Meeting on 13 May 2010.
An interim dividend of 4.5 cents per share was paid on 16 October 
2009 (approximately 2.8 pence per ordinary share) (2008: 3.5 cents) 
which together with the final dividend, will make a total of 11.0 cents  
per share for the period (2008: 7.5 cents)
Directors and their interests
The names of the Directors as at the date of this report, together with 
details of their roles, backgrounds and abilities, are set out in the 
Directors’ biographies on pages 50 and 51. Details of the independence  
of Non-Executive Directors are set out in the Corporate Governance  
report on page 54.
The Executive and Non-Executive Directors served the Company 
throughout the year. At the 2010 Annual General Meeting, Ronald 
Goode will retire in accordance with Article 104 of the Articles of 
Association and, being eligible, will offer himself for re-election.  
The explanatory notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting sets  
out why the Board believes Ronald Goode should be re-elected. 
Details of Directors’ share-based incentives and interests in the 
ordinary shares of the company are provided in the Remuneration 
Committee Report on pages 67 to 74.
Creditor payment policy
The Company’ s policy, which is also applied by the Group, is to settle 
terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of each 
transaction, ensure that suppliers are made aware of and abide by the 
terms of payment. Trade creditors of the company at 31 December 2009 
were equivalent to 63 days’ purchases (2008: 48 days), based on the 
average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Charitable and political contributions
During the year the Group made charitable donations of approximately 
$1.2 million (2008: $2.4 million), principally to local charities serving  
the communities in which the Group operates. Donations of medicines 
accounted for approximately $108,000 (2008: $1.4 million) of total 
donations made.
The Group does not make political donations.
Research and Development (R & D)
The Group’ s investment in Research & Development during 2009 
represented 2.6% of group revenue (2008: 3.8%). Further details on  
the Group’ s R&D activities can be found on page 34.
Going concern
Although the current economic conditions may affect short-term  
demand for the Company’ s products, as well as place pressure on our 
customers and suppliers in terms of liquidity issues, the Directors believe 
that the Group’ s geographic spread, product diversity and large customer 
and supplier base substantially mitigate these risks. In addition, the Group 
operates in the relatively defensive generic pharmaceuticals industry 
which we expect to be less affected compared to other industries that  
are subject to greater cyclical changes.
The Group has $378 million of banking facilities of which  
$193 million were undrawn as at 31 December 2009. These facilities  
are well diversified across the operating subsidiaries of the Group and are 
with a number of financial institutions. 44% of the Group’ s short term 
and undrawn long-term facilities are of committed nature. See Notes 24, 
27 and 29 for details. The Directors continue to expect the short-term 
facilities to be renewed upon maturity. In addition the Group maintained 
cash balances of $68.0 million as at 31 December 2009. The Group’ s 
forecasts, taking into account reasonable possible changes in trading 
performance, facility renewal sensitivities and maturities of long-term 
debt, show that the Group should be able to operate well within the 
levels of its facilities and their related covenants.  61
Governance and financial results
After making enquiries, the Directors believe that the Group is adequately 
placed to manage its business and financing risks successfully despite  
the current uncertain economic outlook. The Directors have formed a 
judgement that there is reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. The Directors therefore continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Capital structure 
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with 
movements in the issued share capital during the year can be found  
in Note 31 to the financial statements. The Company has one class of 
Ordinary Shares which carries no right to fixed income. Each share  
carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.  
As at 31 December 2009 the Company had 191,627,607 shares of  
10 pence each in issue. During 2009 the Company issued 2,390,000 
ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of options under the Hikma 
Pharmaceuticals PLC 2004 Stock Option Plan.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding or on the 
transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions  
of the Company’ s Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.  
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the 
Company’ s shares that may have resulted in restrictions on the transfer  
of securities or on voting rights. No person has any special rights with 
regard to the control of the Company’ s share capital and all issued  
shares are fully paid.
Details of any significant shareholdings in the Company can be found 
on page 61 of this report.
Details of the employee share schemes are set out in Note 36 to the 
financial statements. Shares are also held by the Hikma Pharmaceuticals 
Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) and are detailed in Note 33 to the 
financial statements. The EBT has waived its right to vote on the shares it 
holds and also to its entitlement to a dividend. No other shareholder has 
waived the right to a dividend. 
At the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2009, the Directors  
were authorised to issue relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £6,320,227, and to be empowered to allot equity securities 
for cash on a non pre-emptive basis up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £948,034, at any time up to 30 June 2010. The Directors propose to 
renew these authorities at the Annual General Meeting to be held on  
13 May 2010 for a further year. In the year ahead, other than in respect 
of the Company’ s obligations to satisfy rights granted to employees 
under its various share-based incentive arrangements, the Directors have 
no present intention of issuing any of the authorised but unissued share 
capital of the Company. 
The powers of the directors are determined by its Articles of Association, 
the Combined Code and other relevant UK legislation. At the AGM on 
13 May 2010 the Directors will propose, for shareholder approval, the 
adoption of new Articles of Association to take effect from the close  
of the meeting. The amendments to the Articles are to reflect the 
changes to English Company law due to the final amendments to the 
Companies Act 2006 which took effect in October 2009. Full details  
of the amendments to the Articles are listed below. Directors powers  
are detailed in the Corporate Governance Report starting on page 54.  
The Articles give the Directors the power to appoint and remove directors 
and they also provide for re-election at three yearly intervals. The power to 
issue and allot shares contained in the Articles, are subject to shareholder 
approval at each annual general meeting. The Articles, which are 
available on the website, may only be amended by special resolution  
of the shareholders.
Significant Agreements and Contracts
Due to the nature of the Group’ s business, members of the Group are 
party to agreements that could alter or be terminated upon a change  
or control of the Group following a takeover. However, none of these 
agreements is individually deemed to be significant in terms of its 
potential impact on the business of the Group taken as a whole.  
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company 
and its directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss  
of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
There are no persons, with whom the Company has contractual or 
other arrangements, who are deemed to be essential to the business  
of the Company.
Pre-emptive issue of Ordinary Shares
During the year under review, and in the period since 1 November 2005, 
the date of the Company’ s IPO, the Company did not issue any Ordinary 
Shares pursuant to an authority given by shareholders at annual general 
meeting to issue Ordinary Shares for cash on a non pre-emptive basis, 
other than in respect of the placing undertaken on 17 January 2008. 
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for 
the benefit of its directors. These indemnities are uncapped in amount in 
relation to losses and liabilities which directors may incur to third parties 
in the course of the performance of their duties. 
Substantial shareholdings
As at the date of this document, the Company had been notified 
pursuant to sections 89A to 89L of the Financial Services and Markets  
Act 2000 and Rule 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the 
UKLA of the following interests in the voting rights attaching to shares  
in the capital of the Company: 
Name of shareholder Number of shares Percentage held
Darhold Limited* 57,183,028 29.82%
* Messrs Samih Darwazah, Said Darwazah, Mazen Darwazah and Ali Al-Husry, each being  
a Director and shareholder of the Company, are shareholders in the capital of Darhold Limited.  
Samih Darwazah, Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah are also Directors of Darhold Limited.
Substantial Shareholdings 62  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
The T akeover Code – Rule 9 
At the Annual General Meeting held on 14 May 2009, a vote of the 
independent shareholders of the Company approved the award of up  
to an aggregate of 200,000 ordinary shares pursuant to the Company’ s 
2006 Long T erm Incentive Plan to Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah 
(the “LTIP Holders”) and 3,000 ordinary shares pursuant to the 
Management Incentive Plan to Hana Ramadan. Because of the 
relationship of the LTIP Holders with Darhold Limited, who at the  
time of the Annual General Meeting held 57,183,028 Ordinary Shares  
(at 7 April 2009 representing 29.82% of the issued share capital of the 
Company, and as at 16 March 2010 being the latest practicable date 
prior to the publication of this document, holding 57,183,028 Ordinary 
Shares, representing 29.82% of the issued share capital of the 
Company), each of the LTIP Holders and MIP holder (together with 
certain other identified individuals at that date) was treated as acting  
in concert with Darhold Limited for the purposes of the T akeover Code 
(the “Concert Party”). As at 7 April 2009, the Concert Party held, in 
aggregate, interests in 66,097,758 Ordinary Shares in the capital of 
Hikma (then representing 34.86% of the then issued share capital of  
the Company). As at 16 March 2010 being the latest practicable date 
prior to the publication of this document, the Concert Party held, in 
aggregate, interests in 65,878,430 ordinary shares in the capital of  
Hikma (representing 34.354% of the then issued share capital  
of the Company). On full exercise of the options under the Hikma 
Pharmaceuticals 2004 Stock Option Plan (the “2004 Plan”) and full 
vesting of the LTIP and MIP awards, the Concert Party would potentially 
have, in aggregate, interests in 66,392,930 shares in the capital of the 
Company (representing 34.53% of the enlarged issued share capital  
of the Company, on the basis that no Ordinary Shares were issued  
other than pursuant to the exercise of such options or vesting of LTIP  
and MIP awards). 
During the period from the Annual General Meeting in 2009 to  
16 March 2010, the LTIP and MIP awards’ holders together with other 
members of the Concert Party who hold options over ordinary shares 
pursuant to the 2004 Plan (the “Option Holders”) have exercised, in 
aggregate, options over 664,000 Ordinary Shares in the capital of the 
Company, of which 35,000 Ordinary Shares were sold immediately  
upon exercise, 480,000 Ordinary Shares were retained and 100,000  
were retained but subsequently disposed of by the option holder.
Auditors 
Each person who was a Director of the Company at the date when this 
report was approved confirms that: 
so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’ s auditors are unaware; and 
the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a 
Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’ s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with 
the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office  
as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at Regus,  
2nd Floor, Berkeley Square House, Berkeley Square, London W1J 6BD, 
United Kingdom on Thursday, 13 May 2010, starting at 10.30 a.m.  
The Notice convening the meeting is given in a separate document 
accompanying this document, and includes a commentary on the 
business of the AGM, and notes to help shareholders exercise their  
rights at the meeting. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination committees will be at the Annual General Meeting to  
answer questions from shareholders.

Governance and financial results
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Large & Medium-
Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, 
(the “Regulations”). The report also meets the relevant requirements of 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the 
Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the 
Combined Code and the Markets Law relating to directors’ remuneration. 
As required by the Regulations, an advisory resolution to approve this 
report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company 
at which the financial statements will be approved. 
The auditors are required to report on the”auditable part” of this 
report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
the Regulations. The report is therefore divided into separate sections for 
unaudited and audited information. 
Unaudited Information 
Remuneration Committee 
The Directors who were members of the Committee during the year 
under review are set out on page 56 of the Directors’ report.
The responsibility for the establishment of a remuneration policy and 
its cost is a matter for the full Board, on the advice of the Remuneration 
Committee. The ongoing recommendations of the Remuneration 
Committee have been approved without amendment by the Board for 
submission to shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy  
on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management and for 
determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive 
Directors. The Remuneration Committee members have no personal 
financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided,  
no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no 
day-to-day involvement in running the business.
 
The Remuneration Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Chairman on matters 
relating to Directors’ performance and remuneration in respect of the 
period under review. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Executive 
Vice Chairman and General Counsel may attend meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee by invitation except when their individual 
remuneration arrangements are discussed. No Director takes part in 
discussions relating to his own remuneration or benefits. As detailed 
below, during the year the Remuneration Committee received independent 
advice on executive compensation from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .  
No services other than those detailed in this report were provided to the 
Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the year under review. 
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written 
terms of reference which describe the full remit of the Committee’s role 
described. The terms of reference are available on the Company’s website 
or on request by shareholders in writing from the Company Secretary 
whose contact details are set out on page 129 of this Annual Report. 
Philosophy behind Remuneration Committee’s approach
The Company’s remuneration policy is designed to encourage, reward 
and retain executives and the Remuneration Committee believes that 
shareholders’ interests are best served by remuneration packages which 
have a large emphasis on performance related pay, thus encouraging 
executives to focus on delivering the Group’ s business strategy.  
By providing meaningful incentives to executives the Company’ s  
policy seeks to ensure that the appropriate balance between fixed  
and performance related pay is maintained.
During 2009 the Hikma Group undertook a review of Company 
remuneration to ensure that the overall remuneration practices achieved 
the strategic aims of the Group and to confirm and ensure that,  
taking account of all employment conditions, the remuneration of all 
employees, management and directors remained aligned. In this way  
the policy for remuneration of Executive Directors was benchmarked 
against employment and remuneration polices across all employees.
Remuneration Committee report 64  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Remuneration policy 2009
Overall policy
The Remuneration Committee’ s policy during the year under review was to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following 
quartiles in comparison to the Company’ s Comparator Group: 
Base salary
Annual bonus  
potential Pension Benefits in kind
Potential total short-term 
remuneration available
Potential annual  
share awards
Potential total  
compensation value
Lower Quartile  
to Median
Upper Quartile Lower Quartile           Lower Quartile  
to Median                  to Median
Median to  
Upper Quartile
Upper Quartile Median to  
Upper Quartile
This supports the performance based culture of the Company. Fixed costs are minimised and total  
short-term remuneration will only reach and exceed the median if the performance-based bonus  
is earned for the relevant financial year. 
 
 
 
The policy in respect of long-term 
incentives and potential compensation 
value is an extension of the policy on total 
short-term remuneration. Executives will 
only receive a market competitive package 
if the annual bonus and long-term 
incentives are earned.
With the difficult global economic backdrop to 2009 and the banking industry turmoil, there has been much focus on executive pay as a potential 
causal factor in the banking crisis. This has had widespread coverage and has generated significant political pressure for change to the practices of  
the financial services industry in particular. This culminated in the publication of the Walker Review in November 2009, making a number of new 
recommendations of principle to be applied to remuneration in the financial services sector from the 2010 reporting year onwards. In addition, there 
have been a number of associated publications from shareholder bodies and institutional investors clarifying their expectations for remuneration in 
2009 and a draft revised UK Corporate Governance Code has been issued for consultation.
In formulating the application of its policy for 2009 and future years, the Remuneration Committee has been cogniscent of the evolving landscape 
in remuneration developments. The Remuneration Committee is confident that its policies remain effective and robust.
2009 Comparator Group 
During 2009 the Company updated its Comparator Group to ensure that it remained appropriate for the Company on an ongoing basis, reflecting the 
increase in size and further internationalisation of the Company and reacting to the significant consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry that had 
affected a significant proportion of the previously selected Comparator Group companies. 
The constituents of the Company’ s Comparator Group (“CG”) for benchmarking remuneration during 2009 were as follows:
Name Name Name
Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc Hospira Inc. Sanofi Aventis
AstraZeneca PLC Impax Labs Inc Sepracor Inc.
BTG PLC King Pharmaceuticals Inc. Shire Pharmaceuticals PLC
Crucell NV Merck KgaA UCB SA
Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Mylan Inc Valeant Pharmaceutical International
Forest Laboratories Inc Novartis AG Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc
Grilfols SA Prostraken Group PLC
Factors the Remuneration Committee took into account when selecting the 2009 CG included:
the industry within which the Company operates, specifically taking into account both the international nature of the Company’ s business  
and its competitors;
the international nature of the Company’ s current executive team and potential recruits to that team;
the market capitalisation, turnover and number of employees of the Company; and
the UK listing environment of the Company.
Remuneration Committee report continued 65
Governance and financial results
Throughout this report, references to quartiles are to quartiles in the Comparator Group.
The 2009 Comparator Group was used as the total shareholder return performance condition comparator group for awards granted in 2009 under 
the Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 2006 Long-T erm Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and will also be used for the 2010 LTIP Awards. The Company has historically 
used the same comparators for both benchmarking remuneration and the performance condition for awards granted during the relevant year, and  
will continue to do so in 2010. 
Ongoing review 
The Remuneration Committee continues to review the remuneration policy on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate for  
the financial year under review. Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include:
market conditions affecting the Company;
the recruitment market in the Company’ s sector;
changing market practice;
changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies; and
the current economic climate.
The Remuneration Committee has oversight of the main reward structures throughout the Company and was involved in the Company review 
mentioned above. Following both this Company review and the Committee’ s specific review for Executive Directors the Committee is satisfied that the 
Company’ s incentive structures are consistent with the risk profile of the Company set by the Board and also encourage a long-term sustainable view  
to be taken by participants. One of the features of the Company’ s remuneration which the Committee believes is particularly relevant in this context  
is the availability of plans encouraging wide share ownership at all levels of management.
It is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee to apply the 2009 policy in 2010.

Elements of Executive Directors’ remuneration
Base salary
Policy 2009 and 2010 – Lower quartile to median The Company’ s remuneration policy is to set the levels of base salary for the Executive Directors 
below the median to support a performance based culture.
When determining the base salary of the Executive Directors the Committee takes into consideration:
the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in 
particular the lower quartile and median salary levels of those comparable companies within the pharmaceuticals industry and the Comparator Group;
the performance of the individual Executive Director; 
the individual Executive Director’ s experience and responsibilities; and
pay and conditions throughout the Company. 66  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Remuneration Committee report continued
The following tables summarises the base salary of Executive Directors:

Lower quartile $804,000
Mazen Darwazah $420,000 $420,000 0% 11%
Median $500,000
Lower quartile $432,000
After reviewing the above criteria, the Committee elected not to increase Executive Directors’ salaries for 2010. It remains the Committee’ s ongoing 
policy that, save in exceptional circumstances, only modest rises in base salary should be required.
Annual performance related bonus
Policy 2009 and 2010 – Upper quartile bonus potential Bonus payments are not pensionable. The following tables summarise the main features of 
the Company’ s executive bonus plan.
Bonus Said Darwazah Mazen Darwazah
Company bonus potential 100% 100%
Upper Quartile CG 206% 197%
Median CG 190% 151%
2009 Bonus Paid as percentage of salary 73% 73%
Upper Quartile Bonus Payments in the CG as a percentage of salary 105% 82%
The maximum target bonus potential is 100% of salary. It is possible for exceptional performance to earn up to a total maximum bonus of 200% of 
salary. The maximum bonus potentials for 2010 will remain the same as those applied for 2009.
The bonuses for 2009 have been paid on the basis of the level of the achievement of the performance targets. The table below shows the principal 
performance targets used for 2009 and their percentage satisfaction.

The targets for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that they are appropriate to the 
current market conditions and position of the Company and in order to ensure that they continue to remain challenging. Underlying performance 
targets for Executive Directors’ bonuses were reviewed during 2008 to ensure that they remained in line with the Group’ s overall business strategy in 
2009. The Committee applied the same parameters in 2009 and it is the opinion of the Committee that the overall nature of the conditions remains 
appropriate for the requirements of the Group in 2010.  67
Governance and financial results
Share incentives
Policy 2009 and 2010 – Upper quartile The Remuneration Committee’ s policy is to provide annual share grants to senior executives at a maximum of 
the upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group. Ongoing share incentives are provided to the Executive Directors solely through the LTIP . 
The Remuneration Committee believes that share awards under the LTIP enable the Company to provide a competitive incentive and retention tool 
which is also cost effective in respect of both shareholder dilution and income statement expense. Furthermore, the proposed grant of awards with  
the attached performance condition ensures that the Company’ s comparative T otal Shareholder Return (“TSR”
1
) performance against the Comparator 
Group is at least at the upper quartile before executives receive the full benefit of their share incentives. This structure demonstrates the Remuneration 
Committee’ s desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of substantial performance.
The Remuneration Committee granted the following awards to executive directors during 2009. 
Name
Percentage  
of salary 
UQ in CG  
percentage  
of salary
Said Darwazah 127.3% 283%
Mazen Darwazah 114.5% 176%
In 2009 the Company introduced a new Management Incentive Plan. The levels of LTIP awards made in 2009 therefore reflect the smaller population of 
participants in the LTIP .
The following table summarises the main features of the LTIP in 2009 and its proposed operation during 2010.
Maximum annual grant face value as percentage of salary and performance condition
Maximum annual grant 300% (current normal operating maximum set by the Remuneration Committee 200%). 
The Awards will be subject to comparative TSR performance against the Comparator Group. 20% of Awards will be released for median performance 
with full release occurring for upper quartile comparative performance. The Remuneration Committee will also ensure that the underlying financial 
performance of the Company is consistent with its TSR performance. When considering this underlying financial performance the factors taken into 
account by the Remuneration Committee will include profit after tax, revenue growth and the achievement of operational milestones.

2008 LTIP Grant Ninth of 17 companies 20%
2009 LTIP Grant Second of 20 companies 100%
It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to 
which the performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the Company at that time.
1  T otal Shareholder Return (“TSR”) – is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the performance period (the return is the value of the capital gain and reinvested dividends).  
It is normally used comparatively and the Company which achieves the best return is ranked number one.
2 Face value for awards under the LTIP face value is the aggregate market value of the shares subject to the award at the date of grant. 68  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Remuneration Committee report continued
Basis of performance condition selection and measurement 
Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for the proposed awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the executives 
have outperformed their peers over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards 
irrespective of general market conditions. The Remuneration Committee will provide a full explanation and justification at the time of the release of  
the award and why it believes that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with this TSR performance.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisfied. The Committee has appointed 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to assist in the ongoing calculation of TSR in accordance with the rules of the LTIP . The Committee will approve these 
figures prior to the release of any award.
Dilution 
In accordance with the guidelines set out by the Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share 
capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all its share plans and a maximum of 5% of this 10% for discretionary share plans. Under the 
LTIP rules, grants of no more than 3% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be awarded in the first three years following the 
Company’ s IPO, undertaken in 2005. 
The following table summarises the current level of dilution resulting from Company share plans following the IPO:
T ype of plan
Share awards as a percentage  
of issued share capital as at  
31 December 2009 in a rolling  
ten year period

during the year
All Employee Share Plans (10% limit) 0% 0%
Discretionary Share Plans (5% limit) 2.145% 0.77%
The Company has not implemented any all-employee share incentive arrangements.
It is the Company’ s current intention that LTIP awards granted in 2009 will be satisfied by newly issued shares. 
Post-employment benefits 
Policy 2009 and 2010 – Lower quartile to median The Executive Directors participate in the Hikma Pharmaceuticals Defined Contribution Retirement 
Benefit Plan (the “Benefit Plan”) in accordance with the Rules of the Benefit Plan relevant to employees of the Group based in Jordan. Under the 
Benefit Plan the Group matches employee contributions made to the Benefit Plan. These are fixed at 5% of applicable salary. Participants are entitled  
to 30% of the Group’ s contributions to the Benefit Plan after three years of employment with the Group, and an additional 10% in each subsequent 
year. The participant’ s interest in the Group’ s contribution fully vests after ten years of employment.
The following table sets out the percentage post-employment contributions compared to the Comparator Group. 
Said Darwazah Mazen Darwazah
Company 1.35% 1.86%
Upper quartile 30% 25%
Median 25% 15%
Lower quartile 15% 10%
In addition, pursuant to applicable law, each of the Executive Directors receives contributions as a percentage of salary which is paid by the Group into 
Government social security systems.

Other remuneration matters
Directors’ shareholding policy 
The Company does not have a formal directors’ shareholding requirement due to the substantial shareholdings of the Executive Directors. The 
Committee, however, wholeheartedly supports the alignment of interests created by a minimum level of executive shareholding and should the 
make-up of the Board change would consider the introduction of a formal shareholding requirement.
Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) 
During 2009 the Company made the first awards to management under the MIP . Under the MIP , the Company will make grants of nil cost option 
awards to executive management across the Group based on the satisfaction of annual performance targets. The key features of the MIP are 
as follows: 
the MIP is open to management level employees across the Group below senior executive level;
participation in the LTIP will preclude participation in the MIP;
participants will be notified of a maximum monetary entitlement, (the maximum award level is anticipated to be 50% of salary p.a.) the value of which 
will be awarded to participants in the form of nil cost options over shares, based on annual performance against individual and Group KPIs;
nil cost options will vest two years after the date of award (being approximately three years after the commencement of the financial year to which  
the award relates), subject to the participant remaining in employment with the Group during this period. Once the options have been awarded,  
the continued employment requirement is the only condition for vesting.
The MIP awards made in respect of 2009 will be satisfied out of market purchased shares held for the purpose in the Group’ s Employment Benefit 
Trust. The AGM to be held on 13 May 2010 the Company will seek approval from shareholders to satisfy ongoing awards under the MIP from newly 
issued shares. The principal terms of the MIP will be set out in a Circular accompanying the Annual Report.
Executive Directors’ contracts 
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors of the Company in force at the end of the year under review are as follows: 
Name Company notice period Contract date Unexpired term of contract Potential termination payment
Said Darwazah  12 months 1 July 2007 Rolling contract 12 months salary  
and benefits
Mazen Darwazah  12 months 25 May 2006 Rolling contract 12 months salary  
and benefits
The Executive Directors’ contracts are on a rolling basis, unless terminated by at least 12 months’ written notice. This arrangement is in line with best 
corporate practice for listed companies. In the event of the termination of an executive’ s contract, salary and benefits will be payable during the notice 
period (there will, however, be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments or share incentive grants during the period of notice other than in 
accordance with the rules of the relevant incentive plan). The Remuneration Committee will ensure that there have been no unjustified payments for 
failure on an Executive Director’ s termination of employment. There are no special provisions in the contracts of employment extending notice periods 
on a change of control, liquidation of the Company or cessation of employment.  70  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Remuneration Committee report continued
External appointments 
The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector and not-for-profit 
appointments, and that these can broaden the experience and knowledge of the director, from which the Company can benefit. Executive Directors 
may therefore accept such appointments as long as they do not lead to a conflict of interest, and are allowed to retain any fees paid under such 
appointments. During the year under review, Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah received fees of US$11,850 and US$3,385 respectively, in  
respect of such appointments.
Non-Executive Directors’ Fees
Policy 2009 – Upper Quartile The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from  
the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Chairman and is within the limits set by the Articles of Association. 
The nature of the Company’ s business is international, requiring the Non-Executive Directors to travel to the USA, Middle East and Europe.  
The Board is therefore made up of Non-Executive Directors with a wide range of experience both in the UK and internationally. The use of options for 
Non-Executive Directors is very prevalent in the US and also to some extent internationally. However, as a UK listed company complying with UK best 
practice it is not considered appropriate to grant options to the Company’ s Non-Executive Directors. T o ensure that the Company remains able to attract 
the appropriate calibre of candidate and to take account of its inability to grant options, the Board has therefore set its fee policy at the upper quartile. 
The individual basic and committee fees, which are paid in £ Sterling, are as follows:

Sir David Rowe-Ham 67.5 63 7.5 7.5 78 135 
A review of the level of Non-Executive Director fees was conducted during 2009. The Board commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to conduct a 
study of non-executive remuneration against the Comparator Group. This showed that, in relation to the overall Non-Executive Director fee policy set 
by the Group, Hikma’ s Non-Executive Director fees remained out of step with those of the Comparator Group. Following the review it was resolved  
by the Board that the composition of the Non-Executive Director fees should be updated to reflect not only the work undertaken as a chairman of a 
board committee, but also as a member of Board committees. Therefore, a Board committee membership fee will be paid in addition to the basic fee 
to those Non-Executive Directors who sit on the board committees. In conjunction with the review the Board also resolved that from 1 January 2010, 
the basic fees of Non-Executive Directors should be increased to the amounts set out above. There has been no change in the fees of the Non-Executive 
Chairman. The increases continue to move Non-Executive fees back towards the Group’ s stated policy, though overall Non-Executive fees remain below 
the level set by Group policy. The Board continues to believe that it is important to ensure that the fees paid to Non-Executives remain competitive, that 
they reflect the increasingly important role played by Non-Executives and allow the Nomination Committee to recruit Non-Executive Directors of the 
appropriate calibre in accordance with the requirements of succession planning. 
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the Company and are not entitled to 
pension contributions or other benefits provided by the Company. The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of 
appointment with the Company. Each appointment is terminable on one months’ notice from either the Company or the Director, but is envisaged to 
be for an initial period of up to 36 months, subject to the terms of the Company’ s Articles of Association, the Companies Act and shareholder approval.

Options granted under the 2004 Plan are not subject to performance criteria, though vesting of options under the 2004 Plan was conditional on 
the successful listing of the Company’ s share on the London Stock Exchange. During the year Samih Darwazah continued to hold options over shares 
awarded to him during his period as an executive of the Company, as he remained a qualified holder under the terms of the 2004 Stock Option Plan. 
During the year, Samih Darwazah exercised options over 320,000 Ordinary Shares of the Company, and Mazen Darwazah exercised options over 
320,000 Ordinary Shares of the Company. Samih Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah no longer hold any options under the 2004 Plan. No other  
options were exercised by Directors during the year and no options expired unexercised. Furthermore, there were no variations to the terms and 
conditions of share options during the year.

Audit
The emoluments and Directors’ interests’ information disclosed in the Directors’ report on remuneration, which is required by Schedule 8 of the 
Regulations and the Companies Act 2006 (as amended), has been audited.
Approved by the Board of Directors on 16 March 2010 and signed on its behalf
Michael Ashton 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 75
Governance and financial results
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen 
to prepare the parent company financial statements under IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors  
must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these  
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’ s financial position and financial performance; and
make an assessment of the Company’ s ability to continue as a  
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records  
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’ s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of  
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
1.  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss  
of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
2.  the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings  
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board

Cash Flow Statements and the related notes 1 to 56. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation  
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union and as regards the parent Company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of  
the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’ s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’ s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’ s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’ s 
(APB’ s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’ s and the Parent 
Company’ s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’ s and of the Company’ s affairs as at 31 December 2009 and  
of the Group’ s profit for the year then ended;
the Consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with  
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the  
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 2 to the Group financial statements, the Group  
in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued  
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs  
as issued by the IASB.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received  
from branches not visited by us; or
the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require  
for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
the Directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ Report  
in relation to going concern; and
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any significant impact 
on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
IAS 1 (revised 2007) Presentation of Financial statements  IAS 1 (2007) has introduced a number of changes in format and contents of the 
financial statements. 
IAS 23 (revised 2007)  
Borrowing Costs 
 
The principal change to the Standard was to eliminate the option to expense all 
borrowing costs when incurred. This change has had no impact on these financial 
statements because it has always been the Group’ s accounting policy to capitalise 
borrowing costs incurred on qualifying assets. 
Amendments to IAS 32  
Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation  
of Financial Statements – Puttable Financial Instruments  
and Obligations Arising on Liquidation 
The revisions to IAS 32 amend the criteria for debt/equity classification by permitting 
certain puttable financial instruments and instruments (or components of instruments) 
that impose on an entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro-rate share of 
the net assets of the entity only on liquidation, to be classified as equity, subject to 
specified criteria being met.
Amendments to IAS 39  
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement –  
Eligible Hedged Items
The amendments provide clarification on two aspects of hedge accounting: 
identifying inflation as a hedged risk or portion, and hedging with options.
Embedded Derivatives (Amendments to IFRIC 9)  
Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives and IAS 39  
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
The amendments clarify the accounting for embedded derivatives in the case of 
a reclassification of a financial asset out of the “fair value through profit or loss” 
(FVTPL) category as permitted by the October 2008 amendments to IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (see above).
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 January 2009. 
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports 
about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive  
to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance. In contrast, the 
predecessor Standard (IAS 14 Segment Reporting) required the Group to identify  
two sets of segments (business and geographical), using a risks and returns approach, 
with the Group’ s system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel

Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments  
(Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures)
The amendments to IFRS 7 expand the disclosures required in respect of fair  
value measurements and liquidity risk.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment –  
Vesting Conditions and Cancellations 
The amendments clarify the definition of vesting conditions for the purposes of  
IFRS 2, introduce the concept of “non-vesting” conditions and clarify the accounting 
treatment for cancellations.
Amendments to IAS 20 – Accounting for Government  
Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance  
IAS 20 has been amended to require that the benefit of a government loan at a 
below-market rate of interest to be treated as a government grant. This accounting 
treatment was not permitted prior to this amendment.  83

2. Significant accounting policies
General Information
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the registered office is  
given on page 131. 
Basis of accounting
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC’ s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for  
use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, except for the revaluation to market of certain financial assets and liabilities. 
The Group’ s previously published financial statements were also prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. 
The presentational and functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC is the US Dollar as the majority of the Company’ s business is conducted 
in US Dollars (USD). 
The significant accounting policies are set out below. 84  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC (the “Company”) and entities controlled by the Company 
(together the “Group”) and the Group’ s share of the results and net assets of its associates. Control is achieved where the Company has the ability  
to govern the financial and operating policies either directly or indirectly of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.  
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Non-controlling interests  
in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’ s equity therein. The non-controlling interest is stated at the 
minority’ s proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in 
excess of the non-controlling interest are allocated against the interests of the parent. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the  
year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, 
as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with 
those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of 
the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’ s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that 
meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’ s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’ s 
interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’ s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination,  
the excess is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority’ s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements (see page 60).
Investment in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation  
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting except  
when classified as held for sale. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but not control or joint control  
over these policies.
Investment in joint venture
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and a third party undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.  
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an economic activity, and exists only when the strategic financial and operating  
decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control (the venturers).
Each venturer contributes cash or other resources to the jointly controlled entity. These contributions are included in the accounting records of  
the venturer and recognised in its financial statements as an investment in the jointly controlled entity.
The Group recognises its interest in the joint venture using proportionate consolidation. The application of proportionate consolidation means that 
the balance sheet of the Group includes its share of the assets that it controls jointly and its share of the liabilities for which it is jointly responsible.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
(a)  Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’ s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss 
and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’ s cash-generating units. Cash-generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequent when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
(b)  Marketing rights are amortised over their useful lives commencing in the year in which the rights first generate sales.
(c)  Customer relationships represent the value attributed to the long term relationships held with existing customers at the date of acquisition  
and are amortised over their useful economic life.
(d)  Product related intangibles 
 (i) product files and under-licenced products are assigned indefinite useful lives which are reviewed for impairment at least annually; and
 (ii) Under licence agreements and product dossiers are amortised over their useful lives in the year of acquisition.
(e)  Purchased software is amortised over the useful economic lives when the asset is available for use. 
(f)  In process research and development recognised on acquisition is amortised over the useful life in the year of acquisition.
(g)  Trade name some trade names are assigned indefinite useful lives and others have finite useful lives over which they are amortised where 
applicable, in the period from acquisition. 
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in US dollars,  
the functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC and the presentational currency of the consolidated financial statements.  
Transactions in currencies other than local currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing  
at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are  
not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary 
assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value and the related foreign exchange are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’ s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and 
transferred to the Group’ s translation reserve. Such cumulative translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which 
the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when goods or services are supplied or made available to external customers against 
orders received and when title and risk of loss has passed.
Revenue represents the amounts receivable after the deduction of discounts, value added tax, other sales taxes, and allowances given, provisions 
for chargebacks and accruals for estimated future rebates and returns. The methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are 
monitored and adjusted regularly in light of contractual and historical information and past experience.   86  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Chargebacks  
The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. In the USA the Group  
sells its products directly to wholesale distributors, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies. The Group also sells its 
products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organisations, hospitals, and Group purchasing organisations, collectively referred to as 
“indirect customers”. The Group enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products. The indirect customers 
then independently select a wholesaler from which they purchase the products at agreed-upon prices. The Group will provide credit to the wholesaler 
for the difference between the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler’ s invoice price. This credit is called a chargeback.  
The provision for chargebacks is based on historical sell-through levels by the Group’ s wholesale customers to the indirect customers, and estimated 
wholesaler inventory levels. As sales are made to the large wholesale customers, the Group continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and  
makes adjustments when it believes that actual chargebacks may differ from estimated reserves.
Returns and rebates  
In certain countries and consistent with industry practice, the Group has a product return policy that allows selected customers to return the product 
within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date, in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases.
The Group estimates its provision for returns and rebates based on historical experience, changes to business practices and credit terms.  
While such experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past, history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns.  
The Group continually monitors the provisions for returns and rebates, and makes adjustments when it believes that actual product returns may  
differ from established reserves.
Price adjustments  
Price adjustments, also known as “shelf stock adjustments”, are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the Group’s products that 
customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction. Decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by Group 
management to reflect competitive market conditions. Amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with 
direct customers, estimated declines in market prices and estimates of inventory held by customers. The Group regularly monitors these and other 
factors and re-evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a 
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use or sale. 
T o the extent that variable rate borrowings are used to finance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective cash flow hedge of interest  
rate risk, the effective portion of the derivative is deferred in equity and released to profit or loss when the qualifying asset impacts profit or loss.  
T o the extent that fixed rate borrowings are used to finance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective fair value hedge of interest rate risk,  
the capitalised borrowing costs reflect the hedged interest rate.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from  
the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Dividend income
Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing
Leases are classified as capital leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.  
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term  
of the operating lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over  
the lease term.
Assets held under capital leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a capital lease 
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. 87
Governance and financial results
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Government grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the statement of comprehensive income 
over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Research and development
Research and development expenses are fully charged to the statement of comprehensive income, as the Group considers that the regulatory and  
other uncertainties inherent in the development of its products generally mean that the recognition criteria in IAS 38 “Intangible assets” are not met. 
Where, however the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets will be recognised and amortised over their useful economic life. 
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement 
benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those 
arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Tax
The Group provides for income tax according to the laws and regulations prevailing in the countries where the Group operates. Furthermore, the Group 
computes and records deferred tax assets and liabilities according to IAS 12 “Income T axes”.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive 
income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never  
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax  
is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities  
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities  
on a net basis.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services in 
exchange for shares or rights over shares (“equity-settled transactions”).
Share-based payments
IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments” requires an expense to be recognised when the Group buys goods or services in exchange for share or rights over 
shares (“share-based payments”) or in exchange for other equivalent assets. 
The cost of share based payments’ transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which the share based 
payments are granted. The fair value of the equity settled stock options scheme is determined using a binomial model. The fair value of the long-term 
incentive plan is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on management’ s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations (further details are given in note 36). In valuing 
share based payments, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the market price of the shares of Hikma 
Pharmaceuticals PLC.   88  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payments (continued)
The cost of share-based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period  
based on the Group’ s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. Where the terms  
of a share-based payments award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. In addition, an expense 
is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the modification date. Where a share based 
payments award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised 
immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for a cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the 
cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. The dilutive effect  
of outstanding share based payments is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment have been stated at cost on acquisition and are depreciated, except for land, on a straight-line basis at the following 
depreciation rates:
Buildings 2% to 4%
Vehicles  10% to 20%
Fixtures & equipment 6% to 33%
Projects under construction are not depreciated until construction has been completed.
Any additional costs that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalised. Property, plant and equipment which are financed 
by leases giving Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the asset 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, and depreciated in the same manner as other property, plant and 
equipment over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life. Whenever the recoverable amount of an asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced 
to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is taken to the statement of comprehensive income. Projects under construction are carried at cost, 
less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Purchased products are stated at acquisition cost and all other costs incurred in 
bringing each product to its present location and condition. Cost of own-manufactured products comprises direct materials and, where applicable, 
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. In the balance 
sheet, inventory is primarily valued at standard cost, which approximates to historical cost determined on a moving average basis, and this value is  
used to determine the cost of sales in the statement of comprehensive income. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and all estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions are made for inventories with 
net realisable value lower than cost or for slow moving inventory.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’ s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The principal derivative 
instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts. The Group does not hold or issue  
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and then re-measured at subsequent reporting dates to fair 
value. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument,  
in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedging derivatives are classified on inception as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of 
derivatives designed as fair value hedges are recorded in the statement of comprehensive income, with the changes in the fair value of the hedged 
asset or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the 
statement of comprehensive income in line with the hedged forecast transaction. 
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the statement  
of comprehensive income.  89
Governance and financial results
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Investments Available for sale investments with quoted market prices are initially recognised at cost on acquisition and re-measured to their fair values 
at year-end. Gains or losses on re-measurement to fair value are recognised in shareholders’ equity until the investments are sold, disposed of, or 
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gains or loss relating to these investments previously recognised in equity is included in the 
statement of comprehensive income. Available for sale financial assets without market prices and the fair value of which cannot be reliably measured 
are stated at cost, less a provision for any impairment loss, which is taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of quoted financial assets represents the closing price in the financial markets at the date of the financial statements. However, the 
fair value of unquoted financial assets, or those with no declared price are estimated by comparing the fair value of a similar financial instrument or 
through a discounted cash flow method.
Accounts receivable Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial 
recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis using the effective interest method and  
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication 
that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or income-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(income-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. 90  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’ s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both  
current and future periods. 
The Group’ s management believes that, among others, the following accounting policies that involve management judgements and estimates  
are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the Group’ s financial results.
Chargebacks
(see details above)
Revenue recognition 
The Group’ s revenue recognition policies require management to make a number of estimates, with the most significant relating to chargebacks, 
product returns, rebates and price adjustments which vary by product arrangements and buying groups.
Accounts receivable and bad debts
The Group estimates, based on its historical experience, the level of debts that it believes will not be collected. Such estimates are made when collection 
of the full amount of the debt is no longer probable. These estimates are based on a number of factors including specific customer issues and industry, 
economic and political conditions. Bad debts are written-off when identified.
Goodwill and intangible assets
The critical areas of judgement in relation to goodwill and intangible assets are the useful economic lives of the product-related intangibles and the 
growth rates used in the impairment tests for goodwill.
Contingent liabilities 
The Group is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business relating to employment, product liability and other commercial 
disputes. Often this litigation is subject to substantial uncertainties, and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained or an estimate  
of the amount of any loss, is difficult to ascertain. Consequently, it is often not practicable to make a reasonable estimate of the possible financial 
effect, if any, that could arise from the ultimate resolution of legal proceedings. In such cases, where the Group believes that a disclosure is required, 
information regarding the nature and facts of the case is disclosed. For current matters see Note 35. Although there can be no assurance regarding  
the outcome of the disclosed legal proceeding, based on management’ s current and considered view, the Group does not expect it to have a materially 
adverse effect on our financial position. This position could change over time.     91

4. Segmental reporting
For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating divisions – Generic, Branded and Injectables. These divisions are the 
basis on which the Group reports its segment information.
The Group discloses underlying operating profit as the measure of segment result as this is the measure used in the decision-making and resource 
allocation process of the chief operating decision maker, who is the Group’ s Chief Executive Officer.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The value in use calculations are based on the budget for the 
following year, grown at 2% in perpetuity. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and short-term 
growth forecast in budgets. 
Management estimates discount rates using WACC rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the CGUs. The discount rates used varied between 8.4% and 13.4%. The short-term growth rates range from 17% to 78%.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU’ s carrying value. In each case the valuations indicate sufficient 
headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill. 100  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009

The net book value of the Group’ s machinery and equipment includes an amount of USD 12,743,000 (2008: USD 6,028,000) in respect of assets held 
under finance lease.
As at 31 December 2009 the Group had pledged property, plant and equipment having a carrying value of USD 79,557,000 (2008: USD 87,289,000) 
as collateral for various long-term loans. This amount includes both specific items around the Group and the net property, plant and equipment of the 
Group’ s businesses in Portugal, Saudi Arabia and US.
In 1994, the Portuguese Government granted Hikma Farmaceutica an amount of Euro 1,600,000 to build the company’ s factory in accordance 
with the SINPEDIP program. In 2008, the German Government provided Thymoorgan Pharmazie GmbH a grant of Euro 560,000 being a contribution 
towards the acquisition of two freeze dryers and additional equipment. The carrying value of the grants as of 31 December 2009 were USD 40,000 
(2008: USD 153,000) for Hikma Farmaceutica and USD 454,000 (2008: 542,000) for Thymoorgan Pharmazie GmbH.
During the year 2009, the Group entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to 
USD 776,000 (2008: USD 7,412,000).
The amount of borrowing costs that have been capitalised in the year within the projects under construction is USD 422,000 (2008: USD 426,000). 
The average capitalisation rate used ranges between 2.9%–12.1% (2008: 2.0%–3.9%). 102  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009

Deferred tax liabilities 11,734 12,425
Deferred tax assets (18,793) (13,305)
(7,059) (880)
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on tax losses totalling USD 3,873,000 (2008: USD 6,647,000) due to the unpredictability of the related 
future profit streams. These losses may be carried forward for four years before expiry.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of USD 30 million (2008: USD 246 million) relating to the unremitted earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 31 December 2009 are significantly reduced from the previous year as a result of a change to 
UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009. The temporary differences at 31 December 
2009 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, 
principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate. 103

The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where  
it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable. When the receivable is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against  
the underlying receivable.

29. Financial policies for risk management and their objectives
Credit and concentration of risk
The Group’ s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
The Group’ s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for 
doubtful debts, chargebacks in the US, expired goods and without recourse discounts. A provision for impairment is made where there is an identified 
loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned 
by international credit-rating agencies.
In line with local market practice, clients in the MENA region are offered relatively longer payment terms compared to clients in Europe and the US. 
During the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group’ s largest three clients in the MENA region represented 21% of Group Turnover, 15% in Saudi 
Arabia and two customers in Algeria making up 4% and 2% each. The amount of receivables due from customers based in the Algerian market at 
31 December 2009 is USD 32,016,596 (2008: USD 32,784,000) and Saudi Arabia is USD 53,373,000 (2008: USD 44,366,000). The Group manages 
this risk through the implementation of stringent credit policies and procedures and certain credit insurance agreements.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise. Credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer, 
based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors related to the creditworthiness of a particular customer. The Group is exposed to a variety 
of customers ranging from government backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local 
economic risks vary across the Group. T ypical credit terms in the US range from 30–60 days, in Europe 60–120 days, and MENA 180–360 days. 
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Market risk
The Group’ s objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flow associated with changes in interest 
rates and foreign currency rates. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Management actively monitors these exposures to 
manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivative financial instruments.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses the USD as its functional currency and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in the Euro and Algerian Dinar. 
Consequently, where possible the Group enters into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to hedge against the 
risk of movement in foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk
The Group manages its exposures to interest rate risks by changing the proportion of debt that is fixed by entering into interest rate swap agreements. 
Using these derivative financial instruments has not had a material impact on the Group’ s financial position at 31 December 2009 or the Group’ s results 
of operations for the year then ended. 108  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009

An interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 
2009, with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our debt portfolio as at 31 December 2009, a 1% increase/decrease in 
interest rates would result in an additional USD 1.4 million (2008: USD 2.0 million) in interest expense/income being incurred per year.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between 
willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value:
Cash and cash equivalents – approximates to the carrying amount;
Short-term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments;
Long-term loans – approximates to the carrying amount in the case of floating rate bank loans and other loans;
Forward exchange contracts – based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date;
Receivables and payables – approximates to the carrying amount; and
Lease obligations – approximates to the carrying value.
Management considers that the book value of the Group’ s financial assets and liabilities does not materially differ from their fair value.
Currency risk
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is other than the functional currency 
of the booking entity and being of a monetary nature.
The currencies that have a significant impact on the Group accounts and the exchange rates used are as follows: 
Period end rates Average rates
2009 2008 2009 2008
USD/EUR 0.6977 0.7094 0.7170 0.6797

Governance and financial results
30. Derivative financial instruments
Currency derivatives
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows. The Group is party to a variety of foreign currency 
forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the 
currencies of the Group’ s principal markets.
At the balance sheet date the Group was not committed to any outstanding forward exchange contracts.
The total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group was committed to, have been translated  
at 31 December exchange rates as below.
2009 
$000’s
2008 
$000’ s
Foreign exchange forward contracts and options (Euro) – 3,552
Foreign exchange forward contracts (Yen) – 443
These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures.
At 31 December 2008 the fair value of the Group’ s currency derivatives all of which were designated as effective cash flow hedges was an asset  
of USD 382,000. The movement in fair value in the year resulted in a loss of USD 382,000 (2008: USD 407,000 net gain) which has been reflected  
in equity. These amounts were based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group believes that the effect on the value of cash flow hedges of currency and interest rate fluctuations is not significant and will not 
materially affect the financial position of the Group.
Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings. These contracts have nominal values  
of USD 34.4 million (2008: USD 22.8 million) and have fixed interest payments at rates ranging from 1.91% to 4.75% (2008: 3.9% to 4.75[%]) for 
periods up until 2016 and have floating interest receipts at LIBOR or EURIBOR.  
The fair value of swaps entered into by the Group is estimated as a liability of USD 932,000 (2008: liability of USD 896,000). These amounts are 
based on market values provided by the banks that originated the swaps and are based on equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. Some of 
these interest rate swaps are designated as effective cash flow hedges and the movement in fair value totalling a gain of USD 180,000 (2008: USD loss 
of 485,000) has been reflected in equity. The remaining outstanding interest rate swaps that the Group was committed to at year end are held at fair 
value through profit and loss. A loss of USD 216,000 has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 
2009 (2008: loss of [USD] 329,000) in respect of such derivatives.
The Group believes that the effect on the value of interest rate swaps by interest rate fluctuations will not materially affect the financial position of 
the Group. 112  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009

the Placing Price and 333,000 shares were placed with the Darwazah family and other connected individuals at the Placing Price. The total number of 
shares issued represents 9.96% of Hikma’ s issued ordinary share capital prior to the placing.
In 2008 the Group used the proceeds from the placing to reduce borrowings incurred in connection with its JOD 116.0 million (USD 163.8 million) 
acquisition of Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company thereby providing the Group with increased flexibility to finance future growth.

35. Contingent liabilities
The Group was contingently liable for letters of guarantee and letters of credit totalling USD 62.4 million (2008: USD 23.6 million).
The integrated nature of the Group’ s worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited 
number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations  
with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax. Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities 
as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods and services should be transferred between Group companies in different tax 
jurisdictions, can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual territories. Resolution of such issues  
is ongoing.
In common with many other companies in the pharmaceutical industry the Group is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its 
business, including litigation relating to employment, product liability and other commercial disputes. 
In particular, West-ward Pharmaceutical Corp. is a co-defendant, with four other generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, in litigation brought  
by Mutual Pharmaceutical Company, Inc. regarding the continued sale by West-ward and the others of generic oral colchicine in the United States, 
following the approval by the FDA of Mutual’ s “Colcrys
TM
” colchicine product (the “Claim”). Pursuant to the Claim, Mutual alleges unfair competition 
and false advertising by the Defendants in respect of their sale of oral colchicine, and seeks damages for loss of sales. The Claim was filed in the United 
States District Court for the Central District of California and subsequently, on petition by the Defendants, transferred to the United States District Court 
for the District of New Jersey. At the same time as the transfer of the Claim to the District of New Jersey, the Court denied a preliminary injunction that 
Mutual had sought to prevent the Defendants from continuing their alleged unfair competition and false advertising pending the final outcome of  
the Claim, finding that Mutual had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. Discovery is ongoing, and on 12 March 2010, 
the Court made a scheduling order for the purpose of setting a final schedule to govern further proceedings in the case.  
This matter remains subject to substantial uncertainties. As this litigation is at an early stage, it is also not practicable to make a reasonable estimate 
of the possible financial effect, if any, that could arise. Management has assessed and considered all the relevant facts of the litigation and having done 
so does not consider that a provision is required to be made in respect of the Claim (see note 3).  
36. Share-based payments
Equity settled share option scheme
During the year ended 31 December 2009 and 2008, the Company had one stock option compensation scheme settled by equity instruments, with 
four separate grant dates. The options over these instruments are settled in equity once exercised.

income as part of general and administrative expenses.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was USD 7.14. The options outstanding at  
31 December 2009 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of one year.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’ s share price over the previous three to four years.
Long-term incentive plan
During 2007, 2008 and 2009 year, the Company granted awards under Hikma Long-T erm Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) to certain employees. Under the  
LTIP , conditional awards of nil cost options are made which vest after three years subject to a total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance condition.  
This condition measures the Group’ s TSR relative to a comparator group of other pharmaceutical companies. In this case, the vesting schedule dictates 
that 20% of awards vest for median performance and 100% for upper quartile performance, with pro-rata vesting in between these points. No awards 
vest for performance which is below the median.  116  Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009

Management incentive plan 
During 2009 the Company notified certain employees of their awards under the Hikma Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”). Under the MIP , 
conditional awards of nil cost options are made which give the opportunity to grant an award of shares subject to achievement of the employee  
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This condition measures the employee achievement against set KPIs. In this case, the number of shares awarded 
is based on percentage of achievements. No awards vest for achievements below 50%.
The award is subject to a two year holding period during which the employee must remain employed in the Group; at the end of the holding 
period the award is released and becomes exercisable.  Governance and financial results

being of a monetary nature. The following table illustrates financial assets and liabilities for the Company in different currencies:

A sensitivity analysis based on a 1% movement in foreign exchange rates has no material impact on the Company results and Company statement  
of changes in equity. 
Further details on how the Company manages the currency risk are given in Note 29 to the Group accounts.
Interest rate risk 
An interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 
2009, with all other variable held constant. Based on the composition of our debt portfolio as at 31 December 2009, a 1% increase in interest rates 
would result in no additional interest expense being incurred per year (2008: USD 400,000). 127

The Financial Services Authority has issued a number of warnings to 
shareholders regarding boiler room scams. Over the last year many 
companies have become aware that shareholders have received unsolicited 
phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are 
typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders, 
offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk 
shares in US or UK investments. These operations are commonly known 
as boiler rooms. These brokers can be very persistent and extremely 
persuasive. Shareholders are advised to be very cautious of unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company 
reports. If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
Obtain the correct name of the person and organisations.
Check they are authorised by the FSA by looking the firm up on  
www.fsa.gov.uk/register.
Report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 or visit  
www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk.
If the caller persists, hang up.
Details of the share dealing facilities sponsored by the Company are 
included in Company mailings and are on the Company website.

The principal changes introduced in the new Articles are summarised in 
Appendix A of the Notice of Annual General Meeting accompanying this 
document. Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or clarifying 
nature and also some more changes which merely reflect changes made 
by the Companies Act 2006 and the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) 
Regulations 2009 have not been noted in Appendix A. The new Articles, 
showing all the changes from the existing Articles are available for 
inspection at the Company’ s registered office – 13 Hanover Square,

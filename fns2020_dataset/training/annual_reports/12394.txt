PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC Our

Performance
I am pleased to report that 2014 was an extremely exciting 
year in the relatively short history of the Porta Group. The 
consolidation of the Corporate and Capital Markets PR 
businesses under the single Newgate brand, with a strong 
and growing international footprint, has been particularly 
positive as it benefits from scale and brings together some 
of the best people in the industry. 
Our consumer PR capabilities ramped up dramatically in 
the year with the acquisition of Publicasity. Both Redleaf 
and PPS, welcomed during the year, helped significantly to 
strengthen the Financial PR, Public Affairs, Corporate and 
crisis offer in the UK. 
These acquisitions, together with WSM Print & Design and 
Digital, mean that Porta is successfully progressing its 
acquisition strategy to supplement the strong organic 
growth in our existing dynamic businesses. It also means 
that our London headquarters is near capacity, delivering 
clear benefits to the integrated offering as well as to the 
profitability, discussed later in this Report. 
The Board and Governance
The Board has been active and efficient during the year, 
assessing the opportunities presented by management and 
assisting in the strategic direction of the Group and by 
referring new businesses to Porta companies. The overall 
contribution continues to be invaluable.
The Board in 2014 has focused upon the Group’s strategic 
direction and performance, particularly against challenging 
markets. We will continue to develop the Group’s strategy 
and report upon progress. The Board has determined that 
the 2014 Annual Report as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable. It provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the performance and the strategy 
of the Group. The Governance Report on pages 50 to 53 
of this Annual Report provides further details about the 
operation of the Board and its principal committees. 
Annual General Meeting 
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will be held at 
11.00 am on 25 June 2015 and the Notice of Meeting and 
explanatory notes which accompany this Annual Report 
can also be found on our website. 
Our people
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of 
our people for their significant contribution to our success 
over the past year. I would like to take this opportunity to 
welcome our new colleagues to Porta. Our people are our 
biggest asset and during the year the management team 
appointed a Group Head of Human Resources from within 
the Group to help with professional development as well as 
strengthening our compliance. We also promoted a Group 
Development Director and added capacity in the IT and 
accounting functions. Overall we have implemented major 
restructuring initiatives during 2014 and the successful and 
timely delivery of these as well as the financial performance 
of the Company has been down to the passion, hard work 
and effort of all our people.

Strategy
Chief Executive’s Business Review
For the year ended 31 December 2014
Gross profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 rose from 
£8.3 million to £19.4 million, a gain of over 130% while 
organic growth (stripping out first time contributions from 
acquisitions) was 75% higher compared with single digit 
growth in the sector. This excludes TTMG which was closed.
Porta is pleased to report positive EBITDA for the first time, 
which has been achieved despite the Group incurring higher 
property costs, with the acquisitions taking longer to 
complete than anticipated and almost £0.4 million extra 
costs associated with the termination of the previous LLP 
structures which we had to close in line with HMRC 
guidance. Headline EBITDA was nearly three times higher at 
£2.2 million once the exceptional costs, particularly start-
ups, are added back. Many of these exceptional costs will 
be eliminated in the current year. 
With the exception of France and China, the Group has now 
completed its phase of start-ups with future growth being a 
mixture of organic and acquisition. Given the size of Porta 
and restricted access to funds, this strategy was the right 
course for the Group in the early years. Indeed, these assets 
have been developed, albeit over a longer period, for a 
fraction of their present value if acquired today.
Through start-ups, together with strategic income producing 
acquisitions, Porta has now built an integrated international 
marketing group covering the majority of client requirements.
Communications 
Trading during 2014 was particularly strong in Newgate 
globally, with organic growth of well over 70%. Newgate 
Australia, helped by the privatisation of Medibank, was the 
star performer. Fee income was up by nearly 200% in its 
first full year of operation. However, the weakness of the 
Australian dollar reduced Group EBITDA by £0.16 million in 
the year. Both Newgate Hong Kong and Newgate Singapore 
were profitable in very difficult markets, reflecting the quality 
of the teams in both areas.
In London, Newgate continued to show strong growth 
helped by the strength of the IPO market particularly at the 
beginning of the year. The former Threadneedle business 
has been restructured under new management and is now 
fully integrated into the Newgate capital markets offering.  
It is pleasing to see that Newgate maintains its position as 
the number one agency for the number of AIM clients that it 
is retained by. Given the success of recent pitches, Newgate 
David Wright 
Chief Executive Officer
The growing maturity of all our start-up companies, 
together with the success achieved by marketing 
Porta as a fully integrated group, has again 
produced outstanding growth, particularly in the 
communications division.

Porta
Communications should not only maintain its strong ranking but also enjoy 
further success this year. Pitching with other disciplines in 
the Group has been a contributing factor behind the strong 
results showing elsewhere in Newgate globally.
Redleaf Polhill, of which 51% was acquired in the 
first half of 2014, has benefited significantly from its 
strengthening reputation, evidenced by the number of 
awards that it has won during the year. Under its 
impressive management team, the agency goes from 
strength to strength and is expected to become 
increasingly important to the Group’s overall performance.
On the consumer PR side, the start-up 
13 Communications suffered from an initial lack of critical 
mass and had taken longer than anticipated to become 
profitable. However, with new client wins, including one 
large project, this business is now profitable.
The Group’s consumer PR business has been bolstered by 
the acquisition of Publicasity at the end of 2014. Under its 
young and very enthusiastic management team, the 
company has won a number of new clients since 
becoming part of the Group which augurs well for 2015.
PPS, the other acquisition made by Porta towards the end 
of 2014, is also making a major contribution to both 
Newgate and the Group. Ranked number one by fee 
income in the PR Week Public Affairs league table, PPS 
has not only become a major contributor to Group profits 
but has also materially strengthened the Newgate 
management structure including its accounting and 
marketing functions.
Marketing and advertising 
2112, the multi-media creative communications agency, 
has built a very impressive client base which has taken 
longer than expected to be reflected on the bottom line. 
More recently, however, the quality of the work and the 
quick turnaround of each project have led to a major 
upswing in the volume of business being generated from its 
key clients. The business is now trading profitably and a 
much better performance is expected in the current year.
TTMV, the media buying agency based in Tunbridge Wells, 
struggled as a result of the loss of its two major accounts 
and the Group took the view towards the end of the 
financial year that it could no longer continue to support the 
company financially. A decision was therefore taken to 
close the company. Summit, the design studio also based 
in Tunbridge Wells, has always been profitable. Since the 
closure of TTMV, Summit has expanded its operation, 
picking up new clients and making five new hires. We 
are anticipating an even better performance from them 
this year.
Outlook
Looking to the immediate future, the priority is to build on 
a very stable platform of businesses which the Board is 
confident will continue to generate strong organic growth. 
The main emphasis will be to:
● ● Widen the range of services and products
● ● Improve geographical coverage
● ● Double the size of the business through organic and 
acquisition growth and
● ● Improve the market perception and rating
As for the current year, the performance in the first five 
months gives the Board every confidence that all the 
growth trends seen in 2014 will continue.

Newgate London
2014 was a successful year for Newgate Communications 
with strong growth in fee income and important new 
clients secured.
Organisations select Newgate because they respond to its 
ability to provide an integrated team that can effectively 
engage and manage relationships with businesses, 
investors, politicians, communities and consumers, both 
domestically and internationally.
For global fund manager, Orbis Investment, Newgate 
worked with sister agency, 13 Communications, to create a 
strategic launch plan to its direct-to-consumer platform in 
2015 with an innovative fee model. Newgate established its 
credentials by commissioning research by Cass Business 
School that highlighted the validity of that model. With its 
colleagues in Singapore, Newgate helped Euroclear, the 
Brussels-based securities post-trade group, develop its 
market positioning and messaging and obtain positive 
media coverage for forward looking programmes. 
Although Newgate works for clients from a wide range of 
industries, it has built a specialist expertise in the financial 
services area. Remarkable was one major project during 
the year for Schroders, where Newgate managed a global 
survey in 23 countries about consumers’ attitudes to 
investment. 
The successful campaigning approach was also 
recognised by TISA, the financial services agency, when it 
commissioned Newgate to handle the public relations and 
public policy for The Savings & Investment Project, a 
grouping of over 50 major companies from across the 
financial services industry. 
2014 saw Newgate use its media relations and public policy 
skills to put forward the case for exploring for natural gas 
onshore, given the UK’s dependence on foreign oil and gas 
and the benefits for employment. Newgate has been 
actively supporting UK Onshore Oil and Gas (‘UKOOG’), the 
representative body for the industry, particularly in its 
engagement over the Infrastructure Bill and its rapid rebuttal 
against anti-fracking groups. Third Energy, a company 
which has been producing gas in North Yorkshire for two 
decades, turned to Newgate to support its plans to expand 
its operations, which will involve hydraulic fracturing. 
Divisional Performance Review
For the year ended 31 December 2014
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
16 This year Newgate has confirmed its position as a major 
player in the Financial Communications sector and is 
currently advising a number of international clients who 
are coming to the market. Newgate has increased its 
dominance in the TMT, Property and Consumer areas and 
is actively involved in a number of IPOs in all three sectors. 
In addition, it is making strong inroads into other sectors, 
including Natural Resources, Industrial and Support 
Services. As an example in the period the group advised 
Wolf Materials on its £99 million fundraising, the first mine to 
be built in the UK in 45 years of tungsten mining in Devon 
and aiming for full production in the autumn of 2015.
The company continues its policy of recruiting top quality 
staff and this, coupled with the further integration of its 
divisions, with other parts of Newgate capital markets, 
is now paying dividends enabling it to further upgrade 
its offering. 
On the larger cap side the team completed its transition 
from, effectively, a start up to a more established entity 
within the capital markets team as they continued to 
develop its specialist offering of blended corporate and 
financial communications to large international corporates 
and professional services companies, as well as London 
Stock Exchange main market listed companies. The year 
was also marked by further development of our service 
offering, with the inclusion of a pure Investor Relations 
service to expand the capabilities and dialogue with our 
target clients.
The trading environment was dominated by the outlook in 
the capital markets. A positive sentiment in the first and 
second quarter saw the team take on a number of potential 
IPO mandates, the highest profile being the potential listing 
of the premium UK department store, House of Fraser. In 
the end, the business was acquired by Nanjing Cenbest, a 
leading chain of luxury Chinese department stores owned 
by Sanpower Group. This outcome exemplifies the teams’ 
expertise both in the UK market and in advising on large 
scale international mandates. However, a change in capital 
market sentiment impacted the second half of the year. 
Whilst we advised on a number of successful IPOs, we 
also saw others face this strong headwind and were 
postponed. Towards the end of the year, we advised on 
the sale of New Britain Palm Oil plc, the world’s leading 
producer of sustainable palm oil, to the Malaysian 
conglomerate Sime Darby for over £1 billion, again 
demonstrating our strong international capabilities. 
Within the UK market, we gained a number of UK client 
wins and also completed a number of Investor Relations 
mandates both on an advisory basis and as well 
completing investor audits. These provide valuable insight 
to clients on investor sentiment and potential issues for 
both UK and overseas listed companies. The year ended 
with our appointment to a global professional advisory 
business looking to acquire a UK based complementary 
business. Our successful involvement has led to Newgate 
being appointed to advise the firm on a global basis, which 
we look forward to developing in 2015.
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
17 Newgate Australia
2014 was Newgate Australia’s first full year of operations 
with year on year growth of over 200%. 
After commencing its business operations in Australia in 
mid-2013 with a handful of consultants, Newgate Australia 
began calendar year 2014 with a growing team of 
employees working out of permanent offices in Sydney, 
Melbourne and Canberra. By year end, another office had 
been opened in Brisbane and the team had grown to 40 
employees – well in excess of the original plan.
The integrated offering of financial communications, 
corporate communications, public affairs and research has 
served the business well with the operation experiencing 
growth in all practice areas. Externally, there was also a 
noticeable improvement in the activity of the financial 
markets with the return of IPO and M&A activity which 
contributed to a number of major projects for Newgate 
Australia. Corporate and government relations activity also 
grew sharply with the Group now advising as many as 90 
clients at any one time on a range of communications 
issues.
In addition, the specialist market research offering also 
continued to grow in scale and reach working with many 
corporates as well as government departments and 
agencies undertaking both qualitative and quantitative 
research work. The Research business now contributes 
18% of fee revenue across the business. 
More importantly a growing number of clients are engaging 
us for both research and consulting demonstrating the 
importance of the product mix. The milestone client in 
2014 was the Commonwealth Government’s Department 
of Finance. The Government engaged Newgate to manage 
the successful IPO of the formerly government-owned 
health insurance provider, Medibank Private.
Newgate advised the Department from its scoping study 
process to review potential sale options to its listing 
through a fully marketed Initial Public Offer to Australian 
and international investors. Newgate advised the 
Government on the retail and institutional marketing and 
communications program for the offer of shares. The $5.7 
billion IPO was the biggest Australian float since the $14 
billion partial listing of Telstra in 1997 and the third biggest 
global listing in 2014. 
Elsewhere in the business, the Sydney office was retained 
by the NSW Government to manage communications for 
the long-term lease of the NSW electricity networks. This 
project will involve a number of major transmission and 
distribution assets to be leased or partially leased over the 
next two years.
In Canberra, Federal Government relations work mandates 
steadily increased and, in the newest office in Brisbane, the 
team has picked up a number of major corporate and 
public affairs clients in the resources, infrastructure and 
agricultural sectors. 
The business continues to seek out opportunities for new 
product offerings and made significant progress in 
developing our community engagement practice which has

PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
18 resulted in the placement of four people on long-term 
secondment briefs with the nation’s largest new 
infrastructure project, the $8 billion North West Rail Link 
project in Sydney.
The research business has also successfully developed a 
new consultation/research tool which is a form of a 
deliberative forum for engagement with large community 
groups on major building and infrastructure projects. This 
dual-purpose engagement instrument has proven very 
popular with a number of clients and the Group are set to 
codify it as a discrete research/consultation offering.
Newgate Singapore
2014 was the first full trading year for the Singapore office, 
which was established in May 2013. It achieved net 
revenue of S$1.4 million. Over 80% of this revenue was 
from new business won during the year, building on the 
previous year’s client base. Approximately 45% of this 
revenue came from retained income, with these retainers 
continuing into 2015.
It was a difficult year, marked by a high level of price 
competition and the need to over-service accounts in order 
to deliver good work or to match what our competitors 
were willing to do for the same clients. On a macro level, 
the local economy was fairly bearish, with a marked 
deterioration towards the end of 2014.
On the financial communications front, the year was quiet, 
with a much smaller number of M&A and IPO deals 
compared to prior years. However, the Group still managed 
to win mandates for four of the largest and most prominent 
M&A deals in the local market, including KKR’s offer for 
Goodpack, which valued the Company at S$1.4 billion, 
and Temasek’s offer for Olam, which valued the Company 
at S$5.3 billion and was the largest M&A deal in Singapore 
during the year. The Singapore team also advised on the 
S$0.4 billion IPO of Frasers Hospitality Trust, which was 
almost 20 times oversubscribed and was one of the most 
successful IPOs of the year.
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
19 Newgate Hong Kong
2014 was a year of strong consolidation for the Hong Kong 
office, which operates as a network office under the 
Newgate brand, in terms of market presence and reach, 
staff, clients and financial performance. 
During the year, the Beijing office was opened and is being 
staffed for the growth that is foreseen in the coming years 
for both inbound and outbound activity.
In Hong Kong the management continued to build the 
team, strengthening the capabilities across both the 
international and mainland China markets.
Client retention has been strong and it has not only 
significantly grown existing client accounts, but also won 
new retained accounts and were called in to advise on a 
number of high profile contested situations.
Hong Kong undertook a number of one-off high stakes 
mandates during the year. These included campaigns for 
one of the world’s largest activist hedge funds; representing 
the liquidators of SunTech, at the time China’s largest 
default; working for a number of private equity firms on 
transactions spanning India, South East Asia, China and 
Japan; as well as advising a major consumer business on 
the crisis fallout from widespread employee disruption, theft 
and blackmail in China.
Revenues continue to grow and, notwithstanding a highly 
competitive and cost conscious market on top of the 
expense of launching the Beijing operation, the Hong Kong 
team are well positioned for positive future growth. 
In addition to building its own business, the Hong Kong 
team have been major exporters of business and new 
business opportunities to the rest of the network. Most 
recently the Hong Kong office successfully expanded the 
firm’s Asia relationship with AlixPartners to include 
Newgate’s Abu Dhabi and London offices and formed 
a dedicated client team in New York, replacing major 
global firms in all three markets.

20 Redleaf Polhill
Redleaf became part of the Porta Group in April 2014 
following the acquisition of its 51% equity interest by the 
Group. Throughout the year the company traded at record 
levels in terms of turnover and profits and ended the year 
with a stronger pipeline of new businesses than in any 
previous year. It provided communications and investor 
relations consultancy services to 105 clients, of which the 
top 10 represented 30% of revenues; no single client 
represented more than 5% of Redleaf’s revenues. 
Redleaf took advantage of the opportunity to broaden its 
scope of work, in particular by adapting and increasing 
its offering to suit current clients’ needs in digital 
communications. As such, the Agency launched 
standalone Corporate and Digital & Content teams.
Redleaf continues to enjoy exceptionally high staff retention 
levels and the Agency is very proud of the diversity of its 
team and the number of women at all levels across the 
Agency – in fact, the Agency has almost twice the number 
of female members of staff than male and its Leadership 
Board is evenly balanced in this respect. 
Notable transactions undertaken by Redleaf’s Capital 
Markets’ team included work undertaken on the John 
Laing Environmental Assets Group IPO, Constellation 
Healthcare Technologies Inc IPO, acting for both Daisy 
Group PLC and the consortium acquiring it on its public 
to private – the fifth largest public to private in the last five 
years; and Entertainment One Ltd’s purchase of Mark 
Gordon Company. The team’s new clients included finnCap 
and Stobart Group. The Investor Access team also 
organised several highly successful Private Client Broker 
days and a very well attended Tech Day.
The Agency’s Property PR team continued working with 
some of the biggest developments, most respected 
businesses and highly regarded individuals in the property 
industry. These included Gerald Ronson’s Heron 
International and all of its projects, Keith Breslauer’s Patron 
Capital, and Merchant Square – one of London’s largest 
regeneration projects that is redeveloping the area around 
Paddington Basin. The team also added to its client list 
with a number of high-quality new business wins including 
the Islington Square development, Cain Hoy Enterprises 
and Bouygues Development.
The Financial Services PR team works on a number of 
leading clients such as Western Union Business Solutions 
and HSBC Global Asset Management. Campaigns included 
preparatory work for an integrated marketing campaign –  
CII Made Simple – which will be launched in 2015 to provide 
consumers with easily accessible and straightforward 
information on insurance; the work included a website, a 
series of informative guides, an app, and a social media 
campaign. Premier Benefits, a leading employee benefits 
consultancy, and Jamieson Corporate Finance were some of 
the new clients won by the team in 2014. 
Redleaf enjoyed a record number of award wins during the 
year with each of its teams winning or being shortlisted for 
an award: Grant Thornton Quoted Company Awards – PR 
Firm of the Year; UK Stock Market Awards in association 
with KPMG: Winner Best Adviser – Financial PR; Estates 
Gazette Property Marketing Awards: 2014 Winner 
International Property Marketing Campaign of the Year 
(Residential); Shortlisting in the CIPR Excellence Awards 
2014: Crisis Campaign of the Year; and the Corporate 
Communications Young Communicator of the Year. Emma 
Kane has also been shortlisted in the Real Business/CBI 
First Women Awards in the Media category.
We maximise our clients’ 
impact by offering new insights  
into issues and audiences, and 
by finding fresh and exciting 
ways to deliver messages.
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
21 PPS Group, the specialist public affairs and PR business, 
joined the Porta Group in November 2014. PPS helps 
companies secure planning permission for major projects. 
Working from a network of offices across the UK, PPS 
represents housebuilders, energy companies, supermarket 
operators and infrastructure providers.
The acquisition was on the back of a positive year for PPS 
which saw the firm handle some of the country’s most high 
profile engagement activities. Some of the highlights from 
2014 include:
● ● Consultation on a second runway at Gatwick Airport 
which saw PPS staff have face-to-face conversations 
with over 8,000 local people in 16 locations. 
● ● Working for Caudrilla Resources engaging the 
communities around the Bowland Basin and 
Balcombe on fracking and gas extraction.
● ● Helping Severn Trent Water present its biggest ever 
capital project – an alternative supply of water for 
Birmingham following in the footsteps of the Victorian 
engineers who built the Elan Valley Aqueduct. 
● ● Consulting on the London Paramount scheme –  
a world-class themed resort in Kent and the first 
commercial National Strategic Infrastructure Project.
PPS also worked on many smaller developments up and 
down the UK, from housing projects in the South West to 
wind farms in Scotland. The firm maintains a professional 
and innovative approach and, in 2014, launched a new 
product called Community Insight, which helps 
housebuilders map local communities around their sites 
and target the households most likely to be supportive of 
their plans.
PPS brings a strong income stream and 50 specialist staff 
to Newgate Communications into which it has been 
integrated. The two firms have a strong fit given both 
companies expertise in energy, property and retail clients.
PPS is ranked No 1 
in the PR Week 
league tables for 
Public Affairs 
companies in terms 
of fees generated in 
2014.

22 13 Communications
13 Communications completed its first full year of operation 
in 2014 where it joined forces with the other strong brands 
in the Porta Group to offer consumer and business to 
business agency services, doubling its size over the period.
Towards the end of the year 13 Communications ran the 
launch of one of London’s most exciting and large-scale 
developments, Silvertown, while other significant projects 
included the new shared economy transportation service 
DriveNow from BMW and Sixt and assisted with the 
communications programme for Network Rail South. 
During the year, 13 Communications won accounts such 
as The Silvertown Partnership, site of East London’s most 
exciting new development, a new communications 
outreach programme for Network Rail, Orbis, a new 
financial services website, SCM Direct, a new consumer 
investment service, QualitySolicitors, representing over 200 
regional law firms in the UK and Allen Carr Easyway Group, 
the smoking cessation company.
The projects for these clients involved the major first step in 
the East End’s most exciting new development through a 
new piece of social video content by local students to the 
area, then launched a new addiction series for Allen Carr 
which resulted in major impact in social media and 
mainstream media leading to discussions in The Welsh 
Assembly. In addition the team created new data-led 
content for Network Rail that became posters and leaflets 
at Network Rail Southern Stations and via social media.
Apart from the Silvertown Partnership project 
13 Communications also worked alongside Newgate on 
clients such as SCM Direct and Orbis. In return they 
introduced Newgate at the end of the calendar year to 
QualitySolicitors. Having worked successfully with Newgate 
and with 2112 Communications for a new campaign for 
The Caravan Club, 13 Communications now has sight of 
more exciting integrated opportunities with members of the 
Porta Group.
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
23 Publicasity
Publicasity, acquired towards the end of 2014, delivered a 
robust performance with record project fees from its strong 
client base in line with the current market trend for more 
project based work vs retained. Fee income totalled just 
under £2.9 million with an overall annual staff to fee ratio 
of 57.8%.
During the year Publicasity introduced an additional client 
offer, ‘Creative Services’ encompassing video production 
and design to drive additional fee income and a more 
integrated offer alongside PR & digital communications. 
The largest clients in 2014 reflected the key sectors it 
operates in, from ‘Food & Drink’ with Britvic, Heineken and 
Bacardi Brown-Forman (whose brands include Bacardi, 
Grey Goose, Bombay Sapphire, Martini, Southern Comfort 
and Jack Daniel’s) to ‘Travel & Leisure’ with Visit Orlando, 
Bermuda Tourism and Kia Motors, and finally ‘Lifestyle’ 
with Vitamix, TJX Europe HomeSense, Grosvenor Casinos 
Rank Entertainment Group and Build-A-Bear Workshop. 
These top 10 clients represented two thirds of the total 
annual fee income, but with no one client representing 
more than 9%.
Notable new business wins in 2014 included Jacques Vert 
Group, which was a breakthrough client into the fashion 
industry, and Treasury Wine Estates, whose portfolio of 
brands includes Lindeman’s, Wolf Blass and Penfolds. 
Key Assignments & Creative Campaigns during the year 
included the Bermuda X-factor which involved the filming 
of the X factor judges’ houses in Bermuda generating over 
60 pieces of coverage and 58 minutes of primetime TV 
coverage. The team not only negotiated the campaign with 
the TV programmes, but hosted the production crew on 
the island and managed the press and social media 
campaign. As a result of this destination profile, holiday 
enquiries to Bermuda grew on average by 30% with its key 
tour operator partners. 
Visit Orlando on Good Morning Britain – in association with 
British Airways, Walt Disney World & Universal, Publicasity 
created a campaign entitled ‘Orlando cheers up the Nation’ 
with ITV’s breakfast TV show, Good Morning Britain. This 
launched in September with a nationwide search for 100 
‘Funseekers’ to experience the very best of the destination 
and ran over three months. Highlights included Jack

24 Osborne fronting the TV editorial, record competition entry 
level at almost 30,000 entries and Orlando was seen by 
3.5 million TV viewers every day and 1.75 million on social 
media channels. The total value of the exposure was 
slightly over £0.5 million and BA saw holiday enquiries to 
the destination grew by 30%.
The Desperados Experience – on the B2B communications 
the main challenge was to encourage retailers and 
publicans to stock Heineken’s top performing range of 
Beer and Cider, and in particular their spirit beer brand, 
Desperados.
Publicasity launched the Desperados Ex-SPEER-ience, an 
integrated, multi-touchpoint campaign over an eight-week 
period that included trade press (PR & advertising), online 
& social media, direct mail, point of sale activation in cash 
and carries and exposure at trade events. 
The campaign gave the trade over 700,000 opportunities 
to read about Desperados and Spirit Beers whilst the 
Desperados Ex-SPEER-ience cash & carry days increased 
sales by an average of 2,043%. Overall the eight-week 
campaign helped Heineken grow the brand by 32%, 
adding an additional £5 million in retail sales value.

25 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING
2112 Communications
2014 has been a year of establishment, change and growth.
At the beginning of 2014, 2112 Communications was a 
start-up of little more than a year. The Agency had 14 staff 
(including 4 from Crazy Horse, a direct marketing company 
acquired by Porta in 2013 and rebranded as 2112 Direct) 
and was in the process of establishing its credentials as a 
market leading multi-media creative communications agency. 
At the outset it was all about building relationships with 
clients who have now become significant to the Agency 
including: BNY Mellon Investment Management, Hermes 
Investment Management, Henderson Global Investors, 
JP Morgan Asset Management, Civilised Money, 
Killik & Co., Blind Veterans UK, Marie Curie Cancer Care, 
working for them on a project-by-project basis.
Throughout the year there was a steady build up in the 
Agency both in terms of capabilities and headcount which 
generated a substantial upturn in fees. Over this period 
headcount increased to 45 people while gross income rose 
200%. The first half of 2014 was extremely active with 
client assignments and corporate development. In January, 
2112 started working with the Caravan Club, the UK’s 
longest standing membership organisation and launched a 
national advertising campaign for Blind Veterans UK. Later 
during the year, 2112 launched the Junior and Adult ISA 
campaigns for The Children’s Mutual and redesigned 
Confidant, the customer quarterly magazine of wealth 
manager Killik & Co. The Agency was also appointed as 
the creative services partner of BNY Mellon Investment 
Management. In addition, 2112 amalgamated into the 
Agency the design, print management and digital 
businesses of sports marketing agency, WSM which 
brought some excellent people and clients such as The 
Economist, Financial Times, CMC Markets and Zip Car.
During the second half of the year 2112 created a film for 
Timothy Taylor’s Championship Beers, celebrating Le 
Grand Depart of the Tour de France in Yorkshire, rebranded 
Hermes Investment Management, launched a press and 
digital advertising campaign for JP Morgan Asset 
Management, designed and produced an online mash-up 
to promote Capital Radio’s Jingle Bell Ball and created the 
Christmas Appeal for Breast Cancer Care.
Continued delivery of high quality design, digital and print 
projects has ensured that the relationships with all major 
clients continue to thrive in 2015.

26 Summit 
Summit had a successful 2014, increasing the amount of 
business from existing clients as well as growing in new 
areas with some new business wins.
Summit’s long-term relationship with AXA PPP healthcare 
continued to grow throughout 2014, with Summit taking on 
numerous projects to support their wider marketing 
communications strategy.
Summit were also involved with the steady growth of AXA 
PPP international into new territories, especially with the 
launch of their new global division, working on their 
communications across all areas of the business.
A key new business gain was AXA Assistance, the arm that 
provides worldwide assistance services including motor, 
home and travel assistance. The first major project was 
designing the website to launch the motor breakdown 
product for a consumer audience.
Summit also undertook a rebranding project for Beale & Co, 
the international law firm specialising in the construction 
industry, while the growth in the digital arena and continued 
success with other clients bodes well for 2015 and beyond.

27 Results for the year
The Group’s revenue for 2014 on continuing operations 
of £23.3 million was 151% higher than the prior year 
comparatives from continuing operations (2013 restated: 
£9.3 million). This year’s revenue includes £7.3 million from 
acquired businesses which helped replace revenue of 
£10.3 million generated by discontinued operations in 
2014 which have been excluded from the headline 
revenue figure as reported under IFRS. Although the gross 
profit margin of 83% of total revenue in 2014 was 6% 
lower than the previous year, the gross profit of £19.4 
million was 135% higher compared with gross profit 
generated by continuing operations in 2013. Of this, 
75% was attributed to organic growth.
Administrative expenses of £20.2 million (2013 restated: 
£10.9 million) were 85% higher mainly as a result of an 
increase in employment costs, predominantly coming from 
acquisitions made during the year, with staff numbers being 
136% higher compared with the previous restated year. 
At 31 December 2014, the Group finished with 262 total 
staff, of which 129 came with acquisitions made during the 
year. The remainder of the increase was mainly attributed 
to higher amortisation charges on acquired intangibles (in 
particular brands and customer lists).
The operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, 
interest and taxation (‘EBITDA’) from continuing operations 
of £0.7 million is a significant improvement from the £2.2 
million loss in 2013. This positive improvement is due to 
both organic growth and the contribution of new 
acquisitions in the year which are well established and 
profitable businesses. 
However, the Board does not believe that the stated results 
truly reflect the underlying performance during the year as 
they include a number of exceptional and non-recurring 
costs. The Directors believe that it is more appropriate to 
analyse the results of the Group before start-up losses, 
acquisition costs, restructuring costs, non-recurring 
property costs, share based payments, bad debts, 
impairment, legal and other professional costs, and 
depreciation and amortisation in order to help understand 
better the Group’s financial performance. Taking these 
adjustments into account gives a core underlying adjusted 
positive EBITDA of £2,189,444 (2013 restated: £738,133).

Group Finance Director’s Review (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
30 After taking into account amortisation and depreciation, including a charge on intangible assets such as brands and 
customer lists acquired with WSM, Redleaf, PPS and Publicasity, the overall operating loss for the year was £777,140 
(2013 restated: £2,637,534 loss).
Finance costs for the year, including movements on exchange rates, were £689,288 (2013 restated: £468,877) arising 
principally on the discounted bond from Hawk Investment Holdings Limited and a loan from Retro Grand Limited granted 
during the year to fund acquisitions.
In view of the Board’s expectation that the Group will be profitable going forward, the Group has recognised the benefit of 
certain tax losses incurred during the year, combined with movements in deferred tax, resulting in an overall credit to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year of £302,530 (2013 restated: £669,124) and a deferred tax asset carried 
forward in the Statement of Financial Position of £1,449,871 (2013: £1,091,742). In addition, the Group has unrecognised 
tax losses carried forward amounting to £3,400,000 (2013: £2,500,000) which it may be able to utilise in relieving tax 
payments going forward.
The loss for the Group from continuing operations for the year after tax was £1,169,924 (2013 restated: £2,463,128). After 
taking into account the loss on discontinued operations for the year of £2,480,674, the loss after tax on all operations for the 
year was £3,650,598 (2013 restated: £2,477,197).
Several Group subsidiaries, which include Limited Liability Partnerships, have non-controlling interests, either as shareholders 
or as partners, designed to retain and reward the management of those entities. There are two subsidiaries that have 
material non-controlling interests, Newgate Australia and Redleaf Polhill (note 11). In the case of the Limited Liability 
Partnerships, the partnership shares due to those partners are deducted in arriving at operating profit or loss. However, in 
the case of incorporated subsidiary companies, the non-controlling shareholdings are shown as ‘non-controlling interests’ 
and their share of dividends and profits or losses are deducted after arriving at the profit or loss after taxation. Taking these 
into account, the loss attributable to the equity shareholders of the Group itself for the year was £3,767,767 (2013 restated: 
£2,775,144). Loss per share was 0.6p for the year (2013 restated: 2.0p loss) on continuing activities and loss of 1.7p (2013 
restated: 2.0p loss) for the year on continuing and discontinued activities combined.

Communications
The Communications division has added new businesses in 2014 with the acquisition of Redleaf Polhill, PPS Group and 
Publicasity in the UK and Newgate Singapore which was a start-up in 2013. They joined the existing Newgate businesses of 
Newgate Communications, Newgate Threadneedle, 13 Communications and Newgate Australia. Further details of the 
acquisitions made during the year are provided in note 10 to the financial statements. The Group announced during the year 
its intention to integrate the capital markets teams from Newgate and Newgate Threadneedle in the UK to trade as Newgate 
Communications, looking to build on the solid base of retained clients and covering the main market as well as AIM.
The Group expanded the Newgate brand internationally by creating a company in Beijing, to help bolster the Newgate 
business in Hong Kong which has been operating since 2013. This new company is expected to deliver further growth for 
the Group in Mainland China. While the newly established company is a start-up, the Group has been fortunate to sign 
highly-regarded, seasoned professionals from the local market to bolster and strengthen the Newgate brand. 
Globally, the Communications division has increased its client list to over 600 at 31 December 2014 compared with 275 at 
the start of the year. In the course of 2014, Redleaf received significant industry recognition, winning a number of prestigious 
awards for PR and marketing such as PR Firm of the year (Grant Thornton Quoted Company Awards 2014), Best Financial

For the year ended 31 December 2014
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
32 PR Advisor (UK Stock Market Awards 2014) and Best Marketing Campaign International Residential – Estates Gazette 
Property Market Awards 2014. Newgate was recognised as the fastest growing agency globally in 2014 and, as a result, 
was shortlisted for the EMEA Corporate Agency of 2014 by Holmes Report, the global authority on the PR industry. PR 
Week acknowledged PPS as leading the 2014 public affairs league tables in fee income generated.
Although a number of the businesses within this division are still within the start-up phase, the division overall has 
demonstrated an outstanding performance, finishing the year reporting revenue of £18,778,650 (2013: £8,291,894), of 
which 73% was organic growth; gross profit of £16,714,182 (2013: £7,387,819), of which 73% was organic growth; positive 
EBITDA of £1,954,687 (2013: £582,136), of which 60% was organic growth; operating profit of £885,053 (2013: £272,399), 
of which 93.5% was organic growth; and 203 staff employed (2013: 75), of which 44% were organic new hires.
Marketing and Advertising
The Marketing and Advertising division comprises 2112 Communications and TwentyFour Seven Studios, the businesses that 
were formed by two start-ups in 2012 and which were subsequently merged into one 2112 Communications business as of 
1 January 2014. It also includes the direct marketing agency 2112 Direct (formerly Crazy Horse) which was acquired in 2013. 
These businesses share the same office premises and operate closely together providing an integrated direct and digital 
marketing service including creative input, brand consultancy and advertising, strategic digital input, media planning and 
buying in the financial services, business services and not-for-profit sectors.
The division also includes Summit Marketing Services Limited, the design studio located in Tunbridge Wells which was 
acquired in 2013, and contributes to the professional expertise and quality of services offering of this division.
During 2014, the Group acquired WSM Print and WSM Digital which provide full studio design and art-working capabilities 
and a full digital design and production unit, servicing a range of blue chip clients. Since their acquisition, they have been 
successfully integrated into the 2112 Communications operation.
Prior to 31 December 2014, the Group’s marketing and advertising division included Twenty20 Media Group (‘TTMG’) that was 
acquired in 2012 and in which Porta owned 90%. Historically the revenue and gross profit margins of TTMG made a profitable 
contribution to the financial performance of the Group. However, TTMG’s business started to diminish in early 2014, 
deteriorating rapidly over the second half of 2014. By 31 December 2014, TTMG had lost the majority of its key clients who 
experienced a slowdown in advertising spending. As a consequence, TTMG was not able to settle its outstanding liabilities in 
order to continue to trade and would have required a continuous and substantial injection of working capital for the foreseeable 
future. The Group supported TTMG throughout the majority of 2014, providing financial help with a £450,000 cash injection. 
However, without a viable business and business plan going forward, the Group made a decision to put the main operating 
company within TTMG into administration and the other companies of this sub-group into voluntary liquidation. All businesses 
within the sub-group had ceased trading by 31 December 2014. In accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’), TTMG has been treated as a discontinued operation in 2014 and the results of this sub-group for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 and related comparative figures have been presented accordingly. Further details are given in note 9 
of these financial statements. 
In total, the Marketing and advertising division (continuing businesses) overall finished the year reporting revenue of £4,762,555 
(2013 restated: £1,574,381); gross profit of £2,539,795 (2013 restated: £1,000,868); EBITDA profit of £436,765 (2013 restated: 
£772,933 loss); operating profit of £261,375 (2013 restated: £783,562 loss); and employed a total of 45 people (2013 restated: 26).
Head office (central costs)
The central costs of the Group comprise the ongoing costs of running a growing international public company. These costs 
have been affected in 2014 by the expenses involved in acquiring companies, relocating to new office premises in the UK and 
non-recurring legal and administrative costs in establishing the Group as it evolves into a global integrated business. Total 
central costs before taxation have slightly reduced from £2,511,698 in 2013 to £2,425,372, with a 72% reduction (£1,546,798) 
in start-up costs funded by head office, and a 42% reduction (£204,222) in legal and professional consultancy costs, offset by 
increases of £248,056 in acquisition costs, £132,197 in bad and doubtful debts and £85,902 in share based payments, 
accompanied by non-recurring property costs of £323,536 related to new office premises. The increased levels of one-off and 
non-recurring costs were in line with management expectations for the scale and nature of the growing Group.

PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
34 The rapid growth of the Group has also had a significant 
impact on the cash flow position. The Group reduced its 
loss before tax position by almost 53% compared to the 
prior year. The overall working capital cycle is improved with 
both trade receivables and payables turnaround days being 
aligned at the end of 2014. The receivables turnaround 
remained unchanged and represented 87 days similar to 
2013, while the trade payables turnaround decreased 
by 2 days to 87 days. Cash outflow from operating 
activities includes a £1.0 million rent deposit placed on the 
new office premises.
Net cash outflow from investing activities is almost £3.2 
million higher than 2013 as a result of an increase in the 
number of acquisitions (net of cash acquired) made in 2014. 
These acquisitions were 53/47 funded with cash and loan 
notes/shares respectively (2013: 60/40). The significant 
increase in the depreciation and amortisation charge 
during the year of 240% compared to 2013 has been 
accompanied by a 230% increase in volume of fixed 
assets purchased.
Net cash generated from financing activities has decreased 
by approximately £0.4 million compared to 2013, generating 
net cash inflow of £6.9 million. This is mainly attributable to 
repayment of the loans and borrowings for a total of £2.6 
million during the year (detailed below in note 23), offset by a 
fund raising of £7.0 million and new borrowings of £3.0 
million (detailed below).
A fund raising of £7.0 million (before expenses) was 
completed during the first quarter of the year by the issue of 
53,846,153 shares at 13p per share. This issue was fully 
subscribed through a placing and was approved at a 
General Meeting of the Company on 11 March 2014. The 
funds were used by the Group to implement its next phase 
of growth as well as to reduce debt and related interest 
charges which had an overall positive impact on the ability 
of the Group to develop its income streams.
The Group obtained £3.0 million in new loan facilities during 
the year from Retro Grand Limited and issued £1.6 million in 
loan notes. The new loan and the loan notes were utilised 
on the acquisitions of Publicasity and PPS. In addition, the 
Group entered into a finance lease agreement relating to the 
fit-out of the new premises for a total amount of £0.4 million. 
The great majority of the working capital funding for the 
Group has been raised in the parent company, as a central 
cost, and this is reflected in Group central liabilities at the 
year end. Although the net debt position has increased 
from £3.1 million at the beginning of the year to £5.6 million, 
the net debt to equity ratio has been slightly improved from 
33% in 2013 down to 27% at the end of the current 
reporting year. 
Post year-end
On 13 May 2015 the Company granted options over an 
aggregate of 8,070,000 Ordinary shares to certain employees 
of the Group, all with an exercise price of 10p per share under 
its Enterprise Management Incentive and Unapproved Share 
Option Plan (‘EMI and Unapproved Plans’). The options vest 
in three equal tranches on the first, second and third 
anniversary of the grant of the options, and will expire on the 
tenth anniversary of grant.
On 28 May 2015 the Group is expected to complete the 
reorganisation of the Newgate companies and, as part of this 
reorganisation, the 49% minority interest in Newgate 
Communications LLP (and one other LLP) will be bought out 
in consideration for the issue of 9,754,000 Porta Ordinary 
Shares. The Porta Ordinary Shares remain subject to a 
minimum 12 month lock-in period with a further 12 month 
orderly market period.  
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
35 The Group is exposed to a range of various risks which may affect its performance. The management team of the Group 
performs regular exercises to identify, evaluate and report new risks facing the business as well as reviews the 
appropriateness and relativity of earlier identified risks by the Board. The process is designed to manage these risks and to 
ensure all necessary mitigating actions are considered and undertaken in a timely manner. However no system of control or 
mitigation can completely eliminate the risks inherent in achieving the Group’s business objectives. The existing risk 
management process adopted by the Board of Directors can therefore provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or potential loss. 
The Directors identified a number of risks and uncertainties which they believe may affect the Group’s ability to deliver its 
strategic goals as at 31 December 2014. A list of these risks is summarised below. This list does not purport to be an 
exhaustive summary of the risks affecting the Group, is given in no particular order of priority and contains risks considered 
to be outside the control of the Directors. 
Risk trend key:
            Increased from 2013                Decreased from 2013                       No change
Specific Risks Mitigation
Acquisitions and disposals (strategic risk)
The pursuit of our Group business strategy the 
Board of Directors views through economically 
sound development activities such as strategic 
acquisitions and disposals. 
Whilst good terms have been agreed on 
acquisitions in the past, there can be no guarantee 
that the Directors will continue to be able to agree 
the acquisitions of further suitable companies  
and/or businesses on acceptable terms or any 
guarantee that the Group will be able to raise 
sufficient future finance at such time. There is also 
a risk that any acquisition is based on inaccurate 
information or assumptions, or the new business is 
not integrated effectively which overall may result in 
less financially beneficial than anticipated post-
acquisition performance. 
During the year, we acquired five new businesses 
and made a decision to discontinue media and 
creative agencies in Tunbridge Wells. Notes 9 and 
10 to the financial statements provide further details.
We mitigate these risks by having rigorous external 
and internal due diligence procedures to identify 
and evaluate potential risks prior to agreeing the 
acquisition terms; applying robust valuation models; 
and agreeing suitable warranties and indemnities 
from the vendors. In addition, the total 
consideration paid for the business typically 
includes an element of deferred consideration 
contingent upon future performance which 
mitigates the risk of overpaying for a business.
There is a clear focus on integrating acquired 
businesses over the deferred consideration period 
and close monitoring of the post-acquisition 
performances.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
For the year ended 31 December 2014
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
36 Specific Risks Mitigation
Management of growth (strategic risk)
The ability of the Group to implement its strategy 
requires effective planning and management control 
systems. The speed at which the business 
develops may place a significant strain on the 
Group’s management, operational, financial and 
personnel resources. Failure to expand and improve 
operational, financial and management information 
and quality control systems in line with the Group’s 
growth could have a detrimental impact on the 
trading performance of the Group.
The Group has an experienced management team 
and a number of highly experienced external 
advisers. The Board of Directors continuously 
reviews and enhances the existing strategy for the 
integration and management of the expected 
business growth.
New markets and channels of service offering 
(strategic risk)
As we enter new markets through acquisition of 
local businesses or starting up new offices overseas 
we may achieve lower than anticipated trading 
volumes or higher costs and resources 
requirements. This may impact the level of overall 
group profitability and negatively reflect on cash 
flows.
 
We have a thorough process for assessing and 
planning the entry into new markets and related 
opportunities with the help of qualified and 
experienced local advisers. We continuously assess 
our performance in those new markets and the 
related opportunities and risks. 
Global economic trends and client 
dependency (economic risk)
Our Group provides an integrated service offering 
to our clients across the globe. Poor economic 
conditions in home countries of our clients can 
increase the average debtor days’ period and thus 
put pressure on the Group’s working capital. There 
is also an increased risk of bad debts occurring as 
a result of clients’ financial situation. 
During the year Group had a higher bad debt 
expenditure compared to the previous reporting 
period as a result of financial difficulties experienced 
by some of our clients. 
 
Due to a wide spread of clients across the world 
and various industry sectors, the Group reduces its 
reliance on any particular economic environment or 
particular client. The Group performs weekly 
reviews of cash flows from all operations as well as 
regularly reviews new business wins/losses across 
all Group companies. 
The Group closely reports and monitors aged debts 
and ensures that local management has an action 
plan in place to minimise the risks of any resulting 
loss. The Group also closely monitors the level of 
fees generated from each client and is continuously 
seeking opportunities to expand existing client 
portfolios. In 2014 our largest individual client 
represented 5% and our top 10 clients accounted 
for 19% of the total revenue.
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
37 Specific Risks Mitigation
Future funding (strategic risk)
Although there are no immediate plans, the 
Company may need to raise extra capital in the 
future to develop fully the Group’s business and to 
take advantage of future acquisition opportunities. 
No assurance can be given that any such additional 
financing will be available or that, if available, it will 
be available on terms favourable to the Company or 
the shareholders. 
If further financing is obtained by issuing equity 
securities or convertible debt securities, the 
shareholders’ holdings of Ordinary shares may be 
diluted and the new securities may carry rights, 
privileges and preferences superior to the Ordinary 
shares. The Directors may seek debt finance to fund 
all or part of any future acquisition. There can be no 
assurance that the Company will be able to raise 
such funds, either on acceptable terms or at all. If 
debt financing is obtained, the Company’s ability to 
raise funds and its ability to operate its business 
may be subject to restrictions.
A number of factors (including changes in interest 
rates, conditions in the banking market and general 
economic conditions which are beyond the 
Company’s control) may make it difficult for the 
Company to obtain new financing on attractive 
terms or even at all. If the Company’s borrowings 
become more expensive, then the Company’s 
profits will be adversely affected.
The Group has a number of short- and long-term 
borrowings to fund the working capital needs of the 
business and/or future acquisitions. The Board of 
Directors and executive management team closely 
monitor the level of debt and ensure all borrowings 
are utilised appropriately in accordance with terms 
and conditions of issue. Rigorous cash reviews of 
expenditures and collections are performed on a 
weekly basis across all Group companies to ensure 
the targeted cash levels are maintained at each 
reporting date.  
Restructuring activities (strategic risk)
Continuously increasing acquisitions and necessary 
integration of new businesses within the Group 
inevitably requires restructuring of our existing 
activities to streamline our business and reduce the 
cost base. This includes downsizing of under-
performing divisions and business units as part of an 
effective cost management programme. Historically 
and to date these activities have progressed well 
and have had an immediate positive impact on the 
Group going forward. 
The Group continues to closely manage these 
activities by assigning specific internal teams 
responsible for regular and timely reporting of the 
progress and results against set targets and by 
using other internal and external expertise. The 
Group seeks to remain fair towards all members of 
staff affected by the changes through transparent 
and regular consultation with those members of 
staff during such periods. We are separately 
tracking the costs and benefits of these projects 
to ensure that we can compare their actual 
performance against our expectations while 
monitoring the underlying results of the business. 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
38 Specific Risks Mitigation
Attraction and retention of key employees 
(operational risk)
The Group depends on the continued service and 
performance of the senior management team and 
whilst it has entered into contractual arrangements 
with these individuals with the aim of securing the 
services of each of them, retention of their services 
cannot be guaranteed. The loss of the services of 
the Group Chief Executive, the Finance Director or 
other key employees could damage the Group’s 
business. Equally, the ability to attract new 
employees and senior executives with the 
appropriate expertise and skills cannot be 
guaranteed. The Group may experience difficulties 
in hiring appropriate employees and the failure to 
do so may have a detrimental effect upon the 
trading performance of the Group.
 
We recognise that it is important to motivate and 
retain talented people across our businesses to 
ensure that we are not exposed to the risk of 
unplanned staff turnover. The Group’s policy is to 
recruit both senior management and staff of the 
highest quality and to remunerate them accordingly. 
The Group carries out succession planning and 
provides promotion opportunities as well as 
operating both short-term and long-term incentive 
plans to motivate and retain key personnel. The 
Group takes employees’ health and safely very 
seriously and has appropriate processes in place to 
monitor and address any issues accordingly. 
Working capital (operational risk)
Lack of timely cash collections from our clients 
result in increased working capital requirements at 
an increased cash costs to the Group. 
Working capital implications are an integral 
component of contract negotiations. The Group 
seeks to agree advance billing terms whenever 
possible. 
Information systems (IT) and data security 
(operational and business risks)
Any information system failure could negatively 
impact on the Group business operations, including 
delays to client work. 
Unauthorised access to confidential information 
due to inadequate security of the data could 
compromise our client relationships and have a 
detrimental effect on our reputation. 
Failure to maintain robust disaster recovery plans 
may result in significant loss of resources and cause 
a major disruption to overall business operations.
 
The Group maintains fit for purpose IT systems 
managed and reviewed by both in-house and third 
party IT specialists in a timely manner. All significant 
IT related investments are subject to business case 
assessments performed by the Group management 
and, where appropriate, by the Board.
Extensive business and IT disaster recovery plans 
have been implemented by each company and are 
tested to minimise any disruption in the event of an 
IT failure. It is local management responsibility to 
perform regular reviews of those plans to ensure 
they remain dynamic and robust.
External access to data is protected by the Group’s 
IT security, which is frequently tested for malicious 
attacks and/or more general virus infections to 
ensure that the Group’s network is as secure as 
possible. Internal access to data is restricted. 
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
39 Specific Risks Mitigation
Failure to maintain an acceptable standard of 
business ethics (business risk)
Both reputational and operational damage may 
arise if the Group engaged in actual or perceived 
unethical client work. Ethical matters that are not 
identified or managed appropriately could cause 
reputational damage to the Group. 
 
The Board has implemented a robust governance 
framework including a Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics that is incorporated into our Staff Hand 
Book and is communicated to all employees. The 
Code provides clear guidance on how the members 
of staff are expected to behave towards other 
colleagues, suppliers, customers, shareholders and 
on our wider responsibility to the communities 
within which we operate. All employees are 
expected to comply with the Code and any 
violations of it are reported to local management or 
the Group HR for review. 
Legal and regulatory compliance 
(compliance risk)
Any failure to adhere to legislative requirements 
could affect both the reputation and performance 
as well as causing financial damage to the Group.
 
The Group is advised by external legal counsel 
throughout the world on local legal and regulatory 
requirements and minimises the risk of loss. 
Policies on gifts, entertainment, share trading and 
confidentiality are communicated to all employees 
through the Staff Hand Book.
Financial risk management
Details of the Group’s approach to financial risk management are disclosed in detail in note 7 to the financial statements.

40 Corporate Social Responsibility 
The Board believes that acting responsibly should be a main 
consideration in everything that we do. The Group is 
therefore committed to demonstrating the importance of 
this, not only in our work for clients, but in our own working 
practices and the communities in which we live. We are 
involved in the business of managing brands and corporate 
reputations on behalf of clients and the Board acknowledges 
that being socially responsible while taking steps to minimise 
our impact on the environment through our actions and 
those of our many clients and suppliers is an important 
factor in the management of our own business.
Porta Communications PLC focuses on the key areas of the 
Community, Environment, our Marketplace and the 
Workplace we create for our teams.
Our Community
Porta’s approach is centred on working hard to maximise 
the positive in all that we do. 
The growing team of talented individuals within the business 
are encouraged to support our community in London and 
globally in the pro-bono work that we do supporting projects 
where we feel we can make a difference.
Porta has identified two charities where it believes it can 
make a difference:
     
Centrepoint’s vision is to end youth homelessness and to 
give homeless young people a future. The organisation is 
the UK’s leading charity for youth homelessness and 
provides housing and support for 1,000 homeless young 
people aged 16-25 each year. Porta is working to build a 
comprehensive partnership centred on sharing our key skills 
with the charity and our energy in fund raising and 
participating in major events.
HEART UK helps anyone affected by raised cholesterol by 
bringing people together providing information, support, 
education and campaigning for improved identification and 
standards of care. Their vision is that by 2016, the majority 
of UK adults will know their cholesterol levels, understand 
the impact and be taking any necessary action.
We believe that by working with these charities we can help 
make a difference and have an ongoing objective to support 
more industry initiatives and projects alongside our clients.
Environment
We work hard to understand our impact on the environment 
and take steps to reduce our impact through our actions,

evenings and weekends to reduce any unnecessary 
power consumption and rainwater is used in the 
buildings waste disposal system.

42 Chairman’s Introduction to Corporate 
Governance
For the year ended 31 December 2014
Dear shareholder
Welcome to the Governance Section of Porta’s 2014 Annual 
Report and Accounts. The purpose of this report is to 
explain the Board’s commitment to good corporate 
governance, corporate responsibility and ethical standards. 
We believe that effective governance is an essential 
contributor in the pursuit of the objectives that are in the 
interests of the Company and its shareholders and to our 
sustained improvement in business performance. 
Accountability, integrity and transparency are key operating 
pillars for any business and here at Porta we have 
established practices to ensure that the Group is run in such 
a way. The Board’s aim is to nurture a working environment 
in which the highest standards of behaviour are established, 
demonstrated and maintained in all our activities. This helps 
us to run the Group effectively whilst pursuing our long-term 
success, identifying and assessing risks, ensuring the health 
and safety of our people and the environment in which we 
operate.  The Board actively considers long-term strategy, 
monitors, and challenges and supports the work of the 
executive team and is responsible for the Board’s and the 
executive management’s succession.
There are well-defined differences in roles between the 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors and their combined 
contribution as an experienced team add value to the 
debate, decision making and development of strategy that 
are so crucial to the Group’s success. My role as Chairman 
is to provide the leadership to ensure high quality decision 
making in all areas of strategy, performance, responsibility 
and accountability.
As a Board, we have ultimate responsibility for the Group’s 
performance and for overseeing the management of risk. 
We seek to do this through a strong and effective 
governance system and by setting the standards that we 
expect from all our employees. 
Diversity 
The Board comprises of two Executive Directors and three 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman. The Group 
acknowledges that the diversity should be considered 
broadly. It is important to achieve the right balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board. The Group will 
continue seeking opportunities to expand the range and 
capabilities of the existing Board.
Development of strategy
The Board’s work on defining our short- and long-term 
strategic priorities at this important stage in the Group’s 
development is receiving increased focus. During the 
monthly board meetings we perform brief strategy reviews 
considering progress to date and future plans to take 
advantage of the significant opportunities that have been 
identified. More details are included in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 50 to 53.
Remuneration 
The Group’s remuneration policy seeks to align the 
interests of Executive Directors, senior management and 
shareholders, and is structured to enable the Group to 
attract, motivate and retain the talent required to deliver the 
business strategy. The Board is cognisant of the general 
sensitivity relating to executive director remuneration. We are 
committed to the principle that there should be no reward 
for failure and believe that the increased emphasis on 
long-term performance-related pay, longer lock-in periods 
on shares and share options and increased shareholding 
requirements are appropriate to ensure that Porta’s 
remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate risk 
taking. Further details can be found on pages 54 to 59.
Ethics and values 
All Directors and employees are required to act fairly, 
honestly and with integrity, and to demonstrate that they 
Bob Morton 
Non-Executive 
Chairman
Operating with integrity in all we do is vital to 
maintain the trust of investors, customers, our 
employees and other stakeholders. This requires 
leadership, ethical behaviour and collaboration.

”
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
43 have read and understand the Group’s Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics. We provide our employees with 
necessary training programmes to ensure an understanding 
of the requirements of relevant legislation and importance of 
compliance with it. Employee performance is measured 
each year against a set of four shared values: (1) 
operational excellence and performance results; (2) 
teamwork and pro-activity; (3) client and partner focus; and 
(4) personal skills.
Corporate responsibility 
Full details of our corporate responsibility strategy and 
achievements can be found on pages 41 and 42. 
I hope the following reports demonstrate that setting the 
corporate governance framework continues to be a key 
focus for the Board. We must always be conscious of the 
fact that the Board’s primary responsibility is to promote 
the long-term success of the Group for the benefit of 
shareholders, clients, and all stakeholders, including 
employees. I am confident that we are well positioned 
to continue providing value to all of our stakeholders.

The Directors view employees as the key asset of the Group.

and resource on the Group’s employees, including initiatives 
on subjects such as wellbeing, engagement and training. 
As at 31 December 2014, the Group employed 262 people 
(2013 restated: 111) globally in its continuing operations. 
The Group takes its responsibilities to its employees seriously 
and is committed to high standards of employment practice. 
The Group’s aim is to develop successful employees who 
will grow with the Group as it expands and who see exciting 
future employment prospects with the Group. 
Employee involvement 
The Directors are committed to employee involvement 
throughout the business. Employees are kept well informed 
of the performance and strategy of the Group through 
divisional and personal briefings, regular meetings, electronic 
correspondence, broadcasts and in-house presentations by 
the Chief Executive, members of the Board and other 
members of the executive management team(s) organised at 
key points in the year. 
Managing executives from each operating unit across the 
Group are committed to encourage staff to engage 
proactively in gathering ideas and initiatives on a number of 
areas including how we can better serve our clients and 
operate more efficiently.
Share options are an important part of our reward package, 
encouraging and supporting employees share ownership. Full 
details of the current schemes are given in note 22. 
The Group committed to all employees related areas of 
wellbeing from healthy eating to exercise to help overcoming 
issues such as stress, financial challenges, achieving a 
positive work-life balance and problems with sleeping. 
Wellbeing information is provided by the administration team 
of every Group’s office in specific staff-dedicated ‘break out’ 
areas or kitchens. The Group also welcomes staff wellbeing 
initiatives and encourages a number of sport activities to take 
place during the lunch hours in the office premises such as 
yoga and Pilates classes and intercompany five-a-side 
football and cricket as outdoor activities. 
The Group believes that regular ‘team building’ events are 
important activities for employee’s overall satisfaction and 
wellbeing as well as for overall corporate development. Team 
building events create a friendly working atmosphere as well 
as empower individuals to contribute to common goals, 
improve ‘working in the team’ skills and communication. 
Each business unit is responsible for organising ‘team 
building events’ whereby employees are able to interact with 
one another outside the office environment. 
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
47 Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to an equal opportunities policy 
from recruitment and selection, through training and 
development, performance reviews and promotion to 
retirement. It is the Group’s policy to promote an 
environment free from discrimination, harassment and 
victimisation, where everyone will receive equal treatment 
regardless of gender, colour, ethnic or national origin, 
disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation or religion. 
All decisions relating to employment practices are objective, 
free from bias and based solely upon work criteria and 
individual merits. The Group is responsive to the needs of its 
employees, customers and the community at large. We are 
an organisation that uses everyone’s talents and abilities and 
where diversity is valued. 
Employees with disabilities
It is our policy that people with disabilities should have full 
and fair consideration for all vacancies. During the year we 
continued to demonstrate our commitment to interviewing 
those people with disabilities who fulfil the minimum criteria, 
and we endeavour to retain employees in the workforce if 
they become disabled during their employment. We will 
actively retrain and adjust their environment where possible 
to allow them to maximise their potential.

Directors’ Report (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
48 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic 
Report, Director’s Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations and 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and of the Company and profit or loss of the Group 
for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
● ● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
● ● make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
● ● state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
● ● prepare the financial statements on a going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to assume the Group 
and Company will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the 
above requirements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
For the year ended 31 December 2014
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
49 Compliance
The Directors recognise the value of the Principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (previously the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance). Although, as an AIM 
company, compliance with the Code is not required, the 
Group has regard to these principals when practicable and 
appropriate for a Group of its size.
The following statement describes how the Group as at 
31 December 2014 sought to address the principles 
underlying the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Board composition and responsibility
The Board consists of two Executive Directors and three  
Non-Executive Directors. All Directors are equally accountable 
for the proper stewardship of the Group’s affairs.
The Board’s primary objective is to focus on adding value to 
the assets of the Group by assessing business opportunities 
and ensuring that potential risks are identified, monitored 
and controlled. Matters reserved for Board decisions include 
strategic long-term objectives and capital structure of major 
transactions. The implementation of Board decisions and 
day-to-day operations of the Group are delegated to 
management. In making commercial assessments the 
Directors review detailed plans including financial viability 
reports that, among other things, detail the impact of 
proposals in respect of return on capital, return on cash and 
the likely impact on the statement of comprehensive 
income, cash flows and gearing. Strategy is determined 
after having taken due regard of forecast domestic and 
international developments.
The Board is responsible to the shareholders of the 
Company for the strategy and future development of the 
Group and the management of its resources. It has a formal 
schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision; 
other decisions are dealt with as day-to-day matters by 
management. In broad terms, the ongoing remit of the 
Board is as follows:
● ● Approval of the Group’s annual budgets and forecasts 
and ongoing review of Group strategy and 
performance;
● ● Approval of the Annual Report and any statements 
made therein;
● ● Approval of any significant changes in accounting 
policies and practices;
● ● Appointment or removal of Directors or the Company 
Secretary;
● ● Approval of appointment of senior staff and setting of 
their remuneration;
● ● Approval of any material expenditure or capital 
commitments;
● ● Ensure maintenance of robust systems of internal 
control – including all operating and financial systems 
through annual review and assessment;
● ● Review of the Board’s own effectiveness; and
● ● Ensure continued compliance with any regulatory 
requirements.
The Non-Executive Directors have particular responsibility to 
scrutinise and assess the strategy proposed by the 
executive management, to evaluate performance, business 
risk and the integrity of financial information and controls, 
and to ensure appropriate remuneration and succession 
arrangements are put in place for the Executive Directors. 
Brian Blasdale and Raymond McReeve are considered to 
be independent Non-Executive Directors for the purpose of 
the Code.
Policy on election
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the 
first Annual General Meeting after their appointment, and are 
subject to re-election at least every three years thereafter. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a specific term 
of office which provides for their removal in certain 
circumstances, including under Section 168 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The Board does not automatically re-nominate Non-
Executive Directors for election by shareholders. The terms 
of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors can be 
obtained by request to the Company Secretary.
Board meetings
The Board meets at the end of every month. Group and 
divisional budgets and quarterly financial forecasts including 
net assets and cash flow projections are formally reviewed by 
the Board on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Executive 
Directors monitor cash flows on a weekly basis. The Board 
meets normally at least twelve times during the year and 
holds other ad hoc meetings as required. The usual monthly 
agenda for the Board meeting typically contains (but is not 
limited to) the below items:
● ● Review of the minutes to the previous meeting; 
● ● Review actions from the previous meetings;
● ● Review progress against agreed Board objectives;

of each division;
● ● Review reports from senior executives and the Group 
General Counsel on key aspects of the business 
including current trading, strategy, acquisitions and 
disposals, financial results, health and safety, 
governance and HR; and
● ● Review monthly actual performance against target KPIs. 
Twelve Board meetings were held in 2014. The Directors’ attendance record during the year is:

Board effectiveness
There were no changes to the Board during 2014. As it 
stands, the Board and its Committees have an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
of the Company which enable them to discharge their 
respective duties and responsibilities effectively. Each Director 
brings a complementary set of skills and diversity to the 
Board, having served in companies of varying size, 
complexity and market sector. Each of the Non-Executive 
Directors brings independent character and judgement to 
bear on strategic matters, the performance of the Group, the 
adequacy of the resources and standards of conduct. When 
combined, these skills give the Board the comprehensive skill 
set required to deliver strategic objectives of the Group and 
to ensure its continued success. 
All Directors are able to take independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense in furtherance of their duties. 
During 2014, no Director felt the need to take such advice. 
On a monthly basis and in advance of the Board Meeting, 
each Director receives the Board report and other relevant 
papers for consideration and their review giving all Board 
members time to read, prepare and, where appropriate, ask 
questions prior to the meeting about the information 
supplied. The information includes detailed budgets and 
reports of the performance on a divisional level, a review of 
the Group financial position including an updated cash 
forecast and operating performance and monthly reports 
from the heads of operational divisions. 
All meetings of the Board and its Committees are 
documented by the Group General Counsel or the Company 
Secretary. The minutes are then circulated to all Directors for 
approval at the next meeting. 
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
51 The Board has the power at any time and from time to time 
to invite external advisers to the Board meetings where such 
invitation is deemed appropriate and necessary. During 
2014, an experienced external financial adviser, Richard 
Feigen, was invited by the Board to attend 11 out of 12 
Board meetings held. He was also invited and attended 2 
out of 2 of the general meetings held during the year. 
For the time being, the Board itself considers its 
effectiveness, and that of its committees and Directors, on 
an ongoing basis. It considers this appropriate to a 
company of this size.
Audit and Corporate Governance Committee
The Audit and Corporate Governance Committee comprises 
two Non-Executive Directors, Brian Blasdale (Chairman) and 
Raymond McKeeve. The external auditors as well as the 
Chairman of the main Board, Group Chief Executive, Group 
Financial Director and Financial Controller could also be 
invited to attend these meetings as and when required.
The principal duties of the Committee are to review the 
half-yearly and annual financial statements before their 
submission to the Board and to consider any matters 
raised by the auditors. The Committee also reviews the 
independence and objectivity of the auditors. The Committee 
also reviews compliance with best practices for corporate 
governance. The terms of reference of the Committee reflect 
current best practice, including authority to:
● ● recommend the appointment, re-appointment and 
removal of the external auditor;
● ● ensure the objectivity and independence of the auditors 
including occasions when non-audit services are 
provided; and
● ● ensure appropriate ‘whistle-blowing’ arrangements are 
in place.
During 2014, two Audit Committee meetings were held with 
the following attendances:
● ● Brian Blasdale 2/2
● ● Bob Morton 2/2
● ● Gene Golembiewski 2/2
● ● Raymond McKeeve 0/2
● ● Group Financial Controller 2/2 
The Audit and Corporate Governance Committee may seek 
information from any employee of the Group and obtain 
external professional advice at the expense of the Company 
if considered necessary. Due to the relatively low number of 
personnel employed within the Group, the nature of the 
business and the current control and review systems in 
place, the Board has decided not to establish a separate 
internal audit department.
Remuneration and Nomination Committee
The Company has established a formal and transparent 
procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration 
and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual 
directors. No Director is involved in deciding his own 
remuneration. The Remuneration and Nomination 
Committee comprises Brian Blasdale (Chairman) and 
Raymond McKeeve. The Committee considers the 
employment and performance of individual Executive 
Directors and determines their terms of service and 
remuneration. The Committee meets at least once a year. 
The Committee also evaluates the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board and considers all 
new Board appointments and re-appointments against this 
evaluation.
During 2014, one Remuneration Committee was held with 
the following attendance:
● ● Brian Blasdale 1/1
● ● Bob Morton 1/1
● ● Raymond McKeeve 0/1
Principal risks and uncertainties including 
financial risk management 
The principal risks identified by the Directors that may affect 
the Group as well as financial risk management is disclosed 
on pages 36 to 40 of the Strategic Review. 
Internal control and risk
The Directors are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining the Group’s system of internal control and 
reviewing its effectiveness. By its nature, such a system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Group continually reviews its internal controls and 
procedures and corrective actions taken to mitigate risks are 
identified and implemented where deemed necessary.
Shareholder communication
The Board encourages regular dialogue with the Group’s 
shareholders and has a policy of making itself available to 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to which all 
shareholders are invited to attend. During 2014, this has

Additionally, the Board usually receives shareholder 
feedback reports prepared by the Nominated Adviser 
following pre-arranged meetings with institutional fund 
managers and analysts.
Corporate social responsibility

processes minimise harm to the environment and 
contributes as far as is practicable to the local community 
and the Board takes a responsible and positive approach 
to employment practices.

53 Report of the Remuneration Committee
For the year ended 31 December 2014
Dear shareholder
2014 was a busy year for the Committee with the approval 
of new salary and benefits arrangements for Executive 
Directors effective from 1 January 2014 and with the design 
and introduction of the new Annual Bonus Scheme effective 
from 1 January 2015. 
‘Pay for performance’ and ‘no reward for failure’ continue to 
be key principles. At the same time, pay and benefits must 
be at a level that will attract, retain and motivate high-calibre 
people with the skills necessary to achieve our goal of 
sustained growth and financial performance. 
We operate in a global market, with a substantial part of our 
fees being generated from companies located outside the 
UK employing 20% of our staff. The Group’s continuing 
strong performance is due principally to the proven abilities 
of our executive teams. 
This Remuneration Report is presented across the following 
sections:
● ● Summary of the Remuneration Committee work 
during 2014;
● ● Remuneration Policy Report; and 
● ● Annual Remuneration Report sets out remuneration 
paid to Directors in 2014 including annual bonuses as 
well as details of how we intend to implement our new 
Remuneration Policy for 2015.
Committee activities 
During 2014, the Committee considered a range of 
issues including:
● ● Executive Directors’ salary increases with effect from 
1 January 2014, reflecting the pay increases within the 
Group’s workforce and current market conditions;
● ● New Bonus scheme for Executive Directors has 
been approved with effect from 1 January 2015. No 
bonus payments to Executive Directors were made in 
2014; and
● ● The structure of the 2015 Annual Bonus Plan has been 
designed to incentivise Executive Directors to deliver 
against challenging targets in 2015. This structure is a 
combination of both financial targets: Group’s profit 
before tax and reported EBITDA.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
Remuneration packages are developed to attract, retain and 
motivate Executive Directors without being excessive, and 
to be aligned with both the interests of shareholders and the 
business strategy of the Company. They take into account 
the current life cycle stage of the Company, the level of 
responsibilities and risks involved and the remuneration 
packages of comparable companies that have similar 
international scale. Consideration of remuneration and 
benefits across the Group’s employee population is also 
taken into account.
The current remuneration of the Executives consists of 
several elements including base salary, pension contribution, 
share options, and other taxable benefits. The remuneration 
policy table below summarises each element of the current 
remuneration for Executive Directors including an 
explanation of the link to strategy, its operation, maximum 
opportunity and performance measures. 
Brian Blasdale 
Chairman of the 
Remuneration 
Committee
The Committee’s overall objective in line with the Group’s 
long-standing commitments to ethical values and culture is 
to set a remuneration policy that is clearly understood by 
our shareholders and employees, and that drives the right 
behaviours in terms of incentivising Executive Directors to 
deliver growth in long-term shareholder value.
The role and composition of the Remuneration Committee is set out on page 52.

Base salary Base salary is set at 
the level to secure the 
services of talented 
Executive Directors 
with the ability to 
develop and deliver  
a growth strategy.
Fixed contractual cash 
amount usually paid 
monthly in arrears. 
Normally reviewed 
annually, with any 
increases taking effect 
from 1 January each 
year, although the 
Committee may award 
increases at other 
times of the year if it 
considers appropriate. 
This review is 
dependent on 
continued satisfactory 
performance in the 
role of an Executive 
Director. It also 
includes a number of 
other factors, including 
experience, 
development and 
delivery of Group 
strategy and Group 
profitability, as well as 
external market 
conditions and pay 
awards across the 
Group. 
Whilst there is no set 
maximum level of 
salary, the Committee 
will usually award 
salary increases in line 
with average increases 
awarded across the 
Group. Larger 
increases may, in 
certain circumstances, 
be awarded where the 
Committee considers 
that there is a genuine 
commercial reason to 
do so, for example:
–  Due to a significant 
increase in the 
Executive Director’s 
role and duties; or
–  As a result of a 
significant change in 
profitability of the 
Company.
Not applicable
Benefits To provide Executive 
Directors with benefits 
to assist them in 
carrying out their 
duties effectively.
Executive Directors 
are entitled to a 
range of benefits 
including car and 
accommodation 
allowances, private 
health insurance and 
life assurance.
The maximum level of 
such benefits is not 
defined by the 
Committee as the cost 
may significantly vary 
depending on 
individual factors and 
circumstances 
relevant to each 
Director. The types 
and level of benefits 
granted are therefore 
thoroughly considered 
based on individual 
circumstances.

68 Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2014
1. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated. The Group’s accounting policies have 
been extended in order to reflect the new businesses commenced or acquired during the year. The adoption of the 
additional policies has no impact on the results, assets or liabilities of the Group for the prior year. 
The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the Company’s functional currency.
(a) Basis of preparation of the financial statements
The Consolidated and Company financial statements of Porta Communications PLC have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC 
Interpretations and the parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to Companies reporting under IFRS.
The Consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for 
financial instruments, contingent consideration that have been measured at fair value.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations 
issued and effective or issued and early adopted as at the time of preparing these statements.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. 
It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
consolidated and parent company financial statements are disclosed under accounting policy (z).
New standards, interpretations and amendments became effective as of 1 January 2014 adopted by 
the Group:
● ● IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements builds on existing principals by identifying concept of control as the 
determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidation financial statement of the parent 
company. 
● ● IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (2011) the amendments to this standard are consequential on the issue of IFRS 10 
which replaces IAS 27 in part. 
● ● IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities brings together a single standard for the disclosure requirements about 
an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities. 
None of the above listed standards that have been adopted during this year affected the amounts reported in the financial 
statements. Other standards, amendments and interpretation which are effective for the financial year beginning on 
1 January 2014 are not material to the Group. 
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and 
have not been adopted early by the Group
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 
1 January 2014, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. Those which are/may be 
relevant to the Group and expected to have significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group are set 
out below. 
● ● IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. 
The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted 
subject to EU endorsement. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact. 
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
69 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
● ● IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting 
useful information to users of financial statements. The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction 
contracts and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 
and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15.
● ● IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisition of interests in Joint Operations – Amendments to IFRS 11 deals with the acquisition 
of an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a ‘business’ and requires to apply principles of accounting in IFRS 3 
Business Combinations and other relevant standards that do not conflict with IFRS 11. The amendment must be applied 
prospectively and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. Early adoption is permitted 
subject to EU endorsement.
● ● IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements – Amendments to IAS 27 removes the equity method as an 
option to account for investments in subsidiaries and associates in an entity’s separate financial statements. The 
amendment must be applied retrospectively and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2016. Early adoption is permitted subject to EU endorsement.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact 
on the Group. 
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Statement of Financial Position include the financial statements 
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2014 and present comparative information for the 
year ended 31 December 2013. One subsidiary, as shown in note 17, has a year-end which is not coterminous with that of 
the Company as a result of acquisition during the year. In this case, the results, assets and liabilities for those companies 
have been included up to 31 December 2014.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or 
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
The Group’s subsidiaries include Limited Liability Partnerships where the Group does not hold 100% of the partnership 
interests. In such instances, the classification of non-group interests between non-controlling interests and liabilities is 
determined based on an assessment of the member’s rights and obligations under the relevant partnership agreement.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (‘OCI’) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of 
the Group and to non-controlling interests, even if this results in non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with 
the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. 
A change in ownership interest of a subsidiary without a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the 
Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
● ● derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary
● ● derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests
● ● derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity 
● ● recognises the fair value of the consideration received 
● ● recognises the fair value of any investment retained
● ● recognises any surplus or deficit in the Statement of Comprehensive Income
● ● reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings, as 
appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.

70 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when 
control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for 
the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, 
any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group 
had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may require that the amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income be reclassified to profit or loss. 
(c) Going concern
The current economic conditions continue to create uncertainty particularly for (a) the level of demand for the Group’s 
services; and (b) the availability of bank finance for the foreseeable future. The Group’s forecast and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the 
level of its current finance facilities. However, the Directors have sought and received assurance from the Group’s major 
lenders that they will continue to provide financial support beyond the expiry of the existing loan facilities sufficient to enable 
the Board to conclude that the Group and the Company are going concerns. 
Therefore, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for foreseeable future. Therefore the Company and the Group continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
(d) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and the amount of any non-
controlling interest in the acquired entity. Non-controlling interests may be initially measured either at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice 
of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in 
administrative expenses except where they relate to the issue of debt or equity instruments in connection with the acquisition. 
When the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition 
date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. It is then considered in determination of goodwill. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised either in profit or 
loss or as a change to OCI. When contingent consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance 
with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured and subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity. 
When the Group enters into options and forward contracts over shares relating to non-controlling interests (‘NCI’) at the 
same time as the business combination, the NCI is recognised to the extent the risk and rewards of ownership of those 
shares remain with them. Irrespective of whether the NCI is recognised, a financial liability (redemption liability) is recorded to 
reflect the forward or put option. All subsequent changes to the liability are recognised in profit or loss. Where the risks and 
rewards of ownership remain with the NCIs, the recognised financial liability is a reduction in the controlling interest equity. 
The non-controlling interest is then recognised and is allocated its share of profits and losses accordingly. Where significant 
risks and rewards of ownership reside with the NCIs, the difference between the financial liability and the NCI balance is 
debited to controlling interest equity if the liability is greater than the carrying value of the NCI, otherwise the difference is 
attributed to NCI. Dividends paid to the NCIs that do not reduce the contracted purchase price are deducted from the 
non-controlling interest carrying value. Profits and losses are allocated to NCI to the extent it is necessary to cover the 
dividend payment so that NCI does not become negative. In those situations when forward or put options state that dividend 
payments reduce the contracted future purchase price, then the dividend amount is deducted from the redemption liability. 
Transactions with NCIs that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, as 
transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the 
relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains and losses on 
disposal to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(e) Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identified as the steering committee that makes strategic decisions. 
(f) Foreign currency translation
Amounts included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the Company’s functional and presentation currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of 
the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of such transactions, and from the translation 
at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow and net investment hedges.
The results and financial position of all Group companies that have a functional currency other than sterling are translated as 
follows:
● ● income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation 
of the cumulative effect of the rate prevailing on the transaction date, in which case income and expenses are translated 
at the date of the transaction);
● ● assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at Statement of Financial Position date; and
● ● all resulting exchange differences are recognised as other comprehensive income which is a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and from 
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity. When a foreign 
operation is sold such exchange differences are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as part of the gain 
or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of 
the foreign entity and translated at the closing exchange rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised as recognised in 
other comprehensive income. 
(g) Revenue and revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue represents the fees and commissions, net of discounts, derived from services provided to and 
invoiced to clients.
Revenue is recognised in the period in which the service is performed, in accordance with contractual arrangements. Income 
billed in advance of the performance of service is deferred and income in respect of work carried out but not billed at period 
end is accrued. In these cases, revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion which is measured by 
reference to labour hours incurred to the period end as a percentage of the total estimated labour hours for the contract. 
Where the contract outcome cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognised to the extent of the expenses recognised 
that are recoverable.
(h) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and provision for any impairment. Depreciation is calculated 
to write down the cost of all tangible fixed assets to estimated residual value over their expected useful lives as follows:
Office improvements 5 years, straight line (or length of lease, if shorter) 
Office equipment 5 years, straight line
Furniture, fixtures and fittings 5 years, straight line
IT equipment 3 years, straight line
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
72 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each Statement of Financial Position 
date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are 
included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
(i) Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise goodwill, certain acquired separable corporate brand names, acquired customer relationships 
and website development costs, software and other licences.
Goodwill represents the excess of fair value attributed to investments in businesses or subsidiary undertakings over the fair 
value of the underlying net assets, including intangible assets, at the date of their acquisition. Goodwill on acquisition of an 
entity is included in intangible assets. Gains and losses on disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill 
relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill has indefinite useful life and therefore not amortised. Impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the net 
present value of future cash flows derived from the underlying assets using a projection period of up to five years for each 
cash-generating unit. After the projection period a steady growth rate representing an appropriate long-term growth rate for 
the industry is applied. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
Corporate brand names and customer relationships acquired as part of acquisitions of businesses are capitalised separately 
from goodwill as intangible assets if their value can be measured reliably on initial recognition and it is probable that the 
expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group.
Expenditure on website development, software and licences is initially stated at cost.
Amortisation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset, other than 
goodwill, on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset. Estimated life and estimated residual value is calculated 
on an asset by asset basis having regard to the nature of the asset, and the cash flows generated, or to be generated, by 
the asset historically and projected.
Amortisation is calculated to write down the cost of these assets to their estimated residual value over their expected useful 
lives as follows:
Brands 10 years, straight line
Customer relationships 5 years, straight line
Websites, software and licences 3 years, straight line
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement of financial position 
date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are 
included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
(j) Impairment of assets
Non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying value 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in 
use. Value in use is based on the present value of the future cash flows relating to the asset, and is determined over periods 
which are deemed to appropriately reflect the minimum expected period that the cash generating unit will operate for. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash 
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
73 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
flows (cash generating units). Any impairment loss is immediately recognised as an expense in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
(k) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified 
as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The criteria for held for 
sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Discontinued operation may include abandoned or closed operations which will not meet the held for sale criteria as they are 
not recovered principally through sale and therefore balance sheet presentation requirements will not be applicable to them. 
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as 
profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale.
(l) Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Investments in associate entities over which Group has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not 
control and/or joint control over those policies. 
Under the equity method, the investment, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount 
of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture since 
the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount go the investment and is neither 
amortised nor individually tested for impairment. 
The Statement of Comprehensive Income reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change 
in the OCI of those investments is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss 
of an associate is shown on the face of the Statement of Comprehensive Income outside operating profit and represents 
profit or loss after tax and non-controlling interest in the subsidiaries of the associates.
At each reporting date, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss of its investment in its 
associates through examination of any objective evidence. The Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference 
between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, then recognises the loss as ‘share of profit of an 
associate’ in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained investments at its fair 
value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the 
retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss. 
(m) Available for sale investments (‘AFS’)
AFS financial investments include equity instruments and debt securities. Equity instruments classified as AFS are those that 
are neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss.
After initial measurement, AFS financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses 
recognised in OCI and credited in the AFS reserve until the investment is derecognised, at which time the cumulative gain 
and loss is recognised in other operating income, or the investment is determined to be impaired, when the cumulative loss 
is reclassified from the AFS reserve to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in finance costs. 
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
74 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
The Group evaluates whether the ability and intention to sell its AFS financial assets in the near term is still appropriate. 
When, in rare circumstances, the partnership is unable to trade these financial assets due to inactive markets, the 
partnership may elect to reclassify these financial assets if member have the ability and intention to hold the assets for 
foreseeable future or until maturity. 
For the financial assets reclassified from the AFS category, the fair value carrying amount at the date of reclassification 
becomes its new amortised cost and any previous gain or loss on the asset that has been recognised in equity is amortised 
to profit or loss over the remaining life of the investment using the effective interest rate (‘EIR’). Any difference between the 
new amortised cost and the maturity amount is also amortised over the remaining life of the asset using EIR. If the asset is 
subsequently determined to be impaired, then the amount recorded in equity is reclassified to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. 
(n) Work in progress
Work in progress is valued at cost, which includes outlays incurred on behalf of clients and an appropriate proportion of 
directly attributable costs and overheads on incomplete assignments. Provision is made for irrecoverable costs where it is 
probable that such costs will not be recovered from future billing. 
(o) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. 
The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows. The amount of the provision is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
(p) Cash and cash equivalents
In consolidated statement of cash flow, cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, 
other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. In the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities. 
(q) Share capital and share premium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Share premium represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of 
the Ordinary shares less costs of the shares issued and is classified as equity.
(r) Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business 
from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal 
operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. 
(s) Borrowings and compound instruments 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transactions costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at 
amortised cost; any differences between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs. In cases where these costs are settled 
at the time of the borrowing maturity and was added to the principal subject to an additional interest charge, this fee is 
capitalised as prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. 
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
75 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
Borrowings issued to the Group that can be converted into share capital at the option of the issuer, and where the number of 
shares to be issued does not vary with changes in their fair value, are classified by the Group as compound financial 
instruments. The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar 
liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognised initially at the difference between 
the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly 
attributable transaction costs are allocated to liability and equity component in proportion to the initial carrying amounts. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured 
subsequent to initial recognition except on conversion or expiry. 
(t) Taxation including deferred taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement except where 
it relates to items taken directly to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or Equity. Tax on Company profits 
is provided for at the current rate applicable in each of the relevant territories. Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability 
method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit 
or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the Group believes it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which temporary timing differences and losses from previous periods can be utilised. The Group’s 
assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on a two year forecast of the future profitability of the Group. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of 
financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised.
(u) Share based payments
The Group makes equity-settled payments to its employees. Equity-settled share based awards are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant using an options pricing methodology and expensed over the vesting period of the award. At each 
Statement of Financial Position date the Group reviews its estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest.
Shares issued to vendors in respect of the acquisition of interests in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for in accordance 
with accounting policy (d) above.
Equity-settled share based payments may also be made in settlement of professional costs in relation to costs incurred in 
the issue of new shares and in acquisition of subsidiary companies. In these cases, the payments are measured at fair value 
of services provided which will normally equate to the invoiced fees where those services are provided at arms’ length in the 
normal course of trade. In the case of payments made for the issue of new shares, the fair value is charged against the share 
premium account or other reserves; charges in respect of other professional fees are expensed within the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the year.
(v) Leasing commitments
Group as a lessee
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals payable under operating leases (net of any incentives received) are charged as finance costs to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Leases where significant risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item have been transferred to the Group are 
classified as finance lease. Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased 
assets or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance 
charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
76 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainly that the Group will 
obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorted of estimated useful life of the asset 
and the lease term.
(w) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If 
the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
(x) Finance costs
Finance costs, include interest, bank charges and the unwinding of the discount on deferred consideration, are recognised in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they are incurred using the effective interest rate method.
(y) Pensions and similar obligations
The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or 
voluntary basis in respect of defined contribution plans. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions 
have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions 
are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Payments to defined contribution pension plan were charged as an expense to the Statement of Comprehensive Income, as 
incurred, when the related employee service is rendered. The Group has no further legal or constructive payment obligations 
once the contributions have been made. 
(z) Critical accounting estimates and judgments
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group makes estimates and 
assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will by definition, seldom equal the related actual 
results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
l Business Combinations
The Group has recognised customer relationships and brands relating to acquisitions it has made (see note 10). The 
determination of estimated fair values of acquired intangible assets, as well as the expected useful life ascribed, requires the 
use of significant judgment. The Group has used the discounted cash flows and relief-from-royalty models in order to 
determine the fair value of acquired intangible assets.
Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions is recognised at fair value. This is determined based on management 
estimates of the most likely outcome, discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate based on market 
inputs and management judgment.
l Discontinued operations 
The Group has concluded that the closure of the media and creative agencies in Tunbridge Wells, the Twenty20 Media group 
constitutes a disposal group and discontinued operations under IFRS 5 and has accounted for it accordingly. The Group 
eliminates intercompany transactions at the discontinued operational level.
l Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The carrying value of goodwill and brands are subject to an impairment review both annually and when there are indications 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable, in accordance with policies (i) and (j) stated above. The recoverable amounts 
of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of estimates.
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
77 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
l Recoverability of investments and debts due from subsidiaries and related parties
Whether the carrying value of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries, balances due from those subsidiaries and balances due 
from related parties is recoverable or impaired requires judgments and estimates relating to the prospects of those subsidiaries. 
The Directors assess the recoverability of these balances at each year end. Particularly in the case of start-up businesses, such 
judgments and estimates are subject to the uncertainty inherent in projections of expected future growth in revenue.
l Control in another entity with less than half of the voting rights
The Directors concluded that the Group’s 45% interest ownership of Newgate Communications Singapore Pte. Ltd 
(note 10.2) is a controlling interest and therefore the results of the acquired businesses since acquisition has been included 
in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. In making this judgement the Directors assessed the Group’s power over 
the investee; its exposure and rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and its ability to use the 
power over the investee to affect the amount of investor’s return. 
2. Segmental reporting
Business segments
The Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. The strategic divisions 
offer different products and services and are managed separately because they require different resources and strategies. For 
each of the strategic divisions, the Group’s CEO (the chief operating decision maker) reviews internal management reports on a 
monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments.
● ● Corporate Communications includes public relations, public affairs and other corporate communication services.
● ● Marketing & Advertising includes media buying, creative advertising, marketing and corporate branding services.
● ● Head office includes services provided by the Group’s corporate function, including group treasury and finance and 
management services.
The Board considers the Group to have three reportable segments. Information regarding the results of each reportable 
segment is included below. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting 
policies, which are described in note 1.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. Segment result represents operating profit, which is the 
measure reported to the chief operating decision maker. All assets and liabilities are allocated to reportable segments with 
the exception of tax and other centrally managed balances. Goodwill is allocated to segments as described in note 15.

Contingent consideration 20 (981,379) (636,029)
  (14,907,251) (16,160,035)
The management have assessed that the fair value of cash and short term deposits, trade receivable, trade payable and 
bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate to their carrying amounts as those items have short term maturities.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a 
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The following methods and assumptions 
were used to estimate the fair values:
● ● Long-term fixed rate and variable-rate receivables/borrowings are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such 
as interest rates, specific country risk factors and the individual creditworthiness of the counterparty. Based on this 
evaluation, allowances are taken into account for the expected losses of these receivables. As at 31 December 2014, 
the carrying amounts of such receivables, net of allowances, were not materially different from their calculated fair 
values. 
● ● Fair value of the quoted instruments is based on price quotation at the reporting date. During 2013, as a settlement of 
the trade receivable balance, the Group received 2,500,000 Ordinary shares of 0.01p quoted on London Stock 
Exchange with the fair value of £1,000. The value of quoted shares at 31 December 2014 is not materially different from 
original cost and hence no OCI movement arises.

86 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks and those activities involve the analysis, evaluation, acceptance 
and management of some degree of risk or combination of risks. Taking risk is core to the financial business, and the 
operational risks are an inevitable consequence of being in business. The Group’s aim is therefore to achieve an appropriate 
balance between risk and return and minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
The Group’s risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse these risks, to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls, and to monitor the risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems. The 
Group regularly reviews its risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in markets, products and emerging 
best practice.
Risk management is carried out by the Board of Directors. The Board is responsible for the identification of the major 
business risks faced by the Company and for determining the appropriate courses of action to manage those risks. The 
most important types of risk are credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risk. Market risk includes currency risk, interest rate and 
other price risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligation, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. Customers who wish to trade on 
credit terms are generally subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an 
ongoing basis.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. At 31 December 
2014, no individual customer accounted for more than 3% of the total outstanding trade receivable balance. At 
31 December 2013, there were two most significant debtors, a UK technology firm and UK retailer, account for £1,207,759 
(21%) and £651,707 (11%) respectively, of the trade and other receivables balance at that date. 
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. In addition, a large 
number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed collectively. The calculation is based on 
actual incurred historical data. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection 
history. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets 
disclosed above. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when 
they fall due.
The Group financed its operations during the year from reserves (see Statement of Changes in Shareholder Equity), from 
additional equity raised (see note 21), and from new loan and convertible loan facilities (see note 23). Operating companies’ 
cash requirements are monitored on a rolling working capital forecast basis and funded, where necessary, from Group funds. 
Market risk
(a) Currency exchange risk
The Group’s subsidiaries operate in Belgium, Germany, Australia and Singapore and revenues and expenses are 
denominated in Euro (EUR), Australian Dollar (AUD) and Singapore Dollar (SGD). The Group’s Sterling (GBP) Statement of 
Financial Position is not protected from movements in the exchange rate between these currencies and Sterling. The overall 
exposure to foreign currency risk is considered by management to be low. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible change in EUR, AUD and SGD to GBP exchange 
rates, with all other variables held constant. The impact on the Group profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of 
monetary assets and liabilities. The Group exposure to possible changes in all other foreign exchange currencies is not 
deemed material.

Fixed rate interest bearing loans and borrowings excluding finance leases are subject to interest at between 6% and 12% 
per annum (2013: 12% per annum). Further details of loans are given in note 23 and further details of finance lease 
arrangements in note 24. 
Sensitivity Analysis
At 31 December 2014, the continuing businesses of the Group were not exposed to any variable rate borrowings. In 2013 
the loss for the year would have increased or decreased by up to £6,500 if the Bank of England Official Bank Rate had 
moved by 100 basis points during the period. The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, therefore a change in interest rates at the end of the period would not affect profit or loss or equity.

8. Capital risk management
The capital structure of the Group comprises the equity attributable to equity holders of the parent company, comprising 
issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings. Quantitative data on these are set out in the Consolidated and 
Company Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order 
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce 
the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of the gearing ratio. The ratio is 
calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current 
borrowings as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position) less cash and cash equivalents. Total equity is 
calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.

Gearing ratio 27% 33%
The decrease in the gearing ratio during 2014 resulted primarily from the issue of share capital and from consideration for the 
acquisitions as detailed in note 10. 
9. Discontinued operations
On 1 December 2014 the Board committed to a plan to discontinue the trading of Twenty20 Media group (‘TTMG’), which 
was 90% owned by the Group. At 31 December 2014, TTMG, historically representing the major part of the media and 
advertising operating segment within the Porta Group, was classified as a disposal group and discontinued operations and 
therefore is excluded from the analysis of continuing operations in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and related notes.

10. Acquisition of subsidiaries and non-controlling interests
10.1  Acquisition of WSM Digital Communications Limited and WSM Print Management and Creative 
Services Limited 
On 28 March 2014, the Group announced the acquisition of the entire issue share capital of two businesses from WSM 
Communications Group Limited – WSM Digital Communications Limited (‘WSM Digital’) and WSM Print Management and 
Creative Services Limited (‘WSM Print’). The deal was financed by the issue of 7,500,000 Ordinary shares of 10p each in 
Porta at a price of 14.075p per share (the ‘Consideration Shares’), with 5,723,802 of the Consideration Shares subject to a 
12 month lock-in agreement and a further 12 month orderly market agreement. The remainder of the Consideration Shares 
were subject to a three month orderly market agreement. 
The two businesses acquired incorporated a digital team of 12 specialists and seven print management and design 
specialists, providing between them full studio design and art-working capabilities and a full digital design and production 
unit, servicing a range of blue-chip clients. The business units generated approximately £1.3 million of fee income and a 
small profit in aggregate in the 11 month period to February 2014.
The former shareholders of these acquired businesses were not the same individuals. The two businesses were acquired for 
individually defined purchase consideration in accordance with the Share Purchase Agreement (‘SPA’) and both businesses 
had a clearly distinguished set of integrated activities and assets that were/are capable of being conducted and managed 
individually and separately from each other for the purpose of providing economic benefits to the owners. Initially the Group 
had intended to purchase only the profit making WSM Print business however given an exceptionally favourable asking price 
for the WSM Digital business, the Board  decided to proceed with the purchase of both businesses. On this basis for the 
acquisition accounting purposes as well as for monthly internal reporting purposes the management team of Porta Group 
views both acquired businesses as two separate business acquisitions in the Group’s marketing and advertising segment. 
Transaction costs of £73,732 relating to acquisition of these businesses were expensed and are included within 
administrative expenses.

100% of total comprehensive income for the period generated by each of these acquired businesses is attributed to the

If the acquisition of WSM Digital had occurred on 1 January 2014, management estimates that the Group’s consolidated 
revenue would have been approximately £78,500 higher and the loss on continuing activities before taxation would increase 
by £131,900. If the acquisition of WSM Print had occurred on 1 January 2014, management estimates that the Group’s 
consolidated revenue would have been approximately £186,400 higher and the loss on continuing activities before taxation 
would decrease by approximately £14,300. 
In determining these amounts, it has been assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition 
would have been the same had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2014.

10.2 Acquisition of Newgate Communications (Singapore) Pte. Ltd
Newgate Communications (Singapore) Pte. Ltd (‘Newgate Singapore’) is a start-up PR consultancy firm specialising in 
corporate communications, financial communications and public affairs which has been operating under the ‘Newgate’ 
brand from the commencement of its trading activity in June 2013. 
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
93 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
During 2013, the Group provided Newgate Singapore with a convertible loan facility of £531,066 for general working capital 
purposes. The loan facility is convertible into a maximum of 51% of the issued share capital of Newgate Singapore at the 
provider’s discretion or repayable on demand.
On 1 March 2014, the Group acquired 45% ownership in Newgate Singapore through conversion of 88% of the outstanding 
loan. In view of the likelihood the Group will exercise its conversion rights over the remaining 12% of the loan, the Directors 
are of the opinion that the Group now exercises effective control over Newgate Singapore and accordingly its results have 
been consolidated within the Porta Communications group since the date of acquisition on 1 March 2014. 
Fair value of net assets acquired was deemed to be equal to their book value. The following table summarises the 
recognised amounts of assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.

10.3 Acquisition of Redleaf Polhill Limited 
On 23 April 2014, the Group announced the acquisition of 51% of the issued share capital of Redleaf Polhill Limited 
(‘Redleaf’), a leading full service communications agency, from its shareholders, with an option to acquire the remaining 49% 
over the following three financial years. 
Under the terms of the agreement, the total purchase consideration of £1,795,000 was satisfied by £897,500 in cash and the 
remaining balance through the issue of 6,998,050 Ordinary shares of 10p each in Porta (the ‘Consideration Shares’), of which 
1,760,010 will be issued following certain conditions under the acquisition agreement being satisfied. The Consideration 
Shares are subject to a lock-in agreement which provides for a 24 month lock-in period and a further 12 month orderly 
market period.
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
95 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
In accordance with the Share Purchase Agreement, non-controlling shareholders of Redleaf were granted put options over the 
remaining 49% of the issued share capital in Redleaf. These options are exercisable in three tranches following the end of each 
of the next three full financial years of Redleaf on similar terms to the initial acquisition. The put options were accompanied by a 
grant of call options to Porta, on the same terms, over the remaining 49% non-controlling interest in Redleaf. A purchase call 
option allows Porta to purchase the remaining 49% in accordance with the terms and conditions of the call. Any additional 
consideration payable under the put and call options is to be satisfied 50% in cash and 50% in Ordinary shares.
Transaction costs of £82,108 relating to acquisition of this business were expensed and are included within administrative costs.

10.4 Acquisition of PPS Group Limited 
On 1 October 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital, including key staff and contracts, of PPS Group (‘PPS’) 
and its wholly owned subsidiaries, which together form a leading independent consultancy specialising in reputation 
management, community engagement and political consensus building, advertising on projects such as complex property,

Total comprehensive income for the period  (599,144)
100% of total comprehensive income for the period generated by each of these acquired businesses is attributed to the 
equity shareholder. 
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2014, management estimates that the Group’s consolidated revenue would 
have been approximately £3,666,850 higher and the loss on continuing activities before taxation would have reduced by 
£497,797. 
In determining these amounts, it has been assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition 
would have been the same had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2014.

102 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
12. Investment in associate
The Group has a 25.1% interest in Team Darwin Limited, a community powered creative business, with a ‘call option’ to 
purchase up to 40% of the share capital after 1 May 2015. In accordance with IAS 28 ‘Investment in associate and joint 
ventures’ the Group’s 25.1% interest in Team Darwin is accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated financial 
statements. 
The following table summarises the financial information of the Group’s investment in Team Darwin as at year end:
 Year ended Year ended 
 31 December 2014 31 December 2013

Revenue 134,383 59,756

Loss for the period (29,030) (107,164)
Proportion of the Group ownership (25.1%) (7,287) (26,898)
Carrying value of the investment at 1 January 2014 126,722 153,620
Share of losses in associate during the year (7,287) (26,898)
Carrying value of the investment at 31 December 2014 119,435 126,722
13. Loss per share
The loss per share has been calculated using the weighted average number of shares in issue during the relevant financial year. 
The weighted number of equity shares in issue and the loss, being the loss after tax, used in these calculations are as follows:
  Year ended  Year ended Year ended 
  31 December 2014 31 December 2013 31 December 2013 
  number number number
Weighted average number of shares 
   (ordinary and dilutive)  219,820,830 139,196,362 139,196,362

Loss on continuing activities after tax  (1,257,265) (2,712,137) (2,719,001)
Loss on discontinued activities after tax  (2,480,674) (14,069) (7,205)
Loss on continuing and discontinued activities after tax  (3,737,939) (2,726,206) (2,726,206)
No share options or warrants outstanding at 31 December 2014 or 31 December 2013 were dilutive and all such potential 
Ordinary shares are therefore excluded from the weighted average number of Ordinary shares for the purposes of calculating 
diluted earnings per share. 
14. Profit accounted for in the parent company
As permitted under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the Company is 
not presented as part of these financial statements. The Company’s loss for the year, after tax, was £4,442,018 (2013: 
£1,949,113). The loss after tax in 2014 includes the impairment of investments related to discontinued operations.

*Other comprise of Cauldron Consulting Limited, 13 Communications Limited (both belong to the communication division) and 2112 Direct LLP (formerly Crazy 
Horse Integrated LLP) which belongs to the marketing division. Details relating to the acquisitions of these units were disclosed in 2013 Annual Report in note 10.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis, determined by 
discounting future cash flows to be generated from the continuing use of the cash-generating unit.
Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates, terminal value growth rates, and 
forecast EBITDA. The EBITDA forecasts are based on three year forecasts approved by the Board and based on 
management’s estimate of the business within the cash-generating unit, for two years thereafter based on an average 
growth projection, and a long-term growth rate into perpetuity. For all cash-generating units the resulting cash flows have 
been discounted using a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 14.0% (2013: 14.8%) and a terminal growth rate of 
2.5% has been applied in perpetuity. The discount rate was based on the risk-free rate obtained from UK Government Gilts, 
adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities generally and the systemic risk specific to 
the Group.
The results of the impairment testing indicated that there is no impairment for any of the continuing Group’s cash-generating 
units. The impairment in relation to the discontinued operations is disclosed in note 9.

The average credit period on sales of services is 87 days (2013: 87 days). No interest has been charged on trade receivables 
during the year. 
The Group provides for the impairment of trade receivables on a customer-by-customer basis having regarded past payment 
experience and the probability of future payment.  
During the year a charge for bad and doubtful debts of £133,167 (2013 restated: £971; 2013: £124,708) was made to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Identified individual bad or doubtful debtors are provided for in full to the extent that

they are deemed irrecoverable. In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the 
credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of 
credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no 
further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for impairment relating to doubtful debts. The Directors consider 
that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
At 31 December 2014, there were no customers who individually represented more than 5% of the trade and other 
receivables balance. In 2013, the Group’s two most significant debtors, a UK technology firm and UK retailer, accounted for 
£1,207,759 (21%) and £651,707 (11%), respectively, of the trade and other receivables balance at 31 December 2013.

on overdue trade payables at varying rates up to 9% per annum depending on the contractual terms and the legal 
requirements of the country of operation. The Company manages trade payables in accordance with customer terms and 
the cash flow requirements of the business. No interest was charged by suppliers during the year (2013: none).
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.
20. Provisions and Contingent Liabilities 
On 6 July 2012, the Group acquired a 90% interest in the share capital of Twenty20 Media Group Limited (previously called 
Twenty20 Media Vision Limited and renamed Twenty20 Media Group Limited on 30 October 2012), a full service media 
planning and buying agency based in Tunbridge Wells. In accordance with the terms of the acquisition, the Group was 
required to pay an amount of the deferred consideration up to £1,530,000 which was heavily reliant on two year earn-out 
level of profits and which was to be satisfied based on the same proportion of cash and shares as the initial consideration. 
PORTA COMMUNICATIONS PLC
113 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
For both previous reporting years ending on 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013, management estimated and 
recognised a provision of £381,198 as the most likely level of exposure. In the current reporting year, Twenty20 Media Vision 
Limited’s business significantly declined and was eventually discontinued during the year as disclosed in note 9. Prior to the 
discontinuation of the business a sum of £200,000 was paid in cash as a final settlement re-negotiated between the parties. 
The remainder has been written off to the results from discontinued operations. 
Following the acquisition of Summit Marketing Services Limited (‘Summit’) on 7 June 2013, the Group recognised provision 
for a total amount of £254,831 related to deferred consideration capped up to a maximum of £446,868 dependent on two 
year performance results. On 31 July 2014, the Group announced that it had issued a total of 1,022,352 Ordinary Shares in 
satisfaction of the first tranche of deferred consideration payable to the vendors of Summit based on the financial 
performance of Summit for the year ended 30 April 2014. The remainder of the deferred consideration payable in relation to 
the second tranche amounts to £125,045 and is subject to Summit’s performance for the year ended 30 April 2015. Further 
details are given in note 27.
On 23 April 2014, the Group has announced its acquisition of Redleaf (see note 10.3). The acquisition involves the grant of 
put and call options relating to the purchase by the Company of the remaining 49% of the issued share capital of Redleaf 
which are exercisable in three tranches following the end of each of the next three full financial years of Redleaf on similar 
terms to the initial acquisition. Any additional consideration payable under the put and call options will be satisfied 50% in 
cash and 50% in Ordinary Shares. 
Management has evaluated Redleaf’s three year forecasts for profit after tax in order to determine the liability component of 
deferred consideration and has discounted this using the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital at the time of the 
acquisition of 14.8%. At 31 December 2014, the present value of the liability component of deferred consideration is 
£856,334.

For the year ended 31 December 2014
In February 2014, the Group announced that it had raised £7.0 million (before expenses) on AIM by way of an 
oversubscribed placing of 53,846,153 new Ordinary shares at a price of 13p. The purpose of the fund raising was to 
implement the next phase of the Group’s growth by acquiring a number of public relations and advertising businesses in the 
UK. Funds were also used to acquire the remaining 20% of Newgate Threadneedle, and to repay £2.4 million of loans 
(including interest) from Retro Grand Limited.  
Deferred shares
There has been no change in the number of, or rights relating to, the Deferred shares during the year. The special rights, 
privileges, restrictions and limitations attached to the Deferred shares are set out below.
a) A holder of Deferred shares shall have no right to receive notice of or to attend or vote at any General meeting of the 
Company.
b) A holder of Deferred shares shall have no right to receive any dividend or distribution.
c) A holder of Deferred shares shall, on a return of capital in a liquidation but not otherwise, be entitled to receive a sum 
equal to the amount paid up or credited on each share but only after the sum of £1,000,000 per Ordinary share has 
been distributed amongst the holders of the Ordinary shares.
d) The Company may redeem the Deferred shares at any time for the sum of £1 payable in aggregate to all Deferred 
shareholders as a class.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign operations.
Other reserves
During the period, a net amount of £1,665,621 (2013: £98,025) was credited to other reserves related to share based 
payments transactions (note 22), the equity component of the deferred consideration in relation to the Redleaf acquisition 
(note 10.3) and the equity component of the convertible loan issued in the period (note 23).
22. Share based payments
Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) & Unapproved Share Option Plan 
On 18 March 2014, the Board of the Company granted options over a total of 2,500,000 Ordinary Shares of 10p each in the 
Company to Gene Golembiewski, the Group Finance Director. The exercise price of the options is 20p per share and, 
subject to the achievement of certain performance conditions, 50% of the options will vest on the first anniversary of the date 
of grant and the remaining 50% will vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant. 
Following the acquisition of PPS Group Limited (note 10.4), the Company granted options over a total of 3,600,000 Ordinary 
Shares of 10p each in the Company to two key members of the PPS staff. The exercise price of the options is 10p per share 
and, subject to the achievement of certain performance conditions, 50% of the options will vest on the first anniversary of the 
date of grant and the remaining 50% will vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant.
On 13 May 2015 the Company granted options over an aggregate of 8,070,000 ordinary shares to certain employees of the 
Group, all with an exercise price of 10p per share under its Enterprise Management Incentive and Unapproved Share Option 
Plan (“EMI and Unapproved Plans”). The options vest in three equal tranches on the first, second and third anniversary of the 
grant of the options, and will expire on the tenth anniversary of grant. 
The fair value of services received in return for the share options granted is based on the fair value of the share options 
granted measured using the Black-Scholes and Binomial models. Expected volatility is estimated by considering historical 
volatility over the period commensurate with the expected term. The following inputs were used in the measurement of the 
fair values at grant date of the share based payment plans.

During March 2014, the Company repaid £2.4 million of loans (including interest) issued by Retro Grand Limited during 2013 
and entered into a new loan agreement with Retro Grand Limited under which £3.0 million has been borrowed. The new loan 
is to be repaid or converted into 10p Ordinary Shares at the lender’s choice by the end of 2015. Legal expenses in relation to 
this facility have been added to the £3.0 million principal on the same repayment terms as the main loan. 
Retro Grand Limited is a Jersey registered company which is wholly owned by the Edward Trust. The Edward Trust is a trust 
whose sole beneficiary is one of Bob Morton’s sons, who is over the age of eighteen years, and is managed and 
administered by independent trustees. Bob Morton is neither a beneficiary nor a trustee of the Edward Trust, nor is he a 
director of Retro Grand Limited.
The secured bank loan issued by Lloyds TSB to Twenty20 Media Vision Limited  and two of its subsidiaries was fully repaid 
during 2014. The Hawk Investment loan of £450,000, acquired with the Twenty20 Media group acquisition, will be handled 
by the administration process. This loan is an arrangement between Twenty20 Media Vision Limited and Hawk Investment in 
which the Group is not a party and therefore the Group does not expect to inherit any obligation with regard to this loan. 
As a purchase consideration for acquisition of PPS Group Limited and ICAS Holdings Limited (trading as Publicasity) the 
Company issued loan notes bearing 6% coupon and redeemable in 12 months from the issue date (refer to note 10 for 
further details).

25. Operating leases
The Group operating leases mainly relate to office premises. The leases of office premises typically run for periods up to 10 
years. Leases for other fixed assets typically run for a period of 3 to 5 years. One of the leased properties, accounted for within 
discontinued activities, was sublet by the Group. The sublease expired in 2014.
During the year an amount of £1,455,907 (2013 restated: £339,449; 2013: £480,689) was recognised as an expense in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of operating leases. An amount of £21,600 (2013: £20,133) was recognised 
as income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of subleases.
At the end of the reporting period, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as 
follows:

 9,517,294 614,563
The Company received a two year rent free period as a lease incentive. The total minimum lease payments are allocated over 
the lease term evenly and therefore rent charge recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is different to the 
contractually committed cash outflow.

124 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2014
The Board considers that the amounts disclosed in the table above, net of bad debt provisions, will prove recoverable. 
However the timing of and ultimate repayment of these sums will depend on the performance and financing arrangements of 
the relevant subsidiary undertakings. Currently, the Company expects the amounts to be repaid over a number of years.
27. Subsequent events
During February 2015, the second tranche of the deferred consideration payable to the vendors of Summit Marketing 
Services Limited was settled by payment of £82,000 in cash in aggregate. No further deferred consideration is due and 
owing in respect of this acquisition. 
On 13 May 2015 the Company granted options over an aggregate of 8,070,000 ordinary shares to certain employees of the 
Group, all with an exercise price of 10p per share under its Enterprise Management Incentive and Unapproved Share Option 
Plan (“EMI and Unapproved Plans”).  The options vest in three equal tranches on the first, second and third anniversary of 
the grant of the options, and will expire on the tenth anniversary of grant.
On 28 May 2015 the Group is expected to complete the reorganisation of the Newgate companies and, as part of this 
reorganisation, the 49% minority interest in Newgate Communications LLP (and one other LLP) will be bought out in 
consideration for the issue of 9,754,000 Porta Ordinary Shares. The Porta Ordinary Shares remain subject to a minimum 
12 month lock-in period with a further 12 month orderly market period.

Notes:
1.  As a member of the Company, you are entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of your rights to 
attend, speak and vote at the AGM and you should have received a Form of Proxy with this notice of AGM. You can 
only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the Form of Proxy. Appointment of a 
proxy does not preclude you from attending the AGM and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend 
the AGM in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
2.  A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the AGM to represent you. If you wish your 
proxy to speak on your behalf at the AGM you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and 
give your instructions directly to them.
3.  To appoint a proxy using the Form of Proxy, the form must be: (i) completed and signed; (ii) sent or delivered to the 
Company’s Registrars, SLC Registrars, 42-50 Hersham Road, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, KT12 1RZ marked ‘Proxy 
Return’; and (iii) received by the Company’s Registrars no later than 11.00 a.m. on 23 June 2015.
4.  Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the Form of Proxy is signed (or a duly certified copy of such 
power or authority) must be included with the form of proxy.
5.  A member that is a company or other organisation not having a physical presence cannot attend in person but can 
appoint someone to represent it. This can be done in one of two ways: either by the appointment of a proxy (described 
in the notes above) or of a corporate representative. Members considering the appointment of a corporate 
representative should check their own legal position, the Company’s articles of association and the relevant provision 
of the Companies Act 2006.
6.  As at 28 May 2015 (being the last business day prior to the publication of this Notice) the Company’s issued share 
capital consisted of 277,327,895 Ordinary shares of 10p, carrying one vote each and 72,000,000 deferred shares 
of 0.9p which carry no right to vote. Therefore the total number of voting rights in the Company as on the date 
immediately prior to the publication of this Notice was 277,327,895.

This resolution grants the Directors authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company and other relevant securities up to 
an aggregate nominal value of £9,243,338.70, representing approximately 33.33% of the nominal value of the issued 
Ordinary share capital of the Company as at 28 May 2015, being the latest practicable date before publication of this notice. 
The Directors do not have any present intention of exercising the authorities conferred by this resolution but they consider it 
desirable that the specified amount of authorised but unissued share capital is available for issue so that they can more 
readily take advantage of possible opportunities. Unless revoked, varied or extended, this authority will expire at the 
conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or the date falling 18 months from the passing of the 
resolution, whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 6 – Directors’ power to issue shares for cash
This resolution authorises the Directors in certain circumstances to allot equity securities for cash other than in accordance 
with the statutory pre-emption rights (which require a company to offer all allotments for cash first to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their holdings). The relevant circumstances are either: i) where the allotment takes place in connection with a 
rights issue; ii) the allotment of 1,760,010 to vendors of Redleaf Polhill Limited in connection with deferred consideration to 
be paid to them; and iii) the allotment is limited to a maximum nominal amount of £2,773,278.90, representing approximately 
10% of the nominal value of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company as at 28 May 2015 being the latest 
practicable date before publication of this notice. Unless revoked, varied or extended, this authority will expire at the 
Notice of Annual General Meeting (continued)

129 Notice of Annual General Meeting (continued)
conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 18 months after the passing of the resolution, whichever 
is the earlier. The Directors consider that the power proposed to be granted by resolution 6 is necessary to retain flexibility, 
although they do not have any intention at the present time of exercising such power.
Resolution 7 – Authority to purchase shares (market purchases)
This resolution authorises the Board to make market purchases of up to 27,732,789 Ordinary shares (representing 
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued Ordinary shares as at 28 May 2015, being the latest practicable date before 
publication of this notice). Shares so purchased may be cancelled or held as treasury shares. The authority will expire at the 
end of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 18 months from the passing of the resolution, whichever is the 
earlier. The Directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent Annual General Meetings. 
The minimum price that can be paid for an Ordinary share is 10p being the nominal value of an Ordinary share. The 
maximum price that can be paid is 5% over the average of the middle market prices for an Ordinary share, derived from the 
Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange, for the five business days immediately before the day on which the share is 
contracted to be purchased.
The Directors intend to exercise this right only when, in light of the market conditions prevailing at the time and taking into 
account all relevant factors (for example, the effect on earnings per share), they believe that such purchases are in the best 
interests of the Company and shareholders generally. The overall position of the Company will be taken into account before 
deciding upon this course of action. The decision as to whether any such shares bought back will be cancelled or held in 
treasury will be made by the Directors on the same basis at the time of the purchase.
Resolution 8 – Political Donations
This resolution seeks approval from shareholders to enable the Company to make donations to incur expenditure which it 
would otherwise be prohibited from making or incurring under the relevant provision of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘2006 
Act’). The Company’s policy is not to make donations to political parties and there is no intention to change that policy. 
However the 2006 Act defines political expenditure, political donations and political organisations very broadly such that 
normal business activities which might not be thought to be political expenditure or a political donation to a political 
organisation in the usual sense may be included. For example, sponsorship of industry forums, funding of seminars and 
other functions to which politicians are invited, matching employee’s donations to certain charities, expenditure on 
organisations concerned with matters of public policy, law reform and representation of the business community and 
communicating with the Government and political parties at local, national and European level may fall under the terms of 
the 2006 Act.
Accordingly, the Company, in common with many other companies proposes to seek authority to incur a level of political 
donations to political parties, independent election candidates and political organisations as well as political expenditure, to 
cover these kinds of activities on a precautionary basis, in order to avoid possible inadvertent contravention of the 2006 Act. 
The authority does not purport to authorise any particular donation or expenditure but is expressed in general terms, as 
required by the 2006 Act. Furthermore, as permitted under the 2006 Act, the authority has been extended to cover any 
political donations made or political expenditure incurred by any subsidiaries of the Company. Therefore, as a precautionary 
measure, you will be asked to give the Company and each of its subsidiaries authority to make political donations to political 
parties or independent election candidates, to make political donations to political organisations (other than political parties) 
and to incur political expenditure. These authorities are limited to a maximum aggregate amount of £150,000.
If given, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the Company’s next annual general meeting or 18 months after the date 
of passing of this resolution (whichever is earlier). It is the Directors’ intention to renew this authority each year. 
Any political donation made or political expenditure incurred which is in excess of £200 will be disclosed in the Company’s 
Annual Report for the next financial year, as required by the Companies Act 2006. The authority will not be used to make 
political donations within the normal meaning of that expression.

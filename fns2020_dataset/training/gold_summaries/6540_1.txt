Chief Executive’s  
Review
We experienced a challenging year in 2014. While 
our overall results fell short of our growth objectives, 
our performance across most of the world outside 
China was strong. This was encouraging given 
challenges previously announced such as porcine 
epidemic diarrhoea virus (‘PEDv’). Despite our 
results in China, we continue to believe the 
opportunity there is large, that we are laying the 
right foundations for long-term success and have 
adapted our strategy to ensure this.
We continued to make good 
progress across our key strategic 
initiatives, with the acquisition 
and successful integration of 
Génétiporc in October 2013 
being a highlight. We accelerated 
genetic improvement across our 
species, which will help extend our 
product leadership and as market 
conditions improve, we are well 
positioned to accelerate growth. 
Group Performance
Overall performance across 
Genus was mixed. Genus ABS 
and PIC grew in double digits, in 
constant currency, but profits in 
Asia, and specifically China, were 
sharply lower. Sterling’s strength 
also substantially affected our 
reported results, as we earn much 
of our profit in US Dollars or related 
currencies. Adjusted profit before 
tax including joint ventures was 
£39.3m, 8% lower than in 2013 but 
unchanged in constant currency.
Volumes grew 8% in porcine and 
5% in dairy and beef, contributing 
to 8% revenue growth (12% in 
constant currency). Génétiporc 
and Asia led porcine volume 
growth. In bovine, Latin America 
rebounded strongly and our 
Indian business performed well.
Genus ABS increased profits by 
12% in constant currency, with 
all regions contributing, and a 
strong performance from our beef 
business. Genus PIC profits rose 
10% in constant currency, with 
contributions from the Génétiporc 
acquisition, continued good 
growth in Latin America and solid 
trading in North America, despite 
disease affecting the industry.
In Asia, the reduction in Chinese 
porcine profit was principally 
caused by our planned investments 
in capacity combined with very 
adverse market conditions for pig 
producers in the first half of this 
calendar year, but there is evidence 
these conditions are improving.
Strategy
The market opportunity for 
animal genetics is large and 
growing, driven by increasing 
animal protein consumption by 
a rising and increasingly urban 
global population. To meet this 
demand, farmers are increasingly 
employing technology, larger-scale 
production and the best genetics. 
Genus’s clear global leadership in 
porcine, dairy and beef is a firm 
foundation for growth. We have 
continued to execute vigorously 
the strategy we announced 
in 2012 and made substantial 
progress during the year.
In October 2013, we acquired 
Génétiporc, the Americas’ second-
largest porcine genetics company, 
for £22m. In February 2014, our 
Brazilian joint venture acquired 
Génétiporc do Brasil. This has 
enhanced our leadership in the 
Americas and brought valuable 
additional genetic traits into our 
porcine pure lines. We have rapidly 
integrated their operations and are 
on track to deliver the expected 
US$11m (£6.7m) of annual synergies 
by the end of the second year.
In China, our joint venture with 
Besun and our wholly-owned 
porcine nucleus farm, Chun Hua, 
became fully operational. These 
have enabled us to introduce 
new products and the latest 
genetics into China, and more 
than doubled our capacity there. 
We are already seeing the benefit, 
with customers such as New Hope, 
China’s largest feed producer 
and a top ten integrated pork 
producer, selecting PIC genetics. 
Our additional Chinese capacity 
brought expected start-up costs 
and greater exposure to commodity 
prices at a challenging time in 
the porcine market there. We are 
adjusting our strategy to deliver, 
where possible, future capacity 
increments through commercial 
multiplication agreements. We 
recently announced an agreement 
with Riverstone, a US-led group 
investing in China, to become a 
commercial multiplier and a royalty-
based customer there. This approach 
will reduce the number of porcine 
joint ventures we execute and reduce 
investment and commodity risk. 07

Additional 
Information
During the year, we signed our 
first bovine royalty agreement 
with ABP Food Group, the UK’s 
largest integrated beef processor, to 
develop proprietary indices for beef 
bulls and deliver superior genetics 
into their supply chain. We are also 
creating a beef nucleus herd, to 
accelerate genetic gain and increase 
our control of the resulting genetics.
Our Research and Development 
(‘R&D’) programmes used advanced 
selection techniques to accelerate 
genetic gain in the porcine nucleus 
herds. We also reduced further 
the lag between the genetics in 
the porcine nucleus and those on 
customers’ farms so they see the 
benefits of improved genetics more 
quickly. In dairy, the initial bull calves 
born from our recently established 
elite female herd included two 
with genomic test scores among 
the highest ABS has ever seen. 
These should start producing in 
late 2015. The project to develop 
a novel proprietary method of 
producing sexed bovine semen 
achieved an important milestone in 
successfully completing large-scale 
field trials. In July 2014, we initiated 
US legal proceedings against 
Sexing Technologies, the current 
provider of sexed semen, alleging 
abuse of its monopoly position.
Our People
In November 2013, Dr Denny Funk 
retired as Chief Scientific Officer 
and head of R&D after 19 years of 
service. We wish him well and are 
grateful for his many contributions. 
Dr Jonathan Lightner has joined 
us from DuPont Pioneer, where 
he was head of agricultural 
biotechnology, to replace Dr Funk. 
His broad experience in genetics 
and focus on intellectual property 
is already proving very valuable. 
Saskia Korink Romani became 
Chief Operating Officer of ABS and 
has moved to Madison, Wisconsin 
to lead that business. Tom Kilroy, 
our Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, left to pursue a 
commercial career and Dan Hartley 
replaced him, joining from Shire plc 
where he was Senior Vice President 
and International Counsel. Overall, 
our Genus Executive Leadership 
Team (‘GELT’) is highly talented 
and working well together.
Our employees’ energy, ability 
and passion are fundamental to 
our success. During the year, we 
further strengthened our people 
management practices, training 
and talent development. We also 
conducted our first employee survey, 
with 80% participating. The results 
showed significant commitment to 
our vision, values and strategy. 
Outlook
We are cautiously optimistic that 
2014’s challenges are starting to 
abate. While PEDv is still affecting 
our royalty revenues, there are signs 
that producers are learning to cope 
with it. The severe downturn in 
Chinese pig prices in 2014 has led to 
a reduction in the sow herd, which 
should better balance supply and 
demand in 2015. Additionally, the 
outlook for harvests in the Northern 
Hemisphere appears favourable 
which should lead to lower input 
costs for our customers. Although 
some headwinds remain, our 
business is positioned to accelerate 
growth and we expect to perform 
in line with expectations in 2015.

Market Opportunities
The Animal Genetics Market – Large and Growing
Global demand for animal protein is significant and 
growing. Meeting this demand is becoming more 
difficult as urbanisation increases, competing needs 
for land and water intensify and consumers require 
affordable, safe and high-quality animal protein. 
Genetics is critical to solving this global challenge, 
presenting a £3–4 billion gross profit opportunity. 
Three key drivers impact the use of high-quality 
animal genetics.
Growth in Protein 
Consumption
Animal protein consumption 
affects demand for animal genetics 
globally. Demand for animal protein 
continues to grow by 1–3% per 
year, and is rising particularly in 
emerging markets such as Brazil, 
Russia, India and China, where 
urbanisation is increasing rapidly. 
The chart below shows that this 
powerful trend – coupled with a 
continually rising global population 
– will continue for decades to come.

As consumers move from an 
agricultural lifestyle to an urban 
setting, they become wealthier 
and keener on consuming animal 
proteins such as milk in India and 
pork in Russia, where consumption 
in the last five years has increased 
by 21% and 25% respectively.

Additional 
Information
Farmers increasingly use high-quality 
genetics to meet demand. In dairy, artificial 
insemination (‘AI’) use has reached 
70% in the US, with large enterprise 
and commercial herds providing half 
of US milk production. In Mexico and 
India, AI is now used in around 50% of 
the herds, while in Brazil it is 13%.
In porcine, scale and integration drive the 
use of high-quality genetics. Large-scale 
integrated pork production continues 
to grow and now accounts for 60% of 
production in the US and 85% in Brazil. 
Large-scaled farming production in China 
grew from 11% in 2008 to 20% in 2014. 
Short-term, farmer profitability also 
affects the use of high-quality animal 
genetics. Low feed costs and high output 
prices give farmers cash flow to invest in 
genetics that can significantly boost their 
efficiency and long-term profitability. 
Milk, pork and beef profitability varies 
around the world, with markets at different 
stages of the cycle. For example, in the 
US, pork producers are considering 
expansion due to record pig prices, while 
Chinese pig producers await a market 
rebound before upgrading their genetics.
Farmers’ Use of Technology Farmer Profitability
“Demand for animal protein continues 
to grow by 1–3% per year particularly 
in emerging markets.”
Summary
In summary, the animal genetics market is large and 
continues to grow, as more technology is used to 
address the productivity challenge and meet the 
growing demand for milk, pork and beef.

Infrastructure is the backbone 
of the economy and society. 
Everyone relies on energy, 
water, communications, 
transport and buildings.
Balfour Beatty finances, 
develops, builds and maintains the 
infrastructure that underpins daily 
life, supports communities and 
enables economic growth.
Together with our partners and 
supply chain of small and large 
firms, we know how to deliver 
innovative, efficient and highly 
complex infrastructure projects 
with the highest levels of quality, 
safety and technical expertise. 
We integrate with customers and 
local supply chains, and work with 
local communities.

Linden	Homes
We develop bespoke homes in prime locations, primarily in 
the South of England and the eastern counties. Our homes 
complement their surroundings and we take pride in their quality 
and attention to detail. 
We often build on brownfield sites and use our construction 
division to help us deliver the most complex developments, 
differentiating us in the market. We have a strong focus on meeting 
our customers’ needs and our success has been recognised 
through numerous industry awards in recent years.
Linden Homes currently delivers around 3,000 houses and 
apartments each year, the majority of which are for private sale.
Galliford	Try	Partnerships
Partnerships provides specialist contracting services to housing 
associations and local authorities. We have a strong presence in 
the South and North East of England and a growing business 
across the rest of the country. 
Partnerships also develops mixed tenure projects, producing 
private housing on sites that are predominantly affordable 
developments. We draw on Linden Homes’ expertise in housing 
development and sales to successfully deliver these projects. 
Partnerships delivered 220 private units in the year.

southern	focus	give	Linden	Homes	a	strong

Group	structure

housebuilding and construction. Our 
business model (pages 10 and 11) 
explains the advantages of this 
hybrid structure.
A	complete	offering	in	affordable

Aligning Galliford Try Partnerships with 
Linden Homes reinforces our leading 
position in affordable housing, allowing us 
to offer both contracting and mixed tenure 
developments to our clients. The Aylesbury

London, combines homes for sale, 
affordable rent and shared ownership.

A	diverse	construction	
business
We are seeing encouraging 
signs in construction markets. 
Over the coming years, 
we expect to see attractive 
opportunities to grow, 
particularly through framework 
contracts, in the private sector 
and by taking on more major 
projects. Examples include the 
Queensferry Crossing over the 
Firth of Forth in Scotland 
(above) and Flow, an office 
development in Staines, 
Middlesex (right).

A	premium	housebuilder
Linden Homes is positioned for further growth, 
benefiting from its record landbank of prime sites, 
rising profit margins, and by building more houses and 
fewer apartments. Pictured left, the Swallowhurst 
development in Cranleigh near Guildford sets a new 
benchmark, featuring Linden Homes’ highest priced 
home sold to date. Below, Thornbury Park is set in the 
prime location of Isleworth, Middlesex.

People	are	vital	to	our	success
To achieve our growth plans over the period 
to 2018, we will need to retain and develop 
our people, and to recruit more than 1,000 
new employees. We are therefore delighted 
to be joined by around 600 experienced 
staff following the acquisition of Miller 
Construction in July 2014. More information 
about how we manage our people can be 
found on pages 36 and 37.

 Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to report that over the year the group has returned to growth, with sales for the year ended 31 May 2005
increased by 7% to £262.9m (2004 £245.1m) and operating proﬁt increased by 42% to £6.8m (2004 £4.8m). The proﬁt
before tax was £5.5m (2004 £0.9m) and the proﬁt after tax was £5.3m (2004 £1.8m loss).
The Board is therefore proposing to maintain a ﬁnal dividend of 1.80p (2004 1.80p) payable on 1 November 2005 to
shareholders on the register at 23 September 2005.
This year, it has been satisfying to observe the progress made in both the Wireless Infrastructure and Integrated Product
divisions. Wireless Infrastructure achieved sales growth of 16% and with continuing attention to manufacturing costs
increased operating proﬁt by 68%, year on year. The Integrated Products division, where sales grew by 26% (after the
exclusion of the business sold in December 2003), again continued the trend of reducing operating losses achieving 26%
reduction year on year.
In July 2005, the company arranged an amended bank facility with Barclays and ABN AMRO, rescheduling these facilities
over a ﬁve year term with revised ﬁnancial covenants. 
The focus during the main part of the year for the Handset Products division has been its preparation for disposal. I am
now pleased to announce that exclusive negotiations are progressing.
The year has also been active for the company in strengthening the Board. The role of Chairman and Group CEO has
been divided. John Roulston joined as Group CEO on 6 September 2004 and Charles Hindson as Group Finance
Director on 14 December 2004. Iain Gibson joined on 21 February 2005 and became CEO of the Integrated Products
division on 6 April 2005. 
During the coming year, the Board intends to appoint new non-executive directors and has engaged external advisors
to assist with the appointments. I am, though, gratiﬁed that current non-executive directors are willing to offer
themselves for re-election at the annual general meeting until their successors are appointed and, for this interim period,
to bring their independent advice to the company’s affairs. 
Looking to the coming year, we see continued growth prospects for the group. Wireless Infrastructure is experiencing a
substantial market recovery and the strategic efforts undertaken over the past few years in power ampliﬁers are
increasing our presence in this important market sector. In Integrated Products, we have acquired volume contracts in
compound semiconductors for our foundry at Newton Aycliffe, which now requires to meet the ramp up in its
production, and strengthened our defence position in the United States through a contract for supply of sub-systems
for upgrade of widely deployed airborne electronic countermeasures equipment.
I would also like to thank all of our employees across our different operations throughout the world for their continued
dedication and contribution to the business, reﬂecting in particular on the difﬁcult changes that have take place in
reducing manufacturing at the Shipley site in the UK. For the coming year, the group is well positioned for growth, due
to strengthening markets in the communications sector.

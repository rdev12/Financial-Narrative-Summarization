 2 Senior plc
Chairman’s Statement
During the course of 2002, the Group faced
frequent changes to customer requirements,
particularly in the civil aerospace market
where the industry adjusted demand levels
downwards throughout the year. This was 
in addition to the recessionary environment
experienced in most parts of our business.
Nevertheless, the Group continued to
implement improvements in the operational
aspects of the business and emerged in
better managerial order at the end of the
year. In addition, and very importantly, 
the Group net debt was reduced from £122.7m
at the beginning of 2002 to £87.4m at the
end – a 29% drop in a difﬁcult trading year
and firm evidence of the quality of the
underlying businesses and the improving
ﬁnancial position of the Group.
Financial Headlines
Group turnover from continuing operations fell 10.3% in the 
year to £398.7m and operating proﬁt from continuing operations
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items declined 
from £34.0m to £24.7m. Group profit before tax declined from
£9.5m to £7.0m resulting in underlying earnings per share of 
4.47p (2001 – 5.51p).
Operations
Aerospace sales dropped by 16.4% in 2002 to £164.6m (2001 – £196.8m),
as the full year impact of reduced demand from the civil market was
seen. This was mitigated to some extent by improved demand from
the military and defence sectors. Operating proﬁts before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, which had dropped sharply 
in the first half, recovered a little in the second half to end the 
year at £8.4m (2001 – £18.0m).
Sales in the Automotive Division declined by 7.2% to £148.4m 
(2001 – £160.0m). This was primarily due to some of our product
programmes in North America coming to an end. Operating proﬁts before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional items were £12.7m (2001 – £12.8m) 
with an operating margin, on this basis, of 8.6% (2001 – 8.0%).
The Specialised Industrial Division recorded sales of £86.1m 
(2001 – £88.5m). The operating margin, before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items, improved from 3.6% to 4.2% with the
associated operating proﬁts ahead by 12.5% to £3.6m.
These results are stated before £1.3m (2001 – £2.9m) of costs incurred
on reorganisation programmes to deal with the adverse market conditions.
During the year the Group disposed of its four European expansion
joint operations with the proceeds contributing to the debt reduction.
Dividend
In 2001, dividend levels were amended to bring the dividend cover
back to a more appropriate level for the business. In line with this
policy the Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.35p per 
share in respect of 2002, bringing the total dividend for the year 
to 2.00p per share (2001 – 2.00p).
Employees and the Board
During the year, Mike Sheppard joined the Board, having worked as
an executive within Senior for a number of years. Mike is the Chief
Executive of the Automotive Division and the North American Industrial
operations. He is a US citizen and works out of Chicago. Having been
elected by the Board during the year he will stand for re-election 
by the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Richard Turner, who has been a non-executive Director of Senior 
since 1996, has agreed to a further two year term until July 2004 
and offers himself for re-election by the shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting. During 2002, Richard was awarded the CMG in the
Queen’s Birthday Honours List and the Group congratulates him upon
his award. In addition, John Hudson, who retired from the Board 
in 2001 after nine years as a non-executive Director, was awarded 
the OBE and we send our congratulations to him.
During 2002 employee numbers were reduced to bring capacity in
line with demand and many operational changes and improvements
were implemented. In this tough and uncertain period, and throughout
all the necessary changes, there has been unstinting enthusiasm 
and support from our employees, for which we thank them. Annual Report & Accounts 2002 3
Outlook
It is hoped that the rescheduling of aerospace orders was largely
completed in 2002. 2003 has started with a more settled outlook,
albeit at this lower level of demand, but at levels that have been
planned for by the operations. Barring further market deterioration, 
we expect some modest recovery in our aerospace performance,
helped by new programmes starting volume production and the
benefits of operational improvements coming through.
Senior Automotive will be impacted by two programme conclusions 
in 2003 and automotive production volumes in North America and
Europe are softening. We remain cautious on the outlook. In Specialised
Industrial, trading conditions in North America are reasonable although
those in Europe are generally more difﬁcult.
We expect 2003 to be another challenging year with manufacturing
recession and political uncertainty continuing. Nevertheless, Senior 
is operationally in much better condition to deal with this period 
of uncertainty and the lower debt level allows the Group to look
forward to the future with renewed confidence.

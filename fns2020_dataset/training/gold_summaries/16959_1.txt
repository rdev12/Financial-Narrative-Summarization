Chief Executive’s review 
 
Overview 
 
There is no question that this was a difficult year for the company, in which a number of setbacks and challenges had to 
be overcome. 
 
After applying considerable resources to improving the efficiency of our mines, the collapse in copper prices and the 
global financial crisis made their continued operation unsustainable. Following our decision to close the mines, we had to 
raise funds to ensure that all redundancy payments were met and creditors paid, and that the mines would be maintained 
in good standing. We then needed to focus our efforts on the smelter business, ensuring its continued viability and 
improved performance. 
 
Operational review 
 
Mining 
 
By our year end 2007/08, we had invested considerable resources both in terms of management time and money to 
improve the efficiency of our mining operations. As a result of these investments, our mine production for the first quarter 
of the year (July to September 2008) reached record levels. Between July and December 2008, however, world copper 
prices fell steeply from circa US$8,000 per tonne to just over US$3,000 per tonne – well below the company‟s average 
cost of production at the time of approximately US$5,000 per tonne. 
 
Although we had copper hedges in place until December 2008 to protect us from the immediate impact of this price 
collapse, it was clear that drastic action would have to be taken to protect the company as the hedges expired. 
 
Weatherly embarked on a programme of cost-cutting measures that initially included closure of the Tsumeb West and 
Matchless mines, and selective retrenchments at Otjihase and Tschudi. However, continuing falls in the copper price 
compelled us to place these last two mines on care and maintenance as well. The closure of our mines was conducted in 
an orderly manner, with appropriate compensation being paid to all employees made redundant. The licences for all the 
company‟s mining assets have been maintained in good standing, with the exception of Elbe where our exploration 
licence was not renewed but an appeal has been lodged against that decision. 
 
New funding totalling US$11.3 million was raised from Chelopech and Louis Dreyfus, two of the major suppliers of 
concentrates to the smelter. The bulk of this money was used to fund the expansion and ongoing requirements of the 
Tsumeb smelter. A portion of the money, together with proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, was also used to meet 
the cost of keeping the Otjihase mine dewatered. 
 
Weatherly currently has five copper mines and a zinc lead project (Berg Aukas) on care and maintenance. The company 
is considering a range of strategic options for maximising the value of its portfolio, and future investment will focus on 
those assets that have the scale and cost structure to deliver the highest returns to our shareholders. The development 
of an open pit mine to exploit the shallow dipping tabular orebody at Tschudi, which is located 26 kilometres from the 
Tsumeb concentrator and smelter, is a particularly promising project. 
 
In October 2009 we announced the results of an independent JORC compliant resource estimate for Tschudi by Coffey 
Mining (SA) (Pty) Ltd. The estimate incorporated the results of a 200 hole infill drilling program completed in 2007 and 
2008. This was aimed at further defining the previous historic resource estimate completed in 2002. The new estimate of 
47.7mt @ 0.86% copper (0.3% cut off grade) is slightly increased over the last global estimate based on historical drilling 
(43mt @ 0.83% Copper including inferred – Mintek 2002), but more importantly increases the confidence level relating to 
the measured and indicated categories which now comprise approximately 60% of the global resource. 
 
Within the global resource Coffey have analysed the potentially open pitable resource using a cut off of 0.3% Cu. down 
to a vertical depth of 180m. A Measured and Indicated resource has been estimated at 25.2 million tonnes of ore grading 
0.92% Cu.  This relatively shallow resource will form the basis of the next stage of the pit optimisation and design 
process to be completed later this year. 
 
Work is currently underway to complete the detailed mine planning and scheduling for the Tschudi open pit. Consultants 
have also been engaged to determine the most suitable processing route. Final feasibility work is expected to be 
completed by mid 2010, with development possible thereafter subject to financing and a positive outcome to these 
studies. 
 
A significant proportion of the Tschudi resource is too deep to mine by open pit methods, and it is the company‟s 
intention to resume underground operations at Tschudi once the pit is exhausted. 
 
Weatherly, acting as subcontractor to Wadi Al Rawda Industrial Investments (Wadi), completed a bankable feasibility 
study in 2008 for the development of the Tambao manganese project in Burkina Faso.  Wadi subsequently applied for a 
mining licence to develop the project in early 2009, but is yet to receive a formal response from the government of  WEATHERLY INTERNATIONAL PLC

Burkina Faso. The Tambao deposit contains a resource of 13mt of ore grading 54% manganese (AMC 2008).  While the 
mine itself is a relatively straight forward open pit, the logistics of getting the ore to market is the key to the viability of the 
project.  Weatherly will open negotiations with Wadi as soon as the mining licence is granted. 
 
The company has also completed an internal evaluation of the viability of reopening the Otjihase and Matchless mines 
following the recent improvement in copper prices.

Smelting 
 
The Tsumeb smelter is one of only five commercial-scale smelters operating in Africa. It is linked by rail to our central 
and northern operations, and importantly to the Atlantic port of Walvis Bay. Because of the earlier improvements made to 
the smelter, we were in a good position to change its operating regime following the closure of our mines. 
 
Historically, the smelter had been an integral part of the mining operations and Weatherly initially followed suit, rebuilding 
the small reverbatory furnace in 2006 to accommodate its own mine production. The furnace operated effectively, but 
had relatively high operating costs because of its small throughput. In order to reduce costs and fully utilise the existing 
infrastructure of the original, much larger plant, we decided to expand the smelter to process imported concentrates in 
addition to the company‟s own production. To maximise profitability, we targeted third-party concentrates that would 
command a premium to be processed - such concentrates are typically low in copper and high in precious metals (gold 
and silver), and contain penalty elements such as arsenic. 
 
During the reporting period, we implemented a number of additional improvements to the smelter. The conversion of a 
top submerged lance furnace (Ausmelt) from lead to copper smelting was completed at a cost of US$10 million in 
September 2008. In addition, an oxygen plant that will increase the efficiency of the top submerged lance furnace is 
under construction, with completion scheduled for December 2009. The combined effect of these improvements will be to 
essentially double the smelter‟s current capacity. 
 
In order to underpin the future operation of the smelter on a stand-alone basis, we extended our agreements with 
existing concentrate suppliers. As part of this arrangement, Chelopech entered into an agreement to provide NCS, our 
wholly owned subsidiary which operates the Tsumeb smelter, with a US$7 million facility. The company also entered into 
a separate agreement with Louis Dreyfus to provide an additional US$4.3 million facility. 
 
The terms of the loans included the extension of the three-year contract to process imported concentrates from 
Chelopech and Louis Dreyfus for a period of five years. During this period, Louis Dreyfus will also be the exclusive off-
taker of copper blister produced by the Tsumeb smelter and the exclusive supplier of additional copper concentrates 
required by the smelter. Under the terms of this contract, the Tsumeb smelter will process up to 120,000 dry metric 
tonnes (dmt) of concentrates in 2009, increasing to over 200,000 dmt from 2010 onwards following commissioning of the 
oxygen plant. 
 
Concurrent with entering into the new loans above, Weatherly also renegotiated the terms of the existing US$12 million 
convertible loan notes. Repayment was rescheduled into three annual instalments, with US$3 million due to be paid in 
May 2009, US$4 million in May 2010 and US$5 million in May 2011. The conversion price was also reduced from  
23.5 pence to 8 pence, and in return the note holders waived previous acts of default under the terms of the original loan 
note. (In May 2009, the company elected to defer the initial payment in order to rebuild its cash reserves.) 
 
The company‟s focus during the first six months of 2009 was to continue optimising the new Ausmelt furnace in order to 
achieve the forecast smelter performance. The smelter treated 29,546 tonnes of concentrate in the first quarter of 2009 
and 29,994 tonnes in the second quarter, giving a total of 59,540 tonnes. The majority of concentrates were sourced 
from Chelopech and El Brocal. 
 
By year end, NCS had been successfully transformed from a tied, downstream processing plant to a standalone tolling 
business. During 2008, Weatherly was a buyer and seller of copper products from its mines and was severely affected by 
the sharp decline in metal prices. In contrast, from January 2009 onwards, NCS has been paid purely on a dollar per  WEATHERLY INTERNATIONAL PLC

prices. 
 
The other major concentrate supply contract with Louis Dreyfus continues through to mid-2014, with tonnages and 
treatment charges agreed in principle. These terms and conditions have been ratified for the next two years (2010 and 
2011) and, after adjustment for 2008 final reconciliations, are some 10% better than the terms applying in 2009.

Post year end events 
 
As announced on 31 July 2009, the company completed a placement of 40,468,000 ordinary shares (approximately 9% 
of the company‟s enlarged issued share capital) to DPM to raise proceeds of US$2 million. The placement proceeds are 
to be applied to NCS and are being used to complete the construction of a new residue disposal site, which is required to 
meet the exacting environmental standards set by the company. NCS is a major producer of arsenic trioxide, a 
substance that is sold in increasing quantities to the agri-chemical industry, and negotiations are underway to increase 
the volumes supplied under the current contract with the Malaysian company Amcrop. 
 
The placement will also provide additional working capital to NCS when the Ausmelt furnace ceases production for 
approximately three weeks in February 2010 in order to reline the furnace. The oxygen plant is now expected to be 
commissioned in December 2009, which will allow an initial run such that any post-commissioning modifications can be 
carried out during the February shutdown. 
 
Pursuant to the subscription agreement, DPM has also agreed to subscribe for further ordinary shares at the option of 
the company for maximum proceeds of US$5 million. If the company elects to take up this option, the ordinary shares 
would be subscribed for at the higher of prevailing market price or 3 pence per ordinary share. As a condition of the 
subscription agreement, Chelopech, a subsidiary of DPM, and NCS have entered into a new agreement to extend the 
existing concentrate supply agreement through to 2020 on terms which are 10% more favourable than those of the 
existing supply agreement. 
 
On 15 September 2009, Weatherly announced the signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI) with East China Mineral Exploration 
and Development Bureau (ECE), whereby a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECE will subscribe for 446,851,840 new shares 
in the company at a price of 3.6 pence per share, for total proceeds of £16.087 million. Assuming the transaction is 
completed as set out in the LOI, ECE would own 50.1% of the enlarged share capital of the company. 
 
The proceeds from the proposed transaction will be utilised firstly in redeeming US$3 million plus accrued interest 
(approximately US$1.5 million as at 30 September 2009) of the outstanding loan capital of Weatherly, and secondly in 
providing capital for the company‟s mining operations, smelter and development projects in Namibia and Burkina Faso. 
Proceeds may also be used to redeem the remaining US$9 million and associated interest of the outstanding convertible 
loan as and when these fall due. 
 
There are a number of conditions precedent to the conclusion of the transaction, which is scheduled for the end of 
January 2010. Apart from due diligence, these include consents to be obtained from the relevant authorities in China and 
from the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, and the approval of our shareholders at a general meeting. 
 
I shall comment further on this important development for our company at the end of this review. 
 
Weatherly has entered into an option agreement with a South African company, Cubenco 192 Pty Ltd („Cubenco‟) 
whereby Cubenco has the option to purchase the Kombat mine from WMN‟s subsidiary, Ongopolo Mining Ltd for total 
consideration of US$3million. Kombat does not form part of Weatherly‟s future development plans.  Cubenco has paid a 
non-refundable option fee of R1.2million, (US$160,000) and has 42 days in which to complete its due diligence and 
make a second payment of US$600,000. Assuming this payment is made the final payment of US$2.24 million is due by 
the end of March 2010.   WEATHERLY INTERNATIONAL PLC

Financial results 
 
Revenue for the year increased to US$108.5 million from US$105.4 million in the previous financial year. The second 
half of the year contributed only US$33.6 million of this revenue comprising entirely revenue from smelting activities 
following the closure of the Company‟s mines in the first half as the company converted its smelting operation to a toll 
basis after fulfilling its 2008 contractual commitments. Weatherly recorded a gross loss for the year of US$16.2 million 
compared to a gross profit of US$4.9 million for the previous year. 
 
This weaker performance resulted from sharply lower copper prices in terms of sales in the year and settlement of 
debtors at last year end, as well as from higher one-time operational costs associated with the closure of our mines - 
specifically redundancy costs, ongoing care and maintenance costs, and development costs that would otherwise have 
been capitalised had the Board not decided to write off those assets. The company also incurred losses on the sale of 
non-core mining assets to pay outstanding creditors and finance the care and maintenance programme. 
 
The net loss for the period of US$30.7 million, or US 7.59 cents per share, included an expense of US$2.7 million 
reflecting an adjustment to the fair value of the group‟s share options in Emerging Metals Limited (EML) which are valued 
on a marked-to-market basis; a profit on the exercise of copper put options of US$2.7 million; and deferred revenue of 
US$4.9 million released in relation to the initial value of the sale of the slag dumps to EML following that company‟s 
admission to AIM on 1 July 2008.  
 
During the first quarter of 2009, the group sold assets worth US$7.1 million, cleared all creditors (approximately US$7.2 
million) and funded the care and maintenance of all its mining assets.  At year end, the mining subsidiary (WMN) was 
effectively debt-free with the exception of royalties US$1 million (N$9.7 million) and contested payments to NamPower - 
both of which fall under the Ministry of Mines and Energy and are the subject of commercial negotiations associated with 
the possible reopening of the mines. In the meantime, the Namibian government has accepted security in the form of a 
number of farms and properties currently being sold. 
 
As the copper price continued to recover, a halt was put to any further sales of assets that would either diminish the 
value of the mines or increase the cost of reopening them.  As a result, payments to noteholders originally on asset sales 
were deferred until 2010 to preserve cash and allow for the full value of the mining assets to be retained. 
 
Marketing, sales and treasury 
 
During the second half of 2008, Weatherly sold its copper production on delivery to the Walvis Bay terminal to traders on 
a four-month forward London Metals Exchange (LME) price. The average weighted copper price achieved during the 
July to December 2008 period was US$5,409 per tonne. Copper prices throughout the year ranged from a high of 
US$8,985 per tonne in July 2008 to a low of US$3,106 per tonne. 
 
Weatherly also sold 40,626 ounces of gold and 189,014 ounces of silver contained in the copper blister. Average gold 
price for the year was US$869 per ounce and silver US$13.37 per ounce. Precious metals accounted for 39% of 
revenue. 
 
The company maintained a copper floor price protection programme and, as at 30 June 2008, had in place “puts” for 800 
tonnes of copper per month until January 2009 at US$5,000 per tonne. These “puts” expired at the end of calendar year 
2008, and the company received payments of US$2.7 million in respect of these hedges. Mining operations ceased in 
December 2008, and only minor residual sales were recorded after this date. 
 
In the second half of the reporting period, the company‟s only operations were those of its smelting subsidiary, NCS. 
NCS is now purely a processor of imported concentrates and derives its entire revenue from treatment charges and 
penalty charges. All concentrates are supplied by either Chelopech or Louis Dreyfus and the materials remain the 
property of the suppliers. Under these circumstances, the smelter cash flow is not exposed to copper price but is affected 
by changes in the Namibian dollar (pegged to the South African rand) relative to the US dollar, and year end metal 
reconciliations. 
 
During the reporting period, the average US dollar to South African rand exchange rate was 9.16663, with severe 
fluctuations from 7.156 to 11.85 recorded between August 2008 and March 2009. Towards the end of the financial year, 
the rand appreciated strongly against the US dollar, which raised operating costs at the smelter and reduced operating 
margins without any appreciable benefit in the cost. 
 
In June 2009, we announced the sale of our entire shareholding of 21,899,698 ordinary shares in EML for a total 
consideration of approximately US$1.6 million. The company still holds 13,075,179 options in EML. 
 
As at 30 June 2009, Weatherly held cash reserves (in sterling and US dollars) equivalent to US$2 million (as at 23 
October 2009 US$2.6 million).

Environment 
 
During 2009, the company funded the Ongopolo Environmental Trust, the independent body responsible for all 
environmental liabilities (past and future), and engaged consultants, Synergistics Environmental Services to carry out 
baseline emissions surveys as part of a new environmental impact statement to be submitted to the Department of the 
Environment in advance of new legislation due to be enacted in 2010. 
 
Adopting a proactive stance, the company is currently completing construction of a new converter cooling tower, which is 
expected to bring gas emission levels at the smelter well inside the new limits expected to be gazetted in 2010. 
 
In addition, the company has also brought forward construction of a new residue disposal site which will be 
commissioned in July 2010 to deal primarily with arsenic dusts not reprocessed by the arsenic refinery. The majority of 
arsenic during the financial year was reprocessed into an arsenic trioxide product which is sold to South African and 
Malaysian agri-chemical companies. 
 
We also commissioned consultants Thuthuka Group to investigate the feasibility of an acid plant utilising the SO
2 
emissions from the expanded Ausmelt furnace as a feed source for sulphur production. The feasibility study is primarily 
targeting the severe shortage of acid likely to arise in Namibia with the development of a number of new uranium mines, 
but a significant environmental benefit would also result. 
 
A number of other projects were initiated in 2009 to improve data collection and reporting. The company is committed to 
complying fully with Namibia‟s new legislation and to maintaining the highest international standards in its operations. 
 
Outlook 
 
After an extraordinarily difficult year, I believe that we have weathered the storm and the measures we have taken to 
reconfigure and further strengthen our smelting business demonstrate the value of our total asset base. 
 
We successfully negotiated agreements that enabled us to progress our strategy of upgrading the smelter and securing 
long-term supplies of premium concentrates. Although not currently in production, the mines are being maintained in 
good standing, and following the steady recovery of copper prices, we are preparing plans for the eventual reopening of 
the Otjihase and Matchless mines. Additionally, we are progressing development of the open pit at Tschudi, and 
continuing to pursue our interests in the promising manganese project at Tambao in Burkina Faso. 
 
The signing of the LOI with ECE represents a major opportunity for Weatherly and could signal a dramatic change in our 
fortunes. We are now working to clear the conditions precedent and to complete the transaction by the end of January 
2010. ECE has recognised the value inherent in Weatherly‟s asset base and management team, and is prepared to 
invest heavily to obtain a controlling position in the company. 
 
The benefits of the transaction to Weatherly shareholders are considerable, and include: 
 The creation of a strategic relationship with an important Chinese metals group that brings potential for very 
significant growth for the company; 
 An immediate and substantial injection of working capital, and repayment of the first US$3 million and 
associated interest of the outstanding convertible loan notes; 
 A greatly improved balance sheet and increased shareholder value;  WEATHERLY INTERNATIONAL PLC

 Accelerated development of the Tschudi open pit copper project; 
 Adequate funding to underpin the current expansion of the smelter to meet all the needs of both current and 
future concentrate suppliers; 
 The ability to reopen the Otjihase and Matchless mines, currently on care and maintenance, to take advantage 
of improving copper prices; 
 The possibility of acquiring additional exploration concessions in Namibia and potentially other mineral resource 
projects in China and elsewhere; 
 Access to ECE‟s exploration capability and mining expertise, with the potential to achieve improved resource 
recovery and cost efficiencies at WTI operations; and 
 A further strengthening of our relations with the Namibian government, at the highest levels. 
 
I believe that the proposed relationship with ECE will ensure an exciting and prosperous future for Weatherly 
International. It will enable us to realise the full value of our current asset base, and to capitalise on new opportunities for 
growth that I am confident will arise as a result of ECE‟s ambitious plans for the continuing development of our company.

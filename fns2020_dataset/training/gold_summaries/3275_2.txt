diﬃcult things done well
Success in UK engineering has not been easy to achieve in recent years, but its requirements can be simply stated; 
winners must do diﬃcult things and must do them well.
We deﬁne “diﬃcult things” as activities with high engineering content delivering technically demanding products 
or processes. To take proﬁtable advantage of them it is essential that a business is properly managed and performs 
well. Our ideal acquisition is a business where diﬃcult things are done poorly, allowing us to add value by improving  
performance.

Our Performance
The Board is pleased to report another year 
of progress in which ZOO has performed in 
line with market expectations. The group 
increased its operating profit
1
 to $1.3m 
(compared with $821k in 2010), and EBITDA 
rose to $2.3m (from $1.6m in 2010), despite 
a decline in revenue to $14m (from $15m 
in 2010). The decline in revenue arose from 
two primary causes: a short-term slowdown 
in projects from our largest customer during 
a major organisation change there, and 
a reduction in the amount of low margin 
subtitling work which has traditionally 
been subcontracted to a third party vendor. 
Cash generation was also affected by this 
temporary slowdown in orders, and our year 
end cash balance was $0.6m.
During the year ZOO has made significant 
progress in reducing its dependence on the 
filmed entertainment industry. Although 
extending and deepening our customer 
relationships in this large industry remains 
vital to our business, the alliance with MPS, 
announced last year, has now yielded its 
first significant customer contracts outside 
the sector. In addition, our software and 
service platforms have shown themselves 
to be ideally suited to the management 
and electronic delivery of a wide range of 
creative media content, such as music, video 
game materials and, most significantly, 
eBooks. The Chief Executive’s operational 
review provides more details of these 
exciting developments for the group. 
Shareholders will be aware that in 
September 2006 the Company issued a 
five-year convertible loan note of $5.6m 
(£3.54m) to be either redeemed or 
converted into shares prior to October 2011.  
I am pleased to report that we have reached 
agreement with the loan note holders for 
50 per cent of this loan to be converted into 
shares and for the balance of 50 per cent 
to remain in the loan note instrument with 
the maturity date extending to 31 October 
2013 and the coupon changing to 7.5 per 
cent. I am also pleased to report a successful 
placing which will raise $2.8m to be used 
as working capital for the group to support 
expansion of the business in new markets, 
particularly eBooks.
 
Chairman’s Statement

Ian Stewart, Non-Executive director of the 
company, announced his decision to step 
down from the board of directors with effect 
from 31 December 2010 to concentrate 
on his other business interests. The board 
would like to thank Ian, who had been with 
ZOO since inception, for his dedication and 
commitment to the group, and he takes 
with him our very best wishes for the future.
ZOO’s products and services are highly 
relevant to companies in all industries where 
there is a need to maintain the quality and 
brand integrity of creative digital content. 
ZOO’s customers are therefore typically 
large, multi-national organisations whose 
brands are recognised internationally and 
whose names signify a level of quality that 
the companies need to protect. The progress 
we have made this year in winning new 
customers for our software tools outside the 
filmed entertainment sector, and in 
extending our relationships with existing 
customers, stems directly from the quality 
and commitment of our  staff in the US and 
the UK; the board is therefore confident in 
the future success of the group.

 03 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
summaRy The year saw the Company 
making steady progress. While 
we incurred a loss for the year 
ended 31 March 2010, the board 
believe that the work done in the 
year has laid the foundation for 
growth in future periods. This 
has subsequently been seen in 
the first few months of the year 
ending 31 March 2011, during 
which we have registered year 
on year growth of over 30% 
per annum. In the collateral 
management software business 
we continued to win contracts 
and grow organically, while 
implementation at the major Tier 1 
Continental European bank 
announced in April 2009 
progressed through the year 
and resulted in acceptance in 
April 2010. In the regulatory 
compliance business a lot of 
work was performed ahead 
of the major new UK Financial 
Services Authority (“FSA”) 
regulations on Liquidity 
Standards, which have provided 
a major revenue opportunity; 
however since these regulations 
were finalised later than expected, 
in October 2009, and software 
was not ready until April 2010, 
the revenue recognised in the 
year ending 31 March 2010 
was negligible. During the year 
we raised equity funds that 
eliminated all our borrowings 
and strengthened our balance 
sheet. In the post-financial crisis 
environment in which customers 
and investors are more risk averse 
than usual, these were all events 
that took us in the right direction.
Revenues for the year increased 
by 3% to £8.95m (2009: £8.69m). 
Our loss after tax was £1.58m 
(2009: £1.16m) but this included 
£0.11m of interest and, following 
a thorough review of revenue, one 
time provision in respect of bad debts 
from previous periods of £0.18m.
We invested heavily in resource 
for COLLINE
®
 during the year, 
although much of that investment 
was to support a major contract 
and other large contracts. The 
Risk and Trading business traded 
profitably, so that more than 
100% of the loss was in the 
Regulatory Compliance business 
which represented 47% of 
revenues. The weakness in the 
regulatory business in the first 
half was expected as few final 
decisions were being taken by UK 
regulatory customers before the 
FSA had finalised its policy on 
liquidity, and the weakness in the 
second half was primarily an issue 
of revenue recognition owing to 
the extended regulatory deadlines. 
An appreciable number of 
contracts were won during 
the second half, but the revenue 
will be recognised in the year 
ending 31 March 2011.
In the post-crisis international 
financial environment, there is 
a move away from a light touch 
regulatory regime in the UK and 
in many other countries, and there 
is little if any sign of this changing 
following the change of UK 
Government. In the UK this 
began with a complete reform 
of Liquidity Reporting and the 
board believes that this move away 
from light touch regulation offers

summaRy COntinued considerable opportunity to the 
Company in the coming years. 
As well as the Liquidity Standards 
announced by the FSA, new FSA 
policy statements on Stress Testing 
have been published and FSA 
consultation papers have been 
published about Capital Standards 
which are likely to lead to more 
regulatory change in 2011 and 
2012. There are considerable 
regulatory opportunities in all the 
countries in which the Company 
operates, with world regulators 
seemingly close to an agreement 
on a “Basel 3” capital regime.
The Board considers that the 
outlook for our COLLINE
®
 collateral 
management software remains 
promising with strong new 
business demand expected 
to continue, including switching 
away from competitor systems 
to COLLINE
®
 together with likely 
revenue growth from existing 
customers. The Company has now 
proved the scalability and resilience 
of the product (i.e. its ability to 
cope with large volumes and to 
withstand the loss of individual 
servers without ceasing to 
function) through its deployment 
in a leading Tier 1 Continental 
European bank operating in 
an international environment. 
Given that most of our revenues 
come from banks and financial 
services companies, the Board 
considers that the Company’s 
products are well placed with an 
emphasis on collateral management, 
liquidity and regulatory compliance. 
We are the global number 2 in 
both collateral management 
software and in bank regulatory 
reporting software.
finanCial Revenues for the year increased 
by 3% to £8.95m (2009: £8.69m). 
Our loss after tax was £1.58m

following a thorough review. 
Stripping out these items would 
have shown a reduced underlying 
loss of £1.3m and an adjusted cost 
base of £10.2m for the year. Net 
cash was £0.7m at 31 March 2010 
(2009: £0.15m less £1.33m of 
director loans).

As anticipated in former statements, 
the financial crisis has been 
beneficial for our COLLINE
®
 
collateral management software 
product. This product now 
handles substantially all of the 
key requirements of a collateral 
business including margining, 
repo and securities lending, 
trade reconciliation, inventory 
management and reporting 
including regulatory reporting 
(e.g. for Fed-15 reports and 
outputs to regulatory liquidity 
reporting). During the year we 
completed projects with Loomis, 
Sayles & Co, Pacific Life, ABN-
AMRO and began a project with 
BNP Paribas Securities Services. 
We also made good progress 
with implementation of a major 
contract with a Tier 1 Continental 
European bank concluded at the 
end of the financial year ended 
31 March 2009, and have 
demonstrated COLLINE
®
’s 
scalability, resilience and 
performance in that bank’s own 
environment using active-active 
clustering in multiple data centres, 
user locations in three continents 
and well over 150 users. This 
means that the Board has every 
confidence that our solution is 
scalable from the smallest collateral 
user to the largest global bank. 
Oberon
®
, our most established 
product, continues to move 
forward with functional and 
performance enhancements 
and remains profitable. 
During the year we launched our 
LISA
®
 product and we have now 
signed up several new customers 
for it. LISA
®
 will be a risk product 
which is complementary to our 
regulatory products, starting with 
Liquidity Risk and using the most 
modern technology. Lombard Risk 
has always been strong on risk 
management and the Board 
considers that the convergence 
of risk and regulation plays 
to our strengths.
RegulatORy and COmplianCe 
sOftwaRe pROduCts Lombard Risk is the market leader 
for UK Bank regulatory reporting 
with approximately 130 of 
the 350 banks in the UK and 
approximately 15 investment firms 
in the UK using the STB-Reporter 
product for regulatory reporting 
to the FSA. 
This depth of customer base clearly 
gives the Company opportunities 
to sell additional functionality 
to existing customers. When the 
announcement of new regulations 
is imminent there tends to be a lull 
in activity before those regulations 
are actually finalised and this was 
the case during the year with the 
FSA ’s final new regulations on 
Liquidity Reporting and Liquidity 
Stress Testing not being published 
until October 2009. Consequently 
there was very little revenue in the 
period under review from this 
source except from analysis work 
on the impact of the consultation 
papers. The Company has now won 
The financial highlight of the 
period was the raising of £2.83m 
of equity, of which £1.75m was 
from institutions and investors on 
AIM, and the balance of £1.08m 
was in either new money or loan 
conversions from Directors and 
former Directors. After deduction 
of fees and expenses of around 
£0.2m, this allowed the Company 
to repay all its Director loans of 
£1.63m and its overdraft, reduce 
its creditors to a lower number 
of creditor days, as well as retain 
a reserve for working capital.
Recurrent revenue has historically 
been a healthy proportion of 
revenues at the Company. Recurrent 
annual revenues for the Group were 
at around £4.4m p.a at the year 
end (2009: £4.3m). In addition, 
the revenue profile remains fairly 
well spread. This recurrent number 
has continued to grow during the 
current financial period and as 
a result of contracts already won, 
the Board expects this to grow 
throughout the remainder of the 
current period.

sOftwaRe pROduCts COntinued 30 contracts related to this initiative 
for Liquidity Reporting or Liquidity 
Stress Testing, and is very busy 
rolling out the solution to these 
customers in the current financial 
year. The FSA has also ended up 
changing its originally stated plans 
to subject all foreign bank branches 
to UK Liquidity Reporting, and many 
such firms were able to negotiate 
modifications/waivers to these rules. 
The Liquidity Reporting and Stress 
Testing regulatory regime which 
comes into effect in the UK in 
2010 seems likely to be followed 
in 2011 by new Capital Standards 
and Stress Testing and there is a 
timetable for regulatory change 
including a new “Basel 3” accord. 
This opportunity is by no means 
confined to the UK, although the 
Board believes that the weight of 
our customer base gives us more 
ability to leverage the opportunity 
in the UK than elsewhere.
The Board considers that the 
Company’s ability to offer global 
solutions has been greatly enhanced 
through our now having regulatory 
offerings available or under 
production for several EMEA 
and Asian countries as well as 
the United States. Our Singapore 
office made a number of worthwhile 
product wins including business 
in Singapore, won away from our 
main competitor, and we obtained 
our first two customers for 
Japanese reporting. 
peRsOnnel and pRemises
During the period under review 
we continued to make new hires 
appropriate to the expected 
growth of parts of the business 
but we also benefited from cost 
actions taken before the financial 
year end. We continue to take 
actions designed to establish 
profitability in all parts of the 
business and to re-allocate 
resources to those parts of the 
business where we see the best 
prospects. The Board intends that 
costs will continue to be contained 
overall and that they are reduced 
as a percentage of any revenue 
rises as proportionately more work 
is carried out in Shanghai and 
we achieve greater efficiency gains. 
We now have more than half of 
our Group headcount in Shanghai.
I agreed to split my combined 
Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer role at the time of the 
institutional fund-raising, and 
the Board and I were delighted 
to welcome Philip Crawford as 
our  new Non-executive Chairman 
from 1 May 2010. At the same 
time Mike Shinya joined as a 
Non-executive Director. Both Philip 
and Mike have very heavyweight 
experience as senior executives in 
the IT industry at large companies 
such as EDS and Oracle and their 
experience will help take the 
Company forward to the next level. 
While so many people worked 
hard during the year, special 
thanks are due to the teams 
in London and Shanghai led by 
Nick Davies and Helen Bramley 
who did so much to ensure the 
success of major Colline projects. 
Many late nights were worked 
by many to ensure that 
deadlines were met. 
At Board level special thanks 
are due to Ian Peacock, our 
Non-executive Deputy Chairman, 
who retires at the AGM. Ian has 
been with the Company for over 
ten years in various capacities 
and I have always valued his wise 
counsel and incisive questioning 
over that time. Thanks are also 
due to Chris Langridge who 
joined us in April as COO and 
Finance Director to help us 
with some of our strategic 
initiatives including cost cutting. 
Chris will not be standing for 
re-election at the AGM and 
a permanent replacement 
will be announced shortly.

pROspeCts The Group has seen more than 
30% year on year revenue growth 
in the first four months of the 
current financial year, and taking 
into account recurrent revenue 
and the contracted revenues which 
the Board believes should be 
recognisable by 31 March 2011, 
this is a promising start to the new 
financial year. We continue to see 
a healthy sales pipeline for our 
COLLINE
®
 collateral management 
software following the substantial 
Tier 1 Continental European bank 
going live. In addition, the Board 
believes that some of the new 
regulatory driven industry initiatives 
on central counterparty and 
messaging should help us win 
additional business. In addition 
the Board foresees no end to the 
increase in bank and securities 
firm regulation, and is optimistic 
that this will have a positive 
effect on the Group’s regulatory 
compliance business, albeit that 
this benefit will continue to come 
in waves with peaks and troughs 
in demand around regulatory 
deadlines. The climate for the 
next few years is for mandatory 
additional spend on regulation. 
The key issue for us is what share 
of this spend the Group can achieve 
and the scale of investment required 
to make this a major international 
profit opportunity for us, rather 
than whether that opportunity exists. 
In this changing environment the 
Board continues to believe that, 
as changes in legislation are 
adopted and credit risk and 
liquidity risk management are ever 
more tightly controlled, risk and 
regulatory software will be in 
demand. Lombard Risk, as

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND 
ECONOMIC IMPACT
While it is impossible to understate the impact of the global 
recession on businesses generally, there is little doubt 
that the downturn can present marketers with significant 
opportunities to improve their media and marketing 
performance. 
Media prices have been tumbling across the world as 
reduced budgets have led to contracting demand 
for advertising in most categories. The good news for 
advertisers is that they can achieve real cost savings in 
most markets.
Yet paradoxically, despite falling media prices, media and 
marketing planning has never been more complex and the 
opportunities for inefficiencies and waste never greater. It is 
this paradox that has led to advertisers demanding greater 
discipline in understanding the real return they can achieve 
for their media and marketing spend. It is this dynamic that 
is fuelling the growth of our Analytics business as more and 
more advertisers turn to us for advice and counsel. With 
the UK’s largest media database and real time insights 
into media and market changes, we are frequently best 
equipped to provide clear independent advice.
Whilst our Analytics business has perhaps benefited from our 
clients placing a higher than usual emphasis on ensuring 
maximum media and marketing effectiveness and stronger 
return on their marketing investment, other parts of our 
business have performed less well.
Our advertising monitoring business has suffered from 
a negative impact on renewals as a result of many 
clients cutting advertising spend, increased corporate 
consolidations reducing available contracts and an ailing 
car industry.  As a result renewal levels for the year have 
reduced to 84% (2008: 92%), which although someway 
behind what we expected this time last year remains 
reasonably good with continuing strength particularly 
coming from the retail sector where swift reaction to a 
competitor’s activity remains a key business driver. 
OUTLOOK
The coming year will continue to be difficult economically 
and we will continue to take whatever measures are 
necessary to ensure we emerge from this recession even 
stronger than before.
Our priority is to continue to build a strong, growing and 
sustainable revenue stream by developing more ways 
to help our clients. To achieve this, however, will require 
investments that, in the short term at least, will result in some 
margin depression.
Having said this, we have much to feel positive about:
•	 Our	market	position	is	one	with	significant	customer	
traction and relevance to these economic times as 
companies seek greater insights into their media and 
marketing performance;
•	 W e	have	a	str ong	balance	sheet	and	our	ability	to	
generate cash will see it strengthening even further in 
the coming year;
•	 W e	have	taken	car eful	steps	to	invest	in	our	futur e	
with the potential to generate new revenue streams, 
particularly overseas; 
•	 Over	the	medium	ter m	we	anticipate	that	we	will	be	in	
a position to strengthen our margins significantly as our 
business begins to scale.
Overall, therefore, we have many reasons to remain 
positive about our future prospects.

Ebiquity plc is publishing its final results for the year ended 30 April 2009.  
REVENUE
2009 2008
£’000 £’000
Analytics 12,786 11,310
Platform 5,633 5,910
Total Revenue 18,419 17,220
Since last year’s Annual Report, our “Consulting Services” division has been renamed “Analytics” (and consists of our marketing effectiveness 
and media auditing and consultancy practices) and our “Technology & Data” division as “Platform” (which consists of advertising and 
editorial monitoring and our ePublisher business). 
Total Group revenue increased by 7% to £18.4 million (2008: £17.2 million).  This growth was driven by the Analytics division where revenue 
increased by 13% to £12.8 million, and now represents 69% of total Group revenue (2008: 66%). Within this division, revenue from international 
audit assignments (defined as non UK sourced revenue, or UK sourced revenue where marketing activity is analysed in more than one 
country) grew by 36% to £6.1 million.
Revenue from the smaller Platform division was down 5%.  This was in part due to a softening in the renewal rate (by value) to 84% (2008: 
92%) and also due to a slow down in new sales of our advertising monitoring platform.  Newslive 2.0, our newly launched editorial monitoring 
platform, has seen some sales traction, but these sales are not at this stage significant enough to make a notable impact on the division’s 
revenue performance. 
GROSS PROFIT
Gross profit for the period was up 9% to £9.8 million (2008: £9.0 million), yielding an improved gross margin of 53% (2008: 52%).  
The Analytics gross profit has improved from £5.5 million to £6.9 million, with margins increasing from 49% to 54%.  The margin increase 
principally reflects the uplift in revenues, together with tight control of data costs, offset by some increase in headcount. 
The Platform gross profit has reduced from £3.4 million to £3.0 million, with margins decreasing from 58% to 53%.  The margin decrease reflects 
the fall in revenue driven by our advertising monitoring platform (down £277,000), together with investment in staff and production costs 
primarily to service the launch of Newslive 2.0 (up £147,000).
OPERATING PROFIT
Profit before highlighted items is termed “underlying operating profit”.  Certain items have been highlighted because separate disclosure is 
considered relevant in understanding the underlying performance of the business.  
2009 2008
£’000 £’000
Analytics 3,241 1,857
Platform (355) 419
Central costs (523) (259)
Underlying operating profit 2,363 2,017
Highlighted items (933) (3,140)
Reported operating profit/(loss) 1,430 (1,123)
Underlying operating profit was £2.4 million (2008: £2.0 million), representing a 17% increase over the prior year.  The reported operating result 
has seen a turnaround to a profit of £1.4 million (2008: £1.1 million loss).
Our Analytics division has continued to perform well with increased revenues from a well managed cost base.  At the gross profit level, we 
have seen an increase of £1,311,000 as explained above.  Administrative expenses have decreased by £75,000, primarily as a result of a 
decrease in central overhead allocations and a movement in foreign exchange gains.

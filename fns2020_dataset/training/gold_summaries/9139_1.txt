REVENUE PROFIT BEFORE TAX
John Dodds | Chief Executive
I am pleased to report another year of increased 
underlying profits for Kier Group for the year ended 
30 June 2008. Despite the very difficult market 
conditions facing our Homes business the Group has 
achieved record levels of revenue and underlying 
pre-tax profit for the year to 30 June 2008. This 
has been driven by our Construction and Support 
Services businesses; each of them achieving new 
records of revenue and profits underpinned by higher 
quality contracts achieved through an increase in 
frameworks, negotiated and partnered work.
Overview
Our Homes division sold 1,438 homes in the year; 
18.6% fewer than last year’s 1,767 homes with the 
credit crunch having a significant impact on the 
second half of the financial year resulting in 35% 
fewer unit sales than in the same period in the 
previous year.
In Property we secured a number of development 
sales in the early part of the year which maintained 
our profits for 2008 at similar levels to the previous 
year. In our Infrastructure Investment business we 
sold our 50% PFI investment in the Hairmyres 
District General Hospital project in Scotland, 
Kier’s first ever PFI contract. The sale completed in 
February 2008 and contributed a profit of £16.2m 
in the year. The value attributed to the equity sold 
implies a net present value calculated using an 
average discount rate of less than five per cent.
Conditions in the housing market have continued 
to deteriorate and we have responded to this by 
reorganising our Homes division; our overhead 
costs have been reduced and we have aligned it 
more closely with our Partnership Homes business 
to focus on regeneration and affordable housing 
opportunities. We have incurred exceptional 
restructuring charges of £9.5m against profits for the 
year largely representing redundancy and severance 
payments to around 60% of our Homes workforce. 
We have also examined the carrying values of our 
Homes and Property land and work in progress, 
in the light of current market conditions, and have 
written down certain sites and properties by a 
total of £31.3m; £26.6m in our Homes business, 
including £1.0m relating to aborted land purchases; 
and £4.7m in our Property business. Our priority 
continues to be to reduce our investment in work 
in progress and we have reinforced our controls 
over build expenditure and are limiting our land 
expenditure to settling land creditors, committed 
payments and exercising options where appropriate.
Our Construction and Support Services businesses 
have seen steady demand throughout the year. We 
have continued to focus on long-term relationships 
and have successfully extended our range of 
long-term framework agreements, partnership 
programmes and negotiated and repeat business 
both in the public and private sectors. In the UK 
construction market, education has continued to 
provide us with plenty of opportunity, much of it

2  As part of our five-year infrastructure 
framework for the renewal of rail 
structures for Network Rail in East 
Anglia, Kier Construction successfully, 
and in record time, completed the Ely 
rail bridge replacement in December 
2007 following a derailment in June. 
Kier Engineering Services provided 
design engineering services.  
www.kier.co.uk/transport/projects
through the Academies Framework and frameworks 
with local authorities. Overseas, our markets in 
the Middle East are buoyant and we have secured 
£150m of new infrastructure projects in Dubai and 
continue to explore expansion opportunities in that 
region. In Support Services our order books have 
grown significantly reflecting both new contract 
awards and the expansion of existing contracts. 
These awards contributed strongly to record 
combined forward order books for Construction and 
Support Services providing us with good visibility of 
revenue for a number of years.
Financial performance
Revenue for the year at £2,374.2m (2007: £2,127.9m) 
was 11.6% ahead of last year with very strong 
growth from both the Construction and Support 
Services divisions. Underlying operating profit was 
7.6% ahead of last year at £83.8m (2007: £77.9m) 
before taking into account the following 
exceptional items:

Profit on the sale of our 50% investment in 
Hairmyres Hospital (PFI) 16.2
Redundancy and reorganisation costs 
associated with our Homes division (9.5)
Provisions against land and work in progress:
 Homes (26.6)
 Property (4.7)
Total exceptional items (24.6)
Underlying profit before tax increased by 12.2% to 
£87.1m (2007: £77.6m) before exceptional items. 
Adjusted earnings per share, before the amortisation 
of intangible assets and exceptional items, increased 
by 10.0% to 174.8p (2007: 158.9p).
This strong trading performance was supported by 
a good cash performance in the year with £56.6m 
generated from operating activities (2007: £114.8m) 
resulting in a year-end net cash position of £143.9m 
(2007: £148.4m). The Construction division 
generated £52.5m of cash (after tax and intra-Group 
dividends) reflecting continued strong trading 
performance and ended the year with another 
record cash balance of £413.7m (2007: £361.2m). 
In Homes our investment in land and work in 
progress continued to climb as the number of unit 
sales planned for the year reduced, absorbing some 
of our Group cash.
Group structure and strategic developments
For the year to 30 June 2008 Kier Group comprised 
five divisions: Construction, Support Services, 
Homes, Property and Infrastructure Investment. 
The Group’s management structure and segmental 
analysis for reporting purposes are based on the 
five divisions.
The benefits of operating a hybrid model have 
been particularly highlighted this year as the four 
principal legs of our business experience different 
market fundamentals. Continued demand in our 
Construction and Support Services businesses has 
contrasted with the sudden and dramatic effect of 
the credit crunch on the demand for private housing 
and development properties.
In response to the reduction in demand for housing 
we have consolidated the operations of Allison 
Homes, Bellwinch Homes, Kier Homes Scotland, 
Kier Homes Northern and Twigden, into one, Kier 
Homes, at our head office in Sandy, Bedfordshire. 
Regrettably this has resulted in around a 60% 
reduction in our Homes workforce but will provide 
us with considerable annual overhead savings.
We have also brought Kier Homes and our 
affordable homes business, Kier Partnership Homes, 
closer together under one Board director with a 
remit to further develop the Group’s activities in 
the affordable housing and regeneration arena. The 
affordable housing sector is one with potential for 
growth in revenue and profit streams for the Group 
in the coming years in response to the government’s 
commitment to major public spending on affordable 
homes and regeneration.
Our Property division and Infrastructure Investment 
division now operate under one Board director 
together with a new business stream, Kier Asset 
Partnership Services, established to focus on local 
authority asset management and development.
These changes, which are reflected in our new 
management structure, are designed to bring the 
Group’s operations closer together and provide 
increased efficiencies. Construction

Overall revenue increased by 17.1% to a record 
£1,653.2m for the year (2007: £1,411.2m) with 
good growth in both Kier Regional and Kier 
Construction. Operating profit increased by 74.9% 
to £38.3m (2007: £21.9m) and the operating margin 
increased from 1.6% last year to 2.3%, well ahead 
of our target for this division in 2008.
Cash generation, one of our key construction 
performance measures, has been extremely strong 
again this year, with cash balances at 30 June 2008 
£52.5m higher than the previous year-end (after tax 
and intra-Group dividends) and average balances 
for the year £59m ahead at £378m. Contract awards 
were strong giving an order book at 30 June 2008 of 
£1,700m (2007: £1,710m).
Kier Regional business review
The performance of our Kier Regional businesses 
was excellent reflecting the high-quality order 
books carried forward at the beginning of 
the financial year, and we achieved further 
advancement in our key performance measures of 
revenue, profit margins and cash balances. Revenue 
was 16.8% ahead of 2007 at £1,413.2m; profit 
margins, supported by an increased proportion of 
negotiated and partnered work, again increased; 
and the cash performance has been strong with 
average cash balances around £54m higher than 
last year, ending the year at another record of 
£377m (2007: £336m).
The level of awards achieved through framework 
and partnership agreements together with 
negotiated and two-stage tenders, grew to around 
80% of the total work secured in the year (2007: 64%) 
and, together with the low average value of our 
contracts at £4.7m (2007: £4.7m), they continue 
to provide us with a high-quality, sustainable order 
book with an attractive risk profile.
The Construction division 
comprises Kier Regional and 
Kier Construction. Kier Regional 
encompasses our ten regional 
contracting businesses, major 
building projects and, for the year 
to 30 June 2008, our affordable 
housing contracting business. 
Kier Construction represents 
the Group’s infrastructure and 
overseas operations which 
include civil engineering, 
infrastructure, rail, mining and 
remediation capabilities.

AWARDS BY SECTOR
1  Kier North West undertook the 
construction of the flagship  
BDP headquarters building at 
Piccadilly Basin, Manchester. This 
striking five-storey, 31,450sq ft 
office building achieved the much 
coveted BREEAM Excellent rating for 
environmental sustainability. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 9
Forty-nine per cent of our total awards arose from 
private sector clients (2007: 55%) and 51% from 
the public sector (2007: 45%). In the private sector 
commercial property, retail and hotel & leisure 
projects provided a good spread of work and in 
the public sector 64% of our awards were through 
framework agreements largely for education, prison 
and healthcare projects.
Demand for commercial property continued to 
be strong again this year representing 22% of our 
awards, partly through Kier Property projects as well 
as awards through our long-term relationships with 
Land Securities Trillium, British Land, Goodman and 
SEGRO. The retail market continued to be buoyant, 
particularly for food retailers, representing around 
11% of our awards largely through our framework 
agreements and partnerships with Tesco, Sainsbury’s 
and Morrisons. During the year we were also 
appointed by BAA plc as one of its commodity build 
framework contractors aimed at delivering a total 
of £650m of projects over five years, including car 
parks, refurbishment works and asset renewals  
at Heathrow, Gatwick and a number of other  
UK airports. 
In the public sector education continues to be 
buoyant with orders this year representing 28% of 
total awards, largely through framework agreements 
and partnerships with government, local authorities 
and individual universities. Our involvement in 
the Contractors’ Framework for Academies and 
Other Educational Facilities is beginning to deliver 
work, with the award of the £27m Milton Keynes 
Academy during the year and several further awards 
imminent. We have also secured the first contract 
through the Primary Capital Investment Programme 
for the London Borough of Barnet.
Local authority frameworks continue to provide us 
with a significant volume of work in the education 
sector including the Improvement and Efficiency 
South East (IESE) partnership of councils in the 
south and south-east of England, our partnership 
agreement with South Lanarkshire Council and 
multiple local authority frameworks with various 
councils across the country. A great success in 
the year was being appointed preferred bidder by 
Kent County Council, as part of the Land Securities 
Trillium consortium, to deliver £100m worth of 
schools in the first wave of Kent’s Building Schools 
for the Future (BSF) programme with the opportunity 
for a further £150m of work in future waves.
Health projects represented 8% of our awards in the 
year. The seven-year NHS ProCure 21 procurement 
framework, of which we are a part, entered its 
fifth year and has provided us with £326m worth 
of healthcare work to date including 21 projects 
awarded this year with a combined value of £96m. 
New construction, extensions and refurbishment 
work at prisons for the Ministry of Justice Custodial 
Properties’ Framework has continued to provide 
a good level of activity representing around 7% 
of total awards in the year. We delivered over 850 
prison spaces during the year and are progressing 
with a further 486 places.
In the affordable housing sector we completed 
723 affordable housing units (2007: 850 units) 
and were awarded approximately £125m of new 
contracts (2007: £98m) including a £20m scheme 
in Birmingham. This sector has the potential to 
increase markedly on the back of the government’s 
committed investment of £8bn to provide 70,000 
affordable homes per annum by 2010.

Kier Construction business review
Kier Construction saw a 19.0% increase in its 
revenue in the year to £240.0m (2007: £201.3m) 
through a combination of projects in the rail, 
energy and water sectors, our opencast coal 
mining business in Scotland and overseas projects, 
particularly in Dubai and Romania.
The energy sector continues to provide us with 
good opportunities. During the year we successfully 
completed our work to a major Liquefied Natural 
Gas (LNG) receiving terminal at South Hook in 
Milford Haven. Good progress was made on two 
new Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power 
stations at the Langage Energy Centre, Plymouth 
for Alstom Power and at Immingham CCGT power 
station on the Humber. These projects add to our 
considerable experience gained in successfully 
completing similar works on 12 other CCGT power 
stations over the past ten years.
At our privately owned opencast coal mine, 
Greenburn in East Ayrshire, we have now extracted 
2.6m tonnes of coal since production began in 
2004. We expect to continue mining here until 
2013 and have forward sold 70% of the  
remaining 2.0m tonnes of anticipated coal  
at favourable prices.
As part of our five-year infrastructure framework 
for the renewal of rail structures for Network Rail 
in East Anglia, we successfully, and in record time, 
completed a rail bridge replacement project at 
Ely in December 2007 following a freight train 
derailment in June 2007 which caused extensive 
damage to the existing 140-year-old structure.
Overseas, our markets in the Middle East are 
buoyant. We have secured £150m of new 
infrastructure projects in Dubai and continue to 
explore expansion opportunities in that region. In 
Saudi Arabia we are establishing a new phosphate 
mine development in joint venture with our local 
partners and we start mining in 2009 for a period of 
eight years. In Romania we have had a busy year on 
water infrastructure projects as well as major retail 
and residential schemes. In the Caribbean we have 
completed our successful work on the transport 
interchange in Kingston, Jamaica and the Norman 
Manley airport extension is nearing completion.
Construction markets and outlook
Our framework agreements in both the public and 
private sectors continue to provide us with a steady 
stream of work which will help to safeguard us 
from uncertainties in the commercial property and 
private residential construction markets. We were

under the Academies framework during the summer

with a potential to negotiate a further similar size 
academy at Kings Lynn, and we are preferred bidder 
on the £18m Samworth Academy in Mansfield 
and One School Pathfinder Projects in Shropshire 
(£25m), the Wirral (£23m) and Sefton (£42m).  
We are also bidding for a further £200m of  
similar education opportunities.
We are one of three contractors chosen by Argent 
for their £2bn central framework contract at King’s 
Cross, which includes around 8.0m sq ft of mixed-
use development over a 10 to 15-year period.
In the energy sector our track record continues to 
provide us with more work and we were delighted 
to be awarded a £95m contract to provide civil 
engineering works for a 1,200MW CCGT power 
station at West Burton, Nottingham for EDF Energy. 
Opportunities also exist in the waste sector and 
we are preferred bidder on a waste treatment plant 
in Wakefield for VT. In the nuclear sector we have 
been selected by AWE as one of two contractors 
to develop a portfolio of work valued at £200m at 
Aldermaston. We are expanding our presence in 
Dubai as significant opportunities come forward 
in the infrastructure and drainage sector where we 
have a long track record.
We enter the new financial year with strong 
construction order books of £1,700m (2007: £1,710m) 
and a healthy pipeline of ‘probable’ awards. 
Frameworks and long-term partnerships will help 
to insulate us from longer-term uncertainty in the 
construction market and together with our wide 
geographic coverage and low average contract 
size we can view our construction marketplace  
with confidence. Support Services

Support Services business review
Revenue in Support Services rose 24.8% to 
£393.7m (2007: £315.5m). Operating profit, before 
deducting the amortisation of intangibles of £2.1m, 
increased by 27.9% to £15.6m (2007: £12.2m) at 
an improved margin of 4.0% (2007: 3.9%) in line 
with our target for the year.
Once again, the cash position within the division 
was strong with £1.6m generated to give year-end 
cash balances of £17.4m (2007: £15.8m) which 
includes our investment in plant of £21.1m. The 
order books have grown significantly standing 
at £2,023m at 30 June 2008 (2007: £1,788m), 
reflecting both new contract awards and the 
expansion of existing contracts.
The largest and fastest growing business is Kier 
Building Maintenance, with revenue in the year 
up 33.4% to £288.7m (2007: £216.4m). New 
contracts worth £460m were secured during the 
year including Newham, Hammersmith & Fulham 
and Stoke-on-Trent. The Stoke contract was awarded 
in February 2008, in partnership with Stoke-on-
Trent City Council, to maintain its 20,000 housing 
stock and carry out works through the Decent 
Homes programme. This contract provides us with 
annual revenue of £40m for ten years, extendable 
for a further five years. It also provides a great 
opportunity to attract additional work both through 
the contract and through third-party projects using 
the resources available in the partnership. In June 
we were awarded a contract with East Durham 
Homes to carry out planned maintenance and 
adaptation work on their 8,800 homes in Peterlee, 
County Durham. This contract will provide revenues 
of £5.5m per annum over four years and brings the 
total number of public sector homes we look after 
in England to 220,000.
A major challenge in the north during the first part 
of the year was our response to the devastating 
flooding that struck Yorkshire and Humberside 
in June 2007 which saw our Hull, Sheffield and 
Leeds Building Maintenance teams providing 
emergency repairs and maintenance and the 
subsequent clearing-up operations. Kier Sheffield

revenue generator at £111.5m (2007: £107.1m) 
and continues to expand with regional housing 
association work and capital works for Sheffield 
education department, including completing 
the build of the new Sharrow School in 
September 2007.
In the south, Kier Islington continues its efficiency 
improvements including co-locating its client 
services with the council’s as well as setting up 
a single resolution team with the council to deal 
with any customer complaints. Work commenced 
with Harrow Council on 1 July 2007 to undertake 
a full range of responsive maintenance and Decent 
Homes upgrades. Worth £125m over five years, 
this gives us the opportunity to provide additional 
capital projects, such as building schools and a 
leisure centre, with £60m of such work already 
secured and being carried out by Kier Regional. In 
Harlow, an award in February 2007 and one which 
includes Kier Street Services, improvements have 
been made to the service which is now rated ‘good’ 
compared with the ‘poor’ rating in 2004.
After a period of consolidation, Kier Managed 
Services has won three significant new contracts this 
year. In Northampton we are to provide facilities 
management services and lifecycle replacement 
for a PFI scheme for the provision of mental health 
services to Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Trust. 
At the University of Glamorgan, where we have 
provided facilities management services for over ten 
years, we won the contract to provide full facilities 
management services for the newly built campus for 
the Cardiff School of Creative & Cultural Industries. 
We also secured a £7.0m per annum facilities 
contract for Legal & General during the year.
We have had a strong year in Kier Plant and have 
continued our investment in upgrading our fleet. 
This has included the purchase of eight new tower 
cranes, bringing the inventory to 102 such cranes, 
a 70-tonne crawler crane, 26 new telehandlers and 
710 new site accommodation units, including our 
own trademarked Green Space and Green Step 
 eco-cabins, bringing our holding to 3,600 units.
Support Services markets and outlook
There are continuing opportunities both with local 
authorities and the private sector for our Managed 
Services business.
In Building Maintenance our order book gives us 
long-term visible earnings at consistent margins 
extending beyond 2017. The long-term contracts 
and relationships allow us to expand our activities 
through organic growth and provide opportunity for 
other Kier businesses to participate. There is a strong 
pipeline of new contracts to bid including a £40m 
per annum ten-year contract for North Tyneside on 
which we are shortlisted as one of two bidders.
We have a strong track record of delivery on  
high-value building maintenance contracts which 
places us in an excellent position when tendering 
for large contracts.

Conditions in the housing market started reasonably 
well for the first half of the year but we experienced 
a significant downturn in demand for houses as we 
entered the second half of the year initially caused 
by a reduction in mortgage availability and the 
tightening up of mortgage terms.The market continued 
to deteriorate during the last quarter of the year with 
reservations rates falling significantly year-on-year. 
Despite this, Kier Residential sold 1,438 homes in the 
year (2007: 1,767 homes) representing a fall of 18.6% 
over the entire year compared with last year. We sold 
827 units in the first half of the financial year (2007: 
819 units) and 611 units in the second half, 35% fewer 
than the second half of the previous financial year.

low-rise. Nevertheless our work in progress has 
increased and we are focused on reducing our 
stock swiftly given the current market conditions.
Homes markets and outlook
We are very cautious on the outlook for 2009 
hence our actions to reduce our cost base. Gross 
reservations for the first two months of the new 
financial year are around 76% below the same 
period last year reflecting continued tightening 
of mortgage availability and a general slow down 
in demand hence our order books at 31 August 
contain 49% fewer units than at the same time 
last year.
We have reinforced our controls over build 
expenditure and work in progress and have 
limited land expenditure to settling land creditors, 
committed payments and exercising options until 
the outlook for the housing market becomes clearer.

Average selling prices were lower for the year 
at £168,800 (2007: £179,300) reflecting a 
higher proportion of the lower value Kier Homes 
Northern properties, an increased proportion of 
social housing units than the previous year (18% 
compared with 16% in 2007) as well as some price 
discounting. Revenue of £242.8m was generated 
from housing sales (2007: £316.8m) and there were 
no land disposals (2007: revenue of £8.3m from 
land sales). Operating profit from housing sales 
declined by 36.0% to £30.5m (2007: £47.6m) at a 
reduced margin of 12.6% (2007: 15.0%).
We incurred exceptional costs of £9.5m relating to 
redundancy and reorganisation which will reduce 
our costs by £17m on an annual basis. We have also 
examined the carrying values of our land and work 
in progress and have written down land values by 
£25.6m together with a further £1.0m relating to 
aborted land purchases, representing 5.7% of our 
residential land and work in progress.
During the year £88.2m was spent on selective land 
purchases (2007: £87.5m) and at 30 June 2008 the 
land bank contained 6,233 units (2007: 6,465 units). 
In addition to land with planning consent,  
we hold approximately 12,000 plots of strategic 
land (2007: 11,500 plots) mostly under option.
Our sites are principally located outside major 
cities and exclude high-rise flats. In Lincolnshire, 
Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire our sites are 
principally greenfield housing developments. In the

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW PROPERTY CONTINUED
Property business review
Despite tough market conditions the Property 
division recorded another successful and profitable 
year. Revenue increased from £61.3m last year 
to £69.6m with operating profit, before property 
write-downs, at similar levels to last year of £12.0m 
(2007: £12.1m) representing a margin of 17.2% 
(2007: 19.7%). The commercial property market is 
more difficult than we have seen for some time with 
exit yields shifting upwards and occupiers taking 
time to make decisions. Consequently we have 
examined the carrying values of our developments 
and work in progress and have made exceptional 
provisions against the values amounting to £4.7m, 
representing 4.8% of the book value of our 
developments, predominantly against properties 
acquired in the last two years.
Notable sales during the year included the 
150,000sq ft business park headquarters for 
Electronic Data Systems in Milton Keynes, 
constructed by Kier Regional and sold to Prudential 
during the year. Within the Bank of Scotland joint 
venture a successful 22-unit Trade City industrial 
park was sold to CBRE Investors and a number of 
smaller unit sales were also completed from our 
sites in Weybridge, Enfield and Chelmsford.
Excellent progress is being made at the new 
70,000sq ft UK Supreme Court for the Ministry 
of Justice where Wallis, the Group’s specialist 
refurbishment business, is on target to complete 
the work in the spring of 2009. This will create a 
highly marketable 30-year income stream with a 
government-backed covenant.
Our strategic partnership with Invista continues 
to strengthen. At Reading terms have been 
agreed for Yell to occupy seven of the ten floors 
of the 219,000sq ft building which is now under 
construction by Kier Regional. On the remaining 
two sites tenant interest is being pursued to 
complete the development of this gateway project.
In July 2008 we formed a new joint venture with 
Network Rail. This ground-breaking partnership 
initially gives us the opportunity to develop seven

station-related sites in London and the south-east 
identified for regeneration. These sites include 
east Maidstone, Guildford, Epsom, Twickenham, 
Walthamstow, Enfield and Wembley. Over a 
period of ten years the sites will generate a gross 
development value of £500m and be supplemented 
at a later stage by further opportunities from the 
Network Rail property portfolio.
At Western International Market, near Heathrow, 
construction of a new market for the fruit and 
vegetable traders has now been completed and the 
site previously occupied by the traders has been 
released for redevelopment and a pre-sale or pre-let 
is currently being sought.
Following on from our successful headquarters 
scheme for National Trust, the Ordnance Survey 
headquarters development in Southampton recently 
received planning permission and a start on site 
is anticipated by late 2008. On completion the 
development will release 25 acres of land available 
for a major mixed-use scheme.
Property markets and outlook
The forthcoming year will provide the business 
with new challenges not seen for some years; 
however Kier Property’s low-risk strategy of largely 
non-speculative development will ensure that we 
are not exposed to large holdings of unoccupied 
buildings and that the portfolio is sufficiently robust 
to counter any cyclical movements. Within our 
current development portfolio we have the ability 
to enhance value through the planning process and, 
whilst this may not crystallise short-term profit, it 
will provide a strong foundation to both protect and 
enhance the asset base of the business.
By forming long-term partnerships in the 
development sector, such as the recent Network 
Rail joint venture scheme, we can look forward to 
a secure business stream spread over many years 
into the future. We are also examining the Group’s 
current residential land holdings with the aim of 
identifying potential opportunities for changes 
in planning to create value through alternative 
development including commercial use. KIER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 23

Infrastructure Investment business review
The year to 30 June 2008 has been a productive 
time for KPI with the successful disposal of an 
investment and the completion of construction on 
several projects. At the year-end following the sale 
of an investment during the year, our portfolio of 
PFI projects totalled 12, with all but one completed 
and operational. Our committed equity investment 
in PFI schemes stands at £18.4m (2007: £22.8m) of 
which £14.1m has been invested to date. The most 
significant milestone for the division was the sale  
of our 50% share in our first PFI project undertaken, 
Hairmyres Hospital in Scotland. The sale gave us 
proceeds of £13.8m which, when combined with 
a refinancing gain deferred from August 2004, 
generated a profit of £16.2m. The value attributed 
to the equity sold implies a net present value 
calculated using an average discount of less  
than 5%.
Three projects reached construction completion 
during the year, with a fourth due for completion 
in the autumn of 2008. Significantly, the delivery 
of all of these schemes has involved our Regional 
construction companies and three of them involve 
Kier Managed Services as facilities management 
providers. Completed projects include the Oldham 
Schools PFI project involving two 1,500-place 
secondary schools; the Garrett Anderson Centre at 
Ipswich Hospital and the highly successful North 
Kent Police Station. Good progress has been made 
2   The Garrett Anderson Centre was 
completed in 2008 and provides a 
9,000sq m extension to the existing 
acute hospital at Ipswich, delivered 
as a 30-year PFI concession. It was 
constructed by Kier Eastern, with 
the facilities management services 
at the centre being delivered by Kier 
Managed Services.

on the six new schools under the Norfolk County 
Council PFI Schools Scheme with three completed 
in 2006 and 2007 and the final phase due for 
completion in the autumn of 2008.
Infrastructure Investment markets and outlook
The PFI procurement route continues to provide us 
with opportunities for further investment. Whilst 
we have a firm anchor in the education, healthcare 
and local authority sectors of the PFI market, 
we are exploring other opportunities including 
fire stations, waste handling centres and student 
accommodation.
The remaining committed investment of £18.4m  
has a directors’ valuation of approximately £40m  
at 30 June 2008 based on discounting the cash 
flows from investments in financially closed 
projects at a rate of 7%. The secondary market for 
investments remains good and we are exploring 
other potential disposals.

Kier Project Investment (KPI) manages the

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Health & Safety
In 2008 Kier Group businesses have diligently 
focused on getting back to basics to ensure 
we create and maintain safe sites. This simple 
approach is having a significant effect on our safety 
performance with some spectacular results across 
our sites including seven million accident-free 
man-hours in Dubai. The progress made last year on 
people issues has helped shape our current strategy 
which aims to ensure a practical safety approach 
that facilitates safe working processes on site. Our 
Accident Incidence Rate (AIR) of 588 per 100,000 
staff and subcontractors (2007: 640) compares 
favourably with a Health & Safety Executive (HSE) 
target rate of 865 per 100,000.
People
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all 
of our people for their hard work over the last 12 
months and for their continuing commitment and 
support in making Kier the successful business it 
has become. 2008 has been a difficult year for some 
parts of the business and I suspect 2009 will be no 
easier. It is at times such as these that the businesses 
and teams need to pull together even more strongly 
to deliver the Group’s goals and objectives. We have 
many skilled, talented and committed people in this 
Group and I am confident that, together, we will 
successfully steer our way through these  
uncertain times.
Objectives and prospects
We are reporting at a time of increasing uncertainty 
in the UK economy with the credit crunch having a 
major effect on our Homes and Property businesses 
and the recent banking crisis sending shockwaves 
throughout the global economy. However our 
Construction and Support Services businesses are 
busy, our order books are strong and, importantly, 
our enquiry levels remain high, underpinned by our 
many framework agreements.
2009 is going to be a difficult year but we have 
skilled management teams in place in all of our 
businesses, many of whom have seen economic 
downturn in the past and have the experience to 
respond promptly to change as it arises. We have 
a strong balance sheet, good cash resources and a 
commitment to succeed. All of which will stand us 
in good stead over the next few years.

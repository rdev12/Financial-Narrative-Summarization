 OVERVIEW
Once again, our performance this year has been robust
and we have made further progress with our strategic
aim of being the provider of choice for IT services 
and unified communications to the UK SME and 
mid-market sector.

Group £m £m
Revenue 352.7 351.5

Operating loss (17.9) (16.8)
Cash generated from operations 44.2 47.6

Revenue has grown with the contribution from
acquisitions offsetting the well understood market
trends of reducing fixed line revenues and the impact of
regulation on mobile tariffs.
This year we have enhanced our product portfolio and
we have continued to reduce our reliance on our
traditional voice business. New acquisitions have
brought further strengths in data and systems. 
In particular, the acquisition of DDCS has added
significant capacity and capability to the existing 
hosting and managed services operations.
The Group has delivered a solid performance this year
in a difficult economic climate. I would like to thank our
employees across the Group for the effort and
commitment that has made this possible.
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our primary market is the SME and mid-market
business sector within the UK and our aim is to develop
the business through a strategy of organic and
acquisitive growth.
The acquisitions completed during the year are set 
out below.
On 1 May 2013 the Group acquired the entire issued
share capital of DDCS, the data specialist. This
acquisition has added significant breadth to our existing
data business and has added the infrastructure and data
capacity for further growth. DDCS has been integrated
with our existing data business in Daisy Retail.
On 26 June 2013 the Group acquired the entire issued
share capital of MoCo, the distributor and reseller of
business mobile and telecommunications. This business
has been successfully integrated into our Daisy
Distribution division.
On 26 October 2013 the Group completed the acquisition
of Indecs, the market-leading provider of technical
maintenance and support services for business critical,
IT server and cloud storage facilities. This business has
been successfully integrated with our existing partner
services business in the Daisy Wholesale division.
On 16 February 2014, the Group acquired the entire
issued share capital of ABSE, the business partner in
the public sector division of the Daisy Retail business,
with a particular specialism in network products.
Following the acquisition, the business has been fully
integrated into the Daisy Retail division.
DIVISIONAL REPORTING
The Group operates three distinct trading divisions:
Daisy Retail, Daisy Wholesale and Daisy Distribution.
The components of each operating segment have been
re-assessed by the chief operating decision-maker and
re-aligned with the current management reporting
structure. Prior period results have been adjusted to
ensure the divisional operating (loss)/profit results are
stated on a comparable basis.

summary of its results for the year ended 31 March
2014 can be seen below, together with the comparative
results for 2013.

Adjusted EBITDA 45.4
Adjusted EBITDA % 18.6%
Networks margin has increased to 41.4% (2013: 40.4%).
The underlying gross margin from fixed lines and calls
has been improved through improved commercial
terms and pricing arbitrage in respect of lower-cost
voice traffic for mobile-terminated calls. 
In line with our expectations, the market for traditional
fixed line access and calls has continued to decline.
These legacy products have diminishing significance as
we diversify our product range and increasingly provide
new technologies and mobile and data-led solutions to
our customers. Nonetheless, we are working hard to
ensure margins are maintained via continued
enhancement activity such as consolidation of supply,
improved volume discounts and product bundling to
provide improved customer value.
Our data revenue has increased with the acquisition of
DDCS within the year, which has also led to improved
gross margin to 44.8% (2013: 41.1%) as a result of a
higher mix of hosting and managed service products.

Daisy Retail continued
Investment in our existing data centres and the
acquisition of DDCS has increased available capacity
and improved our facilities, providing a significant
opportunity for further growth in the market. 
Overall revenues in systems have fallen with increased
focus on recurring revenue streams over one-off sales,
with gross margins similar to the prior year at 56.5%
(2013: 56.3%). 
During the year, within our Daisy Surgery Line business
we have developed new system solutions in response to
a change in customer requirements. This has had the
effect of reducing revenues in systems by £2.0 million
and in networks by £3.0 million.
The revenue in mobile has fallen to £33.8 million 
(2013: £40.0 million) whilst gross profit has increased 
to £13.7 million (2013: 13.0 million) reflecting improved
commercial terms with one of the major mobile
networks. As a result of the change in commercial
terms, buying rates have improved but there has 
been a reduction in the overall level of connection
bonuses received.
Our success in Daisy Retail is driven by our ability to
increase the number of products and services taken by
our customer base, retention of the base through
excellent customer service and our ability to drive
further efficiencies and improvements in our processes.
Below is an analysis of the percentage split of the
average number of products per customer for the
directly-owned base within Daisy Retail. Products are
defined as calls, lines, inbound telephony services,
mobile, internet services, hosted solutions 
and maintenance:

The division has continued to focus on cross-selling 
and increasing product penetration. The number of
customers now taking at least three products has
increased to 26% (2013: 24%).
Efficient administrative functions continue to be
important to us and I am pleased to report that at
31 March 2014 the Daisy Retail customer base enjoyed
direct debit penetration of 77% (2013: 77%) and e-billing
penetration of 60% (2013: 54%).

Daisy Wholesale
Daisy Wholesale provides communications services to
smaller telecoms resellers. These resellers comprise
small to medium Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”),
telecoms networks and resellers and IT service
providers. These supply arrangements exist as a result
of the Group’s ability to obtain better pricing from
network carriers and ISPs, combined with the provision
of user-friendly portals, which facilitate efficient
provisioning for the resellers.
Products offered by Daisy Wholesale comprise:
Networks
fixed line calls, fixed line rentals, inbound telephony
services, select services and managed billing
Data
IP VPN, broadband, ethernet and hosting
Systems
maintenance, engineering and equipment
Mobile
a white-label offering from O2 and Vodafone

Our Wholesale data business (principally aggregated
broadband services) continues to enjoy higher gross
margins than those traditionally seen in networks. 
The post-acquisition results of Indecs have been
included within systems.
The main area of growth during the year has been in the
systems product which has benefitted from the full-year
effect of The Net Crowd Limited (“TNC”), acquired in
January 2013, together with the post-acquisition results
of Indecs. This, together with some operating cost
efficiencies, has resulted in a significant improvement in
adjusted EBITDA to £9.7 million (2013: £6.7 million). We
anticipate further progression during the next financial
year as we see the full-year benefit of the acquisition.

The post-acquisition results for MoCo have been

This year the division has grown following the
acquisition of MoCo. Furthermore, gross margins have
improved to 27.8% (2013: 26.2%) following changes 
to the commercial terms with one of the major 
mobile networks.
As previously disclosed, there have been issues in the
past with the delay of mid-term contract renewals. We
were able to re-initiate mid-term renewals during the
year and are now positioned well for the year ahead.
Revenue by product — Group
Across the Group as a whole, our revenue can be viewed
as follows:
2014 2013
% of % of
Product £m total £m total
Networks 141.6 40% 159.2 46%

Group revenue
This demonstrates the diverse product mix, covering the
broad spectrum of communications services that Daisy
Group delivers to its customers. There has been an
increase in the proportion of revenue coming from
systems following the acquisition of Indecs and the 
full-year effect of TNC, acquired last year. Traditional
fixed line calls (excluding inbound telephony services)
continue to decline and now contribute only 11% of total
Group revenue (2013: 14%).

OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER GROWTH
We have a highly skilled executive team capable of
building on the Group’s position as the main
consolidator and the leading independent provider of 
IT services and unified communications to the SME and
mid-market business segment. We will continue to
evaluate and execute acquisitions that help build
strategic advantage and where we can see value for 
our shareholders.
We have invested £2.4 million in software development
this year (2013: £2.1 million). This investment has
ensured that we have the required customer
relationship management and billing systems that will
enable us to service a growing customer base taking
multiple products, over the medium term. In addition,
we have enhanced our network infrastructure and data
centres in preparation for future growth. Property, plant
and equipment additions totalled £4.3 million during the
year (2013: £3.1 million), with the bulk of this
expenditure relating to new network infrastructure
equipment at our various locations.
We will continue to further develop our processes and
systems and we will continue to invest to ensure that 
we have the right infrastructure to support our 
growth strategy.
SUMMARY
The last 12 months have seen Daisy Group make good
progress with both organic and acquisitive growth,
reinforcing the Group’s position in the market place.
We have in place the platform, the systems, the people
and the product set to allow us to grow both organically
and via strategic acquisitions.
Against a difficult economic backdrop, we believe we are
well positioned to make further progress towards our
aim of being the IT services and unified communications
provider of choice to the SME and mid-market sectors.

Each of these international businesses trades 
profitably and delivered excellent growth in 
operating margins and adjusted operating 
profits

 in 2011.
We are also investing in our New Markets 
where we are building our French manufacturer 
warranty business, Société Francaise de 
Garantie (SFG), consistent with our UK warranty 
business, as well as utility based membership 
businesses in Belgium and Italy. 
Worldwide gross new policy sales increased  
by 18% to 2.9m (2010: 2.5m) which, combined 
with high stable retention rates, has driven  
total policy numbers up 15% to 11.4m  
(2010: 9.9m). Total customer numbers across 
all our businesses have increased by 14% to 
4.9m (2010: 4.3m) driven by particularly strong 
performances in both the UK and USA. 
H
omeServe’s vision is to be the first place 
people turn to for home emergencies 
and repairs. We are achieving this by 
providing a membership service which frees our 
customers from the worry and inconvenience of 
home emergencies and repairs. Our business 
model of building long-term relationships with 
business partners, leveraging our product 
development expertise, producing leading 
sales and marketing materials and delivering 
excellent customer service with high renewal 
rates continues to deliver strong returns for 
shareholders with growth in adjusted profit 
before tax
2
 and adjusted earnings per share

.
We continue to grow our UK business, with 
an increased customer base and income per 
customer whilst replicating this proven model 
internationally in the USA, Spain and, through 
our joint venture Doméo, in France.

Business review
Our International operations currently deliver a 
relatively small, but fast growing, proportion of the 
Group’s profit. In 2011, adjusted operating profit
2
 
from our established International operations in 
the USA, Doméo and Spain more than doubled 
to £16.0m. Our International adjusted operating 
profit
2
, including the investment we have made in 
our New Markets operations of £1.1m was £14.9m, 
a 71% increase over the past twelve months. 
The penetration of our International households 
has increased from 3.2% to 4.3% over the past 
year and we believe this can grow further in the 
future enabling us to significantly increase the 
contribution from our International businesses in 
the medium term.
Across the world our membership businesses 
managed over 1.3m repairs, an increase of over 
13% over the past 12 months. We have a high 
quality network of engineers all of whom are 
vetted and managed by experienced contractor 
managers. We manage the performance of 
our engineers using a series of performance 
indicators and customer surveys. During 2011 
over 94% of all customers who had a claim were 
satisfied with the service they received, higher 
than a year ago. 
The following sections report on the performance 
of each of our business segments. Since last year 
we have reviewed our segmental presentation 
and now provide separate disclosure relating to 
each of our established businesses (UK, USA, 
Spain and Doméo, our joint venture in France), 
with those businesses that we are currently 
developing now classified together as “New 
Markets”.
UK
 > Achieved our 4% customer growth target 
 > Maintained a high retention rate of 82.7% 
 > Successfully renewed all of our water utility 
partner agreements 
 > A significant increase in the number of jobs 
completed via One Contact
 > Robust underlying operating margin
We are pleased to report that we have achieved 
our customer growth target in the UK with 
customer numbers of 3.0m, 4% higher than 
a year ago (2010: 2.9m). We achieved gross 
new policy sales of 1.8m (2010: 1.6m), with 
total policy numbers increasing by 6% to 7.5m 
(2010: 7.1m). The growth in customer and policy 
numbers reflects the continued success of our 
core utility marketing campaigns, the growth 
in our manufacturer warranty business, as well 
as the contribution from our customer growth 
initiatives, including ‘One Contact’, landlord 
products and financial services partners. 
We have had an excellent year in terms of 
retention with the rate remaining high at 82.7%, 
as a result of a number of ongoing initiatives. 
Our retention call centre agents’ productivity and 
effectiveness have improved, further reflecting 
increased staff tenure, better training and 
coaching as well as the development of new 
retention products and propositions.

‘Other’ policies which includes pest and home 
appliance cover are particularly popular with 
Combined policy holders. Combined policies, 
which enable customers to consolidate multiple 
elements of cover into a single policy, continue 
to grow, and now represent 21% (2010: 19%) of 
UK customers. On average a combined policy 
customer holds six policy elements.
The success of One Contact, our ‘pay on 
use’ service, in delivering new membership 
customers is now becoming evident with the 
number of emergencies repaired during the 
year more than doubling. The proportion of 
customers converted into full policy members 
has also increased, finishing the year at over 
80%. In 2012, we will focus on increasing the 
number of One Contact emergencies repaired 
whilst maintaining the high job to member 
conversion rate. 
Subsequent to the year end, we aired a new TV 
and radio advertising campaign in the Granada 
TV region, promoting the HomeServe brand 
and our ‘0800 247 999’ telephone number. 
Whilst the campaign is targeted at developing 
our One Contact service, our utility partners in 
the region are very supportive of the campaign 
as it increases awareness of HomeServe and 
therefore the likelihood of customers buying 
policies in the future. Initial analysis of call 
volumes and policy sales is showing a positive 
impact from the campaign.
Over the past year we have made good 
progress in developing and rolling out our 
customer growth initiatives in the UK:
> We have seen a good take-up of our 
landlord and flat policies which have been 
sold through a mix of marketing activity 
including outbound telephony and direct 
advertising under the HomeServe brand. 
Our growth in the number of customers and 
our strong retention performance is particularly 
pleasing given the continuing uncertain 
economic climate and the perceived increase in 
competition following a number of high profile 
media campaigns from both new and existing 
home emergency providers. 
Our customer service proposition of directly 
employed, franchised and sub-contract 
engineers is delivering improved customer 
service with 93% of customers satisfied. Our 
network of around 300 directly employed 
plumbers completed over 80% of our water 
related repairs over the past 12 months with 
92% of jobs completed at the first visit. The 
coldest winter in 100 years presented a number 
of challenges for our engineers and we were 
satisfied with the level of service we delivered 
during this period despite record levels of 
emergency calls. 
We are pleased to report that we have 
continued to grow the number of our core water 
related policies. Water utilities continue to be 
key partners to our UK business and we are 
delighted that we completed the re-signing of 
all our partners that were due to renew during 
the year. We have now renewed all of our water 
utility partners, most for the third time, with the 
majority now being on long-term contracts. 
Manufacturer warranties remain a key part 
of our business with core renewable policies 
(where we have a direct ongoing relationship 
with the customer) increasing by 30% to 
503k. Over the past twelve months we have 
commenced marketing and administrating 
Dyson’s manufacturer warranty scheme in the 
UK, and subsequent to the year end, in April 
2011, we signed a deal with Ferroli, an Italian 
boiler manufacturer, to take over management 
of their warranty programme. HomeServe

> We have also had a successful year with the 
sales of our home assistance membership 
policies through our partnerships with 
financial services companies. Marketing 
is primarily via telesales activity and this 
represents a cost effective form of customer 
acquisition. During the past year we have 
worked with Santander, Northern Rock and 
a UK credit card company and are planning 
to further increase our financial services 
partnerships in the future.
> We have also signed affinity relationships 
with GB Oils, NWF Fuels and Total Butler 
who are the major distributors of oil to UK 
households who use this as their main 
source of fuel. We are continuing to develop 
and test our oil boiler breakdown marketing 
to identify the best creative and channel in 
order to maximise sales with customers of 
these partners. 
Income per customer in the UK increased  
by 9% to £89 over the past 12 months. This 
reflects the strengthening of our customer 
relationships, with the number of policies  
per customer increasing to 2.52 (2010: 2.47),  
as well as an increase in policy prices together 
with enhanced cover. 
Business review
Underlying revenue
1
 in the UK increased by 
10% reflecting the growth in customer and  
policy numbers as well as an increase in  
income per customer. The underlying operating 
margin
1
 in the UK was stable and adjusted 
operating profit
2
 increased by 9% to £104.3m 
(2010: £95.7m). 
The legislation for the proposed transfer 
of private sewers and lateral drains from 
homeowners into the ownership of the utility 
companies is currently passing through 
Parliament. This bill will help provide clarification 
to homeowners as to who is responsible for 
the drainage in and around their property. 
We estimate that the majority of our drainage 
related emergencies occur either within the 
property or in the external drain both of which 
will remain the homeowners responsibility and 
therefore we believe the proposed change will 
not impact our products and services. In fact 
we believe the legislation and clarification of 
responsibilities between the homeowner and 
the utility may provide us with an opportunity  
for additional sales of water related services.
We have decided to cease operating through 
the low margin, point of sale furniture warranties 
channel as we focus on growing relationships 
with our core utility and manufacturer partner 
customer base. HomeServe

United States of America
 > A step change in our business with  
an 83% increase in policy numbers
 > Increasing momentum in signing new 
partners and acquiring existing programmes
 > Strong organic growth with gross new  
policy sales (excluding National Grid) up 55% 
to 0.45m
 > Operating profit of £6.1m, up from £1.5m  
in 2010 
During the year we have gained significant 
momentum in signing new partners and  
acquiring existing home emergency 
programmes. We announced new affinity 
relationships with Southern California Gas 
and Millennium Energy, neither of whom have 
previously operated a programme. Southern 
California Gas serves over 5m residential 
customers whilst Millennium Energy serves 0.6m 
households through its Tuscon Power subsidiary 
(0.4m) and Unisource Energy (0.2m) subsidiaries 
in Arizona. 
In addition, we completed the acquisition and 
successful integration of National Grid Energy 
Services (NGES) in August, which included 0.18m 
customers, and we also agreed the terms in 
March on which we would renew the existing 
0.06m home assistance customers of South 
Jersey Energy Services Plus as they become due 
for renewal from mid 2011.
We are also pleased to have reached two 
further agreements since the year end with 
Contra Costa and Middlesex Water, both water 
utilities. These two utilities service around 0.15m 
households across California, New Jersey and 
Delaware and the agreements will allow us to 
bill customers via their utility bill. We have also 
agreed to purchase Middlesex’s existing 10k 
home emergency policies.
We now have 21m affinity partner households in 
the USA with an average penetration rate of 4%. 
Whilst the overall penetration in the USA is lower 
than in the UK, there is significant variation by 
individual partner, with rates ranging from less 
than 1% with our newer partners up to around 
30% with one of our oldest water utility partners.
The penetration rate also varies by the type 
of utility. Of our 21m USA affinity partner 
households, 2m are water and 19m are energy 
(gas and electric) households. We have achieved 
an average penetration rate of 15% across our 
water partners so far and we continue to see 
significant potential to increase the average 
penetration rate in our energy partners, where 
the highest penetration rate is around 20% with 
South Jersey Energy Services Plus.
We also see good growth opportunities through 
the increased penetration of our existing affinity 
partners as well as deepening our relationships 
with these customers through increased cross-
sell activity.
At the same time, we are actively talking to new 
potential partners whose customers have not 
previously been offered home emergency cover 
as well as actively discussing opportunities to 
acquire existing programmes run, for example, 
by utilities. We estimate that there are around 
35 programmes currently operated by utilities 
and we believe that we can grow them at a 
significantly faster rate than the existing utilities, 
as we have evidenced with those previously  
run by California Water, United Water and  
First Energy.
2011 has seen a significant change in the size of 
our USA business with customer numbers up 
57% to 0.91m (2010: 0.58m), reflecting a strong 
increase in new customers as well as the 0.18m 
customers acquired from NGES. Gross policy 
sales (excluding policies acquired with NGES) 
were 0.45m an increase of 55% (2010: 0.29m). HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 17
Our marketing programmes in the USA are 
focused on direct mail with outbound telesales 
representing a smaller part of our overall 
marketing activity compared to the UK. We ran 
a number of campaigns across the autumn and 
winter months to NGES customers promoting 
policies including HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, 
Air Conditioning & Cooling), water heater and 
electrics and we launched our first marketing 
campaign promoting ‘interior gas’ cover to 
Southern California Gas customers at the end  
of the financial year.
As well as growing our affinity partner customers 
and policies, we are also seeing strong growth 
in the sale of our own ‘HomeServe USA’ branded 
policies in areas where we do not currently have 
an affinity partner. Our primary focus remains on 
expanding our affinity partner footprint, although 
sales through the HomeServe branded channel, 
which have slightly lower take-ups and lower first 
year retention rates, do represent a profitable 
channel for customer acquisition and a source  
of credentials to prospective new partners.
Our USA retention rate remains high at 81.8% 
(2010: 82.6%) with 70% of policies paid on their 
utility bill or by other continuous payment 
methods such as credit card or E-Z pay (a form  
of direct debit). 
Income per customer was up 22% to $85 in 
2011 reflecting an increase in the number of 
products per customer from 1.30 to 1.52 and 
the increasing proportion of higher net income 
NGES policies. The increased average number of 
policies held per customer reflects the success 
of our cross-selling campaigns as well as the 
higher policies per customer within the acquired 
NGES business.
Revenue in the USA was £52.6m, 105% higher 
than a year ago (2010: £25.7m) reflecting the 
strong growth in customer and policy numbers 
and the USA reported an adjusted operating 
profit
2
 of £6.1m (2010: £1.5m).
We continue to invest in both the infrastructure 
and people in our USA operations, with a 
particular focus on growing our business 
development, corporate development and 
marketing teams over the past year. We are 
also investing in our customer service capability 
and opened our second USA call centre, in 
Chattanooga, Tennessee, in November giving us 
initial capacity for a further 140 claims agents to 
manage our growing customer base as well as 
providing us with a back up for our existing call 
centre in Miami, Florida.

 up £2.5m to £8.2m, 
driven by strong renewal income
Doméo, our joint venture in France with Veolia, 
has reported strong growth in both customer and 
policy numbers over the past year. The number of 
customers has increased by 11% to 0.86m (2010: 
0.77m) with policies increasing by 15% to 2.2m 
(2010: 1.9m) over the same period. Our French 
customers are very insurance minded and this, 
combined with a high proportion of payments 
made by direct debit and a high standard of 
customer service, has ensured that our retention 
rate remains high at 88.4% (FY10: 88.3%).
Gross new policy sales were 0.5m (2010: 0.5m). 
Sales in the second half of the year of 0.34m were 
up over 10% on the same period in 2010 reflecting 
the successful implementation of a number of 
new initiatives last summer. The initiatives, which 
were developed by a joint UK and French team, 
included new marketing creatives, improved data 
selection and new pricing strategies and have all 
delivered good results demonstrating the benefit 
of sharing best practice across our operations.

A key focus for Doméo in 2012 is to continue to 
test initiatives to increase the activity between 
its call centre and that of its affinity partners. 
In addition, while we achieve good take-up 
rates both in and outside Veolia regions, we are 
continuing to discuss opportunities with new 
potential partners.
Income per customer increased by 5% to €93 
with the benefit from an increase in the number 
of policies per customer offset by initial pricing 
dilution from the successful new customer 
acquisition programme.
Doméo has increased its adjusted operating 
profit
2
 by 44%, with our 49% share contributing 
£8.2m (2010: £5.7m) to our Group result. The

Spain
 > More than doubled the number of customers 
and policies
 > New outbound telesales operation delivering 
good results
 > Commenced management of Indesit’s 
manufacturer warranty programme
In Spain, despite the country’s difficult economic 
conditions, we have more than doubled the 
number of customers and policies to 0.17m and 
0.22m respectively, whilst gross new policy sales 
were 0.16m (2010: 0.05m).
The majority of our marketing activity over the 
past 12 months has been targeted at the Endesa 
customer base, with good take-up rates on both 
acquisition and cross-sell campaigns. During the 
latter part of the year we commenced mailings 
to Agbar customers and will be rolling out a full 
programme of campaigns over the coming year.
We have introduced a number of new marketing 
initiatives in Spain over the past 12 months.  
Our new outbound telesales operation has had 
particular success, selling Electrical wiring cover 
to Endesa’s gas customers and we have also 
trialled the use of utility bill marketing inserts 
with good take-up results.
We are making good progress in developing 
our product portfolio in Spain. In addition to our 
traditional electric and water policies, we are 
seeing good growth in our ‘Club’ product which 
gives members priority access to our repair 
network including two hours of free handy man 
labour. During the year we have also taken on 
the operation of Indesit’s manufacturer warranty 
programme in Spain, following the signing 
of a similar deal with SFG in France. We have 
seen good take-up rates from our initial ‘inbox’ 
registration card marketing activity and will be 
expanding the number of channels used over 
the coming year.
Our claims handling and repair network 
operation continues to support our growing 
membership business, as well as its existing 
insurance partners, and celebrated its tenth 
anniversary during the year. Revenue from the 
membership business has more than doubled 
as a result of increasing renewal income and 
this has contributed to Spain reporting an 
adjusted operating profit
2
 of £1.7m, significantly 
higher than the £0.4m reported last year.

In Belgium, while we have not yet found a 
suitable affinity partner, we are continuing 
discussions with a number of potential 
partners. 
In the first half of the year we opened our Milan 
office and agreed a 15 month test marketing 
agreement with Enel Energia, part of the Enel 
group, Italy’s largest energy company. We also 
signed an affinity partnership with Unicasa, an 
Italian property management company. 
We have undertaken a number of test mailings 
with these two partners promoting plumbing 
and drainage cover, gas supply pipe cover as 
well as electrical wiring cover, with take-ups 
in line with our expectations. We are planning 
to invest in additional marketing in the current 
financial year before reviewing the success of 
these agreements.
Our New Markets operations reported revenue 
of £9.9m (2010: £9.7m) and an adjusted 
operating loss
2
 of £1.1m (2010: adjusted 
operating profit
2
 £1.1m). The adjusted operating 
loss
2
 reflects the additional investment in 
infrastructure, people and test marketing 
programmes. We expect to further increase our 
investment in these countries in 2012, reflecting 
our confidence in their prospects as evidenced 
by the good take-up rates achieved in our test 
marketing activity in 2011. 
New markets
 > Good results from initial manufacturer 
warranty marketing in France
 > Test marketing in Italy with Enel is delivering 
good take-up rates 
 > Initial results give us confidence to increase 
investment in 2012
The success of our established international 
operations in the USA, Spain and Doméo in 
France demonstrates that the HomeServe 
business model is transferable to countries 
outside the UK and that such investment can 
create significant shareholder value. We are 
therefore investing in infrastructure, people and 
test marketing programmes in new businesses 
in Belgium, France (via our warranty business 
Société Francaise de Garantie (SFG)) and Italy. 
In SFG, our wholly owned warranty business 
based in France, we are investing in the 
development of a post-point of sale and 
manufacturer warranty operation, which in the 
medium term will reduce the concentration 
of the existing retail warranty customer base. 
During the year we announced two new 
partnerships to start selling warranties to the 
customers of Indesit and Mistergooddeal, a 
leading French online retailer. Initial marketing 
campaigns have delivered results in line 
with our expectations and we are planning 
additional investment in the coming year. HomeServe

Outlook and Summary
Our UK business has grown its customer 
numbers and delivered good growth in adjusted 
operating profit
2
 in 2011. In 2012 we are confident 
that we can continue to grow UK customer 
numbers by around 3% and maintain a robust 
operating margin.
Our International businesses already have 
around double the number of affinity partner 
households than the UK, although customer 
penetration and income per customer are 
currently lower. We are focused on improving 
our performance in our International businesses 
through the continued development of our 
product range and increased customer 
acquisition and cross-sell marketing 
programmes. We will also continue to target 
new affinity partners in each of our markets 
and expect the number of affinity partner 
households in the USA to exceed the UK over 
the coming years. We are planning for our 
established International businesses to continue 
to increase operating margins and achieve 
significant growth in adjusted operating profit

.
Finally, we will build on the success of our initial 
test marketing activities in our New Markets 
businesses by increasing the amount of 
investment in 2012 by around £3m as well as 
continuing to research opportunities in other 
new countries.
We are pleased to report an excellent set of 
financial results with strong adjusted earnings 
growth

 and a robust operational performance. 
Our UK business continues to deliver good 
growth with our established international 
businesses gaining momentum. Our business is 
highly cash generative and this has enabled us 
to reduce our net debt to £11.8m.
We have made a good start to the new financial 
year and expect to deliver another year of 
strong growth.

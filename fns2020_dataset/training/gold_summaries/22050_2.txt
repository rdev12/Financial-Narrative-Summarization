generating a high value pre-clinical asset portfolio that will drive revenue through 
early stage licensing deals. Existing fee-for-service agreements will be discontinued.

identification and drug design capabilities:
 – in March 2016, Adorial Limited (“Adorial”) together with its subsidiaries 
and its proprietary DNA-based target identification platform, T axonomy3
®
, 
were acquired. New T axonomy3
®
 targets in rheumatoid arthritis were 
announced in July 2016 alongside a potential personalised medicine 
approach in Parkinson’ s disease; and
 – also in July 2016, the pioneering computational drug discovery technologies 
from MolPlex Ltd were acquired, further enhancing the Company’ s cutting-edge 
drug design platform.

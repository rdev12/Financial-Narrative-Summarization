Chief Executive’ s Review
A three-pronged marketing strategy
is aiming, first and foremost, 
to capture today’ s youth – 16 –24
year-olds – recruiting new customers
as soon as they become sexually
active. Condom users retain brand
loyalty as long as the product quality
is exceptional – which is the case with
Durex. Advertising has to appeal to
this group, even if it unsettles older
generations. Novel marketing ideas
plus innovation in the area of
‘pleasure-enhancing’ products 
will ensure the brand continues 
to evolve and attract consumers 
to use the brand.
The second strand of our approach 
is to explore ways in which Durex as 
a brand can be ‘stretched’ into other
related categories. For instance, our
previous disparate lubricants range 
is being repositioned as Durex ‘Play’.
Thirdly , we recognise the social
responsibility Durex bears as world
leader in condoms. We continue 
to develop an active social marketing
programme in developing countries,
helping to eradicate sexually
transmitted diseases, unwanted
pregnancies and AIDS. Besides 
the immediate support we can give
to such government or charity-
sponsored education and health
awareness initiatives, longer-term, 
it creates awareness of Durex in
developing marketplaces.
Scholl
For Scholl, there is a significant
opportunity to grow the business
from where we are today , by 
building on the brand’ s heritage 
rooted in Dr Scholl’ s expertise in 
care of the feet, to make the brand
relevant to today’ s consumer needs.
As we have made additional
investment in R&D, we have an 
increasingly healthy new product
development pipeline. We have a
number of recent successes with
innovations in the areas of new
plasters for corns and blisters, new
footcare implements, toiletries and
improvements to our Flight Socks
range. We will re-establish the clear
technological edge and passion for
foot care that initially drove Scholl 
to the reputation it enjoys today . 
As well as new products, we will 
also be working to simplify the
current, sometimes confusing 
range of products, so that the 
choice of the right Scholl product 
is clear and obvious.
Our Medical businesses have
strong brands and talented
people. However , we believe
that a choice is necessary and
that on balance the greater
expertise and potential in 
SSL ’ s case lies with the 
Consumer business.
The Scholl and Durex brands are
extremely well placed within the
Consumer healthcare markets in
which they compete. Relative to
some other consumer categories, 
the family planning and footcare
categories are quite small today 
and require specialist knowledge 
to be successful. SSL already has the
leading share of these categories
across our territories as a whole and
in most individual markets. We start
from a strong position and by being
focused believe we can deepen our
expertise further and deliver stronger
growth as a result. 
Durex
The condom category is fraught 
with taboos, embarrassment and
innuendo and yet it is ultimately 
a category that is dealing with
incredibly serious issues such as
avoiding unwanted pregnancies 
and helping to avoid the transmission
of some of the most serious diseases
affecting the world today .
Brian Buchan
Chief Executive
In March of this year , we announced our intention 
to sell the Medical businesses of SSL. This will allow us
to refocus the Group as a successful global consumer
business, a business which includes two of the best-
known brands in the world – Scholl and Durex.  SSL International plc

We see markedly different
development of individual sub-
categories within our Scholl range 
in different geographic markets.
Insoles are very well developed 
in the UK, deodorants in Germany ,
shoes in Thailand. Capitalising upon
these differences and working 
to ensure that we bring all areas 
of the business up to best-in-class
levels provides us with plenty 
of scope for growth.
While job number one is to develop
our ‘crown jewels’, SSL has the
potential to extend its expertise 
in carefully chosen fields. Our OTC
portfolio will also be developed. 
We are exploring new opportunities
within categories in which we excel,
such as headlice treatment,
analgesics and indigestion remedies.
As circumstances allow, we will look
to acquisitions to help develop
market share and extend our range
into new markets. The sale of the
Medical division will free the people
and financial resources needed 
to pursue these opportunities 
more aggressively .
Looking beyond our brands, 
we have continued to achieve our
Group-wide targets in cost saving.
Our cost base has been reduced 
by £18 million over the course of 
the year . There will inevitably be
further significant reorganisation 
and restructuring ahead as a result 
of refocusing on the consumer
marketplace. This will give rise 
to some understandable anxiety
amongst our employees and 
our thanks go to them for all their
undiminished efforts during these
times. We are acting to provide
certainty where this can be done. 
For example, a new management
structure has already been 
announced and rationalisation 
is already underway in some 
other areas.
Our business systems – particularly 
IT – have continued to be streamlined
and enhanced. These systems will
ultimately form the basis of sustained
cash management improvement 
in areas such as inventory and 
trade receivables. We, together 
with PeopleSoft, have recently
brought online new software
modules in the UK business. This
change was needed to start the
process of moving from the large
range of legacy systems the Group
has inherited. Once fully bedded
down our plan over the next two
years is to roll-out these new systems
throughout our European markets.
We are well on the way to achieving
Group-wide world-class standards 
in environmental and quality
management in our manufacturing
processes. We now have 26 of our
sites with ISO 9001 registration and
12 with full ISO 14001 compliance.
T raining and development 
of employees continues at every 
level – creating multi-skilled, flexible
workforces in the factories and
creative, entrepreneurial
management in every geographical
area of our business. The sales 
and marketing initiatives around 
the world demonstrate that local
market knowledge and awareness 
of localised cultures is essential.
The growth achieved by many of 
our markets in Durex and Scholl over
the past year plus the undoubted
potential that remains to be exploited
explains our confidence in the future
as a dedicated global consumer
company . SSL is the world authority
on condoms and footcare, and 
we intend to exploit our skills and
heritage to the full.

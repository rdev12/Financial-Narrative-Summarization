 AVEVA has made excellent progress 
this past year, achieving record levels 
of turnover, profit and cash.
Our continued strong performance reflects
AVEVA’s dominant position in growth
markets, leading innovative technologies
and an infrastructure geared towards
expanding and maintaining relationships
with blue chip customers across the globe.
We look to the future with confidence and
are particularly excited by the prospects
for VNET.
Turnover for the year increased by
51%
AVEVA Annual Report 2005 Chairman’s Statement 04
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT During the year under review we saw a
healthy increase in demand for our VANTAGE
solutions in all our major target sectors of
oil and gas, power and marine. Our marine
business (Tribon), acquired at the beginning
of the year, performed ahead of plan and
has benefited from a smooth integration
into the enlarged group. Its success has
contributed to a particularly outstanding
performance in the Asia Pacific region. 
KEY FINANCIALS 
Turnover for the year increased by 51% to
£57.5 million (2004 - £38.1 million). In
terms of organic growth (excluding Tribon),
turnover increased by a very commendable
15% to £43.7 million. Recurring revenues
increased by 42% to £32.6 million (2004 -
£23 million). Recurring revenues excluding
Tribon amounted to £25.7 million, an actual
increase of 14% when using consistent
exchange rates.
Following the acquisition of Tribon in 
May 2004 and as highlighted at last year’s
preliminary results, an exceptional charge of
£2.3 million has been expensed this year in
order to facilitate a smooth integration of
the business. I am delighted to report that 
the restructuring of the enlarged group has
resulted in full year savings ahead of initial
expectations at £3.3 million. 
As a result of the acquisition, goodwill 
and intangible amortisation for the year 
was £2.7 million (2004 - £0.6 million). 
Profit before tax, exceptional restructuring
costs and goodwill amortisation increased
by 60% to £10.7 million (2004 - £6.7
million), generating adjusted earnings 
per share of 36.7p (2004 - 26.2p) 
– an increase of 40%.
AVEVA continued to be strongly cash
generative with net cash as of the year-end
at £11.2 million (2004 - £8.7 million). 
DIVIDEND
Following another excellent year and
ongoing confidence in the outlook for
AVEVA, the Board is proposing an increased
final dividend of 4.3p per share (2004 -
4.0p). Together with the interim dividend 
of 1.8p, this gives a full year dividend 
of 6.1p (2004 - 5.8p).
Subject to final approval at the Annual
General Meeting, the final dividend will 
be paid on 1 August 2005 to shareholders
on the register at 1 July 2005. 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING
STANDARDS (“IFRS”)
Preparations continue for the introduction
of the International Financial Reporting
Standards that will first impact the group’s
interim statement for the six months to 
30 September 2005. The group will advise
its shareholders on any changes in advance
of its half-year statement.
PROSPECTS
The successful integration of Tribon and 
the subsequent restructuring of the enlarged
group, has undoubtedly enhanced AVEVA’s
leading position in the engineering data
and IT markets. Our exposure to high
growth, dynamic market economies such 
as China and Korea, leadership in key target
sectors, strong blue chip client partnerships,
innovative approach and greater global
scale and reach, give me confidence that 
we are well positioned to deliver further
turnover and profit growth, and ultimately,
shareholder value. In the current year the
investment required to exploit the exciting
opportunity within VNET will affect
profitability, however we are confident 
of a significant return on this investment
from the next financial year.

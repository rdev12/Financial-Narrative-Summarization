CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
As I reflect on 2016, I am 
pleased by the progress  
that Arrow Global has made. 
The Group continues to 
maintain a focused  
strategy, designed to help 
achieve our aim of being 
Europe’s leading purchaser 
and manager of debt.  
The result has been another 
excellent year. We have 
delivered a strong financial 
performance, increased  
our dividend and enhanced 
shareholder value.
Evolving our strategy
We continue to implement our strategy of 
building leading positions in our chosen 
European markets, but have evolved this to 
include the growth of our asset management 
business and operating platforms. We  
place significant emphasis on operational 
excellence through having outstanding 
people, technology and data, improving the 
customer journey and ensuring we attract 
and retain the best talent, all underpinned 
with a balanced capital structure. You  
can read more about how we are delivering 
against our strategy on page 24.
A transformative year
In 2016, we further diversified our business by 
geography, asset class and revenue stream. 
The balance of our investments reflects our 
expanded geographical group. During the 
year, 28% of our investment in purchased 
loan portfolios and loan notes was in the 
UK, 43% in Portugal and 29% in Benelux. 
We also completed the acquisitions of 
InVesting B.V. (‘Vesting’) in the Netherlands 
and Belgium and agreed the proposed 
acquisition of Zenith Service S.p.A. (‘Zenith’) 
in Italy. These transactions, coupled with the 
acquisition of the servicing capabilities and 
co-investment in the RNHB Hypotheekbank 
loan book, have seen us enhance our 
European mainland capabilities significantly. 
We continue to demonstrate our proven 
track record of securing long-term funding 
from a diverse investor base. Between  
July and September, we made significant 
progress against our debt funding objectives 
to ensure we have a strong financial base  
to grow our business. We secured a material 
reduction in our cost of debt, whilst also 
extending the average term of our debt 
facilities through the successful refinancing 
of our £220 million bond and our  
£180 million revolving credit facility.
In August, we received authorisation 
from the UK Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA). This was an important milestone 
following the transfer of our industry 
regulation from the Office of Fair Trading  
to the FCA. It confirms our commitment  
to high operating standards and treating 
customers fairly. 
In July, we were registered with the 
Lending Standards Board (LSB). The LSB 
works with registered firms to promote fair 
lending practices and sets the benchmark 
for good lending practice in the UK.  Overview

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
Group governance
From 2017, the Group will operate on a 
country basis with country chief executive 
officers and local leadership teams 
responsible for profit and loss, with central 
Group functions responsible for setting 
strategy, origination, capital allocation and 
treasury, maintaining the risk framework, 
monitoring performance and facilitating 
best practice.
This structure better suits a European 
group operating in multiple geographies 
with different regulatory regimes and a mix 
of international and local clients.
The board
2016 saw a significant change following 
Tom Drury’s decision to step down as Group 
chief executive officer after five extremely 
successful years with Arrow.
Tom has made an outstanding 
contribution to Arrow since he joined the 
Group as chief executive officer in 2011.  
He led the successful IPO in 2013 and has 
overseen a series of strategic acquisitions, 
which have seen Arrow grow to become  
one of Europe’s leading purchasers and 
managers of debt, alongside driving a 
significant increase in shareholder value. 
On behalf of the board, I would like to 
thank Tom for his contribution to Arrow 
and wish him well for the future. 
Lee Rochford, formerly chief financial 
officer of Virgin Money, replaced Tom as 
Group chief executive officer and executive 
director from 3 January 2017 . Lee brings a 
tremendous breadth and depth of experience 
across all of our asset classes and an 
extensive track record in financial services. 
I am confident that he is the right person  
to lead the Group through the next stage  
of its growth. 
A number of other changes also took place: 
We welcomed Maria Luís Albuquerque 
as non-executive director in March and have 
benefitted from her European banking  
and Portuguese experience. 
In October, Robin Phipps stepped down 
from the board having completed a 
three-year term and leaves with the board’s 
gratitude for his contribution to the success 
of the Company.
To replace Robin, we welcomed  
Andrew Fisher as a non-executive director 
in December 2016. Andrew is currently  
the finance director of FTSE 100 Provident 
Financial Plc and his broad international 
financial services experience will complement 
the existing skills and competencies on  
the board and be invaluable to the Group. 
I believe the board has the calibre,  
skills and judgment to support the Group 
in its strategic ambitions. Overview

A progressive dividend policy
The solid foundations we have laid for the 
Group have seen us prosper and as such,  
we have proposed a final dividend of 6.4p, 
bringing the full-year dividend to 9.1p 
(2015: 7.1p), which is a significant uplift of 
28.7% on 2015. 
Looking forward
We are pleased with the growth we  
have achieved and the progress made in 
transforming the Group in 2016. 
We are well positioned for 2017. Our 
business model, strategy and strong financial 
profile give us the flexibility to continue  
to deliver for shareholders in the face of the 
changing economic and competitive 
environment. As a board, we have assessed 
the viability of the business over a three-
year period. Based on this assessment, we 
believe we are very well placed to make  
the most of the opportunities that exist and 
we can look to the future with confidence.
I would like to thank my fellow board 
members, the senior leadership team and 
all colleagues for their contribution to 
everything we have achieved together  
in 2016.
Embedding the behaviours that  
underpin our culture
In 2016, we developed an important 
programme defining the set of values that 
underpins our culture. We are embedding 
these values and behaviours in each of the 
countries we operate. Although our 
European markets have different cultural, 
regulatory and economic conditions,  
we believe passionately in operating as one 
team. We have more to do, but it is a great 
example of the collaborative and inclusive 
leadership of our senior team as they 
embrace this challenge. 
As the Group has expanded, we have 
refreshed our thinking on our purpose and 
the role we play in building better financial 
futures for our stakeholders. We are acutely 
aware that at the heart of our business is 
the need to work in partnership with those 
struggling with debt, helping them repay 
their debts in a timely and affordable way. 
Only by focusing on doing the right thing 
for all our stakeholders can we build a 
sustainable, profitable and customer-focused 
business (you can read more about  
our purpose, aim, strategy and values  
on page 8).

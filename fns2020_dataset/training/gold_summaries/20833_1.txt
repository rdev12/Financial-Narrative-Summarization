 Chief Executive’s review
Well positioned for improving market conditions
“ 2011 was an exceptionally challenging year for Amlin in which  
the quality and professionalism of our service to clients was amply 
demonstrated. While catastrophe claims were a primary focus during 
the year, importantly, we continued to make strategic progress. Our 
strong balance sheet and leading market position means that we are 
already benefiting from the improved trading environment and are  
well placed to resume the delivery of good returns for shareholders.” 
 Charles Philipps, Chief Executive
Key highlights in 2011
  Outlook improving with 13.8% average 
rate increase in catastrophe reinsurance 
at January renewals
  Difficult and volatile investment markets
  Many insurance classes traded at bottom 
of insurance cycle
  Capital of £402.7 million above assessed 
capital requirement at 31 December 
2011 despite £500.8 million of net 
catastrophe losses in the year
  Delivery of exceptional catastrophe

Europe
  Continued investment in future growth 
through niche acquisitions and 
recruitment
  Preparation completed for Solvency II 
internal model approval application
The combination of an extreme frequency  
and severity of natural catastrophes at a low 
point in the insurance cycle, a difficult climate 
for investments and poor performance from 
ACI resulted in 2011 being the worst year  
on record for Amlin since 2001. However,  
our strong strategic and financial positioning, 
together with actions taken to address the poor 
performance at ACI, leaves us well placed to 
grow in the healthier underwriting environment 
which is emerging. 
Amlin has continued to make considerable 
progress in enhancing operational and risk 
management practices so that it is well 
prepared for the introduction of Solvency II. 
Through active claims management associated 
with 2011’s catastrophes, we have reinforced 
our exceptionally strong reputation among 
brokers and clients.
Financial results
The main driver of the pre-tax loss, of  
£193.8 million, were seven significant 
catastrophes, including major earthquakes  
in New Zealand and Japan and extreme 
flooding in Thailand. These events are 
estimated to be three of the ten costliest 
insured loss events in global history.  
The US also witnessed two of its largest  
ever tornadoes. Amlin’s net catastrophe  
losses in 2011 totalled £500.8 million,  
with £255.2 million expected to be  
recovered from outwards reinsurance and 
reinstatement premium.
Amlin is one of the leading reinsurers in Lloyd’s 
and the London Market, as well as in Bermuda. 
As was the case in 2010, catastrophe activity 
was weighted towards international rather than 
US accounts, where Amlin has a more

developed book of business than many of our 
competitors. The broad geographic spread  
of our catastrophe exposures has resulted  
in robust performance over many years, with 
£662.8 million of profit generated over the 
past ten years, including 2011. However, in 
years such as 2011, where our models suggest 
the frequency and severity of activity should 
occur less than once in every thirty years,  
we will incur significant claims. 
Amlin London’s underwriting result of a  
£13.9 million loss with a combined ratio  
of 102%, after £247.3 million of catastrophe 
losses net of reinsurance recoveries and 
reinstatement premiums, demonstrates the 
solid underlying performance of its diverse 
account where 33.6% of its premium income  
is catastrophe and property reinsurance.  
Amlin Bermuda’s loss of £58.1 million and a 
combined ratio of 112% largely reflects the fact 
that since its start up in 2005, it has purchased 
less retrocessional reinsurance protection than 
Amlin London, but it is also a more catastrophe 
oriented business.
Amlin UK continued to grow its income, 
assisted by the acquisition of J R Clare  
whose accounts performed well. Its full year 
underwriting loss of £7.9 million and combined 
ratio of 103% was better than in the first half  
of the year, helped by improving margins on its 
fleet motor account and the prudent reaction 
to unusual prior year claims development  
on its property and motor accounts at the half 
year proving to be over cautious.
ACI and Amlin France performed poorly with 
underwriting losses and combined ratios of 
£56.0 million and £10.6 million and 112% and 
124% respectively. Amlin France was affected 
by exposure to overseas French property 
interests which suffered losses from the 
February New Zealand and March Japanese 
earthquake and the Thai floods, without which 
performance would have been satisfactory. 
ACI’s marine business performed considerably 
worse than expected, while its non-marine 
businesses delivered respectable results  
given the competitive nature of their markets. 
With the considerable changes and corrective 
action taken at ACI’s marine business over  
the previous two years, we started 2011 with 
the expectation of seeing an improvement  
on 2010’s performance. It was materially 
adversely affected, however, by three principal 
factors. These were an exceptional level of 
large claims, claims on long term contracts, 
(particularly in the commodities cargo account, 
which expire in 2012), and the need to 
strengthen reserves on its long tail shipbuilding 
account, where it became evident that ACI had 
taken more profit than it should have done in 
2007 and 2008. 
Amlin Re Europe, our new Zurich based 
European reinsurer, was well received by 
brokers and clients and wrote £107.4 million 
of premium income in its first full year, 81.6% 
of the Group’s overall growth in premiums. 
However, with only £50.9 million of its net 
premium income having been earned in  
2011 and a full year of operating expenses,  
it contributed an underwriting loss of  
£2.6 million and a combined ratio of 105%,  
a respectable result for a start up year.
The combination of low interest rates and,  
in the latter part of the year, the growing 
Eurozone crisis, made the generation of an 
investment return difficult, whilst managing our 
portfolios against a risk of a reversal in long 
term interest rate trends and a banking crisis. 
In this environment we were pleased to end 
the year in positive territory. 
Strategically we have focused over the years  
in maintaining a strong balance sheet which 
has the propensity to fund a dividend in the 
event of a year such as 2011. Accordingly,  
the dividend has been maintained at 23.0p  
per share and, if we return to a more normal 
year in terms of major loss events, we expect 
to return to our policy of steadily increasing  
the dividend in 2012.
Amlin’s five and ten year average returns  
on equity, of 14.7% and 18.0% respectively, 
remain near to and above our cross cycle target 
of 15%, despite the loss incurred in 2011.
Positioning for 2012
Whilst we do not expect the circumstances  
of 2011 to be repeated frequently, it is 
important that we learn and adjust to improve 
the balance of risk and reward for the future. 
As 2011 unfolded, we focused our attention 
on two critical areas: firstly, what we could 
have done differently or better in our 
catastrophe exposure management; and 
secondly, what further action we could take  
at ACI to ensure that it meets our required 
return on equity of 15%.
Amlin’s largest 2011 catastrophe loss was  
the February earthquake in New Zealand.  
This was an extraordinary event in terms of its 
damage to Christchurch and in an area where 
the modelling of events is less well developed. 
While the Group’s loss from this event was 
within our risk tolerance and New Zealand 
modelled loss scenarios, our market share  
of the loss was higher than we consider 
appropriate given market conditions. We have 
reviewed all market shares globally and have 
decided to downsize in a limited number of 
areas where we are overweight, unless the 
pricing of risk is sufficiently strong to justify an 
above average position. However we remain as 
focused as ever on our strategy of maintaining 
a diverse and balanced book of risk.
Amlin London’s retrocessional reinsurance 
programme responded well to the frequency  
Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements
19
Amlin plc Annual Report 2011 of events in 2011, but Amlin Bermuda, which 
has operated since its creation in 2005 with 
less protection, suffered from the combination 
of frequency and severity of events in 2011. 
For 2012, the protection purchased for Amlin 
Bermuda is much more in line with that for 
Amlin London, and we have reduced the first 
loss retention for Amlin London. We have also 
issued our first catastrophe insurance bond  
in the capital markets, which provides an 
additional $150 million of protection against 
extreme severity and/or frequency of events  
in the US and Europe in a calendar year.  
The bond has a three year duration. 
The purchase of this new reinsurance 
programme has reduced our expected loss 
from a modelled 1 in 50 and 1 in 100 year 
event from £293 million and £344 million 
respectively to £240 million and £288 million 
respectively. 
While reinsurance expenditure as a proportion 
of premium income is expected to increase  
to 15.3% in 2012, inwards rates have reacted 
to last years’ events and we expect full year 
inwards premium income to more than 
compensate for the additional cost, leaving 
Amlin in a better risk reward position than in 
2011. Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda’s 
combined reinsurance income was up 18.4% 
at the end of January compared to the same 
period in 2011.
Action continued to be taken to strengthen 
ACI, particularly its marine division which has 
been the source of its underwriting losses since 
acquisition. A further €192.0 million of poorly 
performing business has been non renewed  
in 2011 and 2012 to date across the division, 
principally in its cargo accounts. This included 
one material multi year cargo liability contract 
from which ACI had been unable to withdraw 
previously, which had incurred an average  
loss ratio of 155% over the five years prior  
to cancellation. 
Further reviews were undertaken of ACI’s 
portfolios and new line guides were put in 
place with a view to reducing volatility. Also, 
increased co-operation was achieved between 
our London marine underwriters and those  
at ACI. This was further enhanced in the latter 
part of the year with the appointment of David 
Harris, International Development Director and 
the former Managing Director of Amlin 
Underwriting Limited, to head up ACI marine 
on an interim basis. During November and 
December, in preparation for the 1 January 
2012 renewals, leading class underwriters 
from London provided guidance and review  
of ACI marine hull and cargo risks, with a focus 
on quality of selection, adequacy of pricing and 
coverage provided.
Management was further strengthened  
in June with the appointment of a new CEO  
at ACI, Kim Hvirgel, who had previously been 
CEO of Codan, Royal and Sun Alliance’s 
subsidiary in Denmark, and with a new CFO, 
Reijer Groenveld, previously at ABN Amro,  
in December. Kim has made a noticeable 
impact since joining, improving accountability, 
transparency and controls, as well as ACI’s 
overall alignment with Amlin’s objectives. 
There remains a risk that ACI will continue  
to suffer from claims on policies written prior 
to its acquisition in 2009 and from some multi 
year contracts which it has been unable to 
re-underwrite or cancel. However, most of  
the poorly performing multi year contracts  
will expire in 2012 and reserves have been 
increased to help address the risk of further 
adverse claims development on prior years. 
With the action taken ACI’s 2012 combined 
ratio is expected to move towards 100%.
Capital
While net tangible assets reduced 22.3%  
to £1,201.5 million in 2011, after deducting 
£42.0 million spent on goodwill and intangibles 
associated with acquisitions and dividends  
paid of £113.6 million, the Group’s capital 
position remains strong and capable of 
supporting further growth as market conditions 
improve. Capital and available resources  
at 31 December 2011, before the proposed 
final dividend in respect of 2011, were  
£402.7 million in excess of the Group’s 
assessed capital requirements. 
Looking forward, assuming our internal  
model approval is obtained, the Group  
remains well capitalised against its anticipated 
Solvency II requirements.
With our 2010 results we announced that  
we had allocated up to £75 million for share 
buy-backs. However, following the major 
earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand,  
we decided to retain this capital with a view  
to sustaining our ability to pay a dividend  
and grow. 
Strategy and business development
A key focus of management has been on 
turning around ACI’s performance and helping 
to bring its risk management and controls  
up to our desired standards. Until this is 
completed and we are able to demonstrate a 
marked improvement in its results we do not 
intend to pursue further major acquisitions. 
However, we remain on the look out for 
smaller bolt-on acquisitions in niches which 
can augment our strategy of balancing 
catastrophe exposure with more attritional  
risk. In January 2011, Amlin UK acquired  
the agency of J R Clare which increased  
its UK property account by £35.1 million  
and in February 2011, Amlin London acquired 
Lead Yacht, the leading specialist super-yacht 
underwriting agency outside the US. Amlin UK 
also supported the acquisition of R L Davison 
by Miles Smith, a broker in which it has a 
minority investment. With this acquisition, 
Miles Smith is now one of the UK’s largest 
wholesale brokers and a growing source  
of business for Amlin UK. 
Amlin Re Europe, which started trading in 
October 2010, has successfully built up its 
team in Zurich to comprise 37 employees, 
including 16 senior underwriters. A further  
13 hires are planned in 2012. Having written 
approximately £100 million of new business in 
2011, its January 2012 income was up 32.3% 
to £136.0 million. We believe that this business 
has the potential to grow to some £300 million 
of premium income over the next three years 
as it continues to build its reputation and 
penetration of its target European client base.
Organic growth has also been augmented 
through attracting further experienced 
underwriting talent, particularly in Amlin 
London and Amlin UK, which were joined  
by eight senior underwriters during 2011. 
We have strengthened resources in our 
Corporate Centre to increase our ability  
to manage a larger and broader group,  
and to address the increasing requirements  
of regulation, in particular for Solvency II.  
Chief Executive’s review continued
20 This has included the creation of a Group 
Underwriting function, whose role is to monitor 
the quality of underwriting and adherence to 
Amlin’s underwriting policies and standards 
across the Group, and to enforce improvement 
where it is necessary. ACI has clearly been the 
focus of most of its attention to date and this 
function will provide us with a better ability to 
ensure that future acquisitions quickly adopt 
Amlin’s standards.
Our major change programme in preparation 
for Solvency II was largely completed in 
2011, so that enhanced risk management 
and reporting will become business as usual 
in 2012. We are working with regulators  
to gain approval of our capital models  
and starting to realise benefits from the 
investment made over the last two years.  
For example, our modelling capability  
now better informs decisions on outwards 
reinsurance and the allocation of risk 
appetite between our operating divisions.
Given our Vision of becoming the  
“global reference point for quality”  
in insurance, we were pleased that the  
work done by our claims team in London  
was clearly recognised in the most recent  
survey of brokers carried out by Gracechurch 
Consulting ( pp28).
Outlook
In contrast to the start of 2011, when 
downward pressure on pricing was increasing, 
we are now seeing signs of a better rating 
environment emerging. This was reflected in 
average renewal rate increases to 31 January 
2012 of 4.0% compared to average reductions 
of 1.3% in January 2011.
Responding to last year’s losses,  
catastrophe reinsurance rates have continued 
to strengthen both in the United States and 
internationally, with 1 January renewal rate 
rises of 14.5% and 15.9% respectively. As 
expected, loss affected areas have increased 
the most and we expect the April Japanese 
renewals to see significant rises.
Amlin UK is continuing to achieve rate rises  
on its motor business, and following average 
renewal rate increases in 2011 of 7.4%,  
is expecting a double digit average increase  
in the current year. UK property rates are also 
starting to show signs of positive movement 
and we expect liability rates to start to improve 
during 2012.
Within the US property and casualty market,  
1 January renewal rates increased 4.3% for our 
US property account with casualty renewal 
rates flat. We expect a gradual improvement  
in rates through 2012. In most other 
accounts, renewal rates are flat.
While pricing in some areas where renewal 
rates are flat already offers acceptable 
margins, such as in our London marine 
business, other areas, such as the European 
insurance accounts, remain highly competitive, 
although we expect increasing financial 
distress and lower investment returns to result 
in a positive turn, at some stage.
With the steps taken to enhance our 
underwriting teams in Amlin UK and Amlin 
London in particular, and with our strong 
capital position, we are well placed to grow 
income in classes of business where margins 
are becoming more attractive. We also 
anticipate growth in Amlin Re Europe as it 
builds on its successful start in 2011.
As the upward turn in the insurance cycle 
broadens to more of our less catastrophe 
exposed classes of business, including in 
Europe, this will again allow us to increase 
appetite for catastrophe risk, providing  
the prospect of the high returns on capital 
historically delivered.
While investment returns in the year to date 
have been good, with 1.8% achieved to the 
end of February, the economic and political 
environment is far from stable and interest 
rates are expected to remain low for the 
foreseeable future. We will therefore continue 
to adopt a cautious approach and do not 
expect returns to recover to the levels that 
were the norm only a few years ago.
Overall, with the underlying profitability  
of our core business in London in 2011, 
increasing rates in reinsurance and UK  
motor in particular, the expectation of better 
performance at ACI and the capital to support 
our planned growth in premiums in 2012, we 
expect to return to a good level of profitability 
in 2012. 
People
2011 was a tough year for many of our 
employees, in particular those involved  
in managing claims from the catastrophes  
and associated underwriting adjustments,  
the changes implemented in preparation  
for Solvency II and at ACI, where work  
on their systems replacement overlaid actions 
to improve processes and controls as well  
as improve performance. The staff turnover  
of 5.8%, combined with progress achieved, 
demonstrates a resilience and loyalty as well  
as the ambition of our employees to make 
Amlin the “global reference point for quality  
in each of our markets”. I thank them for  
their achievements.
As indicated in his Chairman’s statement, 
Roger Taylor has decided to retire as 
Chairman, having served in that capacity since 
the merger of Angerstein and Murray Lawrence 
to create Amlin in 1998. Roger has been  
a constant source of helpful guidance and 
support to me and to my senior management 
colleagues and we owe him our sincere 
gratitude for helping us build Amlin to what it is 
today. He will be succeeded by Richard Davey, 
who has been on our Board since 2005 and I 
look forward to working closely with him over 
the coming years.

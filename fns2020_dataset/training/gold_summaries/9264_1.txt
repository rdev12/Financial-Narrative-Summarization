 08 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Consolidating 
our position
Although our yards remained busy throughout 2012 
and generated revenues for the year of USD 1,045 
million, the Group suffered a loss before tax and 
exceptional items of USD 105 million as a result  
of a series of operational hurdles, the failure to 
appreciate certain project risk and project delays. 
The challenges that Lamprell 
experienced in 2012 led to major 
changes within the Company, including 
a complete change of leadership  
and a comprehensive review of our 
projects and operations. With a new 
management team in place and a 
number of improvements to our 
business processes underway, we are 
now conﬁdent that Lamprell is well 
placed to overcome these challenges 
and leverage its leading market position 
to return to proﬁtability.
2012 challenges/overview
Starting in mid-2012, Lamprell 
experienced signiﬁcant delays  
on several of its largest projects, 
including the wind farm installation 
vessels Windcarrier 1 and 2 for Fred 
Olsen, as well as the jackup rig that 
was built in modular form in the UAE 
and is being assembled at a facility  
in Astrakhan, Russia. As the year 
progressed, it became clear that 
these delays would result in material 
ﬁnancial losses. However, the 
previous management team struggled 
to quantify the losses or prevent the 
situation from deteriorating further.
As a result of the departure of the 
previous senior management team  
in October 2012, Lamprell’s Board 
asked me to rejoin on an interim basis 
to assess the full extent of the issues

facing the Company, and to help 
stabilise its operations while it recruited 
a new, permanent management team. 
With the Board’s support, the interim 
management team conducted a 
comprehensive assessment of 
Lamprell’s operations, with a primary 
focus on the key underperforming 
projects and their effect on the  
Group’s ﬁnancial position. The results  
of the assessment, published on  
19 November 2012, revealed a series  
of operational and ﬁnancial issues 
contributing to major losses in 2012.
One of the cornerstones of Lamprell’s 
success has always been its rigorous 
approach to project execution. Since 
my retirement as Lamprell’s CEO in 
2009, the Company’s business has 
undergone signiﬁcant change; over 
the past several years, the Company’s 
operations have grown signiﬁcantly  
as the Group has taken on a number 
of increasingly large and complex 
projects. This has generated higher 
revenues but the growth came at  
a price as the Company’s existing 
project management systems were 
unable to cope with these larger 
projects of a prototype nature. This 
left Lamprell struggling to fulﬁl its 
commitments to its stakeholders.
Having established the scale of the 
problems and identiﬁed key areas  
of weakness, my team negotiated 
revised delivery schedules for the key 
underperforming projects still under 
construction, and fully focused its 
efforts on their completion under these 
new terms. In spite of the ﬁnancial 
setbacks arising from certain key 
projects, Lamprell continued to deliver 
major projects to a consistently high 
standard, including the ﬁrst two new 
build jackup rigs to NDC, as well as the 
Seajacks “Zaratan” and the Windcarrier 
1 Brave Tern liftboats. Most recently, 
and perhaps most signiﬁcantly, the 
Group fulﬁlled its promises to deliver  
the Windcarrier 2 Bold Tern vessel to 
the client in mid-February 2013. This 
only became possible as a result of 
improved project management and 
strict ﬁnancial controls, as well as the 
dedication and commitment of the 
project team who worked tirelessly  
on this complex project.
New contract awards
The recent operating environment has 
been demanding, both because of 
the Company’s internal issues which 
we are now resolving and also due  
to the increasingly competitive nature 
of the sectors in which the Company 
operates. Nevertheless, the Company 
managed to maintain the support  
of its clients and was awarded more 
than USD 930 million in new contract 
wins during 2012. This included 
various, major new build projects in 
both the oil and gas industry, such as 
two more fully outﬁtted and equipped 
LeTourneau rigs for our key client, 
NDC, and the fabrication of two 
topsides and jackets for a new client, 
and the renewables sector where 
Seajacks awarded us a new contract 
for a fourth liftboat vessel, of a similar 
design as those already delivered 
to Seajacks.
The rig refurbishment market for both 
the onshore and offshore segments 
remained positive in 2012, which 
allowed Lamprell to win multiple 
orders for jackup rig upgrade and 
refurbishment projects. This has 
historically been a keystone for our 
franchise and we continue to be the 
regional leader by market share for 
this type of business.
Saudi Arabia joint venture
In another positive development, in 
September 2012 Lamprell signed a joint 
venture agreement with Shoaibi Group, 
a Saudi industry and energy services 
provider, and Al Yusr Townsend and 
Bottum, a Saudi integrated logistical 
services provider, to form Lamprell 
Arabia Ltd. The joint venture, which  
will be based in the oil-rich Eastern 
province of Saudi Arabia, intends to 
establish a presence for fabrication, 
refurbishment and repair of land drilling 
rigs. I am excited by the opportunities 
presented by the joint venture which 
builds on the Group’s existing business 
in a country where we foresee extensive 
needs for such services, which are a 
core part of our offering.
Our people
Our employees are the foundation of 
our business. Their hard work over 
the past four decades has built 
Lamprell into the business we are 
proud of today, and their wellbeing is 
essential for the continued success of 
our Company. Since my return to the 
business in October 2012, a primary 
focus has been to re-energise the 
workforce, with a view to improving 
morale and thereby increasing 
productivity. These efforts have 
produced results such as delivery  
of the Windcarrier 2 vessel on the 
promised revised delivery date.
At the same time, we have been 
forced to take some tough decisions 
to control costs in the Group at a time 
when it was struggling ﬁnancially.  
This put additional pressure on our 
operations and has been a delicate 
balance to manage. However, once 
we re-established control over the  
key operational issues, we have  
been able to reassure our staff of  
the attractiveness of Lamprell as an 
employer. Today, Lamprell employs 
over 11,000 staff.
Ongoing changes and outlook
In 2012 we encountered numerous 
operational and ﬁnancial problems, 
which forced us to reassess how  
we run our business. The interim 
management team has introduced 
new initiatives aimed at strengthening 
Lamprell’s project reporting systems, 
organisational structure, ﬁnancial 
controls and risk management. One 
such initiative was the introduction of 
a new organisational structure which 
prioritised project management and 
aligned project execution with the 
Group’s reporting structures.
These initiatives will take some time  
to bed down into the business but,  
as I pass the mantle of leadership to 
the permanent CEO, James Moffat,  
I am proud of the genuine progress 
that we have made over the last six 
months and I believe that the outlook 
for our business remains strong for 
2013 and beyond.

Chief Executive’s Review
As I join Lamprell as its 
new Chief Executive,  
I see a business with  
an attractive regional 
footprint and signiﬁcant 
potential where several, 
very serious issues 
undermined its ﬁnancial 
health in 2012 and 
threatened its ability to 
win and execute work. 
Despite this, the Company 
managed to retain the 
trust of its clients and its 
leading market position 
and that is a testament to 
the fundamentals of this 
business and its historic 
ability to execute projects.
Improving
our performance 11 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Health, Safety, Environment and 
Security (“HSES”), in particular safety, 
has always been a core value for me. 
Hence I was pleased to see that, 
despite the operational challenges 
faced by the Group in 2012 as well  
as increasing the total number of 
manhours worked to over 37 million, 
Lamprell maintained and in fact 
improved its strong safety track record. 
The total recordable incident rate 
(“TRIR”) in 2012 declined by nearly 80% 
over 201 1, having already improved by 
58% in 201 1 over the previous year. 
This is a signiﬁcant achievement.
Given the nature of our business there 
are inherently signiﬁcant health, safety 
and environment risks and despite our 
recent successes we must continue  
to improve. To this end, I have already 
tasked the management to implement 
several new HSES strategic objectives 
and key initiatives such as personal 
HSES contracts and hazard 
identiﬁcation, which I expect to deliver 
results during 2013. Across the Group,  
I will be driving a culture where HSES 
will be a key consideration in making 
everyday decisions, both at a corporate 
and at an individual level.
The interim management team has 
done a great deal to stabilise Lamprell’s 
operations and ﬁnancial position after 
the events of 2012. Our key priority  
this coming year is to implement and 
complete the initiatives introduced by 
them, in order to avoid similar issues  
in the future, and to position the 
Company for the next stage in its 
development. We will continue to 
improve operations by increasing focus 
on risk management, project execution 
and ﬁnancial controls.
I would like to thank Peter and  
his team for their efforts during the 
challenging transition period, and  
I look forward to working closely with 
them to rebuild Lamprell’s reputation 
for operational excellence and 
proﬁtable growth.

 I took over as Group Chief Executive in
June 2002 and as this is my ﬁrst report 
to shareholders it is pleasing to be 
able to report on a successful year for 
Alliance & Leicester.
In 2002 Alliance & Leicester made excellent
progress against all its strategic objectives
whilst delivering a good set of results. Pre-tax
proﬁt was up 18% to £468m, and our core
proﬁt, before strategic costs, was up 8% at
£519m. Earnings per share (EPS) increased
by 21%, and the Board has proposed 
a ﬁnal dividend of 26.9p per share, 
making a total dividend of 39.9p, an
increase of 10%. 
Commentators often refer to Alliance &
Leicester as a low risk bank. In all the
business sectors in which we lend we aim 
to be at the prudent end of the credit
spectrum. However, lending money to
customers can never be viewed as a zero 
risk business, and the economic environment
we face in 2003 is more uncertain, with
much of the world economy entering 2003
in a somewhat depressed state. Although
the UK economy held up well in 2002 on
the back of a strong consumer sector, 
and the housing market remained very
strong, we will continue to be alert to
economic risks in 2003 and will maintain 
our cautious stance. Our current planning is
based on the consensus of market forecasts
which currently forecast GDP growth of
between 2 – 2.5% in 2003. We expect single
ﬁgure increases in average house prices –
although that may mask house price
decreases in some localised areas.
Strategic Objectives
Our primary aim remains the maximisation
of shareholder value. We have three
strategic objectives to enable us to achieve
this and have made excellent progress
against each of these objectives in 2002: 
• revenue growth in 2002 was 5.7% 
(like for like, excluding income from the
rationalisation of properties), exceeding
our target of 4%;
• we achieved our targeted cost savings 
of £20m; 
• and we made signiﬁcant progress in
improving our capital efﬁciency by
reducing our regulatory tier 1 capital
ratio to 7.6%.
Over the next two years we have one new
primary target, which is to deliver double
digit percentage growth in basic earnings
per share. This target is supported by our
existing goals relating to revenue growth,
costs and the management of our capital. 
Customer Focus 
Our vision remains that of being “the 
most customer focused ﬁnancial services
provider in the UK – bar none”. We are
making good progress towards that vision,
and all that we do within the business is
driven by our brand values. We aim to
attract new potential customers by 
offering them a “better value” proposition,
to convert potential customers into 
actual customers by being “simple and
straightforward” to deal with, to keep
customers and encourage them to buy
more from us by offering “friendly and
approachable” service, and by appropriate
“management of the customer relationship”.
We have simpliﬁed our marketing 
material across the Group, introducing 
a cost-effective, clearer and more
consistent approach. Our branding
emphasises the “real plus” which we can
provide to the customer, re-inforced by 
the visual ‘plus’ symbol within our logo. 
In addition, later in 2003 we intend that
our Commercial Banking brands, currently
marketed under the names of Girobank,
Sovereign Finance and Alliance & Leicester
Business Banking, will be consolidated
under the name Alliance & Leicester
Commercial Bank.
Retail Banking
Our Retail Banking business had an
excellent year in 2002. Pre-tax proﬁt of
£432m was up 14%, income was up over
5%, costs were down 2% and asset quality
remains very strong.
During 2002 we focused Retail Banking’s
resources on mortgages, unsecured personal
loans, current accounts and savings. We refer
to these four products as the “Core 4”.

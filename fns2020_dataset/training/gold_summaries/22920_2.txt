LIGHTING SIGNALS AND COMPONENTS
Overview of the business
Dialight is an innovative lighting solutions company that 
manufactures and sells lighting products in the industrial 
market. They are designed to work in harsh environments 
and enhance productivity while providing sustainable 
energy management solutions. 
Growth drivers 
The total addressable industrial market is estimated to be 
£50bn with only 3% cumulative conversion to LED. We believe 
the LED market will grow at a rapid pace with the overall 
market tailwinds and LED conversions becoming common 
as traditional lighting is phased out.
Operational key points 
Restructuring of our manufacturing processes through a 
manufacturing partnership will support our growth initiatives. 
We develop our own power supply units, which allows us to 
provide an industry leading ten-year warranty.  
Overview of the business
The Signals and Components division sells electronic 
components, traffic lights and niche vehicle lights. In 
Traffic and Transportation, Dialight provides LED lighting for 
signals, while the Components businesses include sales to 
electronic original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) for 
status indication and components for automotive and niche 
industrial applications.
Growth drivers 
This is a mature and stable market characterised by significant 
competition. We have been able to maintain our sales volumes 
while the Group manages this business for value.
Operational key points 
We have a stable portfolio of products that continue to 
be managed for value. Operational improvements ensure 
stability of margin in a market where sales prices are 
under threat.

 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 2
Chairman’s Statement
Sir Michael Heller
Turnover for the year to 30 September 2016 
was £4.96 million compared with £5.16 million 
the previous year. This resulted from a quiet 
end to the financial year as decisions on a 
discrete number of sales opportunities were 
delayed by customers. This is dealt with 
further in the Chief Executive’s statement.
Adjusted operating profit (which excludes 
non-cash IFRS items and exceptional 
non-trading costs and is reconciled to statutory 
profit before tax in note 3 to the consolidated 
financial statements) was £430,000, compared 
with £459,000 last year. The reduction in 
turnover was largely offset by improved 
margins and lower overheads.
Statutory pre-tax profit for the year was 
£244,000 (2015: £347,000) after charges 
of £114,000 in relation to property matters 
which are referred to below. 
Contracted recurring revenues, which 
comprise income from annual software 
licence fees and hosting subscription charges, 
amounted to 82% of total revenue compared 
with 79% in the previous year. Revenues 
generated through the hosting centre also 
increased to 59% of total revenues, up 
from 51%.
R&D expenditure for the year was 
£982,000 (2015: £1,067,000) as we 
continued to enhance our key products, 
Quantum VS and Vecta.
I am pleased to confirm that since the 
year end we have completed the sale of our 
surplus freehold property in Milton Keynes 
for £1.2 million. Net of disposal costs the 
proceeds amounted to £1.17 million. This 
resulted in a £10,000 reduction in the carrying 
value of the property at the year end. As 
reported at the half year stage, we incurred 
an exceptional charge of £104,000 relating 
to repairs to the roof of this property 
following storm damage. 
This sale completes a process that we 
started some years ago, to dispose of six 
freehold properties which had become 
surplus to operating requirements. Overall 
this process has generated more than 
£7 million of cash which has supported 
distributions to shareholders totalling 
£11 million over the same period.
Operating cash flows were strong and at 
the year end cash and short-term deposits 
(classified as investments in the balance sheet) 
totalled £5.4 million (2015: £5.55 million). 
This is after dividends paid during the year 
of £631,000 but this does not include the 
cash from the property disposal which 
was received after the year end.
Net assets at 30 September 2016 were 
£3.19 million compared to £4.96 million at 
30 September 2015. The reduction is due 
to a further increase in the liability relating 
to our defined benefit pension scheme 
under IAS 19. Net of deferred tax we have 
made a non-cash provision during the year 
of £1.4 million following a further significant 
decrease in the discount rate used to value 
liabilities under IAS 19. This is discussed 
further in the Chief Executive’s Statement.
The Directors are proposing to pay a final 
dividend of 3.0p per share (2015: 3.0p) 
giving a total dividend for the year of 5.0p, 
the same as last year. Total cash dividends 
paid to shareholders will therefore amount 
to £631,000. If approved by shareholders, 
the final dividend will be paid on 6 April 2017 
to those shareholders on the register at 
10 March 2017. The shares will be 
ex-dividend on 9 March 2017. 
We announced earlier in the year that we 
are carrying out a strategic review of the 
business and that process is continuing. 
We will report the conclusions of the 
review to shareholders in due course.
I would like to thank all our members of 
staff and my colleagues on the Board for 
their contribution during the year.
With a robust, cash generative business 
model and a strong debt-free balance sheet 
I remain confident about the future.

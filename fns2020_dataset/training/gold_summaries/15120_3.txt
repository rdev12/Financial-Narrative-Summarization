 Chairman’s statement
for the year ended 31 May 2008
In the 12 months to 31 May 2008, the Company has achieved its financial targets for the year and has also met
a number of the strategic and operating milestones that the management had set themselves.
The Company started the 2008/09 financial year with a record order book; four automotive brake systems clients
that are ordering brake discs on a regular basis and improved prospects for further growth in the business. The
key achievements for the period under review were:
l Receipt of a 4 year, £300,000 to £400,000 p.a initial contract with a leading, global, brake systems group
for the supply of carbon fibre brake discs. 
l Award of a £150,000, 3 year development contract with MBDA, a world leading missile manufacturer jointly
owned by BAE Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica.
l Unit costs of ceramic brake discs are now 20% lower than levels in May 2007.
l The commencement of a development contract with a new, US based aircraft brake system supplier which
currently supplies both commercial and defence aircraft.
l Fundraising amounting to £897,000 net of expenses by the issue of new ordinary shares at 20 pence per
share as announced in July 2007. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
In the 12 months to 31 May 2008, revenue was £508,111 (2007: £266,789). This represents a 90% increase on
the same period in 2007. Increased automotive brake disc revenues account for most of the increase and now
represents over 80% of the Company’s revenue.
At 31 May 2008, the outstanding order book was £302,124 (2007: £126,097).
Losses after taxation for the 12 months period were £594,065 (2007: £646,422). 
Earnings per share was a loss of 3.33 pence per share (2007: 4.61pence per share).
During the year the Company raised £897,000 by way of an issue of ordinary shares at 20 pence per share.
Shareholder funds at 31 May 2008 were £1,722,839 (2007: £1,413,058) and this included cash deposits of
£1,112,719 (2007: £878,971).
Capital expenditure during the year amounted to £142,599 (2007: £193,382).
The Company has no borrowings.
DEVELOPMENTS
At present, the Company is currently in advanced discussions regarding a supply contract with a leading
European supplier of braking systems to the after-market industry. A further announcement regarding this will be
made in due course.
In addition, in April 2008, the Company signed a four year supply agreement to supply carbon fibre brake discs
to a global automotive brake system supplier.
The directors believe, based on forecasts prepared by the brakes system supplier, that this contract could generate
additional revenues of approximately £300,000 to £400,000 per annum over the life of the agreement and that
the Company has sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet this demand. This agreement demonstrates that
Surface Transforms has the expertise in advanced carbon fibres and industrial fabrics which can provide a
competitive edge in composite brake technology and takes the Company’s leading-edge products into the
forefront of the international automotive performance brake market.

PEOPLE
The Board would like to thank management and staff who have all contributed to the progress the Company has
made during the year. We continue to incentivise executives with share options as we wish to align their rewards
with those of shareholders.
OUTLOOK
We envisage further progress during the coming year.
The Board believes that Surface Transforms has established itself as an industry operator with world class
technology. The commercial and development contracts which have been signed in the past year underline this

In spite of the widely reported slowdown in world consumer and industrial markets, the Company continues to

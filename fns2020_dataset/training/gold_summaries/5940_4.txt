FiBERWEB gEOSYNTHETi CS Terram had a 
strong year, gaining market share in the UK, 
despite depressed geotextile markets in 
the UK and Europe. Export volumes to 
Russia and the middle East supported the 
business in this challenging time. The 
acquisition of Boddingtons in January 2011 
has doubled Fiberweb’s presence in 
geosynthetics and led to the creation of a 
business focused on this exciting area.
Fiberweb produces a diverse 
range of other products in 
packaging, shoes and home 
furnishing applications.

 CONSUmER FaBRiCS Benefiting from 
cost reduction actions taken in 2009 and 
continuing into 2010, margins improved 
on flat volumes. an intensified focus on 
operational efficiency drove further cost 
improvements in the second half and into 
2011. Utilisation remained high on most 
lines, with some weakness at the end of 
the year.
aiRlaid volumes grew strongly, as the 
utilisation of l ine 2 began to rise with 
new products and new customers.  
Some volumes of lighter-weight products 
have been transferred from l ine 1 to l ine 
2, allowing more efficient utilisation of 
both lines. Construction began on a small 
R&d centre at the airlaid site at Tianjin, 
China.
FiTESaFiBERWEB Jv 2010 was a highly 
successful first full-year for the Jv seeing 
improved loading on all lines, improved 
operational efficiencies and the successful 
construction of the $70 million new 
spunbond line at Simpsonville, SC. 
Organisational integration was completed 
early in the year and close cooperation on 
R&d and global key accounts between 
Fiberweb plc and FitesaFiberweb has 
helped deliver strong results.
Fiberweb is a global leader in 
tailored nonwoven fabric solutions 
for the baby and adult care, feminine

fitting, more comfortable and more 
aesthetic. The airlaid business is 
developing products that have 
superior absorbent properties.

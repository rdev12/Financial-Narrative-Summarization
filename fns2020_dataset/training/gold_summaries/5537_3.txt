 I am delighted to report on our results for the year to 30 September 2006 in which we have delivered a strong
financial performance through profit growth and a rolling share buy-back programme. 
EBITDA before exceptional items increased by 3.6% over the prior year to £547m and profit before tax and
exceptional items rose by 8.6% to £315 million. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 17.0% to 68.3 pence.
For the second consecutive year, the Board is recommending a 50% increase in the rate of dividend paid to
shareholders, giving a total for the year of 27.0 pence per share. Dividend cover based on adjusted earnings per
share is 2.5 times, in line with the policy described a year ago. The final dividend of 18.0 pence per share will be
payable on 22 January 2007 to shareholders on the register on 29 December 2006. 
Last year we announced our intention to commence a rolling share buy-back programme to return surplus cash
to shareholders and to ensure that the balance sheet remains efficient. Market purchases totalling 42.3 million
of our ordinary shares were made for an aggregate consideration of £393 million (excluding costs) which,
together with £70 million of dividends paid, resulted in a total of £463 million being returned to shareholders in
the year. In the absence of material pub acquisitions and subject to overall market conditions and shareholder
approval, we expect that at least this level of returns will be made in the year to 30 September 2007. Indeed,
since the year end we have purchased a further 6.0 million shares at a cost of £65 million.
Shareholders will be aware from the interim statement that Gordon Harrison, Operations Director had decided to
retire from the business at the end of September this year. The Board, in reiterating its thanks for his tremendous
contribution, wishes to record in this Annual Report its appreciation of all that he has done for the Company over
fifteen years. 
The past year has been a challenging one for the licensed trade but we have demonstrated that our strategy for
enhancing shareholder value, underpinned by the optimal use of the strong cash flows which are generated from
our quality pub estate, delivers attractive financial returns for shareholders. The Board looks forward to another
year of solid progress.

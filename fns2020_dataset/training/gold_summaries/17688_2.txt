revenue growth significantly above market rate

 Establish new growth platforms
We increased Net Promoter Score (NPS) by 6%, a consistent increase 
across all categories and consumer segments, expanded our range 
of kits and assays and made significant market gains in China
3
 Scale organisation capabilities
We transformed consumer marketing, made key hires into 
our senior leadership team and laid the strategic groundwork 
for extensive improvements to our IT platform
4
 Sustain attractive economics
We achieved constant exchange rate (CER) product revenue growth 
of 16.6% and an adjusted operating margin of 34.2%
5  Selectively pursue partnerships  
and acquisitions
We have built a significant network of collaborations and  
acquired Firefly BioWorks to support our continued growth  
through increased product quality, a broader product portfolio  
and increased consumer reach

£5.1 million and basic earnings  
per share more than doubling  
to 11.3 pence.

Chief Executive
 (a) extending our international reach as  
  evidenced by a growing underlying trend  
  of export sales (in 2013/14, exports  
  amounted to some 13% of divisional
  sales, with enquiries for export contracts  
  at record levels at the year end); and
 
 (b) investing in innovation and new product  
  development as described further in the  
  Review of Operations on page 10;
• we continue to invest in people and  
 innovation to underpin delivery of the  
 medium to longer term growth potential  
 of our business. The associated average  
 annual charge absorbed within our operating  
 profit over the last five years amounted  
 to £0.6 million, with a similar investment  
 planned for our 2014/15 financial year.
Health and Safety
The group’s number one priority continues 
to be providing a safe place of work for our 
employees. Progress has been made during 
the year in ensuring our strong health and 
safety ethos is fully embedded throughout our 
businesses. Our principal health and safety KPI, 
the performance rate index, was 4.9 versus 3.5 
in the previous year. The increase was mainly 
due to a specific incident in the Engineering 
Products division which resulted in a number 
of days being lost earlier in the year. However 
the 2013/14 PRI result was better than two 
years ago and in previous years and is therefore 
consistent with the longer term trend of 
improvement in the group’s health and safety 
performance over time. We were successful  
in increasing the reporting of near miss 
incidents throughout the group during  
Strategic overview
Alumasc’s strategic priorities are to:
• continue to invest in and grow our market
 leading portfolio of building products  
 businesses, both organically and through  
 acquisition; and
• continue to improve shareholder value 
 from the Engineering Products division. 
In the light of generally improving prospects, 
the Board is refreshing its appraisal of 
where Alumasc’s best opportunities lie for 
directing our resources in building value for 
shareholders. This may lead to further focusing 
of our strategy for growth described in more 
detail in the pages that follow. 
The business model and KPIs for Alumasc’s 
building products activities, which represent 
approximately 75% of group revenues, are  
set out on pages 8 to 9. 
This demonstrates: 
• strong positioning in sustainable building  
 products markets which, combined with  
 high quality management teams and  
 a devolved operating model, is allowing  
 us consistently to outperform growth rates  
 in the UK construction market;
• success in expanding our Building Products  
 division through:
the year and we are using this information 
to take action to prevent potential future 
accidents. We have also taken specific action  
to update and strengthen risk assessments, 
safe systems of work and training in those 
areas of our businesses judged to be those 
capable of causing the most serious accidents. 
Performance overview
The Board is pleased to report the group’s 
highest annual profit for five years. Underlying 
profit before tax advanced to £6.3 million 
compared with £5.9 million last year and 
statutory profit before tax increased substantially 
to £5.1 million (2012/13: £2.8 million).
This result was underpinned by strong 
growth in our “early cycle” building products 
businesses as the UK construction market 
began to recover, particularly those businesses 
serving the house building and refurbishment 
markets, and by a reduction in operating losses 
in our Engineering Products division. Underlying 
profit before tax was also assisted by reduced 
bank interest costs, as Alumasc’s average level 
of net borrowings was the lowest since the 
acquisition of Levolux in 2007. Statutory profit 
before tax benefited from lower non-recurring 
charges in 2013/14, as described further below.
Group revenues reduced to £113.4 million 
(2012/13: £116.8 million) mainly as a result 
of a lower level of activity on the significant 
£13 million aluminium smelter refurbishment 
project at Kitimat in Canada, where our works 
are now drawing towards completion, and the 
non-repeat of high prior year sales of insulated 
renders to Community Energy Savings Plan 
(“CESP”) projects that ceased early in 2013.  The Alumasc Group plc

Excluding the impact of these projects, the 
remaining Building Products divisional revenues 
grew by 2%. Engineering Products revenues 
increased by 5% overall to £31.0 million 
(2012/13: £29.4 million), following customer 
de-stocking in the prior year. 
Across the group, operating margins  
advanced by 0.3 percentage points compared 
to the prior financial year, mainly as a result  
of management action taken to eliminate 
prior year operating losses in our roofing 
business and to reduce operating losses in 
the Engineering Products division. Margins 
also benefited from successful execution of 
the large Kitimat project and from strong 
performances in our Rainwater, Drainage  
and Timloc businesses, described further  
in the review of operations on page 10. 
Together, this led to an improvement in 
Building Products’ divisional underlying 
operating margins to 10.0% (2012/13: 9.5%). 
The group’s underlying operating profit 
increased to £6.8 million (2012/13: £6.6 
million). In view of the lower Kitimat activity 
and revenues from Energy Company Obligation 
(“ECO”) projects falling well short of prior year 
sales to CESP projects, the Building Products 
division performed well overall in almost 
matching prior year operating profits of  
£8.4 million, thereby achieving management’s 
expectations set at the beginning of the 
financial year. Engineering Products divisional 
operating losses reduced from £0.5 million to 
£0.2 million, with another strong performance 
from Dyson Diecastings and the benefit from 
some additional direct sales in China. 
Interest costs on borrowings reduced by  
£0.2 million to £0.5 million with average levels 
of net debt on a cleared funds basis reducing 
from £13.7 million in the prior financial year  
to £11.1 million in 2013/14.
The resultant group underlying profit  
before tax improved to £6.3 million  
(2012/13: £5.9 million).
A reconciliation of underlying to reported  
profit before tax is shown on page 14.
Reported profit before tax of £5.1 million was 
a significant improvement on the prior year’s 
£2.8 million, mainly due to the non-repeat  
of £0.8 million of restructuring and acquisition 
costs and the £0.6 million impairment charge  
in the prior year. 
Group cash generation for the year was again 
strong with group EBITDA (earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) 
amounting to £9.0 million. A more detailed 
review of the group’s cash flow performance  
is provided in the Financial Review on page 14.
 
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share improved 
from 12.3 pence in 2012/13 to 13.3 pence, 
reflecting the higher underlying profit 
before tax combined with a reduction in the 
underlying tax rate from 26% to 24%, broadly 
in line with the reduction in UK corporation tax 
rates. The average number of shares in issue 
was unchanged in the year.
Reported earnings per share more than 
doubled from 5.3 pence to 11.3 pence,  
again reflecting higher profit before tax  
at a reduced tax rate.
Future prospects
Group order books began to rise again in the 
final quarter of the year driven by an uplift in 
orders for building products. This trend has 
continued to date in the current financial year. 
External industry forecasts for UK construction 
activity are for further recovery and growth.
Against this background, with the strength 
of Alumasc’s niche market positions and 
management teams, and with our ongoing 
investment in innovation, new product 
development and increasing export sales 
opportunities, Alumasc is well positioned  
to further grow its building products activities 
and improve shareholder value from its 
Engineering Products division. 
Dividends
In view of the improved group results for the 
year and strong cash generation, the Board  
is proposing an increased final dividend of  
2.8 pence per share (2012/13: 2.5 pence), to 
be paid on 5 November 2014 to shareholders 
on the register on 10 October 2014. This 
would give a total dividend for the year of 
5.0 pence per share (2012/13: 4.5 pence). 
More broadly, the Board confirms its previous 
intention to grow the dividend in conjunction 
with future earnings growth, having regard  
to the cash required to invest in the business  
to support delivery of the group’s strategic 
growth potential and its pension scheme 
funding commitments. The Alumasc Group plc

Strategic Report
Building Products’ Divisional Strategy and Business Model
Strategic objectives
To grow shareholder value through the development of a portfolio of premium building 
products activities, each a leading player in its individual market niche. These activities 
are mainly focused on managing the scarce resources of energy and water in the built 
environment, where we expect growth rates to outperform the UK construction sector  
on average through the economic cycle. 
Market outlook
Market commentators are predicting the UK construction market will recover steadily after  
a period of significant contraction during the recent recession. Alumasc plans to augment  
this opportunity through growth in export sales, particularly in our solar shading and 
construction products businesses, targeting divisional export revenues of 20%  
(currently just above 10%, excluding the Kitimat project) over the medium term. 
Divisional strategy
The divisional strategy is to harness our key strengths of strong market positions, strong 
management teams and well respected brands, together with a culture of innovation,  
service, quality and trust to deliver market leading and differentiated solutions to customers, 
specifiers and end users of buildings. These differentiated solutions should improve our 
capability to command strong margins and operating cash flows.
Divisional business model
The Building Products’ operating model is to recruit, retain, empower and motivate high 
quality, experienced management teams in each of our businesses; to ensure each business 
has an in-depth understanding of its market niche, customer base and routes to market;  
and is able to evolve and adapt rapidly to market developments and exploit opportunities  
for growth. 
Approach 
Management teams are 
encouraged to take an 
entrepreneurial, dynamic 
and innovative approach 
to developing their niche 
market positions. 
Aim
To grow faster than the  
UK construction market, on 
average, generating strong 
operating margins and 
returns on capital and to 
convert this efficiently 
into free cash flow
Re-investment to  
support growth
Throughout the recent 
recession we have re-invested 
c.£0.6 million pa, mainly in 
high quality people to drive 
innovation, new product 
development and further 
penetration of UK and 
international markets.
Operating models 
Operating models are designed to be 
flexible to gear revenues up or down in 
line with short term demand and to keep 
a close control of overheads such that 
the businesses benefit from operational 
gearing, whilst outsourcing capital intensive 
manufacturing activities where appropriate. 
The strategic positioning of our 
Building Products businesses has 
enabled growth to exceed UK 
construction market averages 
during the recession, making us 
well positioned to benefit from 
the forecast broader upturn in 
market activity.  The Alumasc Group plc

Progress against Building Products’ Divisional Strategy
In order to illustrate underlying trends, the impact of two abnormally large projects (Kitimat and CESP) has been extracted 
from the divisional data. This data illustrates the ongoing success in the execution of our strategy:
• Revenue growth rates are ahead of UK construction market averages
• We are generating strong operating margins, cash flows and returns on investment
• We continue to invest to support future growth
Divisional return on investment is strong,
reflecting the improving profitability 
of the division and the relatively low capital
intensity of our building products businesses.
Alumasc has consistently invested in people
and new product development through the
recession to help underpin continued 
realisation of the medium to longer term 
growth potential of the business.

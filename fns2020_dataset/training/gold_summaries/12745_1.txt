 Strategy
Our strategic priority for the year was to focus on developing revenues from the SiS
1
business, and the
Fruitﬂow
1
technology together with our Alliance partner DSM. In addition, further efforts to reduce costs
across the Group were a parallel strategic activity. We believe we have succeeded in all three areas,
with strong revenue growth from SiS
1
, good progress with Fruitﬂow
1
in bringing a powder version to
market, and wide ranging cost reductions reﬂected in the 50% reduction in underlying operating loss for
the Group.
With these three strategic areas all making good progress, in conjunction with the Board, a next
strategic phase is proposed, which will see the separation of SiS
1
and Fruitﬂow
1
businesses, in order
to optimise the proﬁt potential of each. The details of this are contained within a circular posted today to
shareholders and an announcement.
We used our equity ﬁnancing facility to drawdown £244k in May to support our innovation programme,
with a further £541k drawdown in September to meet the increasing working capital needs of the
growing SiS
1
business.
SiS

Revenue in FY12/13 was £5.52m, representing like for like revenue growth of 11% compared to the
same period last year. Growth was constrained to 7% in the ﬁrst half due to historically poor weather
and adverse trading conditions. However trading in the second half was much stronger as a range of
initiatives took effect, resulting in second half revenue growth of 17% and ﬁnal quarter revenue growth of
25%. This momentum has carried into FY13/14.
We have continued to invest in the heartland of independent cycle, triathlon and running shops, through
extra sales staff and capital investment in display stands. This has paid dividends, as we have seen
growth through all our key wholesale accounts. In major grocers and high street accounts, we have both
broadened our range and space in key accounts, together with extending distribution via the addition of
new accounts including Sainsbury’s, Boots, Costco and since the year end, Halfords. International
markets have continued to develop well for us, with strong performances by our distributors in Benelux
and Denmark, and the appointment of a new distributor in France.
Direct selling is a strategic growth driver and as a result we developed and launched a new website and
e-commerce platform in the second half, and recruited an e-commerce team, resulting in good growth in
this channel. Further investment in direct selling is continuing.
Good levels of investment have been made in marketing, through the acquisition of brand ambassadors
Sir Chris Hoy and Helen Jenkins, taking substantial share of voice through press advertising, generating
brand proﬁle through social media channels, and substantially increased PR.
Innovation has been a key growth driver, with Go Hydro tablets, Go Gel
1
plus Fruitﬂow
1
and Go Gel
1
plus Nitrates being notable and successful launches in the year. We have a strong research programme
in place, largely carried out in conjunction with our partner sports teams and athletes, and through
collaboration with leading research institutes. The Directors believe that a promising pipeline is in place
for 2013 and 2014.
The move to a new supply facility has proved effective as gross margin improved by 6%. In addition the
commissioning of the new Go Gel
1
ﬁlling machine has given us capacity to deal with the strong growth
in this product format, and we have recently moved to a 24 hour manufacturing operation to meet
growing demand.

The Alliance with DSM has made good progress during the year, with commercial progress with the
existing Fruitﬂow
1
syrup format in a range of global markets, and the launch of a powder format,
suitable for use in dietary supplement formats such as capsules and tablets.
There are now 17 consumer brands containing Fruitﬂow
1
syrup on sale in a range of global markets. As
well as the core blood ﬂow targeted products, DSM customers have also launched brands in the sports
nutrition and travel-related sectors. Our SiS
1
Go Gel
1
plus Fruitﬂow
1
sports recovery product also
launched during the year.

was ofﬁcially launched at Vitafoods in May 2013. The format has broad potential applications in dietary
supplements, dairy shots, nutrition bars and spreads. Four products containing this format are now in
market, and interest from potential customers is strong, especially in the USA.
We collaborated with DSM to complete a substantial piece of consumer research to more fully
understand consumer attitudes to Fruitﬂow
1
and blood ﬂow, in order to support potential customers in
understanding the key success factors for any new brand launches. The DSM marketing and sales
teams are using the ﬁndings from this research to assist their customers with potential brand positioning.
Whilst revenues for Fruitﬂow
1
remain low in the year, there has been a marked improvement over the
year both in revenues and number of brands in the market. In addition, interest in the technology and
awareness of Fruitﬂow
1
continues to develop. These trends, together with the availability of the powder
format are a source of continued optimism for the prospects of this novel technology.
With the investment cycle completed for Fruitﬂow
1
we continue to focus keenly on costs. Since the year
end, we have to this end, closed our facility at the University of Aberdeen. Residual ongoing costs for
Fruitﬂow
1
are largely related to IP maintenance and management time for the Alliance with DSM.
Outlook
The outlook for SiS
1
is positive as we continue to invest in marketing, sales and direct selling to drive
revenue growth, underpinned by an increasingly effective supply chain. With our current sales
momentum, the continued resilience in the sports nutrition category, the Board believes we are placed
for strong growth for the coming year and beyond.
While the investment cycle is completed for Fruitﬂow
1
we continue to work closely with DSM to explore
all avenues for growing revenues for our novel technology. The number of international brands
containing Fruitﬂow
1
continues to steadily increase and the availability of the powder format enhances
further the prospects for the technology. While the economic climate is still affecting the attitude of global
brand owners towards large-scale innovation, the general outlook is positive.
The proposed demerger of SiS
1
, subject to shareholder approval, will further optimise the outlook for
both the Fruitﬂow
1
and SiS
1
businesses.

Key Business Highlights
> After achieving good progress in the ﬁ rst half of the year, the Company was 
affected increasingly by the rapid onset of the crisis in the ﬁ nancial services sector, 
which is its main marketplace, resulting in a loss before tax of £753,000.
> The combination of software licences, software services and maintenance 
increased their contribution to 66% of revenue for the full year with the balance 
coming from implementation services. This compares with 56% for 2008 and 
36% in 2007.
> Net cash at the year-end was £262,000 (2008: £878,000) and has increased 
since then.
> A tight control on overheads was maintained during the year with administrative 
costs being reduced by 26% to £2.6 million.
> A move to new open plan ofﬁ ces in July 2008 has improved staff morale and team 
working as well as providing excellent new customer training facilities.
> New contract wins announced during the year demonstrate continued interest in 
our products in core markets and internationally. 
> The Company’s sales efforts have been increased by the appointment of Robert 
Maxﬁ eld as Head of Sales in November 2008. The Company has reported that its 
pipeline of potential sales is stronger now than at any time in the past 24 months 
and that its focus is on converting this potential into signed contracts.  
> Due to the fastest take-up of a new product release in the Company’s history, 
there are now 10 customers using the latest releases of eg work manager

 and 
eg operational intelligence

.
> A signiﬁ cant contract has been secured in the new ﬁ nancial year with a value of 
£1.6 million over four years, with just over half of the revenue expected to be 
recognised in the current year.

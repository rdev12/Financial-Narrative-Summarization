 Chairman’s statement
The Group’s results for 2014 were at the
top end of the Board’s expectations.
The growth in our revenue has delivered
improved profitability which, alongside self-
funded investment, has driven the Group’s
return on capital employed (ROCE) ahead of
our weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
for the first time since the economic
downturn in 2008 – an important strategic
milestone for the Group.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements Our performance in the year, in particular,
reflects the actions taken to re-energise our
UK business towards the end of 2013 and
our strategic decision to continue to deploy
additional capital into our Middle East
operations. The strength of the improvement
in performance of these two key regions in
2014 has more than compensated for the
significant exchange rate headwinds on
our overseas earnings.
The dividend increase of 30% reflects these
strong results and the Board’s confidence
in the Group’s long term future.
As in recent years, we completed another
substantial fleet investment programme in
2014, adding capacity to our Middle East
operations to meet growing demand while
continuing to refresh our European rental
fleet. The ability of the Group to increase
the scale of its investment activity in order
to strengthen and develop our market
positions, without having to re-leverage our
balance sheet, is a reflection of our robust
financial position and our capability to
generate strong operational cash flows.
This was again demonstrated during the
year, as the operational cash flows fully
funded our investment programme and
also enabled a further modest reduction
to be made to the Group’s net debt level.
During the year we reviewed our debt
financing arrangements to ensure that
they properly reflected the strengthened
financial position of the Group. As a result,
we have extended the maturity and
reduced the cost of our bank facilities
while also increasing the overall size of the
facilities available. These facilities provide
the Group with a medium to long term
diversified financing package with
significant liquidity to support the growth
plans of the Group in the coming years.
Our strategic focus on developing our
strong market positions with a
differentiated service offering to drive
both revenue growth and better margins
is delivering the expected improvement
in the Group’s financial performance.
We have underpinned our ability to
maintain this momentum going forward by
ensuring that additional capital is readily
available to support both our immediate
growth plans and to respond to attractive
opportunities as they develop in the
marketplace. We have also strengthened
the breadth and depth of our
management teams, particularly in the
UK and the Middle East, and substantially
completed the roll out of the Group’s
standardised IT platform.
We are confident the continued delivery
of revenue growth, combined with our
improved operational efficiency established
in recent years, will generate substantial
shareholder value in the medium term.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s ROCE for the year was 11.9%,
a marked improvement over the 10.6%
reported for 2013.
The calculation of ROCE is based on the
Group’s operating profit before exceptional
items and the average of the opening and
closing capital employed for the year of
£313.7 million (2013: £300.8 million).
The ROCE of 11.9% is stated on a like
for like basis with the prior year, and
therefore ignores this year’s favourable
impact on the Group’s capital employed
arising from the impairment of the
carrying value of the goodwill in the Group’s
Belgian business. The impact of this
impairment reduces the Group’s capital
employed and increases the reported ROCE
for 2014 to 12.1% (2013: 10.6%).
Dividend
Given the Group’s strong financial
performance and cash flows in the year,
the Board is proposing a final dividend of
3.20 pence per share, making the total
dividend for the year 4.60 pence, an increase
of 30% over the previous year (2013: a total
dividend of 3.55 pence). The final dividend,
if approved, will be paid on 23 April 2015 to
shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 6 March 2015.
The proposed increase in the dividend not
only reflects the financial performance of
the Group in the year but also the Board’s
confidence in the Group’s future and the
continued recognition that dividends are
an important means of delivering
shareholder value.
Dividend cover, based on the proposed
total dividend for 2014 and underlying
earnings per share, has reduced to 3.4
times (2013: 4.0 times) in line with our
stated intention to maintain dividend
distributions within a range that is covered
three to four times by earnings. The actual
dividend cover in any one year will be
balanced against the Group’s investment
needs and funding requirements as we
move through the business cycle.
Financial results
Group total revenues increased by 7% to
£253.1 million at constant currency rates
(2013: £237.5 million), with rental revenues
increasing by 6% to £238.3 million on the
same basis (2013: £225.3 million). At actual
exchange rates, total revenues and rental
revenues increased by 4% and 3% to £246.3
million and £231.9 million respectively.
Chairman’s statement

4     Lavendon Group plc 2014
The Group’s results for 2014 were at the
top end of the Board’s expectations.
The growth in our revenue has delivered
improved profitability which, alongside self-funded
investment, has driven the Group’s return on
capital employed (ROCE) ahead of our weighted
average cost of capital (WACC) for the first time
since the economic downturn in 2008 – an
important strategic milestone for the Group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2014     5
This revenue growth, combined with our
improved operational efficiency, increased
the Group’s underlying operating profits by
15% to £40.6 million (2013: £35.3 million)
at constant currencies, with margins
improving to 16% (2013: 15%). At actual
exchange rates, underlying operating
profits increased by 11% to £39.3 million,
with margins improving to 16%. This
improved performance has been
delivered despite the impact of year
on year foreign exchange rate
movements that have reduced the
Group’s underlying operating profits
by c.£1.3 million in 2014.
The improved trading performance and
a marginal reduction in the Group’s
net interest costs to £5.2 million (2013:
£5.3 million) enabled the Group’s
underlying profit before tax to increase
by 18% to £35.3 million (2013: £30.0
million) at constant currencies. At actual
exchange rates, the Group’s underlying
profit before tax increased by 14% to
£34.1 million.
Although the Group’s underlying effective
tax rate increased to 23% (2013: 20%),
underlying profit after tax increased by 13%
to £27.3 million (2013: £24.1 million) and
earnings per share increased by 12% to
16.21 pence per share (2013: 14.42 pence)
at constant currencies. At actual exchange
rates, the Group’s underlying profit after
tax and earnings per share increased to
£26.4 million and 15.65 pence per
share respectively.
Amortisation* charges for the year were
£2.0 million (2013: £3.3 million) and
exceptional items totalled £11.1 million
(2013: £3.3 million). The exceptional
items relate to an £8.8 million non-cash
impairment charge on the carrying
value of the goodwill associated with
the Group’s Belgian business, a non-cash
provision of £1.3 million to cover the
closure costs of the Group’s Indian
operation and fees of £1.0 million
associated with the Group’s refinancing
of its bank facilities in August 2014.
After amortisation* charges and
exceptional items, the Group’s operating
profits were £27.2 million (2013: £28.7
million), profit before tax was £21.0 million
(2013: £23.4 million) and profit after tax
was £13.9 million (2013: £19.1 million),
with earnings per share of 8.23 pence
per share (2013: 11.41 pence).
Cash flow
Underlying earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
increased by 8% to £82.1 million (2013:
£76.2 million) at constant currencies with
margins at 32% (2013: 32%). At actual
exchange rates, EBITDA for the year
increased to £79.6 million.
The Group’s cash generated from
operations improved to £26.8 million (2013:
£25.5 million) despite the increased net
cash outflow relating to the purchase and
sale of rental fleet assets of £41.6 million
(2013: £39.9 million). Net cash generated
from operating activities, after payment of
interest and tax, increased to £13.6 million
(2013: £12.3 million).
Investment
In 2014, and as planned, the Group
increased the level of investment in its
rental fleet and operational infrastructure
to £64.7 million (2013: £55.1 million). As in
previous years, this was partly funded by
the disposal of surplus or retired assets
which generated £11.6 million in the year
(2013: £10.5 million). After reflecting
movements in amounts owing to
equipment suppliers at the beginning
and end of the year, this investment
programme resulted in a net cash outflow
for the year of £45.6 million (2013:
£44.9 million) which was again fully funded
from our operating cash flows. This ability
to self-fund our investment programme
demonstrates the extent of the Group’s
cash generation capabilities.
Due to the timing of fleet deliveries in the
second half of the year, amounts owing to
equipment suppliers at the end of 2014
showed a year on year increase of £7.5
million. This had a favourable impact on the
Group’s net debt level at the year end which
will unwind during the first quarter of 2015.
Our investment programme has principally
been directed towards replacing
approximately 7% of the Group’s rental fleet
and adding further capacity to our Middle
East operations to meet the continued
growth in demand that we see in the
region. Over the past three years, some
29% of the Group’s rental fleet has been
refreshed, ensuring that it remains well
invested and highly competitive to support
our strong market positions.
Refinancing
In August 2014 we refinanced the Group’s
existing bank facilities, originally scheduled
to be renewed in July 2016, and extended
them to July 2019 at a lower margin cost.
In addition, the Group also issued two new
loan notes on the US Private Placement
market with a total value of €35 million.
Following the refinancing, the Group’s debt
facilities total c.£175 million and comprise
revolving bank facilities of £50 million
and €60 million together with US Private
Placements with a combined value of
€95 million (being loan notes of €60 million,
€17.5 million and €17.5 million maturing in
July 2019, August 2021 and August 2024
respectively). These new debt facilities
provide additional liquidity headroom of
c.£28 million over the Group’s previous
funding structure.
Net debt
With our strong operating cash flows
being more than sufficient to fund the
capital expenditure programme
undertaken during the year, together with
a favourable foreign exchange movement
of £5.0 million on our Euro-denominated
debt, the Group’s net debt level at the
year end reduced by £7.1 million to
£90.6 million (2013: £97.7 million).
Adjusting for the unamortised costs of
£0.9 million relating to the Group’s US
Private Placements, the Group’s reported
net debt at 31 December 2014 was
£89.7 million (2013: £97.0 million).
The corresponding debt to equity ratio
improved to 41% (2013: 46%) and our
net debt to pre-exceptional EBITDA ratio
reduced to 1.13 times (1.27 times). The
Group continues to operate comfortably
within our preferred leverage range of
between 1.00 -1.75 times EBITDA.

Summary and outlook
The Group has delivered a strong
underlying performance in 2014, at the
top end of the Board’s expectations, with
revenues, profits, margins and ROCE all
increasing year on year. This progress has
been delivered despite significant exchange
rate headwinds of c.£1.3 million on our
overseas earnings, clearly demonstrating
the strength of the Group’s overall financial
performance in the year.
During 2014 we have seen particularly
strong results from our key UK and Middle
East regions; the major factors in driving
the Group’s ROCE ahead of our WACC for
the first time since 2008. The achievement
of this important strategic milestone
demonstrates the clear progress that has
been delivered in recent years towards
our goal of maintaining the Group’s
average ROCE above its WACC over the
business cycle.
The Group’s investment programme in the
year was primarily directed towards the
continued refreshment of the Group’s
rental fleet and adding further revenue
generating capacity to our Middle East
operations to support the growth in
demand that we are continuing to see
in this region.
As we move into 2015, we are planning a
net capital expenditure programme of
c.£55 million, slightly ahead of that in 2014,
and again directed towards the continued
refreshment of our fleet and the further
expansion of our Middle East operations.
The Group’s capability to generate strong
operating cash flows, together with our
robust balance sheet and increased debt
facilities, provide the necessary flexibility for
us to accelerate the scale and pace of this
investment should attractive growth
opportunities emerge or the conditions in
our markets warrant the deployment of
additional capital as the year progresses.
The Group’s financial performance has
benefited from revenue growth which, given
our efficient cost base, has driven our
improved profitability. The efficiency created
within our cost structure in recent years is
reflected within our employee base, where
a 6% growth in employees since 2010 has
delivered a 17% growth in revenues and
driven a 63% growth in our operating
profits. Our focus is to build on this
momentum, add scale to the business, and
continue the disciplined management of our
processes to enable our inherent operating
leverage to deliver attractive incremental
margins and so underpin the performance
of the Group in the coming years.
Since the year end, further growth in the
Middle East is offsetting the impact of a
year on year revenue decline currently
being seen in the UK. Our overall margins
are continuing to improve such that the
Board expects the Group to perform
slightly ahead of its expectations for the
year as a whole.

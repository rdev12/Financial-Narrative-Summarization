Chief 
Executive’s 
Report
A steady year for Accoya
 
sales
Total	revenue	for	the	year	ended	31	March	2016	increased	by	15%	to	¤52.8m	
(2015:	¤46.1m).	Within	this	total,	Accoya
	
wood	revenue	increased	by	7%	to	
¤43.5m	(2015:	¤40.7m)	largely	as	a	result	of	pricing,	while	licence	income	
increased	from	¤0.4m	to	¤2.8m	reflecting	the	enhanced	relationship	with		
our	Accoya
®	
licensee	Solvay.
Underlying	demand	for	Accoya
	
remains	
strong	and	I	am	pleased	to	report 	
that	Accoya
	
continues	to	gain	ever 	
greater	recognition	and	acceptance 	
in	the	market	place	as	the	benefits 	
of	Accoya
	
are	recognised	over	those 	
of	hardwoods	and	other	man-made 	
materials.	The	smaller	increase	in	sales 	
volume	compared	to	recent	years	was 	
in	part	a	result	of	our	pricing	strategy 	
in	order	to	manage	demand	as	we	near 	
our	existing	capacity.	In	addition,	sales 	
in	certain	geographies	were	less	than 	
had	been	expected,	with	our	customers 	
in	the	Benelux	taking	longer	to	recover 	
from	the	economic	downturn	and 	
some	customers	in	North	America 	
undergoing	a	period	of	destocking. 	
In	January,	Solvay	assumed	
responsibility	for	sales	and	marketing	
in	their	exclusive	region	which	includes	
Germany,	France,	Italy,	Spain,	Poland	
and	Scandinavia	and	have	committed	
to	purchase	a	minimum	of	76,000m
3
	
of	Accoya
	
from	Accsys	over	a	five	
year	period	to	help	support	the	
development	of	their	region.	We	
have	continued	to	work	closely	with	
Solvay	supporting	the	transition	and	
will	continue	to	develop	marketing	
campaigns	and	strategy	with	them,	
building	on	our	success	over	recent	
years.	Sales	volumes	in	their	region	
marginally	reduced	in	the	period	as		
a	result	of	the	transition	and	due	to	
some	de-stocking	of	key	customers,	
however	these	are	expected	to	
increase	in	the	new	financial	year.
The	assumption	of	responsibility	for 	
sales	in	Solvay’s	region	enables	us	to 	
redeploy	some	of	our	resources.	We 	
will	continue	to	focus	on	the	UK,	our 	
largest	and	strongest	market,	as	well	as 	
the	Benelux	which	has	underperformed 	
as	noted	above.	In	addition,	we	have 	
hired	new,	highly	experienced	staff 	
to	our	North	American	sales	team	as 	
we	believe	this	market	provides	the 	
greatest	opportunity	for	growth	in 		
the	longer-term.	
Sales	in	Asia	Pacific	grew	steadily	
with	growth	in	Japan,	Australia	and	
New	Zealand.	Sales	also	resumed	to	
Diamond	Wood	and	we	continue	to	
believe	the	entire	region	represents	
a	significant	long-term	opportunity	
for	Accoya.	
We	continue	to	develop	our	sales 	
and	marketing	methods	which	vary 	
depending	on	market	and	preferences 	
for	particular	applications.	This	has 	
also	enabled	us	to	learn	and	we	will 	
continue	to	transfer	knowledge	and 	
practices	between	markets	in	order 	
to	understand	how	best	to	take 	
advantage	of	the	market	opportunity 	
as	new	manufacturing	capacity 	
becomes	available.	
Accoya
	
sold	to	Medite	for	the	
manufacture	of	Medite	Tricoya
	
increased	by	21%	to	¤6.6m	(2015:	
¤5.5m).	The	margin	for	this	material	
remains	below	that	achieved	for	the	
majority	of	Accoya
	
we	sell,	reflecting	
our	investment	in	the	Tricoya
	
project	
and	that	the	current	manufacturing	
process	is	in	place	only	until	the	first	
dedicated	Tricoya
	
plant	is	operational.	
We	continue	to	expect	volumes	sold	
to	Medite	to	increase	marginally	in	
the	new	financial	year,	given	potential	
capacity	limitations	in	Arnhem.
We	have	59	Accoya
	
distributor,	supply	
and	agency	agreements	in	place	
covering	most	of	Europe,	Australia,	
Canada,	Chile,	China,	India,	Israel,	
Mexico,	Morocco,	New	Zealand,	South	
Africa,	parts	of	South-East	Asia	and	
Middle-East	and	the	USA.
The	increase	in	revenue	largely	resulted 	
from	an	approximate	5%	price	increase 	
for	our	Accoya
	
customers	implemented	
during	the	third	quarter	of	the	previous 	
financial	year	which	improved	our 	
margin	on	a	comparable	basis	in	the 	
first	half	of	the	new	financial	year.	The 	
second	half	of	the	year	was	impacted 	
by	our	maintenance	stop	in	October 	
and	a	Christmas	period	which	is	quiet 	
for	the	whole	industry.	In	addition,	the 	
19%
Manufacturing 
EBITDA increase 15
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
last	quarter	was	impacted	by	lower 	
sales	prices	to	Solvay,	following	their 	
assumption	of	sales	and	marketing 	
responsibilities	in	their	region	and	their 	
related	five	year	offtake	agreement. 	
There	were	no	significant	Accoya
	
price	changes	in	the	year,	other	than 	
minor	adjustments	to	reflect	some 	
regional	foreign	exchange	variations. 	
We	have	no	imminent	plans	for 	
significant	price	changes	however 	
we	will	continue	to	keep	prices	under 	
review	in	the	new	financial	year	given 	
the	underlying	demand	for	Accoya. 	
In	November	2015,	I	was	pleased	
that	Accsys	was	recognised	with	the	
Cradle	to	Cradle	Products	Innovator	
Award,	recognising	leaders	across	
industries	that	are	designing	for	
upcycling	and	making	products		
with	safe	ingredients	that	
are	perpetually	cycled	and	
manufactured	in	ways	that	respect	
humans	and	the	environment.
Another increase in Accoya
 
manufacturing plant profitability 
The	price	increases	and	on-going	
improvements	and	efficiency	gains	
enabled	manufacturing	gross	profit	
to	increase	from	25%	to	27%	with	
manufacturing	EBITDA	increasing		
by	19%	to	¤8.3m	(2015:	¤6.9m).	
We	continue	to	believe	our	existing	
manufacturing	is	an	illustration	
of	the	returns	achievable	when	
producing	Accoya
	
on	a	larger	scale.	
We	expect	the	economies	of	scale	
resulting	from	operating	at	full	
capacity	to	result	in	a	higher	gross	
margin.	Further	improvements	in	
profitability	are	expected	to	result	
from	the	expanded	plant	as	a	result	
of	economies	of	scale	associated	
with	operating	our	chemical	plant.	In	
turn	these	are	expected	to	improve	
the	profitability	of	the	overall	Group	
given	the	remainder	of	the	Group’s	
costs	are	less	variable	in	nature.
CASE STUDY
Masisa Tricoya
®
 XB chosen for 
premium brand – Chile
Masisa	Tricoya
	
XB	has	been	used	for	the	new	
decorative	facade	for	Bosch	House	located	in	
Alonso	de	Cordova,	Vitacura,	Chile.
Masisa	worked	with	the	architect	to	create	a	
modern	and	sustainable	design,	and	requirement	
for	the	customer.
The	brand	logo	was	also	made	from	Masisa	
Tricoya
	
XB,	avoiding	the	use	of	acrylic	signs.	The	
panels	were	coated	with	architectural	paints	to	
meet	with	UV	strength	and	durability. 16
Investing	in	our	manufacturing 	
process	and	developing	improvements 	
to	equipment	and	the	chemical 	
process	remains	a	core	part	of	our 	
business.	Improvements	are	sought 	
to	increase	capacity,	reliability	and 	
efficiency,	all	of	which	will	also	help 	
improve	the	profitability	of	our 	
licensee’s	plants.	We	will	continue	to 	
invest	in	the	new	financial	year,	and 	
will	be	incorporating	what	we	have 	
learnt	and	improved	so	far	into	our 	
new	reactors	and	expanded	plant. 	
Our	significant	research	and 	
development	programme	continues	
to	identify	future	improvements 	
to	our	process	as	well	as	product 	
and	application	developments.	We 	
continue	to	carry	out	both	research 	
and	development	into	additional 	
species	to	be	commercially	acetylated 	
which	we	will	believe	will	bring	further 	
market	and	supply	opportunities. 	
We	are	also	seeking	to	increase	the 	
strength	of	our	supply	chain	to	enable 	
our	future	growth	and	to	support 	
new	manufacturing	capacity	as	it 	
becomes	available.	
Enhanced collaboration with Solvay
In	November,	we	were	pleased	to 	
announce	a	new	arrangement	with	our 	
Accoya
	
licensee,	Solvay	Acetow	GmBH	
(‘Solvay’),	providing	the	framework 	
and	funding	for	Accsys	to	significantly 	
increase	our	manufacturing	capacity 	
in	Arnhem.	
Solvay	will	purchase	a	minimum	of	
76,000m
3
	of	Accoya
	
from	our	Arnhem	
plant	over	the	period	from	2016	to	
2020	(the	‘offtake	commitment’)	and	
has	taken	over	full	responsibility	for	
sales	and	marketing	for	a	reduced	
exclusive	region	in	Europe	from	
January	2016.	
The	arrangement	enables	Accsys	
to	generate	increased	Accoya
	
manufacturing	capacity	in	a	faster	
timescale	than	previously	would	have	
been	possible	and	Solvay	will	review	
the	optimal	timing	to	construct	its	
own	63,000m
3
	Accoya
	
manufacturing	
plant.	This	also	enables	Accsys	
to	generate	higher	returns	from	
manufacturing	a	higher	volume	of	
Accoya
	
over	the	next	few	years	than	
was	previously	envisaged	and	in	return	
Solvay	will	benefit	from	developing	
higher	demand	for	Accoya
	
to	be	
manufactured	from	its	own	plant	when 	
it	becomes	operational.	
We	will	double	our	existing	
manufacturing	capacity	in	Arnhem	
in	stages.	Work	has	commenced	
in	respect	of	the	first	stage	of	the	
expansion	which	will	result	in	a	
third	reactor,	adding	50%	additional	
capacity	(to	a	total	of	in	excess	of	
60,000m
3
).	We	have	completed	the	
pre-construction	engineering	and	
design	work,	which	also	includes	
the	chemical	backbone	enabling	a	
fourth	reactor	to	be	added	separately.	
We	expect	the	third	reactor	to	be	
operational	in	mid-2017	calendar	year.	
The	fourth	reactor	will	be	added	at	a	
later	date	as	demand	requires.	
The	addition	of	the	third	reactor	will	
be	funded	through	a	combination	
of	loans	and	fees	from	Solvay,	in	
addition	to	those	due	under	the	
offtake	commitment,	with	the	balance	
expected	to	be	met	by	our	own	
resources,	including	the	expected	sale	
and	leaseback	of	the	remaining	land	
at	Arnhem,	noting	that	our	existing	
manufacturing	site	was	subject	to	a	
similar	agreement	in	2011.	
Proposed Tricoya
® 
consortium
We	have	made	significant	and	exciting 	
progress	in	the	creation	of	a	new 	
consortium	which	is	expected	to	result 	
in	Accsys	holding	a	major	stake	in	a 	
valuable	new	business.	
In	February	2016	we	announced	
BP’s	participation	in	the	proposed	
consortium	(the	‘Consortium’)	to	fund,	
build	and	operate	the	world’s	first	
Tricoya
	
wood	elements	acetylation	
plant.	Accsys	and	BP	Ventures	(‘BPV’)	
agreed	initial	funding	in	respect	of	
the	Consortium,	with	BPV	acquiring	
an	initial	3%	equity	interest	in	Tricoya
	
Technologies	Limited	(‘TTL’),	implying	
a	valuation	of	TTL	at	¤35	million	today.

5 years 17
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
BPV’s	investment	follows	¤1.3m	
already	contributed	by	BP	and	
Medite	since	April	2015.	The	pre-
construction	engineering	and	
design	work	has	been	completed,	
engineering,	procurement	and	
construction	(EPC)	contractors	
have	been	shortlisted	and	detailed	
planning	is	continuing	for	the	plant,	
which	is	expected	to	be	located	
at	the	Saltend	Chemicals	Park	in	
Hull,	UK,	adjacent	to	BP’s	existing	
acetyls	facility.	BPV’s	on-going	
participation	in	the	Consortium	
remains	conditional	upon	the	full	
Consortium	being	finalised	later	this	
calendar	year.	
BP’s	involvement	results	from	a	
historical	interest	in	acetylation	
having	conducted	research	and	
development	into	wood	acetylation	
at	its	Hull	site	in	the	past.	BP	
Chemicals	has	also	been	a	key	
partner	of	Accsys,	supplying	acetic	
anhydride	for	its	Accoya
	
plant	in	
Arnhem	since	it	began	operations	
and	entering	into	a	collaborative	
strategic	relationship	in	2012.
The	Consortium	is	also	expected	to	
include	Medite,	part	of	the	Medite	
Smartply	group	and	Accsys’s	historic	
joint	development	partner.	Medite	
has	received	Board	approval	in	
principle	to	invest	in	the	Consortium	
and	to	enter	a	long-term	offtake	
commitment	for	up	to	nearly	
half	of	the	Tricoya
	
plant’s	initial	
annual	capacity.
The	Hull	plant	will	have	an	initial	
capacity	of	30,000	tonnes	
per	annum	(tpa)	(sufficient	
to	manufacture	40,000m
3
	of	
panels)	with	scope	for	expansion.	
Approximately	60%	of	the	plant’s	
output	is	expected	to	be	sold	under	
committed	take-or-pay	agreements	
with	Medite	and	Masisa;	cash	flow	
break-even	is	at	approximately	40%	
capacity.	The	plant	is	expected	to	
cost	approximately	¤61m,	with	a	
further	approximately	¤15m	required	
for	continued	market	seeding,	
marketing,	IP	development	and	
engineering	functions	to	cash		
break-even.	
The	global	market	for	Tricoya
	
panel	
products	is	estimated	at	between	1.6 	
million	and	4.5	million	m
3
	per	annum,	
which	would	occupy	around	1%	of 	
global	MDF	manufacturing	capacity. 	
Tricoya
	
panels	were	introduced	
to	the	market	by	Medite	in	2011, 	
manufactured	using	chipped	Accoya. 	
Sales	have	roughly	doubled	each	year 	
since,	and	total	panel	sales	to	date 	
exceed	13,000m
3
	(approximately	
1,200,000m
2
),	representing	a	sales 	
value	of	approximately	¤18m.	TTL 	
intends	to	grow	the	market	for 	
Tricoya
	
wood	elements	through	a 	
combination	of	own	manufacture	in 	
key	territories	and	licensing/partnering	
in	other	geographies.
BP	and	Medite	are	together	expected 	
to	invest	approximately	¤30m	and	up 	
to	¤20m	is	expected	to	be	provided 	
from	bank	debt,	which	is	possible 	
as	a	result	of	a	committed	offtake 	
agreement	from	Medite.	Accsys’s 	
contribution	is	substantially	in	the 	
form	of	intellectual	property	and	the 	
development	of	the	Tricoya
	
business	
to	date	such	that	our	remaining 	
contribution	is	expected	to	be	limited 	
to	approximately	¤1m	and	our	on-
going	provision	of	Accoya
	
as	market	
seeding	material,	as	we	have	been 	
since	2011.	
The	balance	of	approximately	¤25m	
is	expected	to	be	contributed	by	
the	final	consortium	members	and	
TTL	has	engaged	Opus	Corporate	
Finance	LLP	to	advise	in	this	respect.	
As	a	result,	Accsys	is	expected	
to	retain	a	substantial	interest	in	
the	consortium,	reflective	of	the	
substantial	investment	we	have	
made	in	respect	of	the	Tricoya
	
technology	and	market	development	
over	many	years.
The	formation	of	the	Consortium	
remains	conditional	upon	detailed	
agreements	being	finalised	between	
the	parties	including	the	debt	
and	equity	finance.	However	we	
are	confident	that	the	substantial	
progress	made	over	the	last	year	
by	the	Consortium	will	lead	to	the	
completion	later	this	year,	with	the	
Tricoya
	
plant	being	operational	
in	2018.	
Intellectual Property 
Accsys	continues	to	focus	on	and	
invest	heavily	in	the	generation	and	
protection	of	intellectual	property	
relating	to	the	innovation	associated	
with	its	acetylation	processes	
and	products	to	ensure	ongoing	
differentiation	and	competitive	
advantage	in	the	market	place.	
Whilst	each	new	innovation	is	
carefully	considered,	patenting	and/
or	maintaining	valuable	know-how	
as	a	trade	secret	remains	the	typical	
route	through	which	our	innovation	
is	protected.	
Accsys	currently	has	an	extensive 	
patent	portfolio	with	over	40 	
granted	patents	in	various	countries 	
throughout	the	world	and	over	120 	
pending	patent	applications	across 	
more	than	20	patent	families	covering 	
all	major	markets.	Significant	R&D 	
resources	are	employed	to	maximise 	
the	scope	of	our	patent	rights	to	not 	
only	cover	the	products	we	and	our 	
distributors	and	licensees	sell,	and	the 	
processes	by	which	these	products 	
are	made,	but	also	to	prevent 	
competitors	from	commercialising	
similar	products	and	processes.
Management	of	Company	know-
how	remains	an	essential	element	
of	safeguarding	our	innovation,	with	
confidentiality	protocols	in	place	
to	prevent	unauthorised	access	to	
such	know-how	and	to	place	strict	
contractual	obligations	on	third	
parties	collaborating	with	Accsys.	
Increasing	Company-wide	awareness	
of	the	importance	of	protecting	and	
controlling	our	know-how	is	a	key	
initiative	with	particular	focus	on	
minimising	risks	when	collaborating	
with	third	parties.
Our	well	established	trade	mark	
portfolio	remains	unchanged	and	
covers	the	key	distinctive	brands	
Accoya
®
,	Tricoya
®	
and	the	Trimarque	
Device	under	which	products	
are	marketed,	alongside	the	
corporate	Accsys	brand,	including	
transliterations	in	Arabic,	Chinese	
and	Japanese.	All	of	our	key	brands	
have	now	been	registered	in	over	50	
countries,	and	have	become	valuable	
house-hold	names	in	the	timber	and	
panel	industries. 18
Accsys	continues	to	maintain	an	
active	watch	on	the	commercial	and	
IP	activity	of	third	parties	to	monitor	
and	take	actions	if	its	IP	rights	are	
being	infringed,	to	identify	potentially	
valuable	third	party	IP	which	could	
be	exploited	via	a	strategic	alliance,	
in-licence	or	purchase	of	third	party	IP	
and	to	obtain	an	early	insight	into	third	
party	IP	which	could	potentially	hinder	
our	proposed	commercial	activity.
Both	the	patent	and	trade	mark	
portfolios,	together	with	other	
protected	IP,	including	material	
under	copyright	and	domain	names,	
continue	to	be	regularly	reviewed	to	
ensure	alignment	with	the	Company	
objectives	and	to	confirm	obligations	
to	licensees	are	being	fulfilled.	
Careful	IP	management,	effected	via	
our	qualified	in-house	IP	manager	
working	in	close	conjunction	with	
our	technology,	engineering,	product	
development,	marketing	and	
commercial	groups,	and	supported	
where	appropriate	by	external	
patent	and	trade	mark	attorneys,	
ensures	our	IP	portfolio	is	not	only	
maintained	and	protected,	but	is	
grown	in	a	cost	effective	manner,	
adding	value	to	our	manufacturing	
and	licensing	businesses.
Outlook
Managing	the	demand	for	Accoya
	
given	our	short-term	capacity 	
constraints	will	continue	to	be	a 	
challenge	in	the	shorter-term.	The 	
progress	we	have	made	in	the 	
year	towards	securing	additional 	
manufacturing	capacity	provides	
certainty	in	the	medium-term	such 	
that	I	am	confident	that	both	Accoya
	
and	Tricoya
	
sales	will	grow	in	the	new 	
financial	year,	although	such	growth 	
will	necessarily	be	more	limited	than 	
in	past	years	until	the	new	capacity 	
comes	on	stream.
The	new	agreement	with	Solvay	
provides	us	with	an	opportunity	to	
generate	higher	returns	than	previously	
envisaged	over	the	next	few	years	and	
in	the	longer-term	also	gives	us	more	
capability	to	develop	the	substantial	
market	which	we	continue	to	believe	
exists	for	Accoya
	
globally.	The	EBITDA	
level	expected	to	be	generated	from	
the	expanded	Arnhem	plant	will	reflect	
further	economies	of	scale	associated	
with	operating	a	chemical	plant.	This	
is	expected	to	result	in	significantly	
improved	EBITDA	for	the	Group	as	a	
whole	given	the	level	of	costs	incurred	
by	the	remainder	of	the	Group	which	is	
focussed	on	business	development.	
The	proposed	Consortium	for	Tricoya
	
and	the	detailed	plans	in	place	for	
the	first	dedicated	chip	acetylation	
plant	in	Hull	are	particularly	exciting.	
When	completed,	it	will	result	in	a	
substantial	new	operating	business	for	
which	Accsys	will	continue	to	have	a	
substantial	interest.
Our	financial	position	remains	good	
and	despite	the	significant	investment	
required	to	execute	both	the	Arnhem	
expansion	and	the	Tricoya
	
plant,	I	
am	confident	we	have	or	are	putting	
in	place	appropriate	financing	
arrangements	to	ensure	that	maximum	
possible	financial	returns	are	achieved	
for	shareholders.
The	new	financial	year	has	continued	
to	demonstrate	strong	underlying	
demand	for	Accoya.	On	an	operating	
activities	basis,	we	expect	to	remain	
cash	flow	positive	over	the	year	
ahead	as	we	look	towards	the	next	
key	milestone	in	our	development.	I	
am	confident	that	our	overall	position	
is	stronger	than	at	any	point	in	our	
history	and	I	am	excited	about	our	
long-term	growth	prospects.

matches	and	concerts	and	will	be	able	to	
seat	12,500	people,	with	additional	capacity	
for	15,000	standing.
The	architects’	aim	was	to	create	a	building	
that	will	stand	the	test	of	time	and	as	result	
specified	Accoya.	Around	250m
3
	of	Accoya
	
is	being	used	to	create	the	entire	façade	of	
the	arena,	which	is	due	for	completion	in	
late	2016.
To	complement	the	façade	3XN	have 	
designed	‘fins’	to	give	the	building	a 		
unique	wave-like	semi-transparent	style. 	
The	fins	have	been	made	from	Accoya
	
and	
provide	extra	light,	texture	and	elegance 		
to	the	building.

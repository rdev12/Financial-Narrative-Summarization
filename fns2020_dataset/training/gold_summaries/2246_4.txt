Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Adult
The Adult division publishes globally in English for readers of fiction, biography, sport, 
food and drink, general reference and special interests such as yachting and ornithology. 
The main publishing operations are based in New York and London and coordinated 
by experienced editorial and publishing managers so that authors and their works are 
supported throughout the world.
Apart from household names such as Howard Jacobson, Khaled Hosseini, Elizabeth Gilbert 
and Margaret Atwood we are also proud to be the publishers of the Aberdeen Asset 
Management Reed’s Nautical, Wisden Cricketers’ and Whitaker’s Almanacks as well as the 
great institution which is Who’s Who.
Our objectives are to be the publisher of choice for the very best authors and the very best 
books in both digital and print formats. We pay particular attention to editorial support 
for authors both during the publication process and thereafter; the highest standards of 
production and presentation; and creative and innovative marketing. 
Our editorial and marketing teams work together so that we can genuinely offer global 
publishing reflecting the changing nature of our markets and the media which alert readers 
to books.

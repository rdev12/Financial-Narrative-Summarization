 The Services Division continued to enhance its reputation 
for delivery, successfully completing nearly 200 projects in 
the course of the year and for the first time achieving full 
national coverage. It expanded its client base, working 
on a wide range of complex deployments within the 
National Programme for IT (“NPfIT”), as well as directly 
with NHS Trusts and within the independent and private 
healthcare markets.
The company delivered phase one of the Isle of Man’ s 
£7.5m Patient Administration System and Electronic Patient 
Record (“PAS/EPR”) on time and to budget. The modules 
delivered so far include Patient Administration, Emergency 
Care, Maternity and Business Intelligence.
The Products Division focused on the development 
of the new generation Medway Sigma product range.  
The bulk of the phase one development is complete 
and the Emergency Care, Master Patient Index,  
Maternity and Business Intelligence modules are 
now installed and in live use. 
T wo important strategic acquisitions were completed 
during the year. IQ Systems Services Ltd and Care Records 
Ltd were acquired for an aggregate cash consideration 
of £1.8m, plus up to an additional £4m dependant upon 
future performance. These acquisitions took the System C 
Group into the independent sector healthcare market and 
expanded its portfolio of clinical products and expertise.
The company achieved significant success in the new NHS 
Additional Services Capability and Capacity (“ASCC”) 
contract. System C was selected as a preferred supplier 
under the framework agreement in all 16 categories it 
tendered for, including the key PAS category.

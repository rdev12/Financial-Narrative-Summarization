Chairman’s Statement
Key positioning
within prolific South Atlantic margins
“Our key focus is 
on developing our 
Namibian assets 
whilst at the same 
time looking to 
bring the first oil 
date forward.”
Peter Kidney 
Non-Executive Chairman
It is with pleasure that I present the 
latest results for Chariot Oil & Gas 
Limited, reporting on a year that saw 
transformational changes within our 
Company. The Board was delighted to 
welcome Paul Welch as CEO in October 
2009 and Chariot has made significant 
steps forward with our exploration in 
Namibia, furthered efforts on numerous 
new business opportunities and built a 
strong in-house technical team. The 
Board was also very pleased to 
welcome George Canjar who joined us 
as a non-executive director post period.  
He has extensive experience in the oil 
and gas industry which will be of great 
value to us going forward.
Namibia – frontier region, high 
impact exploration
Since our last report, there have been a 
number of major discoveries in deeper 
water environments. Brazilian 
exploration continues its unprecedented 
success and high profile discoveries 
have also been reported in West Africa, 
both in the established West African 
Basins and in new offshore areas such 
as Ghana and Sierra Leone.  These 
latter discoveries prove the prolific 
capability of African Atlantic margin plays 
outside the proven basins indicating 
positive implications for Namibia which 
lies in a comparable geologic setting. 
The recent reported discovery offshore 
the Falklands is also highly encouraging.  
Deep water exploration and production, 
pioneered across the Atlantic in the Gulf 
of Mexico and in Brazil, is leading to 
increased interest in the remaining 
underexplored high potential West 
African areas with majors, national oil 
companies and governments looking to 
secure acreage and future supply.

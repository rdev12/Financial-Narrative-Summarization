 06      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive’s statement
In 2009, revenue was £1,659.2 million 
(2008: £1,887.0 million) and operating profit 
before exceptional items was £122.8 million 
(2008: £209.3 million). Adjusted earnings per 
share were 55.0 pence (2008: 99.2 pence). 
Cash flow from operations was £171.5 million 
(2008: £159.5 million), an increase of 7.5 per cent. 
Our determination to continue investing in our 
businesses was illustrated by capital expenditure 
of £60 million compared with depreciation of 
£26 million, and total expenditure on research and 
development of £17 million (2008: £13 million). 
The Board was extremely pleased with the manner 
in which the businesses responded to 2009, 
addressing unfolding events and circumstances 
with appropriate rapid responses and determination. 
It bodes well for the future of the Charter group of 
companies that the morale in the businesses 
remained high and that the staff were able to sustain 
the effort to effect long-term improvement in 
operations whilst simultaneously meeting severe 
short-term pressures.
In 2009, as the engineering and manufacturing 
sectors contracted at unprecedented rates in 
Western Europe and North America in particular, 
ESAB’ s revenue and operating profit decreased 
compared with 2008. In an uncertain economic 
climate, forward visibility was clouded but the overall 
result for the year was in line with the revised 
forecasts that were prepared during the second 
quarter of the year. 
During the year, Howden successfully executed the 
strong order book with which it started the year, 
booked new orders and continued to grow its 
aftermarket business. As a result, it achieved an 
operating profit which was broadly in line with the 
budget set by the Board at the start of the year.
The Board considers that the best measure of the 
extent to which Charter is generating shareholder 
value is adjusted earnings per share, which excludes 
exceptional and other items considered by the Board 
to be not directly related to underlying performance. 
Adjusted earnings per share in the year of 55.0 
pence were slightly ahead of the revised forecast 
prepared during the second quarter of the year, but 
behind the original budget. The Board is also 
focused on the cash generated from operations 
during the year which amounted to £171.5 million 
(2008: £159.5 million), an increase of 7.5 per cent.
“ Charter demonstrated resilience 
and flexibility as it responded to the 
difficult financial and trading conditions 
of 2009 in which both businesses 
demonstrated their ability to continue 
to generate profits and cash.”

We also believe that the results for 2009 should be 
seen within the context of the progress which 
Charter has made over the past five years. You will 
find set out on pages 10 and 11 charts which 
illustrate how some of our principal measures of 
business performance have moved over this period.
Charter’s  strategy
Charter recognises that both ESAB and Howden 
are market leaders in their respective industries with 
the potential for further development.
In the current economic environment, we will drive 
operational improvement and cost management, 
whilst investing in the technology and infrastructure 
which these businesses need to maintain their 
positions of leadership and to deliver increasing 
value to their customers as the recovery unfolds.
We believe that both businesses have been 
growing their shares of the principal markets in 
which they operate and have the capability to 
continue to do so through continued emphasis on 
customer service, technical competence and 
increasingly global footprints.
By maintaining a strong balance sheet, Charter will 
ensure that ESAB and Howden will have the 
financial resources which the businesses need in 
order to meet their goal of returning to the strong 
growth achieved before the onset of the recession 
towards the end of 2008.
Review  of  2009  2009 saw dramatic reductions in levels of industrial 
activity in many regions around the world, the 
impact of which was heightened by the continuing 
shortage of credit as the financial system struggled 
to recover. T owards the end of the year, there were 
signs that the worst is behind us, but various 
regions, including the USA and Western Europe, 
remained generally weak throughout the year and 
the timing and extent of widespread economic 
recovery remains uncertain. 
Within this economic environment, the impact on 
ESAB was more immediate and, whilst Howden 
was generally able to maintain levels of activity, it 
suffered from a falling order intake. 
ESAB
The severe economic downturn had a significant 
impact on the results for the year with revenue 
down by 18 per cent and operating profit before 
exceptional items down by 57 per cent, or by 
28 per cent and 65 per cent respectively at 
constant currencies. Despite this, ESAB remained 
profitable in every major region and generated 
significant cash flow. 
Volumes of welding consumables for the year as a 
whole were down by around one-quarter compared 
with 2008. After a sharp reversal in the fourth 
quarter of 2008, volumes were generally stable in 
the first quarter of 2009 but then slipped again in the 
second quarter. Volumes in the second half of the 
year did not show any sustained improvement.
Whilst average net selling prices of consumables 
trended downwards during the year, generally 
reflecting the pass through of lower steel costs, 
ESAB’ s pro-active product and brand management 
enabled it to maintain premium pricing for its 
products in many markets in which it operates and 
on average for the year as a whole prices remained 
slightly ahead of 2008.
Revenue in the standard equipment business was 
down by around 40 per cent for the year as a whole, 
and finished the year without there having been any 
real signs of recovery in the key European and North 
American markets, although various emerging 
markets did start to recover as the year progressed. 
Engineered automation had a generally stable year, 
reflecting the relatively large proportion of its sales 
which are made to the energy industry. In the first half 
of the year, the cutting business reported higher 
revenues than in 2008, but with lower margins, whilst 
markedly lower order intake led to much reduced 
levels of activity in the second half of the year and a 
consequent negative impact on the business’ s 
profitability. Low levels of activity are likely to continue 
in cutting for some time to come. 
We responded to the lower levels of demand by 
implementing restructuring measures to reduce 
capacity and to achieve lasting improvements in the 
operational efficiency of the business. These 
measures saved over £50 million of costs during the 
year, and resulted in exceptional charges in ESAB for 
the year of £24 million. Some £6 million of exceptional 
costs which we previously envisaged being incurred 
in 2009 have been carried over into 2010. 
ESAB’ s adjusted operating margin for the year was 
6.3 per cent. After a difficult second quarter, margin 
performance generally improved during the second 
half of the year, led by the consumables business, 
but was offset by the deterioration in the cutting 
business. The outcome for the year, whilst 
appreciably below the level achieved in 2008, 
was ahead of the trough margin of 5.7 per cent 
recorded in 2001, despite the much larger volume 
reductions seen in 2009.
“Despite the severe economic 
downturn, ESAB remained 
profitable in every major 
region and generated 
significant cash flow.” 08      Charter International plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive’s statement
continued
During 2009, various senior management changes 
were implemented within ESAB. In order to more 
directly oversee ESAB’ s restructuring and response 
to the downturn, I took over executive 
responsibilities for ESAB in April at which time 
Jon T empleman stood down from his position as 
CEO of ESAB Global and left the business. Also at 
that time, James Deeley, Charter’ s Commercial 
Director, additionally took on the responsibility for 
ESAB’ s Standard Equipment, Automation and 
Cutting activities. We are taking additional steps to 
strengthen certain of ESAB’ s central functions to 
further improve its ability to respond to changes in its 
markets and to deliver customer focused solutions 
as well as levels of customer service. 
Howden
Against a difficult economic and financial backdrop, 
Howden delivered another strong set of results with 
almost unchanged revenue of £627.8 million 
(2008: £627.2 million) and operating profit 
before exceptional items of £70.5 million 
(2008: £73.1 million), a decrease of 4 per cent. 
The results were assisted by favourable exchange 
rate movements; at constant currencies, revenue 
and operating profit before exceptional items fell by 
13 per cent and 19 per cent respectively.
A particular feature of the results was the strong 
growth in the aftermarket business, where revenues 
increased by 17 per cent to £189 million, representing 
30 per cent of Howden’ s total revenues. 
The opening order book proved to be robust, with 
order cancellations during the year amounting to 
only £11 million. 
Order intake during the year of £514 million was 
down by 23 per cent compared with 2008. This 
primarily reflected weak order intake from the power 
sector in China, where electricity demand in the 
early part of the year was lower than in 2008, and in 
the USA, where weak economic and financial 
conditions combined with uncertainty over the new 
administration’ s policies on energy and 
environmental protection. 
Howden’ s order book gives it good visibility over 
future levels of activity and allows it to manage 
changes in levels of manned capacity. During 2009, 
restructuring measures, which are expected to lead 
to cost savings in 2010 of £8 million, led to an 
exceptional charge of £2 million. As a result of these 
measures, manned capacity has been brought into 
line with the levels of demand which the business 
expects to see during 2010. 
I am delighted that Howden’ s successes in recent 
years have been recognised by the business 
community. Howden was named by the British 
Chamber of Commerce as the UK Company of the 
Year 2009. 
Balance sheet and cash flow
As at 31 December 2009, shareholders’ funds were 
£550 million and Charter had net cash balances of 
£51 million. It remains our intention to maintain the 
Company’ s balance sheet strength. 
The prevailing economic and financial conditions 
increased focus on cash generation and control of 
working capital. During the year, cash inflow from 
operations was £171.5 million (2008: £159.5 million). 
During the year, Charter extended its financing 
facilities and presently has committed facilities of 
£170 million with maturity dates between 2011 and 
2013, which were undrawn at the end of the year.
2010  outlook
ESAB
ESAB has started the year with overall volumes of 
consumables generally in line with the volumes seen 
in the comparable period in 2009. There are some 
signs of modest improvements in volumes, but the 
performance between regions varies. Europe is 
generally patchy with no clear trends yet emerging; 
Southern Europe is weak and Western Europe 
remains flat but sales to Russia are recovering; 
Central Europe is benefiting from higher levels of 
activity in the automotive sector, but weakness in 
shipbuilding will continue which will impact sales to 
Germany, Poland and elsewhere. We are seeing an 
improving performance in South America, led by 
Brazil, and in India. We expect South-East Asia to 
trend positively, but performance between individual 
countries will vary. Oil and gas projects will drive the 
Middle East and we expect ESAB’ s sales into Africa 
will continue to grow. The economy in North 
America remains amongst the weaker performers, 
although ESAB’ s presence there is supported by 
strong positions in sectors which are proving to be 
more resilient, such as energy. 
In October 2009, The World Steel Association (‘WSA’) 
published a forecast for 2010 growth of 13.1 per cent 
in the consumption of steel for the world excluding 
China, which, if achieved, should lead to a similar 
increase in the demand for welding consumables. 
We have reinstated certain amounts of capacity in 
response to an improved outlook, but at present this 
is limited to specific geographies and products. 
Generally, we believe that ESAB’ s manned capacity is 
in line with current levels of demand, and ESAB has 
“Howden delivered another 
strong set of results with 
operating profit before 
exceptional items of 
£70.5 million.” Charter International plc Annual Report 2009    09
Our  businesses Directors’  and  other  reports Financial  statements Other  information
the flexibility to restore manned capacity quickly and 
cheaply as and when levels of demand warrant it. 
Selling prices of welding consumables are being 
maintained and, as demand for steel recovers, we 
expect to see some price escalation later in the year. 
On the equipment side, we see demand for 
standard equipment taking longer to recover, 
despite the more positive trends we are seeing in 
some developing markets. During the year, ESAB 
will introduce a new range of standard equipment. 
We see good prospects for engineered automation, 
with its significant exposure to the energy industry, 
despite some softening in order intake at the end of 
2009. We do not expect any discernable recovery in 
the cutting business to be seen before 2011. 
We will continue to take steps to ensure that ESAB 
emerges from the downturn as a stronger company.
We will maintain capital expenditure at levels well 
ahead of depreciation, but with the focus on 
improving customer service and business efficiency. 
Additions to capacity will be selective and in 
response to specific opportunities. We will also 
continue to invest in research and development. 
Overall, we believe that the restructuring measures 
already taken in response to the economic 
downturn will bring long-term benefits to the 
business and result in permanent cost savings of 
around £10 million, representing additional margin of 
about 1 per cent. 
During 2010, we envisage further restructuring 
measures, including in relation to the European 
supply chain and the cutting business where 
demand conditions remain depressed. T aking these 
into account and, as noted above, the charge of 
£6 million carried over from 2009, we expect the 
total exceptional charge in 2010 to be around 
£15 million.
Howden
After a very robust business performance in 2009, 
Howden’ s order book at 1 January 2010 stood at 
£441 million, of which £340 million is for delivery in 
2010 and the remaining £101 million thereafter. 
Allowing for some element of ‘book and bill’, we 
anticipate new equipment sales being slightly below 
the record levels seen in 2008 and 2009, and we 
have taken steps to reduce manned capacity in 
Howden accordingly. 
Growth in Howden’ s aftermarket activities, which we 
expect to continue in 2010, will partially offset lower 
sales of new equipment and, together with the 
flexibility of its business model, means that 
Howden’ s margin in 2010 should be only slightly 
lower than the level achieved in 2008 and 2009.
T owards the end of 2009, enquiry levels showed 
signs of picking up which we hope will be reflected 
in higher bookings in 2010 and lead to a resumption 
of growth in new equipment sales in 2011. 
Concluding  comments  2009 was a very challenging year during which 
Charter acted quickly and resolutely to ensure both 
ESAB and Howden addressed the challenges of 
recession and dislocation in the financial markets, 
whilst continuing to invest in both businesses and to 
position them for future recovery and growth.
We believe that the worst of the recession is behind 
us although we do not expect the recovery to be 
smooth or even across the many different regions in 
which Charter operates. We expect both ESAB and 
Howden to make further progress in 2010 and to 
perform well against the principal markets in which 
they operate. ESAB is well positioned to benefit 
from any recovery in steel consumption and, whilst 
we expect Howden’ s results in 2010 to be a little 
softer than 2009, we expect bookings to recover 
and growth to resume in 2011. 
Looking further ahead, we expect the long-term 
dynamics of rising energy demand and steel usage 
to prevail, and ESAB and Howden each have the 
market positions, people and assets required to 
continue to deliver superior value to Charter 
shareholders in the future.

How our principal measures of 
business performance have moved over 
the last five years
Chief Executive’s statement
continued
Adjusted  operating  profit
Description  of  measure
Adjusted operating profit measures the success 
we are having at increasing revenues net of 
increases in the cost of employees, goods and 
other services which we are incurring. We adjust 
operating profit to exclude the impact of unusual 
or non-recurring items, such as restructuring 
costs, which we believe is appropriate to give a 
truer picture of underlying performance. 
Performance
Adjusted operating profit grew consistently up to 
2009, when it fell as ESAB suffered deteriorating 
trading conditions and despite restructuring 
measures which saved over £50 million during 
the year, whilst Howden’ s profit fell only slightly.
Operating  margin
Description  of  measure
Operating margin measures the rate at which 
revenue changed relative to the rate at which 
operating profit (before exceptional items) changed. 
Whilst the operating margin may move for a variety 
of reasons, such as changes in geographic or 
product mix, the actual operating margin achieved 
against the expected level is one of our principal 
measures of underlying performance.
Performance
Charter’ s operating margin improved until 2008, 
when the onset of the economic recession in the 
second half of the year led to the margin for the 
year as a whole easing. In 2009, the operating 
margin fell further reflecting the downturn in 
ESAB’ s business, whilst Howden’ s operating 
margin remained in excess of 11 per cent. 
Howden  order  book
Description  of  measure
Howden’ s order book gives good visibility of new 
equipment sales and also gross margin for the 
following 12 to 18 months. Movements in the 
order book can be used as a leading indicator 
of Howden’ s performance relative to the market, 
and also to manage changes in capacity levels.
Performance
Howden’ s order book consistently grew until 
2009 when, despite the severe economic 
conditions prevailing, Howden continued to book 
orders but at levels slightly below its sales, leading 
to a modest fall in the order book during the year. 
Cash  flow  from  operations
Description  of  measure
We monitor cash flow from operations, but in 
doing so, we set targets which recognise that, 
as businesses grow, they tend to absorb cash 
into working capital. Our measure of cash flow 
from operations takes into account certain 
non-recurring items including expenditure on 
restructuring. 
 
Performance
Throughout the period, Charter has successfully 
increased the amount of cash generated from 
its operations. Cash flow from operations 
continued to improve in 2009, despite the fall in 
revenue and profit, as there was an increased 
focus on the control of working capital in 
particular in ESAB. 
Revenue
Description  of  measure
Revenue growth measures the success which 
we are having at increasing the volume of 
products sold and changes in the prices at which 
we are able to sell them. Revenue growth helps 
us to determine whether we are gaining or losing 
market share by region, product or end-user 
segment. 
Performance
Charter achieved strong revenue growth in both 
businesses until 2009. In 2009, ESAB’ s revenue 
fell, as the economic recession led to lower 
sales of consumables and equipment. Howden 
maintained its revenue in 2009, reflecting the 
strength of its opening order book, further growth 
in aftermarket revenues and favourable exchange 
rate movements.

Adjusted  earnings  per  share
Description  of  measure
Adjusted earnings per share shows the 
net profit generated for shareholders in an 
accounting period, after taking into account 
financing and tax. The measure is defined so as 
to exclude exceptional charges or income and 
other items considered by the Board to be not 
directly related to the underlying performance of 
our businesses.
Performance
Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled 
between 2005 and 2008. In 2009, adjusted 
earnings per share fell but still remained well 
above the figure achieved in 2005.
Equity  shareholders’  funds
Description  of  measure
Equity shareholders’ funds reflect the value of net 
assets available to shareholders. It is a measure 
of the strength of Charter’ s balance sheet 
and reflects the value of Charter’ s current and 
non-current assets and liabilities, including its net 
cash/(debt) position. 
Performance
Charter’ s balance sheet has strengthened 
considerably over the period, with equity 
shareholders’ funds increasing more than 
four-fold. During this time, the Company has 
moved from a position of modest net debt 
to net cash, despite a period of high capital 
expenditure, acquisitions financed out of cash 
flow and the resumption of dividend payments.
Capital  expenditure
Description  of  measure
The absolute level of capital expenditure and 
its relationship to the depreciation charge are 
indications of the extent to which Charter 
is investing in the productive capacity of its 
businesses, which might include increasing 
the absolute capacity of the businesses or 
measures to improve operating efficiency or 
customer service. 
Performance
Throughout the period, Charter’ s capital 
expenditure has been significantly in excess 
of depreciation as it has increased its global 
manufacturing capacity. Capital expenditure has 
been higher in ESAB than in Howden, reflecting 
in part their respective business models and 
relative sizes.
Lost  time  injury  frequency  rate
Description  of  measure
We recognise that financial performance is not 
a sufficient measure on its own. We operate in 
heavy engineering environments where there is 
considerable inherent risk and the safety of our 
employees is a key priority. We use a variety of 
measures, including Lost Time Injury Frequency 
Rate (‘LTIFR’), to assess the effectiveness of our 
health and safety performance.
Performance
LTIFR fell by around one-half during the period 
from 2007 to 2009 in which data has been 
systematically collected and verified, underlining 
Charter’ s commitment to employee welfare. 
Further information on our health and safety 
performance are set out in the Corporate 
responsibility report on pages 36 to 41.

Description  of  measure
Charter recognises that its technology is an 
important factor in maintaining the leadership 
of its products in the competitive markets in 
which it operates. Research and development 
expenditure is written off as incurred, except that 
certain development expenditure is capitalised as 
required by IAS 38.
Performance
Research and development expenditure has 
increased over the period including in 2009. 
The majority of this expenditure has been in 
ESAB. Howden engineers bespoke solutions 
for particular customers’ air and gas handling 
requirements but this expenditure is generally not 
classified as ‘research and development’.

New build jackup rigs
Lamprell has some of the 
world’s leading facilities for 
the construction of new build 
jackup drilling rigs. With a 
sophisticated engineering 
capability and state-of-the-
art construction and load out 
facilities, Lamprell has rapidly 
gained a reputation as a 
leading and reliable builder of 
drilling rigs for the international 
market. In May 2015 the 
Group successfully delivered 
its 27th jackup rig since its 
listing in 2006, comprising of 
14 LeTourneau Super 116E’s, 
seven Friede & Goldman Super 
M2’s and six multi-purpose 
GustoMSC vessels. 
Offshore platforms 
Lamprell has successfully 
undertaken a variety of 
offshore new build construction 
projects for the oil & gas 
industry . We construct complex 
living quarters, wellhead 
decks, topsides, jackets and 
various other offshore fixed 
facilities including modules 
and topsides for FPSO/FPU 
projects. In 2014 Lamprell  
was recognised by Guinness 
World Records for moving  
the heaviest load on trailers 
from its Jebel Ali facility . 
This was for the load out 
of the production, utilities 
and quarters deck destined 
for the Golden Eagle Area 
Development in the North Sea. 
Modules 
Lamprell fabricates 
packaged, pre-assembled 
and modularised units and 
has expertise constructing 
accommodation and complex 
process modules for onshore 
downstream projects. We are 
also looking to expand into 
modularised LNG. Lamprell’s 
modular fabrication activities 
offer a number of advantages 
over conventional construction. 
Fabrication and assembly are

facilities allowing us to ensure

and quality standards.

Chief Executive’s Review
“K3 has performed exceptionally 
well in the last 12 months in difficult 
market conditions, delivering 
excellent revenue and profits growth. ” 
Introduction
K3 has performed exceptionally well in 
the last 12 months in difficult market 
conditions, delivering excellent revenue 
and profits growth. Major initiatives 
during the year included a significant 
investment in Managed Services, 
continued development of our own IP , 
further complementary acquisitions 
and a group reorganisation to provide a 
stronger platform for growth.
The final six months of the financial 
year saw a particularly strong financial 
performance, with revenues up 38% 
to £28.13m (2010 H2: £20.32m) and 
adjusted operating profit
*5 
up 65% to 
£3.34m (2010 H2: £2.02m). With the 
first half year also being ahead of the 
prior year, the full year revenue was up 
20% on the same period last year at 
£52.80m (2010: 12 months £43.84m: 
18 months: £59.78m). Adjusted profit 
from operations
*6
 was up 27% at £9.58m 
(2010: 12 months £7.57m; 18 months 
£9.05m). The full year results included 
the benefit of the four acquisitions we 
made over the course of the financial 
year, which together contributed £7.98m 
to revenues and £0.88m to adjusted 
operating profit
*7
.
Our extensive customer base, today 
totalling 2,300 customers, is one of the 
most valuable assets we own and the 
year’s results demonstrate this. Existing 
customers have delivered some 89% 
of the Group’s sales, with 46% of sales 
recurring annually, from software 
licence and support renewals for the ERP 
systems we maintain. Once installed, an 
ERP software system can remain in place 
for over 15 years, providing K3 with 
substantial ongoing recurring income. 
As the Group continues to develop, a 
central plank of our growth strategy 
is the delivery of additional services 
and products to our large customer 
base. In particular, we are focused on 
the development of our hosting and 
managed services offering, which helps 
to reduce customers’ overall IT costs. We 
believe hosting and managed services 
represent a major opportunity for K3 
and have invested significantly this year 
in increasing our capability across all our 
products. The acquisition of Panacea, 
which contained a substantial managed 
service business in addition to its Sage 
customers, in November 2010, was a 
material step forward, adding critical 
mass, technical expertise and recurring 
income to our Managed Services 
Division. The delivery of hosting and 
managed services to our substantial 
customer base represents a major 
opportunity for K3 and we intend to 
invest further in these activities to fully 
exploit this major opportunity.
In a very difficult market, the level of our 
major contract wins was encouraging, 
totaling £11.1m compared to £12.4m for 
the same period last year.
Of particular note was the performance 
of our international business, based 
in The Netherlands, where two 
significant developments have driven 
strong growth. Firstly, we have been 
able to leverage successfully the two 
Pebblestone acquisitions we made in 
the second quarter of 2010 to establish 
K3 as a major supplier of ERP systems 
to the Dutch Fashion market and to 
build up the 30 country international 
partner channel for Group IP . Secondly, 
the business commenced a major global 
initiative with Inter IKEA Systems B.V. 
(the owner and franchisor of the IKEA 
concept, the largest customer in the 
Group), which will benefit results over an 
extended period.
A key part of our value proposition 
is the development of our own IP to 
enhance the market leading business 
solutions (Microsoft, SYSPRO and Sage)  K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011
9
that we offer. We invested over £1m in 
IP development during the year and 
this will help us to maintain our strong 
competitive positioning, creating 
further loyal customers and enhancing 
operating profits. K3 remains a member 
of Microsoft’s Inner Circle (reserved for 
its top partners worldwide) and our 
relationship with SYSPRO deepened 
with an exclusive global partnership 
agreement for hosting. 
We took the decision to expand into 
the Sage market in the first half of the 
financial year, to broaden the Group’s 
product portfolio, and made two 
acquisitions that have created a Sage 
Division, with 450 customers who 
contribute approximately £3.2m of 
recurring Sage income per annum. This 
will increase as we roll out our Sage 
hosting proposition over the coming 
year. We see very good opportunities 
to add further Sage customers, both 
organically and via acquisition, and 
believe that our hosting proposition will 
see strong uptake. 
We strengthened the Group’s 
organisational structure during the year 
to create a stronger platform for growth 
and have established four main trading 
divisions in addition to our Head Office. 
The four divisions are Microsoft UK, 
International, SYSPRO and Sage, and 
Managed Services. Reporting in future 
will reflect this new structure.
Financially, the Group remains strong, 
with good cash generation and banking 
facilities to support further acquisitions. 
This places us in a very good position to 
continue with our growth plans and we 
view prospects for K3 very positively.

Key Performance Indicators
The Board considers the key performance indicators by which it measures the performance of the Group 
to be revenue, gross margin and profit from operations, adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles, 
acquisition costs and exceptional costs. The performance indicators used by the Group are summarised 
below and the table sets out K3’s performance for the year under review.
Revenue is the gross revenue as reported 
in the financial statements, comprising 
software, hardware, consultancy, and 
support and managed services. This is 
a key measure of activity within each 
business segment and for the Group as 
a whole.
Gross margin percentage is calculated as 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
This measure identifies the level of 
contribution derived from each sale or 
component thereof. 
Adjusted profit from operations is 
calculated as profit from operations 
per the financial statements, adjusted 
for the impact of amortisation of 
acquired intangibles, acquisition costs 
and exceptional costs. This is a key 
performance indicator for quoted 
companies.
*Adjusted operating cash percentage 
is the operating cash generated after 
adding back cash flows in respect 
of regularising liabilities that were 
significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at 
the date of acquiring companies and 
trades, acquisition costs and exceptional 
reorganisation costs , divided by the 
adjusted operating profit. This is a key 
indicator in measuring the Group’s 
ability to convert operating profit into 
cash. See note 32.
Adjusted EPS is calculated as profit 
for the period, adjusted for the tax 
affected impact of acquired intangibles 
amortisation, exceptional reorganisation 
costs and acquisition costs, divided 
by the weighted average number of 
shares during the period. This is a key 
performance indicator for quoted 
companies.
Recurring revenue is the income 
provided for annual licence renewals 
and support for software used by our 
customers. This is a key indicator in 
measuring the underlying resilience and 
growth of the business.
Percentage of recurring revenue 
measures the growth of income 
providing core stability to the business. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

Operational Review
K3 changed its accounting year end to 30 June (from 31 December) in December 2009 to align its financial year end with Microsoft 
Corporation, with whom K3 has a strong trading relationship, and to provide shareholders with greater visibility of likely year end 
results as K3 generates the greater proportion of its revenue in the latter half of the calendar year.
The comparative audited figures for 2010 are for the 18 month period ended 30 June 2010, referred to throughout as “2010: 18 months” .
Unaudited results for the 12 months ended 30 June 2010 have been extracted from the 2010 financial statements (note 30). The 
Directors consider these provide a more meaningful comparison and are referred to throughout as “2010: 12 months” .
Overview
For the year to 30 June 2011, our Retail 
Software Division, which comprises 
our UK and international businesses, 
supplying Microsoft Dynamics software, 
generated revenues of £27.84m, up 3% 
over the year (2010: 12 months £26.96m; 
18 months £36.79m). Adjusted profit 
from operations
*8
 was £5.06m, up 32% 
over the year (2010: 12 months £3.80m; 
18 months £4.93m). In the six months 
to 30 June 2011, revenue showed an 
11% uplift to £15.24m against the prior 
period (2010: £13.71m) and adjusted 
operating profit
*9
 increased by 40% to 
£2.48m (2010: £1.77m). The acquisition 
of Clarita in April 2011 contributed 
revenue of £0.65m and operating profit 
of £0.10m to the overall results. All Key 
Performance Indicators are growing 
satisfactorily, though margin pressure 
has been evident as customers have 
staggered deal implementation and we 
have invested in Retail AX resources.
The Retail Software Division made 
excellent progress in the year to  
30 June 2011, securing £8.3m of major 
contract wins compared to £7.7m in the 
same period last year. Our international 
business, based in The Netherlands, 
performed especially well. In the UK, the 
strength of our multi-channel offering, 
incorporating our own IP , continues to 
support our performance.
Our library of IP in the Retail Software 
Division has grown over the year and 
includes multi-channel specialist 
modules (call centre, kiosk, retail store 
hospitality and Web linkages), fashion 
retail and wholesale modules.
UK
Revenues for the year ended to 30 June 
2011 were £19.43m, down 10% over 
the year (2010: 12 months £21.63m; 
18 months £29.43m) though in the six 
months to 30 June 2011 the decrease 
was only 2% on the same period last 
year, at £10.10m (six months to 30 June 
2010: £10.30m). The adjusted operating 
profit
*10
 over the year rose by 5% to 
£3.04m (2010: 12 months £2.90m; 18 
months £3.72m). The results for the six 
months include the acquisition of Clarita 
for a three month period.
The UK business secured a total of 
£5.6m major contract wins in the 
year compared with £7.7m for the 
same period last year. Major new wins 
included orders from Hobbycraft, Sam 
McCauley, the chemists and Topps Tiles. 
In the tougher retail environment, we 
have seen many customers buying in 
stages thus reducing initial deal size. 
The major orders we secured, providing 
a mixture of consultancy, software, 
enhancement and hardware revenues, 
were largely driven by our multi-channel 
offering, which supplies retailers 
with a fully integrated retail solution, 
encompassing online ordering, call 
centre management, internet kiosks, 
point of sale functionality and full ‘back 
office’ capability.

The value of our retail IP was evident 
again with good sales to the existing 
customer base, though margin was 
reduced due to resourcing of the AX 
Retail initiative. We will continue to 
invest heavily in retail IP , bringing the 
Microsoft AX product in line with our 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV portfolio and 
innovating further on both products. 
The partnership we signed at the 
beginning of the financial year with 
Omnica Ltd, the multi-channel software 
specialist, extends our AX capability in 
the retail sector, with specialist modules 
for the multi-channel sales. Our UK sales 
pipeline is healthy, with a number of 
deals potentially closing in the first half 
of the new financial year. 
International
Our Netherlands-based business, K3 
Business Solutions, performed strongly, 
increasing revenues over the year ended 
to 30 June 2011 by 57% to £8.41m  
(2010: 12 months £5.34m; 18 months 
£7.36m) and increasing adjusted 
operating profit
*11
 by 124% to £2.02m 
(2010: 12 months £0.90m; 18 months 
£1.21m). The last six months of the 
period saw revenues rise by 50% to 
£5.13m (six months to 30 June 2010: 
£3.41m) and adjusted operating profit
*12
 
grew by 112% to £1.27m (six months to 
30 June 2010: £0.60m).
The Dutch business has seen a step-
change in performance. There are 
two major factors driving this. The 
Pebblestone acquisitions made in the 
second quarter of 2010 established K3 as 
a major supplier of ERP systems into the 
Dutch fashion market, with a 30 country 
international partner channel for Group 
IP . We also commenced a major global 
initiative with Inter IKEA Systems B.V. (the 
owner and franchisor of the IKEA concept, 
the largest customer in the Group), which 
will benefit results over an extended 
period. Dutch retail sales are performing 
well, with deals closing on a regular basis, 
and we are seeing opportunities open up 
across Europe. The business is operating 
at full capacity and we are recruiting 
further resource to meet the demand we 
are currently generating.

Manufacturing Software Division
Overview
The Manufacturing Software Division 
comprises three business units, 
K3 Supply Chain Solutions (“SCS”), 
supplying SYSPRO ERP solutions, K3 AX 
specialising in process manufacturing 
and including the Sense Enterprise 
Solutions business (“Sense”) and small 
systems business based in Hook. 
Revenues from the Manufacturing 
Software Division for the year were flat 
at £15.47m (2010: 12 months £15.58m; 
18 months £21.32m) and adjusted 
operating profit
*13
 decreased by 15% to 
£3.50m (2010: 12 months £4.12m;  
18 months £4.49m). The Sense AX 
business, acquired in April 2011, 
contributed revenue of £0.56m and 
adjusted operating profit
*14 
of £0.14m. 
As a Division we have suffered margin 
pressure from our key suppliers which is 
likely to continue in the new financial year.
In the six months to 30 June 2011, 
revenue at £6.12m was up 8% (2010: 
£5.67m) but adjusted profit from 
operations
*15
 fell to £0.21m (2010: 
£0.42m).
There is strong seasonality in the 
Division’s income as the above revenue 
and profit profile illustrate. This 
seasonality is driven by the timing of 
SYSPRO software licence and support 
renewals, which are billed in October 
and are realised in cash during October 
to December. The value of this recurring 
income in the year to 30 June 2011 
was £9.13m (2010: 12 months £8.8m). 
This income stream continues to be 
very stable and highly predictable, 
reflecting the business critical nature 
of the systems we implement and 
support. The last six months have been 
difficult with deal cycles lengthening 
as manufacturing customers defer 
investment and our margins have also 
come under pressure from key suppliers. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011
13 *See note 33 on page 92 for further details
SCS
K3 Supply Chain Solutions (“SCS”), 
which supplies SYSPRO ERP solutions, 
delivered revenues broadly unchanged 
over the year at £10.36m (2010: 
12 months £10.40m; 18 months 
£14.08m) and adjusted profit from 
operations
*16
 were stable at £3.01m 
(2010: 12 months £3.14m; 18 months 
£3.38m).
In the six months to 30 June 2011, 
revenues were £3.43m (six months 
ended 30 June 2010: £3.45m) and the 
adjusted loss from operations
*17
 was 
£0.03m (six months ended 30 June 
2010: profit of £0.15m), reflecting 
both seasonality and margin pressure 
mentioned above.
New order intake at SCS remained 
under pressure over the year and in the 
light of this and cost pressure from our 
major supplier, the year’s results are very 
creditable. Results were supported by 
sales of additional services to customers 
as well as annual software licence 
and support income and overhead 
reductions. To have achieved broadly 
the same level of profit against the 
comparable period last year in these 
difficult market conditions has been an 
excellent result.
K3 AX
K3 AX, which addresses the process 
manufacturing marketplace, with 
product specialisation in fresh food and 
steel processing, has had an extremely 
disappointing year following the 
improved performance in the previous 
period. While revenue over the year to 
30 June 2011 was up by 15% to 
£2.92m (2010: 12 months £2.54m; 
18 months £3.34m), the adjusted loss 
from operations
*18
 was £0.31m (2010: 
12 months profit of £0.13m; 18 months 
loss of £0.18m). However, the second half 
of the year showed an improvement, with 
revenues at £1.65m (six months ended 
30 June 2010: £1.11m) and the adjusted 
operating loss
*19
 at £0.08m (six months 
ended 30 June 2010: loss of £0.07m).
Having closed five deals in the last period 
and expanded our delivery capacity, we 
found very soft demand this year and 
new software sales have been hard to 
close. Our development plans for the 
product range were also held back by 
substantial changes being implemented 
by Microsoft in the AX product. However, 
the acquisition of Sense in March 2011 
has brought critical mass and additional 
skills to the AX business unit, as well as 40 
new customers. It also positions K3 AX 
as one of the larger AX provider in the 
UK and we see very good opportunities 
to cross-sell our products and services 
to Sense’s existing customer base. 
The reduction in losses in the second 
half compared to the first half year is a 
reflection of closing three late deals and 
the profitability of Sense, acquired in the 
third quarter of the financial year, which 
contributed £0.56m of revenues and 
£0.14m of adjusted operating profits.
Small systems division, Hook 
(formerly in Chertsey)
Our small systems division, which 
comprises a customer base running 
smaller ERP systems, generated sales 
of £2.19m in the year (2010: 12 months 
£2.65m; 18 months £3.91m) and the 
adjusted profit from operations
*20
 was 
£0.79m (2010: 12 months £0.86m; 
18 months £1.29m). The second half of 
the year shows revenue of £1.03m (six 
months ended 30 June 2010: £1.12m) 
and an adjusted profit from operations
*21
 
of £0.32m (six months ended 30 June 
2010: £0.34m). As expected, revenues 
generated by this division continued 
to decay gently although we partly 
mitigated the impact of this by selling 
CRM services. Following the acquisition 
of Panacea in November 2010, we have 
relocated the business to Hook, which 
will underpin profitability.

Sage Division
We took the strategic decision to 
enter the Sage ERP marketplace in 
the period and two acquisitions in the 
first half (Panacea in November 2010 
and the Sage 200 business of 
FD Systems Limited in December 2010) 
have established K3 with a meaningful 
Sage presence. The Sage ERP solutions 
we now offer predominantly service 
the Distribution sector and our 
customer base totals approximately 
525 companies, delivering recurring 
income of approximately £3.2m of Sage 
sales per annum, derived from a mix of 
software licence and support.
The Division generated a partial revenue 
contribution of £4.15m (2010: £nil) and 
adjusted operating profit
*22
 contribution 
of £0.42m (2010: £nil). These revenues 
represent approximately 50% of the 
potential of these two businesses.
At the beginning of 2011, we combined 
the two acquisitions into one site at 
Hook and have been developing our 
Sage hosting proposition. This will roll 
out over the coming year and will place 
us in a strong position to cross-sell 
hosted solutions to new and existing 
Sage customers, mirroring the model 
we are deploying for our Microsoft and 
SYSPRO customers. 
We see a significant opportunity to 
develop our Sage Division and will 
continue to acquire complementary 
Sage businesses to grow K3’s contracted 
recurring revenues and leverage further 
hosting opportunities.

Managed Services Division
The Managed Services Division offers 
a range of application solutions both 
on-premises, hosted and via Software 
as a Service using hosting centres in 
New York, London and Edinburgh.
Over the year to 30 June 2011, 
revenues generated by the Managed 
Services Division almost quadrupled 
to £4.70m (2010: 12 months £1.23m; 
18 months £1.60m). Adjusted profit 
from operations
*23
 increased by 86% 
to £0.54m (2010: 12 months £0.28m; 
18 months £0.41m). In the six months 
to 30 June 2011, revenues rose almost 
3.5 times to £3.02m over the prior 
period (2010: £0.87m) and adjusted 
profit from operations
*24
 rose by 86% to 
£0.39m (2010: £0.21m). The managed 
services business of Panacea, acquired 
in November 2010, made a partial 
contribution of £2.64m to revenues 
and £0.25m to adjusted profit from 
operations
*25
.
The business is continuing to grow 
rapidly with strong interest in our 
managed services solutions from 
our customers. We see a substantial 
opportunity to develop the Managed 
Services Division and committed 
significant investment to its development 
during the year which accounts for the 
fall in gross margin and profitability 
lagging revenue growth. We will continue 
to invest in this opportunity.
In February 2011, we announced a 
potentially significant opportunity 
with SYSPRO, a leading developer of 
ERP solutions to the manufacturing 
sector globally. Under the terms of our 
agreement, we will be providing hosted 
Software as a Service on an exclusive 
basis worldwide to SYSPRO customers. 
We will be working with SYSPRO’s 
partner network to market this service 
and believe this could represent a 
material opportunity for us. 
The Division’s closing run rate of revenue 
at the year-end was £4.1m (2010: £2.33m).

Central costs for the year amounted 
to £0.25m (2010: 12 months £0.64m; 
18 months £0.78m). These costs 
included Directors’ costs, group human 
resources and accounting personnel, 
legal department and costs associated 
with the Plc. The costs are stated net of 
recovery of elements recharged to the 
operating units, which have increased 
with the expansion of the Group.
Our share of associated company 
losses in the year to 30 June 2011 was 
£nil (2010: 12 months £nil; 18 months 
£0.03m). This reflects the change in 
ownership structure of the underlying 
investment, which is now treated as an 
available-for-sale investment.
During the year we strengthened 
the Group’s organisational structure 
to create a stronger platform for 
growth which enabled the complete 
integration of the acquired businesses. 
This reorganisation cost £0.45m which 
has been shown as an exceptional cost 
within profit from operations. From 
1 July 2011, the reporting of results will 
reflect four trading Divisions; Microsoft 
UK, International, SYSPRO and Sage, and 
Managed Services; together with head 
office.

International IP Division
Central Division Group Reorganisation
Our International IP Division, established 
in June 2010 and based in Ireland, 
manages the portfolio of fashion and 
wholesale products acquired from 
Pebblestone, the Pebblestone reseller 
channel we bought in June 2011, as well 
as the Group’s other IP products suitable 
for distribution across our customer base. 
The benefit of our library of intellectual 
property is becoming increasingly 
evident in Group’s results, helping to 
enhance margins as well as sales. In 
the year, the Division contributed sales 
of £0.64m and an adjusted profit from 
operations
*26 
of £0.32m. Additional sales 
of £0.36m of K3 product are included 
within the results of the Retail Software 
Division.
During the year we enhanced the 
functionality of our Pebblestone product 
and established a product roadmap 
for its future development. We also 
refreshed the Pebblestone distribution 
network, which is showing good 
potential for the future.
We have continued to expand our library 
of IP across all operating units, especially 
hosting, Retail AX and Fresh Dynamics 
AX, mirroring the strategy of Microsoft. 
K3’s sector specific solutions therefore 
remain highly competitive and attractive 
to both new and existing customers.

library of intellectual

Strategy and Objectives
The Board’s strategy remains unchanged 
and is to establish K3 as one of Europe’s 
leading suppliers of Microsoft and 
Sage based supply chain management 
systems, with a particular emphasis 
on the growth markets of “hosted 
applications” and “cloud computing” .
Nearer term, the Board’s key objectives 
are to:
•	 achiev e 	 g r o wth 	 in 	 our 	 tar get 	 mar kets;
•	 cr ea t e 	 shar eholder 	 v alue 	 thr ough	
increases in adjusted earnings per 
share;
•	 g r o w 	 r ecur r ing 	 inc ome 	 lev els 	 and
•	 achiev e 	 pr og r essiv e 	 incr eases 	 in 	 the	
dividend.
Acquisitions since the last year have been 
made to accelerate the timescale over 
which this strategy is delivered.
Post Year End Events
After the year end, in July 2011, we 
completed two acquisitions, buying the 
Retail Merchandising Division of Azurri 
Computer Solutions Ltd (“Azurri Retail”) 
and FD Systems Ltd (“FDS”), the Sage 
solutions and e-commerce provider.
Azurri Retail, whose customers include 
Matalan, JJB Sports, Littlewoods and 
Holland & Barratt, generates recurring 
income of approximately £0.6m 
annually. It is currently being integrated 
with K3’s existing retail software 
operations.
Having acquired the Sage 200 business 
of FDS in December 2010, we bought 
the remainder of FDS seven months 
later. The deal has added 300 Sage 
customers and additional expertise 
across the full range of Sage products. 
FDS has also developed its own 
e-commerce solution, which integrates 
fully with Sage and Microsoft products.
Outlook
We are delighted with the progress 
K3 has made in the year under review 
and results illustrate the high degree of 
robustness to our earnings. A very large 
proportion of the Group’s income is 
recurring, derived from K3’s substantial 
customer base, which now numbers in 
excess of 2,300 customers.
The Group also continues to generate 
good cash flows and the very high level 
of major contract wins is also pleasing, 
pointing to the strength of our product 
offering in the markets we address.
Over the last year, we have seen 
the growth in the business that we 
anticipated in the 2010 financial report. 
We expect the business to grow further 
as we see the full year impact  
of acquisitions and the annualised 
impact of business wins in Managed 
Services. The Group remains 
well-funded. We will seek further 
complementary acquisitions to 
strengthen our position and continue 
the growth of the business.
We believe that K3 is well placed to 
deliver a strong performance over the 
coming year despite the uncertain 
economic outlook.

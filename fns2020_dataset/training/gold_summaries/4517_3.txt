4 I DE VERE GROUP PLC I CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
THE LORD DARESBURY
Non-executive Chairman
RESULTS AND EPS
Underlying Group turnover excluding the 
impact of disposals and exceptional items  
was £294.9 million, up by 7.5% on 2004, 
and underlying EBITDA rose by 6.7% to  
£67.8 million (2004: £63.5 million).  
Pre-exceptional EPS rose by 9.7% to  
30.68 pence (2004: 27.98 pence).
The Group has this year also realised 
signiﬁcant value for shareholders through 
the sale and manage-back of The De Vere 
Belfry. The net proceeds of this transaction 
were returned to shareholders via a special 
dividend in March 2005.
A revaluation has been carried out on the 
Group’s property portfolio, resulting in a 
net surplus of £102 million over book value. 
At the year-end, had the full surplus been 
included in the balance sheet, net assets per 
share would have amounted to 786 pence.
Total EPS, including exceptional items credited 
to proﬁt and loss account, was 107.26 pence.
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend  
of 9.44 pence per Ordinary share payable  
on 17 February 2006 to shareholders on the 
register at 20 January 2006. The ﬁnal dividend 
together with the interim dividend of  
4.58 pence per Ordinary share, makes a total 
Ordinary dividend of 14.02 pence (2004: 13.10 
pence), an increase of 7%. A special dividend of 
159 pence per share was paid in March 2005.

�� BOARD
Since the year-end we have strengthened 
our Board with the appointment of David 
Richardson, who joins as a Non-executive 
Director. I was also delighted to welcome 
Matthew Fearn in October 2005 as Group 
Finance Director and I am sure that both 
David and Matthew will bring new insight  
to our business.
Matthew replaces Roger Stubbs who retires 
in January. Roger has been instrumental 
to the Group’s development, particularly 
since he assumed the role of Group Finance 
Director in 1999. His commitment to the 
Group over the last 26 years is greatly 
appreciated and we wish him a long and 
happy retirement.
PEOPLE
The progress made this year could not 
have been achieved without the best 
efforts of all our staff, guided by a strong 
management team. It is clear that the Group 
has maintained its strong position in the 
marketplace, evidenced by the results of  
three benchmark industry surveys, which  
rank De Vere Hotels’ customer loyalty as the 
highest within the industry. We intend to 
build on this ﬁrm foundation by investing 
further in the development of our people 
through the roll-out of a new customer 
service training programme called ‘Shine!’ 
which commenced in the ﬁnal quarter.
I remain conﬁdent that the combined efforts 
of our teams and the impact of our four-part 
strategy will continue to deliver growth for 
our shareholders.
CURRENT TRADING & OUTLOOK
During the ﬁrst nine weeks of the new 
ﬁnancial year like-for-like turnover at De Vere 
Hotels, excluding DVRO, increased by 2.9% 
and RevPAR on the same basis grew by 4.2%.
Timeshare sales at the new Carrick site have 
lifted DVRO turnover by over 100%. However, 
sales conversion, having improved over 
August and September, turned more variable 
in October and November such that margins 
are under continued pressure. 
In Village, like-for-like sales grew by 3.4% 
whilst RevPAR, driven by increased occupancy, 
was ahead by 3.0%.
Health & ﬁtness trading conditions remain 
challenging with like-for-like membership 
down 1.6% and 1.4% in Greens and Village 
respectively. Like-for-like sales in Greens are 
down on last year by 0.4%.
Cost pressures from energy and business 
rates continue to place pressure on margins. 
In spite of signiﬁcant increases seen in 2005, 
the anticipated increases for 2006 are £1.5 
million in De Vere Hotels, £1.2 million in 
Village and £0.8 million in Greens. However, 
these increases will be partially offset by 
continued progress expected on operational 
efﬁciency initiatives.
Following the ﬁre at G&J Greenall the team 
were back distilling within seven days, an 
incredible accomplishment. Bottling has 
been outsourced and customer relationships 
are being maintained on a positive footing. 
However, comparisons to last year are 
meaningless and importantly our insurance 
covers loss of proﬁt.
Looking forward, we are conﬁdent that 
our reservations and revenue management 
strategies will drive accommodation revenue 
ahead of the market. Health and ﬁtness 
trading is likely to remain difﬁcult and action 
is being taken in DVRO to ensure that we 
emerge from the December/January quiet 
period in a stronger position.
Notwithstanding external cost pressures that 
are being felt across the industry, we are 
cautiously optimistic about the outcome for 
the year as a whole.

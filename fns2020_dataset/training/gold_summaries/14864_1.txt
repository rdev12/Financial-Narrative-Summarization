CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
At the end of 2014, StatPro Revolution 
accounted for 18% of Group recurring 
revenues, marking an inflexion point for 
StatPro on the path to becoming a pure 
cloud services provider.
Justin Wheatley
As expected, the roll out of 
StatPro Revolution has opened 
up a number of new markets 
and opportunities – both 
geographically and by types of 
customers, including hedge 
funds and private wealth  
asset managers. 
Overview
StatPro has a 15 year track record of 
growing sustained long term revenue 
streams – with an average renewal 
rate of 94% over that period.
The Group has reached an inflexion 
point in the roll out of its cloud-based 
product StatPro Revolution. Its 
annualised revenue jumped by 68% 
and now contributes some 18% of the 
Group’s total annualised recurring 
revenue (‘ARR’) – up from 11%. 
The Group anticipates that it will 
continue the process of converting its 
clients from its StatPro Seven product 
to StatPro Revolution. The timing for 
converting a client will largely depend 
on the client’s own requirements but 
StatPro expects the bulk will convert 
over the next three to four years.
In 2014, approximately 78% of new 
sales were upsells to existing clients.
At the start of 2014 StatPro launched 
its AIFMD module which, together with 
the UCITS module, has sold very well.
At the same time, as expected, the roll 
out of StatPro Revolution has opened 
up a number of new markets and 
opportunities - both geographically 
and by types of customers, including 
hedge funds and private wealth 
asset managers.
 
Total Group revenues grew 6% on a 
constant currency basis to £32.02 
million, (2013 actual: £32.49 million) 
and the Group’s ARR as a whole also 
grew 4% on a constant currency basis 
to £29.39 million (2013 at constant 
currency: £28.30 million). Profits were 
reduced as expected as StatPro 
continued its investment programme 
to underpin future revenues and 
growth potential. The forward order 
book of contracted revenue grew by 
7% to £38.74 million (2013 at constant 
currency: £36.36 million). Revenues 
were up 8% in EMEAA and up 2% in 
North America on a constant currency 
basis.
The Board is recommending that  
the dividend increases by 4% to 2.9p 
(2013: 2.8p).
Strategy
StatPro provides portfolio analysis 
and data for the international asset 
management industry, a highly 
regulated and expanding sector. Its 
sophisticated solutions address the 
complexity of investment processes 
driven by a number of industry 
factors including multi-jurisdictional 
compliance, regulatory change and 
rising demand for cloud-based 
reporting and analysis.
Globally, the total figure for assets 
under management is estimated  
at over $87 trillion
1
 with significant 
compound growth over the past 
20 years. At the same time, demand 
from the asset management industry 
for StatPro products is being driven by 
the increasing requirement for more 
types of analysis, as well as the need 
for greater levels of accuracy and 
faster delivery of analysis and data.
StatPro achieves high client retention 
through a combination of long term 
contracts and deeply embedded 
systems, underpinned by superior 
levels of expertise and service and 
continuous innovation. 
In early 2011, StatPro introduced 
StatPro Revolution, its cloud-based 
highly centralised platform with 
extensive data and portfolio  11
capabilities. Over the past four years, 
StatPro has continued to service its 
existing client base whilst upselling 
the cloud capabilities that StatPro 
Revolution offers. 
At the same time, StatPro Revolution 
has opened a range of new 
addressable markets to StatPro  
within the asset management sector, 
including hedge funds, private wealth 
businesses and fund administrators 
wishing to offer portfolio analytics as  
a service to their clients.
At the end of 2014, recurring revenue 
from StatPro Revolution accounted 
for 18% of Group recurring revenues, 
marking an inflexion point in the 
revenue mix for StatPro on the path 
to becoming a pure cloud services 
provider. 
This has resulted both from upselling 
StatPro Revolution to existing clients 
as well as new sales resulting from  
the enlarged market opportunity that 
StatPro Revolution addresses. At the 
end of 2014, 46% of recurring software 
contract value was derived from 
customers who have signed up for 
StatPro Revolution, as StatPro 
migrates its stable cash generative 
customer base onto this lower cost, 
higher-margin cloud-based solution 
with international scalability.
Current trading and outlook
In 2015, StatPro has continued to 
maintain high levels of recurring 
revenue whilst driving growth in sales 
of StatPro Revolution to both its 
existing customer base and to new 
types of customers, including hedge 
funds and private wealth managers.
The Group’s recently signed 
three year €4 million  
(£3.1 million) contract with  
a large European asset 
manager to transition its 
StatPro Seven platform to 
StatPro Revolution clearly 
demonstrates the upsell, 
conversion potential and value 
uplift in StatPro Revolution.
The current financial year has started 
well and is in line with the Board’s 
expectations. The Group has some 
£38.7 million in contracts revenue 
secured over the next few years, of 
which £9.7 million is for StatPro 
Revolution. With this level of 
momentum, the Group believes it will 
continue to see further growth in 
StatPro Revolution revenues.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Strategy implementation
2014 has been a successful year; StatPro 
has seen strong growth in StatPro 
Revolution ARR, up 68% to £5.42 million 
(2013: £3.22 million) and continued 
stability for the StatPro Seven platform 
with total ARR of £20.28 million at  
end December 2014 (£21.21 million 
before impact of StatPro Revolution 
conversions) (2013: £21.20 million). 
The Group has made good progress 
in implementing a strategy to convert 
clients from the StatPro Seven 
platform to the StatPro Revolution 
platform with 46% by value of 
software clients using StatPro 
Revolution. StatPro has a growing list 
of clients that it expects to convert to 
StatPro Revolution in due course as it 
rolls out further functionality. 
In June 2014, StatPro implemented 
a new pricing policy, requiring a 
minimum relationship fee from new 
clients of $18,000 p.a. (up from $1,200 
p.a.). This has increased new revenue 
per client although the numbers of 
new clients being added has slowed. 
By focusing attention and resources 
on more profitable clients, StatPro has 
also improved its basic operating cost 
model. In 2015, the Group will focus on 
migrating those clients that pay less 
than $18,000 p.a. to the new minimum 
subscription level.
In 2014, senior management visited 
over 150 of StatPro’s largest clients 
(representing approximately 80% 
by value of our subscription base), 
spanning Europe, North America, 
Australia, Asia and South Africa, to 
gauge their clients’ perspectives on 
their businesses and how StatPro’s 
new technology is supporting them. 
Acceptance of cloud-based services is 
now almost universal. The economic 
case for the cloud now looks irresistible 
and, even where there is still some 
doubt, it is likely that these fears will be 
overcome. The greatest common worry 
for StatPro’s clients is to meet an ever 
growing list of regulations, whilst 
keeping IT budgets at a reasonable 
level. For many clients, there is also  
the threat of competitors being able to 
use technology to deliver a far better 
service at a lower cost point.
The Group anticipates that it will 
continue the process of converting its 
clients from StatPro Seven to StatPro 
Revolution over the next few years. 
The timing for converting a client will 
largely depend on the client’s own 
requirements but StatPro expects the 
bulk will convert over the next three to 
four years. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Approximately 78% of new 
sales in 2014 were upsells to 
existing clients. The Group 
believes that StatPro 
Revolution is particularly well 
adapted for repeat sales  
to clients and that existing 
clients will continue to be a 
rich source of new business. 
With a large base of approximately 
500 clients, StatPro has a ready-made 
market to sell additional services, 
portfolios and modules.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
Cloud
Development of the StatPro Revolution 
cloud platform has gone well in 
2014 with some very significant new 
functionality being delivered. At the 
start of 2014 StatPro launched its 
AIFMD module which, together with 
the UCITS module, has sold very well 
and now accounts for approximately 
18% of StatPro Revolution recurring 
revenue. StatPro was proud to receive 
an award for this module for the Best 
Risk Initiative 2014 from Waters Buy 
Side Technology Magazine. 
Additionally, StatPro launched 
Advanced Equity Attribution which 
means that StatPro Revolution offers 
the very latest and most sophisticated 
functionality available for equity 
attribution. The Group believes this will 
encourage the conversion of clients on 
StatPro Seven to StatPro Revolution in 
order to access the improved 
functionality.
During the course of 2015, StatPro 
will launch the Advanced Risk Module 
within StatPro Revolution, which offers 
significantly more functionality than 
the risk module in StatPro Seven. The 
Group anticipates that many of its risk 
clients using StatPro Seven will convert 
to this product in due course.
The Group is also building a new high 
volume calculation platform using 
Apache
TM
 Hadoop
®
 technology 
which will enable it to offer StatPro 
Revolution to clients with extremely 
large portfolios and benchmarks. This 
will form an integral part of StatPro’s 
advanced fixed income attribution 
module planned for release in 2016.
StatPro has decided to rebrand 
StatPro R+ as the performance 
module within StatPro Revolution, 
thus simplifying the naming convention 
for all new products on the StatPro 
Revolution platform. The StatPro 
Revolution performance module is 
progressing as planned and StatPro 
will be releasing the full replacement 
of StatPro Seven to several clients on 
a beta basis in the second half of the 
year and go live in 2016.
StatPro markets its data services 
in StatPro Revolution as part of a 
bundled service, and continues to 
expand the depth and quality of data 
for StatPro Revolution. To make the 
user experience as smooth as possible, 
StatPro has woven together raw data 
with its very large pricing library to 
produce further data for risk and fixed 
income analysis. 
Each market has different conventions 
and habits and StatPro Revolution 
is able to cater for hundreds of 
methodologies to give users the view 
of their portfolio to suit their specific 
requirements. This is one of the 
ways that StatPro Revolution is a 
considerable improvement on StatPro 
Seven. StatPro Revolution provides 
software, IT and data in a combined 
service that enables StatPro to offer 
a significantly enhanced service.
StatPro Seven 
Repeat revenue from StatPro Seven 
was very solid in 2014 with new sales 
largely offsetting reductions. New 
sales tend to come from existing 
clients buying additional modules 
and user licences as well as new 
sales of StatPro Composites. 
StatPro continues to support 
its clients on the StatPro Seven 
platform, offering upgrades 
and maintenance. StatPro 
Seven provides essential 
services for the Group’s clients 
by delivering accurate and 
comprehensive analysis for 
reporting to their clients.
Client feedback indicates that the 
operators of StatPro Seven want 
greater control over their data so that 
they have higher confidence that they 
will always publish accurate analysis. 
Whereas in the past, sending out 
approximately correct performance 
numbers was common practice, the 
new regulatory environment makes 
this unacceptable. This in turn has 
led to clients expanding the use of 
accurate systems like StatPro Seven to 
a broader range of portfolios such as 
private wealth mandates. This is where 
StatPro Revolution will offer the crucial 
solution: complete control of data and 
huge scale and speed compared to 
StatPro Seven and other systems 
using older technology.

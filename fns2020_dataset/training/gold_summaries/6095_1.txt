 In the period under review the Group has
commenced the implementation of its strategy
to become the dominant retailer of laminate
and wooden flooring within the UK. Total
stores trading at 31 December 2004 stood
at 121, a net increase of 25 over the year. 
Financial performance
As the acquisition of Anglo Baltic Limited
occurred on 25 March 2004, these accounts
comprise the nine months trading period of
the acquired activities to 31 December 2004.
The figures referred to in my review relate
to the twelve month pro forma figures for the
Group. Comparison of these figures to those
for the year ended 31 December 2004 has
been included in the Chairman’s report.
Sales growth has been buoyant in 2004.
The Group achieved a like for like sales
increase of 22.9%, with overall sales up by
78.3% (£44.2m in 2003 to £78.8m in 2004),
based on the proforma results, for the 12 months
to 31 December 2004. This growth compares
favourably with an estimated market growth
of 13%, thus indicating gains in market share
and further consolidating our position
as market leader.
Gross margin improved by 0.9% (2003: 47.1%,
2004: 48.0%). This resulted from improved
purchasing power due to volume growth,
better negotiation with suppliers and increased
sales of accessories which produce higher than
average margins. In addition the final quarter
benefited from newly introduced supplier
rebate schemes. Such schemes will be a focus
of supplier negotiation in 2005 and should
lead to further gross margin enhancement.
Operational review
In December 2004 the Group acquired
the leasehold of a new warehouse facility
in Oldbury, situated next to the M5 motorway.
This will give the Group the necessary capacity
needed for our stated target of 350 stores
in the UK. The warehouse will officially open
in April 2005.
Focus on our stockholding and improved
management information enabled the
company to reduce its stockholding days
to 86 (2003: 89) and we will continue our
efforts to improve this further.
The business has a history of cost efficiency
and effectiveness, and operating costs in the
year represented 36.57% of sales compared
with 40.22% for the same period in 2003.
We will be no different going forward in that
we will keep costs to a minimum, and strive
to increase productivity.
Market position
The total laminate and wood flooring market
is estimated to be valued at £353 million,
excluding accessories, in the United Kingdom,
and Floors 2 Go’s share of this is approximately
16.5% (Source: AMA research).
The United Kingdom market is forecast to
grow at a minimum compound rate of 8% per
annum between 2005 and 2009 and we will
continue to exploit such growth by opening
new stores and consolidating further the
market position of our established portfolio.
The growth has been helped by greater
popularity in wood and laminate flooring
in that it is cost effective, easier to fit and more
hygienic than other flooring types. The increased
number of TV homestyle and DIY programmes,
coupled with the Group’s intensive media
advertising has reinforced this message,
bringing good results.
Our strengths that differentiate ourselves from
our competitors are as follows:
 Specialist product knowledge of our
in-store staff.
 Customer service.
 Stock breadth, availability and quality.
 Location of stores – 121 nationwide in
prime locations.
 Competitive pricing – we are the only laminate
retailer that buys direct from manufacturers,
rather than through distributors.
 Repeat business and recommendations
represent 40% of sales.
The strategy of the Group is broken down over
four key areas:
 To continue to take market share from our
competitors, whilst opening stores throughout
the UK. We have 121 stores open currently
and aim to grow to 350 stores long-term.
Our target for 2005 is 25 new stores.
 To continue to provide excellent value,
service (before, during and post sale) to
our customers. Our level of repeat business
is something we are extremely proud of.
 To improve profitability by increased sales,
increased gross margin, and cost reduction
and control, which should invariably
increase shareholder value.
 To maintain the high calibre of staff employed
by the Group, whilst ensuring that as
we expand, new recruits will also meet
our high standards. Training is key in
the Group, and we are currently working
towards the Investor In People accreditation.
Finally I would like to take this opportunity
in thanking all of our employees, suppliers
and advisors for their support and hard work
during the year.
I would also like to thank our customers for
their loyalty in choosing Floors 2 Go and hope
they continue to do so in the future.

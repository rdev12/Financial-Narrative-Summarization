 Over the year under review, all the
main operating companies produced
excellent results, each generated a
net contribution, and all companies
across the Group demonstrated their
ability to deliver consistent organic
growth despite challenging market
conditions.  Consequently, Group
turnover increased by 58 per cent
whilst operating profit increased by 97
per cent over the year.  
Nelson Bostock Communications
Limited (“NBC”), a leading public
relations agency founded in 1987,
was acquired in October 2003 and
has enjoyed a very encouraging first
five and a half months as part of the
Group.  Its acquisition was funded by
a Placing and Open Offer of shares,
which raised £4.27m for the Group.
Following the acquisition of NBC,
Creston has a broad range of focused
marketing services businesses, with a
strong balance sheet and cash flows.  
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS 
The Group operations are all in
marketing services. The main
subsidiaries comprise Marketing
Sciences Limited (“MSL”) -
quantitative and qualitative market
research, The Real Adventure
Marketing Communications Limited
(“TRA”) - direct marketing and
customer relationship marketing, EMO
Group Limited (“EMO”) - marketing
communications and channel
marketing and NBC - public relations.
The Board considers that all these
different aspects of marketing services
constitute one business segment. 
MSL 
The turnover of MSL and its
subsidiary MSTS showed an increase
of 16 per cent on the previous year, a
particularly strong performance
compared to the British Market
Research Association’s reported
growth of 3 per cent for 2003.
Combined operating profit increased
by 50 per cent.  
MSL’s performance was underpinned
by over two-thirds of its turnover being
generated by repeat business. MSL
provides a wide range of quantitative
and qualitative research services to
clients such as Tesco, Unilever and
Kimberly-Clark. Key new clients won
in the year include Royal Mail and
Sony Ericsson.
MSTS is continuing to generate record
levels of new business enquiries and
is expected to continue its profitable
growth.  Key new clients won in the
year include Nestlé, Campbell’s, Arla
and Heinz. 
TRA
Turnover was 18 per cent higher than
in 2003 and operating profit grew by
21 per cent.
Repeat income represented 68 per
cent of turnover, primarily as a result
of TRA’s close working relationship
with its clients such as Lloyds Black
Horse, Pfizer and Cow & Gate, and
implementation of proven strategies in
direct marketing and CRM.
Significant new work has been won
from BSkyB, Mates Condoms and
Kerry Foods. 
EMO 
EMO increased its turnover by 4 per
cent on the previous year reflecting
the move away from low margin print.
However operating profit increased by
12 per cent on a like for like basis
although EMO was only part of the
Group for four months in 2003.
BMW, Wimpey and Bang & Olufsen
have been growth clients for EMO.  A

Chief Executive’s Overview
Creston Plc Annual Report and Accounts CTC was Honda.  Sky Rock, the EMO
owned digital marketing company,
supplies key design expertise for BMW
dealer websites.  
NBC
Creston acquired NBC on 16 October
2003 and the results therefore reflect
only five and a half months’ trading.
Full year operating profit grew by 16
per cent compared to the previous year.
NBC has shown its resilience to
downturns in market conditions and
today is ranked as the fifteenth largest
UK agency, and as the seventh largest
agency in the technology sector.  The

trading performance since acquisition.
In the light of its success in attracting a
range of leading organisations to its
stable of clients including BMW 
and Freeview.
International
It is Creston’s intention to become an
international marketing services
group in order to provide its clients
with an international reach beyond
that provided by the existing range of
affiliates. To this end, over the last
year we have investigated the market
in Germany, Benelux and the 
USA and hope to bring forward
opportunities in the current 
financial year. 
Outlook
I am pleased to report that the current
financial year has started well with
performance ahead of budget .
Business prospects are running at a
high level, creating a strong platform
for future growth. 
We are starting to see the fruits of the
integration of the businesses acquired
in 2002 and 2003, with an increasing
number of companies working
together to develop Group solutions to
meet clients’ needs.  In particular,
companies are co-operating to
encourage client referrals and create
joint products as well as to leverage
the Group’s specialist marketing skills
within each business to generate
cross-selling opportunities.

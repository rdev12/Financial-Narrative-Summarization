Group at a glance
The Group
Flowtech Fluidpower plc (“Flowtech” or 
“the Group”) is the leading distributor of 
technical fluid power products to over 
3,600 customers in the UK and Northern 
Europe. With modern distribution facilities 
in the UK, ROI and Benelux we offer an 
unrivalled range of both Original Equipment 
Manufacturer (“OEM”) products, as well as 
our own ranges sourced exclusively to the 
Group (“Exclusive Brands”).
During the year the Group had two 
operating divisions:
•	 Flowtechnology operating in the UK 
(“FTUK”) Northern Europe (“FTB”)
•	 Power Motion Control (“PMC”)
FTUK and FTB operate the same business 
model in the UK and Northern Europe 
respectively and focus on supplying 
distributors and resellers of industrial 
MRO (maintenance, repair and operation) 
products, primarily serving urgent orders 
rather than bulk offerings. The PMC division 
specialises in the design and assembly of 
engineering components and hydraulic 
systems, which are further enhanced by 
component supply along with a service and 
repair function. Since the year end a third 
division, “Process”, has been established 
which will focus on distribution of industrial 
components to the process sectors. All 
three divisions have overlapping product 
sets allowing procurement synergies to be 
exploited.
The Group has established a key position 
in the fluid power supply chain. The focus 
on core competencies within the fluid 
power market has been central to our 
continued success and this focus will 
support our long term strategy. In addition, 
Flowtech continues to deliver and develop 
its added value services to support its 
customers through organic development 
of its product ranges and acquisition of 
complementary businesses.
FTUK is based in Skelmersdale, 
Lancashire, where all Group functions are 
also located. In Europe, FTB operates from 
a single site in Deventer in the eastern 
region of Holland and services customers 
principally in Holland and Belgium. 
PMC operates from four sites. Originally 
established in Knowsley, Merseyside, 
sites in Lisburn and Dungannon, Northern 
Ireland and Dublin, ROI were added 
following the acquisition of the Nelson Fluid 
Power group (“NFP”) in July.
The Group’s business is directed by the 
Board and managed by the Executive 
Directors, led by the Chief Executive. To 
support the development and alignment 
of the Group’s business objectives, an 
Operational Board has been introduced to 
control and deliver the strategic goals as 
defined by the plc Board. This Operational 
Board includes the Managing Director from 
each business unit as well as the Group’s 
CEO and CFO. This team will maintain a 
clear focus on developing the business in 
line with market requirements.

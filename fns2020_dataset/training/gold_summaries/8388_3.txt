Chairman’s Statement
We achieved a creditable operating profit performance with 
good results from our Invensys Operations Management  
and Invensys Rail businesses and a resilient performance from  
our Invensys Controls business in the face of very difficult 
market conditions. 
As I mentioned in last year’s Annual Report, I will be retiring 
from my role as Chairman and director of Invensys after 
this year’s AGM on 17 July 2009. In this, my final statement 
to shareholders, I would therefore like to reflect upon the 
significant achievements that the Group has made during  
the last six years.
I became Chairman of Invensys in 2003. Since then:
• 	 	 o u r 	 n e t 	 d e b t , 	 w h i c h 	 s t o o d 	 a t 	 o v e r 	 £ 1 . 5 	 b il li o n 	 i n 	 2 0 0 3 , 	 
has been reduced to the point where we are now debt  
free and have over £300 million of net cash and deposits;
• 	 	 o u r 	 l e g a c y 	 li a b ili t i e s , 	 e x c l u d i n g 	 p e n s i o n s , 	 h a v e 	 r e d u c e d 	
from £700 million to just £77 million;
• 	 	 w e 	 h a v e 	 p ro g r e s s e d 	 f ro m 	 r e p o r t i n g 	 a n 	 o v e r a l l 	 l o s s 	 o f 	 
nearly £1.5 billion in the year to 31 March 2003 to a net 
profit of £133 million;
• 	 	 o u r 	 m a r k e t 	 c a p i t a li s a t i o n 	 h a s 	 i n c r e a s e d 	 f ro m 	 £ 3 5 0 	 m il li o n	 
in 2003 to around £1.6 billion today;
• 	 	 w e 	 h a v e 	 r e a c h e d 	 a 	 p o s i t i o n 	 w h e r e 	 w e 	 a r e 	 n ow 	 a b l e	 
to pay a dividend for the first time since 2003; and
• 	 	 w e 	 h a v e 	 r e j o i n e d 	 t h e 	 F T S E 	 1 0 0 	 I n d e x , 	 i n 	 J u n e 	 2 0 0 8 , 	
and have been reclassified as a technology company, 
recognising the significant change in our businesses  
during recent years.
It is with some sadness that I have to note that our shareholders 
have lost some of the value of their investment in Invensys in 
recent times, although most of this has been mirrored by the 
declines shown by many companies in our sector: overall our 
relative performance has been in line with our peer group.
I would like to pay tribute to everyone who has been at Invensys 
during my time as Chairman, particularly Ulf Henriksson and 
my other Board colleagues, without whom the Invensys 
recovery could not have happened.
The Board and our people
I am delighted that Sir Nigel Rudd, who became a director 
and Deputy Chairman on 1 January 2009, will be taking over 
from me as Chairman after the AGM. Sir Nigel has a long and 
distinguished industrial career, and is currently Chairman of 
BAA and Pendragon and a non-executive director of BAE 
Systems and Sappi. His previous chairmanships include 
Alliance Boots, Pilkington, Williams Holdings and Kidde, and  
he was also a director and Deputy Chairman of Barclays Bank.
Martin Jay 
Chairman
Your company has had another good 
year despite the difficult economic 
conditions that have affected the 
global economy.  Invensys plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2009  |  9
Steve Hare, who has been our Chief Financial Officer since 
2006, informed the Board in November 2008 that he will 
be leaving Invensys at the end of May 2009 to pursue a new 
challenge. During his time with us, he has made a great 
contribution by achieving the strong financial position that 
we find ourselves in today, in particular in driving strong 
operational cash flow from each of our businesses and the 
signing of our new five year banking facility in July 2008.  
On behalf of the whole Board, I would like to thank Steve  
for his efforts and wish him every success in the future.
As previously announced, Wayne Edmunds, who is currently 
CFO of Invensys Process Systems, will become our Chief 
Financial Officer from 1 June 2009. Wayne joined the Group 
from Reuters America, where he had been SVP of Finance, and 
has previously held senior financial roles in the technology 
sector, including 17 years with Lucent Technologies. Wayne 
is relocating to the UK and will work out of the Group’s 
headquarters in London. He has been working with Steve Hare 
during the past two months to ensure a smooth handover  
of responsibilities.
Jean-Claude Guez, who has been a non-executive director 
since 2003, will not be seeking re-election at the AGM and 
will be retiring from the Board at the end of that meeting. 
It has been a pleasure working with Jean-Claude over the 
past six years and I am very grateful to him for his significant 
contributions and support during this time. We all wish him 
well in the future.
Dr Martin Read, formerly Chief Executive of LogicaCMG, and 
Francesco Caio, formerly Chief Executive of Cable & Wireless, 
will be joining the Board as non-executive directors on 18 July 
2009. I am delighted that Martin and Francesco have agreed 
to join the Board. They each have enormous experience 
running large international enterprises and I know that they will 
contribute greatly to the next stage of Invensys’ development.
The result of these changes is that Invensys continues to have 
a strong and experienced Board with a good balance of 
executive and non-executive directors. 
I would like to thank everyone at Invensys for their efforts 
during the past year. Many have had to deal with difficult 
markets which have posed additional challenges, and they  
have met these with considerable enthusiasm and expertise.
Dividend
The strength of the Group’s financial position, our excellent 
operational cash flow and the resilience being shown by 
our longer-cycle businesses within Invensys Operations 
Management and Invensys Rail has given the Board confidence 
that this is the right time to pay a dividend to shareholders for 
the first time since 2003. However, in light of current global 
economic conditions, the Board has decided to start at a 
prudent level which should allow a progressive dividend policy 
going forward. The Board has therefore recommended the 
payment of a final cash dividend for the year of 1.5p per share 
which, subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM on  
17 July 2009, will be paid on 7 August 2009 to shareholders  
on the register at 26 June 2009. 
Outlook
Relative to the market, there is strength in demand for our 
projects and solutions within our newly formed Invensys 
Operations Management division, and Invensys Rail has been 
successful in both its core and export markets. This gives us 
confidence that both will continue to perform well during 
the current financial year. Invensys Controls faces continued 
weakness in its markets and we continue to manage it for 
positive cash flow. 
Our strong financial position is enabling us to take further 
actions in the current year to protect profitability and cash flow 
across the Group and, based upon our current expectations, 
we anticipate that restructuring charges in the current year will 
be around £65 million. 
Overall we look to the future with confidence and expect  
to improve our performance in the current year.

Chairman

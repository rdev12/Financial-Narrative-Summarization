• Gross profit more than doubled, up 111% to £2,089,457, compared to £991,169 last 
year. 
 
• Positive EBITDA (1) of £149,378 for the year compared to an EBITDA loss of 
£499,429 last year. 
 
• Maiden operating profit (2) for the full year of £78,647 compared to a loss of 
£582,816 last year. 
 
• The loss retained for the full year (3) after all costs, reduced by £626,324, down 70% 
to £270,739 compared to £897,063 in the previous year. 
 
Acquisitions 
 
• All share acquisition of Solwise Telephony Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary 
Sipswitch Limited completed on 13 January 2010 for an initial consideration of 
£180,957 in shares plus the assumption of debt of £23,958 also satisfied in shares.  
 
Balance sheet highlights 
 
• Cash at the year end amounted to £697,189 compared to the previous year of 
£586,222, a 19% increase  
 
• A placing on 22 September 2010 by way of an issue of 128,571,429 new Ordinary 
Shares at 0.35p per share, raised £450,000. The placing was at a premium of 
approximately 18.64% over the closing mid-market price of 0.295p on 21 September 
2010. 
 
• Group net assets increased to £1,319,743 (2009: £921,645) 
 
Reduction in group subsidiary operating companies 
 
• During the year, the group completed a reduction in the number of operating group 
subsidiary entities, which had expanded following a series of acquisitions over the 
years, and there are now only three main operating units. We expect to see some 
modest reductions in administration costs in the future as a result of the 
consolidation.  
 
BBC high-profile contracts 
 
• Delivering certain high-profile voice and data requirements of the BBC has been a 
significant success this year. We expect to be able to service high-profile contracts 
of this nature again in 2011.

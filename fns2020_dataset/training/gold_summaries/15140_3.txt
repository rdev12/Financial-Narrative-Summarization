Chairman’s statement
Review of the year
I am pleased to report a record year in 
the continuing development of the Group. 
Our strategy of producing innovative, high 
quality and cost-effective instruments to an 
increasingly cost-conscious market, coupled 
with the strong investment in 2008 and 2009, 
has really started to bear fruit, both for our 
own branded and OEM products. 
Given the growth of the business, and to 
provide greater clarity of progress in the key 
markets in which we operate, the Group 
is for the first time reporting across three 
segments: SI Brand, OEM and Industrial. 
Results
Revenue for the period was £7 .045 million 
(2009: £4.541 million) and profit before tax 
increased nearly five-fold to £1.549 million 
(2009: £264,000). 
A large part of this growth has arisen from 
sales in the OEM segment which accounted 
for 35% of total revenue (2009: 32%). 
A year of progress and innovation
“ The Group has undergone 
yet another year of 
transformation, successfully 
meeting the demands 
of rapid growth. We have 
continued to invest heavily 
in the business while R&D 
capability has undergone 
a step-change to speed up 
new product development 
and improvements to our 
existing technology . ”

Annual report and accounts 2010      Surgical Innovations Group plc 07
Sales growth of SI branded products was 
driven by our Resposable
®
 products and 
overall revenues were boosted by the delivery 
of a £616,000 order in the Industrial segment 
in May 2010; sales to industrial customers 
accounted for 10% of total revenues for 2010. 
Retained profit for the period was £1 .788 million 
(2009: £525,000) including a taxation. 
Cash flow and investment 
During the year the Group generated net cash 
of £2.202 million from operating activities, 
enabling the Group to continue its strong 
investment in product development with 
capitalised investment in research and 
development (R&D) increasing by 57% 
to £1.674 million (2009: £1.066 million), 
reflecting a step-change in the structure 
of the R&D team as well as a stronger 
focus on new product development. 
Elsewhere capital expenditure remained 
strong with £628,000 invested in plant 
and equipment while the total number 
of employees and agency staff increased 
from 76 at the end of 2009 to 117 at the end 
of 2010. We have continued to make staff 
appointments in all areas of the business, 
while the R&D team has been re-organised 
in such a way as to encourage product 
concept generation. 
The Clinical Advisory Board now consists 
of nine highly experienced surgeons covering 
a wide range of specialisms in MIS, with 
Mr Marco Adamo and Mr Jon Conroy joining 
the Board in January 2011, the latter extending 
the team’s expertise into arthroscopy.
Dividend 
In 2009, SI successfully applied to the courts 
to cancel the Group’s accumulated losses. 
The purpose of this was to enable the Board 
to implement a dividend strategy at such time 
as it considers appropriate. While a strategy 
remains under review, the Board believes that 
at this stage in the Group’s development it 
would be more appropriate to continue its 
focus on strong inward investment. 
Acquisitions 
The Board continues to review acquisition 
opportunities in the area of MIS where 
strong synergies exist with the Group and 
where our R&D expertise and in-house 
manufacturing capabilities can create 
improvements to the products and cost 
savings for the end user.
Outlook
Trading in the period since the year end has 
been encouraging, particularly from the core 
business, where we have seen further orders 
for SI branded products, particularly for 
YelloPort+plus
®
. The R&D team continues 
to improve the SI branded product range to 
generate a wider range of new products and 
enhancements for our global distributor 
network and affirm our position as a leading 
innovator within the field of MIS.
In February 2011 we were pleased to announce 
the four-year exclusive contract for a minimum 
of $2.2 million with US-based Mediflex 
Surgical Products (“Mediflex”) with regard 
to the inclusion of YelloPort+plus
®
 in surgical 
trays in the US. 
We are also being approached by several other 
OEM customers to develop new laparoscopic 
products on an exclusive basis. 
We remain confident about the future growth 
prospects of the business for the remainder 
of 2011 and further into 2012 and 2013 as 
new products are launched towards the end 
of this year and the increasing traction with 
OEM customers gains momentum.
I would like to thank the Board and staff 
for their tireless work in 2010 and their 
contribution to the rapid growth of the 
business. We are better positioned than ever 
to take full advantage of the opportunities 
that are available to us and I look forward 
to reporting on the continuing success 
of the Group over the coming year.

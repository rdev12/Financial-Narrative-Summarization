Non Financial KPIs
Notes 
On pages 1 to 67 of this report the Company’s results for the year ended 31 December 2012 are presented on an ‘Underlying business’ basis, 
unless otherwise stated. ‘Underlying business’ excludes the results of previously announced business disposals, Milling (sales only), and non-core 
discrete contract losses. Milling is excluded due to the cost plus pricing nature of the business that has a direct impact on sales but not trading profit. 
A reconciliation to statutory numbers can be found on page 34.
The purpose of using the ‘Underlying business’ basis for measuring performance is to reflect the performance of the core business of the Company. 
With the Company having undergone a year of restructuring in 2012, this basis better reflects underlying business performance.
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before re-financing costs, restructuring costs, profits and losses associated with divestment activity, 
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, the revaluation of foreign exchange and other derivative contracts under IAS 39 and pension credits 
or charges in relation to the difference between expected return on pension assets, administration costs and interest costs on pension liabilities. 
EBITDA is trading profit excluding depreciation.

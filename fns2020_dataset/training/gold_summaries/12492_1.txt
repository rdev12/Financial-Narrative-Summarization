Market overview 
In the last two years, we have
experienced an unprecedented
decline in the electronics market, 
and we have also seen an overall
economic slowdown in the 
majority of the markets in which we
operate. In the first quarter of each of
the last two years, some forecasters
have anticipated a recovery in the
second half of the year, particularly in
North America, although there was
no certainty about the pace and
precise timing. We said then that we
were not going to count on help from
the market, but that we would work
on the assumption that there would
be no improvement and be ready to
react as we saw the market move 
up or down. As soon as we saw 
the early signs of a downturn in
2001, we acted quickly and removed
a significant amount of cost from 
the business. During the last twelve
months, we have not repeated this
scale of cost reduction, but have
maintained a very tight control overall
and taken opportunities to cut out
waste and duplication. We believed
that we should turn our focus to
delivering better and additional
services to our customers. 
Apart from Asia, where there was
some uplift, particularly in the middle
and second half of 2002, our markets
have now been, at best, flat for
around eighteen months, proving
that we were right to maintain our
cautious view.
Maintaining our strategic focus
We have maintained determined
progress on our key initiatives: putting
in the software and the systems that
we need to service our customers
better; building services and
improving the quality of our people.
Despite the poor market conditions
we have maintained our investment
in these areas. 
We have continued to focus on
improving the way we do business.
Our ongoing investment in
information technology is based 
on competitive advantage in our 
kind of business increasingly moving
from the traditional, and still
important, control of the physical 
flow of goods to the management
and understanding of the information
associated with that flow.
We constantly strive to improve 
our customer service levels. 
We have added eProcurement
capabilities and developed new
services. ProductFind gives our
customers access to six million
products beyond those which we
have in stock and ProductWatch™
alerts our design engineer customers
when components are due to go
obsolete so that they do not use them
in new products. We have focused
on breaking down our customer
base into appropriate segments to
enable us to satisfy their particular
needs more effectively.

We have continued to strengthen 
our management team. Laurence
Bain was appointed Group Chief
Operating Officer in July 2002 and 
a new Global Accounts Director,
senior personnel in marketing and
strategic development in North
America and a new Group Director
of Strategic Marketing and Planning
were also appointed during the year.
T wo of these are internal
appointments, which is of particular
significance following a period where
most of our senior appointments
were made from outside. We are
now beginning to bring through
talent from within the organisation.
Investing for growth
Our business strategy is designed 
to deliver profitable growth. 
Sales growth can come from new
customers, new markets and higher
spend from existing customers. 
This explains the focus of our
activities in the following areas:
– Expansion of our product range
– International development
– Deeper understanding of our
customers and markets through
segmentation
– Greater penetration of existing
multi-national and large accounts
– Ongoing improvement of
customer service.
Expansion of our product range
continues to be one of our areas 
of development. Over the last year
we have added 46,000 products 
to the Marketing and Distribution
Division and there will be more this
year, particularly in North America. 
In March 2003, we doubled our
American range of passive
components by adding 11,000 
new products. That is a significant
step forward in improving our
product coverage and enables 
us to win more of our existing
customers’ spending and to 
attract new customers. 
We have continued to build our
international presence to satisfy 
our customers’ needs and we 
have opened offices in Italy, Belgium,
Austria and Mexico over the last
twelve months. 
We have clear examples of
significant progress in the market
segments that we have particularly
chosen to focus on. Our health 
and safety business in the UK 
grew around 29 per cent overall 
last year and in the final quarter 
was higher still, the result of merging
the capabilities of our three UK
businesses in this area. The differing
needs of design and maintenance
engineers are better understood 
and our attention to these two
groups of customers reflects their
importance to us.
Our focus on large customers
produced encouraging results. Sales
to the US Government through an
agreement with the General Services
Administration (GSA) awarded in May
2002, are up 12 per cent despite
Federal budget approval delay. Sales
to designated major corporate
accounts are up 3 per cent in North
America and we have secured
agreements with 37 new large
customers across the Marketing and
Distribution Division. Each one of
these deals requires different
combinations of products and
services and has been secured as a
direct result of our flexibility in
deploying the very wide range of
services we can provide.
eCommerce continues to offer a
major growth opportunity. At Newark
InOne, sales through all our
electronic channels, including the
Internet and eProcurement, are up
8 per cent, at Farnell InOne by
82 per cent. Sales through the
eProcurement channel alone are up
52 per cent in North America. Some
customers transact between 30 per
cent and 50 per cent of their
business with us in their first year of
utilising eProcurement.
control
Competitive advantage in our
kind of business is increasingly
moving from the traditional, 
and still important, control of the
physical flow of goods, to the
management and understanding
of the information associated
with that flow. Premier Farnell plc Chief Executive’s statement
Annual Report and Accounts 2003 continued

There were 43 new eProcurement
partnerships established in North
America during the year, which takes
our total to 118, and a further 42 are
under negotiation. The demand from
new companies wishing to take
advantage of the available
economies and efficiencies that
eProcurement offers appears not to
diminish. Sixty-seven new
eProcurement partnerships in Europe
this year takes our total to 108 and a
further 36 are under negotiation or
development. 
It is important to remember the 
basic elements of our business.
Customers come to us first and
foremost because we have a very
wide product range which they know 
will be in stock and delivered reliably
and swiftly. Beyond that, we offer
significant benefits from our flexibility
in recognising and responding 
to customers’ particular needs, 
our vendor managed inventory
solutions and our eProcurement
capability, where we have established
a reputation for being the best in our
class. In a market where customers
are continually striving to reduce the
number of suppliers, manage costs
and increase productivity we are well
placed to take a share of that
business through our ability to deliver
efficiencies to their procurement
processes. 
We have a focused approach and
dedicated team of people who are
well educated and well equipped to
manage this kind of business. The
number of stock rooms now under
our management or influence in
North America is 246 compared to
98 at this time last year. In Europe,
the number is 157 and our sales
through the stockrooms we manage
rose by 27 per cent over last year.
Managing customers’ stockrooms
creates a close relationship with
these customers, one it is difficult for
our competitors to match.
Where appropriate opportunities
arise, we are also growing by
acquisition as one potential route 
to expanding our product or
geographic coverage. BuckHickman
InOne, acquired in July 2001, 
has been a significant success 
for us. In a market that has declined,
BuckHickman InOne sales in the
fourth quarter were up 16 per cent.
This excellent performance comes
not only from the closer collaboration
of our businesses in the UK, 
but also from our extensive range 
of services. Significant amongst
these are our vendor managed
inventory expertise and our ability 
to help our customers gain
productivity benefits from managing
their inventories. T wo major business
wins which reflect this capability are
the contracts we have been awarded
by Vauxhall, announced in November
2002, and Rolls-Royce in March
2003. This is business that we would
not have been in a position to tender
for eighteen months ago.
The main businesses in the Industrial
Products Division, Akron Brass, 
TPC Wire & Cable and Kent have
continued to make sound progress
in difficult market conditions by
adding products and services that
have driven sales. Greater
productivity and improved margins
have been realised at Akron Brass
following the investment in new plant.
Sales productivity has improved at
Kent after restructuring.

Communicating our capabilities
and working together to deliver
In February, we announced our
intention to rebrand a number of 
the businesses in the Marketing 
and Distribution Division. Over the
last few years, we have made major
investments which have substantially
improved the quality of our
information management. We have
increased our understanding of our
customers and market segments
and we have added a wide range 
of services. Our businesses are now
working together more effectively 
to give customers the service they
expect. It is appropriate, therefore, 
to signal to the market the range and
depth of the services our businesses
provide and how they work together
in providing these services globally.
Rebranding with a new visual identity
and the addition of the suffix InOne
gives us the opportunity to
communicate our progress at the
same time as retaining the historical
value which resides in our existing
business names. We have rebranded
those businesses which operate 
with the same kind of customers:
BuckHickman InOne, Farnell InOne
and Newark InOne. Rebranding 
is a signal of our past achievements,
our current capabilities and our 
future aspirations.
Continuing to strengthen 
our business
We prefer to work on what we see
as the realities of the market place,
rather than what various forecasters
might say. When our markets
improve we are ready to take full
advantage of their recovery. In the
meantime, we are working on the
basis that markets will continue as
they are and we will continue to push
hard to gain market share. We have
gained significant strength this year.
Tight control of costs has made our
margins more robust in withstanding
the market cycle. 
We have increased our market share
progressively over the last couple of
years by concentrating on the things
that enhance our customer’ s
experience. We have continued to
improve the performance of our
business and we have demonstrated
the benefits of acquiring
BuckHickman InOne. We believe 
we are in a very strong position for
continued market share growth and
to take advantage of the market
upturn when it comes.

CAMEROON
Cameroon is a politically stable 
and relatively developed country,
located in the middle of the West
African hydrocarbon province.
Cameroon is sub-Saharan Africa’s 6th 
largest oil producer. The democratically
elected government of President Paul Biya
was re-elected for a further seven year term
on 11 October 2004.
In 2003 Cameroon’s GDP was US $12 billion,
with current growth of 4.2% per annum.
Hydrocarbon development is central to 
the country’s sustained prosperity plans. 
This includes the development of power
projects with compound annual growth in
electricity demand of 5% expected over the
next 20 years.
Over the years BowLeven has established 
a strong relationship with the Cameroon
Government.

GEOLOGY AND RESERVES
In the late 1960s through to the early
1980s, eight wells were drilled in the
northern Block MLHP-7 by Total Oil
(‘‘Total’’), Société Nationale Elf Aquitaine
(‘‘Elf’’) and Mobil Corporation (‘‘Mobil’’).
these wells discovered reserves of gas
and associated condensate in the Isongo
Sands which the Directors consider to be
commercially exploitable.
Estimated P50 risked recoverable
Reserves and Contingent Resources of
discoveries and prospects in the Isongo
and Biafra Sands in the northern Block
MLHP-7 of the Etinde Permit are 447 bcf
of gas and 44 mmbbls of condensate,
equivalent to 118.5 mmboe; of which 60.3
mmboe are classed as P50 reserves.
ETINDE PERMIT
BowLeven controls a 100% working
interest in three shallow blocks offshore
Cameroon, which comprise the Etinde
Permit. The Blocks are located across
the Rio del Rey basin (part of the
southern margin of the Niger Delta
oilfield basin) and the Douala Basin
(which contains large undrilled
seismically identified structures),
together referred to as the ‘‘Area of
Association’’. The Area of Association
covers approximately 2,314 sq km. 
The water depths are shallow, from the
shoreline up to approximately 70 metres
maximum depth.
Numerous exploration prospects, leads
and plays have been identified 
in the Etinde Permit acreage.
Cameroon is in the hydrocarbon fairway
of West Africa and is adjacent to Nigeria,
Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.

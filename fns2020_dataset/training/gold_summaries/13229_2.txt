We continue to grow 
in response to the 
fundamental c c c ch h h ha a a an nges 
affecting how w w w p p p pe e eo ople

The principle drivers of this growth in 
ﬂ exible workplace outsourcing, and 
ﬂ exible working in general, are technology, 
which enab bles us to work anywhere, and 
the signiﬁ cant cost savings associated 
with contrac a ting to a specialist sup pport 
service prov ovider like Regus. As outlined 
in more de detail opposite, other drivers 
include demographics, sustainability 
and the growing societal importance 
of of w wor o k- k-life b bal alan ance ce. 
As a result, ﬂ ﬂe exible wo working has co ome m

way organisations op oper erat ate and co ond ndu uct

When a business looks to outsource its 
workplace requirements, location is
typically the primary consideration. It is 
for this reason that we continue to invest 
heavily in expanding and strengthening 
national networks across all the markets 
in which we operate, taking the products 
and services we provide to where our 
customers need us to be. Expansion, in 
our core business centre network and into 
third place locations such as airports, retail 
outlets and community centres, is a key 
objective for the Group. Financial growth 
also allows us to realise signiﬁ cant scale 
beneﬁ ts through cost reductions and 
gains in efﬁ ciency. 
Our aim is to provide our customers 
with the best possible help and support 
in deciding how and where they structure 
themselves to work. Expanding and 
strengthening our national networks allows
us to better serve o our u c cus usto t mers and 
attract new customers, a a and n n in so doing 
to create a strong and vibrant business

Cost:
Using traditional ﬁ xed 
property can be expensive 
– all the more so since 
more ﬂ exible working 
leaves desks empty for 
much of the week. Flexible 
workplace outsourcing can 
be more cost effective than 
ﬁ xed alternatives.
Technology:
Technological advances, 
from new devices to 
technologies and services, 
allow us to work and 
connect to colleagues, 
customers and suppliers 
from anywhere. 
Technological change will 
only continue to make us 
more mobile, connected 
and accessible.
Demographics: 
There are now four 
generations in the 
workforce from the over 
65’s and Baby Boomers to 
Gen-X and lastly Net-Gens 
born into an always-on, 
always-connected world. 
Each has very different 
work styles and 
expectations which ﬂ exible 
working helps them meet.
Sustainability: 
Sustainability is a core 
strategic priority for 
businesses, governments 
and individuals, and 
includes concerns around 
environmental impact, for 
example through carbon 
emissions. Flexible working 
helps address this is an 
efﬁ cient and simply way 
by allowing our customers 
to cut the carbon 
emissions associated 
with commuting.
Work-life balance: 
A harmonious work-life 
balance often tops 
professionals’ deﬁ nition of 
career success, ahead of 
both money and 
recognition. Flexible 
working is a major 
contributor to a better 
work-life balance, and is 
increasingly used by 
employers to attract and 
retain staff.

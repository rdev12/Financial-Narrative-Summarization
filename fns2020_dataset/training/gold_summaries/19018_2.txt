Mears Group PLC
Annual report and accounts 2015 01
Our year in brief
Operational highlights
 > Our focus is on two growth markets and will remain that way. There 
are significant opportunities for the Group in both these sectors.
 > Service quality remains our key differentiator in both our core markets.
 > We have made excellent progress in extending our housing 
activities from our traditional blue collar social housing 
maintenance to a broader housing management offering.
 > The Housing Management business has performed particularly 
strongly in 2015.
 > The acquisition of the Care at Home division of Care UK (CAH) 
increased the scale of Mears within the domiciliary care market, 
making Mears the second largest provider in the UK. 
 > Mears has increased its carer pay rates significantly over the last 
two years, reducing margins but giving us greater protection against 
the introduction of the National Living Wage. 
 > Visibility of 96% of consensus forecast revenue for 2016 and in 
excess of 82% visibility for 2017 which leaves us well positioned 
for the coming year and beyond.
Financial highlights
 > Housing – revenues of £735.1m (2014: £714.7m), an increase 
of 3% with excellent visibility of growth for the coming year.
 > Housing – operating margin increased to 5.8% (2014: 4.9%) driven 
by improving contract margins on the previously acquired Morrison 
business together with a changing sales mix. 
 > Care – revenues of £146.0m (2014: £124.0m), including circa £38m 
in respect of CAH. The underlying organic revenues reflect 
a 9% decline.
 > Care – operating margin reduced to a negative 1.1% (2014: positive 
7.8%) as a result of the loss-making acquired CAH business. 
 > Normalised diluted earnings per share decreased by 13% to 27 .94p 
(2014: 32.20p), as a result of the loss-making acquired CAH business. 
 > New contract awards of £1 billion (2014: £300m) representing 
our most successful period of new contract bidding.
 > The order book at £3.5 billion (2014: £3.2 billion) has improved 
in terms of quality, longevity and quantum.
 > Strong balance sheet with cash generated from continuing 
operations as a proportion of EBITDA at 99% (2014: 96%). 
Net cash reported at the year end.
 > Progressive dividend policy; dividend increased to 11.00p 
(2014: 10.00p), a 10% increase, reflecting the Board’s confidence 
in future prospects.

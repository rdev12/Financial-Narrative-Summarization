 3 Bett Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Chief Executive’s Overview
Ronnie Hanna Chief Executive
8 November 2002
Over the last ten years we have moved to focus the business 
on housing and commercial property and to balance this with
the potential and opportunity for growth. 
Diversiﬁed activities have gradually been sold off in line with 
the challenge of obtaining the right price and the objective of
replacing the income with growth from core activities. Bett Inns,
the last remaining diversiﬁcation, was a valuable contribution 
to the Group over many years but we considered that a sale at
the end of last year was entirely appropriate. We have now
achieved our focus as can be seen from the diagram below.
The competitive demands in property, both housing and
commercial development, are naturally increasing. The industry
itself is changing and needs to adjust to a tougher statutory 
and planning environment but also, as in many other markets, 
an increasingly discerning customer.
We are now able to concentrate fully on these issues and are
committed to competing successfully.
Our strategy remains to deliver the potential from our existing
activities and to seek further growth opportunities, including 
a wider geographic coverage. Timing is critical both from a
management and a market perspective.
We now have a truly focused base from which to achieve this.

Highlights
An increase in contribution from the
Programmes business group is anticipated as 
it benefits from the revised T yphoon contract. In
addition, continued good growth is expected 
from the company's North American operations
including the benefit of full year contributions from
acquisitions completed during the course of 2004. 
The CS&S and Land Systems business is
expected to achieve further growth in the UK
support activities together with a full year
contribution from Alvis. These performance
improvements will be more than offset by the
previously announced step down in profitability 
in export support activities.
The completion of the Eurosystems transaction
will remove the profit contribution from disposed
activities. The transaction is expected to be
marginally dilutive to earnings in 2005. 
Overall, the performance of the company's
defence businesses is expected to continue to
improve in 2005 albeit at a lower rate of growth
than that achieved in 2004.
Commercial Aerospace is expected to
contribute to some growth with the benefit of a
planned increase in Airbus aircraft deliveries.
Some reversal of the strong 2004 operating
cash inflow is anticipated in 2005 as customer
prepayments are utilised to fund rising
production activity.
BAE Systems is now delivering well against its
strategy and objectives. Whilst there remains
much to do, the achievements to date, together
with the actions continuously being taken to
improve performance, enable the group to look
forward with confidence to delivering growing
returns to its shareholders.

 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 06
Chief Executive’s Review
Overview
Our second full year of trading  
has delivered tangible success as  
we have transitioned to a broader based 
developer, publisher and licensor of  
next generation mobile gaming content. 
It was the first full year of operation 
for our Grizzly platform, which we have 
been able to scale rapidly with both 
content and audience. Additionally, 
the platform has lowered cost per 
acquisition (“CPA”) and shortened 
our investment payback periods.
The acquisition of the GameHouse 
social mobile gaming business and 
Slingo IP and games, has enabled 
this transition to occur in not just 
the UK regulated gaming market, 
but also into a new global mobile 
market across multiple channels. 
This has been clearly evidenced by a 
growing number of strategic lottery, 
media and platform partnerships.
Our platform investment has also paid 
off, allowing a single focus on core 
content development usable across 
real money and social audiences as 
well as through the above mentioned 
distribution partnerships.
Platform and content development
During the year Grizzly was significantly 
enhanced following our beta launch 
of SpinGenie in Q4 2014, which scaled 
over £24m in deposits and £403m in 
wagers in 2015. We added new third-
party branded games and migrated 
PocketFruity casino onto Grizzly in  
Q1 2015. This allowed efficiency within 
the development team and also 
increased scalability for the brand. 
We also built our first real money 
Slingo games, Slingo Riches and Slingo 
Extreme – they quickly became the top 
performing games in 2015, accounting 
for 21% of the GGR in Q4 and were 
the most popular games played by 
over 47% of the funded players. 
We are most excited  
by the unified roadmap  
of new developments  
for both social and  
real money products  
and platform, which is 
only made possible by 
owning the value chain 
from end to end. 07 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
With the Group’s continued focus on 
mobile in terms of both platform and 
the content, 80% of our players gamble 
on mobile devices, accounting for 73% 
of our Gross Gaming Revenue in the UK.
In our social business, we grew our 
active development to five games in  
the portfolio by the end of 2015. Both 
Slingo Adventure and Slingo Shuffle 
mobile apps were launched in 2015 and 
together with the existing apps, scaled 
to approximately 964,000 monthly 
average users (“MAU”). We also 
completed the beta version of Slingo 
Blast for iOS and Android, and our new 
social version of our platform from which 
we beta launched our new social casino, 
Lucky Streak Slots in December.
Social games and Slingo IP acquisition
The acquisition of the Social Gaming  
and Slingo assets has enhanced each 
area of our content development,  
mobile audience scaling and platform 
leverage capability. Acquiring two games 
studios, rebranded as Blastworks, with 
their associated mobile marketing  
and publishing teams in Seattle and 
Vancouver Island, together with 
experienced leadership, operating  
under the name Blastworks, has opened 
up several new revenue streams and 
content opportunities for the Group.
It has brought revenues through its free 
to play apps in the US (65%), the UK (5%) 
and rest of the world (30%). The revenue 
is derived from the in-game sale of 
virtual goods and advertising services. 
We engage with our users on our free 
to play platform which is delivered 
through mobile platforms such as iOS, 
Android and Amazon as well as social 
networking sites such as Facebook.
In just over four months since acquisition 
the assets delivered £2.5m in revenue 
to 31 December 2015 and we acquired 
36,835 in new depositing players.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy during the year 
was to continue to target growth on 
the Grizzly platform. We added new 
features to the platform to allow for 
multiple offers by different channels 
which yielded improved returns and 
lower CPAs. The result has been an 
overall CPA on the Grizzly platform 
of £79 with 78,198 new depositing 
players in the year. We believe this is 
the lowest CPA across the industry for a 
UK casino. Our revenue per depositing 
player was £125 which is reflective 
of the new player base in 2015.
Marketing for our social gaming apps 
followed a similar strategy in order to get 
scale on the platforms. With new app 
releases in the year and constant release 
cycles, we were able to continuously 
improve acquisition and retention 
campaigns during the year. The cost 
of a new depositing player was £21.
Our cross device marketing capability 
continues to be a significant asset of the 
Group. In addition to marketing our own 
UK regulated gaming properties, our 
team integrated and complimented our 
social marketing activities immediately 
following the acquisition. With the 
sale of our third-party platform driven 
websites in 2016, our team will further 
focus on our B2C in both the real 
money and social markets leveraging 
a single BI and data platform.
Our player acquisition and CRM programs 
continue to leverage cutting edge 
technology, data science algorithms and 
proven talent in both the UK and the US.
Licensing and content innovation
In line with the Group strategy of 
developing, publishing and licensing 
next generation mobile content, 
we made great progress in 2015. As 
we have moved into 2016, we have 
seen the benefit of this with licensing 
deals with Zynga and Scientific 
Games. We are also delighted to have 
obtained a transactional waiver for 
New Jersey to provide a new bingo 
game into that market through a 
partnership with Pala Interactive. 
We have also looked to partner with 
market-leading content providers, 
integrating games from Ainsworth 
Technology, Instant Win Gaming, 
NetEnt and IGT. On top of this we 
have more recently signed licenses 
with Fremantle Media and Endemol 
to build unique branded Slingo games 
to widen our marketing appeal. 
Outlook
Our strategy for 2016 is to consolidate 
and focus on our core products. By 
disposing of our third-party platform 
driven websites, we are in a stronger 
position to streamline operations on our 
proprietary platforms. We continue to 
develop unique content which will bring 
exciting licensing opportunities in 2016 
and deliver growth and new potential 
for the Group. This content will also 
be delivered on our core platforms to 
enable greater product differentiation 
and player engagement. With the 
proven success of our marketing 
strategy, the new platform and the 
acquisition of Slingo, we are in a strong 
position for significant progress.

PLAYER DEMOGRAPHICS  
FOR REAL MONEY
With our focus on mobile delivery and original 
game IP, we are able to acquire a younger audience 
than the traditional online bingo industry. 25 to 34 
year olds account for nearly double the new users 
of any other age group and is reflective of the 
Group’s digital mobile acquisition methods. Whilst 
the products male/female split is roughly 50/50 in 
terms of acquisition, women as a group are near 
50% more profitable than their male counterparts 
which we believe is due to the paucity of female 
focused games as opposed to male dominated 
sportsbooks and represents a key opportunity for 
the Group moving forward.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
Case study
Data driven and content rich for 
real money and social games  
with our new Grizzly platform
During 2015, Gaming Realms realigned its strategy to focus 
on its sites operating on the Grizzly proprietary platform, as 
well as creating and publishing innovative mobile content 
for real money and social gaming. 
The Group’s differentiated mobile offering on Grizzly which 
includes Slingo games, has led to significant revenue 
growth, as reflected in the Group’s updated trading 
statement announced on 27 January 2016. The Group has 
decided to continue to build on this success and focus 
investment in new games given the significantly superior 
marketing returns generated on the Grizzly platform.  
As a result, the Group has agreed to divest of the  
third-party platform driven website properties.
 
The Group intends to use the proceeds from the  
disposals for the development of new gaming content  
and marketing campaigns.

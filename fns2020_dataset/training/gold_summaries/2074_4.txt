Petroleum
EBIT increased
3 1 .6%
➔
Earnings Before Interest and T ax (EBIT), excluding
exceptional items, were US$1830 million, compared with
US$1 391 million in 2004, an increase of US$439 million.
The new projects commissioned were North West Shelf
LNG Train 4 (Australia), ROD oil project (Algeria), Mad
Dog oil project (US), Angostura oil project (Trinidad and
T obago), Minerva gas project (Australia) and Gulf of
Mexico Caesar and Cleopatra pipeline infrastructure (US).
The commissioning of six major projects during the year
was the culmination of many years’ work and will provide
a base for increasing oil and gas production in the future.
We started seeing a ramp-up in production from these
projects in the second half of the financial year which,
combined with high oil prices, helped us achieve a strong
result.

Aluminium
EBIT increased
25.9%
➔
Earnings Before Interest and T ax (EBIT) were US$977
million, compared with US$776 million in 2004, an
increase of US$201 million. The increase was mainly
attributable to higher realised prices for aluminium and
alumina together with higher aluminium sales volumes
reflecting the first full year of production from the
expansion at Hillside (South Africa). 
The success of our portfolio of mining, refining and
smelting operations is based largely on our access to
economic bauxite and competitive power . The quality 
of the portfolio reflects our ability to construct, 
commission and operate our assets efficiently.
We intend to increase our portfolio through brownfield
expansions and the identification of high quality
greenfield opportunities through an increased and
targeted business development programme.
Base Metals
EBIT increased
88.3%
➔
Earnings Before Interest and T ax (EBIT), excluding
exceptional items, were US$21 77 million, compared with
US$1 156 million in 2004, an increase of US$1 021 million.
High copper, molybdenum, silver, lead and zinc prices
combined with production records at Escondida,
Antamina and Cannington drove this record result. 
These factors were partially offset by increased input 
and price-linked costs and a stronger Australian dollar 
to US dollar exchange rate.
The addition of the Olympic Dam copper/uranium
operation to the Base Metals portfolio, plus the start-up
of the Escondida Sulphide Leach project will see
production capacity expand rapidly in 2006.

Diamonds and Specialty Products
EBIT increased
1. 7%
➔
Earnings Before Interest and T ax (EBIT), excluding
exceptional items, were US$41 7 million, compared with
US$41 0 million in 2004, an increase of US$7 million.
The increase was driven by higher realised prices for
diamonds and titanium feedstock, offset by lower
diamond sales volumes and higher costs due to the
processing of lower grade material and a stronger
Canadian dollar .
The EKATI Diamond Mine enjoyed another year of strong
operating performance and profitability, while Richards
Bay Minerals is benefiting from a strong market for its
titanium, zircon and pig iron products.
The acquisition of WMC Resources Ltd added one of the
world’s largest known titanium dioxide deposits, Corridor
Sands, to our portfolio. It also brought a fertilisers
business as well as valuable new technical capabilities.

➔
Earnings Before Interest and T ax (EBIT), excluding
exceptional items, were US$2821 million, compared with
US$1 1 37 million in 2004, an increase of US$1684 million.
The increase was mainly attributable to stronger
commodity prices for all products and increased volumes
from Western Australian iron ore, Queensland coal and
our manganese ore operations.
The result reflects a new growth phase in the global steel
industry, which has led to strong demand and prices for
seaborne iron ore, metallurgical coal and manganese. 
The business continues to expand production of each of
these commodities to meet growing demand.

Energy Coal
EBIT increased
1 63.2%
➔
Earnings Before Interest and T ax (EBIT), excluding
exceptional items, were US$616 million, compared with
US$234 million in 2004, an increase of US$382 million. 
This increase was mainly attributable to higher export
prices, resulting from continued strong demand in the
Atlantic and Pacific markets. The strength of the rand,
Australian dollar and Colombian peso against the 
US dollar as well as inflation in South Africa had an
unfavourable impact on operating costs.
While over half our South African coal production is 
sold domestically, we are increasing our emphasis on 
the export market and seeking opportunities to supply
new countries.
Expansions of Cerrejon Coal Company in Colombia 
and the progression of an underground project at 
Mount Arthur Coal in Australia to pre-feasibility will 
help meet increasing global demand for energy sources.
Stainless Steel Materials
EBIT increased
32. 7%
➔
Earnings Before Interest and T ax (EBIT), excluding
exceptional items, were US$758 million, compared with
US$571 million in 2004, an increase of US$187 million. 
The increase was mainly due to higher nickel and
ferrochrome prices compared to the prior year . The
ferrochrome operations were sold, effective 1 June 2005.
Record production at Cerro Matoso in Colombia and
another strong result from the Yabulu refinery in Australia
reflect both operating excellence initiatives and higher
recoveries.
The combination of WMC Resources Ltd’s nickel
operations with our existing assets has created a world-
class nickel business and a major global supplier of
materials to the stainless steel industry.

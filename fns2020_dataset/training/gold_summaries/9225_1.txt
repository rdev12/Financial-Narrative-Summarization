Is 2009 the most challenging year Ladbrokes has seen? 
Well I can’t vouch for performance prior to the 1990s but it’s 
certainly been one of the toughest years since I joined the 
Company in 1991. It’s up there with 1994/1995 when the 
National Lottery was introduced. 
Why has it been so difficult? 
In late 2008 we, and the industry, held the view that we would 
trade through the economic storm as the industry had in 
previous recessions … with relative resilience. As 2009 
progressed it became apparent that our business is more 
exposed to consumer cyclicality and therefore things have 
become much more challenging as the recession has taken  
hold and unemployment has risen.
Why do you think it’s shown greater cyclicality? 
The customer demographic has moved over the years to more 
naturally mirror the UK demographic norm. This graphic shows 
the shape of our current UK Retail customer base.
Following almost 20 years with 
Ladbrokes and nine at the helm, 
Christopher Bell will be stepping 
down as CEO in the summer.  
He gives his perspective on 2009.

What about the sporting results for the year? 
The sporting results certainly have not helped us in 2009. Using 
UK Retail as an example, the horseracing margin over the year 
has been slightly lower than we would naturally expect, down  
0.1 percentage points versus the five year average. However,  
the bigger impact was in football where, in the third quarter,  
an unusually low proportion of draws in the English Premier 
League resulted in a football win margin of only 0.2% for the 
quarter against a five year average of 21.4%. This meant that  
the total gross win margin for UK Retail was a full 0.7 percentage 
points lower than the five year average.
What has the business been doing to improve the 
performance of the Group? 
You will have seen on page 6 what our short-term priorities are –  
many of these initiatives were put in place during 2009 and  
we will continue to build upon them in 2010. With pressure on 
the top line and a high fixed cost base we quickly recognised  
the need to reduce costs. The machine and OddsOn! initiatives 
are to promote growth in the top line in an efficient manner,  
while the decisions to move our Sportsbook offshore, exit Italy 
and sell the Casino were to improve the overall efficiency of  
the Group.
What’s happening with regulation? 
Page 16 gives you an overview of the key regulatory 
development/agenda items in various countries.
In the UK, there are a number of ongoing consultations with both 
the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (‘DCMS’) and HM 
Treasury (‘HMT’). The timing of proposals resulting from these 
consultations is likely to be affected by the timing of the UK 
General Election. 
DCMS completed a pre-consultation on the scope of its review 
of Category B gaming machine stakes and prizes in September 
2009. Details of the planned review have yet to be published. 
In October 2009 HMT completed a consultation into the 
introduction of a gross profits tax on gaming machines to replace 
the existing gaming machine taxes (AMLD and VAT). Conclusions 
from the consultation have yet to be announced. 
In January 2010 DCMS announced a consultation to explore 
new licence requirements for overseas-based betting and 
gaming operators. Full details of the consultation are expected  
to be announced in March 2010. 
In January 2010 the panel, commissioned by the sports minister 
Gerry Sutcliffe, to examine the issue of sports betting integrity, 
published its report, with a number of recommendations, 
including the creation of a Sports Betting Intelligence Unit within 
the Gambling Commission. Ladbrokes welcomes the report  
as a proportionate response to an issue that is often  
significantly overstated. 
During 2009 it was agreed the Horseracing Levy would remain 
at 10% of gross win on British horseracing until April 2011. 
Negotiations for the following year’ s scheme will begin in March 2010. 
The 3rd British Gambling Prevalence Survey is to be published 
before the end of 2010 and fieldwork has already begun. When 
last published in 2007 the survey revealed that the level of problem 
gambling in the UK had remained at the same level as in 2000.
In Europe there are a number of regulatory developments in key 
markets and Ladbrokes is actively assessing these opportunities 
and its options for market-entry.
What is your view of the future? 
Until unemployment begins to fall I expect it will remain a 
challenging environment to operate in. However, given we have 
seen cyclicality in our performance during 2009, as the economy 
improves, we expect our performance to do likewise.  
I don’t have a crystal ball to predict when that will be but 
internally we feel the Group has good momentum moving into 
2010. The initiatives we put in place in 2009 will continue to 
develop which coupled with our strengthened balance sheet will 
leave us in a strong position to deliver in the coming months  
and to continue to grow in the coming years.

The UK betting industry
In January 2010 a new report by Deloitte revealed the 
important economic impact made by the betting industry 
on the British economy. Analysis in the report shows that 
the total contribution to the British economy from the British 
betting industry is £6 billion GVA (a measure of economic 
output analogous to GDP) and 100,000 jobs. This is 
equivalent to 0.5% of GDP and 0.3% of total employment.
  The ‘direct’ contribution (businesses providing betting 
products and services) is £3 billion GVA and 40,700 full  
time jobs
  The ‘indirect’ economic impact (of supporting businesses 
in the supply chain) is £3.1 billion in GVA terms and 
supports around 62,300 jobs
The retail betting industry alone is estimated to contribute 
£2.2 billion of GVA – which consists of:
 £700 million in wages paid to staff; 
 £800 million in profits (before interest and tax) and 
  £700 million is generated in taxes (excluding VAT which for 
retail betting amounts to £207 million).

lower capital and operating costs. Regus’ 
business model is firmly focused on 
participating in this structural shift 
towards flexible work. 
As this trend develops, the growth in 
demand for high quality, flexible and 
conveniently located workplaces, will also 
continue. Our investment programme 
reflects this continuing growth in demand, 
with customers seeking workplaces in 
locations including our core office based 
locations; railway stations; motorway 
service stations; airports and retail outlets 
among many others.
Chief Executive Officer’s review
Our business has performed 
well. We exceeded 
expectations on growth, 
controlled costs and generated 
attractive, sustainable returns-
on-investment for our 
shareholders. 
Group revenues increased by 15.8%  
at constant currency to £1,676.1m  
(2013: £1,533.5) (9.3% at actual rates). 
Operating profit increased to £104.3m,  
up 27% at constant currency (15% at  
actual rates). 
We have improved the gross margin on the 
locations which were added during 2012 
and 2013. These locations now represent a 
more significant part of our overall revenue 
generated, which increases their relative 
weighting on the overall Group result. We 
continue to achieve a strong level of gross 
margin on all our locations that were open 
on or before 31 December 2011. The initial 
margin achieved by our new 2014 
locations is good and on track but these 
are very young and a long way from 
financial maturity.
I am also particularly pleased with the 
further substantial progress achieved in 
improving the operational effectiveness  
of the business. Total Group overheads, 
including increased investment in R&D, 
were up only 4% at constant currency, 
whilst the size of our network increased 
24%. As a result, total overheads as a 
percentage of revenue reduced from 18.5% 
to 16.7%. As we continue to grow, I expect 
further improvements in this regard.
Consequently, the annual post-tax cash 
return on investment achieved this year 
from centres opened on or before 31 
December 2011 was 20.9%, which is a 
good return.
Market
The way in which people work is changing 
rapidly, driven by a wide variety of factors 
including technological change, 
globalisation and changing workforce 
dynamics, with growing recognition from 
large organisations that effectively 
harnessing these changes can underpin 
substantial productivity gains, alongside

Performance against our strategic 
objectives
Delivering attractive, sustainable returns
Our investments consistently deliver 
strong returns well above our cost of 
capital. We are confident that those made 
in 2014 will, in due course, achieve similar 
strong returns.
The increased diversity of our network  
and number of partners is a positive 
development of the last few years. We now 
have locations from the very busiest city 
centres to large villages, ranging in size 
from 150sqm to 15,000sqm. The wide 
variety of format and service diversity 
means there is no longer a typical, average 
centre for the Group. 
Following feedback from a number of 
stakeholders regarding the presentation  
of the Group’s performance, the Board  
has decided that additional insight can  
be provided through the disclosure of 
post-tax cash return on net investment 
data by year. Accordingly, I am pleased to 
report that locations opened on or before 
31 December 2011 achieved an annual 
post-tax cash return on investment of 
20.9% (2013: 17.8% on locations opened 
on or before 31 December 2010), well 
above our cost of capital. 
Develop national networks
This has been another strong period of 
growth for the Group. We opened in 166 new 
towns and cities, increasing our coverage 
from 684 to 850 cities. We added 452 new 
locations, increasing the size of our network 
by 24% to 2,269. To achieve this, we 
invested net growth capital of £206.6m 
(2013: £260.2m). The reason for the lower 
level of investment in 2014 is mainly due to 
the geographic mix and diversity in deal 
types. As of 28 February 2015, we have 
visibility on growth that will call for a net 
capital investment of approximately £120m 
on some 400 new locations. We will provide 
updates on this as we progress through 
2015. As in previous years these new 
investments will be a mix of organic 
openings and acquisitions. We believe all 
will meet our stringent returns criteria and 
deliver long-term sustainable returns, well 
ahead of our cost of capital.
Industry leading innovation
We have continued to invest in R&D as we 
look to create new formats, improve 
existing ones and develop new products 
and services. Over the period we therefore 
increased spend on R&D by 21% to £8.7m 
(2013: £7.2m).
There is continued strong interest and 
demand globally, from a wide variety of 
infrastructure owners and operators, for us 
to engage with and help them better serve 
their customers. During the year we 
partnered with the Singapore Government to 
open facilities within their public libraries as 
well as expanding the Regus global airport 
network. We launched a new initiative aimed 
at universities, the first deal of which was 
signed with Helsinki University. We also 
partnered with Philips, taking responsibility 
for the management of their innovation 
centre Evoluon in Eindhoven.  
Controlling costs
Against an increase in the network of 24%, 
total overheads increased by only 4% at 
constant currency (down 1% at actual 
rates), reflecting our continued focus on 
cost control. 
Management, both in the field and at Group 
level, remain focused on further improving 
efficiency and productivity, as well as 
delivering scale benefits as we grow. All 
functions underwent some restructuring in 
2014 as we invested further in management, 
streamlined our processes and maximised 
the value of our shared service centres. We 
also increased our investment in R&D and in 
our network development function to 
support the future growth of the business. 
We expect to deliver further efficiencies and 
scale benefits in coming years.  www.regus.com 13

Outstanding teamwork
It has been a year of good progress for the 
Group – strategically, operationally and 
financially. This was achieved only with the 
dedication, focus and commitment of our 
people. As a service-based business, the 
strength and capabilities of our increasingly 
geographically diverse team are critical to 
achieving our objectives and I thank all of 
our staff for their considerable efforts.
We continually review the structure of our 
organisation to get the most out of our 
assets and to optimise on project delivery. 
With the continued growth and 
development at a country level, a strong 
local management presence is required. 
We continue to believe that our current 
organisational model – strong local 
in-country units assisted by support 
functions focused on strategy and  
process optimisation – will deliver our 
strategic goals. 
Our ability to recruit, train, promote and 
retain top quality talent with diverse 
backgrounds is a core strength of the 
business and important to our long-term 
success. For the Group as a whole our 
workforce is 75% female: 25% male (2013: 
70% female: 30% male); at a Group 
operational level the breakdown is broadly 
equal (no change on last year), and at a 
senior management level 33% of positions 
are held by women (2013: 30%). We remain 
committed to a fair approach and equal 
opportunities in all areas of our business.
Outlook
The business is performing well. Our past 
investments are producing attractive 
returns that are well above our cost of 
capital. This performance gives us the 
confidence to continue to invest, thereby 
enhancing future shareholder value. As of 
28 February 2015 we had clear visibility 
over net investments of approximately 
£120m which will increase the size of our 
network by some 400 locations. We will 
provide regular updates on our pipeline 
visibility as the year progresses.
We expect to reduce costs further as a 
percentage of sales as we leverage  
our increased scale and drive new 
operational efficiencies. This will further  
enhance earnings.
As the world of work continues to develop, 
and more organisations look to outsource 
their workplace needs, so the future 
remains positive for Regus. Current trading 
is in line with management’s expectations 
and we remain confident in our business 
model and prospects for 2015.

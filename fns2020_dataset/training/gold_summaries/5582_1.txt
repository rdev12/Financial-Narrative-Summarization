Integrated business model
The establishment of our 
independent divisions has  
created a strong portfolio of 
business units rarely seen in a 
biotechnology business model. 
Epistem provides a financially 
robust business, whilst offering  
the potential for significant financial 
upside from the development of  
our Personalised Medicine, Novel 
Therapies and Contract Research 
Services divisions. We continue to 
enhance and exploit our integrated 
core competence in epithelial cell 
biology and molecular (personalised) 
medicine, whilst retaining a high 
degree of commercial independence 
across each division. 
Financial review
The Company reports a turnover  
of £5.6m (2011: £5.8m) for the year 
ended 30 June 2012. Revenues 
were underpinned by the Contract 
Research Services division, which 
delivered sales of £2.9m (2011: 
£3.0m). The Personalised Medicine 
division saw sales increase to 
£2.7m (2011: £1.1m), with the  
Novel Therapies division reporting  
no sales over the period, £0.0m 
(2011: £1.6m). 
Consolidated territory revenues 
were split US 68% (2011: 68%),  
EU/ROW 19% (2011: 27%) and UK 
13% (2011: 5%). Flat year on year 
Contract Research Services sales  17
Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
delivered a slightly reduced year- 
on-year operating profit of £0.8m 
(2011 £1.0m). Operating profits  
were further bolstered by growth in 
Personalised Medicine sales, which 
saw the division deliver a step up in 
its operating profit to £0.4m (2011: 
£0.1m) over the year. With Novel 
Therapies investment in its lead 
development reporting an operating 
loss of £0.8m (2011: operating profit 
£0.6m) and central administration 
costs largely unchanged over the 
year at £1.3m (2011: £1.3m) this 
gave rise to an overall group 
operating loss for the year of 
(£0.8m) (2011: operating profit 
£0.4m). 
With the benefit of a £0.5m deferred 
tax credit, the Group reported loss 
after tax for the year was £0.2m 
(2011: profit £0.4m) with year end 
headcount in the Company at 63 
(2011: 55).
Cash balances following the 
completion of the £2.7m cash 
placing in December 2011 were 
£4.7m (2011: £3.6m). 
Reported loss per share was 2.9p 
(2011: Earnings per share 4.9p). 
Clear investor communication  
of the Company’s strategy and 
performance remains a key  
element of our success and we will 
continue to advance our investor 
communications as we embark 
upon the next phase of growth. 
The Company’s annual audit will  
be completed in October 2012 by 
HW Chartered Accountants and 
their audit report will be included  
in the annual accounts which  
are expected to be distributed  
to shareholders shortly.
Operating review
Contract Research Services
Contract Research Services 
delivered a marginally reduced 
year-on-year revenue performance, 
whilst producing a respectable 27% 
operating margin (£0.8m operating 
profit). Although market and industry 
conditions remain challenging, we 
continue to deliver a high margin, 
niche, pre-clinical service offering 
across our core disease areas of 
oncology, mucositis, inflammatory 
bowel disease and dermatology. 
Over the period, we continued to 
develop and extend our specialist 
service offering in the area of 
oncology (new imaging models)  
and advanced inflammation 
(rheumatoid arthritis) models.
As part of our ongoing collaboration 
with the US National Institutes of 
Health’s biodefence programme,  
we continue to expand our role  
as ‘Subject Matter Experts’ (SME)  
in radiation treatment and have 
recently taken receipt of a new GLP 
compliant state of the art irradiation 
and image analysis system funded 
by the US biodefence consortium. 
The US government remains 
committed to targeting treatment  
of radiation sickness following a 
nuclear incident/event. 
The new financial year promises  
to build on last year with the advent 
of new product developments  
in oncology (imaging), hair 
immunohistochemistry and 
advanced inflammation models 
from which we anticipate a return  
to modest growth.
Personalised  
Medicine Biomarker
Over the year, the Biomarker division 
enjoyed a strong uplift in revenue 
performance to £2.3m (2011: £1.1m) 
driven by the first full year of the 
Sanofi-Aventis collaboration  
and the commencement of the 
recently announced GSK fibrosis 
collaboration. Both collaborations 
utilise Epistem’s proprietary RNA 
amplification technology and 
oncology bioinformatics to provide 
biomarker discovery and translational 
support across the Sanofi-Aventis 
oncology drug development and 
GSK fibrosis drug discovery 
programmes. The Biomarker division 
works with major pharmaceutical 
and biotech business groups by 
providing a suite of pre-clinical and 
clinical pharmacodynamic models  
to measure the effect of a drug on 
targeted tissue (gene activated 
pathways). With the advance of the 
pharmaceutical industry focus on 
‘personalised medicine’ we have  
also linked the development of  
our Genedrive
™
 platform to our  18
Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
Biomarker group to help identify key 
mutational oncology targets such as 
KRAS, JAK2 and EGFR in cancerous 
tissue. The identification of these 
target mutations will enable patients 
to be ‘stratified’ for the correct 
course of ‘personalised’ therapeutic 
treatment. Over the coming year we 
will also accelerate our developments 
in circulating (blood) tumour cells by 
developing Genedrive
™
 for use as  
a highly sensitive screening tool to 
identify the presence of mutation 
targets in blood. 
Diagnostics
Following our first EU product 
registration for the Genedrive
™
  
unit (CE mark) and Tuberculosis 
assay (CE-IVD) and the recent 
announcements of the Becton 
Dickinson and Xcelris Laboratories 
collaborations in Tuberculosis,  
we now believe we are at the 
beginning of a new phase of 
product led revenue growth for 
Epistem. Both these commercial 
collaborations (supply and 
distribution arrangements in 
Tuberculosis) include escalating 
annual volume requirements for 
units and assays with our partners, 
with each contract capable of 
delivering revenues to Epistem  
in excess of US$20-30m per  
annum over the next 3-5 years. 
Tuberculosis represents a 
significant revenue prospect  
and initial opportunity for our 
Genedrive
™
 platform, lending itself 
to use both inside and outside  
the laboratory setting and hence 
enabling ‘near patient’ testing or 
testing in remote field locations.  
The Genedrive
™
 platform is 
expected to be capable of testing  
a wide range of infectious diseases 
with new tests under development 
including malaria, dengue, HIV, HCV 
and a range of sexually transmitted 
diseases. We expect to supply and 
distribute these high volume tests 
through a channel partner strategy. 
We are receiving strong interest  
and demand for the use and 
development of Genedrive
™
  
and we will be working closely  
with the World Health Organisation 
and other high profile Healthcare 
Foundations including both the 
Gates and Clinton Foundations  
to ensure that we position our 
Tuberculosis test to best diagnostic 
and therapeutic effect in the global 
market. Over the coming months  
we will be publishing our first  
clinical data on our Tuberculosis 
test and how this compares with 
other tests in the market and 
anticipate launching our first 
regulated product into the US$1bn 
Tuberculosis diagnostics market 
early in 2013. 
Alongside healthcare applications, 
we have also seen significant 
interest in the use of Genedrive
™
  
for biosurveillance and forensics 
targets. We are working closely with 
the US government on a number of 
programmes to identify biothreats 
and infectious diseases in military 
settings. A good example of this  
is the recent completion of the  
US Government contract with the 
Defence Threat Reduction Agency 
for next generation ‘remote settings’ 
diagnostics. This will provide 
Epistem with up to US$2.0m  
in staged funding over the next  
24 months. We anticipate further 
growth in the US Department of 
Defence areas over the coming 
year. In the UK, we continue to 
progress the National Police 
Improvements Agency (NPIA) 
programme to enable crime scene 
testing for DNA fingerprinting. 
Genedrive
™
 is a novel, disruptive 
and highly sensitive molecular 
diagnostic tool with the capability  
of targeting a near patient, low cost 
and rapid turnaround diagnosis 
(~30-60mins including sample 
preparation) across a broad 
spectrum of bacterial, viral, fungal 
and somatic mutational disease 
areas. We expect to see molecular 
diagnostics begin to dominate  
the next generation of diagnostic 
testing and to change the speed, 
accuracy and workflows in near 
patient ‘Point of Care’ diagnostic 
assessment. Over the coming year, 
we intend to accelerate our product 
developments through increased 
investment in our manpower 
resource and expertise, enhance 
our manufacturing and regulatory 
control and further develop our 
channel partner distribution strategy. 
The increased growth in 
Personalised Medicine revenues 
enabled the division to lift its 
operating profit over the year.  
We anticipate further growth in our 
portfolio of personalised medicine 
technologies driven by increasing 
medical focus for effective patient 
treatment, tighter regulatory 
requirements and the growing 
industry need for rapid, low cost 
and sensitive molecular diagnostic 
tools. Our proprietary technologies 
are well positioned to capitalise  
on this market growth.
Novel Therapies
The Novel Therapies collaboration 
with Novartis completed its funding 
phase in 2011 and we have continued 
to invest in the development of  
our prioritised novel hits/leads over 
the past year. With the Novartis 
collaboration expected to complete  
in 2013, we retain intellectual property 
rights over our collaborative leads 
and continue to progress discussions 
with Novartis and other groups 
around the development of our  
Novel Therapies lead programme. 
The timing of a license opportunity 
and/or funding support remains 
difficult to judge although we remain 
confident in our development 
programme and the prospect of 
future licenses and funding support. 
Chief Executive’s Review (continued)
Business Review 19
Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
Following protein synthesis of our 
prioritised hits/leads, we are now 
beginning to enter the early stages 
of pre-clinical efficacy testing.  
Over the coming months we will 
better establish our leads’ effect  
on the cell biology and signalling 
pathways which regulate the  
cell/stem cells in the areas of 
regenerative medicine and 
oncology. We are also considering 
small molecule partnerships to 
establish a portfolio of agents  
which regulate signalling pathways 
and cell biology. 
We will evaluate our other drug 
discovery and development 
opportunities with major industry 
players to identify new lead 
developments and to expand  
our discovery and early stage 
development platform. 
Current trading and outlook
We continue to develop a rich 
portfolio of technology and business 
opportunities to enable us to grow 
and invest in our future growth.  
We are continuing to build and 
strengthen our internal expertise 
across our core divisional 
programmes and this careful 
preparation is expected to deliver 
growth over the coming year.  
Our traditional business model of 
services and technology licensing 
continues to evolve with the advent 
of our new product revenues.  
We believe that the new product 
launches will continue to de-risk  
our business model and allow us 
to strengthen our trading position 
and increase the confidence of our 
future revenue forecasts. 
We continue to staff our 
management team with world class, 
innovative individuals who fit with 
the culture and dynamism of the 
Company. We also expect to build 
on our corporate and board strength 
and supplement our scientific 
advisory board and advisory 
committees as appropriate to reflect 
the changing nature of our business.
Our shareholder interest and 
support remains strong and we will 
ensure that our ongoing investor 
communications continue to nurture 
this relationship. 
We anticipate a strengthening 
operational and financial position  
for the year ahead based on our 
expectation of revenue growth  
and our overall growth plans. We 
remain selective in considering 
complementary technology, 
acquisitions and in-licensing,  
with few opportunities thus far 
meeting our high expectations. 
We remain firmly fixed on building 
shareholder value by providing a 
high margin, diverse and rapidly 
growing portfolio of world class 
technologies. 
I would like to thank the Board, 
management and employees for 
their help and support over the past 
year. I would also like to thank our 
investors for their continued support 
and interest in our technology and 
the Company as a whole. 
On behalf of the all the Board, 
management and staff at Epistem,  
I would also like to send our 
condolences to the family of 
Professor Chris Potten who died  
in August. Chris was a world-
renowned scientist who pioneered 
stem cell research in Manchester, 
UK. Chris led a team of researchers 
at the Paterson Institute at The 
Christie Hospital Manchester for 
more than 30 years. He was 
regarded as one of the world’s  
most influential figures in his field 
and developed research which  
is now central to many areas of 
cancer therapy. He published 
around 400 scientific papers and  
11 books – ensuring a reference 
legacy that will be used for many 
years to come. In 2000, he co-
founded Epistem with Cath Booth 
and his team. Chris will be sadly 
missed, but we look forward to 
maintaining and developing the 
legacy that Chris created.

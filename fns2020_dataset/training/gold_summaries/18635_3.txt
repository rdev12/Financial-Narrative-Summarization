 Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Halladale Group plc 4
Chairman’s statement
This has been another year 
of remarkable progress for
Halladale. 
Fred Shedden
Chairman
Proﬁt before tax for the year to 30 April 2006 increased by 60% to
£6.29m, basic earnings per share grew by 2% to 10.61p and, based 
on the pro forma unaudited balance sheet set out on page 54, triple 
net asset value per share rose by 30% to 121.6p. The increase in basic
earnings per share is stated after accounting for the substantial increase
in share capital following the issue of new shares in May 2005. Further
information about these ﬁgures is contained in the Financial Review.
These excellent results enable the continuation of our progressive
dividend policy and the Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 2.4p
per share. Taken together with the interim dividend of 1.4p per share
paid on 14 February 2006 the total dividend in respect of the year to 
30 April 2006 will therefore be 3.8p per share, an increase of 31% over
last year’s ﬁgure. Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General
Meeting the ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 14 September 2006 to
shareholders on the register on 21 July 2006. The new shares issued 
in May of this year will not rank for the ﬁnal dividend.
As you will see from the Chief Executive’s Review this has been 
another year of very high activity with aggregate value of acquisitions
and sales exceeding £450m. At the year end the total portfolio under
management, including co-investment projects of £529m (2005 –
£388m), was £632m on a pro forma basis. When I ﬁrst reported to 
you as chairman in 2001 the comparable ﬁgure was £60m which gives 
a dramatic indication of the growth which has taken place in Halladale
during the last ﬁve years. 5
“This has been another year of
very high activity with aggregate
value of acquisitions and sales
exceeding £450m.”
On 23 May 2006 we announced a successful placing and subscription 
of new ordinary shares and convertible unsecured loan stock which
raised a total of £29.1m after expenses. A combination of new and
existing investors participated in this capital raising exercise, broadening
our growing institutional shareholder base. The new funds will enable
Halladale to accelerate its expansion plans across all key areas of 
the business.
As always I hope that shareholders will join us at this year’s Annual
General Meeting which will take place in Edinburgh on 12 September
2006. My colleagues and I welcome the opportunity to meet
shareholders and to answer their questions. As in previous years there
will be a presentation about the Company’s activities following the
conclusion of the formal business of the Annual General Meeting.
I would like to thank my Board colleagues for their continued support
and on your behalf to express my thanks to all the Halladale team. 
They are a fantastic bunch of people whose dedication and commitment
has again been outstanding. We are all committed to delivering good
shareholder value and I am conﬁdent that we can continue to do so.

Chairman

888’s mission is to supply its customers

all in a safe and secure environment. 
The Group’s competitive advantages

Technology leadership and continuous

edge. This is supported by a strong 
corporate culture which encourages 
our skilled end entrepreneurial team 
to develop innovative ideas and test 
them. Whilst a significant number of 
our myriad ideas and projects may 
never reach the market, they are part 
of a process and mindset of continually 
striving to develop our edge and lead 
the industry. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STRATEGIC REPORT
888 today is a truly diversified operator across 
markets and product verticals with a unique 
technology platform and an outstanding team  
and culture at its core.
ITAI FRIEBERGER
Chief Executive Officer
888 employs an extensive team 
of highly trained and experienced 
business analytics and data-mining 
professionals who have analysed and 
learned from customer behaviour since 
888’s foundation nearly two decades 
ago. Teams across 888 from product 
development to marketing to customer 
support leverage this extensive and 
constantly evolving data and, by applying 
robust statistical models, are able to 
successfully influence the following 
three key drivers of 888’s success:
 ♦ increasing the number of new players 
(first time depositors or “FTDs”) 
across 888’s brands; 
 ♦ reducing the cost per acquisition 
(“CPA”) of those new players to 888; 
and
 ♦ maximising the life time value (“LTV”) 
(measured as average forecasted 
revenue over a customer’s entire life 
cycle) to 888 of each customer.
This is supported by 888’s strong, trusted 
and award-winning brands that remain 
crucial in the competitive global online 
gaming market. The Group’s consistent 
and engaging customer offer, focused 
customer support and heritage in online 
gaming have meant that 888’s brands are 
amongst the most trusted and recognised 
in the online industry. The Group’s resolute 
focus on product development, customer 
service and marketing continue to 
support the sustained strength and appeal 
of 888’s brands. 
As a business we never lose sight of 
our duty as a responsible operator and 
888 acknowledges there is a potential 
danger that its games may pose for 
a small minority of people. We take 
comprehensive steps to minimise fraud, 
problem gaming and eliminate minors 
from using our services. Through rigorous 
and timely customer checks as well as 
ongoing real-time tracking of customer 
activity, 888 continually monitors for 
irregular activity that may be an indication 
of compulsive gaming or fraud. 888’s 
fraud and prevention and customer 
service teams are highly trained and have 
developed efficient and proactive methods 
to identify issues and notify and protect 
our customers. Further details on 888’s 
robust Information Technology systems 
are given in the Risk Management Strategy 
report on page 26. We pride ourselves on 
the strength of our customer relationships 
and first class customer support is offered 
through telephone, email and online chat 
functions to customers around the world 
in nine different languages. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

COST DRIVEN
ONLINE BUSINESS CYCLE FACTORS
1. Marketing 
At the core of 888’s business philosophy 
is an unwavering focus on return to cost 
driven marketing. The business continually 
develops innovative marketing techniques 
and channels, both online (including 
online advertising, affiliate programmes, 
search engine optimisation) and offline 
(including TV and print media advertising, 
sponsorships) to support its brands and 
increase customer loyalty. The returns 
to cost of all marketing campaigns are 
rigorously tested against 888’s strict 
criteria before being extended to their 
target markets. This ensures that 888’s 
marketing spend is both cost efficient 
and highly effective.
2. Acquisition
Effective marketing helps to attract 
increased customers to 888’s brands in the 
most cost effective manner. Strong levels 
of customer acquisition, measured by 
increases in first time depositors (“FTDs”), 
is the fuel for 888’s ongoing growth.
3. Deposits
Customers need to be able to enjoy 
a seamless, enjoyable journey from the 
moment they visit our websites through 
to depositing into their accounts and 
enjoying our games. 
888’s leading proprietary payment 
processing capabilities support a wide 
variety of languages and currencies with 
more than 35 payment methods. It is vital 
that we are able to offer fast, efficient and 
easy to use payment processing, both to 
ensure a positive customer experience 
but also to maximise revenue and convert 
browsers into players. 888’s payment 
options include a cashier interface 
available in 18 languages, both for desktop 
and on mobile/tablet devices, with the 
most relevant payment methods identified 
and emphasised for different customers 
according to their market. 
4. Customer Relationship Management 
Once we have acquired a customer, 
we want to keep them enjoying their 
experience with 888 for the longest 
time possible. 
Underpinned by sophisticated statistical 
models, the Group is able to effectively 
predict the life-time value of a new 
customer within a short period of time 
of them joining 888. This helps enable 
888 to deliver to customers personalised 
communications across relevant 
channels that increase loyalty and 
activity. Underpinned by 888’s analytical 
approach, the Group offers a broad range 
of appealing bonuses that are localised 
from country to country, from product to 
product, and according to a customer’s 
individual profile. Furthermore, 888 is able 
to apply these skills to accurately identify 
potential “churning” players according 
to certain characteristics, interact with 
those players accordingly, and retain 
them for longer.
5. Activity
Ensuring that we continually offer a 
high quality product across our brands 
helps to increase customer activity and, 
consequently, life-time value with 888. 
888’s ability to successfully develop new 
proprietary games and functionality on 
mobile and desktop platforms helps to 
differentiate the 888 experience in the 
eyes of the customer. 888 combines 
exclusive and high-quality “in house” 
created content with third-party 
games and branded content to ensure 
that we always offer the freshest and 
most enjoyable customer proposition. 
888’s products are seamlessly available 
and responsive across mobile and 
desktop platforms and the flexibility and  
consistent experience across devices 
means that customers are able to 
enjoy unrivalled gaming entertainment 
however and wherever they choose. 
With 888’s strengths in four major 
online gaming verticals – Casino, Poker, 
Sport and Bingo – through the use of 
analytics and proven predictive modelling, 
888 is able to enhance customer activity 
and life-time value by promoting each 
relevant product to existing customers 
in a targeted and attractive way. 
6. Gaming revenue 
By generating upward trends in customer 
LTV, our marketing teams are able 
to increase investment in campaigns 
to acquire more new customers and 
still ensure that the business meets 
its strict return to cost criteria.

CASINO
888casino is one of the most recognised and longest 
standing online casino brands in the market, and the 
winner of numerous prestigious awards. 
888casino is known for its generous jackpot prizes and 
aims to provide the most enjoyable online experience 
available by combining exclusive in-house developed 
games alongside branded video slots and “live” Casino 
games, which offer high-quality video streamed casino 
games with a range of professional dealers.
Online casinos replicate the real-life casino experience 
with players playing against “the house” across online 
versions of classic casino table games such as roulette 
and blackjack as well as slot and video games. In these 
games, the house has a statistical advantage or “edge”.
Casino gaming revenue is represented by the difference 
between the amounts of bets placed by customers less 
amounts won. 
888poker is a multi-award winning poker destination, 
offering a first-class poker environment that enables 
players of all abilities to enjoy the games of their choice 
alongside a variety of innovative features. Formats and 
features include BLAST (combining gaming with poker, 
allowing players to compete for a randomly drawn 
prize pool of up to 10,000 times the player’s “buy in” in 
a time-limited game), PokerCam (enabling players to 
enjoy secure poker games that are available in real time 
via 888’s streaming webcam technology), 3D Poker, 
and TeamsPoker tournaments.
888poker offers T exas Hold’em, Omaha Hi’Lo, 7 Card 
Stud, Razz and other poker variations in Pot Limit, 
Fixed Limit and No Limit formats.
In online poker the operator acts as the virtual host 
for the game and provides a platform that enables 
customers to play various forms of poker against 
each other.
Poker revenue represents the commission (or “rake”) 
charged from each poker hand in ring games, and 
entry fees for participation in Poker tournaments.
POKER
888’s leading bingo brands each have engaging 
themes, a variety of games and a strong sense of 
community, replicating the experience of traditional 
bingo halls. The Group’s bingo brands also benefit 
from a range of 888 and third party developed slot 
games, casino games and scratch cards that are offered 
alongside traditional bingo formats.
888’s portfolio of brands includes 888 Ladies, 
Wink Bingo, Posh Bingo and others. 
As with traditional bingo halls, online bingo rooms offer 
customers the chance of winning prizes by purchasing 
tickets and playing their bingo format of choice.
Bingo online gaming revenue is represented by the 
difference between the amounts of bets placed by 
customers less amounts won.
BINGO
888sport is a fast-growing sports betting destination. 
At the heart of the 888sport offer is genuine passion 
for sport, with thousands of live and pre-event betting 
markets on offer across hundreds of events, from the

2  Constant currency: 888 reports its financial results in US$ but (i) generates certain revenue streams from 
customers using other currencies and (ii) incurs costs in various currencies. Due to the strong US$ in 2016, 
reported revenue and profit were adversely impacted. Constant currency has been calculated as follows: (i) 
Revenue: with the exception of Poker, by applying 2015 exchange rates to revenue generated during 2016. 
Poker revenue was also adversely impacted given that many Poker customers fund their US$ bankroll using 
other currencies, which suffered reduced purchasing power compared to the US$. It is difficult to quantify 
reliably this indirect impact (other than a small adjustment which was made to Poker revenue generated in 
Euro) (ii) Costs were retranslated by applying 2015 exchange rates.
3  Sport, which was previously included in the Emerging Offerings segment, is presented as a standalone 
segment. Brand licensing on third-party platforms, which was previously included in the Emerging Offerings 
segment, is now included in the B2B segment. 2015 revenue figures have been re-classified to allow a like for 
like comparison. These changes are described in note 2 to the financial statements.

relating to activity in prior years (2015: US$8.4 million).
6  Excluding share benefit charges of US$6.7 million (2015: US$4.1 million).
INTRODUCTION
888’s success is built on its technological strength in combination with the efficient 
utilisation of this technology, directed by extensive data analytics. The goals of 
888’s business are simple: to maximise customer recruitment, increase customer 
life-time value and minimise the cost per customer acquisition, thereby optimising 
return on marketing investment. The Group’s strong financial performance in 2016 
is once again a reflection of 888’s continued success in attracting new customers,

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND DIVIDEND
In 2016 888’s revenue reached an all-time 
high of US$520.8 million (2015: US$462.1 
million), driven by the continued strong 
performances of Casino, Sport and 
regulated markets including Spain 
and Italy as well as further growth on 
mobile devices. This revenue growth 
of 13% compared to 2015 was achieved 
despite weaker currencies compared 
to the US$ when compared to the 
prior year. At constant currency, Group 
revenue increased 18% year on year to 
US$546.4 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the year increased 
by 12% to US$90.2 million (2015: US$80.6  
million) which represented 24% growth 
at constant currency at US$100 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin remained 
stable at 17.3% (2015: 17.4%) despite 
significant adverse currency movements. 
At constant currency, Adjusted EBITDA 
margin was 18.3%. 
Profit before tax increased by 82% to 
US$59.2 million (2015: US$32.5 million) 
and profit after tax increased by 75% to 
US$51.5 million (2015: US$29.5 million). 
Basic Earnings per Share increased by 
74% to 14.4¢ (2015: 8.3¢).
Cash generated from operating 
activities was US$68.1 million in 2016 
(2015: US$85.0 million). The decrease 
compared to 2015 is more than offset 
when adding back US$22.7 million cash 
payments made during the year which 
relate to previous periods: US$14.5 
million costs incurred during 2015 in 
respect of UK point of consumption 
tax, VAT and gaming duties (2015: 
US$3.0 million) and of US$8.2 million in 
respect of exceptional retroactive duties 
and associated charges (2015: US$3.2 
million). 
As at 31 December 2016, the Group’s 
financial position remains strong with 
cash and cash equivalents of US$172.6 
million (2015: US$178.6 million). This is 
despite the adverse impact from Sterling 
devaluation of US$8.4 million. As at 31 
December 2016, the Group had US$75.7 
million liabilities to customers (2015: 
US$82.4 million), which was effectively 
reduced by US$3.7 million as a result of 
Sterling devaluation.
Given the strong results during the year 
the Board of Directors is recommending 
a final dividend of 5.1¢ per share in 
accordance with 888’s dividend policy 
plus an additional one-off 10.5¢ per share 
bringing the total for the year to 19.4¢ 
per share (2015: 15.5¢ per share).
B2C OVERVIEW 
Active B2C customers and first time 
depositors, two core KPIs of the 
B2C business, increased 5% and 14% 
respectively year on year. This reflects 
highly effective customer relationship 
management and marketing activity 
across our brands as well as strong 
growth on mobile and in Sport 
which we are for the first time in the 
Group’s annual results reporting as 
a standalone vertical. The total number 
of active customers across 888’s B2C 
Casino and Poker brands in the last 
quarter of 2016 was 728,000.
B2C revenue during the year was 
US$460.2 million, representing a 15% 
increase on the prior year (2015: US$399.4 
million) and 88% of total Group revenue 
(2015: 86%). This strong outcome was 
driven primarily by continued momentum 
in Casino, outstanding growth in Sport, 
further growth in regulated markets 
and the increasing popularity of mobile.  18

Mobile remains a key driver in terms of revenue, deposits and customer recruitment 
across product verticals for 888 and the Group continues to benefit from owning 
its own proprietary mobile solution and games. B2C revenue from mobile devices in 
the UK increased to represent 60% (2015: 47%) of total UK revenue with customer 
recruitment and deposits from mobile devices also rising significantly.

1. The Group has changed its operating segments in the period to reflect a change in the way that the business 
is managed and reported internally. Sport is now presented separately, having previously been reported in 
Emerging Offerings. Brand licensing on third-party platforms, which was previously included in Emerging 
Offerings, is now included in the B2B segment. The comparative segment results for the year ended 
31 December 2015 have been re-classified to reflect this change to allow a like for like comparison. Of the 
Emerging Offerings revenue of US$41.3 million, US$34.8 million has been classified in the Sport segment 
and US$3.2 million in the B2B segment.
2. Regulated and taxed markets refers to jurisdictions where there are regulations in place or where the Group 
is liable for gaming duties or VAT (or its equivalent).
888 continued to deliver growth in the UK market with a revenue increase of 16% 
year on year at constant currency and 5% increase year on year at reported revenue, 
driven by strong performances in Casino and Sport and supported by innovative 
multi-channel marketing initiatives and CRM enhancement enabling effective  
cross-sell. 
Europe’s (excluding UK) significant growth of 29% reflects the strong progress 
delivered across regulated markets mainly in Italy which commenced offering Sport 
during the first quarter of 2016, and Spain, where a strong product suite offering 
and successful marketing campaigns are driving growth. The Group also saw new 
contributions from Denmark and Romania.
Other markets (America and Rest of world) continue to represent smaller proportion 
of Group’s revenue and, as such, fewer resources have been allocated to them, 
which resulted in a year. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Results overview
In 2016, Poker again outperformed a 
challenging poker market backdrop to 
increase first time depositors by 6% and 
remains a credible alternative for Poker 
players. Poker revenue for 2016 was 
US$84.4 million (2015: US$86.7 million). 
The Poker product continued to be an 
attractive source of player’s acquisition, 
retention and cross-sell into Casino and 
Sport. When factoring 888poker’s cross-
sell contribution, 888poker revenue did 
not decline year on year. 
Product overview
The Group’s Poker continues to be 
recognised as a premier destination for 
recreational players and benefit from a 
fully integrated casino gaming suite and 
sports betting proposition, supporting 
the Group’s ability to cross-sell effectively. 
Poker revenue in Q4 2016 was the 
highest of the year (at constant currency) 
driven by the successful launch of Poker 
“BLAST” in July 2016, a “Sit n’ Go” Poker 
tournament format for a pre-set number 
of players. 
888poker prides itself on delivering an 
incomparable gaming experience with 
the widest possible range of formats and 
tournaments. T ournaments are critical 
to the success of the Poker business, 
driving both active customers and first 
time depositors. During the year, 888 
hosted four major poker tournaments (“XL 
T ournaments”), with more prize money 
on offer to players than ever before. As 
well as continuing to drive growth through 
profitable tournaments, in 2017 a major 
focus will be on growing 888poker by 
developing new variants and games that 
are designed to enhance the customer 
experience on mobile devices. 
Results overview
Casino continued its outstanding 
momentum delivering another year of 
double digit revenue growth. Casino 
revenue increased 21% to US$279.3 million 
(2015: US$230.6 million). At constant 
currency, growth was 26%. Active 
players rose 27% compared to the prior 
year and first time depositors increased 
by 23% despite the strong prior year 
comparatives. 
This very good result reflected further 
growth on mobile and excellent 
momentum across a number of regulated 
markets, notably Spain and Italy. Casino 
also benefitted from the successful launch 
of the Group’s new 777.com towards the 
end of 2015 as well as effective cross-sell 
from other verticals, notably the fast-
growing Sport.
Product overview
The success of Casino remains 
underpinned by our heritage as an online 
casino operator and innovative customer 
proposition alongside highly effective CRM 
and marketing. Casino offers classic table 
games, such as blackjack and roulette, 
as well as, exclusive in-house developed 
proprietary games which differentiate 
the brand in the market. The Group 
constantly develops its Casino offer and, 
during 2016, added 57 new games across 
mobile and desktop platforms. In addition 
to our unique content we also provide 
best-in-class and carefully selected third-
party content to accommodate all our 
customers’ needs.

Bingo active players increased 8%

success of marketing activity and CRM as 
well as the growth of our bingo brands 
on mobile. Mobile devices represent 54%

increased by 7% supported in part by 
newly launched brands, notably Winkslots 
which offers a wide variety of games.
Reported Bingo revenue was US$41.8 
million (2015: US$44.0 million) as a result 
of a significant adverse currency impact 
with the vast majority of Bingo revenue 
denominated in Sterling, which was 
weaker year on year compared to the  
US$, the Group’s reporting currency.
Product overview
888 offers online bingo entertainment 
across a broad range of branded bingo 
sites, each with its own engaging 
theme and rich content. During the 
year, the Group’s bingo brands also 
continued to benefit from new content 
including in-house developed games 
and greater shared progressive 
jackpots, which together contribute to 
enhancing and differentiating 888 in 
this competitive market. 20

This was a first in the market and 
captured a wider consumer trend for geo-
technology games, helping to drive brand 
engagement and customer recruitment. 
As well as providing a growing revenue 
stream for 888, Sport is an increasingly 
important customer acquisition channel 
for the Group, with the lowest cost per 
acquisition for new customers across 
product verticals. Using the Group’s first 
class CRM and analytics capabilities, as 
well as leveraging 888’s strong brands 
in other verticals, 888 remains focused 
on cross-selling customers to other 888 
games and brands as a major driver 
of the Group’s overall strategy and 
continued success. 
B2B REVIEW
Results overview
Revenue from Dragonfish, 888’s B2B 
offering, was US$60.6 million (2015: 
US$62.7 million), with weaker Sterling 
impacting the results from our UK bingo 
network. At constant currency, B2B 
revenue increased 6% to US$66.5 million.
B2B revenue from the USA business was 
slightly lower compared to prior year 
reflecting continued operational changes 
being implemented that are aimed at 
increasing the long term sustainability 
of the business.
Operational overview
During 2016 the B2B platform continued 
to grow with 23 new skins added to the 
network and our partners continuing 
to benefit from new features and 
functionality including the developments 
of shared jackpots across bingo brands 
on the network. In the US, our partners in 
the states of Delaware and New Jersey 
continued to benefit from our unique 
interstate network launched in February 
2015 that enables the pooling of poker 
players across the two states. 
Dragonfish continued to enjoy success 
following the launch of the CasinoFlex 
brand (the Group’s Instant Games Only 
Platform) towards the end of 2015 with 
more brands added to the platform during 
the year. Increased Casino games on offer 
and integrations with vendors serving 
to further differentiate the Group’s B2B 
casino offering in the market.
EXPENSES OVERVIEW
888’s strategic decision to accelerate 
Sport marketing activities, substantially 
invest in Casino and drive continued 
expansion in regulated markets has 
resulted in increased selling and marketing 
investment. This investment created 
strong foundations for outstanding results 
in Sport, following exceptional growth in 
2015, and Casino, with another year of 
double digit revenue growth.
The continued growth in regulated and 
taxed markets which represented 71% of 
total revenue, resulted in an increase in 
gaming duties* levied in these markets 
during the year.
The Group continues to sustain its 
operating efficiencies, which resulted 
in a lower expenses to revenue ratio for 
expenses other than selling and marketing 
and gaming tax.
Operating expenses
Strong performance of Sport product 
which is powered by third-party platform 
coupled with the substantial increase 
in Casino that was supplemented 
by Live Casino provider, resulted in 
increased associated charges. This has 
contributed to the increase of 7% in 
operating expenses* to US$136.1 million 
(2015: US$127.4 million).
The proportion of operating expenses* 
(which mainly comprise employee related 
costs, commissions and royalties payable 
to third parties, chargebacks, payment 
service providers’ (“PSP”) commissions 
and costs related to operational risk 
management services) to revenues 
decreased to 26.1% (2015: 27.6%) reflecting 
continued operating efficiencies, strict 
cost control and the effect of weaker 
currencies compared to the US$. Reported 
operating expenses amounted to US$155.1 
million (2015: US$146.0 million).
Staff costs as a percentage of revenues 
was 11%, compared to 12% in prior year, 
with the reduction primarily a result of 
moderate cost increase offset by currency 
movements.
Deposit volumes substantially increased 
during the year while the chargebacks 
ratio remained stable at 0.8% (2015: 
0.7%) of revenue, reflecting an optimised 
balance between maintaining revenues 
and increased deposits inflow whilst 
reducing transactions with high risk 
profiles. This was achieved through the 
continued use of risk management and 
fraud detection mechanisms which 
enhance internal monitoring systems, alert 
processes and reporting including the 
continued use of 3DSecure verification 
systems. In addition, during the year 
the Group intensified its ability to verify 
members through document submission, 
an integral part of our regulatory “Know 
Your Customer” obligations.

at constant currency
Results overview
Sport is an increasingly important market 
for 888 both in terms of revenue and 
customer acquisition and, reflecting this, 
the Group is now presenting Sport as 
a standalone operational segment.
Following exceptional growth in 2015, 
Sport delivered another outstanding 
results in 2016 with revenue for the 
period of US$51.9 million (2015: US$34.8 
million), a 49% increase compared to the 
prior year and 58% growth at constant 
currency. Active Sport customers in 2016 
increased by 49% and first time depositors 
increased by 52% year on year. This very 
strong performance was supported by 
accelerated marketing investment, growth 
on mobile and a successful Euro 2016 
which demonstrated the Group’s ability 
to successfully compete during major 
sporting events. 888sport’s continued 
growth and momentum also benefited 
from launches into Denmark towards 
the end of 2015 and Italy during the first 
quarter of this year. 
Product overview
Supported by increased marketing 
investment and the consistent 
development of markets and events for 
customers to enjoy, the 888sport brand 
is increasingly recognised by customers 
as a premier sports betting destination. 
As well as agreeing sponsorship deals 
with four Championship League football 
clubs to raise the profile of the brand, 
in September the Group launched a new 
multi-channel marketing campaign in 
the UK to support 888sport’s growth. 
The new campaign, themed “T ake’Em On”, 
is focused away from the noise of simply 
promoting customer offers and matching 
odds and has greater emphasis on 
customer engagement and empowering 
customers by placing them and their 
competitive spirit at the center of the 
888sport experience.
We continued to develop our innovative 
mindset to sports betting with the 
development of a new ‘Free Bet Hunt’ 
game for customers. The Free Bet Hunt 
is a geo-technology game allowing 
customers to search for free-bet offers 
when near to particular football stadia.

Gaming taxes and duties 
Further Revenue growth in regulated 
markets primarily as a result of the 
launch of Sport in Italy as well as newly 
regulated and taxed markets, which 
commenced activity in the second half 
of 2015, namely Denmark, Romania and 
Ireland, resulted in an increase of 21% in 
gaming duties* to US$60.5 million (2015: 
US$50.0 million).
Reported gaming taxes and duties 
amounted to US$63.5 million (2015: 
US$58.4 million). 
* As defined in the table set out on page 16. 
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses 
in the income statement decreased to 
US$34.3 million (2015: US$36.8 million). 
However, when adding back capitalised 
development expenses, overall research 
and development spend would have 
increased 4% to US$43.9 million (2015: 
US$42.0 million). This reflects significant 
investment in regulated markets 
expansion and the Group’s continued 
focus on product development, including 
the development of new games, 
conversion of Flash technology to 
advanced HTML5 across PC and mobile. 
Selling and marketing expenses
888’s strategic decision to accelerate 
Sport and Casino marketing activities 
and continued expansion in regulated 
markets has resulted in increased selling 
and marketing investment of US$170.2 
million (2015: US$138.9 million). The 
marketing to revenue ratio stabilised in 
the second half of the year at 30.9%, 
after a peak of 34.4% in the first half of 
2016, resulting in an overall 32.7% ratio 
in 2016 (2015: 30.1%). As a result of this 
investment, Casino maintained its strong 
momentum across regulated markets, 
benefiting from the success of the new 
777.com brand launched at the end 
of 2015. 
Sport achieved a 49% revenue increase 
compared to previous year supported 
by a very successful Euro 2016, the 
launches into Denmark towards the end 
of 2015 and Italy during the first quarter 
of the year as well as continued brand 
expansion in the UK with the sponsorship 
of four Championship football clubs.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses* amounted to 
US$29.5 million (2015: US$28.4 million) 
but represented a lower proportion of 
revenue compared to the previous year 
at 5.7% (2015: 6.2%). The slight increase 
in administrative expenses is attributed 
to legal costs associated with the 
increased focus in regulated markets. 
Reported administrative expenses 
amounted to US$36.2 million (2015: 
US$32.5 million). 
* As defined in the table set out on page 16.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to 
US$90.2 million (2015: US$80.6 million). 
This is a strong result given external 
factors during the year including new 
gaming duties from regulated markets 
which commenced activity during the 
second half of 2015, namely Denmark, 
Romania and Ireland, with costs of 
US$4.4 million (2015: US$1.7 million), and 
adverse currency movements, principally 
as a result of the weaker Sterling. 
Adjusted EBITDA at constant currency 
increased 24% to US$100 million. 
The Adjusted EBITDA margin remained 
steady at 17.3% (2015: 17.4%) or 18.3% at 
constant currency. EBITDA for the period 
increased 34% to US$79.5 million (2015: 
US$59.3 million).

Share benefit charges
Share benefit charges relate to long-
term incentive equity awards granted 
to eligible employees.
Equity settled share benefit charges 
of US$6.7 million (2015: US$2.4 million) 
comprise of new grants during 
the year and the full year effect of 
awards granted in previous years 
and amounted to US$2.4 million 
and US$4.3 million, respectively. 
There are no Cash settled share benefit 
charges for 2016 (2015: US$1.7 million). 
Further details are given in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 54.
Finance income and expenses
Finance income of US$0.4 million 
(2015: US$0.3 million) less finance 
expenses of US$1.7 million (2015: 
US$2.6 million, excluding exceptional 
items) resulted in a net expense of US$1.3 
million (2015: expense of US$2.3 million). 
The decrease compared to the previous 
year is attributable to the fair value 
of operational hedging instruments.
888 continually monitors foreign 
currency risk and takes steps, 
where practical, to ensure that the 
net exposure is kept to an acceptable 
level. This has resulted in an income of 
US$0.9 million in respect of hedging 
of the foreign exchange movements 
between US$ and Israeli Shekels. An 
additional expense of US$2.6 million 
is attributable to the valuation of 
assets and liabilities denominated 
in currencies other than the 888’s 
functional currency mainly impacted 
by devaluation of the Sterling following 
the UK’s EU membership referendum 
on 23 June 2016. 
Exceptional costs
During 2016 888 incurred exceptional 
legal and professional costs of 
US$0.9 million associated with the 
subsequently aborted proposal for 
a potential combination between 
the Group, The Rank Group plc 
and William Hill plc. 
Separately, 888 incurred exceptional 
retroactive duties and associated 
charges relating to prior years of 
US$3.0 million in respect of gaming 
taxes (2015: US$8.4 million).
In total 888 recorded US$3.9 
million (2015: US$23.0 million) 
of exceptional costs.
Profit before tax
The Group’s excellent performance 
resulted and continued success has 
resulted in an 82% increase in profit 
before tax to US$59.2 million (2015: 
US$32.5 million), representing a ratio 
of 11% to revenue (2015: 7%).
Taxation and Profit after tax
Profit after tax substantially 
increased by 75% to US$51.5 million 
(2015: US$29.5 million).
The tax charge for the year was 
US$7.7 million (2015: US$3.0 million). 
The higher tax charge is attributed to 
withholding tax payable on dividends 
distributed by a subsidiary to the 
parent company during the year and 
one off tax credits in 2015 in respect 
of prior years. In 2015 and early 2016 the 
Group reached agreement on a number 
of tax matters with tax authorities in the 
key jurisdictions from which it operates. 
Further information on the Group’s 
corporate tax is given in note 8 to 2016 
financial statements.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased 
74% to 14.4¢ (2015: 8.3¢). Adjusted basic 
earnings per share increased 9% to 17.4¢ 
(2015: 15.9¢). Further information on 
reconciliation of Adjusted basic earnings 
per share is given in note 9 to 2016 
financial statements.
Dividend
Given the strong results during the year 
the Board of Directors is recommending 
a final dividend of 5.1¢ per share in 
accordance with 888’s dividend policy 
plus an additional one-off 10.5¢ per share 
bringing the total for the year to 19.4¢ 
per share (2015: 15.5¢ per share).
Cash flow
The Group’s strong performance and 
operating efficiency led to substantial 
free cash allowing for dividend payments 
during the year of US$56.6 million 
(2015: US$53.5 million). 
Cash generated from operating activities 
amounted to US$68.1 million (2015: 
US$85.0 million). The decrease is more 
than offset when adding back US$22.7 
million payments in respect of previous 
periods comprising: US$14.5 million 
relating to costs incurred during 2015 
in respect of UK point of consumption 
tax, VAT and gaming duties (2015: 
US$3.0 million) and US$8.2 million 
in respect of exceptional retroactive 
duties and associated charges (2015: 
US$3.2 million).
Balance sheet
888’s balance sheet remains strong, 
with no debt and ample liquid 
resources. 888’s cash position as at 
31 December 2016 was US$172.6 million 
(2015: US$178.6 million) impacted by 
Sterling’s devaluation of US$8.4 million. 
Balances owed to customers were 
US$75.7 million (2015: US$82.4 million) 
effectively reduced by US$3.7 million 
as a result of the Sterling devaluation. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

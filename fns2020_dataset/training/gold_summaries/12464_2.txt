OUR BUSINESS AT A GLANCE
We own or co-own the majority of our hotels and many  
were developed, converted or extensively renovated and 
repositioned by us. This means our properties have been 
developed to provide accommodation to our own high

identifying, optimising and realising real estate values, while 
delivering excellent returns through our management 
expertise. Our hotels are usually located in city centres, near 
major transport hubs and local landmarks. In addition, we 
focus on maximising revenue from each hotel through 
generating income from other areas such as meetings, events, 
restaurants, bars and spas. In 2008, we entered the resort 
segment of the market through our partnership with 
Arenaturist in Croatia. 
We proudly introduce a selection of our landmark hotels  
which are owned or co-owned. –7–

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
T
he year was characterised by the consistent 
development of the strategic aims of the 
business – in short, digital investment, a 
greater proportion of business generated 
from academic and professional publishing, a greater 
proportion of sales from non-traditional book retailers and 
a focus on marketing to discrete communities of interest.
Revenues grew 1.5% year on year to £111.1 million. Profit 
before tax and highlighted items** of £12.1 million was up 
1% year on year* from £12.0 million. Profit before tax was 
£9.6 million (2014*: £9.5 million). 
There were excellent performances in the Children’s & 
Educational division, including strong growth from Harry 
Potter titles, and in the Academic & Professional division, with 
strong digital and UK rights revenues mitigating lower print 
sales. In the Adult division revenues were reduced against 
a tough comparator which included Khaled Hosseini’s And 
the Mountains Echoed, but this was a solid performance in a 
year with fewer major bestsellers. Bloomsbury Information 
revenues and profits were flat year on year.
The majority of our revenue comprises title sales, which 
dipped by 4% year on year to £97.0 million, with digital 
sales, within this total, reduced by 4% to £11.7 million. 
Digital sales make up 12.1% of title sales (2014: 12.1%). 
Higher margin rights and services revenues grew by £5.6 
million to £14.1 million and formed 13% of total Group 
revenues compared to last year’s weaker performance of 
8%, and previous years of 12% in 2013 and 13% in 2012. 
The operating profit margin before highlighted items for 
the Group was maintained year on year at 11%. Operating 
profits before tax and highlighted items in the UK business 
were up by 5% to £11.3 million. In the US profits fell by 
7% to £0.7 million reflecting a reduction in academic 
print title sales. Australia saw another significant growth in 
profits by £0.2 million to £0.3 million. In its second full year 
of operation, our Indian publishing business generated 
revenues of £1.6 million and start-up losses of £0.2 million 
before the allocation of Group costs, with a particularly 
encouraging performance from local publishing.
*  Results for 2013/14 year have been adjusted for the change in policy, announced 
in July 2014, for the treatment of amortisation of internally generated intangible 
assets.
**  Highlighted items comprise amortisation of acquired intangible assets, 
acquisition related legal and other professional fees and restructuring costs.
It has been a good year 
for Bloomsbury and we 
are pleased with the 
Group’s performance. The 
spirit of intense focus on 
performance combined with 
entrepreneurial drive saw us 
deliver an impressive result 
against a backdrop of change 
in our industry.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

In December 2014, Bloomsbury completed the acquisition 
of Osprey Publishing, the Oxford-based military, heritage 
and natural history publisher, which now operates within 
our Adult division. The consideration of £4.6 million 
was satisfied by the payment of £3.2 million in cash on 
completion and the issue of 869,054 new Bloomsbury 
Ordinary shares, which constitute approximately 1.2% 
of Bloomsbury’s outstanding share capital. Osprey 
had approximately £0.3 million of cash at the time of 
acquisition. The acquisition, which was immediately 
earnings enhancing, contributed £1.2 million of revenue 
and £0.1 million of operating profit before highlighted 
items to Bloomsbury in the year ending 28 February 
2015. This acquisition highlights our strategy of reducing 
our exposure to the traditional book market. Over the 
last few years many countries have seen retail bookshop 
closures and increasing discount pressure from retailers. 
Although, on the positive side, trade return levels from 
retailers continue to fall and we continue to see the benefits 
from reduced print costs and better service levels. Profits 
from the consumer book market made up 44% of total 
Bloomsbury operating profit in the 2015 year (2014: 53%).
In response to the evolving digital marketplace, the 
development of online knowledge hubs and intellectual 
property platforms have become a core part of our 
business. In light of this, our investment in online platforms, 
which was previously relatively small, has been increasing. 
In a statement in July 2014 we announced that we had 
therefore decided to change the treatment in our 
financial statements of the amortisation of product and 
systems development assets, our internally generated 
intangibles. Previously this amortisation was included 
within highlighted items, it is now included within profit 
before tax and highlighted items. The change has no effect 
on profit before tax or cash. The prior period results for 
the year ended 28 February 2014 have been represented 
accordingly, with profit before tax and highlighted items 
reduced by £1.1 million. In the current year there was £1.4 
million of amortisation of internally generated intangibles. 
The acquisition of Osprey Publishing, related restructuring 
and other strategic initiatives have resulted in £0.7 million 
of costs which, together with amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, are highlighted separately in the financial 
statements.
The effective rate of tax for the year was 8.9% compared 
to 18.7% for the year ended 28 February 2014. The rate 
reduction reflects the recognition of additional deferred 
tax assets, including more UK tax losses. 
Diluted earnings per share, excluding highlighted items,

were 14.73p, up 15% from 12.80p in 2014, reflecting the 
reduction in effective rate of tax. Total diluted earnings per 
share for the year were 11.90p compared to 10.43p in 2014.
The Group’s cash balance net of borrowing drawdowns 
was £7.5 million at 28 February 2015 (2014: £10.0 million). 
Cash outflows in the year included £5.3 million for 
acquisition investment net of cash acquired.
During the year we published 2,415 new titles compared 
to 2,189 in 2014. 55% of these were in the Academic & 
Professional division (2014: 49%).
We continue to reduce costs in the business through 
volume-based tender processes. Having reviewed mono 
and colour print, prepress, image licensing and conversion 
costs over the past two years we will be assessing freight 
costs and editorial services in the forthcoming year.
There will be continued emphasis on our shift to an 
XML-based workflow which ensures that all Bloomsbury 
intellectual property has a standard underlying structure, 
ready for export to all known formats, including print, 
as well as providing a large degree of ‘future-proofing’ 
for any not-yet-known formats that the evolving digital 
marketplace may demand.  
Divisional Review
Academic & Professional
Revenues for the year were up by 12% to £36.0 million 
(2014: £32.1 million). Digital title sales grew by 35% year 
on year to £4.2 million, more than double the overall 
industry growth rate in 2014. They now represent 12% of 
total revenues in the division (2014: 10%). However, against 
the backdrop of a challenging market for print, total title 
sales were down 4% year on year to £29.7 million, and 
were down in each territory except India, which is still in its 
start-up phase. The print title sales decline was exacerbated 
by a higher level of returns following de-stocking decisions 
by some major distributors in the US. The growth in digital 
sales, together with strong rights sales in the UK, meant that 
the division’s revenues as a whole grew. Copyright licence 
revenues included two deals worth in excess of £1.5 million 
each. Licence revenue has above average margins. 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £5.1 million 
(2014*: £3.9 million) and included a £0.5 million one-off 
stock write-down in Fairchild Books.
Hart Publishing, which was acquired in September 2013, 
contributed £3.7 million of revenue (2014: £1.8 million) and 
£1.2 million of operating profit (2014: £0.5 million) before 
central recharges and excluding highlighted items.

Following back-to-back wins of the Bookseller Academic, 
Educational & Professional Publisher of the Year Award in 
2013 and 2014, the division was shortlisted again for this 
award in 2015. It is the first time that an academic publisher 
has won the award in two consecutive years. The division 
was also shortlisted for a third time in a row for the 2015 IPG 
Frankfurt Book Fair Academic Publisher of the Year and 
Ingram Digital Publisher of the Year. 
Bloomsbury Academic’s digital strategy reflects the 
changing needs of scholars, students and librarians. In 
September 2014 we successfully launched a new e-book 
platform, Bloomsbury Collections, which delivers unique 
online collections of scholarly e-books for the institutional 
market on a subscription and perpetual-access basis. 
54% of the orders to date have come from outside the UK, 
demonstrating the potential to grow international digital 
revenues. This new service will respond to the growing 
demand for e-books from academic libraries worldwide, 
offering them direct as an attractive alternative to e-book 
aggregators: smaller, subject-based collections at a 
lower cost per book, and a DRM-free, mobile-optimised 
interface designed around the content. It offers new 
opportunities for users which include scholars, students 
and researchers to discover more easily and make 
the most of the full wealth of Bloomsbury’s academic 
publishing portfolio. Already the site has approximately 
4,000 titles, bringing together innovative current research 
publications alongside more than a century’s worth of 
authoritative scholarship from the backlists of imprints such 
as Hart, T&T Clark, Bristol Classical Press, Continuum, Berg 
and the Arden Shakespeare. New collections in further 
subject areas will follow in future releases, and all newly 
published academic monographs will go directly on to the 
Bloomsbury Collections site in digital form.
In February 2015, Bloomsbury launched the instructor part 
of its major new platform www.bloomsburyfashioncentral.
com, which will cater for the needs of fashion educators, 
students and professionals. From July this year, more than 
140 Fairchild Books fashion textbooks will be available 
in a digital library subscription, for instant e-rental, or to 
purchase in digital or print, along with online materials 
to complement courses. This product sits alongside The 
Fashion Photography Archive, which will include over 
600,000 images, and the existing Berg Fashion Library. 
Fairchild Books continues to be the leader in higher 
education textbooks for Fashion and Interior Design. Its 
largest frontlist ever in 2014 included revisions of classic 
books such as Who’s Who in Fashion, Swatch Reference 
Guide for Fashion Fabrics, Textiles for Residential and 
Commercial Interiors, Design Management, The Layout Book, 
Shaping Interior Space, and new entries such as Design

Our partnership with Faber and Faber,  
www.dramaonlinelibrary.com, received a number of 
accolades in 2014: it was shortlisted for the IPG Digital 
Publishing Award 2014 and the Innovation Excellence 
Award from the Stationer’s Livery Company. It has also 
received “Highly Commended” at the ALPSP Awards for 
Publishing Innovation. 
Continuing the tradition of innovative partnerships, and 
venturing into multi-media, Drama Online announced 
300 titles coming from Nick Hern Publishing and an audio 
collection from LA Theatre Works. Further collections 
are being added in 2015 and 2016 to make this the pre-
eminent online worldwide collection for performing arts. 
These new collections will double the size of the resource.
In January 2015 we launched www.churchillcentral.com, 
the online offering for the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s 
death. The website is a hub that allows Churchill-related 
organisations to collaborate by contributing and sharing 
content that will extend the Churchill world. Making 
800,000 documents available digitally for the first time, 
the Churchill Archive stands as a digital library of modern 
international history. The Churchill Archive for Schools will 
be made available free for every secondary school in the 
UK, US and Canada from May 2015. 
To support the growth in digital subscription products, 
in 2014 we invested in a worldwide in-house institutional 
sales team. This allows us to maintain control of the 
sales, customer service, marketing functions and data. 
It also affords opportunities in the cross-selling of other 
Bloomsbury products. 
Bloomsbury Professional has 24 online services, with 191 
titles included, and a further seven services in development 
for 2015. Online revenues grew by over 30% year on year. 
The continuing growth in online services is reflected in the 
increase in documents viewed online from 475,000 in 2012 
to 1,400,000 in 2014. During 2014 Bloomsbury launched 
the first online services covering Scottish tax law. Our 
Financial Reporting and Irish online services both achieved 
100% renewal rates in the year. PricewaterhouseCoopers 
extended its contract with us to publish its Financial 
Reporting information in both print and online. 
Drama Online is a subscription service providing a resource for plays, 
critical analysis and performance featuring pre-eminent drama lists.
The Churchill Archive online has around one million pages accessible 
on demand to libraries worldwide. All secondary schools in the UK, USA 
and Canada are granted access to the entire archive.
Bloomsbury Professional presently has 24 online services

Adult 
Revenue for the year was £44.7 million (2014: £49.9 million). 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £3.0 
million (2014*: £5.1 million). Year on year comparisons are 
distorted by the huge success of And the Mountains Echoed 
by Khaled Hosseini in the prior year. His book sales this year 
continue strongly but naturally not at the same level.
We continue to develop our strategy of global publishing 
through the acquisition of global rights wherever possible. 
Many of our top-selling titles were successes in multiple 
markets, including Roz Chast’s Can’t We Talk About 
Something More Pleasant? which won three prizes in the 
US, James Runcie’s wonderful ‘Grantchester’ series being 
shown on both BBC in the UK and PBS in the US, Simon 
Singh’s The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets and 
Charles Spencer’s Killers of the King.
Whilst e-book sales are down year on year, also reflecting the 
success of Khaled Hosseini’s books last year, opportunities 
for growth continue in many territories and the advent of 
new devices and new business models such as subscriptions 
will continue to expand the market. We are beginning to see 
material sales in India, parts of Europe and the Far East.
Apart from Khaled Hosseini, our fiction offering was led by 
Lucie Whitehouse’s Before We Met, Samantha Shannon’s The 
Mime Order and continuing sales of The Bone Season, Daniel 
Handler’s We Are Pirates, Stella Rimington’s Liz Carlyle titles, 
Sheila Hancock’s Miss Carter’s War, Kamila Shamsie’s A God 
in Every Stone – which has been shortlisted for the Baileys 
Women’s Prize for Fiction 2015, Richard Ford’s Let Me Be 
Frank With You and Esther Freud’s Mr Mac and Me.
Non-fiction was dominated by our international chefs 
including Tom Kerridge, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, 
Heston Blumenthal, Raymond Blanc, Paul Hollywood, Ollie 
Dabbous, Atul Kochar, Russell Norman and Jason Atherton. 
This list is now complemented by the launch in March of 
the cookery subscription site, www.cooked.com. Absolute 
Press, one of our cookery imprints, was awarded Specialist 
Consumer Publisher of the Year 2014 at the Independent 
Publishing Guild Awards.
Literary prizes awarded to our adult titles in the year included 
the inaugural Folio Prize, awarded to Tenth of December by 
George Saunders, the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, awarded 
to The Sound of Things Falling by Juan Gabriel Vasquez 
(translated by Anne McLean) and a Windham-Campbell 
Prize for Fiction, awarded to Aminatta Forna.
Two of our paperbacks, And the Mountains Echoed by 
Khaled Hosseini and Before We Met by Lucie Whitehouse, 
were selected for the Richard & Judy Summer Book Club, 
with And the Mountains Echoed being chosen by readers as 
their favourite of all the titles.

We had bestsellers in Sod 70, Muir Gray’s guide to living well 
in later life, as well as two titles shortlisted for the William 
Hill Sports Book of the Year award – Alone by Bill Jones and 
Floodlights and Touchlines, an all-encompassing history 
of spectator sport. The acquisition in September 2014 of 
the highly respected Conway list of over 200 titles from 
maritime and military history is a wonderful complement 
to our nautical and military publishing, and The Cutty Sark 
and The Wipers Times, the facsimile trench newspaper from 
the First World War, are already making their mark. 
The launch of River Cottage Australia has boosted our sales 
and market position, confirming Bloomsbury Australia as a 
significant force there.
Bloomsbury India was delighted to continue the 
development of Shiv Khera’s self-improvement books and 
we sold nearly 200,000 copies in the year.
Our acquisition of Osprey in December 2014 increased 
our presence in niche special interest markets, including 
sport, natural history and cookery, as part of our strategy 
to reduce exposure to the traditional book trade. Its list 
is complementary to the existing Bloomsbury military 
and natural history lists. Osprey is the world’s best known 
military history brand, publishing trademark series in both 
print and e-book formats, titles with international appeal, 
covering history from ancient times to the modern day. 
The Military division is the largest part of Osprey with a 
significant subscriber database. British Wildlife Publishing 
publishes high quality books and the British Wildlife 
magazine for lovers of the natural world. Over 50% of 
Osprey’s revenue is generated outside the UK, principally 
in the US, thereby increasing Bloomsbury’s exposure to the 
global book market. 
Children’s & Educational 
Revenue for the year was £26.6 million (2014: £23.6 million). 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £2.9 million 
(2014*: £1.9 million). There was good revenue growth in 
each of our territories. 
The excellent result in this division reflects the success of our 
three-year strategy and has reshaped the team with focused 
commercial acquisition, targeted and strategic marketing, 
brand management together with the launch of a new 
imprint Bloomsbury Activity Books and the Bloomsbury 
Picture Books list. Our strategy is working and our pipeline 
of titles is strong. Our UK educational strategy is to support 
our publishing imprints with digital innovation for today’s 
teachers and curriculum. Our publishing is high quality and 
our ambition is to sell our authors’ and illustrators’ books 
to as wide an audience as possible, while ensuring children 
learn to read and develop a love of reading for pleasure.
Bloomsbury India continues to publish bestsellers.
The Conway list acquired by Bloomsbury has over 200 titles from 
maritime and military history.

Our sales of Harry Potter titles in the year grew by 29% due 
to the reissue of our Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling in 
August 2014, with striking new covers by Jonny Duddle. 
Other publishing highlights were Paper Towns by John 
Green, which was rejacketed in January and sold over 
150,000 copies, The Sleeper and the Spindle by Neil Gaiman 
and Chris Riddell, which was published with exceptionally 
beautiful artwork, The Imaginary by A. F. Harrold, illustrated 
by Emily Gravett and The Wall by William Sutcliffe, which was 
shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal with the judges calling it 
“an outstanding narrative adventure”. Paper Towns is due 
to be released as a film by 20th Century Fox in August 2015. 
Picture books and Activity books sales grew by 15% year on 
year and now account for 13% of the division’s sales. Stars 
on the Picture Book list were There’s a Lion in my Cornflakes 
by Michelle Robinson and Jim Field which won the 
Sainsbury’s Picture Book Award and Yasmeen Ismail’s Time 
for Bed Fred which won the V&A Book Illustration Award 
and was named a New York Times Best Illustrated Book. 
The education team launched its first subscription product, 
Music Express Online. It is a dynamic, visually appealing 
website that enables primary classroom teachers to teach 
the music curriculum even if they cannot read or play 
music themselves. Our objective is to see this product used 
in every primary school in the UK – whether purchased by 
individuals, schools or music hubs. It was shortlisted for the 
Future-book Award for Best Consumer Facing Website, 
the BETT award for Best Whole Course Curriculum Content 
award and the Educational Resource Award for Whole 
Curriculum Resource. 
Bloomsbury Spark, our digital first e-book list for the young 
adult market, celebrated its first anniversary. We have 
published 18 titles from a range of authors from debut to 
bestselling. Our Christmas e-novella Mistletoe and Mr Right 
by Lyra Payne will be the first title to move across into print.
Digital sales in the division moved from 4.9% of revenue 
in the UK last financial year to 4.5%, mainly reflecting the 
fact that sales of Harry Potter print titles made up a larger 
proportion of total sales and Bloomsbury does not sell 
Harry Potter e-books; and in the US digital sales moved 
from 16% to 14% of revenue mainly because the biggest 
selling title, I Love You Night and Day, was a picture book. 
The digital market for children’s titles is still predominantly 
led by young adult fiction.

Bloomsbury’s Music Express is the UK’s best selling and award winning 
primary classroom music resource.

Bloomsbury Information
The core activities of Bloomsbury Information are the 
development of IP-rich knowledge hubs in cooperation 
with external partners; the provision of publishing, 
management and consultancy services; and the 
publication of business, management, finance and 
reference titles in print and digital formats.
Revenue was flat year on year at £3.9 million with rights 
and services making up 90% of that total (2014: 89%). 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £1.1 million 
(2014*: £1.1 million). 
Bloomsbury content went live on the Lloyds Bank website 
aimed at their SME business customers during the year, 
following our three year content licence agreement 
concluded in the last financial year. Lloyds will continue 
to launch more Bloomsbury content during 2015 which 
will provide business thought leadership, insight and best 
practice to its business customers. 
Our management services agreement with Qatar 
Foundation has been extended on the same terms to 
December 2015, and the intention of the parties is to enter 
into a longer term renewal shortly. Both the book and 
journals sides of that operation performed well in the year. 
QScience.com, the Open Access journals publishing portal, 
grew strongly in the year with a joint marketing agreement 
reached with Nature Publishing Group. Titles published 
by Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing in the year 
included two English translations of novels which won the 
prestigious International Prize for Arabic Fiction, Throwing

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW
14
On the books list, The Methodological School of 
Management was shortlisted for the Chartered 
Management Institute Management Book of the Year 
Awards. We concluded a joint publishing agreement 
with the Ashridge Business School and the first book, 
Capitalism’s Toxic Assumptions by Eve Poole, was published 
in the year.
New content licensing agreements concluded during the 
year included an arrangement with Stephens Inc. in the US 
to provide business and financial content for their website. 
After the end of the licence term to the QFCA, QFinance 
content is now available at financepractitioner.com.
The market for which Bloomsbury Information supplies 
solutions remains complex, but the division continues 
to be well positioned to exploit digital, management 
and publishing services and other innovative business 
opportunities for the Group.
Outlook
Since the year end, trading has been good across all 
divisions, with the UK and US showing particular strength, 
with such titles as Celia Imrie’s Not Quite Nice, Children 
of the Stone by Sandy Tolan, the Harry Potter box set 
and the re-jacketed Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s 
Stone by J. K. Rowling. Bloomsbury’s excellent publishing 
programme for 2015/16 includes Sweet Caress by William 
Boyd, Big Magic by Elizabeth Gibert, The Heart Goes Last by 
Margaret Atwood, The Sunlit Night by Rebecca Dinerstein, 
the illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s 
Stone and new cookery titles from Tom Kerridge, Paul 
Hollywood, Frances Quinn, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall 
and Russell Norman among others. Books with TV tie-ins 
include Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke 
and the second Grantchester Mysteries novel, Sidney 
Chambers and the Perils of the Night by James Runcie.
Bloomsbury continues its strategy of growing academic, 
professional, special interest and educational revenues 
to reduce the overall exposure of the business to the 
traditional book market. During 2015/16 we will also 
continue our focus on digital publishing, launching the 
new online portals Bloomsbury Fashion Central and the 
Fashion Photography Archive.
We look forward to delivering continued success.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
2015/16 has a strong publishing pipeline of many new titles and 
editions with the potential to be bestsellers.
Not yet released, the fabulous illustrated edition of Harry Potter and 
the Philosopher’s Stone is in the pipeline for 2015/16.

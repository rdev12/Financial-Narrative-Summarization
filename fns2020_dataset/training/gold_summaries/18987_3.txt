Introduction
I am pleased to report a positive set of 
results for 2015 which are in line with the 
Board’s expectations. The core business 
performed particularly well with good 
growth from our broadband and mobile 
businesses.
Results
Revenue grew by 0.4% in the year to 
£79.6m and underlying EBITDA was 2.0% 
higher than the same period last year at 
£27.7m. Cash generation from operating 
activities was strong at £25.4m and we 
continue to make significant investment to 
support future growth.
Underlying profit before tax was 27.9% 
higher at £16.6m (2014: £12.9m). This was 
due to the higher level of EBITDA coupled 
with lower interest costs as a result of 
reduced debt and improved terms under 
the renegotiated debt facility. There was 
also lower depreciation due to mobile 
asset decommissioning in 2014. 
Underlying diluted earnings per share 
increased by 19.4% to 14.5p.

Trading performance
It has been a busy year operationally for the 
business, with the introduction of several 
new exciting products for our customers 
and the retention of key strategic customers 
for the Group. At the beginning of the year 
we launched a superfast broadband 
product, Ultima Plus, offering customers 
broadband with download speeds of up to 
80Mbps and upload speeds of 10Mbps, and 
this has been adopted by 26% of the Ultima 
customer base by the end of the year . We 
also launched our 4G pay as you go service, 
which provides speeds up to ten times 
faster than the previous 3G network service, 
and this has helped to drive an increase in 
our pre-paid data revenue by over 50% 
compared to last year .
In February 2015, we announced the 
renewal of a contract with our biggest 
customer, the Isle of Man Government, for 
mobile, local area network, wide area 
network, fixed line, internet and network 
services for five years. We announced in 
April that the Isle of Man Government 
would be the anchor tenant for Phase 1 
of our Greenhill Data Centre. In Q4 we 
completed Phase 2 at the Greenhill Data 
Centre, before welcoming an anchor 
tenant into the facility in October. Both 
facilities are now over 50% occupied and 
our focus is on continuing to attract 
further co-location and managed service 
business into our data centre portfolio.
As expected, Global Solutions 
experienced revenue headwinds at the 
start of 2015 as a result of a reduction in 
termination revenues. Following targeted 
investment into this area of the business 
and the implementation of specific 
initiatives, including additional resource, 
we saw an improvement in performance 
in the second half, with momentum 
continuing into the current financial year.
Our people
The solid performance during 2015 
is once again a testament to the 
excellent customer service that 
our experienced and professional 
workforce at Manx Telecom provides. 
During the period we wished our former 
Chief Executive Officer , Mike Dee, a happy 
retirement and welcomed Gary Lamb, our 
former Chief Financial Officer , following a 
thorough selection process, into the role of 
Chief Executive Officer . We have recently 
announced the appointment of Danny 
Bakhshi as Chief Financial Officer , who 
joined us on 1 February 2016. Danny has an 
excellent track record in the industry and 
will be a valuable addition to the Board.
On 12 May 2016 we announced that Sir Miles 
Walker , who has been a Non-Executive 
Director of Manx Telecom since 2001, initially 
as a director and then as Chairman of 
Manx Telecom Holdings Ltd and following 
our IPO as a Director of Manx Telecom plc, 
is to retire at our Annual General Meeting. 
We are pleased that after a selection 
process Christopher Hall, who was 
Managing Director of Manx Telecom Ltd 
until April 2011, has agreed to join us as 
an Independent Non-Executive Director , 
subject to his election at the Annual General 
Meeting. He brings strong local relations and 
a strong technological background.
Dividend
The Board has declared a full year 
dividend of 10.4p per share (2014: 9.9p), 
and intends to pay a final dividend of 
6.9p on 24 June 2016. The shares will 
trade ex-dividend on 26 May 2016 and 
will have a record date of 27 May 2016.
Outlook
We will continue to follow the dual 
strategy of strengthening our position 
in our core market on the Isle of Man 
through high quality customer service and 
value for money offerings, whilst looking 
for growth on and off island by exploiting 
our data centre capacity and leveraging 
our mobile technology platform.
The completion of Phase 2 at the Greenhill 
Data Centre provides additional capacity to 
the data centre business and we will focus 
on increasing occupancy by attracting new 
customers looking for a full-service offering.
We have seen a good start to the year  
in Global Solutions where we have 
continued to build a good pipeline of 
business, continuing the momentum  
seen throughout the second half of 2015. 
Steady performance during the period, 
combined with the solid start to trading 
this year, confirming our confidence in the 
Company’s prospects for the year. This, 
together with our outlook for continued 
strong cash generation, allows us to 
reiterate our progressive dividend policy.

We strengthened our 
business model…
Four years ago we began transforming BTG’s business. We focused
on investing in our development pipeline, we exited non-core
activities and we reduced our cost base. The acquisition of
Protherics in December 2008 has further strengthened our business.
We have added sales revenues to our royalties and gained 
new capabilities, including a polyclonal manufacturing platform. 
We have the opportunity to sell our own products and to become 
a successful specialty pharmaceuticals company.

…and created a strategy to
deliver sustainable profitability
To deliver sustainable profitability we are pursuing three medium-
term goals. The first is to establish US commercial operations to sell
products to specialist hospital-based physicians. These products
include our critical care products CroFab™ and DigiFab™, to which
we regain US marketing rights in 2010. Second, to maximise returns
on this investment we plan to acquire additional products to develop
and market to US hospital specialists. The third goal is to generate
additional revenues by building value in and commercialising our
current development pipeline.
Priorities
for 2009/10
Progress preparations for establishing a US hospital sales
force in preparation for selling CroFab™, DigiFab™ and 
additional products
Achieve planned development and manufacturing milestones 
within budget
Drive efﬁciencies and manage resources to achieve 2010/11
acquisition ﬁnancial targets of reducing G&A expenses and 
R&D expenses by £10m each

…and we are reducing costs
We are generating substantial cost savings and synergies following
the acquisition of Protherics. Savings have come from achieving
efficiencies in manufacturing operations, closing or merging 
a number of offices, and from eliminating duplicated functions. 
By 2010/11, we aim to reduce overhead costs by £10m. In addition,
we are targeting reducing R&D investment by £10m from 2010/11.

We are investing
in our own pipeline…
Our pipeline (see pages 26 and 27) is our engine for growth.
Currently, we have eight clinical programmes targeting cancer,
neurological and other disorders. We plan to take most of these
through studies to show safety and efficacy, then to seek partners
to complete development and commercialisation. Going forward,
we intend to add to our pipeline, with a focus on later-stage
programmes that we can sell through our planned US hospital 
sales force.
Replenish
In future, we intend to acquire programmes 
we can develop and potentially market ourselves
Commercialise
Most programmes in our current pipeline are 
out-licensing candidates. We will look for the right
partner for each programme as it approaches 
the appropriate milestone
Develop
Our development programmes are designed both
to establish early safety and efﬁcacy signals and
with the optimum regulatory pathway in mind
Acquire
We do not conduct basic research but instead 
in-license or acquire assets that meet strict 
technical and commercial criteria
7716 Report 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:08  Page 12 13/
BTG plc Annual Report 2009
…and will share in the success
of our partnered programmes
We have a strong partnered pipeline (see pages 28 and 29) and 
a track record in finding the right partners to take programmes
forward. We expect this pipeline to grow, as current internal pipeline
programmes are partnered. After this time, our partners are
responsible for completing development and commercialisation,
and we expect to receive milestone payments and a share of
royalties if the products successfully reach the market.

 Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2008

Introduction
Arden’s performance in the year to 31 October has been 
satisfactory, given weak markets. The FTSE All Share index 
was down 37% over the year while revenue in our equities 
division was down 12%. Arden completed twelve corporate 
finance transactions, despite the scarcity of finance available 
for deals. 
Financial Review
Revenue in the year ended 31 October 2008 was down 
by 32% to £11.4 million (2007: £16.8 million). Underlying 
profit before tax declined by 62% to £2.1 million (2007: £5.5 
million). Profit before tax — after share-based payments and 
one-off costs from adviser fees related to aborted bid talks 
— was down by 73% to £1.4 million (2007: £5.2 million). 
Cash generation was strong with balances up 20% to £9.5 
million (2007: £7.9 million). Net cash is some 430% of our 
£2.2 million regulatory capital requirements.
Underlying basic earnings per share (before aborted bid costs 
and share-based payments) fell to 5.9p from 15.5p with 
underlying diluted earnings per share down to 5.4p from 
14.4p. Basic earnings per share fell to 3.0p from 14.1p while 
diluted earnings per share declined to 2.7p from 13.1p.
Equities Division
Our equities business is proving to be very defensive with 
revenue down 12% to £6.5 million (2007: £7.4 million) 
against a decline of 37% in the FTSE All Share index over 
the same period. Since the year end, commission revenue has 
continued to be challenging, as negative sentiment magnified 
the usual seasonal decline in volumes
Corporate Finance
During the year we completed twelve corporate finance 
transactions including eight M&A and pre-IPO deals, two 
IPOs and two secondary fundraisings, raising £75 million for 
our clients, compared with £205 million in 2007. Corporate 
finance activity is weak compared with recent years. I believe, 
though, that corporate finance will drive any sustained 
recovery in the wider market and our strong team will seize 
the opportunities. 
Dividend
The Board is not proposing a final dividend for the year ended 
31 October 2008 (2007: 4.5p). Arden paid an interim dividend 
of 2.2p (2007: 2.2p) per ordinary share on 3 October 2008.
Outlook
We remain focussed on growing our business, by taking 
advantage of opportunities arising from the market downturn. 
Equities revenue remains challenging since the year end. The 
corporate finance pipeline is creditable, although as ever the 
timing of deals is uncertain.
The number of high-quality staff available to recruit continues 
to rise, and it is our intention to take full advantage of all 
opportunities arising from the market conditions.

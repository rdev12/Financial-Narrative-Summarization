 Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14

It has been another difficult year for 
retailers, due to the challenging economic 
environment which has affected several of 
the markets in which Kingfisher operates. 
In France, our biggest market, high levels 
of unemployment and higher taxes  
have led to consumer uncertainty, with 
customers opting to save more rather than 
spend more. In the UK, we saw a tough 
start to the year but an improvement as 
the year progressed, helped by falling 
unemployment and positive signs in the 
housing market. 
Despite this weak economic backdrop, 
Kingfisher was able to deliver some 
growth, with adjusted pre-tax profits 
increasing by 4.1% on the previous  
year to £744 million. We generated  
£559 million of free cash flow and 
strengthened our balance sheet, finishing 
the year with net cash of £238 million.  
As a result, the Board recommended  
an increase in the full year dividend of  
4.7%, making a total of 9.9p. I am also 
delighted to announce the start of a 
programme to return surplus capital to 
our shareholders, in addition to the annual 
dividend, the first such programme in 
Kingfisher’s 32-year history. 
Highlights of the year included another 
very strong performance from Screwfix  
in the UK, which continued to expand  
fast, opening its 300
th
 outlet during the 
year. B&Q had a more difficult year and 
so the B&Q management team was 
strengthened in order to better position 
the business for the opportunities that any 
improvement in the economy should 
provide. In France, Castorama grew its 
share of a market that was slightly down 
during the year, and we continued to 
expand the Brico Dépôt brand, with new 
stores in France and Spain, as well as  
the acquisition of 15 stores in Romania, 
Kingfisher’s first new market since 2006. 
We continued to make good progress  
with our strategic agenda, Creating the 
Leader, which aims to position Kingfisher 
as a clear leader in home improvement 
retailing. Many of the short-term benefits 
of this programme have been used to 
support our results in a weaker than 
anticipated economic environment, 
including improving prices for customers 
in our major markets of France, the UK 
and Poland.  
Further progress was made on our 
sustainability agenda through Kingfisher’s 
Net Positive plan, with achievements in 
responsibly sourced timber, energy usage 
and community projects. You can read 
more about these initiatives in the Chief 
Executive’s statement on page 5 and 
the Net Positive section on pages  
18 to 19.  
We are committed to diversity among our 
workforce and there is further information 
on our diversity policies and metrics on 
pages 18 to 19, 37 and 69.  
As always, I would like to thank our 
79,000 staff for their hard work during  
the year. In a people business such as 
retailing their contribution is vital, and  
it is through them that we can achieve 
Kingfisher’s purpose of helping our 
customers have better homes and  
better lives.

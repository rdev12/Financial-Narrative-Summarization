 Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 8
chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report another year of substantial progress in which we reported positive profitability after tax for the 
first time. This follows on from us reporting our maiden adjusted EBITDA profit last year. The strong results delivered by 
the Group for the year ended 31 March 2016 highlight the substantial organic growth we have achieved, coupled with 
the successful integration of two acquisitions. Both of these acquisitions have now been fully integrated and continue to 
perform well. 
The acquisition of Q4Ex Limited alongside the appointment of Chris Evans as CEO, in December 2014, was an important 
step in transitioning the business from our traditional SME Mass Market roots to one focused on Managed Hosting which is 
supported by longer term contracts and is consequently higher margin and more profitable.
Group revenues grew by 22% to £4.76m (2015: £3.91m). Growth was driven by our Managed Hosting division which 
increased revenues 36%, whilst the SME Mass Market division experienced steady revenue growth of 10%.  Managed 
Hosting now represents the majority of Group revenues. In the SME Mass Market business we have focused on 
efficiencies through cost reductions to drive profitability.
During the year the balance of the outstanding convertible loan notes has been repaid. Consequently at the year end the 
Group had a net cash position of £0.21m. The strengthening of our balance sheet alongside investment in our capabilities 
provides the Group with a good platform for future growth. 
Our dedicated staff have continued to work tirelessly and diligently to continue the growth in the business led by the 
example set by CEO Chris Evans and we believe this will ensure we can increase our growth in the coming year.

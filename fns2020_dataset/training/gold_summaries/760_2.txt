Advanced Solutions (including billing services)
Our solutions include cloud based services (public, private and 
hybrid), virtualisation, managed hosting, IP voice networks, 
unified communications, video collaboration, contact centre 
and multi-site connectivity, via a wide range of WAN services. 
Furthermore, we specialise in the provision of converged, 
resilient, high performance and secure IP networks that provide 
the essential foundations for the delivery of these collaborative 
systems. This includes all elements of the network, from branch 
to campus, to data centre, and are designed to deliver the 
appropriate levels of business continuity for each customer. 
We provide UCaaS (unified communications as a service), by 
bringing together our SIP and WAN connectivity with Mitel’s 
MiCloud solution suite. We also help customers take control 
of expenditure with a range of call management and billing 
solutions, including mobile order management and tariff 
bundling, tailored telecoms analysis, auditing, procurement 
cost allocation and expense management for leading telecoms 
service providers, resellers, systems integrators, consulting firms 
and corporate customers.
Mobile
Alternative offers an extensive range of mobile solutions, 
including smartphones, mobile email, data, security and 
tablet computing. We have commercial arrangements with 
Vodafone and O2, as well as strong relationships with all the 
major handset and tablet manufacturers. We complement our 
core mobile offering with Mobile Device Management (MDM) 
solutions, allowing customers to achieve the highest levels of 
security, governance and legislative compliance across estates 
of the most popular mobile operating platforms. VDI (virtual 
desktop infrastructure) adds a distinctive element to our mobile 
business proposition. 
Fixed Voice
Alternative provide a range of fixed line telephony services 
that allow customers to deliver business critical services and 
provide migration paths to services in the future. Our fixed 
voice partners include BT Openreach, Vodafone and Gamma. 
We provide migration paths to the services they will require 
in the future. We continue to successfully convert customers 
from traditional voice services, to VoIP (eg SIP). In providing 
well managed, low-overhead migrations to IP based voice 
services, we provide customers with greater flexibility, enhanced 
business continuity and the opportunity to right-size channel 
use to enable greater management of costs. Our SIP trunking 
proposition can be bundled with Mitel’s MiCloud cloud solution 
to create our UCaaS (unified communications as a service) 
proposition. Alongside our outbound voice portfolio, our 
inbound solutions, including non-geographic numbering (NGN) 
ranges, enhance our customers’ marketing and customer 
service operations through greater visibility, control and 
business continuity.
We offer a broad portfolio of IT technology and telecommunications managed 
services, including cloud based services, virtualisation, managed hosting, fixed 
voice, mobile, systems, IP networks and complex billing software solutions.  5

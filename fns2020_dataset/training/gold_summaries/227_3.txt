 2 Acertec plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
I am pleased to report our maiden results following Acertec’s
listing on AIM in May 2006.
Acertec’s excellent results in 2006 reﬂect underlying strength in
its two businesses, BRC and Stadco. Both businesses posted
increased operating proﬁts in the year, in Stadco’s case total
operating proﬁt from continuing operations, before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, improved by 67%.
Turnover from continuing operations increased by 16% to
£324.7 million (2005: £280.8 million) and total operating proﬁt
from continuing operations, before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items, increased by 30% to £16.2 million (2005:
£12.5 million). Group turnover , including discontinued operations,
fell to £331.7 million (2005: £368.9 million) whilst total operating
proﬁt (including discontinued operations, JVs and exceptional
items) increased substantially to £10.2 million (2005: loss of
£3.5 million).
The listing in May 2006, raised net new funds of £53.3 million.
This enabled a restructuring of our balance sheet with total
net debt reducing to £48.1 million at 31 December 2006 from
£118.5 million at 31 December 2005.
In April 2006 the Group sold its interests in Carrington Wire
Limited and Stadco Birmingham Pressings Limited. 
Whilst the competitive pressures faced by our businesses are
continuing, I have conﬁdence that Acertec will continue to
make good progress in 2007.
Finally, I have pleasure in conﬁrming that we propose the
payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 5p per share. Subject to
shareholders’ approval, this will be paid on 25 May 2007 to all
shareholders on the register on 27 April 2007.

 Laird PLC 1
Financial highlights
Explanatory notes:
 i)  Laird uses underlying results as key performance indicators.  Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share are stated before 
exceptional items, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the gain or loss 
on disposal of businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments, and acquisition transaction costs. The narrative 
that follows is based on underlying operating profit, profit before tax and earnings per share, as the directors believe that these provide 
a more consistent measure of operating performance.
*  The weighted average number of shares used to calculate basic earnings per share was 266.0 million in 2010 and 211.6 million in 2009, 
following the Rights Issue announced in October 2009.  
The Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010 contains the Directors’ report on pages 3 - 62.

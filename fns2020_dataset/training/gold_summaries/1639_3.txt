economic conditions.
Key financials
Revenue for the year amounted to £148.3 million 
(2009 – £164.0 million). The performance across all our 
regions was impacted by recent economic uncertainty 
and, as anticipated, this resulted in a reduction in new 
licence sales which was particularly pronounced in the 
Marine market in Asia. However, recurring revenue 
increased by 9% to £102.7 million (2009 – £94.2 million) 
and this, coupled with a fall in initial fees to £35.1 million 
(2009 – £57.7 million), has meant that recurring 
revenue as a proportion of total revenue increased 
to 69% (2009 – 57%).
Following the restructuring programme undertaken 
in the early part of the year, the Group has remained 
well positioned to respond to market conditions whilst 
maintaining the appropriate level of investment for the 
longer term. As part of the restructuring, the Group 
achieved annualised cost savings of approximately 
£5.0 million which helped to maintain solid operating 
margins that the Group has historically achieved. 
Operating margins were 33% for the year (2009 – 35%).
Adjusted profit before tax, amortisation, share-based 
payments, restructuring costs and fair value of forward 
foreign exchange contracts amounted to £50.7 million 
(2009 – £66.4 million). Adjusted basic earnings per share 
amounted to 50.92 pence (2009 – 69.99 pence), a decrease 
of 27%. Profit before tax amounted to £49.6 million 
(2009 – £59.2 million) and basic earnings per share 
were 49.36 pence (2009 – 62.27 pence).

AVEVA Group plc
Annual report 2010
Directors’ report
The Group’s balance sheet continued to strengthen 
during the period as the Group’s cash, including treasury 
deposits which comprise bank deposits with a maturity 
date of up to six months, increased by 19% to £149.7 million 
(2009 – £126.2 million), once again reflecting the strong 
conversion of profits into cash flow. 
Dividend
Following a number of years of high levels of profitability 
and cash generation the Board has reviewed the existing 
level of dividend payout and has decided to increase it 
from what it now considers to be a relatively low base. 
The Board is therefore recommending a final dividend 
of 13.9 pence (2009 – 6.5 pence). Combined with the 
interim dividend of 3.0 pence (2009 – 2.86 pence) this 
gives a full year dividend of 16.9 pence (2009 – 9.36 pence), 
an increase of 81%. The rebased dividend better reflects 
the established nature of our business and the strength 
and stability of our cash flows without impinging materially 
on our ability to continue to invest and grow the business.
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, 
the final dividend will be paid on 30 July 2010 to 
shareholders on the register on 25 June 2010.
People
Our people remain the principal foundation of our 
success and this continues to be one of our market 
differentiators. Our staff are highly skilled and dedicated 
to keeping the AVEVA brand synonymous with quality 
and delivery. The past twelve months have presented a 
number of challenges for the Group and its employees. 
The global economic slowdown and the subsequent 
restructuring programme created both business and 
personal challenges for many of our staff. Throughout 
this period our staff remained highly focused and 
professional and have contributed to our solid 
performance during the year, whilst building a strong 
base from which we can continue to both grow the business 
and maintain our first class reputation. On behalf of the 
Board I wish to thank all of our people for their hard 
work, commitment and contribution over this year to 
the success of the Group.
As announced earlier in May 2010, after eleven years 
of contribution to the Group, David Mann will retire from 
his role as Non-Executive Director of the Company at the 
Annual General Meeting in July of this year. I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank David for both his 
personal contribution and his help in developing the 
Group and the Board over his tenure.
I would also like to welcome Hervé Couturier who joined 
the Board in April 2010. Hervé’s experience, in particular 
at SAP AG, will no doubt prove invaluable as AVEVA continues 
to develop its products and solutions for the markets in 
which it operates.
Outlook
Despite the challenges of 2009, we have continued 
with the development of the business through product 
innovation and securing growth in new markets such as 
the CIS and Brazil. We see growth opportunities in each 
of our vertical end markets. 
The key drivers for growth remain in the Power and Oil 
and Gas markets where projects in new regions and more 
complex designs are likely to see new customer wins and 
the expansion of existing relationships. Although the 
traditional Marine market looks set to be slow for some 
time, emerging countries that are investing to develop 
local capacity afford some opportunities, as does 
offering new product functionality to existing customers. 
AVEVA NET remains a strong focus for the business as a 
growing customer base accepts the technology solution 
for managing the large volumes of data in both new 
build and brownfield assets. 
Ongoing investments in products and delivery capabilities 
across AVEVA’s entire portfolio will continue but added 
emphasis on AVEVA NET delivery capacity will help to 
accelerate our position within the market and capitalise 
on the growing opportunity.
The Group’s market leading technologies and a global 
sales infrastructure capable of benefiting from both 
improving global and local trends, mean that AVEVA 
remains well placed to continue to build on its success 
over recent years.

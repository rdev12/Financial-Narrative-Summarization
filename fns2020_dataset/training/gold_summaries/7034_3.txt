4 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2010
Chairman’s statement
In the year to 31 March 2010 operating profit was 15.2% 
lower at £19.5 million (2009: £23.0 million) with basic 
underlying earnings per share
1
 19.5% lower at 32.2p 
(2009: 40.0p). Statutory earnings per share decreased 
8.7% to 33.4p (2009: 36.6p).
The Group has maintained its track record of a high rate of 
profit to cash conversion with positive operating cash flow 
of £27.0 million (2009: £12.3 million) leading to a closing 
net funds balance of £72.3 million (2009: £55.5 million).
Order intake was significantly affected by weakness in a 
number of our end markets, falling by 44% to £99.0 million 
(2009: £177.6 million), resulting in a closing order book of 
£142.1 million at year end (2009: £260.4 million).
We are continuing to see the benefits of our margin 
improvement strategy. The commitment to margin 
performance through operational efficiency has enabled 
us to maintain operating margins at 9.1% despite lower 
revenues. We continue to pursue operational improvements 
and manage our cost base effectively and have reduced 
headcount by 17% since the start of 2009.
We have increased the pace of investment in expanding 
our technology portfolio through increased research and 
development expenditure and two strategic acquisitions 
during the year. As we move forward, the Group has a 
strong platform to drive growth through both organic 
development and value added acquisitions.
The installed base of Hamworthy equipment continues to 
grow and with a greater management focus on this part 
of the business this provides the basis for a resilient and 
growing aftersales business across all divisions.
“We have increased the pace  
of investment in expanding our 
technology portfolio. Despite  
short-term market uncertainties, 
the Group has a strong platform 
to drive long-term growth 
both organically and through 
value-added acquisitions.”

I am pleased to report on another strong set of trading results for Hamworthy, 
despite ongoing challenges in our markets. We have, however, maintained 
our operating margins on reduced revenue and once again remained highly 
cash generative. Company overview Business review Governance Accounts Additional information

Company overview Chairman’s statement
We expect the shipbuilding market to remain challenging 
for some time and it is difficult to predict when markets 
will improve. We therefore continue to focus on delivering 
earnings through both growth in adjacent markets and 
control of our cost base. We are developing our technology 
pipeline of new products through both organic and 
acquisitive investment. The Group has a strong balance 
sheet and a range of long-term growth opportunities and 
despite short-term market uncertainties, the board looks 
forward with confidence.
We therefore remain committed to our progressive dividend 
policy and your directors are recommending a final dividend 
of 5.97p which, if approved, would represent a 5.0% 
increase in the total dividend declared in respect of the year 
to 9.17p per share (2009: 8.73p). Subject to shareholders’ 
approval the final dividend will be paid on 22 July 2010 to 
all shareholders on the register on 18 June 2010. 
On behalf of the board I thank all of our employees for their 
contributions to another year of significant achievement. 
Our employees play a critical role in the Group’s success 
and we recognise that this will be particularly so in meeting 
the challenges ahead. We remain committed to recruiting, 
retaining and developing the best people.

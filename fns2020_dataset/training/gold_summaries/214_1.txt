acc Oya® w OOd and t ric Oya® w OOd 
elements
Manufactured through Accsys’ proprietary 
acetylation processes, Accoya® and 
Tricoya® wood elements exhibit superior 
dimensional stability, durability and other 
important benefits when compared with 
alternative natural, treated and modified 
woods as well as more resource intensive 
man-made materials.
The attributes of Accoya® make it a highly 
effective solution for a wide range of 
external applications including doors, 
windows, cladding, decking, shutters, 
louvers, civil works, landscaping, outdoor 
furniture and more.
The possibilities for the use of Tricoya® 
are ever expanding but include facade 
cladding, fascia and soffit panels and 
other secondary exterior applications, 
window components; wet interiors, 
including wall linings in swimming pools, 
bathrooms, wet rooms, changing rooms; 
speciality furniture including lockers, 
cubicles, chairs and tables, play frames, 
tree houses and exterior composite 
furniture; signage; automotive parts  
and sports equipment.
accO ya® sales
We have continued to make strong 
progress in achieving the dual aim of 
seeding the market and improving the 
profitability of the Group by increasing 
sales of Accoya® manufactured from  
our plant in Arnhem. Sales to Accoya® 
customers increased by 45% in the year 
to March 2013 compared to the previous 
chief executive’s r eport

financial year. This increase, to €16.4m 
(201 2: €1 1 .3m), excluded €0.2m sales to 
Medite for the manufacture of Tricoya, 
noting a substantial volume was sold to 
Medite in the second half of the previous 
financial year to enable them to build up 
initial stocks of Medite Tricoya. Sales to 
Medite have recently resumed as their 
initial stocks have become depleted.  
Total Accoya sales, including sales to 
Medite, increased by 22% to €16.6m 
(201 2: €1 3.6m)
12 out of 14 of our top geographies 
recorded an increase in Accoya® revenue, 
reflecting that we are increasing our sales 
through existing distributors as well as by 
the introduction of new distributors. We 
now have a total of 42 distribution and 
agency agreements in place, an increase 
of seven during the year, covering most  
of Europe, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, 
India, North America, New Zealand and 
parts of South-East Asia. 
Sales in the first quarter of the new 
financial year have continued to show 
very positive growth compared to the 
same period last year. While we remain 
optimistic concerning future growth 
prospects, it remains likely that such sales 
growth may be lumpy, reflecting that 
some new opportunities may be more 
significant than others.
arn Hem plant
The increased activity levels have 
resulted in our Arnhem plant operating 
at higher consistent production levels 
than before. Total manufacturing 
revenue increased by 23% to €18.3m 
(2012: €14.9m) with the resulting gross 
manufacturing margin increasing from a 
1% loss to a 15% profit (with total Group 
gross profit increased from almost break 
even to 18%). This improvement is 
attributable to improved economies of 
scale, noting some of the production 
costs are fixed or partially fixed in 
nature, together with other process 
improvements which are made on an 
ongoing basis. The manufacturing 
facility, which includes 65% of the 
Group’s headcount, recorded an EBITDA 
loss of €0.9m for the year, a 75% 
improvement on the previous year, 
despite still operating at less than 50% 
capacity. (The difference between 
€16.4m of sales to Accoya customers 
and €18.3m manufacturing revenue  
is attributable to sales to Medite and 
other revenue, primarily the sale of 
acetic acid, a bi-product from our 
manufacturing process.)
We continue to expect the Arnhem 
manufacturing facility to achieve an 
EBITDA positive level at 50% of its 
current capacity (i.e. approximately 
17,500m
3
) in the current year; a level 
which also indicates the potential 
returns a prospective licensee may  
be able to generate. 
Research and development has resulted 
in a number of improvements to the 
plant including improving reliability and 
reducing maintenance costs. Ongoing

In June 2012, Accsys entered into a 
licence agreement with Solvay for the 
production and sale of Accoya® wood. 
The licence provides for the grant of 
exclusive rights to Solvay for a 15 year 
period to produce and sell Accoya® 
within the Council of Europe, excluding 
Accsys’ existing ‘home’ markets of 
Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands and the United Kingdom, in 
return for Solvay paying Accsys licence 
and royalty fees and meeting other 
performance obligations. The 
agreement allows for the construction 
of multiple Accoya® production plants, 
with the first having an initial capacity 
of approximately 63,000m³ of annual 
Accoya® output, although remains 
conditional on certain limited provisions 
being satisfied, including the formal 
approval of Solvay’s board of directors, 
which is expected by the end of 2013. 08

KFC FAST FOOD OUTLETS LOOK FOR 
ACCOYA® WOOD, IN NEW ZEALAND
 
Supplied by Accsys’ distributor, Timspec 
in New Zealand, Accoya wood was 
specified and used for 2 new build KFC 
fast food restaurants in Auckland, New 
Zealand. These featured extensive 
Accoya cladding, additional vertical 
screening for the drive thru areas and 
horizontal louvre facades for shading the 
large windows from the sun. A further 
7 refurbishments have been undertaken 
throughout New Zealand and also 
feature extensive Accoya cladding.
Accoya was specified by Mortlock 
Architects because of its outstanding 
benefits including dimensionally stability, 
which means the cladding will not cup, 
bow or twist like other woods, and its 
class 1 durability properties which 
protect the wood from New Zealand’s 
changing weather and wet climate.

Since signing the agreement, significant 
progress has been made with Accsys 
having delivered a Process Specification 
Package and a Basic Process Design 
Package to Solvay. Work has been 
ongoing in respect of a full Process 
Design Package which will be delivered 
upon approval by the Solvay board later 
this year. These design packages enable 
Solvay to carry out the planning and 
engineering design required for them  
to be able to construct their plant.
The significant amount of work being 
undertaken by Accsys and Solvay  
also includes co-ordination between 
engineering teams, the completion  
of safety reviews required by local 
regulation and other operational 
planning matters such as wood 
handling, instrumentation and chemical 
recycling.
In addition, our respective sales teams 
have been working closely together to 
analyse and develop the market territories 
covered by their licence. This collaboration 
has included a recently launched Accoya® 
decking trial within retail stores in France 
and Germany in which a choice of a coated, 
ready to install product for consumers or  
a base coated version for contractors has 
been produced.
The situation with our other existing 
licensees in Asia and the Middle East, 
Diamond Wood and Al Rajhi has not 
improved with Diamond Wood still  
not having yet secured funding. We 
continue to work with Diamond Wood to 
develop the market in their territory and 
remain confident that in the longer term 
this region offers substantial 
opportunities for generating revenue. 
We have recently granted an exclusive 
right to market, sell and distribute 
Accoya® in Japan to a third party from 
the second half of 2014, upon which 
Diamond Wood’s licence rights in 
respect of Japan will cease. 
t ric Oya t ecHn Ol OGies l imited 
On 5 October 2012, Accsys entered  
into a 50:50 joint venture with INEOS 
Industries Holdings Limited (‘INEOS’) to 
exploit Accsys’ intellectual property 
surrounding its proprietary Tricoya® 
wood elements acetylation technology 
and processes, which is expected  
to lead to the accelerated global 
deployment of Tricoya. The new 
company, Tricoya Technologies Limited 
(‘TTL’), is now developing and exploiting 
Accsys’ Tricoya technology for use 
within MDF, particle board and wood 
plastic composites in a worldwide panel 
products market estimated to be worth 
more than €60 billion annually.
As part of the transaction, TTL was 
granted rights to exploit Accsys’ Tricoya® 
technology but will also benefit from the 
licencing of any intellectual property held 
by INEOS that may assist the joint venture 
in maximising the value of the Tricoya® 
proposition. 
Profits generated by TTL are to be 
shared between Accsys and INEOS in a 
way that reflects each party’s interest. 
The contribution of Accsys’ Tricoya® 
intellectual property to the Joint 
Venture will be reflected through a 
disproportionate future profit share 
which will create significant value for 
Accsys. This future profit share reflects 
that Accsys had made a significant 
investment in Tricoya® over a number of 
years prior to the formation of the joint 
venture. This included research and 
development expenditure concerning 
the Tricoya process and product design, 
the joint development agreement with 
Medite and the resulting product launch 
of Medite Tricoya Extreme Durable MDF 
in 201 1 together with significant 
investment in building the Tricoya brand 
and market.
TTL has already made progress and  
is working towards agreeing a full 
unconditional licence agreement with 
Medite for the manufacture of Tricoya® 
following the signing of a Heads of 
Terms in December 2012.
During the period, Medite has been 
continuing to sell Medite Tricoya 
manufactured using Accoya® purchased 
from Accsys’ plant in Arnhem. Unlike the 
new, continuous production acetylation 
process which is the subject of the 
expected licence between TTL and 
Medite, the method currently employed 
by Medite is not commercially viable in 
the longer term. However, this method 
is enabling Medite to seed the market 
ahead of the construction of their own 
plant, with Medite now successfully 
selling to distributors including in the 
UK, Ireland, Benelux and Germany, 
enabling the seeding of the market 
place for Medite and other potential 
licensees.
TTL continues to work closely with the 
licence option holder in Latin America, 
with ongoing activities concerning market 
evaluation and preliminary production 
planning in accordance with the 
agreement. 
f inancial s ummary 
Total revenue for the year ended 
31 March 2013 increased by 25% to 
€18.8m (2012: €15.0). In the same 
period, Accoya® revenue, excluding 
sales to Medite for the manufacture of 
Tricoya, increased by 45% to €16.4m 
(201 2: €1 1.3m). T otal revenue also 
included €0.6m of licence income which 
had been recorded in the first half of 
the year.
Gross operating margin for the Group 
improved from almost break-even to 
18% profit, resulting from increased 
Accoya® sales, the recording of licence 
income and improved operating 
efficiencies.
Other operating costs increased by 8% 
to €13.5m due in part to an increase  
in staff costs and to the relative 
weakening of the Euro, in particular in 
the first half of the financial year. The 
increase is also attributable to non-
recurring legal and intellectual property 
costs incurred in relation to the 
agreements made in the year. In 
addition, the group continued to invest 
in sales and marketing, which increased 
by 28% to €2.9m. 
However, other operating costs 
decreased by 13% to €6.3m in the 
second half of the financial year 
compared to the first half year costs  
of €7.2m. This reduction was partly 
attributable to the lack of the non-
recurring items described above, an 
improvement in the exchange rate  
in the second half of the year and to 
certain costs being recharged to TTL. 
The loss from operations decreased by 
31 % from €1 4.8m to €1 0.2m due to the 
improvement in gross margin described 
above and the impact of a charge recorded 
in the previous year for the impairment of 
licence related assets. Excluding the 
impairment charge, the loss from 
operations decreased by 19% from 
€1 2.5m to €1 0.2m. 10

MOUNTAIN NETWORK SELECTS 
DURABLE MEDITE® TRICOyA®
 
The ROC building in the Netherlands,  
which dates back to the early eighties,  
has undergone a complete renovation and 
expansion, focusing on an interior upgrade  
of the existing building. Constructed by 
Mountain Network, the prominent external 
climbing wall completes the renovation 
project, providing the most striking feature  
of the expansion. Making full use of the 
strength and environmental characteristics 
of Medite Tricoya, Mountain Network 
selected the FSC certified MDF for its 
strength and extreme durable characteristics.
Mountain Network, which not only builds 
climbing walls but also operates them, 
commented: “MDF would not normally  
be used outside and especially not for an 
application that, by its very nature, has  
to be very strong. However, we selected 
Medite Tricoya for this project due to its 
extreme durable characteristics compared 
to our traditional plywood material. 
Combined with its environmental 
properties this meant it was far superior to 
other potential materials. It can be cut, 
coloured, sanded, glued, machined and 
fastened as quickly, smoothly and easily as 
the highest quality standard MDF, offering 
us an ideal material to work with. With a 50 
year guarantee, backed by independent 
BBA testing, we are confident that the 
Medite Tricoya climbing wall and facade will 
last for years to come under the strain of 
use and the external weather conditions.”
Additionally Medite Tricoya, which offered 
an ideal cladding solution to the front of 
the college building, has provided a host of 
practical advantages compared to 
traditional cladding alternatives. Suitable 
for interior and exterior use, Medite Tricoya, 
which eliminates the need for heavy 
masonry outer walls, can be improved with 
flame retardants and surface coatings for 
an aesthetically enhanced finish.
Specifying Medite Tricoya provided a low 
carbon, cost effective alternative to other 
construction materials such as compact 
laminate, rockfibre and cement panels. 11
Accsys Technologies PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements year ended 31 March 2013
The decrease in cash balance to €20.5m 
as at 31 March 201 3 is the result of €7 .6m 
of cash out-flows from operating activities 
before changes in working capital, which 
represented a 24% decrease compared to 
the previous year. Further cash out-flows 
were attributable to a €1.4m increase in 
working capital, largely due to the increase 
in inventory balances as explained above 
and €0.9m expenditure in respect of 
capitalised development costs. The cash 
out-flow was offset by €4. 1 m received in 
respect of the issue of new shares and 
€1.7m arising from the completion of the 
second part of the sale and leaseback of 
the land in Arnhem. 
intellectual p r Operty
During the period we received 
confirmation from the Patent Office in 
New Zealand and Singapore of the grant 
of Accoya® product and process patent 
claims which successfully secure 
monopoly rights for Accoya® in those 
territories for 20 years from the patent 
application filing date. These granted 
patents are in addition to those recently 
obtained in the United Kingdom and 
South Africa, and further strengthens 
Accsys’ patent portfolio, securing 
protection for Accsys, its licensees  
and distributors across the globe. In 
addition, Accsys has recently received 
confirmation from various other Patent 
Offices, importantly including the 
United States of America, that various 
acetylated solid wood process patent 
claims will be granted, subject to 
payment of issuance fees . These 
additional grants will act to further 
strengthen Accsys’ patent portfolio  
in key global markets.
Accsys has continued to file new patent 
applications in the recent period and 
now currently owns six different 
Accoya® patent families, with 31 
patents granted or accepted for grant 
and 20 further applications filed across 
24 countries worldwide. 
In respect of Tricoya®, TTL now benefits 
from a further five published patent 
families with a total of 48 product and 
process patent applications filed in key 
territories across the world. 
Our principal brands, Accoya, Accsys, 
Tricoya and the Trimarque Device, 
including Arabic, Chinese and Japanese 
transliterations, are protected by 
trademark registration in 55 countries 
throughout the world with pending 
applications in a further two countries. 
These registrations and applications 
cover our corporate identity and the 
products we sell as well as those to be 
sold by our licensees and distributors.
Ot Her devel Opments
Accsys has invested a significant 
amount in developing and marketing  
our product brands. This has included 
working closely with our distributors 
and, where appropriate, their customers 
by producing, for example, co-branded 
websites and marketing collateral. We 
are expanding our successful Joinery 
Certification Programme; a free of 
charge education process involving a 
presentation with a Q&A session aimed 
at key production staff at the joiners’ 
premises. This has already proved very 
effective in driving end customer 
demand in the UK.
Research and development focuses  
on improvements to the plant and 
processes as described above. In 
addition, we have continued researching 
and developing a number of new species 
of wood to be acetylated. Following on 
from the introduction of Accoya® Alder 
last year, we have made progress in 
developing a number of other species. 
The ability to commercially acetylate 
species other than Radiata pine will 
enable Accsys to increase its product 
offering, with other species offering 
different characteristics allowing new 
applications as well as introducing 
alternative raw material sourcing 
options for Accsys and licensees, which 
has the potential to reduce input costs, 
particularly transportation costs. 
envir Onmental credentials
Accoya® and Tricoya® boast superior 
green credentials. By significantly 
enhancing the durability and dimensional 
stability of abundantly available certified 
wood, our products provide compelling 
environmental advantages over 
slow-growing hardwoods (which are 
often unsustainably sourced), woods 
treated with toxic chemicals, and 
non-renewable carbon-intensive 
materials such as plastics, metals 
and concrete. 
Recently, an updated analysis by leading 
climate change consultancy Verco, has 
shown that Accoya’s carbon footprint 
significantly outperforms most other 
building materials, including a wide 
range of sustainably sourced 
hardwoods. Further analysis by the 
Delft University of Technology following 
independent protocols revealed that 
Accoya® window frames are now 
classified as carbon negative over their 
lifetime cycle. Medite Tricoya® won 
Product of the Year at the Sustain 
Magazine Awards for Sustainability, 
Business and the Built Environment 
based on its combined innovation and 
sustainability.
As a result of these matters and our 
prior track record, we were pleased to 
recently be admitted as a founding 
member to the Social Stock Exchange, 
(http://www.socialstockexchange.com/
members/accsys-technologies).
Outl OOk
We are now beginning to see the 
benefits from our significant investment 
in sales and marketing over the last  
two years. This activity, together with 
the increase in the number of our 
distributors, leaves us well positioned to 
deliver continued Accoya® sales growth. 
We have recorded a strong start to the 
new financial year and, while our sales 
growth remains difficult to predict and 
is likely to remain lumpy, I am confident 
that our growth will enable us to 
achieve profitability; with the Arnhem 
plant achieving an EBITDA positive level 
in the current year and with the Group 
as a whole thereafter.
The progress we have made with 
developing the Solvay licence together 
with the advances TTL has made in a 
short period in respect of Tricoya®, 
allow me to remain confident that we 
will be able to extract significant value 
from our technologies in the longer 
term. In this respect we continue to 
develop a number of new and existing 
potential Accoya® and Tricoya® licence 
opportunities, with counterparties 
whose combined existing total wood 
product manufacturing or processing 
capacity is in excess of 10 million m
3
 per 
annum. While these discussions remain 
ongoing, the complex nature and 
investment required by a licensee, 
means that the timing and certainty  
of their completion remains difficult  
to predict.

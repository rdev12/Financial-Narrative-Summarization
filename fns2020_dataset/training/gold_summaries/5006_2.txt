The acquisition of SCA Packaging – an exceptional opportunity to accelerate our strategy
On 30 June 2012 DS Smith will acquire SCA Packaging
DS Smith announced the proposed acquisition of SCA Packaging 
on 17 January 2012. The acquisition will complete on 30 June 2012.
The transaction accelerates our strategy to become the leading supplier 
of recycled packaging for consumer goods. There are many compelling 
strategic beneﬁ ts to the deal, including:
1.  Geographic ﬁ t. We will be able to access new markets through 
an expanded network for corrugated packaging across Europe;
2.  Delivering more to our customers, who want a pan-European provider;
3.  Offering even more innovation as we combine the DS Smith research 
and development with that of SCA Packaging;
4.  Cost synergies from procurement and operating efﬁ ciencies 
of €75 million (by the end of the third full year of ownership); and
5.  Capex and working capital synergies of at least €40 million 
(by the end of the third full year of ownership).
The acquisition is expected to deliver a return on investment above our 
cost of capital in the ﬁ rst full year of ownership, with further improvement 
in the second and third years. Return on average capital employed is 
our key measure.
How we ﬁ t together
Following the acquisition of SCA Packaging, DS Smith will continue 
to have a similar balance of business as before, with a substantial 
recycling business and a smaller paper business, both supporting 
a strong corrugated packaging business.
Note: this pro-forma combines SCA Packaging volume metrics for the year ended 
31 December 2011 with those for DS Smith for the year ended 30 April 2012.

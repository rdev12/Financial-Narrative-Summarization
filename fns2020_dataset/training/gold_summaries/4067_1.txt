Q&A with Andrew Wyllie
Q
The Company is 
focused on Meeting 
National Needs... 
what does that mean?
A “Successful companies measure 
their value by their relevance to the 
external world. At Costain, we have 
identified the clear national priorities 
which are fundamental to ensuring 
the UK has a competitive future and 
an infrastructure which can support 
commerce and community alike. 
Whether it is solving transport 
congestion, avoiding an energy 
crisis, reducing the waste problem 
or supporting education, enterprise 
and employment, these are issues 
critical to generating economic growth 
and ensuring the nation’s future. 
“Costain has the technical skills, 
experience and commitment to play 
a significant role in providing solutions 
to meet these national needs. In recent 
years the Company has been at the 
forefront of developments in a number 
of areas including transport, nuclear 
decommissioning, water supply and 
developing skills needed for the future 
and we will continue to be so. Our 
customers have long-term investment 
programmes underpinned by strategic 
needs, regulatory commitments or 
essential maintenance requirements 
and they need high-quality service 
providers such as Costain.”
Q
Costain describes itself 
as an engineering solutions 
provider... but is that not 
a description which many 
companies could employ?
A “No it is not. We only focus on 
major blue-chip customers, and they 
are looking to work with fewer number 
of Tier One service providers, through 
longer-term, larger contracts 
incorporating a broader range of services 
across the life-cycle of their assets. 
To be an engineering solutions provider 
to these customers, it is essential that 
you are able to demonstrate that you 
have the necessary scale, experience 
and financial strength to be able 
to deliver a broad range of services 
through consulting, construction 
and operations and maintenance.”
Q
Costain states that it is 
‘Transforming’... but what 
is the evidence to support 
that in the last 12 months?
A “Costain is being transformed as we 
develop and grow our capability, both 
organically and by targeted acquisition. 
In 2011, we acquired two companies 
with precisely that aim in mind.
“In May 2011, we announced the 
acquisition of Aberdeen-based 
front-end engineering and operations 
support services provider ClerkMaxwell. 
This enabled Costain to offer customers 
full hydrocarbon value chain capability 
from upstream oil and gas, gas 
processing, LNG and gas storage, 
right through to downstream 
activities. ClerkMaxwell’s customer 
list includes such names as TOTAL, 
Chevron and ConocoPhillips and 
the acquisition was another important 
step for Costain into a vital market. 
Then in August 2011, we acquired 
Promanex, an industrial support 
services business which strengthened 
Costain’s presence in key growth 
target markets particularly in power, 
nuclear process, hydrocarbons 
and chemicals and water. 
“Over a quarter of our income secured 
for 2012 now comes from support 
service activity as we align our services 
with our customers’ requirements. 
Costain is now delivering the largest 
waste PFI project in Europe, the largest 
nuclear decommissioning project in the 
UK, and is the leading service provider 
to the Highways Agency.”
“Over a quarter of our 
income secured for 
2012 now comes from 
support service activity 
as we align our services 
with our customers’ 
requirements.” Q
Costain provides 
a service to customers 
but in your six-year tenure 
as CEO how has that 
‘service’ changed?
A “Over that time we have focused 
entirely on meeting the needs of the 
sophisticated major customers who 
have larger investment programmes. 
We have dispensed with one-off 
contracting relationships. We have 
moved away from customers and 
business opportunities where we 
cannot establish a competitive 
advantage. As a result of that focus 
we have lots of opportunities to grow 
the business. We have moved away 
from international construction activities 
where the risk was not commensurate 
with the return. Our customer base now 
includes some of the best known names 
in industry all with long-term specific 
needs. We have a wider skills base than 
before and we are capable of competing 
at new levels because we now have 
a stronger, more comprehensive 
service involving front-end engineering 
consultancy, construction and 
ongoing care and maintenance.”

skills base than 
before and we 
are capable of 
competing at new 
levels because 
we now have a 
stronger, more 
comprehensive 
service...”

Q
What makes 
Costain different 
from its competitors?
A “Our people, and our culture. 
We have some of the best people in the 
industry, and I am very proud of them. 
The evidence of their performance and 
achievements is reflected in the 90% 
repeat orders we receive from our 
customers. It is that premier level 
of performance coupled with the 
Company’s values and heritage which 
makes Costain unique. Our customers 
know that a Costain person possesses 
high levels of skill, integrity and 
commitment. It is precisely that 
combination which makes the 
Costain service special.”
Q
As CEO you have 
taken on responsibility 
for the Costain heritage 
and you also make 
continual reference to 
‘Transforming Costain’... 
are the two compatible?
A “Absolutely. The Costain reputation 
has been built on a long history of 
innovation, leadership and constantly 
adapting to changing requirements. 
Around the globe, people have 
witnessed Costain teams adapting 
to and overcoming difficult conditions 
and providing exactly what clients 
required. In the current age, we are 
continuing that philosophy by adapting 
and growing the Costain capability 
to meet the needs we all face now. 
As long as we continue to quickly 
drive innovation into our products, 
and enhance our service at a price 
point that customers are willing to pay, 
then we will continue to grow.”
Q
Do you expect the 
major changes in Costain 
in the next five years 
to be internally driven 
or externally driven?
A “Both. Our growth aspirations 
will be achieved through a combination 
of organic growth and by suitable 
acquisitions in line with strategy. This will 
allow us to accelerate the development 
of the Group, and is how we will broaden 
and improve the quality of earnings 
stream. Ultimately, it is the customers 
who place the orders, and therefore 
decide our destiny. With over 90% 
repeat orders in an increased order 
book, we have a good platform to take 
the business forward successfully over 
the next five years.”

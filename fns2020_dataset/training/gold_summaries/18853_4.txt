NEW STORE CONCEPT
During 2014 Jimmy Choo debuted a New Store Concept, developed 
with David Collins Studio and inspired by haute couture salons and 
fantasy shoe closets. This refreshes the look and feel of our stores, 
emphasises our luxury positioning and presents the fashion driven 
products in more space, while retaining the higher product densities 
in the Choo 24:7 collection. The new concept integrates the dual 
gender product portfolio, helping with penetration of the Men’s 
collection globally. 
NEW DOS GROWTH
During 2015 we opened 13 new DOS and converted three franchise 
stores in Singapore and Malaysia to DOS, taking the total DOS 
portfolio to 141 as at 31 December 2015.
Jimmy Choo continues to plan to open 10 to 15 new stores per year. 
This store opening programme is weighted towards China, where 
we remain underpenetrated relative to many larger luxury peers. 
This store opening rate allows us to capture the growth potential 
of the white space while ensuring the quality of execution maintains 
the Jimmy Choo luxury positioning and brand image. 
EXISTING DOS RENOVATION
Jimmy Choo plans to renovate 10 to 15 existing stores each year  
in the New Store Concept. This renovation programme is weighted 
towards the USA and Europe. The initial results are very positive and 
indicate that renovated stores in the New Store Concept outperform 
existing stores by a noticeable margin. During 2015, we refitted a  
total of 15 stores, with 30% of our portfolio in the new format at  
the year end.
FLAGSHIP PROGRAMME
Our planned ten flagship stores are designed to be a more full 
expression of the Jimmy Choo brand in key locations. The New Bond 
Street, Sloane Street, Beverly Hills and Harbour City Hong Kong 
flagship stores are already open with flagship stores planned for New 
York, Milan, Paris, Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing. The programme is 
expected to be completed by the end of 2017. The creation of these 
flagships will not entail increasing our number of DOS in any city, as 
it will be achieved by conversion and expansion of space in some 
existing stores and relocation to expanded space in other locations.

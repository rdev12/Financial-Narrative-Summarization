Chairman’s Statement
“2008 has been a year of 
significant change, both to 
our business model and to the 
macro-economic environment in 
which we compete.”
On behalf of the Board of 888 Holdings plc, I am pleased to 
present the financial results for the year ended 31 December
2008. This has been a year of significant change, both to our 
business model and to the macroeconomic environment in 
which we compete.
B2C
We grew our core B2C offering impressively in 2008, and
now offer all four key online gaming segments: Casino, 
Poker, Sportsbetting and Bingo. Our leading Casino 
business was again one of the main drivers for the Group’s
revenue growth and our online brand, 888Casino, had a very
successful year. It is now available in 19 different languages 
and underpinned 888 being awarded the prestigious 
eGaming Awards 2008 Casino Operator of the Year Award. 
Our Poker operation recorded a small decline in Total 
Revenue but expanded geographically with a new localised 
offering launched in 11 new languages in 2008, bringing it to
a total of 20 languages.
We have continued the successful consolidation of our
business away from a US market dominated Casino and 
Poker model to a more internationally diverse gaming 
entertainment business with a significantly expanded 
product offering. This now includes our market leading Bingo
offering, sports betting, ‘Live Dealer’ and backgammon and
importantly an integration infrastructure which opens up our 
platform to games from other vendors.
B2B
As part of a strategic move to expand our business model, 
we have continued the development of our B2B offering 
to become a leading provider of technology, operations 
and knowledge to business partners, using our existing 
capabilities. We believe there is a huge opportunity in this 
area especially as the operator environment is fragmented
and existing lottery operators are optimistic that online 
offerings will become a major future growth opportunity.
This development has required many technological and 
cultural changes in our organisation but we are now reaping 
the rewards and we have first mover advantage as a B2C 
operator ‘moving into’ B2B with a complete package of the 
services we can offer to our B2B customers.
Employees
I would like to thank all 888 employees, management and 
customers for making 2008 another record year, despite 
what developed into an extremely difficult economic 
environment in the latter part of the year.
Responsible Gaming
Responsible gaming is a fundamental pillar to our business. 
Our aim is to ensure our services are used responsibly.
During the year we have expanded our activities in this 
important area as more fully described in the Enhanced 
Business Review.
Financial Results
2008 was another year of strong growth for 888. Total 
Operating Income (“TOI”) increased 21% to US$263 million 
(2007: US$217 million) underpinned by 208% growth in our 
Emerging Offering to US$45 million (2007: US$14 million) 
and a 15% rise in TOI from Casino to US$139 million (2007: 
US$120 million). EBITDA* increased 23% to US$56 million 
(2007: US$46 million).
* Before share benefit charges of US$8.4 million (2007: 
US$7.8 million) and exchange rate losses of US$2.6 million 
(2007: gains of US$1.1 million).

Dividend
Given our strong financial results, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 2.9 cents per share
in addition to our interim dividend of 2.5 cents per 
share paid in October 2008.
Outlook
2008 has been a transformational year for 888 and 
we have made tremendous progress in uniquely 
challenging economic circumstances. We have 
become a world class B2B end-to-end gaming 
solution provider whilst maintaining and growing 
our position as one of the leading operators in the 
e-gaming world serving consumers globally under our 
own B2C brands. Our pipeline for 2009 is promising 
and your Board expects to continue our progress 
across all business parts for the foreseeable future.

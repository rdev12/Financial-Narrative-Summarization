Strategic Vision and Implementation
The strategic realignment of our business has resulted in  
us building a range of complementary marketing services 
capabilities and our exit from commoditised print markets. 
Whilst our Book business, Clays, continues to provide solutions 
focused on the needs of book publishers, our other businesses 
collaborate as required to provide marketing services across  
a number of sectors, including: Retail, Financial Services, 
FMCG, Leisure and Travel, Automotive, Charity and the  
Public Sector. 
The rise in consumer power is driving a fundamental change  
in the role of marketing which will impact across all of these 
markets. The shift from push marketing to conversational 
marketing based on understanding customer needs, and 
responding accordingly, is well under way and St Ives is 
ideally positioned to help our clients meet the challenges  
this presents.
Our consultancy services are set up to help our clients better 
understand their markets and customers, and to develop future 
strategies. We have the cross media capability to execute 
these strategies physically, digitally and socially using our Print 
and Marketing Services businesses, creating a unique and 
compelling combination of services in the market place.
For example:
 In Retail we see the combination of sophisticated customer 
insight and research driving specific in-store and online 
offerings that we fulfil for the UK’s largest brands.
 In Financial Services, the drive to create engaging and 
cost-effective customer connections has never been more 
important; at St Ives we help some of the largest retail banks 
deliver more targeted multi-channel campaigns whilst at the 
same time saving expenditure on printed materials.

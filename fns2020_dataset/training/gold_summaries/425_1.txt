Chief Executive’s Statement
“The 201 1 results reflect the growing maturity of our business, with record net profit of 
US$125 million, up 172% on 2010 and an increase of 2P reserves by 132% to 185 mmboe. 
We have a made a successful start to our multi-well exploration campaign for 2012 with 
a significant new discovery offshore Nigeria. We have a visible production trajectory 
to 100,000 boepd by 2017 and a mature capital structure that will internally fund both 
organic and inorganic opportunities.
Since the Company was listed in 2005, we have demonstrated strategic foresight and taken 
significant positions in Nigeria, East Africa and the Kurdistan region of Iraq, at a cost of entry 
highly accretive to our shareholders, coupled with a strong track record of operational delivery.”

Significant reserves growth
2011 was a defining year for Afren, and one 
of continued delivery and growth – a period 
in which we expanded our portfolio by three 
assets to 29 assets across 12 countries. In the 
process we increased our net 2P reserves by 
132% to 185 mmboe and at a cost of less 
than US$1/bbl – well within our targeted 
range of under US$4/bbl. Our production 
increased by 34% year-on-year to 19,154 
boepd, and, although a longer than expected 
period of facilities-related downtime at the 
Ebok field held back our average annual rate, 
we still exited the year ahead of target. 2011 
undoubtedly presented us with installation 
related challenges, while undertaking 
simultaneous operations, at the major Ebok 
field development. I therefore take great 
encouragement from the way we worked 
tirelessly as a team to overcome them, and 
still deliver the project in a fast-track timescale 
that few other operators would be able 
to match. 
Strong production performance
Afren’s highlight of 2011 was delivering first 
oil at the major Ebok field development 
offshore South East Nigeria, this important 
landmark being achieved in just over two 
years since the Company first started appraisal 
drilling at the field. At the same time, we have 
successfully maintained oil production at the 
Okoro field at levels well in excess of pre 
start-up expectations and also continued to 
manage mature production at our operations 
in Côte d’Ivoire, in line with expectations. 
The Company now has a commanding 
presence offshore South East Nigeria and is 
firmly positioned as a leading independent 
upstream operator in the region. 
Onshore Nigeria, First Hydrocarbon Nigeria 
(FHN) successfully completed the acquisition 
of OML 26 from the SPDC Joint Venture. We 
will realise the benefit of current and future 
production growth at OML 26 through our 
45% shareholding in FHN.
The combined performance of our producing 
assets in 2011 yielded full year average 
production of 19,154 boepd (compared to 
14,333 boepd in 2010). Taking into account 
the weighting of Ebok production in our 
portfolio, and the requirement in 2012 to 
manage simultaneous operations associated 
with the field’s ongoing development, we 
expect to produce between 42,000 boepd 
and 46,000 boepd in 2012. 
We have a pipeline of large scale development 
projects and multiple exploration and appraisal 
wells planned that we expect to bolster this 
inventory further, allowing us to continue 
to grow our production base into the 
foreseeable future.
Nigeria – our engine for growth
Nigeria has provided the opportunities for 
us to grow and establish Afren as a leading 
independent E&P company and as a partner 
of choice. Ultimately, it has also given us the 
track record and credentials that allowed us to 
expand across and beyond Africa. Simply put, 
Nigeria is our heartland and its attraction is 
clear. At a fundamental level, Nigeria is the 
most prolific oil and gas producing nation 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for around 
80% of proved oil and gas reserves discovered 
to date across the region. The sheer scale of 
the resource base and numerous partnership 
opportunities, coupled with our strong ties 
and Nigerian management, mean that we are 
firmly in Nigeria for the long-term. Furthermore, 
Afren’s key early priority was to establish 
a solid platform of cash generative reserves 
and production that would enable us to build 
and grow the business on a sustainable basis. 
Nigeria lends itself perfectly to the achievement 
of this objective. In particular, we had identified

Chief Executive’s Statement Continued
that there are a large number of discovered 
but undeveloped oil fields in Nigeria that have 
been licensed to indigenous operators or are 
peripheral within the Major IOCs’ portfolios, 
and that opportunities exist for an aligned 
partner to assist in the effective development 
and monetisation of these assets by providing 
access to capital and the necessary technical 
and operational capacity. 
We took our partnership model to the next 
level by establishing FHN, an indigenous 
company in which Afren holds a 45% interest 
and for whom we act as Technical Services 
Provider. In 2011 FHN completed the 
acquisition of a 45% interest in the major 
onshore Block OML 26 from the SPDC Joint 
Venture, crystallising a new and innovative 
dimension to our long-term growth plans in 
Nigeria. The completion of the transaction is 
further evidence that, as pressure mounts on 
the incumbent asset holders to optimise 
development of Nigeria’s national hydrocarbon 
resources and develop local capacity, a 
secondary asset acquisition and divestiture 
market is opening up in the country. The 
transaction is also a strong endorsement of the 
progressive role that independent E&Ps such as 
Afren can play in achieving this goal. 
I am proud to be able to say that we have now 
successfully delivered two high quality Nigerian 
development projects in Ebok and Okoro, and 
built a portfolio of six further development, 
appraisal and exploration projects. These will 
ensure we continue to organically grow our 
reserves and production base in Nigeria for 
many years to come. Furthermore, we are now 
in a better position than ever to capitalise on 
new partnership opportunities that may 
present themselves. These include those 
currently held in joint ventures between the 
Nigerian Government and Major IOCs, assets 
that could be connected to future indigenous 
licensing rounds, and assets of other Nigerian 
companies if appropriate. The future for us 
in Nigeria is bright.
Transferring our core skills with expansion 
into the Kurdistan region of Iraq
Our most significant strategic move in 201 1 
was undoubtedly our expansion into the 
Kurdistan region of Iraq. We are an 
entrepreneurial Company and take a long-term 
view of growing our business. We play to our 
strengths by leveraging our relationships and 
expertise to access new basins in areas where 
we can gain a strategically and competitively 
advantageous position – always willing to move 
ahead of the curve for the right opportunities. 
Afren is now the most active international 
independent E&P in Nigeria, and also in East 
Africa where we have assembled a highly 
attractive acreage position in some of the 
region’s most sought after play fairways. 
Thematically, the Kurdistan region of Iraq 
shares similarities with the Nigerian opportunity 
set. Although oil has been discovered in 
abundance and plays proven, the region has 
nevertheless been overlooked by, or remained 
out of reach for, much larger international 
companies. This has created a window of 
opportunity for smaller, agile independents to 
secure assets with world class potential. For us, 
it is a prime opportunity to transfer and deploy 
the fast track development and production 
capabilities that we have developed in Nigeria, 
and deliver a complementary additional 
production stream to the business. The 
acquisition is consistent with our strategic 
priorities and has delivered independently 
certified net 2P/2C resources of 868 mmbbls 
at US$0.68 per 2P/2C bbl – well below other 
regional transaction values during the year. 
2012 will see us focus on development of 
the major Barda Rash field, and progressive 
transitioning of 2C resources into 2P reserves 
and production. We have received all requisite 
approvals for the Field Development Plan 
associated with approximately 500 mmbbls 
of light oil at Barda Rash. There we plan to 
commence production this year from existing 
well stock and ultimately seek to deliver up to 
125,000 bopd over the medium term. We will 
also continue to explore the highly prospective 
Ain Sifni block as part of our broader 
exploration and appraisal drilling campaign.
Moving into our most active period 
of exploration drilling
We recognise that exploration is one of the 
most efficient ways of creating significant 
value, if done well and in a structured way. 
For us, first and foremost, exploration should 
be carried out on a sustainable and internally 
funded basis. Secondly, it is important to have 
a prospect inventory balanced across the risk 
spectrum that offers exposure to a variety 
of independent play types and geologies. 
We have therefore constructed our 
exploration portfolio around play-based 
themes with an emphasis on blending 
exposure across:
•  Low risk, quick to monetise opportunities 
in and around our core production and 
development areas in the Niger Delta and 
Kurdistan region of Iraq.
•  Moderate risk, proven play concepts that 
offer significant upside along the West 
Africa Transform Margin and other parts 
of the region.
•  Higher risk, play opening opportunities 
in the rift and coastal basins of East Africa.
We believe that technical maturity of an asset 
is key to unwinding risk and uncertainty, 
and we seek to use available technologies 
to minimise pre-drill risks and maximise our 
chances of a successful drilling outcome. 
We also look to actively manage our portfolio 
from a risk/reward perspective, and will 
consider farm in and farm out opportunities 
as appropriate. 2012 will see Afren participate 
in up to 14 exploration wells across our core 
areas, each of which has the potential to 
materially transform our discovered resource 
base. We were pleased to make a successful 
start to our campaign with the Okoro East 
exploration well, offshore Nigeria, and eagerly 
look forward to the outcome of our other 
current and planned wells throughout the 
remainder of the year.  Afren plc 29

External market and industry backdrop
2011 was a period of continued volatility in 
the markets, characterised by political tensions 
and unrest in North Africa and spreading 
across the Middle East, followed by the 
Eurozone crisis. Negative news from the 
Eurozone in particular depressed investor 
sentiment toward equities worldwide in 
the second half of the year, resulting in 
downward pressure on equity valuations. 
Against this backdrop, commodity prices 
strengthened over the course of 2011, with 
Brent Crude starting the year at US$95.3/bbl 
and exiting the year at US$106.6/bbl – 
an increase of 12%. Continued uncertainty 
in the Middle East has led to ongoing 
concerns over risks to near-term oil supply. 
These have, in turn, contributed to oil prices 
staying consistently above US$110/bbl in 2012 
year-to-date. We actively seek to manage our 
exposure to oil price volatility and continue to 
adopt an opportunistic approach to hedging. 
The US dollar strengthened against sterling 
in the first half of 2011, but weakened over 
the last few months of the year to give an 
average rate of US$/£1.604, with a change 
over the year of 0.3%.
In terms of the cost environment, the effects 
of inflation on discretionary capital and 
operating expenditure for Afren have been 
negligible on account of current price levels. 
Initial indications for the industry in 2012 
are encouraging, with a consensus indicating 
a supportive oil price environment and equity 
markets making positive ground in the first 
few months of the year. We recognise that 
the future will always hold a degree of risk 
and uncertainty. In this respect we are 
planning for a number of possible external 
scenarios, and will ensure that operational 
and financial flexibility is integral to Afren’s 
business to enable us to deliver 
maximum returns.
2012 to 2015 business targets
Having expanded the business significantly 
over the past three years, we feel it is 
important to set out our business targets 
for the next three years, in alignment with 
our strategic vision and objectives. Targets 
to 2015 are therefore to:
•  Continue to grow Afren’s presence in our 
core areas of activity and geological plays;
•  Progressively transition a significant portion 
of our existing 2C resource base into the 
2P reserves category;
•  Maintain valuation discipline by targeting 
2P/2C additions at a cost of under US$4/bbl;
•  Discover 250 mmboe of net recoverable 
2P/2C reserves and resources from our 
forward exploration drilling programme;
•  Deliver year-on-year production growth;
•  Manage and optimise our production and 
development operations to maximise the 
core value of the business;
•  Ensure that available capital is deployed in 
the most efficient way and in alignment with 
our full cycle business requirements; and
•  Continually improve CSR performance.
Outlook
We have made a strong start to 2012. 
Production has increased substantially as a 
result of ramp up at the Ebok field. We are 
making good progress in the Kurdistan region 
of Iraq, having moved into the development 
phase of the large Barda Rash field, and have 
already begun to see a positive production 
response to early optimisation measures at 
OML 26. Our appraisal activities will assist 
in maturing existing discoveries through the 
development approval process and we have 
made a successful start to our 2012 
exploration drilling campaign, which will 
see Afren participate in multiple high impact 
wells in a combination of proven and frontier 
basins. Underpinned by a strong financial 
platform and mature capital structure, 
we look forward to another year of 
significant achievement.

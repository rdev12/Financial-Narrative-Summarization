Operational Highlights
• Gold shipped was 52,616 ounces for the year ended August 2012
• Capital development more than doubled compared to last year. This increase is the 
result of continued investment in mine infrastructure, which will allow us access to 
high-grade ore bodies, such as the Cayzer / Prince
• Main underground capital development projects are on target:
– Decline Philip Shaft expected to hole into 20 level during the first quarter of 2013
– Decline to access Cayzer / Prince on target and we anticipate being able to mine 
from this orebody in March 2013.
Resource Development and Exploration
• Measured Mineral Resource base increased by 7% to 7.7 million tonnes at 6.2 grams 
of gold per tonne (1.5 million ounces)
• Completed Inferred Mineral Resource estimation at the Waikatakata surface deposit, 
5.1 million tonnes identified at 0.9 grams of gold per tonne (0.1 million ounces)
• Intersected three new high-grade mineralised structures at Vatukoula, subsequently 
named the Nielsen Deposit. Significant composite mineralised intersections include:
– 124.7 grams of gold per tonne over 0.46 metres;
– 33.60 grams of gold per tonne over 2.86 metres;

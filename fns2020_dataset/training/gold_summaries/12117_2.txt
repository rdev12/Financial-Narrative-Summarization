Operational Overview:
Financial performance: 
• Net debt reduced to lowest for seven years by 
combination of equity placing and improved working 
capital management
• Revenue and profitability adversely impacted by a 
previously announced supplier contract termination
• One-off non-cash charge of £33.1m for impairment 
of goodwill and intangible assets in respect of 
the Partner cash generating unit (31 March 2013: 
£68.1m impairment in Managed Services)
Operations now increasingly stable and 
important achievements secured across  
the Group:
• Managed Services returned to profitability
• CloudSure UK cloud platform launched, 
complementing significant existing hosting 
capabilities
• Several of our largest Business Continuity client 
mandates successfully renewed
Management and Board strengthened and 
funds raised to better position Phoenix  
for growth:
• Steve Vaughan appointed in March 2014 as 
Chief Executive, bringing 30 years of tech sector 
experience to the Group
• Robin Taylor appointed as a Non-Executive 
member of the Board
• Successful placing raised £8.3m net, accelerating 
debt reduction and enhancing Balance Sheet 
flexibility
• Final dividend reduced this year and dividend 
policy for future years to be more closely linked to 
business performance
Clear and focused three year strategy for 
Phoenix drawn up and being implemented:
• Focus on emerging opportunity to provide Cloud 
services to middle market customers in both 
Business Continuity and Managed Services 
segments
• Service lines and sales approach to focus on 
making Phoenix increasingly essential to its 
customers’ IT operations
• Scale and reach of the Group’s Partner segment 
will support these efforts

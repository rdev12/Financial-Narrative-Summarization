“I am pleased to report that 2006 has been another successful year for Charter. The Company has achieved excellent results with
operating profits having increased by 41 per cent to £143.2 million, pre tax profits by 40 per cent to £144.6 million and adjusted
earnings per share by 56 per cent to 67.2 pence per share.
The results achieved in 2006 show that both of Charter’s businesses, ESAB and Howden, have successfully built upon the
restructuring efforts of recent years and made the most of opportunities presented by strong markets. In doing so, both
businesses have achieved significant volume growth and improvements in operating margins. In 2006, ESAB’s and Howden’s
operating margins were 11.9 per cent (2005: 10.3 per cent) and 11.5 per cent (2005: 9.7 per cent) respectively.
The trading in ESAB and Howden in the first two months of 2007 has been encouraging and continues to benefit from
favourable market conditions. Demand for ESAB’s products generally remains strong in the key markets in which it operates,
and particularly so in emerging markets. For Howden, order intake in the first two months of the year has been strong,
especially from the power market in North America.
For these reasons, and in the light of the excellent results achieved in 2006, the Board views the trading prospects of the
Company and its businesses for 2007 with increasing confidence.”

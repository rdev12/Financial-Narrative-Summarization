02 Allergy Therapeutics plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Chairman’s Statement
This year Allergy Therapeutics celebrated its 
tenth birthday and it has been a remarkable 
year. The Company’s strategy is to build upon a 
strong core integrated pharmaceutical business 
and, through an extensive R&D programme, 
bring lasting relief to hayfever sufferers through 
the development of the ﬁ rst ultra-short course 
allergy vaccine, Pollinex Quattro. Great strides 
were made in implementing the strategy 
during the year, with two Phase III clinical trial 
successes. In May we announced the successful 
outcome of the ﬁ rst pivotal Phase III study of 
Pollinex Quattro against grass, Study G301, and 
as these accounts were being prepared we 
heard that the equivalent study in Ragweed 
allergy, R301, had also met its primary efﬁ cacy 
endpoint despite the curtailment of this study 
by the FDA clinical hold. Evidence of the 
efﬁ cacy of Pollinex Quattro is incontrovertible. 
Over the last ten years pursuing our strategy 
has involved the clinical development of 
Pollinex Quattro, an innovative vaccine against 
the often debilitating condition of allergic 
rhinitis and the ﬁ rst ever allergy treatment 
to contain a vaccine adjuvant, MPL
®
. The 
advantage of MPL is that the desensitising 
vaccine works after just four pre-seasonal 
injections, as compared with twenty or more 
injections with traditional immunotherapy. 
In a landmark result, our G301 study, 
undertaken in the United States, Canada and 
Western Europe and the ﬁ rst ever successfully 
conducted large-scale double blind placebo 
controlled trial in allergy vaccination to 
achieve its primary efﬁ cacy endpoint, 
provided a highly successful conclusion to 
these efforts. The outcome of this study is 
detailed elsewhere in this report. In summary, 
it proved that the product is safe and highly 
effective in treating patients’ hayfever. 
On the basis of this pivotal result, Allergy 
Therapeutics will make a submission for 
marketing authorisation in the European Union 
for Pollinex Quattro Grass. Already available 
in Europe on a ‘named patient’ basis, Pollinex 
Quattro Grass should become the ﬁ rst ultra-
short course allergy vaccine registered across 
Europe. The combination of solid scientiﬁ c 
evidence of efﬁ cacy, the associated plethora 
of clinical data, and marketing authorisations 
achieved utilising the most modern and 
demanding standards of clinical proof, will 
provide a strong foundation for the future 
sales and proﬁ t growth of the Company. 
Allergy Therapeutics has its own sales and 
marketing operations in ﬁ ve Western European 
countries – Germany, Italy, Spain, United 
Kingdom and Austria. As the registration of 
Pollinex Quattro approaches, our commercial 
teams have been preparing their sales and 
marketing infrastructures for the launch 
of this transformational new product. Led 
by Germany, the largest market in Europe 
for allergy vaccines and source of over 
70% of the Company’s revenues, this has 
involved a widespread modernisation and 
restructuring of our commercial operations.
In parallel, we have invested 10 million in 
our manufacturing facilities, human resources 
and the processes required to ensure and 
maintain the highest GMP-compliant standards. 
In essence, investment in the Company’s 
operational areas has increased as the 
considerable R&D costs have started to reduce. 
Allergy Therapeutics is now poised to capitalise 
on carefully laid and diligently executed plans.
In the United States, owing to the Food and 
Drug Administration (‘FDA’) clinical hold which 
is still in force whilst the FDA continues its 
“Great strides 
were made in 
implementing 
our strategy during 
the year, with two 
Phase III clinical 
trial successes”

its broad portfolio of development vaccines, 
has announced that it will resubmit 
Cervarix, which also has been caught up 
in the FDA’s general adjuvant review, with 
new efficacy data in the summer of 2009. 
Allergy Therapeutics feels that this may 
be the catalyst for the current uncertainty 
surrounding adjuvants, MPL and Pollinex 
Quattro to be resolved. Although the FDA’s 
clinical hold has been frustrating for everyone 
at Allergy Therapeutics there is now at least 
some positive light on the horizon. Allergy 
Therapeutics’ core European business remains 
strong and growing, funded by its existing bank 
facilities and the cash it increasingly generates. 
Despite this, there has been a steady erosion 
of the share price since the Company’s clinical 
programmes were put on ‘Clinical Hold’ by the 
FDA in July 2007. It was particularly frustrating 
for the Directors that the excellent G301 
results announced in May did not reverse 
this trend. However, as Allergy Therapeutics 
moves from the extended period of R&D and 
operational investment to a core-business 
focused operating company with growing sales 
generated by Pollinex Quattro, particularly 
once approved, its profit margins are expected 
to improve to the industry average, creating 
an attractive financial profile for investors.

How we’re doing
Chairman’s Statement
wider review of vaccine adjuvants, there is 
still uncertainty surrounding the progress of 
the Company’s ambitions. The strategy of the 
Company is to defer any further extensive 
R&D expenditure until the FDA hold is lifted 
and a partner is identified who can fund 
such future spending. The United States is 
the world’s largest market and remains a 
significant potential upside to the Company 
without further financial exposure. 
During the year Allergy Therapeutics has been 
active in seeking clarity and a way forward 
with the FDA; the most recent guidance 
suggests that the FDA plans to introduce  
a working group on adjuvants in the next  
six months. GlaxoSmithKline, which also  
uses MPL containing adjuvant systems in

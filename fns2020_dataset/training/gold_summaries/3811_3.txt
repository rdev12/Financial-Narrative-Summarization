 Chairman’s statement

“The progress that Computacenter is making
towards becoming a fully integrated infrastructure
services provider is clearly evident.”
4 Computacenter plc
Computacenter made excellent progress
in 2002. Against a background of
subdued markets for corporate IT
expenditure, the Group delivered good
profit growth, despite lower revenues. 
This result demonstrates Computacenter’s
effectiveness in controlling costs and
maintaining high levels of staff utilisation. 
It also reflects the considerable investment
in recent years to develop our services
capabilities, the fruits of which were clearly
evident in the course of the year.
The difficult trading conditions encountered
in the second quarter of 2001 persisted
throughout 2002, and Computacenter’s
revenues declined by 8.0% to £1.9 billion.
However, profit before tax, excluding 
non-operating exceptional items, grew to 
£54.2 million (2001: £51.1 million), and 
to £55.1 million (2001: £34.9 million)
including non-operating exceptional items.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding 
non-operating exceptional items, were
19.3p (2001: 17.9p).
The Group continued to generate 
cash, with net funds at the year-end 
of £83.4 million (2001: £53.3 million). 
In November, Computacenter repaid 
the outstanding balance of £38.3 million 
on the 1995 bond, and we now 
have no long-term borrowings. 
During the year Computacenter purchased
2,005,000 of its own shares for cancellation
at a total cost of £4.6 million.
I am pleased to recommend a doubling 
of the final dividend to 5.8p per share
(2001: 2.9p), at which level the dividend
cover would be 3.5 times. The Board recently
reviewed its dividend policy and concluded
that, given the strong cash position and
likely future cash generative characteristics
of Computacenter, such an increase was
warranted. Looking ahead, it would be the
Board’s intention to maintain dividend
cover at broadly this level. The dividend 
will be paid on 30 May 2003 to shareholders
on the register as at 2 May 2003.
Computacenter’s management deserves
considerable credit for the Group’s
performance in 2002. Overheads in 
the business were tightly controlled,
particularly in the UK where indirect
headcount was reduced by more than
230 over the course of the year. This 
was achieved without recourse to any
exceptional charges. The introduction 
of new systems and disciplines ensured
that professional services staff utilisation
levels were high throughout 2002.
For several years, the principal thrust of
Computacenter’s strategy has been to

develop the services side of the business
to complement the core product logistics
activities. We are now beginning to see
evidence of real progress here. In the 
UK, managed services and professional
services revenues grew by 16.4% and
13.0% respectively, and both activities
contributed significantly to the overall
financial performance. Unquestionably, 
the highlight of the year in managed
services was the award of the BT desktop
outsource, a five-year contract covering
over 100,000 seats which is understood
to be the largest desktop outsourcing
contract ever awarded in Europe. This is 
a major achievement for the Group, and
testifies to the expertise and credibility 
that we have developed in this area.
The progress that Computacenter is
making towards becoming a fully integrated
infrastructure services provider is clearly
evident. We continue to invest significantly
in services development, and in enhancing
our tool suite and technologies to support
the services offerings. A considerable
effort has also been made to upgrade the
skills and improve the processes within the
organisation to ensure consistent, effective
and profitable services delivery. As a result
of these developments, Computacenter 
in 2002 was able to undertake services
contracts of increasing scope and
complexity. With the demand for services,
particularly of an outsourcing nature,
forecast to remain strong, we remain
confident in our chosen strategy and 
our ability to implement it.
Computacenter’s performance in France
was somewhat disappointing. Although
revenues grew strongly by 20.7%,
operating profit declined to £2.4 million
(2001: £6.4 million) after the release of
negative goodwill, largely reflecting the
challenges of integrating the GE Capital 
IT Solutions (GECITS) business in France,
acquired in February 2002. We are making
good progress with the integration and,
looking ahead, we anticipate an improvement
in the profitability of Computacenter France.
In November, we announced the
proposed acquisition of GE CompuNet 
in Germany and GECITS Austria for a
consideration of £36.5 million, with a
further payment of up to £41.0 million 
in 2005 subject to the achievement of
certain profit performance targets. Both
transactions were completed in early
January 2003. These acquisitions, and
particularly that of GE CompuNet (now
renamed CC CompuNet), are of major
strategic significance to Computacenter.
We are now the market leader in the UK
and Germany, and number two in France,
an unrivalled position in the three largest
European economies. We see a growing
trend towards pan-Europeanism in the 
IT infrastructure market, particularly as
regards vendor behaviour and an increasing
harmonisation of market structures and
practices. Whilst a truly integrated pan-
European market is still some way off,
Computacenter is now extremely well
positioned to benefit from this trend. 
We are already beginning to exploit
opportunities to share best practices and
resources across our European network. 
Whilst it is too early to predict performance
in 2003, we believe that Computacenter is
well positioned to produce profit growth
over 2002.
Computacenter’s performance rests, as
always, on the efforts and capabilities of
our staff. A devotion to customer service 
is central to our success, and we are
fortunate to have an organisation of
employees who demonstrate this attribute
time and again. I offer my thanks to all
Computacenter staff for their enthusiasm,
commitment and hard work.

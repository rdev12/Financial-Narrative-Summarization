Leading  
Ahead
Over the past 12 months, Earthport has cemented its  
position as an innovative and unique solution for cross-border 
payments, signified by the signing of some of the largest and 
most sophisticated brands globally, significant engagement 
with central bank regulators, governments and industry 
influencers and expansion into the world’s largest growth 
markets where we see the potential for our model to flourish 
over the years to come. 
The continued investment we are making to secure our 
position in this highly specialised, highly regulated field, 
supported by our focused vision on the areas within which  
we operate, is clearly now beginning to pay dividends.
From this juncture, my conviction of the potential for 
Earthport to play a role at the centre of fundamental 
structural change for payments within the financial  
services industry has never been stronger.
  The opportunity identified remains the largest in the 
payments arena globally, and the need for a faster, 
cheaper, more transparent and compliant solution  
is great
  The solution we have is unique and barriers to adoption 
and scale are vast and complex 
  As we gain in momentum and recognition of our model 
increases, we must continue to do so through close 
consultation and collaboration with industry and 
regulators globally
  The pace of change and investment within the industry is 
great and Earthport has now developed the organisational 
leadership, capability and physical footprint to ensure 
that the organisation remains defensible and remains 
resilient and nimble in the face of potential competition
  Our focus on the enhancement of our core product 
capability continues to strengthen our value proposition, 
enabling our clients and partners to access new and 
innovative payment methods through a single 
connection with Earthport
Client Acquisition and Performance
In line with increased acceptance of the model, Earthport 
has seen a significant step change in new business  
activity with 22 clients going live and new clients being 
signed, including top global banks Standard Chartered,  
BBVA and Santander and 6 of the top 10 money transfer 
organisations globally. 
Earthport continues to focus on diversifying its client base. 
As testimony, Stripe, one of the fastest growing payments 
providers in the world recently signed an agreement with 
Earthport, further augmenting our position as a provider  
to the ecommerce segment. 
In addition to new business development, we continue  
to expand our engagement with existing clients such as  
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, providing the foundation  
for embedded financial performance in the coming years. 
Earthport continues to confirm our  
position as the leading cross-border 
payments network that safely and 
effectively delivers payment services 
across the globe in a unique and  
highly competitive manner. 5

This multi-faceted approach to commercial expansion continues  
to drive year-on-year revenue growth for Earthport with the 
attainment of positive cash flow in multiple months during 2015, 
indicative of the strength of our commercial proposition. 
Our revenues are derived mostly from transaction fees 
(approximately 84%) and professional services. As we expand, 
fees from transactions will continue to be the focus of our 
efforts to achieve the required benefits from scale as our 
model reaches its full potential. 
Investing for Growth
The achievement of positive cash flow in multiple months  
this fiscal year represented a pivotal point in our evolution, 
whilst at the same time we continue to engage with the  
sheer size of the opportunity. We strongly believe that now  
is the time to accelerate the pace of our investment in critical 
areas of the Company, such as infrastructure, geographic 
expansion, human capital and leadership, enabling us to  
fully capitalise on the growth opportunities being presented. 
To that end, Earthport’s recent acquisitions have enabled the 
Company to nimbly assume the core capabilities and capacity 
to scale and effectively achieve differentiation in the market. 
The acquisition of Baydonhill in late 2013 has now been 
successfully integrated into the Group, enabling significantly 
enhanced Foreign Exchange (FX) and Treasury Service 
capability. Furthermore, the purchase agreements Earthport 
made in 2014 for a minority stake in ASPOne, a provider of  
IT Development for Financial Services companies based in 
Istanbul, Turkey, continues to bear fruit as a means for us  
to bolster our operating platform and further enhance 
customer experience.
By far the most important investment made this year has  
been in our executive and senior leadership talent with  
the appointments of Daniel Marovitz as President of Europe,  
Mia Shernoff, Group Head of Marketing and most recently, 
Simon Adamiyatt, the Company Chief Financial Officer, all 
seasoned and highly accomplished professionals. Additional 
focus has been on acquiring new sales and client management 
leadership in strategically critical locations (Germany, Singapore 
and Dubai) and for high growth sectors (US Banking, ecommerce).
Network and Geographic Expansion
Over the last year, continued efforts to expand our international 
payments network, in line with client requirements, has resulted 
in the successful establishment of new network partnerships  
in several critical markets, including Pakistan, Jamaica and 
Barbados. As we strive to ensure business continuity and 
exceptional client experience across the network, focus has also 
remained on the development of resiliency across live countries. 
In support of this, the establishment of a physical presence in 
several regions including Miami to support Latin America and 
most recently, Singapore to support the broader Asia Pacific, 
has enabled us to strengthen relationships with bank partners 
from within the regions and quickly respond to opportunities  
to optimise our service and expand our partnerships.
These developments, supported by our existing operations  
in London, New York and Dubai and key alliances with 
organisations such as the International Finance Corporation 
(IFC), continue to provide Earthport with the strong global 
coverage and connections required to properly support 
expansion and maintenance of the network over the  
years to come. 
Strong Compliance Expertise  
In a segment marked by ever-increasing regulatory complexity, 
Earthport has invested significantly in the compliance expertise 
required to enable banks to meet the measures being 
implemented to oversee international transfers. The very 
nature of traditional open-loop (correspondent banking or 
wire) payment systems makes it extremely difficult for any 
institution to understand and easily disclose to the end-user 
when a payment will arrive, what the ‘in-flight’ charges are 
and how much the beneficiary will receive. Earthport’s 
capabilities enable our clients to address these needs. 
Earthport’s compliance capability is embedded in every client 
interaction and processed transaction. We apply a risk-based 
approach to the execution of compliance controls designed  
to ensure that the legislative and regulatory environment 
requirements are met. A comprehensive and detailed approach 
is utilised to further strengthen our counter-party’s own  
control regimes. We adopt a transparent partnership approach 
on an ongoing basis, including third party reviews, and  
audits as well as maintaining perpetual due diligence to 
monitor a client’s business activities. Transaction screening 
further augments the compliance processes. These effective  
controls manage our risk and ensure the safe growth of 
Earthport’s business.

Enhanced Client Service 
Delivering an unparalleled client experience is paramount  
to Earthport’s continued success and a focus on operational 
excellence to achieve this is at the forefront of priorities.  
As such, Earthport continues to expand service availability  
and transaction throughput to ensure the highest level of 
efficiency, accuracy and availability of our service. 
There are three core components that comprise our  
service operations:
  Client integrations – Earthport continues to enhance 
systems to enable simplified integration options for clients 
and bank partners to connect to Earthport’s network 
  Platform efficiency – As our volumes grow, continued focus 
is placed on developing the capacity to scale operations. 
These improvements enable Earthport to deliver better 
throughput results and timelines for payment delivery  
to meet clients’ Service Level Agreements 
  Professional service engagements – Given the size  
of our client’s organisations and the complex nature of  
their operations, most new business engagements begin 
with a consultative assessment and discovery phase to  
guide a successful implementation. We continue to grow  
the calibre of our resources and processes that enable us  
to expertly assume new client volumes
Strong, Industry-Leading Presence
Earthport remains highly visible among industry leaders  
and policy makers by partaking in steering committees, 
presentations at industry conferences and by hosting events  
and webinars alongside some of the world’s largest banks  
and technology innovators. 
In July, Earthport participated at a forum of Central Bankers 
from around the world at the invitation of the Bank for 
International Settlements in Basel. Increasingly, policy  
makers view Earthport’s model as a means to foster greater 
transparency and efficiency within established payment 
institutions. These opportunities continue to provide exposure 
for our thought leadership and represent acknowledgment  
of our solution.
Financial Review 
Total revenue for the year ended 30 June 2015 increased 78% 
to £19.27 million (FY 2014: £10.82 million). On a like-for-like 
basis, revenue grew by over 55%. The increase in underlying 
revenues has been driven primarily by payment transactions  
as existing clients increase activity and as new customers go 
live, as well as minimum revenue contracts and consulting 
engagements that generate professional services fees. 
Earthport achieved positive cash flow in multiple months 
during the second-half of 2015 fiscal year, before accelerating 
the pace of investments driven by the sheer size of opportunities 
ahead. Adjusted gross margin increased to 81% (FY 2014: 76%). 
Adjusted operating loss, before share-based payment charges 
of £3.29 million (FY 2014: £1.75 million) and unrealised fair 
value adjustment of £0.35 million arising on the year end 
translation of unsettled transactions (FY 2014: £2.27 million), 
decreased by approximately 22% to £5.01 million (FY 2014: 
£6.44 million). The operating loss was £7.96 million (FY 2014: 
£6.35 million). A charge of £0.73 million has been recognised 
for warrants granted to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (FY 2014: 
£0.32 million). The Group loss before taxation increased to 
£8.71 million (FY 2014: £6.33 million), including £0.80 million  
in relation to unwinding of discount on deferred consideration. 
Overall, loss after taxation increased to £8.69 million (FY 2014: 
£6.70 million).
Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2015 were £30.20 million 
(at 30 June 2014: £9.46 million). 
Net cash used in operating activities decreased to £2.90 million 
(FY 2014: £4.36 million). The continued decrease in net cash 
used in operating activities demonstrates that a turning point 
in cash used versus revenue growth has been reached.
Share Placing 
On 18 September 2014, Earthport announced the successful 
placement of 65,136,464 new ordinary shares at 40.85 pence 
per share with both new and existing institutional investors. 
The gross proceeds of £26.6 million ($43.43 million) have and 
will continue to enable accelerated geographic expansion in 
Asia and other geographies, investment in significant product 
opportunities, such as the recently announced distributed 
ledger solution, a first of its kind, and the ability to invest 
behind the growth and momentum achieved in North America 
and Europe.
Oppenheimer Funds Inc. of New York was the cornerstone 
investor in the round and held 8.62% (currently 10.20%) of the 
enlarged issued share capital of the Company at year end. The 
strengthened balance sheet adds significant comfort for clients 
and regulators around the world with the Group’s model and 
positioning. There are several revenue opportunities, such as 
US licencing and increased forward FX lines that will benefit 
from our stronger balance sheet, although not all will involve 
an actual increase in the use of cash. 
Key Performance Indicators
Earthport specialises in the large segment of low value 
cross-border payment disbursements. It is our vision  
to provide banks, money transfer organisations and other 
payment service providers with an improved way of servicing 
these payments through a single relationship, enabling them 
to serve their commercial and retail customer payments in  
a faster, cheaper and more transparent way.  7
Earthport plc 
Annual Report and Accounts Fiscal Year 2015
The indicators of our success involve four characteristics under 
which we operate: 
1. The incumbent process is antiquated, costly and  
prone to risk: the existing model is not fit for purpose  
and complexity increases as it proliferates at the expense  
of efficiency and regulatory compliance.
2. The market opportunity is significant: global trade and 
remittance flows exceed $21 trillion today with expectation 
of future growth.
3. The segment remains largely underserved: to date,  
the majority of attention, funding and new solutions have 
focused on the collections or retail side of payments, with 
acquirers, card networks and consumer applications thriving.
4. Our competitors are our clients: incumbants who are 
providing cross border disbursements and remittances  
are typically our clients focused on addressing a defined 
segment of the market. 
Furthermore, Earthport’s proposition is based on partnership  
and is disruptive without being in competition with existing 
players in the segment. Our focus is on creating solutions  
for incumbents to remove the inefficiencies in their model, 
enabling them to focus on new product innovation and  
retention of the customer relationship. 
To measure our success, the directors consider that the 
appropriate key performance indicators for the business are:
  Gross revenue 
  Gross margin
  Number of bank partnerships across the network
  Straight Through Processing (STP) ratio 
Employees
Earthport places considerable value in a diverse population  
of employees and their engagement as enablers of our 
performance.* To that end, within the bounds of commercial 
confidentiality as a matter of interest, information is shared 
with all levels of staff about matters that affect the progress  
of the Group.
Strategic Pillars
Consistent with Earthport’s strategic intent to be the largest 
global bank payment network, Earthport remains focused  
on the development of the five key pillars of our model. 
1. Platform
State-of-the-art platform, offering scale to manage millions of 
cross-border payment transactions complemented by versatile 
interface structures and formats ensuring Straight Through 
Processing (STP) rates of 99.5% plus.
2. Network
A network of 60+ countries with a target of over a 100 
countries where Earthport will deliver payments through  
an interface via the local clearing system.
3. Domain expertise
Domain expertise across all markets in the Earthport Network, 
providing automated access to one of the largest validation 
databases for payment formats, and an up-to-date knowledge 
base on payment systems across the world.
4. Compliance
A robust and fully integrated compliance process which ensures 
enhanced protection and risk mitigation to meet existing and 
evolving regulatory requirements.
5. Treasury services and evolving products 
Efficient Treasury Services offering liquidity management 
structures to optimise the journey of a payment in a wide 
range of currencies required by our clients, combined with  
new product innovations to capture evolving technologies  
such as, the distributed ledger/blockchain technology.
Proof points have now been achieved across each of these 
pillars, establishing Earthport’s foundation for expansion of  
its regional footprint and growing client base whilst enriching 
product suite and platform capability to cover emerging areas such 
as mobile payments, card/POS payments, collections, payment 
tracking and most recently, our distributed ledger offering. 
Outlook
Earthport enters the current financial year in an excellent 
position, with established relationships with some of the 
largest financial institutions in the world and a strong balance 
sheet. The current pipeline of opportunities is substantial 
within our core banking client market as well as in adjacent 
areas of the international payments ecosystem. 
Earthport’s product positioning, extensive market opportunity, 
acceptance with our existing clients and prospects, provides us 
with the confidence to increase our investment with a focus on 
accelerated growth over the coming years. 
We are entering a truly exciting phase in the evolution of  
the Company.

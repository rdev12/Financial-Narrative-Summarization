 HALMA
Chairman’s Statement
4 Halma p.l.c. 2005
The Group produced a profit before
tax* of £50.4 million, another record
profit for Halma – just.
The year was characterised by
significant change within the Group –
some of it visible, some less so. The
most visible change was the
appointment of Andrew Williams as
CEO at the end of February 2005,
having been appointed Deputy CEO in
December 2004. Andrew succeeded
Stephen O’Shea who reaches the
normal retirement age for Halma this
year, and on behalf of the Board I
should like to record our gratitude to
Stephen for all that he has contributed
to the Group during his career with us.
The succession process has gone
extremely smoothly and Andrew is
bringing a fresh impetus to our
operations – I encourage those of you
that can, to meet him at our AGM.
Last year I referred to a number of
factors that the Board and senior
management felt could possibly be
holding back our performance. Some
of them were issues that could be
quickly addressed e.g. incentives, span
of control; others were more long-term,
such as resource allocation and the
efficiency of our balance sheet. We are
continuing to upgrade the quality of
our management right across the
Group and particularly at subsidiary
board level.
All aspects of selling have received
particular attention and we are
disappointed not to see better
progress on the revenue line.
However, in common with many
sectors, we face continuing pressure
from price transparency via the
internet and deflationary trends
through lower manufacturing costs.
Our response is the continual re-design
and improvement of our products,
allowing more outsourcing and ‘off-
shore’ production as we re-double our
efforts on innovation. We are having
success but it is patchy, we need to do
more – faster.
In terms of our sectoral performance
(more detail is given in the Chief
Executive’s Review): Resistors
continued to have a difficult year and
the problems there are being tackled
“We are having success but it 
is patchy, we need to do more –
faster.”

Chairman’s Statement continued
Halma p.l.c. 2005 5
in new ways and with renewed
vigour. Water too had a tough year.
Other sectors held their own or
better.
Our two new acquisitions Diba
Industries, Inc. and Ocean Optics,
Inc. performed extremely well,
exceeding our expectations.
The results
Profit before tax* was a record
£50.4 million (previous year
£50.3 million) and earnings per
share* were slightly down at 9.42p
(previous year 9.44p). On a
statutory basis, profit before taxation
and earnings per share were
£44.9 million and 7.97p respectively.
These results were produced despite
adverse currency translation impacts
and raw material movements of the
order of £2.5 million. The return on
the capital* that our managers
control was a clear all time record
for a full year at 62% – a staggering
achievement, and return on total
invested capital* (including all
goodwill) was 13.1% – far exceeding
our cost of capital. Net cash at the
year end was £12 million. Turnover
edged ahead by 2% to £299 million
(previous year £293 million).
Excluding discontinued operations,
sales increased by 7%.
The Board recommend a final
dividend of 3.92 pence per share
giving an increase of 5% for the
year.
On behalf of the Board, I should like
to thank all our employees for their
dedication in producing this record
result, and also for their imagination
in continually improving our products
and service to our customers.
Prospects
We have strong market positions
and we are highly cash generative.
We are accelerating our own rate of
change – particularly on innovation.
Overall, despite little fundamental
help from our markets, we remain
cautiously optimistic for the year
ahead.

Chairman’s statement
This is the first set of full-year results under my
chairmanship and I am pleased that we have continued
the pattern that was established under Colin Busby’s
stewardship with yet another record level of turnover
and profit for the year to 30 June 2005, the 13th
successive year of profits growth.

Kier Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Pre-tax profits before exceptional items and
goodwill have increased by 24.3% on 2004;
construction awards were the highest ever
at £1,372m (2004: £931m) and, once
again, cash generation has been excellent
with £86.4m produced from operations. 
Financial performance
A strong performance was achieved 
in all the divisions. Turnover grew by 
9.8% to £1,621.4m (2004: £1,476.5m), 
operating profit after deducting goodwill
amortisation rose 25.4% to £53.4m 
(2004: £42.6m) and profit before tax 
(before exceptional profits) increased by
26.1% to £51.2m. The year-end net cash
balance was £58.1m (2004: £7.6m). 
Exceptional profits of £6.7m (2004: £nil)
comprise £2.1m arising on the sale of our
investment in the Neath Port Talbot Hospital
concession, £3.8m on the sale of a fixed
asset property and £0.8m arising on the 
sale of our remaining interest in Kier Hong
Kong. Tax of £1.8m has been charged on
the combined profit. In addition, whilst no
profit has been recognised, an exceptional
tax charge of £2.5m has arisen following
refinancing and subsequent £8.1m cash
extraction from the PFI investment vehicle
for Hairmyres Hospital. Basic earnings per
share, after all exceptional items, increased
by 31.0% to 106.8p (2004: 81.5p). 
Adjusted earnings per share before 
goodwill amortisation and exceptional 
items increased by 20.9% to 105.4p 
(2004: 87.2p).
The Board proposes a final dividend for the
year ended 30 June 2005 of 15.2p (2004:
13.0p) making 22.2p for the year (2004:
19.0p) an increase of 16.8% and covered
4.7 times by earnings per share before
goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items. The dividend will be paid on 
6 December 2005 to shareholders on the
register on 30 September 2005 and there
will be a scrip alternative.
Shareholders’ funds increased by £31.0m 
to £147.4m (2004: £116.4m). Pre-tax return
on shareholders’ funds was 43.9%, having
been sustained at around this level for the
last eight years.
International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS)
This is the last set of results reported upon
under UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice. The interim results to 31
December 2005 and those that follow will
be reported upon under IFRS. The results 
for the year to 30 June 2005 have also been
restated under IFRS and, together with 
the restated balance sheet at 30 June 2005 
and selective notes are disclosed on pages 
76 to 83. The key points relating to the
restatement are:
• The transition to IFRS has no impact on
business operations, cash, financing or
our ability to pay dividends;
• There is no impact on the profit
recognition policy for Construction or
Support Services and only minor impact
on profit recognition for Housebuilding
and Property; and
• The most significant effect of IFRS is in
accounting for pensions which reduces
stated net assets.
Appointments
I am pleased to announce that, with effect
from 1 October 2005, Ian Lawson, managing
director of Kier Support Services, and Paul
Sheffield, deputy managing director of 
Kier Regional, will be joining the Board. 
Ian returned to the Group five years ago 
as managing director of our Infrastructure
Investment business, having previously
worked for Kier International. He joined 
the Regional board in 2003 and the Support
Services board in 2004. Paul joined the
Group as a graduate engineer 22 years ago.
He has worked in the UK and overseas and
was appointed managing director of Kier
Construction in 2001, chairman of Kier 
Construction in 2003 and joined the
Regional board in 2004. I am looking
forward to working with Ian and Paul and
am confident that they will both contribute
strongly to the Board and to the future
direction of the Group.
Following the restructuring of the
Residential board we have appointed
Michael O’Farrell, previously managing
director of our subsidiary Allison Homes, 
as managing director of Kier Residential
reporting to the Kier Group Board through
the chief executive, John Dodds. With
Mick’s broad experience in housebuilding 
I am confident that he will make a
significant contribution to the future 
growth of the Residential business.
Prospects and markets
We enter the year with record levels of
work in hand in Construction and Support
Services and a satisfactory order book in
Homes. Our integrated business model
continues to provide competitive advantage.
I therefore anticipate further profitable
growth in the current year.

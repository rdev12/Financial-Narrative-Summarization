Financial and 
Operational Highlights
PTSG has developed quickly and sustainably 
through acquisition and organic growth. Turnover 
and adjusted* profit before tax were in line with 
market forecasts at £18.0m and £3.7m respectively. 
In 2014, we began the IPO process with the 
objective of floating on AIM in February 2015,  
a move that helped us to raise additional funds  
to support our ongoing strategic growth plans.  
The primary objective of PTSG’s ongoing strategic 
growth plan is to achieve a balance between 
financial security, return on equity and growth.

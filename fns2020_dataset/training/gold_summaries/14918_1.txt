 SThree plc 6
Overview
2009 was by any standards an 
extraordinary year and was without 
question one of the most difficult the 
Group has faced in its twenty three 
year history. The impact of the global 
crisis on demand for specialist staff 
was as tough, if not worse than the 
dot com crash – in itself a slow down 
of historical severity and certainly the 
sternest test the Group had faced up 
until that point. 
The slowdown evident in the UK 
and US by Q2 of 2008 was highly 
indicative that 2009 was likely to be 
a far more difficult market than the 
Group had to deal with in some years. 
Normal levels of expectation, either 
internal or external, had quite clearly 
been overtaken by external events.
Nonetheless the extent and rapidity of 
the further decline seen in the early 
part of 2009 was striking. In particular 
the Group’s international businesses, 
which had very largely showed 
remarkable robustness throughout 
2008, demonstrated that they were 
not immune to the impact of the 
global recession. For its part, the UK 
market demonstrated that although 
conditions were already bad, they 
had the capacity to get substantially 
worse. 
This then is the only context in which 
the Group’s 2009 performance can 
be judged. And if we bear in mind 
these unprecedented headwinds, 
it is pleasing to say that the 2009 
SThree results can be characterised 
as a very commendable outcome in 
exceptionally difficult circumstances. 
The fact that the Group adapted 
to the exceptional conditions with 
outstanding levels of grit and 
determination is what we would 
expect. The fact that we were also 
able to take further steps towards 
achieving our strategic goals gives 
a further perspective on what was 
achieved.
Financial outcome
Inevitably given the circumstances 
the Group saw a reduction in gross 
profit (GP). The 2009 GP figure of 
£171.2m was 21.8% down on the prior 
year (2008: £218.9m). This converted 
to a profit before tax (PBT) of £18.0m 
(2008: £56.0m) down 67.9% before 
exceptional items. Post exceptional 
items PBT was £8.9m (2008: £54.1m), 
down 83.5% on 2008. All exceptional 
items related to the restructuring 
exercise undertaken by the Group in 
Q2 2009.
During the year the Group continued 
to focus on maximising cash. At 
the end of 2009 net cash including 
term investments almost doubled 
to £48.5m (2008: £24.6m). 
Approximately £12.0m of the 
improvement was attributable to 
the unwinding of working capital 
associated with the reduction in 
contract runners. However, the net 
cash position also reflected strong 
cash management, with Days Sales 
Outstanding (DSO’s) improving to 37 
days (2008: 43 days).
The Group’s strong and improving 
cash position combined with a 
high degree of confidence in the 
fundamental robustness of the 
Group’s business model informed 
the decision to maintain the total 
2009 dividend at 12.0p (2008: 12.0p). 
Although uncovered by earnings, the 
Board took the view that this level 
of payment was prudent, being very 
comfortably covered by the level of 
cash available to the Group.
Notwithstanding the fact that the 
Group’s finances strengthened during 
the year and the Group is cash rich 
and debt free, steps were also taken 
to ensure that the Group retains 
maximum financial flexibility. A 
new 30 month banking facility was 
negotiated in October 2009, providing 
£20m of committed funds at highly 
competitive rates.   
Restructuring
By Q1 of 2009 it had become evident 
that compared to Q4 2008, the market 
had taken a further step downwards. 
As a result, Group headcount was 
out of line with market demand and 
the business was  running at an 
approximately break-even level.  It 
was clear that the Group needed 
to urgently address its cost base 
and restructure the business in line 
with a substantially reduced market 
opportunity.
As a consequence Group headcount 
was reduced by approximately 25%. 
In addition the Group closed four 
offices and consolidated a number of 
others, resulting in it exiting a total of 
eleven leases. T ogether these actions 
incurred a one off exceptional charge 
of £9.1m which paid back within the 
financial year. Most significantly 
the actions taken successfully 
recalibrated the Group’s overheads 
resulting in a commensurate and rapid 
return to profitability.  
Strategy
“High margin, high value”
Although 2009 offered no shortage 
of short term challenges and tactical 
difficulties, the Group did not lose 
sight of its medium/long term 
priorities. A notable example of the 
latter is the Group’s commitment to 
its “High margin, high value” model. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the 
market inevitably became more price 
sensitive during 2009, the Group 
successfully resisted any downward 
pricing pressure, which would

otherwise have impacted the quality 
of the business executed.
As a result, the Group’s overall 
contract margin actually improved 
to 22.1% (2008: 21.5%), a noteworthy 
result in the circumstances. In 
absolute terms the average gross 
profit per day rate (GPDR) increased 
to £84.69 (2008: £78.30). This 
represents an 8.1% year on year 
increase on an externally reported 
basis or a 1.4% improvement on a 
constant currency basis.
A similar theme was seen in the 
Group’s permanent business but with 
a still stronger value performance. The 
average permanent fee recorded in 
2009 was £11,930 (2008: £10,355) up 
15.2% on an unadjusted basis or 3.9% 
on a constant currency basis. 
Geographical Expansion 
The Group continued its successful 
strategy of geographical expansion, 
opening six international offices 
during the year. In addition to a further 
office in Frankfurt, new offices were 
rolled out in Düsseldorf, Hamburg, 
Stuttgart, Marseilles and Singapore. 
The strong German theme of 2009 
office openings reflected the relative 
robustness of demand in the German 
specialist staffing market during the 
year which showed 28% growth. 
However, it is equally indicative of 
the outstanding long term growth 
potential of what is currently a very 
underdeveloped market. 
The Group ended the year with a 
total of 46 offices in 11 countries. In 
aggregate Group GP generated from 
outside of the UK was £94.2m (2008: 
£97.4m). Although down 3.2%, this 
contrasts starkly with the 64.1% year 
on year growth achieved in 2008. 
Nonetheless the non UK businesses 
still performed substantially better 
than the UK. In the absence of any 
structural growth to mitigate the 
wider economic situation, UK GP 
of £76.9m was down 36.7% (2008: 
£121.6m) 
As a consequence of the significant 
difference in relative performance, 
the overall UK/non UK business mix 
underwent a marked change. During 
2009 the ratio was 55:45 in favour 
of non UK GP compared with 45:55 
in 2008. It is likely that this shift 
will prove permanent as the Group 
becomes ever more international. 
However, the fact remains that the UK 
has consistently showed itself to be 
capable of very robust growth in more 
typical market conditions.  
We remain convinced that a 
substantial opportunity exists to move 
the proven SThree model into an ever-
wider range of international markets.
In early 2010 the Group launched its 
second Australian office in Perth and 
opened additional offices in Munich 
and Düsseldorf. In the second half 
of the year we expect to open in 
San Francisco and Delhi. Additional 
international offices are in the pipeline 
subject to final approval and it is 
likely that the total for the year will be 
similar to the six that came on stream 
during 2009. 
Sector Diversification 
In parallel with its greater 
geographical diversity, in recent 
years the Group has made significant 
progress in developing a meaningful 
presence outside of its traditional 
Information, Communication and 
T echnology (‘ICT’ or ‘IT‘) franchise.  It 
is worth clarifying that this metric 
is measured by the skillsets of the 
candidates the Group places rather 
than the nature of the business of the 
client company. By the latter metric 
the Group has only a 21% exposure to 
the IT industry per se. 
The major non IT segments for the 
Group are Banking, Engineering, 
Finance and Accountancy, Oil & Gas 
and Pharmaceuticals; the Group also 
has a smaller presence in HR and 
Sales & Marketing. In aggregate these 
niches accounted for £48.5m of GP 
in 2009 (2008: £50.5m). Although 
this was modestly down by 3.8% on 
the prior year, the non IT franchises 
represented 28.4% of total Group GP 
compared to 23.1% in the previous 
year. The (generally more competitive) 
IT market performed less robustly 
with 2009 GP of £122.6m (2008: 
£168.5m) down 27.2%.
Although it showed definite signs 
of improvement in the latter part of 
2009, the Banking market remained, 
by normal standards, very subdued 
and when taking the year as a whole 
was weak. Given that historically the 
Group’s largest non IT sector has been 
Banking, the positive momentum seen 
more recently is an encouraging trend 
particularly given that the Group now 
has a presence in most of the world’s 
major financial centres.

Contract/Permanent Business 
Mix
It is an accepted feature of the 
specialist staffing market that 
temporary hiring tends to be more 
robust in a downturn. Therefore 
it is unsurprising that a shift in 
this direction that started in 2008 
continued throughout 2009. During 
the year the Group made a total 
of 6,060 permanent placements 
(2008: 10,236) a reduction of 40.8%. 
It is pleasing to reiterate that this 
significant decline in volume was not 
accompanied by a commensurate 
decline in quality, but an improvement 
in the average placement fee 
achieved.  
The number of contract runners at the 
end of 2009 was 4,157 (2008: 5,745) 
representing a reduction of 27.6%, 
illustrating the relatively better health 
of the temporary sector. As with the 
permanent market, the average value 
of each contractor improved. The net 
effect of the above was that contract 
GP represented 58% of the Group’s 
total in 2009 compared with 52% 
of GP for 2008. However, as market 
conditions improve and the recent 
trends favouring contract normalise, 
the Group’s permanent GP will 
once again become an increasingly 
significant part of the mix.  
Headcount 
The Group ended 2009 with a total of 
1,597 staff (2008: 2,274) a reduction 
of 29.8% on the prior year. Clearly 
the large part of this reduction was 
attributable to the rightsizing exercise 
undertaken in Q2 of 2009 which saw 
approximately 25% of the Group’s staff 
exit the business.
In 2008, normal natural attrition 
aided by the Group’s remuneration 
strategy was enough to ensure that 
the size of sales teams flexed in line 
with changes in market conditions. 
However, as discussed above, in the 
substantially worse market of early 
2009 it was agreed necessary to take 
a more proactive approach.
Following this exercise the Group’s 
approach was to broadly maintain 
the post-rightsizing staffing levels 
and little active hiring/replacement 
was undertaken until some signs 
of improvement in certain markets 
were detected later in the year. As 
a consequence of the latter the Q4 
headcount was up sequentially on 
Q3 and the Group is now selectively 
growing headcount where 
appropriate.
It is worth noting that one of the key 
strengths of the Group is significant 
flexibility in terms of headcount. 
Staffing levels can be reduced 
aggressively if needed but by the 
same token can be rebuilt almost 
equally quickly. Indeed the level of 
staff reduction seen in 2009 is not 
unprecedented, being comparable 
in percentage terms to the 2002/03 
downturn. As the market recovered 
the Group was able to rebuild its 
teams and took full advantage of the 
upturn.  
Outlook
The experience of 2009 clearly 
demonstrates the risk inherent in 
attempting to predict market trends. 
Although we began the last year with 
“our eyes open and mindful of the 
risks and challenges”, the market 
we actually faced was of an order of 
magnitude more difficult still. 
T owards the end of the year there 
were signs that certain markets were 
improving and that others were at 
the least stable and, so far, this has 
continued into 2010. Compared with 
what the Group has been used to in 
recent times, this was a welcome 
positive trend which was reflected 
in the Group’s return to headcount 
growth. Whilst there are indications 
that confidence is gradually returning 
to the market and this above all else 
is what is needed for a full recovery 
to gain traction, it remains true that in 
overall terms market conditions have 
yet to recover to anything close to 
normal.
Market conditions like those the 
Group faced in 2009 have a creative 
dimension. They force an in depth 
and uncompromising assessment of 
all aspects of the business. As a result 
changes are made, some of which are 
overdue and would be more difficult to 
envisage and execute in more benign 
times. Moreover, many individuals 
who have not previously been tested 
to the same degree mature as a result 
of their experiences. Given that the 
Group also has a broader geographical 
base and a more diverse range of 
sectors than ever before, we look 
forward to 2010 with a pragmatic but 
positive mindset.

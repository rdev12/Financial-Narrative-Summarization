 WALKER GREENBANK PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007  0
Overview
In last year’s Annual Report I began by describing 
the year to January 2006 as a landmark year in 
that we reported a full year operating profit for 
the first time since 2000, reflecting the success  
of our strategy of restoring the Group to 
profitability and of the strengthening trend in 
interior design towards the use of colour and 
pattern in wallpaper and fabrics. I am now very 
pleased to report another year of excellent 
progress in which our recovery has allowed us to 
enter a sustained growth phase. The momentum 
in our business is highlighted by a near three-fold 
increase in operating profits from continuing 
operations before exceptional items of £2,201,000 
in the year to 31 January 2007, compared with 
£758,000 in 2006.
Our financial year concluded with a significantly 
strengthened balance sheet, which benefited 
from a cash inflow from operating activities of 
£2,995,000 (2006: £1,643,000), a substantially 
reduced pension deficit and reduced debt. 
Our brands
Harlequin, Sanderson, Morris & Co. and Zoffany 
have made significant progress during the year. 
Harlequin, our mid-market brand, has delivered 
substantial year on year sales growth. The brand 
has gained market share from its competitors and 
more than doubled its operating profits for the 
second consecutive year, reflecting continued 
investment in new designs and a widening of  
the brand’s distribution. Growth in revenue at 
Sanderson is accelerating, following the significant 
investment in product and an increase in 
marketing this year. Our strategy of focusing the 
Zoffany brand on its core and traditional design

values is re-establishing the business as a leading 
brand at the premium end of the market. This  
has led to Zoffany’s first increase in sales after  
a number of years of under performance. As 
reported at the interim stage, results from  
our business in the United States have been 
disappointing, with underlying sales growing 
more slowly than anticipated. This led to a 
strengthening of the management team and  
we are confident of making progress in this 
important market.
Anstey, our wallpaper factory, and Standfast, our 
fabric printing factory, have made significant 
progress in the year. The strong return to 
popularity of wallpaper at the premium end of 
the market is now building in the mid-market and 
has helped Anstey deliver significant growth in 
both revenue and profits. Standfast continues  
to win market share and it has also achieved 
significant growth in both revenue and profits.
Financials
Turnover increased 10% to £53,327,000 from 
£48,392,000 and 15% from continuing operations. 
The operating profit from continuing operations 
increased nearly three-fold to £2,201,000 (2006: 
£758,000). The operating profit for the year was 
£3,477,000 (2006: £5,018,000). Both 2007 and 
2006 include the exceptional beneficial effect  
of the pension deficit reduction exercise. 
The profit before tax was £2,594,000 (2006: 
£2,625,000). The results include the exceptional 
profit from the pension deficit reduction exercise 
in 2007 of £1,276,000 (2006: £4,076,000) and the 
exceptional loss on the sale of Borge Holdings AS 
in 2006 of £1,281,000. The earnings per share for 
the year were 4.49p (2006: 4.51p).
Following the Group’s return to profitability and 
the successful outcome of the pension deficit 
reduction exercise, shareholders’ funds have 
increased 49% to £12,847,000 (2006: £8,597,000). 
The pension deficit has reduced to represent 30% 
of shareholders’ funds at the year end, compared 
with 93% a year ago. The pension deficit 
reduction exercise has been extremely successful 
with the pension deficit reducing directly by 
£1,562,000 in 2007 and £5,634,000 in 2006. As  
a direct result of the reduction in the pension 
deficit the profit and loss has benefited in 2007 
with other finance income of £81,000 compared 
with a finance charge of £174,000 in the prior year.
The Group’s net indebtedness finished the  
year at £8,604,000 (2006: £9,357,000). The cash 
inflow from operating activities was £2,995,000 
(2006: £1,643,000) after payments to pensioners 
and settlement of liabilities of £894,000  
(2006: £950,000) associated with the pension 
deficit reduction exercise.
Dividend
The Directors do not recommend the payment 
of a dividend, but remain conscious of returning 
to the dividend list as soon as is prudent.
People
I would like to thank all of our employees who 
have demonstrated tremendous commitment 
and enthusiasm and have been an important 
ingredient in delivering the excellent progress  
of the Group in the past year.
Outlook
Having established the Group as a profitable and 
cash generative business we now have a solid 
platform from which to take advantage of the  WALKER GREENBANK PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 WALKER GREENBANK PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007  opportunities that exist within a market that is 
benefiting from a major shift in interior fashion 
trends. Our brands, supported by our niche 
manufacturing, are well placed to exploit the 
move away from minimalism towards colour  
and design. Harlequin’s success in the past year 
underlines the growing strength of this trend and 
the organic growth opportunities that exist for 
the Group going forward.
With two months of our financial year now 
complete, we are trading ahead of our internal 
projections. The Board views the outcome for  
the current year with increasing confidence.

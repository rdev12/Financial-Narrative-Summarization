 Overview
Profit from continuing activities
before interest, exceptional costs,
goodwill amortisation and tax was
£1.49 million, which was ahead of
market expectations and well above
last years’ comparable profit of
£0.93 million.
The Group reduced net bank
borrowings by £6.6 million to 
£4.5 million with year end gearing
improving to 36%.
UK electronics turnover was down
by 15% and operating profits were
at about breakeven. This reflected
the continuing difficult conditions 
for UK based manufacturers as well
as the closure of a number of our
UK sites.
In sharp contrast, Stadium Asia
increased turnover by 45% and
operating profits increased eightfold.
This robust performance results
from strong organic growth in a
number of different sectors
including automotive and consumer
products.
A number of sites were closed in
the year and as a result the UK
electronics head count was reduced
by almost half to 275. Our UK
operations are well run and we are
fortunate to have a group of highly
skilled managers with considerable
experience who ensure that their
operations complement those of
Stadium Asia.
Disposals
During the year we completed the
disposals of Stadium Plastics and
Stadium Consumer Products,
bringing the total number of
disposals since the strategic review
to six, and aggregate proceeds
including deferred consideration to
over £13.7 million. The programme
has been completed ahead of our
schedule in terms of both time and
value achieved.
We also closed operations at Torvale
Building Products, realising a gain of
£903,000 on the sale of the freehold
site at Pembridge.
Two further surplus freehold sites
remain available for disposal during
2003, and we anticipate that the
gain arising on these sales will
outweigh any residual exceptional
costs resulting from the
reorganisation.
Board changes
I welcome Ken Leung, who is
Managing Director of Stadium Asia,
to the main board of directors. Ken
has a very strong team of senior
managers in both Hong Kong and in
the Peoples Republic of China who
are well placed to achieve strong
growth in future.
Tim Sale, Group Finance Director
until recently, has left the Company
to join a venture capital backed
company. I thank him for his
contribution and wish him well 
in his new career.
Finally, I welcome David Collins,
who has been in the company for
eighteen years, to the position of
Company Secretary.
Dividends
The Board recommends payment 
of a final dividend of 1.85 pence per
share, bringing the total for the year
to 2.8 pence (2001: 2.8 pence). The
final dividend will be paid on 5 May
2003 to shareholders on the register
on 4 April 2003.
Outlook
The benefits of real focus on our
electronics activity are now quite
apparent, and while we do not
anticipate any improvement in our
UK operations, we do expect
continued growth in Stadium Asia.
Our planned expansion by way of 
a new subsidiary to supply the fast
growing market in the Peoples
Republic of China will open a new
market for us.

When Kevin Hollinrake and John Waterhouse 
established Hunters in 1992, their vision was to 
develop the brand to become the largest estate 
agency group in the UK. 25 years later, they and 
their founding vision remain active within the 
Company and instrumental to its success.
Hunters grew organically, offering sales and 
lettings through 10 owned branches. 2005 
saw the beginning of a new phase with the 
development of its franchising expansion which, 
together with strategic acquisition, has seen the 
network grow to its current size. 
The services offered cover residential sales; 
lettings; buy-to-let and investment; residential 
block management; land and new homes; 
franchising and other property related services. 
Hunters has won more than 30 awards; 
maintained Investor in People certification for 
more than a decade; twice been voted Best UK 
Estate Agent by the Home Sale Network (now 
the Relocation Agent Network) and featured in 
the Sunday Times Best 100 Companies.

OVERVIEW
We are pleased to report that our first set of full year results as a public company 
were ahead of market expectations. Despite the changes to Stamp Duty Land Tax 
and uncertainties following the EU Referendum result, the Group continued its 
expansion towards becoming the nation’s favourite estate agent. 
In the year we added 30 new branches to the 
network, including 20 independent businesses, 
reaching 186 branches by the year end. The further 
15 due to the recent Bristol-based Besley Hill 
acquisition in March 2017 has now taken our network 
past the 200 mark. We continue to attract good 
quality independent businesses who see the benefits 
of a support network, reduced operating costs and 
opportunities to improve their income. Organically, 
we believe we are the fastest growing listed business 
in our sector having opened 93 branches over the 
last three years and a further 30 branches through 
acquisition in that period.
Gross revenue for the Group’s network (“Network 
Income”) reached £35.4 million in 2016 (2015:  
£30.2 million) a 17% increase on the previous year. 
Our average branch revenue rose by 7% to £190,000 
(2015: £178,000). This was a tremendous achievement 
against the background of national activity having 
reduced by 2% for the year
1
. Our adjusted EBITDA 
reached £2.06 million (2015: £1.57 million) an increase 
of 31% on the previous year. Adjusted EPS grew 25% 
to 5.92p (2015: 4.74p).
Our model is about both the number and the 
underlying performance of our branches. We 
invest a great deal of time and resource helping to 
improve each branch's revenue and our increase in 
revenue per branch reflects that investment, those 
improvements and then the underlying increased 
strength of the component parts of our network. 
This is not just a short-term success but a long-term 
strategy. Independent agents that converted to the 
Hunters brand for whom 2016 was their second 
full year as part of the network, have on average 
increased revenue per branch by 41%; illustrating 
that our well known national brand, quality and good 
reputation has delivered improved revenue for our 
network partners, as well as significantly reducing 
their cost of key operating costs, such as portal 
subscriptions, through our economies of scale and 
purchasing power.
Customer satisfaction is always a key measure and 
we improved from the half year, to June, to achieve 
a 96% customer satisfaction rating over the year as a 
whole for the 2nd year running. We have increased 
this score year-on-year since 2012 and it remains 
1  Source: Rightmove Market Activity Report, February 2017
significantly higher than the industry average of 73%
2
. 
Our business and our network partners commit 
within the network to deliver for our customers. This 
underpins our belief that business owners will work 
harder and deliver better results than a network of 
employees, self-employed operatives on short-term 
contracts or those engaged to simply list a home 
rather than actually selling or letting a property. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank everyone in 
the network who has worked so hard to deliver these 
excellent results and our customer service teams for 
working with our clients to help ‘get them there’.
CURRENT TRADING & OUTLOOK
Reports to date suggest that market activity levels 
are likely to be similar, or slightly lower than 2016
3
 
and we had reflected that in our own budget given 
the disproportionate timing effect of the Stamp 
Duty changes in the market in Q1 last year which 
caused an early year surge. We continue to see our 
numbers outperforming these market conditions 
with our instructions for the first two months up 
9% versus the same period last year. Indications are 
therefore that exchanges in the latter half of the year 
look promising. The Government's intention to ban 
lettings tenant fees was confirmed in the Housing 
White Paper, but we do not believe we will be 
significantly impacted given our franchise and sales 
bias and expect fair notice of any intended changes. 
We may benefit from such a ban in any event as 
independent agents seek the assistance of networks 
to grow replacement revenue. Our pipeline of 
new outlets remains healthy and I look forward to 
updating you as the year progresses.
DIVIDEND
The Company is committed to a progressive dividend 
policy and proposes an increased final dividend 
of 1.30p per share, making 1.90p for the year, an 
increase of 27%.

Combined 
Strength
in both sales and lettings
Senior management has considerable experience 
running both sales and lettings and we believe this 
puts the Group at the forefront for independent 
businesses looking to expand their business or 
develop additional revenue streams.

VYVANSE product sales grew strongly 
(+19%) in 2013 primarily as a result of 
price increases as well as higher 
prescription demand, due to growth 
in the US ADHD market (+6%) and 
VYVANSE’s share of that market.
Reported ELAPRASE sales growth 
(+10%) was driven by an increase in 
the number of patients on therapy. 
The increase in ELAPRASE sales 
between Q3 and Q4 of 2013 was 
partly driven by the timing of certain 
large orders from markets which 
order less frequently.
The growth in product sales for 
LIALDA/MEZAVANT (+32%) in 
2013 was primarily driven by higher 
market share in the US, the effects 
of which were partially offset by 
higher sales deductions in 2013 
as compared to 2012.

REPLAGAL sales were down 6% 
compared to 2012 (down 4% on a 
CER basis) as sales in 2013 were 
impacted by foreign exchange, pricing 
pressure (primarily in Europe) and 
slightly lower volumes due to the return 
of competition to the Fabry market. 
ADDERALL XR product sales 
decreased 12% in 2013 as a result 
of higher sales deductions, partially 
offset by the effect of higher stocking 
in 2013 compared to 2012.
Reported VPRIV sales growth of 
12% was driven by an increase in 
the number of patients on therapy.

INTUNIV product sales were up 16% 
compared to 2012, driven by growth 
in US prescription demand (up 9% 
compared to 2012), together with 
price increases. These positive factors 
were partially offset by higher sales 
deductions in 2013 compared to 2012.
PENTASA product sales were up 
6% as the benefit of price increases 
was partially offset by higher sales 
deductions in 2013 as compared 
to 2012.
FIRAZYR sales growth (+102% 
compared to 2012) was primarily 
driven by the US market, where we 
continue to see both good growth in 
new patients and increased levels of 
repeat usage by existing patients.

Business review  BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
I am pleased to report a year of strong 
progress, in which we started selling our  
own products in the US and expanded  
our product range through the acquisition  
of Biocompatibles.

Chairman’s statement
The financial results for the year reflect  
the achievement of key strategic objectives 
as we have continued to deliver on our 
growth strategy.
Results summary
Revenue of £111.4m (09/10: £98.5m) 
generated a gross profit of £77.3m (09/10: 
£65.7m). The loss before tax of £10.8m 
(09/10: profit of £9.1m) includes acquisition 
adjustments and reorganisation costs  
of £15.5m (09/10: £8.7m) and reflects  
the costs of the accelerated transition  
of marketing rights to CroFab® and DigiFab® 
from Nycomed US Inc. back to BTG and  
the Varisolve®(PEM) investment. A tax  
credit following the reorganisation of  
our US businesses resulted in a profit  
after tax of £9.2m (09/10: £11.3m).  
Cash and cash equivalents, together  
with cash on fixed term deposits, were 
£73.9m at 31 March 2011 (cash and  
cash equivalents of £82.6m at 1 April 
2010). The financial review on pages  
21 to 24 describes the results in detail.
Progress against strategy
We achieved the key operating goals we set 
for the year. Our first direct sales force, the 
acute care team, started selling CroFab® and 
DigiFab® in the US on 1 October 2010. This 
enables us to retain the full value of these 
products. We initiated three Phase III trials 
of our experimental treatment for varicose 
veins, PEM, between September and 
November 2010. Patient recruitment is 
complete in one and on track in the other 
two. We believe PEM has the potential to 
generate $250m–$500m per annum in 
sales in the US reimbursed sector. We 
expanded our range of marketed products 
and our development pipeline in line with  
our strategy through the acquisition of 
Biocompatibles in January 2011, adding  
a new growth component to BTG.
The Biocompatibles business is proving to 
be an excellent fit for BTG. Its products are 
used by specialists who can be served by a 
small sales force. Sales of the embolisation 
and drug-eluting bead products grew at 
approximately twice the market rate between 
2007 and 2009 and provide significant 
opportunities for further growth. We intend 
to market the embolisation beads directly  
in the US from 2012, leveraging our existing 
commercial infrastructure. The beads also 
give us access to important Asian markets, 
with reimbursement awaited in Korea and 
Taiwan and registration progressing in Japan 
and China. We have also gained access to 
early-stage programmes in the CellMed 
subsidiary that provide partnering 
opportunities. Integration of Biocompatibles 
is proceeding well and we have taken all the 
actions necessary to achieve the targeted 
£3m annualised synergies by the end of the 
2011/12 financial year.
Value creation continued in our partnered 
pipeline, with ZYTIGA™ (abiraterone acetate) 
being approved in the US as a treatment  
for men with advanced prostate cancer and 
AstraZeneca initiating a global Phase IIb 
study of AZD9773 (CytoFab™) in severe 
sepsis patients.
Board changes
Ian Much and Melanie Lee, CBE, joined  
the Board as non-executive directors in 
August and November 2010, respectively. 
William Jenkins retired from the Board in 
February 2011. On behalf of my fellow 
directors, I wish to thank William for his 
many contributions to the Company’s 
development since he was appointed  
as a non-executive director in 2002.

Dr John Brown Chairman
We are at an exciting stage in the 
development of our business. Having 
established our own US sales force and 
supporting operations, we will retain the  
full value of CroFab® and DigiFab®, and  
of any other products we develop or acquire 
that can be sold through the same team.
The acquisition of Biocompatibles has 
brought a range of marketed products in 
the growing field of interventional medicine, 
providing another specialist focus area for 
our business. In addition to increasing our 
sales revenues in the US, the Bead products, 
which address the needs of patients with 
liver cancer, provide a footprint in important 
Asian markets. 
With a clear strategy for expanding our 
business and a strong financial profile, we 
are well-positioned to deliver growth for our 
shareholders.
we can look forward to increasing  
revenue, gross profit and cash generation  
to fuel further growth of our business.  
To drive growth we will continue to invest  
in pipeline programmes including PEM,  
we will enhance our US commercial 
operations in preparation for commencing 
direct sales of the LC Bead™ and we will 
seek to acquire new products to expand our 
product portfolio and pipeline. I am confident 
that the investments we are making will be 
reflected in the future performance and 
value of the Group.

 Performance highlights
2015 results demonstrate decisive
early actions taken with focus on cash
Against a highly challenging environment,
Rio Tinto delivered a strong performance in
2015 with underlying earnings of
US$4.5 billion. The Group continued to take
decisive action to preserve cash through
further cost reductions, lower capital
expenditure and the release of working capital.
This focus on cash resulted in operating cash
flows of US$9.4 billion.
A net loss of US$0.9 billion reflected non-cash
exchange rate and derivative losses of
US$3.3 billion and impairment charges of
US$1.8 billion. The impairments mainly related
to the Simandou iron ore project, Energy
Resources of Australia (ERA) and the
Roughrider uranium project. In addition, the
Group recognised legacy remediation costs of
US$0.2 billion and general restructuring and
headcount reduction costs of US$0.3 billion.
In 2015, the Group returned US$6.1 billion to
shareholders, including the 2014 final dividend
of US$2.2 billion, the 2015 interim dividend of
US$1.9 billion and US$2.0 billion of share
buy-backs, comprising US$0.4 billion off-market
in Rio Tinto Limited and US$1.6 billion
on-market in Rio Tinto plc. Rio Tinto maintained
the full year dividend at 215 US cents per share.
The continued deterioration in the macro
environment has generated widespread market
uncertainty. The Group is embarking on a new
round of pro-active measures to cut operating
costs by a further US$1 billion in 2016 followed
by an additional goal of US$1 billion in 2017. It
is also reducing capital expenditure to
US$4 billion in 2016 and US$5 billion in 2017,
an overall reduction of US$3 billion compared
with previous guidance.
These significant actions provide Rio Tinto with
the confidence that it remains robustly
positioned to both maintain balance sheet
strength and deliver shareholder returns
through the cycle.

(1)
margin of 34 per cent, compared
with 39 per cent in 2014.

prices. This was in addition to the
US$1.5 billion inflow in 2014.

US$3.5 billion to US$4.7 billion, including

 Dialog Semiconductor Plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | Section 1 | Overview 06
2011 HAS BEEN ANOTHER GOOD YEAR FOR 
DIALOG SEMICONDUCTOR PLC, WITH REVENUE 
UP 78% YEAR-ON-YEAR TO US$527 MILLION 
AND THE SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION OF 
SITEL SEMICONDUCTOR BV.
The Company continues its strategy of deeper 
and broader relationships with existing customers 
(more complex solutions sold into new and existing 
applications) whilst at the same time increasing the 
number of new customers. The SiTel acquisition has 
undoubtedly helped the Company bring on board 
new significant customers such as Microsoft, Gigaset 
and Plantronics.
I believe the Company is firmly on the way to 
achieving the goal of US$1 billion plus annual 
revenues. The Company continues to work towards 
ensuring it has the necessary infrastructure to support 
a US$1 billion turnover business with global reach, 
whilst at the same time maintaining best industry 
metrics not only in terms of quality control but also 
financially, where profitability has to be carefully 
managed, given the competing pressures of the 
price expectation of volume customers and 
supply constraints.
As last year, despite the troubled economic 
environment, I remain confident about the future 
growth prospects of the Company in 2012 and 
thank you for your continued support.

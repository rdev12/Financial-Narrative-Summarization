 02 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Another important strand of our 
strategy is our commitment to 
investing in our businesses to build 
upon our innovative and market 
leading offering. Our approach 
is client-led and we have proven 
success in supporting and enabling 
expansion, and have helped 
our businesses move into new 
growth markets where client-led 
opportunities exist in North America, 
China and Singapore, as well as 
adding to our headquarters in 
London.
When we meet a potential 
acquisition target, our interest is 
driven by the services it delivers  
and by its growth potential but also, 
very importantly, by the ethos of  
its management team. This begins 
with a commonality of values: the 
low-ego, high-integrity mind-set  
that has successfully transformed  
St Ives into an international 
marketing services business.
 
The businesses that we buy 
are run by talented people with 
entrepreneurial drive and vision.  
As part of their integration into  
St Ives, they remain in place for 
several years to continue building 
their companies as individual 
businesses while collaborating  
with others across the Group.
International growth through 
both organic expansion and 
further acquisition remains high 
on our agenda. Incite, part of our 
consultancy division, plans to open 
a San Francisco ofﬁce during the 
current ﬁnancial year, adding to  
our US presence in Chicago  
and New York. 
Governance
The Board regularly scrutinises  
our strategy to ensure we stay  
on the right path in view of shifting 
market forces. The last six years  
have been an intense period 
of change for the Group and 
international expansion brings its 
own challenges, with values as  
well as services to be exported.
Our approach
It has been a positive year 
for St Ives. The Group has 
delivered another strong ﬁnancial 
performance while continuing 
the successful execution of our 
business strategy.
Our reorganisation during the year 
into three segments – Strategic 
Marketing, Marketing Activation  
and Books – more closely aligns  
our proposition with the business 
needs of our clients.
Our acquisition of Solstice 
strengthens our foothold in North 
America and supports our drive 
to expand internationally whilst 
also adding to our offering in the 
growing area of digital and mobile 
marketing. Additionally, we have 
boosted our consulting capabilities, 
completing the acquisition of Fripp, 
Sandeman and Partners (‘FSP’), a 
UK-based retail property consultancy 
business, just after the year-end. 
FSP will work closely with, and add 
complementary skills to Pragma, our 
existing retail consulting business.
Our CEO, Matt Armitage and our 
CFO, Brad Gray had impressive ﬁrst 
full years in their respective roles. 
St Ives’ strong performance has 
continued under their guidance and 
they are instrumental in identifying 
and ﬁnalising acquisitions. My fellow 
Directors and I look forward to 
working with them to deliver  
further growth for the Group.
We will also be seeking to appoint  
an experienced Non-Executive 
Director to the Board who would  
add to the knowledge and capabilities 
of the existing Board members 
and inject fresh ideas to help our 
businesses grow.
Our employees – their 
development and health 
and safety
As a result of our transformation 
over recent years, St Ives is  
– more than ever – a people 
business. We employ over  
3,000 people across the Group,  
in multiple locations and across  
ﬁve countries. The development and 
wellbeing of our people is therefore 
a key strategic consideration for  
the Board.
As we get bigger it is vital that  
we attract, retain and develop the 
best talent. As such, we recognise 
the importance of demonstrating 
and communicating the beneﬁts 
that our ﬁnancial strength, 
successful business model and 
growth-orientated culture bring  
to our people.
It is also important that we continue 
our ethos of collaboration, to ensure 
that we make the most of the wide 
range of capabilities within St Ives. 
This, in turn, will give our people the 
opportunity to develop by broadening 
their experience and skills. 
Health and Safety remains an 
absolute priority. We continuously 
scrutinise all facets of our operations, 
from our ﬂeet of vehicles to each  
of our sites, to maintain the highest 
standards for staff and visitors alike.

CASE STUDY
Realise has been working with 
Greyhound in the US to lead 
a full digital transformation 
programme. The business is 
looking to achieve signiﬁcant 
growth ambitions, undertaking a 
comprehensive and far-reaching 
programme of work designed 
to boost travel frequency 
of existing passengers and 
increase the number of new 
customers.
 
At the heart of this is an 
understanding of the need for 
holistic business transformation 
which will touch every aspect 
of Greyhound operations, with 
digital playing a pivotal role in 
changing brand perception  
and customer experience.
Realise has therefore spent the 
past year delivering a broad 
digital programme to support 
business change. The company 
has followed a robust user-
centred design approach with 
the ﬁrst phase resulting in the 
delivery of a new web platform 
for marketing and ticketing. 
The process has been driven 
by insight gathering and user 
validation, essential to support 
and secure the eCommerce  
goals that are a key measure  
of success in this project.
 
Collaboration between the client, 
agency and third parties has been 
critical to delivering the work on 
time and on budget. Realise’s 
relationship with Greyhound 
continues to evolve, with planning 
already under way for future 
campaign work, mobile application 
and physical service design.

Outlook
I believe the Group occupies  
a unique space in the market.  
We have successfully reshaped 
the business, modernising through 
acquisitions in the high-growth 
areas of data, digital and consulting 
services while continuing to invest in 
our existing operations. As a whole,  
that gives us an unrivalled suite  
of services for clients and a  
strong proposition for investors.
I would like to thank all of our 
employees for their continuing 
dedication, and the Board members 
for their commitment to growing  
the Group. I look forward to another 
busy and prosperous year ahead.

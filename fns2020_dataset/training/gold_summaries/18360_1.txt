record for the Company.
OVERVIEW
Our markets are strong, with favourable economic and consumer 
trends. Our core leisure customer is part of a market that is 
growing strongly every year as people take more holidays and 
city breaks, complemented by a business travel market that 
prizes both flexibility and value. 
easyJet has positioned its network and product to capitalise on 
these trends and has delivered again during the year. Our business 
model and strategy are continuing to deliver profitable growth  
and increasing annual returns to shareholders. 
In particular:
• Revenue increased by 3.5% to £4,686 million, with passenger 
volumes increasing by 6.0% and revenue per seat by 1.5% on a 
constant currency basis to £64.28, offset by currency headwinds. 
• Our passengers continue to be attracted by our model of having 
convenient airports and flights, available at good value. We 
finished the year strongly with record load factors in both July 
and August driving revenue per seat up by 3.2% in constant 
currency in the fourth quarter. 
• Load factor for the full year grew by 0.9 percentage  
points to 91.5%, demonstrating strong demand in a 
competitive environment. 
• We increased yield and revenue throughout the year with our 
market leading digital platform driving and fulfilling demand, 
supported by our best-in-class Revenue Management System.
• Our confidence, both in the demand environment and our 
structural growth opportunities within our markets has led us  
to secure an additional 36 aircraft between 2018 and 2021, 
comprising 30 Next Generation A320s and 6 Current Generation 
A320s, all in the 186 seat configuration. This will bring flexibility 
and secure further cost savings of £27 million.
• Cost per seat decreased by 3.4%, with benefits from both fuel  
and currency. Cost per seat at constant currency excluding fuel 
increased by 3.6%. We have experienced cost pressures that 
include regulated airport price increases, increased de-icing costs 
and significant disruption costs. We have mitigated this through 
£46 million of sustainable savings and we have a pipeline of 
structural cost improvement to deliver future savings.
• Profit before tax grew by £105 million to £686 million and we 
increased the profit before tax margin to 14.6% from 12.8%. 
• Return on capital employed
(1)
 increased by 1.7 percentage 
points to a record 22.2% (2014: 20.5%), with some benefits 
from our hedge positions, maintaining our strong market 
returns. We continue to drive capital efficiency with rigour and 
discipline, reallocating aircraft around the network to maximise 
return on capital employed. 
• We generated £895 million of operating cash flow, reducing  
our gearing to 14%, thus further strengthening our balance sheet. 
• Reflecting the strong financial performance during 2015, the 
Board has recommended a dividend of 55.2 pence per share, 
an increase of 21.6% from the prior year, in line with its policy 
of paying 40% of annual profit after tax to shareholders.

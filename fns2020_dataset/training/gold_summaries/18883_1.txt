 6 Kingﬁ sher Annual Report 2014/15

Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer
MY
FIRST
120
DAYS
In my ﬁ rst few months I have visited 
all the countries in which we operate, 
I have been to every operating 
company, met the local Boards and 
visited people’s homes. Looking at 
the way people live it is clear to me 
that customers’ needs are more 
similar than different.

CEO’s Q&A interview
Q
  You’ve only been CEO for a 
few months, what are your 
ﬁrst impressions?
A
  In my ﬁrst three months I visited all 
our countries and visited customers’ 
homes in each one. One of the 
things those visits made clear to me 
was how similar people’s needs are. 
They want more space, more light, 
better storage. The second point  
is the energy and enthusiasm of  
our staff. We are fortunate to have 
such a loyal, hard-working group of 
colleagues and one of my priorities 
will be to ensure that Kingﬁsher is  
a great company that people want 
to work for. 
Q
  Having reviewed the Company’s 
business and strategy, what were 
your key ﬁndings?
A
  The ﬁrst point is that home 
improvement is a great market with 
huge potential. It’s a big market, 
worth £235bn in Europe and it’s  
still largely fragmented, so there  
is plenty of scope to grow. Home 
improvement is a top spending 
priority for consumers as people 
want a better home and a better 
life. These human needs are being 
fuelled further by socio-economic 
trends across the world. These 
include changing demographics 
(such as ageing populations and 
more people working from home), 
urbanisation (which means that 
homes are generally getting 
smaller), more home technology, 
rising energy costs and more and 
more regulatory requirements. 
Another factor is the rise in 
specialist communities as people 
look to share information, ideas and 
know-how in all sorts of areas from 
music, to car sharing, to holidays. 
Home improvement can be one of 
those communities. Kingﬁsher is 
also in a great position within the 
market. We serve over a million 
customers a day, we have market 
leading positions and buying scale 
of more than £7bn a year. But I am 
very clear that we can make more 
of the assets we have. To achieve 
these ambitions we will need to 
organise ourselves very differently.
Q
  You are talking about organising 
Kingﬁsher in a more uniﬁed way 
than before. Can you describe 
how this will work in practice? 
A
  Kingﬁsher has made good progress 
over the years in terms of its 
individual businesses working more 
closely together, on things like direct 
sourcing and own brand 
development. But they still basically 
operate in individual silos, with only 
limited sharing. For example, 
Kingﬁsher’s businesses sell a 
combined total of nearly 400,000 
skus (stock keeping units) across 
the top ﬁve operating companies 
(B&Q UK, Screwﬁx, Castorama 
France and Poland, Brico Dépôt 
France). That is too many and 
shows that there has been 
proliferation at the local level.  
Q
  How do you feel about being 
appointed CEO of Kingﬁsher?
A
  I am delighted and honoured to be 
Kingﬁsher’s CEO. It’s a great business 
and I am proud to lead it. I would like 
to thank Sir Ian Cheshire for all his 
help and advice over my 11 years  
at Kingﬁsher. He built really strong 
foundations which I aim to build on, 
an appropriate message for a home 
improvement company! I know the 
business and the people well, so  
I know how much opportunity there  
is for our Company. I am excited by 
the challenge.
Q
  You’ve worked in home 
improvement for your entire 
career. What is it about the 
industry that you enjoy?
A
  Yes, I’ve worked in home 
improvement for 26 years so I 
feel I know our market as well as 
anyone. Some might say it’s not 
very glamorous but I think it is.  
Not only have I worked in home 
improvement all my working life  
but I have also been involved in the 
complete renovation of three homes 
in France over the years. People’s 
homes are their most important 
asset and they also have a strong 
emotional commitment to them. 
That emotional commitment makes 
home improvement a great 
business to be in - you are helping 
people improve their home. It is a 
positive business and a fast-moving 
one. That makes it very enjoyable. 
“ Home improvement is a great market 
with huge potential. It’s a top spending 
priority for consumers as people want  
a better home and a better life.” 8 Kingﬁ sher Annual Report 2014/15
Of these skus, only 7,000 are 
sold by more than one of our 
businesses. Again, this shows that 
we have not been making the most 
of our scale. Going forward, our 
aim is to organise the business in a 
more uniﬁ ed way. This will enable 
individual country management 
teams to concentrate on what they 
do best, running their stores and 
hiring great people.
Q
  Is there a risk with this level 
of change?
A
  To be honest I think there is a 
bigger risk in not doing it. If 
Kingﬁ sher is to make the most of its 
scale and unlock its potential, then 
I believe we need to organise 
ourselves in a very different way. We 
have appointed a new leadership 
team structured along these lines, 
including roles which will head up 
our ‘Big Box’ stores, our ‘Medium-
Box’ stores and Omnichannel 
operations worldwide too. 
CEO’s Q&A interview continued
Q
  You’ve recently named your 
leadership team. Can you tell us 
about the mix of skills and 
experience they have?
A
  The new leadership team combines 
existing and new talent with 
cross-company roles that are more 
focused. We recently announced 
that Arja Taaveniku will be joining 
Kingﬁ sher as Chief Offer & Supply 
Chain Ofﬁ cer. From 1994 to 2012 
she held a variety of senior roles at 
IKEA of Sweden. We will also be 
appointing a new Chief People 
Ofﬁ cer in due course. They will join 
existing members of the leadership 
team, our Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, 
Karen Witts, and our three 
Operations Directors, Guy Colleau, 
Alain Souillard and Steve Willett.
 
Q
  You’ve announced signiﬁ cant 
changes to the B&Q UK store 
portfolio. Can you explain 
your thinking and whether 
similar changes might be 
needed in other markets?
A
  Kingﬁ sher has said for some time 
that B&Q can meet local customer 
needs from fewer stores and that 
some of our branches could be 
smaller. We announced the ﬁ rst 
phase of this plan in 2013 and have 
now announced the second phase, 
which was based on a catchment 
by catchment review of all our local 
trading areas, designed to retain 
customers and sales. This involves 
the closure of 15% of B&Q’s space 
and the right-sizing of six further 
stores. We are looking to close 
a small number of loss-making 
stores in continental Europe as 
well. As we build for the future we 
will also be starting a revitalisation 
programme at our Big Box stores 
across Europe, drawing on our 
latest, most developed formats 
from around the Company.
Q
  You’ve announced a deal to 
sell a controlling stake in B&Q 
China. Was it a disappointment 
to withdraw from such a 
promising market?
A  China is a market with great 
potential, but it is also a very 
difﬁ cult market and our business 
there was loss-making. I am 
delighted to have found a strong 
retail partner who will help us 
release the ﬁ nancial value of our 
business in China and enable us 
to focus our resources on Europe, 
where there are signiﬁ cant 
opportunities for growth.
“ Going forward, our aim is to 
organise the business in a more 
uniﬁ ed way. This will enable the 
individual country management 
teams to concentrate on what 
they do best.”

Strategic Report
Q
  Kingﬁsher has been a big 
champion of sustainability.  
Will it be important under  
your leadership?
A  We are committed to delivering our 
strategy in a sustainable way and 
this approach should become 
business as usual. There are a 
broad range of opportunities in this 
area. These include commercial 
opportunities to help support our 
success today, while enabling us  
to grasp those that come from a 
changing environment over the long 
term, as well as the social and 
community aspects of sustainability. 
I want Kingﬁsher to be a great 
company that people want to work 
for, and that has a fair and equitable 
approach to business. There are 
also signiﬁcant opportunities in 
creating communities around home 
improvement, as it’s an area where 
people want ideas and advice.  
The collaborative economy is  
very interesting for us.
Q
  You are one of the few female 
CEOs in the FTSE100. Is enough 
being done to address this?
A
  I think things are heading in the 
right direction, but it takes time.  
For my own part, I hope that I am  
a good example for all the young 
women out there who want to 
become chief executives. I have  
not done anything differently from  
a man. I have just been passionate 
about what I was doing and been 
true to my convictions. Hopefully, I 
provide the proof that it’s possible. 
The key for a business is to have  
a pipeline of talent that you can 
develop and promote from.
Q
  If you look forward 5-10 years, 
what sort of Kingﬁsher would  
you like to see?
A
  I would like us to be the leading 
home improvement company; 
genuinely international in scope, 
innovative and unique in what  
we offer customers and a real 
community for people who are 
interested in home improvement,  
or want to learn. I am passionate 
about working with all our people  
to make those things happen and 
help our customers have better 
homes and better lives.

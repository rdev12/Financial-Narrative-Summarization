Gene therapy at a glance
What is gene therapy? 
Gene therapy is a technique 
which arms the body with its 
own biological ammunition 
to ﬁght disease. 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)  
is a complex chemical that carries 
genetic information. Genes are 
speciﬁc units of DNA which encode 
instructions on how to make 
proteins; the building blocks which 
cells in the body require to function 
properly.  Examples of proteins 
include enzymes, hormones  
and antibodies.
There are several gene therapy 
approaches in development such as:
—  Inserting a healthy copy of a 
gene to address a mutated gene 
that causes disease
—  Inactivating, or “knocking out”,  
a mutated gene that is 
functioning improperly  
(gene silencing)
—  Introducing a new gene, or 
genes, into speciﬁc cells within 
the body to help ﬁght a disease
One of the most common forms  
of gene therapy involves inserting 
healthy genes into speciﬁc cells
within a patient who has inherited  
a faulty copy of the gene. For 
example, StarGen
™
 inserts the 
healthy ABCR gene into the retina  
of patients with Stargardt disease 
and, similarly, UshStat
®
 delivers  
a healthy MYO7A gene to treat 
patients with Usher syndrome  
type 1B.
 
How does it work? 
In order to deliver the functional 
gene into the target cells such as  
the eye, for example, the gene needs  
to be carried by a “vector” which can 
enter the cell without causing any 
damage. Viruses have spent millions 
of years living in human cells and 
have adapted to be able to grow and 
replicate (i.e. make more of themselves) 
very well. Using a type of virus called 
a lentivirus, our scientists have hijacked 
the virus’ ability to get into target 
cells in order to deliver a signiﬁcant 
amount of genetic information safely 
and very efficiently.
Using a lentivirus called equine 
infectious anaemia virus (EIAV), we 
strip out the virus’ ability to replicate 
and then insert the desired genetic 
payload into this vector. Once 
administered directly to the target 
tissue in the patient, the shell of  
the virus knows what to do:
1.   It provides the mechanism for 
entry into the target cell across  
the cell surface membrane
2.   It takes the DNA gene(s) into the 
nucleus; the control centre which 
contains the cell’s own DNA
 —   Lentiviruses are speciﬁcally 
adapted to perform this task 
efficiently in non-dividing cells 
such as retinal cells in the eye 
or neurons in the brain
3.   The vector inserts the genetic 
payload into the cell’s DNA sequence
4.   The viral shell is naturally 
degraded away
5.    The newly-inserted gene(s) is  
then able to make a new protein 
product to target disease or produce 
a molecule that inactivates a 
mutated gene
 
Future development 
In November 2012 the European 
Commission approved its ﬁrst  
gene therapy product, Glybera
®
,  
to treat patients with lipoprotein 
lipase deﬁciency. 
Only two other gene therapy 
products are approved for use: 
Gendicine
™
 in China (for cancer)  
and Neovasculgen in Russia (for 
peripheral arterial disease). Gene 
therapy offers a long-lasting 
treatment from a single administration 
and, although still very much in 
development, scientiﬁc breakthroughs 
continue to move this technology 
towards mainstream medicine.
Gene therapy has the potential to create medicines and treatments  
that could improve life for millions of people worldwide.

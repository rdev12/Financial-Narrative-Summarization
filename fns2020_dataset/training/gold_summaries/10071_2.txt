Corporate Social 
Responsibility
Melrose believes good corporate 
social responsibility is not only 
desirable in its own right but also 
makes good business sense.  
Group companies work closely 
with their local communities, 
engaging with them and building 
relationships with charities and 
environmental organisations. 
Employee investment, 
consultation and development 
The Group attaches great importance 
to good labour relations, employee 
engagement and employee 
development. The diverse nature  
of the Group’s activities places the 
responsibility for the implementation 
and management of employment 
practices with local management, in a 
manner appropriate to each business.
Health and safety 
The Directors of the Company are 
committed to minimising the health 
and safety risks that each of the 
Group’s employees is exposed to  
by promoting the effective use and 
management of business-specific 
policies and procedures.
Detailed health and safety plans  
are set by businesses each year  
to determine annual targets and 
improvement initiatives.

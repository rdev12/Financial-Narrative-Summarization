Annual Report 2007
Summary of the Year
2007 was a landmark year for Hardy. In India,  
our discovery on CY-OS/2 block (Ganesha) has 
increased the Company’s Contingent Resource 
inventory, which will be further appraised in the  
latter part of 2008 and early 2009 with the  
drilling of three wells on the Fan-A discovery.
The announced discovery of Dhirubhai 33 on the GS-01 block, with 
our partner Reliance, also contributed to the growth of our Contingent 
Resource inventory. An appraisal programme has been proposed by the 
operator and is currently under review by the joint venture. Drilling of an 
additional three exploration wells will commence in the second quarter  
of 2008 targeting several other independent prospects.
The recent KGV-D3-A1 (Dhirubhai 39) and KGV-D3-B1 (Dhirubhai 41) 
gas discoveries on the D3 block are an encouraging start to evaluating 
the prospectivity of this block. We anticipate that the newly acquired 3D 
seismic data will identify further drilling prospects as we complete the full 
evaluation of the block.
Key Financial Results
Revenue in 2007 , as anticipated, decreased to $1 1.8 million in 2007 
compared to $21.3 million in 2006. This was due to several factors 
including the expected increase in the Government of India’s profit  
oil share, a decrease in production levels and an increase in closing 
inventory. Net profit was $8.3 million compared to $10.2 million in  
2006. The Company also realised a gain of $10.2 million from the  
sale of shares in Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited (HOEC).
Diluted earnings per share were $0.1 3 in 2007 compared to $0.1 7 for 
2006. We anticipate that earnings will continue to fall in 2008 as PY -3 
operating and administrative costs have increased while production from 
PY -3 will decline from 2007 levels.
The active drilling programme in 2007 resulted in capital expenditure  
of $32.2 million compared with $51 .6 million in 2006.
At the end of 2007 , the Company had cash reserves of $31.2 million.  
In 2007 , the Company raised $40.2 million through a placing of 5,009,541 
Ordinary Shares. The Company participated in an HOEC rights issue and 
also partially liquidated its investment in HOEC resulting in a net addition 
to cash resources of $7 .4 million during January 2008.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 7 Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report 2007
India
In 2007 the major focus of the Company was on the Hardy-operated 
assets, CY-OS/2 exploration licence and PY-3 production block.
PY-3 – Production from the PY-3 field was lower than expected in 2007 
due to the shut-in of the PY-3-3RL well in August 2007 . The drilling of two 
additional wells (Phase III) is on-track but additional production from this 
drilling programme is not expected until 2009.
CY-OS/2 – The Fan-A1 well discovery (Ganesha) was announced at the 
beginning of the year and the focus quickly turned to evaluating results 
and, subsequently, submitting an appraisal programme to the CY-OS/2 
joint venture. The additional geological and geophysical work, along with 
well planning, remains a focus of the Group as we move into 2008. We are 
considering farming-out a portion of our interest to be more consistent 
with the risk profile of the Company’s other exploration assets.
Results on our non-operated exploration assets have also been encouraging 
as we continue to pursue our strategy of de-risking this portfolio.
GS-01 – The gas discovery in well GS-01-B1 (Dhirubhai 33) was the 
second well to be drilled under this exploration licence. The operator has 
submitted an appraisal programme which is awaiting approval. A further 
three exploration wells are scheduled to commence drilling in the second 
quarter of 2008.
The assets that continue to generate the most interest and anticipation 
are the Company’s Krishna Godavari basin blocks D9 and D3.
D9 – Due to the industry-wide shortage of drilling ships capable of 
operating in water depths greater than 2,000 m, delays have been 
experienced on the D9 exploration licence. We anticipate that drilling  
of the first well on the D9 block may commence before the end of 2008.
D3 – The drilling phase on D3 began much sooner than expected 
with the commencement of drilling of the first well at the end of 
2007. Subsequently, we were pleased to announced two successive 
gas discoveries on the block, with encouraging initial testing results 
including an observed flow rate of 38.1 MMscfd. We anticipate that 
the operator will submit an appraisal programme for approval shortly. 
Further drilling on the D3 block is not expected to commence until 
the first quarter of 2009 as the joint venture evaluates the additional 
2,800 km
2
 of 3D seismic acquired in 2007.
Assam – As announced on 3 April 2008, the pursuit of our Indian strategy 
resulted in the award of the Assam onshore petroleum exploration licence 
AS-ONN-2000/1. We are also delighted with the Company’s continued 
partnership with Reliance. This is the fourth block that Hardy holds in 
partnership with Reliance and the Company’s first onshore asset in India. 
The block provides further long-term potential to create significant 
shareholder value.
Nigeria
We observed several key milestones with respect to our Nigerian operations.
Oza – Hardy was able to conduct its first full field operation with the well 
flow test of Oza-4. The initial results are positive and, more importantly,  
the operator received cooperation and support from the local 
communities. We have established open channels of dialogue with all 
stakeholders in the Oza communities and we look for this to continue as  
we move towards initial field development in the latter part of 2008.
As announced on 3 April 2008 the Company entered into an agreement 
to farm-out a 20 per cent interest in the Oza block to Emerald Energy 
Resources Limited (Emerald). Emerald has agreed to assume Hardy’s 
financial obligations in the funding of the Oza field initial development 
programme.
Atala – Securing the necessary equipment for the planned re-entry 
operating in Atala continues to be difficult. The Company’s Nigerian 
management team have been working closely with a consortium of 
swamp operators. This group has several options available to them and we 
anticipate that greater clarity on the timing of operation will be achieved 
in 2008.
2008 Programme
We are looking forward to an active 2008 with the following plan of work:
+ GS-01 – Drilling of three exploration wells 
+ D3 – Processing and interpretation of acquired 3D seismic data
+  D3 – Submission of appraisal programme for Dhirubhai 39 and  
41 discovery
+  CY-OS/2 – Commencement of appraisal drilling to assess  
Ganesha discovery
+ D9 – Commencement of exploration drilling programme
+ Assam – Acquisition of 350 line km of 2D seismic data
+ Oza – Commence field development operations.
The Company will continue to focus on organic growth as our primary 
strategy to create shareholder value. The NELP rounds have become 
increasingly competitive; however, they still offer the most direct way  
of acquiring exploration acreage in India.
Staff
The accomplishments of 2007 would not have been possible without  
the dedication of the Company’s staff in India, Nigeria and London, UK.  
The India team continues to drive the core of our business. The Nigerian 
team have reached a key milestone in 2007 despite challenging conditions. 
The corporate team in London, along with the India team in Chennai,  
were instrumental in the efficient execution of the Main Market listing.  
I would like to take this moment to recognise them all for their efforts  
in the past year.

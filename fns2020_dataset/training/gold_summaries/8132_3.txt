CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The Innovation Group provides software and outsourcing services to
the insurance industry. Our vision is to provide technology and best
practice for the administration of policies and claims for the world’s
insurers and risk carriers. The Group is totally focused on this market,
and delivers its two broad offerings through a single client-centric
organisation. We are a multinational player operating in the world’s
largest insurance markets with a strong proportion of our clients
being international in nature. Our 1,400 people across the world
have extensive insurance experience, and they are ably supported by
our partners.
The Year in Review
During 2006, we continued to make strong progress in all aspects of
our business. We delivered signiﬁcant growth in both revenue and
proﬁts and we had strong cash generation with an operating cash
inﬂow of £10m. Recurring revenue increased from £40.5m in 2005
to £55.4m in 2006 and is now 70% of total revenue. Organic revenue
growth was 23% during the year and this was complemented by
acquisition activity where we completed ﬁve acquisitions to further
extend our geographic reach. 
Client satisfaction reﬂects the underlying strength of our business,
and our client relationships continued to prosper during the year.
We extended our outsourcing relationships with existing outsourcing
clients and also won new clients, which resulted in organic growth
of 23%. In addition we also secured seven new software licences,
which help to secure our immediate future revenues. 
Since the year end we have undertaken the acquisition of First Notice
Systems. This strategic acquisition provides the Group with an
important entry into the insurance outsourcing market in the USA.
We are pleased that the strong management team of First Notice
Systems are joining the Group. In addition, Eric Wadsworth, the Group
COO, is relocating to the USA to ensure the smooth integration and
success of the acquisition.
Financial results
Revenue for the year ended 30 September 2006 was £79.7m (2005:
£60.9m); recurring revenue increased to £55.4m (2005: £40.5m) and
now represents 70% of total Group revenue. Software and services
revenue was £31.4m (2005: £25.9m) and outsourcing revenue was
£48.3m (2005 £35.0m).
Adjusted proﬁt* before tax for the year ended 30 September 2006
was £10.9m (2005: £3.6m) and proﬁt before tax was £8.5m (2005:
£1.9m), representing adjusted EPS of 1.77p (2005: 0.40p) and basic
EPS of 1.28p (2005: 0.07p). The average number of shares used 
to calculate EPS in both 2006 and 2005 have been adjusted 
to reﬂect the shares issued during the rights issue completed on 
13 December 2006.
Operating cash ﬂow for the year ended September 2006 was £10.0m
(2005: £7.2m). 
* Adjusted proﬁt before tax is proﬁt before tax after adding back the
amortisation charge of £1.3m, a share based payments charge of
£0.9m and utilisation of pre-acquisition brought forward tax losses
of £0.2m as analysed on page 13.
Organisation and employees
I would like to pay tribute to the outstanding teamwork and
commitment to clients displayed by our employees during the year.
I would also like to extend a warm welcome to our new recruits and
to partners’ employees who are working with us on client engagements.
During the year we increased our headcount from 1,262 to 1,403, and
with the integration of post year end acquisitions this will increase to
approximately 1,800. The Innovation Group continues to attract and
retain some of the best people in the industry and we recognise them
as the foundation of our future success.
The Board 
There have been no Board changes since the approval of the last
financial statements. Chris Banks and David Thorpe continue as
non-executive directors and Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration
Committees respectively, and I remain as non executive Chairman
of the Board.

In October 2006 the Group announced that Paul Smolinski would be
stepping down from his position as Group Finance Director in early
2007 to pursue interests more in line with his personal ambitions.
Paul has made a considerable contribution to the Group during the
past four and a half years, and I would like to take this opportunity
to thank him and to wish him well for the future. 
Outlook
The Group is well positioned as we enter 2007. The proportion of
recurring revenue has again increased, and we have clear visibility
of the milestones which drive the timing of our software licence
revenues in the second half of the year .
We have an extensive outsourcing client base and the pipelines
remain healthy in each geography. We are particularly excited about
our entry into outsourcing in the US. We anticipate organic growth
to continue in 2007 through our simple objective of delivering more
beneﬁts to more clients in more markets.
Software licence sales still remain attractive although they are 
difﬁcult to predict. Our ﬁve year relationship with IBM gives us the
platform to distribute our software products on a global basis and we
anticipate seeing further results from this partnership in the 2007
ﬁnancial year .
In summary, we aim to continue the momentum gained throughout
2006. Our business plan calls for further organic revenue growth
augmented by selected acquisitions. In addition, we plan to improve
productivity further over the full year and we look forward to the
future with optimism.

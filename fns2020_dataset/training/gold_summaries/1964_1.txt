Ben Bailey Plc
2005 was a year in which further significant
progress was made by the Company. T urnover and
output reached record levels and illustrated that
the Company is well placed to increase its scale of
operations further. Once again, 2005 saw
significant increases in the Company’s land bank,
which leaves the company well placed to further
increase output in 2006 and subsequent years.
The Market
There was no doubt that a number of adverse
factors affected the housing market in our area of
operations. Adverse comments regarding house
prices which led to a loss in consumer confidence
dampened the market particularly following the
General Election in May.
Increased sales incentives, in common with other
housebuilders assisted in increasing our volume
output during the year, albeit at a lower margin
than previous years.
Financial Review
Reporting Requirements
The 2005 Accounts have been prepared under
International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). The main impact of adopting IFRS has
been in three areas, namely:- accounting for
dividends when the company has a current
obligation to pay them; charging the value of share
options to the income statement; and changing
the method of accounting for financial
instruments in the balance sheet.
T urnover
T urnover increased by 26.6% to £103.2m (2004:
£81.5m) all of which was derived from sales of
new houses. The number of legal completions
increased by 30% in the year to 686 plots (2004:
527 plots). The average selling price per house fell
in 2005 to £150,466 (2004: £154,650), largely as a
result of changes in product mix from 3/4
bedroomed homes to smaller dwellings and
apartments.
Profits
Profits before taxation declined to £12.7m, (2004:
£16.4m), due to the lower operating margins
achieved and the higher incidence of interest
charges incurred in financing expansion of our
land bank. Operating Margins also declined to
15.6% (2004: 22.3%). This reduction was caused
by a number of factors including levelling out of
selling prices, product mix and higher build costs. 
The taxation charge for the year was £3.69m
(2004: £4.64m). This charge represents 29.2% of
the pre-tax profits.
Balance Sheet
2005 saw a further increase in the Company’s
capital employed from £67.9 m to £95.5m,
reflecting the increase in the value of development
land and work in progress to £112.9m from
£83.8m.
The Company’s land bank has increased further
to 2,030 plots (2004: 1,770 plots) with detailed
planning permission granted. A further 1,000 plots
are held where contracts have been exchanged.
The investment in 2005 in development land of
£39.4m has resulted in a net cash outflow of
£19.1m. Borrowings increased during the year to
£54.8m, giving a gearing ratio, expressed as a
percentage net debt to shareholder funds of
134.6% (2004: 99.5%).

Treasury and Interest Rate Risk
During the course of 2005, the Company re-
negotiated its borrowing facilities from its banker.
The borrowing facilities now comprise a
committed five year facility of £58 million
together with an overdraft and other short-term
facilities of £13.5 million.
In order to mitigate the potential implications of
adverse interest rate movements, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement,
whereby £30 million of the Company’s
borrowings has been fixed at a rate of 5.2% for a
period of five years. Under IAS 39, this
investment is deemed to be a fully effective cash
flow hedge.
Health and Safety
The Company is committed to the objective of
creating an accident free working environment.
Risk Assessments continue to be carried out on all
developments with particular emphasis to ensure
that all Health & Safety issues have been
identified and addressed. External consultants are
employed to carry out independent Health &
Safety audits on all developments.
T raining
The Company continues to provide a high level of
training to all staff including management
development programmes for Middle Managers,
Health & Safety training for all site based staff and
NHBC Site Managers Accreditation courses for
Site Managers. The Company continues its
significant investment in apprentice schemes for
both bricklayers and joiners.
Following the success of the development
programme which enables apprentices to train as
Site Managers, the Company has decided to
increase its investment in this key area.
Design and Development
During the year a complete review of the
Company’s product range has been implemented
with regard being paid to customer feedback and
changes in planning requirements. These new
designs are being incorporated in developments to
achieve greater flexibility in the utilisation of land.

Land
Considerable progress has been made during the
year in enhancing and expanding the land bank.
Expenditure in 2005 amounted to £39.4million
which has resulted in an increase in the land bank
to 2,030 plots. In line with Government
requirements 77% of the expenditure was on land
classified as brownfield. Further investment in
land is expected in 2006 which will further
enhance our land bank, enabling the Company to
plan ahead with certainty whilst mitigating the
potential adverse impact of planning delays.
Construction
During 2005, the number of completed houses
has increased significantly. Although the shortage
of skilled craftsmen remains a factor within our
industry, the Company believes that the steps
taken in increased training and enhanced benefits
is now paying dividends.
Quality
The quality of our product continues to be a key
issue in the development of our business.
Customer feedback from post completion
customer questionnaires reveals that in 2005 95%
of our customers would recommend our product.
It is a testament to our commitment to quality that
the recommendation rate is still in excess of 90%
despite the significant increase in volume output.
Our high level of quality was also recognised in
2005 by the Company achieving the runner-up
position in the ‘Housebuilder of the Year’ award
run by the Building Magazine. This result was
based on a number of criteria including customer
feedback, charitable work in the community and
development of brownfield sites.
Ben Bailey in the Community
Once again in 2005, Ben Bailey’s contribution to
local communities has been recognised by the
Business in the Communities Per Cent Standard
Award, which is given to companies who
contribute at least 1% of their profits to charities
and local community projects.
Employees and Sub-Contractors
Once again, this result would not have been
achieved without the effort and support from all
our employees and sub-contractors. On behalf of
the Board, I thank them for their efforts and
commitment.

 I am delighted to report that the Group 
has delivered a strong set of results for 
the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2007.
Our overall sales growth of 13.1% at
improved margins has generated a pre-tax
profit of £5.8m, resulting in earnings per
share of 13.9p. Excluding exceptional 
items and the changes in Freeview carriage,
this is equivalent to a 44.6% increase in
underlying profitability.
This is a particularly impressive performance
when you consider that our main goal for
2007 was to put in place some of the key
strategic components that will underpin 
out future growth: our carriage contracts
with Freeview and Virgin Media, and our
new IT systems.
Our main TV channel, Ideal World, can
already be viewed by over 21 million
households, and this will rise to almost 
26 million in the next four years as digital
switchover completes, mainly via Freeview. 
We have secured our carriage on Freeview
until 2018, and subsequent renegotiations 
by other channels show that we have
done so at a price well below the current
market rate.
Last year’s replacement of our IT systems
will allow us to expand the business 
with ever increasing efficiency, whilst
responding more effectively to the needs
of our customers. In particular, it facilitates
significant development in our online
capability in 2008, led by our new Head 
of eCommerce.
Our investment in Superstore, our 
sourcing and wholesale business, is now
producing margin improvements, and 
we are managing working capital tightly.
Our cash balances at year end were
£16.7 million.
As we progress towards the convergence
of broadcast and online, Ideal’s role as 
a digital retailer means that we are well
positioned to build on our 2007 growth.
Nonetheless, we operate in what is
perhaps the fastest-paced sector of 
the retail market. Since becoming
Chairman, I have initiated a strategic review
to ensure that we continue to maximise
our opportunities in this exciting and rapidly
evolving market.
Dividend
These results, together with our
confidence in the business model, enable
the Board to recommend a final dividend
of 3.75p, which with our interim dividend
of 1.75p, takes the total dividend for the
year to 5.5p representing 29% growth 
over last year’s dividend of 4.25p. This
moves the Group onto a progressive and
sustainable dividend policy for the future.
Board changes
During the year, we have completed 
a restructuring of the Board in order 
to support the next stage of the 
Group’s growth.
Paul Wright and Val Kaye, Ideal’s 
co-founders, stepped down as 
non-executive Directors in the first half,
having already relinquished their executive
responsibilities in the previous year. 
Jim Hodkinson resigned as Chairman 
on 13 July 2007, and I became Chairman 
on that date. Finally, David Blake joined us

“I am delighted that in a year when we have been

as Finance Director, taking over from Mike
Camp who stepped down in July 2007. 
I would like to thank all of our current and
previous Directors for the contribution they
have made to the growth and
development of the Group.
Colleagues
I am extremely grateful for the hard 
work and dedication of the whole team 
in generating these strong results, in
challenging trading conditions. I would like
to thank all of our employees on behalf of
the Board and our shareholders. I look
forward to our continued success in the
year ahead.
Outlook
Despite the toughening retail environment,
2008 has started well with good growth 
on what was a very strong start to 2007.
Our sales for the first nine weeks of the 
new financial year are 6.4% ahead of 2007,
and 27% ahead of 2006. In more difficult
times, our consumers increasingly enjoy 
the convenience of being able to shop from
their homes, and we are confident that the
investments made in 2007 position us to
make good progress in 2008 and beyond.

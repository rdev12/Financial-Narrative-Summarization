 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
AS WE HAD PREVIOUSLY INDICATED, 2008 PROVED 
TO BE A CHALLENGING YEAR, WITH RECORD RAW 
MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS COMBINED WITH 
A DRAMATIC DROP IN DEMAND FROM CONSTRUCTION 
RELATED CUSTOMERS. NEVERTHELESS, MUCH WAS 
ACHIEVED DURING 2008 AND WE CAN TAKE COMFORT 
FROM THE RESILIENT NATURE OF THE MAJORITY OF 
OUR BUSINESS WHERE VOLUMES HAVE BEEN LESS 
AFFECTED AND MARGINS HAVE REMAINED ROBUST.
THE CURRENT YEAR HAS STARTED IN LINE WITH 
EXPECTATIONS AND A NUMBER OF KEY FACTORS 
HAVE MOVED IN OUR FAVOUR. THERE IS NO 
QUESTION THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE VERY 
CHALLENGING, BUT WE DO CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE 
A YEAR OF PROGRESS COMPARED TO 2008 WHEN 
THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN REDUCED CUSTOMER 
DEMAND AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF VERY DIFFICULT 
COST ISSUES TO DEAL WITH. WE HAVE TAKEN THE 
NECESSARY STEPS TO ELIMINATE EXCESS CAPACITY, 
REDUCE OUR COST BASE AND INVEST IN GROWING 
MARKETS AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL 
RESULT IN IMPROVED RETURNS IN FUTURE YEARS.

INTRODUCTION
As we had previously indicated, 2008 proved to be 
a challenging year, with record raw material and 
energy costs combined with a dramatic drop in 
demand from construction related customers.
Losses from the industrial part of our UK business, 
caused by this fall in demand, have been a major 
drag on Group proﬁ tability. We have taken decisive 
action to close excess capacity which has resulted 
in a signiﬁ cant charge to this year’s proﬁ ts.
Nevertheless, we can take comfort from the 
resilient nature of the majority of our business 
where volumes have been less a ﬀ ected and 
margins have remained robust. 
Despite our expectations for an improved 
performance in 2009, we are recommending 
a reduced dividend for the full year we 
are reporting on, as we believe it is prudent 
to preserve cash and support the balance 
sheet in these uncertain times.
RESULTS
On sales of £481 million (2007: £424 million), 
operating proﬁ t, before net restructuring costs, 
declined to £12.6 million (2007: £1 4.6 million). 
Net restructuring costs of £5.4 million (2007: 
£0.7 million) reﬂ ect closure and redundancy 
costs of £5.4 million (2007: £2.0 million). The 
2007 charge is net of a £1.3 million property 
gain. £4.0 million of the above costs are 
a provision for the closure of our Stockton 
site which we announced in November 2008 
and which will be completed during 2009.
After an increase in net ﬁ nancing costs to 
£3.3 million (2007: £2.4 million), the proﬁ t 
before tax was £3.9 million (2007: £1 1.5 million). 
Before restructuring costs, proﬁ t before tax was 
£9.3 million (2007: £12.2 million). Earnings per 
share were 1 0.67p (2007: 32.36p). Earnings per 
share, before restructuring costs, were 25.53p 
(2007: 34.26p). 
Operating proﬁ ts were impacted by increases 
in raw material costs during the ﬁ rst three 
quarters of the year and by soaring energy 
costs, particularly in the fourth quarter. Although 
we coped reasonably well with these factors, 
our UK business was also hit by a signiﬁ cant 
drop in demand from the construction sector, 
which traditionally accounts for around 15% 
of Group turnover, and this resulted in the 
decision to close our Stockton site.
Total volumes for the year were 305,000 
tonnes (2007: 316,000). At the half year they 
were 7,000 ahead of 2007, mainly due to the 
Canadian acquisition in August 2007. However, for 
the third quarter they fell by over 5,500 tonnes and 
in the fourth quarter by over 12,000 tonnes. After 
eliminating seasonal variations in agricultural sales, 
most of the annual volume loss can be attributed 
to the construction and industrial sectors.
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a reduced ﬁ nal 
dividend of 7.5p per share for the year ended 
31 December 2008 (2007: 15p), making a total 
for the year of 1 4.5p (2007: 22p). The ﬁ nal dividend 
is payable on 21 July 2009 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 1 3 March 2009. 
CASH FLOW & BORROWINGS
Net borrowings increased to £76 million 
(2007: £65 million) as at 31 December 2008. 
This increase can be entirely attributed to the 
e ﬀ ect of exchange rate movements on 
non-sterling denominated borrowings. 
Interest cover on bank borrowings, before 
exceptional costs, reduced to three times 
from the 2007 level of almost four times. As we 
envisaged, our net annual capital expenditure was 
slightly higher at £1 4.6 million (2007: £13.2 million). 
Expenditure for 2009 will be similar at around 
£1 4.0 million mainly due to investment in the 
Ardeer facility to incorporate new plant and certain 
items of machinery transferred from Stockton.
We envisage that, once completed, the closure 
of Stockton and the recent drop we have seen in 
raw material costs will have the e ﬀ ect of reducing 
our working capital.
We also anticipate substantial proceeds from 
the disposal of both the Stockton and Essex sites, 
but this may not happen for some time.
In September we renegotiated our banking 
facilities to ensure that we had headroom to 
see us through the next few years and carry 
out current and potential restructuring. This did 
not come without cost, but seemed a prudent 
move in the current credit climate. Our ongoing 
total available facilities, after repayment of 
a private placement of £20 million by July 2009, 
will be £1 16 million comprising revolving credits 
of £57.5 million renewable in 201 1, asset ﬁ nance 
of £17.5 million repayable over a ﬁ ve year period 
and short-term facilities of £41 million. 
GROUP PENSION SCHEME
The deﬁ cit in the pension scheme increased to 
nearly £26 million (2007: £1 8 million). The e ﬀ ect 
of falling investment values was largely o ﬀ set by 
the increase in the discount rate which is used 
to value liabilities. The reduction in asset values 
will, however, have a signiﬁ cant adverse e ﬀ ect 
on reported proﬁ ts for 2009 with net pension 
funding likely to move from a credit of 
£1 million to a charge of £1.5 million.

GROUP DEVELOPMENT
Despite the disappointing result for the year, 
much was achieved during 2008.
The expansion of our facility at Leominster, 
which manufactures industrial and silage 
stretchwrap, was completed on time and 
within budget. Two new ﬁ ve layer blown 
co-extrusion lines were installed in a purpose 
built extrusion bay. An additional ﬁ ve layer line 
was installed at Zele, in Belgium, their third ﬁ ve 
layer line for silage stretchwrap. These two facilities 
oﬀ er our customers unrivalled quality and service 
in this product which we supply across Europe 
and beyond.
At Ardeer, we successfully commissioned 
a back-seam tuber which makes tubular form 
ﬁ ll and seal feedstock from sheeting for use on 
automatic sack ﬁ lling lines, particularly in the 
cement industry. This type of packaging has the 
potential to eventually replace the paper cement 
sack when current packing machinery is replaced.
Our Consumer Packaging business at Worcester, 
which supplies printed ﬁ lm and bags for produce 
and bread, saw the installation of the ﬁ rst of two 
ten colour ﬂ exo presses, making this site the best 
equipped ﬂ exo print facility in the UK. The second 
press is currently being installed.
Our Chinese facility is now successfully making 
similar Consumer products and exporting to the 
Middle East, Australasia, the UK and also starting 
to manufacture for the Chinese domestic market. 
All of the above investments are in line with our 
strategy to invest in capacity in growing markets, 
supporting the future growth of the Group.
RESTRUCTURING
We have previously highlighted the need for 
change in our traditional UK business where 
it was clear that our capacity was no longer 
aligned with customer demand. 
In May we announced the closure of a small 
manufacturing site at Buckhurst Hill, in Essex, 
with the loss of some 45 jobs.
The dramatic drop in demand from the UK 
construction sector during 2008 necessitated 
further decisive action and in November we 
announced the intention to close the large 
manufacturing facility at Stockton-on-Tees, 
with the loss of 1 65 jobs.
The Essex closure and other restructuring in the 
UK business led to costs of £0.5 million in the ﬁ rst 
six months and £0.9 million in the second half. The 
estimated closure costs for Stockton, including 
asset write downs and equipment relocation costs, 
will be £5.0 million. £4.0 million of the total has 
been provided in 2008 with the balance to be 
charged in 2009. This brings the total 
restructuring cost for 2008 to £5.4 million. 
Both the Stockton and Essex sites are freehold 
and your Board is conﬁ dent that at some time 
in the future, and subject to relevant planning 
permissions, proceeds from the property sales 
will cover these closure costs. 
RAW MATERIAL COSTS
The collapse in commodity polymer prices 
at the end of 2008 was long overdue. The 
cash margin over the cost of a barrel of oil had 
reached an all time high and although those 
producers buying ethylene or naphtha were 
at a signiﬁ cant disadvantage, the integrated 
producers of polyethylene had never had it 
so good, enjoying margins never seen 
before in the industry.
It is a di ﬀ erent scenario today. Towards the 
end of 2008, the price of commodity grades 
of polymer fell ﬁ rst and fell sharply. Prices 
for speciality grades, which we use for many 
of our high quality products, fell less quickly 
and to a lesser extent and many did not move 
at all until early 2009.
This drop in the price of polymer has been 
accompanied by a drop in the value of sterling, 
resulting in smaller price reductions in the UK 
than in euro-priced markets.
The end result of these price changes will be 
a signiﬁ cant reduction in turnover and a drop 
in our working capital, as the average selling 
price per tonne falls in line with the reduced 
cost of the raw material.
New capacity for polymer production will continue 
to come on stream over the next few years, and, 
subject to continuity of the current oil price and 
minimum ﬂ uctuation in exchange rates, we 
anticipate that the price of our raw material will 
remain at or around current levels for some time.
ENERGY COSTS
Energy costs in the last few months of 2008 
were the highest that we have ever experienced. 
In 2008 our total energy bill increased by £8.5 
million to £22.0 million, with nearly £8.0 million 
of that increase arising in the UK.
It is clear that the UK, devoid of a coherent 
energy policy for a number of years, will struggle 
with energy costs and supplies over the next 
decade. Reduced demand from industry, as 
a consequence of the current recession, may help 
in the short term, but unless we can detect some 
sign that energy costs in the UK are going to align 
with those in our other manufacturing locations, 
we will ﬁ nd it di ﬃ  cult to invest in capacity in 
a country with energy costs so much higher 
than in the rest of the world.
PROSPECTS AND CURRENT TRADING
The defensive sectors of the business – agriculture, 
retail food and related transit packaging, healthcare 
and refuse sacks – currently remain resilient 
and we anticipate that volumes in these sectors 
in 2009 will be close to last year. Construction, 
industrial and non-food retail sectors are not 
doing so well, and for the ﬁ rst six months will 
be materially behind the same period last year. 
As indicated, action is being taken to reduce 
capacity in these di ﬃ  cult sectors and direct 
labour costs have already been drastically 
reduced at Stockton. However, it will be 201 0 
before we see the beneﬁ ts of this closure, as 
relocating production, while maintaining service 
to our customers, will take most of the year. 
By that time, we will have a much leaner, better 
equipped and lower cost operation to service 
our UK industrial and construction customers. 
The current year has started in line with 
our expectations and certain key factors have 
moved in our favour. Polymer, scrap, energy and 
other important input costs have all reduced from 
where they were during 2008. The movement 
in sterling exchange rates has made imports of 
polythene ﬁ lm products to the UK less attractive 
and has improved the competitiveness of our UK 
plants exposed to those imports. However, credit 
risks have increased and liquidity is uncertain 
in some export markets.
There is no question that 2009 will be very 
challenging, but we do currently anticipate a year 
of progress compared to 2008 when the economic 
downturn reduced customer demand and we 
had a number of very di ﬃ  cult cost issues to deal 
with. However, in the current climate, it would be 
imprudent not to have a sense of caution in 
relation to the e ﬀ ects the economic background 
may have on our customers. 
Looking to the longer term, we have taken steps 
to eliminate excess capacity, reduce costs and 
invest in growing markets. Your Board is conﬁ dent 
that these steps will result in improved returns 
in future years.

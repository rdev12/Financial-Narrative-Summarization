Chairman’s Statement
Investing for Growth
Over the last ﬁve years, against a backdrop of uncertain global 
markets, the Group has achieved 20% pa compound growth in 
earnings by a combination of good organic growth and selective, 
value-enhancing acquisitions. Market capitalisation has more 
than doubled over the ﬁve year period and early in the ﬁnancial 
year, the Group entered the FTSE 250 index.
I am pleased to report that the Group has made further progress 
during this ﬁnancial year and has delivered substantial value to 
shareholders with another year of strong double-digit growth 
in earnings and dividends.
The ability of the Group to continue to deliver these strong 
returns to shareholders over the next ﬁve year period, requires a 
commitment to invest strongly in establishing a ﬁrm foundation 
for growth. As I indicated last year, the Board has approved 
signiﬁcant investment across the Group’s businesses, designed 
to ensure that the Group will continue to deliver strong growth.
By the end of the 2013 ﬁnancial year, the Group will have 
invested ca. £3m in new and enlarged facilities for several 
businesses in the Group. Substantial investment has also now 
commenced on large ERP IT projects in three businesses and 
another project is planned to commence later in 2013 with 
an aggregate investment of ca. £2m. We have also invested 
in broadening the skill base across the Group, through a 
combination of recruiting additional senior management 
and new training programmes, at an additional annual 
cost of ca. £1m.
The Board is conﬁdent that with these investments and with 
further value-enhancing acquisitions, the momentum of 
growth in the Group will be sustained over the next ﬁve years.
Performance
Group revenue increased in 2012 by 13% to £260.2m (2011: 
£230.6m) with the continued strong performance in the Seals 
businesses being the main driver to growth and with good 
contributions from the Life Sciences and the Controls businesses. 
Adjusted operating margins increased further during the year  
to 20.3% (2011: 19.6%) reﬂecting the operational leverage in  
the North American Seals businesses and as a result, adjusted 
operating proﬁt increased by 17% to £52.8m (2011: £45.2m).
Underlying Group revenues and adjusted operating proﬁt 
increased by 6% and 11% respectively, after adjusting for the impact 
from acquisitions, the divestment of a small business in Switzerland 
and currency movements on the translation of overseas results.
Adjusted proﬁt before tax increased by 17% to £52.6m 
(2011: £44.9m) and adjusted earnings per share, helped 
by the purchase of minority interests last year, increased 
by 19% to 33.1p (2011: 27.9p).
The Group’s continuing ability to generate excellent cash 
ﬂow was demonstrated by an increase in free cash ﬂow of over 
30% to £32.7m (2011: £25.0m). This was after increasing capital 
investment to £3.5m (2011: £1.7m) which included £1.3m to 
upgrade facilities and other infrastructure assets.
After investing £22.3m on acquiring businesses and making 
dividend distributions to shareholders of £14.2m, the Group  
had net cash funds of £7.9m at 30 September 2012. This 
demonstrates the continuing strength of the Group’s balance 
sheet and provides conﬁdence in the Group’s ability to continue 
to invest strongly for future growth.
Acquisitions
The Board’s strategy to accelerate growth through carefully 
selected, value enhancing acquisitions remains a key factor in 
providing outstanding returns to shareholders. Once acquisitions 
are completed, the Group looks to make appropriate investment 
in the newly acquired businesses to build a solid platform for 
future growth.

The Board has continued to pursue this growth strategy during 
the year by investing over £22m in acquiring new businesses, 
with all three sectors of the Group beneﬁting from this 
investment. Each of these acquisitions has provided our existing 
businesses with opportunities to expand into new and related 
product and geographic markets.
We will continue to invest sensibly in broadening our businesses 
through a combination of organic investment and by 
acquisition. We have made good progress during the year  
in adding experienced resources which are designed to 
accelerate and broaden the acquisition programme over  
the coming years.
Dividends
With another year of good progress and in light of the strong 
balance sheet and free cash ﬂow, the Board is recommending 
an increase in the ﬁnal dividend of 20% to 10.2p per share  
(2011: 8.5p) which, subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 23 January 2013 
to shareholders on the register at 30 November 2012.
The total dividend per share for the year will be 14.4p which  
also represents a 20% increase on 2011. This is well covered by 
Adjusted EPS at 2.3 times and remains in line with our objective 
of targeting towards a 2 times cover.
Governance
I am delighted to welcome Marie-Louise Clayton to the Board 
following her appointment as a non-Executive Director on 
13 November 2012. As I indicated last year, this appointment 
represents the initial stage of developing the Board to meet the 
higher governance standards required of larger companies and 
we look forward to advancing this process over the next year with 
a further new addition. We have also made good progress during 
the year with updating our Board processes and policies to meet 
the UK Corporate Governance Code requirements. In September 
2012, the Board separated the role of Company Secretary from 
the Group Finance Director with the appointment of Anthony 
Gallagher as Group Company Secretary.
Employees
We have continued to invest this year in developing our 
management group through the appointment of external 
resource and through new internal promotions across the 
Group. We continue to foster an entrepreneurial culture  
within our businesses which encourages all our staff to take 
responsibility for their own businesses. I wish to send my sincere 
thanks to everyone in the Group, whose exceptional efforts  
and dedication to deliver outstanding value to our customers, 
has allowed the Group to continue to make further progress.
Current Trading
The Life Sciences businesses have begun the year well, beneﬁting 
from the investments made last year in consolidating the 
Healthcare businesses in Canada and from expanding further  
in Australia. The Seals businesses are continuing to enjoy robust 
underlying growth in their key markets in North America.  
The Controls businesses are beneﬁting from the acquisitions 
completed in the UK last year, but Continental European markets 
continue to show little sign of underlying growth. 
The Group has a resilient business model with a good 
geographic spread of businesses which are supported by  
a strong Group balance sheet and robust cash ﬂow. The 
investments made this year will provide a platform to drive 
underlying growth and intensify the search for good quality 
acquisitions. These factors provide the Board with conﬁdence 
that, despite the background of weak global economic market 
conditions, the Group is well placed to make further progress  
in the new ﬁnancial year.

Notes to page 3
(a)  The accounting information in these charts is drawn up in accordance with EU IFRS.
(b)  Underlying earnings is the key fi nancial performance indicator which management uses internally to assess performance. 
It is presented here as an additional measure of earnings to provide greater understanding of the underlying business 
performance of the Group’s operations. Items excluded from net earnings to arrive at underlying earnings are explained 
in note 2 to the 2009 Financial statements. Both net earnings and underlying earnings deal with amounts attributable to 
equity shareholders of Rio Tinto. However, EU IFRS requires that the profi t for the year reported in the income statement 
should also include earnings attributable to outside shareholders in subsidiaries. Overview Performance

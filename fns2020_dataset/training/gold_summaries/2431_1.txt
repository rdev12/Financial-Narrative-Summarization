 Introduction
The Board is pleased to report 
another year of strong organic 
growth for the Company with 
successful product innovation, 
geographic expansion, and an 
increasing client base of blue chip 
companies further strengthening 
our position in the market. 
Every company has a raison d’être. 
As befits a small company, ours 
is quite simple, but nevertheless 
ambitious: to alter and improve 
the way that major consumer 
companies undertake market 
research and to become one of the 
world’s top ten research groups. 
To achieve this, not only do we 
need to be different and innovative, 
but we must also implement 
effectively. To date, we have been 
successful in this.
We are small compared with 
our competitors, but now work 
with nine of the world’s top 20 
advertisers, up from seven in 2007.  
We have international reach 
and are growing quickly. We are 
profitable and have no debt.
Values and priorities
What excites us is the creative 
process, and designing market 
research tools and techniques 
which can transform our clients’ 
innovation processes. Our clients 
are predominantly in the mass 
consumer market (the largest 
buyers of market research in 
the world) and our products 
are focussed on the difficult 
earlier stages of their innovation 
development. We believe that 
around half of their market 
research spend is applied to these 
stages and this segment appears 
to be significantly underserved by 
our competitors.
To use our jargon, we have two 
categories of products; “Juicy” and 
“Twist”. Juicy products are new to 
the world techniques which are 
entirely different from any available 
elsewhere and which challenge 
traditional approaches. Twist 
products utilise industry standard 
quantitative research methods 
but add our unique quali-quant 
diagnostics; MindReader
TM
 and 
FaceTrace
TM
. Both are important to 
the business and appreciated by 
our clients but we believe it is our 
Juicy Products which will drive the 
long-term growth of the Company. 
The year has seen strong uptake 
of our Juicy Products – Predictive 
Markets, Creative 6ers
TM
, Insight 
Validation

 and CommScan
TM
. 
Increasing by 49%, they now 
account for 46% of the Company’s 
total revenue, contributing £4.3m 
in 2008 (2007: £2.6m). Juicy 
Products are used by all nine 
of our clients in the world’s top 
20 advertisers and by 59 of our 
140 clients. In January 2009, 
BrainJuicer launched its latest Juicy 
Product: the JuicyBrains Innovation 
Community. This is another unique 
tool allowing clients to engage 
with an online community of 
consumers who have a shared 
interest in innovation, and to tap 
into the feedback of more creative 
consumers. 
BrainJuicer has conducted 
research in 54 countries 
representing 90% of the world’s 
research spend. At the beginning 
of 2008, we had offices in three 
countries, the US, UK and Holland; 
these are the first, second and 
13
th
 largest research markets and 
accounted for 42% of the world’s 
research spend. To materially 
increase the share of spend and 
number of multi-national clients, 
we need to expand the geographic 
office coverage to service the 
regional buying points of multi-
national clients. During 2008, 
we expanded into Switzerland 
where many multi-nationals have 
their European head offices and 
also into Australia, via a licensing 
agreement with a well established 
Australian market research firm, 
bringing our coverage to 45% 
of the world’s research spend. 
Since the year end, BrainJuicer 
has expanded further, with an 
office in Germany and a licensing 
agreement in Canada, the 
third and sixth largest research 
markets, increasing our coverage

to 57% of the world’s research 
spend (ESOMAR Global Market 
Research Report 2008).  We are 
now well-represented in Europe, 
North America and Australasia  
and will be looking at moving into 
Asia and South America in the 
coming years.
All of our research is online, 
conducted via our proprietary 
software platform and therefore 
scalable. Nevertheless, we do 
also require highly skilled teams 
of market research professionals 
to design each client project, 
to extract the key conclusions 
from the results and to help our 
clients apply them to their product 
development and marketing 
challenges. In 2008, we hired 
15 new people (excluding 
replacements) of whom 80% were 
client facing. The Company is an 
exciting and challenging place to 
work, and we are very pleased 
to have attracted a team of high 
calibre staff to meet these needs.
Profitability,  
growth and risk
We have managed to grow our 
business, while at the same time 
growing profits and remaining 
cash positive. We have also been 
able to start paying dividends 
demonstrating the Company’s 
ability to be both high growth 
as well as dividend yielding. 
Geographic expansion does dilute 
profit margins with the setting up 
of new offices and hiring of people, 
but the investment is small and we 
look to make a profit within three 
years, as previously achieved in 
Holland and the USA. To achieve 
our ambition of becoming a top 
ten global research agency, we 
need to continue our international 
expansion. This inevitably brings 
risks and we will maintain a 
cautious approach to our financial 
arrangements. We intend to 
continue to grow organically, in 
the main, and we will not look to 
borrowings to do so.
Ownership
Our shares are fairly tightly held 
and there is currently only a small 
free-float:
John Kearon: 43.8% • 
Unilever Ventures: 37.8% • 
Management: 4.2% • 
Institutions and private investors: • 
14.2%
I am committed to building 
substantial long-term value for 
shareholders and have every 
intention of retaining a major stake 
in the business for the foreseeable 
future. I am motivated by building 
a business I passionately believe 
can be a top ten global research 
group and building a team capable 
of achieving this.
Unilever Ventures invested in 
2003 and it was their support that 
enabled the Company to develop. 
However, as a venture capital unit, 
they have a need to recycle their 
capital to support new businesses 
and, in due course, they will sell 
their holding. We hope that the 
new shareholders we will acquire 
at the time will be attracted by our 
long-term potential and will stay 
with us for many years.
Prospects
The impact of the global economic 
recession on our clients’ market 
research spend this year, and 
any consequent effect on the 
Company, remains to be seen. 
Nevertheless, in 2008 we 
weathered the downturn well, 
and are expecting to build on last 
year’s achievements and deliver 
further progress in 2009.

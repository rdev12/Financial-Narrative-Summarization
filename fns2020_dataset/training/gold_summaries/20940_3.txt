There is no doubt that this has been a challenging year for 
the City, however, the second half of our financial year has 
reflected an improvement in market conditions and the Board 
is satisfied with the overall results. We have a strong balance 
sheet and have generated cash and improved profitability. We 
closed the year with a cash balance of £10.5 million.
Current market conditions represent a significant opportunity 
for the business to grow. We have continued to recruit high 
calibre staff in all areas of the business. We continue to increase 
market sector coverage as part of our strategy for growth. The 
withdrawal of a number of investment banks from the small 
and mid cap markets has provided opportunities for the Group 
to not only recruit staff, but to also win corporate clients and 
gain market share; capitalising on these opportunities is a key 
aspect of our growth strategy. 
Trading since our year end has been satisfactory. While 
volumes in the market have been low we have seen a number 
of corporate transactions complete and we have a satisfactory 
pipeline of new business subject to market conditions. For the 
year ended 31 October 2009 the Board has decided to invest 
within growth areas of the business and to take advantage of 
such opportunities rather than pay a final dividend. We believe 
this policy will be of long-term benefit to our shareholders.
Finally, I would like to thank all staff and clients for their 
commitment to the business.

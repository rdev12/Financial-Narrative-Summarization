‘ OUR DEEP UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE FRAGMENTED MARKETS 
IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND 
OUR ABILITY TO OFFER TOTAL 
SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE 
QUANTIFIABLE BENEFITS TO 
OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE ONCE 
AGAIN CONTRIBUTED TO 
OUR SUCCESS.’
RESULTS
Although there were signs of improving macroeconomic conditions  
in some of the countries in which we operate, the market conditions 
in many of our sectors remained challenging throughout 2013.  
I am therefore delighted to be able to report an excellent set of 
results for 2013. 
Group revenue increased to £6,097.7 million (2012: £5,359.2 million), 
an increase of 12% at constant exchange rates, due to organic 
growth of 2% combined with the impact of acquisitions.
Operating profit before intangible amortisation and acquisition 
related costs was £414.4 million (2012: £352.4 million), up 16%  
at constant exchange rates, with the improvement in the Group 
operating margin being driven by both organic growth and the  
impact of acquisitions. Adjusted earnings per share before 
intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs and the vending 
disposal were 82.4p (2012: 70.6p), an increase of 15% at constant 
exchange rates. 
Positive currency translation movements, principally in the US dollar 
and euro, which were partly offset by adverse exchange rate 
movements elsewhere, increased the reported Group growth rates 
by around a further 2%.
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 22.4p. This brings  
the total dividend for the year to 32.4p, up 15% compared to 2012. 
Shareholders will again have the opportunity to participate in our 
dividend reinvestment plan.
STRATEGY
We have continued to pursue our consistent and proven strategy of 
developing the business through organic growth, consolidating our 
markets through focused acquisitions and continuously improving  
the efficiency of our operations. Once again this has resulted in 
another successful year of growth for the Group.

We achieve our organic growth by applying our resources and 
expertise to enable customers to outsource to Bunzl the purchasing, 
consolidation and distribution of a broad range of goods not for 
resale. By doing so our customers are able to focus on their core 
business more cost effectively by achieving purchasing efficiencies 
and savings, freeing up working capital, improving their distribution 
capabilities, reducing carbon emissions and simplifying their 
internal administration. 
Acquisition activity continued at a similar pace to that seen in 2012.  
In addition to completing in February 2013 the purchase of Vicsa 
Brasil, which we agreed to acquire in December 2012, we made  
11 acquisitions in the year. The committed spend in respect of these 
11 acquisitions was £295 million, adding annualised revenue of over 
£280 million. Having pursued our strategy consistently over many 
years, we have built leading positions in a variety of market sectors 
across the Americas, Europe and Australasia. 
INVESTMENT
Investment in the business to support our growth strategy and 
to expand and enhance our asset base is an ongoing process. 
During the year, we have continued to improve existing warehouses 
and open new ones. Upgrading our IT systems is also an important 
task as we integrate new businesses into the Group and increase the 
functionality and efficiency of our existing operations.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
We continue to emphasise the requirement for high standards of 
business practice and sustainable operating processes throughout 
the Group. Bunzl has collected and analysed environmental 
performance data from across the businesses for a number of years. 
As the Group has grown, the collation of this data has become more 
complex and therefore we have, for the first time, obtained external 
independent assurance of our CO
²
 emissions and fuel usage data.  
We have also continued to review and enhance our policies and 
procedures to ensure that we remain compliant with changing 
practices and legislation and over the last year have focused  
on further understanding our waste stream and working with  
our suppliers to ensure compliance with recently introduced  
timber regulations.
EMPLOYEES
A key differentiator of Bunzl is its long serving and loyal workforce. 
We believe that this is, in part, due to our decentralised organisation 
structure. This structure allows our people to understand easily 
their responsibilities and gives them the space to operate efficiently 
and effectively. We very much appreciate their consistent high levels 
of service, performance and hard work. As Bunzl continues to grow 
by acquisition, we benefit from new ideas and collaboration between 
our employees from across the world to improve our customer 
service and introduce more innovative products to our customers.
BOARD
Ulrich Wolters, who served as a non-executive director from 2004, 
retired after the Company’s Annual General Meeting in April 2013.  
We thank Ulrich for his significant contribution over many years. 
Jean-Charles Pauze and Meinie Oldersma were appointed as 
non-executive directors in January and April 2013 respectively.  
Based in Paris, Jean-Charles is presently Chairman of Europcar  
and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of CFAO Group and was 
Chairman and Chief Executive of Rexel for 10 years until 2012. Prior  
to that he held a number of senior positions with PPR Group, Strafor 
Facom Group and Alfa Laval Group in France and Germany. A Dutch 
national, Meinie was Chief Executive of 20:20 Mobile Group from  
2008 until earlier this month and previously held a variety of senior 
positions with Ingram Micro, most recently as Chief Executive  
and President of their China Group and Managing Director of their 
business in Northern Europe. Both Jean-Charles and Meinie have 
extensive international experience across a range of distribution  
and service sectors, particularly in Europe and Asia, which is already 
proving to be of great value to Bunzl as we expand and develop.

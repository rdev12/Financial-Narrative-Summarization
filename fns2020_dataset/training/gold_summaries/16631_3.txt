I	 am	 pleased	 to	 report	 a	 stable	 set	
of	 results	 for	 2009	 despite	 trading	
conditions	 that	 have	 been	 more	 difficult	
than	 any	 that	 we	 have	 encountered	
since	 the	 inception	 of	 the	 Company.
Results
Turnover	 reduced	 by	 8%	 to	 £12.8m	
(2008:	 £13.9m),	 although	 the	 regional	
breakdown	 of	 results	 varied,	 with	 North	
America	 faring	 better	 than	 both	 Europe	
and	 Asia.	 The	 relatively	 small	 fall	 in	
turnover	 considering	 the	 harsh	 market	
background	 is	 evidence	 of	 the	 strength	
of	 Vero	 Software’s	 recurring	 revenues.
EBITDA	 (earnings	 before	 interest,	 tax,	
depreciation	 and	 amortisation)	 increased	
by	 10%	 to	 £2.0m	 (2008:	 £1.8m),	
helped	 by	 cost-saving	 measures	 taken	
during	 the	 year.	 Operating	 profit	 was	
24%	 lower	 at	 £0.83m	 (2008:	 £1.09m)	
and	 profit	 before	 tax	 was	 34%	 lower	
at	 £0.6m	 (2008:	 £0.9m),	 the	 reduction	
due	 mainly	 to	 increased	 amortisation	
and	 exceptional	 depreciation	 on	 the	
write	 down	 of	 a	 property.	 Fully	 diluted	
earnings	 per	 share	 were	 1.94p	 (2008:	
2.27p).
There	 was	 an	 overall	 tax	 credit	 of	
£132,000	 (2008:	 £75,000	 charge),	
largely	 due	 to	 R&D	 tax	 credits	 received	
in	 Italy.
The	 earnings	 and	 profit	 figures	
mentioned	 above	 are	 stated	 after	
exceptional	 costs	 of	 £201,000	 which	
were	 incurred	 during	 the	 year.	 These	
included	 redundancy	 costs	 and	 the	
exceptional	 depreciation	 relating	 to	 the	
property	 write	 down.
The	 Company	 completed	 the	
refinancing	 of	 its	 UK	 loans	 in	 December	
2009,	 raising	 £2.0m.	 This	 was	 used	
to	 repay	 the	 Group’s	 outstanding	
balances	 with	 Fortis	 Bank	 and	 to	
improve	 working	 capital	 levels	 to	
pre-recession	 levels.
Offer
On	 16	 September	 2009,	 the	 Company	
announced	 that	 it	 was	 in	 talks	 which	
may	 or	 may	 not	 lead	 to	 an	 offer	 for	
the	 Company.	 Discussions	 with	 more	
than	 one	 party	 subsequently	 followed	
and,	 at	 the	 time	 of	 going	 to	 press,	 the	
Company	 is	 pleased	 to	 report	 that	
negotiations	 are	 now	 at	 an	 advanced	
stage	 and	 it	 expects	 to	 be	 able	 to	 make	
an	 announcement	 within	 the	 next	 week.	
There	 can	 however	 be	 no	 certainty	 that	
an	 offer	 will	 be	 made	 nor	 as	 to	 the	 terms	
on	 which	 any	 offer	 might	 be	 made.
Outlook
2009	 was	 the	 most	 serious	 market	
downturn	 for	 the	 Company	 since	 its	
formation	 in	 1988.	 It	 has	 weathered	
many	 recessions	 in	 that	 period	
and	 maintained	 a	 growing	 outlook.	
The	 severity	 of	 the	 2009	 downturn	
was	 countered	 by	 strong	 recurring	
revenues,	 the	 use	 of	 technology	 as	 a	
prime	 mover	 in	 reducing	 costs	 and	 the	
growing	 requirement	 on	 customers	
during	 harder	 times	 to	 produce	 new	
models	 of	 their	 products.
Although	 there	 are	 some	 signs	 of	
recovery	 in	 Europe	 and	 China,	 many	
of	 our	 major	 markets	 remain	 cautious,	
with	 2010	 investment	 forecasts	 in	
mould	 and	 stamping	 technologies	
remaining	 at	 similar	 levels	 to	 last	
year.	 Initial	 2010	 trading	 reflects	 this	
continuing	 lack	 of	 market	 confidence.
The	 efforts	 of	 the	 long	 serving	 staff	 of	
Vero	 Software	 remain	 of	 paramount	
importance	 for	 our	 success	 and	 they	
have	 proved	 themselves	 yet	 again	
within	 the	 extreme	 environment	 of	
2009.	 The	 board	 of	 Vero	 (the	 “Board”)	
would	 like	 to	 take	 this	 opportunity	
to	 thank	 them	 all	 for	 their	 focused	
contribution	 during	 the	 year.

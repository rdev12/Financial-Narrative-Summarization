Chairman’ s Message
Results
The results for the year show that
three key objectives were achieved:
sales recovered as our decision to
cease trade loading was vindicated;
costs were reduced in both the
product supply and Group overhead
areas increasing pre-exceptional
operating profit by 52 per cent to
£82 million; and significant free cash
flow was generated, enabling the
dividend to be maintained and fully
covered for the first time since the
merger with Scholl in 1 998.
Our sales in the year grew five per
cent to £624 million, our gross
margin grew to 58 per cent and our
operating margin, before exceptional
items, achieved our target of over 
1 3 per cent. Earnings per share 
were 1 3.1 pence compared 
to a loss of 7 pence last year .
Dividend
Y our Board is recommending 
an unchanged final dividend of 
8.4p, making a total for the year , 
also unchanged, of 12.3p. The final
dividend will be paid on 4 September
2003 to shareholders on the register
on 8 August 2003.
Strategic Development
During the year , the Board completed
a thorough review of the Group’ s
operations, its strengths and
weaknesses, and its opportunities 
for delivering shareholder value
growth in the future. On the basis 
of the review, we concluded that
shareholder’ s interests would best 
be served by focusing resources on
our Consumer healthcare businesses,
which includes the Durex and Scholl
brands, and by divesting our Medical
business, as well as our industrial
gloves business.

We have now completed our second full year 
as a new management team and I am pleased 
to report excellent progress in returning the Group 
to financial health and in developing our strategy 
for the future, based on the strength of Durex, 
Scholl and our other Consumer healthcare brands. SSL International plc

Directors
In April, Andrew Slater , who became 
a Director in 1999 following the
merger with London International
Group, resigned from his position 
as Managing Director of the
European operations. Andrew 
had been with the Group for nearly
21 years and has held a number 
of senior operational roles in the 
UK and overseas; his contribution
and energy will be missed and we
wish him well in the future.
In May , Alain Strasser our Non-
Executive Director resident in France,
resigned from his non-executive post,
recognising that a recent increase 
in his other international activities
meant that he could no longer give
sufficient time to his duties at SSL.
Alain’ s experience and counsel was 
of great value to the Group and 
he goes with our best wishes 
for future success.
Outlook
The current year presents the twin
challenges of completing the major
disposals and driving forward the
profitability and growth of our
Consumer business. This will involve
both highly creative marketing and
selling and major cost reductions in
corporate overheads. The new year
has begun satisfactorily and we are
confident that these challenges will
be met successfully , in both the
current year and into the future.

Chairman’ s Message continued
The Medical portfolio includes 
Regent surgical gloves, Hibi antiseptic
and the wound management
business; collectively amounting 
to £1 82 million in sales in the year 
to 31 March 2003. This divestment
process is now well underway and
has generated a substantial level 
of interest.
Completion of these disposals will
give management the opportunity 
to focus on the Consumer business.
Here, there are encouraging signs
that the increased flow of new
products backed by strong
advertising is yielding results. 
Greater financial resources resulting
from the divestment will drive 
further development. This, coupled
with a continuing strong focus 
on cost control will, we believe, 
lead to significantly enhanced
shareholder value.

Reﬁning and  
Marketing – India
See p14
The Vadinar reﬁnery had a throughput 
capacity of 17 . 1 mmtpa in the 15 months 
ended 31 March 2012. Having completed 
its phase 1 expansion (March 2012) and 
optimisation (June 2012) projects, it is now 
India’s second largest single-location 
reﬁnery, with an annual capacity of  
20 mmtpa, or 405,000 bpd, up from 
14.7 mmtpa/300,000 bpd previously, 
and a complexity of 1 1.8, up from 6. 1 
previously. This puts the Vadinar reﬁnery 
amongst the most complex reﬁneries in 
the world. The Vadinar reﬁnery can now 
process a heavier crude diet and produce 
higher value, high-quality products, which 
will lead to increased reﬁning margins.

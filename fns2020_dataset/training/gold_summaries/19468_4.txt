We continue to build sustainable momentum in driving the business 
forward. We delivered a 48% increase in underlying adjusted 
operating profit and a 56% increase in adjusted earnings per share 
underpinned by Chain achieving its 10% RoS threshold target. 
The generation of £5.3m of free cash flow from organic activities 
represents a significant step change from over a decade of organic 
cash consumption.

Executive summary 
The year was marked by a number of 
further self-help successes building on 
the significant achievements of last 
year. As a result, we have delivered a 
48% increase in underlying adjusted 
operating profit against a background 
of mixed macro-economic conditions in 
our operating geographies.
Underlying revenue increased by 2.0% 
for the Group as a whole. In Chain, 
Europe, the Americas, China and India 
all delivered growth while underlying 
Australasian revenues were marginally 
down by 0.1%. The weak commodity 
dependent Australian market was 
almost entirely offset by strong growth 
in South East Asia.
In Torque Transmission underlying 
revenue fell 1.1% although the second 
half was more encouraging with a small 
rise of 2.0%. Torque Transmission also 
contributed to lowering our breakeven 
point by cutting overheads by £0.8m. 
The complex project to reduce excess 
capacity in our Chain division saw 
completion of the closure of the 
Bredbury facility soon after the end of 
the last financial year. We successfully 
moved the production with a minimum 
of disruption for our customers and 
exceeded our business retention target 
of 90%. Offsetting this gain were 
additional transitional costs incurred in 
recipient sites for Bredbury production. 
In order to minimise disruption to 
customers, we incurred excess labour 
and freight costs which more than 
offset the gains from retaining the 
majority of our revenue. The excess 
costs were managed out of the business 
in the second half of the year and so we 
expect the lasting annual gains from 
the closure project to be approximately 
£3.8m, some £0.6m better than our 
original estimate. 
Our Strategic Plan, STEP 2020, has been 
developed to take us through the next 
five years. The origins and significance 
of STEP 2020 are discussed in more 
detail in the Q&A session with Robert 
Purcell, our Chief Executive, on pages 24 
and 25. 
In summary, adjusted operating profits 
are now 133% higher than two years 
ago when we started to implement our 
three-phase Plan. Adjusted earnings per 
share have more than trebled over the 
same period. 
This clearly emphasises the value 
generation that is available through our 
self-help measures. STEP 2020 sets 
out detailed, unit specific self-help and 
growth initiatives which will deliver 
sustainable margin gains as we move 
to deliver our new medium term goal of 
mid-teens operating margins by 2020.

+1 5 . 0 % In the year to 31 March 2008 operating profit
rose by 25.8% to £16.5 million (2007: £13.1million)
with earnings per share increasing by 25.9% to 28.7p
(2007: 22.8p). All four operating divisions contributed
to this growth.The closing order book was 16.3%
higher at £31 1 .8 million (2007: £268.2 million) despite
a fall in order intake to £228.1 million (2007: £245.7
million). Operating cash flow was particularly strong
with net operating cash inflow of £19.3 million
(2007: £9.7 million) equal to 1 16.8% of operating
profit (2007: 73.4%).
The Group maintains a strong order book providing
good visibility for the operating businesses. We are
confident in the future growth of the business and
are investing accordingly.The lower order intake
this year was primarily due to the peaking of Qatar
LNG carrier orders in gas systems in the prior year.
The Group continued its track record of innovation
and maintained its leading position in its principal
market sectors. A significant increase in research
and development expenditure has maintained the
pace of new products being offered to customers
and broadens further the opportunities for growth.
This success has enabled us to maintain our
progressive dividend policy.Y our directors are
recommending a final ordinary dividend of 5.29p
per share which, if approved, would result in a 15%
increase in the total dividend declared in respect of
the year to 7 .94p per share (2007: 6.90p). Subject to
shareholders’ approval the final dividend will be paid
on 21 July 2008 to all shareholders on the register
on 27 June 2008.
Joe Oatley joined Hamworthy as Chief Executive
on 3 September 2007 . Joe, together with the board
and the senior executive team, has carried out a
detailed review of strategy.The result of this review
will sharpen our approach to internal and external
business processes whilst developing further the
theme of growth by market led innovation. We are
confident that the Group can achieve consistent
long-term earnings growth through extending its
presence in growth markets, developing its people
and improving operational performance. We will also
seek to acquire businesses at appropriate valuations
where these contribute to our strategic objectives.
The Group takes seriously its responsibilities to
the environment. Its principal sites are now
compliant with Environmental Standard ISO 14001
and its technical product innovations help customers
to reduce the impact of their operations on the
marine and offshore environment with emission
and discharge control and safe handling of
hazardous substances.
We recognise the critical role that our employees
play in the Group’s success. Our ability to recruit,
retain and develop our people is an important part
of Hamworthy’s strategy. On behalf of the board
I thank all employees for another year of significant
achievement and look forward to their involvement
in the next stage of our future growth.
The Group increasingly seeks to develop products
and systems for long-term growth markets.
The breadth of those opportunities and balance
across a number of sectors should mitigate exposure
to cyclical demand in individual sectors. With a proven
ability to design, develop and provide innovative
products and systems to those markets and a strong
future order book, the board is confident that the
Group’s strategy will result in continued growth.

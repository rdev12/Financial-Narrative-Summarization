Allocate at a glance
As the leading provider of specialist workforce optimisation, and 
assurance software and services we are enabling our customers  
to manage and optimise large, multi-skilled workforces in complex, 
fast changing environments. Our competitive advantage lies in our 
specialist expertise combined with extensive market experience 
all underpinned by tried and tested technology deployed in 12 
countries across both public and private sector organisations. 
Healthcare continues to underpin growth
At Allocate we continue to innovate, deliver greater value 
to our customers while ensuring our efficiency is continually 
improving. This year we’ve seen a significant increase in the 
number of renewing customers taking advantage of the 
Allocate Cloud service. In addition to making HealthRoster 
V10 easy to run, the service makes it easy for customers 
to make the migration from their current version, allowing 
Allocate to take responsibility for the majority of the 
planning, implementation and deployment processes 
thereby significantly reducing transition timescales and 
costs. The service delivers more speed, more simplicity, 
easier access and predictability of costs into the future, 
thereby improving financial transparency. 
During the year Allocate commenced deployment of our 
new safe staffing solution enabling care staff to dynamically 
assess the level and skill set of staffing required to meet 
patients’ actual needs using mobile devices – SafeCare. 
SafeCare supports organisations in meeting their own safe 
staffing ambitions, while at the same time enabling them to 
better meet national requirements. It is a unique end-to-end 
software solution that captures and reports on safe staffing 
to support every stage of healthcare workforce planning 
and delivery process.
SafeCare is not only architected to be delivered from the 
Allocate Cloud, it will be sold on an annual licencing basis. 
This helps customers by enabling them to plan more 
efficiently for the software and services their organisations 
are so reliant upon. The benefit for Allocate is an increase 
in the predictability of our recurring revenue over future 
periods.
* Repeatable revenue is defined as recurring 
revenue plus term licence revenue  Allocate Software plc

Healthcare
Allocate’ s largest and fastest growing sector, 
with over 360 healthcare customers across 
11 countries, is where we witness first hand 
the effects of changing operational models, 
evolving legislation, increasing demands on 
staff and financial pressure.
HealthSuite enables organisations to address 
these issues by optimising people, processes, 
performance and assurance, freeing time for 
healthcare professionals to focus on improved 
outcomes for their patients. 
Defence
Allocate’s industry leading DefenceSuite 
is designed to meet the complex and 
changing requirements of modern defence 
forces. With the ability to plan, cost and 
deploy complex forces scenarios across 
changing theatres of engagement, 
DefenceSuite has now been deployed in 
numerous defence organisations including: 
the British Army, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, 
NATO, the Royal Australian Navy, the 
Australian Army and the Royal Australian  
Air Force.
Other commercial
Allocate continues to derive revenue from 
sectors which are required to manage 
workforces with complex shift and 
capability requirements. Historically this 
mainly consisted of Maritime and Offshore 
engineering customers, however, the 
acquisition of Time Care and RosterOn have 
brought a broader customer base including, 
security services, transport, mining, retail, 
education and government.

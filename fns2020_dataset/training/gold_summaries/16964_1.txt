 6 Weatherly International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
This has been a year of significant 
progress for the Company as we 
developed our assets in Namibia; 
at Tschudi we moved ever closer to 
production while the performance 
of our two producing copper mines 
at Otjihase and Matchless, known 
as our ‘Central Operations’, has 
been enhanced as a result of 
the changes we introduced.
These assets will take Weatherly 
one step closer to achieving its 
medium-term goal of establishing a 
business producing approximately 
25,000 tonnes of copper annually. 
The development of Tschudi will 
help us deliver this as we work 
towards its first production of copper 
during the second quarter of 2015.
Financial
In the year revenues were down 
from US$35.6m to US$32.2m. Actual 
contained copper tonnes shipped 
rose from 4,485 tonnes to 4,590 
tonnes but the average sales price 
went down from US$8,273 per tonne 
to US$7,397 per tonne. While this 
was a reduction on the previous year 
we benefitted from copper hedges 
as the average spot price over the 
period was US$7,014 per tonne.
As the copper price has reduced 
the Board has chosen to run down 
its hedges and the Company is 
now unhedged on both commodity 
price and currency. The Board 
regularly reviews this policy.
The lower copper prices received 
reduced the gross profit to US$0.6m 
compared with US$4.4m in the 
previous year resulting in an overall 
loss of US$5.7m compared with 
US$1.6m in the previous year.
Production costs in Namibia were 
on a similar level year-on-year. The 
C1 cost for the year was US$6,729/
tonne (2013, US$6,532) Costs 
outside Namibia were reduced 
from US$2.6m to US$2.1m.
At the end of the year, inventory 
with a sales value of US$8.8m was 
still awaiting shipment compared 
to US$5.4m at the previous year 
end. We only record a sale when the 
concentrate is aboard ship although 
the sales price is agreed when the 
concentrate reaches Walvis Bay, 
the port in Namibia, and our off-
taker pays us a loan equivalent to 
95% of the agreed sales price. This 
is netted against the sales revenue 
due when the ship departs port.
Working capital increased from 
US$18.5m to US$23.2m during the 
year. Inventory increased due to stock 
at Walvis Bay while cash increased 
predominately as a result of cash 
holdings on the Tschudi project. If 
this is excluded, year-on-year cash 
was similar on a like-for-like basis.
During the year we raised US$4.6m 
net of expenses from equity raises. 
In December we raised US$1.7m 
from a placement to shareholders 
at 3p per share and in June, 
Logiman, the project manager 
of the Tschudi project, invested 
US$2.9m at 3.95p per share.
In November 2013 we received 
our first drawdown against our 
loan with Orion Mine Finance to 
build the capital infrastructure for 
the Tschudi project. The Tschudi 
project loan is for US$80m with a 
US$8m over run facility (Tranche 
C). At year end we had drawn down 
US$47.8m of the facility and invested 
US$44.0m into the project.
Orion Mine Finance also assumed 
the existing loan from Louis 
Dreyfus which stood at US$3.9m 
at 30 June 2013. This loan has 
been reduced during the year by 
US$2.5m to US$1.4m at year end.

Central Operations
The output from our two underground mines for 
the year was 5,086 tonnes of copper (2013, 5,182 
tonnes) and this is summarised in the table below:
2013/14 2012/13
Ore Treated (t) 290,081 299,680
Grade (%) 1.88 1.86
Recovery (%) 93.11 93.10
Copper Concentrate (t) 20,994 22,477
Copper Contained (t) 5,086 5,182
The Company’s annual production of 
5,086 tonnes was similar to last year 
despite a concerted effort to boost 
production in the second half of the 
year. Production in our final quarter 
(the three months ending 30 June 
2014) of 1,507 tonnes was the highest 
achieved to date since the mines were 
reopened in 2011. This performance 
would equate to an annualised rate 
of over 6,000 tonnes of copper.
The Company’s unit cash cost (C1) 
for the year was US$ US$6,729/
tonne. Once again, I would draw 
shareholders’ attention to the 
final quarter of the year when we 
achieved the lowest cost level for 
the last two years. Management 
believes that the improvements 
highlighted below should help us 
take Central Operations towards 
our target production of 7,000 
tonnes of copper per year.
accountability throughout the 
organisation. The Company is now 
working on restructuring salaries 
to incorporate a larger productivity-
based component which is also 
linked to increased training and 
certification. Plans are underway 
to open a mining school based 
around the development heading 
to Hoffnung Fault West. Skills 
development remains the single most 
important building block in improving 
productivity on a sustainable basis.
Mobile Equipment Reliability
Much of the equipment used to 
reopen the mines in 2010 was rebuilt 
at the time and, four years on, had 
become increasingly difficult and 
costly to maintain, especially in an 
environment where maintenance 
skills are at a premium. The 
Company’s response has been to 
invest heavily in key new equipment 
and in this respect the Company 
added three new trucks, two new 
scoops and a rebuilt drill jumbo 
during the latter part of the year. 
Accompanying this has been 
a programme of rationalising 
and rebuilding the remaining 
equipment to optimise the fleet.
A number of expatriate mechanics 
were employed on a temporary 
basis to help train and improve 
maintenance practices at both 
underground mines. Training 
Increasing Efficiency at 
Central Operations
It had become clear to your 
management that Central Operations 
was not sustainable unless 
productivity was improved and 
costs reduced and that we had to 
effect major changes to achieve this. 
This was done by targeting three 
specific areas, manning levels and 
skill requirements, equipment and 
reliability and mining methods.
Manning and Skills
The first step was to bring the 
mining functions in house where 
we would have more control over 
performance and safety. The 
changeover from contract mining to 
owner mining went well and resulted 
in a 67% productivity increase. It 
also provided the opportunity to 
reduce management layers and 
establish better discipline and

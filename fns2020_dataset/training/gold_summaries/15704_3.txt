 Chairman’s statement
2 Tibbett & Britten Group plc Annual report and accounts 2002
The Group made good underlying progress in more uncertain trading
environments and, despite a poor European summer, saw a welcome
improvement in second half year trading. As over 70% of our turnover
derives from North American and UK markets, we are less exposed to
the difficulties of the major Euro zone countries.
Furthermore, our strategic
focus on consumer related
sectors, coupled with long
term contractual relationships,
has proved more resilient than
transactionally based network
and industrially related
operations. The stability and
focus of the Group are
providing real competitive
advantage.
Over 75% of growth was
organic, with all regions
increasing turnover. We
achieved a strong rate of
contract renewal and added
£212m of annualised revenue
from new contract start-ups.
Free cash ﬂow increased by
over 70% from the previous
year. In addition, a number 
of legacy issues were
successfully resolved and, in
Mexico, Dimalsa was acquired
in March and is being
successfully integrated into
the Group. 
Despite the strength of
sterling, the North American
business contributed 40% 
of operating proﬁt. The UK
achieved a good second half
performance despite increased
insurance costs. Mainland
Europe, whilst growing
substantively, was impacted
by poor performances,
particularly in France and
Poland. 
Outside our core markets 
of Europe and the Americas,
the emergent international
operations, including China,
delivered a third successive
year of improvement in
turnover and proﬁt. In March
we were proud to receive 
the Queen’s Award for
International Trade initiative 
in recognition of the Group’s
success in translating its skills
into overseas markets.
Financial results
In the year ended 31
December 2002, at constant
exchange rates, turnover was
up 11% to £1.52bn (2001 –
£1.35bn) and operating proﬁt
down 3% to £35.3m (2001 –
£37.4m). Adjusted earnings
per share of 38.7 pence 
(2001 – 43.1 pence) were
correspondingly lower and
also impacted by the increase
in the headline tax charge.
The Group’s operations
remain strongly cash
generative with operating
cash ﬂow of £74.6m (2001 –
£73.6m). Free cash ﬂow,

after the payment of interest,
taxation and dividends,
improved by £13.5m to
£32.1m. After investments 
in Dimalsa and David’s of
Thailand, year end net debt
was £67.2m (2001 – £54.1m).
The free cash ﬂow, plus
existing borrowing facilities,
continue to provide a platform
for sustainable investment.
Dividend
The Board is recommending 
a ﬁnal dividend of 17.4 pence
per Ordinary share (2001 –
16.8 pence) for the year ended
31 December 2002, to be 
paid on 28 May 2003 to
shareholders on the register
at 2 May 2003. The interim
dividend of 7.9 pence 
per share was paid on 
11 November 2002. This brings
total dividends for the year 
to 25.3 pence (2001 – 24.4
pence), up 4%, and marks 
the seventh successive year
of increase. 
Organisation and people 
The Board has been
restructured, with a smaller
Corporate Board addressing
strategy and corporate
governance, and an enlarged
Operating Board under 
Mike Arrowsmith running 
the operations. 
As a consequence of these
changes, Martin Graham 
and David Musgrave have
resigned from the Corporate
Board to concentrate on their
responsibilities within the
Operating Board. Mike Evans,
after 28 years, retired at the
end of the year and, on behalf
of all his colleagues, I should
like to thank Mike for his 
long contribution in building
today’s robust and successful
business. I also welcome
Saad Hammad, who joined us
in February 2003 to lead the
European team.
These changes will enhance
our focus on the strategic
development of the business
and reinforce the development
of customer partnerships.
Tibbett & Britten remains
dependent on the
commitment, skills and
experience of over 38,000
people in 34 countries. 
I should like to pay tribute
again to their achievements,
enterprise – not least
resilience – and acknowledge
with gratitude the support 
so freely given.
Outlook
Generally, this year has
started positively, despite
weak volumes in mainland
Europe. There is some
evidence that deferred
outsourcing projects have
been reactivated and we
expect continued growth 
in our major markets, despite
the current political and
economic uncertainties.
New logistics opportunities
are inherent in extended
supply chains as the
accelerating global migration
of manufacturing and the
development of trans-national
retailing gathers pace. As 
a result of our sector
concentration on consumer
markets and our strategic
geographic presence, we are
particularly well placed to
exploit these opportunities.
Our business strategy, built
primarily on organic growth,
has enabled the Group to
develop successfully in North
America and mainland Europe
with limited capital
commitment. This process 
is now being replicated in
China and other international
markets.

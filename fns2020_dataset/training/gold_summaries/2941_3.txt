Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our performance
Section 03 – Our performance
In view of the Group’s strong performance in 2008 and positive
prospects for 2009, the Board is recommending a final ordinary
dividend for 2008 of 8.9 pence per share, making the total
dividend for 2008 13.0 pence, an increase of 18 per cent on the
total paid in respect of 2007 (11.0 pence). The final dividend 
for 2008 will be paid on 19 June 2009 to shareholders on the
register at close of business on 24 April 2009.
Delivering such a strong performance in 2008 while successfully
integrating the Alfred McAlpine business is testimony to the
quality and commitment of our people. On behalf of the Board 
I should like to thank all our employees for the outstanding
contribution they have made to Carillion’s success in 2008. 
Roger Robinson has decided to retire from the Board and as 
a Director of the Company at the Annual General Meeting 
on the 6th May 2009. Roger joined the Board in 1999 when
Carillion was launched as an independent company, following 
its de-merger from Tarmac plc, where he had served in a number 
of senior positions. Roger has played a major part in Carillion’s
development and success and is widely respected throughout 
our industry, in which he intends to maintain an active interest. 
He leaves the Board with our grateful thanks and very best 
wishes for the future.
With the wider economic background expected to become
increasingly difficult, delivery of our business objectives will
become more challenging. However, Carillion is a well-balanced
and resilient business, with a robust balance sheet, a £20.4 billion
order book and strong market positions. Therefore, the Board
continues to expect the Group to deliver materially enhanced
earnings in 2009.

Revenue, including Joint Ventures
(1)
increased by 32 per cent to 
£5.2 billion (2007: £4.0 billion), primarily due to the acquisition 
of Alfred McAlpine in February 2008.
Underlying profit before tax
(2)
increased by 55 per cent to £157.5
million (2007: £101.8 million) and underlying earnings per share
(2)
grew by 19 per cent to 34.3 pence per share (2007: 28.9 pence),
reflecting both revenue and margin growth.
The Group’s balance sheet remains robust, with underlying cash
flow from operations of £198.3 million (2007: £135.7 million)
again well ahead of underlying profit from operations of £165.2
million (2007: £101.2 million). Net borrowing at 31 December
2008 was £226.7 million (2007: £44.9 million), considerably 
better than our year-end target of £300 million. The increase 
in net borrowing since December 2007 reflects a number of
investments made during the year, the largest of which was the
acquisition of Alfred McAlpine.
This acquisition represented a major step in Carillion’s strategic
development by creating the UK’s largest support services business
and significantly increasing the Group’s overall strength and
resilience. The benefits of the acquisition continue to exceed our
expectations, with integration and re-organisation cost savings 
now expected to increase by 67 per cent from our original target
of £30 million per annum to an annual run rate of £50 million by 
the end of 2009. Absolute savings were £15 million in 2008 and
are expected to be £35 million in 2009 and £50 million in 2010.
At the year end, the Group had a forward order book of 
£20.4 billion (2007: £16.0 billion) with the increase due to the
acquisition of Alfred McAlpine and to organic growth. In addition,
the Group had a pipeline of probable new orders at the year end
worth some £3.1 billion (2007: £3.6 billion).
(1) Continuing operations 
(2) Continuing operations before intangible amortisation, 
impairment of other investments, curtailment gain,
restructuring costs and non-operating items. 
Carillion continued to perform strongly in 
2008 and has once again delivered substantial
earnings growth. This has been achieved in an
increasingly challenging economic environment
and reflects the success of the Group’s strategy
in creating a strong and resilient business.

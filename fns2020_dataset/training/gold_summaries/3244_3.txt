Chairman’s Statement
Business Transition
There has been major progress in all aspects 
of the business during the year. The Group 
has made substantial technical advances 
and has expanded its commercial 
relationships. The platform technology  
has been developed from a 1kW stack  
to a fuel cell module, suitable for a range of 
market applications including an integrated  
wall-mountable Combined Heat and Power 
(CHP) Unit. The fit-out of a new Product 
Facility has been completed, and the planning 
of our first mass manufacturing facility  
(‘Mother Plant’) is under way. These various 
advances form the basis of Ceres Power’s 
transition towards becoming a high growth 
product business.
Our relationship with British Gas has continued 
to develop, with all milestones achieved to 
date on the residential CHP programme.  
The most recent announcement of the 
demonstration of an integrated wall-mountable 
CHP Unit, with the Ceres fuel cell module at  
its heart, has shown that the Group has the 
capabilities required to design and build a 
product appropriate for the UK and overseas 
markets. The CHP Unit runs off mains natural 
gas and utilises existing water, gas and 
electricity connections, ensuring that it will  
be straightforward to install. The focus is now 
on value engineering the CHP Unit and the 
scale-up of core manufacturing processes.
The CHP Unit is capable of generating 
electricity and all of the hot water and central 
heating required for a typical UK home, 
thereby substantially reducing CO
2
 emissions 
through the more efficient use of resources. 
The fuel cell technology at the core of the  
Unit can deliver high efficiency operation  
on multiple fuels, including mains natural  
gas, LPG, hydrogen and biofuels. With 
increasing political and industrial interest  
in the development of micro-generation,  
the widespread uptake of residential fuel  
cell CHP units would lessen the need for 
investment in power stations and electricity 
grid infrastructure.
EDF Energy Networks has awarded the Group a 
contract worth £0.6 million to design, build and 
evaluate energy security products for the UK 
residential market. The programme is expected 
to deliver initial prototype units for evaluation in 
2008 and 2009. The product is designed to 
provide reliable back-up electricity from cylinder 
gas and has wide applicability in developed 
countries and in the developing world.
The physical expansion of the Group 
continued with the completion of a new 
Product Facility on the Crawley site. The 
facility will enable us to validate volume 
manufacturing processes before transfer  
to a mass manufacturing fuel cell plant on a 
separate site and to build prototype products 
for field trials. Detailed planning for the Mother 
Plant is currently being carried out. It is 
expected that commissioning of this new 
facility will begin in 2008 and that it will 
become operational during 2009. 
Industry Leadership
The Group continues to play a leading role  
in placing fuel cells and micro-generation on 
the UK’s energy agenda. We were extremely 
pleased to welcome Gordon Brown, the British 
Prime Minister, to our Crawley operations, 
where we outlined the potential benefits of the 
widespread uptake of our CHP products. CERES POWER HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007

Financials
The Group delivered a strong financial 
performance during the year. Income for the 
year ended 30 June 2007 totalled £1.67 million 
(2006: £1.38 million) of which interest on 
cash balances provided £597 ,000 (2006: 
£630,000). Income from private and public 
sector contracts totalled £1,068,000 (2006: 
£746,000), which represents an increase of 43% 
over the previous year, and the first time that 
contract income has exceeded £1 million.
Investment in the Group’s capabilities  
is reflected in the increased operating 
expenditure (before share-based payments 
charges) which rose by 25% to £5,777,000. 
This was a result of the recruitment of 
experienced personnel and the depreciation  
of additional equipment. The adjusted loss  
for the year (before share-based payments 
charges) increased by 16% to £3,696,000 
(2006: £3,180,000) and the reported loss was 
£4,866,000 (2006: restated £3,781,000). 
The Group’s liquidity position continues to 
be robust with £11.1 million in cash and short 
term investments as at 30 June 2007. The net 
cash outflow for the year was £2.9 million  
(2006: £3.0 million).
The Group has adopted the newly  
introduced accounting standard FRS 20, 
‘Share-based Payment’. This is in line  
with current reporting standards and has 
changed the Group’s accounting policy  
with respect to equity-settled share-based 
payments provided to employees under  
the Group’s share option scheme. This  
has resulted in a charge of £1,170,000 in  
the current year and a prior year charge of 
£601,000 for the year ended 30 June 2006. 
These charges had no impact on the Group’s 
cash flow or net assets.
People
Ceres Power has continued to build  
its experienced and highly motivated  
team, with a recent focus on personnel  
with manufacturing expertise to build  
production capability. 
In addition, we were extremely pleased to 
welcome Brian Count as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Group in March 2007. Dr Count 
was Managing Director of National Power  
in the UK and Chief Executive of Innogy plc.  
He provides valuable insights into the nature 
and workings of electricity markets, utility 
companies and government policy.
The philosophy of the Group has always  
been to consider every employee as a  
valued member of the team, with an equity 
stake in the business and with the opportunity 
to develop a satisfying and rewarding career.  
I wish to thank each of them for their important 
contributions to the enormous progress that 
has been achieved.

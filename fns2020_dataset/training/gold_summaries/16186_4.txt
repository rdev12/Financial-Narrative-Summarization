12 TUI Travel PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2012
The political climate 
As a global organisation, we feel the impact 
of government regulation in all of the 
markets in which we operate. Some of our 
activities, such as those undertaken by our 
airline, are heavily regulated. Many of our 
lawmakers, particularly in Europe, are 
becoming increasingly focused upon 
measures to protect customers.
The policy of our political and regulatory 
affairs team is to seek to engage with 
legislators at an early stage in relation to  
all of those areas of regulation that might 
have a material impact upon the way we  
do business. Our focus is always to work 
with governments to bring forward 
legislation that is fit for purpose, is no more 
burdensome on industry than it needs to 
be and does not discriminate between 
different business models. 
Our engagement with the European 
institutions has been particularly important 
over the last 12 months as we seek to 
achieve a proper balance between the 
aviation industry and the customer in the 
area of passenger rights. This will also 
remain an area of focus in the coming 
12 months.
The work of the European institutions in 
relation to the revision of the European 
Directive on Package Travel also continues. 
We are confident that the European 
institutions are convinced of the need for 
reform and will bring forward a proposal  
in the first quarter of 2013.
Over the last 12 months, Eurozone 
countries have had to come to grips with 
austerity measures placed on them by 
national governments, some more severe 
than others. We continue to monitor the 
developments across the region and do not 
expect this to have a major impact on our 
business. The good relationships we have 
with our suppliers and the flexibility in our 
business model means we are well 
positioned to deal with any eventuality. 
Aviation taxation also remains on the 
agenda as governments across the world 
look for ways to increase revenue. Our role 
is to remind them of the importance of the 
travel and tourism industry as a driver for 
growth.
In the UK, the debate on airport capacity 
continues. We will take a full part in that 
debate as it develops in order to ensure 
that the specific requirements of leisure 
airlines and passengers are fully 
understood.
Both segments are being driven by high 
growth in online bookings and, while the 
uncertain economic environment has had 
an effect on consumer travel spending 
habits, demand for leisure travel remains 
strong.
Our business models (see How we do it: 
Business models section) aims to cater 
to these trends – individualisation and 
commoditisation – to best serve the 
changing needs of our customers. We 
consider individualisation to be the Tour 
Operator market and commoditisation 
as the Online Accommodation market.
The sustainability challenge
Travel and tourism accounts for 9% of 
global GDP*. The industry will continue  
to be one of the world’s fastest growing 
sectors, with emerging economies in 
particular seen as engines of such growth 
and the UNWTO expecting international 
tourist arrivals to exceed 1 billion in 2012. 
Travel and tourism today is responsible for 
9% of global employment* but also for 5% 
of global carbon dioxide emissions**. From 
a sustainable development perspective this 
poses a challenge – the growth of an 
industry highly dependent on fossil fuels 
and biodiversity in a world of finite natural 
resources.
Our businesses have been facing up to this 
challenge for over a decade. For TUI Travel, 
responding to these issues means bringing 
sustainability centre stage, to build on the 
efficiency and resilience of our business 
and the services it provides. Our 
Sustainable Holidays Plan is a major step 
forward for TUI Travel in our journey 
towards providing special travel experiences 
whilst minimising environmental impact, 
respecting the culture and people in 
destinations and bringing real economic 
benefit to local communities. See our 
Sustainable Development section for more 
information.

The Market
The economic environment
The global economic recovery has slowed 
down over the past six months. In addition 
to the Eurozone crisis and the unrest in  
the Middle East and North Africa, growth  
in a number of major emerging market 
economies has been lower than previously 
forecast. The IMF projects real GDP growth 
worldwide at 3.5% for 2012. Growth is 
expected to be driven by emerging and 
developing economies which are forecast  
to expand by 5.6% in 2012. In comparison, 
advanced economies are expected to grow 
by only 1.4%.
Our two largest source markets, the UK 
and Germany, are expected to grow by 
0.2% and 1% respectively in 2012. Within 
the Eurozone, the unemployment rate 
currently stands at 11.4%, up 120 
percentage points from last year. Compared 
to other Eurozone countries, both Germany 
and the UK have withstood the economic 
crisis in the Eurozone with unemployment 
at just 5.5% in Germany and 8.1% in the 
UK.
The economic outlook for 2013 seems 
more positive with real GDP growth 
worldwide projected at 3.9% driven by the 
expansion of both advanced and emerging 
markets. While advanced economies are 
forecast to grow at 1.9%, emerging and 
developing economies are projected to 
expand by 5.9%.
The leisure travel market
Demand for international tourism remained 
strong in 2011 with international arrivals 
growing by 4.6% compared to 2010. The 
percentage increase was slightly below 
2010 (7%), driven primarily by economic 
factors coupled with unrest in the Middle 
East and North Africa, which were the only 
regions to record a decline in arrivals, -8% 
and -9% respectively (UNWTO).
Europe, home to the majority of our core 
markets and accounting for over half of all 
international arrivals worldwide, together 
with Asia, were the fastest growing regions 
globally.
The travel and tourism market continues  
to experience a clear polarisation of 
demand. On one hand, we have customers 
who demand individualisation, i.e. unique 
holidays with bespoke services. On the 
other hand, we have customers who  
are increasingly moving towards 
commoditisation, i.e. flights in combination 
with hotels with minimal levels of 
differentiation.

Market	 Size	
&	Coverage
Our	Footprint
Our 10 core markets, including the UK, Sweden, 
Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, 
Poland, Switzerland and Canada, account for £405bn  
of global travel spend (Euromonitor). Our four largest 
source markets of the UK & Ireland, Germany,  
France and Sweden make up 70% of this spend.
Due to the niche nature of Specialist & Activity 
businesses, it is hard to quantify total worldwide 
spend on these holidays but their geographical  
reach and popularity continues to rise.
The total Online Accommodation market accounts 
for £82bn of global travel spend. 
The Accommodation Wholesaler market accounts 
for £15bn of this spend with the Accommodation 
Online Travel Agent (OTA) market accounting for 
the remaining £67bn. 
Our Group’s addressable market in the 
Accommodation OTA segment (including UK and 
Asia-Pacific focus markets) makes up £7.5bn of the 
total OTA market.
Market	 Growth
Our core markets are projected to grow at a 3% 
CAGR over the next five years. The mainstream 
holiday market remains resilient and has actually 
seen resurgence in a tough economic environment.
Online Accommodation is the fastest growing 
segment of the travel market and is expected to 
grow at a CAGR of 7.5% over the next five years.
Our	Positioning 	
We are the number one tour operator in Europe 
with strong positions in each of our core markets. 
In addition, we have market-leading positions in a 
number of specialist segments with a portfolio of 
unique holidays, unrivalled product knowledge  
and superb customer experience.
Our Accommodation Wholesaler business 
(Hotelbeds and Bedsonline) is the market leader  
in the B2B space. 
With our Accommodation OTA business we are 
positioned strongly in the UK (LateRooms.com)  
and Asia-Pacific (AsiaRooms.com) and have recently 
established ourselves in the Latin American market 
through the acquisition of MalaPronta.com, Brazil’s 
fourth largest online accommodation OTA.
Key	Trends	& 	
Future	Outlook
Customers are increasingly moving towards online 
channels to fulfil their travel needs and we expect 
this trend to continue into 2013 and beyond. We, 
therefore, remain focused on improving our online 
presence, increasing our participation in social media 
and moving towards an online-driven company 
culture.
Demand for unique holiday experiences continues  
to see strong growth and with a diverse range of 
experiences on offer, TUI Travel remains well placed.
Online Accommodation has seen tremendous 
growth over the last few years fuelled by the 
growth in online bookings and supplemented by 
strong demand from the emerging markets. Online 
Accommodation, therefore, remains a key area of 
focus for TUI Travel where we look to consolidate 
our leadership position within the Accommodation 
Wholesaler market and build on our strong position 
in the Accommodation OTA segment.

Strategic overview
How	we	do	it
Strategy
Tour 
Operator
Online 
Accommodation
 Unique holidays – Why is it 
important?
›	 Puts the customer’s needs first and 
foremost.
›	 Provides value added services and 
features which command a margin 
premium over commodity products.
›	 Leads to higher customer loyalty  
and an increase in repeat bookings.
›	 Books early when compared to 
commodity products enabling us to 
manage our capacity and yield more 
effectively.
 What are we doing about it?
›	 Unique holidays form the backbone  
of our Tour Operator strategy.
›	 Our specialist businesses, through their 
unique holiday portfolio, provide 
tailor-made holidays to cater to a wide 
range of customer needs.
›	 In the Mainstream Sector, the levels of 
unique holidays have continued to grow.  
In 2012, they represented 65% of total 
holidays booked, compared to 62% in 
2011. We have clear targets and plans to 
grow the proportion of unique holidays 
across all markets in 2013 and beyond.
 Content Diversity –  
Why is it important?
›	 Customers have an ever-increasing choice 
of destinations to fly to. It is only logical 
that we keep pace and provide our 
customers with an ever-increasing range 
of hotels to complement their flights.
›	 Geographical diversity and reach of our 
content will be the key growth driver 
within the Online Accommodation space.
 What are we doing about it?
›	 Increasing the range and diversity of our 
hotel stock is core to our strategy within 
the Online Accommodation space. We 
want to be able to offer our customers a 
one-stop-shop for their accommodation 
needs.
›	 From FY11 to FY12, our Accommodation 
Wholesaler business has seen a 20% 
increase in hotel inventory. In the same 
time period, our Accommodation OTA 
business has seen a 32% rise in hotels  
on offer.
›	 TUI Travel has a clear strategy of 
continuing to increase its hotel offering 
even further in the coming years with  
a strong focus on emerging markets.
 Brands & Distribution – Why is it important?
›	 Online-driven – Increased online distribution improves our proportion  
of direct distribution, reduces reliance on third party distributors and 
reduces our distribution costs.
›	 Online-driven – The higher the proportion of direct distribution, the 
better we understand our customers and their needs. It provides us with 
tangible and useful information about customer preference. In that sense, 
online-driven also contributes to the success of our unique holidays.  
The more we understand our customer, the better and more tailored  
the products we can offer and directly market to them.
›	 Brands – Having multiple touch points with our customers enables us to 
build stronger brand and product loyalty whilst ensuring that customers 
come back to TUI Travel for another unique holiday experience. Strong 
brands also increase organic traffic to our websites which has a higher 
conversion rate.
 What are we doing about it?
›	 TUI Travel is focusing on being an ‘online-driven’ business providing 
customers with an easy and inspiring online experience. We have widened 
the traditional definition of ‘online’ as a distribution channel to being 
‘online-driven’ which encompasses the entire customer journey; 
dreaming, planning, booking, pre-departure, experiencing and sharing.
›	 Over the past year we have increased our online sales by three 
percentage points across the Mainstream Sector (from 30% in 2011 to 
33% in 2012) and have clear strategic plans and targets in place to drive 
online sales further in all source markets.
›	 Our Specialist businesses leverage a strong brand portfolio offering 
everything from adventure holidays to sailing holidays and private jet 
tours. We are investing in our online platforms to enhance booking  
and search functionality and provide our customers with inspirational 
content to showcase our products.
 Brands & Distribution – Why is it important?
›	 Brand awareness – To be the first place that customers turn to for their 
accommodation needs. Reduces online advertising spend and attracts 
customers directly to our websites.
›	 Distribution – Being an ‘online-only’ business it is critical that we provide 
our customers with an effective and easy-to-use search and booking 
experience.
 What are we doing about it?
›	 Our Accommodation Wholesaler business is the market leader operating 
in over 100 countries with a global distribution presence. The current  
five year plan focuses on leveraging our existing distribution network, 
maintaining growth across Europe and expanding further into the 
Americas and Asia.
›	 In Accommodation OTA our focus is to build on our strong brand 
positioning of LateRooms.com in the UK and expand in the emerging 
markets through AsiaRooms.com across Asia and in Brazil with the  
recent acquisition of MalaPronta.com.
›	 Following the launch of five language sites, AsiaRooms.com launched a 
pan-regional brand development campaign to drive sales and increase 
brand awareness. The campaign, entitled ‘The Right Room for You’, 
focused on the uniqueness of each traveller and their travel preferences 
delivering good results. Traffic growth from Singapore and Malaysia  
grew over 49% and 132% respectively in 2012.

 “Through our global brand portfolio and travel expertise we are focused on delivering leisure travel experiences designed for our 
customers’ ever changing needs.” We	have	two	strong	business	models	that	share	the	same	strategic	drivers.	Our	strategy	differs	depending 	
upon	whether	we	are	talking	about	the	Tour	Operator	or	Online	Accommodation	model.	We	have,	therefore,	set	out	below	why	our	strategic 	
drivers	are	important	for	each	and	what	we	are	doing	about	them	to	ensure	the	long-term	growth	of	our	business.
 Technology – Why is it important?
›	 Online-driven – Critical support structure  
for seamless front-end interaction with the 
customer.
›	 Robust finance and reservation systems to 
support business operations but also to provide 
reliable and actionable management information.
›	 Flexible technological platforms which can  
adapt to changing customer demands.
 What are we doing about it?
›	 Within Mainstream, we are in the process of 
upgrading our web front-end reservation and 
finance systems across all source markets.  
These technology upgrades will provide our 
websites with new search functionalities, 
improved personalisation and richer content  
as well as enhanced mobile capability as our 
customers increasingly research and book their 
holidays on mobile devices.
›	 Our specialist businesses have made good 
progress in consolidating their finance and 
reservation systems to leverage our scale across 
multiple brands and continue on their journey  
of standardisation while balancing the varied 
requirements of the different holiday 
experiences they offer.
 Technology – Why is it important?
›		 Online-driven – Provide market-leading 
technological platforms to support seamless 
front-end interaction with the customer.
›		 Robust finance and reservation systems  
support business operations but also provide 
reliable and actionable management information.
›		 Flexible technological platforms which can  
adapt to changing customer demands.
 What are we doing about it?
›		 Both Accommodation Wholesaler and 
Accommodation OTA businesses are supported 
by effective and efficient IT platforms.
›		 Accommodation Wholesaler operational systems 
are being upgraded and updated in order to be 
able to continue improving its service delivery  
to global customers.
›		 In our Accommodation OTA business we have 
been investing in a new platform to support  
our growth strategy.
 Growth & Scale – Why is it important?
›	 Growth – Consolidating our market-leading 
positions and seizing new growth opportunities 
will be the key driver of success going forward.
›	 Scale – Leveraging our scale and driving further 
cost efficiencies will provide added value to 
customers.
 What are we doing about it?
›	 As Europe’s largest tour operator we are 
leveraging our scale across all source markets to 
consolidate our market-leading position and grow 
the number of customers travelling with us.
›	 Growth in new markets is an important area of 
focus for TUI Travel. Our Russian tour operator 
business has given us a position in this market 
and a platform for further growth.
›	 Our customers demand ‘value for money’  
for their travel spend and we are constantly 
reviewing areas where we can optimise our 
operations and be as cost efficient as possible 
without compromising on customer experience.
 Growth & Scale – Why is it important?
›		 Scale is a critical success factor for any online 
accommodation business.
›		 In a price-driven, lower-margin business it is 
imperative for us to achieve high volumes which 
can be leveraged to gain competitive advantage.
 What are we doing about it?
›		 TUI Travel is a firm market leader in the 
Accommodation Wholesaler market. We have a 
clear strategy of consolidating our market-leading 
position even further by continuing to grow our 
existing destinations whilst accelerating our 
expansion into new markets with particular  
focus on Asia, Latin America and Africa.
›		 Within the Accommodation OTA space we are 
concentrating our growth strategy in attractive 
emerging markets which exhibit the highest 
growth potential in this segment. AsiaRooms is 
now an established and growing brand in the 
Asia-Pacific region. The acquisition of 
MalaPronta.com, Brazil’s fourth largest 
accommodation-only OTA, gives TUI Travel  
a foothold into the fast-growing and lucrative 
Latin American market.
›		 LateRooms is now ranked as the number two 
accommodation-only OTA in the UK market.  
We aim to continue delivering superior growth  
by developing new distribution channels and  
new customer segments in this market.
 People – Why are they important?
›		 People are a key differentiator at TUI Travel. It  
is their unrivalled knowledge and expertise that  
is the driving force of our successful business.
›		 Our people are the face of our company. It is 
their ability to delight our customers which 
ensures high customer satisfaction scores  
and repeat bookings.
 What are we doing about it?
›	 Investing in training and development of our 
people to ensure that they have the right skills 
and expertise to provide us with a competitive 
advantage.
›	 Making sure that we work closely with our people 
to drive high levels of pride and engagement 
within the Company.
›	 Our International Graduate Leadership 
Programme continues to attract high quality 
talent from across the world and is considered 
among the best in the industry.
›	 Bi-annual talent reviews ensure that we monitor 
the talent and capabilities within our organisation 
and have clear succession plans in place for 
business critical roles.
›	 Established ‘Centres of Excellence’ which enable 
best practice sharing across the Group and  
make sure that good ideas are not limited to  
one source market but flow through the entire 
organisation.
 People – Why are they important?
›		 People are the key driver of any online business 
where agility, speed and innovation are essential 
elements of success.
›		 Talent retention and acquisition are increasingly 
gaining priority in a market characterised by rapid 
changes and high competition for top talent.
 What are we doing about it?
›		 Building a strong brand proposition to attract 
and retain the best online talent.
›		 Identifying knowledge gaps within the 
organisation and providing colleagues with  
the necessary tools and skills to succeed in 
the online world.
›		 Developing an online-driven culture where 
employees are encouraged to keep abreast of 
latest trends whilst providing an environment 
which fosters new ideas and innovation.
›		 The international nature of our business 
necessitates that we look beyond European 
boundaries when it comes to sourcing talent.  
TUI Travel continues to tap into the vast talent 
pool of markets like Brazil and South East Asia  
to fuel its global growth ambitions.

Our main strategic objective is to continue to improve the Group’s 
profitability and free cash flow and therefore deliver superior 
returns on investment. This improvement will allow us to invest 
further in the future of our business which will benefit our 
customers, colleagues and shareholders.
We target continuous 
improvement in Group ROIC 
and cash conversion of at least 
70% of profit before tax.
To measure our financial progress we have two financial KPIs: (i)  
the return on invested capital (ROIC); and (ii) the conversion of 
underlying profit before tax to adjusted free cash flow. 
ROIC has improved again this year by 0.9 percentage points to 
12.2%. This increase was driven by an improvement in earnings 
during the year and a deterioration in the carrying value of net 
assets resulting from the increasing strength of Sterling.
We generated a cash conversion rate of 75% in 2012. As expected, this 
number has fallen from the prior year due to investments in capital 
expenditure to improve the underlying businesses. We continue to 
target a cash conversion rate of at least 70% going forward.

Our unique holidays form the backbone of our Mainstream 
businesses and are exclusive to us. By increasing our unique holiday 
portfolio we can achieve earlier bookings, higher margins and 
superior customer satisfaction and retention rates. Due to our 
existing brand loyalty and experience in designing and operating 
new concepts it is very difficult for our competitors to replicate 
these holidays.
We are targeting a unique 
holiday mix of 76% as a 
proportion of total Mainstream 
Sector holidays over the next 
five years.
In the year, we increased the unique holidays mix by three 
percentage points across the Mainstream Sector as a whole.  
Within this, the Nordic region improved by five percentage  
points and the UK by four percentage points.
Unique holidays mix as a proportion of total Mainstream  
Sector holidays
2012 65% 2011	62%	 2010	55%
By increasing the direct distribution of our holidays we lower 
distribution costs and can build on our customer relationships. As  
an online-driven business, we have a focus on the online booking 
experience. Increasing our direct distribution leads to better value 
for customers. Customer trends support a shift towards the online 
channel with social media and richer content all helping drive higher 
conversion rates.
We are targeting a direct 
distribution mix of 80% and an 
online distribution mix of 49% 
in our Mainstream Sector over 
the next five years.
To measure our progress, we have two distribution KPIs: (i) direct 
distribution mix; and (ii) online distribution mix.
Direct distribution mix improved by two percentage points over  
the year, with a strong performance by the UK which saw a five 
percentage point increase over the prior year. The improvement  
in direct distribution was driven by the online channel which also 
increased by three percentage points in 2012.

Our objective is to be as cost efficient as possible without compromising 
customer experience. Within Mainstream, we target overheads of less 
than 5% in each source market. We also continue to make cost savings 
in our other Sectors including centralisation of back-office functions 
where appropriate.
We are targeting a further 
£65m of business improvement 
opportunities over the next 
two to three years to be 
delivered in broadly even 
tranches.
We delivered £42m of operational efficiency savings through the 
business improvement programme in the last 12 months. This 
exceeded original guidance given at the start of the financial year. 
We made progress in a number of areas including the restructuring 
within the French and German markets as well as Jet4You.

Our Online Accommodation business enjoys high-margin and growth 
characteristics. We currently have a leading global position in 
Accommodation Wholesaler and strong presence within the UK and 
Asian markets in Accommodation OTA. A combination of organic and 
acquisitive growth will be a key driver of profit growth in this business. 
We are targeting an  
underlying operating  
profit growth of between  
15% to 20% per annum  
over the next five years. 
Accommodation Wholesaler continued to consolidate its global 
leadership position over the year with TTV growth of 13% to £1.4bn. 
In Accommodation OTA, we continued to invest in high-growth 
markets delivering TTV growth of 4% to £447m. This included 
AsiaRooms which delivered TTV growth of 25%.

We are experiencing greater stakeholder interest in sustainability 
and believe that creating more sustainable holidays will help protect 
our product into the future and also support product differentiation, 
brand loyalty, customer satisfaction and competitive advantage.
We are targeting our airlines to 
reduce per passenger carbon 
emissions by 6% by 2013/14 
(against a baseline of 2007/08). 
See Sustainable development 
section.
Four years ago TUI Travel airlines set a relative target to reduce 
carbon emissions by 6% by 2013/14, against a baseline of 2007/08. 
In 2011/12 TUI Travel airlines’ relative carbon emissions were 73g per 
revenue passenger kilometre (CO

/RPK), i.e. 6.3% less than 2007/08 
therefore the six-year target has been achieved within four years.

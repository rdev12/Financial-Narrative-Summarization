 Health and safety
I am disappointed to report three fatalities at our operations 
during 2015. Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees  
is our highest operational priority.
Two of the fatalities were in the East Region and one occurred  
at the Aktogay project. In 2014 we had seven fatalities at the 
continuing operations. There has been a reduction in the  
number of injuries suffered in a year in which man-hours worked 
increased by 78% as we entered a period of intense construction 
at our major projects, bringing a greater exposure to working at 
height, heavy lifting and electrical hazards.
We made significant efforts in improving our health and safety 
performance during the year, seeking to address key fatality risks 
as a matter of urgency. Reviews of our working procedures for 
underground mining, energy isolation and working at height have 
been coordinated by the Group Health and Safety team, working 
directly with site managers to establish new standards. We will 
continue to implement improvements as we seek to create a 
culture of best practice at our new projects to serve as a 
template for our other operations. 
Review of operations 
East Region and Bozymchak
The mines in the East Region and Bozymchak delivered a strong 
operational performance in 2015, achieving the guided range for 
copper cathode output with production of 80.7 kt (2014: 83.5 kt). 
Underlying copper in concentrate output was 89.4 kt, in line  
with 2014 as optimisation works in the East Region delivered 
improved concentrator recovery rates and output from 
Bozymchak ramped up.
In 2015 KAZ Minerals completed its first full year of operations 
following the Restructuring in 2014. I am pleased to report that 
significant progress was made during the year on our major 
growth projects, Bozshakol and Aktogay. In December 2015  
we began the commissioning of the Bozshakol concentrator and 
in February 2016 the project recorded its first production. The 
ramp up of Bozshakol is now underway and the mine will add  
100 kt per annum to production at a first quartile cash cost over 
the first 10 years. The oxide plant at Aktogay commenced output 
in December 2015 and we are progressing on schedule and on 
budget with the construction of the Aktogay sulphide plant.
The Group’s operating mines in the East Region and Bozymchak 
hit their production targets for the year at a net cash cost of 
109 USc/lb, placing them in the first quartile of the cash cost 
curve. This net cash cost was achieved despite weaker by-product 
prices as management delivered operational efficiencies and cost 
savings. Operating costs in US dollar terms also benefited from 
the devaluation of the tenge which occurred from 20 August 
2015. Capital expenditure was tightly controlled, with $68 million 
of sustaining capital expenditure during the year compared to  
our guidance of $80–$100 million, as spend was optimised or 
deferred where possible. 
“Our immediate priorities in 2016 
are the ramp up of Bozshakol,  
the construction of Aktogay  
and to keep operating costs  
low across the Group.”

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW Zinc in concentrate production of 94.3 kt was at the upper end of 
expectations for the year. The Group exceeded its silver granule 
production guidance by 25% with total production of 3,135 koz, 
supported by the mining of higher grade sections, improved silver 
recovery rates and a release of work in progress. Group gold bar 
production of 34.6 koz was in line with guidance issued at the half 
year. The Bozymchak mine accounted for 12.5 koz of gold bar 
production from 17.8 koz of gold in concentrate production, as 
some unprocessed metal in concentrate is carried over into 2016 
due to the timing of shipments dispatched in December. New 
equipment was installed at Bozymchak in the fourth quarter  
of 2015 to optimise production, which will increase copper  
and gold output from the mine in 2016.
Bozshakol construction
On 1 1 December 2015 we announced that commissioning works 
at the Bozshakol sulphide concentrator had commenced with 
production of copper concentrate following in February 2016. 
This major milestone was achieved despite a number of 
challenges faced during the year, including a fire in the main 
concentrator building which damaged equipment in the grinding 
area. There were no resulting injuries and the project team  
was able to recover from this event quickly, using replacement 
parts transferred from Aktogay. The ramp up of production at 
Bozshakol in 2016 will include the completion and commissioning 
of the separate 5 MT per annum clay plant. A review of the 
remaining works has led to a reduction in the project budget  
of $50 million, with the final $270 million of the $2,150 million 
project to be incurred in 2016.
Bozshakol operations
Pre-production mining operations began at Bozshakol in May 
2015 to expose sulphide sections ahead of the commissioning  
of the main concentrator, with 6,567 kt of clay ore and 532 kt  
of sulphide ore removed and stockpiled by the end of the year. 
The sulphide concentrator commenced processing material in 
February 2016, with the first shipment of copper concentrate 
expected to be dispatched to Chinese smelters in March 2016.
Aktogay construction
Construction of the oxide section of the Aktogay project  
was completed in December 2015. The construction of the 
sulphide plant has also progressed well during the year, with the 
foundations for the primary crusher and conveyor now complete. 
The external cladding of the sulphide concentrator building was 
installed ahead of the onset of cold weather so that construction 
could continue inside the building throughout the winter. The 
assembly of the mills and the installation of flotation cells are now 
ongoing. Parts and equipment have been delivered to replace the 
items that were sent to Bozshakol to assist with fire repairs and 
the sulphide section of the project remains on track to commence 
production in 2017. Capital expenditure of $280 million is 
expected in 2016 following the agreement with NFC to defer 
$300 million of construction costs to 2018.
Aktogay operations
Pre-production mining operations commenced at Aktogay in June 
2015. By the year end, 3,003 kt of oxide ore had been mined and 
placed on pads. Leach irrigation began on 26 September 2015  
and on 1 December 2015 the project produced its first copper 
cathode in the SX/EW processing facility. The cathode from 
the oxide operations is of high purity. 
Production outlook
East Region and Bozymchak copper production will benefit  
from a full year of contribution from the ramped up Bozymchak 
project in 2016; however, this will be offset by the expected 
closure of the Yubileyno-Snegirikhinsky mine during the year  
and ventilation shaft maintenance works at Orlovsky in the 
second half. The Group therefore expects to produce 70-75 kt  
of copper cathode from its East Region and Bozymchak mines. 
Zinc production will decline to 70-75 kt of zinc in concentrate  
as mining at Artemyevsky moves through a low zinc grade zone 
ahead of its mine extension project and as output from Orlovsky 
is reduced due to mine maintenance. Silver granule production  
is expected to reduce to 2,250-2,500 koz due to lower grades  
at Irtyshsky and the maintenance works at Orlovsky. East Region 
and Bozymchak gold bar production is expected to increase  
to 40-50 koz as the optimisation works at Bozymchak raise  
overall throughput. 
The Bozshakol mine is expected to produce 45-65 kt of  
copper cathode equivalent and 50-70 koz of gold bar equivalent, 
dependent on the speed of ramp up. We expect to declare  
the project commercial during 2016 which is considered to  
be operating at in excess of 60% of design capacity for three 
consecutive months. 
At Aktogay the oxide operations are expected to ramp up  
quickly to capacity, producing 15 kt of copper cathode in 2016.
The total aggregate Group copper cathode equivalent production 
in 2016 is therefore expected to be between 130 and 155 kt and 
Group gold bar equivalent production is expected to be between 
90 and 120 koz.
Financial performance
Revenues declined in 2015 to $665 million (2014: $846 million) 
largely as a result of lower metal prices in 2015. 
Sales from own production were 78.6 kt, below production levels 
due to a build-up of finished goods inventory at the end of the 
year and the exclusion of 0.9 kt of sales volumes from Bozymchak, 
which occurred during the pre-commercial production phase in 
the first half of the year.
16 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2015
STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED The Group’s cash costs were reduced in 2015 following 
management actions taken in the East Region operations  
and the devaluation of the tenge from 20 August, which further 
contributed to lowering the cash costs in US dollar terms during 
the final four months of the year. Net cash costs benefited  
in 2015 from the contribution of Bozymchak, which has a high 
gold by-product credit and achieved full year net cash costs of 
40 USc/lb. By-product credits fell as a result of lower zinc, silver 
and gold prices and a reduction in zinc and silver production 
compared to the prior year. 
Gross cash costs for the East Region and Bozymchak in 2015 
were 230 USc/lb, a 17% reduction compared to the gross cash 
cost of 277 USc/lb in the second half of 2014, during which period 
the East Region began to operate as a stand-alone business. Net 
cash costs for the East Region and Bozymchak operations were 
109 USc/lb, in line with the 107 USc/lb reported for the second 
half of 2014. In 2016, per unit gross cash costs in the East Region 
and Bozymchak are expected to face upward pressure due to  
a full year contribution from Bozymchak (which has higher gross 
cash costs), reduced production volumes and local inflation. 
However, the full year effect of a weaker tenge in 2016 is 
expected to result in a gross cash cost for the East Region  
and Bozymchak of between 200 and 220 USc/lb.
Following the movements in the exchange rate of the tenge 
against the US dollar we have reviewed the unit cost guidance  
for our major growth projects. The guidance provided  
is a 10 year average (in 2016 terms) and the benefit from the 
weaker tenge is partially offset by lower by-product pricing  
and future inflationary pressures. Bozshakol is now expected  
to achieve net cash costs of 70-90 USc/lb and Aktogay  
100-120 USc/lb.
EBITDA (excluding special items) of $202 million declined 
compared to $355 million from continuing operations in the prior 
year as the lower costs in 2015 were not sufficient to offset the 
impact of reduced metals prices. 
Sustaining capital expenditure was limited to $68 million as some 
investments were carried forward into 2016. Despite the lower 
revenues, the reduction in costs and management of sustaining 
capital expenditure led to a Free Cash Flow before interest of 
$2 million in 2015.
Sustaining capital expenditure in 2016 is budgeted to be between 
$80 and $90 million for the East Region and Bozymchak. 
Expansionary capital expenditure of $20 million is planned for 
2016 at the Artemyevsky mine in the East Region to continue  
the development of a new section of the mine.
Financial position
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had significant committed 
liquidity, including $1,251 million of gross funds and $250 million  
of undrawn debt facilities. The Group’s net debt position was 
$2,253 million at the year end. The recent commencement of 
production at Bozshakol has expanded the financing options 
available to the Group.
Outlook
Having commenced production from both of our major growth 
projects, our immediate priorities in 2016 are to expedite the 
ramp up of Bozshakol, to progress the construction of Aktogay 
and to keep operating costs low across the Group. We are 
confident in the medium-term outlook for copper due to both 
industry supply challenges and future demand growth, with 
copper an essential part of a greener economy. KAZ Minerals  
is positioned to deliver the highest production growth in the 
sector from its portfolio of first and second quartile assets.

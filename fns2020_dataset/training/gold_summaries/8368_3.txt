Chairman’s Statement
Results 
I am pleased to report that Intertek delivered excellent 
results in 2008 and ended the year with a revenue 
figure of £1,003.5m, up 29.4% over last year. 
Excluding acquisitions, revenue growth was 22.5%. 
 
Operating profit was £147.9m, up 27.4% over 
last year. Adjusted operating profit increased to 
£164.7m, up 35.4%. Our adjusted operating 
margin increased by 70 basis points to 16.4%. 
Excluding acquisitions, adjusted operating profit 
grew by 28.4%. 
Acquisitions
We continued our successful track record of making 
infill acquisitions. In 2008 we acquired 14 new 
businesses for total consideration of £79.5m (2007: 
£100.0m). Details of the acquisitions are given in 
the Operating Review by division and in note 26 to 
the financial statements. To date in 2009, we 
have completed two further acquisitions for initial 
consideration of £21.5m which further widen the 
scope and range of the services we offer. Additional 
consideration of up to £5.6m is payable dependent 
on future financial performance. We intend to 
continue prudently investing in new opportunities 
in our chosen industry sectors.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 59.5p, up 27.4% over 
last year and diluted adjusted earnings per share 
were 67.1p, up 37.5%.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 7.1p per share (2007: 5.8p) 
was paid to shareholders on 18 November 2008. 
The Directors will propose a final dividend of 13.7p 
per share at the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 
2009, to be paid on 19 June 2009 to shareholders 
on the register at close of business on 5 June 2009. 
If approved, this will make a full year dividend of 
20.8p per share (2007: 18.0p), an increase of 
15.6%. This is in line with our dividend policy and 
reflects the good performance of the Group. 
The Board 
Other than the previously announced appointment 
of Mark Loughead to the Board on 1 January 2008, 
there were no changes to the Board during 2008. 
Mark’s appointment further strengthens the depth 
of experience on the Board. Biographies of each of 
the Board members are set out on pages 32 and 33.
Intertek Operations Committee
The day-to-day management of the Group is 
undertaken by the Intertek Operations Committee 
(IOC). The IOC currently comprises the three 
Executive Directors, the six Executive Vice Presidents 
who head up the operating divisions and the Vice 
President of Human Resources. Biographies of each 
of the IOC members are set out on pages 34 and 35.

Employees 
Our mission to support and add value for our 
customers is delivered through almost 24,000 people 
across Intertek worldwide. We continue to improve 
our capacity to attract, develop and retain the best 
people who share in the mission, values and success 
of the Group. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to welcome 
all new employees to Intertek and to thank all our 
employees around the world for their commitment 
to making 2008 another successful year.
Environmental impact
Intertek is committed to playing an important and 
positive role with respect to climate change and the 
environmental impact of products and processes. 
We advise our clients, as an integral part of our 
business, on many issues which have an impact on 
the environment, such as the chemical content of 
their products and packaging, the energy efficiency 
of their equipment, CO
2 emissions and the disposal 
of harmful substances and waste electrical products. 
We also provide advisory and consultancy services 
to help retailers and manufacturers design their 
products and services to comply with current and 
future environmental regulations around the world. 
Through our services we help our clients to minimise 
the environmental impact of their products and 
processes for the benefit of society as a whole. 
We are also mindful of our own impact on the 
environment and are working on various initiatives to 
reduce this. This is discussed further in the Corporate 
Social Responsibility Report on pages 63 and 64.
Outlook
Our 2008 revenue growth excluding acquisitions, 
was 12.3% at constant exchange rates. Whilst a 
significant global recession will obviously affect 
our business, our strategy as well as our geographic 
and industry diversification, will help to mitigate 
any adverse impact and provide us with a range of 
opportunities. As a result, we are confident that 
Intertek will continue to grow well in 2009.

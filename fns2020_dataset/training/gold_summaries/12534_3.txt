Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Financial and operating performance
Despite low oil and gas prices in the early part of the year, increased production, supported
by price recovery in the second half, generated sales revenues of US$621.1 million in 2009
(2008: US$655.2 million). Average production for the year rose 21 per cent to 44,200 barrels
of oil equivalent per day (boepd) (2008: 36,500 boepd) taking into account both the
Oilexco North Sea Ltd (Oilexco) acquisition and continuing strong demand in both
Singapore and Pakistan for our gas production.
Operating cash flow after tax was US$347.7 million (2008: US$352.3 million) more than
covering exploration and development investments of US$303.1 million (2008: US$217.3 million).
Two significant acquisitions were completed during the year: Oilexco for US$505 million
and Delek Energy (Vietnam) LLC (Delek) for US$72 million. These were funded by a
combination of new equity (US$252 million), an increase in bank borrowings and existing
cash resources. As a result, pro forma net debt at year-end stood at US$245.4 million (2008:
US$117.3 million – net cash).
Profits after tax were at record levels of US$113.0 million (2008: US$98.3 million) benefiting
from the acquisition of significant UK tax allowances during the year. Operating profits for
the year were US$169.7 million (2008: US$261.7 million).
Oil and gas proven and probable reserves increased to 255 million barrels of oil equivalent
(mmboe) (2008: 228 mmboe). Contingent resources are 213 mmboe (2008: 154 mmboe),
resulting in a 23 per cent increase in reserves and resources to 468 mmboe (2008: 382
mmboe). This included 60 mmboe acquired with the Oilexco acquisition in the UK.
Considerable progress was made in advancing our major development projects. The
wellhead platforms for the Chim Sáo and Gajah Baru projects in Vietnam and Indonesia
respectively are progressing well through their construction phases and the Chim Sáo jacket
will begin moving to its offshore location shortly. Development drilling will commence later
this year on both projects. Our first development project from the Oilexco portfolio, the UK
Huntington field, is also progressing well. We have a number of North Sea projects, in both
the UK and Norway, which are targeted for development approval during 2010.
Our exploration programme in 2009 delivered five successes from nine exploration and
appraisal wells. Notably, this included two successes drilled from our first two wells in
Norway and the Cá Rˆ o `ng –
Do
? -
discovery in Vietnam, which opens up a large and unexplored
area on the Vietnamese/Indonesian border. A series of successful wells on the NW Gemsa
permit in Egypt led to a profitable exit through a sale of our 10 per cent interest in the
block. Our programme of wells in Norway and in Asia continues in 2010.
“Premier offers material and profitable future
growth for shareholders through a reliable and
long-life production base, good quality projects
under development and in the pre-development
phase and an exciting exploration programme,
in areas we know well.” 03
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Our efforts to maintain the highest levels of health, safety and environmental performance
have continued, as supported by our industry leading statistics. In the International
Association of Oil and Gas Producers’ safety performance indicators report, Premier’s
drilling function was ranked number one across the industry for the lowest total recordable
injury frequency. We were also ranked in the top quartile for production operations. We
have retained our inclusion in the FTSE4Good Index.
Shareholder returns
Despite the significant volatility in equity markets and in the price of oil, Premier’s share
price increased by 12 per cent during the year, after adjusting for the rights issue completed
in May. Over the five-year period to 31 December 2009, Premier’s share price has increased
by 109 per cent.
Board change
I was delighted to take over Chairmanship of your company with effect from 15 October
2009. I would like to pay tribute to the achievements and leadership of Sir David John, who
retired after 11 years as Chairman of the company. Premier is extremely well positioned to
grow its production base, engage in further development projects and add material
reserves through exploration. The quality and potential of its asset position is a tribute to
the hard work of my predecessor and the high calibre team here at Premier.

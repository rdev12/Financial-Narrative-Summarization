 “The year has been transformational for the Group as we continued 
to grow organically and successfully integrated ESP , increasing our 
client base by 86% to a total of 801 on its acquisition. Both, the 
Baseball Representation and Sports Marketing businesses grew 
revenues and continued to sign up quality clients, with total clients 
at the year-end having increased to 884. 
Looking ahead, the momentum achieved in 2015 has continued 
into the new year. The events programme has increased to five 
compared to three in 2015, and we have added two new agents 
to the Baseball Representation business which will contribute to 
the future growth of this business. The Board believes that the 
fundamentals of our businesses remain solid and as a result we 
look forward with optimism.”

TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     OVERVIEW AND  
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
The Group delivered strong growth in revenue 
and operating income in 2015 across all seg -
ments, which saw an increase in Group revenue 
of 114% to $44.4 million and Group operating 
income of 68% to $35.0 million, with Headline 
EBITDA of $13.4 million for the pe-
riod, an increase of 49%. Excluding 
acquisitions, revenue, operating 
income and Headline EBITDA grew 
organically by 22%, 22% and 10% 
respectively.
The Group has continued to 
focus on its strategy of delivering 
organic growth from the underlying 
business, coupled with selective 
acquisitions designed to increase 
the geographic and business 
spread of TLA’s services. This has 
seen TLA expand significantly into 
the Australian and UK markets, 
initially through securing the first 
International Champions Cup soccer 
tournament in Melbourne played in 
July 2015 and then by the purchase 
of ESP in March 2015 (subsequently 
rebranded into TLA Australia and TLA UK).
ESP has broadened the Group’s reach and 
services. The acquisition has significantly in-
creased the number of employees and its client 
base, to 158 and 884 respectively at the year-
end (2014: 70 and 474 respectively). TLA’s first 
International Champions Cup had 225,000 fans 
attend the event, held at the Melbourne Cricket 
Ground, July 2015. The tournament was played 
over three matches with Real Madrid, overall 
winners over Manchester City and AS Roma. The 
2016 event is in full preparation with Atlético 
Madrid, Juventus and Tottenham Hotspur coming 
to Australia in July 2016.
With the acquisition of ESP, the Group 
completed its rebrand to TLA and finalised the 
integration of operations along with the use of 
the TLA brand across the Group in Australia, the 
UK and USA. This has allowed TLA to provide a 
seamless service to its clients across the Group’s 
geographies, with the greater scale and co-or-
dination of the Group further highlighting TLA’s 
visibility in the marketplace. 
OUTLOOK
Trading so far in 2016 is in line with the Board’s 
expectations and TLA continue to see good mo-
mentum in the business, including an increase in 
TLA’s events programme in 2016. The fundamen-
tal business drivers in the sports marketing and 
athlete representation industry remain strong 
and baseball continues to enjoy excellent for-
ward visibility with a further $174 million of con-
tracts negotiated in 2015. As a result, the Board 
looks to the future with confidence.

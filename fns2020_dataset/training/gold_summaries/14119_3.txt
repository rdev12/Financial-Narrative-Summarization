Chairman’s statement
jOh N DODDS, CHairman
against the backdrop of a continued challenging  
u K trading environment i am very pleased with  
the Company’s results for the year and with  
its progress and direction. 
Overview
t he year to 31 December 2011 was my 
first full year as a Director with severfield–
rowen and included my appointment to 
the role of Chairman in september 2011.
against the backdrop of a continued 
challenging u K trading environment i am 
very pleased with the Company’s results for 
the year and with its progress and direction. 
Our u K companies are market leaders in 
their respective fields and they work 
vigorously, individually and collectively, to 
sustain the Group’s key competitive 
advantages.
t he Group’s view is that the u K market 
conditions over the coming years will 
remain lacklustre contrasting markedly with 
the increasing and exciting prospects for 
our joint venture company in india.
Results
t he Group has made an underlying 
operating profit of £11.7m (2010: £16.2m) 
on revenue of £267.8m (2010: £266.7m). 
Group profit after tax is £5.8m (2010: 
£7.6m) with basic earnings per share of 
6.52p (2010: 8.58p), both reflecting the 
impact of non-underlying items.
Dividend
Our u K markets remain challenging and 
consequently the Group continues to adopt 
a cautious dividend policy. We recommend 
a final dividend of 3.50p, giving 5.00p for 
the full year (2010: 7.50p) which is 1.6 
times covered by underlying earnings per 
share.
Board Changes
as we announced at the time of our interim 
results in august 2011, i was appointed 
Chairman on 1 september 2011 in 
succession to t oby Hayward, who remains a 
non-executive Director and Chairman of 
the Group’s audit Committee.
earlier in February 2011 Derek randall, 
executive Director for Business 
Development and international including 
JsW severfield structures Ltd in india, 
joined the Group’s Board.
Jonathan rhodes was appointed as 
Company secretary in June 2011.
We were pleased that Chris Holt, formerly 
Chief executive of mJ Gleeson Financial Plc, 
joined us as a non-executive Director of the 
Group in november 2011, succeeding 
David ridley who left his role after nine 
years of valued service.
in response to new and emerging 
opportunities, we continue to review the 
operation of the Board in order to provide 
the Group with the appropriate level of 
support as the shape and scale of the 
business changes.
Our People
Our management teams and employees 
continue to operate very well in challenging 
market conditions, which have now been in 
occurrence for a number of years. t he 
expertise, experience and dedication of our 
people is a major asset of the business and, 
on behalf of the Board, i would like to thank 
them all for their continued support.
During a visit to JsW severfield structures 
Ltd in india in February this year, i was able 
to see the outcome of our joint efforts which 
has resulted in an effective and highly 
motivated team of management and 
employees working in a modern and safe 
environment.
Outlook
notwithstanding the prevailing u K market 
conditions, the Board is confident that the 
business has the talent, ambition and 
resource to achieve its strategic objectives 
both at home and abroad and i am very 
optimistic for its future. 17 OUR BUSINESS 17

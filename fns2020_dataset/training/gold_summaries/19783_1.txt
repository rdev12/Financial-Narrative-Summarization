Chief Executive Officer’s report
Performance 
We achieved a significant transformation of the Ten Alps’  
business over the 12 months under review. We also completed  
a restructuring and refinancing in July 2015. This has  
reinvigorated the business, reduced our debt levels significantly 
and, thanks to new investment,  
enabled us to scale up our media 
business by the acquisition of Reef 
TV . Ten Alps is now one of the  
largest independent television  
production businesses in the UK.
We have set out clear targets  
to return the business to profitability across all units. Although 
we reported a loss of £1.32m for the full year in 2015, the  
business was going through a period of change which put it 
into positive territory in the second half. Our current pace  
of trading gives us a degree of assurance for the 2016  
financial year.
Action has been taken to reorganise underperforming units, 
reduce operating costs and forge a new management culture. 
Overall we are making steady progress in our aim of improving 
operating margins across the businesses. 
Ten Alps operates in markets where there are strong growth 
trends and it is our ambition to achieve consistent growth  
both organically and through targeted acquisitions. 
The Group has become a magnet for commercial and creative 
talent. Significant new recruits include Greg Sanderson, joining 
from a senior BBC role as managing director of Brook Lapping, 
and Annette Clowes, former managing director of Loot, who 
has taken over our Macclesfield-based publishing operations 
and home improvement portfolio.  
Our television business, which now includes Reef TV , is  
securing new commissions at a faster rate and we are  
focussed on growing our international presence in the sector. 
The publishing business has been refocussed around a series  
of simplified verticals where we are creating new revenue 
streams from digital distribution and events. The communication 
unit is expanding its core business in production of digital  
educational content and is starting to build new business  
in content marketing and corporate communications.
Television	–	delivering	engaging,	intelligent	and	 	
entertaining	content	
The TV Division (Blakeway, Brook Lapping, Films of Record) 
improved profits over the prior year and has been enhanced  
by the acquisition of Reef TV, which brings in expertise  
daytime programming and higher-margin 
long-running series. Recent new commissions 
have also enabled Reef TV to diversify genres 
and broadcast customers and develop new 
formatted returnable series. In July 2015 we 
have made a direct investment into Chrysalis 
Vision, a drama start-up pitching for  
long-running series, increasing our overall 
investment over an 18 month period.  
Ten Alps has an option to acquire a majority holding if the  
business is a success. 
We have, we believe, created a solid platform for sustained 
growth and are also laying the groundwork for new revenue  
generation opportunities. There is now a drive to pitch for  
larger-budget, repeatable series across serious factual and  
factual entertainment programming. Another objective will  
be to increase non-UK revenues through co-production  
partnerships, to target growth in royalty revenues through sale  
of current and past catalogues on a more ambitious scale  
and a drive to sell series and formats into other major markets,  
including the US.
The division has performed well with revenues of £10.01m  
(2014: 15mth period £10.73m) and segment EBITDA of  
£0.43m (2014: 15 mth period £0.32m) before allocation of  
plc costs. 
Publishing	-	B2B	and	consumer	content	which	informs	and	
helps	decision-making
In publishing, we have moved well beyond the heavily  
print-based model of the past and are growing a diversified 
revenue base from new websites and from events such  
conferences, awards and seminars. We recently launched the 
Director of Finance Awards, aimed at recognising the most  
innovative, vigorous and dynamic teams and individuals from 
the financial management profession. The inaugural event  
was held on 9 July 2015 to positive feedback.
As the division continues to focuses on higher margin owned 
assets and exiting third party low margin contracts the revenue 
has declined to £8.44m (2014: 15mth period £15.87m). Segment 
EBITDA was a loss of £(0.51m) down from 2014 loss of £(0.73m) 
before allocation of plc costs.

Communication	–	creating	content	that	counts	
We see significant potential in the development of content 
marketing and corporate ‘story-telling’ markets in the UK  
and the aim is to make the Group a bigger player in this  
fast-growing industry. We are now producing branded  
programming and short-form corporate video and are  
engaged with a number of organisations on long-term  
communications planning.
During the year we relocated our London television,  
publishing and communication businesses to new premises. 
The relocation also provided an opportunity to integrate the  
Reef TV business, a move which is already producing cost  
efficiencies and enables us to capture synergies across the 
business; most importantly in sharing digital and social  
media expertise.
The division reported revenues of £1.84m (2014:15mth period 
£2.42m) with segment EBITDA of £0.13m (2014: 15mth period 
£0.15m) before allocation of plc costs.

Outlook	
Trading since the start of the new financial year has been 
encouraging in all sectors of the Group and we are well placed 
to achieve our current objectives, while positioning the business 
for long-term growth as a TV and digital content business.  
The integration of previously disparate business units at a 
single London location has created a new dynamism and is 
facilitating a mix of TV and digital expertise which we believe 
few media businesses can match.

Chief Financial Officer’s report
Financial	Review
We are confident the Group is now moving in the right  
direction. The extensive divisional consolidation  
programme over the last few years has been completed and 
the results are starting to show stability and future growth  
potential. We believe we have stable foundations to build  
upon and see an encouraging new business pipeline.
Revenue from continuing operations for the 12 month period 
was £20.47m (2014:15 month period £29.45m) and gross profit 
was £6.79m (2014: £9.42m). As expected the main variance in  
revenues was in the Group’s publishing, which saw a decrease  
of 32.9% or £4.13m year on year, as the unit continued to 
streamline its portfolio and exit non-profitable, low margin  
contracts. TV increased it revenues year on year from £8.7m  
to £10.01m being 15.1% and Communicate had a small  
decrease of 3.7% to £1.84m compared to £1.91m.
Gross margin increased from 32% to 33.2% in the year, with  
operating expenses representing 36% of revenues (2014: 
35.8%). This is a consequence of significant restructuring  
undertaken by the Group over the last three years and the aim 
is for this figure to drop below 30% by 2015/16. The charge for 
reorganisation and restructuring was £0.12m (2014: £0.33m). 
Adjusted EBITDA equated to a loss of £0.59m (2014: £1.13m). 
Operating loss decreased to £0.82m (2014: £1.99m) after an 
amortisation charge of £0.04m (2014: £0.35m). 
The loss was mainly attributable to one of the four units within 
publishing, which has since been scaled back and refocused.  
All other parts of the businesses were operating profitably  
before allocation of central overheads of publishing and  
plc costs. 
As the Group made overall losses for the year to 30 June 2015 
there was no corporation tax charge in the year. The Group 
reflected no movement in the deferred tax asset for the year 
(2014: £(0.25)m). The asset carried on the balance sheet is 
£0.49m (2014: £0.49m).
For the fifteen month period ended 30 June 2014 discontinued 
operations relate to the Fareham Agency held within  
publishing which was considered a non-core business unit  
and was disposed of in May 2013. The results for the year  
include a gain on discontinued operations of £Nil (2014:  
profit of £0.24m).
Earnings per share
Basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations 
in the year was 0.48p (2014: loss 1.01p) and was calculated on 
the losses for the year attributable to Ten Alps shareholders 
of £1.32m (2014: loss £2.8m) divided by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the year being 276,666,012 
(2014: 276,666,012). 
Statement of Financial Position
Assets 
The Group’s non-current assets comprise of goodwill of £6.9m 
(2014: £6.95m), reflecting no impairment for the year ended 
30 June 2015 (2014: £Nil), property, plant and equipment of 
£0.16m (2014: £0.19m) and deferred tax asset of £0.49m  
(2014: £0.49m). 
Inventories and trade receivables have decreased by £0.48m to 
£3.06m (2014: £3.54m) reflecting the impact of the disposals in 
the previous year and reduction in publishing revenues. Other 
receivables have increased to £1.94m (2014: £1.6m) reflecting 
an increase in accrued income in the year. 
The Group had a cash balance of £1.91m as at 30 June 2015 
(2014: £2.58m). The balance is lower than last year, reflecting 
the unfavourable movement in net working capital in the year 
of £0.88m (2014: £1.87m) and reduced net financing activities  
of £0.25m (2014: £1.25m)
Total assets for the Group were £14.46m (2014: £15.35m).

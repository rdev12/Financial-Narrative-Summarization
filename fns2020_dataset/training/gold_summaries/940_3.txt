Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report that in the second 
year of operation since flotation in March 
2004, ANGLE’s business has progressed 
significantly. The portfolio of Progeny
®
 
companies has been expanded to eleven 
with the addition of three new companies 
in the year. The Progeny
®
 process was 
further validated with the flotation of 
Provexis during the year. 
ANGLE has now moved into the next 
phase of its development, which is to 
scale up and capitalise on its assets  
and opportunities. 
PiPElin E Pa Rtn ERshi Ps
In a major strategic development during 
the year, responding to university 
demand and the changing market  
for intellectual property (IP) 
commercialisation from universities, 
ANGLE has developed and launched  
its Progeny
®
 Partnership programme  
for long term partnership agreements 
with major research establishments. 
Partners see this as a key development 
addressing the critical issue of early 
stage management, which is the primary 
limitation on commercialisation.  
The benefit to ANGLE is certainty  
of access to high quality IP on pre-
agreed terms, reduced costs of IP 
search and engagement with IP 
owners, and the option value of long 
term exclusive agreements.
We are delighted today to announce  
the first Progeny
®
 Partnership, a 20 year 
exclusive agreement with The University 
of Reading which, according to the most 
recent government Research Assessment 
Exercise, has 20 research departments 
rated as 5 or 5*, denoting international 
excellence in research activity. 
The University of Reading has world-
class research departments in 
meteorology, systems engineering, food 
science and plant science. ANGLE is 
already working with the University to 
evaluate opportunities arising from 
these and other areas.
This deal is the first of a number of 
Progeny
®
 Partnership agreements 
providing exclusive right of first refusal 
that we expect to be able to announce 
over the next 18 months.

The combination of our consulting

we expect strong progress in both our 
existing portfolio and our pipeline. 
I would like to thank all members of  
the ANGLE team for their efforts in 
delivering a strong performance in  
our second year as a public company.

 CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
8
Looking back to the start of Burberry’s ﬁnancial year in
April 2008, few could have anticipated the extraordinary
conditions consumer businesses would face during the
ensuing 12 months. Although management was prepared
for a more constrained trading environment, the rapidity,
degree and global scale of contraction in consumer
spending was unprecedented.
Such conditions challenge both management teams and
boards of directors. There is a need to shift to defence –
conserving cash, reducing capital expenditures, eliminating
costs. And I am pleased to report that Burberry did take the
action required, very signiﬁcant action, along these lines.
However, at the same time, we also believe it is the
responsibility of managements and boards to look through
the negative psychology of the time and take a view on
the longer term. We know that Burberry’s strategy has
proven effective and is being well executed. Our ambitions
for Burberry remain high, with much on the agenda
to accomplish. Burberry is still travelling. So, we have
continued to invest in both brand and business during
the year – including stores, product development,
people and infrastructure.
While the external environment was the main determining
factor on this year’s ﬁnancial results, Burberry still achieved
revenues of £1.2bn, a growth of 7% at constant exchange
rates, 21% reported. Operating proﬁt decreased 12% to
£181m, while diluted EPS declined 4% – both of these
on an adjusted basis. After-tax return on capital remained
strong at 23% on an adjusted basis. Accordingly, the
Board has recommended that the full year dividend be
maintained at the prior year’s level of 12.0p.
I would therefore like to thank everyone at Burberry for the
immense contribution made throughout this very challenging
period, and looking forward, I remain conﬁdent that Burberry
possesses the brand, strategy and team to continue
to prosper in the years ahead.

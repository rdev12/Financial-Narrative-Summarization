 Overview of 2013
The Group achieved record results in 2013 
with annual revenue growth of 10%. Proﬁt
before tax grew 25% and earnings per share
26%. Notwithstanding capacity expansion
investments and two small acquisitions, strong
cash generation enabled the Group to ﬁnish the
year free of net debt for the ﬁrst time. Order
books carried forward into 2014 are healthy.
Orders for aviation ﬁltration products grew 
14% in 2013 driven by recent new product
introductions. Nuclear and bioscience orders
were also strong. Sales to environmental
laboratories were up 13%. After a slow start,
revenues from Metals Filtration improved in 
the second half to ﬁnish up 2% for the year.
Several large contracts were announced in
energy markets during the year. These will have
a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial impact on the Group
results through to 2017, with the initial beneﬁts
showing in the 2013 results.
Capital investments were made in 2013 to
expand UK aviation and Chinese manufacturing
capacity. Further such investments are planned
for 2014 in order to support longer term growth.
Plans for investment and future development
In 2013 Porvair achieved two signiﬁcant
milestones. Large contracts were secured 
that will underpin manufacturing activity in
Microﬁltration for at least the next two years 
and strong underlying trading enabled the
Group to ﬁnish the year with net cash on the
balance sheet.
Together these will enable a period of
accelerated investment. In 2014 we plan to
increase capital investment substantially: 
• We intend to consolidate and expand our UK
facilities at New Milton in order to free space
for aviation and industrial ﬁltration growth in
Fareham. Aviation sales have grown strongly
recently and we need more capacity. 
• Following the acquisition of the trade and
assets of Eisenmann Metallurgical LLC in June
2013 we will expand its manufacturing facility
in Caribou, Maine, during 2014 and invest in
production equipment to increase its capacity.
• Having built a new factory at Xiaogan, China,
for Metals Filtration in 2013 we expect to
expand its production capability and capacity
in 2014. 
• We will make further investments in the
production capabilities in the US.
These and other projects will increase expected
capital investment in 2014 to around three 
times its level of recent years. Capacity increases
and equipment upgrades are necessary due 
to the impact that new product introductions
have had on the business. We expect this
capacity pressure to continue, with the 2014
product development pipeline looking promising.
Interesting work is going on in bioscience
ﬁltration, metals ﬁltration manufacturing, water
analysis, nuclear ﬁltration and others.
Encouraging these projects is central to 
Porvair’s business model.
The 2013 results show the early beneﬁts of 
the large contract wins, and these will become
even more apparent in 2014. The contracts in
question are principally those with Posco, the
UK Government and Reliance Industries. All of
which have been previously announced. The
ﬁnancial impact of these contracts is expected
to cause the published results over the next
three to four years to ﬂuctuate more than has
generally been the case.
• Multi-year contracts are recognised under
long-term accounting rules, which means that
revenues are expected to receive a one-off
boost in 2014, causing them to be higher than
the underlying growth rate the Group would
normally deliver. Revenues might then be
expected to return to the underlying levels 
in 2015.
• Proﬁts are recognised only after due
consideration of the potential risks, outstanding
liabilities and warranties on each project. Proﬁt
recognition could therefore be spread over the
period between 2013 and 2017. 
• Net cash inﬂows are expected to arise
principally in 2013 and 2014. Whilst we will
maintain suitable cash reserves against the
possible needs of the contracts, this cash will
be used to re-invest in the business as
outlined above.

 During 2007, Zetex made significant progress 
in executing the group’s reshaped strategy,
increasing market penetration against the
backdrop of a difficult market whilst improving
operational efficiencies.
The group increased product investment targeted
at those areas which promise the best returns, 
and further strengthened its sales and engineering
force to better exploit international markets
particularly in the Far East.
The financial results for 2007 reflect the early
fruits of the hard work that has gone in to
improving Zetex’ financial performance. They 
are a credit to our management team in the light
of the substantial headwinds of difficult markets
and a weak dollar experienced by the group 
during the year.
Group financial results
Revenue for the year was $126.8 million 
(£64.6 million), an increase of 2.2 per cent 
(2006: $124.1 million (£67.2 million)), against 
a market decline in Zetex’ sector of 3 per cent.
Group adjusted operating profit rose to 
£4.0 million (2006: £2.8 million), an increase 
of 43 per cent. Revenues would have been higher
by another $8 million but for one US distributor
going into Chapter 11 and another losing a 
major customer of its own, making these results
all the more creditable whilst still increasing
investment in R&D and sales.
After the share of the profit of the associate, 
net finance income of £0.6 million and adjusted
items of £3.2 million profit, which principally
relates to the disposal of Gem Mill and the 
pension curtailment, group profit before tax 
for 2007 was £7.7 million (2006: £1.6 million).
After a taxation expense of £0.4 million (2006:
£0.9 million credit), the profit from continuing
operations attributable to shareholders was 
£7.3 million (2006: £2.5 million).
Earnings per share was 7.28p (2006: 2.54p) and
7.23p on a diluted basis (2006: 2.52p). Adjusted
earnings per share was 4.13p (2006: 2.59p).
Dividend
On 14 September 2007, the board paid an 
interim dividend of 0.70p per share in respect 
of 2007. At the Annual General Meeting to 
be held on 28 April 2008, the board will be
recommending a final dividend of 1.45p per 
share in respect of the 2007 financial year. This
will be paid on 6 June 2008 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 9 May
2008. The total dividend in respect of 2007
financial year will therefore be unchanged 
from that for 2006 at 2.15p per share.
Board change
Nick Hawkins resigned as a director and CFO 
on 20 February 2008 to take up an opportunity 
to become CFO of a larger company on a 
pre-IPO basis. The board recently announced 
the appointment of Chris Smith as Chief Financial
Officer of Zetex plc with effect from May 2008.
Chris Smith, ACA (age 44), is currently European
Finance Director at Scapa Group plc, an international
adhesive tape manufacturing business. Prior to 
his role at Scapa he held a number of roles at
Courtaulds plc and Akzo Nobel, the international
specialist coatings, fibres and chemicals group,
including seven years based in Germany and 
Hong Kong. Chris brings to Zetex over 15 years 
of senior operational finance experience in a
variety of industries and geographies.
Foreign currency 
The board uses hedging arrangements designed 
to cover unmatched surplus currencies, mostly
relating to US dollars. The hedging arrangements
enabled Zetex to achieve an average rate of 
US$ 1.92/£ in 2007 compared to an average spot 
rate of US$ 2.00/£. Hedging arrangements 
2
Chairman’s
statement comprise forward contracts, collars and options.
The commercially effective hedging policy has
limited the impact of the weakening US dollar on
the consolidated income statement during the year.
The board’s policy on currency hedging 
continues to aim to protect the group in the 
short-to medium-term against exchange rate
movements and to provide a level of currency
certainty for operational purposes.
For 2008 the group has hedged around 
95 per cent of its 2008 net revenues at a rate 
of US$1.97/£.
Further information on the group’s foreign
exchange hedging arrangements can be found 
in the chief executive officer’s business review.
Pension scheme
At 31 December 2007, the Zetex Group Pension
Scheme (the Pension Scheme) showed an IFRS
deficit of £5.2 million (2006: £8.2 million) as
calculated under IAS 19. The Pensions Committee
of the board has been working with the trustees 
of the Pension Scheme to manage the pensions
liability. Following a consultation with employees
and the trustees, the defined benefit section 
of the Pension Scheme was closed to future 
accrual on 1 September 2007. This reduced the
pension fund deficit by £2.2 million. A defined
contribution section of the Pension Scheme 
was opened for future employer and 
employee contributions.
The triennial valuation of the pension scheme 
took place on 5 April 2007 which showed a deficit
of £3.9 million (under the scheme specific funding
measure). Agreement has been reached with 
the trustees on a repayment plan to extinguish 
the remaining scheme specific funding deficit over
the years 2009 to 2012. A special contribution 
of £1 million was made in September 2007 and a
further £1 million will be made in 2008, thereby
reducing the deficit further.
Outlook
Market conditions during 2008 will continue 
to be challenging, in particular in the first half 
as global economic growth is expected to be 
slow. Industry analysts forecasts vary widely but
generally expect that growth in 2008 will occur
primarily during the second half. As a result 
of the significant progress made in repositioning
and strengthening the group, the board continues
to anticipate that market penetration will grow 
in 2008. However, recognising the difficult market
conditions, first half revenues are not expected 
to be significantly ahead of the second half 
of 2007, growth being delivered in the second 
half as conditions improve and new products 
gain traction.

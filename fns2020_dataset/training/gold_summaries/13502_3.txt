 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am very pleased to report 
that the Group delivered 
a strong performance 
in 2013, increasing profit 
before taxation by 30% 
(41%*) against a backdrop 
of mixed global market 
conditions.
Revenue was up 5% (7%*) to £597.7m 
(2012: £567.8m) and gross profit (net fee 
income) increased by 6% (8%*) to £199.2m 
(2012: £188.4m). Operating profit was up 
28% (39%*) to £10.8m (2012: £8.5m) and 
earnings per share increased by 24% to 
8.4p per share (2012: 6.8p per share). The 
Group has further strengthened its balance 
sheet and had a net cash position of 
£18.6m as at 31 December 2013 
(31 December 2012: £11.5m). 
Group headcount currently stands at 2,307 
(2012: 2,233). Our strategy of maintaining 
our office network whilst selectively 
investing in new markets, discipline 
diversification and Resource Solutions 
has ensured we are already benefitting 
from operational gearing as some of the 
Group’s markets have begun to recover. 
The Group now has 53 offices in 
24 countries, having opened 17 offices 
over the last four years. During the year 
we have focused on maximising the return 
from this investment and as a result, the 
Group achieved an increase in recruitment 
productivity of 9% which we expect to 
continue to improve in the current year.
In line with our progressive dividend policy, 
the Board will be recommending a 5% 
increase in the final dividend to 3.86p per 
share which combined with the interim 
dividend of 1.54p per share will result in  
a total dividend of 5.4p per share  
(2012: 5.15p). 
I would like to thank Martin Griffiths, who 
retired from the Board earlier this year, for 
his seven years of service and extend a 
warm welcome to Brian McArthur-Muscroft 
who joined the Board in May. 
Finally, I would like to thank all our 
staff across the globe for their efforts 
this year. Your hard work has once again 
underpinned the success of the business 
and also resulted in us being named 
International Recruitment Firm of the 
Year by Recruitment International.

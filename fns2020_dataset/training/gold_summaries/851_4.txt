Our operations
W e report on a geographic basis. This structure promotes collaboration and so maximises growth opportunities. 
Americas Our largest business unit, 
with the best balance across our 
markets. Our oil & gas business is 
well-positioned; we are a market 
leader in mineable oil sands; a leader 
in consulting and EPCM in mining; 
have good positions in solar and 
bioprocess; and are a leading player 
in the diverse E&I market. 
Europe Principally UK based with 
some activities elsewhere. Strong 
position in oil & gas, with market-
leading position in North Sea 
brownfield activities. Leading position 
in the UK nuclear market, where 
services range from new build right 
through to decommissioning.
Growth Regions We expect each 
of our business units to grow, 
but see Growth Regions as 
having greatest potential. Oil & 
gas in the Middle East is growing 
currently though the Australian 
mining market remains tough.

Oil & Gas
Growth is driven by the 
long-term rise in energy 
demand. Resources are 
becoming increasingly 
difficult to access which 
plays to AMEC’s expertise 
in complex engineering 
and harsh locations.
T echnology is facilitating 
the development of tight 
oil and shale gas.
Mining
General macro 
uncertainty is affecting 
the near-term outlook for 
the mining industry , 
increasing volatility . 
Long-term fundamentals 
remain robust, supported 
by increasing 
urbanisation in emerging 
markets.
Clean Energy
Clean energy provides an 
increasingly significant 
part of the global energy 
mix, its growth driven by 
increasing demand for 
power and environmental 
concerns. AMEC’ s proven 
expertise, depth of 
technology understanding 
and strong customer 
relationships provide 
further growth 
opportunities.
Environment & 
Infrastructure (E&I)
The overall environmental 
consulting and 
engineering market 
includes services 
provided to all four of 
AMEC’ s markets. Our E&I 
market alone consists of 
four sectors: water , 
transportation/
infrastructure, 
government services, and 
industrial/commercial.

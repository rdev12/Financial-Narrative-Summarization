 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S BUSINESS REVIEW FOR OVER 10 YEARS
ROTORK HAS BEEN THE WORLD LEADER IN ACTUATION SOLUTIONS
FOR THE OIL & GAS, POWER AND WATER & WASTE WATER
TREATMENT SECTORS OF THE CAPITAL GOODS MARKET .
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
For over 10 years Rotork has been
the world leader in actuation
solutions for the oil & gas, power
and water & waste water
treatment sectors of the capital
goods market. Our products are
also used in a wide range of
applications in a variety of
industries, including shipboard
control systems, ventilation and 
air handling control. Rotork is a
genuinely global business, with
both marketing and production
operations across the world. 
We are known for our ability to
support customers in the ﬁeld at
very short notice from our own
resources. Rotork has a reputation
for innovative solutions to
complex problems and our
product development history 
has shown a pattern of improving
the efﬁciency, quality and cost
effectiveness of the product
through the application of
technology. This, and a constant
drive to improve customer
support, has lead to us being 
the number one heavy duty
actuator group in the world. 
We are structured around 
three divisions:
Rotork Controls, the original
and largest division supplying
high quality, state of the art
electric actuator products for
controlling industrial valves;
Rotork Fluid Systems, 
which supplies heavy duty
pneumatic and hydraulic valve
actuators for operation in plant
control, emergency shut 
down and other critical
applications, primarily for 
the oil & gas sector;
Rotork Gears, a world leader 
in the supply of gearboxes,
adaptors and ancillaries for 
the valve industry.
Rotork supports customers across
the world mainly through directly
owned operations. We have 14
production plants internationally
and multiple direct sales and
support operations in 22 countries.
This, together with an extensive
network of indirect sales ofﬁces,
gives total coverage of our
customers and markets globally.
We have around 12,000 
active customers. 
The key drivers for the Group’s
businesses relate to investment in
oil & gas, power generation and
water & waste water installations
around the world with demand
being generated by new and
expanded capacity, upgrades to
existing facilities and replacements.
This is often linked to projects
which are aimed at improving 
the efﬁciency, safety and
environmental performance of
plants. Valve actuators are critical
components and their long-term
reliability and performance is
extremely important to users. 
They also act as a key interface
between plant control systems and
related hardware. Rotork’s
reputation for quality, worldwide
support and technical innovation 
is crucial to its leadership position
in the ﬁeld. The broad geographic
spread of our operations and
applications means that we have a
large number of repeat customers
around the world and no one
customer accounts for more than
5% of our revenue in any year.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
The objective of Rotork p.l.c. is to
increase shareholder value by
developing its leadership position
in worldwide valve actuator
activities. The Group’s businesses
are focused on the specialist area
of valve automation. The origins 
of the Company go back to the
1950s and over its 50 years in this
business Rotork has continued to
build on its reputation as an
innovator of new concepts in this
ﬁeld and has provided users with
increasing levels of functionality,
performance and assurance. Our
strategy of providing modern
innovative products that leverage
technology, while remaining
focussed on the technical
applications that our customers
need, has enabled us to provide
quality solutions to the industries
that we serve. We have been able
to do this partly as a result of our
methodology of selling directly to
our end user customers and their
technical advisers. This ensures
that, where possible, plant
speciﬁcations have the correct
products for the application and
support the customer’s need for
plant efﬁciency and control.
ROTORK’S FOCUS ON 
TECHNICAL APPLICATIONS 
THAT OUR CUSTOMERS NEED 
HAS ENABLED US TO PROVIDE 
QUALITY SOLUTIONS TO THE 
INDUSTRIES WE SERVE.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE
29 FEBRUARY 2008 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
The Group’s recent strategy has
focused on opportunities to
leverage our leadership position 
in heavy duty electric actuation
into other closely associated areas
of valve automation. Key
programmes relate to the
development of products and
control systems, marketing
initiatives, creating service revenue
opportunities and driving cost
reductions relating to these
businesses. The most important
current product initiative relates 
to the development of our range
of actuators aimed at the process
control market, which is referred
to further in the research &
development section.
YEAR UNDER REVIEW
In 2007, Rotork celebrated its 
50th Anniversary in style with 
end user and geographic markets
very active throughout the year.
The rate of investment in
infrastructure in energy and water
projects continued to increase
which beneﬁted all three of our
operating divisions. Overall order
intake was up 12.6% and revenue
up 14.0%. The order book
increased to £97.6m which is
28.5% up on the start of 2007.
Proﬁt before tax was up 24.3%.
Return on sales (as deﬁned on
page 11), a key performance
indicator of the business, increased
to 24.3% from 22.3% last year.
ROTORK CONTROLS
Revenue from our electric actuator
division, Rotork Controls, increased
by 11.1% to £164.2m while
operating proﬁt rose by 17.6% to
£43.5m. At constant currencies
these increases would have been
15.4% and 23.7% respectively. 
As a percentage of unit actuator
order input, the principal markets
for electric actuators were: oil &
gas 39% (2006: 40%); water 22%
(19%); power 31% (32%) and
miscellaneous 8% (9%). As can 
be seen the end user markets 
were similar to the prior year but
with an above average increase in
the number of actuators going
into the water market. This 
was driven by growth in the
markets worldwide and improved
penetration in some key markets.
UK Operations
We continued to see good levels
of business emanate from the 
UK, with the water market
beneﬁting from AMP4 investment
requirements laid down by 
the regulator and the power
market from the large Combustion
Plant Directive.
There was a strong sales and proﬁt
performance from the main electric
actuator assembly plant in Bath,
which was assisted by continuing
sourcing initiatives limiting the cost
of component increases. We are
looking for additional initiatives 
in 2008 to continue to mitigate
cost pressures.
Europe
The European sales and support
companies all increased proﬁts
from the prior year, with
particularly strong performances 
in Italy and Germany. Europe
accounted for 16% of the total
input units against 13% in 2006.
Work on existing oil & gas
installations was active throughout
the region; in particular we
beneﬁted from increased
investment in oil and product
storage facilities. Our business in
the water market in continental
Europe also continued to grow,
with our French subsidiary making
encouraging progress. Elsewhere
our relatively new Russian sales
company continued to develop its
business while the Dutch company
doubled the size of its facility to
enable it to expand its factory ﬁt
and site service capabilities. 
The European businesses also
beneﬁted from increased business
from valvemakers in their
territories. The Italian valvemakers,
in particular, had extensive order
books built on the high level of
worldwide energy projects,
particularly those being built in 
the Middle East.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  The Americas
Rotork Controls Inc had a number
of challenges entering 2007, which
included a high hurdle set by its
prior year proﬁt performance, a
softening US$ and an economy
which was displaying weaknesses
in some areas. Against this
background, the company
performed well and continued 
to beneﬁt from investment in
water & waste water treatment
facilities. It also beneﬁted from the
US valve industry’ s competitiveness
on international projects. US
Process Controls saw a good
recovery of its business, mainly
based on improved sales to the
power companies. 
The Canadian company had a
disappointing year, due to slower
than expected project activity,
especially in the West. The
Venezuelan subsidiary continued
to face difﬁcult challenges in what
is potentially a promising market
for our products.
For the Americas, order input in
units increased in total but reduced
to 16% from 17% of the Group.
Asia Paciﬁc and the Rest 
of the World
Asia continued to be a major
engine for growth for the business.
Asia Paciﬁc accounted for 50% of
the input of electric actuators up
from 49% last year. China
continued to be the most
important contributor with
increased levels of business. 
The Indian market maintained the
high levels of business seen in
2006, driven by investment in
power generation and large
reﬁnery projects. Our electric
actuator manufacturing plants in
Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai, Chennai
and Bangalore all performed well
and achieved increases in proﬁts.
Elsewhere, the Singaporean,
Malaysian and Thai sales
companies all saw increased levels
of business as did those in Japan
and Korea. The latter did well to
overcome some local difﬁculties
and ended the year with a
stronger operation. 
The Australian operation
continued to perform well while
the turnaround in the fortunes of
our South African company, which
made a loss in the prior year, was
also most encouraging.
ROTORK FLUID SYSTEMS
Rotork Fluid Systems, which
designs, assembles and markets
pneumatic and hydraulic valve
actuators continued to achieve
exceptional growth. The main
markets served by our products 
are oil & gas related and unlike
electric actuators the majority are
used on upstream applications,
transmission and LNG plants &
terminals. These markets continue
to beneﬁt from high levels of
investment. A notable success was
winning substantial orders on the
very large Shell GTL (‘Gas to
Liquids’) Pearl project in Qatar. 
The principal assembly plant is
based in Lucca, Italy, with products
also assembled in Rochester, N.Y.
and Melle in Germany. The division
had two long-term key
performance goals. Firstly to
achieve 20% of Group revenue
and secondly a 15% return on
sales. It just achieved both of these
objectives this year, having
narrowly missed the revenue target
in 2006 (19%) and increased
return on sales from 13.3% to
15.0% in 2007. This is despite its
main cost base being in euros and
the euro/dollar rate having
averaged $1.38 against a prior
year of $1.26.
Order input was 34.6% up on 
the prior year, while revenue
increased by 18.3% to £47.9m
and operating proﬁt was up
33.3% to £7.2m.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
The Italian operation performed
very well and we increased our
investment in the facility, improving
the ofﬁce area and installing an
upgraded ERP system both there
and in the plant in Melle. 
The product range was extended
and improved, while further
progress was made in gaining
additional customer and market
approvals. The division had
increasing success on projects
requiring engineered solutions
particularly in the electro-hydraulic
(‘EH’), gas over oil, linear and
subsea product areas. A notable
success was the large EH order for
the Aramco Khurais project in
Saudi Arabia. The US operation
also beneﬁted from the upsurge in
engineered solutions business. 
The division’ s global capabilities
continued to be enhanced, mainly
through the development of the
Group’ s worldwide sales companies
and ofﬁces. Among these, the UK
based operation in Leeds and the
Spanish ofﬁce had excellent results.
The acquisition of Remote 
Controls Sweden was completed
on 30 January 2008 for a
consideration of £13m. This
company, which is based in Falun,
Sweden, was established in 1961
and has a worldwide reputation
for supplying high quality lower
torque actuators to a wide array 
of markets. These products
complement the mainly heavy 
duty products of the existing RFS
ranges and will be sold through
Rotork’s worldwide network of
sales ofﬁces.
The acquisition of the Drallim SVM
partial stroke and valve monitoring
patented product for £630k on 
13 February 2008 provides the
division with a platform to further
develop products for safety critical
applications. Rotork has sold the
SVM product for some years and
sees the demand for this type of
diagnostic system increasing due
to its ability to improve plant safety
and productivity while also
reducing plant capital costs.
ROTORK GEARS
Rotork Gears manufactures
gearboxes, adaptors and other
ancillary devices for industrial
valvemakers worldwide. Through
these valvemakers it serves a wide
variety of end user industries.
Rotork Gears achieved growth 
well above our plans and beneﬁted
from an active worldwide valve
market, especially in Europe and
America, and investment in its
worldwide operations and supply
chain. Revenue was up 31.3% to
£31.9m and operating proﬁt was
up 56.5% to £7.3m. The star
performers were the two main
plants in Leeds and Losser in 
The Netherlands. Both achieved
signiﬁcant growth in revenue 
and proﬁts.
Much work and investment was
centred on the new Chinese
facility which met an ambitious
production target and achieved a
number of important milestones,
including the assembly of the
updated 232 aluminium range 
of units and further progress 
was made in opening up the 
Asian market.
The engineering team was re-
organised to create a dedicated
R&D resource and progress was
made with a number of important
product initiatives. New or
improved product ranges will be
launched in 2008.
One of the key objectives for the
coming year will be to develop the
existing operations, those already
mentioned plus the operation in
Italy; ﬁrstly to ensure that the
business continues to increase
capacity to improve service levels
to our customers; secondly to
make sure that opportunities to
rationalise production and reduce
costs are delivered.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
(‘KPIs’)
Rotork has a culture of customer
service and support and this ethos
is reﬂected in the way that the
business is controlled on a day to
day basis. We manage the
operations through targets
primarily related to trading
activities and have well established
systems and procedures to support
this. KPIs have long been used to
aid management in monitoring
progress in achieving its objectives.
Most targets are ﬁnancial KPIs but
more recently we have developed
a similar approach to non ﬁnancial
issues connected with areas such
as environmental matters and
health & safety. 
Rotork’s philosophy of product
assembly only, using sub
contractors to manufacture
components, gives signiﬁcant
ﬂexibility in the production model
and KPIs assist in monitoring 
the efﬁciency of this model.
Management’s focus is on what
we regard as the high added value
activities of design, marketing and
management control. This means
that our approach to measuring
performance is oriented towards
success in penetrating the markets
in which we operate, the
development and proﬁtability of
our products, a desire for a high
return on capital, and strong cash
generation. We have produced
consistent improvement in
performance in these measures
through the year under review.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  The Group uses a range of
indicators to assess performance at
individual company, divisional and
Group level. The following are the
main key performance indicators
at Group level showing four years
performance and explanation
where appropriate of issues
underlying some of the measures.
Financial KPIs
Growth of the business, market
penetration and quality of earnings
are crucial target areas for Rotork
and we have a number of
measures of performance used
throughout the Rotork
organisation. Revenue growth is 
a simple but effective measure of
our performance against our
objectives in this area and,
supported by the relationship of
our net proﬁt to sales and the
growth in earnings per share,
provides a small but powerful
range of ratios that enable
management to quickly view the
performance of the business and
drill down to divisional level and
below to view returns. With an
asset light business model, we
have a target of growth in return
on capital which provides an
effective view of balance sheet
performance and each of the
divisional businesses review this.
Conversion of proﬁt into cash has
a high priority within the Group
and is embedded within reward
schemes at divisional management
as well as Group level.
Sales revenue growth
This is reported in detail for all
operating businesses and is a key
driver in the business. These
measures enable us to track our
success in speciﬁc project activity
and our progress in increasing 
our market share by products 
and region. This also is an
important driver in our product
development programme. 
Return on sales
This is calculated as proﬁt before
tax (after ﬁnancing and interest)
shown as a percentage of sales
revenue. This measure brings
together the combined effects 
of procurement costs and pricing
as well as the leverage of our
operating assets. Our overall aim 
is for continuous improvement
over time, notwithstanding the
impact of currency.
Cash generation
The conversion of proﬁt into cash is
an important measure for Rotork.
This is calculated as the ratio of
operating cash ﬂow to operating
proﬁt. Operating cash ﬂow is
deﬁned as the movement in cash
and cash equivalents, adjusted to
add back cash ﬂows from
ﬁnancing activities, the acquisition
of subsidiaries, income taxes paid,
exceptional cash outﬂows and less
interest received. It is used
internally as a measure of
performance where a target of
85% is regarded as a base level of
achievement. This also forms one
of the constituent parts of the
reward system where management
is incentivised to achieve a
performance beyond this level. 
Return on capital employed
Rotork has an asset light business
model by design, and reporting
this ratio internally helps
management at Group level to
monitor our adherence to this
philosophy. The calculation shows
proﬁt before tax as a percentage
of capital employed. Capital
employed is deﬁned as
shareholders’ funds less net cash
held, and the pension deﬁcit net of
related deferred tax is added back.

EPS growth
The measurement of earnings 
per share reﬂects all aspects of the
income statement including
management of the Group’s 
tax rate. We aim to increase EPS
each year.
Non-ﬁnancial KPIs
We monitor non-ﬁnancial areas 
in our businesses particularly in 
the environmental, health & safety 
and quality control areas and 
put strong emphasis within our
organisation on improving our
performance here.
Waste recycling
This KPI measures the proportion
of total waste produced which 
is recycled. We have an active
programme aimed at reducing 
our environmental footprint
throughout the organisation. 
We collect this information
through regular submissions
through our extranet site. 
DIVIDENDS
Rotork is a cash generative
business and has a policy of
returning funds to shareholders
where they are not required for
reinvestment in the business in the
foreseeable future. The Board’s
policy is one of increasing
dividends generally in line with
earnings. In recent years where
there has been excess cash in the
business this has been distributed
back to shareholders in the form
of additional dividends. In the year
under review cash generation has
been good and the Board is
recommending to shareholders
that the ﬁnal dividend for 2007 
be 14.0p per share which is an
increase of 20% over the prior
year. In addition, the Board is
intending to pay an additional
interim dividend for 2008 of 
11.5p per share, representing the
distribution of £10m of excess
cash. This will be paid to
shareholders on 18 July 2008, to
shareholders on the register on 
27 June 2008.
TREASURY
The Group’s treasury function in
Bath manages ﬁnancial risk
relating to foreign currency
exposure, debtor risk and cash
movements within the Group. 
Rotork is affected by movements
in world currencies and aims to
mitigate the effect of this through
the diversity of location of
production units as well as taking
action through derivative
instruments. The main currency
exposure results from trading
transactions between our
production plants and trading
companies and customers around
the world. This exposure is covered
by simple forward cover derivative
instruments aimed at protecting
known income streams: no
speculative or non trading hedging
takes place within the Group. 
The impact of currency on the
results of the Group can best be
seen by converting the 2007 results
to the effective exchange rates for
2006, so comparing results at
constant currency, see table below.
Overall we believe that proﬁt for
the year would have been
approximately £2.8m higher if the
2006 exchange rates had prevailed.
The increase in operating proﬁt,
reported as 22.8%, would have
shown an increase of 29.0% at
constant currency. Weighted
average rates for translation of 
our two main trading currencies 
for the last few years are shown 
in the table below.
Receivables management is done
at each operating business unit 
but controlled centrally in Bath.
There is commonality in our
customer base across many of the
geographic units and debts outside
the UK are insured centrally on 
a limit per customer basis, and this
operates across the operating
divisions. Overall we believe a level
of 65 days sales outstanding for
receivables is appropriate for 
our mix of business. At the year
end this ﬁgure was 60 days, an
improvement of 2 days compared
with 2006.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  PENSION SCHEMES
Over the last few years there has
been a lot of focus on pension
schemes, particularly company
liabilities relating to under funded
legacy deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
Rotork’s UK ﬁnal salary scheme
was closed to new entrants in
2002, when a deﬁned contribution
scheme was opened for employees
joining from the beginning of
2003. The Group has made
additional contributions into the
UK ﬁnal salary scheme between
2004 and 2007 and the scheme
had its latest actuarial valuation
review during 2007. The results of
this showed it was 98% funded
on an actuarial basis, which is
precisely the position that the
additional contributions were
aiming to achieve, and it is now
felt that the scheme is back in
equilibrium. The main issue for
schemes of this type in recent
years has been the effect of longer
life expectancy, the fact that
pensions in payment will have to
be paid for longer as people
expect to live longer. This issue
could continue to affect schemes
as mortality assumptions evolve
further over the next few years.
However, management and the
pension scheme trustees, with the
advice of the scheme actuary,
consider that the potential for
adverse mortality assumptions to
impact the scheme further is
controllable within the current
range of contributions.
The impact of improved mortality
is not presently anticipated to have
an impact on cash contributions
beyond normally expected funding
levels. In terms of the charge to
the income statement under IFRS
these assumptions will have an
impact as a result of the last
actuarial valuation by increasing
the charge against proﬁt. The
charge against proﬁt before tax
will increase to around £1.6m in
2008, compared with the charge
of £0.7m in 2007.
ROTORK COMMUNITY
Rotork celebrated its 50th year of
incorporation with a number of
marvellous events which were
attended by both past and present
employees as well as others who
have had much to do with the
Group’s success. We also
celebrated this milestone with a
publication which drew very
positive comments from a wide
group of stakeholders. 
The events demonstrated the
commitment and affection 
that everyone has for the
organisation which makes it such 
a formidable presence in its ﬁeld. 
I have enormously enjoyed every
aspect of my involvement with
Rotork over the past thirty-four
years and feel very privileged to
have led it over the past twelve.
Rotork has always had a unique
spirit which I feel conﬁdent under
the talented leadership of Peter
France will propel it to even
greater success. I would like to
thank all of our employees around
the world for their dedication, skill,
good humour and friendship and it
is them that I will miss most when I
retire on 2 May.

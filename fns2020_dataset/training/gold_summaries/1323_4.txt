 Ascribe plc Annual Report & Accounts year ended 30 June 2007 P3
Ascribe plc is a leading healthcare company that develops and markets software solutions supporting
patient, clinical and business processes to Primary and Secondary healthcare providers in the UK and 
overseas. The Group offers solutions that directly improve patient care and deliver financial savings 
to our customers. Ascribe provides solutions to clinical professionals and sells to Primary and Secondary
Care health providers rather than through centrally driven political initiatives. Offering patient and
decision support information to clinicians in context with their activity is the key to our ongoing success.
Ascribe currently employs over 220 personnel through its seven operating businesses in the UK, 
Kenya, Australia and New Zealand.
Ascribe at a Glance
The Group currently delivers systems for the following
health requirements:
• Electronic Patient Records (“EPR”) 
and Patient Administration Systems (“PAS”)
• Hospital Pharmacy Departments
• Electronic Prescribing & Medicine Administration
• Accident and Emergency and Minor Injury Units
• Mental Health and Community Care
• Substance Misuse Systems
• General Practice
• Primary Pharmacy and Retail Sales
• Theatres Management 
• Radiology Information Systems
• Electronic Discharge Systems
• Dispensary Robotic Interfaces
• Medical Equipment Asset Management
Ascribe is committed to developing a common integrated
solution that meets all these needs regardless of care
location. Our solutions can work as standalone modules
or as integrated systems - integrating with each other
and with third party IT systems. Integrated healthcare
systems such as electronic prescribing and medicines
administration provide a far more effective safeguard
to protect patients’ safety, helping to reduce risk and
providing healthcare professionals with better access
to patient and medication information.
In a market that has an increasing demand for clinical
systems operated by teams of health professionals
from many disciplines, Ascribe continues to deliver
innovation, development and sustainable growth. 
The Group’s goal is to provide ‘birth to death’ records
that will enable clinicians and healthcare professionals
to make more informed decisions at ‘the point of care’,
thereby reducing risk and errors and so provide patients
with better healthcare. Such a solution is required for
health organisations to move to their preferred method
of a patient being treated by multiple carers in multiple
locations against a common record.
Competitive Advantages:
• A robust and mature product suite of healthcare 
solutions that can be delivered today across primary 
and secondary care.
• Strong and scalable infrastructure that employs 
economies of scale to increase efficiency and 
reduce wastage. 
• Development focus on system integration and 
interoperability – our internal development resource 
is one of our most significant assets. We can build 
systems on time and to agreed budgets. Most 
importantly of all, we consistently deliver healthcare 
IT solutions that work.
• Experienced professional workforce, many recruited 
from within the NHS, helps us to work closely with 
customers and understand the issues that are key to 
them. Our support teams respond quickly and 
professionally and extend our customer relationship 
well past the point of purchase. Ascribe is well 
known for its excellent service and support.
• Many of our solutions are compliant to the standards 
required by the UK Government’s Connecting for 
Healthcare (“CfH”) initiative. Separate Products establish 
basic communication of data
Integration leads to common resources,
saving development time & enhancing
clinical focus

The last year has been one of significant operational and exploration 
development for Chariot. While the results of the drilling campaign were 
disappointing, the participation in two wells, accumulation of 7,000km

of 3D seismic and early entry into two new regions reflects the ability 
of the Chariot team and its commitment to taking the Company forward. 
Over the coming year, we will continue to develop our portfolio and manage 
risk whilst applying capital discipline throughout all of our projects.

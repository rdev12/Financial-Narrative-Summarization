 4 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
Q.
What pleased you most about this  
year’s performance?
A. We have three strong businesses and  
they all made solid progress. The margin 
improvement in Linden Homes stood out for 
me and we are very focused on continuing  
to improve it. Partnerships continued to  
show why we are excited about the 
business’s potential, with further growth  
in its mixed-tenure revenue. Construction  
also benefited from the improvement in its  
markets throughout the year.
I was also pleased by our succession 
planning, the aim of which is to ensure we 
have the right leaders at Board, Executive 
Board and other senior management levels. 
We have recruited Bill Hocking in the 
Construction business to succeed Ken 
Gillespie, who has led that business (including 
the acquired Miller Construction business)  
for over 20 years, and will retire from the 
Group next year. They are working together  
to ensure the handover is as smooth and 
effective as possible.
“Galliford T ry is an excellent business, with skilled 
and passionate people and exciting prospects 
across the Group. We have the right strategy to 
deliver and have made excellent progress towards 
our 2018 targets. Going forward we will be 
following a similar course, focused on achieving 
sustainable and disciplined organic growth.  
We are currently finalising our strategy beyond 
2018 which we will communicate in due course.”

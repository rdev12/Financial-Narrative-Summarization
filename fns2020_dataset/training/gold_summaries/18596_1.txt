Officer’s Review
Overview
During 2015, our operational performance at 
Sekisovskoye was affected by the winding down 
of our open pit operations and the management 
and team re-focusing on developing the decline 
to access our higher grade underground reserves. 
This necessitated the closure of operations for two 
months at the ore mining facility. This was required 
in order to make modifications and upgrades 
to transition to the underground operation. Our 
reduced gold production together with the lower 
global price of gold has led inevitably to a decrease 
in revenue, however we have maintained tight 
control of costs, which will have a positive impact 
as the Company revenue increases in the medium 
term. Management has taken the opportunity 
to review the assets and operations and made 
impairments as necessary. 
Expansionary capex significantly reduced
Many of our achievements during 2015 were 
focussed on the continued development of our 
underground mine. As previously discussed, during 
2015 we made the decision to develop a decline 
underground rather than to sink a shaft to access 
our higher grade gold reserves at depth. To that 
end, we re-developed our underground mining 
access approach and, in early 2016, reported that 
we had finalised our new capital expenditure 
budget. In order to expand and further develop our 
underground mine, expand our processing plant 
and to produce 100,000oz of gold annually, we will 
need to spend US$42m excluding contingency. 
This is a marked decrease on the US$130m 
estimated in our 2014 Venmyn Deloitte competent 
person’s report, which assumed we would sink a 
shaft to access our reserves. 
“While our gold production at 
Sekisovskoye fell year on year, we 
are pleased to report that significant 
progress has been made in 2015 to 
transition our open pit mine to an 
underground mine. This will secure our 
long term future and we expect our 
gold production to begin to increase 
again in 2016.”

Projected capital expenditure underground operation
Of the US$42m expansionary capital expenditure 
required, GoldBridges only requires external 
financing of between US$20m and US$30m, as 
the remainder is expected to be generated from 
operational cash flows. 
Our supportive shareholder, African Resources, 
which is indirectly owned by members of the 
Assaubayev family, has agreed to finance the 
development of the underground mine if other 
sources of funding are unsuitable. To that end,  
in February 2016, African Resources bought 
US$10m of five year, 10% coupon convertible 
bonds that can be redeemed at over 3p/share,  
a significant premium to the current share price. 
This demonstrates the family’s continued support.
Underground mine development
In terms of decline development, significant 
progress was made in 2015 and early 2016.  
To date, a total of approximately 570m of 
development work has been undertaken on the 
new transportation decline. Construction of the 
portal has already commenced, with completion 
expected in May 2016.
By completing the initial development works 
of the new decline in May 2016, the Company 
expects to reduce the current haulage distance 
from 3km to 1.2km and to increase the ore 
throughput capacity to 45,000 tonnes per month. 
This should enable the company to mine at an 
annualised run rate of 500,000 tonnes per year 
from May 2016. GoldBridges Global Resources Plc

Officer’s Review continued
Work undertaken by Mining Plus 
In H2 2015, Mining Plus, the international mine 
consultancy group, was retained by GoldBridges 
to undertake studies on the underground 
mining plans and to assist it in transitioning its 
Sekisovskoye mine into a large underground gold 
operation with 100,000oz annual output.
Mining Plus has expertise in geological 
modelling and geotechnical aspects for hard rock 
underground mines, combined with underground 
mine planning experience, particularly using 
decline haulage. It has offices in Australia, Canada 
and Peru and provides mining expertise from the 
conceptual stage of projects, through to feasibility 
study work, project delivery, commissioning, and 
mine closure.
Under the scope of this assignment, Mining 
Plus re-modelled the Sekisovskoye drilling data 
and reviewed all mining methods that could 
potentially be applicable to the underground mine 
development at Sekisovskoye. The studies had 
important findings. Firstly, Mining Plus identified 
that, while several mining methods are applicable 
at Sekisovskoye, the most efficient methods in 
terms of mining recovery, dilution and costs are 
long hole open stoping methods with either paste 
fill or with cemented aggregate fill. Both mining 
methods provide high selectivity and sequencing 
flexibility, giving GoldBridges the opportunity to 
extract higher grade ore earlier in the schedule. 
Secondly, the Mining Plus work identified the 
opportunity to increase the overall head grade of 
the ore mined by selectively mining the deposit, 
giving the Company increased flexibility. 
These findings mean that GoldBridges could 
further reduce its cash cost of operation at full 
production, as it has the option of mining fewer 
tonnes at a higher grade. This could enhance the 
value of the project, over and above the US$226m 
that was estimated by Venmyn Deloitte in 
November 2014 using a gold price of US$1,100/oz 
and a 9.3% discount rate. 
Sekisovskoye gold mine – our operational 
track record 
The operational performance of the Company’s 
Sekisovskoye gold mine during 2015 against the 
prior year is shown in the adjacent tables. 
Total gold production for 2015 was 15,534oz. This 
is a 53% reduction on the 2014 gold output of 
32,994oz. This result reflects the winding down 
and closure of the open pit mine at Sekisovskoye, 
while the Company’s efforts were focused on 
increasing its underground development in order 
to increase underground gold production for  
the future.
In total, 566,664 tonnes of ore were milled  
(2014: 728,620 tonnes), of which 79,276 tonnes or 
14% were mined from the underground operation.  
This compares to 82,045 tonnes or 11% in 2014.
The average gold grade of ore milled during 2015 
was 1.12g/t (2014: 1.81g/t), and comprised ore 
mined at an average grade of 1.06g/t from the 
open pit mine and 2.55g/t from the underground 
mine. Open pit gold grades were lower than the 
1.26g/t achieved in 2014 due to the exhaustion of 
the open pit economic reserves. Gold grades are 
expected to increase in 2016 and onwards as the 
production from Sekisovskoye is solely from the 
higher grade reserves of the underground mine.
At 76.04% and 64.91% respectively, both gold 
and silver recoveries were lower than 2014. This 
was related to lower recoveries experienced 
predominantly in H1 2015 as a result of variable 
grade and ore composition and also reflected 
plant improvement works undertaken during the 
period. 
As the proportions of sulphidic minerals in the ore 
and the amount of gold in fine grains increases 
during underground mining, the characteristics 
of the free gold generally improve, and some 
changes were made to the ore process in the 
plant to reflect this. The work was largely related 
to introducing a fuller gravity circuit into the 
operational process. This processing route consists 
of jigs, washers and centrifugal concentrators 
and refining this part of the process allows the 
plant to recover the finer grained gold particles

Market review 
Operating in challenging times
Market and share price overview
2015 marked one of the worst years on record 
for the mining industry as the prices fell for the 
vast majority of mined commodities, and heavily 
indebted companies struggled to retain profit 
margins. The chart shows the FTSE 350 mining 
index and demonstrates that, between May 2015 
and December 2015, the sector lost 50% of its 
value. 
Unsurprisingly against this backdrop, GoldBridges 
shares also fell during the year, by approximately 
30%.
The gold market in 2015
From the gold price highs of almost US$1,900/oz in 
2011, the gold price has fallen over the last 4 years 
to end 2015 at only US$1,070/oz. During 2015, the 
gold price fell from its high in January by about 
US$200/oz. The average gold price achieved by the 
Company (to include silver as a by-product) for the 
year was US$1,151/oz.
 
A key reason for gold’s weakness in US dollar 
terms was that the US economy performed well 
and this enabled the Federal Reserve to raise 
interest rates in December, marking the first time 
interest rates have risen for almost ten years. In the 
months leading up to the rise in interest rates, the 
market valuations of bond yields increased and 
this strengthened the dollar and, consequently, 
put pressure on the gold price. The increased bull 
market which we have seen for gold since 2001 
has been in large part driven by increased demand 
from emerging economies and, in 2014 onwards, 
we have seen these emerging market economies 
weakening and this, in combination with the 
improving economic outlook in the US, has also 
contributed to the falling gold price. 
That said, while the gold price reduced during  
2015 in US dollar terms, it rose against some 
currencies such as the Russian rouble and the 
Indonesian Rupiah. 
According to the World Gold Council, gold is 
certainly in a bear market, and has been since late 
2011. That said, the consensus view appears to be 
for a more stable outlook for gold in 2016. Indeed 
during the last part of 2015 and early 2016, gold 
has traded sideways and it appears likely that the 
relatively benign environment for US interest rates 
will continue. 
Some respite from weakening operating 
currencies
Against a backdrop of generally falling commodity 
prices, many operating currencies have weakened 
during the course of 2015, allowing the mining 
companies to reduce their costs in US dollar terms 
and therefore maintain larger profit margins than 
would have ordinarily been the case. 
One of the more dramatic examples of this has 
been that of the Kazakh Tenge, which depreciated 
materially in August 2015 due to the Kazakh 
National Bank making the decision to float the 
currency. The price weakened initially from about 
182KZT to the US Dollar to 250KZT to the US Dollar, 
and continued weakening throughout 2015, 
ending the year at approximately 339KZT to the US 
Dollar. The National Bank floated the currency to 
ensure the country remained competitive against 
weakening currencies of many of its nearby trading 
partners, not least Russia and China. 
Results have been positive for Kazakh mining 
companies reporting in US Dollars as operating 
costs have been materially reduced. Approximately 
50% of GoldBridges operating costs are Kazakh 
Tenge denominated and the local devaluation has 
eased pressure on both operating and capital costs. 
 
In these broadly challenging and volatile markets. 
GoldBridges focuses on areas under its control, 
such as keeping its operations as low cost as 
possible to maintain profit margins where possible.

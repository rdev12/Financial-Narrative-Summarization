OEMs are responding to global 
competition and pressure on pro tability 
by seeking to standardise the business 
processes of their dealer networks. 
This is happening at the same time 
as OEMs are managing their expansion 
in BRIC and emerging markets. OEMs 
are also integrating web based and 
mobile technologies to enable them 
to manage the complete car sales 
and ownership life cycle.
Recognising these trends, incadea  
has developed a new generation  
of cloud enabled solutions including  
DMS (incadea.myengine), CVRM  
(incadea.cvrm) and BI (incadea.bi).
incadea is experiencing strong 
demand for its next generation solutions, 
especially in Asia where customers 
also prefer the SaaS model over the 
traditional on premise model for solutions 
delivery. In 2013 SaaS revenues are 
estimated to be 10% of revenues but 
we expect this proportion to grow 
substantially over the next three years. 
Overall, during 2012 incadea was 
successful in supporting the expansion 
of OEM customers as well as increasing 
market share by establishing new 
OEM relationships and increasing dealer 
network penetration and this trend 
is continuing.
A key element of our stated strategy is to 
support the expansion of OEM customers 
in key markets through incadea 
subsidiaries, whilst continuing to operate 
in certain territories through local 
partners. By controlling our international 
operations, we are able to enhance our 
growth prospects and pro tability by 
selling directly and delivering a full 
service to our customers.
During the year, we made signi cant 
progress in the implementation of our 
strategy, establishing a new subsidiary 
in China in uly 2012. Since then we have 
rapidly achieved signi cant success in 
China where we are experiencing very 
strong demand. incadea China already 
contributes signi cantly to the Group’s 
results and is expected to grow to our 
second largest operation worldwide.
incadea’s strong financial performance 
for the year ended 31 December 2012 
reflects significant progress made in 
implementing our stated strategy which 
has been supported by a favourable 
market environment.

Strategy Overview
CEO’s Letter
We have strengthened our presence 
in India, New Zealand and Taiwan. This 
followed the establishment of incadea 
India in 2011 and the acquisition in  
2011 of our partners in Russia and New 
Zealand, the latter operating a branch 
of ce in Taiwan which is now the base  
for our growing operations in Asia Paci c 
outside China. Following the successful 
implementation of a project for BMW’s 
importer in Turkey, we plan to establish  
a direct operation for that country  
in 2013. 
We made signi cant progress with the 
development of our operations in Latin 
America and Iberia. Through our regional 
headquarters in Spain, incadea has 
implemented projects in Mexico, 
Paraguay, amaica and Colombia and  
has established a subsidiary in Mexico. 
We also acquired 100% of our former 
partner in Portugal, IS Dynamics, 
which now operates as incadea Portugal. 
We are also reviewing options for 
establishing incadea’s footprint in 
Brazil and Central America. 
Revenues generated through incadea 
subsidiaries accounted for approximately 
63% of the total for 2012 (49% for 2011) 
with the rest being generated from 
incadea Austria and we anticipate that 
this upward trend will continue over 
the next few years.
The progress we have made in the 
transition to being a direct, full software 
and service provider, is re ected in the 
growth in revenue from services which 
accounted for 46.9% of total revenue  
for 2012 (2011: 41%) which, in turn,  
is re ected in a 57% increase in 
operating margin to 16.2% for the  
year (2011: 10.3%).
Whilst BRIC and emerging economies 
represent the majority of the growth 
opportunity for incadea, we believe 
that there are strategic opportunities 
in Europe.

During 2012, incadea’s success in 
supporting existing OEM customers in 
their global expansion, as well as winning 
new OEM customers in key territories, 
resulted in 14% growth in our installed 
user base to 56,749 at 31 December  
2012 (1 anuary 2012: 49,691). Major 
achievements for 2012 included winning 
Qoros, the Chinese OEM, as well as 
developing relationships with Peugeot/
Citroën, Ford and Chevrolet.
Qoros
In September 2012 we announced a 
strategic partnership with Qoros, the joint 
venture between Chery Automobile, one 
of the largest Chinese OEMs, and Israel 
Corporation. The partnership is for the 
roll out of incadea’s full product suite to 
80 Qoros dealers in 2013 and up to a 
further 200 dealers in 2014. Qoros is also 
planning to use incadea as the strategic 
software partner for its planned entry 
into the European market in 2015. This 
partnership has signi cant strategic 
importance for the Chinese market and 
incadea is the rst international provider 
in this area to win a major deal with a 
Chinese OEM.
BMW Group
incadea is one of two global strategic 
partners of BMW Group for the 
implementation of a global initiative 
to standardise its DMS and retail 
CRM systems. Total users increased 
during 2012 by 24% to 16,486 at 
31 December 2012.
During the year pilot testing of  
next generation incadea.cvrm and  
incadea.myengine products was 
successfully completed. Roll out to  
more than 800 users at BMW Russia 
started in September 2012 with 
implementation expected to be 
completed during the rst half of 2014. 
Roll out in France will start in the rst 
half of 2013 for a total of 3,500 users 
expected by the end of 2015. Two major 
target markets for BMW in 2013 are 
Brazil and apan with others including 
 amaica, Mexico and elsewhere in  
Latin America.
Volkswagen Group
incadea is one of two global strategic 
partners of VW which we anticipate will 
grow substantially as a contributor to 
revenue and pro ts over the next few 
years. During 2012 we made signi cant 
progress with a roll out to more than 
1,800 users in several Asian countries 
(including India and China). New 
contracts have been signed in  
Malaysia and Hong Kong which will be 
implemented over the next two years. 
Strategic progress
Our strategy, outlined at the  
time of incadea’s IPO, has three  
key elements:
1. developing incadea into a global 
business by expanding our 
operations, in support of OEM 
customers and prospects, in the 
fast growing automotive markets 
of BRIC and other emerging 
economies;
2. transforming incadea from a 
pure play software company with 
a high dependency on partners 
and covering only a small part of 
the total value chain, into a full 
software and service provider with 
delivery primarily through 100% 
controlled subsidiaries; and 
3. maintaining incadea’s competitive 
advantage by delivering solutions 
based on our proprietary, 
next generation software and 
product suite, incorporating DMS, 
CRM and BI. incadea

Opel/General Motors
incadea is a strategic partner for Opel/
General Motors covering approximately 
530 dealers in 18 countries with 
approximately 14,300 users. We believe 
that there is potential to generate 
incremental revenues with Opel in Russia 
with scope for further growth with GM 
in Asia by extending our partnership 
with GM International Operations 
based in Shanghai.
Other OEMs
During 2012 incadea strengthened 
its relationship with other European 
and American OEMs and their dealer 
networks. We are currently in negotiation 
with European OEMs for contracts 
covering more than 450 dealerships in 
Europe and a similar number of dealers 
in Asia to be rolled out over the next 
two to three years. Signi cant progress 
has been achieved by leveraging our 
European relationship with American 
OEMs in Asia. We are currently 
negotiating contracts across spell Asian 
countries, such as China, apan, India, 
Thailand and others, with a total size 
of more than 1,000 dealerships.

The expansion of OEMs in BRIC and 
other emerging markets is re ected in 
the geographic analysis of revenue for 
the year. In a trend which we expect to 
continue, revenue growth is being driven 
by expansion in Asia Paci c, notably 
China, Russia and Latin America. 
Approximately two thirds of license 
revenue in Europe is through partners 
and we anticipate that we will achieve 
further growth through penetration 
of markets such as Germany, Italy 
and France.
Russia and CIS
In Russia and CIS, the growth achieved 
followed the acquisition of a controlling 
interest in our Russian partner in early 
2011, was mainly driven by BMW 
projects. Our negotiations with other 
European OEMs will also have a positive 
impact on our Russian business over the 
next years. The agreement with Qoros 
has signi cantly enhanced incadea’s 
reputation in the Chinese market, 
especially with Chinese OEMs. As a result 
we are now in discussions with importers 
of Chinese brands and their networks 
in Russia.

Strategy Overview
CEO’s Letter
China
The majority of new users in 2012 
were sold through incadea China, the 
subsidiary established during the year. 
The strategic partnership with Qoros 
is a major achievement for incadea 
whose pro le and reputation has been 
signi cantly enhanced not only in China 
but also with OEMs around the world. 
incadea China is currently working 
on potential opportunities with 
eight international OEMs.
India
incadea’s subsidiary in India is currently 
working with BMW Group and VW Group 
as strategic OEMs for the support and the 
roll out of various products and services. 
The subsidiary is also in negotiations with 
two potential European OEM customers 
for implementations all over India.
Latin America
At the time of incadea’s IPO, we identi ed
Latin America in general and Brazil in 
particular as an important potential 
market for the Group. In 2012, we 
established a subsidiary in Mexico City 
and expansion into the Brazilian market 
is planned for 2013.
Technology and product development
In 2012, €3.4 million was invested in new 
products, enhancing their functionality 
and other development to ensure that 
incadea solutions ful l the future needs 
of our OEM customers and their dealer 
networks. This has involved integrating 
internet applications, social media, 
telematics vehicle data with any device 
as well as integrating the transactional 
back of ce ERP process across entire 
dealer networks. A major competitive 
advantage for incadea results from its 
solutions running on the Microsoft 
Dynamics product family in combination 
with the Azure (Cloud) platform and 
Of ce 365, leading to signi cant bene ts 
to OEM customers from low cost, product 
standardisation and rapid deployment.
During the year, we launched our 
next generation DMS, incadea.myengine, 
and completed the development of 
incadea.cvrm (customer and vehicle 
relationship management) and incadea.bi 
(business intelligence) products with 
several pilot implementations being 
performed in Austria, Spain and Russia. 
Following the successful completion of 
pilot projects, licenses have been sold to 
end customers, providing the rst step 
towards commercial availability in 2013.
In 2012 we sold 7,058 licenses, with the 
majority of them being for our traditional 
DMS, incadea.engine. Furthermore, 
we successfully sold incadea.myengine 
projects in China, Mexico, Columbia and 
Middle East. Following the decision to 
launch in new markets such as in South 
America with incadea.myengine only, 
we expect that 2013 will be the last year 
when sales of incadea.engine exceed 
sales of incadea.myengine.
People
Global expansion and the increase in 
services delivered are re ected in growth 
in the total number of employees and a 
change in the mix of staff roles and skills. 
Total employees increased by 27.5% to 
301 at 31 December 2012 (1 anuary 
2012: 236) with the majority employed 
in Germany, Greece, Russia and China. 
This expansion primarily re ects areas 
of growing operational need, including 
the increased emphasis on consulting 
and project management to support 
the full software and service solutions 
being delivered outside Europe.
In conclusion, our business prospects 
remain very strong, supported by a solid 
customer pipeline and we are con dent 
that the Group has achieved the right 
positioning to continue generating 
pro table growth.

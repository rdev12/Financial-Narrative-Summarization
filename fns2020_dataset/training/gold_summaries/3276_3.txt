CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
KEITH BUTLER-WHEELHOUSE
INTRODUCTION
Having joined Chamberlin on 1 March 2012, 
this report marks my first full year as Chairman. 
Over the financial year, the Group has contended 
with softening trading conditions in a number of 
sectors, especially in the second half of the financial 
year, which have adversely affected the Group’s 
results for the year as a whole. Nonetheless, the 
slowdown in demand has been managed effectively 
as possible by the team and as we reported in our 
half year results statement, we have also continued 
to invest in the business and make operational 
changes which will support Chamberlin’s growth 
prospects over the long term. In particular, we have 
refocused the way we approach our new business 
development, added new skills and expertise, and 
continued to seek improvements to operational 
processes and product profitability. 
“Our goals are to generate 
top line sales growth as well 
as continuous operational 
development to improve 
efficiency and maintain 
tight cost controls, and 
therefore drive the Group’s 
profitability.”
We are confident that Chamberlin is well placed 
to see out the near term challenges of the 
current economic cycle and notwithstanding the 
prevailing tough conditions, our focus remains on 
simultaneous achievement of top line sales growth 
and bottom line margin improvement.
RESULTS
Revenues for the year ended 31 March 2013 were 
down 7% to £42.3m (2012: £45.5m), with a slight 
softening of demand in the first half followed 
by a further slowdown in the second half of the 
financial year.
Underlying operating profit reduced to £1.3m 
(2012: £1.7m), with tight cost control limiting the 
impact of the revenue reduction. Gross margins 
decreased slightly to 19.2% (2012: 19.5%) however 
our internal calculation of variable contribution, 
which measures the margin achieved before fixed 
costs, shows continuing progression at 32.9% (2012: 
32.5%, 2011: 31.6%). The underlying profit before 
tax was £1.3m (2012 £1.7m) and diluted underlying 
earnings per share was 13.4p (2012: 16.5p).
The statutory results show statutory operating 
profit at £1.1m (2012: £1.6m), statutory profit 
before tax at £0.9m (2012: £1.4m) and diluted 
statutory earnings per share at 9.6p (2012: 14.5p). 
Chamberlin has a strong record of cash generation 
and working capital control and this remains 
evident in these results. Cash generation was only 
slightly down at £2.3m (2012: £2.4m) and once 
again was significantly above underlying operating 
profit, equating to 177% of operating profit. The 
strong cash generation enabled us to reduce net 
borrowing by 37% to £0.98m (2012: £1.56m), which 
is the lowest year-end position since March 2007.
We typically hold capital expenditure in line with 
depreciation. However, we are currently installing 
a new process in our Walsall foundry which will 
deliver attractive ongoing cost reductions. This 
investment will result in a one-off increase in 
capital expenditure in the new financial year to  
31 March 2014 but we also expect to see 
immediate cost benefits. 
Gearing reduced to 12% (2012: 17%) and 
Chamberlin continues to be financed by a £5.0m 
overdraft facility from HSBC.
DIVIDEND
Our strong balance sheet and reliable cash 
generation provides a good underpinning for the 
dividend and I am pleased to announce that the 
Directors are recommending the payment of a final 
dividend of 2.0p per share, to be paid on  
26 July 2013 to shareholders on the register at  
5 July 2013. This increases the total dividend for the 
year to 3.25p (2012: 3.0p).
THE BOARD
The Company announced today, after seven years 
as Chief Executive, Tim Hair has given notice that 
he will be stepping down from the Board and 
the Company next May 2014, or sooner, if an 
appropriate replacement is found before that date. 
The Board has commenced the search for Tim’s 
successor and the date of Tim’s departure will be 
coordinated with the appointment of the new 
Chief Executive to ensure a smooth transition. 
The recruitment of a new Finance Director is 
in its final stages and until the appointment is 
formalised, Ian Poole, Group Financial Controller, 
has assumed responsibility for the day-to-day 
running of the finance function.
STRATEGY & OUTLOOK
The modernisation of Chamberlin has created 
significant capacity in our businesses, especially 
in our foundry operations, which can be utilised 
with only modest amounts of expenditure. Our 
growth strategy is therefore focused on taking 
advantage of this opportunity, utilising our 
technical expertise and the changes we have 
made over the year to enhance new business 
development. Our goals are to generate top line 
sales growth as well as continuous operational 
development to improve efficiency and maintain 
tight cost controls, and therefore drive the Group’s 
profitability. The transition is still in its early stages, 
but I have been encouraged by initial progress.
Market conditions are weaker than a year ago and 
we expect the first half of the new financial year to 
be tough. Nonetheless, we believe that Chamberlin 
is in very good shape to make progress as the cycle 
improves, and we continue to invest in the business 
to support our long term commercial objectives. 
The Group’s financial position is healthy and cash 
flows are good and we view prospects for the 
business over the long term very positively.

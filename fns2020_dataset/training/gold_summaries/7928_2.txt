Management believes that reporting adjusted measures provides a better comparison of business performance and reﬂects the way in which the business is controlled.
Accordingly, as outlined in our accounting policy note, adjusted measures of proﬁt from operations, net ﬁnance costs, proﬁt before tax, taxation and earnings per share 
exclude, where applicable, amortisation of acquired trademarks, restructuring costs, retirement beneﬁts net ﬁnancing income, fair value gains and losses on derivative ﬁnancial
instruments in respect of commercially effective hedges and related taxation effects. Reconciliations between adjusted and reported proﬁt from operations are included within
note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements, adjusted and reported ﬁnance costs in note 5, adjusted and reported taxation in note 6, and adjusted and reported earnings per share in
note 8. The adjusted measures in this report are not deﬁned terms under International Financial Reporting Standards and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures
reported by other companies.

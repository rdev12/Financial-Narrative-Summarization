Strategic Review
The theme of this report once again
illustrates the local nature of our
business and the markets in which we
operate. Recent market research
carried out by the Future Foundation
on behalf of the Newspaper Society,
the industry’s trade association,
demonstrates the growing importance
of local communities within the social
fabric of the United Kingdom. Their
“myuk” report illustrates the
considerable extent to which people’s
lives and daily affairs are
concentrated in an area close to their
homes, whether for work, shopping,
leisure or social activities.
It is this feature of the way that
people live their lives which provides
local newspapers with their basic
purpose. Local newspapers continue
to be the principal media in meeting
the needs of local communities for
locally focused news and information. 
They also provide advertisers with
high levels of local market penetration
and response. Local newspapers
remain a vital and integral part of local
communities throughout the UK.
As a publisher of 241 local and regional
newspaper titles, together with
numerous related print publications 
and more than 160 community based
websites, Johnston Press is totally
focused on this vitally important
market. Through a combination of
organic and acquisitive growth, the
Group is now one of the four leading
publishers of regional newspapers in
the UK with a total market share of
14.4% in terms of numbers of copies
sold and distributed.
The Group’s publishing activities
span a large area of the UK and, in
the overwhelming majority of our
marketplaces, Johnston Press is the
market-leading publisher of local
newspapers. This is achieved 
through a combination of paid-for
daily and weekly titles, weekly free
newspapers, specialist print
publications, such as lifestyle
magazines, local business directories
and classified advertising products
complemented by local websites.
By Tim Bowdler 
Chief Executive
2003 was another excellent year for Johnston Press. The integration of Regional Independent Media
Holdings Limited (RIM) was substantially completed, well ahead of our original expectations in terms 
of progress, performance and payback. Our continued focus on organic revenue growth and tight cost
control, coupled with reduced newsprint prices, enabled the Group to achieve record profits and
industry-leading operating margins.

Chief
Executive’s REVIEW
The Group’s strategic focus remains
firmly fixed on print and electronic
publishing in local markets around the
UK. We continue to place a high
emphasis on the achievement of
organic revenue growth. We constantly
review our existing publications to
ensure that they respond to changing
market needs. We continually seek
opportunities to launch new locally
based print publications and, as a
result, the number of specialist
products published by the Group has
grown considerably in recent years.
We have ongoing initiatives to expand
our business with existing advertisers
but also to seek new advertising
revenue opportunities as the shape
and business profile of our local
marketplaces change. 
We continue to increase the number
of websites focused on our local
communities, expanding their content,
improving their functionality and
promoting their brands, all part of a
concerted strategy to serve this new
and growing market opportunity. We
have launched several new initiatives
aimed at developing the potential
from building local consumer
databases. We have enabled
advertisers to book and pay for
advertisements on-line as well as
providing all of our sales staff with
access to the best advertisement
ideas and designs through our 
Group Intranet.
Although no acquisitions were
completed during 2003, the Group
remains keenly focused on the
achievement of continued acquisitive
growth in the UK regional press. With
a market share of less than 15%, we
believe that Johnston Press can
expect to grow further, even if over
70% of the sector is now in the
ownership of the four largest regional
newspaper publishers. We closely
monitor industry developments but
will remain selective in those
opportunities which we choose to
pursue. Thus, during the year, we did   Johnston Press  Annual Report and Accounts 2003
Part of Life
11
not participate in the bidding process
for Trinity Mirror’s Irish titles or for the
London-based regional newspapers
being sold by Independent News &
Media. In neither case did we regard
the strategic fit as sufficiently
compelling to make an offer.
Media Ownership
The extent to which further industry
consolidation will occur is also
dependent upon the regulation of
newspaper transfers. At the end of
2003, the new Communications Act
reached the statute book, significantly
changing the regulatory process. The
need for prior ministerial consent to
newspaper transfers and related
criminal sanctions has been removed. 
Whilst, at first glance, this may seem
to represent an easing of the
regulations, we do not believe that
this will be the case in practice. This
is in part due to uncertainty as to how
the OFT, DTI and OFCOM will treat
newspaper transfers and also reflects
the unhelpful conclusions of recent
Competition Commission inquiries. It
is the opinion of Johnston Press that
the Commission has tended to take
an overly narrow view of market
definition which considerably
underestimates the extent to which
local newspapers are subject to
competition from alternative media.
We believe that they have also
misjudged the ease of new market
entry and underestimated its impact
on publisher behaviour.
However, we do not believe that the
introduction of the Communications
Act 2003 will deter further sensible
industry consolidation and we are
confident that over time the regulators
will reach a clearer understanding of the
ways in which our markets operate.
We continue to harbour hopes that the
Government’s promises of genuine
deregulation and a lighter touch
approach will be delivered.
Trading Performance
Whilst market conditions during 2003
were by no means buoyant, the
Group succeeded in growing like-for-
like advertising revenues by 3.8%,
comprising 3.0% in the first half
increasing to 4.6% in the second.
When compared with the media
industry in general, this represents a
strong performance and reflects the

Executive’s REVIEW
fact that consumer confidence in local
markets remained positive throughout
the year. This, coupled with the
related factors of rising house prices
and low levels of unemployment, is
the principal determinant of the health
of advertising revenues in the regional
press. In the vast majority of our local
markets, this ensured a relatively
stable trading environment.
Growth was achieved in every
advertising category in the second 
half of the year. Although all classified
categories grew over the year as a
whole, display advertising was
marginally down due to the poor
performance of national display
advertising in the first half. The growth
in advertising revenue reflected a
modest increase in volumes, fuelled
by strong growth in property
advertising, and improved yields in all
categories as a result of the continued
increase in colour advertising, which is
sold at a premium, along with normal
rate card increases. 
Recruitment advertising grew strongly
in the second half, up 7.7% against
weaker 2002 comparatives although
performance was patchy. The north of
the country, except for the northeast
of England, exhibited good growth
whilst trading continued to be more
difficult in the south. This was
particularly the case in the South
Midlands where we experienced
further declines as a result of the
more difficult economic conditions
around the greater London area.
However, the trends improved as the
year progressed.

Property advertising demonstrated
strong growth throughout the year, up
14.5%. The second half performance
was marginally down on the first half
as the comparatives were more
difficult but, nonetheless, remained
strong. All areas of the country saw
good growth which was the result of
a cooling property market in which
vendors had to work harder to sell
their properties. This was especially
true of the new homes market which
in 2002 was so buoyant that
advertising often proved unnecessary.
The motors market remained relatively
stable with modest growth of 1.4% in
the year and broadly similar levels
being achieved in each half. Whilst
there were regional variations, these
did not follow any pattern and
fluctuations from the norm were
moderate. Other classifieds grew
steadily through the year, achieving
4.6% overall and also exhibiting
similar levels of growth in each half.
Again, there were modest regional
variations which did not follow a
particular pattern.
After a decline of 1.7% in the first
half, display advertising recovered to
record second half growth of 0.2%.
This was primarily due to a significant
improvement in national display
advertising, driven by recovery post
the Iraq war and increased activity
from the supermarkets, but also
reflected a marginally better local
performance. Given the relatively
volatile nature of national display
advertising, there were significant
local variations but, once more, no
clear regional pattern.
Operating margins for the Group, 
pre-operating exceptional items, were
again ahead of the previous year, with
an increase from 30.6% to 33.1%.
Every division increased its operating
profit and margin, a creditable
performance which reflected continued
excellent control over costs, aided by
a reduction in newsprint prices. This
enabled modest revenue growth to be
converted into a significantly greater
increase in operating profit. 
Performance has also benefited from
a continued programme of investment
in updated IT systems with common
platforms being introduced across
entire divisions. Having strengthened
the co-ordination of such initiatives
across the Group by the appointment
of a Head of IT following the
acquisition of RIM, considerable  Johnston Press  Annual Report and Accounts 2003

Executive’s REVIEW
progress has been made in utilising
the benefits that these technological
developments offer. In 2004, it is
anticipated that two more publishing
divisions will move to an enhanced
division-wide operating platform.
Those businesses which were part of
the Group prior to the acquisition of
RIM increased their pre-exceptional
operating margins from 31.7% to
33.3%. The ex-RIM businesses
managed a substantial improvement
with pre-exceptional operating
margins rising from 27.9% to 32.9%
and are now performing very close 
to the overall Group average. This
achievement reflects the very
considerable progress which has
been made since the business was
acquired. The initial integration
programme was completed some
time ago, ahead of our plans, and we
are now well into the more detailed
task of achieving the local operating
synergies which the acquisition offered.
There is an expectation of further
benefits during the course of 2004.
In Scotland, where we publish across
the middle belt of the country and in
large parts of the Scottish borders,
market conditions were less helpful
overall than for many other parts of
the Group. The continued increase in
profitability reflects local management’s
excellent control over costs and
realisation of the anticipated benefits
from the integration of the south of
Edinburgh-based Bonnyrigg operation,
which was acquired in 2002 as part of
RIM. In a particularly challenging
marketplace, Isle of Man Newspapers
again performed well. During the year,
they improved the design and content
of their three newspaper titles as well
as launching a lifestyle magazine. 
Northeast Press, which publishes from
Alnwick in the north to Hartlepool in
the south of the region, continues to
make good progress with profitability
now close to the Group average. On
its acquisition in 1999, this business
had operating margins which were
barely into double figures. This
improvement has been achieved
through a combination of cost and
revenue initiatives, with good progress
being made during 2003 through the
introduction of new advertising
platforms such as business and
health supplements.
The North of England division is our
largest and publishes extensively
throughout many parts of Yorkshire.
The division comprises three
companies from RIM, including
Yorkshire Post Newspapers, and three
which were previously part of the
Group. Across the division, market
conditions have generally been
favourable, although the substantial
improvement in performance owes
much to the excellent progress made
with the integration of the businesses
post-acquisition. Whilst each remains
firmly focused on its local markets,
opportunities have been taken to
rationalise and improve the efficiency
of functions such as pre-press,
distribution, accounts, credit control
and printing. A number of new
revenue initiatives have also
contributed to the improved
performance.
The Northwest division performed
extremely well, achieving above
average revenue growth which was
converted to a significantly improved
bottom line. Excellent progress has
been made in all companies and
across all aspects of the business
including initiatives to drive revenue Johnston Press  Annual Report and Accounts 2003

growth and to improve operating
efficiencies. The division comprises
five separate companies with
publications covering large parts of an
area from Morecambe in the north to
St Helens in the south, and from
Fleetwood in the west to Colne in the
east. The entire division formed part
of the RIM acquisition and includes
two specialist off-road motorbike
magazines which have repaid
increased investment with a
considerable improvement in
performance.
The South Yorkshire & North Midlands
division is based around the ex-RIM
centre of Sheffield, together with three
previously owned businesses whose
publications circulate in large parts of
South Yorkshire, North Lincolnshire,
Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. As
with the North of England division,
considerable progress was made
during the year, assisted by good
revenue growth, but reflecting similar
business efficiencies. South Yorkshire
Newspapers performed particularly
well and achieved substantial growth
in the circulation of its flagship title,
the Doncaster Free Press. North Notts
Newspapers also had an excellent
year with a highlight being the
conversion of the Ashfield Chad from
a free distribution newspaper to a
paid-for title achieving a weekly
circulation of over 12,000 copies. 
The East Midlands division, which
publishes throughout much of
Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and
parts of East Anglia, operates in
markets where revenue growth was
more difficult and below the Group
average. Progress was made at
Lincolnshire Newspapers following
the earlier re-organisation of its
newspaper portfolio and the launch 
of a new free newspaper. The overall
improvement in profitability reflected
good control over costs and the
results of initiatives such as the
launch of an up-market property
magazine in Peterborough and the

conversion of the monthly free title,
Peterborough on Sunday, to a weekly
publication.
Revenues in the South Midlands were
virtually flat year-on-year and, in those
circumstances, the achievement of a
modest improvement in profitability
was particularly creditable. Whilst
recruitment revenues improved as the
year progressed, the run rate still
showed a small deficit at the year-end
and a 6% reduction over the year as
a whole. The division publishes
throughout Northamptonshire and
Bedfordshire and is present in
Hertfordshire, Warwickshire,
Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire.
Improved efficiencies were achieved
through the consolidation of pre-press
and finance departments across the
division and several lifestyle
magazines were launched.
Revenue growth in the south of
England fell marginally short of the
Group average, a reflection of the
more difficult economic conditions
generally experienced in the south
east of the country. Good control of
costs enabled the division to make
further progress. Headquartered in
Portsmouth, the division publishes in
the eastern part of Hampshire and
extensively throughout East and West
Sussex. We are now benefiting from
the successful installation of a new
advertising and sales ledger system,
which provides a common platform
for the entire region. This has resulted
in improved operational efficiencies
and new revenue opportunities.
Circulations
The message from our weekly
circulation figures is resoundingly that
local news sells. A 1.3% increase
means that we have now achieved
seven consecutive years of circulation
growth for our weekly titles. Over the
years, we have continued to invest in
content, design and colour availability
to ensure that we continue to appeal
to readers and meet advertisers’
needs. Approximately half of the
Group’s 241 titles are paid-for weekly
newspapers, more than are owned by
any other UK publisher. 
Despite the evident demand for local
news, this has not translated into
increased circulations for our daily
newspapers which remain in modest
but stubborn decline. After adjusting
for planned reductions in bulk sales,
underlying circulations were down by
2.5%. Within that overall figure, there
were several encouraging
performances, notably the continued
growth in the sale of the Blackpool
Gazette and real progress towards
stability in Wigan and from our two
evening newspapers in
Northamptonshire. However, the
overall performance remains
disappointing despite considerable
efforts around the Group to bring
about an improvement. Through the
newly constituted Daily Newspaper
Sales Forum and individually at local
level, these efforts have been
redoubled to encourage a reversal in
the trend towards casual purchase
and away from 6-day home delivery.
Part of this initiative involves a more
sophisticated approach to canvassing,
utilising database technology. The
Group continues its policy of gradually
reducing the inclusion of bulk sales in
published circulation figures.
Content
Community involvement and the
quality and relevance of editorial
content are fundamental to successful
local newspaper publishing. Johnston
Press sets the highest editorial
standards backed by investment to
enable editors and their newsrooms
to meet the needs and aspirations of
the local communities in which they
publish. Editors are given absolute
freedom to determine both content
and their editorial approach within 
the guidelines set out in the Press
Complaints Commission’s Code 
of Practice.

Chief
Executive’s REVIEW
With 241 titles it is impossible to do
justice to the huge range of content
which is published by Johnston
Press. Some examples follow and
further details of the ways in which
our newspapers bring benefits to their
local communities are set out in the
Corporate Social Responsibility
Statement on pages 36 to 38.
Our titles have initiated a number of
important editorial campaigns during
the year, many of which have received
national recognition. The Fife Herald
was one of the first to highlight health
fears over the introduction of TETRA
masts to improve communications for
the emergency services. Several
campaigns initiated by the Yorkshire
Evening Post have been praised by
the Prime Minister, including “Life in
Leeds” which was launched to attract
extra funding for inner-city areas in an
attempt to address severe
deprivation. The Halifax Evening
Courier’s campaign to tackle a culture
of drink-fuelled late night violence has
achieved strong local support
resulting in real progress. The
Pocklington Post won thousands of
people a compensatory goodwill
payment following inconvenience and
damage suffered as a result of an
electrical power surge. The Sheffield
Star, whose local MP is the Home
Secretary, campaigned successfully
for a change in the law to hold family
members jointly responsible for the
welfare of their elderly relatives. A
Peterborough Evening Telegraph
campaign to tackle anti-social
behaviour also attracted praise from
the Prime Minister. The News in
Portsmouth has pursued a 
long-running campaign for recognition
of the gallantry of Second World War
seamen who kept the Soviets
supplied in the most treacherous of
conditions.
Investigative journalism also plays an
important part in the local publishing
agenda. Amongst numerous Yorkshire
Post investigations, those into
hospital waiting lists and serious
failings at care homes in the region
merit particular mention, the latter
being submitted for consideration 
by a Commons’ Health Select
Committee inquiry into abuse of the
elderly. The Yorkshire Evening Post
investigation into the activities of the Johnston Press  Annual Report and Accounts 2003
Part of Life
19
BNP was widely praised. New
regulations banning security staff from
membership of extreme political
organisations owed much to a
Bedford Times & Citizen investigation
into the Yarl’s Wood detention centre
riots. The Halifax Courier has
highlighted what some claim to be
one of Britain’s greatest industrial
catastrophes at the former Acre Mill in
Hebden Bridge where hundreds of
deaths were caused by asbestosis.
The revealing Yorkshire Evening Post
investigation into the finances of
Leeds United exposed remarkable
details down to the £20 spent
monthly on goldfish for the
Chairman’s office.
However, the vast majority of our
editorial coverage is concerned with
grassroots local issues which are of
vital importance to the particular local
community involved. There is no
better example of this commitment

than the monthly community
newsletters launched by South
Yorkshire Newspapers to serve very
small local communities such as
Rossington, Armthorpe and Askern. It
is strong local news coverage of this
sort which has resulted in numerous
awards for our titles during the course
of the year, such as the Southern
Reporter being nominated Best
Weekly Paid-For Newspaper in
Scotland for the second successive Johnston Press  Annual Report and Accounts 2003
Part of Life

year. Many other of our titles were
also recognised for their excellence.
But as well as informing, local
newspapers need to entertain. One
such story which reached national
prominence in 2003 concerned
George the budgie. Reported first by
the Wakefield Express, the story
concerned a budgerigar whose head
was turned red as a result of drinking
too much cherryade!
Electronic Publishing
The Group now has more than 160
local websites to complement our
local newspapers. Page impressions
continue to grow and by the year-
end were up by 40% to over 14
million per month. Revenue growth
remains strong and increased by 6%
on a like-for-like basis, despite a
reduction in the RIM companies’
non-profitable revenue streams. 
2003 was the third successive year
in which our electronic publishing
activities made an increased
contribution to profit.
Every company now regards its
websites as an integral part of its
publishing portfolio. All are based on
a common template but which allows
extensive tailoring to local needs in
terms of design and content whilst
ensuring cost efficiency and
centralised technical support. During
the year, our property and motors
sites were substantially upgraded with
numerous improvements in design
and functionality. The result is already
beginning to show in terms of both
content and revenues, for example,
we now carry at any one time around
200,000 cars for sale. A similar
upgrade of our jobs site has recently
been completed and we have re-
launched our on-line business
directory which provides listings for
many thousands of local businesses.
Further development plans are in
progress and there is an expectation
that revenues and page impressions
will continue to grow strongly.
Printing
2003 was a year of real progress for
the Printing Division which began to
reap the benefits of earlier
investments in new and upgraded
capacity. The primary focus of the
Printing Division is to meet the
requirements of the Group’s
publications. With virtually every
Johnston Press title now printed 
in-house or under an inherited RIM
long term printing contract in the
Northwest, there was also an
opportunity to take on additional
contract printing from several national
newspaper publishers. Better control
over costs and an end to the
disruption which followed the recent
extensive programme of press
upgrades resulted in significantly
improved profitability. 
Further investments were initiated
during 2003 to increase the colour
capability of the Leeds and
Sunderland presses. An additional
colour tower at Leeds will be
commissioned by the end of the first
quarter of 2004 and this will be
followed by the installation of digital
inking which will result in improved
quality and reduced waste.
Computer-to-plate technology was
also successfully introduced at Leeds
during the year. At Sunderland, we
are installing an additional colour
tower which requires a building
extension and we are also upgrading
the existing towers to enable them to
print full colour on both sides of the
web. Work continues on the major
Sheffield project which was
announced with the first half results
and good progress has been made in
identifying a suitable site and in terms
of the press specification. We expect
this project to be completed by the
end of 2006.

Chief
Executive’s REVIEW
During the year, we benefited from a
reduction in the price of newsprint
and prices have remained broadly
unchanged for 2004. We have also
reduced further the number of
suppliers to the Group. This reflects
the reliability now being achieved in
deliveries and quality and will enable
us to reap further efficiencies in our
pressrooms due to fewer set-up
changes.
Organisation and People
Our senior team remained unchanged
throughout the year both at Head
Office and amongst divisional
management and key functional
heads. The performance of Johnston
Press has undoubtedly benefited from
their considerable experience and
high motivation.
A number of important appointments
were made during the year, including
several at company managing
director level. Four new managing
directors were appointed in the
Printing Division, three from outside
our immediate industry sector, an
initiative which is already paying
considerable dividends. During the
year, a large number of employees
attended in-house training courses
covering a wide range of topics and
disciplines. We continually seek to
make improvements to our training
programmes to ensure that our
employees develop the skills they
require to fulfil their existing roles and
develop their careers with the Group.
To increase the depth of potential
managerial talent available to the
Group, we have introduced a
Commercial Trainee Leadership
Programme under which we have
recruited a number of young
university graduates who will receive
ongoing training, guidance and
workplace experience to develop 
their talents.

We remain abreast of the continuing

relates to employment and in many
areas we are ahead of the legislative
requirements. For example, we have
already initiated plans to improve
communications and consultation
with all of our employees and we are
also actively seeking ways of
increasing diversity, especially
amongst our journalists so that our
editorial departments more closely
reflect the mix of the communities in
which they are based.
As a Group, we recognise the
overwhelming importance of our 
staff to the success of the business.
During the year, with shareholder
approval, we introduced a Share
Incentive Plan and, given the
performance achieved in 2003, this
will result in all qualifying employees,
representing the vast majority of those
we employ, receiving free shares in
Johnston Press. To safeguard the
funding position of our defined benefit
pension schemes, we injected £12.6
million of cash and we made
significant improvements to our
defined contribution pension schemes
and related benefits. We remain
committed to being a progressive
employer and will continue to take
steps which recognise the importance
and value of all of our staff.

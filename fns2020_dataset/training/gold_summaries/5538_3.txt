 I am delighted to report on our results for the year to 30 September 2007 during which pro-forma EBITDA, which
excludes the impact of batch disposals, increased by 3.7% to £526 million. Profit before tax and exceptional
items of £301 million resulted in adjusted earnings per share of 39.6p, an increase of 15.8% over the prior year.
Accordingly, the Board is recommending an increase of 15.6% in the dividend paid to shareholders, giving a total
for the year of 15.6 pence per share. Dividend cover based on adjusted earnings per share is 2.5 times. The final
dividend of 10.4 pence will be payable on 21 January 2008 to shareholders on the register on 28 December
2007.
During the year we continued to return cash to shareholders through a combination of our share buy-back
programme and dividend payments. We purchased 102.9 million shares in the year at a cost of £658 million
(excluding associated costs). In addition, we paid £79 million of dividends and therefore returned a total of £737
million to shareholders during the year. At the preliminary results presentation in November last year we
announced that we intended to return at least the same level of cash to shareholders as we did in the year to
September 2006. The total returned this year of £737 million compares to a total return in the previous year of
£463 million, representing an increase of 59%. Taking into account the cash flow needs of the business, we
expect to continue the share buy-back programme in the current financial year. Since 30 September we have
purchased 3.5 million shares at a cost of £21 million.
At 30 September 2007 the ratio of underlying net debt to EBITDA was 7 times. The Board considers this to be
the optimal leverage level for the Group based on the current financing structure. We announced at our interim
results presentation in May that we expected, subject to market conditions, the refinancing of the Unique
securitisation to be completed by the end of the calendar year. However, to avoid pricing new long-term debt at
a time of uncertainty in the debt markets, we consider that a delay into 2008 is appropriate.
Our performance over the past year represents another period of solid growth in a challenging environment
which reflects our ongoing commitment to improving the quality of our pub estate through churn and capital
expenditure and also the impact of our share buy-back programme. We will remain focused on meeting the
challenges of both changing consumer demand and the smoking ban and providing attractive financial returns
to our shareholders.

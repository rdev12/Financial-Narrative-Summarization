 04 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com
During the period under review Anglo Asian 
made excellent progress as a significant 
gold/copper/silver producer in Caucasia. 
With a solid production profile and low 
operating costs at our flagship Gedabek 
gold/copper/silver mine (‘Gedabek’) located 
in western Azerbaijan, as well as favourable 
commodity prices, we have enjoyed a period 
of increasing profitability for the year to 
3104December 2011 (‘FY 2011’). To this end, 
I am delighted to report that the Company 
recorded a 60% increase in profit before tax 
of US$31.6 million (2010: US$19.8 million) 
and a 37% increase in gross profit of 
US$43.0 million (2010: US$31.4 million). 
In addition, in line with our strategy to build 
a multiple gold mine company and unlock 
our intrinsic value, we have implemented 
defined exploration and development 
programmes across our 1,962 sq km 
portfolio of prospective copper and gold 
assets in Azerbaijan. At Gedabek, we 
accomplished a milestone post-period end, 
announcing a 50% upgrade in our JORC 
resource to over 1 million ounces of gold in 
the Measured and Indicated classifications; 
at our 300 sq km Gosha Contract located 50 
km away from Gedabek, we announced that 
the Government of Azerbaijan had approved 
a development and production programme 
and we are now continuing with exploration 
with a view to establishing our second 
mining project in Azerbaijan; and at our 
Ordubad Contract Area we announced 
a Notice of Discovery in April 2012. 
In terms of gold and silver production from 
Gedabek’s open pit, heap leach operation in 
FY 2011, the mine produced 57,068 ounces 
of gold at an average cash operating cost of 
US$448 per ounce. This positions Gedabek 
as a low cost producer. Additionally, the 
Company produced 39,086 ounces of silver. 
During the year we sold 49,304 ounces of 
gold at an average price of US$1,573 per 
ounce and 34,593 ounces of silver at an 
average price of US$35 per ounce. The 
difference between gold sold and gold 
produced is for two reasons. Firstly, the 
Government of Azerbaijan takes title to 
12.75% of all produced metals and secondly, 
there is usually a timing difference between 
gold production and gold sales.
We also enjoyed strong copper production 
at Gedabek from our Sulphidisation, 
Acidification, Recycling and Thickening 
(‘SART’) plant. In FY 2011 we exceeded our 
target of 525 tonnes of copper and produced 
611 tonnes of copper, 134,240 ounces silver 
and 200 ounces of gold. Total sales of copper 
concentrate of US$5.0 million were recorded 
in FY 2011 (2010: US$ nil). The Company’s 
copper concentrate stockpiles currently total 
743 tonnes copper, 200 ounces gold and 
162,000 ounces of silver. Anglo Asian is in 
detailed discussions with various parties 
regarding finding a long-term sales partner 
and will update on this progress in due course. 
Production was restricted to 9,925 ounces 
of gold post period end for Q1 2012, due to 
an unusually harsh winter. However, we still 
expect that the reduced level of production 
for Q1 2012 will be compensated for during 
the course of the year and that our internal 
target of 54,000 ounces of gold for 2012 will 
be achieved. Silver production from our heap 
leach operation remained on track totalling 
7,670 ounces for the quarter. Copper, silver 
and gold production from our SART operations 
totalled 148 tonnes of copper concentrate, 
34,666 ounces of silver and 27 ounces 
of gold for the first quarter. 
To ensure the long-term success of Gedabek 
as a producing entity and obtain the best 
return for shareholders, we are looking to 
improve gold recovery rates and in turn to 
extend the life of mine. In May 2012, following 
a pre-feasibility study carried out by Arcadis 
Chile, the Company announced that it intends 
to construct an agitation leaching plant at 
“ I am delighted to report that the Company 
recorded a 60% increase in profit before tax 
of US$31.6 million (2010: US$19.8 million).”

Gedabek. The plant will have the capacity 
to treat 100 tph of ore and has an expected 
capital cost of US$52 million including 
construction of the tailings dam and all 
related infrastructure. The Company is in 
the process of seeking approval from the 
Government of Azerbaijan for construction 
of the agitation leaching plant.
Gedabek is an open pit mining operation, which 
currently utilises a conventional heap leach 
process and a resin adsorption recovery plant. 
The heap leach process required less capital 
than the proposed agitation leaching plant 
to establish. However, heap leaching has 
limitations with regards to the size of ore 
being leached (-25mm), which results in gold 
recoveries of circa 70% with leaching cycles 
extending up to typically a year depending on 
the ore mineralogy. In comparison, agitation 
leaching of milled ore can deliver higher 
recoveries with the immediate production 
of gold.
The agitation leaching plant will process 
high grade ore and additional resources that 
are not suitable for Gedabek’s current heap 
leaching processing operation, together with 
spent ore from the leach heaps to further 
improve total gold recoveries. Agitation 
leaching recovery rates have been initially 
estimated at 85% for oxide material and 69% 
for sulphide material although the Company 
is carrying out further tests to see if these 
recovery rates can be improved. In May 2012 
the International Bank of Azerbaijan (‘IBA’) 
provided a US$7.5 million loan at an annual 
interest rate of 12% as part of the finance required 
for this project. The Company is in advanced 
discussions regarding additional debt funding 
and will update shareholders in due course. 
As I mentioned briefly, in April 2012, we were 
delighted to announce a resource upgrade 
to 48,138,979 tonnes at 0.825 g/t gold for 
1,276,422 ounces of gold in the Measured, 
Indicated and Inferred categories (a 61% 
increase from the previous JORC resource 
estimate dated October 2010); 0.197 % 
copper for 94,890 tonnes (a 93% increase); 
and 6.66 g/t silver for 10,305,653 ounces 
(a 36% increase) at a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t 
gold. Recent drilling completed since the 
resource estimate indicates the significant 
potential to continue upgrading and increasing 
the size of the Gedabek deposit. Consequently, 
we are planning to conduct a further 24,567 
metre drilling programme and complete a 
JORC compliant ore reserves estimate in 
Q2 2012. 
On the corporate front, we continue to work 
closely with the Government of Azerbaijan. 
We are grateful for the level of support it 
gives us as we continue to develop Gedabek, 
the first gold mine in Azerbaijan in modern 
times, and to advance our other Contract 
Areas, Gosha and Ordubad, with the vision of 
commissioning future mining operations and 
building a mid-tier gold and base metal 
mining company in the country. 
In terms of financing, we have a strong 
relationship with the IBA, which is majority 
owned by the Government of Azerbaijan. With 
our increasing profitability in FY 2011 we 
significantly reduced our debt (which peaked 
at US$43.7 million in March 2010 following 
Gedabek’s mine development in 2008–2009) 
to US$13.1 million as at 31 December 2011 
(2010: US$30.6 million). Net debt, being 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings less 
cash and cash equivalents, reduced to US$3.2 
million at 31 December 2011 (2010: US$25.5 
million) and cash in the bank stood at US$9.9 
million (2010: US$5.1 million). In addition, 
during 2011, the Company repaid its US$1.0 
million loan from the Company’s CEO Reza 
Vaziri bringing the outstanding loan balance 
to US$ nil. 
It must be noted that we have a Production 
Sharing Agreement in place with the 
Government of Azerbaijan based on the 
established Azeri oil industry model. Up until 
the time we have recovered all of our carried 
forward, unrecovered costs, the Government 
of Azerbaijan effectively takes 12.75% of 
commercial products of any mine we bring 
into production, with Anglo Asian taking 
87.25%. We expect to continue retaining 
87.25% of the commercial products until at 
least the end of 2012 based on costs incurred 
to date and, with the construction of the 
agitation leaching plant, this level of recovery 
is expected to continue beyond 2012.
In 2011 Anglo Asian generated revenues of 
US$83.8 million (2010: US$72.0 million) as a 
result of gold, silver and copper concentrate 
sales from the Gedabek mine. US$78.8 million 
of the revenue (2010: US$72.0 million) was 
generated from the sale of Anglo Asian’s 
share of the production of dore bars for the 
year which comprised 49,304 ounces of gold 
and 34,593 ounces of silver (2010: 57,398 
ounces of gold and 35,922 ounces of silver) 
at an average price of US$1,573 per ounce 
and US$35 per ounce respectively (2010: 
US$1,241 per ounce and US$22 per ounce). 
In addition, Anglo Asian generated revenue 
from the sale of copper concentrate of 
US$5.0 million (2010: US$ nil). 
The Company incurred mining cost of sales of 
US$40.7 million (2010: US$40.6 million) and 
therefore reported a gross profit of US$43.0 
million for 2011 (2010: US$31.4 million). 
Maintaining good health, safety, social and 
environmental standards is a top priority for 
the Company and accordingly we have a 
Health, Safety, Environment and Technology 
Committee (‘HSET’) at Board level, under the 
chairmanship of Professor John Monhemius, 
a Non-executive Director of the Company. 
This committee, which meets at least twice 
a year, has the responsibility to oversee all 
aspects of the HSET performance of the 
Company and to make recommendations 
to the Board. We have approximately 500 
personnel working in the Company. 
The local community remains an important 
focus for us. Our main project in 2011 was to 
fund and construct a school for 300 students 
in Arixdam, the closest village to the Gedabek 
mine. This is now up and running successfully. 
Additionally, we continue to finance and train 
beekeepers, run a free internet café, and 
provide computer training courses to the 
local population. The Company has also 
financed and arranged the improvement of 
sections of roads in Arixdam and Duzyurd as 
well as the construction of a bridge and the 
building of a new pipeline to provide a potable 
water supply to the households residing 
within the vicinity of the Gedabek mine.
In summary, the past financial year has seen 
Anglo Asian cement its footprint in Caucasia 
as a significant gold producer in the region. 
Both solid production and a favourable gold/ 
copper price has resulted in a strong financial 
performance for your Company, which enabled 
us to accelerate the repayment of loans, 
reduce debt ahead of schedule and build 
a strong cash position, which stood at 
US$9.9 million at 31 December 2011. With 
significant stockpiles of copper concentrate 
carried forward into the new financial year, 
this opens up potential further cash flow 
for FY 2012 when sale contracts have 
been secured. 
Looking ahead to 2012 and beyond, whilst 
we remain committed to improving the 
operational efficiency and gold recovery rates 
at Gedabek, we expect to see continued solid 
gold, silver and copper production for the year .
We are also focused on producing a JORC 
compliant reserve estimate at Gedabek in 
Q2 2012 and will continue exploration and infill 
drilling throughout the remainder of the year 
to improve and upgrade the resource base. 
Furthermore, we remain committed to 
establishing a second mining project in 
Azerbaijan, Gosha, which will be another 
significant step for Anglo Asian as we focus 
on delivering exploration upside to become 
a leading mid-tier gold producer in Caucasia. 
We look forward to reporting on these 
developments in due course.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
our Anglo Asian employees, our partners, 
the Government of Azerbaijan, my fellow 
Directors, advisers and shareholders for 
their continued support and I look forward 
to updating shareholders regularly on our 
progress as we continue to build ourselves 
as a highly profitable, significant gold/
copper/silver producer in Azerbaijan.

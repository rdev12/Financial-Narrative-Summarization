 Key performance indicators (KPIs)
We use a range of performance indicators, both
financial and non-financial, to measure the delivery 
of the Company’s strategic objective – growth in
shareholder value through the efficient operation,
financing, and trading of output from our power
generation fleet, whilst maintaining the highest levels
of safety and environmental performance – and to
manage the business.
The most important of these measures are
considered KPIs and their targets are determined
annually during the business planning process. 
The KPIs are used by management to compare
actual performance during the year, and the latest
monthly forecasts, against the annual budgeted
targets. Our KPIs, both financial and non-financial,
are set out below.
Key performance indicators and financial highlights 24
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Financial KPIs Non-financial KPIs
Our financial key performance indicators address two key
aspects of the business, its profitability and its cash
generation:
Our non-financial key performance indicators address
other aspects of the business: safety, environmental and
operational performance:
Profit from operations (PFO)* Accident frequency rate (AFR)
Earnings per share (EPS)* Reportable environmental incidents
Free cash flow Technical availability
* Financial KPIs are presented excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements
Uni-Mar (Marmara),
Turkey
We consider PFO and EPS excluding exceptional
items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements
to be an appropriate indicator of performance, as
these measures:
■ exclude significant items which, by virtue of their
size or incidence, could potentially distort year-on-
year comparisons;
■ allow a better understanding of the financial
information presented, and specifically the Group’s
underlying business performance, by excluding fair
value movements on economic hedges;
■ assist shareholders and analysts who have expressed
a preference for the reporting of results without the
inclusion of the effects of exceptional items and
specific IAS 39 mark to market movements.
Presenting the Group’s segment and total PFO and
the Group’s EPS excluding exceptional items and
specific IAS 39 mark to market movements is
consistent with the way management measures the
Group’s performance in its budgets, forecasts and
management accounts on a day-to-day basis. 
The explanations of our KPIs follow. Profit from operations 
PFO is a measure of the operating profitability of the
Group. It excludes the impact of all non-operating
costs from subsidiaries, financing costs and income
tax expense, and therefore provides a comprehensive
measure of operational performance.
PFO excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39
mark to market movements has grown at an average
compound growth rate of 60% over the last three
years reflecting strong financial performance over the
period. The results for the current and prior year are
also presented in the consolidated income statement
on page 101.
This KPI is also used as one of the measures to
evaluate Regional Directors’ performance when
quantifying their annual bonuses (more information
can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report
on pages 83 to 95).
Earnings per share 
EPS is a measure of the overall profitability of the
Group and shareholder returns. It is defined as the
profit in pence attributable to each Ordinary Share 
in the Company, based on the consolidated profit for
the year, after deducting tax and minority interests.
Growth in EPS over time is indicative of the ability 
of the Group to add value.
EPS excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39
mark to market movements has grown at an average
compound growth rate of 47% over the last three
years. The calculation of this year’s result is presented
in note 11 to the financial statements on page 125.
This KPI is also used as one of the measures to
evaluate Directors’ performance when quantifying
their annual bonuses and as a performance condition
in their long-term incentive plans (more information
can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report
on pages 83 to 95). 
This KPI is also used as a performance condition in
the Company’s share-based payment schemes (more
information can be found in note 29 of the financial
statements on pages 139 to 143).

Free cash flow 
Power generation is a capital intensive business and
hence it requires the assets within the Group to
generate sufficient cash to repay the initial investment
in the assets, to provide returns for shareholders 
and to provide funds for future investment
opportunities. We define free cash flow as net cash
flow from operating activities after all operating costs,
maintenance capital expenditure, interest and tax. 
We consider this measure of cash flow to be a key
indicator of business performance as it measures the
cash generated from the underlying business
performance of continuing operating activities.
This is consistent with the way management measures
the Group’s performance in its budgets, forecasts and
management accounts on a day-to-day basis. This KPI is
also used as one of the measures to evaluate Directors’
performance when quantifying their annual bonuses
(more information can be found in the Directors’
remuneration report on pages 83 to 95).
Free cash flow has grown at an average compound
growth rate of 84% over the last three years
reflecting both an increase in the size of the Group
and strong operational and financial performance over
the period. The results for the current and prior year
are also presented in the consolidated cash flow
statement on page 104.
Non-financial KPIs
Accident frequency rate
Health and safety is of vital importance in our
business. It is important to provide employees with 
a safe place to work and any accident is disruptive 
to the running of the business. AFR is our reporting
standard and is defined as the number of lost time
accidents (LTAs) divided by the number of hours
worked, multiplied by 100,000. A LTA is an accident
where an individual is away from work for more than
one day and is an auditable indicator across a number
of industries.  
In 2007 the AFR for employees and contractors
combined was 0.12. This can be compared with 
0.16 for 2006. International Power intends to
maintain this improvement by establishing a target 
of 0.10 for 2008. This does not mean we tolerate
unsafe behaviour; we seek to have zero LTAs but
targets need to be realistic and challenging. 
The data underlying these calculations is submitted 
by individual plants directly into the corporate
reporting system.

Milford, 
Massachusetts Reportable environmental incidents
The environment and how we care for it is central 
to the business of International Power. We have
always had a policy of complying with all applicable
environmental regulations. Our power plants are
issued with environmental licences by the relevant
statutory authorities. Environmental licences require
that any environmental incident is reported. We
measure our ability to comply with environmental
regulations by recording the number of reportable
environmental incidents.
In 2006 there were 16 reportable environmental
incidents. In 2007 this declined to 13, a significant
improvement on the prior year. International Power
intends to consolidate this by establishing a target of
12 for 2008. This does not mean we tolerate
environmental incidents but targets need to be
realistic and challenging. 
The underlying data is submitted by individual plants
directly into the corporate reporting system.
Technical availability
Technical availability measures when a plant is
available for dispatch. Each of our plants will generally
be unavailable during some periods in the year due to
a combination of planned outages for maintenance
and unplanned outages due to operational problems.
Technical availability is calculated by first determining
the potential maximum amounts of electricity that
could be generated in the year, if all the plants were
operated at full output for the entire year. We then
deduct from this maximum amount the electricity
that could not be produced due to planned and
unplanned outages at the plants throughout the 
year. This number is then expressed as a percentage
of the potential maximum electricity that could be
generated, where all these quantities are calculated in
terms of electrical energy (GWh). An important part
of our business is ensuring that our merchant power
trading and power purchase agreements are closely
aligned to our operational activities and availability
planning is a key factor in this regard. The year-to-
year variance in the profile of planned outages
influences both the achieved and targeted availability.
In 2007 we achieved technical availability of 90%, an
increase above the 89.6% achieved in 2006. Taking
account of the outage plans for 2008 it is appropriate
to set a target of 90% for the plant portfolio.
This calculation is carried out using data submitted 
by the individual plants directly into the corporate
reporting system.

Note:
* The AFR for 2006 has been revised from 0.12 to 0.16 following the classification of an incident, which happened in December 2006, as a lost time accident (LTA) 
in September 2007. Financial highlights
The financial information included in the consolidated financial statements has been prepared on the basis 
of all applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU. A discussion of the policies we believe to be most critical in
considering the impact of estimates and judgements on the Group’s financial position and results of operations
are set out on pages 58 to 60.
In order to allow a full understanding of the financial information presented within the consolidated financial
statements, and specifically the Group’s underlying business performance, the Group presents its income
statement such that it separately identifies: 
■ the results excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements;
■ the effect of the exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements;
■ the total result.
The basis of preparation is outlined more fully in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 106.
However, in summary, those items that the Group separately presents as exceptional are items which, in the
judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence in order to
enable a proper understanding of the financial information. Those items that the Group separately present as
specific IAS 39 mark to market movements are those mark to market movements recorded in the income
statement which relate to: derivative contracts into which the Group has entered in order to economically
hedge certain of its physical and financial exposures; and fair value gains and losses on equity conversion
features embedded within convertible bonds, so as to separately identify a non-cash movement which, if the
conversion option is exercised, will ultimately be extinguished by the issue of equity.

Key performance indicators and financial highlights 30 Free cash flow
Free cash flow in 2007 at £653 million is 43% ahead of 2006. This increase was driven by full year
contributions from Coleto Creek, Levanto, Tihama and Indian Queens, together with strong profitability of 
the UK assets. In addition, dividends from associates and joint ventures increased year-on-year by £32 million.
Maintenance capital expenditure was also £57 million lower than in 2006. This was partially offset by an
increase in net interest and tax payments of £100 million, mainly as a result of acquisitions. Free cash flow 
was also enhanced by working capital reductions, including reduced margining and investment deposits with
counterparties.

Dividend
During the year, the Board introduced the payment of an interim dividend. The interim dividend of 2.77 pence
per Ordinary Share, was paid to shareholders on 30 October 2007. This interim dividend was calculated on a
fixed percentage (35%) of the previous year’s full year dividend. 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 7.39 pence per share, bringing the full year dividend to 10.16 pence
per share (2006: 7.9p), an increase of 29% year-on-year and representing a pay-out ratio of 37.5% of EPS 
(pre-exceptional and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements). This increase is in line with the Group’s policy
of progressively moving towards a dividend pay-out ratio of 40%.
Payment of this final dividend to shareholders registered on the Company share register on 23 May 2008 is due
to be made on 26 June 2008, following approval at the 2008 AGM, which will be held on 13 May 2008.
Outlook
We believe 2008 will be another year of growth after taking into account reduced output at Rugeley due to the
fitting of FGD equipment, lower UK coal spreads, and in the US subdued summer spark spreads following the
cool summer in 2007. We remain well positioned to finance and deliver on organic and acquisition growth
opportunities across our international portfolio.

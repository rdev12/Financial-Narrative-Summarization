 Corporate development
We have continued to make good 
progress in our strategy of focusing on 
chosen markets where we have scale 
and differentiation, completing the 
planned divestment of the non-core 
Analytic Solutions business for 
US$350m. In addition we invested some 
US$280m in acquisitions, bringing us 
complementary and differentiated 
technologies. We are increasingly 
prioritising investments which bring 
more balance between our defence/
security and commercial markets, with 
focus on products which can be applied 
to multiple end markets, as this increases 
return on investment. 
I am pleased to say that Excellence in 
Delivery, our transformation programme, 
has produced improved operational 
performance and significant efficiency 
improvements, in part driving an 
increase in underlying EPS of 12%. 
We intend to expand the programme 
and we estimate that the run rate of 
efficiency savings at the end of 2013 
will increase from £65m to £75m. 
Underlining our ongoing commitment 
to technology investment, we invested 
£129m on Research and Development 
in our core businesses, including £70m 
of company funded investment or 
Private Venture, representing 5.2% 
of revenue.
It is our ability to generate cash which 
provides us with the funds to continue 
our significant investment in the 
business and pay a progressive dividend 
to shareholders. Our free cash flow was 
excellent, with strong operating cash 
conversion of 95%. 
Shareholder distributions
In March 201 1 we announced a 
programme to return surplus capital to 
shareholders through a share buy-back 
of up to £150m. This share buy-back 
programme was completed in 
November with a total of 76m 
shares purchased. 
Cobham has high dividend cover, 
a strong balance sheet after the share 
buy-back and a highly cash generative 
business model. As a demonstration 
of confidence in the Group’s future 
prospects, the Board has decided 
to make a one-off step change to 
the 201 1 ordinary dividend and is 
recommending a final dividend of 6.20 
pence (2010: 4.372 pence). Together 
with an interim dividend of 1.80 pence 
(2010: 1.628 pence), this will result in a 
total dividend of 8.0 pence (2010: 6.0 
pence) per share, an increase of 33% 
on the prior year.
The Board
We announced in November 201 1 that 
Andy Stevens, Cobham Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO), had decided to take 
early retirement due to the recurrence 
of a long term serious back injury. 
I have temporarily assumed the 
position of Executive Chairman, with 
Andy remaining on the Board to assist 
with the management of the Group 
until a new CEO is appointed. The 
process for finding a replacement 
is making progress.
Alison Wood joined the Board as a 
Non-executive Director in July 201 1. 
Alison brings to the Board deep insight 
of defence and security markets as well 
as related technology issues through 
her 1 7 year career at BAE Systems, 
prior to becoming Global Director 
Corporate Development & Strategy 
for National Grid plc. 
Peter Hooley retired as a Non-executive 
Director at the conclusion of Cobham’s 
Annual General Meeting in May 201 1, 
after nine years service. I would like to 
thank Peter for his wise counsel and 
assured contribution as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. Michael Wareing has 
taken over as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, drawing on his considerable 
financial experience as a former Chief 
Executive of KPMG International.
Outlook
We have made significant steps towards 
focusing the portfolio on markets where 
we have technical differentiation and 
leading positions. Excellence in Delivery 
has achieved real operational 
improvements and better-than-
expected efficiency savings and we have 
a strong balance sheet and a highly cash 
generative business model, giving us the 
flexibility to examine attractive 
acquisition opportunities and increase 
shareholder distributions. The US 
Government has confirmed defence 
and security priorities that favour 
Cobham and has made some progress 
in reconcilling these to budgetary 
imperatives. The continued delivery of 
the strategy gives the Board confidence 
that we will continue to make progress 
over the medium term.

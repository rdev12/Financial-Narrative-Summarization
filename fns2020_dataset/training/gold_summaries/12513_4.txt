Group at a Glance
One of Britain’s biggest food producers
Premier Foods is one of the largest 
ambient food suppliers in the UK 
manufacturing, distributing and 
selling a wide range of branded 
and non-branded foods. 
In 2013, Premier Foods 
generated revenues of £1.3bn 
employing around 8,000 people, 
operating from over 35 sites 
across the UK.
Our sites are dedicated to 
manufacturing high quality, great 
tasting, everyday food products 
which consumers know and love. 
We have a broad stable of leading 
British brands, many of which 
are household favourites. These 
include our eight Power Brands 
of Ambrosia, Batchelors, Bisto, 
Hovis, Loyd Grossman,  
Mr. Kipling, Oxo and Sharwood’s 
as well as many other iconic 
British food brands.
The business is organised into 
two divisions: Grocery and Bread. 
The Bread division includes 
our Baking and Flour Milling 
operations and is managed by 
a dedicated team. During the 
course of 2013 the business was 
restructured to remove excess 
capacity and improve efficiency 
and effectiveness. In January 
2014 we announced a conditional 
agreement to establish a joint 
venture with The Gores Group. 
This will help secure significant 
new investment for the Hovis 
business, whilst allowing Premier
Foods to share in the expected 
future benefits of this investment 
through retaining a 49% stake 
in the business. Approval of the 
Hovis joint venture is subject 
to shareholder approval and is 
expected to be completed by the 
end of April 2014.
A summary of the Grocery and 
Bread divisions is shown on 
the opposite page. The entire 
Bread division will transfer to 
the Hovis joint venture with the 
exception of the Andover Mill and 
the Charnwood Foods Business 
which will remain with the Group.
Within the Business Overview, 
Strategic Review and 
Performance Review sections 
we are reporting results on an 
underlying basis including the 
results of the Bread business 
to enable comparison with 
the results of 2012. Within the 
Financial Statements we report 
results on the basis of continuing 
operations and this excludes the 
Bread business as it was held as 
‘assets held for sale’ as at the 
year end.

 Introduction
I am pleased to report a year of
significant and positive change for 
the Group. As a result of the sale of
Bullock Construction, which was
approved by shareholders on 16
September 2005, the Group has been
able to underpin its financial position.
The total consideration was £42.2m,
resulting in a net cash inflow of £18m
after the repayment of intra group
balances. In June, Brian May was
appointed as the Group’s new Chief
Executive. Since his arrival he has
visited all of the Group’s businesses
and as part of these visits has
completed, with the support of the
subsidiary company directors and the
Board, a further review of its legacy
contract exposures. It is the Board’s
view that these legacy contract issues
have now been provided for consistent
with the expected level of cash
recoveries from those contracts. 
The Group’s activities have been
reorganised in line with its core skills
base and it is now operating from a
much reduced overhead base. Actions
have been taken to reduce the
Group’s exposure to higher risk, lower
margin contracts and the Group’s
businesses are now winning new work
through partnering agreements with
their key clients. With the successful
introduction of the control mechanisms
which were noted in this report last
year and which have now been fully
implemented, the Group’s overall risk
profile has been greatly reduced. 
Group strategy and name change
The second half of the year has seen
continued success from the Group’s
strategy of focusing on the market
sectors in which we have excellent
skills and extensive experience.
Following the sale of Bullock, 
Brian May will look to develop 
this strategy and create even greater
focus on the Group’s core strengths 
in its specialist areas of activity. 
This is outlined in more detail in 
the Chief Executive’s review 
that follows. 
The past year has been an incredibly
difficult and challenging period for the
Group and there has been a great 
deal of change, including the sale and
closure of a number of the Group’s
businesses. Reflecting this more
focused approach, the Board’s
proposal to change the Group’s name
to Renew Holdings plc was approved
by shareholders at the EGM held on
12 January 2006.
Results and dividend
Group turnover for the year ended 
30 September 2005 was £455m
(2004: £459m) and profit before tax
was £1.2m (2004: loss before tax 
of £6.9m). The resulting earnings per
share for the period was 3.46p
compared to a loss per share last 
year of 11.62p. Net assets on 
the Group balance sheet as at 
30 September were £4.7m with 
a cash balance of £13.6m and
indebtedness of £12m. 
Group turnover from ongoing
operations was £330m (2004: £349m).
Profit from ongoing operations before
exceptional items was £2.7m (2004:
£0.3m). The total provisions made
during the year against legacy
contracts in our ongoing businesses,
which were procured during 
2002-2003 and all of which are now
nearing financial agreement with 
the client, was a further £15.4m. 
The restructuring of ongoing
businesses and other exceptional
items amounted to £4.4m.
The Board is recommending the
payment of a dividend of 0.2p in the
current year, and having returned to
the dividend list, it intends to pursue 
a progressive dividend policy. 
Lovell Pension Scheme
The Group adopted FRS 17 with effect
from 1 October 2003. The Group has
again this year implemented a number
of pension transfer initiatives to both
deferred members and pensioners 
of the scheme that resulted in a
reduction of the pension scheme fund
deficit of £3.7m with a total cost of
£1.1m. The benefit of this further
reduction in deficit, along with an
improved investment performance
after a review of investment strategy
by the fund’s Trustees, has resulted in
there being no FRS 17 liability as at 
30 September 2005. The resultant
asset has not been recognised in the
Group balance sheet in accordance with
the guidance established by FRS 17.

chairman’s statement The second half of the year has seen continued

on the market sectors in which we have excellent
skills and extensive experience. 
Outlook
At 31 December 2005 the Group’s
order book stood at £210m 
(2004: £234m). This accords with the
Group’s focus on the specialist areas
of activity that will form the core of its
strategy going forward and on lower
risk, higher margin contracting. By
continuing this focus and taking
advantage of the strong markets in
which its businesses operate, the
Board is confident that the Group is
now capable of delivering reliable and
growing cash backed profits.

Property
The Group continues its strategy of
realising value and cashflow from its
portfolio of UK and US property
assets. These assets are being actively
managed, and during the year £1.3m
was written off the value of two of the
Group’s UK properties in order to
facilitate their future sale. During the
year, the Group realised £2.6m 
(2004: £4.4m) from property sales. 
Employees
This year has again been a difficult one
for our employees and the Board
appreciates the continued hard work,
commitment and loyalty they have
demonstrated throughout the period.
Board and Management
With the appointment of Brian May as
Chief Executive, I stepped down as
executive Chairman and took up the
role of non-executive Chairman as
from 1 October 2005.

Our innovative mortgage broking strategy
helped double distribution proﬁts and
substain new lending margins in a very
competitive market
Group Chief Executive’s review
Overview
In 2002, we continued to make good progress
against our twin strategic goals of becoming
the UK’s leading specialist lender and an
innovative retailer of property and financial
services.
During the year we lent a record £5.8 billion.
This was all secured against residential or
commercial property while The MarketPlace
and Charcol, our two retail financial services
brands, both experienced substantial growth
as record numbers of consumers decided
they preferred product choice and
independent advice when buying 
financial services.
A number of customers closed their savings
or mortgage accounts during 2001 having
received their free shares when we floated.
2002 was the first year in which we felt the
full financial impact of their departure.
Fortunately, our new lending growth coupled
with significant additions to balances in our
value savings products and our decision to
change the period over which we spread
lending incentives went a long way to offset
this and total interest income fell by only 
£1 million to £441 million.
We continued to invest in our advice brands
in 2002, confident that, in times of uncertainty,
the value of expert help becomes ever more
evident to consumers seeking to “weather
the storm”. Research shows 
that our new TV advertising campaign for 
The MarketPlace was particularly successful 
in communicating the fact that we offer
consumer choice and we continued to 
use Charcol’s successful existing press
campaign to drive sales to new record levels.
Lending
37% of Group revenues
We have maintained the momentum in our
Lending business with balances up 9% 
year-on-year to £20.5 billion. Divisional profit
before tax increased 13% to £210 million.
This increase reflected the growth in lending
balances, a flat cost base and a growth in
lending interest margins from 1.27% to 1.37%.

The interest margin increase included the
impact of our decision to spread lending
incentive costs over the early redemption
clawback period instead of the first twelve
months of the loan.This change aligned us with
the market and added £19 million to our
profits in the year, relative to the previous basis.
Our policy of lending selectively did not hamper
our growth. New residential lending grew from
£2.4 billion to £4.6 billion.This included the
purchase of a 6,000 customer, £650 million loan
book from General Motors Acceptance
Corporation in September 2002.
By the end of the year, our residential loan
book had grown by £800 million to 
£16.8 billion, as the high level of remortgaging
evident across the market offset our significant
growth in new lending.
Our commercial and housing association
lending businesses both had good years adding
nearly £1 billion to the book which reached
£3.7 billion by year-end.The commercial lending
team continued to be successful, originating
their own secured property lending and were
able to take advantage of their growing
reputation in the loan syndication market to
make £0.9 billion of loans during the year. By
year-end, commercial lending balances had
grown 41% to £2.2 billion. Our housing
association team built on their position as a
major lender in the market to grow their
balances by 30% to £1.5 billion.
Credit quality remains good, with arrears levels
continuing to decline both in absolute terms
and in proportion to the book. Our book is
well diversified with 23% of our loans being
buy-to-let, 59% are other residential mortgages
and 18% commercial and housing association
loans. All our lending is secured on property and
our buy-to-let lending, which accounts for only
a quarter of our book, has an average loan-to-
value ratio of 59% and arrears levels of less than
one third of the overall UK residential average.
During the year we increased bad debt
provisions on our Balance Sheet and in our
securitisation vehicles by £12 million to almost 
£56 million, in view of current economic
uncertainty. We continue to believe that we are
well provided for, given our residential lending
arrears experience; the low average 42%
loan-to-value of our residential loan portfolio;
the quality of our commercial and housing
association books; and the fact that we have no
unsecured lending to individuals or companies.
In December, we announced that the European
mortgage processing and outsourcing joint
venture with ALLTEL, which commenced in
2000, was to be discontinued. Both partners
believed that further investment in the joint
venture could not be justified given the current
uncertainty created by changes in mortgage
regulation in the UK and Continental Europe,
and the slower than expected development in
the European mortgage outsourcing market.
We have made an exceptional write-off of
£15 million in our 2002 results in respect
of our share of the system development and
associated costs.
Our mortgage customers have not been
affected by these changes and our mortgage
processing costs will not increase.

Savings
16% of Group revenues
In 2002, we stabilised our savings business
after experiencing significant ‘carpetbagger’
outflows in the prior year. During the year
balances grew £300 million to £13 billion.
This has been achieved by the continued
success of innovative products such as
Premier Saver, and by the launch of other 
new products that build the relationship
between retail deposits and regulated
investments by introducing new customers 
to our financial advisers.
The interest margin on savings was £1 18 million
in 2002, a decrease of £24 million on 2001.
This reflects the full and final impact of
‘carpetbagger’ outflows, combined with
reduced deposit spreads in a lower interest
rate environment. T ogether these meant that
the savings interest margin fell from 1.1% to
0.9% during the year.
Distribution
36% of Group revenues
The Distribution business doubled profit
before tax to £28 million in 2002. Income
from financial services grew by 5% to 
£144 million while property services income
grew 7% to £115 million. By contrast
operating expenses were flat at £231 million.
This reflects a real reduction in underlying
costs offset by continued investment
in growing both the business and our
adviser base.
Financial services 
Our position as a diversified distributor of
financial services helps us offset short-term
declines in demand in any one product
area with sales growth in other areas.This
resilience is evident in our 2002 results which
reflect the quite different market conditions
experienced in various parts of our business.
In a strong mortgage market, our mortgage
broking related revenues grew by over
30% year-on-year. By contrast, demand for
equity-related investments fell significantly
as a result of the falling stock market.We
introduced a variety of new protected
investment products during the year.While
margins on these products are lower, our
growing sales force and increased adviser
productivity enabled us to limit the fall in
investment related revenues to 8% in a
market which fell 25%.
Because so many of our historic home and
contents insurance sales had been linked to
mortgages we had manufactured, our general
insurance business continued to be impacted
by high levels of mortgage redemption
experienced throughout the industry in these
times of very low interest rates.This decline
in mortgage-linked insurance revenues was
partly offset by our move to insurance
broking. As a result total insurance revenues
fell by just 6%.We will pay particular attention
to growing our insurance broking revenues
during 2003.
In mid 2002 we achieved our target of having
1,000 financial advisers eighteen months 
ahead of schedule and by the year-end had
1,061 advisers of whom 130 were in training.
We have now set our sights on reaching
1,300 advisers by the end of 2004. Having
said that, we have slowed wealth adviser
recruitment temporarily, until market
conditions improve.
Property services
Estate Agency revenue increased by 4%
in 2002 but, following our closure of
underperforming outlets in 2001, these
revenues were achieved through a retail
network that is approximately 10% smaller.
On a like-for-like basis, the current network
improved revenue per outlet by 8% and
outlet contribution by 14%.

and
Our surveying business had a particularly
good year with revenues growing by 26% and
profit by 50%. Over 85% of our surveyors’
income comes from other companies and
we finished the year by acquiring the 67
employee surveying business of Countrywide
Commercial bringing the total number of
BBG Surveyors fee earners to 272.
Costs
In 2002 Group pre-exceptional costs were
£446 million, £5 million less than in 2001. Our
cost income ratio fell from 63.3% to 61.3%.
This was the result of a number of actions.We
expanded our outsourcing relationship with
IBM and restructured some of our internal
service utilities, of which the most significant
was the creation of a single Human Resource
service centre.
Our staffing levels have continued to fall in
2002, despite the increase in our adviser
population to over 1,000. In 2002 our average
full time equivalent workforce was 6,680, a
reduction of 190 (3%) on the previous year.
By the end of the year we had achieved our
targeted £30 million reduction in costs
compared on a like-for-like basis with year-end
2000.We have also continued investment
in the business and our brands and a growth
in our adviser base from 936 to 1,061 during
the period.
We will continue to seek ways to improve our
cost income ratio in the future although this
will be offset by the growth of our distribution
businesses, which have a relatively high cost
income ratio compared to our lending
business.The attraction of distribution is that it
requires relatively little capital, so growing this
area improves Group return on equity.
Capital and Balance Sheet
The Group’s total assets grew to £25.4 billion
by the end of 2002, an 8% increase on 2001.
This asset growth occurred primarily as a
result of the increase in specialist lending
balances during the year. It has been financed
principally by two medium-term note issues
which attracted new investors to the Group.
During the year we actively managed our
capital base.We began a £150 million equity
buy-back programme in February and, by the
end of 2002, had purchased over £88 million
worth of shares. During the year we also
raised £150 million innovative Tier 1 capital
and issued £200 million of subordinated debt,
further improving the mix of our capital
and reflecting our confidence in our future
growth prospects.
The year ahead 
We have started the year well, but we live in
uncertain times.We will continue to drive for
improved operating performance in our
chosen markets and will be particularly
focused on taking advantage of the many
regulatory changes that have been proposed
by the Financial Services Authority.
We will also carefully evaluate the increasing
number of acquisition opportunities that
are emerging at this stage of the economic
cycle.We are potential acquirers of businesses
that offer us greater scale or complementary
skills in the markets in which we have chosen
to operate.
Christopher Rodrigues
Group Chief Executive
17 February 2003
Although the outlook for the
UK financial services and
property markets is uncertain,
the current year has started well.
We believe that the diversity of
our revenues positions us well for
these uncertain market conditions.

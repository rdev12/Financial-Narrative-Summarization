Strategic  
report
Chief Executive’s  
introduction
The focus of 2013 was the 
continued growth in Industrial 
Lighting and the repositioning 
of Obstruction Signals as 
a systems business offering 
monitoring and control to 
the major tower operators. 
Once again, Industrial Lighting 
posted significant growth of 
£23.0m, with strong contributions 
from all geographies driven 
by our ever-increasing sales 
force and industry-leading 
product performance. 
We have continued to address the key 
constraint on our growth, namely the 
need to recruit more sales people as well 
as refocusing our sales efforts in those 
areas more likely to deliver higher returns.
Dialight remains a great business that is 
well placed to enjoy real growth in its chosen 
markets. The fundamentals of the business 
and the story remain sound.
The following pages contain the Strategic report 
which provides an explanation of our business and 
how we operate (Our business model), information 
on our business objectives and how we plan to 
achieve them (Our objectives and strategy), details 
of how we measure our success towards achieving 
those objectives (Key performance indicators), 
a full review of our performance in the last year 
(2013 review) and finally details of the risks 
and uncertainties facing our business 
(Risk management). 
Signed on behalf of the Board

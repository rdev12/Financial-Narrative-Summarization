 Chief Executive’s review
OVERVIEW
easyJet has delivered a resilient 
performance in the 2016 financial 
year, in the midst of a challenging 
environment. Over four million more 
passengers flew with easyJet during 
the year reaching 73.1 million, and the 
Company achieved another year of 
record load factor at 91.6%. This reflects 
easyJet’s successful strategy of 
defending and maintaining market-
leading positions in high-traffic, slot-
constrained airports. 
Medium-term fundamentals across 
Europe remain robust with continued 
GDP growth supporting spending in all 
our major markets. Although low fuel 
prices continue to encourage increased 
capacity which impacts yields, easyJet 
has performed strongly in a highly 
competitive market by focusing on 
building number one positions in selected 
markets and strong cost control. The 
Company’s business model and strategy 
leave it well positioned to be a structural 
winner within its chosen markets in the 
overall European short-haul market.
Strong passenger growth and resilient 
revenue performance:
• Record number of passengers at 
73.1 million, increasing by 4.5 million 
(6.6%) during the year. Load factor 
also increased to a record level of 
91.6%, an increase of 0.1 ppts from 
last year, reflecting the attractiveness 
of easyJet’s network of destinations 
and frequencies at affordable prices.
• Capacity increased by 6.5%, with 
growth focused on strengthening 
easyJet’s leading network of number 
one positions at Europe’s 
primary airports.
• T otal revenue declined by 0.4% to 
£4,669 million (2015: £4,686 million). 
Revenue per seat decreased by 6.4% 
to £58.46 due to:
 – increased market capacity and 
aggressive pricing stimulated by 
a sustained low fuel price;
 – cooling of demand and reduced 
consumer confidence following 
multiple terrorism-related incidents;
We remain focused 
on our network 
advantage, digital 
leadership and offering 
our customers great 
low fares and high-
quality service.
 – higher holiday costs for UK 
travellers following the EU 
referendum and subsequent 
weakening of sterling; and
 – severe disruption during the year 
(due to strikes, severe weather, 
airport issues) which resulted in 
8,349 flights (2015: 6,789) being 
either cancelled, delayed over 
three hours or diverted.
• T otal impact of external events
(1)
 
during the year on profit before 
tax of an estimated £150 million.
• Non-seat revenue growth of 17% due 
primarily to tailoring our on-board 
product range, reflecting increasing 
knowledge about our customers.
T aking control on costs:
• T otal cost per seat improved by 2.0%, 
decreasing to £52.26. T otal cost per 
seat at constant currency
(2)
 improved 
by 4.6%, primarily driven by fuel price 
savings. T otal cost per seat excluding 
fuel increased by 2.6% due to the 
impact of foreign exchange and at 
constant currency improved by 
1.1%, slightly ahead of target.
• Our reinvigorated lean cost 
programme delivered savings 
of £95 million, in airport, ground 
handling and maintenance costs, 
as well as supplier management 
improvements, overhead reductions 
and benefits realised from 
lean basing.
• This partially offset increasing costs 
of disruption and underlying airport 
and ground handling cost inflation.
• Foreign exchange cost headwinds 
of £112 million.
• Pre-tax profit margin decreased 
by four percentage points to 10.6% 
(profit before tax of £495 million 
in the 2016 financial year versus 
£686 million in the 2015 financial 
year) mainly due to the decline 
in revenue and foreign 
exchange impact.
• easyJet continues to target flat cost 
per seat excluding fuel at constant 
currency for the 2019 financial year 
versus the 2015 financial year at 
normal levels of disruption.

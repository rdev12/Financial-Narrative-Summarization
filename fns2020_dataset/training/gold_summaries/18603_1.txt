 32 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
Market review There has been much recent debate over the state of the 
UK housing market and the impact that recent events in the world credit
markets, triggered by events in the US subprime sectors, will have in the
future. Many indicators point to a slowdown in the rate of house price
growth – in particular, falling levels of mortgage approvals, falls in certain
house price indices and slowing sales volumes from house builders.
Commentators vary between predictions of a severe fall in actual house
prices (as was the case in the early 1990s) and a soft landing where price
growth slows and possibly stagnates for a period.
Our view is that rates of house price growth are fundamentally determined by
two factors: the balance between supply and demand and levels of affordability. 
The UK is currently suffering from long-term imbalance between the supply
of housing stock and the amount required to support the increasing number
of households. In the ﬁrst seven years of this century, UK housing completions
averaged 166,000 per annum. Government initiatives have been announced 
to increase this level of supply to 240,000 (recently increased from 200,000)
per annum by 2016. Set against this are population forecasts indicating that
the UK population will rise from 60.6 million in 2006 to 65 million in 2016.
More importantly, the trends of immigration, an ageing population and an
increasing number of single person households will lead to an additional
requirement of 209,000 households per year to 2026. This is a continuation 
of the trend that has seen the numbers of households increase by 30% in 
the last three decades of the 20th Century – matched by a fall in the level 
of new housing built over the same period of 50%. It remains to be seen
whether, given the current planning environment, increased availability will 
be able to absorb both existing and future demand. 
As well as the imbalance at a total stock level, of equal importance is the
limited supply for the right type of dwelling at the right price in the right
location. For example, London and the South East has limited availability and
great levels of wealth generation. This has produced some of the largest price
increases we have seen over the last few years which, we believe, will help 
to sustain the market in this area for some time to come. We have some 
55% by value of our portfolio in this region.
Conversely, there appears to be oversupply in certain provincial cities of, 
in particular, recently built one- or two-bedroom city centre apartments
primarily built for the buy to let market. We have kept out of these more
speculative markets and therefore have virtually no exposure to this sector.

STRATEGY 33
The second key factor is the level of affordability, with many commentators pointing to the impact
this had on the housing market in the early 1990s. There are two main differences between that
period and now. Firstly, base rates between mid-1988 and mid-1992 did not drop below 10% 
and, at their peak, mortgage rates were approaching 17%. Current base rates are at 5.5%, having
fallen 0.25% since the time of our preliminary announcement. Secondly, the economic situation 
is far more robust – GDP at 3.3% in Q3 2007 (above the average long-term rate of 2.5%) and
employment levels are at a record high (in 1992 unemployment approached three million). 
One of the key measures of affordability is the ability of households to meet their normal
expenditure once they have paid all their housing costs. Research indicates that, whilst income net
of housing costs still exceeds household spend, the surplus is narrowing as a result of increased
mortgage costs arising from rate rises. The unwinding of relatively cheap ﬁxed rate loans may 
well reduce it further in the coming months but not to levels that would be likely to precipitate 
a severe correction in house prices. 
Consequently, whilst we are planning for a period of slower house price growth and are therefore
being more cautious in our acquisitions, we do not expect a wholesale and signiﬁcant fall in prices
in the short term. However, our long-term model can withstand short-term price ﬂuctuations and
we believe that the wide geographic spread, low average price and reversionary potential in our
portfolio will enable it to continue to deliver enhanced returns. 
Although the volume of transactions is relatively small, since the year-end sales values achieved 
on vacancy have exceeded our September vacant possession values by 4.0%.
Risk review The key risks to the Grainger business are:
• a severe long-term downturn in the UK housing market;
• signiﬁcant increases in interest rates; and
• a lack of availability of ﬁnance.
Dealing with each of these in turn:
Housing market We have assembled our unique residential portfolio over a signiﬁcant period 
of time and its current market value is substantially greater than cost. Moreover, much of the
portfolio is reversionary and the value that we will obtain by selling on vacancy currently exceeds
market value by over £600m (the ‘reversionary surplus’). 
The nature of our portfolio is inherently defensive in times of house price slowdown. It is
geographically diverse and, whilst one of its long-term strengths is a signiﬁcant exposure to the
high demand areas of London and the South East, we are not overly exposed to cluster risk. 
In other areas, house price growth tends to follow the South East but, coming from a lower base,
can show dramatic levels of increase. 
STRATEGY 34 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
The majority of our properties are unrefurbished and of relatively low value. This level of
affordability is a key element of continued and sustained demand for our properties when they
become available for sale. Our average vacant possession value is £205,000 (the UK average 
is £198,000) and 60% of the portfolio is below £250,000. Our exposure to the higher end 
of the market (>£500,000) which traditionally shows greater volatility is restricted to some 
279 properties out of our total UK-owned portfolio of over 14,000 units. We have found that
demand for our typical properties (affordable and offering potential for value appreciation 
through refurbishment) is resilient even in times of market slowdown. 
Operationally we manage our exposure to house price inﬂation by constant reviews of the
portfolio to ensure that we crystallise gains to maximise returns at the right time. We are also
diversifying our income streams (for example, fund management income) and our geographic
spread (investment in Germany) to spread risk.
Interest rates Our exposure to adverse interest rate movements is limited by adopting a prudent
hedging policy. At 30 September 2007, over 70% of group debt was hedged by being either ﬁxed
or subject to caps or swaps. The hedging instruments used and the ﬁxed rate debt have a variety
of maturity dates giving protection over the medium term.
Availability of ﬁnance At 30 September the group’s headroom amounted to £226m and the
average maturity of our debt was six years. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant maturity (a revolving facility of
£400m) is not until June 2010.
We guard against lack of liquidity by constantly recycling capital; for example, we raised £282m 
of third-party funding through equity and debt raising in the G:res1 fund during the course of 
the year.
The core business in particular is very cash generative – gross rents and property sales amounted
to £165m in the year. Whilst we spent £151m on new acquisitions, the vast majority of this can 
be stopped in adverse market conditions. Consequently we are able to reduce gearing levels and
improve liquidity quickly by cutting back on purchases if necessary. 
As explained above, the low value, unrefurbished nature of our portfolio means that it is very
liquid and easily realisable.
Operating review
General Despite the repercussions of the credit crunch in the banking markets in late summer, the
UK residential market showed strong levels of growth to the end of September – the Nationwide
and Halifax House Price indices recording gains of 9.0% and 10.7% respectively. Several regions
showed growth of over 15%, in particular Greater London at 18.6%.
Our own portfolio, with some 55% by value in London and the South East, showed an average
increase of 9.8%.

Our main operating divisions and the market value of each as a percentage of our total property
and investment assets are:
Core portfolio 57% Primarily our portfolio of properties subject to regulated tenancies. 
Retirement solutions 22% Our interests of home reversion and retirement-related assets. 
Fund management and 7% These are investments in managed funds (G:res1 and Schroders)
investments in residential and in Grainger GenInvest (our joint venture with Genesis Housing Group). 
joint ventures 
Development 4% Focused on relatively large scale residential or residential-led 
mixed-use developments. 
Continental Europe 10% Principally investment in German residential portfolios. 
These operating divisions are supported by our property and asset management divisions 
of over 100 staff based in our seven UK and one German ofﬁces.

Other assets (vacants, assured etc) 882 652
Market value £196m £141m
Vacant possession value £220m £160m
Trading performance in this division has been strong. Although the number of units sold has
declined from 787 to 661, as explained below, sales proceeds have increased marginally from
£126m to £128m, reﬂecting higher average values achieved (£193,000 compared to £160,000).
Margins on normal sales (i.e. when a property is sold on vacancy) have also improved from 
48.6% to 50.7%.
The number of sales has declined because we have made fewer investment sales (when a 
property is sold with a tenant in situ), down to 86 at a gross sales value of £17.2m and proﬁt 
of £9.7m, from 224 at a value of £31.3m and a proﬁt of £13.0m in 2006.
STRATEGY 36 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007
This is a trading portfolio and, as such, we make a number of these sales as a result of active
portfolio management where we feel that returns would not be signiﬁcantly enhanced by waiting
for vacancy in the usual way. The level of investment sales has been relatively high in recent years
as we have worked through assets acquired in major portfolios. We would expect the volumes 
to continue to decline in the future as this process is completed. 
We have been pleased with the levels of acquisitions in the year, enhanced by two major corporate
transactions. Firstly, The Tilt Estate Company Limited, bought for £48m and comprising a mixed
tenure estate of over 300 units in East Dulwich, London SE22 and secondly Portland House
Holdings Limited comprising 135 properties located across England and Scotland for £12m. 
In total we have acquired 863 units for £151m (2006: 462 for £70m).
Operating contribution for this division (comprising proﬁts on sale of trading and investment
assets together with net rents and other income, after deducting divisional overheads) amounted
to £81m (2006: £76m).
Retirement solutions

Interest in residential units (number) 5,952 3,003

We have retained our market leadership in the writing of home reversion plans, with a 40% market
share at 30 September 2007*. Of particular note has been our achievement in obtaining regulated
status from the Financial Services Authority in April of this year. This puts home reversion plans 
on a level footing with other equity release products which were regulated by virtue of being
mortgages. Although there was some market disruption during the period approaching the
regulation deadline, leading to a slowdown in acquisitions, we believe that, in the long term,
regulation will be a key factor in the continuing success of not only our business, but the home
reversion market in general. 
In the period, we sold interests in 139 home reversion property assets for £14.9m and recorded 
a proﬁt of £7.4m (2006: 110 assets for £12.5m and a proﬁt of £5.7m).
We have made signiﬁcant progress in building this business in the year, investing a total of £252m
on 2,899 assets (2006: £29m on 432 assets). These included the major acquisitions of the CHARM
portfolio (a ﬁnancial interest in some 1,287 equity mortgages from the Church Commissioners 
for £135m) and The Capital Appreciation Trust (Isle of Man) plc (‘CAT’) which comprises 911
sheltered housing units for £72m. This latter acquisition is signiﬁcant in that it enhances our product
offering in this sector, giving us the opportunity to provide more ﬂexible tenure alternatives from
rental and lifetime lease through to shared equity. 
Operating contribution from this division amounted to £8m (2006: £3m).

STRATEGY 37
This division has made signiﬁcant progress in the year, the highlight being the close of G:res1, our
market-rented fund. Total third-party investment in the fund stands at £159m, representing 78.4%
and investors include Mitsubishi Corporation, Achmea, APP , British Airways Pensions Fund, FF&P ,
LGPI, Nomura, Norsk Hydro, Storebrand, Swiss Re and the Universities Superannuation Scheme.
The fund itself grew considerably in the year with the acquisition of the Ability Portfolio (700 units
in East London for £205m) and NAV grew by 14% in the period from launch in November 2006
to the end of June 2007. 
Grainger GenInvest, our joint venture with Genesis Housing Group, has also shown strong growth
on the back of the London house price market – average increases in the value of the portfolio
amount to 24.7% and the value of our total investment has increased from £10m to £40m.
Including amounts lent by Grainger to the joint venture of £68m (2006: £58m) our total
investment is £108m (2006: £68m). 
Annualised fee income from our fund and property management activities now stands at £7m.
The contribution from this division (being share of proﬁts, dividends received, fee income and
share of revaluation surpluses in the year) amounted to £40m (2006: £5m).
We hope that current market conditions alongside political and social imperatives will mean that
the government and local authorities have to look more favourably towards the professional
private rented sector as a potential partner in providing some of the new housing supply to 2016.
We are engaged in this debate and are conﬁdent that the model we are creating will be well
placed to respond to any initiatives that are introduced.
Property services This division carries out the asset and day-to-day property management of 
our core portfolios and those of our co-invested funds. The division also now includes our lettings
team and regional sales and valuations. In this way we can provide a consistent level of service 
to each of the portfolios we manage.

We have been building our team and reﬁning our strategy for development so that it is more
aligned to the long-term ownership model of the group. We intend to continue to sell assets to
the open market to assist in generating cash ﬂows for the group, whilst also retaining some stock.
Good progress has been achieved on all major development sites during 2007. 
In particular, at Newlands (West Waterlooville) we obtained a resolution to grant planning for the
development of 100,000 sq. metres of commercial space and 1,550 new homes. In addition the
adopted Hampshire County Structure plan includes a reserve allocation for a further 1,000 units.
We are currently in the process of agreeing the Section 106 agreement and hope to start on
infrastructure work in the latter part of 2008. This is an exemplar scheme where we will be
directly involved in some of the construction and in the long-term management of the estate. 
We expect the ﬁrst house sales to commence in the ﬁnancial year ending 2009.
The current status of our other major projects is set out below:

Operating contribution from this business in the year (including trading proﬁts, proﬁts on sale of
ﬁxed assets and joint venture interests, net of divisional overheads) amounted to £4m (2006: £7m).

Gross annual running rent £15.0m £7.5m
We have made signiﬁcant advances in our European operation, in particular the opening of our
Mannheim asset and property management business, which now employs seven members of staff.
Whilst increasing interest costs have narrowed the spread between yields and funding costs we
remain optimistic for the prospects of our German residential business. This is based on our long-
term strategy which includes buying good quality assets with favourable tenant structures in areas
where residential demand is likely to remain high. The results of this have been reﬂected in the
valuation of our portfolio which shows an uplift of 4.0%. We focus on smaller value portfolios
(below €20m) and do not rely on overly aggressive privatisation rates to deliver the required 
level of returns. 
We continue to investigate alternative funding structures for our German business and, in particular,
the possibility of introducing third-party equity. 
The operating contribution from our German portfolio in the year was £5m, primarily from 
net rental yield on the properties which is running at 4.5% (2006: 5.0%). We have two further
European interests, one of which was sold in the year, delivering proﬁt of £1.2m on an original
investment of £2m. The other, a subsidiary company in which we own an 81.6% stake, holds a
development site in Zizkov, Prague and is going through the planning process. Our investment
amounts to £3.5m and the gross development value may amount to as much as £170m on 
phase I with a second phase of similar size to follow.
Prospects We have been building each of our businesses in a prudent way, without assuming 
the relatively high levels of house price growth that we have beneﬁted from in recent years.
However, we believe that we now have in place a market-leading platform that can acquire,
develop, fund, manage and sell a diverse range of residential products on a national basis. 
We are also conﬁdent that we can still produce good long-term returns from our specialist
portfolios which rely on active management, development and trading of reversionary surpluses
and will continue to concentrate our resources in these areas.

 6 Experian Annual Report 2008
Chief Executive’s review
Experian performed well during a challenging year. 
We delivered organic revenue growth across all four 
of our regions and all four of our principal activities, 
there were good profit and cash performances 
and we made excellent strategic progress, which 
positions us strongly for future growth. These 
achievements are all the more significant for having 
been secured against one of the most challenging 
market environments for the financial services 
sector in the US and the UK in recent times. Our 
performance attests to the commitment of our 
people, the strength of our market position, the 
global demand for our products and the balance  
and diversity of our portfolio.

Chief Executive Officer
Portfolio balance drives growth

noteworthy performances, 
including:

delivered strong growth in 
emerging markets and higher 
penetration of fraud prevention 
products.

activities, which have benefited 
from our commitment to new 
product innovation. 
Consumer Direct, which continues  l
to be a major success as we build 
on our global market-leading 
position. 
Our new media marketing activities,  l
which now account for nearly 50% of 
North America Marketing Services.
New contract wins from major  l
clients, including Barclays, IBM

Chief Executive’s review
Over the past year we have 
made significant progress to 
enable us to continue to drive 
profitable growth 
Managing our business in  
more challenging times
In January, we took action to ensure 
that we had the right cost structure 
in place for the prevailing business 
environment. We announced a 
programme of cost-efficiency 
measures, to deliver annualised 
savings of US$80m. In response to 
continuing challenging conditions, 
we have since identified additional 
opportunities and have raised 
our estimate for annualised cost 
savings to US$110m. We now 
expect in the region of US$50m to 
be realised in the year ending 31 
March 2009, with the full benefit 
thereafter. One-off restructuring 
costs associated with achieving 
these savings are now expected to 
be in the region of US$140m. 
These additional measures include 
further restructuring of core 
credit and marketing activities and 
infrastructure consolidation.
Evolving our strategy
At Experian, we are fortunate to have 
many opportunities to drive growth, 
underpinned by global expansion in 
demand for credit risk management 
and high RoI marketing. We have 
refined our strategic focus and have 
adopted a framework to:
Focus on data and analytics. l
Drive profitable growth. l
Optimise capital efficiency. l
We have incorporated these three 
elements in the recent execution of 
our strategy.
Focus on data and analytics
Our core expertise is ownership 
and operation of comprehensive 
databases around the world and 
enhancing the value of data through 
the application of proprietary 
analytics and software. Our 
businesses are characterised by 
their market-leading positions, 
high barriers to entry, global reach 
and potential for long-term growth, 
as well as their attractive financial 
characteristics.
We review the composition of our 
portfolio against these criteria 
on a regular basis. As previously 
announced, PriceGrabber and 
Experian’s transaction processing 
activities are under strategic review. 
We have also indicated previously 
that our acquisition strategy will 
focus on opportunities that will bring 
access to new data and analytics.
Drive profitable growth
Over the past year we have made 
significant progress to enable us to 
continue to drive profitable growth. 
We aim to achieve this through 
expansion of our global reach, a 
commitment to innovation and by 
driving operational excellence. 
Action in the year included:
The acquisition of a 70% stake in  l
Serasa, which provides access to 
the emerging credit economy in 
Brazil, with significant opportunity 
to introduce value-added products. 
Expansion of our infrastructure in  l
Asia Pacific, which has contributed 
to the success of our Decision 
Analytics activities in the region.
Further progress in new vertical  l
markets, with exciting new 
opportunities emerging in the UK 
public sector, for example.
Investment in new sources of data,  l
such as Visa transaction data, 
and the acquisition of Hitwise, 
which extends our position in new 
marketing channels.
Development of new products  l
in Consumer Direct for fraud 
prevention and identity protection.
Investment in new analytics  l
activities, for example through  
the acquisition of T allyman,  
which extends our presence in 
collections software.
Investment in low cost development  l
and delivery centres in Chile, India 
and Bulgaria.
In the year ending 31 March 2009, 
we plan to invest through the 
income statement at a rate similar 
to the prior year in new products, 
geographies and our people. 8 Experian Annual Report 2008
Optimise capital efficiency
We remain committed to 
maintaining an efficient balance 
sheet, consistent with a strong 
investment grade credit rating.  
We will be flexible where warranted, 
for example, following the debt-
financed acquisition of Serasa 
in June 2007 our credit ratios 
rose above our target levels. We 
considered this acceptable as a 
temporary position following a 
strategically important acquisition. 
Since then, net debt has reduced 
from US$3.0bn to US$2.7bn as a 
result of strong cash conversion. 
We will continue to reinvest to 
retain competitive advantage and to 
make targeted acquisitions that fit 
our strategy and meet our financial 
hurdles. We will review additional 
opportunities for returning surplus 
cash to shareholders, as credit ratios 
return to levels consistent with a 
strong investment grade credit rating.
Dividend 
For the year ended 31 March 2008, 
we have announced a second 
dividend of 12.0 US cents per share 
to give a full year dividend of 18.5 
US cents per share, in line with our 
objective to have cover (based on 
Benchmark EPS) of at least three 
times on an annual basis. The second 
interim dividend will be paid on  
25 July 2008 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 
27 June 2008.
Strengthening our  
management team
Our achievements are directly 
related to the quality and 
commitment of our people, and the 
strength of our senior leadership 
team. We have created two new 
senior leadership roles to ensure 
that we operate our business more 
globally, in every respect, to meet 
the growing needs of our clients.

Chief Executive’s review
Chris Callero, who has successfully 
led and expanded our North 
America and Latin America 
businesses, has been promoted 
to the role of President and Chief 
Operating Officer, Experian Group. 
Victor Nichols, who joined Experian 
a year ago from Wells Fargo, has 
become CEO for the combined 
UK and EMEA region.  Victor also 
retains accountability for Marketing 
Services and Interactive globally. 
Financial performance
Despite the market challenges, 
we delivered a good financial 
performance during the year:
We delivered organic revenue  l
growth of 4%.
W e delivered continuing EBIT margin  l
in line with the prior year at 21.8%.
EBIT conversion into operating  l
cash flow was 95%. 
We continued to invest in the 
business through the income 
statement, capital expenditure and 
acquisitions. Capital expenditure 
was US$344m, in line with previous 
guidance. Acquisition expenditure 
was US$1.7bn, including the 70% 
stake in Serasa, Hitwise, Tallyman, 
N4 Solutions and a number of 
smaller infills. Acquisitions in the 
year are currently trading at least 
to plan, and Serasa is on plan for 
revenue and exceeds EBIT buy plan. 
Summary
This has been a challenging year in 
many ways. The major disruption 
that took place in the financial 
services sector was unprecedented, 
impeding our revenue growth 
trajectory, but we delivered good 
profit and cash performances. 
Experian is a strong business 
performing well in difficult markets, 
and while it is still too early to call a 
turn in the US and the UK financial 
services markets, we have taken 
the necessary steps to reduce 
costs and protect margins. We also 
expect strong performances in 
the current year in other Experian 
regions and in key business lines. 
In the meantime, we will keep a tight 
rein on costs, while continuing 
to invest in the long-term growth 
of the business. Experian is a 
business with excellent future 
growth opportunities and we are 
highly confident about our future 
prospects.
Expanding Experian’s data assets with online 
competitive intelligence
In June 2007, Experian acquired Hitwise, a leading online 
competitive intelligence service, operating in the US, 
UK, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong.  
Hitwise enables over 1,400 clients to benchmark their online 
performance against competitors and, most importantly, to 
uncover new business opportunities by understanding how 
people interact daily with over one million websites across 160 
industries. 
Over the next 18 months, Hitwise will be expanding its global 
footprint into new markets and launching a range of new 
online competitive intelligence tools to continue to help clients 
maximise their online marketing spend.

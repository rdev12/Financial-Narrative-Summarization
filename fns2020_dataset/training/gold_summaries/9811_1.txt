CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW | CAREPRODUCTPEOPLE
Ralph Findlay with the operating
divisional managing directors.
Business structure and strategy
Our philosophy is straightforward: we 
aim to develop and operate good quality
community-based pubs and to market and
sell high quality ale brands.This market
positioning is deliberately mainstream,
focusing on venues and products with 
a broad consumer appeal.
Whether our pubs are managed, tenanted
or leased will depend upon their individual
characteristics, allowing us to take a 
pub-by-pub approach in deciding which is
the most suitable and profitable means of
operation. Pathfinder Pubs,The Union Pub
Company and WDB Brands are managed
independently, but within a corporate
structure that gives us flexibility in our
approach both to existing operations and
potential acquisitions and also reduces risk.
Such flexibility is particularly helpful in 
a period of rising regulatory and other
operating costs, for example enabling us to
reduce overheads and increase profit by
transferring 104 smaller managed pubs to
lease in September 2002.We have also
made savings in brewing and logistics through
restructuring and improved procurement.
This year we are again able to report good progress
towards our basic objectives: continuous
improvement in the quality of our pub and brands
businesses, increased margins and growing earnings
per share.At the same time, the increases in like-for-
like sales in Pathfinder Pubs and The Union Pub
Company were amongst the best in the industry. W&DB Annual Report 2003    7

piscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod.
Our community-based business has
intrinsic strengths.Whereas the high street
sector has suffered as a consequence of
low barriers to entry, over-investment and
lack of differentiation, community pubs
enjoy a degree of protection through
licensing and planning laws. On balance,
we believe that our relative competitive
position should be enhanced by
forthcoming licensing reform.
We have a long-held preference for
freehold pubs.The fact that 97% by value
of our estate is freehold or long leasehold
means that future capital appreciation 
will accrue to our shareholders and
minimise exposure to rent increases.
Investment in pubs, brands and people is
a vital part of our approach.This year,
capital expenditure was £47.9m, of which
£37.3m was invested in pubs.The high
returns we are achieving demonstrate that
there continue to be good opportunities
to create real value from our pub
investment programmes.
Our strategy is to use the strong cash
flow of the business to enhance returns.
We aim to do so by ensuring that our
existing pubs are well maintained and by
considering acquisition opportunities as
they arise.We also aim to maintain an
efficient balance sheet and to operate 
an ongoing share buy-back programme,
in addition to our progressive dividend
policy.
Trading environment
The steady increase in margins and
returns from our businesses has been
achieved against a background of
industry-wide rises in National Insurance
contributions, pension fund payments and
other employment costs, primarily as a
result of legislation. Looking forward, we
anticipate that the implementation of
licensing reform will require additional
expenditure of around £1m during 2004
to ensure that we, our tenants and
leaseholders are all prepared for the
changes.The burden placed on the industry
by legislation and regulation continues 
to increase. Our ability to make progress
and increase margins despite these
pressures provides evidence that the
business is strongly positioned and in
good health.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW | PATHFINDER PUBS | LOCATIONCOMMUNITYPERSONALITY
Pathfinder Pubs
Our managed pub business comprised 477
pubs at the year end, compared to 488
last year.Total like-for-like sales across the
entire estate increased by 3.6%, and by
0.1% on an un-invested basis.This strong
performance in a competitive market was
helped by good summer weather and pub
investment and is against comparatives which
include the benefit of the Golden Jubilee
and football World Cup in June 2002.
During the year, we refurbished 33 pubs 
in either the “Bostin’ Local” or “Service
That Suits Me” formats. Both these
operating styles are based upon a simple
proposition: well-sited pubs developed in
a contemporary format with a strong
emphasis on food and service.
We now have 86 “Bostin’ Locals”, with a
further 75 targeted over the next two
years as refurbishments from our existing
estate.These modern community pubs
offer top drinks brands and have a good,
straightforward food menu, all with a
value-for-money price platform.This offer,
combined with a programme of events
and promotions, has contributed to
average turnover doubling compared 
to the pre-investment period. Food sales
represent approximately 30% of turnover.
We have 20 “Service That Suits Me” pubs,
and will target a further 20 over the next
two years from our existing estate.
“Service That Suits Me” pubs have a higher
price platform and higher food sales,
representing 60% of turnover on average.
They are sited in more affluent areas and
are generally “drive-to” community outlets,
which give customers the option of ordering
at the bar or enjoying full table service.
Investment in these two formats averages
approximately £300,000, a significant
reduction from the £450,000 per pub being
invested at the start of the programme
three years ago.The cost of conversions is
continuing to fall as we learn more about
the specific elements of refurbishment
contributing to improved performance.
In addition to boosting turnover this
investment has generated an average cash
return comfortably in excess of 20% to date.
Pitcher & Piano, whose 28 sites represent
6% of our total managed estate, has
benefited from investment in new menus
and improvements in operating standards,
reflected in like-for-like food sales growth.
More recently, three sites are trading
successfully after a combined £1.2m
refurbishment programme, which will 
be extended to a further seven sites
during 2004.

Overall the division’s underlying operating
margin increased from 20.5% to 21.0%,
and return on capital from 12.6% to
12.8%.This was achieved through the
transfer of 104 smaller managed pubs to
lease in September 2002, the completion
of a £6m investment in electronic point of
sale (EPOS) systems in March 2003, the
negotiation of better buying terms, pricing,
and the increasing quality of our pubs.
Looking forward, the division faces
significant cost increases as a consequence
of the Government’s decision to increase
the national minimum wage by 7.1% to
£4.50 per hour from 1 October 2003.
We aim to offset this increase through
continued development of the estate,
by maximising the benefits from our
investment in EPOS and by continuing to
improve productivity.We will also benefit
from our decision to improve the choice
of top brand lagers sold in our pubs, as a
consequence of which Heineken and
Harp Irish Lager have been replaced by
either Foster’s or Carlsberg.
In addition to pub refurbishment, we are
acquiring new sites for development as
“Bostin’ Locals” or “Service That Suits Me”.
This offers the opportunity to extend our
existing geographical boundaries through
the roll-out of our proven formats and we
currently have sites under, or earmarked
for, development both within our existing
trading area and in Kent and East Anglia.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW | THE UNION PUB COMPANY | INDEPENDENCECHARACTERAPPEAL

The Union Pub Company
The tenanted and leased pub division
comprised 1,131 pubs at the year end,
compared to 1,142 last year.
Like-for-like turnover increased by 2.7%.
This growth was achieved with the benefit
of good summer weather, but also reflects
the success of our drive to extend 21-year
Open House leases across the business.
The Open House lease has been signed
by 350 licensees attracted by the security
of tenure and the high discounts offered. W&DB Annual Report 2003    11

Underlying operating margins were 1.5%
lower than last year at 42.3%, as a result
of the one-off operational costs arising 
in 2003 from transferring 104 smaller
managed pubs to lease in September 2002.
Return on capital was maintained at 14.2%.
The pub market is polarising as a result 
of evolving consumer tastes, demographic
changes and the over-supply of pubs in
the market.These changes are felt most
keenly in weaker pubs and so we have
sought to focus on improving the quality
of our estate. Over the last four years 
we have sold 700 tenanted pubs and
integrated 500 managed house transfers.
We invested £12.2m last year in
refurbishments undertaken jointly with
tenants and lessees and aim to maintain
that investment this year. As a
consequence, we have a high quality,
freehold estate with sustainable income.
The Union Pub Company prides itself on
taking the initiative to improve business
for tenants, lessees and the Group.
A recent survey highlighted the positive
impact of some of the things we do
differently, including our pioneering “Plain
English” approach to tenant and lease
agreements.The discounts available to
tenants are amongst the highest in the
industry and we were the first to
introduce a rent panel to ensure that 
the rent setting process is fair and
transparent.This year we introduced 
a new package of “Skill Pool” training
support for tenants and lessees,
developed to ensure that they are fully
equipped with the necessary expertise 
to succeed in the pub business.
The relationship between licensees and
Business Development Managers is
becoming more constructive, with
licensees rightly expecting more advice
about how to grow their trade. A “£10k
challenge” initiative, which involved our
managers analysing individual pubs in
detail to target increased profit for the
licensee, has produced dividends. Another
example is the introduction of a facility 
to take advantage of Group buying terms
for a wide range of products and services
which has enabled licensees to reduce
significantly their purchasing costs, in 
some cases by thousands of pounds.
In this new financial year,The Union Pub
Company has indicated its intention to
provide financial support to enable
tenants to prepare for implementation of
the new licensing regime in early 2005.
We will also provide advice to help
licensees through the process and
maximise opportunities that the reform
may provide to them individually.
The Union Pub Company aims to grow
through the extension of the Open House
lease to around 50% of pubs in the current
estate, selective investment in partnership
with tenants and lessees and the acquisition
of pubs either singly or in packages. 12 W&DB Annual Report 2003

WDB Brands
Our strategy has been to reduce the
amount of capital employed in WDB
Brands and focus on a sustainable, quality
business with a high return on capital.
This strategy has been successful, with
underlying operating margin up 0.5% to
17.4% and return on capital increasing 
to 25.5% from 22.7% last year.
The re-focusing of this business on high
quality ale brands is now complete.
The task now is to grow the business
profitably and to build on the strong
market positions held by Marston’s
Pedigree, Banks’s and Mansfield.
There is a market opportunity for dedicated
brewers of high quality ales. Although the
beer market is mature and has been in
overall decline at a rate of 2% to 3% per
annum for many years, industry consolidation
offers opportunities to target real growth.
There is also greater scope to compete
for supply to the “pubco” sector of the
market, historically tied to parent brewers.
The keys to achieving that growth are
brand development, innovation, customer
relationships and service.
This year, we strengthened our beer
portfolio with the introduction of Marston’s
Old Empire, a 5.7% abv classic India Pale
Ale (IPA).We introduced a new marketing
campaign for Marston’s Pedigree based
around our “Uncompromising” and “Zero
T olerance” approach to the quality of the
brand.The Pedigree campaign, together
with the launch of keg Pedigree last year,
helped to increase market share from
8.5% to 10.3% in the on-trade. In the
latest quarter, the market share of
Pedigree overtook Bass in the on-trade 
to become the number two premium 
ale in the country.We are in the process
of reinforcing the Banks’s brand with new
fonts and pump clip designs to provide 
a more contemporary image.
This coming year, we plan to make 
a £2m investment in the brewhouse and
refrigeration plant at the Burton brewery,
which will help to increase operating
efficiency further.We have already
strengthened the management team with
key appointments in sales, marketing and
finance and believe that WDB Brands is
well positioned to benefit from future
opportunities in the beer market. W&DB Annual Report 2003    13

Prospects
We have had a good start to the new
financial year. In the eight weeks to 
22 November 2003 total like-for-like sales
in The Union Pub Company increased 
by 5.0% and across the entire Pathfinder
Pubs managed estate were 3.1% ahead 
of last year for the same period. Despite
the cost pressures on our industry, we 
aim to maintain the improved margins 
we achieved last year through further
investment in our pubs and beer brands,
and through increased efficiencies.
Our structure, community focus and largely
freehold estate all clearly differentiate us
from many of our competitors. Having
established a strong position in our core
businesses, we now aim to invest more in
new pubs, sites and refurbishments that 
fit our business model. Our objective is 
to continue to improve the quality of our
pubs and brands and our return on capital,
thereby delivering value for shareholders.

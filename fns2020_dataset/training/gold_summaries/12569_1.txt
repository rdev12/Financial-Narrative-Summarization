Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Specific principal risks identified by management are described below together with management actions to minimise these risks:
Key Performance Indicators (“KPI”)
Risk and Impact Management Strategy KPI’s
Market and Customer Concentration
The Group’s largest subsidiary, CSC, has its revenue concentrated on 
the deep water oil and gas sector. Changes in activity in this market, 
therefore, have a significant impact on Group results. Additionally, the 
number of customers in this market is low and loss of market share 
would have a significant impact on Group results.
Contract Delay
CSC earns a significant amount of its revenues from large contracts in 
the deepwater oil and gas and defence markets and CBG is a start-up 
business in the Biogas to Grid market. In most cases, individual 
contracts in these two divisions are material to Group revenues and 
the timing of such contracts is influenced by a number of factors 
outside the control of the Group.
Supplier Concentration
The Group derives a high proportion of its raw material supplies from 
a small number of key suppliers, some of whom are competitors.
Production Concentration
Each product group operates from a single manufacturing site.  
In the event of a prolonged interruption to operations, the Group  
may not have the ability to transfer its manufacturing activities to 
other facilities.
Equipment Concentration 
The Group has a number of large pieces of equipment at CSC for 
which it would be uneconomical to duplicate that equipment to 
guarantee continuity of supply in the case of major equipment failure. 
A failure in one of these key pieces of equipment could lead to a 
prolonged interruption to operations.
Staff Concentration
The Group is small and relies on a small number of key Directors, 
senior managers and specialists. A loss of a small number of such staff 
could have a major impact on Group revenues and development.
Banking Sector Risk
The Group holds significant bank balances and instability in  
the banking sector puts these funds at risk if a bank holding our 
deposits fails.
Foreign Currency
The Group purchases some of its raw materials in both US Dollars 
and Euros and receives payment for some of its products in Euros. 
Movements in exchange rates could potentially impact Group 
revenues.
Development of Markets, Products and Services
The Group has a three-fold strategy to reduce its exposure to this 
market. First, significant management resource is allocated to service 
the requirements of customers in this market to maintain customer 
loyalty. Second, CSC has development programmes for new products 
and services to dilute the proportion of total revenues into this market. 
Third, growing the other divisions of the Group both organically and  
by acquisition. 
Focused Project Management
Major contracts are managed through project teams to ensure all 
elements in the contract quotation and negotiation process that are 
under our control or influence are managed efficiently and effectively. 
However, the impact of the timing of contracts on half-year and  
full-year revenue remains a significant risk to the Group
Managing and Developing the Suppliers
To reduce the inherent risk of supply from competitors, requirements 
are split across the available supplier base. A constant review is 
maintained to identify alternative suppliers subject to constraints  
on pricing and quality.
Active Site Management
Health, safety and environmental risks which could result in site  
closure are managed on a day to day basis by a designated manager  
at each site. 
Active Equipment Management
Key pieces of equipment are subject to on-going maintenance 
programmes and strategic spares for critical components are held.  
There remains a risk that, if a major component for which spares cannot 
be held failed, operations could still see a prolonged interruption.
Succession Planning
As the business grows, increases in staff numbers make succession 
planning easier and recruitment is already carried out to ensure  
that skills and expertise can be duplicated.
Key man insurance is in place for the Group Chief Executive and  
Group Finance Director.
Use of Multiple Banks
The Group splits its cash deposits between three banks so that the 
failure of a single bank will not result in the loss of the total cash 
resources of the Group.
 
Hedging of Exchange Rate Exposures
The Group has natural hedges for much of its foreign currency exposure. 
Regular reviews of the net exposure are maintained and where it is 
deemed necessary the exposure is reduced by the use of forward 
exchange contracts subject to limits in the Group’s banking facility.
Summary and Calculation of KPI’s
The Board uses key performance indicators when assessing the 
performance of the Group. These KPI’s are divided into three sections. 
Shareholders 
Earnings per share is used as a measure of shareholder return. Earnings 
per share are calculated as profit for the period divided by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue.
Financial Performance 
Growth is measured in terms of sales revenue. The Group has a medium 
term target of achieving sales revenues of £40 million and each division 
has growth targets. The Group aims to progress towards the target 
of £40 million revenue through a combination of internal growth and 
acquisitions.
The efficiency of converting sales into profits is measured in terms 
of return on revenue. Return on revenue is calculated as operating 
profit divided by revenue and is stated after excluding CBG which is 
still considered to be in start-up mode (see note 1 for the detailed 
segmental analysis). The Group target return on revenue is 20%.
Corporate Social Responsibility 
This is sub-divided into two areas.
Health & Safety 
The measure used is reportable accidents where the target is Zero 
across the Group. 
Environment 
The measure used is number of reportable environmental incidents. 
Again, the target is Zero across the Group.
A full-time health, safety and environmental manager is employed 
by Chesterfield BioGas but has responsibility for these matters across 
the Group and reports directly to the Group Chief Executive on these 
matters.
Graphs of progress for each KPI are shown to the right.Environmental 
incidents are not graphed as there has been no reportable incident for 
the five year period. Comparative performance for 2011 and 2010 is:
  2011 2010
  £m £m
Shareholders Earnings per share 3.5p 22.3p
Financial  Sales revenue £23.1m £21.7m
performance Return on revenue 5.0% 18.1%
CSR   Reportable accidents Zero Zero
        Environmental incidents Zero Zero
Key issues are that revenues are recovering through growth acquisitions 
in the Engineered Products division which have compensated for a 
further revenue fall at CSC. The high level of fixed costs at CSC and the 
carrying costs of the Chesterfield BioGas start-up have depressed Group 
profits with a consequent effect on EPS. Actions to improve profitability 
are discussed in the Chief Executive’s statement on pages 10 to 15.

Directors’ report continued
Donations
Donations made by the Group during the period for charitable purposes in the United Kingdom amounted to £3,120 (2010: £3,000).
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to comply wherever practical with the terms of payment agreed with its suppliers. The average creditor days were 43 (2010: 47) for the Group. 
The Company has no significant trade payables.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company maintains director and officer insurance cover for the benefit of its Directors which remained in force at the date of this report.
Employee involvement
It is the policy of the Group to communicate with employees by regular briefing meetings conducted by senior management. Career development is encouraged 
through suitable training and annual appraisals. The Group takes the approach of maximising performance through the heightening of awareness of corporate 
objectives and policies. 
Disabled persons
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons, where they have the necessary abilities and skills for that position, 
and, wherever possible, will retrain employees who become disabled so that they can continue their employment in another position. The Group engage, promote, 
and train staff on the basis of their capabilities, qualifications and experience, without discrimination, giving all employees an equal opportunity to progress.
Going concern
Management has produced forecasts for all business units which have been reviewed by the Directors. These demonstrate the Group is forecast to generate profits 
and cash in 2011/2012 and beyond and that the Group has sufficient cash reserves to enable the Group to meet its obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 
12 months from when these financial statements have been signed.
As such, the Directors are satisfied that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future. For this reason they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements.
Post balance sheet events
There are no post balance sheet events to note.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group’s financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs). Under company law, the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Group for that period. The 
Directors have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements;
• for the parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
In so far as each of the Directors is aware: 
• there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
Auditors
Grant Thornton UK LLP are willing to continue in office and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Cautionary statement on forward-looking statements and related information
The annual report contains a number of forward-looking statements relating to the Group. The Group considers any statements that are not historical facts 
as “forward-looking statements”. They relate to events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results and financial 
position of the Group to differ materially from the information presented. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking 
statements which are relevant only as at the date of this document.

 4 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
For the year ended 31 October 2009
However, the Group increased recurring 
revenues strongly and at the end of 
the year the level of contracts awaiting 
delivery was 60% up on a like for like basis.
IDOX’s operational capability was 
stretched in the first half of the year when 
it delivered on schedule an ePlanning 
Solution for the Scottish Government 
that linked its 16 Unitary Authorities.  
The experience gained from this and the 
follow-up review of internal processes 
has already delivered improvements 
in the Group’s operating procedures 
that will lead to more efficient project 
management and better managed 
services. 
In product development, IDOX achieved 
several goals. It completed product road 
maps for its core business lines, introduced 
and enhanced computerised production 
systems using in-house Enterprise product 
technology, introduced quality initiatives 
across the company, achieved cost savings 
and successfully delivered important new 
products on time and to a higher quality 
standard.  Developments planned for 2010 
The core Software division had a good 
year, winning notable large contracts 
including the Scottish Government’s 
Stream 3 ePlanning procurement and all 
of the new Unitary Authorities created 
by the Local Government Review who 
have tendered for work in 2009, namely 
Cornwall, Shropshire, and Central 
Bedfordshire.  Helped by the launch of 
new public-access modules, Enterprise 
modules, and updates to existing 
products, IDOX increased market share 
in its core segments through competitor 
replacements in Medway, North Norfolk, 
North Kesteven and expanded its presence 
in other authorities such as Eastleigh, 
where it implemented a corporate-wide 
EDRMS solution.
The timing and mix of orders was different 
than expected, with a larger element 
coming from managed-service contracts 
spread over a number of years.  This shift, 
combined with new product releases and 
the additional requirement to hit the 
deployment timetable for Scotland Stream 
2, a complex rollout across Scotland with 
customer and third-party dependencies, 
resulted in deliveries and associated 
revenue recognition falling short of 
expectations.

Bidtrack product, generated advertising 
revenues, added new technology with its 
Content Management System, added web 
publishing expertise and strengthened the 
IDOX management team.
The Group’s Recruitment business has 
suffered through layoffs and downsizing 
in all of its markets. Contract interim 
placements held up well, but there was a 
52% fall in permanent recruitment which, 
although accounting for just 1% of Group 
revenues, had a 5% impact on Group 
operating profits.  The integration of the 
team from Intelligent Resources towards 
the end of the year, has strengthened 
the Group’s position and the outlook for 
recruitment in 2010 has already started to 
improve.

The Board is confident of a good 
performance in 2010.  Although the 
Government has reiterated its commitment 
to maintain core funding at previously 
agreed levels though until 2011, local 
authorities will face growing pressure to 
improve services and reduce costs.
are designed to position IDOX as the most 
efficient and focused supplier of quality 
solutions and managed services to Local 
Government.
Demand for the Solutions business, which 
accounts for 10% of Group revenues, 
suffered from the economic downturn 
with key private and public sector projects 
being delayed or postponed indefinitely.  
The acquisition of j4b offset this to some 
extent with the completion of a major 
contract for the charities sector after 
its integration.  j4b has also augmented

recurring revenues 
strongly and at the 
end of the year the 
level of contracts 
awaiting delivery was 
60% up on a like for 
like basis. 6 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

The Board expects that in the face of such 
economic pressures, local authorities will 
increasingly appreciate the rapid return 
on investment and benefits of service 
improvements that IDOX software and 
services provide at relatively little cost.
The effort IDOX invested in product 
development during the 2009 financial 
year should generate good returns 
in 2010, with existing and potential 
customers benefiting from a wider range 
of software modules, upgrades and 
enhanced offerings from the consultancy, 
recruitment and managed-services 
businesses.
The 2010 financial year has begun 
positively.  IDOX is delivering on its 
substantial contracted order book, 
converting its large pipeline of prospects 
into sales and seeing signs of recovery in 
the Solutions and Permanent Recruitment 
businesses.

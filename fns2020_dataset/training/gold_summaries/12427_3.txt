 Strategic report
Chairman’s statement
Introduction
I am pleased to report that Porvair continues
to make progress against its financial and
strategic objectives.
Results
Revenues in the year to 30 November 2013
were £84.3 million (2012: £76.5 million) and
profit before tax rose by 25% to £7.8 million
(2012: £6.3 million). These are record results
for the Group. Basic earnings per share were 
12.7 pence (2012: 10.1 pence), an increase 
of 26%.
Cash generated from operations was 
£12.3 million (2012: £9.2 million). After interest
and tax, net cash generated from operating
activities was £9.7 million (2012: £7.4 million).
At 30 November 2013 the Group was net
cash positive for the first time with net cash 
on hand of £0.6 million (2012: net debt 
of £3.9 million).
Dividends
The Directors recommend an improved 
final dividend of 1.8 pence per share 
(2012: 1.6 pence), making the full year
dividend 2.9 pence per share (2012: 
2.6 pence), an increase of 12%.
Board composition
Michael Gatenby retired from the Board 
at the 2013 AGM in April. Andrew Walker 
will retire at the 2014 AGM, having been a 
director for nine years. They have both made 
a substantial contribution to the Group’s
direction and strategy during their time on the
Board. We thank them and wish them well.
Following the 2013 AGM, Andrew Walker
succeeded Michael Gatenby as senior Non-
Executive Director and Paul Dean succeeded
him as Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Paul Dean will succeed Andrew Walker as
senior Non-Executive Director following the
2014 AGM.
Governance
The Board sets high standards for its
corporate governance and has in place
monitoring systems to ensure that those
standards are upheld throughout the Group.
The Board complied with all aspects of the 
UK Corporate Governance code throughout
the year ended 30 November 2013 with the
exception of fixed terms of employment for
Non-Executive Directors, however all of the
Directors offer themselves for re-election 
at each AGM. 
New formats have been adopted for our
Strategic and Remuneration Reports, as
required by latest governance guidelines. 
For the first time at the 2014 AGM, shareholders
will have the opportunity to approve the
Group’s remuneration policies as well as 
the Remuneration Report.
Staff
Looking back over the last five or six years, it is
remarkable how much has changed at Porvair.
In sales terms we are almost double the size
we were in 2007, a significant achievement by
our staff. This year we have been joined by
employees of Eisenmann Metallurgical and
Thomas Cain, and we are pleased to welcome
them to the Group. The Board is most grateful
to all Porvair’s staff for their hard work and
commitment.
Current trading and outlook
Porvair’s strategic direction remains consistent
and continues to produce good results. 
2013 finished well and order books are
healthy. The fundamentals of the markets in
which we operate look satisfactory. The larger
contracts announced during the year are
progressing well and are expected to have 
a positive impact on the Group, with their
accounting implications outlined on page 7.
The Board expects that provided economic
conditions allow, the underlying business will
continue to grow. The Group expects to invest
in additional manufacturing capacity in 2014 
in the UK, USA and China to meet growing
demand, and notes that the Group’s new
product pipeline is promising. A positive start
has been made to 2014.

The industry has faced a 
challenging couple of years 
due to the fall in oil price. 
However , a modest recovery 
has seen renewed interest in 
growth opportunities. With 
our Darwin project having  
a break-even oil price of $40 
per barrel, we are optimistic 
that we can attract partners 
to help with its appraisal  
and development

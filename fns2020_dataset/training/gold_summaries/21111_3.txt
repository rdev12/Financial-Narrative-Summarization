Chairman’s Statement 
for the year ended 31 December 2016 
 
 
I am delighted to report continued strong progress for ATTRAQT in 2016 with sustained sales momentum. The 
Group signed 42 deals in the period, including 31 new clients, and increased the average new client deal value to 
£32.3k per annum.  
 
The financial results for FY 2016 are very encouraging with the Group delivering revenue growth of 22 percent to 
£3.6m, which includes a 22 percent increase in recurring revenue to £3.2m. The business showed good control of 
costs during the period to deliver an EBITDA loss of £1.6m, in line with expectations and reflecting the accelerated 
investment in the business. Gross margins increased to 86.2 percent. 
 
Expansion in the North America market progressing well, as demonstrated by the signing of seven new clients, 
including Eddie Bauer and Volcom. 
 
The Group continues to invest and develop its core software platform, specifically upgrading the Freestyle 
Merchandising platform which saw seven new core code releases during the period. On a backdrop of continued 
solid growth and exciting times for ATTRAQT, the Board looks forward to the future with confidence.

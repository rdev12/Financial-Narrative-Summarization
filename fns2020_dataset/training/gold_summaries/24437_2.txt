Strategic progress
In 2015 Greggs made further progress in executing the 
strategic plan outlined in 2013, which focused the business 
on the growing food-on-the-go market. This is bringing 
about significant changes to the quality and relevance of  
our product offer as well as the positioning and condition  
of the Greggs shop estate. 
We are also two years into a significant change programme, 
with ongoing investment in processes and systems, 
delivering benefits in terms of efficiency and greater agility, 
both essential in such a competitive marketplace. The result 
has been another excellent financial performance, founded 
on strong like-for-like sales growth and leveraging the 
vertical integration of the Greggs business model.

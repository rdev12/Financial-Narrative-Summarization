2010 marked the first year following 
the completion of the major 
restructuring programme we have 
been driving since 2006. The steady 
recovery in our financial 
performance demonstrates the 
success of our focus on building 
competitive assets, increasing 
efficiencies and identifying and 
targeting more attractive and higher 
margin markets and customers.
The most important objective for the 
year was to continue building on the 
growth in underlying operating 
margin seen during 2007-09. The 
5.9% achieved in the first half was 
followed by 6.6% in the strong 
second half reflecting our efforts to 
improve pricing, reduce costs and 
most importantly in the longer-
term, launch attractive and 
differentiated new products at 
improved margins.
Financial Performance 
Following the sales declines seen 
in recent years as a result of 
significant restructuring and 
economic recession in many 
markets, 2010 saw a return to like-
for-like growth. l ike-for-like 
volumes grew by 4% over the year, 
2% in hygiene and 6% in industrial. 
Benefiting from continuing 
improvement in mix as well as the 
increase in average raw material 
prices, which feeds through to 
sales with a lag of around 3 
months, reported like-for-like 
sales grew by 10% to £463.2 
million at constant currency. 2010 
full year underlying operating 
profits from continuing operations 
before restructuring costs and 
non-recurring items at £29.0 
million represent strong growth 
overall (25.5%) from £23.1 million 
in 2009.
profit before tax of £7.1 million 
(2009: loss of £6.1 million) reflects 
both the improved underlying 
performance as well as the much 
reduced restructuring charges and 
other non-recurring items of £6.5 
million (2009: £17.2 million) 
associated with ongoing efforts to 
improve productivity.
We saw further volatility in polymer 
prices during 2010, with steady 
increases during the first half in both 
North america and Europe, though 
prices reversed towards the end of 
the first half in North america and 
then remained fairly stable there to 
the year-end. in Europe by contrast, 
due to an apparent shortage of  
supply occasioned by an unreliable 
supply base, prices remained high 
throughout the year. We succeeded 
in designing a hedging programme 
that effectively mitigated a  
significant proportion of this volatility 
throughout the year, with hedges 
equivalent to the majority of the 
polypropylene demand of the 
European industrial division.  
We have significantly less hedging 
for polypropylene in place than at 
this stage in 2010, as attractive 
hedge pricing has not been  
available.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
S4 line, Berlin
The upgrade of the spunbond line at 
Fiberweb’s industrial manufacturing site 
in Berlin was successfully completed in 
May 2010.
Boddingtons
In December 2010, Fiberweb agreed to acquire 
the Boddingtons group of companies, a leading 
UK based specialist geosynthetic and accessory 
manufacturer .
Operating cash flow of £44.6 million 
(2009: £59.3 million) before non-
recurring cash costs of £6.9 million 
(2009: £8.7 million) nearly funded 
capital investment of £33.2 million 
(2009: £27.0 million), net interest 
payments of £7.9 million (2009: £9.3 
million) and shareholder dividends 
of £5.2 million (2009: £5.1 million). 
The heavy investment programme 
plus substantial refinancing fees on 
the renewal of the group’s primary 
debt facility led to net debt 
increasing by £14.6 million to £151.2 
million. despite tight control of 
working capital as a percentage of 
sales, sales growth and the increase 
in raw material prices and hence 
sales prices conspired to produce a 
working capital outflow of £4.3 
million (2009: £15.3 million inflow). 
Working capital as a percentage of 
sales, a metric management 
believes is crucial to the business, 
improved to 14.6% (2009: 15.4%), 
reflecting tight controls and 
management focus.
Divisional Review
The divisional structure was  
further simplified at the end of the 
year with the asian business being 
integrated into other divisions. 
Notably, the airlaid business,  
which predominantly serves 
multinational hygiene customers, 
was integrated into the existing 
global Consumer Fabrics business 
and the small asian industrial 
business was integrated into the 
americas industrial business.  
This further reduced cost and is 
consistent with our philosophy of 
matching our organisation to the 
needs and structures of our 
customers. Following the  
year-end, the successful 
completion of the Boddingtons 
acquisition allowed the creation 
of a business unit within the 
industrial division focused 
exclusively on the particular needs 
of customers for geosynthetics  
and related ground engineering 
products.
Industrial
The industrial division has 
performed strongly in the year 
despite continued tough market 
conditions with good performance in 
a number of markets and volumes 
improved by 6.3% overall. We have 
been able to continue to improve 
margins and launch new products 
such as roofwrap in the US although 
some launches were slower than 
expected. 
Europe industrial sales increased 
4.5% to £83.2 million. The European 
business benefited from the 
successful upgrade of a large 
industrial spunbond line in Berlin 
at the half year which ran at full 
utilisation in the second half. The 
strong performance of the  
facemask business in Europe in 
2009 was not repeated as fears 
of a swine flu epidemic failed 
to materialise. Roofing markets 
remain depressed in general. 
Our Terram geotextiles business      Fiberweb PLC  aNNUal REpORT aNd FiNaNCial STaTEmENTS 2010    11
was impacted by the reduction in 
European demand as a result of 
the recession and decline in public 
sector construction spending. 
despite this, Terram performed well 
to gain market share in the UK with 
volumes improving 4.5%.
americas industrial sales grew 3.8% 
to £85.9 million. The main weaknesses 
were in construction due to the 
continuing weak market, and in 
graphic arts, driven by consolidation of 
printers in the USa and weak printing 
volumes. This was offset by improved 
margins as a result of sales of higher 
margin filtration and technical 
nonwoven products. 
The project to relocate an industrial  
spunbond line in China experienced 
delays and the site remains under 
review.
Hygiene
Hygiene volumes were up 1.9% on 
a like–for-like basis after adjusting 
for the mexico and Washougal 
businesses contributed to the 
FitesaFiberweb joint venture during 
2009. Spunbond volumes were 
strong throughout the year both at 
Fiberweb’s plants in Europe and at 
the FitesaFiberweb businesses in 
the USa, mexico and Brazil. There 
was more volatility in the speciality 
carded business. in the US, sales 
grew by 4.9% on a like-for-like 
basis despite a small reduction in 
volumes reflecting the impact of 
higher raw material prices.  
in Europe, volumes grew by 1%.
The focus in Hygiene is on 
optimising business performance 
and operational improvement.  
a number of pricing initiatives have 
taken place and the business has 
also secured a number of long  
term contracts with major 
customers.
margins were impacted by steadily 
increasing raw material prices 
in the first half and the delayed 
effect of the average three month 
lag in contractual pass through 
arrangements with our customers. 
airlaid volumes in asia, despite 
growth of 15.5%, were volatile and 
progress in filling line 2 is slower 
than expected. 
The new FitesaFiberweb spunbond 
line at Simpsonville has progressed 
well and is now operational.
Our People
i continue to be pleased by the 
loyalty and determination shown by 
Fiberweb people around the globe. 
We benefited again during 2010 
from targeted recruitment in  
several important areas, notably in 
technical and marketing functions in 
both our industrial and hygiene 
businesses. We have also launched 
a major management development 
programme – Fiberweb xl – to 
ensure that we both retain our  
most talented staff and prepare 
them for new and greater 
challenges within Fiberweb as their 
careers develop.
Airlaid
Fiberweb is the largest airlaid roll goods 
producer in Asia serving most of the feminine 
care producers in the region. 12   Fiberweb PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2010 
I would like to thank all Fiberweb 
employees for their commitment 
and creativity as we begin to grow 
our businesses again and invest in 
challenging projects and initiatives.
Outlook
We expect Fiberweb’s performance 
to be resilient and in-line with 
market expectations, despite the 
continuing challenges of the 
economic environment and high 
levels of volatility in raw materials 
pricing. 
The Hygiene businesses are 
expected to see fairly stable end-
user demand and should benefit 
from new customer contracts. In 
particular, optimised loading and 
efficiencies on the Italian spunbond 
line commissioned in mid-2009 will 
benefit margins. Further overhead 
cost reductions in Europe are also 
underway and there is a renewed 
focus on operational excellence. 
FitesaFiberweb is expected to 
continue to profit from strong 
volumes in South America and from 
the first-time contribution from its 
new spunbond line in the USA.
The Industrial businesses will 
benefit from growth of sales of 
new products launched in 2010 
as well as from rationalisation in 
the UK following the acquisition 
of Boddingtons in January 2011. 
We will continue to examine our 
cost base and expect further 
improvements during the course of 
the year in manufacturing, as we 
continue to invest in product and 
market development.
Further debt reduction remains a 
priority, though capital expenditure 
is expected to remain at the 
elevated level of 2010. Fiberweb is 
in negotiations to conclude a sale 
and leaseback of the steam and 
chilled water plant commissioned 
in Old Hickory during 2010. It is 
anticipated that the sale price will 
be approximately £15 million. The 
medium-term target of net debt at 
2x EBITDA remains in place, and 
we will strive to make progress 
in this direction while continuing 
the necessary programme of 
investment to improve Fiberweb’s 
competitiveness further.

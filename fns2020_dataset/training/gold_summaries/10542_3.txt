Introduction
I am pleased to report that the Group has
made good progress over the past year. All of
the Group’s businesses are trading profitably
and are generating corresponding levels of
cash. These results do not include any
exceptional items and the Board remains
confident that historic contract exposures are
fully provided for – evidence that the Group is
in good health.
Further and stronger focus on particular areas
of specialism where the Group has strong
skills and experience continues to enhance
the quality and visibility of earnings flow. 
This is highlighted in more detail in the Chief
Executive’s report that follows. The Board
remains committed to improving the Group’s
health and safety performance and is pleased
to note the progress made during the year. 
Results and dividend
Group turnover from ongoing operations for
the year ended 30 September 2006 was
£341.7m (2005: £330.1m) and profit before
tax was £4.6m (2005: £1.2m). Earnings per
share were 10.00p (2005: 3.46p). The
Group’s net cash balance, exclusive of a
specific development loan of £9.8m, at 
30 September was £19.4m (2005: £13.6m).
Net assets have increased to £5.3m from
£4.8m after the impact of incorporating a
£2.8m net pension scheme deficit.
The Board is declaring a final dividend of 
0.8p per share, which will be paid on 
26 February 2007 to shareholders on the
register as at 26 January 2007. This will 
result in a dividend of 1.2p per share for the
full year (2005: 0.2p), reflecting the Group’s
progressive dividend policy and the Board’s
confidence in the Group’s future performance. 
Acquisition
During the year the Group acquired PPS
Electrical Limited, an electrical contractor
specialising in asset support for the nuclear
sector, for £664,000 in cash. PPS has been
successfully integrated into Shepley Engineers
and is trading in line with expectations. 
Pension scheme
In line with many other UK companies, the
Directors, in calculating the Group’s pension
position, have adopted mortality tables which
now reflect the expectation of a longer
lifespan for pension fund members. As a
result, the Directors have recognised a
pension deficit of £2.8m on the Group
balance sheet, net of deferred tax, compared
to a surplus of £1.6m at 30 September 2005. 
Board changes
On 1 May 2006, John Samuel FCA joined the
Board as Group Finance Director and Philip
Underwood stepped down from the Board to
concentrate on running VHE Construction and
Shepley Engineers. On 1 October 2006, 
John Bishop FCA joined as non-executive
Director. John Bishop has extensive
experience in the construction industry and
over 20 years PLC experience at main board
level. On 31 October 2006, Arnold Wagner
OBE stepped down from the Board to
concentrate on his executive responsibilities 
at Smiths Group plc. 
Outlook 
The positive actions taken by the new
management team augur well for the future,
and the Board is confident of making further
progress in both profitability and cash
generation in the new financial year.

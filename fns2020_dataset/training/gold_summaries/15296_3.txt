 2 Systems Union Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004
Chairman’s Statement
Review
The enlarged Group has significantly
increased its modus operandi from the
original business model with revenue
of £0.6 million in 1999 to £104.2 million
in 2004. This corporate growth is the
direct result of the change in senior
management in 2000 and the transition
away from the original business model
that was listed on the Alternative
Investment Market of the London Stock
Exchange in December 1999. The
subsequent growth and considerable
improvement to both cash generation
and profitability has been achieved by
strategic acquisition and a clear focus
on all operations.
Today we are the proud owners and
operators of some of the best branded
products on the global stage with a
very powerful business in financial and
performance management. We can now
sell, distribute and implement high quality
software solutions in three prime activities
of financial management, reporting and
performance management that can be used
on a stand alone basis, or in conjunction
with other software applications.
Following three years of consolidation
of our financial management businesses
and our entry in December 2003 to
the business analysis and performance
management software markets with the
purchase of MIS AG, we entered 2004
with optimism. The Group further
strengthened its intellectual property
portfolio with the acquisition of Lasata
Software and ncSoft during the year,
which added dynamic reporting and
analysis, together with a range of
business management solutions.
The combination of these businesses and
the adoption of our open environment
are of considerable future value. The
benefits of the wider business focus
of the Group are already apparent and
will continue to benefit all stakeholders
as the synergies within the product
brands in the Systems Union portfolio
are promoted and realised. Spending
on a cohesive research and development
agenda and global support infrastructure
continues to underline the importance
the Company places on maintaining its
position as the leading global vendor of
Financial and Performance Management
solutions in its chosen market place.
Results
The Group has continued to grow and
improve its operations and profitability
by acquisition and by investing in its
existing businesses. 
Group revenues grew by 33 per cent
from £78.4 million in 2003 to £104.2
million in 2004. Earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortisation of
intangibles for ongoing activities grew
by 37 per cent to £14.2 million from
£10.4 million. 
Adjusted earnings (as defined in the notes
to the financial statements) increased
by 23 per cent to £11.1 million from
£9.0 million in 2003. Similarly adjusted
earnings per share increased by 18 per
cent to 11.0p compared to 9.3p in 2003.
Dividend
As a result of the Group’s ongoing success
the Board is delighted to announce that it
is proposing an increase in overall dividends
for the year to 2.0p (2003: 1.0p). A final
dividend of 1.5p is proposed in addition
to the interim dividend of 0.5p
already paid. Payment will be made
on 26 May 2005 to shareholders on
the register on 22 April 2005.
Senior personnel
Tony Sweet, the chief financial officer,
will be leaving the Group with effect
from 30 June 2005 to pursue other
opportunities. A new finance director will
be appointed in due course. We would
like to thank Tony for his contribution to
the Company for the past two years and
wish him every success for the future.
Outlook
The Group now has an extensive global
presence and product profile. We remain
committed to growth, both organically
and by acquisition, and to the continued
enhancement of shareholder value.

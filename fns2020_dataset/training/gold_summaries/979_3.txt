 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2010
www.aamining.com 02
chAiRmAn’s st AtEmEnt It gives me great pleasure to report on the 
progress your Company has made during 
2010 as we gained momentum in terms 
of establishing Anglo Asian as a successful 
gold producer in Central Asia, boosting 
gold and copper production at our Gedabek 
mine in Azerbaijan (‘Gedabek’) and increasing 
profitability. Additionally, we have implemented 
defined exploration and development 
programmes across our 1,962 sq km 
portfolio of prospective copper and gold 
assets in Azerbaijan to delineate and 
upgrade the Company’s resource base, 
which currently stands at 791,000 ounces 
(‘oz’) of gold 49,300 tonnes of copper and 
7,597,000 oz of silver for all categories. 
For the year ended 31 December 2010 we 
exceeded our 60,000 oz gold production 
forecast at Gedabek, producing 67,267 oz 
with an average cash operating cost of 
US$358 per oz of gold including the 
Government of Azerbaijan’s share and 
US$412 per oz of gold net of the Government 
of Azerbaijan’s share. This positions Gedabek 
as a low cost producer and, in conjunction 
with gold sales of 57,398 oz completed at an 
average of US$1,241 per oz for the year, has 
seen us deliver a healthy profit before tax of 
US$19.8 million (2009: US$11.7 million loss) 
and operating cash flow before movement 
in working capital of US$47.0 million 
(2009: US$2.7 million) in the period.
In terms of 2010 copper production at Gedabek, 
our Sulphidisation, Acidification, Recycling 
and Thickening (‘SART’) plant, which recovers 
copper in the form of a precipitated copper 
sulphide concentrate containing silver with 
commercial value, commenced production 
in February 2010 and was fully operational 
by September 2010. Interestingly, application 
of this process commercially on such a scale 
has never previously been achieved and, 
although there were a few initial teething 
problems, we are pleased that the SART plant 
has performed in line with management 
expectations. The total copper concentrate 
produced in 2010 contained 182.5 tonnes 
of copper, 1,460 kg (46,940 oz) of silver and 
25.9 kg (833 oz) of gold. 
Post period end, Gedabek has continued to 
perform well with gold production for Q1 2011 
totalling 14,028 oz, which is a 3% increase 
on production for the comparable quarter 
in 2010. Copper and silver recovery from our 
SART operations has significantly improved, 
seeing us produce 104 tonnes of copper and 
762 kg (24,499 oz) of silver in the quarter. 
During 2010 a sales protocol was agreed 
with government partners for the sale of 
400 wet tonnes of copper concentrate. 
This sale will be substantially completed in 
May 2011 and will positively impact profits 
for the first half of the 2011 financial year. 
As with the sales of gold bullion under 
the Production Sharing Agreement (‘PSA’), 
12.75% of revenue received from the copper 
concentrate goes directly to the account of 
the Government of Azerbaijan. We are also 
currently in discussions with government 
partners regarding a further sales protocol 
for copper concentrate and look forward 
to updating the market on this development 
in due course.
Gedabek is an open pit, heap leach operation. 
During 2010, the volume of dry ore being 
transferred onto the leach pad improved each 
quarter. For the year ended 31 December 2010 
we transferred 821,176 tonnes of dry ore 
with an average gold content of 4.33 g/t. 
Improving Gedabek’s processing capabilities 
remains a key focus for Anglo Asian as we 
seek to hit our full year production target 
of a minimum of 60,000 oz of gold and 
525 tonnes of copper. At present, the mine 
life stands at six years with target production 
in excess of 300,000 oz of gold, however we 
are confident that we can expand this and 
the resource through exploration over the 
whole 300 sq km Contract Area at Gedabek. 
“ Improving Gedabek’s processing capabilities remains 
a key focus for Anglo Asian as we seek to hit our full 
year production target of a minimum of 60,000 oz 
of gold and 525 tonnes of copper.”

recovered all its carried forward, unrecovered 
costs, the Government of Azerbaijan effectively 
takes 12.75% of commercial products of each 
mine, with the Company taking 87.25%. 
We expect to continue retaining 87.25% 
of the commercial products until at least 
the end of 2011.
In 2010, Anglo Asian generated revenues 
of US$72.0 million (2009: US$10.3 million) 
as a result of gold and silver sales from the 
Gedabek mine. The revenues were generated 
from the sale of Anglo Asian’s share of the 
production for the year which comprised 
57,398 oz of gold and 35,922 oz of silver 
(2009: 9,656 oz of gold and 2,919 oz of 
silver) at an average price of US$1,241 
and US$22 respectively (2009: US$1,057 
and US$17). 
The Group incurred mining cost of sales 
of US$40.6 million (2009: US$8.4 million) 
and therefore reported a gross profit 
of US$31.4 million for 2010 (2009: 
US$1.9 million). 
The Group incurred administration expenses 
of US$5.1 million (2009: US$4.0 million) 
which, along with finance costs for the year 
of US$6.3 million (2009: US$3.3 million), 
resulted in a profit before tax for the year of 
US$19.8 million (2009: loss of US$11.7 million). 
The price of gold steadily increased throughout 
2010 and in to 2011 and has been a key factor 
in the Company’s financial performance.
As with any business, a strong, stable team 
can be directly linked to its success and we 
believe Anglo Asian is no different. I am 
delighted with our Board and highly skilled 
management team, which are working well 
together and delivering solid results for the 
Company. Our whole staff now consists of 
approximately 427 personnel, from mining 
engineers to geologists and project managers, 
and notably during the year we appointed 
a new geological consultant. 
As ever, maintaining good health, safety, 
social and environmental standards is very 
important to us. We have now established 
a Health, Safety, Environment and Technology 
Committee (‘HSET’) at Board level, under the 
chairmanship of Professor John Monhemius, 
one of our Non-executive Directors. 
This committee has the responsibility to oversee 
all aspects of the HSET performance of the 
Company and to make recommendations to 
the Board. Post period we also appointed an 
experienced Health, Safety and Environment 
manager as a full-time member of our 
corporate management team.
With this in mind, we implemented a defined 
strategy in 2010 to reassess the data employed 
in making the JORC compliant mineral 
resources statement provided by SRK consulting 
(‘SRK’) in 2006. As a result in October 2010 
we were delighted to announce a resource 
upgrade to 791,000 oz of gold, 49,300 tonnes 
of copper and 7,597,000 oz of silver at a 
cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t gold for all categories, 
which after taking account of ore already 
mined as of 7 June 2010, gave a total gold 
uplift across the Measured and Indicated 
resource categories of 31%.
A further resource development programme, 
which aims to increase the confidence of 
the resource estimate and to increase the 
resource base, is now underway at the Gedabek 
Contract Area and includes a 17,500m drilling 
programme. We look forward to updating 
shareholders on developments and exploration 
results in due course. 
Unlocking the intrinsic value of the rest of 
our portfolio in Azerbaijan is also high on our 
agenda. Therefore in 2010 we commenced 
further exploration programmes at our two 
grassroots projects, Gosha and Ordubad, 
which are 300 sq km and 462 sq km 
respectively. Post period end in February 2011 
we submitted a Notice of Discovery at Gosha. 
Further exploration is now planned with 
a view to confirming a small gold deposit 
with production potential. At out Ordubad 
Contract Area, we have successfully extended 
the licence for a further year through to 
April 2012.
As shareholders will be aware, we have 
a strong relationship with the Government 
of Azerbaijan and we continue to be very 
grateful for its support. In addition, we 
continue to work closely with the International 
Bank of Azerbaijan (‘IBA’), which is majority 
owned by the Government of Azerbaijan 
and has supported us through our mine 
development stage with loan financing, which 
peaked at US$43.7 million in March 2010. 
With our increasing profitability we are delighted 
to announce that during the period we 
have significantly reduced this amount 
to US$29.6 million at 31 December 2010 
and subsequently to US$21.0 million as of 
25 May 2011. We are confident that by the 
end of 2011, with production revenues in 
line with management expectations, we will 
have paid off all, or nearly all, of our debt 
to the IBA. 
As highlighted in previous reports, Anglo Asian 
has a PSA in place with the Government of 
Azerbaijan based on the established Azeri 
oil industry. Up until the time Anglo Asian has 
In regard to our social responsibilities, we 
are committed to assisting Gedabek’s local 
community. During 2010, we launched our 
second beekeeping project. The programme 
consisted of a ten week beekeeping course 
in Gedabek, the first in Azerbaijan, where 
28 students graduated. The Company provided 
short-term loans to 20 graduates who bought 
65 beehives to start their beekeeping business. 
The Company’s internet café was open to the 
public during the year and over 350 people 
visited the centre. The centre offers short 
computer courses to the public and 280 people 
attended the courses. In addition, the Company 
undertook to construct a 2 km road in the 
Arikhdam village, near Gedabek, and repaired 
a connecting bridge. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate that gold 
and copper production from Gedabek will 
be steady and combined with a continued 
buoyant gold price should deliver increased 
revenues for the forthcoming year. In addition, 
I believe the development of our extensive 
exploration portfolio to fulfil our mid to 
long-term strategy of building multiple gold 
mines will gain traction during the year and 
add further value for shareholders. 
Finally, I would like to thank the employees, 
my fellow Directors, advisors and shareholders 
for their continued support and I look forward 
to updating shareholders regularly on the 
progress of what is now a highly profitable, 
cash-generative, producing gold company.

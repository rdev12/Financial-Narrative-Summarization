Introduction
On behalf of the Board of Compass Finance Group plc (“Compass Finance” or “the Group”),
I am pleased to present the results for the period ended 30 September 2004.
The Group was originally incorporated on 9 April 2003 and was formerly known as Sound
Growth plc up until its acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Compass Finance Ltd
(and its dormant subsidiary Compass Homeloans Ltd) and Compass Capital Planning Ltd
(dormant) on 8 March 2004. On the same date the Company changed its name and
commenced trading. The consolidated figures therefore only include the results for the Group
for the period from 8 March 2004 to 30 September 2004. On 8 September 2004 the trading
assets of Compass Finance Ltd were hived up into Compass Finance Group plc and is now
the only trading company in the Group.
On 8 March 2004 and in conjunction with this acquisition the Group floated on AIM and
commenced trading.
The Group is a finance broker and packager of re-mortgages, secured loans and unsecured
loans for clients requiring debt consolidation and financial solutions. It should be noted that
Compass Finance does not lend money to customers; the Group earns its income from
commissions and fees received primarily from third party lenders.
Statutory Results
For the period from 9 April 2003 to 30 September 2004, the Group reported turnover of
£8.57 million and a profit before tax of £1.52 million. For the same period earnings per share
were 1.46p.
In the period 8 March 2004 to 30 September 2004, following the acquisition of Compass
Finance Limited, the Group received broking commission on funds of £115 million which were
lent to customers by a number of lenders. Net debt at 30 September 2004 was £2.21 million
resulting in gearing at 30 September 2004 of 33%.
The net asset value of the Group as at 30 September 2004 was £6.64 million.

The statutory results from 9 April 2003 to 30 September 2004 are contained in full in the
financial statements from page 12. In order to understand the underlying trends on a year on

Compass Finance includes the trading businesses of Compass Finance Ltd and Compass
Homeloans Ltd for the 12 months periods ending 30 September each year. The trade and
assets of Compass Homeloans Ltd were hived up into Compass Finance Ltd on 
31 December 2002. The 2003 pro-forma figures include three months of Compass
Homeloans Ltd’s unaudited management accounts for 1 October 2002 to 31 December
2002. The results of Compass Finance Group plc are included from 8 March 2004.
Pro-forma turnover of the Group’s companies for the 12 months to 30 September 2004 was
£13.16 million which reflected record sales in the last six months of £7.54 million. 
Pro-forma operating profit for the 12 months period to 30 September 2004 was £2.19 million
(2003: £1.76 million). The 2004 profit before tax includes costs associated with the
acquisition of Compass Finance Ltd from 8 March 2004 to 30 September 2004 totalling
£524,000, including bank loan interest of £142,000 and amortisation of £278,000. Adding
back the £524,000 the adjusted profit before tax and plc costs is £2.58 million, which is 48%
up on 2003.
Dividends
In view of the sustained growth in profits, the Board has decided to pay a maiden final
dividend of 0.15p per share for the period ended 30 September 2004. Subject to approval of
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23 February 2005, the dividend will
be paid on 6 April 2005 to those shareholders on the register at 18 February 2005. 
Subject to the Group’s results, the Board plans to implement a progressive dividend policy
going forward.
Operating Highlights
On 17 September 2004 the Group received authorisation from the Financial Services
Authority (FSA) to conduct mortgage and general insurance business following legislative
changes.
To underline the Group’ s growth, I have summarised the last five year’ s sales history of the Group’ s
companies on an annualised basis. This includes the trading businesses of Compass Finance Ltd
and Compass Homeloans Ltd for the 12 months periods ending 30 September each year. From 8
March 2004 the results of Compass Finance Group plc are included.

The encouraging sales growth for the period ended 30 September 2004 reflects the
commissions earned from increasing volumes of loans sold. As at 30 September 2004, £180
million of loans had been packaged compared to £118 million for the year ended 30
September 2003.
Staff numbers during the period have grown from 79 to 115 reflecting the growth in new
business. I have summarised the last five years’ employee numbers (as at the September
year ends):

The Group attracts customers through target marketing and advertising. It then undertakes a
comprehensive fact-find to ensure the needs and circumstances of the client are matched to
one of a portfolio of lenders. To complement this, a service based approach with personal
visits to customers by client account executives enables the Group to convert 18% of all
enquiries received. 
Current Market Conditions 
The housing market is not showing the significant rises it did earlier on in 2004. As Compass
Finance rarely provides new mortgages, its fortunes are not directly aligned to the housing
market. Any sustained reduction in house prices, along with continued interest rate rises,
would impact on the mortgage market, and we believe that demand for the Group’s services
could feasibly increase, as debt servicing becomes more onerous. 
Consumer debt now borders on £1trillion in the UK. With the Group’s penetration into its
chosen markets remaining minimal, organic growth continues to be the main strategy,
although other expansion opportunities will be explored when appropriate.
Customer borrowing has been at record levels, fuelled by historically low interest rates.
Recent interest rate rises have shifted the opportunity to debt consolidation products as
customers struggle to service existing debt.
The new FSA regulatory environment will further improve the perception of the mortgage
industry and drive consolidation, providing the Group with the opportunity to consider
acquiring businesses and to build market share.
Current Trading and Prospects
The UK debt consolidation market has experienced significant growth in recent years and
Compass Finance has established itself as a force within the mortgage and loans broking
industry. A combination of tailored customer service, marketing specifically targeted at
borrowers requiring debt consolidation and credit repair, and industry leading levels of
conversion of new leads has produced strong growth and momentum.
Trading since the 30 September 2004 has been encouraging and in line with management’s
expectations, the Board expects further good progress in the current year and remains
confident about the Group’s long-term potential.

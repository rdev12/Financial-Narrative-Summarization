Genus plc  Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
“ The Board is focused on the Group’s continued 
growth, its research and development capabilities, 
and its expansion into new markets. We will 
continue to support the implementation of our 
strategy, as Genus seeks to benefit from the large 
and growing opportunity for animal genetics.”
Lykele van der Broek joined the 
Board on 1 July 2014. Before 
his retirement from Bayer 
CropScience, a division of Bayer 
AG, he held a number of senior 
international roles, including 
heading its BioScience division.
After eight years on the Board, 
Professor Barry Furr has indicated 
that he feels it is time to step 
down and so will retire at the 
Annual General Meeting in 
November 2014. Barry has provided 
invaluable scientific advice, in 
his role as Scientific Adviser to 
our Research and Development 
Portfolio Management Team and 
the Science Committee he chaired 
before that. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank him for his 
enormous contribution and to wish 
him well for the future. Duncan 
Maskell will become our Scientific 
Adviser on Barry’s retirement.
During the year, we also 
welcomed Dan Hartley as our 
new Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary. Dan 
brings a wealth of legal and 
biotech experience to Genus.
2014 was a challenging year for 
Genus and the Board is well aware 
that it was not a rewarding year for 
shareholders. The Group’s results 
for the year were unchanged in 
constant currency but lower in 
actual currency, due to the strength 
of Sterling in the year. Despite 
the challenging environment 
resulting from unexpected disease 
outbreaks and Chinese market 
conditions, our team of 2,300 
employees in over 25 countries has 
enabled Genus to achieve much 
more significant progress than 
the headline numbers suggest. 
I thank them for their commitment 
and hard work during the year.
The most visible evidence of 
this strategic progress is the 
acquisition of Génétiporc, which 
is meeting its objectives and 
already making an important 
contribution to performance as 
well as strengthening the genetic 
pool within PIC. We also made 
important progress in areas such as 
accelerating genetic improvement 
and adjusting the way we address 
key markets such as China. You 
can read more about the Group’s 
performance and progress in 
Karim’s report on pages 6 and 7.
Tough conditions within our markets 
have challenged us to sharpen our 
knowledge of the dynamics and risks 
of our business, and how we can 
respond effectively. Such capabilities 
can only be deployed if the 
management team is of sufficient 
calibre. Since Karim became CEO, 
he has created an outstanding 
leadership team with a mix of 
existing people in revised roles and 
new recruits to fill the gaps. As a 
Board we are now witnessing the 
impact that this team is beginning to 
have and it reinforces our confidence 
in our ability to create sustainable 
value from the large strategic 
opportunity which Genus has.
Strengthening the Board
The appointments of two new 
Non-Executive Directors strengthen 
the Board, as we seek to grow 
the business. Both of them bring 
experience and knowledge that 
will have great value to Genus. 
Professor Duncan Maskell joined 
us on 1 April 2014. He is one of the 
most senior scientists at Cambridge 
University and has been instrumental 
in co-founding several biotech 
companies. He also has extensive 
experience in advising companies 
on science and innovation. 05

Additional 
Information
It is important that as a Board we 
are close to the markets in which 
Genus operates, so we can make 
the right strategic choices. This 
year the Board visited China, which 
was extremely valuable given the 
impact it had on the Group’s results. 
Our visit helped us to understand 
at first hand the customers and 
markets there, as we refined our 
strategy for the country. In 2013, 
the Board visited Italy and in 2015 
we plan to visit Brazil, enabling 
us to cover three key continents 
over a three-year period. 
You can read more about 
how the Board operated in 
2014 and the importance we 
attach to good governance 
in the Corporate Governance 
section on pages 48 to 86.
Dividend
The Board is always aware 
that it directs the Company 
on the shareholders’ behalf. 
Providing attractive returns to 
shareholders is an important 
part of our corporate goals.
The Board is therefore 
recommending a final dividend of 
12.2 pence per share, which together 
with the interim dividend of 5.5 
pence per share, will result in a 
dividend for the year of 17.7 pence 
per share, an increase of 10% over 
last year’s dividend. This continues 
our progressive dividend policy and 
reflects the Board’s confidence in 
Genus’s future. It is proposed that 
the final dividend will be paid on 
5 December 2014 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of 
business on 21 November 2014.
Summary
In summary, the Board is focused 
on the Group’s continued growth, 
its research and development 
capabilities, and its expansion into 
new markets. We will continue to 
support the implementation of 
our strategy, as Genus seeks to 
benefit from the large and growing 
opportunity for animal genetics.

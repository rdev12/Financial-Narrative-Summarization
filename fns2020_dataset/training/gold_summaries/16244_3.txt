 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005  Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005
I became the Chairman of 
Ubiquity in May 2005 timed with 
the Company’s flotation on AIM. 
Having spent the last 22 years in 
the telecommunications industry 
in roles ranging from Research  
and Development through to 
Chief Technology Officer of both 
a fixed line and mobile operator,  
I feel adequately grounded  
to comment on the evolution  
of technology in the 
telecommunications industry.  
It is my belief that Ubiquity is 
uniquely positioned to take 
advantage of the next round  
of fundamental changes in the 
telecommunications industry. 
These changes are generally 
characterised as the convergence 
of information technology and 
telecommunications technology. 
This convergence will result in 
large open standard information 
technology-based architectures, 
products and services which  
were previously dominated  
by proprietary and expensive 
technology solutions. Industry 
analysts project this spend to be 
over $30 billion in the next several 
years. Over time the ultimate 
customers will have better value, 
variety and better designed and 
complementary families of 
products and services available  
to them. 
The evolution to next-generation 
architectures and their resultant 
products and services will take 
place at different paces for 
different Service Providers. The 
technology will also give rise to 
completely new Service Providers 
of which NetZero and Skype are 
outstanding examples. One can 
see very ambitious evolutions in 
some of the traditional fixed-line 
Service Providers, and one can see 
Service Providers who have yet to 
come to grips with the changes 
enabled by this technology. 
Ubiquity provides a very complex 
and important part of the new 
architecture which facilitates the 
creation, coordination, and 
sharing of common resources  
for new products and services.
You can best think of Ubiquity’s 
offering as having two major 
elements. First, it has a super-high-
capacity server to run complex 
and valuable services for Service 
Providers (services in the future will 
be written in a way that is much 
more consistent with rich web 
pages than monolithic, vertically 
integrated software). Second, 
Ubiquity provides the tools and 
service creation environment to 
make the job of designing services 
(particularly those which can or 
should inter-operate with other 
services) much easier and 
inherently faster. Early architecture 
wins and the selection of Ubiquity 
as a partner by many of the large 
suppliers to the Service Providers’ 
space is a good indication of the 
respect and reputation that 
Ubiquity continues to build.
The Board
Leading to the preparation for the 
flotation, there were a number  
of changes to the Board of 
Directors, mostly driven by our 
appetite to comply with best 
practice recommendations.  
I would like to thank those 
Directors who left the Board for 
their contribution during their 
This exciting evolution in the 
telecommunications industry provides 
a tremendous opportunity; however, it 
is not without challenges. Companies 
like Ubiquity will have to both lead and 
serve this evolution.
Chairman’s statement
Chris Burke, Chairman of the Board Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005 Ubiquity Software Corporation PLC Annual report and financial statements 2005   
tenure. I would also like to 
welcome a new Board member 
and a new Company Secretary 
who joined with me this year. 
David Seibel, who brings a wealth 
of experience from his former 
position as Chairman of Accenture 
Canada, also joined the Board as  
a Non-Executive Director and is 
Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Rafferty Atha Jackson, a former 
associate general counsel from 
Macromedia, joined the Company 
in 2004 as General Counsel  
and was appointed to Company 
Secretary in May 2005. 
The Advisory Board
We also have an Advisory Board. 
This Advisory Board is chaired by 
Patrick Smith, who brings 
significant experience to the role 
as a former executive board 
member of Sprint US and Sprint 
Canada. The composition of the 
Advisory Board is designed to be 
dynamic and fluid. Depending 
upon specific windows of strategic 
execution, the Advisory Board 
pulls on various executives and 
skill sets from within the industry. 
The mandate of the Advisory 
Board is to enhance shareholder 
value by providing executive 
management with support and 
advice from leaders in industry, 
academia and professional 
societies with a focus on 
development of strategic business 
opportunities, product strategy 
and brand.
Outlook
This exciting evolution in the 
telecommunications industry 
provides a tremendous 
opportunity; however, it is not 
without challenges. Companies 
like Ubiquity will have to both lead 
and serve this evolution. The 
threats to the Service Providers as 
we know them today are obvious 
and well documented, but very 
difficult for them to address. There 
are few parallels and precedents 
for this magnitude of change in 
this industry. As such, predicting 
the speed of reaction of the 
various fixed, wireless and cable 
Carriers, across multiple 
geographies, all with differing 
competitive challenges and 
evolving pricing strategies, is very 
difficult. We will therefore continue 
to carefully invest in line with our 
financial goal of matching revenue 
growth with required expenses to 
meet the demand of delivering to 
a growing customer base. What is 
predictable and inevitable is that 
all of the various fixed, wireless, 
and cable Carriers have started 
moving towards addressing this 
evolution. I have every faith in the 
role Ubiquity is to play and the 
value it brings across the spectrum 
of new Service Providers to  
mega-Carriers. We have an 
excellent reputation in the industry, 
a great and growing base of 
customers, and a strong financial 
position that I believe will enable 
us to grow as we develop with  
the market. We are very excited 
about our prospects.

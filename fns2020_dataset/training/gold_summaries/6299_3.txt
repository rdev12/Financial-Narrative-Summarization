 Annual Report 2011
Chairman’s statement
16
It gives me great pleasure to introduce 
the Company’s maiden results following 
the admission to the AIM market in 
July 2010. The Company has enjoyed 
a good year with turnover increasing 
to more than £5 million for the first 
time and our highest ever headline 
operating profits of £0.7 million.
It is an exciting time to be involved in 
digital marketing communications. The 
dramatic shift of marketing investment 
to online activity experienced during the 
last five years continues unabated, as 
the technology and techniques available 
to marketeers constantly evolve. This 
evolution has led to the ability to monitor 
and measure activity in real-time.
fuse8’s services are a strong proposition 
for marketeers; having been involved in 
digital communications for over a decade, 
and with a deep understanding of how 
to harness the technology available 
to engage with customers, fuse8 can 
give brands, and therefore sales, real 
momentum. fuse8 acts as reliable counsel 
in a complex business discipline.
This is also an exciting time for the 
Company. The blend of its digital 
communications heritage, together 
with award-winning work and relentless 
attention to its clients’ needs, means it 
is an attractive partner to clients and the 
Company’s reputation attracts a strong 
new business pipeline. This is apparent as 
the Company achieved its fifth consecutive 
year of revenue growth, despite the 
challenging economic environment.
Securing a London base last year was a 
strategic step forward and involvement 
in this market will help the business grow 
in the future. fuse8 continues to move 
ahead in line with its stated acquisition 
strategy and looks forward to both organic 
growth and further strategic acquisitions 
to drive the Company’s growth.
Our business thrives due to the skill and 
dedication of each member of our team, 
both in the UK and in Russia, and I would 
like to offer my thanks to all of them.
Securing a London 
base last year 
was a strategic 
step forward and 
involvement in this 
market will help 
the business grow 
in the future.

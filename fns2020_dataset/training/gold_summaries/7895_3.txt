Chairman’s statement
Continued growth
“ Once again I am pleased to report that the IDS Group 
has stood up to the plate and delivered another very 
good set of results. Management and employees 
alike have worked well together and are creating  
a unique culture here at IDS, a culture that has 
contributed to our growth in both turnover and 
profitability and whilst I have no doubt that there  
will be many challenges ahead of us I am sure that 
our “Esprit de corps” will enable us to overcome 
them and continue to flourish!”
Dear Shareholder,
I am delighted to report on another year of continued 
growth at Immunodiagnostic Systems.
Increased sales and profitability have resulted from the 
continuing demand for our manual products, especially 
Vitamin D, as well as the successful roll-out of the 
IDS-iSYS and the launch of five more automated products 
that sit alongside our automated 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D.
Highlights
The continued worldwide demand for Vitamin D testing 
has seen our manual Vitamin D sales increase by 72% 
to £22,000,000 up from £12,820,000 in 2009.
All subsidiary companies within the IDS Group have 
experienced a growth in sales and profitability this year.
Our Group companies have been able to accommodate 
a significant increase in demand for our products, 
especially the automated analyser the IDS-iSYS. Our 
French subsidiary based in Pouilly has been able to 
match demand and incorporate system upgrades to 
reflect market feedback from our customer base. In 
addition to the instruments themselves, our Belgian 
subsidiary based in Liège which manufactures the 
automated reagents has been able to meet customer 
demand for a rapidly expanding product portfolio.
Average revenue per instrument from reagent rental 
accounts at a constant exchange rate was £77,000, 
slightly higher than management expectations.
We have also seen a very pleasant growth in our share 
price which has increased by circa 285% from 198.5p  
at 31 March 2009 to 765p as at 31 March 2010.
Lowlights
The longer-than-anticipated clearance from the US Food 
& Drug Administration (FDA) obviously caused some 
angst amongst shareholders and employees alike. 
However, now that we have 510(k) clearance under  
our belt, we are confident that we can successfully  
take a share of the automated market within the USA.
Having by year end sold or placed 74 IDS-iSYS 
instruments post launch, the Directors believe they are 
slightly behind where they had hoped to be at year-end 
and this is due in no small part to the delay in getting a 
positive FDA decision. We hope to rectify this in the 
fullness of time.
Results
Turnover has increased by 49% to £37,158,000 (2009: 
£24,937,000) with increased automated revenues from 
the IDS-iSYS accounting for a little more than 18% of 
this growth.
Gross profit has increased substantially during the period 
from £16,580,000 in 2009 to £27,516,000 in 2010, an 
increase of 66% as we benefited from a favorable product 
mix and certain economies of scale associated with 
increased demand for our main products.
Overall profits from operations increased by 110% from 
£5,367,000 to £11,283,000.
Financing
Our financing costs have decreased from £703,000 to 
£555,000 reflecting the reducing amount of debt we 
have in the business and an enhanced foreign currency 
exchange gain compared to last year.

Taxation
The charge to taxation is £2,911,000 compared to 
£585,000 in the previous year and represents an 
effective rate of 26.5%. The effective rate reflects the 
varying taxation rate applicable per country where IDS 
has a subsidiary as well as favorable allowances for 
R&D tax credits.
Profit after Taxation
Overall profit after tax has increased from £4,196,000  
to £8,075,000 reflecting an increase of 92%.
EPS
The Earnings per Ordinary Share has increased from 
16.918p to 30.017p an increase of 77%. Fully diluted the 
total increase is 79% (28.926p vs 16.166p).
Balance sheet
Current Assets
Cash at bank was up 18.4% to £5,276,000  •	
(2009: £4,456,000);
Trade and other receivables increased from •	
£8,598,000 to £10,806,000 and reflects our 
increased turnover whilst also containing the monies 
due to us from Escalon Drew in relation to the 
disposal of the Haematolgy business in December 
2008 as deferred consideration;
Inventories have increased from £5,737,000 to •	
£6,427,000 reflecting our increased turnover and 
stock of automated instruments and components.
Liabilities
Bank borrowings have decreased from £13,729,000 to 
£11,230,000 due in part to the weakening of the Euro 
and capital repayments.
Provisions
The main reduction in provision has been to reduce the 
earn-out liability to the former shareholders of Biocode 
Hycel reflecting revised assumptions and the first 
earn-out payment.
Direction and growth
I am very pleased with the progress made by the Company 
at integrating the businesses units within the Group and the 
steps taken to create the concept of ‘One IDS’. This can 
only strengthen our attitudes towards working well with 
each other and help increase our efficiencies within the 
business.
The strategic direction remains the same: New Product 
Development, Geographic Growth and Acquisition and our 
goal is execution. So far I believe we are on track and are 
accelerating in the direction set out in the CEO’s report.
I am pleased to reflect upon the two new non-executive 
Directors we have appointed recently, both Burkhard Wittek 
and Patrik Dahlen bring individual strengths and experience 
to our Board of Directors and I am sure the company will 
benefit going forward. In addition to the two new non-
executive Directors, we have added to our headcount with 
additional staffing in almost all areas of the business from 
middle and senior management to production, operations, 
technical and engineering support, so much so that our 
headcount has increased from 206 last year to 241 and 
remains in line with management expectations.
Management
Going forward, we announce a changing of the guard 
as from 1 October, with Ian Cookson, now the Chief 
Operating Officer, succeeding Roger Duggan as Chief 
Executive Officer. I would like to pay tribute to Roger’s 
knowledge, drive and leadership in ensuring that IDS 
has become the leading independent IVD company in 
the UK. I am glad to say that Roger will continue on at 
Board level in a business development role. 
A-Z
“ Turnover for the year ending  
31 March 2010 was £37.2m,  
49% ahead of last year’s 
performance (fy/e 31 March  
2009: £24.9m) and trading in all  
of the Group’s main territories  
has increased year on year.  
Sales into the USA, France, 
Germany and the UK have  
grown significantly this year.”
David Evans, Non-Executive Chairman
As Ian takes the baton on I am sure that his own drive, 
operational experience and attention to process and 
detail will ensure that IDS moves to becoming a still 
more significant and established IVD Company.
Outlook
The trading for the first three months of the year is in line 
with management expectations. Revenues for the first 
three months of the year have been £11.5m compared 
to £8.5m for the comparative period last year and the 
Directors believe the increased market acceptance of 
the IDS-iSYS with its expanding menu will continue and 
bodes well for the future particularly given the recent 
clearance to market in the USA.
Post launch we have now placed or sold more than 
100 instruments and the Directors believe that this 
number can be substantially improved upon as our 
product menu continues to develop and grow, as does 
the infrastructure we have developed to support the 
customer during their decision-making process and 
thereafter post-installation and routine use.
The opportunities laid at our feet as a result of having 
the IDS-iSYS are truly remarkable and I look forward to 
updating you throughout the year on:
Additional product launches on the IDS-iSYS •	
Regulatory submission and approval on our new •	
automated products
Expansion of our IP portfolio •	
Leveraging our automated technology •	
Finally, the growth we have experienced over the last 
twelve months could not have been achieved without  
the total commitment of our global workforce and the 
continued support of our Shareholder base. I would 
formally like to record my thanks to both groups.

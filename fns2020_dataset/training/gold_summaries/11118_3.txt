 Next Fifteen Communications Group plc 
(‘Next Fifteen’ or ‘the Group’), the global public 
relations consultancy group, is pleased to report its 
results for the year to 31 July 2010. The Group has 
emerged from the global recession to produce 
record results and continues to trade well despite 
ongoing uncertainties in the western economies. 
The Group has reported revenues up 10.6% to 
£72.3m (2009: £65.4m). Profi tability has recovered 
well, with profi t before tax up 68% to £5.3m 
(2009: £3.2m), while adjusted profi t was up 26% 
to £6.6m (2009: £5.2m) (see note 5). Basic earnings 
per share rose 84% to 6.75p (2009: 3.67p), with 
adjusted basic earnings per share up 30% at 8.45p 
(2009: 6.48p) (see note 10). The Group continues to 
have a strong balance sheet, ending the year with 
net debt of £0.9m (2009: net cash of £1.8m) (see note 
1 9), achieved after making £5.1m of acquisition-
related payments. In view of these results and the 
current trading, the Board has proposed a fi nal 
dividend of 1.375p per share, which sees dividends 
increase 9% to 1.85p for the year (2009: 1.70p). 
The Group has recently acquired an 85% stake in 
San Francisco-based The Blueshirt Group, LLC, 
an investor relations company that services 
the technology market (see note 29). 
The Blueshirt acquisition will give opportunities 
for cross referrals between the Group’s existing US 
businesses, whilst also opening up a revenue 
stream in a new sector of communications.
Corporate activity
At the start of the fi nancial year, the Group 
announced the acquisition of New York-based 
consumer agency M Booth & Associates, Inc. This 
was followed in October 2009 by the acquisition of 
the Asian PR assets of AIM-listed Upstream Marketing 
and Communications, Inc, which expands the 
Group’s operations in Asia Pacifi c. Upstream has 
been integrated into Bite’s business, to complement 
its existing US and European operations. During the 
year the Group purchased a further 36% stake in 
463 Communications, LLC, a US-based policy 
communication consultancy, increasing its holding 
to 76%. Just after the year end, the Group launched 
Beyond, a digital agency which has offi  ces in 
London, New York and San Francisco. This was 
created by combining the Group’s existing Context 
Analytics business and Type 3 Limited, a digital 
agency acquired in August 2010. This new venture 
has already secured clients that include Google, 
Cisco, Hilton Hotels and Virgin America. Lastly, the 
Group recently acquired OneXeno Limited, a digital 
marketing agency in Hong Kong, which has been 
integrated with Bite’s operations in that region.

The US and Canada PR business was strengthened 
by the addition of M Booth and now delivers around 
half the revenue for the Group and more than half its 
profi ts. The UK PR segment remains the second 
biggest despite a year-on-year decline, but grew 
7 .5% in the second half, showing good momentum. 
Europe and Africa had stable revenue aided by 
a stronger euro, and it was pleasing to see an 
improvement in the operating margin. The Asia 
Pacifi c segment showed 30% revenue growth 
aided by stronger currency and the acquisition of 
Upstream, which added £2m of revenue, but as a 
break-even business it had the eff ect of reducing 
segment margins. The Upstream business is now in 
profi t, which will help segment margins improve 
in the future. The other segments are research 
and digital consultancy, where good progress 
is being made.
Client-base continues to improve
The Group has an impressive client-base that 
includes IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Facebook, HP , AMD, 
Unilever and Coca-Cola. This has been further 
improved by the addition of TiVo, Allied Bakeries, 
Hershey’s, Alibaba, Bloom Energy, Trend Micro and 
Schneider Electric. The top ten clients accounted for 
32% of revenues at the year end: this compares to 
36% in 2009. Unlike some other marketing services 
groups, Next Fifteen has no direct exposure to 
government spending and will therefore be largely 
unaff ected as western governments cut back on 
expenditure in this area.
Strategy
The Group continues to explore organic growth 
opportunities supported by selective acquisitions 
of specialist agencies in growth sectors, hence the 
acquisitions of M Booth, Upstream, OneXeno, Type 3 
and Blueshirt mentioned above. The creation of 
digital agency Beyond, which increases the Group’s 
capabilities in social media and related digital 
services, is further evidence that the Group 
continues to focus on long-term growth. 
With strong cash-generation from operations and 
existing acquisition facilities, the Group remains 
well placed to make additional targeted acquisitions 
of a size that would maintain a strong balance sheet, 
an approach that the Board continues to feel is 
prudent given the current economic climate.
Prospects
The Group has recovered well from the economic 
slowdown and has continued to invest in its future, 
while maintaining one of the most conservative 
balance sheets in the UK marketing services sector. 
It remains highly ambitious and believes it has 
signifi cant opportunities for growth over the 
medium term, through both organic growth and 
selective acquisitions. The Group is experiencing an 
improvement in trading conditions, particularly in 
North America and Asia but will continue to manage 
the business in a way that refl ects the general 
uncertainty that surrounds the pace of economic 
recovery. That said, in the fi rst two months of the 
current fi nancial year, the Group has seen good 
momentum and the Board remains optimistic 
about prospects for the year.

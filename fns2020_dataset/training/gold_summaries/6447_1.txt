Strategic growth prospects
Focus on customer value
At the core of GTE’s growth strategy
is an intense focus on gas turbine
solutions that provide compelling
economic and environmental value.
Customers turn to GTE to help them
handle several increasingly urgent
operational issues:
 Extreme pressure on customer
operating expenses. GTE’s
solutions offer greater fuel efﬁciency,
parts life extension and reduced
service and maintenance costs.
 Constrained capital markets and
limited budgets for new project
expenditure. GTE offers increased
power output solutions for existing
assets, thereby helping to reduce
the need for new plants.
 Tightening environmental
restrictions and evolution of
emissions cap and trade
mechanisms. GTE offers a portfolio
of solutions that reduce a plant’s
emissions signature.
But this is only half the story.
Gas turbines power the economic
infrastructure in the form of aircraft
engines, power generators, process
industries and pipeline compression.
Such turbines are technically complex,
relatively high cost (US$5-30m per unit),
and serve the critical role of providing
energy to a host of activities. They are
generally operated by sophisticated
users with deep technical competence
and an aversion to unwarranted risk.
Only suppliers that are known to be
at technical parity with Original
Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)
are allowed to perform work on these
important assets.
GTE fully understands the complex
dynamics of the turbine market and
has built a world class team to service
it. GTE’s top 25 people have over
500 years’ experience at the highest
level of the industry and many are
viewed as “industry experts” in
their areas of technical expertise.
For customers, GTE’s engineering
depth and competence is one of its
most signiﬁcant differentiators.

developments in 2008 that reﬂect this:
 Launched the Fuels and Combustion
product lines, considered by many
to be at the top tier of the industry
technology ladder in terms of
complexity and barriers to entry.
It also moved us closer to the
“consumable parts and recurring
repair” stream of the gas turbine
aftermarket.
 Our exclusive channel partner,
Pratt & Whitney, announced growth
of ten times, a reﬂection of the
aviation industry’s recognition and
acceptance of technology beneﬁts.
 Industrial OEM revenue channel
grew at 125%, reﬂecting the
strengthening relationships and
value proposition with leading
companies in the sector.
 Third party and end user direct
revenue channel grew at 123%,
reﬂecting GTE’s rapidly growing
brand recognition and credibility
with the ultimate “buying decision
points” of the multi-billion dollar
gas turbine aftermarket.
 Positioned the business for future
growth and ﬂexibility by doubling
our operational facilities.
 Proved we have ﬁrm ﬁnancial
foundations both in the consolidated
statement of income, where we
scaled the business and largely
maintained our 42% gross margin,
and on the balance sheet where we
raised over US$10m of new capital.
 The number of patents granted to
GTE increased from 8 to 16 with
an additional 17 patent applications

also secured with Singapore Airlines,
Southwest Airlines, United Airlines as
well as military organisations.
08 GTE ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Reducing operational costs and increasing the output of existing
power generation assets means savings for the power producers that
can be passed on to their customers. GTE has designed and validated
EcoValue™ control retroﬁt solutions that have given GE 7FA combustion
turbine operators the ability to gain additional electrical capacity while
operating in a safe mode for parts life and emissions compliance. A large
independent power producer in the US has installed six upgrades to date
and immediately gained beneﬁt.
CUSTOMER BENEFIT:
 More than 24Mw gain in output.
 Strong return on investment.
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT:
 Operates within compliance for NOx, CO,

This thorough approach to new product
development will continue into the future
with any new GTE development product
and solution.
GTE works closely with numerous
high-proﬁle, leading companies, and
we ensure we have very high standards
in line with their best practice. Our quality
control team ensures compliance with
our customers’ requirements. We can
provide certiﬁcates of conformance,
material test reports and manufacturing
veriﬁcation data sheets to meet our
customers rigorous compliance
documentation requirements in the areas
of performance testing, emissions
monitoring and environmental
compliance.
Global operational excellence
Throughout 2008, GTE focused on
building an operational infrastructure
that can support the needs of our
expected future growth. Quality and
on-time delivery at a competitive price
is essential to our customers and to our
commercial reputation. 11 GTE ANNUAL REPORT 2008
We are proud to have excelled in this
area during 2008 in several key ways:
 Achieved ISO-9001:2000 certiﬁcation
in our Orlando, Florida facility and
were recertiﬁed in our Sweden facility.
 Successfully completed nine OEM
quality and environmental audits.
 Successfully completed six
end-user and third-party audits.
 Implemented lean manufacturing
to minimise working capital and
increase quality.
In addition, GTE took key steps to align
our assembly infrastructure in North
America and Europe to better handle
the signiﬁcant sales volume increases
we are beginning to experience
in our Aviation, Industrial and
Combustion product lines.
In Sweden during the ﬁrst quarter of
2009, we signed an agreement to be the
cornerstone business in a new “Green
City Business Park” outside Stockholm.
This new facility will be three times
the size of our previous one and will
be capable of satisfying increased
aviation demand as well as assembling
some of our new industrial and
combustion products.
Our Orlando, Florida facility was
expanded from 15,000 sq ft to 40,000
sq ft to handle the increased industrial
workload and also to serve as the US
service base for aviation.
Improving aircraft engine fuel efﬁciency saves airlines’ fuel costs
and reduces CO2 emissions, helping reduce passengers’ carbon
footprints. GTE has granted leading engine manufacturer, Pratt &
Whitney, exclusive distribution rights to its water wash equipment for
aircraft engines, which Pratt & Whitney markets under the EcoPower
®
brand name. EcoPower
®
technology can service all OEM brands of
commercial and military jet engines. So far, more than 60 aircraft
operators and 4,000 aircraft engines have beneﬁted from the system.
CUSTOMER BENEFIT:
 In 2008 alone, the EcoPower
®
programme saved
76m kg of aeroplane fuel and 242,000 tonnes
of CO
2
emissions, equivalent to removing over
26,600 cars from the road for a year.
 A clean engine reduces fuel consumption by up
to 1.3% and CO
2
emissions by 3.1kg per 1kg of
fuel saved.

12 GTE ANNUAL REPORT 2008
We also relocated to a new US south
corridor facility that effectively increases
our combustion product capability by
ﬁve times and includes co-location
alongside several important suppliers.
These strategic geographic steps
represent a key part of GTE’s growth
strategy, and this expanded international
footprint will pave the way for further
growth and expansion.
Customer and channel diversiﬁcation
GTE is very proud of its strong
relationships with its customers, and
has established a diverse range of
channels to ensure a robust and
resilient order book. Our world-class
team can generally move faster than
larger OEM organisations, and can
focus on advanced ﬂeets, legacy ﬂeets
and niche portions of the market.
In addition, our cost structure enables us
to be relatively nimble and sell solutions
through a variety of channels.
Our high-value technical solutions are
leveraged across:
 Multiple sales channels including
OEM, third parties and direct to
end users.
 Multiple applications including power
generation, oil & gas, 50Hz and 60Hz,
and heavy and light fuel markets.
 Multiple customer types including
utilities, IPPs, and energy providers.
 Multiple geographies including North
America, Europe, the Middle East
and Russia and Asia.
An independent energy generator gained US$3.3m
of added revenue through GTE’s advanced and rapid
combustion repair capabilities. GTE returned to service
combustion hardware faster than competitive offerings
which allowed this operator to run an estimated 276 hours,
that they would have lost otherwise.
This quick response ensures stable energy costs
for this operator’s customers.
CUSTOMER BENEFIT:
 Avoided extended plant shutdown.
 Avoided loss of revenue. 13 GTE ANNUAL REPORT 2008
During 2008 we focused heavily
on growing our customer base.
The experience, credibility and network
of the leadership team proved very
valuable in achieving signiﬁcant growth
across all channels and segments.
In addition, GTE received its ﬁrst order
in Kazakhstan its ﬁrst customer ﬂeet
approval in the Middle East and its ﬁrst
approval from a Russian OEM.
Commitment to the environment
GTE takes its corporate and social
responsibilities very seriously, in fact
CSR is at the core of everything we do.
It is our belief that CSR drives growth
as much as any of our own strategic
steps in our market place as we pride
ourselves on creating solutions that
improve the environmental impact of
our customers’ infrastructure.
GTE’s technology helps a range of
companies in the energy and aviation
spheres minimise the damage they do
to the environment – at the same time
as providing signiﬁcant and proven
economic beneﬁts.
During 2008, we introduced the family
of EcoValue™ solutions that provide
economic payback on fuel efﬁciency
alone in as little as six months, at the
same time as providing signiﬁcant
environmental beneﬁts. This economic
proposition makes it easy for an end
user to choose a “green” solution that
is compelling from an economic and
environmental point of view.
In 2008, we also introduced our
programme of “Power Made Efﬁcient”
to highlight the beneﬁts our products
bring to customers around the world,
whether it enables school lighting to
be provided in Thai villages or improves
aeroplane fuel efﬁciency, saves CO
2
emissions and helps reduce
passengers’ carbon footprints.
When it comes to our employees,
GTE has an intense focus on safety and
wellbeing. We believe our people are
our greatest asset, and we strive
to ensure their workplace is as secure
as possible. We are proud of our safety
record, and have had no accidents
for over ﬁve years. In addition, our
on-site safety index is at 0.86 – one
of the lowest levels in the industry.
Positive outlook
Despite the challenging global
economic environment in 2008,
GTE continued to establish itself as
a leading player in the international
aftermarket for gas turbines.
By building on the various strengths
of the Company, we have now created
a strong growth engine with which
to propel GTE forward.
The multi-billion dollar gas turbine
aftermarket and aviation turbine
cleaning market has proved its
resilience in these very difﬁcult
economic conditions. The beneﬁts our
services offer to owners of the globally
installed base of gas turbines are even
more relevant in these challenging
times. Customers want lower operating
costs and more output from their
assets, while being good stewards
of the environment. GTE can provide
them with the solution. These factors,
coupled with our strong ﬁnancial
statements, underpin our conﬁdence
for 2009 and beyond.
There are, of course, several
challenges facing the Group, including
managing high rates of growth,
maintaining strong partnerships and
deploying complex value-driven
services. However, I am conﬁdent that
the leadership team we have in place,
and the strong foundations we have
created at GTE, will enable us to meet
any challenge we encounter.
Trading for the ﬁrst three months of
2009 has continued to be robust in all
product areas and is in line with the
Board’s expectations. Revenues and
order backlog for the 2009 ﬁscal year
as of 31 March 2009 was US$26.7m,
up 53% on the same point in 2008.
The Group’s aviation operations are
showing strong progress year-on-year
beneﬁting from the framework order
received from Pratt & Whitney in
December 2008, as it accelerates
the roll-out of its “EcoPower
®
” engine
wash service worldwide.
Although mindful of the current global
economic climate, the Board believes
the Group’s product offering remains
compelling, especially for aviation,
power generation and oil & gas
segments. Consequently, we are
conﬁdent that the Group will continue
to grow strongly in 2009.

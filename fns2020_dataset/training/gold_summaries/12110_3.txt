PHOENIX IT GROUP plc
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
PETER BERTRAM
Chairman
“The Group took a major step forward with
the acquisition of Servo Computer Services
Limited in November 2006.”
REVIEW OF THE YEAR
I am pleased to report that 2007 was another
year of continued progress. The Group took a
major step forward with the acquisition of Servo
Computer Services Limited in November 2006.
Servo has greatly broadened the Group’s
customer base and markets served and the Board
is confident that this acquisition will contribute
significantly to the future growth of the Group.
Group revenues increased by 16.3% to
£126.7m (2006: £108.9m) and operating profit
before amortisation of acquired intangibles (see
page 28) increased by 6.0% to £22.7m (2006:
£21.4m). Profit from operations (after
amortisation of acquired intangibles) increased
by 6.8% to £20.7m (2006: £19.4m) and profit
before tax increased by 7.4% to £19.3m (2006:
£17.9m). The Group has continued to be highly
cash generative during the year with the free
cash flow
1
increasing by 8.4% to £23.6m
(2006: £21.7m).
Since the year end the Group has made a
recommended offer for ICM Computer
Group plc.

DIVIDEND
In view of the potential acquisition of ICM, the
Group declared a second interim dividend rather
than recommending a final dividend for the year
ended 31 March 2007. This dividend of 3.174p
per share was declared on 27 April 2007 and will
be paid on 15 June 2007 which, together with
the first interim dividend of 1.59p per share paid
on 2 February 2007, makes a total dividend for
the year to 31 March 2007 of 4.764p per share
(2006: 4.14p), an increase of 15.1%.
BOARD CHANGES
During the year we announced the appointment
of Jeremy Stafford as Chief Operating Officer.
Jeremy joined the Board on 24 April 2007 and
we are delighted to welcome him to the Group.
Jeremy’s experience in a range of senior
executive positions within BT will be of immense
value in the future development of the Group.
EMPLOYEES
We are fortunate to have a strong team of
talented and hardworking people in the Group
who have delivered the successful
performance achieved in the year and I thank
them all on behalf of the Board and the
Shareholders. I am also pleased to formally
welcome the management and staff of Servo to
Phoenix IT Group.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the
Group’s registered office, Technology House,
Hunsbury Hill Avenue, Northampton on
Wednesday, 22 August at 10.30 a.m. Formal
notice of this meeting and the necessary proxy
forms are enclosed with these financial
statements.
OUTLOOK
Market conditions and the performance of our
businesses since the year end are in line with
our expectations. The Board is confident that
the Group has the financial and commercial
base to continue its stated strategy of targeting
growth, both organically and by selective
acquisitions, as in the case of Servo. In
addition, the Board believes that the potential
acquisition of ICM would also create value for
Shareholders.

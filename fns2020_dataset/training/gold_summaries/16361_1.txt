 8 annual report 2006 
Operations
Revenue for the year was £293.2 million
(2005: £242.4 million) an increase of 
21 per cent; excluding the impact of 
recent acquisitions the underlying rate 
of growth was 14 per cent. Acquisitions
completed during the year accounted for
additional revenue of £12.1 million.
Against this, foreign exchange rate
movements, principally the US dollar and
the Euro against sterling, had the effect of
increasing reported revenue; at constant
exchange rates revenue would have been
£2.6 million lower.
Growth has been achieved across all
our business segments, reflecting the
recovery in the civil aerospace market,
significant growth in the demand for
our composite materials, particularly
from the wind energy market, and
additional volumes on existing and
new contracts.
Operating profit at £21.5 million
(2005: £16.0 million) increased by 
34 per cent, and by 23 per cent on an
underlying basis. Our operating margin
rose to 7.3 per cent (2005: 6.6 per cent)
reflecting the good margins of the
businesses recently acquired and
operational gearing. Whilst there have
been significant increases in certain 
raw material prices, we have largely 
been successful in passing these on
to customers.
Umeco Components
2006 2005
£ million £ million
Revenue 141.4 122.7
Operating profit 7.2 5.2
Umeco Components is a leading
international provider of value-added
distribution and supply chain outsourcing
services primarily to OEM customers in
the aerospace & defence markets. With 
its specialisation in the supply of small
components and its sophisticated IT
systems, significant operational, cost and
working capital benefits can be enjoyed 
by its growing global customer base.
Revenue increased in the year by
15 per cent, or by 10 per cent on an
underlying basis. The rise in revenue was
partially held back by the re-organisation 
of the electronic components activity in
January 2006 after a period of falling
demand. As a result, the industrial products
business unit was sold to management
whilst the aerospace products unit was
integrated into Pattonair and is now
expected to grow in the current year
following the securing of new franchises.
Operating profit increased in the period 
by 38 per cent, and by 27 per cent on an
underlying basis. This significant increase
in profitability arises from the recovery in
the civil aerospace market, an initial five

months’ contribution from Provest and
also reflects action taken to improve
margins through focused procurement
and cost control. The underlying result
was adversely affected by the very poor
results from Compstock prior to the 
re-organisation already referred to.
Pattonair in both the UK and France has
performed strongly since the management
changes made in September 2004 and 
Nick Robins, who heads these operations,
has also become responsible for integrating
Provest into a broader European distribution
business unit. The integration programme is
on schedule and considerable efforts have
been made to enhance Provest’s operations,
business development and financial
reporting systems. On 1 April 2006, Provest
changed its trading name to Pattonair.
Ulogistics Europe continues to expand its
relationship with Rolls-Royce plc, which had
a very successful 2005 finishing the year
with a record order book. A number of new
projects are planned for the current financial
year which will further broaden the scope
and scale of this very important contract.
As a consequence of Umeco Components
securing the contract with Goodrich
Actuation Systems in February 2006,
Pattonair’s trading activities with Goodrich
have been transferred to Ulogistics as 
from April. The renewed and expanded
agreement means that Ulogistics 
Europe has become responsible for the
management of the enlarged contract
with Goodrich Actuation Systems and a
dedicated team has been established to
ensure the successful implementation and
development of this project. The contract
is currently operating from an additional
leased property adjacent to the main
Ulogistics operation in Derby, and plans are
in place to acquire a new, larger freehold
property in the area during 2006, to house
both of these growing businesses.

It is encouraging to report that Pattonair
has already secured a number of new
contracts to replace the Goodrich revenues
transferred to Ulogistics.
Ulogistics North America, which manages
an important contract with Bombardier
Aerospace in Montreal, had a successful 
year aided by the provision of a number of
additional services, and is now actively
engaged with the customer on the planning
for a further roll-out of this contract.
Abscoa and TLC have now been integrated
and a number of senior management
changes were made during the second 
half year to further develop the key North
American market.
Umeco Components has recruited a
Singapore based managing director for
Asia who will be responsible for the
establishment of the new Chinese
distribution facility. A sales office in Madrid
is planned in the current financial year to
support customer relationships in the
Spanish aerospace market.
Umeco Composites
2006 2005
£ million £ million
Revenue 131.4 101.9
Operating profit 11.9 9.0
Umeco Composites provides a broad range
of advanced composite materials and
specialist chemical products principally to
the aerospace, motorsport & automotive
and wind energy markets. A full range of
value-added outsourcing services is
provided to major customers.
Revenue increased in the period by 
29 per cent, or 21 per cent on an
underlying basis, with all businesses
delivering good growth.
Operating profits rose by 32 per cent, or 
26 per cent on an underlying basis.
This significant growth in revenue and
profits reflects the increasing use of
advanced composite materials in a
number of markets including aerospace,
automotive and wind energy, and the
recovery in the civil aerospace market.
ACG had a very successful year in both the
UK and US, with an increase in revenues of
over 22 per cent on an annualised basis. 
Its closing order book at the end of March
was £15.1 million, a year-on-year increase 
of £7.3 million. Profits were strongly ahead
as a result of operational gearing. The
business was able to pass on most of the
higher raw material prices that arose during
the year as a result of the growing shortage
of certain grades of carbon fibre. ACG was
able to maintain deliveries to existing
customers whilst new business opportunities
were selectively secured in order to ensure
the highest level of customer service.
Chief Executive’s Review
“Growth in revenue
and profits reflects 
the increasing use of
advanced composite
materials”

The major capital expenditure programme
to expand the capacity of ACG’s UK facility
is drawing to a successful close and comes
on stream this summer. The new facility
will comprise an enlarged composites
manufacturing and technology centre,
incorporating an extensive technical
support resource together with new resin
mixing and prepreg manufacturing
capabilities. This will enable further
revenue growth as the business was
becoming capacity constrained.
In the US, ACG has been successful in
securing a number of long term aerospace
material supply contracts with customers
including Columbia Aircraft and Scaled
Composites. Additional production capacity
is planned for the current year.
Umeco Composites’ vacuum bagging
businesses, Aerovac and Richmond,
continued to deliver high levels of revenue
and profit growth during the year. Demand
was particularly strong in the wind energy
market and a number of new contracts
were secured for materials that were
developed in house for this rapidly growing
market. Richmond enjoyed a higher level of
business with Boeing and its main partners
and is working closely with them on a
number of elements of the very important
787 programme. Aerovac France delivered
an excellent result following the
management changes made in 2004.
Umeco Composites’ aerospace chemical
distribution businesses had a solid year
reflecting the recovery in the civil aerospace
market and a number of new contract wins.
GRPMS gained UK market share in the 
year and has successfully integrated the
Scandinavian business acquired from
Ashland Composite Polymers in July 2005. 
A number of new products were
introduced during the year in both
territories.

Umeco Repair & Overhaul
2006 2005
£ million £ million
Revenue 20.4 17.8
Operating profit 2.4 1.8
Umeco Repair & Overhaul now comprises
three businesses; AEM, one of the largest
independent component repair & overhaul
facilities in Europe, Avionics Mobile
Services (‘ AMS’), which installs and
overhauls avionic equipment, and
Aeromedic Innovations which supplies 
and maintains on-board medical kits and
therapeutic oxygen equipment principally
to airlines. Aviation Windings, acquired in
late August 2005, has been integrated
with AEM, as will Aeromedic Innovations
during 2006.
Revenue increased in the period by 
15 per cent, or 1 per cent on an underlying
basis. Operating profits rose by 33 per cent
but fell 10 per cent on an underlying basis.
AEM had a slow start to the year and 
took steps to reduce its cost base and win
new business; these actions both proved
positive. Aviation Windings traded in line
with post acquisition expectations and
was successfully integrated into AEM. The
business will benefit from the new A380
contract secured with Thales in late 2005
and plans are in place to relocate Aviation
Windings to new premises which will
provide the capacity to meet our expected
growth from both existing and new
customers. Aeromedic Innovations has
traded ahead of initial expectations 
and was successful in winning a major
contract extension with British Airways 
in June 2006.
AMS had a strong close to the year due 
to the timing of major orders and the
availability of customers’ aircraft. During the
year AMS acquired the freehold property
from which it operates in St. Albans.
Summary
2006 was a very encouraging year for
Umeco. In the last two financial years, 
we delivered high growth in underlying
revenues and profits, and our goal is to do
so again in the current financial year. This
underlying growth will be enhanced by the
full year effect of the businesses we have
recently acquired, the new contracts we
have secured and the additional capacity
investments we have made.
During the year our order intake continued
to rise and exceeded revenue by 11 per
cent. At the end of March 2006 Umeco’s
order book stood at £143.8 million 
(2005: £120.7 million); this is based 
on customer requirements over the 
ensuing year.
Orders for new civil aircraft won by Airbus
and Boeing reached a record net level in
2005 at 2,057 (2004: 642). The result is a
substantial increase in their build rates
and we expect this favourable situation 
to continue for the medium term.
Chief Executive’s Review 
“ Acquisitions
performed ahead 
of our initial
expectations”
25607 FRONT SECTION  15/6/06  10:44 pm  Page 12 annual report 2006 13
US defence spending remains at a high
level and the development stage of the
Joint Strike Fighter continues to add to 
our revenue stream.
Demand for our broad range of composite
materials is expected to be high as the
advantages of these materials become
more widely accepted across a number 
of market segments, and as additional
aerospace qualifications are secured. The
major and on-going investment in the
advanced composites market is delivering
excellent returns, and will enable us to
continue to develop new business and
maintain high levels of customer service,
despite a shortage of some key raw
materials.
The recently announced acquisition of
South African based Aerodyne Advanced
Composites, which has a contract in
relation to the sole supply of specified
component parts to the Mercedes-Benz 
SLR McLaren super sports car, further
strengthens the Group’s relationship with
McLaren Automotive.
We continue to develop our capability to
service current and prospective customers
in China and the Far East and are looking
forward to our new facility in Xi’an coming
on stream during the summer.
Our focus for the current year is to continue
to develop the Group in a disciplined manner,
driving further growth from our existing
activities and seeking suitable bolt-on
acquisitions. The Group’s financial position
is strong, and a number of interesting
opportunities are under consideration.
However businesses will only be acquired if
we are convinced that they will improve the
overall performance of the Group.

comprehensive rebranding exercise over
the next six months. The exercise will
allow us to enhance our visibility and
reputation across our growing, global
customer base whilst retaining the
essential goodwill in the Umeco brand
that we have developed over the past
years. Examples of our new brand identity
are contained in this report and will be
extensively used at our presence at the
Farnborough Air Show in July.
In parallel with this rebranding exercise
the senior management team has taken
the opportunity to define our core values.
These are the principles on which our
success has been based in recent years 
and they are set out on page 2 of this

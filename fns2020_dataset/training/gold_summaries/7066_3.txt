Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
“ Our India focused strategy has 
produced five gas discoveries 
from nine exploration wells over 
the past three years.”
 Paul Mortimer, Chairman
Corporate Overview
2009 was an important year for Hardy as we continued 
our exploration programme on the Company’s  
portfolio in the Krishna Godavari Basin. As a result  
of our activity, we were delighted to announce the  
third consecutive gas discovery in the D3 block.  
We also began our four well exploration drilling 
campaign in the D9 block. 
The first well was plugged and 
abandoned and the data is currently 
being integrated into the D9 
geological model to optimise selection 
of future drilling locations. Despite 
challenging market conditions, the 
Company was successful in raising 
$15 million in equity through a placing 
in 2009. The placing is testimony to 
the significant growth potential our 
asset portfolio offers and highlights 
the continued support of our core 
shareholder base.
India remains a rapid growth story  
and the demand for energy continues 
to be robust, mirroring the country’s 
significant economic growth. Hardy 
has a clear objective of creating 
significant shareholder value through 
an India focused exploration and 
development strategy.
Our India focused strategy has 
produced five gas discoveries from 
nine exploration wells over the past 
three years. We expect to drill a further 
five exploration wells by the end of the 
first half of 2011 and we continue to 
believe that our existing exploration 
portfolio in the Krishna Godavari  
Basin and other basins in India offer 
significant organic growth potential  
for the Company.
Key Results
As a result of the reduction in global 
oil prices and an extended shut-in of 
our PY-3 field, the Company recorded 
a 56 per cent reduction in gross 
revenue and as a result Hardy 
recorded a net loss of $6.5 million 
compared to net income of $7.5 
million in 2008. Net income for 2008 
included an after tax gain on the sale 
of investment of $8.9 million. The 
Company’s fully diluted loss per share 
was $0.10 compared to fully diluted 
earnings per share of $0.11 in 2008.
The Company’s capital expenditures 
amounted to $13.6 million which was 
principally on the drilling of one 
development well, two exploration 
wells, the acquisition of seismic data 
and the pre-drilling of a well on D3. 
The Company ended 2009 with $30.5 
million in cash and short-term 
investments and no long-term debt.
Management Change
Effective 31 March 2010, Sastry Karra 
relinquished his position as Chief 
Executive and now maintains an 
ongoing involvement with the 
Company as a Non-Executive Director. 
Yogeshwar Sharma, former Chief 
Operating Officer, has succeeded 
Sastry Karra as Chief Executive Officer.
We would like to thank Sastry for his 
tireless work over the past 12 years  
as Chief Executive. It was Sastry’s 
vision that has placed Hardy in the 
prospective position it is today. The 
management is determined to fulfil the 
potential of that vision.
Corporate Governance
Following an appraisal of the Board  
and its members in 2009, the Board 
considers that its current structure, 
competencies and remuneration policies 
are appropriate for a publicly listed, early 
stage, oil and gas exploration company. 
As such we did not undertake any 
material changes in 2009. 
Your Board is aware that there are 
areas where the make-up of the Board 
does not meet the full requirements of 
the combined code. The Chairman 
and the Chairman of the remuneration 
committee have held discussions with 
shareholders and with organisations 
providing services to shareholders on 
these issues.
One issue concerns stock options 
held by Dr Bell, and Messrs Mortimer 
and Shah. These are legacy options 
that were granted at the time the 
Company was listed on the AIM 
market and were considered 
appropriate. A new remuneration 
policy for Directors has since been 
adopted and no new options will be 
granted to Non-Executive Directors.
Another issue of concern is that 
Messrs Shah and Mortimer have been 
Directors for more than nine years. 
Both are considered by the Board to 
be fiercely independent and both are 
vigorous contributors to Hardy’s 
direction. The Indian relationships, the 
knowledge of India and the knowledge 
Chairman’s Statement 07
Hardy Oil and Gas plc  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
of the Oil and Gas Industry in India 
that Mr Shah brings to the Board 
would be difficult to replace. We 
would like to have him continue as a 
Director during this critical phase of 
the Company’s development.
It is the Board’s judgement that, at this 
time, when a small company is 
marshalling its resources to support 
an exciting and company building 
exploration programme, it is not the 
time to use resources on a major 
restructuring of the Board. We are 
aware of our lack of compliance with 
the combined code in this area and 
intend to move toward addressing 
them at a pace appropriate to the 
development of the Company’s  
available resources.
Risk Management
Risk management will continue to be a 
key focus of the Board in 2010. Given 
the Company’s objective of creating 
significant shareholder value, we  
have chosen an exploration focused 
strategy. Exploration is intrinsically  
very uncertain and whilst substantial 
improvements in predictive/
interpretation technology have 
reduced this uncertainty, it cannot  
be eliminated.
Despite the global downturn, demand 
for upstream oil and gas equipment 
has remained robust and we continue 
to operate in a relatively high-cost 
environment which magnifies the 
financial impact of operational delays 
during drilling and other operations.
A number of our exploration licences 
are being held under appraisal and  
our continued interest in such blocks  
are contingent on establishing 
commerciality. A decision on the 
commerciality of Dhirubhai 33 gas 
discovery (GS-01) is anticipated  
this year.
With respect to Hardy’s Ganesha 
(CY-OS/2) non-associated natural gas 
discovery, the Company has presented 
a case to the Directorate General of 
Hydrocarbons for a licence extension. 
In the absence of a resolution in our 
favour in the near future, we intend to 
refer the dispute for sole expert or 
conciliation and arbitration.
Auditor’s Report
The auditors have provided an 
emphasis of matter comment in their 
audit report with reference to the 
uncertainty concerning the Group’s 
request for an extension of its 
exploration licence in block CY-OS/2 
as disclosed in notes 2 and 17 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Outlook
We continue to strive to create 
significant shareholder value by 
focusing on high impact exploration  
in India. The year 2010 should prove  
to be crucial in the realisation of our 
vision for Hardy. We expect to drill five 
further exploration wells in the Krishna 
Godavari Basin by the end of the first 
half of 2011, which will complete the 
phase one minimum work programmes 
for the D3 and D9 exploration blocks. 
Corporate
Having regard to the Company’s 
existing working capital position and 
its ability to raise potential financing, 
the Directors are of the opinion that 
the Group has adequate resources to 
enable it to undertake its planned work 
programme of exploration, appraisal 
and development activities over the 
next 12 months.
The Board remains committed to its 
India focused strategy. In the near 
term, Hardy’s Krishna Godavari Basin 
assets remain the primary focus of our 
exploration programme. The recent D3 
Dhirubhai 44 gas discovery in the 
Miocene has proven a substantial 
geological fairway. We view D3 with 
considerable optimism and believe 
that 2010 will be an important year  
in Hardy’s development. We remain 
optimistic about the potential of D9 
and look forward to re-commencing 
the exploration drilling programme. 
The Company is well positioned to  
see itself through its key exploration 
activities in 2010.

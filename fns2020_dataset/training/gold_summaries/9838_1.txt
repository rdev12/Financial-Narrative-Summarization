CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
BUSINESS REVIEW
Continuing to 
make progress
Our vision
Our vision is to be a leading 
international recruitment 
group within the engineering 
and professional services 
sectors.
Our goal
Our goal is to ‘always exceed 
the expectations of our 
customers and lead the 
recruitment sector through 
effective delivery and 
quality of service.’
Chief Executive’s Review 
Performance Overview 
The Group has continued to bene t 
from the substantial reorganisation and 
investment for growth made over the 
past two years. In particular, our contract 
recruitment business, which accounts for 
around two thirds of net fee income (NFI), 
performed ahead of our expectations, 
throughout the year with growth being 
driven by strong demand for contractors in 
our traditional niches of engineering and 
technology and by the understandable 
attractions of exible labour during an 
economic downturn. 
This year we have enhanced the 
performance of the business through 
further investment in our professional 
services brands additional sales personnel, 
and faster more e cient IT systems. 
Our improvements make us well-placed 
to handle signi cantly higher volumes 
of business. 
The Group has once again delivered a 
creditable performance with NFI growth 
of 21% on the previous year, contributing 
to a 25% increase in pro t before tax. The 
mix between contract NFI and permanent 
fees remained the same as the previous 
year at 68%:32%. 
Contractor numbers continue to increase. 
At 31 July 2012 there were 6,700 
contractors, an increase of 12% on the 
previous year, and up 3% on 31 January 
2012. Contract margins stabilised at 6.6% 
for the full year 2012. 
The increased number of contractors 
re ected continuing strong demand for 
contract sta in our main sectors, driven 
mostly by existing clients working on 
global, multi-year programmes. Growth 
also stemmed from supplying contractors 
to major UK infrastructure projects in the 
marine, rail and water sectors.
Greatly assisted by the brands in 
professional services, permanent fees rose 
by 22% compared with the previous year, 
with average placement fees essentially 
stable throughout each quarter of 2012. 
However, we have seen clients extending 
the typical time to hire. 
Business Plan 
The Group’s success has been built on 
a core strategy of attracting the best 
candidates (see pages 4 and 5). We 
believe that by nding strong candidates 
and making their interests central to our 
success, we will ensure that our clients 
are supplied with the right people, at 
the right time, for the right roles. By 
understanding the requirements of our 
clients, and by knowing our candidates 
thoroughly, we deliver by being able to 
scan, screen, shortlist and present our 
candidates more e ectively and quicker 
than our competitors.
We have now completed the rst year of 
our 5 year business plan and have made 
encouraging progress against our 7 Key 
Aims, set out below, which are absolutely 
integral to the business, and which provide 
the framework for delivering growth.    Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 11
BUSINESS REVIEW
As a result of working for many global businesses 
we have, in the last 12 months, supplied candidates 
to 25 di erent countries, lling roles for highly 
skilled engineering positions that demand some 
of the industry’s most able and talented candidates.
Currently, our German operation in Stuttgart is the Group’s 
only in-country overseas o ce. All other countries are served 
directly from the UK, via a network of well-established 
a liate relationships. 
Working from the UK has not restricted our ability to 
supply contractors to some major overseas programmes. 
For example, we have over 40 contractors placed in 
Kazakhstan on a major oil and gas project. 
We have just started working in China supplying design 
engineers to the aerospace industry. We are working with 
a locally-based partner to ful l this recent contract. 
 
Looking ahead, we anticipate that in the medium term the 
Group’s international expansion will be supplied largely 
from the UK, supplemented by a small number of additional 
in-country o ces. Operating in Germany has taught us 
the importance of adapting our model to t the country’s 
requirements. We are currently exploring selective new 
locations for new country o ces, focusing on fast-growing 
emerging markets and those where we can bene t from 
existing client relationships. 
Extending our 
international reach
CASE STUDY
1. Expanding our sector diversi cation 
and geographical reach by building 
on our early successes and looking at 
opportunities to grow into new sectors 
and additional strategic locations within 
the UK. 
2. Increasing the NFI we generate per 
employee by focusing on developing 
existing client relationships and 
winning new business outside the 
engineering sector. 
3. Building our conversion ratio of 
NFI to pro t from operations as our 
investments mature, continuing the 
Group’s ability to generate high levels 
of return from NFI. 
4. Enhancing internal systems’ 
performance and controls to deliver an 
even faster, more e cient and robust 
service to our clients and candidates. 
5. Improving our sta retention levels by 
continuing to look at sta engagement 
and providing career opportunities. 
This is a key factor in determining 
how fast the Group can grow. 
6. Maximising cross-selling opportunities 
across the Group by utilising the 
increasingly varied client base being 
created with our expanding brands. 
7. Extending our international reach by 
developing a structured rollout of 
international opportunities.

on how we are progressing against each 
of these Key Aims, on pages 6 and 7.   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 12

BUSINESS REVIEW
Strategic Developments 
In January 2012, the Group acquired 
certain assets of Xchanging Resources 
Services Limited (XRS), the contingency 
recruitment arm of Xchanging plc. The 
assets have quickly been integrated into 
the Group giving us greater access to its 
client base. This will increase our scope to 
expand into new Technology markets and 
helps us forge even closer links with one 
of our largest clients.
In June 2012, Matchtech met an important 
Group goal by signing its rst framework 
agreement with a strategic partner in 
China. This contract is for design engineers 
for the rapidly expanding Chinese 
aerospace industry. 
Management and Staff 
I wish to thank sta and management for 
another year in which they have applied 
hard work, resourcefulness and creativity 
to produce a strong nancial performance. 
It is a privilege to lead a business that is 
full of intelligent and talented individuals 
whom I believe serve our clients and 
candidates so well. 
Our nancial success is built on both 
the service ethos we cultivate and guard 
closely and from our culture which allies 
entrepreneurial air to strong relationship 
management. 
All of the Group’s sta work towards one 
common set of values: Teamwork, Integrity, 
Enthusiasm, Innovation, and Fun. We 
are also united behind our 7 Key Aims, 
which provide an excellent framework 
for delivering further growth. 
As a people business we also understand 
the importance of personal development. 
This is why we have continued to invest in 
developing our sta , including supporting 
them with considerably improved IT 
systems and shared services functions. 
I would like to add my congratulations to 
those of the Chairman to Keith Lewis on his 
promotion to the Board.
Divisional Performance
Matchtech UK operates in 4 key 
sectors: Engineering, Built Environment, 
Information Systems & Technology and 
Science & Medical. This was a record year 
for Matchtech UK with unprecedented 
demand for contract sta in its markets, 
and a record number of contractors on 
assignment. Matchtech UK contractor 
numbers grew from 5,250 at the start 
of the year to 5,850 at the year end. 
Engineering, the largest sector in 
Matchtech UK representing 44% of 
NFI, performed well again in 2012. NFI 
increased by 19% on the previous year, 
with strong demand across all areas, 
particularly in the Civil Aerospace, 
Automotive and Marine sectors. 
Built Environment, grew contractor 
numbers by 8% to 1,400, and produced 
NFI growth of 9%, which came primarily 
from Water and Rail infrastructure projects. 
Information Systems & Technology saw 
NFI grow by 26% on the previous full year. 
Growth was aided by the convergence 
of technology in Electronic Systems and 
Business Applications, which play to our 
strengths in niche service delivery.
Science & Medical grew steadily with NFI 
up 11% on 2011. 
elemense, our Managed Services business, 
provides account management support 
for key clients, which indirectly generates 
revenue for the Group.
elemense plays an important role in 
client retention by ensuring key contracts 
are constantly monitored and Service 
Level Agreements are delivered. The 
client handling skills are essential in 
fostering strong client relationships and 
have provided many new business leads 
in permanent recruitment across the Group.
Chief Executive’s Review continued
In the Chairman’s statement, he announced that 
the Board has proposed the same level of dividend 
as last year. It is a testament to the financial 
strength of the business that has allowed us to 
maintain the same level of dividend since 2008 
throughout the unstable economic times of the 
last few years.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Group’s revenue for the year was 
£371.4m, up 23% (2011: £301.8m), growth 
which reflects the strength of our core 
engineering and technology markets within 
the UK economy. Our niche market focus and 
delivery capability allow us to continue to 
take market share.
The Group generated £36.1m of NFI for the 
year up 21% (2011: £29.8m) with strong 
performance across the Group. Contract 
NFI was up 21% to £24.6m (2011: £20.4m) 
and permanent fees rose by 22% to £11.5m 
(2011: £9.4m) fuelled by our investments 
in professional services.   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 13

Pro t from operations
Having now completed the initial investment 
phase to diversify, broaden and internationalise 
our services, one of our most important goals is  
to restore the Group’s historically strong levels  
of NFI conversion to pro t from operations. 
One way is by developing our sta to increase 
each individual’s NFI.
This year we have also introduced a graduate training 
programme in Professional Services. We plan to turn new 
graduates into high ying professionals, ultimately able 
to produce some of the best NFI per head in our industry.
The changes we have made this year and last have increased 
the speed and functionality of our internal systems, allowing 
us to process candidates more e ciently. Our proprietary 
database and CRM technology, in which we have invested 
considerable time, gives us a strong competitive advantage 
in quickly processing new candidates and in managing 
client and candidate relationships. We will continue to 
enhance our systems via our in-house team of 8 full time 
technology developers. 
Also, by using shared services more e ciently across the 
Group, we will continue to increase NFI and lift operating 
pro t. Furthermore, we will constantly examine xed 
overheads and seek to make more savings where applicable, 
again improving the conversion ratio of NFI to pro t 
from operations.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
NFI conversion in the year improved 
marginally to 24% (2011: 23%). The lack 
of progress was due to the full year effect 
of the previous years’ increase in headcount 
which resulted in a 20% increase in 
overheads to £27.4m (2011: £22.9m). 
Profit from operations increased by 28% 
to £8.7m (2011: £6.8m) showing a return 
to growth as we start to benefit from the 
diversification strategy and investments  
we have made.   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 14

BUSINESS REVIEW
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Matchtech Germany, a business which 
we opened in 2009, targets the Aerospace, 
Automotive and Energy sectors. Trading 
in Germany continues to gain momentum 
with NFI up 50% to £0.9m, achieving some 
excellent business development wins, 
despite growth being restricted by the 
shortage of available candidates. The loss 
before tax increased to £0.4m (2011: £0.1m).
A key challenge, therefore, is to attract 
more quali ed engineers for the German 
market, which is where our focus lies 
in the year ahead. As part of this e ort 
we re-launched our German website to 
have the ‘look and feel’ of an engineering 
consultancy, which is a much better t with 
the German labour leasing business model. 
The Professional Services brands, 
Barclay Meade and Alderwood continue 
to make progress.
Barclay Meade focuses on Finance & 
Accountancy, Marketing, Procurement 
& Supply Chain, HR and Sales. Alderwood 
focuses on the Skills and Employability 
markets. Setting up these 2 new 
professional Services brands, and 
establishing them rmly in their 
marketplace, has been an important 
stepindiversifying the business.
Barclay Meade continues to develop 
well, and has established good brand 
recognition in the permanent SME market, 
and is working with approximately 300, 
mainly medium sized, client companies. 
We intend to scale up the business by 
recruiting more graduate consultants,  
who will be guided and mentored by  
more experienced colleagues, which  
will enable Barclay Meade to continue 
togrow market share, while improving 
itsoperating margins. 
For its size and relative youth of the brand, 
Alderwood has exceeded expectations in 
the Welfare to Work market, working for 8 
of the 12 main providers. It has also made 
good headway in the Work-Based Learning 
market, providing assessors for National 
Vocational Quali cations (NVQs). Looking 
forward, we expect to increase placements 
in both sectors.
New reporting structure
In order to improve stakeholders’ 
understanding of the Group as it continues 
to diversify, we will be introducing a 
simpli ed reporting structure for the 
 nancial year to 31 July 2013. The business 
will be managed into 2 distinct segments, 
Engineering and Professional Services. 
The Engineering segment will operate 
under the Matchtech brand and will be led 
by Keith Lewis. It will include Matchtech 
Germany and also elemense, the Managed 
Services business, which supports 
Matchtech’s large framework agreements.
The Professional Services segment will 
comprise the existing Barclay Meade 
and Alderwood brands, along with the 
Information Systems & Technology sector, 
which was previously within Matchtech. 
This latter sector is more aligned with the 
Professional Services businesses where its 
pro le bears a closer t and opportunities 
for cross-selling will be greater.
An indicative representation of the 
 nancial performance this new structure 
can be found in Note 2 of the nancial 
statements on page 56.
The clarity that this new structure provides 
will allow us to maximise opportunities 
across the Group and I look forward to 
giving shareholders an initial update  
on progress with the interim results 
in April 2013.

This year we have enhanced our Links Programme 
to create greater focus on a select list of key 
clients and opportunities. First launched in 2009, 
the aim of Links is to bring together the teams 
within the Group to help increase and maximise 
our activity with key clients.
By mapping the structure of key clients and the services we 
were providing, we were able to identify clients with which 
we had solid trading but where there was also signi cant 
growth potential. In addition we were able to introduce 
new service o erings that were not previously provided.
In the last 12 months we have seen a threefold increase in 
the number of internal delivery teams invoicing Links clients 
compared with the previous year. In this nancial year Links 
clients have delivered 55% of the Group’s NFI growth. 
Links provides a platform for collaboration across the Group. 
It places responsibility on management for the strategic 
development of each client, whilst bringing together 
consistent service delivery.

Operating cash conversion was 106% (2011: 
-72%) for the year. Strong cash collection 
resulted in an improvement in debtor days 
which has generated cash despite increased 
working capital requirements.
The Board is recommending to maintain 
an unchanged final dividend of 10.6 pence 
per share (2011: 10.6 pence) reflecting the 
Group’s strong performance during the year. 
The total dividend for the year was 15.6 
pence per share (2011: 15.6 pence) which 
included the interim dividend paid in June 
of 5 pence per share (2011: 5 pence).

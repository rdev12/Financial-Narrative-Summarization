Business review
Chairman’s
statement
Since 1 January 2011 we have 
moved from being a non-operated 
partner having equity interests in 
CBM licences under appraisal, to 
delivering material hydrocarbon 
production, having full control (as 
operator) and ownership (100%  
in most cases) of our assets and 
having early indications of 
signiﬁcant shale resource 
potential.
The potential of IGas as a dedicated upstream 
oil and gas company to contribute to the energy 
security of the country has become very much 
more significant. With our current production 
and potentially enormous unconventional 
resources we are set to be a material part of 
Britain’s energy mix going forward. The 
comments by the chancellor in the budget 
regarding the importance of gas, by the Prime 
Minister regarding investigating shale (in a safe 
manner) and the anticipated agreement by 
DECC, after an independent review and public 
consultation into the resumption of hydraulic 
fraccing of shale, show the renewed commitment 
of the government to developing a gas based 
strategy to augment other forms of generation. 
This strategy is of course in the context of ensuring 
that domestic resources are fully utilised in a 
safe and environmentally responsible way; to 
which we too are fully committed.
Through the two acquisitions made in 201 1, the 
first in March of Nexen Exploration UK Limited 
and then in December of Star Energy Group 
Limited, we have transformed our Company into 
being the largest operator of oil and gas fields 
onshore Britain. In financing these transactions 
we have strengthened our shareholder base 
with Nexen now holding 25% of IGas’ equity. 
We have also raised more than £100 million of 
long-term debt and equity, to finance these 
transactions and our operations during the 
period. The Company’s healthy production, has 
enabled debt of £7 .6m to have been repaid in 
the period from drawdown to 30 June 2012, 
with an anticipated further debt principal 
repayment of £12.0m by 31 March 2013, a 
deleveraging of nearly 25%. Looking forward, 
in addition to healthy production, the coming 
year should see us starting to realise the 
synergies made available to us from last year’s 
acquisitions, designed to help unlock the 
Company’s very considerable resource potential. 
In this regard the announced plan to farm-out 
some of IGas’ shale acreage, subject always to 
the terms being attractive for the Company and 
thereby shareholders, should be another 
important milestone.
With 152 employees at the year end, their health, 
safety and well-being are of upmost importance 
to the Board. We are pleased to report that we 
have now had more than a year with no lost 
time incidents.
Finally, I would like to welcome all of the former 
employees of Star Energy to IGas. Together, and 
focused on onshore energy, we are delivering a 
secure future.

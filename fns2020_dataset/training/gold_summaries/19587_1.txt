Chief Executive’s Statement
2015 PERFORMANCE
Having been adversely affected by weak trading 
conditions in Mainland Europe and the UK RMi market,  
together with a significant deterioration in the Euro, we 
were disappointed in the Group’s 2015 performance.
Group sales from continuing operations increased by 
3.7% in constant currency but were down 1.4% in 
Sterling. With acquisitions contributing 3.4% to revenue 
growth, on a like-for-like (“LFL”) basis, sales were 
marginally ahead, by 0.3%.
Underlying profit before tax decreased by 11.8% to 
£87.4m (2014: £99.1m), although on a constant currency 
basis was only down by 7.0%. 
We continue to make good progress on our Strategic 
initiatives to improve business performance, delivering 
an incremental net benefit after costs of £12.6m in 2015, 
mainly sourced from procurement. 
SiG’s post-tax Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”), our 
key financial metric, decreased by 110bps to 9.3% (2014: 
10.4%) in 2015 mainly due to weaker trading conditions. 
Going forward SiG remains committed to increasing 
its returns on capital. As well as taking a disciplined 
approach to its capital management, SiG seeks to achieve 
this target through further improvements in its gross and 
operating margins.
STRONGER TOGETHER
Historically SiG’s businesses have tended to operate 
independently of one another, like a loose federation. in 
addition, following a period of underspend during the 
economic downturn, we also needed to reinvest in our 
asset base and people.
To address these challenges, and improve the way we 
work, two years ago the Group launched its Stronger 
Together culture change programme with the aim of  
making SiG’s whole greater than the sum of the parts. 
This programme also underpins the delivery of our Strategic 
initiatives to improve business performance where we have 
targeted £30m of net savings to be achieved by 2016. 
By working together more and better leveraging our 
buying power and Group synergies, we have delivered a 
total cumulative net saving of £22.7m from the Strategic 
initiatives since the programme began, and are well ahead 
of our original schedule. 
However, there is more to do and we are targeting to 
achieve at least another £10m incremental net benefit 
from the Strategic initiatives in 2016.
OUTLOOK
This year the Group continues to expect good growth in 
the UK new build construction market, primarily driven 
by the residential segment. Lead indicators also suggest 
that demand should pick up in the UK RMi sector as 2016 
progresses.   
in Mainland Europe, while the trajectory of any recovery at 
this stage remains uncertain, trading conditions in France 
have improved, with the housing market stabilising and a 
return to growth for SiG in Q4 2015.   
Following an encouraging start to the year, with positive 
LFLs in both the UK & ireland and Mainland Europe, the 
scope for further cost savings and growth opportunities 
within the Group mean that it expects to make progress in 
2016.

 Substantial growth with 
careful cash management. 
Cash reserves of £11.0 
million, well placed to reach 
profitability and cash 
generation without further 
funding.
Each of the Group’s businesses has launched its products and is 
at the point of revenue generation. Genlec has established 
commercial terms with Daalderop BV, Pnu Power has received 
orders from Africa, Europe and America, and VPhase is working 
closely with SSE and has a memorandum of understanding with 
British Gas. We have increased our understanding of the routes to 
market and the timescales involved in new product adoption and 
are confident in the Group’s ability to grow revenues during 2009.
Revenues of £32,000 were achieved during the year (2007: 
£55,000) arising from the sale of trial units and the business has 
continued to invest in its infrastructure and intellectual property. 
The Group’s cash position remains strong with £11.0 million in 
hand providing a solid financial base for future operations.
In response to the poor external economic conditions that 
occurred during 2008, at the beginning of 2009 the business 
restructured its operations under Neil Bright who was appointed 
to the Group Board as Operations Director on 22 January 2009. 
This has resulted in the merger of management roles between 
Genlec and Pnu Power and the consolidation of some activities 
into the central services function, enabling the Group to make 
operational savings of c.£45,000 per month. Also in January 
2009, Anton Elsborg resigned from the Board following six years’ 
involvement with the Group. I would like to thank Anton for his 
contribution over that time.

I am delighted by the substantial progress the Group has made 
against the targets we had set for each of our subsidiaries for the 
year. Our careful cash management during 2008 leaves us with 
strong cash reserves of £11.0 million at the year end. This position 
is an excellent base from which to deliver our 2009 goals of cash 
conservation and revenue generation.
During 2008, the Group focussed on building the business 
platform and launching its products in preparation for revenue 
generation. The Group has continued to make significant progress 
against these targets. Whilst the economic uncertainty that 
characterised the end of 2008 looks set to continue, I believe that 
Energetix Group is well placed to withstand these effects with 
sufficient cash for all three businesses to reach profitability and 
cash generation.

 06 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013
Chairman’ s statement
As I write, we have just agreed a recommended offer 
for Foster Wheeler AG, the international engineering, 
construction and project management contractor and power 
equipment supplier . Y our board believes the combination 
of AMEC and Foster Wheeler would be compelling for all 
shareholders. I will talk more about this later . 
First let me address the progress we have made in 
other areas. 
The board
Let me start by commenting on our board. 
The ultimate goal of your board is to collectively and 
effectively lead the company in delivering long-term 
sustainable success for the benefit of all of our shareholders. 
The right mix of individuals is needed to achieve this, each 
with the relevant experience, skills and determination to 
take the company forward. Importantly , the board should 
reflect the diversity of the organisation.
Our board objectives for 2013 included discussing our 
policy on diversity and any measurable objectives we 
wish to set to track progress. After a wide-ranging review 
of what diversity means within AMEC and an engaged 
discussion on the conclusions at board level, a group-wide 
commitment to diversity and inclusion has been 
implemented. Diversity includes the range of human 
differences that make us individual and who we are: 
inclusion is about us valuing and using the differences 
between us. The implementation of this commitment 
includes measurement and monitoring of progress 
on diversity and inclusion activities.
2014 will see changes on our board, with Tim Faithfull, 
our Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the 
remuneration committee, standing down at our next AGM. 
Tim has supported AMEC through a period of significant 
and successful change and I have personally valued his 
advice and support. On behalf of us all, I would like to thank 
him for his contribution. 
Simon Thompson will take over from Tim as Senior 
Independent Director and Chairman of the remuneration 
committee, with Linda Adamany becoming Chairman of 
the ethics committee. We have appointed an independent 
search company , The Zygos Partnership, to identify new 
board talent with the appropriate skills and experience to 
contribute to our future success.
Our customers rely on our professionalism and expertise 
in delivering their projects. Y our board saw this first hand in 
2013, in Canada. We gained a greater understanding of the 
scale and complexity of our projects in the oil sands and of 
the sustainable approach AMEC brings. We also saw how 
seriously the company takes its community responsibilities, 
with employees quickly rallying to support those affected 
by the floods sweeping through Calgary . These visits are 
invaluable in ensuring the board is connected to the 
business it serves. 
Board priorities
I have spoken previously about how the board should support 
the successful, sustainable growth of your company .
Firstly , we should debate and agree the strategy the 
company is to follow – and then monitor performance 
against the strategic goals. As we move closer to the end 
point of AMEC’ s Vision 2015 growth strategy , board 
discussions have increasingly turned to how we achieve 
success beyond 2015. Our geographic organisational 
structure was introduced late in 2012, in support of our 
longer-term objectives, and has gained real traction during 
2013. The organisation is collaborating better and creating 
 Y our company has in place 
a strong, highly competent board 
that performs well.”

new opportunities for growth, despite the headwinds 
in some of our markets. Y our board has challenged and 
supported management in their acquisition aspirations, 
confident in the financial discipline they display . 
Secondly , we must ensure the company has the right 
people in place to deliver its targets, now and for the future. 
Remuneration remains a key part of our people plan and 
our remuneration report shows how we link short and 
long-term incentives to hard measures of improvement in 
the company’s performance, in line with the strategy – see 
page 60. Separately , we also maintain regular interaction 
with the senior management of the company , including 
Simon Naylor and John Pearson, Group Presidents of 
Americas and Europe respectively .
Finally , there must be an appropriate level of governance 
in place, a topic I elaborate on later , on page 47. As I flagged 
last year , during 2013 we launched our updated and 
simplified global mandatory policies and procedures. 
These are now easier to understand and so comply with. 
Almost 21,000 of our employees completed our new 
anti-bribery and corruption training, launched in the 
autumn. Good governance needs to inform the decisions 
our employees take every day . I talk to our employees 
on a regular basis and so see how seriously we take 
our commitment to safety , how involved we are with 
our communities and how hard we work to win repeat 
business from our customers. For the tenth year in 
succession we were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Index, which suggests others also recognise the work we 
do and the way in which we do it.
Performance and shareholder returns
Despite downturn in some of our markets, and as 
reported in more detail in the Chief Executive’s review 
and elsewhere, our company saw underlying revenues
1
 
excluding incremental procurement broadly flat and 
achieved growth in earnings per share
2
 of 11 per cent 
in 2013. We expect further growth in 2014.
As a result of our confidence in the outlook, and reflecting 
our strong cash generation, the board is recommending 
a final dividend of 28.5 pence per share. This makes a total 
of 42.0 pence per share for the year , a 15 per cent increase 
over 2012 and a dividend cover of 2.1 times (2012: 2.2 times). 
If approved, it will be paid on 2 July 2014 to those shar eholders 
on the register at 30 May 2014. It is the board’s intention to 
continue with a progressive dividend policy , whether or not 
the Foster Wheeler acquisition goes ahead.
The £400 million share buyback programme which began 
in February 2012 was completed in February 2013.
Recommended offer for Foster Wheeler AG
AMEC has been transformed in recent years and is now 
highly cash generative. Y our board believes the best use 
for this cash is to invest in growth, returning surplus cash 
to shareholders if no suitable opportunities are found. 
On 13 February 2014 we announced the terms of a 
recommended offer for Foster Wheeler . Y ou can find 
the details on page 3. We believe this acquisition would 
accelerate achievement of AMEC’ s growth strategy , by 
expanding our position in mid and downstream oil & gas 
and enhancing our geographic position in our Growth 
Regions. It is also expected to be financially attractive, 
with double digit earnings enhancement expected 
in the first 12 months following completion. 
Under the terms of the offer for Foster Wheeler , two of their 
non-executive directors would be nominated to join our board 
from completion of the transaction. I believe this would 
support a successful integration of our two businesses.
Y our board remains focused on the achievement of 
shareholder value and will remain disciplined in its 
approach to this and any other acquisitions.
In conclusion
I believe the potential combination of Foster Wheeler and 
AMEC makes strategic and financial sense and I expect 
to update you soon on progress. Importantly , I believe we 
have a highly energised and extremely able team at AMEC. 
It is AMEC’ s proven ability to deliver excellence that will 
underpin our future growth, with or without acquisitions. 
On your behalf, I would like to thank Samir Brikho, his 
management team and all of AMEC’ s nearly 29,000 people 
for their hard work and valuable contribution in 2013.

THUS at a Glance
THUS provides telecommunication
solutions to business customers
throughout the UK under the
THUS and Demon brands. During
the past 12 months, we have
increased momentum from new
customer contracts, adding to 
our scale and productivity UK-
wide. Our service innovation is
complemented by full certification
for voice, data, Internet and
contact centres under the
ISO9001:2000 standard, which 
is testament to the people, skills,
application and commitment 
to quality within our business.
Data
Data technology has continued to grow
and develop over the past year and,
within the broad range of data services
we offer , we have seen demand for both
Ethernet and MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label
Switching) services accelerate. Customers
are taking advantage of our true end-
to-end UK-wide Ethernet capabilities and 
we now have more than 2,000 Ethernet
connections in place. These private
Ethernet connections enable our customers,
such as Imperial College London and
Scottish Executive, to link sites across the
UK while operating at the same high
speed as their office network. Ethernet is
becoming one of the most reliable and
cost-effective ways to deliver broadband
applications and services, providing
companies with cost and efficiency savings. 
When we initially designed our MPLS
platform, it was essential that it was built 
to allow us to offer a range of interoperable
technologies in the future and, with the
growth of Ethernet technology, we are
now able to realise this and combine these
services. In 2003 we launched MPLS-
based IP VPN (Internet Protocol Virtual
Private Network) services using Ethernet
as the access technology. This enables 
an organisation to securely link its various
locations – headquarters, offices and
remote users, using cost-effective IP-based
voice services and data connectivity. 
MPLS enables packets of information 
to be transmitted in a particular order and
within a specified timeframe, making it
ideal for the delivery of time sensitive data.
When combined with the simplicity and
affordability of Ethernet access, MPLS IP
VPNs are ideal for corporate voice, data
and Internet communications.
Telecoms
Traditional voice services continue 
to be a key requirement for UK businesses
and companies today are continually
looking to their telecoms suppliers 
to provide them with a flexible range 
of voice services at the same time 
as providing cost efficiencies. One such
customer is Virgin Group which has
chosen THUS as its preferred supplier 
for 200 sites across the UK. We will 
be providing Virgin Group with a range 
of voice services and also providing data
services such as leased lines. Our flexible
approach and specifically designed
package of services is enabling Virgin
Group to reduce its costs across the group
while meeting the differing needs of each
individual business.
The introduction of Carrier Pre-Select (CPS)
voice services last year led to a change 
in the way that traditional voice services
are delivered in the UK. CPS technology
allows customers to bypass the BT 
network and have their calls carried 
by an alternative telecoms supplier without
the need to dial a prefix before each call.
T ele2 was one such company to take
advantage of these changes and launch 
a new consumer voice service in the UK –
it chose THUS to provide the systems 
and routing technology to carry Tele2’s
domestic voice traffic over our national
fibre optic network.
MPLS IP VPN services securely 
link customers’ various locations –
headquarters, branch offices and 
remote users – using cost-effective 
IP-based voice services and data
connectivity. Furthermore, it enables
customers to pick and mix the 
most appropriate technology and
bandwidth at each site, resulting in 
a reduction in total network costs.
Data services have seen some 
of the fastest growth in our portfolio 
of products. Rapid take up of Ethernet
services, launched in the Autumn 
of 2002, has seen more than 2,000
Ethernet circuits provided to corporate
customers, including Baillie Gifford,
TOTAL E&P UK and UHI Millennium
Institute, the higher education institution.
“In THUS we found a like-
minded company committed 
to providing excellent customer 
service and able to move 
quickly to get the job done.”
Jennie Beament, 
Group Procurement Director , 
Virgin Management Ltd
“We chose to work with 
THUS because its innovative 
approach and expertise means 
our customers will get exactly 
the service they demand.” 
Bill Butler , Managing Director , T ele2
“THUS is the first provider of
National Ethernet services on a
UK-wide basis to carry the Cisco
Powered Network designation.
This status helps THUS’ s
customers to understand that 
its services are delivered over 
a reliable, high performance
architecture, designed with
Quality of Service applications 
in mind.”
Duncan Mitchell, Vice President 
and Managing Director , 
UK and Ireland, Cisco Systems 3
Internet
Through our Demon brand, THUS offers
the full range of Internet access services
including email, hosting, e-commerce 
and of course DSL (Digital Subscriber 
Line) technology services which continue
to dominate growth in the Internet sector .
There has been a rapid take up of ADSL
(Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line), 
also known as broadband, with nearly
100,000 customers now using Demon
ADSL products in the UK and the
Netherlands. Broadband offers 
a high bandwidth, low cost alternative 
to dedicated leased lines or the more
traditional dial-up services. Customers 
are being more innovative in their
deployment of broadband and we
recently provided 90 ADSL broadband
connections to Jessops for the rollout 
of Digital Photo Kiosks in its stores. 
These kiosks provide Jessops’ customers
with an easy-to-use and reliable way 
to purchase professionally printed 
digital photographs.
DSL is no longer just a high bandwidth
Internet connection and we have developed
and launched Private Access DSL 
to provide customers with an alternative 
to traditional leased lines and ISDN access
technologies for their virtual private or
wide area networks, providing the same
levels of security at a significantly reduced
cost. In addition, we have worked with
Scottish Borders Rural Broadband Ltd 
to provide wireless broadband connections
for businesses and residents in a number
of rural towns in the Borders region.
Network and quality
Behind all of the products and services 
we offer sits our technologically 
advanced national fibre optic network.
This was designed and built with the
foresight to enable today’ s technologies 
to be seamlessly integrated whilst
continuing to offer superior quality of
service to our customers. We now believe
that, after BT , we offer the best UK-wide
coverage and connectivity from the 
far north of Scotland to the south-east 
of England, compared to any other
alternative carrier in the UK. 
Contact centre services
THUS provides a range of inbound 
and outbound contact centre services 
and was recently awarded the EnergySure
Accreditation for its telemarketing
operations – only the third contact centre
employer in the UK to receive the award.
This means that all THUS employees
selling utility services in our contact 
centres are trained to adhere to best
practice guidelines.
Interactive 
THUS Interactive services create and
provide a range of telephone based
marketing promotions targeted at the
consumer market.
“The broadband Digital Photo 
Kiosks, enabled by THUS, will 
for the first time give the mass 
market the means to get the very 
most from their digital camera.”

Manchester and Edinburgh
Amserve Ltd has renewed our 
contract to provide telecommunications 
services for its Amstrad e-m@iler and 
e-m@ilerplus products until 2009. 
THUS first started working with 
Amstrad in 2001 when it developed 
the platform for the e-m@iler and, 
in April 2003, THUS enabled an
important enhancement to the service,
allowing two-way SMS texting between
the e-m@iler and mobile phones. 
In December 2003, THUS worked 
with Amstrad to introduce the 
CopyMail function, allowing users 
to nominate an e-mail address which 
then automatically receives copies 
of all messages sent or received 
by the e-m@iler .

As the global population ages and disposable 
incomes rise, particularly in emerging economies, 
demand for healthcare will continue to rise. 
Early diagnosis
Funding this burgeoning demand for healthcare 
is a global concern. Recognising this, there is 
increased emphasis on early diagnosis and patient 
monitoring and that is driving Volex to partner with 
its customers to develop interconnect solutions that 
improve these critical activities.

Sensor prevalence
The world is becoming sensor dependent. CNN 
recently named data analytics as the leading job 
opportunity in 2020, and accurate interpretation 
of the sensor -driven data demands high 
performance durability from its interconnects.

equipment in manufacturing plants, companies are 
seeking efﬁciency , performance, quality , environmental 
and safety improvements through automation. Volex’ s 
range of ruggedised products and its ‘harsh environment’ 
expertise mean it is well positioned to capitalise on 
the industry trends.

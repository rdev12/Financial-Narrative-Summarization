CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
strategy of targeting Moscow’s growing middle class, 
as our sales performance at Microgorod «V Lesu» and 
growth in store turnover at Tsvetnoy both show. 
Microgorod «V Lesu»
Our first challenge when we acquired the site at 
Microgorod «V Lesu» was to create a high quality 
city-scale residential development outside of 
Moscow with all necessary infrastructure present. 
Moscow, as distinct from the outlying Moscow 
region, has historically been more sought after for 
many reasons, including the higher level of social 
services provided. The great achievement of «V Lesu» 
has been to attract central Moscow residents out 
to the Moscow Region - over 80% of our buyers are 
Moscow residents. This is a hugely significant statistic. 
Middle class customers are very comfortable coming 
to «V Lesu» because we are creating a community 
and the successful launch of Phase 2 with sales of 
281 units in 2013 demonstrates that this is reaching 
a wider audience. We have good momentum as the 
development gains recognition and we were delighted 
that in November, «V Lesu» won the prestigious 
Urban Awards as the best comfort class residential 
project under construction in the Moscow region. 
Due to high mortgage interest rates and exchange 
rate volatility, we saw a 15% decline in pre-sales in 
terms of units in 2013 versus 2012; however, in terms 
of square metres, the decrease was only 5% as more 
families were attracted to the project moving closer 
to 1st phase completion. This overall decline was 
concurrent with a general slowdown in the Russian 
economy, and high mortgage rates; however Rose 
Group was able to maintain price growth during the 
year, despite evidence that other developers were 
not. In Phase 1, our average price per metre increased 
17% over 2012. Phase 2, in which we initiated sales 
only in February 2013, price per metre had increased 
between 4% and 15% in various buildings by year-end. 
The share of sales financed by mortgage contracts 
in 2013 was approximately 55% (2012: 57%), versus 
an average in Russia of only 25%. According to the 
Russian Agency for Mortgage Lending , by the end of 
2013, disposable income had increased in real terms 
by 3.3% while interest rates were beginning to fall. As 
a result, the share of households for whom mortgage 
credit is available to finance the purchase of a home 
has increased from 26.5% in 2012 to 28-30%. These 
trends contributed to a stronger fourth quarter.
In Phase 1, Buildings 16, 17 and 18, received occupancy 
permits (passed state commissioning) in Q4 2013. 
These buildings are on track for residents to take 
ownership and move in during the first half of 2014, 
at which point the Company will recognise revenues 
from the sales. In addition, planning permissions were 
received in Q4 for RGI’s Kvazar development, which is 
adjacent to the «V Lesu» development and comprises 
a 17 .1 hectare residential and office development.

of «V Lesu» has been to

residents out to the 
Moscow Region
I am pleased to report that good progress was 
made during 2013 against each of the Board’s 
three main business objectives. We delivered on 
our key project goals at Microgorod «V Lesu», we 
improved our operational performance at Tsvetnoy 
and we advanced our other portfolio projects. Our 
accomplishments include completing construction 
of Phase 1 of Lesu, beginning construction of 
Phase 2 and achieving break-even at Tsvetnoy. 
We have also made key personnel improvements at 
both the corporate level and at Tsvetnoy’s operational 
business, bringing more specialist professionals to 
the team. Meanwhile the Rose Group brand is being 
defined more clearly than ever in the minds of Russian 
consumers. These factors combined contributed to a 
resilient performance during a year of slower growth 
for the Russian economy. We are succeeding with our  19 RGI International Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2013

“The happiness of  
my family is all  
that matters. We  
are looking forward  
to moving into our 
apartment and  
getting to know  
our neighbours.”
Microgorod «V Lesu» has set new standards for the 
Moscow residential sector by offering homebuyers a 
well configured development, with good facilities and 
apartments finished to a high quality. It is an example 
of the consistent implementation of a European city 
idea from the first planning to each building’s details. 
The main goal was to create a nice neighborhood,  
a community, where everyone could feel at home.  
We have created a comfortable environment and 
recognizable image to every building. As a result,  
we have a new type of community.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW continued
Tsvetnoy Central Market
At Tsvetnoy, our goal for 2013 was to significantly 
improve operational performance. Our first step 
was to bring in a new management team with a 
mandate to improve operating efficiencies and 
revenues from concessionaires. This has resulted 
in significant changes inside the store that have 
provided top line growth and enabled us to achieve 
operational break even performance by year end. 
Many European department stores take three years 
or more to reach break even and we are pleased 
that Tsvetnoy, which became fully operational in 
2011, has reached this milestone relatively early. 
Tsvetnoy had record footfall in Q4 2013, with nearly 
700,000 visitors (Q4 2012: 510,000). This increase is 
further evidence that the repositioning of the store 
earlier in 2013 is beginning to have results. The new 
management team has focused on more affordable 
fashion brands, and with a better mix in place the 
store is appealing to a broader customer base. 
We were delighted when on 30 October, the WGSN 
Global Fashion Awards in London declared Tsvetnoy 
the Best Store amongst strong competition which 
included finalists Colette (Paris), Evoluzione (India), 
Kate Spade (New York) and Harrods (London).

Central Moscow Developments
We made further advances in 2013 with our central 
Moscow developments. During the year, we 
received planning permission from the Moscow City 
Government to reconstruct and enlarge Moscow’s 
historic “Forum” movie theater. RGI is currently 
evaluating various concepts to proceed based on 
the permits. In October, we sold our Victory Park 
development for US$22 million cash. The disposal of 
this project was in line with our strategy of focusing 
on the development of large scale residential 
schemes and frees up capital for the Company’s 
other projects. We also continued to evaluate 
options for development of the residential portion 
of our Chelsea project and for our Ostozhenka 
37 ultra-high-end residential development. 
In an effort to advance the Khilkov luxury residential 
project, we initiated legal action against Litonor 
Financial Limited, our development partner. The action 
claims damage from Litonor following Litonor’s failure 
to perform its obligations in accordance with the 
partnership agreement dated 19 September 2006. 
Outlook
Our priorities for 2014 are to accelerate our 
development in several directions. At «V Lesu», we 
are looking forward to welcoming the first residents 
shortly after we publish this report. As residents take 
ownership of their apartments, we will be able to 
recognise revenue for Phase 1 and record revenues and 
record our first profits from residential development. 
We expect the successful completion and handover of 
Phase 1 will make Phase 2 even more attractive to new 
buyers and have already begun to dig the foundations 
for the remaining two buildings of Phase 2. We are 
also aiming to complete the school and kindergarten, 
located on the territory of Phase 2, during this year. 
At Tsvetnoy, we will continue to focus on improving 
operational performance. We have already 
identified those areas of the store where the biggest 
opportunities lie and our first step has been to convert 
the lower level into the Tsvetnoy Home Store, selling 
home and kitchenware. We have set high goals for 
increasing footfall, turnover and profits at the store, 
and are continuing to look at ways we can capitalise 
on the strong brand image of Tsvetnoy itself.  RGI International Limited Annual Report & Accounts 2013 21

We will continue to advance our central Moscow 
projects in line with the timeframes that the 
permitting regime allows. At the same time, we 
will consider opportunities to divest or partner on 
these projects to free up capital and reduce risk. 
In terms of corporate developments, we recognise 
that RGI’s AIM listed shares need additional liquidity 
in order to reflect the value of the business. As part 
of our corporate strategy, the Board is engaged in an 
ongoing dialogue with VEB management on the issue. 
We have developed a clear, sustainable long-term 
plan for RGI. As well as having a proven ability to 
execute major developments, RGI has a strong 
reputation in the industry and access to good deal 
flow. We will continue to seek opportunities to 
invest capital in projects where the risk-reward 
ratio is well balanced for shareholders. 
I am confident that RGI can meet its strategic 
objectives but mindful of the risks that external events 
can have on our business and the Moscow housing 
market in general. Our view is that the Company is well 
positioned to weather the bouts of volatility in capital 
markets that have characterized 2014. Whatever the 
short-term brings, by operating efficiently and making 
the most of our clearly defined consumer proposition, 
RGI can look forward to a positive long-term future.

sector I am delighted to be able to report another very 
successful year for Patsystems. At the half year stage 
we stated that, despite a slow first half, we remained 
confident of meeting expectations for the full year, and 
it is testament to the management team and the quality 
of our offering that we have, in fact, exceeded them.”
“trading subsequent to the year end has progressed  
in line with our expectations and our sales pipeline  
is already delivering exciting opportunities for 
2009. w e remain confident of fulfilling our growth 
aspirations despite the tough economic climate.”
“o perating cash flows improved by 38% to £3.6m 
from £2.6m in the prior year. As a result the group 
ended the year with a cash balance of £5.9m.”

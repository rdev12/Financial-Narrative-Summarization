Chairman’s Statement
It was 50 years ago that the Founder 
Director, my father, John Haynes first 
came up with the simple but effective 
idea of stripping down a vehicle and 
recording the step-by-step processes in 
a highly visual photographic manner. The 
resulting manual was unlike anything else 
available in the market and enabled people 
to confidently work on and 
repair their cars. Today and 
over 150 million manuals later, 
the step-by-step approach 
and attention to detail remain 
firmly rooted as the core of 
our business and in large 
part explains why millions of 
consumers worldwide have 
come to trust the  
    Haynes brand. 
Whilst the technologies 
used to photograph, 
write, edit and print 
the manuals have 
changed since 
1960, the authentic 
and established 
Haynes approach 
to writing one of 
our instructional 
manuals whether 
to maintain your 
car, to repair a 
computer, fix a Fender 
Stratocaster or to build your own 
house, remains the same. 
During the past twelve months, the 
Group has, once again, demonstrated an 
underlying financial stability with profits 
maintained, strong cash generation 
and a balance sheet free of gearing. 
Following the structural changes and 
operational improvements which have 
been made under the leadership of 
Eric Oakley in recent years, the Group 
has a strong operating and financial 
platform from which to drive growth in 
the business, whether organically or 
through complimentary and value driven 
acquisitions. Today, the Haynes Group 
has a market leading presence in all major 
English speaking territories around the 
world, with the in-house capability to both 
technically and commercially develop new 
multi-language digital platforms for  
our products. 
The business has truly come a long way 
since its inception in 1960 and it was 
a splendid moment for me in June this 
year when I took over the role of Group 
Chairman.
Results summary
Group revenue, on a like-for-like basis, 
excluding £2.5 million of external print 
revenue received in 2009 from our UK 
Print business, which we sold in February 
2009 and excluding £0.8 million of foreign 
exchange benefit in this year’s figures, 
ended the 12 month period close to the 
previous year at £32.5 million (2009: £32.8 
million). However, after taking account of 
the above movements, reportable Group 
revenue was down 6% at £33.3 million  
(2009: £35.3 million). 
     During the past twelve 
months, the Group has, once 
again, demonstrated an 
underlying financial stability 
with profits maintained, 
strong cash generation and a 
balance sheet free of  
gearing.

Whilst we have seen a 
reduction in revenue following 
the disposal of our UK print 
business, this was lower 
margin activity for the Group, 
and it has, therefore, not 
had a detrimental impact on 
Group profitability. Moreover, 
following the disposal, we have been 
able to focus our attention on the Group’s 
higher margin businesses and coupled with 
a continuous drive for cost efficiencies we 
are able to report a small improvement in 
pre-tax profits of 1% to £7.2 million  
(2009: £7.1 million).  
 
With an effective Group tax rate of 34.7% 
(2009: 32.1%) basic earnings per share 
were 28.6 pence (2009: 29.4 pence).
The Board
After 50 years at the helm, John Haynes 
OBE stepped down as Group Chairman on 
1 June 2010, but remains on the Main Board 
as Founder Director. On behalf of my fellow 
Board Directors I would like to sincerely 
thank him for the stewardship, dedication 
and vision he demonstrated as Chairman 
over many years. Coinciding with my 
appointment as Group Chairman in June, 
I was delighted to welcome Jeremy Yates-
Round onto the Board as the new Managing 
Director of the Haynes UK and European 
operations. Jeremy has been with the Group 
since 2000 and has a wealth of publishing 
experience gained both here in the UK and 
also in international markets.
Dividends
As reported at the half year, 
following the pay down of 
acquisition debt, the Group 
returned to its underlying policy 
of a more evenly spread interim 
and final dividend 
payment. The higher 
interim dividend of 
6.2 pence (2009: 4.0 
pence) is reflected 
in the Board’s 
recommendation for a 
lower final dividend of 
9.3 pence (2009: 11.5 
pence) giving a total 
dividend for the year 
of 15.5 pence  
(2009: 15.5 pence).
 
Subject to the final approval 
by shareholders, the final 
dividend will be paid 
on 27 October 2010 to 
shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 
1 October 2010. The shares 
will be declared ex-dividend 
on 29 September 2010.
People
In this, my first year as Group Chairman, I 
would like to say a big thank you to all our 
employees worldwide. Recent years have 
seen significant changes to the structure 
of the Group as senior management 
has focused on creating long term value 
and identifying growth opportunities, a 
process which has resulted in a number 
of acquisitions and disposals. During this 
period of change it has been the continued 
dedication, hard work and commitment of 
our colleagues worldwide that has helped to 
drive the business forward. In what remain 
very challenging times their continued 
professionalism and enthusiasm has been a 
major contributing factor to the success of 
the Group over the last twelve months.
 
On behalf of the Founder Director I would 
also like to thank all past directors and 
employees who have each played their part 
in helping the Group accomplish all that has 
been achieved over the last 50 years.
Future Prospects
There is much uncertainty over the pace of 
the global economic recovery but I firmly 
believe the Group is well placed to tackle 
the challenges ahead and to seek actively 
and take advantage of new commercial 
opportunities as they arise. The principal 
objective is to build on the success of the 
last 50 years and I am confident we have 
the people across the entire Group who are 
eager to, and capable of, taking on these 
challenges, to drive the business forward 
and to deliver future growth.

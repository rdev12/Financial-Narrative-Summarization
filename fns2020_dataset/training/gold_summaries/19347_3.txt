21 20 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Polymetal International plc Polymetal International plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Operating review
r obust operating performance
in 2015, Polymetal continued to deliver a consistent operating 
performance against a backdrop of depressed commodities 
prices and global macroeconomic volatility. The Company 
reported another year of strong operational delivery with  
gold equivalent production for the year reaching 1.27 Moz, 
which exceeded the original production guidance for 2015  
of 1.22 Moz by 4%.
1
 
g old production was 861 Koz, a 9% year-on-year decrease, 
mainly as a result of scheduled production declines at mature 
mines, including voro, Omolon hub and varvara. Meanwhile, 
silver production increased by 12% reaching 32.1 Moz, driven 
mainly by the excellent grade and throughput at the Dukat 
hub. 827 Kt of copper were produced at our varvara mine.
g old sales were 864 Koz, down 8% year-on-year while,  
at 31.2 Moz, silver sales were up 6% year-on-year, in line  
with production dynamics and volume.

Exploration 
Our sustained investment in both greenfield and brownfield 
exploration, despite the current weak commodity price levels, 
is one of the key components of our strategy, and one that 
will ensure the extension of the mine life at existing operations 
and achieve further production growth through greenfield 
projects. Our exploration activities are focused on five regions 
in r ussia – Khabarovsk, Magadan, Chukotka, Karelia and 
ekaterinburg – as well as on Kazakhstan. 
Polymetal currently has 79 licences for geological studies 
and gold, silver, copper and platinum group metals (Pg M) 
mining, covering a total area of approximately 9,000 km
2
.  
Of these licenses, 45 currently involve active 
exploration activities.
Analysis of production results
Mining 
Stripping volumes in 2015 were 65.3 Mt of rock moved,  
a decrease of 16% year-on-year due to the completion 
of open-pit mining on several deposits, including Dalneye, 
Sopka and Tsokol (Omolon hub) and Khakanja (Okhotsk 
hub). at varvara, there was a decrease in the amount of ore 
mined while processing stockpiles and due to the temporary 
shutdown of the flotation circuit. at the same time, due to 
favourable economic conditions, we resumed open-pit 
mining at Birkachan and commenced mining at Oroch 
(Omolon hub) and Svetloye. 
u nderground development increased by a further 20%  
to more than 73 km, with increased capacity to match 
processing volumes at the Dukat hub underground mines 
and a change in the mining method at Mayskoye. The 
underground development also continued at an active pace 
at albazino, and Tsokol (Omolon hub), where the first ore 
from stopes was mined. 
Ore mined decreased by 7% year-on-year to 12.7 Mt as  
we continued de-stockpiling at some of our operations,  
in particular Omolon and Okhotsk. We had to slow down  
ore mining at Mayskoye in the second half of the year  
due to a change in the mining method, which necessitated 
additional underground development. 
processing 
Ore processed decreased by 4% to 10.8 Mt, mainly as a 
result of the copper circuit shutdown at varvara in the first 
half of the year and the temporary shutdown of the Mayskoye 
concentrator in Q4 as a result of a change in the mining 
method. average gold equivalent grade in ore processed 
remained strong at 4.6 g/t and ensured a robust economic 
performance despite depressed commodity prices.
production and sales dynamics 
While most of the sales are comprised of refined metals, we 
continue to sell concentrates from Dukat (gold/silver), varvara 
(gold/copper) and Mayskoye (refractory gold) to offtakers  
in Kazakhstan, Japan, Bulgaria, Belgium and China. Offtake 
allows us to maximise our margins, compared with the  
cost of processing these materials in-house. in 2015, we 
continued to diversify our offtaker base in China and europe 
in order to achieve an optimal combination of transportation 
costs and treatment charges/recoveries. Offtake concentrate 
trading was pioneered by Polymetal in the r ussian gold 
sector and has now clearly become one of our core 
competencies. This will be leveraged further in our  
approach to the initial development of the Kyzyl project. 
Our key exploration objectives in 2015 included: 
•	 ongoing brownfield exploration activities aimed at 
extending mine lives at our existing operations:  
Okhotsk hub (currently the shortest mine life), Dukat, 
Omolon, albazino and voro;
•	 extending life-of-mine by resource-to-reserve conversion  
at Kyzyl through in-fill drilling; 
•	 estimating hard-rock Pg M resources at our v iksha project 
in Karelia, sufficient for a standalone mining operation;
•	 resource estimates for newly acquired exploration projects, 
including l ichkvaz (armenia) and Dolinnoye (Kazakhstan);
•	 completion of reserve and resource estimates for gold/
copper deposits in the u rals (including n orth Kaluga  
and Tarutin) for further processing at either voro or 
varvara; and 
•	 further greenfield exploration for new precious metal 
deposits with a potential resource base sufficient in grade 
and size to justify the construction of a standalone mine.
in 2015, our drilling volumes decreased by 12% year-on-year 
to 232 km, mainly as a result of the completion of major 
drilling at Tarutin, v iksha and albazino during 2014. additional 
drilling volumes were allocated to new deposits, including 
l ichkvaz, Dolinnoye and Kyzyl. The total capital expenditure 
on exploration decreased by 34% to u S$47 million on the 
back of the substantial devaluation of the r ussian r ouble, 
which had a direct impact on drilling costs.
as a result of our exploration efforts, meaningful  
resource-to-reserve conversions were achieved during the 
year, along with maiden reserve-and-resource estimates 
completed for several projects. These included: 
•	 upgrade of resource quality at Tamunier with current 
estimate of 626 Koz ge at 4.1 g/t;
•	 an initial resource estimate at Primorskoye (Dukat hub) 
acquired in 2015 (+21.3 Moz silver);
•	 an initial reserve estimate at Khrustalny zone (Dukat)  
of 11.5 Moz silver and 23 Koz gold (+167 Koz ge ); and
•	 initial resources at irbychan, Yolochka, n evenrekan 
(Omolon hub) which, combined, added 298 Koz of  
gold equivalent. 
in 2016, we plan to further expand our brownfield exploration 
activities at all processing hubs and to continue to pursue 
new greenfield exploration targets through the acquisition  
of new licences in key regions, including Karelia (for Pg Ms), 
u rals, armenia and Kazakhstan.
1
 g iven the persistent change in gold/silver market price ratio, 
Polymetal has decided to change the gold/silver ratio used in 
presenting gold equivalent (ge ) production from 1/60 to 1/80.  
all gold equivalent production numbers for current and prior 
periods in this report have been restated accordingly.

Chief Executive’s Review
“We announced in May a major  
new strategic growth initiative 
called Bloomsbury 2020, and  
the creation of Bloomsbury  
Digital Resource Publishing.  
We plan to accelerate significantly 
the growth of digital revenues 
by implementing a new digital 
publishing plan in our move  
to become primarily a non-
consumer publisher in the B2B 
academic and professional 
information market. ”
Nigel Newton
Chief Executive
I
t has been a very good year for Bloomsbury, with revenues 
growing by 11% year on year to £123.7 million and profit before 
tax and highlighted items increasing by 8% to £13.0 million. 
Book sales grew by 17% year on year to £113.1 million, with digital 
sales, within this total, increasing by 28% to £15.0 million. Digital 
sales make up 13% of book sales (2015: 12%). Rights and services 
revenues were £10.6 million (2015: £14.1 million), being 9% of 
total Group revenues compared to 13% in the previous year. The 
operating profit margin before highlighted items for the Group 
was maintained year on year at 11%. Operating profit before 
highlighted items grew year on year in all territories except India, 
where we saw significant sales growth but where we continue to 
invest for that growth. 
The Children’s & Educational division delivered an excellent 
performance, with its third consecutive year of strong double 
digit revenue growth. The Illustrated Edition of Harry Potter and 
the Philosopher’s Stone by J. K. Rowling and Jim Kay, which was 
published in October, was a major international seller. 
The Academic & Professional division had strong digital revenues 
contributing to a growth in book sales but, as expected, did not 
match last year with its exceptional rights sales. In the Adult division 
revenues were higher and included a full year of Osprey Publishing, 
which was acquired in December 2014, but profits reflected a 
change in revenue mix and a tough comparator that included the 
paperback release of Khaled Hosseini’s exceptionally successful 
And the Mountains Echoed. Bloomsbury Information division profits 
grew year on year. The strength of our overall result, despite the 
variations in individual divisional performance, again demonstrates 
the virtues of our portfolio approach encompassing four different 
publishing genres. 
Planned synergies following the acquisition of Osprey Publishing in 
December 2014 have been achieved. Osprey contributed £7.2 million 
of revenue and £1.1 million of operating profit before highlighted 
items to Bloomsbury in 2016. Excluding the results of Osprey in both 
years, Group like for like revenues grew by 6% and profit before tax 
and highlighted items was flat year on year. 
We continue to keep costs closely under review and this year 
renegotiated our US mono print contracts with little or no movement 
on cost in a highly competitive marketplace (previous contracts 
having expired in 2015). Planned savings on freight from Far East 
printers were achieved through consolidation with other publishers 
using the same UK warehouse and distribution service provider.
Highlighted items of £2.7 million (2015: £2.5 million) include  
£1.8 million (2015: £1.8 million) of amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets. Other highlighted items in this period of £0.9 million are 
primarily as a result of the Group’s acquisition activities and the 
restructuring of the Bloomsbury Information division.

 Over the last four years, 
Creston has built a highly
successful business model.
Unashamedly, our strategy
remains unaltered, that of 
growing both organically and
through selective acquisitions 
to become a substantial,
diversified, international 
marketing services group. 
This strategy will continue 
to be achieved by acquiring
companies with a record of 
strong organic growth and
management who are committed 
to further growth as part of the
Creston group of companies. 
The Board believes that an
important part of this strategy 
is to avoid over-concentration 
in any one part of the marketing
services sector, thereby
minimising risk. 
Creston will consider acquisitions
across the marketing services
disciplines including market
research, direct marketing,
customer relationship marketing
and digital marketing. We will 
also consider companies that 
have strong track records within 
more cyclical sectors but only where
they meet our strict acquisitions
criteria, which have been the key to
our success. This allowed us to
acquire DLKW, one of Britain’s
leading advertising agencies. 
Our outstanding performance 
has been recognised in two
independent surveys. The 
‘Hot 100 for 2005’ survey
prepared from Companies 
House data by Real Business
Magazine and in association 
with Lloyds Development Capital
features Creston as the third
fastest growing Main List public
company in the UK and the
fastest growing marketing services
public company. Creston achieved
13th place in 2004 Europe 500
listing, the only independent
pan-European listing of high
growth job creating companies. 
Chairman’s Statement
“I’m delighted to report the
fourth year of record results.
Unashamedly, our strategy
remains unaltered, that of
growing both organically and
through selective acquisitions
to become a substantial,
diversified, international
marketing services group.”

Annual Report and Accounts 2005
70472 Creston RAccs Pt1  1/7/05  11:33  Page 4 Our robust business model is very
different to that of the large trade
groups and is the key to Creston’s
ability to continue to outperform 
the market.
Creston’s acquisition criteria are:
Growth companies
Creston buys established
businesses with proven 
growth histories and credible
business plans. 
Committed vendors
Creston will not consider
companies where the vendors
want an immediate exit, although
it is sensitive to life stage issues. 
The Board prefers to harness the
entrepreneurial skills of vendors 
to work together to grow Creston. 
Creston equity – An important
part of retaining vendor loyalty 
Creston equity forms a meaningful
part of the consideration and 
helps bind vendors’ and Creston’s
ambitions together. 
Creston Operating Board
Creston harnesses the
entrepreneurial talents of the
acquired company management
through representation on the
Operating Board. This reviews
overall strategy, performances and
synergy opportunities and reports
to the Creston Plc Board. 
Overview of Financial Results
Turnover grew by 22 per cent. 
to £35.9m (2004: £29.5m).
Operating profit grew by 56 per
cent. to £3.7m (2004: £2.4m),
and profit before tax grew by 68
per cent. to £3.5m (2004: £2.1m).
Operating margins grew by 9 per
cent. to 23 per cent. 
Basic earnings per share were 
10.72 pence (2004: 9.03 pence), 
an increase of 19 per cent., 
and diluted earnings per share
increased by 25 per cent. to
10.56 pence (2004: 8.47 pence).
Detailed information on the
Group’s financial performance 
is set out in the Chief Operating
and Financial Officer’s Review. 
Dividend
In line with the strategy of
pursuing a progressive dividend
policy, the Board recommends 
for payment a final dividend 
for this year of 1.45 pence per
share in addition to the interim 
of 0.7 pence per share paid in
November 2004, making a total
dividend for the year of 2.15
pence per share (2004: 1.80
pence per share). The dividend
will be paid on 1 August 2005
subject to shareholder approval at
the forthcoming AGM of the
Company, to shareholders on the
register at the close of business
on 1 July 2005. 
The Board intends to maintain
its progressive dividend policy,
recognising the importance to
shareholders of dividends and it 
is the intention of the Board to
continue to pay interim dividends
in future, subject to satisfactory
financial performance and
prudent cash management. This
year’s dividend represents a 19
per cent. increase on last year
reflecting this policy. 
Staff
The Group now has 467
employees, compared to 269 
last year, in 10 locations in the
United Kingdom – Bath, Bristol,
London (five), Swindon,
Westerham and Winchester. 
I would like to welcome the staff
of CML who joined the Group in
September 2004 and DLKW who
joined in March of this year. 
I would also like to congratulate
the directors and staff across the
Group who have been responsible
for such excellent results,
particularly when set against 
the market and our competitors. 
In order to maintain the enthusiasm
of the staff, shareholders approved 
a Sharesave Scheme and 
an Enterprise Management 
Incentive Scheme at the 2004 AGM. 
I am very pleased to report that
the take up of the Sharesave
Scheme, which is entirely
voluntary, was very high at 42 
per cent. of all staff – a sign, I
believe, of the commitment and
confidence the staff as a whole
have towards Creston’s future. 
It is intended to make a further
offering under the Sharesave
Scheme to enable our new
employees to participate in 
the future. 
Senior management motivation 
is clearly vital and a Long Term
Incentive Plan, the details of
which are contained in the
Remuneration Report, will be 
put to the AGM for approval. 
Outlook
The Board believes that Creston
has established a robust business
model and is confident of the
Group’s future prospects. I am
confident that the coming year 
will again deliver a further year of
strong growth, both organically
and by acquisition.

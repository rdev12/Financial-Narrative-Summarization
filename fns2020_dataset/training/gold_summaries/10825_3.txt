Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Review of the Year
I am delighted to report  
that Nanoco’s first full  
year as a publicly quoted 
company has been one of 
excellent progress across our 
business. It was a year during 
which we made significant 
headway in our commercial 
collaborations, in our 
manufacturing scale-up  
and in strengthening our 
management team.
Nanoco’s key asset is its world-class 
patent-protected technology for the 
design, development and commercial 
manufacture of quantum dots and 
other nanomaterials, avoiding the 
use of heavy metals. Our intellectual 
property position has continued  
to strengthen during the year, with 
multiple patent filings to protect  
our core technology, innovative  
new materials and novel devices.
During the year we signed our first 
agreement in the solar power sector, 
with the major Japanese semi-
conductor production equipment 
supplier Tokyo Electron. Under  
this agreement we are using our 
nanomaterial technology to develop 
a highly efficient solar ink which will 
be printed to create a photovoltaic 
nanomaterial film. 
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), for use 
in televisions and in general lighting, 
remain the first market from which 
we expect commercial revenues.  
The television backlighting market 
moved significantly in our favour 
during the year. All of the major 
television manufacturers are now 
focusing on LEDs for television 
backlighting, in part because of the 
decision by California – the world’s 
eighth largest economy – to introduce 
legislation demanding that television 
makers reduce the power consumption 
of televisions by 49% by 2013. LEDs 
with our quantum dots have the 
potential to achieve this target.
During the year we announced a 
second agreement, with another 
major Japanese company, in the  
LED sector and this has progressed 
very well with significant milestones 
already achieved. Good progress  
was also made with the first LED 
agreement signed in November 2008, 
with further milestones reached  
and we are on track to deliver our 
first commercial quantities early  
next calendar year. In parallel with  
the progress in our commercial 
collaborations we are pressing 
forward with scaling-up our 
production capability, both in 
Manchester and in a new facility  
in Runcorn. 
Financials 
Our revenues in the year to 31 July 
2010 were £2.94 million (2009: £1.99 
million). Our loss before tax was  
£1.37 million (2009: £0.78 million). 
Cash, cash equivalents and deposits 
at the year-end were £5.68 million 
(31 July 2009: £6.59 million).
People
The Nanoco team, most of whom are 
highly qualified scientists, grew to 49 
people at the year end, reflecting the 
increased activity with existing and 
potential commercial partners and 
progress in manufacturing scale-up. 
The Board was strengthened with  
the appointment of Anthony Clinch,  
a highly experienced industrialist  
and financier, as a Non-Executive*. 
Andrew Gooda, an experienced 
production engineer, was appointed 
as Manufacturing Director. Post the 
year end, we welcomed Colin White 
to the full-time role of Chief Financial 
Officer and, at the same time, 
Michael Bretherton, formerly part-
time Chief Financial Officer, became  
a Non-Executive Director.
I would like to offer sincere thanks  
to all at Nanoco for their dedication 
and commitment throughout the 
year and to all our commercial 
partners for their contribution to  
the development of the Company.
Outlook
The rapid progress at Nanoco  
since joining AIM in May 2009 has 
continued into the current year, 
which has started well. We are 
making substantial progress in 
developing our business, particularly 
in our manufacturing scale-up and  
in delivering on our commercial 
contracts. We expect to continue  
to meet key milestones and are 
moving close to achieving our first 
kilogram delivery of quantum dots. 
We therefore view the future  
with confidence.

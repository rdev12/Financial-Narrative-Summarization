 Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
Chairman’s statement
We measure Mapeley's performance by focusing on 
Funds From Operations (FFO), a metric commonly 
used by REITs to isolate cash ﬂow from real estate.
Although we are not a REIT, we are focused on providing
our investors with transparency into our operational
performance, and ensure this by paying out substantially
all our FFO as dividends. As a result, we will return
regularly to the equity markets to fund growth opportunities
such as the single asset acquisitions we are committed to
adding to our portfolio.
In addition to paying out dividends, it is our aim to
increase them – during 2006 we increased our dividend 
in every quarter. In 2006 we paid a total dividend of 168
pence per share, and our 2006 fourth quarter annualised
dividend of 180 pence per share represents a 22% increase
over the same period in 2005. 
Although we do not have control of the movement of
our stock price, we believe the markets have recognised
our performance in 2006. Mapeley's total return to
shareholders in 2006 was 55.6% as compared to the FTSE
250 Index, the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index and the FTSE
EPRA Index TSR of 30.2%, 49.2% and 48.4% respectively.
We at Mapeley are very proud that we have been able to
provide superior returns to our shareholders and it is our
goal to create long-term shareholder value. 
In 2007 we are well-placed to continue to drive shareholder
returns through executing our strategy of growing both
the real estate outsourcing business and DPI Portfolio 
and increasing returns from our existing portfolio. Our
strengths of in-depth local market knowledge, our strong
relationships with tenants, operational capability and
capacity, and our access to capital resources will be key 
to our performance in 2007.
We want to thank you for your continued support 
and conﬁdence in our Company. Through our dividends,
we will continue to provide our shareholders with a 
clear window into our ﬁnancial performance. We at
Mapeley value hard work, commitment and excellence,
and I believe these values are found throughout our
organisation. We believe strongly in our employees, our
assets and our strategy. We look forward to a great 2007.
Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 05 Chairman’s statement
Wesley R Edens
Chairman
2006 was a strong year for Mapeley, our ﬁrst full year 
as a public company. Mapeley has made great strides 
over the past year and today the Company is stronger in
virtually every respect. Our goal is to set the standard in
terms of earnings and dividend growth, and transparency
as the leading owner and operator of UK real estate. 
In the year and a half since we became a public company,
the liquidity of our stock has increased measurably 
as our equity market capitalisation has grown to
approximately £1.1 billion.
Mapeley's portfolio includes 1,683 properties spread
throughout the United Kingdom, covering over 2.3 million
square metres and valued at more than £2 billion.
Highlights of this year include: 
Strong ﬁnancial performance enabling dividend
growth 
The award of a new Government outsourcing 
contract with the Identity and Passport Service 
The acquisition of an additional £366 million 
of investment property assets 
Mapeley's presence in every major town and city in 
the UK, combined with our position of acting as both
landlord and tenant across a geographically diverse
portfolio, provides an excellent insight into the markets 
we operate in. This insight drives returns across the
business and unlocks future acquisition opportunities.

Operating profit is reported on an underlying basis, i.e. including share of results of associates but before amortisation of acquired intangibles, 
any goodwill impairment and exceptionals. Underlying EBITDA and underlying earnings per share are calculated on the same basis.
Free cash flow comprises underlying EBITDA plus working capital and net capital expenditure flows. 
Return on capital employed is calculated as underlying operating profit over net assets/(liabilities) adjusted for goodwill, acquired intangibles, 
debt, tax, employee benefits and insurance provisions.

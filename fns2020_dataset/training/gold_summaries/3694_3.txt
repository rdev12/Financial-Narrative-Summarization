Chairman’s Statement
Results
Another strong performance in 2002 further extends the
group’s consistent record of growth. Turnover for the year
increased by 1.8% to £734.6m (2001 – £721.8m) and profit
before tax, integration costs and goodwill amortisation rose
by 11.4% to £115.3m (2001 – £103.5m). Profit on ordinary
activities before taxation increased by 13.6% to £99.4m
(2001 – £87 .5m). Underlying earnings per share of 86.1p
(2001 – 75.4p) were 14.2% higher than for the comparable
period last year . Your directors have recommended a final
dividend of 18.00p (2001 – 16.33p) per share. Together with
the interim dividend of 7 .60p per share (2001 – 6.90p) which
was paid in December , this represents an increase of 10.2%
compared to 2001. Subject to shareholders’ approval, the
final dividend will be paid on 4 July 2003 to all shareholders
on the register as at 6 June 2003.
The group generated cash from operations of £135.9m (2001
– £90.2m). Net debt at the year end of £188.8m (2001 –
£207 .7m) includes the cash cost of acquisitions completed 
in 2002, and represents a gearing level of 52.6% 
(2001 – 66.3%).
The group invested £31.6m (2001 – £28.2m) in research and
development and £31.4m (2001 – £32.2m) in capital
expenditure on new equipment and facilities. As a percentage
of turnover this level of continued reinvestment in the group
is reflected favourably in the Department of Trade and
Industry’s most recent scoreboard for UK companies.
New orders worth £0.7bn were won during the year and total
orders-in-hand at the end of the year amounted to £1.2bn.
Trading performance was much stronger in the second six
months of the year . Good results were produced within the
manufacturing segment by Flight Refuelling and Carleton,
whilst the Avionics segment continued its impressive growth.
Across the group, the benefit of continued investment and
restructuring programmes will enable a competitive cost
structure to be maintained.
“These results represent an excellent
performance in 2002 which further
extend the group’s consistent record
of growth. The high level of
reinvestment in research and
development and capital expenditure
will enable the group to continue to
exploit its position in key aerospace
niche markets. Undoubtedly 2003 
will provide further challenges but 
the underlying strength of the 
group and its position on a wide 
range of aerospace programmes
ensure that it is best placed to 
face the tasks ahead.”

Corporate Development
The group intends to strengthen its leading position in
aerospace niche markets building on the skills and systems
capability that have been developed in recent years. A
combination of organic growth and acquisition will continue
to underpin this strategy which has produced consistent
growth and an increasing return for our shareholders over
many years.
People
In June 2002, the group was pleased to appoint Peter Hooley,
Group Finance Director of Smith & Nephew, as an
independent non-executive director . At the same time, Mike
Smith was nominated as senior non-executive director .
Also in June, Geoff Roe retired as a director of the group and
Managing Director of FR Aviation. He will continue to work
with the group on a part-time basis for the next two years
assisting in the development of specific projects. Alex
Hannam, who was previously Managing Director of Radar
Systems Division with Alenia Marconi Systems, was
appointed an executive director of the group and Managing
Director of FR Aviation with effect from July 2002.
Outlook
The outbreak of war in Iraq has increased uncertainties and
tensions worldwide. After previous conflicts the commercial
aerospace sector demonstrated its capability to return to
normal operation within a relatively short period of time and
I hope that this will happen again. On the military side, any
conflict highlights the need for a number of essential
capabilities and these certainly include air to air refuelling,
aircraft and ship defensive aids, secure and mobile
communications – many of which are being supplied and
supported by group companies.
The group’s performance is a source of pride to us all and is
built on the hard work of all employees. I thank them for their
contribution in the year and am confident, as is the board,
that our record of growth will be continued.

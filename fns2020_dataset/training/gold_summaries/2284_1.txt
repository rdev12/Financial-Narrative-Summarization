Annual Report 2011
Chief Executive’s review
Trading overview
Bodycote delivered a strong financial result in 2011, moving the 
Group closer to achieving the kind of performance to which we 
aspire. Sales increased 14% to £570.7m, headline operating profit
1
 
was £85.5m, an increase of 64%
2
 and headline margins improved 
to 15%. Basic headline EPS grew to 32.7 pence, a major step 
forward from the EPS performance the Bodycote group has 
previously achieved.
In the early part of the year much of the growth in market demand 
was driven by the tail end of recovery in the early cycle markets 
such as automotive and a strengthening in a number of the 
general industrial segments. As the year progressed the expected 
ramp up in the later cycle markets of aerospace and energy started 
to feature more strongly. These ’secular growth‘ markets are now 
starting to move from slow recovery mode into an increasing rate 
of longer term underlying growth. While we have benefited from 
the cyclical recovery in many of our markets it is particularly 
pleasing to see that we continue to expand our market share and, 
as a consequence, are driving growth above the underlying rate 
of those markets.
Improved margins are being achieved in nearly every area of the 
Group. The improvement stems in part from higher volumes, but 
a significant amount comes from an improvement in mix as we 
focus on higher added-value opportunities. Improving efficiency 
continues to be a key focus for the Group; it is notable that while 
average headcount reduced by 1%, sales grew by 14%.
Net capital expenditure increased to £44.5m which was 0.9 times 
depreciation (0.8 times in 2010). Maintenance capital remained 
relatively unchanged at approximately 0.4 times depreciation.  
The increase in capital expenditure primarily reflects a higher level 
of expansion capital in the aerospace and energy markets, the 
emerging economies and specific chosen technologies.
Return on Capital Employed was 16.9% compared to 10.1% in 
2010. This is an important metric for the long term performance 
of the Group. The Headline operating cash flow, measured after 
capital spending, was £96.0m representing profit-to-cash 
conversion of 112%. Our free cash flow
1
 of £70.5m enabled 
the elimination of net debt by year end.
Strategic progress
Bodycote has continued to develop in line with the strategic 
direction that we outlined at the start of 2010. Our differentiated 
focus on each of Automotive & General Industrial and Aerospace 
& Energy is delivering results. Some of the evidence of this is the 
increased rate of securing larger long term contracts that has been 
a notable feature of the business in 2011. The new agreements 
with Rolls-Royce and Precision Castparts Corp reflect our strategic 
focus on the secular growth markets of aerospace and energy.
The agreement with automotive supplier, ZF Lenksysteme, in 
China is a good example of our ‘hub and spoke’ expansion strategy 
for the emerging markets, where we develop new work at a hub 
location and move out to a new greenfield facility once volumes 
justify. The business with this customer has been developed at 
our ‘hub’ site in Wuxi, China, and will now be transferred to a new 
greenfield site being built in Jinan, China. This will make way for 
further business development at Wuxi while at the same time 
helping the expansion of our services to other customers near 
the new plant in Jinan.
Bodycote’s strategy is aimed at 
growing the business above and 
beyond the background growth 
rate of the global economy 
while delivering consistently 
superior value. The pace of 
execution of this strategy is 
gaining momentum and we 
enter 2012 in good shape.

Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information
In general, the expansion strategy in our emerging markets has 
been going extremely well. Our business in China, Poland, the 
Czech Republic and Turkey has grown strongly as capacity has 
been added. The business in Romania is, as yet, still small but 
is doing well and has attractive prospects for the future. 
We converted our majority shareholding in this territory into a 
wholly owned venture in 2011. Revenues in the emerging 
markets, excluding Brazil, grew by 23%. The financial results 
in Brazil were the only disappointment in the year, with the 
losses virtually unchanged from 2010. This was largely driven 
by the restructuring induced dip in sales (down 27% on 2010).  
This programme has now been completed and operationally the 
Brazilian business is in good shape to deliver a high level of service 
to customers. We are cautiously optimistic that we can achieve 
substantial progress in the medium term, but experience has 
shown that this is likely to take longer in this territory than we 
have typically achieved in other parts of the Group.
Significant progress has been made on the development of the 
Group’s proprietary products business units.
  Speciality Stainless Steel Products (S³P) continues to exceed 
our expectations, with demand for these specialist processes 
continuing to outstrip supply. Sales grew by 21%, we added 
25% more capacity during the year and a further 50% capacity 
increase is under construction to meet the increasing 
opportunities we have.
  The Hot Isostatic Pressing Product Fabrication (HIP PF) 
business unit revenues grew by over 60%, with expansion of 
activity in all territories. The constraint to expansion of this 
business has, so far, largely been an issue of recruiting and 
training sales and operational resources at a sufficient rate.  
Much progress has been made during the year and the 
business now has significant strength and depth of expertise. 
HIP PF specific capital equipment requirements are relatively 
modest and expansion of this capacity is proceeding well.  
General HIP capacity is used both for HIP PF and HIP Services. 
Demand for HIP services from the aerospace and industrial gas 
turbine markets is buoyant and we expect further growth in this 
area for some considerable time. As a result of the HIP PF 
growth and the HIP Services growth trends, we are starting to 
see capacity constraints ahead. Our initial capacity pinch-point 
is in North America.  In response to this we have agreed to 
invest over $20m of expansion capital in this area which will be 
deployed over the next eighteen months.
Opportunities to expand the business continue to surface at a 
high rate in our more established markets in Europe and North 
America. A good proportion of these are as a result of technology 
changes driven by environmental factors such as elimination of 
chrome plating or the pursuit of lighter vehicles with better fuel 
efficiency and lower emissions. The services and processes we 
offer in these areas such as Corr-I-Dur
®
 and low pressure 
carburising provide our customers with a very high value 
proposition and consequently we are able to secure above 
average returns on investment.
The combination of the various elements of our strategy, in 
technology driven expansion, emerging markets expansion and 
specific secular growth market expansion, leads to a higher 
demand for capital investment. Returns on investment in these 
areas are all very attractive and we expect in the near term that 
the Group will invest in capital expenditure at a slightly higher  
level than the depreciation charge.
Bodycote is now debt free and has strong cash generation.  
These characteristics enable us to consider enhancing our 
potential for future profit growth by increased investment, both 
internally for organic growth and through selective acquisitions. 
We seek a balance between gaining immediate returns, longer 
term growth prospects and limitation of risk. Our acquisition focus 
is on achieving attractive returns on investment through ‘bolt-ons’  
to our existing business. 
Summary & outlook
2011 has been another year of improving operational and financial 
performance for the Group. The performance improvement and 
growth in the last few years has been continuous and the Group 
is starting to march to a drumbeat, notwithstanding the hesitation 
that occurred in the global economic recovery in the second half  
of 2011.
Bodycote's strategy is aimed at growing the business above and 
beyond the background growth rate of the global economy while 
delivering consistently superior value. The pace of execution of 
this strategy is gaining momentum and we enter 2012 in good 
shape.
The macroeconomic environment may continue to be challenging, 
but with nearly half of the Group’s activity in areas which have  
long term growth drivers that are less likely to be impacted by 
economic headwinds we believe there is a good prospect that 
the business will continue to move forward in the coming year.

I am pleased to present our results 
for the financial year ended 30 
September 2015. The Group achieved 
positive like-for-like net income growth 
for each quarter and an increase of 
0.8% for the full year. The business 
has now delivered nine consecutive 
quarters of like-for-like net income 
growth. As a result, profit before tax 
and exceptional items for the 2015 
year was £122 million which delivered 
adjusted earnings per share of 19.4p, 
2.1% ahead of the previous year.
This strong performance has provided 
the platform for us to undertake 
the most fundamental review 
of our business model since the 
Company was established in 1991 . 
Work commenced on this review 
in April 2014 and the outcome was 
presented together with our Interim 
results in May 2015. Covering 
the next five years, it represents 
a sustainable long-term strategy 
that embraces different operating 
formats for our pubs in order to best 
serve our publicans, employees and 
communities in which our assets are 
located. It will also deliver significantly 
greater value to our shareholders by 
optimising the returns from each of 
our assets. Underlying the strategy 
is a comprehensive analysis of the 
consumer habits, demographics and 
competitive environment of each of 
our pubs, and a thorough evaluation 
of the best operating model for 
each pub, embracing fully managed 
all the way to free-of-tie, rent-only 
agreements. 
Since announcing the strategy in 
May, it has received widespread 
shareholder endorsement and 
support.
Execution is clearly critical and I am 
pleased to report good progress 
in this regard. Additional and 
experienced management has been 
added to the senior team; pub by 
pub analysis and planning is well 
underway and each of the new 
operating models has been created. 
Our intention is to keep the markets 
and our investors fully informed 
about our progress in executing the 
strategy, with key events planned 
over the coming years. 
Meanwhile, the past year has seen 
the successful implementation of 
many initiatives in our leased and 
tenanted estate, enhancing publican 
profitability and mitigating business 
failures. We have continued to 
dispose of under-performing assets, 
reinvesting the proceeds to drive 
like-for-like net income growth and 
improve the financial returns of our 
retained estate. In the new financial 
year we expect to generate around 
£65 million from the disposal of 
properties which we do not judge can 
deliver an adequate return, and plan 
to invest approximately £70 million in 
our retained assets, targeting growth 
projects. 
The Group continues to proactively 
manage its debt profile. At the 
beginning of the year we completed 
the partial refinancing of £249.5 
million of the 2018 corporate bonds 
and introduced a new revolving bank 
facility which helps to smooth and 
extend the debt maturity profile and 
reduce the cost of borrowings. Debt 
reduction has continued and in 2015 
we reduced net debt by a further 
£84 million, with total net debt at 30 
September 2015 of £2.3 billion.
In March 2015 the Small Business, 
Enterprise and Employment Bill 
received Royal Assent. This heralded 
the future introduction of a Statutory 
Code and an independent Adjudicator 
to regulate the relationship between 
a small number of large pub 
companies, including Enterprise, and 
their tied tenants. Royal Assent has 
brought some closure to a period of 
uncertainty and we remain engaged 
in the consultation process relating to 
the detail of that code. 
Dividend
We continue to use free cash flow 
to meet our debt repayments and 
to fund business growth in order to 
generate value for shareholders by 
sustaining operational progress and to 
deliver the new business strategy. The 
Board believes it is not appropriate to 
resume the payment of dividends at 
this time.
Board of directors
We welcomed Marisa Cassoni as a 
non-executive director on 1 April 2015. 
Marisa brings a wealth of financial 
experience with consumer-facing 
businesses, further strengthening the 
Board. 
Employees and publicans
Our engaged and hard-working 
employees and publicans are critical 
to our success. We conducted our 
second employee engagement survey 
in the year which reported a further 
increase in the overall satisfaction and 
engagement of our team. It is equally 
pleasing that publicans in our leased 
and tenanted estate continue to 
include many award winners. I would 
like to thank them all for their hard 
work during the past year.
Outlook
Trading in the new financial year is in 
line with expectations and we expect 
to maintain the growth momentum 
achieved in the last few years at the 
same time as delivering the longer 
term evolution of our business.

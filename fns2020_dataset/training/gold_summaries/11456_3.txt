Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
OVERVIEW
 Successfully admitted to AIM in April 2004
 Turnover a record £21.3m
 Job creation exceeded 200
 Improved operating margin at 19%
 Strong cash inflow from operations of £4.9m
I am pleased to report that the year ended
31 December 2004 reflected a period of
significant achievement and importance for
the Group.
The Company was successfully admitted
to the Alternative Investment Market of the
London Stock Exchange on 13 April 2004.
This achieved a key objective and allowed
the Company to redeem all remaining
preference shares and to pay in full the
associated dividend liabilities. The increase
in our share price since flotation reflects
how well the listing was received.
The financial performance of the Group
has been robust with turnover at a record
£21.3m (2003: £17.8m). We recorded
a 47% gross margin (2003: 44%) and
an operating margin of 19% (2003: 16%).
Operating profit has grown by 41% to
£4.1m which reflects economies of scale
and improved efficiencies on incremental
volumes. Cash flow has been strong,
allowing the early repayment of some
£1.3m of long term debt.
The Directors are proposing a maiden
dividend of 1.5p per ordinary share payable
on 8 July 2005.
The Group’s strategy continues to focus
strongly on increased development of its
kitchen brands and expanded distribution
through independent retail outlets
nationwide in the replacement and
new build markets.
Current trading is in line with expectations
and the Directors are confident that the
product launches in 2005, together with
improved distribution, will lead to further
growth in volumes, margins and profit.
On behalf of the Group, I would like to
thank all of our customers and suppliers
as well as our own skilled and dedicated
staff, who now number over 200, for
their support, commitment and energy
throughout the year.

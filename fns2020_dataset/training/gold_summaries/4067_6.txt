04 Overview 
CEEQUAL awards
In 2011, we received the CEEQUAL 
(‘Civil Engineering Environmental 
Quality Assessment and Award 
Scheme’) ‘Outstanding Achievement’ 
Award in the community relations 
category for the Castleford Footbridge 
project and an ‘Excellent’ Award for 
the Church Village Bypass project.
The Prince’s Seeing is Believing 
programme aims to inspire and engage 
business leaders on responsibility 
issues. Through unique visits into 
the heart of UK communities, the 
programme offers a way to challenge 
business leaders’ perceptions on 
responsibility issues within their 
individual businesses, through their 
supply chains and across industries. 
The event saw senior business leaders 
visit Crest Boys’ Academy, in Neasden, 
and St Joseph’s RC Primary School, 
in Willesden, to see how programmes, 
such as STEMNET and Mosaic, are 
being implemented in order to bridge 
the growing skills gap in the UK. 
The event then moved on to the National 
Grid Tunnelling Project, in Willesden, 
for an insight into what Costain is 
doing to help bridge the skills gap, and 
to meet apprentices, trainee engineers, 
construction ambassadors and 
graduates to gain an understanding 
of the challenges facing young people 
looking to forge a career in a technical 
industry and the importance 
of apprenticeships.

Gold Green Apple Gold Green Apple 
Environment Award Environment Award 
The Costain joint venture working 
on the redevelopment of Farringdon 
station in central London, received 
a prestigious Gold Green Apple 
Environment Award for its sustainable 
approach to building and construction. 
The Green Apple Awards recognise 
environmental best practice and the 
business reasons behind employing 
environmental initiatives in order 
to safeguard the environment. 
The project won by demonstrating 
how sustainable development can 
have both an environmental and 
economic benefit. For example, 
the team diverted 100% of the 
demolition waste from landfill which 
saved £365,000 in landfill tax, 
while reusing the rubble from the 
demolition removed the need for 
approximately 850 lorry movements 
which saved 30 tonnes of CO 2
emissions and approximately 
£70,000 on the cost of additional 
materials. For the new ticket hall, 
instead of using what would have 
amounted to 500 tonnes of steel, 
the team used an eco-reinforced 
alternative that was 95% recycled 
and responsibly sourced.
Costain – selected 
by the Energy 
Technologies 
Institute
Costain was selected by the Energy 
Technologies Institute (‘ETI’) to lead the 
development of the next generation in 
carbon capture technology. The project 
will see a carbon capture pilot plant 
capable of capturing 95% of CO 2
emissions designed, built, operated 
and tested by the middle of 2015.

Business in the Community’s Awards 
for Excellence 2011. The Company was 
awarded two Big Tick Awards in the 
‘Skills in the Workplace’ and ‘Building 
Stronger Communities’ categories. 
The skills award acknowledged the work 
Costain has put into developing talent 
throughout the organisation at all 
levels – from basic literacy classes for 
local trainees to continuing development 
of the skills of Executive Board members.
The community award recognised 
the efforts the Company made while 
building the Church Village Bypass 
in South Wales. Substantial numbers 
of local unemployed people were 
taken on to the project workforce and 
considerable efforts were made to 
maximise expenditure within the local 
community and small businesses.

of 95% in the

Costain achieved a score of 95%, a 
Platinum banding, in the BITC Corporate 
Responsibility (‘CR’) Index 2011. The 
Index helps companies to integrate and 
improve CR throughout their operations 
by providing a systematic approach to 
managing, measuring and reporting 
on business impacts in society and 
on the environment.
“I congratulate Costain on achieving 
Platinum in the 2011 BITC Corporate 
Responsibility Index. It is a challenging 
time, but the results of this year’s 
Index demonstrate that companies 
are still focused on transforming their 
businesses in order to have a positive 
impact on society. All the companies 
who participated this year are at 
different stages in their responsible 
business journey, but they are 
all taking these issues seriously 
and are prepared to lead by example.”

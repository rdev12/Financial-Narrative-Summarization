Chairman’s Statement
This is our seventh year as an AIM listed company 
and whilst this year has seen good progress in parts 
of the Group, overall our performance has been below 
expectations. Some of the highlights are as follows:
Key Strengths
l Excellent performances from Lyme Regis Foods, Nimbus Foods
and Savoury Snacks Division
l Continued strong operating cash generation and improving
operational efficiency
l Dormen Foods and Snacks Unlimited now integrated under one
management team 
l Strengthening of our senior management team with one
key appointment
Results
During the year to 30th June 2009, Glisten Plc achieved revenue up 
1% to £74.4m (2008: £73.8m). EBITDA before exceptional items fell 
by 28% to £7.1m (2008: £9.9m) and our pre-exceptional operating 
profits (see note 5) were down by 36% to £5.1m (2008: £8.0m).
Profit before tax and exceptional items decreased by 49% to £3.4m
(2008: £6.7m). 
Our adjusted basic earnings (as defined in note 10) and adjusted 
diluted earnings per share fell by 49% to 17.9p (2008: 35.2p) and 
17.5p (2008: 34.1p) respectively.
Dividend
As a result of the lower than expected profit performance this year 
and the decision to reduce our borrowings over the medium term, 
the Board has decided not to pay a dividend for the year ended 
30th June 2009 (2008: 2.25 pence per ordinary share).
Halo Foods
The revelation in June that Halo Foods had been understating its 
costs by material amounts was an unwelcome event in an already 
challenging year. More details of the issues are found in the Chief 
Executive’s Review. However, since June an independent review 
of accounting and reporting processes has reassured us that this 
was an isolated incident. Nevertheless, as a consequence we 
have reviewed and adjusted where appropriate our internal control 
procedures across the Group to reduce the likelihood of it ever
happening again, and begun quickly the process of rebuilding 
profitability with almost immediate effect.
Banking
The reported reduction in profits for the year to 30th June 2009 has 
resulted in the need for us to renegotiate our banking facilities and
delay our preliminary results announcement. These negotiations 
have now been concluded, the details of which are covered in the 
Finance Director’s Report. The Executive team has negotiated hard in 
a difficult financial climate to bring about the amended banking terms 
but, with an amended three year facility agreement due to be in place 
in the near future, it can now return to its main priority to develop

the Group. Sentiment has changed markedly in relation to what 
borrowing levels are appropriate but, despite this, it is clear that we 
have strong support from our bankers.
Management and Board
After seven years as Chairman of Glisten I am stepping down from 
the Board at the Annual General Meeting in December 2009. The 
process of choosing my successor has been managed by Angela 
Megson who chairs our Remuneration Committee and we will be 
announcing my successor once details of the appointment have 
been finalised. The Glisten business has grown considerably since 
Paul Simmonds, Rob Davies and I floated the Company in June 
2002 and today produces an exciting range of tasty, whilst healthy, 
snacks. I will be leaving the business in good hands. 
Shareholders 
Despite the significant recovery since March 2009 in many stock 
markets around the world, this has still been a difficult year 
for shareholders as the banking crisis and recession have hit 
confidence across the world. This has been particularly visible on 
AIM where our share price has fallen nearly 75% during the year. 
Our decision to preserve cash and not pay a dividend this year will 
have added to the pain experienced by our shareholders. However, 
the underlying business at Glisten is in good shape, healthy 
snacking has not declined and inflationary pressures generally 
seem to have abated. The timing is therefore right for the challenge 
of rebuilding confidence in Glisten as a strong generator of cash, 
which it has consistently demonstrated in the past. 
Staff
When times are difficult more is asked of all of us and this has 
been very much the case at Glisten this year. On behalf of the 
Board I should like to thank all of our staff for their resilience, hard 
work and enthusiasm throughout the year.
Outlook
We are planning for growth in the year ahead and the first 17 weeks 
of the current year have started with like-for-like sales ahead 13%. 
Although this level of sales growth is unlikely to be sustained for the 
full year we are optimistic about growing our profitability this year.

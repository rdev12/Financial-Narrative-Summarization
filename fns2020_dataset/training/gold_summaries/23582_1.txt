Chief Executive Officer’s statement
Continuing to evolve the 
customer proposition
2014 Overview
2014 has been a year of discipline and 
developments for the Group as we 
enhanced our customer propositions 
through operational and underwriting 
improvements. 
The Group has delivered a solid set of 
results against a backdrop of competitive 
market conditions. The Group’s combined 
operating ratio of 91.9% is a good 
performance and testament to our focused 
and disciplined approach to underwriting 
in combination with our efficient expense 
base. The Group continues to adopt a 
prudent approach to reserving and the 
Group’s reserves remain comfortably in 
excess of our actuarial best estimate.
The UK motor rating environment was 
mixed in 2014, with rate declines in the 
first half of the year appearing to stabilise 
in the second half. We have not been 
afraid to increase rates above the 
market, slowing down new business 
volumes in the second half of 2014,  
as we aimed to protect the medium to 
long term profitability of the portfolio.
I am delighted that we have agreed  
to acquire the outstanding 50% of 
Gocompare for £95.0 million and expect 
to complete the acquisition on 31 March 
2015, with the acquisition funded 
through the issuance of the Notes. 
Through full ownership, we will be able  
to drive the strategic direction of 
Gocompare and I strongly believe  
that there are opportunities to enhance 
the business over time. It will remain 
entirely separate in its partnership and 
comparison service functions, while 
benefiting from operating under the 
umbrella of the wider Group. Many 
exciting opportunities will be explored  
as we look to grow the business over  
the medium to long term, while taking 
steps to further diversify the Group’s 
income streams.
Motor
We remained focused and disciplined in 
our approach to underwriting throughout 
the year and this resulted in a 3.9% 
reduction in Motor gross written 
premiums to £429.3 million. In 2014, the 
continued competitive rating environment 
in Motor was not conducive to profitable 
growth; however, the Group did manage 
to implement targeted rate increases in 
Motor as it looked to mitigate the impact 
of claims inflation. Despite the 
challenging market conditions in 2014, 
the Group achieved a combined operating 
ratio in Motor of 92.4%.
However, the inherent competitiveness  
of our market – where many participants 
are looking to grow or maintain market 
share – meant our rate increases resulted 
in a lower level of new business in the 
second half of the year. As a 
consequence, in-force policies were 
broadly flat at the year end compared  
to 2013, which is a position I am 
comfortable with, as we get nearer to  
a potential upturn in the rating cycle. 
The Group’s segment re-entry 
programme, where the Group has 
re-entered segments of the market that 
it had previously exited, continues to 
perform well and has provided great 
insight into further opportunities available 
to the Group across the wider motor 
market. A number of additional 
underwriting initiatives were rolled out on 
a ‘test and learn’ basis in 2014, as the 
Group looks to expand its quote footprint 
over the medium to long term. The 
performance of these new segments has 
been encouraging and further initiatives 
will be rolled out in 2015, as we look to 
grow outside our core segments.

Home 
In Home, we have continued to grow  
our portfolio, albeit at a slower rate than 
in previous years. The rating environment 
has been challenging, as in Motor, but  
we have remained disciplined in our 
approach to underwriting and only 
reduced rates to a level where we believe 
we can make an acceptable contribution 
to the Group.
We have delivered a combined operating 
ratio of 89.9% and this is testament to 
our good risk selection and efficient 
expense base. 
The Group remains well-placed to  
benefit from any shift in consumer  
buying behaviour towards price 
comparison websites as consumers  
look to obtain a more competitive rate 
for their home insurance.
People
The Group continues to benefit from our 
nimble, focused and adaptable approach. 
All my colleagues throughout the 
Business use their skill and expertise to 
service our customers, as we all work to 
deliver the Group’s strategic objectives. 
During the year, we have welcomed to 
the Group two new executive members, 
with David Pitt and Helen Taylor taking 
on the roles of Chief Operating Officer 
and HR Director, respectively. I am 
delighted to have them both in my 
management team and we are already 
seeing the benefits of their expertise, 
enthusiasm, drive and fresh ideas, as we 
look to push the Business forward. I 
would also like to take this opportunity to 
thank Gordon Hannah, who has retired, 
and Carole Timms, who has left us, for 
their hard work and dedication during 
their time with the Group; and I wish 
them both all the best for the future.
In 2014, 95% of my colleagues in the 
Business completed a customer focused 
training programme called OPEN. This is  
a key stage in our mission to keep our 
customers firmly at the heart of all we do.
Our commitment to our people enables 
us to deliver a quality of service that I 
believe sets us apart from the 
competition. The drive from my 
colleagues to 
understand our 
customers’ needs  
– and their desire to 
help those customers 
– really does give us an 
edge in a competitive 
market and there is 
more to come here too! 
Customers
During 2014, a number of customer 
initiatives were rolled out across the 
Group, including The Voice of the 
Customer. This is a system of feedback 
loops which will allow us to identify better 
what our customers like about our 
Business and what they don’t like, 
helping us to improve continuously.
The Group achieved a customer retention 
rate of 78% in 2014, which is testament 
to our commitment to provide 
competitively priced products and 
excellent customer service. 
In August 2014, the Group launched an 
Alternative Business Structure (“ABS”),  
in partnership with one of the UK’s 
leading law firms, Irwin Mitchell, 
enhancing the customer experience for 
those unfortunate enough to be involved 
in an accident.
Outlook
We have made a positive start to 2015 
and expect to achieve modest growth  
in in-force policies and gross written 
premiums in the first quarter. We expect 
the combined operating ratio trend  
in 2014 to continue into 2015 largely 
reflecting ongoing claims inflation.  
The Group continues to enhance its 
underwriting and customer platforms  
and remains well positioned for further 
growth when market conditions permit.
We have received Competition and 
Markets Authority clearance to proceed 
with the acquisition of Gocompare and 
expect to complete the acquisition on  
31 March 2015. We will invest in 
Gocompare to take advantage of the 
significant opportunities available in  
the medium term.
Summary
In summary, 2014  
has been a year of 
challenges from a 
market perspective,  
but also a year of 
developments. While 
competition never 
ceases in our market, 
there is much we can do to help 
ourselves to serve our customers and 
colleagues even better. We are delivering 
on this.
I would like to end by thanking all our 
customers for their continued support 
and all our colleagues in the Business  
for their dedication and hard work 
throughout 2014. 
Thank you!

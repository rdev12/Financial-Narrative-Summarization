Chairman’s statement 
 
I am pleased to announce the 2008 full year results for Weatherly International and to provide an update of the 
company’s activities since the year end. It has been a very challenging period for the company and the mining industry in 
general, with volatile commodity prices, lack of liquidity and energy shortages affecting the entire southern and central 
African mining industry. It is also regrettable that the continuing fall in copper prices post year end has led to Weatherly’s 
decision to suspend mining operations and place them on a care and maintenance basis especially since management 
had, by the end of the financial year, put in place measures to deal with the power crisis in southern Africa. However, the 
creation of Namibia Custom Smelters as a standalone enterprise has enabled us to continue operating the smelter at 
Tsumeb to process imported concentrates.  
 
Results 
 
Primarily as a result of the finalisation of new tolling agreements to process third party concentrates, Weatherly recorded 
revenue of US$105.5 million, a significant increase compared to US$63.1 million in 2007. Gross profit was US$5.1 
million, compared to US$ 7.21 million in 2007, which reflected both increased production costs and shutdowns caused by 
power shortages over the year. The company recorded a net loss of US$54.07 million, or US 13.15 cents per share, 
including an impairment charge of US$ 50.84 million relating to the Kombat mine and other mining assets. The company 
had US$5.4 million cash in the bank as at 30 June 2008. 
 
Following the impairment of assets and the weakening of the rand against the US dollar, net asset value per share 
decreased from US 27.19 cents to US 14.15 cents year on year.  
 
Developments during the year  
 
Weatherly’s focus during the year to 30 June 2008 was to make mining operations cash flow positive, and this was 
achieved with operating activities generating net cash of US$3.7 million. In the course of the year, Weatherly invested 
over US$35 million in its mines and smelter. Regrettably, however, the company was unable to reach an agreement with 
the Government of Namibia, NamPower and NamWater to deal with power supply and water extraction issues in the 
Otavi Valley. As a result, the Board took the decision to write off the Kombat mine, with a US$ 22.1 million impairment 
including the costs associated with closure, severance packages for employees, and placement of the mine town on a 
care and maintenance basis.  
 
 A new subsidiary, Namibia Custom Smelters, was formed to reflect the strategic shift from the smelter being solely a 
downstream component of Weatherly’s production to becoming an independent custom facility. It was intended to be 
used to process ore from local mines as well as concentrates sourced through long-term supply agreements with 
European and South American producers. As part of this strategy, rehabilitation of the Ausmelt furnace was undertaken 
and completed by year end within budget.  
 
At the Tambao high-grade manganese project in Burkina Faso, a positive Bankable Feasibility Study was completed by 
Weatherly on behalf of, Wadi Al Rawda Industrial Developments, the Dubai company holding a development agreement 
with the government. 
 
In May, a joint venture was signed with the Anglo American subsidiary, Ambase Prospecting Pty, for the exploration of 
Weatherly’s EPL 2906 tenement in north-western Namibia.  
 
The Board was strengthened by the addition of Alan Stephens as a non-executive director. Alan brings with him 
significant operational and exploration experience as President and CEO of Coro Mining Corp, a Latin American focused 
copper exploration and development company, and former Vice President of Exploration for First Quantum Minerals. 
 
In February 2008, the company was notified in writing that a third party was interested in merging with Weatherly. While 
both groups recognised the potential benefits of such a merger, uncertain market conditions hampered further progress 
and talks were discontinued with no formal offer being made.  
 
Developments post year end 
 
In November 2008, as a result of the rapid fall in copper prices, a full review of its cash resources in progress, and a 
potential claim lodged against the company, Weatherly requested that trading of its shares on AIM be temporarily 
suspended. The company has subsequently implemented an extensive programme of cost reductions, including closure 
of its mines; has successfully secured a substantial long-term loan facility; and has conducted a thorough investigation 
into the potential claim. Following the publication of this annual report and clarification of the matters above, trading in the 
company’s ordinary shares on AIM has now resumed.

The measures taken by the Board throughout 2008 helped contribute to the posting of record mine production in the 
quarter ended 30 September 2008 of 2,643 tonnes of copper, compared with 2,162 tonnes in the previous quarter. 
However, the sharp decline in world copper prices from circa US$8,000 in June 2008 to circa US$3,000 in November 
2008, well below Weatherly’s production cost per tonne of approximately US$5,000, called into question the viability of 
the company’s mining operations.   
 
Weatherly undertook a number of cost cutting measures which initially consisted of the closure of Tsumeb West and 
placing  the Matchless mine on care and maintenance, as well as redundancies at Otjihase and Tschudi. However, 
continuing falls in the copper price compelled management to place these last two mines on care and maintenance also. 
All mine closures were conducted in an orderly manner with appropriate compensation being paid to our redundant 
employees. Further measures have been taken to reduce overheads at our operations office in Namibia and at our head 
office in London, including the departure of our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Craven.  
 
Weatherly will continue to operate the Tsumeb smelter to process imported concentrates under Namibia Custom 
Smelters and has now successfully completed arrangements for an US$11.3 million loan facility which will provide 
funding for the smelter’s expansion and its ongoing requirements and for redundancy payments.  
 
As a result of these rigorous and carefully considered measures, the Board is cautiously confident that Weatherly is 
positioned to survive the current exceptionally difficult market conditions, and to sustain and ultimately realise the full 
value inherent in its key assets when these conditions improve.

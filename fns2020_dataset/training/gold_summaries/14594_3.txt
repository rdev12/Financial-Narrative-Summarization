14.6%
Increase in reported revenue
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report that Spectris achieved a record performance in 2010, in terms 
of both revenue and adjusted operating profit for the year. Throughout the downturn, 
we maintained the focus on our strategic objectives. As a result, our acquisition activity, 
continued expenditure on research and development, strength in emerging markets and 
good cost control have enabled us to benefit more quickly from the improvement in the 
economy than following previous downturns.
Improving customer demand led to revenue for the year increasing by 14.6% to 
£901.9 million (2009: £787.3 million) and adjusted operating profit* increasing by  
79% to £142.1 million (2009: £79.2 million). 
On a reported basis, revenue growth was 14.6%, with acquisitions contributing 1.5% 
and currency also contributing 1.5%. On a constant currency organic (like-for-like) 
basis, growth was therefore 11.6%. Operating margins were 15.8%, an increase of 
5.7 percentage points compared with the prior year.
The growth in operating profit was due to a combination of increased volume, an 
expansion in gross margins, and cost benefits resulting from restructuring and integration 
activities we had implemented the previous year. 
Profit before tax increased by 94% to £132.3 million (2009: £68.2 million) and earnings 
per share increased by 91% from 45.4 pence to 86.6 pence. The effective tax rate was 
24.2% (2009: 23.2%). 
Cash conversion was robust, with 112% of operating profit converted into operating 
cash, largely due to a reduction in working capital of approximately £20 million. Net debt 
decreased by £37.7 million from £123.9 million to £86.2 million, 0.5X EBITDA. Net interest 
costs were £9.8 million. At 31 December 2010, the group had cash of £64.7 million and 
undrawn committed facilities of £80 million. This strong financial position gives us the 
flexibility to continue to pursue our strategic objectives.
The Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 20.9 pence, which, combined with 
the interim dividend of 7.1 pence, gives a total for the year of 28.0 pence (2009: 
24.25 pence), an increase of 15%. The dividend is covered 3.1 times. This is consistent 
with our policy of making progressive dividend payments based upon affordability and 
sustainability. The dividend will be paid on 24 June 2011 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 3 June 2011.
We are very pleased with the group’s  
performance in 2010, with trading exceeding our 
expectations across all four business segments.

Board changes
Having served for six years as a non-executive director, Anthony Reading retired at the 
conclusion of the AGM in May 2010. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank him 
for his contribution to the group and his chairmanship of the remuneration committee. 
I would also like to welcome Russell King, who joined the Board as a non-executive 
director on 20 October 2010 and assumes the role of chairman of the remuneration 
committee. Russell was previously chief strategy officer of Anglo American PLC and is a 
non-executive director of Aggreko plc. 
Outlook
Spectris recovered quickly from the economic downturn and made excellent progress in 
2010, with trading exceeding our expectations across all four business segments. Looking 
ahead, we expect a return to more normal sales growth during 2011 and we will continue 
to pursue our strategy of investing in new products and applications, seeking acquisition 
opportunities and expanding our market positions and regional presence. As a result,  
the Board believes Spectris is well positioned for further progress in 2011.

Process plant
The Sukari plant processed 11.6 million tonnes (“Mt”) of 
ore in 2016, a 9% increase on the prior year (2015: 10.6Mt). 
The total annual processed tonnes were 5% above our base 
case forecast plant throughput of 11.0 million tonnes per 
annum (“Mtpa”) and metallurgical recoveries of 89.4% were 
an increase on 88.8% in 2015. This performance reflected 
the ongoing improvements in productivity as the various 
areas of the operation were further optimised.
Open pit
The open pit delivered 62.2Mt of total material movement 
in 2016, an increase of 8% on the prior year (2015: 57.8Mt). 
This increase was related to improved mining productivity 
and equipment utilisation. The average mined grade of 
0.93g/t was below the reserve average of 1.03g/t.

THE LOCATION OF THE SUKARI GOLD MINE
Centamin remained focused on its drive for productivity and 
efficiency at the Sukari Gold Mine and ongoing optimisation  
of the processing and mining operations offers scope for 
further increases in productivity and production growth.

Underground
Ore production from the underground mine was 1.02Mt, 
a decrease of 12% on the prior year (2015: 1.16Mt), 
at an average head grade of 9.0g/t, a 40% increase 
on 2015 (6.5g/t). 
A total of 7,880m of development was completed, of 
which 6,051m was mineralised (4,003m in the Amun area, 
and 2,048m in the Ptah area) and associated with stoping 
blocks to be mined over the coming years.

Processing
Plant throughput: current forecast processing rates of 
11.75Mtpa, with potential to exceed a throughput of 
12Mtpa with ongoing process optimisation.
Plant recovery: current forecast metallurgical recoveries of 
89.75%, with potential to sustain circa 90% with ongoing 
process optimisation.
Open pit
Fleet capacity: the mining fleet has total capacity above 
current forecast rates of 66.5Mtpa and therefore offers the 
potential to further improve scheduling of open pit ore.
Underground
Infrastructure capacity: current forecast ore mining rates 
of 1.0Mtpa, with potential to reach circa 1.5Mtpa from the 
existing Amun/Ptah declines as development progresses.
Cleopatra decline: new decline within the north-eastern 
region of Sukari Hill, aimed at developing infrastructure 
with the capacity to support mining rates of up to 1Mtpa. 
Ultimate production rates will depend on results from the 
ongoing exploration drilling programme.

Sukari exploration
Drilling from underground remains a focus of the Sukari 
exploration programme as ongoing development improves 
access to test the potential high-grade extensions of the 
deposit. The Sukari Hill ore body has not yet been closed 
off at depth and further underground drilling will take place 
during 2017 from the Amun and Ptah declines.
During the second half of 2016 we began development of a 
new exploration decline within the north-eastern Cleopatra 
zone of Sukari Hill. The initial project is aimed at developing 
infrastructure with the capacity to support mining rates of up 
to one million tonnes per annum from this area, which would 
be in addition to the current underground ore production 
from the Amun and Ptah declines. Ultimate production 
rates will depend on future results from the development 
and exploration drilling programme.
Within the wider 160km
2
 Sukari exploitation lease, 
a number of additional prospect areas have been 
identified by reconnaissance field work, including 
geophysical/geochemical surveys and first-pass drilling. 
These prospects offer the potential for satellite deposits 
to feed the existing processing plant with both high-grade 
and low-grade (bulk tonnage) ore. Exploration at these 
prospects is ongoing.

Côte d’Ivoire
Centamin has been progressing exploration work 
significantly in Côte d’Ivoire during 2016, conducting 
both regional reconnaissance and first-pass ground 
work, combined with detailed prospect scale drilling. 
We have circa 2,334km

 licence area in Côte d’Ivoire 
and circa 2,489km

 under application. A new discovery 
has been made at the Doropo Project in north-east 
Côte d’Ivoire, covering five prospects within a 5km radius, 
with a maiden resource estimate of 0.3Moz indicated 
at a grade of 1.6g/t and 1.0Moz inferred at a grade of 
1.3g/t. The resource, using a 0.5g/t cut-off, is summarised 
in the table below and further detail can be found in the 
operational review. Exploration during 2017 will be aimed 
at increasing and upgrading this resource, in addition to 
identifying and drilling new prospects.

During 2016, the exploration programme involved 
systematic drill-testing of numerous targets along the 
160km strike length of greenstone belt contained within 
our extensive 2,200km
2
 licence holding. This led to the 
prioritisation of two key prospect areas, Wadaradoo and 
Napelapera. Further drilling is planned during 2017, 
focusing on both infill and extension drilling of the 
multiple resource development targets within these areas.
• The table shows a summary of the February 2013 
resource estimate using a cut-off of 0.5g/t Au.
• The Konkera February 2013 resource estimate was

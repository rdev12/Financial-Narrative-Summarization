performance analysis
Spirent puts innovation to the test. With a concentration on Ethernet, 
data center (including cloud computing and virtualization), mobility 
and satellite positioning, as well as the applications that enrich these 
networks, Spirent’s Performance Analysis division facilitates device 
and network testing, from the research and development stage to the 
launch of communications networks and services. We push the limits 
of these networks, their elements, mobile and satellite positioning 
devices and applications by allowing equipment makers and service 
providers to subject their offerings to lab-based functional, 
conformance and performance testing that simulates real-world 
conditions, before a commercial launch.

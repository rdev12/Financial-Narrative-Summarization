2  “We have delivered another year of out-performance especially within our 
Sports Retail division. This success is underpinned by our core strategy, 
offering our customers a wide range of products which represent exceptional 
quality and unbeatable value.
“Through both individual hard work and operating as a team, against 
a particularly tough comparative which included the UEFA European 
Championships and the 2012 London Olympics, we have significantly 
out-performed the third underlying EBITDA target of £260m set under the 
2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme. This means that the Group has now 
successfully met the first three targets and the Board is very confident of 
achieving the final target of £300m under the 2011 Employee Bonus  
Share Scheme. 
“Overall trading since the year end has been in line with management’s 
expectations with some stronger weeks offset by England’s disappointing 
World Cup matches. Consistent with previous guidance, we continue to target 
underlying EBITDA (before share scheme costs) of £360m for the current 
period.”

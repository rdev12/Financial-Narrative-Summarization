‘‘
During FY 2016 G&H made good progress with 
its strategic goals of further diversification and 
moving up the value chain; we met our financial 
objectives; made a number of strategically 
important investments and have acquired 
two highly complementary companies.
These strategic initiatives combined with a 
record year end order book mean we are  
well placed for future material growth”

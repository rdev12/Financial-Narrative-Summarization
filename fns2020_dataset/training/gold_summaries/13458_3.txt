2 Rightster Group plc Annual Report 201 3
Chairman’s 
Statement
My career to date has been focused on the intersection 
between media and technology, with a particular focus on 
the monetisation of video in recent years. When the 
opportunity arose to become interim Chairman of 
Rightster in November 2013, it was a natural fit.
 
Rightster has achieved an extraordinary amount since it 
was founded, from a tiny team winning its first charter 
customers in 2011, to reaching over 2.5 billion cumulative 
views and flotation on the public market in 2013. The 
proposition for investors and clients is clear – Rightster 
has demonstrated its ability to provide compelling offers 
to the marketplace with impressive traction to date, and, 
with a natural network effect and further planned 
releases of software and services, is poised to continue 
this trajectory.
 
For the Company, the 
highlight of the year  
was our flotation on  
AIM in November 201 3.  
£20.4 million was raised  
and the proceeds have  
been and will continue  
to fund working capital. 3 Rightster Group plc Annual Report 201 3
The online video market is growing rapidly. Global revenues 
totalled £9 billion in 2012 and are predicted to rise to £24 billion 
by 2017 (Informa ‘OTT Video Revenue Forecasts, 2011-2017’ , 
November 2012). There is no more better content format than 
video for engaging audiences, and its usage and popularity are 
set to increase quickly in the coming years. As global internet 
usage and speeds continue to grow, online video is fast 
becoming the medium of choice to communicate news and 
events across a variety of sectors. Indeed, over-the-top (OTT) 
video currently accounts for the majority of all consumer 
internet traffic (60%) and is expected to further increase its 
share in the next few years (‘Cisco Visual Networking Index: 
Forecast and Methodology, 2012-2017’, May 2013). Advertisers 
are hot on the heels of this trend – according to the Internet 
Advertising Bureau, there was a 24% increase in global 
internet advertising spend on digital video from H1 2012  
to H1 2013 on millions of websites across the globe. I’m all  
too aware of the fragmentation that makes accessing this 
opportunity difficult for media businesses. However,  
Rightster enables Content Owners, Publishers and Brands  
to overcome this fragmentation, and access the huge  
promise of online video.
For the Company, the highlight of the year was our flotation 
on AIM in November 2013. £20.4 million was raised and the 
proceeds have been and will continue to fund working capital 
for operations and completion of Rightster’s second 
generation platform, and possible monetary advances for 
clients. The credibility and profile resulting from the IPO is 
sure to propel the business forward over the coming years.
 
Our Board was strengthened ahead of the IPO with the 
addition of two new Non-Executive Directors – David 
Mathewson (previously the CFO of Playtech Limited) and 
Michael Broughton (currently Managing Partner at Sports 
Investment Partners LLP). David brings a wealth of experience 
in both the financial sector and software industries (having 
served on the board of Rodime plc, Macromac plc and 24/7 
Gaming Group plc) and Michael brings extensive knowledge 
and expertise to our sports vertical. They join our other 
Non-Executive Director Jack Barnett and our Executive 
Directors Charles Muirhead (Rightster CEO) and Charl de Beer 
(Rightster CFO). Our Board has developed a very strong 
working relationship over the past few months.
 
Rightster continues to bolster its management team, ensuring 
it has the capabilities and experience on board to execute on 
its strategy and capitalise on forthcoming opportunities. 
Notable hires this year include: Simon Walker as Chief 
Commercial Officer (previously Global Strategy and Business 
Development at BBC, EMI, EMAP); Greg Prosl as VP Publisher 
Solutions US (previously Video Publisher Development & 
Partnerships at AOL 5min); and Sanjay Mohan as VP 
Engineering (previously Senior Director at Yahoo! and CTO at 
Enterprise Nube). These executives join an already strong 
team of executives and employees in ten countries. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all the investors, 
customers and employees that have supported and formed 
an integral part of Rightster’s successes to date. Rightster’s 
journey continues to be an exciting one, and I look forward 
to the opportunities that lie ahead.

Hydrodec Group plc    |   Annual Report and Accounts 2013
At a glance
Hydrodec produces new, high quality transformer oil from globally distributed 
used and contaminated waste oil that would in many other situations be 
incinerated. The Group also collects and processes used lubricant oils producing 
fuel oil products. It intends to develop its existing re-refining technology for 
application on these used motor oils and other industrial oils in order to 
produce high quality base oils.

SUPERFINE™
Hydrodec’s re-refined branded products are 
marketed as SUPERFINE™ transformer oil and 
base oil. The transformer oil, which is endorsed 
by leading original equipment manufacturers 
including ABB and Coopers, meets or exceeds 
international specifications for transformer 
oil, and in a blind test conducted by the 
Doble Laboratories in Boston SUPERFINE™
tested better than “new” refined oil from the 
four largest base oil competitors in 10 out of 
12 core tests for quality. The proven 
sustainability of the Hydrodec process will 
allow for its new, reusable oil to come with a 
carbon credit or offset as a source of value 
and a unique sales proposition – the first oil 
product globally to do so.

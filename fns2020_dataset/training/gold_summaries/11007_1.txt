Marketing
The Group continued to invest significantly in marketing during 2013 
and this resulted in a 25% increase in new depositing players to 
63,832 and an increase in total depositing players of 30% to 84,833. 
Mobile and tablet is now an integral part of the overall marketing 
strategy and continues to grow well, accounting for 36% of all new 
depositing players, up from 21% in 2012. All TV adverts we produce 
have a strong ‘call to action’ for mobile customers and we expect the 
percentage of new customers from mobile and tablet to continue to 
increase throughout 2014.
In April 2013, a new three year agreement was signed with ITV to 
extend the number of nights the Jackpot247 show is aired on ITV from 
four to six, being Monday to Saturday inclusive. This is testament to 
the success of the format to date and reinforces the proven strategy  
of using TV to target new customers.
In addition, and again in line with the strategy of using TV to target 
new customers the Group entered into its first TV sponsorship deal  
in the summer of 2013 with its SuperCasino brand as the headline 
sponsor of Big Brother and Celebrity Big Brother. As part of the overall 
marketing strategy this proved a success and had the desired effect of 
increasing both brand awareness and customer reach leading to the 
decision for the sponsorship again of Celebrity Big Brother in January 
2014. This series of Celebrity Big Brother was the most popular for 
Channel 5 yet with viewing audiences peaking at 4.2 million. 
While player recruitment via TV is still at the heart of the business, 
during the year we increased our investment in pure online digital 
customer recruitment as part of a more diversified marketing strategy. 
This resulted in 27% of new depositing players coming from pure 
online, an increase of 16% since 2012. 
Player retention remains key to the business model and works side by 
side with new player recruitment to ensure the best customer user 
experience, loyalty and in turn player value. In 2013, 45% of net 
revenue came from players who had an account for more than 12 
months, up from 41% in 2012. 
Acquisition
On 31 October 2013, the Group bought Vernons.com, the e-gaming 
division of Sportech plc. Vernons.com operates online casino, bingo 
and sportsbook. The acquisition includes the brand, customer 
database and various other gaming assets. These assets were 
purchased through the Group’s subsidiary NetplayTV Group Limited in 
Alderney for a total consideration of £3 million which was satisfied by 
existing cash balances.
 
This acquisition provides significant synergy opportunities. With 
further product differentiation it will enable cross marketing of the 
existing live roulette TV product to the Vernons’ customer base post 
integration as well as pushing the Vernons’ sportsbook to the Group’s 
largely male dominated SuperCasino database and provide a source 
of new customers, particularly with a view to the Football World Cup 
this year.
Product
The Group’s core product offering throughout 2013 has been interactive 
TV casino via its brands SuperCasino and Jackpot247. With the strong 
interaction between TV and mobile and tablet the Group has been 
continually developing a best in class mobile offering. The success  
of this is illustrated by an increase of 188% in mobile and tablet net 
revenue which in turn accounted for 33% of total net revenue in 2013.
Whilst the primary product vertical for the Group remains casino, with 
the acquisition of Vernons.com brings new opportunities in bingo and 
sports betting. As the acquisition was only at the end of the year, it will 
be 2014 and beyond where the positive effect of these new product 
Delivering against strategy
2013 has seen the Group deliver its third consecutive year of net 
revenue growth in excess of 20% and the first year that gross bets 
exceeded £1 billion. We have continued to focus on our core strategy 
of delivering a cutting edge interactive gaming experience for our 
customers and this has delivered very strong year on year growth with 
net revenue increasing by 31% to £28.5m and EBITDA by 21% to 
£5.2m.
The business has been built on firm footings, is performing well and is 
highly cash generative. With this in mind, the Group is focused on 
diversification both in terms of marketing channels and product 
verticals enabling further customer reach and growth. This is 
illustrated by the strong increase in pure digital marketing, new 
customer numbers and the first acquisition since the business was 
restructured in 2010.

verticals on the business will really be seen. Sports betting is currently 
only operating online, however we are aiming to launch mobile sports 
betting in Q2 2014, ready for the Football World Cup in Brazil. 
All products are integrated with a single wallet now including bingo 
and sports betting. However in Q2 of 2014 all three brands will be 
moving onto the new state of the art version of the Playtech integrated 
wallet offering. This gives substantial enhancements to CRM and with 
customer retention playing such a key part in the overall offering it 
should bring with it enhanced player loyalty and value.
Results
The Group produced a very strong set of financial results during 2013. 
The core KPIs driving the business are new depositing players and total 
depositing players which increased by 25% and 30% respectively 
compared with 2012. This led to an increase in net revenue of 31%  
to £28.5m and an increase in EBITDA of 21% to £5.2m. 
Whereas marketing expenditure increased by 44% as the Group 
continues to commit to driving strong net revenue growth, operating 
and administrative expenses only increased by 28% and 14% 
respectively in comparison to 2012.
The Group increased cash during 2013 by £1.6m to £13.9m after 
paying £3.0m during the year for the acquisition of Vernons.com from 
existing cash balances.
Trading update & outlook
Q1 2014 was a record quarter for new depositing players and active 
depositing players, up 13% to 19,978 and 23% to 37,467 with net 
revenue increasing by 1% to £7.1m on a very strong Q1 2013 
comparative. The net revenue increase would have been more 
significant if it had not been for SuperCasino’s margin reducing to 
1.5% in February from an average of 2.8% over the prior 12 months  
as a result of several VIP winners. The margin has returned to the 
expected 2.8% in March 2014.
Delivering a truly multi-product interactive gaming experience is still 
an important part of our strategy. Mobile is continuing to show strong 
growth and in February 2014 we launched live, real time TV roulette 
streaming to mobile. Net revenue from mobile contributed 35% of 
overall net revenue in Q1 2014. 
There are substantial product enhancements in the pipeline for 2014 
for both player recruitment and retention. The new version of the 
Playtech single wallet was launched in March for our SuperCasino 
brand and will be rolled out across Jackpot247 and Vernons during 
Q2. This enables enhanced CRM capabilities which in turn should 
further improve player retention and average revenue per user. 
The Group continues to look at potential acquisition opportunities in line 
with the strategy to grow the business to complement organic growth.
NetPlayTV is well positioned in its current markets and has strong 
growth opportunities both in its existing UK market and internationally. 
The Group looks forward to building on the very successful set of 
2013 results.

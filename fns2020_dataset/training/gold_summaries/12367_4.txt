Development focus
A core element in our strategy 
for driving long-term growth
Greenfield and brownfield exploration 
has proved to be one of the most 
efficient growth sources for Polymetal 
historically and remains an important 
pillar of our development strategy.  
Our decision to sustain our exploration 
programme and to keep working  
on the next generation of growth 
assets is a conscious strategic 
preference in the current market 
environment, although we have had  
to slow down some projects and defer 
development decisions for the key 
assets by approximately one year. 
In 2013, we invested in both  
brownfield and greenfield exploration, 
with total metres drilled increasing  
72% year-on-year to 194.9 km.  
We continued exploration activities  
at Albazino (including underground 
drift, geotechnical studies and in-fill 
drilling) with a view to converting the 
newly discovered resources to reserves  
and preparing the Albazino expansion 
project for the development decision. 
We have also advanced exploration 
activities and preparation for resource/
reserve estimates and development 
decisions at key greenfield projects 
(Svetloye, Kutyn and Maminskoye) 
which may form the next generation  
of our growth assets.
 
We expect that reductions in ore 
reserves and mineral resources  
in 2013 will be significantly reversed  
in 2014, as we step up our exploration 
efforts and complete feasibility studies 
on several key projects.

experience and technical 
expertise built up during  
the year
The Amursk pressure oxidation plant 
(POX), our state-of-the-art and the first 
operating POX plant in Russiaâ€™s gold 
industry, is now set to give Polymetal  
a unique competitive advantage, both 
nationally and in the Former Soviet 
Union, after successfully ramping  
up to design throughput and recovery 
by Q4 2013. 
However, reaching this milestone has 
taken longer than expected. During  
the ramp-up at the end of 2012, we 
encountered a number of mechanical 
and metallurgical problems, and  
a programme of remedial measures 
was developed to deal with these 
issues promptly.
The POX facility was restarted in  
Q1 2013, with limited daily throughput 
of concentrate to ensure operational 
stability. Works carried out during  
a planned six-week shutdown in Q2 
then allowed the plant to quickly 
ramp-up to the design concentrate 
throughput in Q3, along with 
improvement in recoveries. 
In Q4 the Amursk POX plant delivered 
a full quarter of stable performance  
at the design parameters for both 
throughput and recovery. Gold 
production was 59 Koz in Q4 while 
average recovery reached 93%.  
The plant is now running at 500 tonnes 
per day, exceeding its nameplate 
capacity for Albazino concentrate,  
with the aim of fast-tracking the 
processing of accumulated stockpiles.
In 2013, the successful ramp-up 
process at the Amursk POX plant  
(and related concentrate de-
stockpiling) contributed significantly  
to the increased gold production  
at Albazino/Amursk, which totalled  
238 Koz and exceeded original 
production guidance.

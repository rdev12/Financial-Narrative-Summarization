 The year under review
2015 has brought both good 
progress as well as new challenges.  
It has been pleasing to see that the 
strategy which the new management 
team developed towards the end  
of 2013 and began to implement  
in 2014 has been progressing well  
over the last 12 months, with solid 
growth and improved productivity. 
The strong focus on investing in 
resources where they can be most 
productive is clearly reflected in  
the progress with the portfolio 
rationalisation and better processes 
to ensure the returns and risks 
associated with prospective 
investments and contracts are well 
understood. Our chief executive, 
Ashley Almanza, comments on  
all these matters in further detail 
elsewhere in this report.
The corporate renewal process 
agreed with the UK Government, on 
which I commented in my statement 
last year, has been implemented and 
much has been done to reinforce 
the values that underpin the 
performance of the essential 
services which the group provides. 
“ 2015 has brought both good progress as well as 
new challenges. It has been pleasing to see that 
the strategy which the new management team 
developed towards the end of 2013 and began 
to implement in 2014 has been progressing still 
further over the last 12 months, with solid 
growth and improved productivity.”
GOOD PROGRESS  
IN CHALLENGING 
MARKETS
John Connolly
Chairman
Our colleagues work in challenging 
environments and deliver complex 
services, often in the public eye. We 
have high expectations of them to 
do their very best for our customers 
and to conduct themselves in a way 
which is in line with the group’s 
values and standards. Regretfully, 
there are some occasions when  
our standards have not been met.  
In those cases, the board is satisfied 
that management has taken prompt 
action to adapt our processes and 
our oversight mechanisms. Further 
information about how we have 
addressed some of these issues  
is available in our CSR Report. 
Sadly, 46 of our colleagues lost  
their lives in the course of their 
duties in 2015. The board will 
continue to support fully the 
strenuous efforts which are being 
made around the group to ensure 
that all our employees enjoy the 
safest possible working environment.
The board has welcomed the 
further progress in developing  
the management structure for  
the group’s businesses around  
the world and in recruiting high 
quality and experienced people  
to run these businesses.

Chairman’s Statement The macro-economic environment 
remains difficult and in some parts 
of the world has become more 
challenging. I am heartened though 
to see real progress in all the important 
strands of the group’s strategy and 
across the very considerable range 
of the businesses that make up  
the group.
The board
The board has undergone further 
change during the year and it is 
important that we continue to refresh 
the board’s capabilities, expertise 
and experience so that it can support 
and challenge management in the 
most effective way.
As announced previously, Grahame 
Gibson stood down from the board 
in June 2015. He made a great 
contribution to the group throughout 
his career and the board wishes him 
well in his retirement.
As also announced previously, Mark 
Seligman, a non-executive director, 
also stood down from the board, 
having served for nine years since he 
was first elected. Mark had handed 
over his role as chairman of the 
Audit Committee to Tim Weller 
prior to his departure and so Tim 
has overseen the change to our new 
external auditor, PwC, who were 
appointed during the year following 
shareholder approval. Again, I would 
like to record the board’s gratitude 
to Mark for his very valuable 
contribution to the board.
John Daly was appointed to the 
board in June 2015 and serves on 
both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. John has great experience 
in many of the markets in which the 
group operates; having held senior 
executive positions in Europe, the 
Middle East and Asia over some  
20 years.
Mark Elliott is our Senior Independent 
Director, Remuneration Committee 
chairman and is a member of our 
Nomination Committee. He has 
also been a director now since 2006 
and so will be retiring from the 
board this year since his length of 
service means that he will no longer 
be considered independent under 
UK corporate governance guidelines. 
In addition, Adam Crozier has decided 
not to seek re-election to the board 
this year. 
Since Mark’s and Adam’s departures 
leave a number of roles to fill, and 
because the Nomination Committee 
would like to broaden further the 
range of expertise available to the 
board, an exercise has begun to 
recruit two new non-executive 
directors. We have also announced 
that John Daly will take on the  
role of Remuneration Committee 
chairman following Mark Elliott’s 
retirement from the board.
I would like to thank Mark and Adam 
for their outstanding service to the 
board throughout their time with 
the company and I would particularly 
like to thank Mark for the support he 
has given me throughout my time  
as chairman.
I believe the current planned 
changes will result in a board  
with a broad spectrum of skills  
and a diversity of experience and 
background which reflects the wide 
range of geographies and cultures 
which makes up this group.
Financial performance
The progress made in 2015 was 
reflected in the group’s underlying 
financial performance.
Revenue growth was 4% overall,  
and that growth, combined with  
the success of restructuring and 
efficiency programmes, saw underlying 
operating profit increase by 5.7% and 
underlying earnings increase by 14%. 
Management has continued to tackle 
a number of legacy issues effectively, 
including onerous contracts in the 
UK and accounting issues in certain 
businesses. The effect of these legacy 
issues is reflected in the onerous 
contract provisions and the prior 
year restatement of certain items.  
This is covered in more detail in the 
CFO’s review on pages 96 to 105. 
The board has confidence in the 
group’s performance and prospects 
and the directors propose a final 
dividend of 5.82p (DKK 0.5615)  
per share, payable on 10 June 2016.
With an interim dividend of 3.59p 
(DKK 0.3793) per share paid on  
16 October 2015, the total dividend  
for the year will amount to 9.41p 
per share (2014: 9.24p per share), 
an increase of 1.8%.
Our people
The progress which has been 
achieved over the last year came 
about as a result of the efforts  
of the group’s management and 
employees. They provide vital 
services for the group’s customers 
in what can sometimes be challenging 
circumstances and I would like to 
express my thanks for their continuing 
hard work and dedication.

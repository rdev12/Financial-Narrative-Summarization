Highlights
“We believe that leveraging our expertise in closed end funds and global
markets represents a risk-managed route to enhancing the quality and
stability of the Group’s earnings and is a strategy which plays to our
proven strengths.”
Andrew Davison, Chairman
“In my opinion, what we should be attempting to do is to reward clients
(who pay the bills) with superior returns, our shareholders (who own the
business) with significant dividends and capital growth, and our employees
(who manage the business) with relative security and participation in the
firm’s success. If we can continue to achieve these three goals relatively
fairly I would hope that we will be one of the survivors as many parts
of our industry are restructured.”
Barry Olliff, Chief Executive Officer

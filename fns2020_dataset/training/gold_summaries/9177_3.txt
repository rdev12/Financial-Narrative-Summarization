Disposal of DMG
On 24th July 2003, we announced the
disposal of DMG, our display marketing
business, to Premier Direct Group plc
(“Premier”) for up to £3.8 million in 
cash plus 190,763 shares in Premier,
valuing the total consideration at up 
to £4.1 million. £1.0 million cash was
received on 24th July and the balance 
is receivable in five instalments ending
on 30th April 2005. The retention of the
shares in Premier should allow our
shareholders to benefit from any upside
arising out of the combination of the 
two businesses.
During the year ended 30th April 2003
DMG made an operating loss of 
£10.8 million before impairment of
goodwill (2002: profit of £1.7 million) 
on turnover of £32.2 million (2002: 
£42.6 million). This loss is worse than
expected due to a stock write down of
£7.0 million, during the year ended 
30th April 2003. In the period to 
24th July 2003 DMG is expected to
record an operating loss of £2.5 million
on turnover of £3.5 million. DMG’s total
loss before tax was £44.2 million in the
year ended 30th April 2003, including
£33.4 million of goodwill written off. 
It is extremely disappointing to have
sold DMG for a maximum of £4.1 million
when the Group purchased it in
November 2000 for £33.4 million
including liabilities arising on acquisition.
Results for the year
Excluding DMG, turnover of the
continuing activities, Kleeneze UK 
and Farepak, has grown 6.2% to 
£164.1 million (2002: £154.5 million) and
operating profit on continuing activities
has grown by 19.7% to £8.5 million
(2002: £7.1 million). This reflects strong
performances from both businesses. 
We are comfortable with our interest
cover on continuing activities. 
Profit after tax on continuing activities
rose 37.0% to £7.1 million (2002: 
£5.2 million), including an exceptional
tax credit of £1.1 million arising from 
the acquisition of Kleeneze UK in 1995.
Excluding this exceptional tax credit,
earnings per share from continuing
activities grew by 15.7% to 12.70 pence
(2002: 10.98 pence).
Including DMG the Group recorded 
a loss before tax of £36.0 million (2002:
profit of £6.3 million) after the 
£44.3 million loss for discontinued
activities. Basic losses per share were
74.7 pence (2002: earnings per share 
of 8.5 pence).
The Group’s continuing activities
generated net cash from operating
activities in the year of £12.7 million
(2002: £7.4 million). Including DMG
the Group generated net cash of 
£4.2 million (2002: outflow £4.3 million)
before repayment of £1.1 million (2002:
£3.3 million) of loan notes. Net debt at
the year-end decreased to £16.0 million
(2002: £20.2 million).
At 30th April 2003 the Group had net
liabilities of £8.7 million (2002: net assets
of £26.3 million).
Dividend
Having regard to these results, which
have been substantially affected by the
disposal of DMG, the Board does not
recommend the payment of a final
dividend for the year, which will result in
no dividend being paid for the year as 
a whole (2002: final dividend 6.21 pence
per share; full year dividend 8.36 pence
per share). We plan to declare a small
dividend following the announcement 
of interim results in line with market
expectations in December this year.
Strategy 
Since becoming Chairman in August
2001, we have disposed of three non-
core businesses Tranfood, Pilgrims
Progress Tours and DMG. The Group 
is now able to focus on the excellent
growth opportunities at Kleeneze UK,
through increasing both the breadth of
products and the geographic spread
across the UK and in continental
Europe, and on maximising the cash
generation at Farepak, where there are
also opportunities to consolidate that
market. 
I believe we now have the right
management team in place to deliver
this growth plan. Kleeneze plc

Chairman’s statement
The Board
William Rollason became Chief Executive
in January 2003 and I am very pleased
with his appointment. William is 42 
and has had considerable experience 
in both banking and industry, latterly 
as Group Finance Director of National
Express Group plc. William has
undertaken a fundamental review of the
Group and its future development. Part
of this plan was the disposal of DMG.
Paul Munn was appointed to the Board
as a non-executive director on 
20th November 2002. Paul is Chief
Executive of Dawson International plc
and he has contributed greatly to the
Board. Paul was appointed Chairman of
the Audit Committee on 21st May 2003.
Neil Gillis was appointed to the Board
on 13th August 2003. Neil is currently 
a Director of Greene King PLC as
Managing Director of its Pub Company
and on 1st September this year he will
become Chief Executive of Esporta
Group, the health club group. Neil will
bring sales and marketing experience 
to the Group and we look forward 
to his contribution.
Stephen Roberts retires by rotation 
and offers himself for re-election at the
Annual General Meeting this year and,
having served for more than nine years,
he will offer himself for re-election at the
Annual General Meeting in September
2004. He does not, however, intend to
re-offer himself for re-election in 2005.
Corporate governance
The Group plans to adhere to high
standards of corporate governance. 
As I set out in my statement last year,
and in line with the recommendations 
of the Higgs Report, we have appointed
two further non-executive directors 
to the Board. We fully support the
principles of best practice in corporate
governance and I welcome the final
recommendations of the Higgs Report.
People
We appreciate that our principal asset 
is our people and I would like to record
my thanks to all of them for their support
and hard work during another year of
considerable change for the Group.
Corporate social responsibility
We have adopted a range of corporate
social responsibility (“CSR”) policies. 
To demonstrate our commitment to these
policies we have appointed a main
Board director, Nicholas Gilodi-Johnson,
to be responsible for CSR. I would
encourage you to read the report set 
out later in this document which details
our aims for the coming year.
Prospects
Following the disposal of DMG the Group
now comprises Kleeneze UK, with its
high growth potential, and the highly
cash generative Farepak. The disposal
of DMG will enable us to exploit much
more quickly the excellent opportunities
for Kleeneze UK and Farepak.
At Kleeneze UK we continue to work 
on increasing the number of distributors
and widening the range of products
offered in our catalogues. During the
financial year we will be completing the
move to our new, dedicated warehouse,
which will provide sufficient capacity 
for our future needs both in the UK 
and for any expansion into continental
Europe. The growth in turnover since
the year-end is encouraging especially
against the background of the weak
economic environment.
At Farepak we continue to focus on
cash generation and controlling our 
cost base. We look forward to further
improvements in performance during
the year and the increased volume in
our Swindon site as a result of the
Goodway acquisition. We believe there
will be further consolidation in this
sector and we are in a strong position 
to take advantage of this.
Overall for the Group we are confident
about the market expectations for our
continuing activities for turnover, profit
and the very strong cashflow.

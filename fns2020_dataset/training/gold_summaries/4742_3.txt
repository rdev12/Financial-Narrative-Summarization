 6 Dialog Semiconductor Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Chairmanâ€™s statement
Section 1 | Overview
Dear Shareholders,
I am delighted to announce a very impressive set of results
for 2008; more so given the current economic climate. This is
testament to the passion of the Management Team to ensure
the successful turnaround in the fortunes of the Company.
As I write, the year ahead is uncertain for most businesses
but we are cautiously optimistic of making further progress.
I am acutely aware however that this continued improved
performance has not been reflected in our share price. In the
recent past the Board has tried to support the Management in
delivering the financial turnaround of the Company. Over the
coming year there will also be increased focus on improving the
liquidity of our shares in an effort to ensure Shareholders benefit
from the improvement in financial performance.
I am concerned also to ensure that appropriate remuneration
plans are in place to provide incentives for employees and which
will act as retention tools. This should lead to the objectives
of the employees and the Shareholders being better harmonised.
Last year, the Board put in place the Long Term Incentive Plan
for senior executives and issued further options under the
Employee Share Option Scheme. However, with the current
share price, the Board believes it is necessary to re-evaluate
their effectiveness. These are matters the Board will seek
to address over the coming months.
Greg Reyes
Chairman

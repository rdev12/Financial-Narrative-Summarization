PROGRESS DURING THE YEAR
Higher margin services
SUMMARY
Profit from operations before exceptional items showed a 
considerable improvement on 2010 and signalled the Group’s 
continued success in executing its strategy as a leading UK 
marketing services provider. 
This has been achieved through a combination of new 
business wins, better margin services and cost reductions. 
Organic growth has been complemented by our first acquisition 
since 2008 – Orchestra Bristol and the contract with Proximity 
London for BBC TV Licensing. 
Communisis is making progress towards achieving a double-
digit operating margin on sales (excluding pass through) over 
the medium term. 
WHAT WE DO
The company is an end-to-end marketing services provider 
(“MSP”) specialising in mission-critical communications.
This MSP proposition is delivered from two strategic business 
units:
 • Intelligence Driven Communications (“IDC”) which identifies 
campaign targets, designs messages, measures 
effectiveness and enables customers to outsource 
processes. This is our “front-end”, built on our capabilities 
in creative and data analytics; and
 • Specialist Production and Sourcing (“SPS”) which produces 
mission-critical communications in digital and paper formats. 
Communisis deploys advanced technology to support 
specialist in-house manufacturing and digital distribution,  
whilst managing other activity in the third-party supply chain. 
In combination, this is our multi-channel delivery network. 
The Group operates in an overall market which is attractive and 
fast-moving. There is a trend toward precision marketing and 
both Bellwether Marketing and The Direct Marketing Association 
have recently commented on the shift in marketeers’ behaviour 
toward direct marketing, online advertising and sales promotion. 
There continues to be a growing demand for data, insight and 
services to support digital media. Communisis is also benefiting 
from an emerging recognition that marketing services can be 
outsourced effectively.
Competitive differentiation is built on the relevance and strength 
of the end-to-end offer in marketing campaigns, the depth of 
embedded expertise and innovative capabilities and the scale of 
the Group’s operations. Communisis acts as a trusted partner to 
many of the UK’s largest and most respected brands under long-
term relationships with significant growth potential.
ASPIRATION
The Group’s aspiration is to be the UK’s leading marketing services 
provider with a growing customer-led international profile.
Our target is to deliver a double-digit operating margin on sales 
(excluding pass through) over the medium term. 
T o achieve this, Communisis will flex the strength of the 
combined IDC and SPS product and service offerings and 
pursue the following strategic objectives:
 • growing sales both organically and by acquisition; 
 • extending activities to broaden and deepen our 
service offering; 
 • diversifying our customer portfolio beyond the financial 
services sector;
 • following our international customers into overseas markets; 
 • investing in specialist manufacturing, notably high-speed 
colour digital; and
 • continuing to optimise our direct cost and overhead base.
The Group has expanded its activities in higher margin services 
during the year in postal sortation, in the use of credit data for 
marketing purposes and for e-billing and e-statements.
A number of commercial partnerships underpin these new 
services: with TNT for postal sortation; with Equifax for credit 
data; and with Sorriso, a leading technology provider, for 
e-billing and e-statements.
Our postal sortation service made significant progress during 
the period and now serves 43 customers, an increase of 37 
in the year. The impending privatisation of Royal Mail and the 
growing impact of downstream access provides good growth 
potential in this area.
Four new credit data based products were launched in the last 
quarter of the year and these have already been adopted by 
three major customers.

Since announcing the arrangement with Sorriso in October 
2011, there has been a strong interest from a number of 
customers, including a large international professional 
membership body. E-billing and e-statements will provide 
further opportunities for customers to benefit from 
Communisis’ ability to place personalised marketing messages 
on regular transactional documents, thus improving the use 
and value of the communication. 
Communisis continues to analyse acquisition targets in areas 
such as creative and digital marketing and presently has a 
strong pipeline of opportunities. Each prospective acquisition 
is assessed by reference to its coherence with our strategic 
objectives and its capacity to deliver acceptable financial returns.

Cost reduction initiatives and improved 
capacity utilisation
Communisis has been at the forefront of high-speed colour 
digital technology deployment in the UK for some time. Two HP 
T300 lines were installed in the Leeds facility during 2010 and 
2011 and Communisis has worked with 18 major customers 
to date to realise the benefits of the technology platform. The 
Group has announced a further significant development in this 
area with the installation of two HP T400 lines in Liverpool with 
commissioning in January and June 2012. 
The installation will treble digital capacity across the Group 
and allows all the existing Liverpool production to be migrated 
onto a digital print platform. Consequently, from June 2012, 
Communisis will have the ability to produce digitally about 
30% of its current six billion page output. Centrica is the first 
customer to adopt the technology in Liverpool and this product 
has been in the market since February 2012. A number of the 
Group’s other major transactional customers are expected 
to adopt the T400 technology and access the benefits of 
transpromotional communications. 
The Group continuously reviews its cost base to derive the 
most efficient and cost-effective operational design for the 
future. The operational network has been further rationalised 
with the closure of four sites, being the production facilities in 
Bristol, offices in Eastcote and Rickmansworth and the logistics 
facilities in Leicester following the successful transfer of the 
warehousing and fulfilment activities to Newcastle. 
Communisis’ new offices in central London have now been 
open for a year and are proving an effective base for our data 
analysis and southern print sourcing activities. 
A further phase of restructuring at the Leeds facility was 
completed during the year, which involved the streamlining of 
the middle-management structure and headcount reduction in 
the enclosing areas. This is expected to yield substantial annual 
payroll cost savings.
In the final quarter of the year, Communisis’ strategic expertise 
in purchasing and supply chain management was recognised 
through the award of Gold accreditation by the Chartered 
Institute of Purchasing and Supply (“CIPS”). The Group’s 
sourcing processes, which CIPS Chief Executive Officer, 
David Noble, described as “world class” are vital component 
parts of Communisis’ managed service offering to customers. 
Communisis is proud to be one of only 13 UK companies to 
have achieved this prestigious standard.

CUSTOMERS
Communisis is privileged to count some of the best-known and 
respected companies in the UK amongst its customers.
In 2011 and the early part of 2012 a number of new customers 
were added to the portfolio including Boots, Premium Credit, 
Speedy Hire, Virgin Media, Virgin Money (Northern Rock), 
Nationwide and Proximity (BBC TV Licensing). Collectively new 
business wins in 2011 are expected to contribute £24m toward 
the revenue growth targets in 2012. 
The percentage of revenue derived from the financial services 
sector has reduced from 58% in 2010 to 51% in 2011 and 
our involvement in other sectors, especially consumer goods, 
media and retail, is increasing. 
Larger contracts typically have an average term of three to 
five years and, due to the nature of the work, Communisis 
often becomes deeply embedded within our customer’s 
organisations. A substantial proportion of sales are normally 
provided under multi-year framework contract relationships. 
These arrangements and the mission-critical nature of many 
of the transactional and regulatory communications for our 
customers give a reasonable degree of predictability when 
planning the Group’s performance.
In June 2011, Communisis acquired the trade and assets of 
Orchestra Bristol Limited and simultaneously novated a four 
year contract for the BBC TV Licensing work with Proximity 
London. The process of transferring this work to our Liverpool 
facility has now been completed and the Bristol site was 
closed in January 2012. Service levels have been maintained 
throughout the transfer and the performance of the acquired 
activities is as expected and encouraging.
Communisis’ established position in the mutual sector has been 
strengthened recently with the extension of our relationship 
with the UK’s largest building society, Nationwide, with annual 
revenues expected to increase fourfold to around £10m. The 
new contract resulted in Communisis assuming responsibility 
for a 15 strong on-site team at Nationwide’s Swindon 
headquarters. There are now 16 on-site teams at various 
customer sites across the UK and mainland Europe,  
with a total of 94 Communisis specialists working alongside 
each customer’s marketing department. This structure 
facilitates rapid response and gives immediate access to  
growth opportunities.

International expansion opportunities are being pursued with a 
major fast-moving consumer goods customer. The initial phase 
of the Group’s underlying print management services contract is 
live and the first teams are in place in Germany and Italy. They are 
using Communisis’ technology and experience to optimise supply 
chains for marketing collateral in these territories and the new 
arrangements offer this customer enhanced central visibility and 
control. There is considerable scope to scale this contract in other 
regions as well as expanding it into additional product areas.
The Group is developing its key account management structure with 
two prime aims: to give assurance and visibility on service levels to 
the customer; and to identify growth opportunities in new areas. As 
an example, our work with one major customer, which is delivered 
through three on-site teams totalling 38 people, now includes 
creative activity and digital marketing within its remit. The process 
for new business sales is complementary to that for key accounts 
and ensures that wherever the initial point of engagement occurs, 
“the available market” per customer, comprising opportunities for 
other relevant products and services, is being considered. Various 
software tools are being used to support the sales effort and 
improve its effectiveness so that sales people in the field have better 
visibility of, and build cumulative knowledge around, each prospect.
The “Crusade for Customers” programme is now entering its 
third year and has been successful in raising awareness of the 
importance of improving customer service throughout the 
organisation. Key to the programme has been a third-party audit 
which was first run in May 2010 and repeated in November 
2011. The feedback from the recent study, which ran 40 detailed 
interviews across 30 of the top customers, confirmed that 
Communisis has achieved a significant improvement over the 
18 month intervening period. Moreover, it is now known, from 
this objective third-party source, that these customers rate 
Communisis better than the competition. The study included 
a conclusion that “the (Communisis) brand is also now closely 
related to being professional, passionate and environmentally 
aware” as well as being trusted in the provision of mission-critical 
services. The Crusade for Customers will continue and there will 
be a third audit of satisfaction in 2013. 
Communisis is a significant supplier of chequebooks to the UK 
market. As such, it welcomed the decision by the Payments 
Council during the year to remove the immediate uncertainty 
surrounding the future of cheques by announcing that it has 
withdrawn plans for closing cheque clearing in 2018 and that 
cheques will remain a primary payment mechanism for as long 
as needed. The Payments Council confirmed that it will focus 
on making all payments fit for the 21st century by encouraging 
innovation in new and existing types of payments. The Group has 
significant long-term contracts for the production of chequebooks 
with the majority of its financial services customers and continues 
to work with all interested parties to investigate such alternative 
payment solutions. The Group’s capability in security print is being 
extended to other areas, such as payslips, prescription forms 
and match tickets, so that the resulting new business offsets any 
reducing demand for chequebooks. In the meantime, the cost 
base continues to be managed to maintain margins.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group is committed to providing a safe and satisfying 
working environment and delivering on its broader environmental 
responsibilities. Its performance in these areas was sustained or 
improved during 2011. 
There were 87 accidents including 8 reportable incidents 
(2010 90 accidents including 8 reportable incidents) under the 
Health and Safety regulations. Whilst none are acceptable, the 
number is small in relation to the size of the workforce and the 
complexity and geographic spread of the Group’s operations.
The Group’s environmental record improved with further 
increases in recycled waste from 98.67% in 2010 to 98.92% 
in 2011 and reductions between years of 8.2% and 10.2% in 
carbon footprint and water consumption respectively.
Communisis is also actively involved in supporting young 
people and the wider communities in which we operate.  
Our work with the Prince’s T rust and other initiatives are set 
out in more detail in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report 
on pages 18 to 29.
2011 has been a demanding but successful year on many 
fronts and I would like to thank all our employees for the 
contribution they have made in delivering this strong 
performance.

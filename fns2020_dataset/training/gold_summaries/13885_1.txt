Building the business
Nationwide locations
Our	 nationwide	 network	 of	 service	 depots	
allows	 us	 to	 react	 quickly	 to	 our	 customers’	
needs.	 We	 aim	 to	 provide	 engineering	
response	 within	 two	 hours	 anywhere	 within	
the	 UK.
On call
We	 like	 to	 talk	 to	 our	 customers,	 to	 ensure		
that	 we	 understand	 their	 requirements.		
We	 provide	 telephone	 service	 cover	 364	 days	
a	 year.	
I	 am	 pleased	 to	 be	 able	 to	 report	
a	 strong	 set	 of	 results	 for	 the	 year	
ended	 30	 April	 2010.
We	 have	 continued	 the	 progress	 outlined	
in	 our	 interim	 results	 with	 growth	 in	 both	
revenue	 and	 earnings	 compared	 to	 the	
previous	 year,	 continuing	 our	 12-year	
unbroken	 run	 of	 profitable	 growth.
Performance overview
The	 period	 under	 review	 has	 provided	
much	 in	 the	 way	 of	 challenge,	 whether	
due	 to	 recession,	 pub	 closures	 or	
instability	 in	 the	 financial	 markets.	
However	 Sceptre	 has	 continued	 to	
grow	 and	 develop	 operations	 in	 all	
areas	 of	 the	 business.
We	 have	 maintained	 or	 increased	 our	
asset	 usage	 and	 staffing	 ratios,	 whilst	
continuing	 to	 offer	 unrivalled	 service	
to	 our	 customers	 in	 the	 licensed	 trade	
across	 the	 UK.
During	 the	 course	 of	 the	 year	 we	 undertook	
several	 important	 transactions;	a	 share	
placing,	 an	 acquisition	 and	a	 strategic	
disposal	 were	 all	 successfully	 completed.
I	 would	 like	 to	 take	 this	 opportunity	 to	
summarise	 the	 activities	 in	 each	 of	 our	
three	 trading	 divisions.
Sceptre Leisure Solutions
Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions	 forms	 the	
backbone	 of	 our	 Group.	 It	 provides	 over	
90%	 of	 our	 revenues	 and	 continues		
to	 grow.
The	 division	 is	 the	 second-largest	
operator	 of	 amusement	 machines	 in	 the	
UK	 licensed	 market.	 Like-for-like	 revenues	
and	 machine	 numbers	 grew	 during	 the	
year,	 against	a	 backdrop	 of	 continuing	
pub	 closures.
Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions’	 success	 is	
built	 on	 strict	 adherence	 to	 operational	
ratios	 and	 key	 performance	 indicators.	
Average	 weekly	 rental	 returns	 fell	
during	 the	 year	 due	 to	 two	 main	 factors.	
The	 first	 was	 the	 sale	 of	 our	 FOBT	 rental	
business,	 which	 achieved	 high	 income	
per	 machine	 but	 with	 correspondingly	
high	 maintenance	 cost.	 The	 second	 factor	
was	 the	 significant	 decline	 in	 SWP	 (skills	
with	 prizes,	 or	 quiz	 machine)	 income	
due	 to	 the	 withdrawal	 of	 certain	 games	
due	 to	 new	 regulations.	 Weekly	 machine	
rentals	 in	 this	 sector	 fell	 by	 17%	 over	 the	
course	 of	 the	 year.	 In	 the	 face	 of	 this,	 an	
8%	 overall	 decrease	 in	 machine	 week	
average	 represents	a	 good	 peformance	
in	 the	 current	 market.	 We	 maintained	
or	 improved	 all	 of	 our	 other	 measures,	
disclosed	 more	 fully	 in	 the	 Financial	
Review	 on	 page	 16.
Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions	 continued	
to	 win	 new	 business	 during	 the	 year,	
with	 contract	 awards	 from	 high-quality	
operators	 such	 as	 Whitbread,	 and	
also	 contract	 renewals	 from	 existing	
customers	 such	 as	 SSP	 (which	 operates	
at	 train	 stations	 across	 the	 UK).

Our	 success	 in	 winning	 and	 retaining	
business	 is	 due	 to	a	 combination	 of	
market-leading	 customer	 service	 and	
the	 operational	 know-how	 provided	
by	 our	 experienced	 and	 dedicated	
operational	 staff.
The	 growth	 has	 continued	 into	 the		
new	 financial	 year,	 with	a	 significant	
contract	 award	 from	 Punch	 Pub	 Company.	
This	 new	 partnership	 will	 increase	 our	
machine	 estate	 by	 around	 1,000	 pieces	 in	
the	 second	 half	 of	 2010/11.
During	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2010,	
Sceptre	 Leisure	 Solutions	 achieved	
revenue	 growth	 of	 6.6%,	 and	 machine	
number	 growth	 (excluding	 disposals)		
of	 3.7%.
Australian 8 Ball acquisition
On	 15	 December	 2009,	 Sceptre	 Leisure	 plc	
announced	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Australian	
8	 Ball	 Company	 Limited,	 based	 in	 Dorset,	
which	 operated	 in	 410	 sites	 predominately	
across	 the	 South	 and	 South-West	 of	
England.
The	 acquisition	 of	 Australian	8	 Ball	
strengthened	 Sceptre’s	 position	 in	 the	
important	 southern	 marketplace	 and	
added	a	 strategically	 important	 depot	
in	 that	 area.
As	 is	 the	 Sceptre	 way,	 integration	 of	
Australian	8	 Ball	 into	 our	 business	 was	
effected	 quickly	 and	 efficiently,	 with	
full	 operational	 transition	 into	 Sceptre’s	
market-leading	 systems	 and	 processes	
being	 completed	 within	 four	 weeks.
The	 Group	 continues	 to	 look	 for	 similar ,	
earnings-enhancing	 acquisitions	 within	
the	 fragmented	 machine-operator	 market.	
I	 believe	 that	 there	 are	a	 number	 of	 such	
acquisitions	 that	 could	 be	 made,	 each	 of	
which	 would	 provide	 significant	 benefits	
both	 operationally	 and	 financially.	
We	 remain	 committed	 to	 our	 strategy	
of	 organic	 growth,	 coupled	 with	 selective	
acquisition.
Sale of Fixed Odds Betting Terminal 
rental assets 
On	 19	 April	 2010,	 the	 Group	 sold	 its	
Fixed	 Odds	 Betting	 Terminal	 (FOBT)	
rental	 assets	 to	 Global	 Draw	 Limited	 for	a	
total	 cash	 consideration	 of	 £3.75m.
Whilst	 we	 had	 worked	 hard	 in	 our	
partnership	 with	 Playtech	 and	 Video	 Bet	
to	 roll-out	 their	 software	 platform	 to	 the	
UK	 licensed	 betting	 office	 (LBO)	 market,	
we	 recognised	 two	 factors	 affecting	 our	
ability	 to	 grow	 further	 in	 this	 particular	
sector .	 The	 first	 was	 growing	 uncertainty	
over	 the	 future	 regulatory	 framework	
under	 which	 the	 FOBT	 machines	 would	
operate.	
Amusement with prizes
Amusement	 with	 prizes	 (AWP),	 commonly	
called	 fruit	 machines,	 provide	 an	 essential	
source	 of	 income	 for	 many	 of	 the	 UK’s	 pubs	
and	 clubs.	 Our	 long	 experience	 of	 operating	
in	 this	 sector	 allows	 us	 to	 help	 our	 customers	
maximise	 their	 profits	 from	 these	 machines.

The	 second	 was	 the	 high	 level	 of	 capital

of	 rental	 income. 12 Sceptre Leisure plc

continued
On call
As	 part	 of	 our	 strategy	 for	 growth	 we		
commissioned	a	 new	 customer	 service	
centre,	 which	 opened	 in	 January	 2010.
The	 FOBT	 rental	 assets	 comprised	 751	
terminals	 and	 associated	 customer	
contracts,	 with	a	 net	 book	 value	 of	 £3.0m.	
The	 full	 amount	 of	 the	 consideration	
was	 paid	 in	 cash	 on	 completion,	 and	
generated	a	 one-off	 profit	 on	 disposal	
of	 £0.8m,	 which	 is	 recognised	 in	
these	 results.
This	 sale	 of	a	 non-core	 part	 of	 our	
business	 was	 at	a	 significant	 profit.	
Its	 disposal	 freed	 up	 capital	 and	 resources	
across	 the	 business	 to	 focus	 on	 the	
roll-out	 of	 machines	 to	 our	 traditional	
markets	 in	 pubs	 and	 other	 leisure	 outlets	
where	 we	 continue	 to	 see	 strong	 demand.
Share placing
On	5	 July	 2009,	 we	 completed	 the	
placing	 of	 16,603,400	 new	 Ordinary	
Shares	 with	 Hillroad	 Investments	 Limited	
at	a	 price	 of	 33.1p	 per	 share	 thereby	
raising	 gross	 proceeds	 of	 £5.5m.		
This	 represents	 29.9%	 of	 our	 enlarged	
share	 capital	 as	 at	 30	 April	 2010.
The	 lack	 of	 availability	 of	 asset	 finance	
had	 constrained	 us	 from	 continuing	 to	
grow	 the	 business	 in	 the	 early	 part	 of	 the	
financial	 year.	 In	 the	 same	 period	 there	
had	 been	 considerable	 consolidation	
in	 the	 gaming	 machine	 supply	 market.	
This	 consolidation	 opened	 up	 significant	
opportunities	 to	 win	 additional	 business	
with	 some	 of	 the	 major	 pub	 companies	
within	 the	 UK.	
I	 am	 delighted	 to	 welcome	 Hillroad	 as	a	
substantial	 shareholder .	 The	 additional	
capital	 has	 allowed	 us	 to	 drive	 our	
business	 forward	 and	 to	 take	 advantage	
of	 some	 of	 the	 significant	 opportunities	
that	 exist	 in	 our	 marketplace.	
Lotteryking
The	 registered	 members’	 club	 market	
endured	a	 difficult	 year.	 Footfall	 was	
down,	 with	 many	 sites	 finding	 income	
difficult	 to	 come	 by.	
During	 the	 year	 we	 reviewed		
Lotteryking’s	 operational	 structure,	 and	
relocated	 all	 telesales	 and	 administrative	
functions	 to	 our	 Preston	 head	 office.	
In	 doing	 so,	 we	 incurred	 one-off	 costs	
totalling	 £0.5m	 in	 redundancy	 and	
provision	 for	 future	 property	 costs	 at	 our	
Hainault	 facility.
In	 spite	 of	 this,	 Lotteryking	 has	 increased	
market	 share,	 with	 machine	 numbers	
increasing	 by	 15%	 over	 the	 course	 of	
the	 year.
Lotteries	 provide	a	 valuable,	 tax-free	
income	 stream	 for	 clubs,	 and	 Lotteryking	
has	 the	 largest	 range	 of	 tickets	 in	
the	 market	 to	 help	 them	 raise	 funds	
successfully.
Lotteryking’s	 customer	 base	 has	 also	
allowed	 Sceptre	 to	 begin	 penetrating	 the	
club	 market	 and	I	 would	 expect		
this	 steady	 growth	 to	 continue	 in	 the	
coming	 months.
Kelly’s Eye
In	 addition	 to	 private	 lotteries,	 registered	
members’	 clubs	 rely	 on	 the	 income	
generated	 from	 bingo	 and	 other	
fundraising	 activities.	 These	 indoor	 games	
also	 provide	a	 popular	 and	 enjoyable	
pastime	 for	 members	 of	 these	 clubs.

We	 are	 beginning	 to	 see	 these	 activities	
being	 replicated	 in	 the	 pub	 market.	
Bingo	 nights	 are	 becoming	 more	 popular	
as	 landlords	 look	 to	 gain	 additional	
midweek	 custom,	 and	 Sceptre’s	 sales	
and	 operational	 team	 is	 ideally-placed	
to	 deliver	 these	 fundraising	 items	 to	
pubs.	 Over	 the	 course	 of	 the	 year	 we	
introduced	 our	 ‘Collectors	 Deliver’	
programme,	 whereby	 pubs	 could	 order	
from	 their	 regular	 machine	 collector ,	
and	 have	 these	 goods	 personally	
delivered	 at	 the	 next	 collection.
This	 has	 proven	 to	 be	a	 popular	
service,	 and	 we	 are	 now	 working	 on	
the	 introduction	 of	a	 comprehensive	
catalogue	 containing	a	 complete	 range	
of	 products	 for	 the	 pub	 or	 club.
The	 catalogue	 will	 be	 sent	 to	 all	 12,000	
of	 our	 customers	 during	 the	 course	 of	
October ,	 and	 will	 be	 followed	 up	 by	a	
telesales	 marketing	 campaign	 to	 generate	
new	 sales	 from	 our	 existing	 client	 base.
This	 catalogue	 will	 be	 backed	 by	 our	
e-commerce	 websites	 also	 offering	 the	
full	 range	 of	 products	 to	 ensure	 that	
our	 customers	 can	 order	 goods	 at	a	 time	
and	 place	 that	 is	 convenient	 to	 them.
Outlook
I	 believe	 that	 the	 past	 year	 has	 left	
Sceptre	 well	 placed	 to	 take	 advantage	
of	 the	 many	 opportunities	 that	 exist	
in	 the	 pub	 and	 club	 markets.
We	 continue	 to	 win	 business	 from	 the	
competition	 through	 our	 offering	 of	
high-quality	 service	 and	 market-leading	
products.	 Our	 recent	 contract	 win	 with	
Punch	 Pub	 Company	 demonstrates	 that	
Sceptre	 is	 now	 seen	 as	a	 leading	 machine	
operator	 by	 the	 UK’s	 premium	 pub	
companies.
There	 are	a	 number	 of	 acquisition	
opportunities	 within	 the	 machine	 operating	
market	 which	 could	 be	 integrated	 into	
our	 existing	 depot	 infrastructure	 to	
deliver	 enhanced	 future	 earnings.	 We	 will	
continue	 to	 assess	 these	 opportunities,	
and	 pursue	 those	 that	 we	 feel	 offer	 the	
clearest	 benefits	 to	 our	 organisation.
We	 have	 demonstrated	 that	 Sceptre	 can	
continue	 to	 grow	 and	 prosper	 in	a	 difficult	
market,	 and	 we	 remain	 confident	 that	 we	
can	 continue	 to	 do	 so	 in	 the	 coming	 year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Overview
In 2015, the Group built upon the inflexion point reached  
in 2014, with (‘ARR’) for StatPro Revolution reaching  
£7.8 million, up from £5.4 million (in constant currency)  
and was 27% of total Group ARR (2014: 18%). 
With the addition of Investor Analytics (‘IA’) in January 2016, 
StatPro’s cloud services amount to £11.1 million and represent 
34% of ARR on a pro forma basis. 
Importantly, key measures of StatPro Revolution
performance were very strong in 2015. ARR increased by 
46% (2014: 68%), the order book grew by 57% (2014: 70%) 
and the average revenue per client grew 67% (2014: 37%). 
One of the key metrics used by SaaS businesses is to 
estimate the costs of acquiring each customer (Cost of 
Acquiring Customers or ‘CAC’) and compare that with the 
Lifetime Value of the customer contracts (Lifetime Value  
or ‘LTV’). StatPro’s LTV/CAC ratio rose to 16.1 (2014: 11.3).
StatPro revenues were £30.19 million in 2015 (2014: £32.02 
million). As expected, professional services revenue was 
lower in 2015 at £1.64 million (2014: £2.76 million) reflecting 
the lower cost of implementing StatPro Revolution for its 
clients. Whilst revenue from services was lower, the Group 
generated more sales of recurring revenue. 
During 2015, sterling’s strength reduced Group revenues by 
about 5% versus 2014, which impacted the Group’s profit. 
Following the acquisition of IA, about 18% of the Group’s ARR 
is sterling-based and about 36% is US dollar-based, on a  
pro forma basis.
The Board is recommending that the full year dividend is 
maintained at 2.9p per share (2014: 2.9p).

Strategy 
Having positioned StatPro early as a true cloud-based 
service, the Group has developed a significant commercial 
advantage in its market. It is not possible to repurpose 
traditional software as a multi-tenant software service nor  
is it easy to build the vast range of functionality from scratch 
to meet the needs of the increasingly demanding asset 
management industry. 
The Group’s collective knowledge across many markets in 
multiple analytics disciplines has helped build a very broad 
range of highly sophisticated analytics, designed to suit 
the needs of all types of asset managers across all the 
major markets. 
Over the last 20 years, the requirements of the asset 
management industry have expanded hugely, significantly 
increasing the cost of doing business whilst at the same time 
increased competition has applied pressure on fee income. 
This combination of anticipating the market dynamics and 
positioning the Group’s products to offer the most 
productive and efficient services to its clients has always 
been the focus. In common with many rapidly maturing 
markets, the cost of entering the performance and risk 
analytics market is growing. StatPro believes that it has a 
sustainable technology lead in its market and is benefiting 
from its early investment, which has helped provide 
enhanced functionality for its clients.
As part of the Group’s strategy, StatPro also anticipates that 
it will make further acquisitions. Having created StatPro 
Revolution as the upgrade for StatPro Seven, StatPro 
Revolution could also be the upgrade for a number of other 
products in the market. The investment cost of moving to the 
next generation of technology is now so high that it makes 
more sense for some companies to sell their valuable client 
base rather than take the development and investment risk.
The Group has developed a 
significant commercial advantage  
in its market. 13
The unique capabilities of StatPro Revolution Performance 
are its unprecedented scalability and speed as well as
the rich data management facilities.

Current trading and outlook
The Group’s forward order book is now £36.6 million, of which 
£14.7 million is from StatPro Revolution. Trading in 2016 has 
started well and the Group expects another year of good 
growth in sales of StatPro Revolution. 
With the forthcoming release of StatPro Revolution 
Performance, StatPro will continue the process of moving its 
many clients of StatPro Seven onto StatPro Revolution. 
As the Group moves closer towards becoming a business 
with the majority of its revenues derived from the cloud, 
StatPro anticipates that its operating margins and cash 
generation will improve.
Operational review
StatPro Revolution is sold on a per portfolio basis with four 
service levels (Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze). Upsells of 
additional portfolios or higher service levels require little or 
no implementation, demonstrate that the client is happy with 
the service and improve the marginal profitability of each 
client. Upsells to existing StatPro Revolution clients 
represented 44% of new StatPro Revolution sales. 
In 2015, the Group migrated all the functionality of the 
StatPro Seven Risk Management Module (‘SRM’) to StatPro 
Revolution to create the Advanced Risk Management module 
(‘ARM’) and added some significant new functionality not 
available in SRM. As a result, the Group anticipates moving 
most of its SRM clients to StatPro Revolution during the 
course of 2016. 
The acquisition of IA will enhance this move as the Group 
expects that many of its existing clients will see the 
combination of IA and ARM as one of the most complete  
risk services available in the market.
During 2016, StatPro will release StatPro Revolution 
Performance. This is the core module that manages 
transaction-based performance and enables the complete 
conversion of all its StatPro Seven clients to StatPro 
Revolution. The unique capabilities of StatPro Revolution 
Performance are its unprecedented scalability and speed  
as well as the rich data management facilities. 
The release of StatPro Revolution Performance will mark  
the end of an eight-year investment process to redevelop  
all the Group’s performance and risk capabilities in the new 
technology of the cloud. As a result, whilst there will always 
be a need to innovate, StatPro anticipates that its 
development costs as a percentage of revenues will begin  
to reduce over time.
Development in 2015 was focused on delivering the 
Advanced Risk Management module to enable the 
conversion of its SRM clients to StatPro Revolution. The 
Group also added significant functionality to its Compliance 
module for AIFMD and UCITS IV. StatPro will add IA to this risk 
platform during 2016 and in the process create one of the 
most complete and cost effective risk solutions available 
today in the market. This will make risk one of StatPro’s key 
sales themes for 2016.
In addition, StatPro has also been working on the high 
performance Hadoop
®
 platform for StatPro Revolution. This 
new platform will enable the Group to calculate performance 
and risk for the largest of portfolios in much the same time 
as StatPro does for smaller portfolios thanks to parallel 
processing using the ‘map-reduce’ process. This new 
calculation platform will be the basis of the benchmark 
management and fixed income attribution modules. StatPro 
expects to see significant improvement in calculation times 
as a result.
StatPro Revolution Performance remains on track to be 
released to clients in the second half of the year. The Group has 
a number of clients that are working with it integrating their data 
to test the system. These tests are going well and the Group 
expects to be engaged in a number of projects to implement 
StatPro Revolution Performance as soon as it is released.

ADVANCED RISK MANAGEMENT
We made risk management a key focus of new functionality 
in 2015. We added over 140 new risk measures, introduced 
new relative and risk attribution analysis, and released  
a new risk simulation framework and on-demand stress 
testing. We also added support for the new Australian 
APRA standard risk measure, being the first vendor to  
offer a turn-key solution for this new regulation.

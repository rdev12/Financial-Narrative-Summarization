 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 04
The 2007 ﬁnancial year was a signiﬁcant 
year for ACM; the underlying business 
has grown strongly. In December 2006, 
ACM reached an important milestone when 
it listed on AIM, a market operated by the 
London Stock Exchange. Our shares were 
oversubscribed on the IPO and have since 
been well supported by our institutional 
investors. Furthermore, on 30 March 2007 
we were very pleased to become a member 
of the London Tanker Brokers’ Panel Ltd 
and Worldscale Association (London) Ltd, 
an independent and impartial authority 
which provides a variety of rate assessments 
on a fee paying basis for individual oil 
companies, traders, tanker operators 
and other interests worldwide.
Results
Our core revenue from ship broking increased 
in US dollar terms by 8.4% to $25.6 million 
(2006: $23.6 million). We ﬁxed a record 
number of ships and our forward income 
from time charters as at 31 March 2007 
has increased during the year in value by 
78% compared to the same time last year. 
Our joint venture and associated activities 
provided a solid contribution of £1.5 million 
with ACM Shipping Services Ltd (sale and 
purchase) having a particularly strong year. 
The weakness of the US dollar naturally 
had an adverse effect on our sterling 
equivalent revenues. Proﬁt before taxation 
was £3.7 million (2006: £0.5 million) with 
basic earnings per share being 14.9 pence.
The business has remained very cash 
generative. We took the opportunity to take 
on a modest overdraft facility at the year end, 
in part to fund our investment in the London 
Tanker Brokers’ Panel, but also to give us 
greater ﬂexibility in our cash management. 
Dividend
As stated in our admission document, ACM 
is committed to a progressive dividend policy 
and the directors are recommending a 
dividend of 2 pence per share. This covers 
the period from 6 December 2006 (ACM’s 
IPO date) to 31 March 2007. This dividend is 
payable on 9 October 2007 to shareholders 
on the register as at 21 September 2007.

Board
Ian Hartley joined the Board as 
Finance Director on 1 March 2007. 
He is a Chartered Accountant who has 
a wealth of experience having previously 
been Group Finance Director of Mayborn 
Group plc since 1998. Mayborn was a 
listed company before being sold to a 
private equity company backed by 3i plc 
in July 2006.
During the year we also welcomed 
two new non-executive directors. 
David Cobb had a long career in the 
shipping sector and was Executive 
Chairman of James Fisher & Sons plc 
for eight years until 2002. David is and 
was President of a number of shipping 
related institutes. He was awarded a 
CBE in 1999 for his services to the 
shipping industry. He served as Sheriff 
of the City of London in 2004.
Timothy Chadwick is also experienced in our 
sector. He ﬂoated Benicia Ports plc in 1993 
and grew it substantially until it was sold in 
1999 to Associated British Ports plc. He was 
then Executive Chairman at Simon Group plc 
where he oversaw the restructuring and 
refocusing of the company into a proﬁtable 
seaport business. Simon Group was sold 
to Montauban SA in August 2006.
Employees
Since it was founded in 1982, the Group has 
developed a very successful business with 
an extensive and loyal list of clients. Our four 
founders, who are still with the Group, have 
built up a young and progressive team 
of shipbrokers. It is through the founders’ 
dedication and commitment to the business 
that we have had such a robust track record 
and we look forward to continuing to build 
on this strong platform. I would like to 
extend our thanks to all our staff for their 
efforts and commitment.
Strategy
ACM’s strategy is to expand into an 
international diversiﬁed and integrated 
shipping services broker, whilst continuing 
its position as one of the most proﬁtable 
ﬁrms in the tanker broker business. Our 
aim is to build the right team of brokers 
to penetrate regional markets and other 
shipping sectors. This strategy will allow 
us to gain market share and grow our 
business with existing and new clients. 
Current trading
Trading to date is in line with the Board’s 
expectations. Our underlying business 
is promising given the strength of the 
forward order book and the new areas 
into which we are moving.

 Senior plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004
2
Chairman’s Statement
“Senior has delivered an encouraging set of results, achieving an increase
in underlying earnings per share and a reduction in debt despite the
adverse effects of the weakening US dollar and signiﬁcant raw material
price increases.The Group’s recent automotive diesel programme wins,
scheduled to start production in late 2006, combined with the ongoing
recovery in the civil aerospace market, mean Senior has an excellent
base for proﬁtable growth in the medium-term.”
Senior made further progress during 2004
in building the foundations for an improved
future performance.The ongoing focus 
on better production efﬁciency, process
improvement and enhanced product
development are all targeted at delivering
proﬁtable organic growth for the future.
It is particularly encouraging to report that,
in the latter part of 2004, the Group secured
a number of automotive programmes for
new products developed over the past two
years.The year’s main operating challenge
was the signiﬁcant rise in raw material prices.
Proﬁts were also adversely impacted by the
translation effect of the continued weakening
of the US dollar. Against this background,
the Group reported an improvement 
in underlying earnings per share and 
a further reduction in net debt.
Financial Results
Largely because of the weaker US dollar
and the disposals completed in the year,
Group turnover declined by 8.2% to
£325.9m (2003 – £354.9m) and operating
profit before goodwill amortisation by 
9.2% to £16.8m (2003 – £18.5m).A much
reduced charge for interest and lower net
finance charges for retirement beneﬁts
resulted in underlying profit before taxation
increasing to £12.7m (2003 – £11.4m).
Underlying earnings per share increased 
by 16.6% to 3.65p (2003 – 3.13p restated
for the full implementation in 2004 of
Financial Reporting Standard 17 “Retirement
Beneﬁts” and Urgent Issues Task Force 38
“Accounting for ESOP Trusts”).The derivation
of underlying earnings per share and other
non-statutory information is explained 
in the Finance Director’s Review.
The loss on disposal of businesses was
£13.3m (2003 – £nil) such that the Group
reported a loss after tax of £6.9m (2003 –
£4.6m proﬁt).The basic loss per share was
2.25p (2003 – 1.50p earnings per share).
In the Aerospace Division, the reported
turnover reduction of 2.9% to £139.6m
(2003 – £143.8m) was entirely due to 
the weaker US dollar. Underlying demand
improved and this, together with a continued
focus on manufacturing efficiency and 
the benefit of prior year cost reductions,
resulted in operating proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation increasing by 20.8% to £9.3m
(2003 – £7.7m).The recovery in the civil
sector gained momentum throughout the
year and demand in the defence and military 
sector remained steady.The operating margin
was 6.7% (2003 – 5.4%).
Sales of automotive vehicles were ﬂat in
both North America and Europe. However,
turnover in the Group’s Automotive
Division declined by 5.2% to £122.9m
(2003 – £129.6m), primarily due to adverse
exchange rate movements and some North
American product programmes coming 
to an end. In Europe and the Rest of the
World the Group’s automotive turnover
increased. Impacted by adverse exchange
rate movements, raw material price
increases and supplier problems in France,
Divisional operating proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation declined by 14.3% to £6.6m
(2003 – £7.7m) resulting in an operating
margin of 5.4% (2003 – 5.9%).
In the Industrial Division, the sale of the 
five industrial hose businesses, for a total
consideration of £8.3m, was completed 
in August bringing the Group’s ongoing
disposal programme to an end.The turnover
of the three remaining industrial businesses
declined by 10.2% to £44.9m (2003 – £50.0m)
and the operating profit before goodwill
amortisation to £0.5m (2003 – £2.0m).
The reductions were the result of poor
market conditions and the costs of the
major rationalisation exercises undertaken 
at two of the three operations.
Net debt at the end of 2004 was £50.6m,
a 21% reduction from the 2003 year-end
debt of £64.2m.
Dividend
The Board is recommending an unchanged
ﬁnal dividend of 1.35p per share in respect
of 2004, bringing the total dividend for the
year to 2.00p per share (2003 – 2.00p).
Employees and the Board
Gordon Campbell joined the Group as 
a non-executive Director in July 2004 and 
I would like to welcome him to the Board.
Having been appointed to the Board 
during the year he will stand for re-election
by the shareholders at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting.
The Group’s employees have once again
worked with enthusiasm and commitment
whilst dealing with the many challenges our
economies, industries and customers presented
to us. I would like to thank them for their
wholehearted contribution during 2004.
Outlook
The recovery in the aerospace industry is well
underway with demand for large civil aircraft
increasing and, whilst automotive market
demand remains steady, new programme
wins in the diesel sector, in Europe and more
particularly in North America, augur well 
for the future.The new automotive products
go into production from mid 2006 onwards
and, as previously stated, capital investment 
is expected to increase signiﬁcantly during
2005 as production capacity is installed to
meet the growth in demand.
The Group’s disposal programme, which
commenced in 2000, is at an end and most
of the planned plant rationalisations have
been completed.The US dollar has been
relatively stable against other major currencies
since the year-end but raw material prices
show few signs of declining.Trading in the ﬁrst
two months of 2005 has been satisfactory.
As a result, the Group can anticipate 
a challenging but less volatile environment 
in 2005 with encouraging prospects thereafter
as the new automotive programmes go 
into production and the aerospace market
continues to grow.

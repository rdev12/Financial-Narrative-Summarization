Our performance
2010 was a challenging year for 
JKX with drilling delays in Ukraine 
and construction delays on our 
Russian project. Notwithstanding 
these setbacks, the Company made 
significant progress on its key 
projects.
Average oil and gas production for 
the year decreased by 11% to 10,324 
boepd (2009: 11,665 boepd) due 
primarily to the unscheduled delay 
in mobilisation of a second drilling 
rig to our development licences in 
Poltava, Ukraine. The effect of this 
production shortfall was essentially 
offset by the rise in both oil and 
gas realisations, leaving revenues 
broadly flat for the year at $192.9m 
(2009: $196.5m). Operating profit 
(before deduction of an exceptional 
impairment provision) declined 20% 
to $95.0m (2009: $119.6m).
The exceptional impairment 
provision of $74.6m to the carrying 
value of our Russian project 
is largely the result of delayed 
net-back convergence of Russian 
domestic gas prices to those of 
European gas markets and its 
impact on overall project economics. 
We are now forecasting European 
net-back parity for 2017. 
Milestones and progress
In last year’s Annual Report, I laid 
out two key goals by which we would 
measure our performance. These 
were to:
• Reach in excess of 20,000 barrels 
of oil equivalent per day production 
during 2011.
• Increase production at 
Rudenkovskoye from 2% of JKX’s 
Ukrainian production in 2009 to 
25% in 2012.
We remain on target to achieve the 
first milestone but have moved the 
second milestone to 2013 to reflect 
the current schedule for the 
multi-frac operations planned for 
the Rudenkovskoye field.
We remain confident in our long-
term prospects and are committed 
to our strategy, including the four 
near-term objectives outlined in last 
year’s Annual Report:
• Accelerate the appraisal and 
development of non-producing 
fields and reserves in our existing 
portfolio, specifically at 
Rudenkovskoye in Ukraine and 
Koshekhablskoye in Russia.
• Continue to optimise production 
from the producing fields in 
Ukraine.
• Increase activity on our existing 
exploration and appraisal portfolio 
in central Europe.
• Maintain flexibility to acquire 
additional interests in our focus 
area, to increase production and 
diversify geographically.
The fundamentals of our business 
and our markets are sound although 
we are experiencing some delay in 
turning upside into reality. 
The installation and hook-up of the 
gas facility at Koshekhablskoye is 
now proceeding at pace. Despite 
on-schedule delivery of the key 
components of the plant from 
Sharjah to Russia in January, we are 
experiencing some slippage in the 
hook-up and commissioning 
schedule. Consequently, we are 
revising our target for first gas to 
this autumn. We continue to see 
excellent forward value in the 
Russian gas market and, once 
production is underway at 
Koshekhablskoye, we will turn our 
focus to extending our Russian 
operations to exploit opportunities 
elsewhere in what we regard as a 
region rich in potential.
In Ukraine, we drilled well R-103 on 
the deep Rudenkovskoye tight gas 
field as planned, and the 
encouraging initial results support 
our plans for the multi-frac 
stimulation of the well later in the 
year. Hook-up and commissioning of 
our LPG plant is underway at 
Poltava and we are currently 
scheduling to start initial deliveries 
by mid-year. LPG continues to be an 
increasingly important energy 
source in Ukraine and 2010 again 
saw a sharp rise in the number of 
vehicles powered by LPG.
Our operations in Hungary, where 
we are a non-operator, have 
 
We continue to focus on the 
proven strengths that form 
the backbone of JKX: an 
established presence in eastern 
and central Europe; extensive 
experience of local operating 
conditions; production 
and sales in buoyant local 
marketplaces; and locally-
based and managed operating 
subsidiaries led by skilled and 
committed teams.

progressed well with production 
increasing in Hajdunanas supported 
by the tie-in of the Gorbehaza-1 
discovery. Gas has been tested in the 
Tizsavasvari-6 and Nyekpuszta-2 
exploration wells and further 
appraisal is planned in 2011. The 
farm-in to the Turkeve licence has 
had mixed results with only one 
discovery to date.
Managing our risks
Risk is intrinsic to our industry and 
we expend considerable resources 
and expertise in managing it. During 
2010, we ensured that robust risk 
management processes were in 
place, with oversight at Board level. 
Outlook
We have the people, the strategy and 
the resources to deliver a step-
change in performance during the 
coming 12 months.
We are confident that we will 
commence production in Russia this 
autumn and I look forward to this 
operation becoming an important 
contributor to net cash inflow. 
We are working hard to increase 
production in Ukraine and this will 
play an important role in helping us 
reach our key objective of producing 
20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day during this year. Start-up of our 
Ukrainian LPG facility by mid-year 
will also contribute an important 
value-added cash flow stream to 
our operations at Poltava.
Our people will once again be at 
the heart of our ambitions. In the 
countries where we operate we have 
teams of highly skilled individuals, 
most of them drawn from local 
communities and many of them 
trained by JKX. In the UK, we have 
an experienced senior team that 
has been complemented in recent 
weeks by the appointment of Sir 
Ian Prosser as Chairman. A former 
Deputy Chairman of BP, Sir Ian has 
in-depth knowledge and experience 
of international business, 
particularly in the oil and gas sector. 
At JKX, we are committed to grow as 
a Company and our ability to attract 
somebody of Sir Ian’s calibre 
speaks volumes about our capability 
and intent. 
I welcome Sir Ian to the Company 
and am looking forward to working 
alongside him during what I believe 
will be an exciting, productive and 
ultimately rewarding year. I must 
also express my appreciation to our 
outgoing chairman, Peter Fraser, 
who for the last 13 years has chaired 
this Company and supported me 
through every challenge we have 
faced.

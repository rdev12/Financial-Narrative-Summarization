underlying profits before tax, the amortisation 
of intangible assets and exceptional items were 
ahead of expectations at £52.8m (2008: £89.2m);  
and underlying earnings per share on the same basis 
were 102.5p (2008: 174.8p). overall we recorded 
only a modest reduction in revenue to £2,145.6m 
(2008: £2,374.2m), despite fairly sizeable 
volume reductions in our Partnership Homes and 
Developments businesses.
o ur Construction and Support Services divisions 
achieved record levels of operating profit and 
strong cash balances. Combined order books of 
£4.5bn (2008: £4.1bn) for both divisions reflect 
the award of several new framework agreements 
and large contracts including, in Support Services, 
the £600m building maintenance contract for north 
Tyneside Council.
Considerable effort has been put into completing 
the reorganisation of our housing business during 
the year which, in total, has provided annualised 
cost savings of around £26m. While beginning to 
show recent signs of stabilisation, the market for 
the newly formed Kier Partnership Homes division 
continued to be tough throughout the financial year 
with 1,141 unit sales achieved compared with 2,090 
last year, 59% of which were social units (2008: 
43%). We generated a small underlying operating 
profit in the Partnership Homes division before 
taking into account further land write-downs and 
reorganisation costs, together totalling £44.3m.
in our Developments business volumes reduced 
due to the lack of funds available in the market for 
potential purchasers. However we have advanced 
a number of long-term opportunities including our 
joint venture with n etwork r ail. We also completed 
the purchase of a majority stake in the Kent Building 
Schools for the Future (BSF) l ocal education 
Partnership which gives us access to a further £300m 
of schools construction work, in due course, as well 
as access to further Private Finance initiative (PFi) 
investment and a facilities management contract. 
More recently we have exchanged contracts for the 
disposal of the uK Supreme Court for over £30m.
Cash, one of our key measures particularly within 
the Construction division, continues to be strong at 
a net balance of £92.5m at 30 June 2009 (2008: 
£143.9m). The outflow for the year is attributable 
to committed land payments in our Partnership 
Homes business and to further investment in the uK 
Supreme Court development in our Developments 
business which now is complete and in the process 
of disposal.
The Board is pleased to announce that it is 
proposing to maintain the total dividend for the year 
at 55.0p, the same level as last year’s dividend. The 
dividend is 1.9 times covered by adjusted earnings 
per share. The final dividend of 37p will be paid on 27 
n ovember 2009 to shareholders on the register on 
25 September 2009 and there will be a scrip dividend 
alternative. Maintaining the dividend in this difficult 
economic climate has been an important objective 
for the Board and we look forward to returning  
to a progressive dividend policy as economic  
conditions improve.

prospects
our Construction and Support Services businesses 
are performing well with some strong opportunities 
identified and secured in both the public and private 
sectors supported by the significant number of 
framework agreements with which we are involved. 
We expect to maintain a healthy margin and cash 
position in both of these divisions.
The newly restructured Partnership Homes 
division is now better able to respond to the 
current market conditions with an emphasis on 
social housing provision within a mixed tenure 
context whilst continuing to develop out or seek 
disposal opportunities for the 6,150 plots of land 
with residential planning consent which we hold 
across our operational areas.
Whilst the current markets for our Developments 
business remain tough, they are beginning to show 
signs of improvement and we have a number of excel-
lent long-term projects which will provide consider-
able value for the future.
The new financial year has started well. The 
current economic climate will, no doubt, present us 
with many challenges; however, our businesses are 
financially strong. We have a strong balance sheet 
and good cash resources and i am confident that 
Kier will respond positively to changing markets as 
we enter the new financial year.

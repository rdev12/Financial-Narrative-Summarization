Hunting PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Chairman’s Statement
Our	 Well	 Intervention	 operations	
also	 had	 fine	 results,	 with	 National	
Coupling	 and	 Welltonic,	 both	 of	
them	 recent	 acquisitions,	 making	
excellent	 contributions.
Outside	 the	 Hunting	 Energy	 Services	
portfolio,	 Field	 Aviation	 and	 Gibson	
Shipbrokers	 –	 world	 leaders	 in	 their	
own	 fields	 –	 had	 profitable	 years	 in	
what	 are	 unpredictable	 markets.
The	 very	 significant	 capital	
investments	 made	 in	 the	 past	 two	
years	 are	 already	 bearing	 fruit,	 and	
we	 continue	 to	 add	 facilities	 in	 new	
and	 expanding	 markets	 such	 as	 the	
North	 Sea	 tubulars	 management	
segment	 and	 in	 China.
Earnings	 per	 share	 for	 continuing	
operations,	 before	 exceptional	 items,	
were	 24.7p,	 representing	 an	 increase	
of	 40%	 on	 the	 previous	 year.	 We	 are	
recommending	 a	 final	 dividend	 for	
2010	 of	 8.3p	 per	 share,	 payable	 on	
1 July	 2011	 to	 shareholders	 on	 the	
register	 on	 10 June	 2011,	 giving	 a	
total	 of	 12.0p	 for	 the	 year,	 a	 14%	
increase.
During	 the	 year,	 Iain	 Paterson,	 	
a	 non-executive	 Director	 of	 the	
Company	 since	 2000,	 retired.	 The	
Board	 thanks	 him	 for	 all	 his	 fine	 work	
Our	 year	 was	 in	 some	 respects	
overshadowed	 by	 the	 tragic	 blowout	
in	 the	 Gulf	 of	 Mexico,	 with	
consequences	 for	 the	 Group.	 On	 the	
negative	 side,	 a	 moratorium	 on	 deep	
water	 drilling	 in	 US	 waters	 affected	
our	 market	 in	 that	 area.	 On	 a	 positive	
note,	 it	 will	 become	 more	 important	
than	 ever	 that	 deep	 water	 wells	 are	
fully	 specified	 with	 high	 quality	
equipment	 –	 precisely	 the	 market	 we	
serve.
We	 have	 designed,	 developed	 and	
patented	 important	 new	 tubular	
connection	 products	 which	 are	
ideally	 suited	 to	 horizontal	 drilling	
and	 to	 exploitation	 of	 shale	 plays	 –	
enhancing	 still	 further	 our	 premium	
connector	 ranges.
The	 Well	 Construction	 activity	 of	 our	
principal	 operating	 company,	 Hunting	
Energy	 Services,	 recovered	 strongly	
from	 a	 difficult	 2009,	 aided	 by	 fine	
performances	 from	 our	 US	 shale	 gas	
operations	 and	 by	 an	 excellent	 start	 in	
our	 hands	 by	 Innova,	 the	 downhole	
electronics	 company	 acquired	 in	
September	 2010.
In	 the	 largest	 market	 segment,	 Well	
Completion	 activities	 once	 again	
performed	 very	 well	 with	 good	
results	 from	 all	 geographical	 areas.
The	 Group	 has	 produced	 excellent	
results	 in	 the	 year	 showing	 strong	
recovery	 from	 the	 challenges	 of	
2009.	 Profit	 before	 taxation	 from	
continuing	 operations	 and	 before	
exceptional	 items	 in	 2010	 was	
£50.0m	 (2009	 –	 £38.5m),	 a	 30%	
increase.
A	 robust	 balance	 sheet	 has	 allowed	
us	 to	 make	 the	 largest	 acquisition	 in	
the	 Group’s	 history	 and	 to	 expend	
capital	 in	 both	 existing	 and	 new	
geographical	 areas.	 We	 will	 continue	
to	 seek	 compatible	 opportunities	 for	
further	 expansion.
The	 worldwide	 patterns	 of	
hydrocarbon	 pricing	 and	 production	
identified	 last	 year	 have	 been	
maintained.	 Strong	 crude	 oil	 prices	
have	 led	 to	 a	 boom	 in	 drilling	 for	 that	
commodity,	 while	 historically	 low	
prices	 have	 not	 prevented	 a	 rush	
towards	 exploiting	 the	 new	 methods	
of	 releasing	 unconventional	 gas,	
especially	 in	 the	 United	 States.
Western	 economies	 have	 only	 slowly	
regained	 their	 composure	 after	 the	
traumas	 of	 2008	 but	 Asia	 has	
expanded	 strongly	 –	 such	 that	 total	
world	 energy	 consumption	 is	 higher	
than	 seemed	 remotely	 likely	 in	 the	
dark	 days	 of	 the	 financial	 implosion.
“	 A	 robust	 balance	 sheet	
has	 allowed	 us	 to	 make	
the	 largest	 acquisition	 in	
the	 Company’s	 history	
and	 to	 expend	 capital	 in	
both	 existing	 and	 new	
geographical	 areas.”

s t a t e m e n t s –	 particularly	 in	 the	 roles	 of	 Senior	
Independent	 Director	 and	 Audit	
Committee	 Chairman.
Since	 the	 close	 of	 2010,	 we	 have	
appointed	 David	 Barr,	 a	 United	
States	 citizen	 with	 a	 strong	
background	 in	 the	 oilfield	
engineering	 industry,	 to	 the	 Board	 as	
a	 non-executive	 Director.	 David	
spent	 most	 of	 his	 executive	 career	
with	 Baker	 Hughes	 and	 brings	 with	
him	 a	 wealth	 of	 experience.	
Your	 Company	 has	 had	 a	 fine	 year	 	
in	 an	 industry	 currently	 in	 a	 strong	
growth	 phase.	 New	 hydrocarbon	
resources,	 urgently	 required	 to	 meet	
world	 demand,	 will	 be	 extracted	
from	 deep	 water	 and	 from	
unconventional	 onshore	 plays.	 	
We	 are	 well	 placed	 to	 meet	 the	
requirements	 of	 these	 new	 frontiers	
and	 look	 forward	 to	 the	 future	 with	
confidence.
My	 thanks	 go	 to	 all	 our	 staff	 for	 the	
Company’s	 continued	 progress.

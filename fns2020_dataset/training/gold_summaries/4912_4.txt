WHAT WE DO
Our complete solutions approach is based 
upon expert applications knowledge and, 
where required, innovative coding 
automation software for effective 
manufacturing line integration.
Demand for our products and services is 
created through legislation and mandate, 
typically meeting the need to inform 
consumers, and through providing 
manufacturers and printers with an 
economic means of decorating, 
identifying, tracing, protecting or 
authenticating their products for 
commercial or regulatory purposes.
PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS
Our products are designed to support  
our ‘make to order’ manufacturing strategy. 
Typical lead times for the equipment we 
sell are less than four weeks. Fluids and 
other consumables are often supplied to 
customers next day.
Our next generation of equipment uses 
our unique intelligent Technology, i-Tech, 
which makes production lines lower 
maintenance, lower cost and more 
efficient all round.
We support a global customer base 
through an extensive sales channel 
network comprised of directly held sales 
subsidiaries and third party distributors. 
Every sales channel is trained and equipped 
to provide professional sales advice, 
installation, service and support. 
MARKETS
In 2014, our revenue split by location 
of customers was 23 per cent in the 
Americas, 43 per cent in Europe and 
34 per cent in Asia/Rest of World. 
We have an installed base well in excess 
of 200,000 printers operating worldwide.
Typical customers are manufacturers, 
including multinational, regional and 
national companies, spread across a wide 
range of market sectors. We also supply 
printers of labels, mail and other web

Food, beverage, pharmaceutical and 
commercial printing are the largest sectors; 
combined they represent approximately  
66 per cent of total sales. Our breadth of 
industry coverage and lack of reliance on 
any one or small group of customers 
provides protection against sector 
specific market risk. STRATEGIC

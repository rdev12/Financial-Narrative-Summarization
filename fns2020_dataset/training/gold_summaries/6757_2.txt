 We have delivered a notable increase in revenues and profits in a year 
in which Gooch & Housego PLC has made a significant acquisition, initiated 
a major reorganisation and made substantial investments in facilities and 
product development. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed 
to this tremendous result.

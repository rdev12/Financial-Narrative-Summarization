Annual Report and Accounts for the year ending September 2007
Chief Executive’s Report
It is an enormous pleasure to report a record year in this,
my last year as Chief Executive.
Your Company has made good progress in all aspects of
its business over the past 12 months. Overall pre-tax
profits rose to £41.7m from £32.0m, an increase of 30%
over the previous period on turnover of £209m, an
increase of 20% over the 2006 figure of £174m. Fully
diluted earnings per share at 13.8p show a rise of 30%
from the previous year’s figure of 10.6p.
On 25 October 2007 we paid a second interim dividend of
3.375p making a total of 6.25p for the year against 5.25p
for the previous year, an increase of 19%. As we
announced at our 2007 AGM, your Board are now
proposing a final dividend of 3.5p, to be approved at the
2008 AGM and will be payable on 7 April 2008.

Whilst all parts of your Company’s business have done
well I am particularly pleased to report the outstanding
progress made by our discretionary fund managers. The
increase in these funds and the fees which they earn form
a sound foundation for the future profitability of your
Group. Total funds under discretionary management at
year-end were £10.7 billion against £8.8 billion, an
increase of 22% which compares with an increase of just
8.5% on the FTSE 100 Share Index. Over a two year period,
the increase is from £6.9 billion, no less than 55%, after
adjusting for staff incentive payments the return on our
discretionary portfolio management business would have
risen to £20m an increase of 47% over last year’s figure.
Part of the increase arose through converting from our
advisory service, but funds under advisory management
rose nonetheless to £10.9 billion, an increase of 8%, giving
us total funds under management of £21.6 billion, an
increase of 14% overall.

I am delighted to report that over the year further teams
of highly qualified fund managers have continued to join
the Group and their clients have followed them. We have
significantly extended our footprint around the country,
and were particularly glad to open an office in Plymouth,
thus extending our coverage into the South West, an area
where prosperity has been building rapidly.
Earlier in the year we opened offices in Oxford and
Hereford, both of which have made good progress and
have moved into profitability within a few months of their
opening.
More recently we have established offices in York and
Swansea which we are confident will benefit the current
year’s trading. The York office will move into new premises
early in the New Year when they will be joined by the
personnel from our Scarborough office creating a
substantial new office.
Quite apart from our new offices we have again been
fortunate in recruiting high quality client executives with
their clients, particularly in the London office. We now
have a total of 616 client advisers and investment
managers, an increase of 42 during the last year.
These excellent results have been achieved against the
considerable distraction of the implementation of new
systems and the necessity of asking our clients to
complete the new questionnaires that are required to
comply with MiFID regulations. There is of course a benefit
from all this effort in that we now have updated and more
detailed knowledge of our clients’ circumstances which will
help us to provide a more complete service in the future. In
the meantime we must again thank our clients for their
forbearance for what has been a tedious procedure.

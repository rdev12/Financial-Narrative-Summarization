 2 Chime Communications plc Annual Report 2006   
Chairman’s statement
At the onset of 2006, we redefined the Chime
Group’s vision and strategy, and developed a
three year plan. Before we present our results, 
I would like to share these with you as context
to our performance.
Our vision
To be the modern communications group:
• by being up-to-date, contemporary and 
competitive in our use of communications 
technology
• by being in touch with the mood and spirit 
of the times (be it in politics, corporate life, 
the consumer agenda, etc.) so that our
communication strategies relate to all our
audiences
• by building and sustaining social and business
networks
• by making reputation the most important 
measure of all the work we do for our clients.
Our strategy
Our strategy is to build market leading brands
to answer the modern demands of our 
clients in:
• reputation management in all relevant sectors 
of the market through the Bell Pottinger 
Group
• international branding and communication 
through VCCP and our marketing services 
group
• issue driven research through our market 
leading research companies.
We will achieve this through:
• new product development and start-ups in
high growth market sectors e.g. search and
web-mapping
• targeted acquisitions where we see a long 
term strategic fit and clear opportunities to 
improve our offering
• integrating digital communication into all our
communication plans.
These are excellent results.The company has made
considerable progress across all its divisions with double
digit growth in all the key indicators. This growth is
continuing into the beginning of 2007. We are delighted
with the acquisition of Fast Track, the UK’s leading sports
marketing agency.

Chairman’s statement
Our marketplace continues to
grow and we foresee further
growth in international revenue
this year. Our ability to develop
international work without the
massive overheads of an
international network means
that it is very profitable growth. 
Business activity
The Group acted for 1,157 clients in 2006
compared to 1,069 in 2005. 215 of these
clients used more than one of our businesses
(183 in 2005) which represented 54% of total
operating income (2005 – 44%).
In 2006, 141 clients paid us over £100,000,
compared to 124 in 2005. Our top 30 clients
represented 45% of total operating income
(2005 – 38%) and our largest client represented
9% of total operating income (2005 – 8.6%).
Average income per employee was £104,000
(2005 – £98,000). Average fee income per client
was £68,000 compared to £60,000 in 2005.
During the year under review, 9% of our
business came from digital activity and 
32% of our operating income came from 
international work (international clients and 
work done overseas).
Corporate and social responsibility
The Group has made a commitment to improve
its environmental practices and as a result
became carbon neutral in January 2007. 
(See inside back cover for further information.)
Corporate developments
We have announced the proposed 
acquisition of Fast Track Sales Limited 
and its subsidiaries. Fast Track is the UK’s
leading sports marketing agency.
The initial consideration is £15 million payable
£10 million in cash from within the Group’s
facilities and £5 million in Chime shares.
Deferred consideration is payable on the
average profits for the three years ended 
31 December 2009 and the three years 
ended 31 December 2012. The maximum 
total consideration (initial and deferred) is 
£43 million. The transaction (initial and 
deferred considerations) is based on a 
multiple of seven times average pre-tax profits.
Deferred consideration can be paid in Chime
shares or loan notes at Chime’s discretion. 
Any Chime shares issued to satisfy the deferred
consideration are subject to restrictions on sale.
Reported pre-tax profits (under UK GAAP) for
the year to 31 December 2006 were £371,000
and the four main shareholders of Fast Track
have warranted pre-tax profits for the year to 
31 December 2007 of £2.5 million. It is expected
that the transaction will be earnings enhancing
to the Group. 
Gross assets (under UK GAAP) of the 
Fast Track Group at 31 December 2006 
were £6.6 million.
The four principal shareholders and Directors 
of the company, Alan Pascoe, Edward Leask,
Jon Ridgeon and Jim Glover, are remaining 
with the Group under their existing contractual
arrangements.
As this transaction will be a class 1 acquisition
for the Group under the Listing Rules, a circular
has been sent to shareholders and their approval
sought for the transaction. The financial
information included in the circular has been
prepared in accordance with IFRS and Chime’s
normal accounting policies as is required by the
Listing Rules as these are the financial reporting
procedures of the Group.  5
Board changes
Two of our Non-Executive Directors have 
retired from the Board. We would like to thank 
Dame Sue Tinson and Lord Hannay for their
considerable contribution over many years.
We are in the process of recruiting new 
Non-Executive Directors.
Outlook
Our performance in 2006 was excellent and we
have more than achieved the targets we set
ourselves in the first year of our three year plan.
Our marketplace continues to grow and we
foresee further growth in international revenue
this year. Our ability to develop international
work without the massive overheads of an
international network means that it is very
profitable growth. 
We have invested in our digital/online capability
so that we are well positioned for the much
commented-on movement from offline to online. 
Our results for the first two months of 2007 are
better than we achieved in 2006 and we are
optimistic about the full year. 
Lord Bell 
Chairman
12 March 2007
Our performance in 2006 was
excellent and we have more
than achieved the targets we
set ourselves in the first year 
of our three year plan.
Major new client wins
As a result, the profit and gross asset numbers
stated above may differ from those that appear
in the circular. Any such differences will be
explained in the circular.
We have expanded our representation in the
Middle East by opening offices in Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and Abu Dhabi. These report to our
existing headquarters in Dubai – Bell Pottinger
Middle East.
We have established a specialist office in
Washington DC as part of Bell Pottinger 
Sans Frontieres. 
We have continued to expand the digital
capabilities within the Group during 2006. 
This expansion has included:
• a web-mapping business within the Bell
Pottinger Group which provides clients with
analysis of online communications about their
brands and issues facing them
• an integrated business within VCCP which
offers pay-per-click and natural search 
engine optimisation services, online creative
advertising and an online media buying
capability.
In February 2007 we continued the expansion
of our research division by acquiring a 75%
stake in Facts International, a fieldwork research
business based in Ashford, Kent from Barbara
Lee and Elizabeth Teague. The remaining 
25% is held by the new Chairman of Facts
International. The gross assets of Facts at 
31 July 2006 were £1.2 million.

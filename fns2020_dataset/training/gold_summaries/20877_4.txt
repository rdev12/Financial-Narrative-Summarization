STRATEGIC REPORT 
Our Business

Market Overview
Total UK veterinary medicines market is 
worth approximately £625m, of which 
£344m is for companion animals (dogs, 
cats, horses and small mammals), with 
the whole animal medicines market 
growing by a little over 1% and a little 
under 1% for companion animals  
(www.noah.co.uk).
Market Overview
Annual UK sales volume estimated to 
reduce from approximately 1,300,000 
microchips for companion animals 
(excluding equine) to 810,000 in the 
aftermath of compulsory microchipping. 
Two main microchip database providers 
servicing the UK (The Kennel Club’s 
Petlog ~7.7m pets, Animalcare’s Anibase 
~4.8m pets), with several much smaller 
operators.
Market Overview
This grouping covers a wide range of 
products and consequently suppliers. 
Accessing the veterinary market 
through different channels, for example 
established veterinary and human 
healthcare wholesalers, internet providers 
and ad hoc local suppliers. Accordingly, 
this fragmented market is very hard to 
quantify.

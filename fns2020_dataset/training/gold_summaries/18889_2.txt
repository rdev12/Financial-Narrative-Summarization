We announced an aggressive three year 
investment programme in July 2015 to build a 
better Ladbrokes. The 2015 results reflect the 
need to carry out this significant investment to 
build our recreational customer base. The plan is 
based on ensuring that the customer and sports 
betting is front and centre in all that we do.

Group at a glance Ladbrokes is a familiar name on British highstreets. 
Revenue is driven by traditional Over the Counter (OTC) 
betting on football, horse and greyhound racing as 
well as other sports and by machines.
We operate successful retail businesses in Ireland, 
Belgium and Spain where our joint venture enjoys 
increasing brand recognition and is growing strongly.
Our Digital business is aimed at giving customers  
a great user experience whenever and however they 
choose to bet. With mobile now accounting for circa 
71% of our sportsbook staking our focus has been 
to evolve our product in line with the ever changing 
customer preferences.
Despite a growing customer preference for betting 
online, traditional telephone betting remains popular 
with a number of customers. We also operate a 
telephone service for our High Roller customers.

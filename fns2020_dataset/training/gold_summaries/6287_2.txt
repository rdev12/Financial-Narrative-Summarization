Annual Report & Accounts 2005 11 10 Chairman’s Statement
in May 2004 and the related loss on sale of fixed assets, together
with the costs of closure in October 2004 of the specialist greetings
card finishing department within Royle Corporate Print.
After exceptional items, operating profit was up 53% at £5.63m
from £3.68m, pre-tax profit was up 65% at £5.26m from £3.19m,
and earnings per share were up 90% at 15.2p from 8.0p.
Year end equity shareholders’ funds were £27.92m, up from
£25.62m, giving net assets per share of 103.6p, up from 95.1p, an
increase of 9%. Year end net indebtedness reduced to £2.45m
from £9.10m with resultant gearing of 9% (2004: 35%), reflecting
the £2.65m net proceeds from property sales and the continuing
below normal levels of capital expenditure. Net financing costs
payable at £0.38m (2004: £0.50m) were covered 11.2 times
(2004: 8.1 times) by operating profit before exceptional items.
The Group’s book-related businesses continue to perform well,
increasing revenue by 4% to £14.31m (2004: £13.79m), reflecting
sustained demand. The Group’s commercial and financial printing
businesses experienced a reduction in revenue of 8% to £26.63m
(2004: £28.94m), mainly as a result of the reorganisation of 
W E Baxter in mid-2004 and the closure of the greetings cards
business of Royle Corporate Print later in 2004, both having been
unprofitable activities.
The improvement in Group profitability while trading remains
highly competitive, together with our awards success, has been
achieved by the continuing efforts of our staff and I thank them for
their commitment. 
The directors are recommending an unchanged final dividend
per share of 3.4p, which, if approved at the AGM on 10 May 2006,
will be paid on 17 May 2006 to those shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 21 April 2006. Together with
the unchanged interim dividend per share of 1.8p paid on 
7 November 2005, dividends per share total an unchanged 5.2p,
which is covered 1.9 times (2004: 1.7 times) by earnings per share
before exceptional items.

Chief Executive’s Review
THE GROUP’S PRE-TAX MARGIN OF 9%, up from 8% in 2004,
remains at the higher end of results within our industry and
reflects both an 8% increase in pre-tax profit and a reduction in
revenue of 4%.
This result is consistent with Group strategy of targeted
reorganisation of unprofitable elements of our business and
selective investment in areas of profitable growth.
Operational Review
The Group is managed on a unified basis and therefore reports its
results as one operating segment.
Our businesses which operate in the commercial and financial
printing markets account for the majority of Group revenue at
65% (2004: 68%). In the period under review, revenue for these
Group businesses has fallen by 8% to £26.63m (2004: £28.94m)
mainly due to the reorganisation of W E Baxter in May 2004 and
the closure of the Royle Corporate Print specialist greetings cards
operations in October 2004, both having been unprofitable
activities. 
The continuing pressure on prices within the commercial print
market, driven by overcapacity and static demand in 2005, also
contributed to this decline in revenue. This was mitigated to some
extent during the second half of 2005 by an increase in City
activity benefiting Royle Financial Print, our typesetting and
financial document operation. Fulmar plc

Annual Report & Accounts 2005 15 14 Chief Executive’s Review
Royle Financial Print was relocated within the City in
December 2005 to smaller leasehold premises, more suited to its
activities, and a new typesetting and pre-press system installed at
a total cost of £0.15m.
The Group has enjoyed many years of continuous awards
success and this year is no exception, with Royle Corporate Print
being awarded bronze in the Sappi European Print Awards and
voted “Report and Accounts – Winner” of the Printing World
Annual Awards. Fulmar Colour was short listed with four entries
in the Printing World “Brochures” category and repeated its
success of 2004 by being “Highly Commended for Brochures” in
the 2005 McNaughton Review.
Revenue from the Group’s activities in the markets of
paperback books, jackets and covers contributed 35% of the
Group total (2004: 32%), increasing by 4% to £14.31m (2004:
£13.79m). Following a slower than anticipated start to the year,
demand increased in the second half.
In January 2005, Bookmarque, the Group’s paperback book
printing business, took delivery of a third Timson web book text
printing machine at an installed cost of £1.6m and this, together
with the introduction of a third permanent shift on its binding
line, increased capacity, such that Bookmarque was able to
successfully tender for new contractual business. 
In October 2005, Bookmarque was appointed as a paperback
book supplier to Penguin for a proportion of its requirements,
with the first orders being received during November 2005.
Following a period of high capital expenditure in all our print
operations in earlier years, these businesses are well equipped,
resulting in a reduced level of capital expenditure for 2005 at £2.3m.
Freehold Property
In December 2005, the Group completed on the sale of its freehold
premises in Old Street, London EC1 for a cash consideration of
£1.8m. These premises had previously been occupied by Royle
Financial Print. 
The Group sold, in 2003, a vacant freehold property in Lewes,
Sussex previously occupied by W E Baxter, for an initial
consideration of £1.6m in cash. An additional consideration of
£0.9m became payable, during the year, on completion of the
planning process and this was received in November 2005. 
The Group is entitled to receive a further payment on the
conclusion of the redevelopment and sale of the apartments, for
which planning consent has now been granted. The final
payment, if any, will be calculated at 35% of the gross sale
proceeds of the new apartments above £10.2m, excluding the
affordable housing element. At present, it is anticipated that any
such payment received would be insignificant.
Outlook
While our commercial printing businesses continue to operate in
a market that is characterised by relatively static demand and
under-utilised capacity resulting in downward price pressure, we
have begun to see signs of some improvement since the year end.
This is further supported by increased demand for financial print.
Our book related businesses are operating in a more buoyant
market environment and we continue to win new business. We
therefore remain cautiously optimistic in the immediate future for
the Group as a whole.

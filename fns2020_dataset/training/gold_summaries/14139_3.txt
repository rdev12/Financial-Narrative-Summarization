Chairman’s Statement
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT A SOLID 
PERFORMANCE BY THE GROUP IN 
2011 WITH SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL, 
STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL 
PROGRESS. THIS WAS ACHIEVED 
AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A 
CHALLENGING PROJECT IN RUSSIA 
WHERE THE UNDERGROUND 
CONDITIONS PROVED TO BE 
EXTREMELY ADVERSE.

Dividends
In line with our stated progressive dividend 
policy, we paid a maiden interim dividend of 
2.4p per share in October 2011. The Board has 
recommended a ﬁ nal dividend from the 2011 
results of 4.8p per share payable in June 2012. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, the ﬁ nal dividend will be paid 
on 12 June 2012 to shareholders on the register 
as at the close of business on 4 May 2012.
Strategy
Our strategy remains as set out in our Prospectus 
at the time of the IPO. We intend to maintain 
and build on our existing strategic and technical 
strengths, to expand further into the CIS and 
India and to diversify our offering into additional 
end-market applications. We remain alert to 
selective bolt-on acquisition opportunities that 
have the potential to add value to our operations.
Operations
Management have worked hard over the past 
year to secure new projects for the Company. 
The EuroChem project proved particularly 
difﬁ cult with the adverse underground conditions 
encountered. Various alternatives were explored 
with the client to ﬁ nd a more effective way 
of progressing the rate of sinking. EuroChem 
decided to embark upon its own efforts of 
freezing the shaft and thus suspended our 
grouting efforts in December 2011. We have 
chosen to give advance notice of termination with 
effect from 20 April 2012. 
I would like to thank Alon Davidov our Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer and his executive team for 
their efforts in leading the Group through 
a challenging past year with the difﬁ culties 
encountered at EuroChem and with the extremely 
high level of tender activity to respond to. 
Outlook
There continues to be an increase in capital 
expenditures in the mining sector globally 
reﬂ ected in the very high level of tender activity 
we are experiencing.
We have a record level of tendering activity and 
the potential to win further new contract awards. 
We are performing in line with our expectations 
and remain conﬁ dent of the Group’s prospects 
both for 2012 and beyond.

 2 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
For the year ended 31 October 2009
IDOX specialises in providing document 
management, case management, 
workflow systems, content and web-based 
portals for local government needs. 
Local Authorities represent one of the 
largest sectors of Government IT spending 
in the UK, with an annual investment 
of around £4 billion, according to a 
November 2009 survey by Kable, the 
research consultancy. The market is 
characterised by long-term customer 
relationships that generate strong and 
recurring revenue streams.
As a result of its expertise in software 
development, coupled with a strong 
understanding of customer requirements 
and the rapid return on investment of 
its applications, IDOX has become a 
leading supplier to the land and property 
departments of local authorities.  The 
Group has also made substantial inroads 
into other local authority markets 
including revenues and benefits.
IDOX’s innovative solutions have given 
local authorities and other bodies the 
tools to manage information and the 
ability to connect directly with citizens 
through online portals, such as Scotland’s 
ePlanning web site.  At the same time, 
local authorities enjoy significant 
efficiency gains, enabling them to reduce 
costs while improving services. 
Capitalising on its expertise and market 
leadership, IDOX will continue to 
consolidate and advance these capabilities 
into adjacent public-sector markets and 
into the private sector by pursuing an 
organic and acquisitive approach.
The 2009 financial year saw IDOX 
strengthen its position as a leading partner 
of Local Authorities needing to improve 
services and reduce costs through the 
use of information technology.  Its core 
software and services are now used by 
338 local authorities.  The Group’s strong 
market position is reflected in the fact 
that IDOX beat significant competition 
to win contracts in all of the new 
Unitary Authorities created by the Local 
Government Review who have tendered 
for work. 
IDOX achieved its software sales targets 
for 2009, built a strong contracted order 
book, improved its qualified pipeline 
and increased its level of recurring 
revenues.  However, delays in procurement 
completions that left little time for 
implementation before the year end, 
as well as a shift towards longer-term 
managed-service contracts, meant that 
some revenues and profits could not 
prudently be booked before the end of the 
financial year.

Authorities 3 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Revenues fell by 5% and EBITDA 13% 
as local authorities responded to the 
challenging economic climate and delayed 
IT procurement decisions or opted for 
longer-term managed-service contracts.  
However, the 2010 financial year has 
begun well with the implementation and 
recognition of orders contracted in 2009. 
Tight cost controls and strong 
management of working capital ensured 
that the Group’s net cash position 
remained strong at £3.2m, despite the 
repayment of £3m of debt, the acquisition 
of j4b for £0.8m cash and the payment 
of a maiden interim dividend.  The Group 
proposes to pay a final dividend of 0.12 
pence.

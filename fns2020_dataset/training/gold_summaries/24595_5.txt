Capital Growth case study
Prince of Wales 
The 303-acre former Prince of Wales colliery site, adjoining the 
M62 at Junction 32, was producing 1.5 million tonnes of coal a 
year until 2002. It is now one of our most mature housing 
developments, implementing a vision that will see the site 
become one of West Yorkshire’s largest mixed-use 
developments with housing, employment opportunities and a 
range of amenities for local people.
W e 	 r eceiv ed 	 planning 	 consen t 	 fr om 	 W ak e field 	 Council 	 in 	 December 	
2013 to turn the former pityard into a new development comprising 
917 homes and 21,500 sq. m of employment development, along with 
retail units, cafes, a medical centre, community centre, nursery and 
parkland. Remediation of the site began in December 2013 and 
Phase 1 infrastructure work completed at the end of December 2014, 
supported by a £1.95m Growing Places Fund loan from the Leeds 
City Region to speed up work.
A vant 	 was 	 selected 	 as 	 the 	 first 	 housebuilder 	 for 	 the 	 scheme 	 and 	 they 	
began 	 building 	 the 	 first 	 phase 	 of 	 131 	 homes 	 in 	 January 	 2015. 	 The 	 first 	
residents received their keys by the end of 2015. Harron Homes also 
pur chased 	 the 	 second 	 phase 	 of 	 land 	 in 	 2015, 	 building 	 the 	 first 	 of 	 95 	 new 	
homes. With housing sales progressing beyond its expectations, Harron 
then purchased the third phase of land in the second half of 2016 to 
build a further 89 plots. This phase realised an average plot price of 
£47,361, 	 r eflecting 	 the 	 attraction 	 of 	 the 	 site 	 as 	 a 	 r esidential 	 location.
110 homes have now been built and occupied and we expect to 
complete the full development, with up to 917 homes and associated 
facilities, within the next ten years.
The former spoil heap next to the pit yard will also become a new 
country park, providing new public open space for the community. 
Alongside nearby Pontefract Park and Pontefract Racecourse, this will 
provide an attractive gateway into Pontefract. It also provides the 
engineered road corridor for the Northern link road, which was 
completed in February 2015 and is a central piece of infrastructure for 
the future growth of Pontefract.

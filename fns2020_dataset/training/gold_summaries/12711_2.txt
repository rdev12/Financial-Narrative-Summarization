...for development
“  This has been a year of good progress for Protherics as 
we expanded and diversiﬁ ed our portfolio of products. 
We expect to have nine clinical studies ongoing over 
the next twelve months, in addition to AstraZeneca’s 
phase 2 study of CytoFab
TM
, and we see the data 
from these studies as our biggest opportunity to 
deliver shareholder value in the near to mid term.”
Stuart Wallis, Chairman 
 Expenditure was increased in our ﬁ nancial year 2007 
to commit resources to CytoFab™ and undertake 
further work on Voraxaze™ in support of regulatory 
ﬁ lings. As the planned R&D programmes continue, 
we anticipate a further increase in expenditures in 
the current ﬁ nancial year.

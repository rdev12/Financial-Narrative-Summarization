 Halfords Annual Report and Accounts 2005 3
This first set of full year results as a
publicly listed company demonstrates
the strength and growth potential of
our business, which has a unique
position as the UK’s leading auto,
leisure and cycling products retailer.
Halfords continued to improve
performance and grow market share
by building on its unique advantages
of greater scale than its competitors,
a differentiated customer service
proposition through the “We’ll Fit It”
initiative and from the continued
development programme of new and
exciting products.
In the 52 weeks to 1 April 2005,
and against a backdrop of a more
challenging retail market, we
achieved sales growth across all
four of our key product categories
of car maintenance, car
enhancement, cycling and travel
solutions, whilst continuing to keep
firm control of costs.
By the end of the financial year, the
Group was operating from 398
stores across the UK and the
Republic of Ireland as we continued
to roll out our store development
programme of introducing mezzanine
floors, improving store layouts and
opening in new locations.
Our success would not have been
possible without the huge
contribution from our 9,940
employees, whose passion,
knowledge and enthusiasm are
crucial in giving Halfords competitive
advantage in the retail marketplace.
The Board would also like to place on
record its appreciation for the
valuable contribution made by David
Hamid, our former Chief Executive,
who announced his retirement from
the Group in March this year because
of ill health.
We were fortunate in being able to
appoint Ian McLeod as Chief
Executive. Ian has outstanding
credentials for the job. He has been
with the Group since September
2003 and as Chief Operating Officer
played an important role in running
the business alongside David and the
senior management team.
The Board is committed to the
highest standards of corporate
governance and corporate social
responsibility, as explained in more
detail later in this report.
The Board is recommending a 
final dividend of 8.3p per share in
addition to the 3.7p per share interim
dividend already paid, bringing the
total dividend for the year to 12.0p
per share.
Although the UK retail climate has
become more subdued, we have a
strong and differentiated business
with a proven strategy for growth,
which provides a solid platform from
which to build and gives us
confidence about the growth
prospects for the future.

loomsbury is continuing to grasp the 
opportunities offered by the digital revolution 
to build a growing, sustainable and balanced 
twenty-first century publishing business. We 
have succeeded in developing into a wholly integrated 
consumer and academic publisher in the major markets 
around the world. We are now recognised as one of the 
finest publishers of both general and academic books and 
we believe there are valuable synergies between the two. 
Strong revenue growth, up 11% to £109.5 million, was 
driven by an excellent list of new books contributing 
significantly to another successful year for the Group. Profit 
before tax and highlighted items of £13.0 million was up 4% 
on the year ended 28 February 2013 of £12.5 million. Profit 
before tax was £9.5 million (2012/13: £9.8 million). 
The majority of our revenue is generated by title sales, 
which were up by 16% year on year to £101.0 million 
following the success of our new books. Within this, digital 
sales rose by 21% to £12.2 million and now make up 12.1% 
of title sales (2012/13: 11.5%). The strong sales from new 
books mitigated a fall in higher margin rights and services 
revenues, which delivered 8% of total revenue compared 
to 12% last year.  Rights and services revenues were down 
26% to £8.5 million. Within that, copyright licence revenue 
fell by £2.5 million as fewer deals were completed and at 
lower amounts.  
A robust sales performance in our Academic & Professional 
division was enhanced by the acquisition of the legal 
publisher, Hart Publishing (‘Hart’), in September 2013, 
which contributed revenue of £1.8 million and profit before 
tax of £0.5 million in the six months since its acquisition. 
Underlying revenue, which excludes the result of Hart and 
the two businesses we acquired in 2012, Fairchild Books and 
Applied Visual Arts Publishing, was up by 10% to £101.5 
million. 
Operating profit margin before highlighted items 
reduced from 12.6% to 11.9% mainly because of the lower 
proportion of higher margin rights and services revenue 
compared to the very strong prior year. During the year 
we have tendered our colour print purchasing and 
delivered savings in the second half of the year equivalent 
to £0.4 million per annum. This was part of a significant 
reorganisation of our Group Production, which included 
adopting an XML-based, content-led workflow across the 
entire Group. This consolidation project will deliver a single, 
documented and controlled mark-up language suited to 
over 95% of Bloomsbury’s output. This is vital to the success 
of our publishing strategy for both print and digital.
Bloomsbury is a global, fully 
integrated publisher of books and 
other media for general readers, 
children, students, researchers 
and professionals throughout the 
world. Bloomsbury uniquely offers 
authors access to these multiple 
markets in multiple formats 
throughout the world: in print, 
through e-books, through digital 
downloads and apps; in schools, 
in libraries, in universities, and in 
terrestrial and internet bookshops, 
with entrepreneurial teams in New 
York, London, New Delhi and 
Sydney serving all territories.

We have also invested in new staff in IT, Digital Development 
and Production to facilitate further the strategic move to 
digital workflows. Combined with additional investment in 
Operations in the second half of the year, total additional 
investment in these areas is £0.6 million per annum, as 
previously announced.
We have been investing successfully in the development 
of online platforms. These include Drama Online, Churchill 
Archive and Berg Fashion Library, with Bloomsbury 
Collections launching in May this year. As sales and the 
number of platforms increase, we are creating our own 
institutional digital sales force. During 2014/15 there will be 
overlap costs of £0.3 million as we make this transition.
In its first full year of operation, our Indian publishing 
business in New Delhi generated revenues of £1.5 million 
and broke even, before the allocation of Group costs. 
This is a year ahead of our original plan and was due to 
the excellent sales of Khaled Hosseini’s And the Mountains 
Echoed and some strong local publishing. 
The acquisition of Hart Publishing, related restructuring 
and other strategic initiatives have resulted in £0.8 million 
of costs which, together with intangible amortisation, are 
highlighted separately in the financial statements.
The effective rate of tax for the year was 18.7% compared to 
20.6% for the year ended 28 February 2013. The reduction 
mainly reflects the lower rate of UK corporation tax which 
affected current and deferred tax.  
Diluted earnings per share, excluding highlighted items, 
were 14.23 pence, up 9% from 13.11 pence in 2012/13. Total 
diluted earnings per share for the year were 10.43 pence 
compared to 9.99 pence in 2012/13.
The Group’s net cash balance was £10.0 million at 28 
February 2014 down from £14.6 million at 28 February 2013. 
The Group generated £3.9 million of cash in the year before 
an £8.5 million outflow for acquisition investment. This was 
reflected in our strong operating cash conversion rate of 
86% (2012/13: 62%).
The Churchill Archive online has around one million pages accessible 
on demand to libraries worldwide.  All secondary schools in the UK, USA 
and Canada will be granted access to the entire archive.
In September 2013, we acquired Hart Publishing, the publisher of law 
books and journals for the academic and professional markets.

Divisional Review
Academic & Professional — another year of robust sales growth
The year saw a robust sales performance driven by substantial growth in organic digital revenues, the acquisition of Hart 
Publishing and a strong US performance, reflecting the investments made last year in sales and marketing infrastructure. 
Profits were also impacted by a reduction in rights and services income and a one-off £0.8 million additional US stock 
provision.  
The division’s results are summarised below:
Underlying revenue growth of 5% compares to 0.7% 
growth for global revenues at UK academic and 
professional publishers generally (source: The Publishers 
Association Sales Monitor). Revenues from e-books and 
other digital products now account for 10% of divisional 
revenue (2012/13: 8%). Subscription revenues make up 
9% of sales (2012/13: 6%). Rights and services revenues 
reduced by £1.0 million year on year following a very 
strong year in 2012/13. The Academic & Professional 
division generated 29% of Group sales this year (2012/13: 
29%).
In May 2014 the division was voted Academic, Educational 
and Professional Publisher of the Year at The Bookseller 
Industry Awards for the second year running. This prize 
goes to the company which best exhibits all-round 
excellence in its publishing including: the commercial 
success and innovation of the publishing programme; 
a sustainable and durable business; particularly with 
digital (including e-book and journal platforms, Virtual 
Learning Environments and internal digital workflow) 
and new ways to engage with learners; excellent relations 
and engagement with institutions, staff, faculty, teachers, 
professional organisations, learned societies and/or 
students; environmental awareness and responsibility; the 
retention and motivation of staff. The other companies 
on the shortlist were Oxford University Press, Sage and 
Palgrave Macmillan.
There is no evidence that competition is lessening in the 
academic market.  Library budgets worldwide remain 
constrained.  However, we expect digital sales to continue 
to grow much faster than the market overall as educational 
establishments at all levels adopt new ways of supporting 
students and faculty. 
We have seen sizeable revenue growth albeit from a low 
base from Bloomsbury India and Bloomsbury Australia.  
Sales to market of the division’s academic products 
and services are 50% outside the UK, and we expect this 
percentage to increase. 
The acquisition of Hart Publishing is consistent with 
Bloomsbury’s strategy to increase its proportion 
of academic and professional revenues to balance 
revenues generated from consumer sales. Academic and 
professional revenues are more predictable and have lower 
related costs of sale with higher margins and are much 
less reliant on retail bookshop sales. Around 50% of Hart’s 
revenue is generated outside the UK, thereby reducing 
Bloomsbury’s overall exposure to the UK book market. 
The acquisition will also enable the further development 
of Hart’s e-book catalogue and expand the Bloomsbury 
Professional digital range of services for lawyers and 
accountants.

Hart’s leading list of authors is complementary to 
Bloomsbury’s existing academic and professional lists, 
offering Bloomsbury the ability to improve revenue 
momentum within its Academic & Professional division 
in both the UK and a range of overseas markets. Hart 
published over 150 new books in the last 12 months and 
launched a new journal, Restorative Justice, and has a larger 
programme this year. 
Bloomsbury Professional’s Irish operation had a very good 
year of growth. Key to this success were new editions of 
Wylie, Irish Land Law and McMahon and Binchy, Law of Torts, 
both of which have been shortlisted for the Dublin Solicitors 
Bar Association’s Irish Law Book of the Year award.   The 
sixth online service from the Irish team, Irish Criminal Law, 
was launched in December 2013. This has been a strong 
addition to our highly regarded range of services and 
significant contracts have been won with the Attorney 
General’s Office, the Law Library of Ireland and the Garda 
Síochána Ombudsman Commission. In September 2013, 
in association with PricewaterhouseCoopers, we published 
the Manual of Accounting New UK GAAP which has quickly 
established a reputation as one of the leading products 
dealing with the new financial reporting landscape for 
unlisted companies.  
During the year Bloomsbury Professional also launched the 
online service, National Infrastructure Planning Service. 
We continue to invest in new digital services for academic 
customers.  Responding to increasing demand for a high 
quality online research tool for drama and literature 
students, professors and teachers, Drama Online 
was launched in March 2013 featuring content from 
Bloomsbury Methuen Drama, Arden Shakespeare and 
Faber & Faber. It currently contains over 1,000 plays in 
a fully cross-searchable format which allows students to 
interact with Character Grids and Part Books, as well as 
search for plays via cast size and monologues via gender. 
From January 2015 the collection will grow significantly to 
accommodate new content partners, Nick Hern Books and 
L.A. Theatre Works. Drama Online is used in leading higher 
education institutions around the world.

2013 also saw the launch of Actors and Performers,  
www.actorsandperformers.com, a professional community 
website for actors with blogs and advice from professionals 
and industry contact information from Actors’ Yearbook 
available on subscription.
In May 2014 we launched Bloomsbury Collections, an 
e-book platform which will make available the division’s 
entire research-led publishing programme.  We expect 
around 3,500 titles to be made available on the platform 
by the end of the calendar year.  In addition, Bloomsbury 
has recruited an institutional sales team, which will be 
responsible for selling the increasingly wide range of new 
services to libraries and institutions around the world.  They 
will also be responsible for selling Bloomsbury’s growing list 
of academic journals – currently over 50 – with new journal 
launches well advanced for this financial year.  This will 
further reduce the Group’s reliance on UK sales.
A new online platform, Bloomsbury Fashion Central, will 
be launched in 2015. It will feature Fairchild Books, Berg 
Fashion Library and Fashion Photography Archive. The 
investment in this platform aligns with the on-going 
industry migration from print to digital and will cement 
Bloomsbury’s dominant position in this niche. Beyond 
offering textbook rentals to students, the platform will 
provide a robust e-learning environment that will enable 
institutional and B2B subscription sales, raise profile and 
expand our market share in international markets. 
Adult — a spectacular year in both print and 
digital, fiction and non-fiction
Revenue was £49.9 million (2012/13: £44.3 million). Operating 
profit before highlighted items was £5.4 million (2012/13: 
£3.7 million). The operating profit margin before highlighted 
items for the division was 11% (2012/13: 8%). Print sales 
increased by 17%, while digital sales increased by 26% to 
£7.1 million, representing 14% of sales (2012/13: 13%).
Whilst US e-book sales growth has moderated, the UK and 
other markets still see robust growth with potential for 
even more as digital reading devices become ever more 
widespread in the high-growth economies of Asia, Africa, 
the Middle East and Latin America.
Samantha Shannon’s The Bone Season was simultaneously 
published worldwide and appeared on the New York Times 
and the Sunday Times bestseller lists in addition to enjoying 
success throughout the English-speaking world in print, 
digital and digital audio. We had a very successful global 
marketing campaign driving it to bestseller lists across the 
UK, the US and India. The film rights have been acquired by 
20
th
 Century Fox/Chernin Entertainment. The next volume 
of this seven-book series, The Mime Order, will be published 
in October 2014. Khaled Hosseini’s brilliant and moving 
Bloomsbury publishes a top selling series of accountancy manuals in 
association with PwC which are used by accountancy professionals.
Drama Online is a subscription service providing a resource for plays, 
critical analysis and performance featuring pre-eminent drama lists.
Berg Fashion Library is a strong selling online reference. A new online

Children’s & Educational — strategic 
investment pays off
Revenue was £23.6 million (2012/13: £21.3 million). 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £2.0 million 
(2012/13: £1.1 million). The operating profit margin before 
highlighted items for the division was 8% (2012/13: 5%).
Much of the growth this year came from sales of new 
books within the UK, with a significant proportion of that 
coming from illustrated books in line with our strategy. The 
division’s UK consumer print sales increased by 21.5% in a 
market which declined by 3.6% (source: Nielsen Bookscan).  
In the US, revenues were down by 1%, mainly due to soft 
e-book sales. 
Our strategic priorities remain focused on commercial 
global acquisitions for the consumer lists and targeted 
strategic marketing of our strong brands. Our new imprint 
Bloomsbury Activity Books and the Bloomsbury Picture 
Book list remain growth focused - the breadth of publishing 
achieved by the launch of these two lists shifts our world 
rights ownership from 43% of the list in 2011 to 63% of the 
list in 2013. 13% of sales from our consumer new releases in 
the year were illustrated titles compared to 7% in 2012/13.
The education business remains stable and profitable. 
Focus for the year has been on the development of a new 
print edition and online subscription service for Music 
Express, the UK’s best selling and award winning primary 
classroom music resource. The online service will launch in 
August 2014.  The division produced The RSC Shakespeare 
Toolkit for Primary Teachers, an active approach to bringing 
Shakespeare’s plays to life in the classroom.

Digital sales in the division fell in value in the year to 8% 
of total net sales from 10%. In the US digital sales fell from 
20% of total net sales to 16%, whereas in the UK they were 
broadly as last year. The digital market for children’s titles is 
still predominantly led by Young Adult fiction.  Bloomsbury 
Spark, our e-first imprint, launched with seven titles in 
December and sales have been good, particularly in the US.
Publishing highlights included Fortunately, the Milk... by 
Neil Gaiman. It was shortlisted for the Specsavers Children’s 
Book of the Year and chosen by the independent sector as 
the only children’s book in the Independent Bookshops’ 
Best Books of the Year. The author spoke to an audience of 
over 2,500 at a London event held in conjunction with Time 
Out and Foyles. We have successfully acquired a graphic 
novel of The Graveyard Book in two parts, a new middle 
grade novel for publication in 2016, and world rights 
(excluding North America) in a new illustrated book called 
The Sleeper and the Spindle, to be illustrated by Chris Riddell. 
Jessica Day George was in the New York Times bestseller 
list with Wednesdays in the Tower and  sales grew strongly. 
Sarah J. Maas also hit the list with her sequel to Throne of 
Glass, Crown of Midnight. This publication was supported by 
our biggest global marketing campaign of the year. Throne 
of Glass is now available in 16 languages. 
Bloomsbury Picture Books had a strong year with Shh! Don’t 
Wake the Royal Baby! by Martha Mumford and Ada Gray 
hitting the bestseller lists in July and being the biggest 
selling debut picture book of the year in the UK. 
Jim Kay has been announced as the illustrator of the colour 
illustrated editions of Harry Potter. We also launched our 
new jacket look for the children’s editions in March, by 
Jonny Duddle, and announced our year-long Harry Potter 
marketing campaign. The new editions are being published 
in September 2014.
We remain dedicated and passionate about the future 
of children’s publishing, in all formats, and continue to 
encourage a love of reading. 
Information — expanding knowledge hubs
The core activities of Information are the development of IP-
rich knowledge hubs in cooperation with external partners, 
the provision of management, publishing and consultancy 
services and the publication of business, management, 
finance and reference titles in print and digital formats.
Revenue was £3.9 million, up 2% on £3.8 million for 
2012/13. Operating profit before highlighted items was £1.1 
million, down from £2.3 million in 2012/13 mainly due to 
higher project costs and a strategic investment in new staff 
to move the division from purely a UK base to a more global 
reach. Rights and services revenue of £3.4 million made up 
89% of total revenue (2012/13: 90%).

Key achievements in the year for the division were a 
new content licence agreement with Lloyds Bank, a new 
publishing services arrangement with Ernst & Young and a 
publishing consultancy for the University of London.
Our flagship knowledge hub, www.QFinance.com, is the 
website of best practice for finance professionals created by 
Bloomsbury in partnership with the Qatar Financial Centre 
Authority.  It has several hundred thousand unique visitors 
per month, the impact of which is enhanced by the use of 
social media.  
In May 2014 we launched IZA World of Labor (wol.iza.org), 
a knowledge hub targeted at policy makers in the field of 
labour economics which covers topics such as migration 
and minimum wage. It was previewed in Washington D.C. in 
November 2013 to an audience including the World Bank 
and International Monetary Fund.  
Bloomsbury continues its provision of management 
services to the Qatar Foundation to manage Bloomsbury 
Qatar Foundation. The Open Access journals portal,  
www.qscience.com, showed good growth and its first 
journals are being tracked for impact factors, a testimony to 
the quality of the content.
This expansion of activity and customer base is helping to 
deliver the division’s strategy to increase revenues from 
digital knowledge hubs as part of the Group’s overall 
digital strategy and to broaden the base for the services, 
partnerships and consultancy in a complex economic 
environment. We are working on the renewal of two 
contracts with our long-term partners.
The investment already made, together with further 
investment in the new financial year, is intended to help 
increase the pipeline of projects and long-term contracts. 
The market for the services which Information specialises in 
remains complex, but more positive economic conditions 
will also be beneficial.  The division remains well placed to 
exploit digital, management services and other innovative 
business opportunities for the Group. 
Bloomsbury’s Strategy

The Academic & Professional division’s aim is to be the 
number one applied visual arts publisher in the world 
and the number one independent humanities and social 
sciences publisher in Europe, with half of its revenue 
derived from digital and subscription-based products.
The Adult division aims to be the number one UK publisher 
of choice in cookery, sport and natural history and in the 
top ten for UK quality fiction. 
Our overall strategy for Children’s & Educational books 
is to be recognised for great author care, independent 
spirit and innovation. Over the next five years we will 
develop Bloomsbury Activity books to be a leading, profit 
generating list for the division, with half of the consumer 
frontlist being illustrated books and 25% of all publishing 
being in a digital format. 
The Information division strategy is to increase revenues 
from digital knowledge hubs and broaden the base for 
services and partnerships. Over the next few years we 
intend to expand from the division’s UK base and develop a 
global capability. 
The Group is making progress towards these longer-term 
targets.
Bloomsbury’s overall long-term strategy for growth 
is centred on building its non-consumer publishing, 
specifically its Academic & Professional division, to balance 
the consumer revenues in the business. The business has 
a growing portfolio of valuable intellectual property, an 
innovative staff team and the respected Bloomsbury brand 
to help achieve its aims.
Outlook
Bloomsbury’s publishing programme for 2014/15 includes 
new titles from Tom Kerridge, Paul Hollywood and Hugh 
Fearnley-Whittingstall, as well as a range of paperbacks 
from this year’s successful hardback list including And the 
Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini, The Signature of All 
Things by Elizabeth Gilbert, The Bone Season by Samantha 
Shannon and Can’t we talk about something more 
pleasant? by Roz Chast. 
In 2014/15 we will continue to invest in the business in 
a number of areas; the launch of new digital services 
for academic and general customers, a new internal 
institutional digital sales force, a year-long Harry Potter 
marketing campaign, which will accompany the new 
jackets, and new staff for global business development at 
Bloomsbury Information.
 
Nigel Newton 
Chief Executive
2014/15 has a strong publishing pipeline of many new titles with the 
potential to be bestsellers.

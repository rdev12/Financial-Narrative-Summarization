 Chairman’s 
statement
I am pleased to report our 11th set of 
annual results since flotation in 2003.
2013 has been an extremely busy year 
for your Company. It has seen the 
successful integration of Elster, acquired 
in 2012, as well as the disposal of five 
businesses from our FKI acquisition in 
2008. Truth, Marelli, Crosby, Acco and 
Harris were sold during the year for a total 
of £950 million, representing a more than 
tripling of their value for shareholders 
during the five years of Melrose ownership. 
Associated with these sales and in  
line with our proven strategy, a return 
of capital of approximately £600 million 
was announced on 21 January 2014 and 
was paid on 28 February 2014. Two large 
businesses from the FKI acquisition,  
Brush and Bridon, still remain in the Group.
The current shareholder investment in 
Melrose, net of annual dividends and 
all returns of capital since 2003 (totalling 
£1.5 billion), amounts to approximately 
£0.5 billion. Our market capitalisation 
at the current share price amounts to 
£3.5 billion, meaning that approximately 
£3.0 billion of shareholder value has 
been created over the period.
We are proud of this achievement in 
growing shareholder value and the Board, 
on behalf of shareholders, recognises the 
efforts of our employees and thanks them 
for their outstanding contribution to this.
Results for the Group
These financial statements report the 
results for the Group for the year to 
31 December 2013 and comparatives 
for the previous year.
Revenue from continuing businesses 
for the year was £1,732.8 million 
(2012: £1,051.1 million) and headline profit 
before tax (before exceptional costs, 
exceptional income and intangible asset 
amortisation) was £226.1 million 
(2012: £117.9 million). 
Adjusting for the five disposals in the year, 
headline diluted EPS (before exceptional 
costs, exceptional income and intangible 
asset amortisation) on continuing 
businesses was 12.8p (2012 proforma: 
9.4p), an increase of 36%.
Further details of these results are 
contained in the Finance Director’s review.

Trading
The speedy and rigorous implementation 
of restructuring projects in our 2012 
Elster acquisition produced an equally 
swift improvement in operating margins 
– ahead of our best expectations – which 
led to an increase of over a third in Elster’s 
profits in its first full year. Since acquisition 
we have raised our expectations of what 
Elster can achieve and the outcome to 
date is very encouraging.
As we indicated, despite the subdued 
order books of recent periods, the 
remaining “FKI” businesses of Bridon and 
Brush maintained their operating margins 
– a good performance. The recent and 
continuing level of investment in these two 
businesses means that the medium-term 
outlook remains positive but weakness 
in specific market areas may hold back 
growth in the short term.
Operating cash generation remains a major 
focus and this has been another excellent 
year. This, together with the proceeds 
from disposals, has meant a substantial 
reduction of net debt to £141 million at 
the year end from £998 million last year. 
The return of capital after the year end has 
returned debt to our more usual levels.
Dividends
The Board proposes to pay a final 
dividend of 5.0p per share (2012: 5.0p). 
This will be paid on 15 May 2014 to those 
shareholders on the register at 22 April 
2014, subject to approval at the AGM 
on 13 May 2014. This gives a total for 
the year of 7.75p per share (2012: 7.6p).
We continue to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy. (1) Before exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset amortisation.
(2) Calculated using continuing businesses.
(3) Assuming a full year’s ownership of Elster in 2012, as explained in the Finance Director’s review.

Board changes
Miles Templeman, our Senior non-
executive Director, will be stepping down 
at the conclusion of the AGM in May. He 
has been a director since our inception in 
2003 and in this time his experience and 
judgement have been highly valued by the 
Board. We will miss his distinctive input.
At the same time we were delighted 
to welcome Liz Hewitt to the Board on 
8 October 2013. Liz has an excellent 
background and experience in areas very 
relevant to Melrose’s operations and we are 
already benefiting from her contribution.
Following Miles’ departure, Perry 
Crosthwaite will become our Senior non-
executive Director. Perry will simultaneously 
relinquish his position as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, a role that will 
be filled by Justin Dowley, following the 
conclusion of this year’s AGM. Liz Hewitt 
will chair the Nomination Committee with 
effect from the end of the 2014 AGM.
Strategy 
Our strategy of “buy, improve, sell” is by 
now well understood. 2013 was a highly 
successful year particularly in the “improve” 
and “sell” categories. The speed of 
improvement in operating margins at  
Elster is a tribute to the strength of our 
management teams. But this did not dilute 
our focus on realising the value in several 
of our “FKI” businesses, nor in returning 
this to shareholders. As stated before, we 
are now actively looking for an appropriate 
opportunity to repeat the success of our 
previous acquisitions. This is a rigorous 
process and we will take as long as is 
necessary to identify the right company.
Outlook 
The recovery from the financial crisis of 
2008 has been slow, anaemic and patchy. 
Much of our growth in recent years has 
been from margin improvement rather 
than revenue growth. In common with 
many other companies, sales growth 
remains challenging and we face a 
headwind from the current strength of 
Sterling. However, there is more margin 
improvement still achievable which, 
together with the inherent strength of our 
businesses and the continuing recovery 
in most of the world’s economies, gives 
us confidence over the medium term.

‘improve’ and ‘sell’ parts of our strategy. 
Almost £1 billion was raised from 
disposals which trebled shareholders’ 
money and Elster increased its profits 
by over a third in our first full year of 
ownership. We are ready and keen to 
buy again but we remain patient for 
the right opportunity to arise.”

Our
MARKETPl ACE
Throughout 2014, the UK housing market has shown continuing signs of improvement. The 
number of transactions has increased and the pent up demand has subsequently seen 
prices rise. 
in the south-east of England where inland Homes predominantly operates, the Office for 
n ational Statistics (On S) found that property prices have soared by 11.6% in the year to 
August 2014. w ith growth in employment expected in the south east over the next decade, 
housing demand and prices are set to continue rising.
Government schemes such as Help to Buy, Build to Rent and the Builders Finance Fund 
have seen new housing supply rising, with new housing starts at 137,780 in the 12 months to 
June 2014, up by 22% compared to the year before.
However, there are currently insufficient new houses being built to keep up with the growing 
demand, which is estimated at over 250,000 units p.a., and demand is approximately double 
what is being built. with an ageing population meaning fewer occupants 
per property, the long term shortage of homes is likely to continue.
in terms of buyers, Government schemes such as Help to Buy are 
building on these signs of recovery. The Help to Buy home ownership 
scheme will run until 2020. Over half of the 114 private completions this 
year used this scheme. 
There is also the Build to Rent Fund, which was launched to stimulate new private rented 
housing supply. it is anticipated that the fund will be used to finance the building of over 
200 apartments at DGv being sold to a PRS investment fund.
The UK Government’s reforms to make the planning system less complex and easier to 
understand has recently resulted in a change of legislation to promote office to residential 
conversion under “prior approval notification” procedures, and this has been useful on one 
of the Group’s projects.
inland Homes sells the majority of its houses to UK purchasers. However, recently it sold 
14 apartments from the west Plaza, Ashford, Middlesex development to customers in 
Hong Kong. There is evidence that overseas demand for UK property is strong, with 15% of 
all new buildings in l ondon now purchased by foreign buyers.
With growth in employment expected 
in the south east over the next 
decade, housing demand and prices 
are set to continue rising.

This was another outstanding year of progress for Inland Homes.
we are benefiting from better market conditions with improved mortgage availability, 
together with a boost for homebuyers from the Government’s Help to Buy initiative. Of the 
114 private legal completions, 62 purchasers used the funding provided by the scheme. 
The core activity of our business remains the acquisition of predominantly brownfield land 
acquired without planning permission. we have also made a decision to supplement our 
brownfield activities with a number of longer term strategic sites where land is secured 
under a long term option at a discount to market value. The land portfolio includes six 
such sites with the potential for 620 plots.
Since last year’s report a number of substantial milestones were achieved in our site 
acquisition programme, namely:
ra F Stanbridge, Leighton buzzard, bedfordshire
•	 Former MoD site with consent now achieved for 175 plots plus 
commercial space
r eading r oad, Henley, Oxfordshire
•	 Former commercial site with scope for 55 plots
Lily’s Walk, High Wycombe, buckinghamshire
•	 Former gasworks with scope for 200 plots plus commercial space
queens r oad, High Wycombe, buckinghamshire
•	 Consent secured for 14 units
t he vale, acton, West London
•	 Builders’ merchants with scope for 100 plots plus commercial space
r ainsford r oad, Chelmsford, essex
•	 Former public house where we have secured consent for 14 units
t iptree, essex
•	 Former sports ground with scope for 40 plots
Meridian, Southampton, Hampshire
•	 Former Tv studios on seven acres with scope for 350 plots
aylesbury, buckinghamshire 
•	 Joint venture with another developer. A 50 acre site to be acquired jointly with scope for 
in excess of 300 plots plus commercial space
Loudwater, buckinghamshire
•	 A five acre investment property site producing income and having development potential 
and of strategic importance for the development of a wider area
Our performance this year 
demonstrates that we have the  
right strategy going forward. The 
Group is in an excellent shape with 
tremendous momentum behind it  
as we move into the new  
financial year

•	 Financial partners of inland have now completed the purchase of this 100 acre site 
from the Ministry of Defence, who were being challenged by a third party by way of a 
Judicial Review in respect of the sale. This Judicial Review has now been withdrawn. 
Shareholders may recall that inland Homes own the preferred access to this site which 
has been allocated in the l ocal Plan for in excess of 300 new homes. An agreement will 
be concluded with our financial partners in the near future now that the Judicial Review 
has been withdrawn.
The number of residential plots in the land bank of the Group and those separately held by 
DGvl is currently as follows:
Owned or contracted with planning consent 1,070
Drayton Garden village with planning consent 248
Owned or contracted without planning consent 605
Plots controlled or terms agreed 1,811
t otal plots 3,734
w hilst commercial investment and development is not a core activity, current annual 
rental income generated by the land bank now exceeds £600,000. This has been bolstered 
by the lease to Sainsbury’s at DGv that was let on a 15 year term with a starting rent of 
£64,000 per annum.
Of particular note in the year was our development at west Plaza, Ashford in Middlesex 
of 152 apartments. This project is nearing completion with total anticipated revenue of 
approximately £33.0m. 90% of the development is either contracted for sale or legally 
completed.

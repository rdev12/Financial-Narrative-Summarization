 Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc 02 Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Introduction
We are pleased to report Nationwide’s maiden 
results following the Company’s successful 
admission to AiM in July 2006. Results for the year 
are very encouraging and demonstrate the progress 
we are making in developing the Group.
Financial Overview 
Sales for the twelve months ended  
31 December 2006 increased by 8% to £151.2m 
(2005: £139.6m), operating profit before  
non-recurring items rose by 42% to £5.8m (2005: 
£4.0m) and profit before tax before non-recurring 
items rose by 67% to £5.9m (2005: £3.5m). 
Operating profit after non-recurring costs relating 
to the flotation and the payment of certain 
contractual bonuses was £2.2m (2005: £7.8m). 
Profit before tax was £2.4m (2005: £7.3m) and 
basic earnings per share were 3.1p (2005: 14.5p). 
Excluding non-recurring items, earnings per share 
were 9.0p (2005: 5.5p), an increase of 64%.
The Company adopts IAS 19, the ‘corridor 
approach’, for its pension obligations. However, 
in order to provide shareholders with financial 
results which are comparable with other companies, 
results under FRS 17 are also shown. Under FRS 
17, operating profit before non-recurring items 
rose by 33% to £7.0m (2005: £5.3m), underlying 
profit before tax improved by 55% to £7.2m 
(2005: £4.6m) and underlying earnings per 
share rose by 53% to 11.0p (2005: 7.2p).
The Group’s cash position remains strong with net 
cash at 31 December 2006 of £6.9m (2005: £4.1m). 
Dividend
As set out in the Company’s AiM Admission 
Document, the Directors intend to pursue a 
progressive dividend policy which broadly reflects 
the growth in underlying earnings over time and 
Group prospects. The Directors are recommending 
the payment of a final dividend of 2.60p per share 
in respect of the year to 31 December 2006. Subject 
to approval at the Annual General Meeting, this 
will be paid on 21 May 2007 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 20 April 2007. 
Ordinarily, over the course of a financial year, final 
dividends are expected to represent two thirds of 
the total annual dividend.
Trading Overview
As our results indicate, trading over the year as 
a whole was very good and reflects the efficiency 
of our operations and systems and the strength 
of our service offering. As expected, the second 
half, which incorporates the holiday months 
of July, August and December, was seasonally 
quieter than the first half but in line with 
management expectations.
Strategy
In the Company’s Admission Document, we 
outlined our aspirations to become the accident 
repair services’ supplier of choice to the UK 
insurance market. We believe that the Group’s 
national coverage, economies of scale and customer 
service give us a competitive advantage when 
competing for business. We continue to pursue 
our twin track approach of improving our existing 
businesses whilst carefully exploring additional 
opportunities for growth through acquisition.

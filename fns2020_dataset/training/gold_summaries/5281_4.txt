ELAND AT A GLANCE
OVERVIEW
Eland is an independent oil and gas company focused on identifying, 
acquiring and developing interests in oil and gas assets in West Africa, 
focused initially on Nigeria.
Eland was formed in 2010 by Les Blair and George Maxwell who previously 
held senior management positions with Addax Petroleum Corporation. 
Since then the Company has assembled an experienced Board and

successful track records in acquiring and developing oil and gas interests.
KEY DEVELOPMENTS
Eland’s existing asset is an interest in the OML 40 licence, onshore  
Nigeria. Production began on OML 40 in February 2014 through the 
re-commissioning of two existing wells on the Opuama field, which had 
been previously shut in by SPDC since 2006.

OML 40 LOCATION
The OML 40 licence is situated within the 
Niger Delta, approximately 75km north-
west of Warri and covers an area of 
498km

. The environment in OML 40 
consists of shoreline and coastal 
mangrove swamps to brackish and fresh 
water fluvial swamps. The region is lightly 
populated with the indigenes living in 
dispersed riverine communities mainly 
from the Ijaw and Itsekiri ethnic groups.
Oil production started in February 2014 
from two existing wells in the Opuama 
field. Oil is exported via the Shell-operated 
Trans Escravos Pipeline network running 
from the Opuama field south along the 
coastline to the Forcados Oil Terminal.

reserves of 38.2 mmbbls, gross 2P reserves

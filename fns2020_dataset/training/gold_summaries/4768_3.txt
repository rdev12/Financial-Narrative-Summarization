 Results
The Group’s fourth year as a listed company has once
again been successful. We have delivered on all aspects 
of our strategy, which has been in place since ﬂotation.
Good performance from all divisions, supported by an
efﬁcient capital structure, has resulted in a 26 per cent
increase in underlying earnings per share (which excludes
proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets and non-recurring exceptional
items) to 33.4 pence per share (2006: 26.6 pence 
per share).
Basic earnings per share were 34.4 pence per share
(2006: 25.9 pence per share), an increase of 33 per cent.
The year ﬁnished on a high, with the Group entering the
FTSE 250 in December 2007.
Dividends
In October, an interim dividend of 3.33 pence per Ordinary
Share was paid in respect of proﬁts relating to 2007.
The Board has proposed that a ﬁnal dividend of 6.67
pence per Ordinary Share should be paid from proﬁts
generated in 2007. Subject to shareholder consent at 
the Annual General Meeting, this will be paid on 27 June 
2008 to members on the register at close of business 
on 6 June 2008. 
These dividends represent a 10 per cent increase year 
on year, continuing the pattern of progressive dividends
since ﬂotation.
The Board, management and people
One of Dignity’s key strengths is its people, who are all
focused on providing client service excellence in whatever
role they perform. According to our clients, our service
continues to be excellent, which taken with these operating
results demonstrates that commitment.
There were no changes to the Board in 2007 and I thank
my fellow Directors for their continued support. I am
delighted the Non-Executive Directors have agreed to
extend their commitment to work with the Group for 
a further two years.
Outlook for 2008
Given the success of our strategy so far, we plan that our
approach for 2008 will remain unchanged.
Trading in the ﬁrst eight weeks of 2008 has been strong
and the Group is well placed to deliver further growth in
this coming year.

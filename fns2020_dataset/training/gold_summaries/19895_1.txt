 We entered 2003 with a clear
objective to deliver scale in our
portfolio. With 6,437 new beds
we achieved that target,
delivering more new student
beds than all other specialist
providers combined. This has
delivered a genuine platform of
scale upon which we will
continue to build. We will no
longer set speciﬁc bed number
targets, but we will concentrate
upon the quality of the products
and services which our
customers demand.
The market in which we operate
has been in sharp focus
throughout the year. On the
demand side, acceptances for
university and college places
were up by 1.7% on average for
2003/04, with overseas student
numbers increasing by 30%.
Over the past ﬁve years,
compound growth has been over
5%, although a number of
universities have performed
appreciably better than this
average – for example, the city of
Leeds has seen growth exeeding
20% in its student population
over the same period. Data such
as that is key to the formulation
of our investment policy.
In terms of accommodation
supply, competition for
appropriate development sites
within our chosen markets
remains intense, whilst build cost
increases continue to outpace
inﬂation. We have continued to
concentrate on implementing
measures to combat these
changes, to ensure we secure
the right sites, at the right time,
for the right price.

Portfolio performance
This year, the Accommodation
Services team handled our largest
number of new property openings
to date. 6,437 new beds across
17 properties in 13 cities were
opened in the Autumn of 2003
with the division now managing
21,215 beds across 28 cities
nationwide. Opening 44% more
rooms than in 2002 with broadly
the same infrastructure has
placed demands on all parts of
the Division. Our teams have
demonstrated excellent teamwork
and dedication in meeting such a
demanding target and I thank
everyone involved for their
commitment to the growth of
our business.
The key deliverable for the
Division was to focus on returns,
substantially increasing portfolio
proﬁt. At £3.9 million for the year,
against £1.1 million in 2002, this
was emphatically achieved.
Rental income increased strongly
by 48% to £48.1 million (2002:
£32.4m) and overheads were
held at £6.1million.

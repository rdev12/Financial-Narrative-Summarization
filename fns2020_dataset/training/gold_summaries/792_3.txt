 The Alumasc Group plc
Report and Accounts 2014
04
Our Engineering Products division reduced 
operating losses further, from £0.5 million  
in 2013 to £0.2 million in 2014, but failed  
to achieve the targeted return to profitability. 
This was despite another excellent performance 
by Dyson Diecastings and generally more 
favourable market demand. There was  
further progress in the recovery at Alumasc 
Precision Components, not least in its service  
to customers.
Strategy
For a number of years, the strategy of Alumasc 
has been to optimise the performance of each 
business while seeking actively to grow our 
presence in the markets for sustainable building 
products. The financial crisis, still felt by many 
sectors of the UK economy after six years, 
has had an inevitable impact on our progress. 
Despite this, there are references elsewhere 
in this Strategic Report to the consistent 
management actions taken in recent years 
to develop and innovate our products and 
markets, while strengthening our management 
teams, and to the outperformance achieved  
as a result.
Against this backdrop, it is pleasing to observe 
a general improvement in the prospects for  
the large majority of our businesses. This  
is a welcome development as the Board 
refreshes its appraisal of where the best 
opportunities lie for directing our resources  
in building value for shareholders and may  
lead to an acceleration and focusing of our 
strategy for growth, discussed in greater  
detail later in this review.
Results
Alumasc continued to build on the recovery  
of the prior year, growing underlying profit 
before tax to £6.3 million (2013: £5.9 million), 
the highest for five years and in line with  
our expectations. This reflects a continuing  
out-performance by the group’s Building 
Products division against the background  
of modest growth in UK construction activity.
The growth in profit was matched by another 
strong cash performance. As a result, the  
Board is recommending a final dividend  
of 2.8 pence per share (2013: 2.5 pence),  
to give a total for the year of 5 pence  
(2013: 4.5 pence), an increase of 11%.
Trading
The underlying operating profit from our 
Building Products division of £8.3 million 
(2013: £8.4 million) was a good result in the 
light of market conditions and the greater 
contribution from major construction projects 
in the prior year. While the much publicised 
recovery in new-build housing was a welcome 
boost, the group’s major commercial market 
place did little more than stabilise in the  
UK during the year and remains some  
30% below the pre-recession level of 2008.
Board
Keith Walden, who stepped in to be  
Chairman of Alumasc Precision Limited  
two years ago, retires from the Board  
following the announcement of these results.  
I am immensely grateful to Keith for his 
support during this period and his continuing 
presence as a non-executive director of the 
Engineering division will be greatly appreciated.
I am delighted to announce the appointment 
of David Armfield to the Board of The Alumasc 
Group, with effect from 1 October 2014.  
David began his career as a solicitor at Wilde 
Sapte, moved to Lehman Brothers, in its 
Investment Banking group in 1987 and later 
became a Partner at PwC, where he led their 
Industrial Corporate Finance Team. With his 
increasing specialisation in the emerging fields 
of the Cleantech Industry and Renewable 
Energy, David became a founding partner  
of Kinetix Corporate Finance LLP, established  
in 2010 to provide corporate finance services 
to businesses seeking to grow in these fields.  
I am certain that David’s experience will be  
of great value to the group in the pursuit  
of its growth ambitions.

Alumasc’s rainwater, drainage and house 
building products businesses achieved 
record results in the year.
The analysis on pages 8 and 
9 illustrates the consistent 
management actions taken  
in recent years to develop and 
innovate our products and 
markets, while strengthening  
our management teams,  
and to the outperformance  
achieved as a result.

Prospects
There is evidence that the recovery in demand 
in the UK construction sector is becoming 
more widespread. In particular, the private 
commercial sector is forecast to grow steadily 
from its still diminished base. This will benefit 
the group and will hopefully be complemented 
by an equally steady growth in specification  
for our products in export markets. Against this 
background, it is reasonable to look for further 
progress in the coming year.

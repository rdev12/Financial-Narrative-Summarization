 Drozhilovskoye Smirnovskoye 1 2
The Smirnovskoye molybdenum-tungsten copper 
deposit is located in the Karabalyksky rayon, 120km 
north west of the Kostanay oblast and some 41km 
north of Karabalyk, the district centre in northern 
Kazakhstan. The village of Smirnovka is in the 
immediate vicinity of the deposit. The deposit  
area covers approximately 13.7km
2
.
The deposit has been divided into a larger  
northern and a smaller southern zone. Within both 
zones, the principal ore mineral is molybdenite 
which is associated with chalcopyrite and pyrite. 
Other minerals are rare.
The deposit has been studied in less detail than 
Drozhilovskoye, although a 1996, GKZ approved, 
resource estimate produced a combined Category 
C1 and C2 resource for both the larger northern 
and smaller southern zones of approximately 
109Mt at a grade of 0.1378% molybdenum using  
a 0.05% molybdenum equivalent cut-off grade.
A further estimate was undertaken in 2007 
which gave an estimate of 108Mt at a grade of 
0.1056% molybdenum using the same cut-off 
grade. Subsequently, additional drilling has been 
undertaken and the latest GKZ resource estimated 
is presented in the Chief Executive Officer’s report.
The Drozhilovskoye molybdenum-tungsten 
deposit is located in the Denisovski rayon of 
the Kostanayskaya oblast, 55km north east of 
Zhitigara and 31km north west of the rayon centre, 
Denisovka. The small settlement of Okrainka lies 
some 4km from the deposit.
The deposit area covers approximately 6.6km
2
. 
In addition to the molybdenum and tungsten 
content, the deposit is also thought to contain 
quantities of bismuth, beryl, lithium, rubidium, 
caesium, copper, gold and silver.
Since the deposit was discovered in 1964, 
considerable exploration work has taken place 
culminating in the most recent resource statement 
undertaken in 2005 (using the former Soviet 
Union resource and reserve classification system 
common in Central Asia), which estimated a GKZ 
approved Category C1 and C2 resource estimate 
for the northern stockwork of 37.2Mt at 0.107% 
molybdenum and 0.086% tungsten trioxide.
This assumed a 0.05% molybdenum equivalent  
cut-off grade. Importantly, the first resource 
estimate undertaken in 1974 defined a GKZ 
approved estimate for the whole deposit at a 
C2 category of approximately 140Mt at 0.188% 
molybdenum. Subsequently additional drilling 
has been completed and the latest GKZ resource 
estimated is presented in the Chief Executive 
Officer’s report.

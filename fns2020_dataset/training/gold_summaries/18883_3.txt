 4 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Chairman’s statement
It has been a year of major change  
at Kingﬁsher, with the appointment of  
a new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and 
signiﬁcant developments within the 
portfolio of our businesses. 
In September 2014 Kingﬁsher 
announced a Group CEO succession 
plan, with Sir Ian Cheshire stepping  
down after seven years in the role. The 
succession plan recognised that the next 
ﬁve years of Kingﬁsher’s evolution will be 
particularly busy, with several long-term 
projects underway. With this in mind, and 
with Ian having already served 16 years 
with the business and 14 years on the 
Board, Ian stepped down as Kingﬁsher 
Group CEO in December. On behalf  
of the Board, I would like to thank him  
for his leadership, which transformed 
Kingﬁsher into a stronger business  
during a difﬁcult economic time.  
I wish Ian well in the future.
Kingﬁsher was delighted to announce 
the appointment of Véronique Laury 
as Ian’s successor. Véronique is uniquely 
qualiﬁed for the role, having spent  
26 years in the home improvement  
sector and 11 at Kingﬁsher, most  
recently as CEO of Castorama France.  
An outstanding retailer, Véronique is 
passionate about helping customers  
have better homes, and I am sure she  
will provide the leadership, energy and 
pace to deliver the next stage of our 
strategic journey.
Véronique’s vision for Kingﬁsher is to 
leverage the scale of the business by 
becoming a single, uniﬁed company 
rather than a collection of individual 
businesses. Achieving this will mean 
organising ourselves differently. Key  
areas of focus will include deeper insight 
into customer needs which will then be 
applied consistently across the business, 
selling more similar product ranges 
across our operations and adopting  
a more uniﬁed approach to formats, 
systems and people. We aim to move  
at pace, with work already underway to 
develop a uniﬁed garden and bathroom 
offer across Kingﬁsher and plans to 
address excess selling space at B&Q UK.
Helped by these dynamic actions, we 
aim to drive more shareholder value  
over the medium term by achieving a 
combination of higher sales, maintained 
gross margins, lower costs and capital 
discipline. You can read more about 
Véronique’s plans in the CEO interview  
on pages 6-9 and in the strategic update 
on pages 12-17.
Also in the year, Kingﬁsher announced 
the completion of the disposal of our 
stake in Hornbach and a binding 
agreement to sell a 70% stake in  
B&Q China to Wumei Holdings for  
a cash consideration of £140m.  
In addition, Screwﬁx opened its ﬁrst 
stores in Germany (its ﬁrst overseas 
market) alongside a nationwide online 
delivery service.

Strategic Report
Turning to our ﬁ nancial performance last 
year, the results reﬂ ect a mixed picture 
across our markets, with the UK picking 
up but continental Europe, particularly 
France, proving to be a more challenging 
environment. In France, the slower 
economy and declining housing market 
affected our performance, particularly for 
our more construction-oriented business, 
Brico Dépôt. 
In the UK & Ireland, retail proﬁ t grew, 
helped by initiatives to re-energise 
B&Q and by better demand for trade 
products as housing and construction 
activity improved. Screwﬁ x had another 
outstanding year, with sales up by 
25.5%. The business opened 60 net 
new stores in the year whilst continuing 
to develop its industry-leading 
omnichannel offer.
Our aim is to deliver our strategy 
sustainably and we continued to make 
good progress in this area. Sales from 
products with eco credentials reached 
£2.4bn and, to date, we have installed 
LED lighting in 15% of our store estate, 
which will save us around £3m per 
annum. We continue to integrate our 
sustainable plans within our business 
and aim to reﬂ ect that in our move 
towards a more integrated approach to 
ﬁ nancial reporting. You can read more 
about our commitment to sustainable 
growth in the CEO interview, the Business 
model, and the strategic update.
Despite Group pre-tax proﬁ ts declining 
by 7.5% to £675m, the Board is very 
conﬁ dent in the future prospects of 
the business. This is underlined by the 
ordinary dividend of 10.0p (+1%) and 
the capital returns programme which 
started during the year and was the ﬁ rst 
such programme in Kingﬁ sher’s history. 
£200m was returned to shareholders 
during the year, via a special dividend 
and share buy-back programme. This 
programme will continue in 2015/16 with 
a further £200m planned for the year.
One other Board change during the year 
saw Philippe Tible step down from the 
Board in July. Philippe spent 11 years 
at Kingﬁ sher, most recently as CEO 
Castorama & Brico Dépôt brands. I would 
like to thank Philippe for his important 
work developing our businesses in 
France and, more recently, in Eastern 
Europe. He put in place a ﬁ rst class 
management team and nurtured a 
pipeline of executive talent which will 
beneﬁ t the business enormously in 
the future. 
As always, I would like to pay tribute 
to Kingﬁ sher’s 79,000 staff across our 
businesses. They continue to do a 
tremendous job and will be crucial in 
helping deliver the Board’s vision of 
Kingﬁ sher’s future. It is an exciting time 
and I believe we can look forward to the 
next stage of Kingﬁ sher’s development 
with great optimism.

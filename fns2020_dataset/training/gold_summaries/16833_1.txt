Chief Executive’s Report
Production in 201 3 increased  
48% and the revenue, EBITDA  
and profitability of the Group  
in 201 3 reflected this increase.
Volga Gas reached another key milestone in 2013 with the approval 
received in November 2013 for the upgrade works on the Group’s 
Dobrinskoye gas processing plant, following which the field output 
was progressively increased to make full use of the production 
capacity in the Group’s existing gas and condensate production 
wells on the Vostochny Makarovskoye (“VM”) and Dobrinskoye 
fields. Consequently towards the end of 2013 production increased 
significantly and reached an average rate of over 4,500 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day in December 2013, an increase of 58% compared 
to the average rate for December 2012. Thus, while Volga Gas has 
realised a significant increase in production rates during 2013, the 
benefit of these increases will continue through 2014 and beyond.
As detailed in the Operational Review below, the majority of the 
work on our producing assets base remained focused on the two 
gas fields. On VM, the Group completed a workover on the main 
producing well, VM#1, the effect of which was to increase 
significantly the production capacity of that well.
For much of 2013, the Group’s gas and condensate production was 
constrained by the requirement to operate the Dobrinskoye gas 
processing plant with a throughput of 250,000 cubic metres 
(8.8 million cubic feet per day). However, in November 2013, after 
receipt of the regulatory approvals detailed below, throughput was 
increased and reached up to 530,000 cubic metres per day 
(18.7 million cubic feet per day) during December 2013. Production 
of condensate, which is separated from the gas stream at the 
processing plant, increased in line with the gas production.
Crude oil production, on the other hand, was lower in 2013 than 
2012. Production from the Uzenskoye field was reduced as wells on 
the edge of the field began to exhibit some water cut. The 
reduction in the Uzenskoye field was partly offset by new 
production from the single well on the Sobolevskoye field.
In aggregate, production in 2013 was 2,958 barrels of oil equivalent 
per day (“boepd”), which represents a 48% increase on 2012. The 
revenue and EBITDA performance of the Group in 2013 reflected 
this increased production, although as the majority of the volume 
growth was in gas, the revenue growth was not as large. 
Nevertheless, as an indication of rising profitability, EBITDA per 
barrel of oil equivalent sold increased 26% from US$10.96 in 2012 to 
US$13.80 in 2013. See the Financial Report on page 10 for details.
In 2013, exploration activity was limited, although a number of 
significant exploration prospects in the Group’s Karpenskiy licence 
area have been identified for future exploration drilling.
Our key operational objectives in 2014 are to complete the 
remaining work on the Dobrinskoye gas plant upgrade, with the 
aim of fulfilling the regulatory requirements to enable the Group to 
operate at a processing capacity of 1 million cubic metres per day 
(35 million cubic feet per day) and to bring the VM field into full 
scale production. The latter involves development drilling of two 
wells during 2014, the first of which is already under way.
Finance
The Group maintained a strong level of cash generation from 
operating activities throughout 2013, enabling it to fund its capital 
expenditure for the year from operating cash flow and to make  
full repayment of its bank loans, which at 31 December 2012 were 
US$8.0 million. As at 31 December 2013, the Group had net cash  
of US$8.1 million and no debt.
Although the planned investments in 2014 are expected to be less 
than operating cash flow, the Group considers a moderate level of 
borrowing to be appropriate as part of the longer-term capital 
structure. As the Group’s assets have established a track record of 
reliable cash generation, with prospects for continued significant 
growth in the near future, the Board believes it appropriate to 
consider distributions to shareholders and is taking measures to 
enable this.
Current trading
In January and February 2014, Group production averaged 
4,563 boepd comprising 1,900 bpd of oil and condensate and 
16.0 mmcf/d of gas and, in spite of some softening in the US dollar 
equivalent realisations for sales as a result of the weakening ruble, 
monthly revenues and gross cash margins are significantly ahead of 
the average run rate for 2013. Higher cash flows have continued to 
drive increases in the Group’s cash balances ahead of the planned 
capital expenditure.

Outlook
Key activities for 2014 will be focused on delivering increased 
production from the VM field enabling full utilisation of the 
capacity at the Dobrinskoye gas plant. It is our current expectation 
that works on the final stage of the upgrade will be completed 
during H1 2014 when, subject to obtaining the necessary permits, 
we expect to achieve full operation at a capacity of up to 1 million 
cubic metres per day (35.3 million cubic feet per day).
Having mobilised a drilling rig in January, drilling of the new 
development well VM#3 on the VM field has commenced and is 
expected to be completed in the first half of 2014. This will be 
followed by a further well, VM#5 shortly thereafter. The total 
capital expenditure budgeted for 2014 is US$13.8 million and is 
expected to be funded entirely from existing cash resources and 
cash generated from operations.
We look forward to delivering a rising stream of production and 
further financial growth.

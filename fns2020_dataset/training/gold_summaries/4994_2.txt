AT A GLANCE
DRS operates in over 50 countries across three market 
sectors: Education, Elections and Census.
DRS has over 40 years’ experience in delivering data capture projects around the world. Specialising in 
examination and assessment processing and electronic marking, DRS also provides solutions for elections and 
censuses. Its systems are implemented using extensive expertise in document design, printing, award winning 
scanning and image capture technologies, software, logistics, project management, consultancy and training.
As a business we continue to focus on the three market sectors of Education, Elections and Census. We believe they have a 
common and complementary need for solutions which provide for large-scale secure capture and processing of high-stakes 
data, primarily from manually completed, paper-based forms and the output of the results to a fixed schedule. These results 
might be election counts, census results or examination marks.

Chief Executive’ s review 
Our steady evolution 
as a global company 
based on our own state-
of-the-art technology, 
and a consistent strategy 
was evident in many 
encouraging respects 
Our business performance in 2004 improved our ﬁnancial position 
across the board.We continued to win new orders and to 
enhance our existing customer relationships in ways that augur 
well for our future growth, as we contemplate a worldwide market 
worth perhaps US$2 trillion over the next 20 years. And we kept 
up our constant drive for technical innovation and greater 
operational efﬁciency. 
Continuing progress 
Iamparticularly pleased to report that, in what was our centenary 
year, we grew our total sales by ﬁve per cent to £5.9 billion and 
lifted our underlying proﬁts before taxation by 21 per cent to 
£345 million.There was also a strong cash ﬂow performance: 
we generated a cash inﬂow of £243 million, which resulted in a 
reduction of our year-end net debt to £80 million from £323 million 
at the end of 2003. Average net debt for the year, at £560 million, 
was at its lowest level since 1998. 
Across our four operating businesses, we booked £8.7 billion 
of ﬁrm new orders and announced a further £2.4 billion that will 
go into the order book in due course.This was a record intake for 
the Group, as was the year-end ﬁrm order book that closed at 
£18.9 billion. Our order book has now grown in each of the past 
ten years, at a 12 per cent compound annual growth rate. 
Solid progress was made across all four of the Group’s 
target markets: 
– 	 in civil aerospace, the Trent 1000 engine was adopted by 
Boeing for its new 787 Dreamliner programme, and was 
selected for the purchase of 50 aircraft by All Nippon Airways, 
ensuring that Rolls-Royce will be the launch engine for 
this programme; 
– 	 in defence aerospace, the European governments 
participating in the Euroﬁghter Typhoon conﬁrmed 
Tranche 2 of the programme, resulting in an order worth 
more than £750 million for the Group; 
– 	 in the marine sector, the MT30 derivative of the Trent 
engine was selected for the Lockheed Martin version of the 
US Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship, complementing our earlier 
success with the demonstrator programme for the DD(X) 
US destroyer; and 
– 	 in the energy sector, important contracts were won for 
the West-East China Pipeline Project and in the Middle East 
for the Dolphin Energy Limited gas pipeline, which is the 
ﬁrst oil & gas application for the industrial version of the 
Trent engine. 
These and other successes during the year ensured that 
Rolls-Royce continued to enhance its strong market position in 
each of its four chosen sectors. In civil aerospace, we won 40 per 
cent of all new orders placed – our best ever performance. In the 
oil & gas sector, the success of the industrial Trent enhanced our 
position in the market for aero-derived engines. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 05  Chief Executive’ s review continued 
Sir John Rose 
Every time that Rolls-Royce sells an engine, we have signiﬁcant 
opportunities to secure future revenues for services that will add 
value for our customer and add predictability to our own future 
earnings.The Group continued to build up this aspect of the 
business in 2004. Revenue from services grew by 14 per cent to 
£3.2 billion, which represented 55 per cent of total sales and 
brought the compound annual growth rate for this side of the 
business to 12 per cent for the past ﬁve years. Orders for future 
services accounted for £7.3 billion or 39 per cent of the year-end 
ﬁrm order book. 
Innovation 
Innovative technology and engineering are at the core of our 
business, and we pushed ahead with various important initiatives 
during the year. Rolls-Royce last year prepared 250 applications 
for new patents, a record total for the Group in any one year. 
Many initiatives involved partnering with research and 
development centres overseas. Indeed, we have now set up an 
international network of technology-oriented relationships and 
more than 50 per cent of the Group’s total spending on technology 
programmes will be directed outside the UK . Partners based in 
Asia are increasingly important to us.Towards the end of the year, 
we signed a Technology Agreement with a number of research 
institutions in Singapore covering a range of research activities. 
Further links of this kind are sure to follow. 
As a global business we are in the fortunate position of 
being able to recruit the most able students in all the countries in 
which we operate and conduct research. However, my colleagues 
and I cannot fail to be concerned over the contrast evident in the 
UK, where fewer students study the sciences each year. If we are 
going to sustain our leadership in an intensely competitive 
marketplace, then we will need to ensure a reliable supply of 
talented young engineers and scientists. 
The remedy will have to include stimulating more interest 
in science at the classroom level, which is why, in July, we launched 
the Rolls-Royce Science Prize. It is a £1 million award programme 
that has been designed to act over a number of years as an 
incentive to encourage excellence in science teaching. We hope 
it will also inspire more young people to look at the possibility of 
a career in our industry. 
A highly-skilled workforce, of course, demands a best-
practices workplace. Investing in people and technology means 
investing also in our infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities. 
One of the most visible signs of this is our factory renewal 
programme. Last October, we opened our new compression 
systems facility at Inchinnan in Scotland.It is one of a number of 
facilities that will be developed and opened over the next few 
years, reﬂecting a total investment of more than £200 million. 
As well as rationalising our manufacturing facilities, 
we remain focused on improving our manufacturing processes, 
simplifying our supply chain and reducing the lead-time involved 
in component delivery.This process delivered a ﬁve per cent 
reduction in our unit costs in 2004, and we are targeting continuing 
cost reduction in 2005. 
Prospects 
The four sectors of the power-systems market on which Rolls-Royce 
is focused – civil aerospace, defence aerospace, marine and energy 
– all enjoy strong demand trends stretching well into the future. 
Rolls-Royce is well placed to beneﬁt from this demand, 
having invested heavily in new products.Taking advantage of the 
common technological base underpinning all four sectors, the Group 
has directed its investment into the development of a robust 
portfolio of products that can be adapted and applied to respond 
to new market opportunities.Thus, the investment in the Trent 
family of engines provided the technical foundation for us to bid 
successfully last year on the new Boeing 787 and has also formed 
the basis for new products in other sectors, such as the MT30 in the 
marine sector and the industrial Trent in the energy sector. 
The potential for service revenues is similarly encouraging. 
The growing number of Rolls-Royce engines in service and their long 
service lives promise to ensure attractive returns over many years. 
This aspect of the Group’s business is evolving rapidly with a 
signiﬁcant level of investment being made in support capabilities 
such as engine repair and overhaul facilities, engine leasing and 
predictive data management.We expect to see a steady rise in the 
number of long-term service agreements with our major customers. 
Across its four sectors, Rolls-Royce has now established 
a sound position within programmes that will shape the power-
systems market for many years to come: 
–	 i n civil aerospace, conditions remain difﬁcult for some 
airlines but Rolls-Royce has a broad spread of products 
and customers.The Trent engine family has secured a 
50 per cent share of the engine market serving wide-bodied 
aircraft.Trent engines will power the launch of the 
Boeing 787 and Airbus A380 aircraft.The Trent 900 was 
certiﬁed on time, paving the way for the ﬁrst ﬂight of the 
A380 in 2005. We also offer a competitive range of engines 
for the regional airlines and corporate aircraft sectors; 
–	 i n defence aerospace, our position on a broad range of 
mature and new programmes enables us to mitigate the 
impact of volatility on individual programmes and provides 
a stable outlook; 
–	i	n the marine sector, our naval business is well positioned 
on a number of important new programmes and orders 
in the offshore market recovered strongly in the second 
half of 2004; and 
–	i	n the energy sector, our oil & gas business has a strong 
order book and the industrial Trent is well placed to secure 
a growing share of the power generation market. Earlier 
this year we established a joint venture with a consortium 
of companies in Asia as a further step in the process of 
bringing to market our solid-oxide fuel cell technology. 
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 06  The Group is exposed to exchange rate movements on foreign 
currencies, particularly the US dollar which continued to weaken 
relative to sterling throughout 2004. We have, however, continued 
to pursue our strategy of hedging future net dollar revenues and 
at the end of 2004 had approximately US$9 billion of forward cover. 
Our strong order book, the long-term services revenue 
stream and our focus on operational performance underpin the 
Group’s expectations of continued growth in proﬁts and reduction 
of average net debt in 2005. We continue to target a ten per cent 
return on sales over the medium term, across all our businesses, 
as the business model develops and our operational efﬁciency 
continues to improve. 
A memorable year 
We celebrated our centenary in 2004 with a huge variety of events, 
from Highland games (in Derbyshire) to open-air concerts and 
air shows, including an aerobatics display by the Red Arrows. 
Employees enjoyed the opportunity to entertain their families in 
5
the workplace at all of our main sites around the world. We also 
sponsored many special events – notably a series of concerts in 
Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing by the London Symphony 
Orchestra, which, like us, was celebrating its 100th year. 
So it was a year in which the unique character of 
Rolls-Royce was more than usually apparent to all of those who 
work in the Group, a fact we were proud to acknowledge by 
presenting every employee with a copy of a beautifully produced 
book tracing the history of the company’s ﬁrst 100 years. 
As we set out on the next 100, I would like to thank all our 
employees for the huge contribution that they made in 2004.It is	 
only through their dedication and co-operation that the Group 
can look forward to retaining its competitive vigour and delivering 
value to customers and shareholders.

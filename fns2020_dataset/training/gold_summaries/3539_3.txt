Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to report that 2014 was  
a successful and exciting year for the 
Cineworld Group and its shareholders. 
Despite a relatively quiet year for the 
cinema exhibition industry in general 
which saw worldwide admissions drop 
compared to the previous year, Cineworld 
continued to grow revenues and earnings 
and declared an increased dividend.
Shareholders will recall that at the start 
of the year the Group announced a 
transaction which combined Cineworld 
and Cinema City. In less than a year  
the results of that transaction have 
proved successful and exceeded our 
expectations. The Cineworld Group is 
now Europe’s second largest cinema 
chain. By the end of the year the Group 
was operating 1,875 screens in 203 
cinemas in nine different countries. We 
are currently scheduled to open a further 
504 screens over the next three years – 
328 of which are in Central and Eastern 
Europe and 176 of which are in the UK. 
This expansion will be financed from 
internal resources and provide excellent 
growth potential into the future.
On a pro-forma basis revenue increased 
by 1.8% in the UK & Ireland and we 
continued to outperform the market as a 
whole, with box office revenues increasing 
marginally by 0.1% despite a 3.7% decline 
in admissions. By way of contrast, 
admissions in CEE & Israel increased  
by 4.0%, which highlights the benefit  
of the diversified portfolio effect of 
operating in a number of countries. 
The Group’s balance sheet is strong and 
debt has reduced since the acquisition of 
Cinema City with our EBITDA to net debt 
ratio at the year end at 2.1 times compared 
to the 2.3 times we reported at the half 
year. This strength and the sound 
operating performance has enabled the 
Board to declare a full year dividend of 
13.5p per share, which represents 33.7% 
growth in cash dividends for shareholders 
who took up their rights as part of the 
rights issue on 14 February 2014. I am 
particularly proud of the fact that the 
Group has increased its dividend every 
year since the Company was listed in 
2007, despite some very challenging 
years for the UK economy as a whole.
Following the combination with Cinema 
City, Mooky Greidinger joined our Board 
as CEO in succession to Steve Wiener. 
Mooky has been in the cinema business 
for close to 40 years and is internationally 
recognised as one of the leading operators 
in the industry. We are fortunate to have 
him as CEO. Israel Greidinger, also very 
experienced in the industry, was originally 
appointed as COO, but after the initial 
review of roles and structure it was 
decided to appoint him as Deputy CEO 
as we believed it was a more appropriate 
title for his role in the Company.
Scott Rosenblum (a New York lawyer who 
is experienced in corporate governance 
matters) and Arni Samuelsson (an 
independent owner and operator of 
cinemas in Iceland) were also appointed 
to the Board as Non-Executive Directors 
during 2014. It has been a pleasure 
welcoming our new Board members and 
they have already made a constructive 
contribution towards our affairs. I look 
forward to continuing to work with them 
in the future.
Following nine years of committed 
service, David Maloney and Peter Williams 
will lose their independent status as 
Non-Executive Directors, as defined by 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
and will step down from the Board at the 
next AGM. I would like to personally thank 
David and Peter for their dedication to 
Cineworld since its listing, and during  
a period which has seen the Company 
become the UK’s most successful cinema 
chain, expand internationally and this 
year enter the FTSE 250. They made a 
significant contribution and we wish both 
of them well for the future.
Following a diligent search process we 
have made an offer to Julie Southern to 
join the Board as a Non-Executive Director, 
and she will accordingly stand for election 
at the AGM. If so elected, it is intended 
that Julie Southern will succeed David 
Maloney as the Chair of the Audit 
Committee. Julie has an extensive 
background both in finance and consumer 
facing businesses and is well qualified to 
assume this role, which she also holds at 
Rentokil-Initial plc. 
It is also intended that Martina King,  
an existing independent Non-Executive 
Director, will succeed Peter Williams as 
the Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 
Martina has a great deal of experience in 
this area and has sat on the remuneration 
committees for a number of UK Listed 
businesses. A further Board appointment 
is anticipated presently and we will 
announce the revised composition of  
the respective Board Committees in  
due course. I am confident that these 
appointments will bring significant 
benefits to the Group and widen the  
skill set on the Board.
It goes without saying that we will 
maintain our strong culture of attaining 
the highest corporate governance 
standards. This is a matter that the Board 
takes extremely seriously. We continue 
to take note of issues that concern the 
environment, gender and other diversity 
and health and safety matters, and we 
periodically review and where appropriate 
improve our practices in those areas.
The prospects for the Group in 2015 are 
good. There is a strong film release 
programme and we are currently on track 
to open a further 20 cinemas during the 
year. I accordingly look forward to the 
future with confidence.
On behalf of myself and the Board I would 
like to express my appreciation to the 
Group’s management and all its employees 
for their hard work and achievements 
during 2014. They are a great team to 
work with, competent and committed, 
and I look forward to working with them 
in the future to continue to provide 
growth for our shareholders.

local and intimate film viewing 
experience having created cinemas 
of high quality and of architectural 
merit. Picturehouse operates in  
12 towns and cities, with seven 
located in London ‘villages’, and 
continues to focus on cinemagoers

offering freshly-cooked food, bars

the experience a bit different to 
the big multiplexes.

2 The Go-Ahead Group plc I Annual Report and Accounts 2016 2 The Go-Ahead Group plc I Annual Report and Accounts 2016 In line with our progressive dividend policy and 
the interim dividend, a final dividend of 67.52p 
has been proposed. This would provide a total for 
the year of 95.85p.
The year on year rate in this metric has improved 
by 2.34% and we continue to make progress 
towards our 10% reduction target by 2018 on a 
2014/15 baseline. We have already made 
significant improvements in this area and carbon 
emissions per passenger journey have reduced 
16.11% on a like for like basis since our original 
2007/08 baseline.
Our regional bus passenger satisfaction scores 
remain industry leading. The overall score in our 
rail division was impacted by the significant 
infrastructure improvement works taking place 
as part of the government’s £6.5bn Thameslink 
Programme.

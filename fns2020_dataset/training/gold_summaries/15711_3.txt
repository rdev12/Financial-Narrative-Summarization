Introduction
I am pleased to report that solid organic growth in revenues combined with our
continued focus on improving margins has resulted in the Group achieving its
planned profit growth over 2006.
This is the first set of full year results announced under IFRS with comparisons
against restated 2006 results. Total Group revenues of £26.43m in 2007 represent
organic growth of 12.4% compared with £23.52m reported in 2006.
The Group has again increased its operating margins, achieving 13.8% for the full
year (2006: 12.4%). Profit before taxation increased by 22% to £3.39m (2006:
£2.79m) and after adjustment for share option charges increased by
24% to £3.62m (2006: £2.92m).
Good progress has been made in many areas of the business, with continued solid
growth in our contracted support revenues, major project wins with our existing
large legal clients and significant success from our recent move into the
accountancy sector . In addition, customer response to the release of new Tikit-
developed software, particularly the enhanced version of Tikit eMarketing suite
and the Tikit Template Management System for Microsoft Word (TMS), resulted in
sales in the second half and also indicate potentially higher sales of these products
during 2008 and beyond.
Our European subsidiaries based in France and Spain continue to make good
progress with new customer wins and increased market share. Both France and
Spain are experiencing a good start to 2008.
Results
Revenues for the period increased by 12.4% to £26.4m (2006: £23.5m). Reported
revenues were slightly below expectations as a result of the earlier
implementation of subscription-based pricing on some of our products than was
originally planned. In conjunction with one of our key software partners, we
offered subscription-based pricing to new clients in the final quarter of 2007 .
This is an exciting development for the Group, which will secure more predictable
long-term revenues. There will be a short term impact on both revenues and
profits as we move from initial licence fee recognition of software sales to revenue
recognition over typically five-year contracts.

Tikit’s opportunities are many
and your Board continues to be
optimistic about the future trading
prospects of the Group.

Total services revenue from our consultancy and managed services businesses
increased by 16% to £17 .6m (2006: £15.2m), of which £9.6 million (2006: £7 .8m)
related to managed services and support revenue. These contracted recurring
revenues accounted for 37% of total Group revenues in 2007 .
The improvement of operating margins from 12.4% to 13.8% reflects higher
utilisation rates of our chargeable staff and efficiencies gained through the
integration of managed services operations and reducing some lower margin
business in non-strategic areas such as hardware sales.
Profits before taxation increased to £3.4m (2006: £2.8m). After adjusting for
share options, profits for the Group increased by 24%, achieving an audited profit
before taxation and share option charges for the period of £3.6m (2006: £2.9m).
Share option charges during the period, as required by IFRS, were £231,000
(2006: £127 ,000). This is a non-cash charge to profits based upon the best
estimate of the market value of shares at the time in the future that share options
become exercisable. In order to eliminate the potential dilution effect of share
options and to meet the anticipated future liabilities associated with share options,
the Group has purchased 250,000 Tikit Group shares and holds them in treasury.
The average price paid for these shares was 251 pence per share.
Earnings per share, before share option charges, increased by 10% to 20.1 pence
(2006: 18.3 pence). However , the effective tax rate on profits increased from
22.4% in 2006 to 30.0% in 2007 . On a normalised tax basis, earnings per share
increased by 21%. Normalising tax means restating the prior year earnings as if
the effective rate of tax was 30%. Basic earnings per share were 18.6 pence
(2006: 17 .3 pence).
Our balance sheet remains strong, with net assets at 31 December 2007 of £8.3m
(2006: £6.9m), including cash balances of £2.5m (2006: £4.1m). Cash generated
from operations was £2.09m (2006: £3.61m). The reduction in cash generated is
primarily as a result of an increase of £2.45m in trade receivables at 31 December
2007 over the prior year .
Dividends
Given these solid results the Board has decided to continue with its progressive
dividend policy. A final dividend of 3.25 pence per share is proposed and is subject
to shareholder approval at the AGM on 24 April 2008. It is to be paid on 25 April
2008 to shareholders on the register on 25 March 2008. This, when taken with
the interim dividend of 1.75 pence (2006: 1.25 pence), brings the total dividend
for the year to 5.0 pence (2005: 4.0 pence), an increase of 25% over the
previous year .
I am pleased to report another
record set of results for
the Group.

Employees
I would like to take the opportunity to thank the directors and employees of the
Group for their contribution in delivering this excellent set of results.
Summary and prospects
In summary, 2007 was a good year for the Group. We enter 2008 with a strong
order book of projects to be implemented, reflecting the blend of consultancy,
support and software business sold in the last quarter .
Tikit is in an excellent position to continue to support its clients in the legal and
accountancy sectors. Both of these sectors have shown good resilience in previous
economic downturns and it is our belief that the excellent range of services and
products available from Tikit will enable our clients to manage their businesses
more effectively during such a period and beyond.
During the last twelve months, we have seen a strengthening in the partnership
with LexisNexis to expand their business in the legal and accountancy sectors.
LexisNexis, part of the Reed Elsevier Group of companies, is an established global
provider of information-based subscription services to the legal sector . In recent
years they have expanded, through acquisition, into the provision of software,
such as InterAction and more recently Redwood Business Analytics. Tikit are their
partner in the UK for these products.
We have recently been appointed as a partner for the implementation of Thomson
Elite products into the legal marketplace. We expect to capitalise on this
arrangement in 2008 and beyond, not only in the UK, but also in mainland Europe,
utilising our own operations and clients in that territory.
We continue to seek out opportunities to expand our range of services and with
the current consolidation of providers of products and services to the legal sector ,
expect to participate in this consolidation. Tikit’s opportunities are many and your
Board continues to be optimistic about the future trading prospects of the Group.

Supporta TerraQuest has had 
an excellent the year with 
operating profits* increasing

Supporta Professional Services
Supporta TerraQuest has had an excellent year with 
operating profits* increasing by 10.7% on the same period 
last year despite the more difficult economic climate.  The 
order book for Supporta TerraQuest improved by 22.3% to 
stand at £6.97m (2008: £5.70m) currently and it is a focus 
for the business over the coming year to improve its order 
book substantially.  During the year the business secured the 
following contracts:
Customer Duration Services
Transport for  
London
5 year framework

Property, Graphical 
Information Systems 
and Land referencing

Additionally Supporta TerraQuest has been selected as preferred 
supplier for a five year contract to provide a managed 
registration and printing solution in Scotland.
Supporta’s records management business, Datacare, has 
enhanced its capability with the opening of a new storage 
facility at its Upper Heyford Site.  The business achieved gross 
margins during the year of 63%, however the additional fixed 
cost of the new facility which is not yet at full capacity along 
with investment in sales and marketing costs has depressed 
the profit contribution from this business.  During the year 
the business retained 98% of its client base.  The business’s 
strong presence in the NHS, pharmaceutical and legal sectors 
gives a good base from which to grow.  During the year the 
business secured renewals of contracts with the Oxford 
Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust for controlled destruction of 
files and won a contract with London Borough of Merton 
Social Services – for scanning and archiving of security 
controlled files.
Supporta Healthcare agreed a mutual termination of its 
contract with the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust in 
May 2008 for a fee of £0.2m equivalent to one year’s profits.  
The business continues to service NHS clients’ legacy systems 
though it is expected that this work will reduce over time as 
legacy systems are closed down.  As a result of this we have 
impaired the value of the goodwill on the balance sheet by 
£3.65m.  The combined order book for records management 
and healthcare stands at £2.9m which is an 81% increase 
over the position at 31 March 2008.
The 2008/09 revenue and operating profit before share-based

Supporta’s records management business, 
Datacare, achieved gross margins during the 
year of 63%.
Chief Executive’s Report
From 1 April 2009 the brand of Supporta Professional 
Services was discontinued.  Supporta TerraQuest will trade 
under its own brand and the activities of the records 
management and healthcare businesses will be combined 
under the Supporta Datacare brand.  The overheads of 
Supporta Professional Services will be transferred into the 
businesses and further savings are expected to be generated 
in the 2009/10 financial year.
Corporate Development
We decided to close the Corporate headquarters office at 
the end of August 2008.  The lease for the building was 
surrendered in December 2008.  The annual running costs 
of the building were £350k with the first break not due 
until February 2015.  The unavoidable costs relating to the 
premises going forward amounted £1.69m with additional 
staffing costs over the period to the lease break amounting 
to £0.59m.  The exceptional charge for the year represented 
a £0.35m lease surrender premium to the landlord, £0.03m 
professional fees relating to the lease surrender, £0.10m 
of building running costs from the date the building was 
vacated to the surrender of the lease, £0.22m write down of 
fixed assets and £0.14m provision for operating leases and 
other contracts associated with the building.   
On 24 March 2009 the Group disposed of the Architecture 
and Engineering businesses.  The cashflow profile, risk and 
cyclical nature of these businesses had led us to conclude 
that they were not core to the strategic direction of the 
Group going forward.  We wish the staff in those businesses 
well in the future and thank them for their efforts whilst part 
of the Supporta Group.

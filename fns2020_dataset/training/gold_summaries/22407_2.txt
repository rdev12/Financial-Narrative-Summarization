Highlights
“The results for the year provide evidence of the success of the Group’s
strategy in a period of significant market uncertainty and volatility and
illustrate what can be achieved by our focus on investment process
(rather than just talented individuals) to deliver performance for clients,
whilst keeping fixed costs to a minimum.”
Andrew Davison, Chairman
“Whilst in the overall scheme of things we remain a small specialist boutique
manager, we do intend to continue to grow our business as long as we do
not compromise our investment performance. We have been quite successful
in continuing to expand our non-US business which now represents 28%
of our total FUM as compared with 17% in March of 2006. Over the next
year I would hope to be able to report further success with particular
emphasis from a product perspective in areas such as Frontier Markets,
Natural Resources and our Developed Markets closed-end fund business.”
Barry Olliff, Chief Executive

City of London has developed its simple operating
philosophy over a number of years. This philosophy
can best be represented by the six key drivers we
have identified for our business: City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2008 3
United Kingdom
The London office, our first,
has been based in the City of
London since 1991. In London
we undertake investment
management for our clients
and research into our global
markets from the European
time zone.
Singapore
The third office, to cover
Far East emerging markets in
real time, opened in central
Singapore in 2000, thus
positioning the Group to
cover our worldwide target
investment markets 24 hours
a day.
Dubai
This year we opened our fourth
office, in Dubai. The office is now
located in the Dubai International
Financial Centre and will allow
us to access what we believe will
be some major investment
opportunities in the region over
the next few years.

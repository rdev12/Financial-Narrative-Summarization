Introduction
2015 has been a good year for Marshalls with significant revenue and profit 
growth. Trading conditions remain positive and the Group continues to 
experience strong order intake and sales growth. 
Our core Public Sector and Commercial and Domestic businesses delivered 
strong performances without any significant increases to the Group’s cost 
base as we continue to deliver benefits from operational gearing. Our 
network of manufacturing sites continues to have sufficient capacity to 
absorb medium-term demand as well as the flexibility for further capacity 
and capability investment. There has also been a significant performance 
improvement in our smaller UK businesses during 2015 and they 
collectively delivered year on year growth in revenue of £8.7 million and 
operating profit of £2.4 million. These businesses include Street Furniture, 
Mineral Products and Stone Cladding, all of which are now profitable. 
Marshalls has a strong market position and continues to be a leading, trusted 
brand with clear values and excellent environmental credentials. The core 
values of leadership, excellence, trust and sustainability continue to be at 
the heart of the Marshalls brand. Marshalls plc was the winner of the “Best 
Construction and Materials PLC” category at the 2015 UK Stock Market Awards.
2015 trading summary
Marshalls’ revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 increased 
8 per cent at £386.2 million (2014: £358.5 million). 
Sales to the Public Sector and Commercial end market were up 11 per cent 
for the year, compared with 2014, and sales to the Domestic end market were 
up 4 per cent. The survey of domestic installers at the end of February 2016 
revealed order books of 10.5 weeks (February 2015: 9.0 weeks). 
Adjusting for currency movements, International revenue has grown by 
3 per cent during 2015 and represents approximately 5 per cent of Group 
sales. Due to the adverse movement in exchange rates, however, this 
translated to a fall of 5 per cent once converted into Sterling. Although 
the market in Europe remains more challenging, the Group delivered 
continued progress in developing its International business during the 
year, and has opened a sales office in Dubai to facilitate further sales 
growth in the Middle East. 
Profit before tax increased by 57 per cent to £35.3 million 
(2014: £22.4 million) and EBITDA increased by 35 per cent to £51.8 million 
(2014: £38.5 million). Basic EPS from continuing operations was 14.32 pence 
(2014: 10.13 pence), an increase of 41 per cent. Return on capital employed 
(“ROCE”) was 19.0 per cent, which represents an increase of 52 per cent. 
Significant cash generation has seen the Group’s net debt fall 
to £11.5 million (2014: £30.5 million).
Driving growth
The Group’s strategy is to grow the business organically and 
selectively through acquisitions, improving the Group’s return 
on capital employed and operating profit margins. This will 
be supported by the 2020 strategy. Marshalls plc Marshalls plc

Growing our business
We are growing our business both organically 
and selectively through acquisitions.
Delivering the 2020 strategy
To achieve our revenue growth the Group will target organic growth 
in all core business lines. This will be driven by our focus on innovation 
and new product development. We will also seek to extend our 
product range to provide more integrated solutions and look to use 
our digital strategy to better the customer experience. We will also 
further strengthen our logistics and distribution capabilities through 
investment. Prices will cover any cost increases during the period to 
2020. Any acquisition activity will be on top of this organic growth.
Work has commenced on a number of capital investments. Good 
opportunities are being developed which will provide a timely payback. 
These investments will total £15 million and be made over the next 
2 - 3 years. They will deliver cost savings of £5 million per annum and 
are in addition to our normal annual capital expenditure programme.
Greater focus has been given to the smaller UK businesses and they 
are all delivering increased profitability. These businesses have good 
future potential. We believe we can grow our market share through 
excellent customer service and targeted investment in these businesses.
There has been success in the last few years with our new product 
development. The Group will continue to focus on innovation and 
new product development to drive sales growth. Commercial 
demand for Water Management, Street Furniture, Rail and New Build 
Housing is increasing and all these businesses have developed 
new products that have been recently introduced in their markets. 
The Group’s new range of water management products and 
sustainable drainage systems demonstrates innovative thinking and 
could have an important part to play in reducing the risk of flooding. 
The new Drexus linear drainage system is being launched for 2016 
along with a new and innovative range of paving products that 
incorporate new surface technology.
In the core Landscape Products business, revenue from new products 
increased by 14 per cent during 2015. The current development 
pipeline remains very strong and the Group has committed further 
investment to research and development over the medium term 
to drive innovation and new product development. 
The Group continues to pursue acquisition opportunities in the 
focus areas of Water Management, Street Furniture and Mineral 
Products. A shortlist has been developed and there are ongoing 
discussions. We have discounted certain targets due to unrealistic 
price expectation and lack of fit. There remains a positive pipeline 
of good opportunities.
Current priorities and operational strategy
Operational priorities are service, quality, design, innovation and 
sustainability and the Group continues to deliver the benefits of 
improved product mix and an integrated product offering. The objective 
remains to continually strengthen the Marshalls brand by ensuring a 
consistently high standard of quality and customer service. Marshalls 
continues to have customer service as a key KPI and we maintain industry 
leading standards of product quality, availability and “on-time” delivery. 
The Group's combined customer service measure continued to be in 
excess of 98 per cent throughout 2015.
The Group’s Domestic strategy is to drive sales through approved domestic 
installers. The Marshalls Register has grown by 5 per cent in the last year 
to 1,862 teams and consistently provides high standards of quality and 
a market-leading level of service.
Marshalls’ wide-ranging digital strategy is a key priority and further 
investment is being directed to enhancing capability and digital 
support throughout the business, including product design and 
customer service. The Group’s strategic initiatives are set out in detail 
in the Strategic Report on pages 16 to 17.
In September 2015, Marshalls opened its new office “Design Space” 
in Clerkenwell, London. This is an important initiative for the Group 
and the facility was created specifically with architects and designers 
in mind. The location is at the centre of the highest concentration 
of architects in the UK and has a wide range of materials and finishes 
on display to help inspire and assist them in making specification 
decisions. The architects and designers are a key part of the route 
to market for Marshalls.
Manufacturing efficiency
We continue to focus on improving manufacturing efficiency. In the 
UK, the Group has a unique manufacturing network of 13 concrete 
manufacturing sites as well as quarries producing paving, walling 
and cladding products. This national network provides unrivalled 
geographic coverage and this continues to provide the Group with 
a distinct competitive advantage with all of the Group’s operations 
supported by a centrally managed logistics and distribution capability. 
Well invested capital equipment provides the flexibility to 
manufacture products for both the Public Sector and Commercial 
and the Domestic end markets and this operational flexibility 
remains a key focus for the Group. Marshalls employs a world-class 
Manufacturing, Innovation and Development team of engineers 
and technicians which creates competitive advantage by combining 
machinery design and installation with process improvement. 
This capability enabled the Group to accelerate new product 
development across the business.
The Group operates its own fleet of 44-tonne delivery vehicles 
equipped with crane offloading capability and state-of-the-art 
technology, including 360-degree CCTV systems and audible 
manoeuvring alerts. The Group remains committed to improving 
the quality and safety of the working environment by maintaining 
the highest health and safety standards.

Strategic Report
Economic market background 
The key fundamentals for the sector remain positive with construction 
growth becoming more balanced. Private housing work, especially in 
London and the South East, provided the majority of growth between 
2012 and 2015. Going forward, however, the 3 largest construction 
sectors of private housing, commercial and infrastructure are all 
expected to drive industry growth.
In January 2015, the CP A forecast solid UK GDP growth in 2016 and 
2017, despite a slowdown in economic activity in the second half of 
2015. The ONS’s preliminary estimate for GDP growth in quarter 4 was 
0.5 per cent. The CPA’s GDP forecast for 2016 is growth of 2.2 per cent 
and that construction output in 2016 will rise by 3.6 per cent. 
For the Domestic end market, the key factors that drive activity are 
property transactions and consumer spending on large ticket items. 
Increasing housing equity and savings are enablers of activity in 
the sector as they are used as sources of finance for housing repair 
maintenance and improvement activity. The CP A has reported that in 
2015, the Private Housing Repair, Maintenance and Improvement sector 
was worth an estimated £17 billion. In terms of funding streams 
for this work, the Office for Budget Responsibility (“OBR”) forecast 
that house prices will rise 4.8 per cent and 4.7 per cent in 2016 and 
2017 respectively. 
Consumer confidence has remained strong throughout 2015 with the 
indications showing improvement, especially in early 2015.
For 2015, GDP in the Eurozone is estimated to have risen by 1.5 per cent 
and growth in 2016 is expected to be the same, primarily due to rising 
domestic demand.
Markets
Marshalls continues to focus on innovation
The outlook remains strong with the CPA’s current forecast for 
construction output standing at 3.6 per cent growth in 2016 
and growth of 4. 1 per cent, 4.2 per cent and 4.0 per cent in the 
following 3 years. 
Market 
Public Sector and Commercial
Marshalls continues to be the only landscape products company able 
to provide a fully integrated product offer to the Public Sector and 
Commercial end market. The Group focuses on developing products 
which help architects, local authorities, engineers and contractors to 
“Create Better Spaces” , whether it is street furniture, natural stone, 
concrete block paving, water management, lighting or protective 
anti-terrorist products. The Group continues to invest in product 
innovation, sales and technical resource for those parts of the market 
where it anticipates most growth, in particular in Water Management, 
New Build Housing and Rail Infrastructure. 
The CPA’s overall view is that in the short term it is private housing 
and infrastructure that will drive growth in construction output.

Public Sector and Commercial
In the Public Sector and Commercial end market, Marshalls 
focuses on developing products which help architects, local 
authorities, housebuilders and contractors to “Create Better 
Spaces” , whether in street furniture, natural stone paving for 
the internal or external environment, concrete block paving, 
water management or anti-terrorist products. 
The Group continues to invest in product innovation, 
sales and technical resource for those parts of the market 
where it anticipates most growth, in particular in Water 
Management, New Build Housing and Rail Infrastructure. 
The CPA’s overall view is that in the short term it is private 
housing and infrastructure that will drive growth in 
construction output. 
a further 5.0 per cent in 2017, buoyed by a high latent demand 
for home ownership, helped by rising mortgage lending and 
Government policies such as the London “Help to Buy” scheme, 
the Starter Homes programme and the Help to Buy ISA. These policies 
are likely to fuel house price inflation further (especially in the 
South East) whilst also incentivising major housebuilders to increase 
building programmes over the next 12 - 18 months. 
The CPA forecasts that activity in the infrastructure sector is set to rise 
56.9 per cent by 2019 with significant growth in rail, energy, roads, 
water and sewerage activity as major projects across the sector add 
to rising general work levels. Rail Infrastructure will be primarily 
driven by Network Rail general activity but also boosted by HS2. 
Road construction is forecast to rise by 37.2 per cent by 2019.
The Group has experienced technical and sales teams focused on 
the key growth areas and by working with clients, architects and 
contractors they are able to provide a unique project overview 
and offer a complete solution comprising a full suite of products. 
Strengthening relationships with clients, architects and contractors 
and the developing of systems to identify projects are key priorities. 
The visibility of projects through externally measured sources such as 
Barbour ABI has historically provided a reliable picture of future demand. 
It consolidates planning information for all the sub sectors requiring 
hard landscaping. On average, there is a 12-month lag between 
contracts being awarded and the landscape products being required, 
so it provides 12-month advance information on likely future 
demand.

The target customer groups for installed patios and driveways occupy

These customers are generally older, have equity in their property, 
earn more and often have savings. An ageing population is combining 
with a lifestyle trend towards more outdoor living and the “outdoor 
room” . Through marketing and product development the Group 
continues to promote solutions to meet the aspirations of these 
customer groups. Pension release is having a positive impact on the 
home improvement market; in the last 3 quarters of 2015 188,000 
over 55s took a total of £3.5 billion in cash out of their pension pots, 
with 32 per cent of this being spent on home improvements.
The Group’s Domestic strategy is to drive more sales through quality 
installers and membership of the Marshalls Register grew in 2015. 
Further increase is planned in 2016. The Marshalls Register remains 
the largest installer scheme in the UK. Marshalls continues to focus 
on product innovation with a developing product portfolio helping 
installers to finish jobs more quickly.

International
Internationally, Marshalls has placed a key geographic focus on 
northern Europe, North America and the Middle East. 
In mainland Europe, the Group’s strategy in the Domestic end 
market is to be a niche, premium product supplier. The Group’s 
manufacturing site in Belgium provides a physical stock location in 
mainland Europe from which to supply the wider Group’s specialist 
product portfolio. The aim is to supply products that are not readily 
available in mainland Europe. There are over 40 million people living 
within a 2-hour drive from the site, an area that covers Belgium, 
Holland, northern France and parts of Germany. 
Marshalls now has a sales presence in North America and is supplying 
natural stone to commercial projects using distribution relationships 
with US companies. 
In 2015, Marshalls supplied a number of high profile projects in the 
Middle East, in particular focusing on driving sales in the United Arab 
Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. A new sales office has been recently 
established in Dubai to facilitate further growth in the region.

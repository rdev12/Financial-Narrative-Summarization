ensure ongoing growth of our voice
business. We believe strongly that
our voice broking activities have
material room for further expansion.
We have had a consistent strategy
for several years which can be
summarised as:
•
providing customers with more
efficient electronic trade execution,
reduced integration costs, improved
post-trade feeds and liquidity
across a wide product range; 
•
maintaining close long-term
relationships with our customers;
•
developing the business through
the combination of people and
technology; 
•
extending product and service
innovation; and
•
growing our voice and electronic
businesses, both organically and
by selective acquisition.
A key component of the execution of
our strategy is the milestone
agreement we reached in April 2006
to acquire EBS for US$517 million
and 36.1 million new ICAP shares.
This company enjoys a leading 
global position in electronic spot
foreign exchange with a very broad
customer base, excellent technology
and average transaction volumes of
over US$145 billion per day. 
In addition, we will benefit from
EBS’s well qualified and 
experienced management and staff.
The acquisition of EBS is expected 
to be completed by 5 June 2006.
This acquisition will more than double
ICAP’s annual electronic broking
revenue to more than US$375 million
per year and will raise ICAP’s
estimated overall commission market
share from 28% to approximately
32%. The proportion of Group profits
from electronic broking is estimated
to rise to 33%.
ICAP’s strategic goals remain
constant and very clear: to be the
leading global intermediary in the
wholesale OTC markets by a clear
margin with at least a 35% share of
overall market revenue and with 50%
of our profit derived from electronic
broking. As the more commoditised
products migrate to electronic broking
we aim to develop the leading global
franchise in structured and exotic
products, energy, credit, equity
derivatives and less liquid markets to

ICAP operates as a global business
in markets that are truly global. 
Our vision is to create the global
exchange for OTC financial 
products and to build a global brand
in wholesale financial services. 
We believe that we can best provide
the service our customers need by
combining the strengths of our
people together with technology –
and that by doing so we set the
standard for our industry.
Looking ahead, in the short term we
have to complete the integration of
EBS, to extend further our electronic
broking business into an increasing
number of markets with highly liquid,
commoditised products and to extend
our voice broking business into more
structured products. Activity in our
markets is driven by the volatility
generated from a broad range of
influences, over which we have no
control. We aim to achieve secular
growth from increasing market share 
and expanding product coverage. 
Our operating profit margin growth
depends on our cost control and our
ability to extract the scale economies
that make these businesses so
sustainable. I am pleased to say the
firm has never been in such good
shape and with so many opportunities.
Michael Spencer
Group Chief Executive Officer
We plan to combine EBS’s strengths
in electronic spot foreign exchange
with ICAP’s other electronic broking
businesses and create a global 
multi-product platform with further
major growth potential and significant
economies of scale through combining
and leveraging technology networks
and platforms. The combined global
network will cover more than 1,500
customer installations in 45 countries
plus a further 470 users that have
secure internet access.
In parallel with the continuing
development of our voice broking
business and the development of
new markets, this acquisition takes
us further towards our goal of offering
comprehensive electronic execution
and post-trade services for liquid,
commoditised markets. It moves
ICAP a step closer to offering full
multi-asset electronic trading with
liquidity in foreign exchange, cash
bonds and repo, as well as derivatives
in many currencies. In future we want
to provide the ability to cross trade
spreads and products and take
market efficiency to a new level. 
We hope to make it possible soon 
to trade in a 10-year government
bond in a local currency and then,
through a chain of other linked 
deals, produce a hedged transaction
in an interest rate derivative in a
different currency.
As a part of the integration of EBS 
we are reorganising our reporting
structure so that ICAP’s electronic
broking operations will be integrated
in a single, new, global electronic
division. This division will be run by
Jack Jeffery, CEO of EBS and David
Rutter, CEO of ICAP Electronic Broking
North America, will be deputy CEO.

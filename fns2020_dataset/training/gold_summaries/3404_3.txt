Corporate and social responsibility
The Group became carbon neutral on 
1 January 2007 and reduced its carbon
emissions by 37% in 2007. The Group is
targeting a further reduction of 5% in 2008.
In June 2007 the Group published its second
Corporate Responsibility Report, the major
focus of which was the Group’s response to
growing concerns about climate change.
In October 2007 Chime Communications 
was listed on the FTSE4Good Index after
meeting their globally recognised corporate
responsibility standards.
Acquisitions
We made four acquisitions in 2007, all of which
have been successfully integrated into the
Group:
Facts International – 75% of this fieldwork
research business was acquired in February
2007. The remaining 25% is held by the new
Chairman of Facts International, Nick Lamb.
Fast Track – The acquisition of the UK’s leading
sports marketing agency was completed at the
end of April 2007. The initial consideration was
£15 million payable £10 million in cash and 
£5 million in Chime shares. Deferred consideration
is payable on the average profits for the three
years ended 31 December 2009 and the three
years ended 31 December 2012. The maximum
total consideration (initial and deferred) is 
£43 million. The transaction (initial and deferred)
is based on a multiple of 7 times the average
pretax profits.
The Corporate Citizenship Company 
– Chime has acquired this leading corporate
responsibility business and merged it with its
existing business, Smart, with the aim of
becoming the first port of call for clients who
want a full range of services across the
corporate responsibility practice both in the 
UK and globally.
Stuart Higgins Communications – The
acquisition in December 2007 of this public
relations and communications consultancy run
by Stuart Higgins, former editor of The Sun
newspaper. This company has a strong
presence in the sports sector and has been
integrated into Chime’s existing business, 
Fast Track.
Board changes
On 1 July 2007, Rodger Hughes (formerly
Managing Partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers
UK) was appointed to the Board as a Non-
Executive Director and on 1 October 2007 
he took over the role of Senior Independent
Non-Executive Director from Julian Seymour.
Julian retired from the Board on 31 December
2007. The Board expresses its gratitude to
Julian for his massive contribution since the
company started.
Digital
We now offer a full suite of digital services
including online reputation management, digital
strategy, search relations, pay per click, website
design, web mapping and digital media buying.
12% of our operating income in 2007 came
from digital activities compared to 9% in 2006.
In 2006 and 2007 we invested in a new digital
search business (pay per click and natural
search) – VCCP Search. This business is now
profitable and already well established in the top
twenty search businesses in the UK.
In 2008 we have committed to start a digital
research business which we expect to achieve
at least break-even in its first year.

International operations
All three divisions of Chime offer a
comprehensive international service. This is
delivered through wholly or partly owned
agencies, a variety of alliances and purpose
built networks. We work with more than 
200 agencies across the world.
Our international strategy is client and business
opportunity led. Geography is not a key criterion
as the internet and ease of travel have made
location of little importance.
Our prime interest is not domestic work in other
countries but multinational work in a global
economy. We have been very successful 
in winning contracts for governments,
corporations and institutions that want global
reach, not dependent on geographical presence
but more on strategic skills and quality
implementation internationally.
We have Chime branded agencies in:
Middle East Abu Dhabi
Doha
Dubai
USA Washington
New York
Boston
Germany Hamburg
Munich
Berlin
South East Asia Singapore
Spain Madrid
South Africa Johannesburg
Marketplace
Our market sector is dominated by multi-
discipline agency groups like WPP, Omnicom
and IPG. The key driver is synergy, the whole
being stronger than the sum of the parts and
the fame of individual brands being a key factor
in clients’ choice of supplier. If there is a
downturn in the marcoms sector, and there is
as yet no sign of one, then reflecting the client’s
requirements is essential. Our market is
increasingly diverse and fragmented and so 
is our range of services. No one would be
immune to a downturn but we are well
positioned to remain strong.
‘Diversified communications’ continue to 
grow globally at the expense of ‘advertising
expenditure’ with diversified communications
accounting for 54% of total European marcoms
spend in 2007 (Source: Group M). Income 
from diversified communications has also
overtaken traditional media and advertising
revenue contribution in all the leading global
marcoms groups.
“Chime’s strategy since 2005 
has been to create a modern 
communications group to 
meet the demands of clients 
operating in such a rapidly 
diversifying communications 
marketplace.” 
“All three divisions of Chime offer 
a comprehensive international 
service. This is delivered 
through wholly or partly owned 
agencies, a variety of alliances 
and purpose built networks.
We work with more than 
200 agencies across the world.”

International Media Relations Programme Chairman’s statement   05
Chime’s strategy since 2005 has been to create
a modern communications group to meet the
demands of clients operating in such a rapidly
diversifying communications marketplace. We
are building leadership positions in sectors of
diversified communications which are growing
at above average rates, eg. public affairs, sports
marketing and digital communications. We are
bringing new solutions to the marketplace
anticipating client needs, etc. in deliberative
research and search relations. Most of all, in 
a fragmented and more complex marcoms
environment we are concentrating on the single
focus of ‘reputation’ so that the Group works
together on our clients’ business making sure
the whole does equal more than the sum of 
the parts.
Our view is that the marketplace will continue 
to fragment and diversify. Chime will succeed
by providing a range of services to meet these
client requirements. Our belief is that reputation
management will have equal weight with 
brand management.
Outlook
There appears to be little connection between
the turbulence in the financial markets and the
real economy. The markets, as evidenced by
the current low rating of our business and some
of our competitors, are predicting an economic
downturn. We are experiencing no sign of that
and we list below 10 reasons why we are
optimistic:
1. We are continuing to invest in new product
development, eg. online research.
2. 196 wins across the Group in
January/February 2008 versus 165 in 2007.
3. The sectoral change public relations is
enjoying in the marketplace and its above-
average growth potential.
4. The accelerating performance of Fast Track,
far and away the UK’s largest sports marketing
company. Already this year we have won the
2010 Commonwealth Games TV rights and 
the America’s Cup, acting for the defender 
– Alinghi.
5. Bell Pottinger Public Affairs is the No. 1
public affairs business in the UK. In a more
regulated business environment there is an
increasing need for businesses to talk to
government. We are expanding our public
affairs practice into Brussels and Washington.
6. Our international work is expanding at a fast
rate particularly in the Middle East which is
unaffected by the Stock Market gloom.
• The next America’s Cup challenge acting for 
Alinghi, the holders.
• The world’s largest ever civil aviation aircraft 
order for Emirates.
• The $1.9 billion acquisition of US-headquartered 
aircraft maintenance businesses for 
Dubai Aerospace Enterprise.
• McLaren’s F1 dispute with Ferrari.
• Representing Mark Warner Holidays during the 
Madeleine McCann crisis.
• Reviewing Camelot’s community relations 
strategy.
• Launch of HSBC’s title sponsorship of the 2009 
British Lions Tour of South Africa.
• Supporting the winning Glasgow 2014 
Commonwealth Games bid team.
• Launch of PlayStation 3.
• The highly successful launch of The O2, London’s
newest and most spectacular entertainment 
venue.
• The Prince of Wales’s May Day Business Summit 
on Climate Change with Business in the 
Community, bringing together over 1,000 chief 
executives and senior directors across England.
• BSkyB’s The Bigger Picture, their responsible 
business campaign and initiative.
• Imperial Tobacco’s contested £11 billion offer for 
Altadis of Spain.
Some of the high profile activities we were involved in
during 2007 include:
“Our view is that the marketplace
will continue to fragment and 
diversify. Chime will succeed by 
providing a range of services to 
meet these client requirements. 
Our belief is that reputation 
management will have equal 
weight with brand management.”
7. Our start up VCCP Search is already in the
top twenty UK search businesses.
8. We won the communications account for the
London Organising Committee of the Olympic
Games and Paralympic Games against all the
major agencies.
9. We are the agency of choice for crisis
communications, reputational damage limitation
and government and institutional global
campaigns. Already we have won consultancy
work for the governments of the US, the UK, 
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and Qatar.
10. We have successfully borne down on fixed
costs and increased the proportion of personnel
costs that is variable and performance related
from 13% to 15% in 2007.
2007 was another terrific year and there is no
sign of any slowdown in the first quarter of
2008 nor for that matter the rest of the year.

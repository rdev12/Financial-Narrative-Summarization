 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Another year of progress for T yman with further market share  
gains in North America and strong performance by ERA.
2014 has been another year of progress for Tyman with a good overall 
result delivered against a backdrop of improving market conditions in 
North America and the UK; however markets continued to be weak and 
less predictable in Continental Europe. We gained further share in North 
America during the year, predominately in Canada, and our UK business 
grew well ahead of the market.
For 2014 we have reported a 17.7 per cent increase in revenue to  
£350.9 million and a 42.4 per cent increase in underlying operating 
profit to £46.1 million. Despite the adverse impact of currency 
movements in the year and acquisitions, revenue increased by 7.4 per 
cent and underlying operating profit by 25.1 per cent on a constant 
currency like for like basis. We demonstrated good dropthrough in 2014 
with underlying operating margins increasing by 220 bps to 13.1 per 
cent (2013: 10.9 per cent). Underlying earnings per share increased by 
35.7 per cent to 18.61 pence.
The Group as a whole has delivered a further material improvement in 
its return on capital employed (“ROCE”) of 240 bps to 11.4 per cent as 
we continue to make progress towards our medium term target of a 
ROCE of 15 per cent.
Leverage at the year end of 1.56x was 0.25x lower than 12 months ago 
and towards the lower end of our core target range of 1.50x to 2.00x from 
the half year peak of 2.21x. This was despite the investments made in the 
balance sheet during the year and the acquisition of Vedasil for cash. 
The integration of Amesbury and Truth has now completed and we  
are moving forward with the next phase of the transformation of 
AmesburyTruth into a world class manufacturing business through 
rationalisation of the North American footprint. This will generate at 
least US$10.0 million of incremental profit for AmesburyTruth by 2020.
We have also announced the rebranding of Grouphomesafe  
as ERA, leveraging off the market presence and heritage of the UK’s 
longest standing lock brand. In 2014, ERA had another year of strong 
performance, growing well ahead of the market, and saw its net 
operating margin expand from 12.2 per cent to 14.9 per cent.
Schlegel International again had a challenging year, reflecting continued 
difficult markets in Europe; however Vedasil has performed strongly in its 
first 10 months of ownership and provides the Group with a platform  
for growth in South America. We have made further progress with the 
restructuring of the Division and the closure of the European Industrial 
Products business removes a significant management distraction.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend for 2014 of 6.00 pence per 
share (2013: 4.50 pence per share) which, together with the interim 
dividend of 2.00 pence per share, gives a 33.3 per cent increase in the 
total dividend for the year to 8.00 pence per share (2013: 6.00 pence 
per share). 
Board and corporate governance
We have continued to evolve and refine the Board’s approach to 
corporate governance. In 2014 we conducted our first independent 
appraisal of the Board and its committees and have derived valuable 
insights from the exercise into potential areas for the development of 
the Board. 
We have continued our established practice of the Board holding a 
scheduled meeting in each of the Divisions with meetings held in 2014 
in Statesville, North Carolina where we visited two AmesburyTruth 
facilities and Harrogate, Yorkshire where we visited the Ventrolla head 
office and the local Schlegel Building Products facility. 
In addition, the Board attended the Group Management Conference 
hosted by Schlegel International in Barcelona, participated in a number 
of workshops and product demonstrations as well as visiting the 
Schlegel International plant in Terrassa. These visits allow Board 
members the opportunity to meet with various levels of local 
management and employees as well as to see first hand Group 
products being manufactured. 05

Since the year end we have announced the appointments of Mark 
Rollins and Kirsten English to the Board as Non-executive Directors; 
joining the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees of  
the Board. Mark brings to the Board his recent and relevant background 
as CEO of a listed company with international manufacturing 
operations and Kirsten brings significant international and private 
equity experience as well as her involvement in the investor community.  
We look forward to their respective contributions to the Board and  
to the Group.
Les Tench, who has served on the Board as a Non-executive Director 
and Chairman of the Group’s Remuneration Committee since 
December 2009, has indicated to the Board his wish to retire and will 
stand down as a Director following the Annual General Meeting. 
Following Les’ retirement, Mark Rollins will become Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Les has made a significant and valued contribution to the Board over 
the past five years and, on behalf of the Board and the shareholders, I 
would like to thank him for his input and wish him well in his retirement.
New Employee Share Plans
The Board believes that it is important to encourage all employees to 
participate in the future growth and development of the Group and to 
take an active interest in the performance of the Company as a whole.  
In particular we want to allow employees to have the opportunity over 
time to build an equity holding in Tyman. With this in mind, we are 
seeking shareholder approval for two broadly-based contributory share 
plans – a UK Sharesave Plan and a separate plan on similar principles 
for US employees. It is intended that each of these will offer the 
potential for favourable tax treatment in accordance with applicable 
local legislation. We are also seeking authority to extend plans into 
other jurisdictions, on a similar basis, with appropriate variations.
Shareholders will be asked to approve these proposals at the 
forthcoming AGM on 15 May 2015 and further details are contained  
in the Notice of Meeting.
Health and safety
Providing a safe environment in which our employees can work is a  
key priority for Tyman and I am pleased to report that we have made 
further progress in developing the Group’s safety culture. While the 
increase in the number of lost time injuries year on year was 
disappointing, the severity of incidents was significantly reduced 
compared with 2013 and the majority of incidents can be categorised 
as slips, trips or manual handling injuries; all of which should be capable 
of being eliminated.
2014 has seen a focus across each of the Divisions in developing their 
near miss reporting as we try to prevent those incidents that are 
preventable from occurring. In total 3,829 near miss incidents were 
reported and dealt with, ranging in scope from shortfalls in general 
housekeeping to potentially dangerous practices or processes that could 
lead to physical harm. The level of engagement from all employees in the 
development of our near miss reporting has been very encouraging and 
in time should translate into a material reduction in our lost time injuries.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all of our employees and 
management for their hard work and efforts on behalf of shareholders 
in 2014 and look forward to Tyman making further progress in 2015.

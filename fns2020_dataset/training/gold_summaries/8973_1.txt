 ˜ Kalibrate Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2014
Overview
I am pleased to report our …rst annual results since Kalibrate was 
admitted to AIM on 29 November 2013. We hold a market-leading 
position servicing the fuel retail industry, as the only global provider 
of both fuel pricing and retail network planning so�ware and 
services, and are uniquely positioned to support our clients with 
both strategic and tactical requirements for pricing, planning and 
other operational decision making. Kalibrate’s products and 
services are of paramount importance for our clients. Our products 
enable them to compete in a volatile and ever-changing market 
environment, as well as devise new market entry strategies, plan 
and re…ne existing fuel retail networks, and react to fuel pricing 
changes on a real-time basis. Our solutions and services are 
underpinned by proprietary so�ware and a comprehensive 
database of market intelligence and data. 
…†‡ˆ results 
We have achieved strong ¤nancial results for the year ended 30 June 2014, 
with Group revenues increasing by 18.8% to $28.8 million, compared to 
$24.2 million in the previous period. This growth has been fuelled by strong 
performance across both our Pricing and Planning businesses. We have 
grown across all of our core geographies and have also successfully 
entered into new territories including Malaysia, Mozambique, New Zealand, 
Brazil and the Philippines. The Group has also increased underlying EBITDA 
to $3.6 million from $3.1 million in 2013, up 15.2%, whilst we have actively 
increased investment in our business as we seek to accelerate our growth. 
We have made solid progress in further strengthening our recurring 
revenues during the year and this is reflected through our recurring 
revenue base, which increased to $19.6 million as at 30 June 2014 having 
started the year at $15.6 million. This improvement and the increasing 
revenue predictability have been driven both through the growth of our 
core business and also through the material managed services win with 
a global oil company that we announced in December 2013, shortly aer 
our admission to AIM. Our opening twelve-month order book as at 
1 July 2014 stood at $22.0 million (1 July 2013: $16.3 million).
The Group’s core markets comprise of North America, Europe, Japan 
and South Africa. During the period, the Group achieved good results 
in both North America and Japan driven by new client wins and strong 
growth with existing clients and, subsequently, our existing client base 
has grown by twelve to a total of 230 clients. We have also invested 
in strengthening resources to support our growth strategy. As such we 
have increased our core team to develop new products and services 
and also added other key roles to further enhance our infrastructure.
In addition to strong performance in our core markets, we have made 
signi¤cant progress to establish Kalibrate in new geographies where we 
have added sta� in a number of new markets. Our growth in new markets 
will be augmented by our recently announced new o‚ce opening in 
Thailand to support our business in Southeast Asia and also the 
opening of a new o‚ce in Melbourne, Australia as part of our new 24/7 
global support capability, ensuring that we can meet the needs of our 
clients at any time of the day, through a local working presence.

Strategic report Introduction
Launch of Kalibrate Cloud and formation 
of new Strategic Advisory Services division
Historically, we have sold our Pricing product by way of the sale of 
an upfront perpetual licence to a client. There is a fast growing market 
trend for IT departments to outsource niche solution o�erings. As such 
we are positioning the Group to sell more SaaS subscriptions in the 
future. This will help to ensure long-term client partnerships, increase 
the number of new clients, enhance forward visibility and build out our 
recurring revenue stream. As a part of this strategy we will also seek 
to convert existing clients to a hosted/subscription (managed services) 
o�ering which will also help to increase recurring revenues. During the 
year, we have made good progress in developing our SaaS o�ering, 
winning new Pricing clients and converting some of our existing clients 
to a managed services solution. We are moving further towards this 
goal and, on 4 September 2014, Kalibrate launched its new cloud-based 
service o�ering, Kalibrate Cloud, which coincided with the launch 
of a new Strategic Advisory Services division. 
Kalibrate Cloud has been developed to o�er the fuel retail industry an 
expert source for intelligence, insight and action to support faster, more 
con¤dent decisions and execution. Leveraging 20 years’ experience and 
anchored on the 7 Elements (“7E”) that enable fuel retail success 
(Pricing, Location, Facility, Operations, Market, Brand, Merchandising), 
the Soware as a Service based solution will enable the Group to 
reach new market segments, more e‚ciently deliver its solutions 
and establishes a destination for technology and strategy resources. 
The Kalibrate Cloud, which is fully mobile enabled and is accessible 
from desktops, tablets or smart mobile devices, will incorporate all of the 
Group’s solutions.
The Group’s new Strategic Advisory Services division will complement 
the Kalibrate Cloud o�ering which will provide a comprehensive solution 
for its clients whereby the Group will be able to work closer with its clients 
to enable them to ful¤l their strategic objectives. Kalibrate’s Strategic 
Advisory Services division will provide consultative advice that connects 
strategy with client opportunity. Based on Kalibrate’s 7 Elements for fuel 
retail success, the new division will provide clients with a strategic 
perspective for detecting, analysing and optimising value in today’s 
fuel retail environment.
Industry overview 
The global fuel retail market that we operate within continues to be 
highly competitive and, in our core markets, our clients’ exposure to 
price volatility and constantly changing competitive environments 
ensure our products and services will remain relevant.
The industry in which we operate continues to experience the 
signi¤cant structural changes that were outlined at the time of 
Kalibrate’s flotation, with the deregulation of fuel pricing in certain 
countries and the continuing emergence of compliance frameworks. 
Kalibrate remains well positioned to bene¤t from these market dynamics. 
In many parts of the world and, particularly, in Africa and Southeast 
Asia there are plans for governments to deregulate fuel prices which 
will create new opportunities for us. We also believe that these 
trends of deregulation could open up additional opportunities 
in India and China.

Industry overview continued
Given our vast experience in deregulation of fuel retail markets, 
Kalibrate is well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities 
as well as being a trusted advisor to clients. 
Regulatory compliance, such as not selling fuel at below cost, 
continues to be an important concern for all fuel retailers, and 
the increasing complexity of rules surrounding the pricing of fuel 
is a challenge that all retailers have to address. Simple in-house 
systems are no longer capable of protecting retailers from the 
risk of regulatory non-compliance, and therefore exposes them 
to substantial ¤nes or worse. We are well placed to guide and 
support our clients with our soware to ensure that clients 
do not breach these government guidelines.
Industry consolidation also continues. The North American 
and European fuel retail markets are continuing to see signi¤cant 
consolidation in this sector. For Kalibrate this consolidation means 
continued growth with some of our current clients, and opens up 
new client opportunities for the Group given our diverse client 
base and market-leading technology solutions. 
As previously announced, we have successfully completed our 
previously announced contract with NREL, the US Government’s 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The evolution of alternative 
fuels as a viable alternative to traditional fossil fuels continues and 
many operators are considering how to position themselves to supply 
their consumers with these new fuels. As a result of this growing trend, 
we have expanded our products and services suite to ensure we 
remain at the forefront of the growth in the alternative fuels sector.
Strategy
As set out in our Admission Document, Kalibrate’s growth strategy 
consists of ¤ve core activities:
¼ ¼ Grow core markets and cross-sell to existing clients
¼ ¼ Expand into new geographies
¼ ¼ Accelerate roadmap of complementary products
¼ ¼ Expand managed services o�ering
¼ ¼ Drive Soware as a Service (“SaaS”) conversion
Grow core markets and cross-sell to existing clients
We have had signi¤cant success this year in generating revenue 
from our existing clients which has been achieved through cross-selling 
our Pricing and Planning products as well as expanded services 
and data reselling. At the time of our IPO, 18 of our clients purchased 
both Pricing and Planning solutions and services. This total now 
stands at 27, which evidences our success against this strategy. 
In addition we have increased services being sold to existing clients, 
such as PriceTracker (collection of competitive fuel price surveys) 
and Pricing Performance Management services to help clients 
maintain ongoing improvements.

Strategic report Introduction
Expansion into new geographies
We remain focused on expanding our geographical presence, 
both through an ongoing direct sales e�ort and channel partners 
as well as by conducting market education programmes to help fuel 
retailers understand the impact of deregulation on their business and 
to demonstrate how Kalibrate’s products and services can support 
their business in a deregulated and more competitive market to 
enable future growth. An example of our success in this regard 
has been our expansion into Malaysia, Morocco, Mozambique, 
New Zealand, the Philippines and Brazil.
Accelerate roadmap of complementary products
We continue to focus on product development and our product 
roadmap has evolved to enable releases of new business modules 
to support our core Pricing, Planning and data analytic solutions. 
Our newly launched technology platform, Kalibrate Cloud, which 
enables delivery of our Pricing and Planning functionality across one 
technology platform in the cloud, demonstrates our continued focus 
on innovation. We have also contracted with a third party o�shore 
development team in Vietnam commencing in September 2014, 
which will enable us to accelerate the rollout of new supplementary 
solutions, including further mobile technology. The additional 
o�shoring centre will also support development of new products 
to complement the Group’s existing core Pricing and Planning 
services that will add value to our fuel retail clients. 
Expand managed services oƒering and drive SaaS conversion
An important part of our strategy is to signi¤cantly expand our SaaS 
o�ering. Trends are increasingly favouring niche business solutions, 
such as ours, to be outsourced to the cloud and we see it as an 
opportunity to accelerate sales cycles as well as to grow with smaller 
retailers where capital expenditure is oen limited for technology 
solutions. Our new Kalibrate Cloud will be key to driving this strategy. 
As a part of this initiative we will seek to convert existing clients to 
a managed services hosted o�er to be their one stop shop to maintain 
stability of our solutions as well as signing on to the Kalibrate Cloud 
to bene¤t from new products and services not o�ered on their 
current platforms. 
As stated in our Admission Document, at the time of the Group’s 
flotation, Kalibrate was in the process of ¤nalising a multi-year contractual 
commitment with one of its existing clients to provide managed services 
for the petroleum retailer’s entire fuel pricing process and procedures. 
During the year, and as announced on 20 December 2013, the Group 
subsequently won a material multi-country managed services contract with 
a global oil company under which the client will outsource the management 
of their entire pricing infrastructure to Kalibrate, in conjunction with 
the Group’s hosting partner, Rackspace. This is the largest single contract 
by total monetary value in the Group’s history and is testament to the 
quality of our managed services o�ering and the trust that our clients place 
in us. The contract will generate approximately $2 million per annum over 
the multi-year term, and this contract commenced operation in early 
July 2014. To date, performance has been impressive and our client has 
already started to see the bene¤ts of moving to this new platform, both 
through the excellent available support we provide and also through 
the improved performance that our platform is now giving them.

Expand managed services oƒering and drive 
SaaS conversion continued
At the time of our flotation, we stated our belief that the Group 
had at least 100 existing Pricing clients who would be suitable for 
a managed services o�ering. As at 30 June 2014, we had secured 
14 managed services clients, up from eight at the start of the current 
¤nancial year. Our focus remains on continuing to convert existing 
clients as well as adding new clients to our managed services o�ering 
in order to grow further our recurring revenue base. We are in the 
process of increasing operational and sales resources to support 
our growing managed services o�ering.
Divisional review
Pricing
The Group’s pricing solution is a complete end to end fuel pricing 
system that provides clients with critical historical price/volume and 
competitor data and tools to determine optimal wholesale and retail 
fuel pricing strategies. This advanced market intelligence enables 
retailers to achieve their ¤nancial goals and improve operational 
e‚ciencies, whilst at the same time ensuring regulatory compliance. 
The Group is able to price all forms of fuel that are distributed by 
petroleum retailing sites including unleaded, diesel, autogas, 
LPG and ethanol.
Revenue from the Pricing business increased by 20% to $18.0 million, 
representing 63% of the Group’s total revenue. This performance has 
been driven via both new client wins and improved sales into our 
existing client base across all regions. We have performed strongly 
in all our regions this year, with particular success in North America. 
The European Pricing business also performed well, adding a number 
of clients in Western Europe and improving our focus on expanding 
our existing client base. Rest of the World continues to grow strongly, 
albeit from a smaller revenue base, and remains a focus area for 
growth in the year ahead.
Planning
Our Planning solutions provide Kalibrate’s clients with in-depth 
market and demand analysis, capital investment scenario analysis, 
forecast changes in demand and rapid assessment of competition as 
well as forecast sales volumes of fuel, convenience stores, fast food 
restaurants and car washes oen located on petroleum retail sites. 
More generally speaking, planning incorporates site evaluation, retail 
network planning and demand data. This enables our clients to best 
prioritise their capital investment. 
Kalibrate also owns a vast volume of retail market data in North America, 
Europe, Japan, South Africa and certain countries in Latin America and 
Asia. During this year, we have been focused on developing our o�ering 
and expanding our data reselling and supporting analytics tools to 
leverage this proprietary data. As a result of this, over the course of the 
coming year we plan to expand our data analytics and insight to our 
existing clients in the fuel retail industry as well as new clients in other 
industries. We are aiming to be the comprehensive data provider for the 
fuel retail industry combining rich data with predictive analytic tools to 
help enhance a variety of operational and merchandising decisions. 
Planning revenues increased by 16% to $10.8 million, representing 
37% of the Group’s total revenue. This has been a result of continued 
successful performance in our core markets, where we have achieved 
incremental revenue growth in North America, Japan and South Africa, 
together with growth in new areas such as South East Asia and Africa 
where we have expanded delivery of our solutions into new territories 
and gained multi-year subscriptions from these clients. Our European 
Planning business has also expanded this year, as this is expected 
to become a more important revenue stream in future. 
Geographical review
North America – •% of Group revenue
The North American region has performed strongly this year and grew 
by 30% compared to the prior year. The Pricing business performed 
very well and we won a number of new clients through the year including 
a highly respected convenience retailer with more than 400 sites, and 
another East Coast-based 300-site fuel retailer, who previously were 
only a Planning client. We also achieved new license revenues from 
our clients, as industry consolidation continues at pace across the US. 
Our Planning business also performed positively with strong business 
from our existing client base as well as growing cross-sell revenues 
into existing Pricing clients. Our data reselling business also grew 
modestly and is an area which we have recently been concentrating 
our marketing e�orts and we are beginning to see the initial bene¤ts 
from this investment. 
Europe – ƒ% of Group revenue
Revenues in Europe rose by 2% across the year to $6.8 million, 
with the region delivering a stronger second half performance 
than that seen in the ¤rst half. This is a solid performance given 
that our 2013 full year results included the largest single perpetual 
license deal in the Group’s history. During the year we signed new 
Pricing clients in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain and received 
more project delivery revenues through implementations and other 
Pricing services. The Group was also selected by a major Finnish 
retailer to provide both Pricing and Planning solutions, which was 
the ¤rst time we had successfully sold a combined solution to a new 
client and is a clear indicator that our consistent message around 
the bene¤ts for clients of both solutions is working. Operationally, 
we also successfully completed a nine-country implementation of 
our soware to a European retailer with more than 2,000 fuel sites.
We were also pleased that a global oil company, and an existing 
Kalibrate Pricing client, has agreed to utilise a multi-year, full managed 
services o�ering from us for its retail operations. The contract rollout 
commenced in July 2014, in line with expectation, and is expected 
to provide an additional $2 million per year to our recurring revenues 
for the coming years.

Strategic report Introduction
Rest of the World – ƒ% of Group revenue
Our business in the Rest of the World continued to perform strongly 
this year with revenue growing by 17% to $7.0 million. Our core Planning 
businesses in Japan and South Africa remain strong and this consistent 
performance has been supported in 2014 by growth in Australasia, 
where we won a SaaS Pricing contract with a 200-store retailer in 
New Zealand, and also in Southeast Asia, where we have delivered 
a substantial Planning project across Malaysia as the country 
prepares for deregulation.
We also signed a combined Pricing and Planning contract 
in Morocco, where our new client was keen to bene¤t, ahead 
of Morocco’s deregulation, from both of our solutions, thereby 
gaining ¤rst mover advantage in the market. 
Our people
Since the IPO we have further invested in our team and now have 
more than 150 sta� globally. As a former retailer I know how important 
it is to truly understand our clients’ needs and have credibility. As such 
I am so proud of the expertise, industry knowledge and client focus 
our sta� bring to the table. We work hard to earn the right to have 
such a large global client base and the proof is our client retention. 
I want to warmly thank our sta� throughout the world who are truly 
the greatest asset of Kalibrate. 
Current trading and outlook
This year, Kalibrate has delivered upon a number of the strategic 
goals that were outlined when the Company joined the AIM market. 
We have made solid progress, achieved a strong ¤nancial performance, 
retained existing and won new clients and invested further in 
our product offering and technology to enable us to retain our 
market-leading position. The Board is pleased with the progress 
made during the Group’s maiden year as a quoted company. Kalibrate 
has developed into a more diversi¤ed Company, both through the 
evolution of its suite of solutions and services and also through our 
expanding geographical footprint. This, together with the quality 
and experience of our staff, growing qualified pipeline, positive 
market conditions and trends of price deregulation and continuing 
industry consolidation, gives us con¤dence in being able to serve 
our clients successfully in the future. 
I am pleased to report that post year-end we have continued to meet 
our targets, both in terms of ¤nancial and operational performance.
As we enter a new ¤nancial year, we remain committed to executing on 
our stated strategy and, based on this momentum, the Board expects to 
see continued progress and looks forward to the future with con¤dence. 
The Board remains con¤dent that the Group is on track to achieve 
its current targets for the coming year.

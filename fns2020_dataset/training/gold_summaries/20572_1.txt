 A personal perspective from our CEO
There is no doubt that 2016 was 
a challenging year. However, 
I am conﬁdent that we are taking 
the right actions to position this 
business for the future and I am 
excited by the results that we are 
beginning to see from our work 
on our strategic priorities.

A REVIEW OF 2016
Market conditions have been challenging, 
with ongoing lower oil price and broader 
commodity weakness; lower emerging 
market growth; and no lessening of the 
competitive pressures in the market. 
The repricing of legacy contracts in 
Mozambique early in the year and latterly 
in Argentina, placed further pressure on 
our performance. Notwithstanding these, 
I was pleased with the underlying 
business, particularly our strong order 
intake of over 1GW and the growth we 
saw in some of our markets, Russia being 
a good example. We also made good 
progress on our strategic priorities of 
Customer, Technology and Efﬁciency. 
There is more to do in 2017 but I am 
conﬁdent that this important work is 
on track and will better equip Aggreko 
to grow successfully, even in more 
difﬁcult market conditions.
In January I visited our North  
American business to better 
understand the impact of 
the low oil price on US shale 
operators and our performance 
in the Oil & Gas sector. I met  
a number of customers 
throughout the week, across the 
sector, including in downstream 
Petrochemical and Reﬁning. 
Meeting our customers is always 
an invaluable opportunity 
and hearing ﬁrst hand the 
challenges they are facing also 
reinforced the importance of 
the changes we are making 
through our strategic priorities. 
On a slightly different theme, 
I particularly enjoyed meeting 
the Aggreko team preparing for 
the Superbowl and seeing the 
impressive set up for that event.
The work underway 
across the business 
is beginning to 
take effect

OVERVIEW Following a number of weeks 
spent meeting investors after 
our full year results, I travelled 
to South America. In Argentina, 
where we have a large contract 
with the government-owned 
utility, I spent some time with 
the Secretary of Energy, our 
ultimate customer, and also 
with the British Ambassador. 
It was very apparent that the 
new government is approaching 
the chronic power shortage in 
the country differently and that 
this could present us with both 
a risk and an opportunity.
Our business in Brazil has had 
to cope with a difﬁcult few 
years in the face of a substantial 
economic slowdown and political 
upheaval, but our employees 
have continued to work tirelessly 
for our customers. In Rio, I visited 
our depot and shared lunch 
with our technicians, following 
which they took me to see the 
Olympic athlete’s food hall, for 
which we were providing the 
cooling. The hall was huge, 
covering about three football 
pitches, and presented a complex 
challenge to cool it to acceptable 
temperatures. I am always 
impressed with the capability and 
work of our people, particularly 
when seen live on the ground, 
and the dedication and passion 
that they show.
I spent a few weeks on 
an extensive tour of our 
locations across Asia, visiting 
our businesses in China, 
Japan, Korea and Singapore. 
Weather caused travel problems 
but also provided a reminder 
of the extreme conditions 
that our equipment has to 
operate in. It is important 
I get around the business as 
much as possible to speak 
with our employees directly. 
Ensuring that our people are 
safe in what they do, motivated 
and engaged, is important to 
me and a key factor in providing 
the outstanding service, quickly, 
all over the world.
People are one of our strategic 
priorities and something that 
we have focused on throughout 
the year. The appointment of 
Anna Filipopoulos, our new 
Group HR Director, has bought 
an added professionalism and 
focus in this area.
In South Korea, I met the 
organising committee for 
the PyeongChang 2018 Winter 
Olympics, the contract for 
which we signed in December 
2016. Our Global Events team, 
supported by our local team in 
Seoul, put in a huge amount of 
work to win this contract and 
I am delighted that they have 
been successful.

In May, I visited the team there 
to congratulate them on their 
results and better understand 
their growth plans for the future. 
It is an interesting market, 
largely focused on the Oil & Gas 
sector, which has continued 
to grow strongly as customers 
move from owning to renting 
equipment, thereby protecting 
their balance sheets in a weak 
commodity environment.
Given the extreme temperatures, 
it can be a challenge for our 
customers to ﬁnd equipment that 
will operate reliably. Our G3 diesel 
and QSK60 gas engines, the 
older, workhorses of our ﬂeet, 
perform very well in this harsh 
environment; the Russian 
business is taking these sets from 
around the Group as we start to 
introduce our Next Generation 
Gas engine to the wider market.

The launch of our medium speed 
Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) engine, 
and broader discussion of our 
technology agenda generated 
a huge amount of interest, 
both internally and externally. 
Technology is one of our strategic 
priorities. Our aim is to provide 
our customers with the lowest 
possible cost of power and 
technology, fuel type and engine 
efﬁciency are key to achieving 
this. As the market has become 
more competitive, technology 
has become a key differentiator 
and Aggreko is in a strong 
position to take advantage.
Our diesel G3+ engine is the 
most fuel efﬁcient on the 
market, so customers have 
less fuel to pay for; this can be 
a material saving, many millions 
of pounds, particularly when 
they are generating electricity 
continuously. We launched 
our HFO engine in response to 
market research and customer 
demand; HFO is more widely 
available than gas and cheaper 
than diesel, so for many of our 
customers it is a more economic 
way of generating power. As such, 
we think it will open up further 
opportunities for us.

The signing of a 40MW gas 
contract in Mozambique took 
our order intake for the year over 
1GW. I was delighted by this, 
particularly as the intake included 
a high percentage demand 
for our new diesel G3+ engine, 
demonstrating the importance 
of fuel efﬁciency to our customers.

August began on a negative 
note as one of our contracts 
in Argentina extended at 
substantially lower prices than 
we had achieved historically. 
Our contracts in Argentina 
were signed prior to 2012 when 
the country had a signiﬁcantly 
higher risk proﬁle and restrictive 
exchange controls. As a result 
the pricing was signiﬁcantly 
higher than current levels in 
the Power Solutions Utility 
market. This introduced some 
uncertainty around the future of 
the other contracts in Argentina, 
which I am pleased we have 
gained more clarity on recently.
Efﬁciency is one of our 
strategic priorities and clearly 
this repricing has substantially 
changed the economics of the 
Argentinian contracts. We have 
commenced a piece of work 
to look at the cost base of 
the Power Solutions business 
and how we could operate 
more efﬁciently.

The gathering of our Senior 
Leadership Team in Edinburgh 
provided the opportunity 
to discuss current business 
performance, a number of 
strategic issues and plan our 
activities for the coming year. 
We also worked together on 
the launch of our new purpose, 
values and behaviours. Culture is 
an intangible, but important part 
of our business, and our new 
framework, Always Orange, 
embodies the passion, innovation, 
expertise and teamwork that we 
want to continue to develop and 
which underpins the delivery 
of our strategy.
Earlier in the year we completed 
a large project to understand 
better what our customers 
expected from us. This ‘voice of 
the customer’ work has allowed 
us to more meaningfully segment 
customers and therefore 
understand their needs and 
expectations. In November we 
launched our new CRM system 
in the UK. The full deployment 
of this system has begun and 
will cover both ofﬁce and ﬁeld 
operations. It will provide us with 
a clearer view of our customers, 
their preferences, the service 
they require and their history 
with us. It will transform our 
sales process. It will automate 
our ﬁeld operations and ﬂeet 
management. When fully 
deployed it will make it easier 
for customers to do business 
with Aggreko and it will give 
us a powerful online presence.
Having seen further weakness 
in the North American business 
driven by the tough market 
conditions in Oil & Gas and 
Petrochemical & Reﬁning, we 
commenced a further in depth 
review of the business, with 
particular focus on the existing 
and future opportunities in the 
shale basins. As part of this review, 
we have impaired some of our 
specialised Oil & Gas equipment 
and recently announced that we 
will take further steps to right size 
our business, including depot 
closures and some role removals.
It is important to support the 
North American team as they 
make these changes, and for 
me to talk with our people 
directly. I visited the Houston 
ofﬁce and our Gulf operations in 
Lake Charles, Baton Rouge and 
New Orleans to speak with our 
people and thank them for their 
hard work in a very tough market 
and to talk enthusiastically about 
Aggreko’s future.

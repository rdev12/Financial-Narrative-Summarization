CEO Q&A
Our energy customer base  
has grown by 172%.”

Group Chief Executive Officer
Q: What is your assessment of 2015  
for Flowgroup?
A: A mixed year. The delay in the 
launch of the Flow boiler was 
obviously disappointing. However, 
we achieved some significant 
milestones in 2015 and have 
continued this into 2016. The 
wholesale energy purchasing 
agreement we signed with Shell 
has helped us deliver rapid growth 
in Flow Energy, increasing revenue 
and brand awareness, and has 
positioned us to potentially continue 
this growth. Completing the first 
installs of the Flow boiler was great 
news. Launching Flow Home, our 
connected home product range, 
adds a new revenue stream and 
keeps us at the forefront of new 
technology for our customers. We 
strengthened our teams and made 
some sound strategic decisions that 
we believe should deliver enhanced 
growth for the Group in the future.
Q: On 18 May 2015, you raised £21.3m, 
what was this for and what have  
you done with the money?
A: The funds were raised to develop 
a range of Combination boilers to 
increase the addressable market, 
to help cost down the Flow System 
boiler, expand the sales team and 
infrastructure support, upgrade 
systems and processes to enable 
management of 3rd party boiler 
installers, grow the supply chain 
and engineering teams and exploit 
licensing opportunities. Due to the 
delay in the launch of the Flow 
mCHP boiler we put the design 
of the Combination boiler on 
hold but continued with outline 
specifications. We have the funds 
available for the development of 
the Combination boiler and will 
recommence the project later in 
2016. Other funds were spent on 
creating a seamless end to end 
process for our 3rd party Brand 
Ambassadors to equip them with 
state of the art software to sell a 
range of our products (including 
energy) in the home.
“We made 
sound strategic 
decisions that we 
believe should 
deliver enhanced 
growth for the 
Group in the 
future.”

Q: Why have you decided to grow  
Flow Energy?
A: When we launched Flow Energy in 
April 2013, it was in a very different 
market. Challenger suppliers were 
still viewed with mixed feelings by 
customers and by the media and 
switching rates were still relatively 
low. So our energy business was 
initially designed to allow us to offer 
a bundled package of energy and 
heating to our boiler customers. 
However, the market changed 
significantly through 2014 and 
2015 as the benefits delivered by 
challenger suppliers gained traction 
with customers and the media, the 
Government launched its ‘Power 
to Switch’ campaign, and the price 
comparison sites grew in strength 
and visibility. It became clear that 
switching rates were accelerating 
and that many customers who did 
switch chose a challenger supplier. 
We therefore took the decision to 
grow Flow Energy and, so that we 
could do this in a way that was as 
positive as possible for our cash 
position, we pursued and signed 
an agreement with Shell Energy 
Europe Ltd for wholesale energy 
with extended credit terms and 
without the requirement for cash 
security deposits. Other energy 
supply companies have grown to 
significant size under the terms of 
similar deals — although this deal is 
only one of the building blocks of a 
large energy supply business and we 
will now need to invest in acquisition, 
systems and our teams. The fact 
that our energy customer base has 
increased by 172% from January 2015 
to April 2016 indicates the potential 
for growth that could be delivered.

Q: How much opportunity do you think 
there is in the energy market? 
A: We believe there is huge potential in 
the UK energy market. Independent 
analysis suggests that as many as 
10m customer fuel accounts could 
be switched away from the Big Six 
over the coming years. That would 
be a seismic shift which would 
change the shape of the energy 
market and create new large energy 
supply businesses. In many ways, we 
believe it’s a once in a generation 
opportunity. We believe that, with an 
existing strong reputation for both 
competitive pricing and excellent 
customer service, as well as the 
differentiated position we have 
created for ourselves courtesy of the 
Flow boiler, we have the potential to 
become one of those businesses.  
A large energy customer base would 
bring a range of benefits to the 
Group – increased revenue, increased 
brand awareness and a ready-made 
market for our product range.  
Q: How much opportunity do you think 
there is in the heating market?
A: The global heating market is 
characterised by a lack of innovation, 
many very similar products 
and incumbent players simply 
maintaining their positions.  
While many of the businesses 
already active in our target markets 
have their strengths, we believe 
that our disruptive approach and 
unique product range have the 
potential to allow us to gain market 
share. Our Brand Ambassador 
network, (our national network of 
high-quality, commercially-minded, 
customer-focused installers), is a key 
strength. We provide our products 
to them directly, circumventing the 
wholesalers who traditionally take 
fairly large margins. This approach 
gives us the flexibility, and our  
Brand Ambassadors the control  
and incentive, to drive growth on 
our terms.

Q: How many Flow boilers do you plan 
on installing in 2016?
A: Introducing any new technology 
comes with risks. To minimise these 
we plan to introduce the Flow 
boiler into the market in a prudent, 
measured way. We will therefore 
steadily increase installations 
through the next six months, aiming 
for higher volume installations in 
winter. This is the right approach.  
A game-changing technology like 
the Flow boiler has to be introduced 
sensibly and with some caution. 
This also gives us time to generate 
customer reviews and to continue to 
innovate on product design.
Q: What are your plans for international 
expansion?
A: The market for microCHP overseas 
is very attractive and we continue 
to work diligently on the previously 
announced testing contracts with 
NRG and a major global utility in 
Europe. We have also expanded this 
work now to cover opportunities in 
Italy with the recently announced 
Letter of Intent with Trillary Srl, and 
work is ongoing in Germany with 
announcements expected in due 
course.
Q: Which part of the Group do you 
believe will drive most growth?  
A: The quickest growth will 
undoubtedly come from Flow 
Energy. In the first three months 
of 2016, we had some days where 
we brought on 5,000–6,000 new 
customer fuel accounts. While this 
level of growth would be difficult 
to sustain, it shows how much 
potential for growth there could 
be for Flow Energy. On the Flow 
Products side of the business, our 
national sales network of Brand 
Ambassadors is a channel with 
significant capacity and potential. 
Initially offering only the Flow boiler, 
our recent deal with Daikin will 
allow our Brand Ambassadors to 
offer additional innovative heating 
products. Where the Flow boiler is 
appropriate, it will always be our 
first choice for install. But where it 
isn’t, we want to be in a position to 
offer an alternative solution, thereby 
addressing the entire UK heating 
market. It should be noted that our 
Brand Ambassadors won’t just sell 
boilers. They will also be offering 
home energy — both bundled with 
our products or as a standalone 
product — and our connected home 
product range. This combination 
of the different elements of our 
offer, delivering value to customers 
in a number of ways, is where 
our strength will be and it is in 
combining and bundling products 
that, we believe, we will ultimately 
drive most growth.

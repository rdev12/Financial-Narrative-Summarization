Our Business at a Glance
Building a world class portfolio
Afren now has a diversified yet balanced portfolio of 29 assets in 12 countries 
located in hydrocarbon basins of global significance. Between them they cover 
every stage of the upstream oil and gas workflow from exploration, appraisal 
and development through to production – making us a full-cycle E&P company.
1
 Nigeria
Highlights:
•  Nine interests in Blocks spanning shallow 
water offshore and onshore areas
•  Initial phases of the Ebok development 
now fully onstream, development 
ongoing in 2012
•  OML 26 acquisition completed 
•  Okoro onstream in 2008. Good 
reservoir management moving recovery 
factor towards the 3P scenario and 
production maintained consistently 
ahead of pre start-up expectations
•  Significant oil discovery at Okoro East
•  Maturing Okwok towards 
development status
•  High-impact exploration drilling at 
Ebok, OML 115 and OPL 310 in 2012
•  Regional office in Lagos
2
 Côte d’Ivoire
Highlights:
•  Two upstream Blocks and a gas 
processing plant
•  Oil, natural gas and NGL production
•  Effective management of mature 
production at Block CI-11
•  Exciting appraisal and exploration 
opportunities at Block CI-01, adjacent 
to maritime border with Ghana
•  Regional office in Abidjan
3
 Ghana
Highlights:
•  Keta Block located along the prolific 
West African Transform Margin
•  Large scale prospectivity identified in 
Upper Cretaceous, analogous to recent 
major discoveries in Ghana
•  Successful farm down of 35% interest 
and operatorship to Eni in return for 
a full carry through the exploration 
drilling of one well in 2012. Afren still 
retains a 35% interest
4
 Congo Brazzaville
Highlights:
•  La Noumbi permit adjacent to, and on  
trend with, the large M’Boundi field – 
one of Africa’s largest onshore discoveries
•  Working petroleum system demonstrated 
on the Block, with prospectivity 
identified at several intervals
•  Two exploration wells proposed 
in 2012 by the operator
5
  Nigeria – São Tomé 
& Príncipe JDZ
Highlights:
•  Obo-1 discovery well encountered 
150ft of oil pay in 2006
•  New operator, Total, proposed the drilling 
of one appraisal well on the Obo discovery 
and one exploration well in 2012
•  Proximity of Total’s existing infrastructure 
in offshore Nigeria offers potential 
synergies that could enhance development 
prospects for the Block
6
 South Africa
Highlights:
•  Block 2B located in the Orange River 
Basin close to the Ibhubesi gas field 
– covers an area of around 5,828 km
2
 
with water depths ranging from 
shoreline to 250 m
•  A-J1 oil discovery tested 36º API oil 
in 1989
•  Multiple prospects identified
•  600 km
2 
of new 3D seismic data to be 
acquired ahead of expected exploration 
drilling in 2012

Overview
10
 Madagascar
Highlights:
•   Block 1101 is located on the Eastern 
flank of the Ambilobe basin onshore 
Northern Madagascar
•   Three major structures mapped close 
to existing well with oil shows
•   Proven oil accumulations in the Isalo 
formation in Central Madagascar 
at Bemolanga and Tsimiroro are 
evidence of large scale oil potential
•   Afren’s operated interest has 
increased to 90%
•   Seismic acquisition and exploration 
drilling scheduled for 2013
11
 Tanzania
Highlights:
•   The Tanga Block is a 7,064 km
2
 licence 
lying directly south of and adjoining 
Afren’s Kenyan Blocks L17 and L18 
•   Large scale prospectivity and 
numerous additional leads identified
•   Seismic acquisition completed and 
exploration drilling planned for 2012
Highlights:
•   Two Production Sharing Contracts: 
60% operated interest in Barda Rash 
and 20% non-operated interest in 
Ain Sifni
•   Large scale discovered but undeveloped 
resource base with low risk/high 
volume upside
•   Low unit cost reserve growth 
(US$0.68 2P/2C bbl compares very 
favourably to other regional transactions 
during the period)
•   The Barda Rash PSC is located 55 km 
north-west of Erbil. Production start up 
in 2012
•  The Ain Sifni PSC is located approximately 
70 km north-west of Erbil. Substantial 
low risk volumes in a proven oil 
bearing play
• Regional office in Erbil
7
 Ethiopia
Highlights:
•  Blocks located in the high potential 
Ogaden Basin
•  Blocks 7 and 8 have good oil shows 
in Jurassic and gas shows in Triassic
•  Work ongoing to further interpret the 
prospectivity of Blocks 7 and 8
•  Seismic acquisition completed in 2010 
with exploration drilling planned for 2012
8
 Kenya
Highlights:
•  Four Blocks in high potential rift and 
coastal basins – all have evidence 
of working hydrocarbon systems
•  L17/L18 – coastal to shallow water 
marine setting. Exploration drilling 
in 2012 contingent on rig availability
•  Block 1 – onshore acreage contiguous 
with Ogaden basin in Ethiopia; 
acquiring 1,200 km of new 2D seismic 
•  Block 10A – exploration drilling 
scheduled for 2012
•  Regional office in Nairobi
9
 Seychelles
Highlights:
•  Three Blocks located on the Seychelles 
micro-continent
•  Recently interpreted data indicates 
several 100 mmbbl plus leads in all 
three Blocks, as well as new basins 
with the potential to contain significant 
Jurassic sedimentary sections
•  Main exploration target is the 
Permo-Triassic Karoo interval, which 
comprises non-marine sands 
inter-bedded with shales
•  New seismic acquisition in 2011 ahead 
of exploration drilling

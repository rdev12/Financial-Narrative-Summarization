Nostrum at a glance
Overview
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an 
independent multi-field oil and 
gas company engaging in the 
production, development and 
exploration of oil and gas in the 
pre-Caspian Basin.
We are a simple, sustainable 
and successful company and, 
by employing these core values, 
we aim to become one of the 
leading independent oil and gas 
exploration and production 
companies in the Former Soviet 
Union (FSU). 
We pursue our financial and 
operational targets in a 
responsible way, maintaining 
a track record that clearly 
demonstrates the successful 
achievement of our strategic 
goals. 
Whilst we continue to make 
progress towards our financial 
and operational goals, we have 
developed a simple strategy 
that will allow us to successfully 
deliver the near-term growth 
we have targeted, combined 
with long-term, sustainable 
value creation.
Nostrum is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange, with operations 
in Kazakhstan as well as offices in 
Amsterdam, London, Brussels and 
St. Petersburg. 
We focus on creating long-term 
shareholder value through the 
development and discovery 
of oil and gas reserves, as well 
as the production and sale of 
crude oil, stabilised condensate, 
LPG and dry gas. Our experienced 
management team has overseen 
the investment of more than 
US$1.5 billion in our licence 
area since 2004, delivering 
on a number of infrastructure 
projects, as well as significantly 
expanding the reserve base 
over the last ten years through 
our own appraisal work 
combined with successful 
M&A activity. 
Who we are
What we do
Our range of products at 
Nostrum are crude oil, stabilised 
liquid condensate, LPG and dry 
gas. Currently all our production 
comes from the Chinarevskoye 
licence. We have invested 
in developing our own 
infrastructure to control the 
transportation of our products 
until they reach the final off-taker, 
serving a wide network of 
destinations and off-takers and 
helping to ensure we always 
obtain the best possible prices.

Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC 
Annual Report 2015 03
We have successfully grown our 
production every year from 2004–2013 
when full capacity of our processing 
facilities was achieved. We have since 
targeted an average daily production 
of 45,000 boepd and expect to double 
our production capacity in 2017 to 
100,000 boepd. With this increased 
nameplate capacity we will fortify our 
competitive advantage in the market 
and deliver substantial value to 
our shareholders.
We are in a unique position in the 
market, with our front-loaded 
investment programme meaning 
we are now a leader in terms of 
infrastructure in the region. Our 
location in the north-west of 
Kazakhstan places us close to our final 
off-take destinations, including the 
Black Sea ports and Finland. We are 
able to process and export both 
liquids and gas using our wholly-owned 
treatment facilities and transport links. 
Nostrum has a simple and effective 
operating structure. It has a board of 
directors led by the chairman and an 
Executive Committee led by the CEO. 
The Executive Committee manages all 
major units involved in operations 
according to the interaction charts and 
key management principles described 
on pages 70 to 80. The team has 
a breadth of expertise as well as deep 
sector experience, which has led to 
the successful oversight of Nostrum’s 
operations throughout the challenging 
oil price environment seen over the 
last year.

Wolseley plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Chief Executive’s review
In summary…
Like-for-like revenue 
growth of 3.8 per cent. 
Further improvements 
in customer service. 
Trading margin 
increased from 4.6 per 
cent to 5.0 per cent. 
Reduction in net debt 
by £568 million in 
the year. 
In a year of slowing economic 
growth and considerable 
uncertainty in the Eurozone, 
I am pleased to report that 
201 1/12 was another decent year 
for Wolseley. Underpinning this 
were three main factors: better 
customer service by our 
business units; continued like-
for-like revenue growth trends 
particularly in the USA and 
Canada; and our ongoing 
focus on operational efﬁciency 
which has delivered further 
improvements in the trading 
margin of 40 basis points, 
despite challenging markets.
Results 
The Group delivered a good overall result 
against a backdrop of continued weak 
demand in Continental Europe and 
steady market conditions in the USA 
and Canada. The Group generated revenue 
in the ongoing businesses of £12,716 million 
(2010/11: £12,061 million), 3.8 per cent 
ahead of last year on a like-for-like basis. 
The ongoing gross margin was slightly lower 
principally due to commodity price deﬂation 
and a one-off supplier rebate settlement 
in the USA. Trading proﬁt of £665 million 
(2010/11: £622 million), which included 
£7 million (2010/11: £26 million) 
from businesses sold or held for sale, 
was 7 per cent higher than last year. 
During the year we continued to manage 
the balance sheet conservatively. Cash was 
tightly controlled enabling us to increase 
capital expenditure to £135 million (2010/11: 
£93 million) to ensure organic expansion of 
the business. We continue to place a great 
deal of emphasis on driving strong cash 
generation with a particular focus on working 
capital discipline. Operating cash ﬂow 
continued to be strong at £747 million 
(2010/11: £16 million). 
Group strategy and 
business model
Our strategy remains unchanged. We will 
continue to extend our position in plumbing 
and heating and building materials 
distribution. These are generally fragmented 
markets and the structural growth 
opportunity is signiﬁcant. Our process 
of top-down resource allocation to those 
businesses which have or can achieve 
market leadership will give us the best 
returns. In addition, through bottom-up 
detailed business unit strategies we want 
to make sure we grow our best businesses 
faster than the competition. This parallel 
path of resource allocation and performance 
management is outlined in our value creation 
model opposite.
Over the medium term we  
will progressively move our 
business to a local service 
common process model 
as we standardise core 
processes to achieve beneﬁts 
of scale and productivity.” 09

There is an important correlation in our 
business between building scale and our 
ability to make attractive returns. During 
the year we have continued to exit those 
businesses where we do not see a path 
to market leadership, which included Build 
Center, Bathstore and Encon in the UK, 
Brossette in France, and our remaining 
minority holding in Stock in the USA. In 
addition, we announced in July our intention 
to review the strategic options for our 
remaining businesses in France. 
We want to drive proﬁtable growth in each 
business unit and during the monthly 
performance reviews we review like-for-like 
revenue growth, balancing this with a focus 
on protecting gross margin. Given the tough 
economic backdrop in many of our markets 
we are keeping a keen eye on operating 
costs to ensure that we convert revenue 
growth strongly into trading proﬁt. Finally, 
over the past three years we have 
deleveraged the balance sheet and this has 
been achieved through driving strong cash 
generation. You can see several examples 
of the progress we have made in driving 
proﬁtable growth in the operating reviews 
on pages 26 to 37.
While organic growth remains the key 
priority, over the last two years we have 
invested over £50 million in selected small 
bolt-on acquisitions. Our strong preference 
is to expand in this way in our existing 
geographies, so that we can integrate 
these acquisitions rapidly with our strong 
businesses and deliver attractive returns. 
This year we made nine small bolt-on 
acquisitions, including a Blended Branches 
business in Chicago, a Waterworks business 
in California, a PVF distributor in Louisiana 
and several single branch businesses in 
Denmark and Sweden. 
Implementing our strategy – 
driving productivity and growth 
Now that we have focused the portfolio 
on a strong set of business units, we are 
continuing to evolve our business unit 
strategies and in doing so we are 
increasingly reviewing the business models 
employed by each. Here our objective is 
always to have the most efﬁcient, lowest 
cost platform in the industry and to drive 
continuous improvement by better process 
management. Over the past three years, 
certain processes and activities (for example 
strategy review, people development, 
ﬁnance and IT) have already been mandated 
as common across all business units and 
we have beneﬁted greatly from this as a 
Group. In addition, we have ensured that 
every business unit, and in turn every 
branch, measures customer service – 
because we know that high customer 
service scores correlate to strong ﬁnancial 
performance.  10

Chief Executive’s review continued
We are now evaluating the best core 
processes in our most successful business 
units to see how we can derive further 
beneﬁts from a more common approach 
across our business units. For example, 
we have developed a single platform for 
business to consumer (“B2C”) internet 
businesses based on our successful  
Build.com business in the USA. This year 
we have successfully deployed this model 
in the UK and are now evaluating other 
markets for suitability. In addition, we have 
now established in all business units a 
critical level of SKUs (“stock keeping units”) 
to be maintained in the branch with 100 per 
cent ﬁll rates – high levels of availability of 
a wide range of SKUs is critical to our 
customers’ businesses. While the top 
SKUs are therefore immediately available 
in branches, the remaining SKUs are readily 
available from hubs or distribution centres. 
Over the medium term we will progressively 
move to a local service common process 
business model as we standardise core 
processes to achieve beneﬁts of scale 
and productivity – but these will be executed 
at the right level and location in each 
business unit. 
Best customer service
The central theme of this year’s annual report 
is “Best customer service, every day”. It is a 
critical element of our value creation strategy 
since we deliver for our customers through 
our people every day – we want highly 
engaged employees at the front line and in 
the support functions, who work together 
to deliver excellent customer service. 
We are making progress in improving 
customer service in our businesses, 
which is something we measure 
systematically. The overall scores have 
continued to improve across the majority of 
our businesses and you can see our scores 
this year for our biggest business – Blended 
Branches in the USA – above. The elements 
of service that are valued by our customers 
are reasonably consistent throughout 
our business units and geographies. 
Clearly, we have some real strengths and 
the surveys we see show us that we deliver 
great service in many of our branches. 
However, they also show us areas for 
improvement down to speciﬁc branches and 
customers, which is data we can really act 
upon. The feedback has also reinforced the 
We will continue to 
extend our position 
in plumbing and 
heating and

aim to deliver  
growth ahead

Our values…
We act with integrity
We conduct all our 
activities with fairness, 
honesty and integrity.
We drive for results 
and improvement
We listen and respond  
to the needs of our 
customers, then exceed 
their expectations; we are 
not happy with the status 
quo, and constantly strive 
to improve.
We value our people
We understand, respect 
and value personal and 
cultural differences; we 
are open and honest  
in all our dealings with  
our people.
message that “price” as a choice factor 
continues to rank relatively low on many 
customers’ priorities behind product 
availability, staff knowledge, next day 
delivery and breadth of the product range – 
showing that some customers are willing to 
pay more for these beneﬁts. This gives me 
great conﬁdence that as we continue to 
improve service we can also incrementally 
improve gross margins. We have seen 
similar customer responses in many other 
markets. On pages 12 to 19, for each 
of the major elements of service, we have 
demonstrated how we are working across 
the Group to make improvements.
Corporate Responsibility
The Board and Executive Committee 
believes that the integration of Corporate 
Responsibility (“CR”) across the Group 
and the inclusion of broader social and 
environmental issues into our decision 
making will help Wolseley to achieve our 
business goals, act as a building block for 
growth in shareholder value and beneﬁt the 
communities in which we operate. We are 
now in our third year of measuring our 
progress and our drive for continuous 
improvement is set out on pages 48 to 61. 
The elements of our CR programme are 
really part of the way we do business. 
The new initiatives we have developed are 
intrinsically linked to improving productivity. 
For example, we have focused on 
improving health and safety performance, 
in part by reducing lost work days; we are 
delivering better customer service through 
a commitment to staff training and 
development; and for the ﬁrst time this 
year we are setting Group-wide targets 
to reduce energy and fuel consumption 
which in turn will reduce costs. 
Given the importance of people to our 
business, a major accomplishment over 
the past year was the creation of our ﬁrst 
People Strategy covering all Wolseley 
employees worldwide. Our analysis showed 
that we have high levels of engagement, 
strong values and behaviours compared 
with best in class companies. Equally as 
important though are areas where we know 
we can improve, such as diversity and 
workforce planning, and we have set up 
best practice teams in order to address 
these important issues. 
Priorities
As we look forward we remain optimistic 
about the opportunities to grow and develop 
the business. Whilst the current economic 
uncertainty is likely to put ongoing pressure 
on like-for-like sales volumes in parts of the 
business, the opportunities to grow the 
business remain very positive and Wolseley 
is well placed to take advantage of this given 
the strength of our balance sheet. Our 
ﬂexible cost base will enable us to respond 
quickly and effectively to any economic 
headwinds which we may face in the year 
ahead. We will also continue to drive our 
productivity initiatives to ensure that we 
operate the lowest cost platform in the 
industry underpinning our expectation of 
further improvement in the trading margin 
over the medium term. Strong cash ﬂows 
should enable us to continue to reward 
shareholders and invest in organic growth 
as well as value-creating bolt-on acquisitions.
Finally I would like to build on Gareth’s 
comments about our employees. It is an 
enormous privilege to lead this Company 
and I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank all our employees worldwide for their 
dedication and commitment. People are the 
lifeblood of our business – it is through them 
that we deliver the exceptional customer 
service I so often see in our branches.

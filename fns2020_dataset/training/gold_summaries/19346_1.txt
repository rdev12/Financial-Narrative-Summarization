“AS A COMPANY WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON 
OUR MANAGEMENT AND  ENGINEERING 
EXCELLENCE. I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND 
THE BOARD’S GRATITUDE TO OUR 
DEDICATED WORKFORCE WHICH INCLUDES 
 SOME OF THE MOST TALENTED OIL AND 
GAS ENGINEERS IN THE  INDUSTRY TODAY.”
“I am delighted to report 
another set of record 
financial results in terms of 
revenues, margins, and 
profitability. This 
performance is all the more 
impressive as it has been 
achieved during what has 
been, and continues to be a 
difficult trading cycle for the 
global oil and gas sector, 
driven by the significant fall 
in the oil price and related 
geopolitical circumstances. 
Despite the challenging 
backdrop, the year under 
review has been a 
transformational one for 
Plexus in terms of new 
strategic and product 
developments. We continue 
to develop the Company into 
a leading international 
wellhead engineering 
company supplying the best 
in class and safest wellhead 
equipment across 
exploration, production and 
subsea arenas, utilising our 
proprietary patented POS-
GRIP method of engineering. 
As such we remain as 
confident as ever in the 
superior nature of our 
technology and the 
important role it will play in 
the coming years, not only 
in our traditional European 
market, but globally as we 
look to continue to increase 
our international footprint. 
Following this strong 
performance, we are pleased 
to report a 182% increase in 
the final dividend to 1.75p 
per share which includes a 
special dividend payment to 
deliver an additional return 
to shareholders supported 
by our current strong cash 
position.
“Our proprietary POS-GRIP 
wellhead systems meet the 
critical safety and 
performance demands 
required of wellhead 
technology across all 
pressure spectrums. As 
exploration and production 
of oil and gas continues to 
pursue ever deeper and 
more complex formations, 
particularly for HP/HT 
environments, the need for 
innovative, safe and 
effective wellhead 
technology is being 
increasingly recognised by 
both regulators and 
operators. However 
conventional technology has 
known limitations and we 
maintain that for a variety 
of technical reasons 
wellheads have been, and 
continue to be the weak link 
in the well architecture 
chain which I believe needs 
addressing.
“Specifically there is a 
massive divide between 
qualification test standards 
to which wellheads and their 
casing hangers (the last 
connection of the casing 
pipe) and annular seals have 
historically been held by 
common industry test 
standards as compared to 
those required for premium 
casing couplings, 
(notwithstanding that both 
products effectively do the 
same job in a well). Further 
our design makes the casing 
hanger a much simpler 
object, which rather than 
being made up of as many 
as twenty parts is made

from a single piece, 
significantly reducing the 
number of installation steps 
required by conventional 
systems. Therefore on the 
basis of current test 
standard levels, all subsea 
annular seals currently used 
in the market are a weak 
link, and one that in subsea 
applications is never truly 
tested after installation, and 
which furthermore has no 
means of monitoring for 
integrity and remedial 
intervention.
“For these reasons it is very 
pertinent and topical for us 
that the recent Volkswagen 
‘emissions rigging’ scandal 
has thrown a spotlight on 
the veracity of laboratory 
test standards. This 
developing story supports 
what I have been saying for 
a long time and demonstrates 
to me that when test 
standards and operating 
conditions move beyond 
what technology can 
achieve, then managers and 
engineers will conspire to 
artificially meet such 
standards so that 
qualification tests can be 
passed with inferior 
solutions, or indeed industry 
then lobbies to have test 
standards set at levels to 
which they can comply, even 
if not applicable to ‘real 
world’ conditions.
“I maintain that in the oil 
and gas industry key 
standard setters have 
managed to do both where 
wellheads and wellhead 
seals are concerned. Firstly 
they managed to convince 
the regulator that casing 
hangers and their seals only 
need three temperature and 
pressure cycles to be proven 
suitable for use forever and 
a day. Conversely, as 
operating conditions have 
moved onto HP/HT 
conditions, casing coupling 
(under pressure of end 
users), have now advanced 
to more than 1,700 test 
cycles. Secondly, casing 
hangers and annular seals 
are tested in fixtures which 
have no connection to ‘real 
world’ conditions. Rather 
than testing the full 
assemblies as a system, 
annular seals are allowed to 
be qualified as a single 
component, in specially 
configured fixtures, which 
eliminates movement and 
without any axial and 
bending loads being applied 
during pressure cycle testing 
as happens in the field. It is 
therefore disappointing that 
operators are planning to 
rely on these absolutely 
critical seal systems in 
subsea applications that 
may in the future operate 
under 20,000 to 30,000 psi 
gas pressures. The 
importance of meaningful 
and realistic testing was 
underlined recently by Sir 
James Dyson who was 
quoted as saying, “It seems 
that industry is rife with 
manufacturers engineering 
to find their way around 
tests, rather than 
engineering better, more 
efficient technology. This 
behaviour is seriously 
misleading customers”. This 
statement is of course in 
relation to a consumer 
product and its relative 
performance, whereas in our 
industry we should be 
placing safety and the 
environment first and 
foremost, which should lead 
to the genuine desire to 
only use the best and safest 
available technology.
“The significant time and 
cost savings that we can 
deliver are of course 
extremely relevant to a 
trading environment where

operators are looking to 
drive down the costs of new 
projects by 20-30%. This 
means that at the surface 
and subsea, POS-GRIP 
technology simply sets a 
standard no other wellhead 
technology can match. 
Encouragingly it has been 
reported that following the 
Volkswagen incident 
European regulators want to 
bring in real world tests by 
2018 that look at emissions 
from cars on the road, 
rather than in laboratories, 
and I believe that the oil 
and gas industry regulators 
should be taking a similar 
stance in relation to 
wellhead seal test standards 
and methodology. Perhaps 
the regulators are finally 
beginning to realise, as a 
journalist recently reported, 
that artificial outcomes 
often start in laboratories, 
and the gap between a well-
designed test and reality 
need not be huge, but bright 
minds will soon find out how 
to arbitrage the two. To this 
end it is positive that 
standard setters are 
beginning to recognise that 
new standards are required 
to address the new more 
challenging drilling 
conditions and enhanced 
regulatory scrutiny, and we 
believe that we are already 
in a position to meet these 
in a way that conventional 
wellhead designs cannot.
“In tandem with positioning 
Plexus as the supplier of 
choice in the standard 
pressure and HP/HT 
exploration markets in 
Europe, we have also been 
highly active during the past 
year in beginning to more 
actively market our products 
into new operating regions 
in line with our strategy to 
significantly increase the 
global reach of our wellhead 
equipment, offering 
significant growth 
opportunities. In line with 
this and following the 
establishment of our 
Malaysian and Singaporean 
hubs, we have substantially 
built on our existing position 
in the Asian region where we 
have achieved a number of 
significant milestones 
throughout 2014 and 2015.
“Post-period end in July 
2015 we had a flurry of 
activity starting with the 
signing of a pivotal licencing 
agreement with Yantai Jereh 
Oilfield Services Group Co., 
Ltd (‘Jereh’), a leading 
Chinese oil services provider 
to facilitate the rental, sale, 
and manufacture of our 
wellhead equipment into the 
important Chinese, wider 
Asian, Brazilian, Indian and 
Middle Eastern oil and gas 
markets. I see this latest 
agreement as an important 
building block for the 
transition of Plexus from 
being a niche supplier of 
specialist rental exploration 
wellhead equipment into the 
main stream volume market, 
allowing us to engineer and 
manufacture our best in 
class high standards whilst 
capitalising on being able to 
reduce operator’s costs. 
Alongside this first major 
licencing agreement a share 
subscription agreement was 
also entered into, and 
another entity in the Jereh 
Group subscribed in July 
post period end for 5% of 
the issued share capital of 
Plexus for a consideration of 
£8.04m.
“This was closely followed 
by a collaboration agreement 
with China Oilfield Services 
Limited (‘COSL’) a major 
integrated oilfield service 
solution provider which is

majority owned by Chinese 
state owned company 
CNOOC Group, Red Sea 
Technologies Ltd, a leading 
oilfield design and services 
company in South East Asia, 
and Jereh. This will see all 
parties explore commercial 
opportunities for shallow 
water subsea and crossover 
wellhead production systems 
for oil and gas field activities 
in China.
“The importance of China 
and Chinese trading partners 
has of course been  brought 
into sharp focus during the 
recent five day visit in 
September to China by 
George Osborne who 
declared that the UK should 
not be running away from 
China, that Britain should be 
“China’s best partner in the 
West”, and that we should 
“create a golden decade for 
both of our countries”. I 
certainly echo those 
sentiments and this month’s 
milestone state visit by the 
Chinese President Mr Xi 
Jinping further underlined 
the scale of these 
opportunities when the 
President said “As an old 
Chinese adage goes, 
opportunity may knock just 
once; grab it before it slips 
away”, and that as “China-
UK comprehensive strategic 
partnership enters the 
second decade this year, let 
us seize the opportunity, 
and work together to usher 
in an even brighter future 
for China-UK relationship”. 
For such reasons I am very 
excited about our new 
relationship with Jereh 
which only commenced in 
July, and I am confident 
that Jereh’s considerable 
manufacturing and 
commercial skills will blend 
well with our technology to 
create considerable value 
for both companies over the 
coming years.
“A third Asian development 
at the end of July 2015, was 
the announcement that we 
had secured in August 2014 
a local Petronas licence to 
supply our POS-GRIP 
equipment in Malaysia 
through PPA. As a result of 
these three major strategic 
moves, and on-going 
relationship building 
initiatives in other areas of 
regional importance such as 
the Gulf of Mexico (‘GOM’) 
and Russia, (where in the 
coming years, and of course 
subject to sanctions the 
Arctic will become very 
important requiring the very 
best and most convenient 
wellhead sealing technology) 
I believe that we are ideally 
placed to continue to 
increase our global reach.
“I am especially proud to 
report on the launch of our 
new Python subsea wellhead 
at SPE Offshore Europe 
Conference & Exhibition 
2015 (‘OE2015’), Europe’s 
biggest oil and gas trade 
show. This was the result of 
over four years of research 
and development supported 
by our Joint Industry 
Partners, BG, eni, Royal 
Dutch Shell, Maersk, Total, 
Wintershall, Tullow Oil, 
Senergy, and Oil States 
Industries Inc. The new 
Python Subsea Wellhead has 
been designed to address 
key technical issues and 
requirements highlighted by 
regulators following the 
GOM incident in April 2010 
and to achieve a new best in 
class standard for subsea 
wellheads. Entering the 
global subsea market has 
always been part of our 
strategy to expand the 
Company’s suite of POS-
GRIP wellhead equipment 
into larger fast growing 
markets. Subsea exploration 
and production has grown 
rapidly since 2000 in terms 
of total expenditure from 
USD$7billion to 
approximately USD$45billion 
in 2014. According to a 
report by Rystad Energy in 
May 2014 this strong growth 
is expected to continue, 
with subsea expenditure 
forecast to grow by an 
annual rate of 15% to 
USD$115 billion by 2020, 
making it a highly attractive 
market, and one that 
demands new technology 
and engineering solutions. 
We anticipate that our 
ground-breaking technology,

to product will be ready for 
offshore deployment in a 
trial well during the second 
half of 2016 and we look 
forward to updating the 
market further.
“Finally as a Company we 
pride ourselves on our 
management and 
engineering excellence. I 
would like to extend the 
Board’s gratitude to our 
dedicated workforce which 
includes some of the most 
talented oil and gas 
engineers in the industry 
today. Without our team we 
would not be able to win 
milestone contracts where 
only the best equipment will 
suffice such as with the 
recently announced £3.3m 
contract with Total for the 
Solaris well offshore Norway 
for which our technology 
was specifically chosen, and 
which is thought will be the 
highest pressure well ever 
drilled in the North Sea at 
up to 17,000 to 19,000 psi. 
The future opportunities for 
Plexus, in both our core 
markets and with ancillary 
new POS-GRIP developments 
such as our POS-SET 
Connector for the 
decommissioning market, 
are clearly exponential and 
we believe that we will 
continue to attract new 
customers worldwide either 
directly or through licensees 
as the wider industry places 
increasing emphasis on the 
development of HP/HT 
reserves. I look forward to
updating our valued 
shareholders on our latest 
organic and strategic 
developments throughout 
the rest of 2015 and 
beyond.”

“Our technology
programmes are
moving the Group 
to higher value
products.”
Broadening its routes to market 
and moving to higher value technology
remain the two key drivers to future
earnings growth for AMS. The Group has
made considerable progress in both of
these areas during 2004.
Technology Platforms
The Group has established a broad range
of material technologies for advanced
woundcare and wound closure with
strong IP protection, manufactured in
dedicated state-of-the-art medical device
facilities in the UK.
In advanced woundcare, a full range of
materials are available covering: alginate,
film, foam, hydrocolloid and hydrogel.
A major trend in the market is the
inclusion of antimicrobials such as silver
into the wound dressings to help prevent
infection from a wide range of micro-
organisms including MRSA. AMS has
evaluated a number of silver
technologies as a way of upgrading our
base woundcare range with higher value
products.
A silver fibre based alginate range has
been licensed exclusively on a global
basis to Johnson & Johnson Wound
Management, who launched this into the
US market in April under their
SilverCel™ brand. Following receipt of
European regulatory approval at year
end, this product has now also been
introduced into the European market.
In response to demand from existing
partners for the addition of silver to their
current alginate range, a new product
has been developed utilising a different
silver technology. 510(k) clearance for
US sale was obtained in August and this
product has now been introduced by a
number of partners. This product will be
progressed through European regulatory
approval during 2005.
With two distinct silver technologies, the
Group is well placed to address the
dynamic silver market.
Improved alginate, foam and
hydrocolloid products have been
developed during 2004 and discussions
are in progress to start commercialising
these technologies in 2005. Good
progress has been made in expanding
our scar therapy business based on our
proprietary foam technology. Building on
the success of the product supplied to
Novartis Spain for treating Caesarean
section scars, a clinical trial was
conducted in Holland with good results
on a variety of scars. Based on this data
the product range has been launched
into Sweden and into the US private
label OTC market through a strategic
partner.
A major technology platform for AMS is
medical grade cyanoacrylate (super-glue)
tissue adhesives, which is the basis of
our market leading LiquiBand™ range in
the UK Accident and Emergency (A&E)
arena.
A product aimed specifically at closing
surgical incisions in the operating room
environment, LiquiBand Surgical™, was
launched at the beginning of 2004. This
product comprises a fast-setting adhesive
for closing the incision and a liquid
bandage which is painted over the wound

LiquiBand Flowcontrol™ LiquiBand™ to protect it against moisture and
infection. Clear benefits over stitches and
staples have been demonstrated to the
surgeon, post-operative nursing staff and
patients, particularly with large incisions
such as Caesarean sections, breast
surgery and total hip replacements,
where prevention of infection and
cosmetic outcome are key considerations.
Many surgical procedures are now
conducted by laparascopic or keyhole
surgery. A product specifically targeting
wound closure following minimally
invasive surgery has been developed and
is expected to be introduced throughout
Europe during 2005. These procedures
are becoming increasingly popular in
many countries and this product will
complement the use of LiquidBand
Surgical™ which is more suited to larger
wounds.
The licensing and UK launch of a unique
skin closure system, Skinlink™
announced in December, significantly
strengthens our wound closure product
portfolio. The product, licensed from
Canadian company Biogentis, consists of
a perforated adhesive strip on which an
anchoring adhesive is applied. This
offers significant benefits over current
products such as sutures, staples or
conventional adhesive strips in closing
wounds where medical glues are
inappropriate, for instance where there is
significant swelling, tissue loss or skin
tension such as over joints.
Development activity continues utilising
our liquid film technology. Projects with
partners are under way for products used
for protecting skin from breakdown and
for treating minor cuts and grazes. 
Routes to Market
AMS has commercialised its advanced
woundcare technology through branded
partners using a business to business
model.
Whilst allowing a broad global presence
to be built with major global and regional
partners under their brands, it has proved
to be challenging for the Company to
achieve consistent growth in revenues
and margins and to extract sufficient
value for its R&D investments.
One of the synergies of the acquisition of
the MedLogic tissue adhesives business in
2002 was that it brought a direct UK sales
and marketing infrastructure that could be
exploited for taking the Group’s advanced
woundcare products direct to the NHS. 
Additionally, the market trend identified last
year, whereby major distributors are looking
to source standard woundcare products
under their private labels whilst the major
woundcare companies are increasingly
focusing on higher value products, has
significantly strengthened.  AMS remains
ideally placed to take advantage of this
trend and is actively doing so.
AMS’s strategy to broaden its routes to
market by offering its new differentiated
products to the major players as they
upgrade their product range, whilst
providing generic products through private
label distributors or direct to the NHS in
its home market, is proving successful
and has contributed to the increased
growth in sales achieved in 2004.

“Our direct sales

has established
market leadership for
LiquiBand
™
tissue
adhesive for wound
closure in A&E
departments.”
The introduction into the US and Europe
of a silver fibre alginate dressings range
by Johnson & Johnson Wound
Management under their SilverCel™
brand, as part of their active wound
dressings range, is a good example of
licensing new, differentiated technology
to a major player. With their strong
global presence and commitment to
inventive products for chronic and acute
wound management, they are an ideal
partner for the marketing and
distribution of this technology.
Significant private label activity has
been seen in 2004 with many of the
major US distributors contracting for
supply of standard woundcare products.
AMS is currently working with a number
of these, with the three-year Cardinal
agreement signed in July being a major
step forward to entering this market
segment. Cardinal Health is a leading
provider to the healthcare industry and is
ranked 17 in the Fortune 500 (2004).
Good progress has been made in
accessing the Far East market. A
collaboration agreement was signed in
May with Nitto Medical, a division of
Japan’s £2 billion turnover Nitto Denko
Group. This agreement allows Nitto to
undertake market evaluation and
regulatory approval of a number of
AMS’s woundcare products with the
option of entering into marketing and
distribution agreements for Japan. Two
product groups have been identified
initially with one of these submitted for
regulatory approval. New marketing and
distribution agreements were signed 
with InterPharma for Australia and
DKSH for Malaysia, Hong Kong, Vietnam
and Pakistan.
The launch of our branded ActivHeal
®
woundcare range into the NHS offers
AMS a major growth opportunity. It is
estimated that the NHS currently spends
in excess of £100 million on advanced
woundcare dressings for use in hospitals,
nursing homes and community care.
ActivHeal
®
is a rational response to the
high profile cost pressures on woundcare
budgets whereby savings made on
standard products for routine wounds
allow funding of higher technology
products for problematic wounds.
As a UK-based technology company with
a major focus on advanced woundcare 
R&D and manufacturing, AMS is ideally
placed to become a new generation
supplier through a balance of innovation
and cost management by integrating
with the end user market. This allows
significant cost savings to be achieved
by the NHS along the lines of the highly
successful generic pharmaceutical
model, limited only by the ability of
individual hospital trusts to grasp the
opportunity. ActivHeal
®
was included on
the NHS hospital contract for England in
December, Scotland in January 2005
and is available on the Drug Tariff
allowing the products to be prescribed.

The key driver of the UK direct business
continues to be the LiquiBand™ tissue
adhesive range. LiquiBand™ and
LiquiBand Surgical™ have now been
introduced into many countries in
Europe. A distribution deal was signed
with Resorba Clinica GmbH who
launched in Germany in June and
regular business is now being achieved
from distributors in Italy, Denmark and
Norway. Discussions are well advanced
for Spain and France. Opportunities for
collaborations with strategic partners for
regulatory approval and introduction of
these products into the US and Japanese
markets are under discussion. In both
markets the regulatory approval pathway
is lengthy and expensive.
There has been a high level of interest
from potential partners for the US who
see the opportunity of replicating the
success achieved in the highly
competitive UK market in the much
larger developed US market. This 
market is estimated to be approaching
$100 million.
Summary
Woundcare is a $15 billion market
growing at 10%, of which AMS is
actively participating in an available
market of around $400 million.
The Group has broadened its routes to
market during 2004 and is well
positioned to exploit key market trends
towards advanced woundcare dressings
containing antimicrobials such as silver
and the use of tissue adhesives for
closing wounds.
With strong technology platforms and an
improved financial position, AMS is well
positioned to deliver a high value
woundcare technology company.

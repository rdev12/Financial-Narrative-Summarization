Overview:
Chairman’s 
statement
Financial results 
Revenue from continuing operations grew 
by 14% to £131.2 million (2012: £115.1 million) 
with lighting segment revenue growth of 51% 
to £68.5 million (2012: £45.5 million). Group 
contribution margin from continuing operations 
reduced from 46.1% to 44.7% due to the effects 
of the downturn in the Obstruction business. 
However, contribution margins in the Lighting 
segment grew from 44.3% in 2012 to 45.5% 
in 2013. 
Underlying profit from operating activities 
from continuing operations was £14.5 million 
(2012: £19.6 million). Non-underlying costs 
of £2.9 million (2012: £nil) were incurred during 
the year including an intellectual property past 
use access fee of £1.4 million, relating to a 
one-off payment for access to certain patents 
and intellectual property over the last five years, 
goodwill and asset write downs of £0.8 million 
and employee severance, restructuring and 
other costs of £0.7 million. Profit from operating 
activities was £11.6 million (2012: £19.6 million). 
Whilst 2013 has been a 
challenging year for Dialight, 
the belief in the opportunity and 
the determination to achieve our 
strategic goals is undiminished. 
There is real enthusiasm at the 
way we have addressed key 
issues within the obstruction 
business, whilst still managing to 
achieve growth in our industrial 
lighting business.
During the year under review the Group 
delivered profit at a level that was lower than 
expectations. As a matter of good governance, 
the Audit Committee, following discussion with 
the full Board, has undertaken an assessment 
of the Group’s forecasting and performance 
process. The Audit Committee was supported 
in this by KPMG Audit plc (“KPMG” or “Auditors”), 
who were engaged to provide critical challenge 
of the 2013 reforecasting and 2014 forecasting 
process. This assessment has highlighted 
a number of process improvements, the 
implementation of which has begun. The review 
has been fully embraced by the Interim Chief 
Financial Officer and it is envisaged that 
following completion of these improvements, 
the Group will have a much more robust and 
focused system of internal control that will 
support Dialight’s growth in the coming years.
Profit before tax was £11.2 million 
(2012: £19.8 million). There was a profit 
after tax on the disposal of discontinued 
activities of £0.7 million (2012: £0.1 million).
Basic underlying earnings per share (“EPS”) 
was 30.8 pence (2012: 41.7 pence) with 
basic EPS of 26.2 pence (2012: 42.0 pence). 
At 31 December, net cash was £7.1 million 
(2012: £15.0 million).
Dividend
The Board is recommending, subject to approval 
by shareholders, a final dividend of 9.5p giving a 
total dividend for the year of 14.4p (2012: 13.5p). 
This will be paid on 3 June 2014 to shareholders 
on the register at the 2 May 2014.
Developments
During the year we established Dialight Brasil 
Participacoes Ltda (“Dialight Brasil”), opening 
sales opportunities to the Mercosul region. It is our 
intention to start some light assembly of Dialight 
products in this region in 2014. Additional 
operational capacity was also added at our 
manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and Mexico. 
This will provide all of the operational support 
required to meet the Company’s growth in the 
immediate future. 
Staff
Our employees continued to work hard 
throughout the year and their efforts are 
gratefully received. I thank everyone for their 
continued commitment, support and hard work 
both in 2013 and going forwards in 2014.
Board changes
Two new Non-Executive Directors, Stephen Bird 
and Tracey Graham, joined the Board on 
10 January 2013 and have made an excellent 
contribution during that time. 
Mark Fryer left the Company on 15 January 2014. 
We wish him well for the future. An executive search 
firm has been engaged to find his successor. 
In the meantime, Kevin Higginson has joined 
the Company as Interim Chief Financial Officer, 
but has not been appointed a statutory Director.
Full details on the Board can be found 
on pages 38 to 39.
Outlook 
With market-leading innovative products, 
expansion of our sales channels and continued 
buoyancy in the industrial lighting market, the 
Board expects to drive strong Lighting growth 
for 2014 and the years to come. This, combined 
with a stabilisation of the Signals business, 
leads the Board to expect a return to earnings 
growth in 2014.

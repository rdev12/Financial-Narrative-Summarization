 Quantica plc 
Annual Report 2003
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 02
Financial results in brief
I am delighted to announce that significant progress
was made in 2003, particularly in the second half.
My comments about “light at the end of the tunnel”
in the interim statement appear to be correct. Net fee
income and operating profit from continuing operations
in the second half of the year improved considerably
compared to both the first half, and the second half
of last year.
Turnover for the year ended 28 November 2003 was
£24.9m (2002: £26.1m). Net fee income was £12.0m
(2002: £11.7m) with operating profit before exceptional
costs and amortisation of goodwill at £2.2m (2002:
£2.1m). After exceptional costs incurred in the first
half of £0.6m, associated with the closure of our
Technology office in Hemel Hempstead, and the
amortisation of goodwill of £0.4m, the pre-tax profit
was £0.8m (2002: pre-tax loss of £3.4m). Operating
margins (before exceptional items, amortisation of
goodwill and impairment losses) increased to 8.9%
(2002: 7.9%) reflecting both the maintenance of
gross margins and tight control over our cost base.
Cash inflow before financing was £0.5m (2002: £2.0m
outflow). At the half-year net debt stood at £7.8m
reflecting the cost of closing the Hemel Hempstead
office. Cash generated in the second half was £0.9m,
demonstrating the Company’s ability to generate cash
even when activity levels are increasing and reducing
net debt at the year end to £6.9m (2002: £7.4m).
Full year earnings per share (before amortisation of
goodwill and exceptional costs) increased by 18%
to 3.33p (2002: 2.82p). Basic full year earnings per
share after amortisation of goodwill and exceptional
costs was 1.30p (2002 loss: 9.11p).
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 1.0p
(2002: 1.0p) per Ordinary share for the year ended
28 November 2003 which, if approved by shareholders,
would give a total dividend for the year of 1.0p
(2002: 1.0p). The dividend will become payable
on 17 April 2004 to shareholders who are on the
register on 19 March 2004.
The financial results are discussed in detail in the
Financial Review on page 8.
Business progress
Strong progress has been made over the year in all
areas of our business. Run-rates and margins have
improved in the second half both over the equivalent
period last year, but more significantly, over the first
half of 2003.
The Healthcare Division continued to grow strongly.
Volumes, gross margins, and profitability all
increased over the year. Three quarters of our
business is dedicated to social care which is driven
by the demographics of an ageing population.
The introduction of Care Standards and associated
regulatory frameworks, whilst increasing cost in
the short term, have increased barriers to entry into
the market and will prove beneficial in the longer term.
The remainder of our business is primarily in the
professional disciplines of Social Work, Occupational
Therapy and Physiotherapy. This mix of business
has protected us from some of the margin pressure
reported in other areas of the sector.
The Legal Division has had a better year in 2003,
increasing operating profit substantially from what
was a particularly difficult 2002. Both provincial and
City markets recovered to some extent, albeit not
to the levels of earlier years.
Search & Selection remains an extremely resilient
business. Trading in the second half was as good
as the first half which was strong, and considerably
better than the same period last year. Operating
profits for the Division once again increased on
a year-on-year basis. Our reputation has been built
upon our ability to deliver a highly effective
recruitment service. This is evidenced by the very
high success rates on assignments and the level
of repeat business obtained by this Division.
The Technology Division had a mixed year.
The underachieving Hemel Hempstead office was
closed at a cost of £0.6m, as stated in the interim
announcement, and the remaining contract business

I am delighted to announce that
significant progress was made in 2003,
particularly in the second half.

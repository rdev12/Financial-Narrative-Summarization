Trading
I am delighted to report further 
outstanding growth during the last 
financial year. Our overall sales increased 
by 18.2% compared with the equivalent 
52 week period in the prior year. Like-for-
like sales were extremely strong in the 
first half and the momentum carried 
through to a full year increase of +8.0% 
(again on a 52 week basis) – significantly 
beating the overall homewares market. 
We have delivered these results by 
retaining a sharp focus on the four 
priorities which continue to form our 
growth strategy.
Priority 1 – open more superstores
We opened 10 new superstores in the 
year, adding over 300,000 square feet of 
selling space. As at the year-end, our 
superstore chain comprised 94 stores 
(including two stores previously treated 
as high street shops) with 2.8m square 
feet of selling space. 
We have opened two further stores since 
the year-end in Milton Keynes and Torquay 
and we are contractually committed  
to nine more units which are due to  
open in the current financial year, one 
being a relocation of an existing under-
spaced superstore. 
Our recent openings have all traded well. 
Our target is for new stores to pay back 
their ingoing investment within 36 
months on a discounted cash flow basis, 
but we have consistently beaten this.  
The actual payback period for the last  
30 openings is expected to be around  
26 months on average. 
Taking confidence from the performance 
of both new stores and the existing  
chain, we have increased our target for 
national coverage in the UK from 150 to 
200 superstores. 
Priority 2 – further develop our specialist 
position
We know that it is essential for us to keep 
evolving our retail proposition. We remain 
as passionate as ever about giving ‘Simply 
Value for Money’ to all our customers – a 
combination of good quality products at 
great prices, industry-leading choice, 
deep availability and friendly service. 
Recent developments in our offer include 
the following:
D o r ma •	 . We continue to roll out 
dedicated Dorma centres which are 
now represented in 32 stores. We have 
extended the range of products sold 
under the Dorma brand to include 
bathroom, gift and tableware lines.
W i n d o w	t r e a t m e n t s / D u n e l m	A t	H o m e •	 . 
We developed some time ago a more 
integrated and space-efficient way of 
merchandising products relating to 
windows (curtains, blinds, tracks and 
poles, fabrics, nets and voiles). This 
execution of the offer is now present in 
26 stores. In addition, we now 
supplement our in-store offer with a 
free home consultation service, 
branded Dunelm At Home, which 
allows customers to select from our 
range of window treatments with the 
help of an advisor in their own homes. 
This service is currently provided from 
30 stores.
F ur n i t ur e •	 . We have completed a  
full review of our furniture ranges,  
and created an extended furniture 
department in several of our 
larger stores.
K i tc h e n •	 . We have created a radically 
different version of our traditional 
kitchen department. The new concept 
divides the offer between cooking, 
dining and utility and offers much 
deeper ranges in each of these areas, 
supported by new display methods and 
greater space allocation. This concept 
has been introduced to 15 stores 
to date.

Chief Executive’s statement co nt i n u e d
M i s s	I t	M i s s	O u t •	 . We have evolved our 
use of “Miss It Miss Out” campaigns to 
signpost great customer deals, and we 
are increasingly using this mechanism 
to clear discontinued lines outside of 
our traditional sale periods. This further 
adds to the variety and interest of our 
in-store offer.
We have continued investing to improve 
the shopping environment in our older 
stores. We completed nine major refits in 
the last financial year (2009 – six). The 
total cost of a refit including the impact of 
sales disruption is typically around £0.8m 
per store; this includes any expenditure 
necessary to maintain the fabric of the 
building. Sales uplifts in refitted stores 
have run approximately 10% ahead of 
trend. Going forward we plan to continue 
investing judiciously in major refits whilst 
also taking opportunities to refresh stores 
through smaller interventions. 
Priority 3 – grow Dunelm Direct
During the last financial year we 
successfully implemented a new software 
platform for our on-line business (www.
dunelm-mill.com and www.dorma.co.uk ). 
This has enabled us to offer a much 
improved experience for on-line visitors as 
well as giving customers the option of 
collecting on-line purchases in store.
At launch of the new platform we were 
able to offer approximately 7,000 lines for 
sale; this number has now doubled. 
We continue to invest in this channel, with 
regular enhancements to functionality 
and further expansion and strengthening 
of the Dunelm Direct team.
As a result of this focus, we continue to see 
strong growth in on-line sales. Dunelm 
Direct is now consistently ranked amongst 
our top 10 stores in sales terms and we  
are confident that further growth will 
be achieved.
Priority 4 – develop and exploit our 
infrastructure
We continue to extract further benefits 
from our IT systems, enabling us to 
improve stock control and make in-store 
processes more efficient. 
We have doubled the space available to us 
at our Stoke warehouse, to 500,000 
square feet. Assuming that the proportion 
of merchandise distributed via Stoke 
remains constant, this will give us the 
capacity to support growth in our store 
estate for the foreseeable future. 
To support our continuing growth, we 
have acquired a plot of freehold land for a 
new head office near to our existing base 
in Syston, Leicester. Construction of a new 
building is under way and we expect to 
relocate in mid-2011. 
Current trading 
We are clearly operating in challenging 
economic conditions, and we expect  
to see continuing pressure on 
consumer spending. 
Despite this backdrop, we are confident 
that Dunelm will demonstrate resilience, 
benefiting from our focus on continuing to 
deliver ‘Simply Value for Money’ and our 
low average transaction values, and that 
the business will continue to grow and to 
strengthen its position in the UK 
homewares market.
Performance in the early weeks of our new 
financial year has been pleasing, given 
strong performance in the comparative 
period last year.
Board change
As our Chairman explains in his statement, 
I will shortly be handing over my 
responsibilities as Chief Executive to Nick 
Wharton, allowing me to take on the new 
role of Executive Deputy Chairman.
I am delighted that we have been able to 
attract somebody with Nick’s talent and 
energy to become our next Chief 
Executive. He is a great addition to the 
Dunelm team and I very much look 
forward to working with him.
I have been privileged to run Dunelm over 
the last 15 years and I feel invigorated  
by my forthcoming new role which will 
allow me to spend much more time on  
the areas where I believe that I can add  
the most value.  
As the Group’s largest shareholders, my 
family remain totally committed, both 
emotionally and financially, to Dunelm  
for the long-term and we are as excited  
as ever about the next phase of its 
development which will take place under 
Nick’s leadership. We are convinced that 
these changes will underpin the long-term 
development and success of the Group.

Chairman’s statement
Full Year Results
Record turnover and profits were achieved 
in 2010.
Turnover was over £1 billion for the first 
time at £1,001.9m, up 21.1% on 2009’s 
£827.5m. Pre-tax profits increased 78.1% 
to £192.3m (2009: £108.0m). Continuing 
earnings per share were up 77.3% at 
95.4p (2009: 53.8p).
Demand was strong in all business 
areas within both sectors and across 
all major geographies. Latin America, 
Asia and Africa accounted for 32.4% of 
Group turnover and that does not include 
ingredients we sell in Europe and America 
where our customers export finished 
products to consumers in those markets.
Consumer Care turnover was up 14.0% to 
£516.4m (2009: £453.1m). All business 
areas recorded at least double digit 
growth, with Personal Care and Crop 
Care leading the way. Operating profit 
increased 31.8% to £136.5m (2009: 
£103.6m).
Industrial Specialities turnover was up 
29.7% to £485.5m (2009: £374.4m). Our 
strategy to focus on lower volume, high 
specification, high quality ingredients 
to our five markets was central to our 
progress. This further benefitted the 
operating profit where profits rose 
246.9% to £62.1m (2009: £17.9m). 
The first half of 2009 had been adversely 
affected by customer destocking as a 
result of the recession but nevertheless 
this was a very pleasing result. 
Return on sales increased to 12.8% 
(2009: 4.8%), beating our previous 10% 
target and making good progress towards 
the new, more challenging 15% goal.
Cash flow was again very impressive with 
a £68.2m reduction in net debt. EBITDA 
drove the result, which was achieved 
despite a working capital increase as 
activity levels rose dramatically.
Disposals and Acquisitions
We continue to streamline the business 
and focus on high value speciality 
products.
On 10 May 2010 we announced that we 
had agreed to sell the Emmerich site 
and associated business in Germany to 
KLK Emmerich GmbH, a subsidiary of the 
KLK Group, for €55.0m. As part of the 
transaction, the purchaser assumed the 
IAS 19 retirement benefit obligations 
relating to the business of €38.4 million 
so that cash payable at completion was 
€16.6m.There was an exceptional profit 
before tax on the sale of £0.9m.
In November 2010 we bought out our 
joint venture partners’ 40% share in our 
Indonesian company for $1.6m. Since 
the year end we have sold our 60% 
shareholding in the Korean joint venture 
to the non-controlling shareholders for 
£2.2m. Korea remains an important 
market for Croda and our sales, 
distribution and technical operations 
in the country are unaffected by the 
disposal.
All these businesses were acquired with 
Uniqema in 2006.
Martin Flower 
Non-executive Chairman
Croda has delivered an unbroken run of continuing 
sales and profit growth for over ten years. This is a 
testament to the focus on a clear strategy which is 
communicated and executed throughout the business. 
This year has seen record results, with strong 
demand, tight cost control and the benefits of past 
restructuring producing the uplift.
Turnover was 
over £1 billion

Retirement Benefits
Our gross IAS 19 pension deficit reduced 
from £203.5m to £147.8m. The sale of 
Emmerich in May 2010 was the biggest 
element of the reduction as it removed 
almost all of our pension liabilities in 
Germany. The deficit was then further 
reduced in 2010 by additional Company 
contributions and increased asset values 
from stronger global equity markets 
outweighing increased liabilities as a 
consequence of slightly lower corporate 
bond rates. 
Dividend 
Given the strong performance across all 
our businesses, the Board will propose an 
increase in the final dividend of 68.3% 
to 25.25p (2009: 15.0p). This will give a 
total dividend for the year of 35.0p, up 
62.8% on 2009’s 21.5p.
Share Buyback 
With Croda’s performance and prospects 
being so strong it makes sense to 
maximise our investment in the 
business through capital expenditure and 
acquisitions where appropriate. 
We expect to increase capital expenditure 
in 2011 to a higher level than that seen in 
recent years in order to increase capacity, 
but there is a limit to what can be spent 
in any one year without disrupting 
operations.
Despite this increase, we expect to 
generate a significant amount of cash in 
2011 and with our net debt to EBITDA 
ratio already below one times, we believe 
that returning excess cash to shareholders 
by resuming our share buyback 
programme is a logical move. We see the 
programme as tactical and continue to 
monitor suitable acquisition opportunities. 
In the absence of such acquisitions, we 
would expect to buy shares worth around 
£50m in the market over the next year.
Outlook 
The strong trading performance during the 
fourth quarter has continued into 2011. 
We are continuing to see significant raw 
material inflation and have increased our 
prices as we entered the year to protect 
our profitability. Across both Consumer 
Care and Industrial Specialities, our global 
markets continue to grow and we are 
confident of making further progress in 
the current year.

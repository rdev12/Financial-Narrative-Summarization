Significant
gains... Group report and accounts 2005 |  3
It is my pleasure to report that 2005 
has been a year of considerable
achievement for Imprint Plc (“Imprint”),
with the continued delivery of our
strategy to build a multi-sectored
international recruitment business. 
The year included the successful
acquisitions of Accreate, ECHM and
Morgan McKinley, strong organic
growth, two new office openings and
the consolidation of our back office
support functions. Therefore, I am
pleased to report significant gains in
market share in both our ongoing and
acquired businesses across a range of
sectors, a substantial increase in
adjusted earnings per share, trading in
line with the Board’ s expectations and a
promising outlook against encouraging
trading conditions.
Our achievements in 2005 are
principally a result of the hard work,
commitment and loyalty of the Group’ s
employees and I should like to take this
opportunity to thank them all.
Financial highlights
The financial performance during the
year underlines the progress of the
Group. Adjusted earnings per share
(being diluted earnings per share
adjusted for goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items) were 15.1 pence.
Before tax, adjusted earnings per share
increased by 211% to 20.2 pence (2004 –
6.5 pence). Basic earnings per share
were 8.5 pence (2004 – 7.2 pence).
Turnover increased almost six-fold to
£54.8 million through a combination of
strong organic growth and the
acquisition of two major UK
recruitment companies, ECHM and
Morgan McKinley, which together trade
a significant volume of temporary
placements. Net fee income (gross
profit) increased by 335% to £31.8
million, which included growth in the
ongoing business of 78%, from £7.3
million to £13.0 million.
I am pleased to report a full year
operating margin (being the conversion
rate of net fee income into operating
profit
2
) of 22.2% and operating profit
2
of
£7.1 million, both of which have been
achieved alongside continued strong
investment in increased headcount and
new office openings. This profit was five
times higher than 2004 and included a
158% rise in operating profit
2
from
ongoing operations.
Profit before tax increased by 262% to
£4.5 million (2004 – £1.3 million) after 
a £1.3 million charge for goodwill
amortisation and £1.3 million of
exceptional costs resulting from the
integration of the acquisitions and
subsequent restructuring of the 
Group’ s operations.
The Group’ s balance sheet has
strengthened with net current assets of
£9.4 million (2004 – £4.0 million), cash
of £3.2 million (2004 – £2.5 million) and
banking facilities available to the Group
of £5.5 million.
I am very pleased to announce our
intention to declare a dividend of 2p
per share in respect of 2005. This will 
be the Group's first dividend since
becoming a public company in May
2001. It is in recognition of both the
progress achieved since the listing and
our confidence in the Group's
prospects going forward. This dividend
will be paid on 12 June 2006 to those
shareholders on the register at 12 May
2006.
Acquisitions and share placings
As part of our strategy at this stage of
the business cycle, we have previously
stated that growing the Group rapidly is
in certain areas best served by
acquisitions that meet strict operating,
cultural and valuation criteria. We
identified and completed the following
acquisitions during 2005: 
ECHM
On 5 January 2005 Imprint acquired the
entire issued share capital of ECHM
Group Limited (“ECHM”) for a total
consideration of approximately £9.6
million. This acquisition was funded
primarily through the placing of 7.14
million new ordinary shares at £1.40 per
share on 5 January 2005, a total of £10.0
million of new equity but also through
the issue of 1,650,000 new ordinary
shares at £2.20 per share to ECHM’ s
vendors on 26 April 2005 in full and
final settlement of the contingent earn
out consideration which was previously
part of the acquisition terms.
Morgan McKinley
On 26 April 2005 Imprint acquired the
entire issued share capital of Morgan
McKinley Group Limited (“Morgan
McKinley”) for a total consideration of
approximately £24.8 million. This
acquisition was funded by £18.0 million
of new equity (via the placing of 8.18
million new ordinary shares at £2.20 per
share), the issue of 1.11 million new
ordinary shares to Morgan McKinley’ s
management and £4.3 million of cash.
Accreate
On 7 September 2005 Imprint acquired
the entire issued share capital of
Accreate Limited (“ Accreate”), one of
Ireland’ s leading financial recruitment
companies, for an initial consideration
of £2.1 million (h3.1 million) and a
further potential £3.4 million (h5.0
million). This acquisition was funded by
£1.1 million of cash and the issue of
0.36 million new ordinary shares to
Accreate’ s management.
Further details on these acquisitions 
are included in the Chief Executive’ s
Review, the Company Overviews, the
Directors’ Report and in Note 22 of the
Financial Statements.
Board of directors
On 26 April 2005 Robert Thesiger, who
has been Chief Executive of Morgan
McKinley since 2003, was appointed to
the Imprint Board as an executive
director, as announced at the time of
the acquisition. Robert, who has been
with Morgan McKinley for eight years,
brings 12 years of recruitment industry
experience to the Board, initially at
Badenoch & Clark where he established
their financial services business and
subsequently at Morgan McKinley,
where he has built up the consultancy’ s
market share to be one of the top three
providers of temporary and permanent
professionals to the City of London. 
The Board is delighted with the
contribution Robert has already made
to the Group’ s strategic and operational
management in the short time since 
his appointment.
Current trading and outlook
The strong trading experienced during
2005 has continued into 2006 and is 
in line with the Board’ s expectations.
The Group expects further growth in
profitability in 2006.
Our strategy of transferring acquired
brands between offices and geographic
regions has been successful and offers
the Group further organic profit
enhancement opportunities. In
addition, we continue to review
expansion through start-up operations
in new sectors and geographical
markets. I look forward to 2006, as
Imprint continues to execute its
carefully planned strategy.

 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
During 2015, we continued to make significant progress in enhancing 
the overall efficiency of our operations. Although we experienced  
some challenges, Acacia remains on track to deliver long-term value.
Dear shareholders,
2015 was another year of transformation 
for Acacia as we progressed the 
mechanisation of Bulyanhulu and 
commenced underground operations  
at North Mara. We delivered increased 
production for the third consecutive 
year, albeit at marginally lower levels 
compared to original expectations.  
With our continued investment into  
the turnaround of Bulyanhulu, costs 
remained flat year on year, which 
together with the average realised  
gold price being over US$100 per  
ounce lower year on year, impacted  
on free cash generation. 
Our ongoing turnaround has taken place 
against a negative market backdrop  
for the broader mining industry. The 
economic slowdown in China impacted 
demand for the majority of industrial 
metals and commodities, leading to  
a significant fall in physical prices which 
has been reflected in equity valuations. 
The gold price was by no means 
immune from the broader mining sector 
malaise, and reached a six-year low  
of US$1,049 per ounce in December. 
Having performed very strongly towards 
the end of 2014, Acacia’s share price 
fell by 29.5% over 2015, reflecting the 
lower gold price and the operational 
challenges experienced during the year. 
In light of the poor market conditions, 
both the Board of Directors and the 
Executive Leadership Team have 
unanimously volunteered to take  
a 10% reduction in pay in 2016.
“To demonstrate our commitment  
to providing returns to shareholders 
and our confidence in the ability  
of the business to generate cash flow, 
the Board has recommended a final 
dividend of US2.8 cents per share.”
Board composition
2015 was a year of stability for the Board as 
we embedded the talent added over the past 
two years. As part of this process, we undertook 
an extensive review of Board activities. We  
also undertook our first externally-facilitated 
Board performance evaluation. This confirmed 
that the Board, and its respective Committees, 
had operated effectively throughout the 
reporting period and has helped to shape  
our focus areas for 2016.
All Directors will stand for re-election at the 
2016 AGM, save for Graham Clow who has 
decided not to stand in order to concentrate on 
other interests. We would like to thank Graham 
for his many contributions to the Company  
and wish him well for the future.
Final dividend
In 2014, we amended our dividend policy 
to ensure that it is more closely aligned with 
the cash generation potential of the business. 
As such, it is now based on operational cash 
flow after sustaining capital and capitalised 
development but before expansion capital and 
financing costs, rather than on net earnings.
As a result of the net cash decrease for  
the year, strictly following our dividend policy  
would imply no final dividend be recommended 
for the year. However, to demonstrate our 
commitment to providing returns to shareholders, 
the strength of our balance sheet and to  
signal our confidence in the ability of our 
business to generate cash flow, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of US2.8 cents 
per share. Subject to shareholder approval  
of this recommendation at the AGM on  
21 April 2016, the final dividend will be paid  
on 27 May 2016 to shareholders on the register 
as of 6 May 2016. The ex-dividend date is 5 May 
2016. Together with our interim dividend of 
US1.4 cents per share, this represents a full 
year dividend of US4.2 cents per share.

Outlook
Whilst we encountered challenges in the 
year, the team continued to make significant 
improvements to the business as we moved 
through 2015. The hard work and commitment 
of the management team and those at the 
operations led to increased production from 
2014 levels, and has orientated the business 
to deliver positive cash flows in 2016 at levels 
well below the current gold price. 
Looking forward to 2016, we plan to consolidate 
the significant changes that the team has 
made over the past two years to provide a 
platform for operational stability going forward. 
We will continue to identify and implement 
further potential efficiencies within the 
Company, and our focus this year will be on 
improving productivity as we have now largely 
completed the re-engineering of our operations 
and the rightsizing of our workforce. 
On behalf of the Board, I sincerely thank all 
Acacia employees for their hard work and 
dedication over the past year. I would also like 
to thank our shareholders for their continued 
support and commitment to the Company.

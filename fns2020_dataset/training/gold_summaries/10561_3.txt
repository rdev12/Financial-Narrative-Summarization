30 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 
 Annual Report 2009
Chairman’s statement
Overview
In my Chairman’s statement last year 
I commented that I believed that the  
Group’s strategy of reducing its exposure  
to economically cyclical, more commoditised 
markets would stand us in good stead  
to weather the very difficult economic 
circumstances that we expected to lie ahead 
in 2009. The past year has confirmed this 
view and Morgan Crucible has shown real 
resilience in its performance during the  
most severe downturn in global industrial 
production that we have seen in most of  
our lifetimes. 
The changes to the Group’s portfolio  
in recent years, with the disposal of 
under-performing and cyclical businesses 
combined with the acquisition of higher 
margin, more differentiated businesses,  
have delivered significant improvements  
in Morgan Crucible’s through-cycle margins. 
Specifically, at the beginning of 2009  
we acquired a further 11% stake in NP 
Aerospace, taking the Group’s equity 
holding to 60% and enabling us to 
consolidate NP Aerospace in Morgan 
Crucible’s financial results. The remaining 
40% stake will be acquired in annual 
tranches of 10% from 2010 to 2013.  
NP Aerospace’s strong business in ballistic 
armour protection delivered an excellent 
performance at a time when general 
industrial markets were significantly 
depressed. As we look to the future, the 
goal for your Board is to leverage Morgan 
Crucible’s extensive global footprint to 
develop opportunities for NP Aerospace 
beyond its traditional position as a 
predominantly UK-focused business.
Both NP Aerospace and the technical 
ceramics businesses acquired in 2008  
from the Carpenter Technology Corporation 
have delivered operating profit margins well 
Morgan Crucible has  
shown real resilience in its 
performance during the 
most severe downturn in 
global industrial production 
that we have seen in most 
of our lifetimes.

into double digits in a particularly  
difficult macroeconomic environment.  
This, combined with a robust performance 
from the existing businesses, has helped  
the Group deliver overall operating profit 
margins before restructuring and one-off 
costs of 9.4%.
I am pleased with the results delivered  
by Morgan Crucible in such a challenging 
market environment. Group revenues  
for the year were £942.6 million compared 
to £835.0 million in 2008. Operating profit 
before restructuring and one-off items was 
£89.0 million compared to £108.8 million in 
2008, and underlying diluted earnings per 
share was 12.6 pence (2008: 22.8 pence). 
From a balance sheet perspective, a strong 
and consistent focus on cash generation 
during the year resulted in net debt being 
reduced from a £290.4 million opening year 
position to £252.7 million by the year end. 
Dividend
The Group’s resilient profit performance  
and solid cash generation mean that  
the Board is confident to recommend 
maintaining a final dividend of 4.5 pence 
per Ordinary share. This brings the total 
dividend for the year to 7.0 pence.
Board
Given the extreme volatility of the market 
environment, your Board remained very 
close to the operational performance of the 
business during 2009. A significant amount 
of our time was focused on ensuring that 
the right mitigating actions were taken 
quickly and decisively in the face of the 
global industrial downturn to ensure that 
the cost base remained as closely aligned  
to revenue demand as possible. This close 
operational cost base focus was a key factor 
in delivering the robust profits and margins 
that were achieved in 2009.
Outlook
As we look forward, we remain cautious  
on the outlook for the world economy 
which we believe still faces a number of 
challenges and uncertainties as various 
national stimulus packages are withdrawn. 
However, encouragingly, in the latter  
parts of 2009 we did begin to see  
signs of modest demand recovery in  
our business, particularly in the Chinese  
and Indian markets. 
Regardless of whether the economic 
outlook remains depressed or does  
indeed begin to show recovery in 2010,  
I am confident that Morgan Crucible is a 
more resilient, higher quality business that  
is well equipped to thrive and prosper in  
the future.
It has been, undeniably, a difficult market 
environment in 2009. That the Group has 
prospered during this period and that it is 
so well positioned for the future is due, of 
course, to the hard work and commitment 
of all our employees around the world.  
The Board is grateful as always for all that 
they have achieved.

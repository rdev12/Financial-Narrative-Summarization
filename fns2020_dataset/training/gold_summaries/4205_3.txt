Chairman’s statement
2009 was another record year for Croda, producing pre-tax 
profits 10.5% up on 2008 despite one of the deepest global 
recessions of all time. The constant focus on product innovation, 
markets and customers, combined with ongoing cost reduction, 
has enabled us to achieve another year of pre-tax profit growth 
despite challenging conditions in the global economy.
Full Year Results
Revenue increased by 0.6% for the year 
to £916.2m (2008: £911.1m). This result 
was boosted by favourable currency 
translation (+11.8% versus 2008) that 
mitigated significant first half volume 
losses in Industrial Specialities. Falling 
commodity prices reduced output prices 
in Industrial Specialities but had little 
effect on Consumer Care. 
Turnover was up 11.8% in Consumer 
Care and down 9.0% in Industrial 
Specialities as we continued to focus on 
quality of business over volume growth. 
Consumer Care achieved an operating 
profit increase of 17.2% and in Industrial 
Specialities profits declined by 35.1%. All 
the reduction came in the first half, with 
the lack of the previous year’s £8.2m 
glycerine pricing windfall adding to the 
effects of market destocking. A return 
to growth in sales and operating profit 
occurred in the second half.
Pre-tax profit was up 10.5% to £106.4m 
(2008: £96.3m). Restructuring and cost 
savings following the acquisition of 
Uniqema in 2006 continued throughout 
2008 and 2009, boosting return on sales 
to 13.1% despite the adverse effects of 
the recession and glycerine pricing.  
A largely non-cash cost increase of £3.9m 
relating to share based payments as a 
result of the strong share price in 2009, 
and the reduction in the IAS19 pension 
funding credit of £6.4m were broadly 
balanced by a currency translation benefit 
of £11.1m. Falling debt levels and lower 
global interest rates significantly reduced 
underlying interest costs. Continuing 
earnings per share before exceptional 
items increased 10.4% from 48.0p in 
2008 to 53.0p in 2009.
Cash flow was particularly impressive 
with net debt falling £109.6m to £288.5m 
(2008: £398.1m). Strong EBITDA was 
boosted by working capital reductions 
as we completed the post Uniqema 
reorganisation of our selling and 
distribution arrangements. Favourable 
currency translation accounted for 
£21.7m of the reduction in net debt. All 
this meant that our key banking ratio, net 
debt to EBITDA, fell below two times, 
significantly below our covenant limit of 
three times.
Retirement Benefits
The IAS19 pension deficit increased to 
£203.5m (2008: £88.5m). The market 
value of investments increased but the 
discount rates used to calculate the 
schemes’ liabilities fell, despite rising 
inflation expectations, due to a reduction 
in corporate bond yields.  3
Restructuring
During the year we announced the 
closures of our sites at Bromborough 
in Merseyside and Wilton in North 
Y orkshire. Bromborough ceased 
production in November 2009 and its 
results are treated as discontinued as 
we have exited the specific commodity 
markets supplied by this site. Wilton 
ceased production in January 2010. 
Since nearly all products at Wilton 
are being transferred to other Croda 
sites worldwide, this business has been 
treated as continuing in 2009 and 2008.
Dividend 
The Board has proposed an increase in 
the final dividend of 10.7% to 15.00p, 
taking the full year dividend to 21.50p, 
up 8.9% on the 19.75p paid last year. 
In 2008, we stated that in future our 
dividend increases would be ‘more 
aligned’ with earnings growth achieved. 
This was a change to our previous 
policy of more modest dividend growth 
as we improved dividend cover.
Outlook
The strong trading performance 
during the fourth quarter of 2009 
has continued into 2010 and we 
are confident of achieving significant 
progress in the current year.

Our industry
The water industry in England and Wales 
invests more than £3 billion a year and 
employs over 27 ,000 people. There are 
currently 10 water and sewerage companies 
in England and Wales.
Our sector is facing signiﬁcant long term 
challenges. The privatisation of the industry 
just over 20 years ago led to improvements 
in services to customers, better quality 
drinking water and higher environmental 
standards. It also attracted new investment. 
Those successes, however, have also had 
consequences, such as high levels of debt, 
rising prices for customers and increased 
carbon emissions. Our proposals for 
changes in our industry are helping us to 
play a role in shaping the debate. We talk 
more about our position and how other 
bodies with a stake in our industry are 
responding on pages 20 and 21.
Our business
Severn T rent Water is a regulated business. 
We work within ﬁve year price cycles, with the 
prices we charge our customers set at the 
beginning of each cycle by our economic 
regulator, Ofwat. These ﬁve year cycles are 
known as Asset Management Plan (AMP) 
periods. We have just reached the end of the 
ﬁrst year of AMP5. 
Our performance
Every June, all water companies submit 
a detailed annual breakdown of their 
performance, known as the June Return,  
to Ofwat. Ofwat uses this information to 
monitor and compare companies’ 
performance. 
As well as being regulated by Ofwat, our 
performance is monitored by:
• the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI), 
which is responsible for making sure we 
comply with drinking water quality 
regulations. 
• the Environment Agency, which controls 
water abstraction, river pollution and 
ﬂooding.
We also work with the government 
(including the Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the 
Welsh Assembly government) and other 
agencies such as the Consumer Council for 
Water (CCWater) and Natural England to 
make sure we meet the highest customer 
service and environmental standards, while 
offering our customers the lowest prices.
Our vision for the future
Our 25 year Strategic Direction Statement 
sets out the long term direction and 
development of our group for the years 
2010–35 (see ‘Our strategy’, page 8).

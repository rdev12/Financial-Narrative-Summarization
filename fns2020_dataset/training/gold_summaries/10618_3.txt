 14	 Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Chairman’s	
statement
It has been a busy year in the 
transformation of Mothercare plc. 
I am pleased to say that the group’s 
profi tability has improved from last year 
in line with market expectations for the 
fi rst phase of our Transformation and 
Growth plan. This has been achieved 
against a backdrop of considerable 
change in the organisation: 
 A Simon Calver started as our Chief 
Executive on 30 April 2012 and has 
brought about a fundamental change 
in many parts of the Company and its 
culture. He has led formidably from 
the front in putting our customers back 
into the heart of everything we do. 
 A Simon has appointed fi ve new 
members to his executive committee 
during the year, culminating with the 
arrival of Matt Smith as the Chief 
Financial Offi cer in March 2013. This 
has allowed for a thorough evaluation 
of the way the organisation is structured. 
The group is now more customer 
focused and effi cient as we restore 
the profi tability of the UK business 
and continue to grow internationally. 
 A I welcome Lee Ginsberg, Angela Brav 
and Imelda Walsh as new non-
executive directors. All have commercial 
expertise which will complement 
Mothercare’s business. Lee has 
replaced Bernard Cragg as the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and Imelda Walsh will become Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee after 
the Annual General Meeting in July.
 A On behalf of the board, I should like 
to thank Bernard Cragg and David 
Williams, both of whom retired after 
nine years as non-executive directors 
and Chairman of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees respectively, 
for their considerable and insightful 
contributions to the business.
 A Our International business has continued 
to grow with strong like-for-like sales, 
expansion into new countries, and 
supported by growth in retail space 
(and the development of an online 
platform) from our franchise partners.
 A Our UK business is focusing on 
providing quality and value to our 
customers, both online and in our 
stores where customers receive the 
expert help that our store colleagues 
can provide. Over the year, it has 
reduced losses by rationalising its 
cost base and closing over 50 
loss-making stores.
 A The business is reshaping itself to 
meet the changes in shopping habits 
of customers and the online 
experience and delivery that 
customers expect.
 A We have launched exciting new 
products, such as the Innosense 
feeding range and the Xpedior 
pushchair, and new Value clothing 
ranges, all of which have been well 
received by our customers.

Overview
I recognise that the group still has a long 
way to meet all the objectives of its three-
year Transformation and Growth plan 
but each of these developments is 
signifi cant. I am confi dent that my 
board will provide the appropriate 
governance and oversight of the group, 
and this will be a critical factor to 
delivering success.
Finally, Mothercare is all about 
partnership and I would like to thank 
all those involved with our great brands. 
The contribution of our store colleagues 
at Mothercare and ELC has been 
excellent, as has that of our head offi ce 
in the UK and our overseas sourcing 
offi ces. Again, I recognise the strength 
of support that the whole group has 
received from its franchise partners 
around the world which gives us the 
inspiration to improve year on year.

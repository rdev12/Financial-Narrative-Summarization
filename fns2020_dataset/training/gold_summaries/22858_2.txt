“2016 has been a year of significant progress for 
Defenx, our first full year as a public company 
following our IPO in December 2015.
I believe that Defenx is in a strong position to 
continue its strategy to launch new products, 
enter new markets and broaden its management 
team in 2017; continuing to grow revenues and 
profits over the coming year in the ever-exciting 
mobile security software market.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our 
people and shareholders whose hard work and 
support have facilitated the growth achieved  
in 2016.”

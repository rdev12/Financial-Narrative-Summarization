 A proven strategy and business  
model that continue to deliver  
growth and value
Group Chief Executive Officer’s review
Weak commodity prices 
persisted with debilitating 
outcomes for many. 
Polymetal, however, 
bucked the market  
trends and delivered  
a strong set of results.
If 2013 was a testing time for gold miners, 
then 2014 will be remembered as the  
year when commodity-price weakness 
persisted with material consequences 
within the global mining industry. Many 
companies were forced to make cuts in 
exploration and development spending as 
well as operating and capital expenditure.
For Polymetal, however, it was a different 
story. We continued to deliver on our 
promises and demonstrated resilience  
to both current market trends and 
geopolitical challenges.
Outstanding operating 
performance
For the third consecutive year, we  
beat our production guidance despite 
challenging market conditions. Our gold 
equivalent (GE) production was 1.43 Moz 
(2013: 1.28 Moz), up by 12%. This 
exceeded both our original production 
guidance of 1.3 Moz of GE by 10%  
and the updated guidance of 1.365 Moz  
(by 5%).
Annual gold production for the year 
increased by 17% to 945 Koz 
(2013: 805 Koz). Annual silver production 
rose by 5% to 28.7 Moz (2013: 27.2 Moz). 
Gold production now accounts for  
over two-thirds of our total revenue –  
69%, up from 63% in 2013.
The full ramp-up of our Mayskoye 
underground mine and strong operational 
delivery at the Dukat and Omolon hubs 
were the key drivers in helping us achieve 
these record figures for the business.  
At Mayskoye, the total gold produced 
during 2014 increased almost three-fold 
to 142.6 Koz (2013: 48.4 Koz), due  
to a full year of design throughput  
and recovery. We also commenced 
concentrate processing at the Amursk 
pressure oxidation (POX) plant while  
sales of concentrate to China more than 
doubled. Our state-of-the-art Amursk 
POX plant performed in line with 
expectations and we exceeded design 
recoveries for both Albazino and 
Mayskoye concentrates.
Growth by strategic acquisition
Our high-grade assets and the 
completion of a major construction cycle 
in advance of the drop in the price of gold 
put us in a unique position in the sector. 
We entered the year with a strong cost 
and operating profile and comfortable 
leverage. The turn of the commodities 
cycle created a window of opportunity  
for Polymetal and allowed us to invest  
in an exciting growth project, Kyzyl.
Located in a traditional mining region  
with good infrastructure in northeastern 
Kazakhstan, Kyzyl is ready for fast-track 
development. The project exactly matches 
our strategic target characteristics: a 
large, high-grade asset with a clear path 
to production and cash flow generation, 
which leverages Polymetal’s core 
strengths in selective mining and 
refractory ore processing.  
As a result of the acquisition, our gold 
equivalent reserves increased by about 
50%. The project has a mine life of at 
least 20 years with substantial exploration 
potential, allowing us to deliver significant, 
long-term shareholder value. This 
acquisition also leverages our business 
presence in Kazakhstan, where we have 
been operating successfully since 2009.
With all our production assets operating 
stably, our main focus has shifted  
to delivering growth post-2017. We  
are concentrating on Kyzyl and other 
development projects: Svetloye, where 
construction will begin later this year with 
a view to production starting in Q3 2017 , 
and our greenfield PGM (platinum group 
metals) exploration projects.
Capital discipline delivers returns
On the back of a very successful 
production year, Polymetal was  
also able to deliver a solid financial 
performance, due in part to the current 
macroeconomic environment in Russia. 
The devaluation of the Rouble against  
the US Dollar and the two-fold drop  
in the price of oil were significant factors 
in bringing down operating costs across 
the business and the corresponding 
increase in free cash flow generation.
Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 15%  
to US$685 million, while pre-acquisition 
free cash flow more than doubled to 
US$306 million. The underlying return  
on equity (excluding non-cash foreign 
exchange losses and impairments) 
increased from 9% in 2013 to 21% in 2014. 
This has allowed us to offer a substantial 
58% dividend payout in the reporting year, 
while maintaining a comfortable leverage 
ratio of 1.82x Net debt/EBITDA.
Our commitment to capital discipline  
has been – and will remain – central  
to our ability to deliver such a dynamic 
financial performance. Even after a major 
investment like the Kyzyl acquisition,  
the Company is able to continue paying 
regular dividends and declare a special 
dividend, while still maintaining 
comfortable leverage levels.
Employee safety and  
well-being are paramount
We are saddened to report the loss of 
three colleagues during 2014 and also 
one workplace fatality at a contractor’s 
operation. The increased fatality rate  
is of great concern at both Board  
and executive management level.  
Our investigations show that the lapse  
in safety performance was in part due  
to the increased scope of underground 
mining in complex geotechnical 
conditions at these operations.
It is vital that we significantly reduce  
risks and improve health and safety 
performance during the year ahead, 
aiming for zero fatalities in 2015. We have 
already launched new risk assessment 
systems and the implementation of 
additional measures to ensure proper 
enforcement of existing safety standards 
and management procedures is under 
way. We are also actively reinforcing  
the need for individual responsibility  
for personal safety and risk awareness 
across our operating mines.
We continue to support the well-being  
of our employees and communities  
in the current complex macroeconomic 
environment in Russia. We are mindful of 
the need to take account of the increase 
in consumer prices and the inevitable 
impact this has on our workforce.  
We will be monitoring the situation  
and providing salary increases  
to match the rising inflation levels.
Looking to the future
At Kyzyl, initial exploration and testing  
is already providing more clarity and 
comfort regarding the chosen project 
development route. The pilot metallurgical 
testing confirmed the viability of ore 
flotation to concentrate and signals the 
potential to improve on the parameters 
achieved in previous testing. The 
decommissioning of old infrastructure, 
site clearing and various licencing 
applications – including environmental 
and social impact assessments –  
are all ongoing. We have successfully 
completed preliminary public 
consultations with the Bakyrchik 
community. The full feasibility study  
for Kyzyl is due to be published by the 
end of 2015 with the start of full-scale 
construction in 2016.
Our operating mines are set to deliver  
on our annual production guidance of 
1.35 Moz of gold equivalent for 2015;  
with current guidance for 2016 set at the 
same level. Our financial performance will 
inevitably be influenced by the Rouble 
devaluation and the drop in oil prices. 
This will support our cost performance 
and cash flow generation, despite being 
partially offset by rising inflation 
during 2015.
With that, I am confident in our outlook  
for Polymetal in 2015. We are committed 
to delivering value to our shareholders 
through meaningful dividend payments  
in the current market environment while 
preparing the Company for the next 
growth stage.

Strategic expansion and growth through...
...a selective acquisition strategy 
designed to increase our resource 
base for the long term
The successful Varvara deposit was Polymetal’s  
first investment in Kazakhstan
Significant new reserves
The acquisition provided an excellent 
opportunity for Polymetal to significantly grow 
its reserve base with a high-grade gold deposit 
in a well-known jurisdiction for the company.
Kyzyl is ready for fast-track development  
and increases Polymetal’s gold equivalent 
reserves by about 50%. The project features 
the large, high-grade Bakyrchik property, 
which contains 6.7 Moz of gold at 7.5 g/t 
(JORC) and, based on existing reserves,  
a mine life of at least 20 years. There is also  
a significant exploration upside.
Processing competence
A key element behind the Kyzyl acquisition 
strategy was the opportunity it presented for 
Polymetal to take advantage of its process 
technology expertise. Polymetal expects  
to capitalise on its strengths in pressure 
oxidation, which will enable the Company to 
access the double refractory ores at the site, 
and a strong track record of refractory gold 
trading with third-party offtakers.
Timeline
We expect to have the permits and revised 
feasibility study for Kyzyl completed by the 
fourth quarter of 2015. We will be looking to 
start active construction sometime in the 
spring of 2016. The goal is to then produce 
the first concentrate in the third quarter of 
2018 before we ramp up to full capacity  
in 2019.
To fund construction, we will look at securing 
a project financing deal or use existing bank 
arrangements with the equity component  
to be sourced from existing operational  
cash flows.
Growing Kazakh portfolio
Polymetal’s footprint in Kazakhstan, where  
it is one of the only foreign-based companies 
mining for gold, takes a major leap forward 
with the acquisition of the Kyzyl project.
We first entered the country in 2009 through 
the acquisition of the Varvara project, which 
has since been developed into an open-pit 
operation that features a modern, 4.2 Mtpa 
capacity processing plant and produced 
106 Koz of gold equivalent in 2014.
Our commitment to establishing an 
extensive pipeline of growth projects 
has continued with the acquisition  
of the Kyzyl gold project. Based in 
one of Polymetal’s core jurisdictions, 
Kazakhstan, Kyzyl is set to become 
a priority development project  
for our Company.
Strategic rationale for the deal
Large high-grade reserves
•	 Mineral reserves: 6.7 Moz of gold  
at 7.5 g/t (JORC)
•	 Expected production start in 2018
•	 Expected annual gold production  
of 325-375 Koz
Significant exploration upside
•	 Substantial exploration potential 
through resource-to-reserve 
conversion
•	 Resources (additional to the 
reserves) of 3.8 Moz of gold at 
6.9 g/t (JORC)
Conventional mining
•	 Initial development via open-pit 
mining (up to 10 years of production)
•	 Cut-and-fill with consolidated backfill 
followed by underground mining
Refractory competency
•	 Leverages Polymetal’s core 
competencies in pressure oxidation 
(POX) processing and refractory 
gold concentrate trading
•	 Concentrate will initially be sold  
to offtakers
Favourable location within 
familiar jurisdiction
•	 Well-understood and 
straightforward operating 
environment – a country in  
which we have successfully  
operated since 2009
•	 Excellent infrastructure
 +16%
Reserve grade increase
Driven by the Kyzyl acquisition,  
and supporting our preference  
for high-grade assets
Matching our strategy
Strategic focus
The acquisition is consistent with the 
Company’s longstanding strategy to target 
high-quality, low-risk assets with large 
reserves and high grades.
Our Company will have the opportunity to 
leverage its competitive strengths in pressure 
oxidation and refractory gold concentrate 
trading once Kyzyl reaches production.
Kyzyl is located within a traditional mining 
region in northeastern Kazakhstan, 750 km 
east of the capital city Astana and 75 km west  
of Oskemen, a key mining and metallurgical 
industry centre. This location provides 
Polymetal with good access to established 
infrastructure, including power and rail.

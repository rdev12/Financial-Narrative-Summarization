Important information
United Utilities monitors a large number of financial and non-financial key
performance indicators (KPIs) to assess its performance. The non-financial 
KPIs include targets set by regulatory bodies. The group believes that
those featured provide an overall picture of its business. Additional non-
financial KPIs are provided in our online corporate responsibility report at 
unitedutilities.com/crreport2009. The 2010 corporate responsibility report
is expected to be published in September 2010.

Overview
It is impossible to talk about the Group’s
performance in 2015 without discussing the
almost unprecedented percentage increase in
the number of deaths compared to 2014. As
the chart below shows, a change of more than
five per cent has not been seen for over 40
years. Dignity’s role is not to speculate on why
this has happened, but rather to ensure our
business can respond to the resulting increase
in need for our services, without impacting the
quality of service we provide. I am delighted to
say that we achieved this. In 2015, 98.0 per
cent of clients stated they would recommend
our services, compared to 98.1 per cent in
2014. Similarly, 99.2 per cent of clients said
that we met or exceeded their expectations
which is unchanged from the previous year .
Corporate activity
The business invested £50 million in
acquisitions in the period, including £38.1
million to acquire 36 locations from Laurel
Funerals (‘Laurel’) in July 2015. These
acquisitions were all funded from the Group’s
cash reserves, as a result of the strong financial
performance and cash generation in the year .
These acquisitions are performing in line with
our expectations and contributed £2.3 million
of operating profit in the period, with £1.4
million of this being generated by the Laurel
acquisition. All these acquisitions represent
excellent investments for the business and
shareholders alike.
I am pleased that we also now have planning
permission for two crematoria. Whilst these are
both in the early stages of development and
will not open until mid-2017 or early 2018,
they represent a good long-term use of capital.
As we have seen with the other crematoria
opened in recent years, these locations will
probably take at least five to seven years to fully
develop their market share. 
Maintaining investment and development
momentum in our core business
Whilst a lot of time has been invested in
corporate activity in the year , we remain focused
on the value generated by our core business.
Investment in these locations has continued,
with a total of £15.6 million invested in the
period to ensure our properties and specialised
fleet are able to support the excellent service
we provide to the families we care for .
People and values
Our staff have performed tremendously this
year , responding positively to the sudden
increase in demands required to care for so
many families this year . We have chosen to share
the resulting financial success of the Group 
by paying a bonus of £1,800 for each full time
member of staff, a 64 per cent increase on the
amount paid per full time employee last year .
The total cost of the bonus is approximately 
£5 million (2014: £2.7 million).  
Quality and consistency of service delivery
remains our long-term focus
The business has yet again demonstrated its
robustness and is well placed for the future. 
We hope to achieve our medium-term target 
of10 per cent per annum increases in earnings
per share by staying focused on excellent
service, operating efficiently, selling pre-arranged
funeral plans, acquiring and developing quality
businesses where possible and keeping our
capital structure appropriately leveraged.

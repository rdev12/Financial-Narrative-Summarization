Genus at a Glance
Pioneering Animal Genetic Improvement
Genus provides farmers with superior 
genetics, so they can efficiently 
produce high-quality meat and milk. 
Our success has given us market-
leading positions. We have 26% of the 
porcine market, excluding China, more 
than double our nearest competitor,  
as well as 24% in beef and 8% of  
global dairy sales. The majority of our 
competitors are co-operatives, making 
Genus unique as a listed company.
What We Do
Genus is a world leader in applying 
biotechnology to advance the 
science of animal breeding 
and genetic improvement. 
Our technology is applicable 
to all livestock species and 
we currently commercialise 
it in dairy, beef and pork.
We breed the world’s best pigs 
and bulls, scientifically selecting 
livestock whose offspring will 
increase value for farmers and 
food producers around the world. 
In the porcine market, we offer 
genetically superior boars and 
sows that produce offspring with 
higher carcass value and desirable 
characteristics, such as feed-
efficient growth or leaner meat.
In the dairy and beef markets, our 
primary product is bull semen, 
enabling our customers to use 
artificial insemination to improve 
their herds and their efficiency.
How We Operate
Genus sells under well-known 
trademarks: ‘PIC’ for pigs and 
‘ABS’ for dairy and beef cattle. 
Our three business units are:
• Genus PIC, which serves porcine 
customers in North America, Latin 
America and Europe
• Genus ABS, which serves dairy 
and beef customers in North 
America, Latin America 
and Europe
• Genus Asia, which covers both 
porcine and bovine species in the 
fast-growing Asian market
Genus employs over 2,300 people, 
including 79 PhD scientists. We 
have five bull studs worldwide, 
and two porcine genetic nucleus 
farms, in South Dakota, US, and 
Saskatchewan, Canada. We use 
the porcine farms to improve 
the genetics we supply to both 
customers and third-party 
producers. These producers, 
known as multipliers, carry out 
most of our pig breeding needs.
Where We Operate
Genus companies operate in over 
25 countries on six continents. 
We also sell to customers in 
another 50 countries, through 
distribution partners. 
North America accounts for 
about 41% of sales, with Europe 
33% and Latin America and 
Asia each representing 13%.
A shared research and development 
function supports our operating 
divisions, with laboratories 
in Madison, Wisconsin, US. 
Our corporate headquarters 
are in Basingstoke, UK.

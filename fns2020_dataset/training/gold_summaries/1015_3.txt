Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
I am pleased to announce that 
during the past financial year, 
Animalcare has returned to growth 
and is now in a much stronger 
position to build on this in both the 
current and subsequent years. 
Animalcare is made up of three 
product groups: Licensed Veterinary 
Medicines, Companion Animal 
Identification and Animal Welfare 
products that are all sold mainly 
through veterinary practices. The 
Licensed Veterinary Medicines 
group, which continues to be the 
main focus of our investment, 
has grown strongly in the current 
year with sales up by 20.6%. The 
Management has stabilised the 
Companion Animal Identification 
group after a difficult year in the 
previous period.
Financial Trading
Group revenues during the financial 
year increased by 11.6% from 
£10.9m to a record £12.1m. This 
is in the context of latest market 
statistics which indicate that sales of 
veterinary medicines in the UK have 
been flat. This performance has 
resulted in an increase in underlying 
operating profits, pre-exceptional and 
other items, from £2.3m to £2.7m, a 
full 17.0%. Basic underlying earnings 
per share increased to 10.5p from 
9.3p. The Group continued to be 
strongly cash generative during 
the year with the cash position 
increasing from £2.3m to £3.7m at 
the year-end which demonstrates 
the strength of the business model. 
Additional sales coming from the 
Licensed Veterinary Medicine group 
enabled us to improve margins from 
54% to 56%. The main driver of the 
increased licensed veterinary sales 
was a replacement supply of ‘single-
dose’ Buprecare ampoules and the 
launch of two new licensed generic 
veterinary medicines.
Dividend
With the increase in cash generation 
during the year and the return 
to profitable growth, your Board 
proposes to increase the final 
dividend to 3.8 pence per share. 
With this increase of 0.8 pence per 
share, and the maintained first half 
dividend of 1.5 pence per share, this 
gives a total dividend for the year 
of 5.3 pence per share, an increase 
of 17.8%.
The Board
During the financial year, your 
Board announced that Stephen 
Wildridge would step down as 
Group CEO, to be replaced by 
Dr Iain Menneer, formerly Managing 
Director of Animalcare Ltd, and 
that Stephen would remain on the 
Board as Director of Strategy and 
Business Development until the 
end of October. This has allowed 
a smooth transition for Iain into the 
role of CEO and the appointment of 
a senior management team to head 
up sales, marketing and product 
development. The Board wishes to 
thank Stephen for all his endeavours 
in building your business over the 
past ten years into one of the leading 
UK animal health companies. Iain is 
ideally qualified to take on the CEO 
role with experience in a number 
of positions within the business 
over the past ten years including 
marketing, sales and business 
development.
Prospects
Your Board is pleased with the 
return to growth of your business 
over the past 12 months and 
believes it is in a strong position 
to deliver its stated strategy. Your 
Board is also encouraged by trading 
at the beginning of the current 
financial year.

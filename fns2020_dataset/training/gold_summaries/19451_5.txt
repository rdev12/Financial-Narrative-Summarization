2015 performance
2015 was a year of excellent growth and outperformance for RB, in  
the face of mixed market conditions. This strong, sustained growth 
across all of our key financial metrics has delivered significant value  
for Shareholders:
Rewarding 2015 performance
At RB, the remuneration packages are designed to support the 
philosophy of pay for performance and alignment between 
management and Shareholders.
Excellent performance has been delivered in mixed markets across our 
key performance metrics. Over the last three years, this sustained 
outperformance of RB’s underlying financial metrics has delivered 
outstanding Shareholder value in both absolute and relative terms.
The Remuneration Committee has assessed this performance delivered 
by RB, compared to the stretching performance targets set before the 
start of the performance period in line with the Remuneration Policy 
approved by Shareholders. Based on this, the 2015 bonus for Executive 
Directors paid out at 3.57x target and the LTIP in respect of three-year 
performance to 31 December 2015 vested at 80%.
Full details of RB’s performance against the metrics set for our annual 
bonus are set out on page 70, and the assessment of the LTIP vesting is 
detailed on page 71.
2015 single figure
The resultant ‘single figure’ of total remuneration is detailed on page 72 
and summarised in the chart below. As can be seen, the majority of RB’s 
total remuneration package is variable pay, linked to delivery of exceptional 
financial performance and creation of value for Shareholders. 
95% of the CEO’s total remuneration for 2015 is made up of variable 
remuneration linked to the achievement of stretching performance 
conditions, with in particular, more than 75% of his remuneration based 
on the long-term outperformance of the Company and delivered in RB 
shares. Furthermore, over half of the value of the CEO’s package is as a 
direct result of the significant share price growth over the last three years, 
which has seen RB create over £20.8 billion of value for our Shareholders.

Alignment between Executive Directors and Shareholders
Our performance linked remuneration package is underpinned by a 
meaningful share ownership policy, which drives a culture of ownership 
throughout the Company in order to further the alignment between 
our Executive Directors and our Shareholders. Executive Directors are 
required to build their share ownership over eight years and both have 
made good progress over the last 12 months.

Directors against their requirement as at 31 December 2015, which is

Annual Report on
Remuneration
Remuneration Committee membership in 2015
As of 31 December 2015, the Remuneration Committee comprised four 
Non-Executive Directors.
Name
Judy Sprieser (Chair) 
Nicandro Durante 
Doug Tough 
Adrian Bellamy 
During the year the Committee met four times. Further details on the 
members of the Committee during the year and on their attendance at 
meetings are provided in the Corporate Governance section.
The Committee’s purpose is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling 
its oversight responsibility by ensuring that remuneration policy and 
practices reward fairly and responsibly; are linked to corporate and 
individual performance; and take account of the generally accepted 
principles of good governance.
On behalf of, and subject to approval by, the Board of Directors, the 
Committee primarily:
• Sets and regularly reviews the Company’s overall remuneration 
strategy; 
• Determines the general remuneration policy for senior executives; 
and 
• In respect of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and members of 
the Executive Committee sets, reviews and approves: 
 – Remuneration policies, including annual bonuses and long-term 
incentives; 
 – Individual remuneration and compensation arrangements; 
 – Individual benefits including pension and superannuation 
arrangements; 
 – Terms and conditions of employment including the Executive 
Directors’ service agreement; 
 – Participation in any of the Company’s bonus and long-term 
incentive plans; and 
 – The targets for any of the Company’s performance-related bonus 
and long-term incentive plans. 
The Executive Directors are responsible for evaluating and making 
recommendations to the Board of Directors on the remuneration of the 
Non-Executive Directors. 
Members of the Remuneration Committee and any person attending 
its meetings do not participate in any discussion or decision on their 
own remuneration.
Shareholders approved RB’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy at the 2014 
AGM, which was operated unchanged in 2015. This was set out in full 
in the 2013 Annual Report and can also be found in the Corporate 
Governance section of our website at www.rb.com.
 
2015 Base Salary
Base salaries are reviewed taking into account the salary increases for 
the wider workforce and individual performance. For additional context 
the Remuneration Committee also reviews market practice for similar 
roles in the Company’s remuneration peer group, comprising 19 
international companies. As disclosed in last year’s report, following  
the review of salary levels in late 2014, the Committee approved the 
following base salary increases with effect from 1 January 2015:
Executive Director
Base salary at  
1 January 2014
Base salary 
from 
1 January 2015
Percentage 
increase
Rakesh Kapoor £865,000 £890,950 3%
Adrian Hennah £561,000 £577,830 3%
The base salary increases for Executive Directors take into account 
performance and follow the same base salary merit increase guidelines 
as other UK employees. The average salary increase for our UK 
employees was c.3%, effective 1 January 2015.
Annual bonus in respect of 2015 performance
Prior to the start of the year, the Remuneration Committee set 
stretching performance targets for the Executive Directors in 2015. As 
set out in last year’s report, these were based on absolute net revenue 
growth and net income growth, both measured in GBP at a constant 
exchange rate.
In line with the Remuneration Policy, threshold, target and maximum 
performance levels were set and calibrated such that at threshold, zero 
bonus is paid, with a target bonus opportunity of 120% of salary for 
the CEO and 90% of salary for the CFO. Performance under each of 
the measures is combined multiplicatively such that threshold 
performance, or below, results in a zero bonus and for truly exceptional 
performance the maximum bonus is 3.57x target bonus (428% of 
salary for the CEO and 321% for the CFO).
2015 was a year of excellent growth and outperformance for RB, which 
created significant value for Shareholders. In the face of mixed market 
conditions, the management team delivered exceptional growth and 
margin expansion, with consistent broad-based growth across both 
developed and developing markets.
The highlights of the 2015 performance include:
• Total Net Revenue growth of 5% based on constant exchange rates, 
with growth in like-for-like and continuing net revenue of 6%. This 
is the strongest like-for-like growth for six years and exceeds the 
targets set by the Committee.
• Gross margin expansion of 140bps to 59.1%, driven by mix, 
commodity costs and cost optimisation initiatives.
• Adjusted Operating Margin up 210bps to 26.8%.
• This results in excellent growth of 15% in adjusted net income, on  
a constant currency basis.
• This outstanding performance has resulted in a dividend payment 
which is in line with that delivered in 2014, despite the demerger of 
Indivior last year.
In line with our commitment to Shareholders we have continued to 
provide enhanced disclosure in respect of annual bonus achievements. 
The chart below illustrates RB’s actual 2015 performance compared to 
the threshold and maximum performance levels set by the 
Remuneration Committee.

LTIP vesting for performance to 2015
The CEO received an LTIP award in December 2012 and the CFO 
received his first award following his appointment in February 2013. 
Vesting of both of these awards was dependent on compound average 
annual growth (CAAG) in adjusted EPS over the three-year period 
ending on 31 December 2015, with the vesting schedule requiring 
performance above industry benchmarks for awards to be released.
The RB LTIP policy, approved by Shareholders, is designed to align 
participants with Shareholders through making awards with stretching 
performance conditions denominated in both share options and 
performance shares.
This ensures that value is only realised for participants if meeting the 
performance conditions is combined with sustainable long-term growth 
in RB’s share price.
For the 2013 LTIP award, the Remuneration Committee set 
performance conditions attached to vesting that required EPS growth 
over the three years to 2015 to be 6% per annum for threshold vesting 
and 9% per annum for the awards to vest in full – i.e. equivalent to 
29.5% growth over the three year period.
Despite excellent 2015 net income growth of 15% at constant 
exchange rates the adverse FX on translation reduced this performance 
by 4% in 2015. This follows the adverse impact of exchange rates in 
2014 of 10%, resulting in translational exchange rates negatively 
impacting the excellent underlying performance delivered over the last 
three years.
Earnings per share growth over the three year period 2013 to 2015, 
measured on constant currency basis, was 43%. However given the 
translation FX impact this reduced to 26.3% when measured on actual 
currency basis. This is equivalent to compound average annual growth 
of 8.1% per annum.
Despite the impact of exchange rate volatility on the excellent earnings 
growth, the Committee determined that the awards should vest in line 
with the vesting schedule, calculated on an actual currency basis. The 
outstanding performance over the last three years results in vesting of 
80% being achieved.
Over this three year performance period, the sustained outperformance 
of RB’s core underlying financial metrics has delivered an additional 
£20.8 billion in value to our Shareholders over the last three years, 
through the increase in the share price, dividends paid to Shareholders 
and the demerger of Indivior. 
£100 invested in RB on 1 January 2013 was worth £179 by 
31 December 2015, compared with growth in the FTSE 100 to £118 
over the same period.
This significant value generated for Shareholders over the last three 
years is therefore reflected in the value of the LTIP vesting. Around  
two-thirds of the value of the CEO’s LTIP vesting is due to share price 
growth, as illustrated in the chart below:

1. As the share price on the date of vesting is unknown at the time of reporting, the value is estimated using the average market value over the last quarter of 2015 of £62.19. The actual value 
at vesting will be disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report. 
2. The share option award made to Adrian Hennah in February 2013 included 704 options awarded under a HMRC approved option scheme. As set out in last year’s Annual Report, following 
the demerger of Indivior PLC exercise prices of outstanding share option awards were adjusted. The exception to this was the HMRC approved options, for which the exercise price remained 
unchanged.
3. The vesting percentage shown is the total vesting percentage of an award. Under the vesting schedule of awards, the vesting percentage applies to the combined total amount of an award 
which may be split into HMRC approved and unapproved parts. Where a portion of an award has been granted under the HMRC approved part of the scheme, those shares are counted first 
when assessing the vested number of shares.
4. Compound average annual growth in adjusted EPS was 8.1% p.a over the performance period, when measured on actual currency basis. The Committee therefore determined vesting in line 
with vesting schedule at 80%.
Further details on LTIP vesting
Based on the performance assessment above, combined with the excellent sustained share price growth over the period, the 2013 LTIP awards to 
the CEO and CFO may vest to the following extent on 5 May 2016 for performance over the completed three-year period: RB / Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 72

Executive Directors’ shareholding requirements (Audited)
Our performance linked remuneration package is underpinned by a meaningful share ownership policy, which drives a culture of ownership 
throughout the Company. The shareholding requirements for our Executive Directors are amongst the most onerous in the market and ensure  
a focus on delivery of sustainable creation of value for Shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to acquire significant numbers of shares over eight years and retain these until retirement from the Board. The 
table below shows the shareholding of each Executive Director against their respective shareholding requirement as of 31 December 2015:

Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in 
remuneration for all UK employees who form part of the management team (“Top400”). This group has been chosen as it represents the most 
appropriate comparator group for reward purposes for our UK-based Group Chief Executive.
The analysis excludes part-time employees and is based on a consistent set of employees, i.e. the same individuals appear in the 2014 and  
2015 populations.

Taxable benefits 31% -6% 18% 2%

The difference in the percentage change of the annual bonus for the CEO and other employees is primarily a result of the fact that different targets 
are set for different areas of the business which are subject to different challenges.
The percentage change in taxable benefits for other employees excludes international transfer benefits as this is volatile from year-to-year based on 
each individual’s circumstances. During 2015 a cash payment was made in respect of the Indivior demerger to all participants in the HMRC 
approved share option and sharesave scheme and is included as a taxable benefit for 2015.

In line with the Remuneration Policy approved by Shareholders, in December 2015, Executive Directors were granted the following awards under 
the LTIP, based on a fixed number of shares and share options. These awards do not accrue dividends during the vesting period. Vesting of these 
awards in full requires achievement of stretching performance conditions over the three-year period.

In line with the RB’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy, vesting of the LTIP awards is dependent on the achievement of targets relating to growth  
in EPS over a three-year period. EPS is measured on an adjusted diluted basis, as shown in the Group’s Financial Statements, as this provides an 
independently verifiable measure of performance. However, the Remuneration Committee maintains the discretion to make adjustments to the 
measure if this is considered to be appropriate. Any adjustments will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
There is no retesting. Awards granted in December 2015 will vest on the following schedule, which requires significant compound annual growth in 
EPS in order for the awards to vest, as follows:
EPS CAAG <6% 6% Between 6% and 10% ≥10%
Equivalent to three year EPS growth of <19.1% 19.1% ≥33.1%
Proportion of awards vesting (%) Nil 20% Straight-line vesting between 20% and 100% 100%
Adrian Hennah also received an award of share options under the all employee sharesave scheme. Details are set out on page 77. RB / Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 74

Summary of Shareholder voting at the 2015 AGM
The following table shows the results of the voting on the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report, at the 2015 AGM, and the remuneration policy 
report most recently put to Shareholders, at the 2014 AGM:
Votes for For % Votes against Against % Total Votes withheld
Approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 406,176,557 80% 100,609,327 20% 506,785,884 13,393,177
Approve the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report 435,838,483 83% 90,368,575 17% 526,207,058 1,216,425
The level of support for the Directors’ Remuneration Report increased significantly amongst our Shareholders following consultation with our major 
Shareholders on remuneration decisions and changes subsequently made to the 2014 Remuneration Report. This saw the vote in favour of the 
Remuneration Report increase from 69% at the 2014 AGM to 83% last year.
The Committee continues to have ongoing dialogue with Shareholders with a view to obtaining further Shareholder support for our remuneration 
arrangements. In particular we consulted our major Shareholders, and taking into account feedback provided, are proposing changes to the 
Remuneration Policy, to further align executives with Shareholders.
The Committee believes our remuneration packages are simple, reinforce our remuneration philosophy and drive a strong alignment between 
executives and the interests of our Shareholders. The requirement for Senior Executives to build up significant shareholdings in the Company 
ensures this alignment with Shareholders, which is being further strengthened with the proposed changes to the Policy to require a two year 
holding period on LTIP awards after leaving the Company.
Advisors
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) was appointed by the Remuneration Committee as independent advisor effective from 1 January 2014 following a review of 
the advisors in late 2013. The Committee undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure that Deloitte remains independent of the Company and 
that the advice provided is impartial and objective. Deloitte is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration 
Consultants, details of which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. During 2015, Deloitte provided support to the Committee 
in relation to benchmarking executive remuneration structure and levels, remuneration related matters in respect of the demerger of Indivior PLC 
and the consultation of Shareholders on remuneration matters. Deloitte also provided the Group with financial advisory support, international 
transfer tax compliance, global mobility services, ad-hoc advice on employment/share schemes matters as well as international corporate and 
indirect tax advisory services during 2015. These services are provided under separate engagement terms and the Committee is satisfied that the 
provision of these services did not impair Deloitte’s ability to advise the Committee independently. Their total fees for the provision of remuneration 
services to the Committee in 2015 were £140,950 on the basis of time and materials.
Implementation of Executive Director remuneration policy for 2016 
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed taking into account the salary increases for the wider workforce, as well as competitive practice for similar roles in the 
Company’s remuneration peer group, comprising 19 international companies, and individual performance. Following its review of salary levels in 
late 2015, the Committee approved the following base salary increases with effect from 1 January 2016:
Executive Director
Base salary at  
1 January 2015
Base salary from  
1 January 2016
Percentage 
increase
Rakesh Kapoor £890,950 £917,679 3%
Adrian Hennah £577,830 £595,165 3%
The base salary increases for Executive Directors take into account performance and follows the same base salary merit increase guidelines as other 
UK employees. The average salary increase was c.3%, effective 1 January 2016.
Pension
The CEO and CFO are eligible to receive pension contributions, or equivalent cash allowances, of 30% and 25% of pensionable salary, respectively.
Annual bonus in respect of 2016 performance
For 2016, there will be no changes to the annual bonus opportunities for Executive Directors. Bonuses will continue to be based on RB’s Net 
Revenue growth and Adjusted Net Income growth, measured in GBP at a constant exchange rate, with the outcome under each of the measures 
combined multiplicatively to give a maximum bonus outcome of 3.57x the target bonus opportunity if both stretch targets are met.
We have not disclosed the performance targets for 2016 as we consider them to be commercially sensitive. However, we commit to retrospectively 
disclosing the performance ranges in the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ending December 2016.
LTIP
LTIP awards for FY 2016 were granted in December 2015. Details of these awards, including the stretching performance conditions that must be 
met, are detailed in full on page 73. Awards to be made in December 2016 will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration in next year’s 
Remuneration Report.

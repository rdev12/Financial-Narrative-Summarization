Despite difﬁcult trading conditions, the Group delivered a resilient performance during 2002
and again substantially reduced debt. 
We expect 2003 to be another challenging year with manufacturing recession and political
uncertainty continuing. 
Nevertheless, Senior is operationally in much better condition to deal with this period of
uncertainty and the lower debt level allows the Group to look forward to the future with
renewed conﬁdence.

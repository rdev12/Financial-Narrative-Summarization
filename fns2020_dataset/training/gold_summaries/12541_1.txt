 Premier Research has continued on a positive 
trend throughout the year ending 31 January 2006.  
I am delighted to report 12 months of sustained 
organic growth complemented by three highly 
strategic acquisitions.  
Operational Review
As a leading international
pharmaceutical services group,
our focus has been on sustainable
growth and improving our ability
to win and deliver higher value,
multi-national projects. This 
year has seen us deliver further
on these goals with turnover
increasing by over 75% and
continued strong demand for 
our services from new and 
existing international customers
underlined by an increased
emphasis on larger value contracts.
After a period of sustained organic
growth in 2004, 2005 saw Premier
Research return its focus to the
acquisition trail with three deals
being completed during the year.
The funding was provided by means
of two vendor share placings with
institutions, together with increased
banking facilities. The successful
completion of these transactions
illustrates investors’ support of 
the management’s growth strategy
for the business and our focus 
on providing long-term value 
for shareholders.
Post year end, Premier Research
successfully raised a further £6m
gross through a placing to both 
new and existing investors. This will
be used to fund all outstanding
deferred cash consideration from
recent acquisitions, additional
working capital and, in whole or in
part, further acquisitions. Coincident
with this, the Group consolidated its
banking facilities.
Post Acquisition Integration
The integrations of EPA EuroPharma
and IMFORM into our International
(i.e. non-US) infrastructure and 
of PharmData into our US
infrastructure have largely been
completed. Cost savings that were
identified during the acquisition
processes have been realised and
will continue to enhance our current
year earnings. I am delighted to
confirm that we have maintained
our track record of not losing any
customer from an acquired
company or, indeed, through our
core business. Moreover, since the
acquisitions have been completed,
we have been awarded repeat
business from a number of legacy
customers and we have continued
to be successful in attracting new
customers to the enlarged Group
with the winning of several new
significant contracts on both sides
of the Atlantic.

Chief Executive’s Review  
Dr Simon Yaxley
EP A EuroPharma
Acquired June 2005.
EP A EuroPharma provides a
broad range of outsourced
clinical services to the
biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries.
The acquisition has provided
Premier Research with a solid
base from which to capitalise
on market opportunities in
Germany, Europe’s second
largest outsourcing market.
The acquisition of EP A
EuroPharma also allowed the
Group to achieve improved
operating margins through
regionalised monitoring of
investigator sites, high value
regulatory affairs and statistical
services plus the integration 
of central overheads.
PharmData
Acquired July 2005.
PharmData specialises in 
clinical data management,
statistical analysis, medical
writing, electronic archiving 
and project management
services. Operating solely 
within the US market,
PharmData provided Premier
Research principally with
increased scope and scale of
data management services.
Due to the specialist nature of
its service offering, PharmData
achieves a higher operating
margin than Premier Research’s
existing data management
operations.The customer base,
which is comprised largely of
US based pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, is
entirely complementary to 
that of Premier Research.
This provides considerable
scope for cross-selling
opportunities, particularly
offering clinical services to
PharmData’s customers who
have, to date, secured these 
services elsewhere.
IMFORM
Acquired December 2005
IMFORM, based in Darmstadt
Germany with offices across
Eastern Europe, specialises in
providing outsourced clinical
services, including; project
management, clinical
monitoring, clinical data
management, medical writing
and quality assurance to the
bio/pharma market with
expertise, experience and
technology necessary to
develop drugs from Phase I 
to Phase IV. IMFORM again has
a complementary customer
base with 20 customers, 19 of
whom are new  to Premier
Research. IMFORM provides a
strategic footprint for Premier
Research to access doctors and
patients within the important
Eastern European CRO Market.
Details of the three acquisitions completed during the year are shown below Strengthened Management
As highlighted at the time of our
interim results, the International and
US operational management teams
were strengthened to facilitate the
integration of the acquisitions.
Furthermore, a small number of
management positions with global
responsibility have been created
(information technology, quality
assurance, finance and proposals/
contracts) to drive the integration and
to accelerate the migration of best
practice between business units.The
Group now has a robust structure
capable of handling the increasing
operational requirements associated
with Premier Research’s projected
growth and development in the 
global marketplace.
Our sales teams have also been
strengthened to retain a balanced
focus across the US and International
territories and to continue to drive 
organic growth.
Service Offering & Sales
Demand for our services remains
strong, stemming from our continued
focus on three of the highest growth
areas in drug development (oncology,
central nervous system and anti-
infectives) together with our
underlying expertise in paediatrics,
a specialised area with strong
regulatory drivers.
With over 325 employees in 31
countries our expertise across
consultancy, clinical study delivery,
data management and final medical
reporting, provides us with an
extremely robust business model 
and a powerful reputation amongst
our peers which, together, have given 
us the infrastructure and kudos to
compete for higher value contracts.
Our broad and blue chip customer base
comprises over 120 customers. Many of
these are major pharmaceutical
organisations, although in any one year
no single contract accounts for more
than 10% of revenues.This continues the
trend of providing us with recurring
business,indicating the excellent service
delivery we provide.
Outsourcing Market
With the improved quality, reliability,
safety, efficiency and controls
associated with outsourcing trials,
the outsourcing market continues to
be buoyant and the requirement for
outsourced clinical research services
continues to grow.
As a management team who closely
monitor the market, we are confident
that this trend will continue for the
foreseeable future and, importantly,
Premier Research’s positioning within
this growing market will allow the
Group to exploit the significant
opportunities which arise.
Current Trading
I am delighted to report that we have
had a good start to the new financial
year and the book-to-bill ratio is still
greater than one. By the end of March
2006, £6.5m of contracts were either
signed or under negotiation, with a
mix between new and existing
customers, and more than £50 million
of outstanding proposals are currently 
with customers. The continued 
growth of the order book and the
realisation of the operational benefits
associated with the integration of the
three recent acquisitions provide
management with added confidence
that the Group is on track to deliver
further growth in the current year.
Summary & Outlook
With an aggressive organic 
growth strategy complemented 
by immediately earnings enhancing
acquisitions, Premier Research has 
the skill base, the flexibility and the
competitive positioning to compete
seriously with the larger CROs.
Strong market conditions together
with excellent visibility on revenues 
for 2006, mean we move into the 
new financial year with continued
confidence.
In closing, I would like to thank all our
staff for their commitment and for
embracing this exciting period of
change, our new employees who
joined us from EPA EuroPharma ,
PharmData and IMFORM and to our
shareholders for their continued
support.

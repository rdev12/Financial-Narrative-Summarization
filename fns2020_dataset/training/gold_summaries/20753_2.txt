Investment Highlights
During 2015, an aggregate of $102 .8 million was invested into new and existing portfolio companies, 
including:
•	 $63 .6 million from two fundraisings led by Allied Minds, with $42 .2 million coming from third-party 
investment, to further accelerate the development of two of the Group’s existing companies, SciFluor 
Life Sciences and Precision Biopsy;
  SciFluor Life Sciences, a drug discovery company developing a portfolio of best-in-class compounds 
through the strategic use of fluorine, raised $30 .0 million at a post money valuation of $130 .7 million, 
up from $37 .1 million . These funds in part are being used to accelerate its two lead compounds, a 
topical treatment for retinal diseases and a treatment for neurological diseases, into the clinic . These 
compounds are expected to result in three Investigational New Drug (IND) applications to the US 
Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 and subsequent commencement of Phase I trials .
  Precision Biopsy, a company developing early intervention technology that detects in real time 
suspicious tissue during prostate biopsy examinations, raised $33 .6 million at a post money valuation 
of $90 .4 million, up from $19 .0 million, to accelerate the commercialisation of its ClariCore™ Biopsy 
System, and develop its Focal Therapy programme . The funds support the continuation of taking 
clinical core samples to optimise the tissue classification system, as well as planned FDA clinical 
trials to support final development and regulatory approvals for the prostate market .
•	 In addition to these two fundraisings, $39 .2 million was invested by the Group into new and other 
existing portfolio companies, including investments in four new businesses: BridgeSat, ABLS I (Yale), 
HawkEye 360 and ABLS II (Harvard) .
•	 Post-period-end, on 29 January 2016, Federated Wireless raised $22 .0 million at a post money valuation 
of $82 .0 million, up from $10 .0 million previously . The raise will enable it to complete its Spectrum 
Access System (SAS) and Environmental Sensor Capability (ESC) certification process, conclude the 
development and accelerate the commercialisation of its cloud-hosted CINQ platform, and conduct field 
trials throughout 2016 and 2017 with technology partners to include Ruckus Wireless, Google, Intel, 
Qualcomm, and Nokia . Allied Minds invested $5 .0 million in this fundraising, and third-party investment 
totaled $17 .0 million .
Operational Highlights
•	 During the year, Allied Minds engaged with over 90 new research institutions, bringing the total US 
universities and federal laboratories in the Allied Minds partner network to 160, from 68 at the end of 
2014 .
•	 The investment team reviewed more than 5,000 new technologies developed by the partner network . 
Following extensive due diligence on over 20 of the most promising, the Group formed and funded four 
new businesses, resulting in a total Group portfolio of 23 subsidiary businesses at December 2015, and 
executed options to license three additional technologies .

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Highlights (continued)
 
•	 The Group currently has 21 technologies in early due diligence, two technologies in final due diligence, 
and a number of opportunities in active negotiations .
•	 During 2015 and post-period, several Allied Minds businesses entered into collaborations with industry 
leaders including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Lockheed Martin, 
Google, Cisco, Ruckus Wireless, Qualcomm, Nokia and others, validating the quality of the companies’ 
platforms, people and technologies .
•	 The accelerating pace of developing new and existing companies during 2015 led to significant expansion 
in the total workforce from approximately 234 to 359 employees and consultants . The workforce 
increase was almost entirely concentrated into the operating subsidiaries, where new hires consisted 
of approximately 61% engineering and technical development professionals, 27% leadership and 
management professionals, and 12% sales, marketing and other business development professionals .
Financial Highlights
•	 Net cash and investments* of $194 .8 million, (2014: $261 .5 million)
* includes funds in form of fixed income securities
•	 Revenues of $3 .3 million, (2014: $7 .7 million) primarily reflecting revenue shortfall compared to prior year 
at RF Biocidics (RFB), which following initial regulatory approval requires certification for each individual 
installation and is extending the sales cycle and delaying revenue .
•	 Net loss of $97 .9 million, (2014: $57 .9 million) primarily reflecting an increase in the overall growth 
of the Group’s investment in research and development activities, reflecting the creation of four new 
businesses in 2015 and ramping up full scale of research and development (R&D) activities of companies 
created in late 2013 and into 2014 .
•	 The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value (GSOAV) of $535 .8 million as of 31 December 2015, 
compared to $488 .0 million at 31 December 2014, was an increase of $47 .8 million, or 9 .8% . The 
increase in 2015 is primarily attributed to the increase in value at Precision Biopsy and Federated 
Wireless demonstrated by the consummation of third-party fundraisings into such subsidiaries, offset by 
decreases in value at RF Biocidics and CryoXtract as a result of slower than anticipated sales growth, 
and the closing of SiEnergy .
•	 Share price performance: 421 .9p share price, the 30-day trailing average as at 31 December 2015, an 
increase of 32 .5% over the 318 .3p share price, the 30-day trailing average as at 31 December 2014 .
Key Subsidiary Highlights
•	 Spin Transfer Technologies (STT), a next-generation computer memory company:
  signed a co-development agreement with a major memory company; and
  successfully developed a fully functional technology demonstrator memory integrated circuit (DM1) 
to generate commercially relevant data for evaluation by potential partners and customers .

progression during ablation .
  published abstracts and posters at leading conferences: Atrial Fibrillation Symposium in Orlando, FL 
and Heart Rhythm Society in Boston, MA .
  expanded IP portfolio with three issued patents and additional filings globally .
•	 RF Biocidics (RFB), a food safety company:
  as reported in our half yearly results, sales of RFB’s state-of-the-art food safety equipment were 
lower than expected due in large part to delayed regulatory approval;
  initial regulatory validation was completed by the Almond Board of California Technical Expert Review 
Panel (TERP), whose decision confirmed third-party test results that showed RFBs’ chemical-free 
process effectively eliminates pathogens like Salmonella from almonds, making them safe to eat; and
  RFB is required to obtain certification at each new installation of its system, delaying roll-out . The 
company is actively working with regulators to streamline the process and at the same time is 
implementing sales and marketing focused initiatives . 
•	 Allied Minds formed four new businesses during the year:
  ABLS, a collaborative and interactive partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb, entered into license 
agreements and initiated feasibility phase testing with:

laboratory of Dr . David Spiegel . The proprietary platform and associated small molecule lead 
compounds known as Antibody-Recruiting Molecules (ARMs) provide a novel approach for the 
treatment of prostate cancer by recruiting the body’s own immune system; and
 n Harvard University (ABLS II) with respect to research and intellectual property developed 
by Professor Malcolm Whitman, and commenced a project to create novel small molecule 
therapeutics for the treatment of fibrotic and autoimmune diseases .
  BridgeSat, which is a collaboration with The Aerospace Corporation and Draper Laboratory, to 
develop an on orbit optical connectivity system that aims to increase the speed, security and 
efficiency of data transmissions from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and high altitude unmanned 
aerial vehicles (UAVs) compared to traditional radio frequency solutions .
  HawkEye 360, a collaboration with Mr . Chris DeMay, (who worked for the US National Reconnaissance 
Office, leading programs for satellite development), Dr . Charles Clancy and Dr . Bob McGwier of 
Virginia Tech’s Hume Center for National Security and Technology, (both of whom developed the 
technology for complex radio frequency (RF) signal processing) . The company seeks to build and 
launch a constellation of small satellites flying in clusters of three satellites each in LEO, capable of 
geo-locating, detecting, and analysing wireless signals to track and monitor global transportation 
networks and comprehensively map spectrum resources .

Our Business
at a Glance
Our vision is to build the largest 
online antibody resource in the 
world while also ensuring that 
the antibodies are of high quality 
and commercially viable.
The idea for Abcam came early 
in  998 out of a laboratory in 
the University of Cambridge, 
UK. The principal founder, 
Jonathan Milner, was working 
as a post-doctoral researcher 
studying the newly discovered 
breast cancer protein BRCA2 in 
Professor Tony Kouzarides’ 
laboratory. The project slowed 
because of problems finding 
quality antibody reagents that 
had honest and up-to-date 
information about their uses 
and limitations. It was frustrating.
How we 
work
1 We source and develop
We make our own antibodies 
and source other excellent 
antibodies from institutes, 
academic laboratories and 
primary manufacturers.
Abcam now has an online 
catalogue of more than 44,000 
antibodies and related products 
(such as proteins, peptides and 
kits). An increasing number of 
products are produced in-
house at our new high 
throughput production facility in 
Cambridge, UK and the 
percentage of total sales 
represented by such products 
is expected to grow as the 
facility comes fully on stream. 
Other products are supplied by  
more than 250 leading OEM 
partners and sold under the 
Abcam Brand.
2 We add value
Our scientists have built a 
catalogue of the best antibodies 
in the world and provide technical 
support on all of our products to 
enable our customers to achieve 
the result they expect.
The unique relationship Abcam 
has with the scientists who use 
our products means that we can 
obtain a wide range of testing 
data from their feedback and 
enquiries. We publish this 
information in the form of 
Abreviews
SM
 , which report the 
purchasing decisions of 
researchers looking for 
reagents. Taken across the 
catalogue average sales per 
product continue to increase the 
longer they have been on our 
catalogue, a trend we attribute 
in part to the sheer quantity of 
information that we are able to 
gather and publish over time.
Following an in-depth study of 
the market, Abcam has chosen 
8 Core Focus Areas (CFAs), 
each of which represents a 
research area with high market 
demand. We have vertically 
integrated our business 
development, manufacturing, 
marketing sales and technical 
support teams around these 
areas and expect to add a 
further two CFAs by June 2009.
3 We deliver
Our systems enable us to 
process orders quickly and 
accurately and we ship across 
the globe using our fully 
automated web-enabled stock-
management system. Our size 
means that we can invest in 
state-of-the art storage and 
handling facilities, which have 
enabled us to speed up shipping 
times and increase our output. 
We are able to operate at high-
levels of efficiency and with low 
handling costs.
Abcam plc is a producer and distributor of 
research-grade antibodies and associated 
products.
Where we operate
Abcam is headquartered in Cambridge, UK and continues to 
benefit from close links to the University of Cambridge, from which 
a large number of our PhD recruits are drawn.
Our US office has made a substantial, increasing contribution  
to sales since it was opened four years ago, serving our largest 
single market.
We opened an office in Tokyo, Japan in December 2006 and this 
has enabled us to radically improve the quality of the service we 
provide to customers in the form of technical support and speed  
of delivery.
We are also continuing to build our distributor network in order to 
improve our geographic reach in parts of the world where an  
e-commerce model has yet to be fully embraced.  Abcam plc

Customers can directly access 
the website to find the status of 
their orders so they can plan 
their experiments more 
effectively.
4 We support
Our products come with an 
Abpromise
SM
, giving customers 
the reassurance of knowing 
that:
 Our antibodies are of the 
highest quality and are 
backed up by an expert 
technical team, who are  
able to assist in initial  
product selection;
•
 Customers can, at  
any time, contact other  
customers using  
the same antibody  
via our unique  
Abreviews
SM
 system;
 If, after optimisation, any 
product does not perform as 
described on the datasheet, 
customers can contact our 
expert team to ask for advice 
assistance; and
 In the unlikely event that a 
product is faulty, we will 
replace or provide a full 
refund if reported within  
 20 days of purchase.

Our 
products
Abcam has over 44,000 
products in its catalogue and 
the number is still growing.
Our team not only adds new 
products to our catalogue every 
day but also regularly modifies 
the datasheets for our existing 
products. These modifications 
are based on our own testing 
and research in addition to the 
feedback of our suppliers and 
customers.
 For our customers, this means:
more antibody targets
more product types
more choice
•
•
•
Products sold by Abcam but 
not manufactured on our 
premises are supplied by more 
than 250 leading OEM partners 
around the world.
As it comes fully on stream,  
our new production facility will 
enable us to devote substantially 
more resources to in-house 
product development. In 
particular, this year has seen  
an increase in the levels of 
quality of characterisation 
which we can now provide  
with all our products. This  
is a key driver of growth.
Our people
Strength through brilliant people
We take enormous pride in the calibre of our employees. Since its 
launch in  998, Abcam has had tremendous success in attracting 
highly skilled people to its business and now boasts an impressive

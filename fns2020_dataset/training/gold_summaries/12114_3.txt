Chairman’s Statement
Peter Bertram
“I am pleased to report that 
Phoenix IT Group plc has had a 
successful year with all three 
divisions delivering organic 
growth in both revenue and 
underlying profit from 
operations.” 
Review of the Year
I am pleased to report that Phoenix IT Group plc has had a successful 
year with all three divisions delivering organic growth in both revenue 
and underlying profit
(1)
 from operations, and the Group continues to 
be cash generative. We have completed the integration of ICM and 
Servo into a single end-user business and following the investments 
made during the year in increasing hosting capacity and capability 
we are well positioned to take advantage of the market shift towards 
“Cloud” computing in both of our end-user and Partner Services 
divisions. The breadth of services that we can offer via the merged 
end-user division leads us to anticipate further growth in managed 
hosting and “Cloud” services into the current Financial Year. Whilst 
growth predictions are more cautious in respect of the Partner Services 
division, the Group has a diverse customer base and retains good 
visibility of forward revenues giving a strong platform on which to 
build for the future.
A review of the year’s trading and results is given in the Business 
Review.
Results
Group revenues increased as expected by 10.5% to £271.6m (2010: 
£245.8m) and profit before tax increased by 0.7% to £25.3m (2010: 
£25.2m). Underlying
(2)
 profit before tax increased by 8.7% to £32.0m 
(2010: £29.5m). Diluted earnings per share decreased by 1.6% to 24.2p 
(2010: 24.6p) and underlying
(2)
 diluted earnings per share increased 
by 5.5% to 30.6p (2010: 29.0p). The Group continues to be highly cash 
generative and despite the increase in capital investment during the 
year net debt (including finance leases) reduced by £5.5m to £62.4m 
(2010: £67.9m).
Dividend
As announced in November 2010 in the Interim Results, after careful 
consideration the Board has decided to rebase the Group’s dividends 
in light of its continued strong cash generation and the greater 
flexibility afforded by the recent refinancing of its borrowing facilities.  
The Group has investment opportunities, both organic and acquisitive, 
within its chosen growing markets and the Board believes these can 
be comfortably afforded within a higher dividend pay-out ratio.  The 
Board’s objective will be to at least maintain the rebased level of 
dividends in real terms within a pay-out ratio of between about 35 and 
45% of profit, subject to unusual events or circumstances. The Board 
recommends a proposed final dividend of 7.00p per share (2010: 4.30p) 
which, combined with the interim dividend of 3.50p per share, gives a 
total dividend per share for the year of 10.50p (2010: 6.45p), an increase 
of 62.8%. If approved, the final dividend will be paid on 3 August 2011 
to shareholders on the register at 17 June 2011. 
Board
As previously announced, Steve Clutton was appointed as Group 
Finance Director on 1 March 2011. Steve was most recently Group 
Finance Director of IG Group Holdings plc between 2006 and 2010. He 
brings extensive financial and commercial experience from operating 
within a range of companies having previously held senior finance 
roles within Barclays Bank, Interoute Telecommunications Limited and 
British Telecom.
 
Employees
On behalf of the Board and the Shareholders I would like to thank all 
our staff for their commitment and hard work during the year.
Annual General Meeting

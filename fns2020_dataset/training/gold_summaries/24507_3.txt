Chairman’s Statement
It has been a year of change 
for the management team: Jill 
McDonald joined as CEO in May 
2015 and Jonny Mason as CFO 
a few months later. Both have 
settled in quickly and have made 
a strong impact. The change of 
management provided us an 
opportunity to step back and take 
another detailed look at the Group 
and its strategic plans. This re-
affirmed our previously held view 
that Halfords is a fundamentally 
strong business operating in 
good, growing markets. It also 
identified that the turnaround 
the business had gone through 
in the last three years under the 
Getting into Gear strategy was 
impressive; colleagues are much 
more engaged and customers 
have noticed and benefitted 
from the changes. However, it 
also identified that the job to 
modernise Halfords was not 
yet done and that we needed

to continue to invest to enable 
sustainable long-term growth. As 
a consequence, the new Moving 
Up A Gear strategy was launched 
in November 2015.
These plans are fully laid out in 
the Annual Report, along with 
explanations of the  progress 
already made.
Performance
Following two years of strong 
sales growth in Retail, this was 
always going to be a challenging 
year, particularly for our cycling 
business. The weather wasn’t 
helpful either, but I’m pleased to 
report that  financial performance 
was solid for Retail, with robust 
sales growth from the motoring 
side of the business and a sound 
performance for Autocentres was 
achieved as it executed on its 
plans. As a result, we generated 
growth in underlying earnings 
per share. Confidence in the 
Group’s future prospects and the 
cash generative nature of the 
business has enabled the Board 
to recommend a full year dividend 
of 17.0p, an increase of 3.0%.
Our colleagues have been 
resilient and committed 
throughout, working hard to drive 
sales and implement the strategic 
priorities. I was particularly 
pleased that Halfords was again 
awarded a place in the list of 
T op 25 Best Companies T o Work 
For as well as winning awards 
for community partnerships 
and developing colleagues. 
Well trained, highly engaged 
and happy colleagues will lead, 
in turn, to satisfied, supportive 
customers.

Outlook
This is an exciting time to be 
part of Halfords. We have a clear 
strategic plan aimed at driving 
sustainable long-term growth 
delivered by engaged and 
talented colleagues. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank 
all of our 11,000 colleagues for 
their hard work and commitment, 
and also their enthusiasm in 
embracing the new strategy. 
I would also like to extend a 
warm welcome to the Tredz 
and Wheelies businesses and 
colleagues. We look forward to 
the year ahead.

Performance Overview
For comparability purposes all of the review 
discussion below is on a 52 week to 52 
week basis.
In the 52 week financial year box office revenue 
increased 4.1% to £235.8m (2009: £226.5m), 
representing a box office market share in the 
UK and Ireland of 24.6% (2009: 23.9%). The 
Group’s admissions were 1.0m, 2.1% lower 
than the prior year. Average ticket price per 
admission increased by 5.9% to £4.99 (2009: 
£4.71). Retail spend per person increased by 
1p to £1.73 (2009: £1.72).
Cineworld’s success in 2010 was underpinned 
by a strong film line up with an increased 
number of 3D films (25 films compared with 
13 in 2009). Average ticket prices were higher 
because of modest general price increases 
and the benefit of the price uplift from 3D 
admissions. Almost 28.0% of market box 
office was from 3D for the full year, up from 
approximately 12.0% in 2009.
By the end of 2010, Cineworld had become the 
number one cinema operator in the UK for the 
period in terms of UK box office (Rentrak/EDI) 
with a market share of 26.2%.
Box Office
A combination of modest price increases, 
the premium on 3D performances and stable 
admissions in the year enabled Cineworld’s 
box office to increase 4.1% to £235.8m. 
Average ticket price per admission increased 
5.9% to £4.99 (2009: £4.71). The increase 
was partly aided by the premium pricing on 
3D performances. The average ticket price 
excluding VAT of 3D is in excess of £6.10 
compared to 2D of almost £4.50. Cineworld 
nevertheless continues to offer its customers 
compelling value with the lowest average ticket 
price of any of the major UK cinema groups.
There were strong performances in the year 
from a number of core blockbusters which 
included “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 
Part 1”, “Inception”, “Sex and the City 2”, 
“The Twilight Saga: Eclipse” and “Iron Man 
2”. All these films performed above or in line 
with industry expectations. The year also saw 
the continued rise of 3D films with 25 films 
released in 3D, the most notable being “Toy 
Story 3” (the highest grossing film of the year 
and the second highest grossing film of all 
time in the UK), “Alice in Wonderland”, “Shrek 
Forever After”, and “Clash of the Titans”.
In line with our stated strategy, we continued 
to offer customers the broadest range of 
films on the market. There were a number of 
smaller and mid range films which performed 
well during the year including “Streetdance 
3D”, “The Prince of Persia: The Sands of 
Time”, “Kick Ass” and “The Tourist” where we 
achieved higher individual market shares than 
our overall market average. We also remained 
the biggest exhibitor of Bollywood films in the 
UK with a market share in excess of 50%. We 
remained the only major chain to screen
Tamil language films such as “Endhiran: The 
Robot”, where we had an 87% market share. 
In addition, we showcased a series of other 
successful foreign language films such as 
the trilogy of films “The Girl with the Dragon 
Tattoo”, “The Girl Who Played with Fire” and 
“The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest” which 
contributed favourably to our full year results.
We continued to make good progress during 
the year in developing our alternative content 
offering which has been made possible by 
our digital conversion. The notable events 
of the year included the 25th Anniversary 
shows of Les Miserables from The O2, the 
Big 4 Live (from Sofia) and Bon Jovi and Green 
Day concerts. Furthermore the successful 
broadcast of two live sporting events in 3D, 
namely the Six Nations Rugby and the latter 
stages of the football World Cup showed the 
possibility of screening such live events and 
proved that it was technically and logistically 
possible to exhibit such events from around 
the world. In the field of the performing arts, 
we screened a series of live shows from the 
New York Metropolitan Opera, the National 
Theatre and Glyndebourne, all of which were 
well attended. Alternative content is growing, 
but is currently still a niche offer and therefore 
a small contributor to revenues compared 
with film.
Retail
It is pleasing to report that net retail spend 
per person held firm in 2010 at £1.73 (2009: 
£1.72). This is a reflection of the competitive 
offers and strength of our promotions. 
Cineworld’s success in 2010 was 
underpinned by a strong film line-up 
with an increased number of 3D films. 09
Cineworld Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
As expected, our customers have become more 
value conscious given the tough economic 
backdrop, and we responded with a number of 
value initiatives which have been successful.
We also continued to invest in new equipment 
such as the roll out of new hot dog machines, 
enabling faster service and reduced wastage, 
and expanded the number of coffee machines 
to meet growing demand. The retail stand at 
Wandsworth was redesigned towards the end 
of the year, as part of a new design concept 
trialed at the cinema.
As previously reported, we renewed long-term 
arrangements with Coca Cola in the first 
quarter and the continuation of our partnership 
with this recognised brand has helped us to 
maintain the value of our overall drinks offer.
Advertising
Trading at Digital Cinema Media Limited 
(“DCM”), our joint venture screen advertising 
business formed in July 2008, improved 
markedly with screen advertising revenues 
rising almost 21% against the previous period. 
DCM’s primary function is to sell advertising 
time on cinema screens on behalf of Cineworld 
and its other clients. It also engages in 
related promotional work between advertisers 
and cinemas. The increase in revenues 
generated for Cineworld against the previous 
period largely reflected the improvements in 
confidence amongst advertisers in general 
which helped to increase overall levels of 
demand. The management team at DCM 
has been driving operational efficiencies and 
effectiveness so that the business is well 
positioned to capitalise on the increased 
flexibility offered to advertisers via the digital 
format as well as on any improvements in the 
overall advertising market.
A major success for DCM was winning  
the account to provide screen advertising 
to the Vue Cinema circuit with effect from 
1 January 2011.
Since the year end Martin Bowley, Managing 
Director of DCM has resigned and a 
replacement is being sought.
Investment in Digital
At the end of December 2010, Cineworld 
had one of the largest digital estates of any 
cinema operator in the UK. Digital projection 
is an important part of our strategy which 
enables the screening of films (2D and 3D) and 
other content using digital media. During the 
first quarter of 2010 we installed 102 digital 
projectors and, by the end of January 2011, we 
had completed the installation of a further 150 
digital projectors, thereby resulting in over 50% 
of our estate having digital projectors.
On 14 June 2010, we announced our 
agreement with Arts Alliance Media (“AAM”) 
to roll out digital projection facilities across 
the remainder of our cinema estate. The deal 
will transform Cineworld and will enable us to 
convert our estate to fully digital within three 
years. The roll out will cost in the region of 
£25m, in addition to the c£15m already spent 
to date.
Under the AAM deal, Cineworld acquires the 
digital projectors directly from a third party 
and retains full control over the timing of 
their purchase and over their installation and 
operation. Cineworld benefits from AAM’s 
systems, technical capabilities and utilising 
AAM’s Virtual Print Fee (“VPF”) agreements 
with film distributors and exhibitors. The VPF 
deal covers a ten year period during which 
AAM collect VPFs from film studios on behalf 
of Cineworld the first time a film is played in 
digital on a screen rather than in 35mm. VPFs 
are, for up to ten years, discounted from the 
cost Cineworld pays for film rental and reflects 
the cost savings to the studios of the move to 
digital. These discounts are expected to refund 
a substantial proportion of the total conversion 
cost of c£40m over a 7–10 year period before 
taking into account the associated benefits of 
3D and digital.
Unlimited Card Programme
Our unique subscription service, Unlimited, 
offers a competitive value proposition to our 
customers. The service offers customers the 
opportunity to pay a fixed monthly (or annual) 
subscription which enables them to watch 
as many 2D films at our cinemas as they 
wish. Cineworld prides itself on being the only 
cinema operator in the UK and Ireland to offer 
this service which increased its membership 
Our alternative content 
offering included the 25th 
Anniversary shows of Les 
Miserables from The O2, 
the Big 4 Live (from Sofia) 
and Bon Jovi and Green 
Day concerts.

further during the year. The service is one 
of the pillars which underpin our strategy of 
growing other revenues and admissions. It 
brings to the Group the financial benefits of 
regular subscription income reducing the level 
of fluctuation in our revenues. It also brings 
operational benefits by encouraging repeat 
visits, often at off-peak times. This, in turn, 
enables us to improve capacity utilisation at 
our cinemas, provide more retail opportunities 
and introduce a wider range of films than our 
competitors. As a result, we continued to enjoy 
significant market share among the smaller, 
less mainstream films in 2010.
Initiatives and Developments
Activity on our consumer website increased 
in the year, recording almost 54m visits 
which put it comfortably in the top 50 most 
visited websites in the UK (as reported in the 
IMRG Experian Hitwise Hit Shops List). The 
“My Cineworld” membership on the website 
continued its expansion with a total database 
of over 500,000 members. The growth of this 
portal is an important part of our strategy to 
engage further with our customers and, in turn, 
should enable us to improve our customer 
retention and to encourage more frequent 
visits to our cinemas. We extended our mobile 
enabled web booking service by being the first 
UK cinema chain in 2010 to launch an app for 
the iPhone.
Our corporate website was upgraded and 
relaunched in May 2010 as part of our plan 
to introduce electronic communications with 
our shareholders which went live towards the 
end of the year thereby helping to reduce our 
environmental impact.
Our partnership with Tesco through its Clubcard 
programme continued to flourish, aided by its TV 
advertising to promote the ticket offer, helping to 
raise Cineworld’s brand profile nationally.
In addition, we have started to focus on 
improving utilisation of cinemas at off peak 
times particularly through the hire of individual 
auditoriums. We continue to make progress 
in offering our cinemas as venues for other 
purposes from corporate conferences and 
private film hires, through to educational 
meetings and religious gatherings on 
Sunday mornings.
Our People
Attracting, developing and retaining talented 
staff is important for our business. It is vital for 
our continued success that we encourage our 
employees’ personal development and career 
progression. A new performance management 
process was successfully trialled in 2010 
and was rolled out to the organisation at the 
start of 2011. It involved all senior and line 
managers with the aim of providing meaningful 
employees’ objective setting and structured 
performance reviews. By using this framework 
we aim to increase further the high proportion 
of cinema management and supervisory 
positions which are held by internally promoted 
employees, thereby bringing operational 
and financial benefits to the Group. The new 
recruitment website, launched in early 2010, 
has produced positive feedback from cinema 
management. The website has proven to be a 
useful tool for improving the efficiency of the 
candidate selection process and ultimately 
improved staff retention.
Expansion
We continue to look for opportunities to expand 
our estate. On 25 June we acquired the trade 
and assets of the multiplex cinema at The O2 
in London and agreed a 25 year lease with 
the Waterfront Limited Partnership, part of 
the Anschutz Entertainment Group (“AEG”), to 
operate it. The O2 is the world’s most popular 
music venue by ticket sales (Source: Pollstar 
listed ticket sales) and the cinema is an 11 
screen multiplex seating a total of 2,844 
people with gross box office revenues of £4.1 
million in 2009 (source: Rentrak/EDI). On 24 
May we announced an agreement for a 25 
year lease for a new nine screen cinema at the 
Wembley City retail and leisure development 
which will seat 1,800 people in total and which 
is scheduled to open in 2013.
In respect of 2011, we have plans to open 
a seven screen cinema in Leigh towards the 
end of the year and will commence fit out of a 
seven screen cinema in Aldershot (planned for 
opening in the first quarter of 2012). Whilst the 
uncertainty over development financing and 
timing of new projects continues, we have seen 
a rise in confidence in the property market 
during the year with renewed interest in existing 
proposals as well as new plans and ideas being 
tabled. Expansion remains a key strategic 
priority for the Group over the medium term

Alternative 
content and 
conferencing
With some unique features to 
offer the corporate market, 
the Cineworld cinema in 
The O2 has already started 
building its reputation as 
a specialist conference 
venue as well as a cinema. 
According to Marketing 
Manager, Alice Serras, its 
11 digital state-of-the-art 
screens, including the Sky 
Superscreen -the largest 
in Europe – combined with 
Cineworld’s customer service 
credentials have helped it 
start to compete successfully 
in this highly competitive 
market. Events to date have 
included regional conferences 
from businesses based in 
Canary Wharf and hosting 
premieres for major theatrical 
releases.

and we are ensuring that we have the financial 
capability, through a new increased bank 
facility, to pursue such opportunities. We are 
working with well known retail names on new 
developments as well as reviewing potential 
acquisition opportunities.
At 30 December 2010, the Group had increased 
its estate to 78 cinemas with 801 screens.
Key t rends and f actors Potentially Affecting 
the f uture
The future success of the Group in 2011 will 
remain principally dependent on the strength 
of the film releases during the year. Sequels 
and franchises will continue to contribute 
a significant number of the higher profile 
blockbuster films. Many such films outperform 
the original film or concept, so the film studios 
will continue to look to capitalise on proven 
successful formulae. The overall film release 
programme for 2011 is known and there is a 
strong line up of potential blockbusters.
The major product for the cinema industry will 
remain 2D films, though 3D films and other 
content will continue to gain popularity as 
more content is provided digitally. Our plans 
for digital mirror these trends and include 
converting our entire estate to digital which 
will provide greater flexibility in screening 
arrangements.
The successful live 
screening of certain high 
profile rugby and football 
events in 3D in 2010 has 
given us confidence to 
widen our horizons. Cineworld O2 
Cineworld’s 
premier site
Located in the prestigious 
O2 arena, the newly acquired 
Cineworld O2 cinema is now a 
Cineworld flagship venue. The 
General Manager has focused 
on staff training and recruited 
a new management team to 
bring customer services up to 
Cineworld’s exacting standards 
and meet the high level of 
customer’s expectation from 
such an impressive venue. 
Today the Cineworld sparkle 
is evident. Staff are proud of 
their venue and the “mystery 
shopper” scores were some 
of the highest in the Group in 
December 2010. Admissions 
have been growing and in 
February 2011 it successfully 
hosted the opening event of 
Justin Bieber’s first Motion 
Picture – “Never Say Never”.

beyond traditional art-based content such 
as plays, opera and concerts. The source of 
alternative content is currently fragmented. 
Stabilisation and consolidation amongst 
suppliers should increase the range of content, 
improve the operational delivery and result in 
financial savings. Revenues from alternative 
content are anticipated to grow further, albeit 
from a small base.
We have seen increased demand from 
advertisers which have benefited our screen 
advertising revenues in 2010 and anticipate that 
demand in the advertising industry in general will 
continue to hold up, supported by the greater 
flexibility offered by our conversion to digital.
In 2010 there were 25 3D films released. In 
2011 there are over 30 3D films scheduled for 
release and studios are reportedly planning to 
convert some older film titles to 3D as well.
Customers have been prepared to pay higher 
ticket prices to see 3D films, even though 
certain sections of the customer base prefer 
to see 2D for cost reasons. Higher prices for 
3D films are expected to continue and with 
an increasing number of 3D films planned for 
release, should support further revenue growth.
Within the area of alternative content, the 
successful live screening of certain high profile 
rugby and football events in 3D in 2010 has 
given us confidence to widen our horizons 
The major element of  
other revenue is screen 
advertising revenue which 
reported strong growth  
of almost 21.0%, a reflection 
of the recovery in 
advertising demand.

We aim to deliver the best 
experience to O2 from 
fresh popcorn to state- 
of-the-art 3D screens.
As reported last year, we continued to enjoy 
strong mid week business, particularly in 
conjunction with “Bargain Tuesdays” and 
“Orange Wednesdays” promotions which 
demonstrates that customers are seeking 
greater value in the current economic climate.
Plans for new cinemas will remain less certain 
until finance for developers becomes more 
readily available. Nevertheless we remain 
committed to expanding our business – 
through the development of complementary 
activities, opening more cinemas and through 
the acquisition of other cinema portfolios, 
facilitated by our strong financial position.
Cineworld will continue to offer a highly 
compelling choice within the wider range of 
entertainment and leisure activities. We believe 
going to the cinema remains one of the best 
value forms of popular entertainment and 
will continue to attract audiences who seek 
quality film product and the immersive viewing 
experience that remains unmatched by any 
other media.
Revenues
Total revenue for 2010 was £342.8m a rise 
of 4.8% on the prior period (2009: £327.1m) 
or a 2.8% rise on a reported 53 week basis 
for 2009.
As a result of strong film product, we enjoyed 
excellent trading during the period. Box office 
revenue was 4.1% higher at £235.8m (2009: 
£226.5m) though admissions were 2.1% lower. 
Compared to the reported 53 week basis for 
2009, box office revenue was 2.1% higher than 
2009 on 3.9% less admissions.
Retail sales for the year were 1.4% lower at

the reported 53 week basis. The fall in retail 
sales was due to reduced admissions given 
that the sales per person held firm at £1.73 
(2009: £1.72), a satisfactory outcome given 
the challenging consumer environment.
Other revenues increased by 42.7% to £25.4m 
(2009: £17.8m). Compared to the 53 week 
reported basis for 2009 the increase was 
40.3%. The major element of other revenue 
is screen advertising revenue which reported 
strong growth of almost 21.0%, a reflection 
of the recovery in advertising demand. Other 
revenues from non screen advertising such 
as ticket bookings, theatre hires and sales 
of 3D glasses were up 75.4% mainly due to 
the change to selling 3D glasses separately 
towards the end of 2009.
EBIt DA and Operating Profit
EBITDA was up 8.1% at £59.0m against the 
2009 figure of £54.6m (5.9% higher than the 
reported 53 week basis for 2009) and was 
achieved through better customer spend levels 
and cost margins and continued management 
of operating costs. The estimated contribution 
to EBITDA from the additional week in 2009 
is approximately £1.1m and approximately 
£0.6m to operating profit. Operating profit 
at £37.1m was lower than 2009 of £38.9m 
(reported 2009: £39.6m) due to property 
related provisions and net impairments of 
£0.8m and £3.2m respectively. A provision 
of £0.8m was made during the year to cover 
potential increases in dilapidations for two 
non-trading properties, where the Group 
believed it probable that it will exit the leases, 
and this was charged to administrative 
expenses. In addition, the Group made a 
net impairment charge of £3.2m. £4.5m of 
assets was impaired at sites where the Group 
considered that the carrying values of their 
assets exceeded the present values of the 
future expected cash flows generated at those 
sites and there were also impairment reversals 
of £1.3m of assets that had been impaired in 
the past. These assets related to sites where 
the conditions supporting the improvements 
in trading were considered sustainable in 
the future.
Earnings
Overall profit on ordinary activities before tax 
was £30.4m compared with £30.3m in 2009. 
Basic earnings per share amounted to 14.8p 
and adjusted pro-forma diluted earnings per 
share were 18.1p (using a normalised tax rate 
of 28.0%). This compares favourably with the 
2009 adjusted pro-forma earnings per share of 
16.2p. The weighted average number of shares 
during 2010 was 141.7m including 20,088 
shares issued during the year.
f inance Costs
The falls in interest rates in 2009 continued 
to benefit the Group in 2010, aided by the 
reduction in net debt. The interest expense in 
the year relates primarily to interest on bank 
debt. The majority of the remaining interest 
charge is non-cash interest on onerous leases, 
the pension scheme and the finance lease.
taxation
The overall tax charge was £9.4m giving an 
overall effective tax rate of 30.9% for the year 
(2009: 33.8%). The corporation tax charge 
consisted of the charge in respect of the current 
year of £8.3m and a credit of £0.6m relating 
to prior years. The balance of the tax charge of 
£1.7m principally resulted from the utilisation 
of a deferred tax asset relating to capital 
allowances (the difference between the tax 
written down value of the capital allowance and 
the net book value of the underlying assets).
Cash f low and Balance sheet
The Group continued to be strongly cash 
generative at the operating level. Total cash 
generated from operations was lower than for 
2009 (£50.7m compared to £54.6m in 2009) 
primarily due to the significantly lower trading 
levels in the weather affected December 2010 
compared with 2009 and meant much lower 
creditor levels at the end of 2010 compared 
with 2009. The recovery in trading since the 
end of the year has helped to reverse the short-
term outflow of operating cash in December 
and it will improve further in line with continued 
strong trade.
Net cash spent on capital for the year was 
£20.3m. Included in this cash expenditure was 
£9.4m in relation to the purchase of digital 
projectors (the balance of the cost of £10.5m 
was paid after the year end) and £4.2m for new 
sites including expenses for the acquisition 
of the cinema at The O2. The balance of 
other capital expenditure of £6.7m was for

equipment replacement, site refurbishments 
and expenditure on various initiatives such 
as website enhancements and upgrading of 
automated ticket sales points. The high level of 
internally generated cash has funded our entire 
capital expenditure whilst repaying term debt of 
£9m and paying dividends of £14.5m.
Net debt at the end of December 2010 fell to 
£100.8m (2009: £104.3m). Net debt included 
a £2.8m liability valuation of the interest rate 
swap hedge on the bank loan (2009: £3.9m 
liability). The liability position arose because 
the fixed rate of interest payable on the swap 
was higher than the three month LIBOR rate 
receivable on the hedged portion of the loan for 
the remainder of its term.
Like the previous year, the Group remained well 
within its banking covenants and continued to 
achieve the financial targets which enabled it 
to benefit from a low margin on its bank debt of 
0.7% above three month LIBOR. Bank debt at 
the end of the year was comfortably below two 
times the EBITDA of 2010. The Group enjoys 
the security of a revolving credit facility of up 
to £30.0m (undrawn at the end of the year) as 
part of the overall bank facility which further 
enhances the Group’s overall liquidity.
Since the year end the Group has received 
commitments from a group of banks for a 
new five year facility of £170m to replace its 
existing facility which is due to expire in May 
2012. The new facility will provide the Group 
with more flexibility to finance future expansion 
plans as well as other growth opportunities. 
Documentation is being drafted between the 
Group and the participating banks and all 
parties are working to complete the process in 
the near future.
Dividends
The Directors are recommending to 
shareholders for approval a final dividend in 
respect of the period ended 30 December 
2010 of 7.1p per share, which taken together 
with the interim dividend of 3.4p per share 
paid in October 2010, gives a total dividend 
in respect of 2010 of 10.5p per share, a 0.5p 
increase on the level in 2009. Subject to 
shareholder approval, the final dividend will 
be paid on 6 July 2011 to shareholders on the 
register at 10 June 2011.
Board Changes
On 2 July 2010, Martina King and Rick Senat 
were appointed to the Board as independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Martina King was 
the first Managing Director of Yahoo! UK and 
Ireland before becoming the Managing Director 
of Yahoo! Europe. Rick Senat has sat on the 
Boards of a number of film companies and 
worked for 24 years at Warner Bros. Martina 
King and Rick Senat were also appointed 
to the Remuneration and Audit Committees 
respectively. Both Directors bring with them 
a wealth of experience in areas particularly 
relevant to Cineworld’s activities.
On 18 November 2010, Alan Roux left the Board, 
following the divestment by the Blackstone 
Group (“Blackstone”) of its 20.1% interest in 
the Group. Blackstone’s and Alan’s contribution 
have been of great value. Matthew Tooth, the 
second Blackstone appointed director, agreed 
to stay on in an independent capacity.
Current t rading and l ooking Ahead
With the improvement in the weather, the New 
Year has started well. We were pleased to see 
admissions return to levels expected for the 
time of year and have enjoyed some carry-over 
of business from the Christmas period, in 
particular with “Little Fockers” and “Gulliver’s 
Travels”. Moreover, the success of “The King’s 
Speech” has exceeded box office expectations, 
grossing over £40m in the UK to date as well 
as winning 4 Oscar awards.
A combination of strong current trading and 
long-term balance sheet stability following the 
expected refinancing provides the Group with 
attractive additional flexibility to push ahead 
with its expansion plans.
With a strong film release schedule in 2011, 
including over 30 3D films, the continued roll out 
of our digital projectors, increasing expectations 
for screen advertising and the roll out of new 
sites, we are confident of the prospects for the 
business in the forthcoming year.

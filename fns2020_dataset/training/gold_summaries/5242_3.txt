Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
In September 2011, eg announced interim results reflecting 
strong trading for the first half of the year based on 
deployment of the Nuqleus 3D (“N3D”) solution (acquired with 
XTAQ in March 2010) in two new clients and continued 
expansion of existing eg work manager
®
 clients. The 
re-engineering of our software platform to integrate eg work 
manager
®
 and N3D, and to replace the third party 
component, caused delays to anticipated roll-outs of our 
solutions, as a result of both the development and the 
undertaking of pilot projects with the new products. As a 
consequence, after an encouraging financial performance for 
the first half of the year, revenue and profit for the second half 
of 2011/12 fell below market expectations.
By the end of the year to 31 January 2012 we had 
successfully completed the re-engineering of our enterprise 
software platform, significantly enhancing our leading market 
position and resulting in strong demand for our products and 
services. At the end of the year we won five significant new 
contracts, from both existing and new customers in the UK 
and overseas, including an investment bank and a business 
process outsourcer. All of these contracts have significant 
potential for further expansion. This was followed in March 
2012 by the most significant contract win in the Group history 
with a leading global financial services company.
Existing and potential customers have responded very positively 
both to our existing products and to those we are developing. 
Growth in demand for back office optimisation solutions is 
increasing as financial services and businesses in other sectors 
seek to improve their effectiveness in challenging global 
markets. eg is now in an excellent position to take full 
advantage of the development of this market. The value of 
our order book is growing, along with our customer and user 
base, and recent new contracts have already provided a high 
level of revenue visibility for the current year. 
Financial results
Total revenue for the year was £4.71 million (2010/11: £5.15 
million). Software licences, maintenance and software services 
contributed 82 per cent (2010/11: 68 per cent) of total 
revenue with the balance coming from implementation and 
training services. 
Overall gross margin for the year was maintained at 62.8 per 
cent (2010/11: 62.7 per cent), reflecting increased product 
sales and the re-organisation of the sales and delivery teams.
As a result of the delays in new contracts, caused by the 
failure of the third party software component, profit before tax 
and exceptional costs fell to £0.15 million (2010/11: £0.45 
million). 
Profit after tax was £0.13 million (2010/11: £0.48 million).
Our continuing focus on tight cost control contributed to 
positive operating cash flow of £0.74 million (2010/11: £0.74 
million) and, after investment in research and development of 
£0.86 million (2010/11: £0.65 million), cash at 31 January 
2012 was £0.06 million (2010/11: £0.49 million) and is now 
£0.7 million.
The Board has decided not to recommend the payment of a 
dividend. 
Following the decision of Andrew McRae not to seek re-
election at the last AGM because of his increasing international 
commitments, in May 2011 Phil Lee joined the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director with Board finance responsibility. We 
have been fortunate in being able to draw on Phil’s extensive 
experience and knowledge of the financial services industry 
and, having formerly been an eg client in three previous roles, 
his knowledge includes a detailed understanding of eg and 
our products.
Current trading and outlook
The development of the back office optimisation software 
market is gaining momentum and eg is now reaping the 
rewards of the significant investment made in its software, 
products and services. Trading so far this year has been 
excellent, underpinning our confidence in achieving market 
forecasts.

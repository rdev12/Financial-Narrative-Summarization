Financial
Operational and strategic
There were strong headwinds in certain market segments and geographies 
exacerbated by historical under investment in certain parts of the business 
given the significant changes in the industry:
• Intense competition in the data center market and spending shifting to virtual 
and cloud based services.
• Wireless device vendors experienced lower profitability and a lull in new 
technology and service launches.
• Adverse macro-economic conditions in Europe coupled with spending caution  
by Chinese customers earlier in the year.
In spite of these challenges there were areas of progress:
• Structural reorganisation of the Group into business units to create maximum 
focus on meeting customers’ changing needs as reported in January 2014.
• Service providers increased infrastructure spending on high density core 
routers and 100G Ethernet.
• Spirent introduced a family of next-generation high speed Ethernet test 
solutions, incorporating market leading realism and scale, to address 
increasing complexity and the explosion of data traffic in service provider 
and data center networks.
• Launched Avalanche NEXT, a powerful, easy-to-use solution that tests the 
performance, scalability and security of application-aware network 
infrastructures with positive feedback from customers.
• Underscored our industry leadership in GNSS testing with the first 
commercially available support for the Chinese BeiDou satellite navigation 
system.
• Acquisition of the business of DAX Technologies Corp. (“DAX”) for a cash 
consideration of $37 .0 million announced on 18 February 2014. DAX is a 
leading provider of customer experience management solutions and will 
be reported within our Service Assurance division.
• Completion of the acquisition of a majority stake of 58% in Testing 
Technologies IST GmbH for a cash consideration of Euro 2.0 million on 
20 February 2014. The company, based in Berlin, Germany, develops and 
markets standards based and customer-specific software testing tools which 
support the development of mission-critical products and workflow steps.

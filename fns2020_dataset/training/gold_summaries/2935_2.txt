 Group financial highlights
Carillion made good progress in 2002 and the delivery of substantial
earnings growth is a significant achievement. Carillion has made 
a good start to 2003, winning new work to add to its strong 
order book. We therefore believe that the Group’s strategy remains 
sound and that despite the global uncertainty we will make further
progress in 2003.

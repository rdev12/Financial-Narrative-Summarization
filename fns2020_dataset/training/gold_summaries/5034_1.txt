Delivering growth
STRATEGY 
The Customer experience is at the 
heart of our culture. Our goal is to 
achieve steady, controlled growth in 
our core activities over the next two 
to three years while planning the 
‘bringing together’ of DX Freight and 
DX Express in order to create a 
better Customer experience across 
all our activities. 
Integrating our wide and 
complementary services under a 
single brand and streamlining their 
delivery through an efficiently run 
network will put us in a strong 
position to provide Customers with 
the outstanding service delivery that 
we are constantly striving for. Our 
objective is to create a ‘OneDX’ 
offering which provides Customers 
with market-leading choice and 
outstanding service levels delivered 
at commercially attractive prices.
A key objective for the Board over 
the next three years is to complete 
the turnaround of DX Freight. 
Purchased in 2012, DX Freight was a 
substantial acquisition, adding more 
than £120 million to DX’s existing 
revenues, which at that time were 
approximately £170 million. Whilst its 
acquisition has helped to position DX 
as an operator with scale and an 
unrivalled range of services, there is 
still considerable work to be done to 
achieve DX Freight’s full turnaround. 
We believe that this business has the 
potential to deliver a significantly 
enhanced performance as part of 
our ‘OneDX’ platform.
The ongoing design and 
development of our future ‘OneDX’ 
network is a key element in creating 
an efficient delivery platform. 
Further efficiency savings are being 
targeted through investment in both 
technology and infrastructure.  
This will also help to improve our 
Customer service levels as real-time 
and ‘on-road’ data is improved.  
As we combine delivery routes and 
different services into fewer sites, 
underpinned by a common 
technology platform, we will create  
a more streamlined and effective 
network that will be better able to 
serve our Customers. The continuing 
integration of DX Freight within the 
wider DX operations will contribute 
significantly to this streamlining and 
efficiency programme over the next 
few years. 
We are focusing on the growing 
segments of the market – parcels, 
freight and irregular dimension and 
weight (‘IDW’) deliveries. While our 
Document Exchange business, which 
is mainly used by the legal and 
financial services industries, is facing 
some of the challenges that are 
impacting on the mail market, this 
remains an important market for us. 
This business has demonstrated 
some resilience through its long-
established, end-to-end, superior 
service and through a secure 
network that offers earlier deliveries, 
later collections and cost saving 
opportunities against competitors’ 
mail services.
Innovations 
Digital encryption
Our Document Exchange service 
was born out of the legal sector’s  
need for a reliable, secure and 
affordable private mail network.  
We are now adding value to  
our Exchange Customers with 
the launch of eDX, enabling them 
to safely receive and deliver 
digitally-encrypted emails 
and files. 
Customer service
Our people are trained to 
respond to Customers’ needs, 
ensuring Customer loyalty and 
supporting growth. Over the 
past year we have invested in the 
development of the ‘Delivered 
Exactly’ training programme, 
which aims to ensure the perfect  
delivery experience for our 
Customers. 
Vehicle security 
To enhance our vehicle security, 
we have been trialling vehicles 
fitted with tracking devices and 
remotely activated immobilisers.  8 | DX (Group) plc Annual Report 2014

OUR BUSINESS MODEL
DX provides parcel, mail and 
logistics services through a number 
of different channels. Our focus is 
away from the mass market sectors 
of the delivery chain and on the 
growth segments of the market. 
Our approach to the business  
is founded on ‘the Five Cs’; 
Customers, Cost and Productivity, 
Core, Cash and colleagues.
Customers

our Customers throughout the UK 
and Ireland;

needs and providing solutions that 
offer them competitive advantage; 
and
 – Delivering new services that  
our Customers require.
 
Cost and Productivity
 – Focusing on tight cost controls;
 – Driving programmes to improve 
productivity throughout DX, with a 
particular focus on IT, operations, 
property and finance; and
 – Meeting Customers’ price 
expectations.
 
 
Core Markets
We are focusing the business on 
core market segments and services:
 – B2B and B2C parcels and mail 
services, especially for important, 
urgent, critical deliveries;
 – B2B and B2C network solutions, 
utilising the DX infrastructure to 
deliver cost effective solutions; and
 – Larger items in the 2-Man, 1-Man, 
Irregular Dimension and Weight 
and Logistics markets.
 
Cash
Continuing focus on:
 – Strong cash management;

Parcels
The parcel market broadly divides 
into three segments:
 – B2B – accounting for c.40% of the 
parcel delivery market. It generally 
tracks GDP growth and offers 
higher margins;
 – B2C – accounting for c.55% of  
the parcel delivery market. It has 
grown quickly driven by online 
retailing; and
 – C2X (Consumer to Business or 
Consumer) – accounting for 5%  
of the parcel delivery market and 
growing rapidly.
 
The parcel market is forecast to see 
steady absolute volume growth, with 
growth predominantly driven by the 
B2C market as internet retailing 
continues to gain market share.
 
Letters
The letters market can be divided 
into four areas: transactional items 
(such as invoices, bank statements 
and utility bills); direct mail 
(advertising, promotional material 
and catalogues); publishing 
(newsletters and magazines) and 
social mail (personal 
correspondence). Of these, the most 
significant sector is transactional 
letters, which makes up 
approximately 56% of the market.
Electronic substitution in letters has 
seen volumes decline substantially. 
The market is estimated to have 
fallen at a CAGR of 3.1% between 
2005 and 2008, and then at a CAGR 
of 6.3% between 2008 and 2013.  
It is forecast to decline at a CAGR  
of 4.9% between 2013 and 2018. 
However, this expected rate of 
decline may be offset by a 
continuation of the improving 
economic backdrop in the UK.
 
Market dynamics
The internet and electronic 
substitution will continue to have a 
material impact on mail and parcels, 
with mail in absolute decline and 
parcels benefiting from increasing 
use of internet retailing. While these 
are the major structural trends, the 
market is very complex, with some 
areas of growth in the letter market 
and electronic substitution adversely 
affecting some areas of the parcel 
market such as music, books and 
video games.
 
The internet shopping basket is 
becoming increasingly diverse as 
consumers’ adoption of the internet 
for shopping grows. This is especially 
evident in the parcels market where 
there is an increasing demand for the 
delivery of higher value items such 
as clothing, footwear, domestic 
appliances and furniture. Consumers’ 
use of the internet has also placed a 
greater emphasis on both the 
security and speed of deliveries, 
including increased demand for 
specified delivery time slots. All 
these trends play in our favour.
 
Overall, the Directors anticipate that 
the long-term reduction in DX’s mail 
volumes, which is most evident in 
our legal and public sector markets, 
will be offset by increased parcel 
volumes. The recovering economy 
and the trends highlighted above are 
presenting us with opportunities in 
many sectors of the parcel and mail 
markets, from the public sector 
through to the online retail market.
 
At the same time, the market 
remains competitive. While not 
immune to this competitive 
environment, our Customer-led 
approach means that we constantly 
strive for new and improved service 
levels, and our wide service offering 
is helping us to create solutions that 
meet the needs of our Customers.
 
In the B2C market, the continued 
trend towards ‘click and collect’ and 
collection from alternative locations 
is creating pressures for retailers, 
whilst the B2B market is relatively 
static with the decline of the High 
Street remaining a challenge. 
Nevertheless, we are supporting our 
Customers by providing ‘deliver-to-
store’ solutions as part of their 
supply chain, enabling smaller 
companies to offer ‘click and collect’ 
options. Another growth market for 
our e/retail Customers are orders 
placed from outside the UK. These 
create opportunities for the cross-
border movement of goods, which 
we have the capability to service.

courier services. While the decision 
has a short-term negative impact  
on revenues, it is in line with our 
strategy to focus on market 
segments where we can make more 
of a difference to our Customers. 
 
We were pleased to win a significant 
number of new contracts in the 
second half of the financial year, the 
benefits of which will be felt more 
fully in the new financial year.
 
We continued with our programme 
to update DX Freight’s fleet. 
Currently, we operate 730 vehicles 
and 554 trailers and are in the 
process of applying the DX livery 
across these fleets. So far, 180 
vehicles and 166 trailers carry the 
livery. We have started to add 50 
DX-liveried double-deck trailers, 
which will improve consignment 
integrity, while increasing capacity 
and the speed of loading and 
unloading. DX Freight is primarily  
a B2B operation but where we  
are using the operation for B2C 
deliveries we now have a home 
delivery surcharge.
Mail and Packets
Revenues from mail and packets 
delivery activities decreased by 3% 
to £116.1 million (2013: £119.2 million) 
as anticipated. Our core Document 
Exchange service which principally 
supports the legal sector but is also 
used by the financial and healthcare 
sectors, continues to see sales 
attrition, reflecting electronic 
substitution.
However, we continue to innovate 
and launched a secure email 
offering, eDX, and a secure paper 
shredding service exclusively for  
our Document Exchange Customers. 
While we expect attrition to 
continue, this service remains 
important to us and is a highly 
differentiated offering.
At the end of the year, we withdrew 
completely from the publications 
distribution market and from non-
Document Exchange, untracked 
mail. Revenue from this business of 
£3.6 million was low margin and not 
in keeping with our brand values. 
The capacity freed up in our network 
as a result will be better utilised by 
our growing parcels business.
 
We continue to broaden the sectors 
we target in mail and packets, 
although maintaining our focus on 
urgent, valuable or important items 
where we can deliver Customers 
added value. Newer market 
segments where we are making 
progress include ticket agencies and 
retailers. We are also developing a 
pre-delivery text alert system and 
alternative collection points to 
enhance our service offering.
Logistics
Revenues from logistics rose by 35% 
to £32.3 million (2013: £23.9 million). 
This strong growth principally 
reflected the growth of our services 
with existing Customers in the  
retail sector.
 
In December 2013 we sold our 
non-core Business Direct unit, an 
in-night distributor of engineering 
parts via a network of intelligent 
lockers and in-boot distribution. 
Adjusting for the sale of this activity, 
underlying revenue growth on 
continuing operations was 85%.
 
Although logistics is our smallest 
activity, it is a core part of our 
offering. We provide transport 
solutions to those owner operators 
who wish to outsource their vehicle 
fleet operations and often our DX 
1-Man and 2-Man services are also 
selected as additional options to the 
core logistics contract. Our aim is to 
remain focused on developing  
further relationships with Customers 
requiring an outsourced fleet size of 
up to 20 vehicles.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW OF  
THE BUSINESS
Introduction
Revenues from ongoing activities 
increased by 4% to £304.2 million 
(2013: £292.5 million), a very 
satisfactory performance against  
a challenging market background. 
We saw encouraging levels of  
new business wins, helped by our 
expanded range of services. The full 
benefits of these new contracts will 
be felt in the new financial year.
 
We continued to make further 
progress with the turnaround at DX 
Freight and across the company we 
have invested significantly in our IT 
infrastructure, which will improve our 
service levels and delivery capability 
in the coming years. The 
consolidation and development of 
our site network is another major 
and ongoing initiative.
 
In June 2014, we were delighted to 
win ‘Secure Delivery Service Provider 
of the Year’ in the annual Business 
Excellence Awards. The award is 
especially pleasing because it is 
voted for by our Customers. We also 
won ‘Net Express Export Volume 
Award 2014’ in July. This award was 
secured by our international service, 
which is delivered through the Net 
Express System, our international 
partner. In September 2013, DX 
Freight won the ‘National Courier 
Award for Technology 2013’ for 
excellence in delivery time 
technology.
 
Parcels and Freight
Revenues from our parcels and 
freight activities were broadly similar 
to last year at £163.6 million (2013: 
£162.6 million) and accounted for 
52% of DX’s total revenue. The 
results reflect strong growth in 
parcels, especially tracked parcels. 
However, there was an adverse 
impact to revenue from our decision 
to withdraw from lower margin

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements
We continue to invest in our teams, 
with over 8,000 man days of training 
undertaken across DX. Our training 
programmes are vital to ensuring 
high service levels for Customers 
and creating the culture that reflects 
our ‘Delivered Exactly’ commitment. 
It is important to us that our 
Customer promise is owned and 
delivered by all.
 
Our new apprenticeship scheme is 
bringing new talent into DX across 
the UK. We have added experienced 
and successful senior managers 
from both inside and outside our 
industry. The new talent we are 
bringing on board, combined with 
our existing team, will help to drive 
DX forward.
 
The last year has been exciting and 
challenging, and I would like to thank 
everyone for their outstanding 
efforts in helping to meet the 
company’s objectives and deliver a 
solid performance for DX’s first set 
of results as an AIM-quoted 
company.
 
OUTLOOK
DX’s Admission to AIM and its 
associated recapitalisation has 
created a firm financial foundation 
from which to build the business and 
greatly strengthens our ability to 
execute our longer-term growth 
strategy.
 
With some three quarters of DX’s 
revenues coming from the growing 
markets for parcels and freight, there 
is good resilience in the business 
model. There are also clear 
opportunities to build on our 
position in specific sectors such as 
secure mail and parcel deliveries for 
mission-critical, high-value items and 
time-sensitive deliveries.
Our ‘OneDX’ vision is driving 
significant operational improvements 
across the company that will 
underpin future organic profit 
growth. There is still a good deal to 
be accomplished, with the 
turnaround of DX Freight, a three 
year programme, and the design and 
development of our ‘bringing 
together’ project. We have made 
encouraging progress over the year 
and we are increasingly becoming 
‘Stronger Together’.
 
Trading in the first few months of the 
new financial year is in line with 
management expectations and we 
look forward to another year of 
steady, controlled progress as we 
continue to manage the turnaround 
of DX Freight and the creation of our 
‘OneDX’ proposition.

Network consolidation and 
development
Currently DX operates from over 70 
service centres across the UK, with 
DX Freight largely operating across 
separate centres. We are moving 
towards a fully unified ‘OneDX’ 
network infrastructure with 
economies of scale, efficiencies of 
flow and improved site utilisation, 
critical to our ambitions to provide 
Customers with an enhanced service 
experience. This work will continue 
over the next few years.
 
During the year, we closed 12 sites 
and opened three new large co-
located sites, with a fourth opened in 
September. We brought DX Express 
(our mail and packets operations) 
and DX Freight (our parcels and 
freight operations) together onto  
the same sites in Exeter, Plymouth, 
Northampton and Heathrow, our 
new Southern hub.
 
As part of our co-location 
programme, we completed an 
evaluation of our trunking and 
delivery networks and have aligned 
delivery routes. This has created later 
trunking times, benefiting both DX 
and our Customers.
 
OUR PEOPLE
We are delighted that many of our 
colleagues are now DX shareholders 
with a tangible stake in the 
company’s future. Our plan to 
harmonise pay and conditions will 
simplify how we run the business 
and provide a level playing field for 
all of our colleagues to prosper and 
advance their careers.

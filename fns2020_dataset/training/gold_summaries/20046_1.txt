 Strategic report
chief executive’s review
16   Lavendon Group plc 2014
Maintaining a clear strategic direction
In the previous Annual Report I set out the
vision for the future of Lavendon and a
roadmap to achieve our primary strategic
aim to deliver a ROCE greater than our
WACC over the business cycle.
I am pleased to report that the Group
achieved a ROCE of 11.9%
*
(2013: 10.6%) 
for the year, almost a full percentage point
ahead of our current WACC.

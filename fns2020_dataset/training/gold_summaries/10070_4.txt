 Melrose  
at a glance
Melrose aims to create significant gains by 
increasing the value of the businesses currently 
owned through substantial investment, and  
by seeking to make suitable acquisitions which  
have attractive potential rewards.
The Melrose Group is split into five segments:  
Elster Gas, Elster Electricity, Elster Water, Energy  
and Lifting. The Other Industrial division is now  
included in discontinued operations following the  
sale of Truth and Harris during 2013.
International 
operations
Melrose operates internationally. It has 
manufacturing facilities located throughout 
the world, predominantly in Europe and 
North America, but also has a growing 
presence in South America and the 
Far East, together with smaller scale 
operations in South Africa and Australasia.

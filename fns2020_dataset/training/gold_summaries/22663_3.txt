“Consort Medical has continued to

year and enhanced its operating 
performance”
dr peter Fellner
Consort Medical has continued to 
deliver strong organic growth in 
the year, enhanced its operating 
performance, largely completed the 
integration of Aesica, and has made 
substantial progress on its development 
and innovation pipelines.

Revenue increased by £92.1m (49.8%) 
to £276.9m (FY2015: £184.8m): this 
follows FY2015 which only received a 
six month contribution from Aesica. 
eBiT before special items increased by 
47.6% to £37.0m (FY2015: £25.1m). Over 
the year, Bespak eBiT margin grew to 
170bps to 21.5%, and Aesica eBiT margin 
grew 210bps to 7.4%. Adjusted basic ePs 
increased by 20.5% to 57.6p per share 
(FY2015: 47.8p). 
eBiTdA before special items grew 
£15.1m (45.3%) to £48.3m (FY2015: 
£33.2m), and capital expenditure was 
£21.5m (FY2015: £20.7m). Working 
capital reduced £20.2m to £14.0m 
(FY2015: £34.1m) which represents 5.0% 
of sales (FY2015: 12.3%).
The Group Balance sheet closed with 
a net debt position of £97.0m (FY2015: 
£99.2m), representing gearing of 
1.92× net debt: eBiTdA, in line with our 
expectations communicated at the 
time of the Aesica acquisition of below 
2.0× by FY2016.
delivering  
acquisition integration
during the year, we substantially 
completed the integration of Aesica 
into Consort, including the transfer of 
the Formulation development activities 
from nottingham to Queenborough, 
together with various restructuring 
actions at the Aesica sites, as 
signposted a year ago.
innovation and development
The Bespak and Aesica teams are 
working closely together to leverage 
each other’s customer relationships and 
to win new combined opportunities. 
in February, we celebrated the first of 
these with the signing of a development 
and manufacturing contract with 
Precision Ocular for devices and 
formulation services on their exciting 
novel drug products and delivery system 
— a first step into ocular treatments 
for the Group. This was coupled with 
Consort committing £3.3m to Precision 
Ocular’s equity financing.
Bespak has delivered solid progress on 
its development pipeline programmes, 
and has added two further programmes 
in addition to Precision Ocular. it has 
also made substantial progress with its 
innovation pipeline, leading towards 
the commercialisation of its syrina
®
 
and lila
®
 platforms, with several early 
stage development contracts, and the 
unveiling of a 2.25ml syrina
®
 device.

Consort MediCal plC 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
The Voke inhaler, the innovative 
non-electronic nicotine device, is a 
technically complex design which 
presents a number of challenges. We 
remain committed to the delivery of the 
product for successful launch, which we 
are hopeful of in the next 12 months.
in Aesica, the new Formulation 
development Centre at Queenborough 
is now operational. The semi-continuous 
processing line is now producing 
approved and launched product in the 
first major market with others expected 
to follow over the next 24 months. its 
s+Flurbiprofen has received market 
approval in Japan for the treatment of 
osteoarthritis, and launch stock is now 
being prepared.
people
i wish to thank our employees for 
their excellent contributions during 
the past year, which have been 
central to delivering the Company’s 
strong performance. i also thank our 
shareholders for their continuing support 
of the Company during this year of 
growth and acquisition consolidation.
o utlook
Consort has again delivered strong 
organic growth. in Bespak, this has 
once again been delivered through 
strong revenue growth and operating 
leverage. in its first full year under 
Consort ownership, Aesica has now 
been largely integrated, and delivered 
improved operating performance 
resulting in strong organic growth. The 
Group has achieved continued progress 
with opportunities in development and 
innovation. 
Consort’s development and innovation 
programmes are also providing a 
healthy pipeline for future organic 
growth. The new financial year has 
started well, and the Board remains 
confident of Consort meeting its growth 
expectations for the full year ending  
30 April 2017. 
dividend
The Board has reviewed the dividend 
and is proposing an increased final 
dividend of 12.56p (FY2015: 11.68p), 
making a total dividend for the year of 
19.31p (FY2015: 18.11p). The dividend 
will be paid on 21 October 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at 
23 september 2016, following our AGM 
on 7 september 2016. The shares will go 
ex dividend on 22 september 2016.

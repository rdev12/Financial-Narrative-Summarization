Annual Report & Accounts 2005
Chairman’s Statement 
by Richard Inglewood
IN MY FIRST CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT, IT IS A PARTICULAR
PLEASURE TO CONVEY FURTHER
GOOD NEWS. The period ended 
3 September 2005 was one of
major expansion for the Group. 
In November 2004, the acquisition of Meneba (UK) more than doubled
the size of Carr’s flour business, and in July 2005 the acquisition by our
associate company, Carrs Billington Agriculture (Operations), of certain
assets of W & J Pye (in administration) nearly doubled volumes of
compound and blended animal feed. In addition, Crystalyx Products, a
feed block joint venture, was established in Germany and a Carlisle-based
fuel oil distributor, Wallace Oils, was acquired.
The year also witnessed a seventh successive annual increase in adjusted
earnings per share.
Prospects for further progress remain good.

Annual Report & Accounts 2005
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The figures in this paragraph take no account of exceptional items. In
the 53 weeks (2004: 52 weeks), on turnover up 23.4% at £192.1m
(2004: £155.7m), total operating profit increased by 26.9% to £7.33m
(2004: £5.78m), whilst pre-tax profit was 19.8% ahead at £6.14m
(2004: £5.13m). Adjusted earnings per share advanced by 19.5% to
47.7p (2004: 39.9p). 
Exceptional items comprise an exceptional gain of £4.11m on the
disposal of the Bendall’s site and charges of £0.35m and £0.89m for
the post acquisition rationalisation of the acquired flour business and the
Pye business, respectively, a net gain of £2.88m. 
After exceptional items, the reported figures were a total operating profit
of £6.1m (2004: £5.8m), pre-tax profit of £9.02m (2004: £5.13m) and
earnings per share of 87.5p (2004: 39.9p).
Period end equity shareholders’ funds increased by 23.2% to £29.61m
(2004: £24.04m), representing net assets per share of 360.5p (2004:
297.7p). Net debt of £14.92m compared with £5.76m at 28 August
2004, giving gearing of 50.4% and 24.0%, respectively. This reflects the
£8.75m of cash required to fund the Meneba acquisition and the £1.32m
initial cash consideration for the Wallace acquisition. Net interest payable of
£1.19m (2004: £0.65m) was covered 6.2 times (2004: 8.9 times) by
total operating profit before exceptional items.
DIVIDENDS
A final dividend per share of 11.0p (2004: 9.0p), up 22.2%, is
proposed, payable on 19 January 2006 to shareholders on the register
at close of business on 16 December 2005, with an ex-dividend date of 
14 December 2005.
Together with the interim dividend per share of 5.0p (2004: 4.5p), total
dividends per share are 18.5% higher at 16.0p (2004:13.5p), covered
3.0 times (2004: 3.0 times) by adjusted earnings per share.
The AGM will be held at 11.30 a.m. on Monday 9 January 2006 at the
Crown Hotel, Wetheral, Carlisle.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
This has been a significant period for Carr’s, which included major
acquisitions strengthening our position in both the food and agriculture
markets. It is a testament to the underlying strength of our business
that it continued to perform well during this busy period. We are
especially pleased with the performance of our food business which,
despite flooding at a major customer’s premises in Carlisle in January
2005 and a serious fire at another customer one month later,
successfully integrated the Meneba business, with its two mills at
Kirkcaldy (Fife) and Maldon (Essex).
In July 2005 the Pye acquisition comprising four compound feed mills
and one blended feed mill enabled a certain amount of rationalisation 
in animal feed production which was commercially necessary. The
integration of this business with Carrs Billington Agriculture Operations
has proved challenging as we rationalise and we anticipate benefits to
be forthcoming in 2006.
Another major event late in the period was the disposal of the site from
which Bendalls Engineering operated and its relocation to a newly built
factory elsewhere in Carlisle, together with the purchase of new
equipment. The move took place during June and July 2005 and was
completed with minimal disruption to our production timetable and our
customers.
In September, post period end, we formed a joint venture company with
Wynnstay Group PLC and Welsh Feed Producers Limited to market
and sell animal feed, fertilisers and other farm requirements in Wales.
Carr’s interest in the joint venture is 50%.
BOARD
Sadly, David Newton resigned from the Board, because of illness, 
at the time of the Interim Announcement in April 2005, having been 
non-executive Chairman since April 1996. David Newton made a major
contribution to the Group’s growth during his time on the Board for which
we are all grateful. We wish him every good fortune in his retirement.
In September 2005, I was appointed his successor, having been a 
non-executive director since September 2004.
At the same time, Alistair Wannop was appointed a non-executive
director, bringing the number of non-executive directors to three. Alistair is
a major figure in Cumbrian agriculture and brings to the Board expertise in
both agriculture and food.
OUTLOOK
Agriculture
Prospects for Agriculture very much depend upon the successful
integration of the compound and blended feed operations of Carrs
Billington Agriculture with those of the Pye acquisition. Nonetheless 
we are confident that the strategy we have followed will provide real
benefits. More generally, the UK Agriculture business will have to
contend with challenging market conditions made more difficult by the
uncertainty and damage to farmers’ cash flow directly caused by
changes in the support regime.
Food
Flour is trading strongly in a market which continues to be satisfactory.
Flour has and will benefit from the successful integration of the Carr’s
Flour Milling and Meneba operations and from the effect of a full-year’s
ownership of the latter.
Engineering
Engineering, much the Group’s smallest activity, is on an upward trend, but
its continuing success is likely to be influenced significantly by the extent of
Bendalls success in winning nuclear decommissioning work from BNFL.
OVERALL
The Board believes that, in the period ending 2 September 2006, the
expanded business will register another creditable performance for Carrs.

 ClearDebt Group plc  
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
 
2 
 
I am delighted to present the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2009. 
 
The Group made a maiden pre-tax profit for the year of £460,923 (2008: loss of £1,221,860) resulting in a profit 
after taxation of £407,062 (2008: loss of £697,264). The successful diversification of the Group’s IVA activities 
into the debt management arena via the acquisition of Abacus (Financial Consultants) Limited (“Abacus”) has 
been the key to this turnaround. 
 
The Group’s balance sheet shows net assets of £4,535,318 (2008: £4,053,256) including cash of £584,593 
(2008: £265,537) which is sufficient to continue to develop the Group’s business over the next 12 months, given 
the positive cash flow now being enjoyed in both ClearDebt Limited (“ClearDebt”) and Abacus. 
 
The Group is now providing a complete offering of appropriate debt solutions to its clients and continues to 
realise synergies across its internet marketing platforms. The Group continues to invest in a substantial referral 
base and is further developing The Debt Advice Portal software to manage all of the Group’s external referral 
relationships.  I look forward to another profitable year following a good start to the first quarter.

 14 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Revenue has risen 15% to  
£19.6 million compared to  
£17.0 million in 2007 with 
improved contributions from  
all three product segments.
Earlier in the year it was necessary 
to advise shareholders that the 
business had experienced a delay 
in the closure of new business 
opportunities and the result for 
the first half of the financial year 
would be impacted by those 
delays. I am delighted to report 
that, as was forecast at the time 
of the announcement, those 
delayed sales have been 
concluded during the second 
half of the year.
the conclusion of those sales 
opportunities has meant that the 
second half performance of the 
business was substantially ahead 
of the first half. t he adjusted 
profit for the second half of the 
year was £3.3 million compared 
to £0.4 million in the first half.
operating expenses were 18.6% 
higher at £17.2 million when 
compared to £14.5 million in 2007.
t here are three significant 
components to this increase in 
costs; £2 million due to planned 
increased staff costs compared 
to 2007, £0.35 million due to 
the increase in amortisation of 
intangible assets and a net foreign 
exchange loss of £0.2 million.
During the year, the number of 
third party contractors has been 
reduced from a peak of 15 in the 
first half to 3 at the end of the year. 
o verall operating costs in 2009 are 
planned to be broadly in line with 
2008 so that anticipated increases 
in revenue will benefit the overall 
profitability. should there be 
an unanticipated contraction in 
revenue then contingency plans 
exist to reduce the cost base.

I am delighted to report a further 
and ongoing increase in the 
number of users for the Pro-mark 
professional trading tool. At the 
end of the financial year there 
were 571 billable users compared 
to 375 at the start of the year. 
Adoption of the Pro-mark 
tool at mF global, morgan 
stanley and newedge has been 
particularly strong during the 
year. two of our major customers 
have forward purchased their 
2009 trading screen requirement 
which is a clear demonstration of 
their commitment to both their 
businesses and Patsystems; this 
revenue will be recognised  
during 2009.
As a recognition of the 
significant product investment 
we have made in the Pro-mark 
product in 2008, it was awarded 
the “technology Product of the 
year” by Futures and o ptions 
w eek magazine.
Pro-mark 5.0 was released 
in July 2008 and this release 
contained a host of new 
functionality as well as an 
improved log-on capability 
improving download speeds  
for the start of the day’s  
trading by over 60%.
o ther functional improvements 
included an enhanced microsoft 
Excel plug-in capability to enable 
a broader population to use 
the functionality and Pro-mark 
Control, which enables an 
appropriately mandated super 
user or administrator to monitor 
or intervene on any order or 
trade account.
t he existing core system was 
improved by the release of 
version 4.0 for the software in 
september 2008; the release 
included a substantial extension 
to the data capacity of the 
order routing capability and 
further improvements to 
the transaction handling to 
ensure the product’s operating 
performance remains ahead of 
our customers’ requirements.
xlink is Patsystems’ 
proprietary network that 
enables Patsystems users 
to leverage both exchange 
memberships and operations 
within territories where they 
are not present, by way of 
utilising the installations and 
exchange memberships of other 
customers. xl ink adoption 
continued to grow in 2008.
Deployment of global trading, 
our new core offering, was 
delayed during the year due 
to integration issues and, as 
was reported at the half year, 
is not expected to contribute 
to revenue materially until the 
second half of 2009.
t he latest version of global 
trading, version 1.1, is functionally 
equivalent to the current core of 
the existing system and is fully 
compatible with the current 
trading screen versions of J-trader 
and Pro-mark, as well as all of our 
existing exchange connectivity.

exchange turkDEx , the tokyo

Revenue from our risk systems 
business grew by 21% to £1.7 
million from £1.4 million in 2007 
and £0.7 million in 2006. 
During the year there was 
considerable success for the Risk 
Informer product with new sales 
of the product to gH Financials 
and Royal Bank of Canada 
Capital markets to support the 
management of their post-
trade risk on exchange traded 
derivatives business.
there were further sales of 
extension licences to newedge 
and mF global during the year to 
support their additional business 
use of Risk Informer and a 
significant Risk Informer sale to a 
major investment bank to manage 
the trading of their clients for 
exchange traded derivatives.
It is firmly our belief that Risk 
Informer is the market leading 
product for the management 
and control of post-trade risk for 
exchange traded derivatives and its 
proven capability to risk other asset 
classes’ means that we continue to 
have great optimism for the growth 
in opportunities from this product.
I am pleased to announce 
that we have just concluded a 
successful beta of our new pre-
trade product, Risk monitor. 
As I stated last year, Risk monitor 
is a low latency pre-trade risk 
management tool designed to 
monitor trades ahead of them 
being traded on an exchange. t his 
provides the customer with the 
opportunity to be alerted or even 
to intervene before a trade occurs. 
w e have had considerable 
interest within our customer 
base for this type of capability 
and we expect Risk monitor to 
commence generating licence 
revenue in 2009.
ExCHAngE systEms
Revenue from the exchange 
systems business was £1.5 million 
for the year compared to 
£1.3 million in 2007, and was 
primarily from the provision 
of support, maintenance and 
associated consultancy services.
o n 4 January 2008, tokyo grain 
Exchange successfully launched 
three futures products, namely 
Arabica and Robusta bean coffee 
contracts and raw sugar, on the 
new continuous exchange system 
provided by Patsystems.
o n the 5 January, 2009 tokyo 
grain Exchange launched a non-
gmo soybean contract on the 
continuous exchange system.
In contrast to previous years 
there have been a number of 
sales opportunities to provide 
our matching engine capability 
in conjunction with our trading 
and risk offerings, though as yet 
none of these opportunities have 
materialised in sales. 
Chief Executive’s Report continued
“Revenue from our risk 
systems business grew 
by 21% to £1.7 million 
from £1.4 million in 
2007 and £0.7 million  
in 2006.”

the availability of the matching 
engine capability within our product 
portfolio continues to open up sales 
opportunities for the rest of our 
product range, with the Chinese 
Futures Exchange trading system 
and the Hong Kong mercantile 
Exchange being prime examples 
of this. these opportunities may 
not have been available without 
the dialogue about the matching 
and clearing product set as a first 
basis for engagement.
though we remain optimistic about 
the opportunity to successfully sell 
our exchange solution we have 
not factored any contribution from 
matching engine sales within our 
business plan for 2009.

w e continuously challenge  
and scrutinise the value that 
we get from our marketing 
expenditure and, in 2008, we 
invested £0.2 million. I am 
very satisfied as to how well 
established the key brand 
message we introduced in 2008 
has become. “powers trades. 
builds exchanges. manages 
risk.” neatly epitomises our 
core proposition and has been 
consistently reinforced in our 
marketing activities in 2008.
In 2008, we decided to withdraw 
from a number of trade shows 
that we felt had not delivered 
value, by way of foot fall, 
senior prospect or customer 
engagement, and have invested 
more extensively in the shows 
that we believe enable us to 
communicate our message  
most effectively.
In late 2008, we tested the use 
of an on-line marketing 
approach rather than the 
mixture of trade press adverts 
and advertorial we have used 
in the past. t his was highly 
successful and delivered 
a measurable return on 
investment. For 2009, we have 
appointed a us agency to 
support our Head of marketing 
based in Chicago in extending 
the on-line marketing strategy.

o ur strategy remains unchanged 
in that we aspire to be the 
trusted technology partner of 
choice for our customers and 
prospects within our area of 
domain expertise; electronic 
trading systems, exchange 
systems and risk.
o ur internal product investment 
and continued ongoing search 
for potential targets for 
acquisition is focused at present 
on complementing the existing 
product capability and strategy.
As I reported above, we have 
continued to invest across the 
existing product range as well 
as continuing the development 
of new product offerings such 
as Risk monitor.

within 2008, we launched an 
extension to our capability to 
support the broadest possible 
range of products and trading 
styles with an extension module 
to our existing syoms system.
syoms is a Patsystems tool 
that enables traders to execute 
products that do not exist on an 
exchange, such as a stop, time 
triggered or limit orders, by 
simulating their existence.
the new extension module to 
syoms is called Algoserver and 
enables syoms to support a range 
of algorithms. t he first release has 
a selection of algorithms provided 
by Patsystems but subsequent 
versions will enable users to 
introduce their own algorithms  
by way of our proprietary API.
In 2009, our focus will be 
to conclude the first live 
deployments of both global 
trading and Risk monitor and 
to commence the first beta 
deployment of Algoserver to one 
of our existing syoms customers.
t he other significant investment 
that we will be making in 
2009 is the establishment of a 
technical framework to reduce 
the ongoing development 
and support costs of exchange 
connectivity for the future. 
we have recruited a new product 
head for the connectivity team 
and removed the fragmentation 
that existed with our connectivity 
team members being based in 
both london and Chicago.
the instigation of new processes 
and the change in individuals 
within the team will mean 
there will be a lower level 
of productivity within the 
connectivity team in the first half 
of 2009, but we expect to see the 
return on improved productivity 
and shorter development lead  
times in future periods.

though the compliment of staff has 
changed during the year, overall 
staff numbers are broadly the same 
as the start of the year at 156.
Headcount increases within the

compensated for by efficiencies 
and head count reductions 
elsewhere in the business. we have

opportunity for our staff to develop

 2 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
2012 proved to be another difficult 
year for local media, but we have 
worked hard to develop our 
strategy to compete in a rapidly 
changing environment.
Chairman’s Statement
also has an essential role to play as we 
continue the relaunch of our titles and 
focus on improving our subscription rates. 
All of this will be set against the overriding 
objective of continuing the huge strides we 
have made in reducing the Group’s debt.
The difficult trading environment which we 
reported for the early part of 2012 continued 
throughout the year with the UK economy 
returning to recession. Digital advertising 
revenues grew strongly by 12.0% to £20.6 
million, but were not sufficient to prevent  
a decline in total revenues before non-
recurring items for the year of £45.2 million 
(12.1%) to £328.7 million (see page 18). 
Although our title re-launches and cover 
price increases resulted in only a 4.0% 
decline in newspaper sales revenue, print 
advertising revenues dropped by 14.8%  
to £181.3 million. The Group’s cost 
performance for the year was outstanding, 
with non-recurring operating costs down by 
£37.6 million (12.2%). Our underlying 
operating profit (before non-recurring and 
IAS 21/39 items) for 2012 fell by 4.7% after 
adjusting for the impact of the partial 
cancellation of our printing arrangements 
with News International. This contributed 
(£3.9 million) to the reduction in headline 
operating profit to £57.0 million (down 11.6% 
on 2011) and delivered a one-off cash receipt 
of £30.0 million. There was an operating 
profit margin of 17.4%, a slight increase  
on 2011. 
Underlying earnings per share (before 
non-recurring and IAS 21/39 items) were 
3.42p, compared to 3.50p in 2011. Net 
profit after tax was £5.6 million. Cash flow 
performance was once again strong with 
net debt at the end of the year of £319.4 
million, a reduction of £32.3 million from  
the start of 2012.
The steps forward that we have made in 
strategic development this year helped to 
push our share price to higher levels in the 
autumn than we had seen for some time, 
although there is much to do to return it  
“ The pace of change and innovation 
increased across the Group during the 
year and that will continue in 2013.”
We laid out our strategic aims for the 
Group’s development last April and are 
now implementing that vision for the future 
of our business. The pace of change and 
innovation increased across the Group 
during the year and that will continue in 
2013. Our Chief Executive Ashley Highfield 
provides more details of subsequent steps 
– and future plans – in his report. It is 
essential that we increase our profitability 
and use the changes and innovations that 
we are undertaking to grow revenues.  
To do so, digital will be key (both in terms 
of new services and growing our audience 
reach) but our established print business

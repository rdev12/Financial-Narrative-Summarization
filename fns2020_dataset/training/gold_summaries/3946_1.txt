Consort Medical plc  
Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
In our last Annual Report, 
I outlined how the Group 
had executed on its growth 
strategy in both Bespak 
and King Systems. 
That progress has continued in FY2013. In 
Bespak, we have launched a product from 
the development pipeline, and have also 
been awarded a potentially transformational 
programme from Nicoventures. King Systems 
was divested from the Group in February 2013, 
with a very full valuation being realised, reflecting 
the success of the new investment and strategy 
in the business in the last few years. We have 
also delivered on our financial expectations and 
end the year with a very strong balance sheet, 
and with a development portfolio that is set to 
deliver significant organic growth. 
On a like for like basis

, revenue from products 
and services increased by £1.7m (1.3%) 
to £129.5m (FY2012: £127.8m). Bespak 
revenues
2
 from products and services rose by 
£1.5m (1.7%) to £95.0m (FY2012: £93.5m) and 
King revenues
2
 rose by £0.2m (0.4%) to £34.5m 
(FY2012: £34.3m).
On a like for like basis
1
, operating profit before 
special items increased by 2.9% to £21.5m 
(FY2012: £20.9m). Bespak’s operating profit
2
 
grew 6.6% to £19.5m (FY2012: £18.2m) with its 
operating margin increasing to 20.5% (FY2012: 
19.5%). King’s operating profit
2
 decreased 23.0% 
to £2.0m (FY2012: £2.6m) with its operating 
margin declining to 5.9% (FY2012: 7.6%).
On a like for like basis
1
, profit before tax and 
special items increased by £0.9m (4.4%) to 
£19.6m (FY2012: £18.7m).
Adjusted EPS from continuing and discontinued 
operations increased by 5.2% to 54.9p per share 
(FY2012: 52.2p). Basic EPS from continuing and 
discontinued operations increased by 71.7% to 
84.9p per share (FY2012: 49.5p) due to the gain 
on disposal of King Systems (see note 11 to the 
financial statements).
Like for like Cash Flow from operating activities
1 
increased to £20.0m (FY2012: £17.6m). 
Like for like EBITDA
1
 before special items was 
up £1.1m (4.0%) at £28.3m (FY2012: £27.2m). 
Working Capital on a like for like basis was down 
at £8.4m (FY2012: £9.3m) representing 8.8% 
of sales (FY2012: 10.1%) following a sustained 
tightening of working capital management 
processes throughout the year.
Capital expenditure of £11.0m (FY2012: £12.1m) 
was lower than the previous year, which saw 
investment in the King Systems transformation 
programme draw to a close. The cash proceeds 
on disposal of King Systems totalled £74.7m of 
which £57.1m was used to repay the Group’s 
debt in full leaving the Group balance sheet in 
a net cash position of £37.0m (2012: Net debt 
£37.7m). With headroom of £76.1m under its 
undrawn banking facility, and a further £25.0m 
available under the accordion facility, the Group 
has significant cash resources available.
Further commentary on the financial results is 
contained within the Chief Financial Officer’s 
review, in particular this year to clarify the 
financial performance on a like for like and 
statutory reporting basis, in the light of the King 
Systems’ disposal.
The Board is proposing a 5% increase in the 
final dividend to 12.71p (FY2012: 12.1p), 
making a total dividend for the year of 19.71p. 
This increase rebases the Company’s dividend 
cover, and underlines the Board’s confidence 
in the sustainability of the current performance, 
and in the prospects for the conversion of 
its development opportunities into increased 
revenue and operating leverage.
Last year we reported that we had added three 
new programmes to our development pipeline. 
This year, our focus has been on progressing 
these opportunities through our pipeline towards 
Chief 
Executive’s 
Review 
Consistent strong 
financial performance 
and strategic 
execution.
“...continued progression of the development 
pipeline towards launch and the divestment 
of King Systems for a full price before 
contingent consideration.”

launch. I am pleased to report that in March 
this year the Chiesi NEXThaler (DEV750) was 
launched, and production is ramping up to 
support demand. We also signed an exclusive 
commercial supply agreement with Nicoventures 
for a novel nicotine delivery device. We also have 
a number of new opportunities which are under 
discussion, including novel IP-led opportunities 
from our Cambridge-based Innovations team. 
In December 2012 we announced that we 
had signed a contract with Nicoventures, 
to supply a novel nicotine inhalation device 
(previously referred to as the Oxette device). 
The device is intended as a safer alternative 
to smoking, delivering a regulated dose of 
nicotine to the user. In the previous year we 
had been developing the Oxette product with 
Kind Consumer, and producing samples for 
them to conduct clinical trials. Kind Consumer 
Limited has responsibility for obtaining market 
authorisation for the product, and their 
application is currently [being considered] by 
the MHRA. Following regulatory authorisation, 
through a licensing agreement, the global 
commerical rights will pass to Nicoventures. 
Nicoventures awarded Bespak a multi-year 
exclusive supply contract. This programme is an 
important business win for Bespak. We are very 
encouraged by this opportunity.
We have continued to invest in our Innovations 
team during this year: the Cambridge-based 
team now stands at ten and growing, and 
we are now investing over £1m per annum in 
this aspect of our R&D alone. During a recent 
Investor Day at Bespak, we unveiled for the 
first time some of the developments which are 
being worked on. We have a clear Innovation 
philosophy and methodology, at the core of 
which is the identification and satisfaction 
of unmet needs in patients, clinicians, Life 
Sciences companies, commercial arena and 
other technical requirements. We have received 
positive responses to our innovations, and we 
expect to be translating some of them into firm 
commercial development opportunities in the 
coming months and years.
In December we announced the divestment 
of King Systems, our US-based subsidiary 
engaged in the development and manufacture 
of disposable supplies to anaesthetists and 
emergency care practitioners. In recent years, 
we have made significant investments to improve 
the efficiency and reduce the operating costs of 
the business through factory consolidation and 
automation, and to deliver enhanced organic 
revenue growth through the development of the 
King Vision video laryngoscope. It is testament to 
the turnaround achieved in the business that we 
received a number of unsolicited approaches to 
purchase the business, and agreed a sale which 
provided us with both an attractive up front 
consideration, and a potentially substantial earn 
out. The sale completed on 15 February 2013.
We have continued to execute on our strategy 
for diversified growth which we launched 
in 2008. At that time, Bespak was primarily 
focused on the respiratory market, and King 
Systems was in need of new revenue streams 
and a more efficient cost base. Our strategy 
enabled us to reposition King’s cost base 
and to create a strong engine of new organic 
growth for the business, which enabled us 
to sell it at a full valuation. In 2008, Bespak 
was principally engaged in the design and 
manufacture of devices for respiratory drugs; 
by contrast, today it has diversified such that it 
operates in nasal, injectables, nicotine delivery, 
ocular and POC diagnostics. Moreover it has 
secured a greater share of the value chain than 
previously, through the addition of drug handling 
services to its customers, through one of the 
nasal development contracts as well as to 
Nicoventures. 
Following the divestment of the King Systems 
business, our core strategy remains unchanged. 
Over the past five years, we have successfully 
diversified the business both horizontally and 
vertically, strengthened the cost base, and 
made selective investments into both the 
Medical House Injectables technology, and the 
Atlas Genetics POC diagnostics business. Our 
strategy will continue with a tighter focus on the 
Life Sciences market, as we exploit the organic 
development opportunities in front of us. In 
addition, we will look to grow the business 
through inorganic means as suitable and value 
enhancing opportunities which fit with the 
Bespak business become available, and which 
can be leveraged to create further enhanced 
shareholder value. 
In summary it has been a very significant year in 
a number of areas: consistent strong financial 
performance; strategic execution in progressing 
the development pipeline towards launch; the 
successful launch of the Chiesi NEXThaler; 
securing a potentially transformational contract 
from Nicoventures; and the divestment of 
King Systems at an attractive valuation. We 
look forward optimistically to continuing strong 
performance as our strategy continues to deliver.

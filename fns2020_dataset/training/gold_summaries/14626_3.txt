SUMMARY 
●  SUCCESSFUL FLOTATION 
●  TURNOVER DOUBLES
●  STRONG GROWTH IN PRODUCT SALES 
●  BOARD ESTABLISHED AND FUNCTIONING 
INTRODUCTION
I am pleased to present my ﬁ rst report as Chairman of SPI Lasers plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2005. The Company achieved 
a successful ﬂ otation on the AIM market on 26 October 2005, 
raising £10.5 million net of expenses to help ﬁ nance the 
Company’s development. Signiﬁ cantly, all the private equity 
investors who ﬁ nanced the early years of SPI have retained 
their investment, and have been joined by a broad spread of 
institutional and individual shareholders.
The ﬂ otation has also marked the end of the transitional period 
for the business in which it refocused away from communications 
towards the fast growing ﬁ bre laser arena. Having released its 
ﬁ rst products and achieved sales, the Company is using the capital 
raised to expand its product portfolio and channels to market.
PERFORMANCE DURING 2005
The Company achieved a number of signiﬁ cant milestones during 
2005. Turnover doubled over the previous year’s outcome, with 
both product sales and contract revenues growing strongly. 
The Company currently derives a considerable amount, though 
minor proportion, of its revenues from contract development 
and bespoke products, though this proportion will decline as 
the range and market penetration of SPI’s standard products 
grow. Customer evaluations of SPI products increased, over thirty 
accounts were opened and increasingly our revenues are being 
generated from repeat business from established purchasers.
THE BOARD
During the second half of 2005 we have established a Board 
appropriate for the needs of an AIM listed company. Amongst 
the non-executive directors, there is a blend of continuity and new 
faces. Dave Cheesman and Dave Shrigley have been joined by 
Dr Peter Schultz and me as Chairman. The Board is developing 
quickly into an effective team, responding well to the challenges 
demanded of a quoted company. A good start has been made in 
addressing the issues arising in today’s Corporate Governance 
environment. Further progress will be made in this area in 2006.
EMPLOYEES
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all our employees 
for their contribution and support during the past year. My thanks 
also go to my fellow Board members and the senior management 
for all their efforts.
“ SPI LASERS IS A YOUNG COMPANY. 
IN 2005, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT 
WE COULD ACHIEVE TRACTION IN THE 
RAPIDLY GROWING FIBRE LASER ARENA. 
THE EXCITING CHALLENGE FOR 2006 
AND BEYOND IS TO SUSTAIN THAT 
MOMENTUM WITH A BROADER RANGE 
OF PRODUCTS AND ACROSS A WIDER 
RANGE OF APPLICATIONS.” www.spilasers.com 
STRATEGY
The overall strategy for the Company has developed further 
during the year. In the near term we will continue to broaden our 
addressed sectors in the MICRO market aided by the introduction 
of the 200W laser and the release of our ﬁ rst product for the 
fast growing laser MARKING market. In the medium term we 
continue to investigate entry strategies into the MACRO market.
SPI Lasers is a young company. In 2005 we demonstrated that 
we could achieve traction in the rapidly growing ﬁ bre laser 
arena. The exciting challenge for 2006 and beyond is to sustain 
that momentum with a broader range of products and across a 
wider range of applications.

CUTTING
With a strong ethos of product innovation, technology 
leadership and customer focus, SPI Lasers is enabling 
the resolution of some of today’s most challenging and 
commercially sensitive manufacturing issues. 
Where existing technology has previously limited the 
precision cutting of miniature parts, the ﬁ bre laser has 
enabled manufacturers to produce ground breaking 
microscopic cut detail in some of the world’s smallest 
coronary stents.
The highly competitive electronics sector continues to 
leverage the enormous beneﬁ ts of SPI’s technology, for 
example, superior cut quality of solder mask stencils for 
circuit boards.

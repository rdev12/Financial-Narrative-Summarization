About us and highlights
About us
Cable & Wireless is the leading telecoms operator in the majority of countries in 
which it operates. It is the second largest fixed network telecoms operator in the UK.
Its principal operations are in the UK, the Caribbean, Panama, Macau and Monaco.
It provides voice, data, broadband, internet protocol (“IP”) and mobile services to business
and residential customers, fixed and mobile telecoms carriers, mobile operators and content,
application and internet providers.
Its extensive international network conveys traffic between these operations and provides 
a platform from which to offer telecommunication services to other carriers.
Highlights
Cable & Wireless completed the second year of its turnaround programme with 
a robust financial performance and further progress in reshaping the Group. Key
developments included:
– restructuring of UK operations around customer segments;
– acquisition of Bulldog Communications and a controlling interest in Monaco Telecom;
– expansion of National Telcos’ broadband and mobile activities;
– completion of US exit for £220 million and withdrawal from Japanese domestic 
market; and 
– launch of £250 million share buyback.
We achieved further cost savings in the traditional legacy voice and data sectors. Led by 
a strengthened management team, we accelerated investment to position the Group for
profitable growth in new services. Shortly after the year end, we announced a three-year 
plan to develop an IP-based Next Generation Network in the UK and confirmed that Bulldog
had completed the first phase of its local loop unbundling programme ahead of schedule.
In National Telcos, we have continued to invest in our broadband and mobile infrastructure.

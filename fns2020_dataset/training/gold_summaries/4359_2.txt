Dairy Crest produces leading spreads 
and butter brands at two factories in 
UK and one in France. These brands 
have strong distribution through 
retailers in both countries. Our three 
key brands, St Hubert, Clover and 
Country Life have all grown sales 
ahead of the market in 2009/10
Dairy Crest has a world-class cheese 
supply chain. Milk from a dedicated 
pool of dairy farmers is turned into 
award winning cheddar at Davidstow 
in Cornwall. The cheese is matured 
for up to two years in Nuneaton and 
then packed at Nuneaton and Frome. 
Dairy Crest’s leading cheddar brand, 
Cathedral City dominates the UK 
branded cheese market
We process and deliver fresh 
conventional, organic and flavoured 
milk to major retailers, ‘middle ground’ 
customers ranging from coffee shops 
to hospitals and on the doorstep.
 We manufacture and sell FRijj, the 
leading fresh flavoured milk brand, 
cream and milk powders

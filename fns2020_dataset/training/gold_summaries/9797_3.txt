 Chairman’s Statement
For the sixth year in a row, the Group has achieved
record sales and profit before taxation. Turnover
in the twelve months to 31 December 2003
increased by 2.2 per cent, to £349.5 million (2002:
£342.1 million) and, on a like for like basis, this
increase was 6.5%. Operating profit in the year
increased by 5.6 per cent to £53.1 million (2002:
£50.3 million) and on a like for like basis the
growth was 7.1%. These like for like results
exclude the Flooring business that was sold in
November 2002 and the effect of two small
acquisitions.
Group Overview
All Divisions produced good sales growth.
Landscape Products increased by 6.8 per cent,
Clay Products by 6.2 per cent, and Natural Stone,
including acquisitions, by 14.3 per cent. In a low
inflation environment this sales growth is very
pleasing. Our improvement in profitability is
underpinned by four things: a strong marketing
and new product development programme; a
commitment to the highest levels of customer
service; a programme of capital investment which
has amounted to over £100 million in the past
three years; and a relentless drive to lower
operating costs.
Landscape Products Division
The Division had sales of £288.8 million (2002:
£270.4 million), an increase of 6.8 per cent over
last year. Operating profit was £44.9 million (2002:
£41.2 million), up 8.8 per cent.
Activity during the year was as strong in the
commercial and public sectors as it was in the
domestic business. Our network of Approved
Installers enables us to maintain a close watch on
order backlog. This information gives us
confidence to believe that the outlook remains
positive.

Clay Products Division
The Division increased sales by 6.2 per cent to
£32.1 million (2002: £30.3 million). Operating
profit was £4.2 million (2002: £4.4 million).
After a poor start to 2003, which as we explained
in our half-year statement was due to a shortage
of supply of a certain raw material, sales in the
second half were 8.7 per cent ahead of the second
half of 2002. The underlying increase in operating
profit has shown good progress in the second half
of the year.
The outlook is encouraging with industry stocks at
historically low levels and demand stronger than
it has been for some years. We also believe we can
achieve further improvements in our operating
efficiency.

Natural Stone Division
Sales in the Division amounted to £28.5 million
(2002: £25.0 million), 14.3 per cent ahead of 2002.
These numbers include acquisition turnover that
accounted for 11.3 per cent of this growth.
Operating profit increased by 23.5 per cent to £4.1
million (2002: £3.3 million) of which 16.2 per cent
arose from acquisitions.
The Division tends to be associated with high
profile prestigious projects, most recently the
pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, and the re-
layout of the Somerset House courtyard.
Currently, the Division is supplying products for
Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport. Other prestige
schemes in towns and cities around the country
are in the pipeline.
Balance Sheet
The Group balance sheet remains strong. Cash
inflow from operating activities amounted to
£81.3 million (2002: £54.6 million). Net
borrowings at the year-end of £13.2 million (2002:
£17.9 million) represent gearing of 6.1 per cent
(2002: 8.8 per cent) despite capital expenditure of
£40.8 million. Stock was reduced by £6.2 million in
the year.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final dividend of 7.35p
(2002: 6.70p) per ordinary share making a total of
11.00p (2002: 10.00p) for the year, an increase of
10.0 per cent compared with 2002. The dividend
will be paid on 7 July 2004 to shareholders on the
Register on 4 June 2004. The ex-dividend date will
be 2 June 2004.

Improved Capital Structure / Return of
Value to Shareholders
The Board of Marshalls intends, subject to the
arrangement of appropriate debt financing and
following approval by shareholders at a Court
Meeting and an Extraordinary General Meeting
which will both follow the Annual General
Meeting set for 10 June 2004, to return in the
order of £75 million to shareholders during the
course of this summer.
It is envisaged that this return of value will be
undertaken through the creation of redeemable B
shares (and the subsequent redemption thereof)
and will be achieved through the introduction of
a new holding company for the Group via a court-
approved scheme of arrangement and a
subsequent reduction of capital, thereby creating
additional distributable reserves for the Group.
This return of value will enable Marshalls to create
a more efficient capital structure, whilst also
providing it with sufficient financial flexibility to
take advantage of future investment
opportunities.
Management
As previously announced, Graham Holden, Chief
Executive of the Landscape Products Division
since November 2000, has become Group Chief
Executive with effect from 1 January 2004. David
Sarti, who was Operations Director of that
Division, has been appointed Managing Director
of Marshalls Landscape Products.
John Marshall, Deputy Chairman, who has worked
at Marshalls for more than forty years, and been a
member of the Board since 1972, has indicated
that he would like to retire at the Annual General
Meeting. This is slightly ahead of what would have
been his expected retirement date, but the Board
has accepted his decision.
He has made a very valuable contribution to the
business over the years, especially through his
unique knowledge of all our production facilities.
He will be missed by everybody at Marshalls from
the shop floor to his Board colleagues. He will also
be remembered with affection by his many
friends in the Industry both in the UK and other
parts of the world.
I would like personally to record my appreciation
for the loyal support, help and encouragement he
has given me during my time as Chairman.
During the second half of the year, there was a
complete change in Non Executive Directors with
the appointment of Andrew Allner and Richard
Scholes. In the light of these recent Board
changes, the Board has now started the process of
finding a new Chairman. This follows my decision
to step down as Chairman at the conclusion of the
Annual General Meeting.
I would like to thank my fellow Directors, the
management team and all employees throughout
the Group for their excellent contribution towards
achieving another record result in 2003.

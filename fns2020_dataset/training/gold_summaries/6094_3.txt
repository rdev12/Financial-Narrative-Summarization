 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
During 2007 there was good progress with the strategic
repositioning of Flomerics following the acquisition of NIKA GmbH
(“NIKA”) in July 2006. Flomerics is continuing to maintain a strong
competitive position in its original field, the application of fluid flow
simulation to electronics cooling, where it is a world leader. It now
addresses this specialist market both by its original product,
FLOTHERM, and by the EFD product range acquired from NIKA. At
the same time the Company is taking advantage of EFD to address
much wider applications of fluid flow simulation and hence a much
larger market. The electromagnetics simulation business (“the EM
business”) was disposed of in January 2008 so that Flomerics can
have greater focus on fluid flow simulation.
Good progress was made with integrating the FLOMERICS and
NIKA technologies and increasing the sales team to implement the
new strategy. The Company is still at an early stage in building the
EFD business outside of its original markets, but the strong growth
in sales of the product has demonstrated the significant benefits
that the investments can bring to future periods.
Results
Total revenues for the year ended 31 December 2007 were up by
14% at £16.3m (2006: £14.2m). If revenues from the discontinued
EM business are excluded, revenues were up by 18% to £14.6m
(2006: £12.4m).
Profit before tax, amortisation of intangible assets (excluding
software and R&D capitalisation), goodwill impairment, share-based
payments and exceptionals (“adjusted PBT”) was £1.3m (2006:
£1.5m) reflecting the investments made during the year. There were
no exceptional items in 2007 (2006: £222,000). The unadjusted loss

for the year was £1.90m (2006: £0.80m profit) and Basic loss per
share was 8.81p (2006: earnings per share: 4.45p)
Cash generated from operations was £1.9m (2006: £0.9m). 
Cash balances for the Group at 31 December 2007 were £2.97m
(2006: £2.34m). After the year end £1.6m cash was received from
the disposal of the EM Business. As at 31 March 2008 cash 
balances were in excess of £5.5m.
Dividend
The board is pleased with the progress being made and is proposing
that the dividend should be increased by 14% to 1.6p per share
(2006: 1.4p). Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting,
the dividend will be paid on 3 June 2008 to shareholders on the
register at 9 May 2008.
Regional performance
In Europe and Asia-Pacific there was good revenue growth of 25%
and 35%, respectively, compared to 2006. In the US, revenue fell
slightly as a result of the loss of some key sales staff, but we now
have a full team in place to implement the new strategy there. The
breakdown of turnover by region was: Europe 45.8%, Asia Pacific
21.5% and US 31.7%.
Impairment of intangible assets
The main impact of IFRS on the 2007 accounts was that the
acquisition of NIKA has been restated under IFRS 3 and a value
attributed to the intangible assets acquired (such as customer lists
and technology) with the balance deemed to be goodwill. These
intangible assets have been amortised over an appropriate period
and the residual goodwill arising was subject to an impairment
review. After this review goodwill was written down by £2.22m
resulting in a total charge to the P&L of £3.1m in respect of 
these two items. 
Disposal
On 20 December 2007 the Board announced the disposal of the
Group’s electromagnetics business to CST GmbH for a consideration
of £1.6m. The sale was completed on 31 January 2008 and the
gain on disposal will be recognised in 2008. The proceeds will be
used to enhance the Company’s position for future growth in 
its core business areas.
Outlook
There is the opportunity for sales of the EFD product range to
continue growing strongly and to make an increasingly significant
contribution to the business. Investments in sales and marketing
during 2007 have placed the Company in an excellent position 
to take advantage of the wider market opportunity for the EFD
products whilst maintaining Flomerics’ leading position in the field
of electronics cooling. As a result, the Directors are excited about
the future and confident that the investments will start to deliver 
a significant increase in shareholder value.

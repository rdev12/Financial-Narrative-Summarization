 Robert Purcell discusses the strategy 
and development of the business
“ Self-help initiatives remain the 
focus of our attention as we build  
a robust platform for growth. ”
 Robert Purcell
 Chief Executive
Q 
How is the turnaround  
plan progressing? 
A 
We have a three phase plan to 
deliver profitable growth and 
shareholder value. Phase One, the 
Restructure phase, is on track and we are 
making excellent progress, concentrating 
on improving our processes across the 
board and making sure we have the right 
capacity and cost base for the business. 
A key aspect of this phase is our project 
to close the Bredbury facility and transfer 
production to other Renold sites, which 
remains on time and on budget. 
Our aim is to create a robust and 
sustainable business from the 
improvements we are making and it  
is pleasing to see our breakeven point 
reducing as our self-help measures 
continue to deliver benefits. We are 
keenly aware that much remains to be 
done, even with the significant progress 
made this year. We still have many  
areas where we can further improve  
our business and reduce our cost base.
Q 
What other changes are you 
making within the business? 
A 
Firstly, we are working hard 
on our health and safety 
performance. We have introduced 
the Renold Framework through which 
we are ensuring that we perform to the 
same high standards around the world. 
We believe a safe working environment 
is fundamentally aligned with high 
performance in the business as a whole.
We are looking to achieve superior 
performance in all areas of the business. 
Historically the business has been 
tolerant of average performance and has 
not demanded high enough standards. 
We are therefore working to simplify 
processes, to give better service and 
fundamentally make ourselves easier to  
do business with. Our simple objective is  
to ensure that customers receive the 
product and service they require.
We are focused on ensuring that the value 
we generate from our superior products 
stays within the business and delivers 
enhanced returns to shareholders. An 
important aspect of this is to understand 
how and where we add value for our 
customers and to accentuate these 
characteristics. In this way, we aim to 
generate steady and sustainable margin 
improvements year on year. This business 
is more than capable of delivering double 
digit operating margins.
Q 
Where do you see most 
opportunities – in Chain  
or in Torque Transmission?
A 
They are both excellent 
businesses, both are global 
market leaders and both offer 
excellent opportunities. In Chain we 
operate at the leading edge of technology 
with solutions for a range of complex 
applications and environments, from 
water treatment plants to rollercoasters. 
In T orque T ransmission we manufacture a 
range of specialised products, from fluid 
couplings to worm gears and drives. We 
work closely alongside our customers and 
will often manufacture a bespoke solution 
to meet specific application needs.

our three–phase 
strategic plan
Q 
 The geographic picture this year 
seems to have been mixed. In 
which areas are you particularly 
strong or weak?
A 
We currently sell our products 
in over 100 countries worldwide, 
and our broad geographic 
portfolio effectively mitigates the impact  
of weak conditions in any one country. 
Although the global economy as a whole  
is improving, region by region the picture  
is more mixed and that can be seen in 
our performance over the year. North 
America, which comprises 38% of our 
global sales, saw good growth with 
underlying revenue up 1.5%. Australasia 
saw a decline, which reflects the 
particular dependence of the Australian 
economy on natural resources. Europe 
was broadly flat although the French 
market was more challenging and 
underlying revenue was down 12%.

Q 
How are you going to strengthen 
your balance sheet – especially 
in terms of the pension liability?
A 
This is an area of major importance 
for the Group as we aim to reduce 
the impact of the economic cycle 
on our business. We aim to ensure that our 
balance sheet is robust at all stages of the 
cycle. This involves a number of initiatives. 
Throughout the year we have worked hard 
to manage and to reduce our cost base. 
The close management of working capital 
and capital expenditure continues and net 
debt remains in line with our expectations. 
We are employing a number of different 
initiatives to reduce our pensions burden, 
including the completion this year of the 
merger of the UK defined benefit pension 
schemes. We are also looking at realising 
value from our significant tax assets.  
Our objective is to ensure that we have  
a consistent and positive cash flow  
which will be clear evidence that our 
strategy is working.
Q 
Where will future growth  
come from? 
A 
Towards the end of the coming 
year and next, we aim to move 
into the second phase of our plan, 
the Organic Growth phase. We will look 
to leverage our excellent Chain and TT 
products, to capitalise on our global market 
leadership positions, and to drive growth 
from improved sales and marketing 
practices. We have an excellent range  
of products but with greater emphasis  
on product management we will be able  
to penetrate new areas of the market. 
Further into the future, we believe there 
will be opportunities to leverage our  
own scale through acquisitions in our 
fragmented market. All our focus right 
now, though, is on building a robust and 
sustainable business which delivers steady 
improvement in shareholder value and 
provides a platform for future growth.

Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 10 How Renold generates value 
Our customers come to us with a wide range of technically 
challenging power transmission problems. In some cases the 
answer is one of our standard solution products. In other 
cases the solution requires proactive engagement with the 
customer’s engineering teams to design a bespoke solution. 
This process will include specifying the exact materials and 
any additional coatings or treatment required to deliver the 
optimal performance solution for the customer.
Our production facilities can use unique manufacturing 
techniques to turn the designs into substance. Our logistics 
teams work with customers to get the products to the right 
location at the right time. The after sales service teams 
respond proactively to any follow on customer requests 
from all three major sales channels. The business model 
cycle can often end where it began with ongoing technical 
and service support that can be provided by an innovative 
range of performance monitoring solutions.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 11
Strategic Report What we do
Renold manufactures and sells power transmission products 
and is configured as two separate operating divisions: Chain 
and Torque Transmission.
We operate Chain production facilities in seven countries, 
strategically placed to serve large or growing local markets. 
In re-engineering the Chain business, and with the appointment  
of a Chain Manufacturing Director, we are aiming to create  
an integrated production base that serves our customers 
around the globe in an efficient and effective way.
In Torque Transmission we have a number of specialised  
niche businesses that produce a range of technical products in 
both the industrial couplings and industrial gear markets. We 
manufacture in the UK, the USA, China and South Africa with 
sales and support in additional territories. Our couplings range 
includes fluid based systems, rubber-in-shear and rubber-in-
compression products. In gears, we provide a complete range 
of speciality worm and helical gears and drives.
Who we are
Renold employed an average of 2,379 people around the  
world in the last year, with 55% of our staff engaged in  
direct production activities. The divisional split of staff aligns  
closely with the split of sales with 78% of staff in Chain,  
20% in Torque Transmission and 2% in our head office.
Our global presence
Renold currently sells products in over 100 countries. The key 
regions and territories are represented on the chart opposite.
Our single biggest market is the USA which represents 33.1%  
of external Group sales. In addition, the UK, Australia, and 
Germany each represent over 5% of Group sales by destination 
with Canada, France, Switzerland, China and India also being 
major contributors. The remaining 24% of sales are spread  
over many other countries. This geographic spread reduces  
our dependence on any particular market.
We currently have a limited presence in South American 
markets which may in future represent a growth opportunity 
given our industry specific knowledge of products for sectors 
such as food and agriculture, quarrying and mining, and other 
natural resources – in addition to our wide range of high 
performance industrial chains.

Our business model
continued  The customers we serve
Our markets
Customer concentration for Renold is relatively low. Our  
biggest global customer represents less than 5% of sales. Of  
our five largest customers, three are themselves distributors  
of a wide range of industrial power transmission equipment and 
thus even this limited concentration of our sales is effectively 
sub-segmented into a huge range of end-customers.
We know from market research that these end-customers 
often ask for Renold product by name which emphasises  
that we maintain customer proximity and loyalty even  
when dealing through indirect sales channels.
The remaining customer base is split between end users  
and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Both of  
these user groups give us an opportunity to bring our  
expert knowledge including metallurgy and chemical  
coatings to bear in specifying what are often bespoke  
solutions to specific or unique issues.
The chart opposite shows the extremely diverse markets for 
the approximate 62% of our sales where we serve end users 
and OEMs directly. Distribution sales are excluded from this 
analysis as visibility of the final market is somewhat limited.
It can be clearly seen that we serve a very wide range  
of market sectors, particularly in the Chain division,  
but also in the Torque Transmission division. 
It is also clear that our products are often used in harsh and 
demanding environments where reliability and performance 
are key attributes required by customers. This requirement  
is also evident in safety critical applications. Total cost of 
ownership is a key purchasing criterion. 
Similar to our geographical penetration, we also currently 
estimate that we have relatively low levels of penetration  
in the addressable markets for the majority of our products. 
This creates opportunities for growth in those product sectors 
where we already have an established presence.

1 Significantly improving our health and  
safety performance while broadening  
all risk management activity
We firmly believe that a safe business is a well run and 
profitable business. By changing our health and safety  
culture and developing enhanced policies and processes  
we aim to ensure everyone associated with our business goes 
home each day in the same condition that they came to work.
2
 
Generating margin enhancing growth  
from our superior product capability
In the markets we serve, our products are among the 
best in the world. We are focusing on emphasising our  
value proposition in their superior performance, longevity  
and total cost of ownership to ensure that the value  
generated by these characteristics stays within the  
business and earns a return for shareholders.
As the business moves from the turnaround phase of  
our strategic plan to the organic growth phase, we will 
selectively target those sectors and geographies where our 
high performance products can earn an appropriate return.
3 Enhancing customer service By streamlining our business processes and making Renold 
easier to do business with we aim to offer a seamless route  
to market with shorter lead times and improved service levels.
4 Optimising business processes A Group wide programme is underway aimed at implementing 
standardised, efficient and seamless business processes. 
These will cover the full range of commercial, operational  
and support activities. Our ultimate aim is to significantly 
reduce our cost to serve.
5 Lowering our breakeven point The same streamlined business processes that enhance 
customer service will also reduce our installed fixed cost  
base in all of our locations. This will reduce the volatility  
of our profits in relation to changes in sales values.
6  Developing our people We are supplementing the knowledge and experience of our 
existing staff with new hires who bring different, incremental 
skills and experience to Renold. We are also developing 
training solutions to support both existing and new staff.
7 Strengthening our balance sheet  
and improving financial performance
We retain our focus on improving our working capital 
management to support business development through  
stock availability while reducing the amount of cash tied up.
We are actively working to reduce the annual cash burden 
of legacy pension liabilities though a number of different 
initiatives. We also aim to realise value from significant tax 
assets and any surplus properties. 
The overall aim of these activities combined with continuous 
improvement in operating results, is to significantly enhance 
the cash generation capability of the Group.

Future aims Risks and mitigation
1.  Significantly improving our 
health and safety 
performance
There is no simple short term solution to improving health and safety culture and performance. It requires perseverance 
and constant vigilance. During the year we implemented a new overarching framework for our approach to health and 
safety (known as ‘the Framework’). We also implemented a rolling audit programme with the recruitment of a dedicated 
and experienced health and safety auditor. 
LTAs
Reportable  
Incident Rates
Lost Time Days
Safety opportunities
Our overarching objective is to achieve zero accidents  
every year. Each site will implement a rolling programme to 
identify opportunities for safety improvements each year.
We are rolling out a training programme for all managers  
to ensure a consistent and shared base level of relevant 
skills and understanding.
In the new financial year we will also introduce a Group 
wide Health and Safety Awards programme to raise 
awareness and standards.
Organisational change increases the risk of accidents, 
particularly when the change is on a large scale and in 
production environments. The Group is mitigating this 
risk by considering in advance of any change, full risk 
assessments and new safe operating procedures.
The increased focus on audit may create a false 
impression of a worsening trend which should be  
borne in mind when assessing data.
2.  Generating margin 
enhancing growth 
from our superior 
product capability
At the current stage in our strategic plan we are not yet focused on delivering top line sales growth and hence our 
focus has been on margin enhancement through improving our efficiency and ensuring that our technical products 
achieve appropriate value in the market.
Our activities have included reviews of our product and margin mix. Through this process we have begun altering  
the mix to give ourselves a start in the trend towards higher margins.
RoS%
Adjusted EPS
ROCE%
We are aiming to deliver steady improvements in RoS % 
each year to ultimately achieve double digit operating 
margins. We are targeting steady annual gains to ensure 
they are robust and sustainable.
Our objective is to deliver double digit margins  
against a zero sales growth background. A significant  
fall in sales or a rapid appreciation in input costs could 
jeopardise this outcome if we were not able to respond 
quickly and effectively.
3.  Enhancing 
customer service
Our market research tells us that while customers value our products and technical capability, we are not always  
as easy to do business with as we should be.
Therefore, one of the key areas for improvement during the turnaround phase of the strategic plan is to change our 
business processes to deliver a faster, more efficient and seamless service proposition to our customers.
During the year we have implemented a number of new service metrics and objectives with a pilot in our European 
Chain business. These include target service levels to respond to customer queries and to reduce the lead times to 
deliver a quotation to a customer for standard or adapted chain.
Improvement in:
–  Customer contact 
response times
–  Quotation lead 
times
–  On Time Delivery 
In Full
Our aim is to show a steady and regular improvement  
in all metrics.
Excellent customer service requires efficient business 
processes and systems that deliver replicable, predictable 
and timely outcomes. As the Group is changing and 
improving many of our business processes and systems, 
this creates a risk to current service levels. This risk is 
being mitigated by a newly created Steering Committee 
with responsibility for oversight and approval of all 
business system change requests.
4.  O p timising 
business processes
Business processes have been improved in all functional areas. For example, on the commercial side, we have vastly 
increased the number of customer quotations coming directly from our systems, thereby cutting customer response 
times. In operations, as part of the Bredbury closure project, we have implemented a service cell dedicated to fast 
turnaround times on selected chain, assembled from a standard list of stocked components. 
Under development:
Each of our business 
processes will have  
its own set of KPIs
Our intention is to create one global, integrated, ERP 
system. Our cost to serve will be reduced and this work  
will also feed into the KPIs for customer service.
Changes to systems and processes may in the short 
term reduce performance as users learn new skills. If 
changes are not managed properly, the performance 
reduction and its duration can grow.
Our new Director of Business Systems is a key hire  
in mitigating this risk.
5.  Lowering our 
breakeven point
During the year we delivered a major reduction in excess Chain manufacturing capacity and overhead burden through 
the closure of our Bredbury facility. The production processes were successfully transferred to other Renold locations 
and the remaining activities are on track to complete at the end of the first quarter of the new financial year.
Elsewhere we built on overhead reductions started in the second half of the prior year with further reductions of £0.9m 
to give net, year on year, reductions in underlying overheads of £3.4m.
Total overheads As we re-engineer our business processes we aim to reduce 
the cost to serve of all of our activities. Our medium term 
goal is to deliver meaningful annual reductions in our 
overheads to support the delivery of enhanced margins  
and shareholder value.
Overhead structures tend to be inflexible and can  
be a major financial burden in a downturn. Our new 
processes are being designed with more flexibility in 
mind to reduce this risk.
6.  De v eloping  
our people
We have created a number of new key positions in the Group to emphasise and underpin our drive to manage the 
business in a more integrated way where there are benefits to be gained from sharing best practice and eliminating 
unnecessary duplication. These posts include a new Chain Manufacturing Director and a Group Business Systems 
Director. We have also refreshed our senior management team and a number of other key leadership positions have 
also seen new hires. With the senior team now in place, the pace of change and number of initiatives under 
management can be increased.
Under development Performance management processes and systems in the 
business are currently somewhat ad-hoc and inefficient.  
We aim to deliver a performance management system that 
assesses performance but that also both identifies training 
and development needs and supports delivery of them.
Change can be unsettling for all staff creating a risk  
of some staff leaving due to feelings of uncertainty.
To counter some of this we are increasing the regularity 
and content of communication to give all staff a clearer 
sense of direction.
7 .  S tr engthening  
our balance sheet
We completed the merger of the three UK defined benefit pension schemes. This has significantly reduced the ongoing 
administration costs of the schemes. At the same time, 1,316 members with small pension pots opted to have their 
entitlements paid out as lump sums which led to a reduction in scheme liabilities and assets of £10.9m and £10.4m 
respectively. Fewer members in the scheme will lead to lower overall administrative costs.
In the USA one of the three defined benefit schemes moved into a surplus following strong equity asset performance 
and the formal termination of that scheme has now commenced to allow it to be fully de-risked.
Our working capital ratio further improved to 17.7% (2013: 19.0%), equivalent to a reduction in average net debt of £2.4m 
based on current annual sales.
Annual underlying 
cost of servicing 
legacy pensions.
Ratio of working 
capital to rolling 
annual sales (WC%)
Gearing ratio
Ultimately we aim to de-risk the Group from all defined 
benefit pension liabilities. The short term focus is on 
managing down the larger exposures in the UK and 
Germany. We aim to have stable annual cash costs to 
enhance predictability. We want to optimise working capital  
to support the business while minimising the cash tied up.
Work is ongoing to identify an appropriate level of gearing 
for the Group.
Pension liabilities fluctuate with factors outside the 
Group’s control (interest rates, inflation expectations, 
longevity and returns on assets). The key is to be ready 
to de-risk when the market opportunity arises. Legislative 
changes can also lead to changes in liabilities and 
opportunities for de-risking. 
Working capital can take time to unwind and in the 
event of a sudden downturn in activity the Group  
could be left with excess stock.
To mitigate this risk we have deployed working capital 
management tools and WC % is a monthly monitored KPI.
Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 16
Our strategic progress
We have made a robust start to the turnaround phase of our three-phase strategic plan. This turnaround phase requires us  
to rebuild our foundations, to remind ourselves of the high quality and value adding products that we deliver to the market  
and to our customers, and, in some cases, create new disciplines and basic processes that had withered in the business. We are 
working to develop detailed improvement projects for all aspects of our business – whether individual geographical locations, 
production facilities or worldwide business support functions. We are challenging every aspect of what we do and how we do it 
– seeking to create a continuous improvement culture throughout Renold. Hence, we really are ‘re-engineering everything we do’ . Strategic objective Progress in 2013/14 KPIs

We are aiming to deliver steady improvements in RoS % 
each year to ultimately achieve double digit operating 
margins. We are targeting steady annual gains to ensure 
they are robust and sustainable.
Our objective is to deliver double digit margins  
against a zero sales growth background. A significant  
fall in sales or a rapid appreciation in input costs could 
jeopardise this outcome if we were not able to respond 
quickly and effectively.
3.  Enhancing 
customer service
Our market research tells us that while customers value our products and technical capability, we are not always  
as easy to do business with as we should be.
Therefore, one of the key areas for improvement during the turnaround phase of the strategic plan is to change our 
business processes to deliver a faster, more efficient and seamless service proposition to our customers.
During the year we have implemented a number of new service metrics and objectives with a pilot in our European 
Chain business. These include target service levels to respond to customer queries and to reduce the lead times to 
deliver a quotation to a customer for standard or adapted chain.
Improvement in:
–  Customer contact 
response times
–  Quotation lead 
times
–  On Time Delivery 
In Full
Our aim is to show a steady and regular improvement  
in all metrics.
Excellent customer service requires efficient business 
processes and systems that deliver replicable, predictable 
and timely outcomes. As the Group is changing and 
improving many of our business processes and systems, 
this creates a risk to current service levels. This risk is 
being mitigated by a newly created Steering Committee 
with responsibility for oversight and approval of all 
business system change requests.
4.  O p timising 
business processes
Business processes have been improved in all functional areas. For example, on the commercial side, we have vastly 
increased the number of customer quotations coming directly from our systems, thereby cutting customer response 
times. In operations, as part of the Bredbury closure project, we have implemented a service cell dedicated to fast 
turnaround times on selected chain, assembled from a standard list of stocked components. 
Under development:
Each of our business 
processes will have  
its own set of KPIs
Our intention is to create one global, integrated, ERP 
system. Our cost to serve will be reduced and this work  
will also feed into the KPIs for customer service.
Changes to systems and processes may in the short 
term reduce performance as users learn new skills. If 
changes are not managed properly, the performance 
reduction and its duration can grow.
Our new Director of Business Systems is a key hire  
in mitigating this risk.
5.  Lowering our 
breakeven point
During the year we delivered a major reduction in excess Chain manufacturing capacity and overhead burden through 
the closure of our Bredbury facility. The production processes were successfully transferred to other Renold locations 
and the remaining activities are on track to complete at the end of the first quarter of the new financial year.
Elsewhere we built on overhead reductions started in the second half of the prior year with further reductions of £0.9m 
to give net, year on year, reductions in underlying overheads of £3.4m.
Total overheads As we re-engineer our business processes we aim to reduce 
the cost to serve of all of our activities. Our medium term 
goal is to deliver meaningful annual reductions in our 
overheads to support the delivery of enhanced margins  
and shareholder value.
Overhead structures tend to be inflexible and can  
be a major financial burden in a downturn. Our new 
processes are being designed with more flexibility in 
mind to reduce this risk.
6.  De v eloping  
our people
We have created a number of new key positions in the Group to emphasise and underpin our drive to manage the 
business in a more integrated way where there are benefits to be gained from sharing best practice and eliminating 
unnecessary duplication. These posts include a new Chain Manufacturing Director and a Group Business Systems 
Director. We have also refreshed our senior management team and a number of other key leadership positions have 
also seen new hires. With the senior team now in place, the pace of change and number of initiatives under 
management can be increased.
Under development Performance management processes and systems in the 
business are currently somewhat ad-hoc and inefficient.  
We aim to deliver a performance management system that 
assesses performance but that also both identifies training 
and development needs and supports delivery of them.
Change can be unsettling for all staff creating a risk  
of some staff leaving due to feelings of uncertainty.
To counter some of this we are increasing the regularity 
and content of communication to give all staff a clearer 
sense of direction.
7 .  S tr engthening  
our balance sheet
We completed the merger of the three UK defined benefit pension schemes. This has significantly reduced the ongoing 
administration costs of the schemes. At the same time, 1,316 members with small pension pots opted to have their 
entitlements paid out as lump sums which led to a reduction in scheme liabilities and assets of £10.9m and £10.4m 
respectively. Fewer members in the scheme will lead to lower overall administrative costs.
In the USA one of the three defined benefit schemes moved into a surplus following strong equity asset performance 
and the formal termination of that scheme has now commenced to allow it to be fully de-risked.
Our working capital ratio further improved to 17.7% (2013: 19.0%), equivalent to a reduction in average net debt of £2.4m 
based on current annual sales.

Gearing ratio
Ultimately we aim to de-risk the Group from all defined 
benefit pension liabilities. The short term focus is on 
managing down the larger exposures in the UK and 
Germany. We aim to have stable annual cash costs to 
enhance predictability. We want to optimise working capital  
to support the business while minimising the cash tied up.
Work is ongoing to identify an appropriate level of gearing 
for the Group.
Pension liabilities fluctuate with factors outside the 
Group’s control (interest rates, inflation expectations, 
longevity and returns on assets). The key is to be ready 
to de-risk when the market opportunity arises. Legislative 
changes can also lead to changes in liabilities and 
opportunities for de-risking. 
Working capital can take time to unwind and in the 
event of a sudden downturn in activity the Group  
could be left with excess stock.
To mitigate this risk we have deployed working capital 
management tools and WC % is a monthly monitored KPI.

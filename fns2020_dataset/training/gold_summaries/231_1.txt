The	average	freight	income	per	
deal	was	also	higher	then	the	
previous	year	as	a	result	of	
exceptionally	high	freight	rates	
during	the	middle	part	of	2008.

A CM	is	currently	focussed	on	the	
wet	tank er	mark et.	There	is	still	a	
global	demand	for	oil	and	although	
freight	rates	are	down	on	last	year	
trading	remains	resilient.	The	world	
consumption	 of	 oil	 is	 approximately	
83.3	million	barrels	a	day	which	is	
d o w n 	 o n 	 2 0 0 8 . 	 H o w e v e r 	 t h e 	 s i t u a t i o n

Based	on	stronger	than	expected	
first	quarter	demand	A CM	has	had	
a 	 positive 	 start 	 to 	 the 	 financial 	 year; 	
the	volume	of	trades	has	held	up	
a n d 	 w e 	 a r e 	 s e e i n g 	 a n 	 i n c r e a s e d 	 l e v e l	
of	activity .	The	Group	will	always	
be	subjected	to	fluctuations	in

the	Group	continues	to	protect	its

complementary	acquisitions	and	
organic	growth	has	proven	to	be	
highly	successful	and	has	formed	
a	good	basis	for	future	growth.	
As	such,	the	Board	is	optimistic	
for	the	future	and	continues	to	
look	for	opportunities	in	the	UK

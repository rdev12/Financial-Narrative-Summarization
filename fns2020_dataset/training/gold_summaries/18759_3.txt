 ANNUAL REPORT 2014–15

This has been an extremely challenging period for the global oil and gas sector. Whilst the Indus Gas 
share price has not escaped the industry wide malaise, the Company’s fundamentals have remained 
robust and several key milestones have been achieved during the financial year under review. 
The Company’s operational and financial performance has been strong with consistent revenues and 
profits generated during the period. The Company has also successfully secured additional balance 
sheet capacity, on very attractive terms, from which to fund future production growth and infrastructure 
investment.
The approval of the Declaration of Commerciality, granted in September 2014, marked the culmination 
of over a decade of intensive exploration and planning work on the block. It paves the way for the 
integrated development of our already significant, and growing, reserves base.
In 2014, Indus released its fourth Competent Person’s Report. This delivered a 52% uplift in the Company’s 
gross 2P reserves and an 11% increase in the 2C contingent resources base compared with the last CPR 
which was published in 2012. These impressive growth rates highlight the continued successful execution 
of the Company’s appraisal and drilling programme. 
On-site exploration, appraisal and testing activity has continued at an impressive pace during the year 
with details outlined in the Chief Executive’s Review. 
The Board would like to thank employees, shareholders and all other stakeholders for their loyalty. 
Against a difficult current backdrop for global oil and gas prices, management will continue to focus on 
the execution of the Company’s long-term strategy of achieving both growth in reserves and commercial 
production. The Indian economy continues to suffer from a shortage of domestically sourced energy 
production and Indus remains well placed to help address this deficit.

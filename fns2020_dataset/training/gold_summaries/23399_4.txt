ELAND AT A GLANCE
Eland is focused on building and developing a portfolio of producing 
upstream oil and gas assets in West Africa.
In September 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of a 45% equity stake in OML 40 and listed the 
Company on AIM, part of the London Stock Exchange.
Since its foundation the Company has assembled an experienced Board and management team with extensive  
in-country experience and successful track records in acquiring and developing oil and gas interests. The Eland 
team has a particular knowledge and understanding of development within Nigeria and other locations in  
West Africa.
Elandâ€™s core assets are the OML 40 licence and the Ubima field, both onshore Nigeria. The Group acquired a 40% 
participating interest in Ubima in August 2014.

OUR ASSETS
OML 40
The OML 40 licence is situated within the Niger 
Delta, approximately 75km northwest of Warri and 
covers an area of 498km
2
.
The environment in OML 40 consists of shoreline 
and coastal mangrove swamps. The region is 
lightly populated with indigenous groups living in 
dispersed riverine communities mainly from the 
Ijaw and Itsekiri ethnic groups.
Oil production was re-started in February 2014 
from two existing wells in the Opuama field. Oil 
can be exported by two routes: (i) via the Shell-
operated Trans Escravos Pipeline network running 
from the Opuama field south along the coastline 
to the Forcados Oil Terminal, (ii) via shipping to an 
offshore FPSO.
Production was suspended in February 2016 due to 
sabotage by militants. Following the installation of 
offshore storage facilities, production resumed in 
January 2017.
The OML 40 licence area holds gross 1P reserves 
of 32.9 mmbbls, gross 2P reserves of 83.2 mmbbls, 
gross 2C contingent resources of 41.2 mmbbls and 
a best estimate of 254.5 mmbbls of gross unrisked 
prospective resources.*
A Competent Persons Report (CPR) on Opuama-1, 
Opuama-3, Opuama-7 and Gbetiokun-1 in early 
2017 resulted in a trebling of 2P reserves from these 
wells from 11 mmbbls to 33 mmbbls***.
Ubima Field
The licence area is 65km
2
, located onshore in the 
northern part of Rivers State and has been carved 
out of OML 17, which is operated by Shell Petroleum 
Development Company.
 Updated CPR for Ubima published April 2016.
 Gross 2P reserve estimate of 2.4 mmbbl of oil**
 Gross 2C resource estimates of 31.1 mmbbl of oil.** 
  Significant upside gross 3C resource estimate of  
66.0 mmbbl of oil**
 The Ubima field has 3D seismic coverage (1997) and  
four wells have been drilled in the field between the 
1960s and 1981.
 Hydrocarbons were encountered in all four wells  
in multiple stacked reservoirs.

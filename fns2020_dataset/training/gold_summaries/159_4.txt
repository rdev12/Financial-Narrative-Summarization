Where we operate
Currently, all of ABG’s mining operations 
are in Tanzania. We believe that Tanzania 
possesses significant mining potential. 
Critically, it has an established legal and 
regulatory framework for mining companies 
and a history of political stability and 
democratically elected governments.  
At present, we have four gold producing 
mines, all in north west Tanzania. These  
are Bulyanhulu, Buzwagi, Tulawaka and  
North Mara.

Exploration
Approach Priorities
At ABG, our strategy is to maintain a mix of 
projects at different stages in the exploration 
and development sequence. W e hold one of the 
largest land packages in T anzania, over highly 
prospective greenstones and around the major 
gold-mining projects in the Lake Victoria 
greenstone belt. W e are in a strong position to 
execute our strategy of increasing reserves and 
resources by focusing on exploration in and 
around our existing operations, as well as on 
early-stage exploration programmes.
Our most recent exploration focus has been 
on realising value around our existing mines, 
as well as identifying new opportunities 
in Tanzania. We believe that we are well 
positioned from our base in Tanzania to 
expand our exploration programmes into 
other parts of Africa.

Defining milestones along our journey
Over a ten-year period, ABG has become 
the largest gold producer in Tanzania, 
growing from no production in 2000 
to 700,934 attributable ounces in 2010. 
To date, we have produced 5.3 million 
attributable ounces of gold since beginning 
operations in Tanzania. We are one of 
Africa’s five largest gold producers. 
Future growth –  
where will it come from?
Greg Hawkins, CEO, explains his priorities
One of my key priorities for 2011 is to 
ensure that we continue to build our 
pipeline of growth opportunities. While 
we have a substantial platform of current 
production with a long mine life and 
attractive grade profile we are by no means 
complacent as to the importance of building

future growth. This is precisely why we have 
more than doubled our exploration budget 
for 2011 to US$55 million. This investment 
will help to advance our projects at Tulawaka, 
Golden Ridge, North Mara Underground 
and Bulyanhulu Upper East Zone, which 
between them have the potential to 
substantially boost Group production over 
the next 2-3 years. In addition, it will fund 
the next group of projects, such as the 
Nyanzaga project, which can provide 
medium-term growth while also enabling 
earlier stage generative work on our 
significant land package. At the same time, 
we continue to monitor potential  
acquisition targets and greenfield 
opportunities across Africa to further  
expand our existing asset base.

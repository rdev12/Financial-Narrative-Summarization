STRATEGIC REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
LESLIE VAN DE WALLE
I am very pleased to report that the 
Group delivered an exceptionally strong 
performance in 2014, increasing profit 
before taxation by 80% (91%*). 
Our strategy of long-term investment in the business 
across both our established businesses and 
high-growth potential, emerging recruitment 
markets has enabled us to leverage the Group’s 
operational gearing to deliver an excellent result  
for the year. 
Revenue was up 14% (19%*) to £679.6m  
(2013: £597.7m) and gross profit (net fee income) 
increased by 8% (14%*) to £215.3m (2013: £199.2m). 
Operating profit was up 68% (78%*) to £18.2m 
(2013: £10.8m) and earnings per share increased  
by 82% to 15.3p per share (2013: 8.4p per share). 
The Group has a strong balance sheet with net cash 
of £14.3m as at 31 December 2014 (31 December 
2013: £18.6m). Permanent recruitment represents 
69% (2013: 69%) of recruitment net fee income.
In line with our strategy, we have grown staff 
numbers in emerging markets and in mature 
markets where activity levels are increasing and 
additionally we have won a number of new 
Resource Solutions clients in the UK and Asia. 
Headcount at the end of the year increased by  
14% to 2,631 (2013: 2,307). 
The Board will be recommending a 13% increase  
in the final dividend to 4.35p per share which 
combined with the interim dividend of 1.65p per 
share will result in a total dividend of 6.0p per share 
(2013: 5.4p). In 2014, 1.3m shares were purchased 
at an average price of £3.11 for £4.0m through the 
Group’s long-term share buy-back programme. The 
Board is authorised to re-purchase up to 10% of the 
Group’s issued share capital and will be seeking 
approval for the renewal of this authority at the 
Annual General Meeting on 3 June 2015.
Finally, I would like to thank everyone in the Group 
for their hard work, drive, commitment and loyalty.

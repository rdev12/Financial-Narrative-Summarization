CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW
Chairman’s review
Year ended 31 December 2004
In 2004, the TripleArc Group made the transition into a major communications support services provider.  Following
the acquisition of Access Plus Plc in November 2003, the Group’s print management division was transformed into
one of the largest print management companies in the United Kingdom.  The Group’s development was further
augmented by the acquisition of Stream in December 2004.  Stream is a direct marketing fulfilment company and
has allowed the Group to expand its offering into data management and fulfilment services.
The Group has progressed significantly in 2004, with turnover increasing to £48.7m from £20.9m in 2003 and
operating profit before exceptional cost and amortisation of intangible assets increasing to £4.5m from £0.9m.
The Group continues to use its expertise in technology solutions to provide customers with industry leading print
management services.  Our proprietary technology combined with our print management company, Access Plus,
and our full-service marketing fulfilment company, Stream, form the basis for our vision of a total communications
support services solution.  In 2004, the Group won some significant contracts and made important strategic steps
towards this vision, and I expect 2005 to continue to build on this.

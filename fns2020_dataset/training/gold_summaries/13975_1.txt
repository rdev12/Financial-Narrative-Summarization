cHieF executive’S review
The past 16 months have been 
challenging for SDi Group and its 
customer base. We began the year 
with optimism as a newly formed 
Group starting the process of creating 
a coherent single brand across the 
world, utilising our existing capital and 
extensive consultancy capability to 
grow and develop the business. 
The more cohesive structure and 
new operational procedures which 
resulted from the reorganisation 
of the Group delivered a platform 
on which we have been able to 
increase collaboration and share 
best practice in order to broaden 
our offering to existing and 
new customers.
however, the challenging 
economic climate during the 
period, particularly for our retail 
based customers, resulted in a 
quickly deteriorating outlook for 
2008. Whilst we maintained our 
revenues at forecast levels during 
the period, margins were impacted 
as a result of pressures within the 
market and the Group undertaking 
several innovative projects to develop 
new solutions and customers at 
much reduced margins. Although 
we believe these projects will pay 
back in the future they further 
compounded the overall result 
for the period. 
Our market in the US deteriorated 
faster than Europe and the rapid 
change in trading environment in 
the uS meant swift actions were 
required. consequently, the 
decision was made to sell 
the US businesses and on 
22 December 2008 the Group’s 
uS subsidiaries were sold to 
a consortium led by the US 
management for total 
consideration of $6m.
We have also undertaken 
a significant cost reduction 
programme during the last 
financial period resulting in 
reduced operating costs in 
all subsidiary companies. 
We believe we have created a 
cost base for the Group which 
will allow us to compete in our 
market effectively, but still provide 
a base from which to grow as 
market conditions improve.
The acquisition of PEP in 
April 2008 continues to provide 
the Group with improved access 
to key European markets and 
leading edge products and 
solutions. The acquisition, 
as part of our stated strategy, 
allows us to continue our vision 
to grow market share organically 
by reaching out internationally 
to new countries and hence 
new customers while further 
enhancing existing solutions to 
drive distribution costs down. 
The engineering excellence 
within pEp and Germany has also 
allowed us to focus more research 
and development, engineering and 
production within this centre which 
has resulted in more standardisation 
within our solutions and will lead to 
cost reductions in time. This has 
resulted in the development during 
the period of a number of new 
products, which have given us 
a competitive advantage in a 
number of delivered solutions.

The Group’s operations in 
Germany (MSM automations) 
provide the bespoke software 
solution and maintenance 
which ensure that relationships 
with customers continue after 
installation. as well as providing 
the Group with ongoing revenue 
streams, it enables the Group to 
be well positioned for involvement 
with the future projects of these 
customers. MSM, which provides 
the software and electrical controls 
for SDi Group’s installations across 
all of Europe, has recently received 
accreditation from Microsoft as a 
“certified Gold p artner” for its 
proprietary controls software. 
Whilst some countries in which 
we operate are still experiencing 
challenging market conditions, 
others are benefiting from long 
established customer relationships 
which are leading to increasing 
levels of contract wins. This 
“hedging” of country operations 
and markets was one of the 
founding reasons to bring the SDi 
Group of companies together in 
2007 and we continue to see the 
benefits of a Group based structure 
in Europe creating the opportunity 
to work with and support a wider 
range of customers. however, 
the current economic climate 
will continue to drive customers’ 
demand across all our markets 
to reduce distribution costs and 
the business has considerable 
skill and references in this area.
We continue to see an expansion 
across the developing retail markets 
of the world. We have successfully 
completed our first projects in 
Russia and Poland. This expanding 
international market is driven by three 
principal factors: firstly, retailers are 
increasing the variety of products 
sold as well as providing a larger 
variety of sizes, specifications 
and price ranges in an attempt to 
enhance their offering in response 
to consumer demand; secondly, 
retailers are continuing to source their 
products from lower cost jurisdictions 
around the world, leading to a 
corresponding increase in logistics 
requirements; and, thirdly, the 
developing retail markets themselves 
have been experiencing a dramatic 
increase in distribution requirements 
as their local market develops with 
large stores and consolidation of 
smaller retailers.
The Group has continued to win 
projects in Europe during the period, 
with high profile customers such 
as asda George, Decathlon, TNT 
Fashion Group, M&S Mode, c oop 
and h ugo boss, and more recently 
Jack Wills, TK Maxx, Noppies, 
Wolverine and Movimoda (Guess). 
The wins have confirmed that in spite 
of difficult trading conditions globally, 
retailers are still able to recognise 
the long term cost savings that our 
systems can offer. As a result of our 
current orders in hand and pipeline of 
potential projects for the current year, 
we have a more encouraging view 
on the current financial period.
Our solutions demonstrate such 
clear cost savings with short payback 
periods that despite the challenging 
economic climate, we continue 
to see a strong pipeline of new 
business. The Group is seen as 
a market leader in apparel materials 
handling solutions, with significant 
market share and customer 
references. We have achievable 
growth strategies based upon our 
leading edge solutions and we 
look forward to the continued 
development of the business in 
the future. The business also has a 
senior team of European managers 
who are committed to growing and 
developing the business and while 
difficult trading conditions have 
prevailed over the last 16 months 
i am confident that the business 
is now structured to build upon 
opportunities for the future.

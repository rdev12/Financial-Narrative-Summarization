STRATEGIC REPORT
UNLOCKING V ALUE
2013 was an important year for Genel 
Energy. Positive political momentum in  
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq has continued  
to build, and as we move into 2014 we  
do so with the prospect of sustainable 
pipeline exports to international markets 
bringing in predictable revenues at 
international prices. As an Anglo-Turkish 
company with the leading asset position  
in the KRI, we are well positioned to 
capitalise on the solidifying relationship 
between Turkey and the KRI, providing  
a more stable operating environment –  
as evidenced by the signing of long-term 
energy supply agreements between the 
two governments. 
The landmark Turkey-KRG Energy 
Agreement confirms that natural 
resources from Kurdistan will help provide 
energy hungry Turkey with the significant 
resources required to meet its energy 
needs. Turkey will take an initial 4 bcma  
of gas from the KRI, rising to 10 bcma, and 
potentially 20 bcma by the middle of the 
next decade. Over time, our Miran and 
Bina Bawi assets are set to meet 20%  
of Turkey’s gas requirements, in turn 
unlocking value for our shareholders.
As political developments in the KRI  
help to confirm the route to long-term 
monetisation of our KRI reserves, in 
parallel we are now looking to unlock  
value from our African assets. As I write, 
exploration is under way in Morocco,  
and the Noble Paul Romano rig is set to 
begin an exciting two year exploration 
campaign with a well offshore Malta. Each 
well of the campaign has the potential to 
create material shareholder value.
BUILDING A MAJOR EXPLORATION  
AND PRODUCTION COMPANY
The growth of our business reflects the 
KRI’s rapid emergence as not just a major 
oil producing region, but also as a very 
significant gas province. The completion  
of the Miran transaction in January 2013 
gave us operatorship of the field, an asset 
which, when taken together with Bina Bawi, 
provides us with a world-class gas resource. 
As we have done in the KRI oil sector, we 
have established the leading gas resource 
position and we are now well placed to be 
at the forefront of building this into a 
major business in its own right.
Outside the KRI, we continue to construct 
a portfolio of high-impact African assets, 
with four wells set to be drilled in 2014.
As the business continues to move 
forward, we are mindful of growing our 
capabilities in line with our expansion.  
We continue to attract the highest calibre  
of personnel, and I am confident that the 
people we have in place driving Genel 
Energy forward are ideally qualified  
and skilled to help grow us into a  
major E&P force. 
GOVERNANCE AND RISK
A key part of our strategy is looking  
to make material discoveries in areas 
underexplored due to perceived political  
or technical risk. With this risk comes 
challenges, and our chosen areas of 
operation require a deep understanding  
of regional issues. We carefully monitor 
risk across all operations, working with 
regional authorities and local communities 
in order to maintain a strong reputation 
locally while giving the highest priority to 
the safety of our staff and contractors.
We have strong, independent audit  
and remuneration committees to ensure 
that we meet the highest standards of 
corporate governance. More on these, and 
the diversity of our business, is detailed in 
the Governance section of this report.
RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS
The way we do business is just as 
important as the business we do, and  
we measure our success on more than  
just the growth in our operational and 
financial key performance indicators.  
The development of positive and 
enduring relationships with the people  
and communities in the areas in which  
we operate is of key importance to  
Genel Energy. Indeed, positive regional 
relationships are vital to our ongoing 
growth as a business. In September, we 
were proud to launch our first Community 
Engagement and Investment Report.  
This is something on which we will build  
in the future.
CAPITALISING ON OUR OPPORTUNITIES 
Because of the strength of our balance 
sheet and the cash generated through our 
KRI operations, we are well positioned to 
capitalise on the potential of our current 
portfolio. We will continue to evolve our 
capital structure to reflect the future 
financial requirements of the business.
Our extensive exploration programme 
offers the potential for near-term value 
creation, with the stability of our core  
KRI operations providing a bedrock for  
this growth. These are exciting times  
for Genel Energy, and I look forward  
to updating you on your company’s 
further progress.

CHAIRMAN

 Chief executive’s review of 
the market and strategy
The market
This good performance has been achieved
against some difficult market conditions in
the latter part of the financial year. Rising
interest rates, growing inflation pressures
and an increased tax burden have begun
to reduce consumer confidence
particularly of mid-market families with
mortgages. Industry growth this year has
also been limited by poor summer weather.
This has coincided with the introduction
of the smoking ban in England and Wales,
which is accelerating the key underlying
trends in the market: the growth in casual
pub users replacing frequent regulars; the
increasing importance of food, soft drinks
and wine against the decline of beer and
machine income; the growth in pub usage
by women, families and the growing
retired population and the decline in 
male session drinking; and the growth 
in the importance of the off-trade (and
supermarkets in particular) contrasting
with the decline in the traditional on-trade
beer market.
While the uncertain consumer
environment, the smoking ban and 
the poor summer weather have each
contributed to a tightening of the 
short-term market, especially in drinks,
the long-term outlook for the value for
money eating-out market continues to 
be good with on-trade food volumes up
3% in the year, driven by long-term
lifestyle changes. Our sales strategy, the
positioning of our brands and formats 
and the quality of our pub locations have
enabled us to achieve good sales growth 
in the year and leave us competitively well
This review (‘OFR’) has been prepared 
in accordance with the Directors’ Report
Business Review requirements of the
Companies Act 1985. It also incorporates
much of the guidance set out in the
Accounting Standards Board’s Reporting
Statements on the Operating and

Chief Executive’s review 
of the market & strategy
As a result of our focus on amenity, range,
service and value, Mitchells & Butlers has
delivered another strong trading
performance with like-for-like sales growth
of 3% in the year. Sales increases have
been effectively converted into profits
growth, with further improvements in
employee productivity, purchasing gains
and effective cost controls generating an
operating profit of £343m before
exceptional items. Retail net operating
margins are broadly in line with last year
despite £8m of regulatory cost increases
and, as a result of the conversion of the
Acquired Sites, £14m of closure and pre-
opening costs. Earnings per share before
exceptional items of 35.5p for the year 
are 21.2% ahead of last year reflecting 
the strong trading performance; the
contribution from the Acquired Sites; a
significant development project completed
by Standard Commercial Property
Developments Limited (‘SCPD’); as well as
the share consolidation that accompanied
the Special Dividend earlier this year.

Mitchells & Butlers has
delivered another strong
trading performance. We
extended our leadership
of the eating-out market,
serving 107 million
meals and making
sizeable drinks market
share gains.
Our focus on amenity,

placed to make further market share gains
in a more challenging environment during
the year ahead. A number of long-term
factors reinforce our confidence:
Pub usage is becoming more 
popular although less regular
Since 1990 the proportion of adults
visiting pubs at least monthly has risen
from 59% to 72%, with a marked
acceleration in the growth of less frequent
customers since the turn of the century.
This growth in total number of users
reflects the increased popularity and
availability of eating-out in pubs, driven by
social and lifestyle changes such as the
increase in the female working population
and single households along with the
affluence and longevity of a growing
retired population. Alongside this, the
traditional pastime of visiting the local
pub several times a week solely to drink
continues to decline with the proportion
of those visiting at least three times a week
reducing by more than half to 8% of the
adult population. (Fig. 1)
The smoking ban, which now applies to
the whole of the UK, has served to
reinforce this development, broadening
pubs’ appeal to new or less frequent users
who are now more attracted to pubs,
particularly for eating-out. Evidence from
Scotland, which is now in the second year
of the smoking ban, suggests that there
are significant long-term growth
opportunities for pubs focused on driving
food sales to these less frequent users.
Eating-out is increasingly the reason 
for visiting
The eating-out market has been growing
steadily over the past 20 years at around
4% in real terms, reflecting both changing
lifestyles and the wider provision of good
value food offers. Eating-out now accounts
for approximately a third of total household
expenditure on food in the UK, but it is
only at levels achieved in the US over 30
years ago. The value for money offered by
the pub combined with its relaxed casual
dining atmosphere means that it has been
capturing an even greater share of this
wider eating-out market. (Fig. 2)
Through selective acquisitions and
disposals, Mitchells & Butlers has
repositioned its estate of pubs to focus on
large sites which afford the scale to drive
high volumes of food at very attractive
prices. The average main meal price in
Mitchells & Butlers sites is around £5.60
against a UK average of between £8 and
£9*. This value for money positioning has
helped to drive food volume growth of
67% over the last five years.
The customer appeal of pub food 
is expanding
Traditionally, eating-out in pubs and
particularly pub restaurants has been
concentrated in suburban areas amongst
predominantly middle income consumers.
This segment of the market, while still
growing, has slowed as a result of
consumer economic pressures especially in
the light of rising mortgages bills and
other cost of living increases. This, in turn,
has led to some pressure on sales for some
of our mid-market brands and formats.
Over recent years, however, the market 
for eating-out in pubs has broadened
considerably, both to more affluent
customers through the development 
of gastro-pubs and to the more densely
populated housing estates through the
dramatic growth of local pub food. 
The smoking ban has given this latter
market significant additional momentum.
For example in the period since the
introduction of the ban to the year end
same outlet food sales in our Local Pubs
were up 14% with additional increases in
associated drinks sales.
Mitchells & Butlers is developing its
formats to respond to these changing
market dynamics. In the higher affluence
areas we have expanded our Premium
Country Dining format and at the year
end we had 44 pubs operating under this
format across the country. In the more
blue collar segments our Sizzling Pub Co.
and Pub & Carvery formats offer
exceptional value: steak and chips at £3.99
or a full carvery meal at £3.50 during the
week. These formats have seen very high
increased footfall and volume growth, with
the average Pub & Carvery site now selling
over 2,900 meals per week.

Chief executive’s review of 
the market and strategy
continued
Growth in food-related drinks volume
An ever increasing proportion of drinks
sales in pubs are now associated with
ancillary purchases alongside food, rather
than solely drinking occasions. These
incremental drinks sales are biased
towards wine and soft drinks, helping to
mitigate the impact of the poor summer
this year which has led to a slow down 
in the overall market for soft drinks and
wine which fell 2%. The strength of our
food volume performance and our drinks
retailing skills has enabled us to maintain
our relative out-performance in both 
these categories making substantial market
share gains and showing positive volume
growth. This has been achieved by
attracting new customers together with 
the value for money, range and quality 
of our drinks offers.
Continued decline in on-trade beer
The same social and demographic
changes which are fuelling the growth 
in pub food are contributing to the
continued decline in the on-trade beer
market with volumes down 5% in the year.
This has also been driven by the scale of
the retail beer price increases taken by the
on-trade in general and by the widening
price gap between the on-trade and the
supermarkets. This has been particularly
evident with significant supermarket
discounting of beer around major holidays
such as Christmas and important sporting
events such as the football and rugby
World Cups.
In response to falling volumes, most of 
the on-trade has responded by consistently
raising prices ahead of general inflation.
In contrast, we have followed a policy 
of pricing restraint leading to sustained
beer market share gains, for example 
on average a pint of standard lager in 
a Mitchells & Butlers pub is now £2.12, 
36 pence cheaper than the average 
in the leased and tenanted competition.
As a result same outlet beer volumes have
grown by 6% over the past four years,
almost keeping in line with off-trade
volume, and substantially out-performing
the rest of the on-trade volume decline 
of 15%. (Fig. 3)
Although the market is yet to experience 
a winter, the English smoking ban 
is already accelerating the shift from 
on-trade to off-trade. In the first four
months following the English ban, which
was introduced on 1 July 2007, the 
on-trade has seen beer volumes decline 
by over 6%, while the off-trade has seen
volumes grow by nearly 7%.
Mitchells & Butlers strategy for growth
The results achieved this year reflect our
leadership position in the growing eating-
out market and further significant drinks
market share gains. Our average weekly
sales per pub are up 6% to £18.5k and
operating profit has increased by 11% 
to £343m. We have generated this
performance through the successful
implementation of our sales strategy,
which is to:
Lead the value for money 
casual dining market
We have continued to capitalise on the
growth in informal, value for money,
eating out with same outlet like-for-like
food volumes increasing by 6% in the year
against a pub food market up 3%. We are
now selling in total 107m meals a year.
Our total food sales, including the benefits
of the Acquired Sites, grew by 22% in the
year. This has been achieved through a
constant focus on quality and value to the
customer and we will continue to reinvest
margin into our menu offers to generate
further profitable volume growth.
The key to generating profitable food
growth is responding to customers’ 
high sensitivity to perceptions of value.
This is reflected in both high consumer
price elasticities and rising menu 
quality expectations.
Our business model is focused on
attracting incremental food volumes 
which in turn generates high margin
drinks sales. With low additional
employment costs, the gross profit
generated has a high drop through 
to operating margin.
As a result of this trading strategy, across
the estate as a whole, average weekly 
food sales rose by 12%, while the average
number of meals served grew by 15% as
the mix moved strongly towards the value
segment. Thus, although like-for-like food
prices rose 1.6%, the average retail price
of food served fell by 0.8% due to the 
shift in mix.

We believe that the smoking ban, now
implemented across the UK, will further
strengthen the growth prospects for food
sales in our pubs, by being able to attract
new customers previously deterred by
tobacco smoke. Since the smoking ban 
was implemented in England, same outlet
like-for-like food sales are up 5%.
Generate significant 
drinks market share gains
Our same outlet like-for-like drinks sales
increased by 2.2% in the period. Sales
volumes, a crucial measure of underlying
customer usage, once again strongly out-
performed the market across all the key
categories of beer, cider, wines, spirits 
and soft drinks. Crucially, our same outlet
beer and cider volumes were maintained
against the background of a 4% decline 
in the on-trade market for these products
in the year as a whole.
We are out-performing in the beer 
category through widening the product
range that we offer, improving the serve
quality through intensive cellar training
and investment in cooling systems, as well
as delivering better presentation through
attractive glassware.
Value is also playing a key part in our
strong drinks market share gains, with 
a wide gap opening between our pricing
and general on-trade pricing, thereby
protecting our volumes from the
supermarket discounting. As a result, 
the average retail price of standard lager
is now 36 pence per pint less in our pubs
than the average in leased pubs. This 
is despite our average retail drinks prices
rising by 3.4%, partly due to like-for-like
price increases, but also due to trading 
up to new, premium products. This
increase is less than the price rises across
the on-trade as a whole. As a result 
of these product initiatives and pricing
policies, on a longer-term perspective, 
we have grown our same outlet beer
volumes by 6% over the past four years,
against a 15% decline in the rest of the
on-trade.
We have been following a similar strategy
in wine, soft drinks and coffee which are
key attractions to new users of pubs. 
We have been extending our ranges with
new premium products, offering good
value own label products and enhancing
the serve quality. Wine sales volumes grew
last year by 3% with draught dispense now
in some 630 pubs. In soft drinks, we have
been successfully extending the range of
fresh juices, cordials and mineral waters.
We have also installed new branded coffee
offers in around 1,200 pubs, with an uplift
in sales volumes of 23%.

Sizzling Pub Co.
Fundamental to the
market out-performance
of SPC is the format’s
ability to attract an
increasing number of
customers into its pubs
through its great value
food offer, to make
incremental, full-price
drinks sales to these
customers. Thus its
current offer of two main
meals for £6 from 2.30pm
to 6.00pm Monday 
to Friday has seen the
number of meals sold 
in this time-slot grow to
16,000 per week over the
last two years.
Pub & Carvery
As the rise in frequent,
casual eating-out among
value-focused consumers 
has continued apace,
Mitchells & Butlers has
successfully evolved new
formats to tap into this
fast-growing area of the
market. One such format
is Pub & Carvery, trialled
over two years ago, and
now trading in 58 sites
nationally. Serving an
average of over 2,900
meals a week, the highest
we believe of any format 
in the industry, the brand
provides a traditional,
relaxed pub environment
with a freshly-cooked
carvery offer priced 
from an incredible £3.50.
For our guests, this
represents better value
than eating at home. 
The brand has average
weekly sales of almost
£30k per pub and is
providing very high
incremental returns 
on investment.
Overview 10
Chief executive’s review of 
the market and strategy
continued
In addition, we opened six new sites, and
carried out 65 conversions and 13 growth
projects to change the customer offer or
increase the trading area of the site in the
core estate. Overall, we are generating a
pre-tax incremental return of 20% on our
expansionary investment over the last two
years in the core estate.
As a result of this strategy, and in the light
of the general levels of investment in the
on-trade market as a whole, the amenity
gap between our pubs and the majority 
of pubs in the UK is widening, further
improving our overall customer value
proposition and our market share gains
relative to the rest of the on-trade.
We continue to make targeted disposals,
where the value to third parties is higher
than the trading value to us. During the
year we generated £162m of disposal
proceeds, including the sale of 102 pubs
to Trust Inns Ltd in October 2006, taking
advantage of the buoyancy in the property
market to crystallise the value of smaller
pubs, which had limited food growth
potential.
Grow profits and capture asset
appreciation to benefit shareholders
Pubs are valued as specific use assets,
primarily on the basis of their profitability
and our strong operating performance has
helped to generate further capital
appreciation within our estate. This has
been reflected in the £1.1bn upward
revaluation of the estate to £5.0bn that has
been carried out in conjunction with our
property valuers, Colliers CRE.
Our focus remains on releasing to
shareholders the benefits of this capital
appreciation. At the start of the year, in
October 2006, we returned £486m to
shareholders by means of a Special
Dividend of £1 per share, crystallising for
shareholders the continuing growth in the
value of the estate.
Mitchells & Butlers
Annual report and accounts 2007
Develop and evolve an industry-leading
portfolio of formats to drive sales growth
Our emphasis on innovation to develop
our brands and formats to keep pace 
with fast changing consumer expectations
is focused on ensuring that we continually
attract new customers and generate 
higher levels of visits. We have developed
an industry leading portfolio of brands
and formats targeted at the growth
segments of the market. Average weekly
sales per pub are well over three times 
the industry average.
For instance, during the course of the year
we have further developed our category
killer, value food formats, Sizzling Pub Co.,
Pub & Carvery and our new Community
Locals format ‘Cornerstone’.
These each offer outstanding food value,
with main meals priced between £3.50 
and £4.50, in an attractive, high amenity
pub environment. Pub & Carvery is now
generating an average of over 2,900 meals
per pub per week, the highest, we believe,
of any format in the industry. We have also
evolved our long established High Street
formats of O’Neill’s and Scream, with
strong performances resulting. Similarly
the development of our London offers of
Nicholson’s and Metro Professionals has
generated exceptional double digit food
sales growth.
Deliver a profitable, integrated 
food and drinks offer
Whilst eating out is increasingly the reason
that customers visit a Mitchells & Butlers
pub, combining higher growth, lower
margin food sales with higher margin
drinks sales is key to maximising 
overall profitability. Our aim is to add
incremental food sales which can be
delivered at low marginal cost with an
attractive drop-through to profit.
Extract volume driven efficiencies
Our rising volumes are critical in
underpinning our efficiency gains. 
This year we have seen a further strong
rate of increase in staff productivity, 
with a 3.9% increase in staff contribution
per hour in the core estate. This reflects
the impact of our training programmes, 
our focus on the optimum deployment 
of staff and ever more refined techniques
for forecasting and scheduling. These
have enabled us to realise significant
productivity gains and maintain our pub
employment cost ratio below 24% of sales
excluding the Acquired Sites, despite a
further increase of 6% in the National
Minimum Wage in October 2006.
On purchasing, the Cost of Goods’ 
index increases have seen cost rises held
to under 1%, significantly below inflation,
while £7m per annum of purchasing
synergies from the Acquired Sites were
delivered this year, ahead of our forecasts
at the time of acquisition.
We also continue to drive process
efficiencies in the infrastructure to leverage
our scale economies. For example, the
extra overhead required to service some
£200m of sales from the Acquired Sites
will have been held to £2m per annum.
These factors have enabled us to maintain
high net operating margins of 17.9%
broadly in line with last year, despite £8m
of regulatory cost increases and £14m of
closure and pre-opening costs.
Over the next 12 months we have
instigated a material rationalisation 
of the organisation, with approximately
£7m of annualised cost efficiencies
targeted to be delivered in FY 2009.
Extend the skill base of operational
excellence throughout the estate
The skills and experience of our operating
teams provide a critical competitive
advantage for us in delivering high
standards of customer service efficiently
and profitably. We have continued to 
build our staff training programmes and
industry leading practices in the areas 
of: capacity management at peak times;
kitchen processes and organisation; bar
and floor service productivity; staff
product knowledge and our responsiveness
to direct measures of feedback on guest
satisfaction. This focus on operational
excellence is central to the high average
levels of sales and profitability generated
by our pubs.
Proactively manage the 
estate to maximise value
Our strategy is to maximise the
profitability and value of each pub by
applying the breadth of our trading
formats as is most appropriate to the local
market and demographics. During the
year we have been adding value through
this strategy to both the Acquired Sites
and the existing estate. The Acquired Sites’
conversion programme remains on track
with 172 pubs now converted to our
formats. We have moved at a rapid pace
with the integration programme to turn
around their previous under-performance
and provide a platform for future growth.
Average weekly sales uplifts on the
converted sites are running at
approximately 20% above the levels at
which the pubs were acquired. We remain
confident in delivering the year three
target of 30% sales uplifts in the 2009
financial year. 11
It has also been clear that property
investors are attracted to the long-term,
secure growth prospects that can be
created through the rentalising of part of
our operational cash flows in a dedicated
property structure. Whether in a joint
venture, a REIT or another separate
property structure, fundamentally 
higher values appear to be placed on 
the estate than when it is combined in 
an integrated model with the operations.
We believe that substantial value can 
be potentially captured from our high
quality, freehold and long leasehold 
assets, through such structures. A key
consideration in such a process is to
construct a lease arrangement which
ensures that both the property and the
operations remain mutually incentivised 
to continue to create long-term value.
The Board will continue to investigate
actively the options for capturing 
the value of the property estate for
shareholders on a sustainable basis.

Cask ale training
The quality of our

market share. With the
increase in demand for
cask ales, Ember Inns
has invested this year in
specific training on the
management and serve 
of cask ale, to ensure
customers enjoy the
finest quality pint
possible. Most Ember
Inns are now certified 
by Cask Marque, an
independent accreditation
scheme to recognise
excellence in the service 
of cask ale, and each 
pub has a beer quality
champion, trained by
experienced brewers.
Acquired Sites
In July last year, we
acquired 239 of the best
pub restaurant sites in 
the UK. These freehold
pubs were well located,
large, predominantly
residential and freehold 
or long leasehold, and
approximately half
situated in the higher
growth regions of the
South East and South
West of England. They
were therefore an
excellent strategic fit 
with the Company’s
existing estate. Our key
capital investment priority
this year has been the
rapid and successful
conversion of these sites
and a total of £80m has
been invested to this end.

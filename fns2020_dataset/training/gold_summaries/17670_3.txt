Financial Reporting standards (“IFRs”).
Turnover for the year under review has 
increased by 29% to £14.7m (2007: £11.4m).
The new manufacturing facilities, which 
were fully commissioned in January 2008, 
have enabled further improvements in our 
m a n u f a c t u r i n g 	 e f fi c i e n c y , 	 t h e 	 b e n e fi t s 	 o f	
which will be more fully realised in 2009 and 
2010. This year, gross margins improved by 
1.9%, from 30.3% to 32.2% and this increase, 
together with the growth in sales, has led

In July 2008, the Finance Act 2008 enacted 
the abolition of Industrial Building Allowances 
(“IBAs”) and, as a consequence, we have

increased by 140% to 8.4p (2007: 3.5p). 
Trading
The sales growth of 29% in the year under 
review has been led primarily by the increase 
in sales of the Group’s touch sensor products, 
which have grown by almost 47% and 
constitute 58% of the Group’s total sales.
Exports	now	account	for	over	79%	of	total	
sales with the fastest area of geographical 
growth being the Far East where sales 
have doubled. The split is as follows:
  FY2008 Fy2007 
   £m £m
UK  3.0  4.1
Americas   3.3		 2.6
EMEA	(excl.	UK)	 	 	6.1	 	3.6
Asia	P acific	 	 	2.3  1.1
T otal   14.7  11.4

i n d u s t r i a l 	 g r o u p 	 o f 	 t o u c h 	 s e n s o r 	 s a l e s 	 a t 	 £ 3 . 6 m ,	
it is the area of gaming which has shown 
the	fastest	growth,	where	first	year	sales	
in this market have reached almost £1m. 
The Group has a number of projects 
awaiting approval in the areas of self‑service, 
information systems, kiosks, digital displays, 
music centres and industrial control systems 
and there is likely to be further growth in the 
gaming sector.
our Zypos product is winning most of its 
new business in the gaming, self‑service and 
information markets and sales of Zypos touch 
sensors in the year ended 30 september 2008 
have grown by 83% over the prior year. 
Cash 
The 	 cashflows 	 resulting 	 from 	 this 	 year’s 	
earnings	before	interest,	tax,	depreciation	
and amortisation (“EBITDA”) of £2.7m 
(2007: £1.5m) have enabled the Group 
to reduce the net gearing ratio to 11% 
(2007: 20%) after taking account of net cash 
b a l a n c e s 	 o f 	 £ 6 5 1 , 0 0 0 	 ( 2 0 0 7 : 	 £ 1 4 0 , 0 0 0 ) .	
T h i s 	 s i g n i fi c a n t 	 r e d u c t i o n 	 i n 	 g e a r i n g 	 h a s	
arisen 	 despite 	 additions 	 to 	 fixed 	 assets 	
of £918,000, including completing the 
investment in the new manufacturing 
facilities, which have cost £3.2m, over the 
last three years. The Directors anticipate 
only	modest	capital	expenditure	on	new	
plant and equipment will be necessary to 
further	expand	the	new	facilities’	capacity	
when required.
At 30 september 2008, the Group had cash 
balances and unused banking facilities at 
its disposal of £4.1m.
Technology
The continuing growth of ZyToUCH 
products, together with the growth of the 
newly introduced Zypos products, which 
have a lower cost base and consequently a 
lower selling price, has clearly demonstrated 
the market acceptance of Zytronic’s underlying 
projective capacitive technology.
Throughout 2008 the R&D team has 
initiated several programmes to continue 
the development and advancement of 
the electronics associated with Zytronic’s 
principal technology and also to evaluate 
new sensing materials. 
All of the programmes are still on‑going and 
will draw to their conclusions in 2009, at which 
point they will aid further reductions in the cost 
of manufacture as volumes increase.
Dividend
The Directors are pleased to recommend 
a	final	dividend	of	3.0p	per	share	payable	
on 9 March 2009 to shareholders on the 
Register of Members on 20 February 2009. 
Following a dividend of 1.0p per share paid 
on 27 June 2008, this will bring the total 
dividend for the year to 4.0p per share 
(2007: 3.0p per share).
Chairman’s statement
Top opposite: Scheidt & Bachmann has used our ZYPOS 
touch sensor in its fuel distribution systems, to take account 
of the harsh environmental circumstances and rough 
treatment to which they are subjected.
Bottom opposite: Inside a milking parlour in New Zealand, 
the touch sensor is used to control this modern set-up. 
Power-washing the equipment demonstrates its ruggedness 
and is necessary as it has been soiled by a passing cow . 3

A number of new customer programmes, 
where Zytronic’s products are on field trial 
or awaiting final approval, together with 
the strength of the order book over the 
first quarter of the new financial year, 
lead the Directors to be confident of the 
prospects of the Group going forward. 
Management
In my statement in May, in the interim results, 
I reported that Mark Cambridge had been 
appointed 	 to 	 the 	 position 	 of 	 Chief 	 Executive	
of the Group on 21 January 2008. Mark’s 
depth of knowledge of the Group and, 
in particular, our technology and the markets, 
is clearly standing him in good stead as 
evidenced by these results. The Directors 
a r e 	 c o n fi d e n t 	 t h a t 	 t h e 	 s t r o n g 	 m a n a g e m e n t	
team will continue to be very successful 
in the coming years.
Outlook
The	financial	crisis	which	is	affecting	all	
countries in the world and which, in the past 
few months, has begun to impact on the wider 
economy is clearly of serious concern to 
everyone. However, the Zytronic Group has 
unique patented technology, a wide industrial 
and geographical base of customers and 
a number of new technical development 
programmes, to be introduced in 2009, which 
will further reduce the cost base of the touch 
sensor products. These factors, combined 
with strong operating cash generation 
and a low level of gearing, are important, 
if not essential, for any sME to weather the 
d i f fi c u l t i e s 	 t h a t 	 m a y 	 b e 	 e n c o u n t e r e d 	 i n 	 2 0 0 9 .	
A number of new customer programmes,

the strength of the order book over the

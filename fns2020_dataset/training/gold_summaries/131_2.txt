The Group now has a broader operations base, a wider mix of product and
a greater depth of management. The geographical spread has also changed
radically during the past year. In 2007 the Abacus Group sales will no longer
be dominated by the UK with nearly half the business being overseas. All
these factors considerably enhance the opportunities for Abacus going forward
as well as delivering a more cost effective and higher margin business.
In these circumstances the Board has confidence for the future.

The Group’s products are sold in around 160 territories and countries all over the world. 
Roughly one-third of our business is direct to retailers – online and ‘bricks and mortar’, one-
third is through distributors and the final third through a hybrid approach in the USA, where 
we provide marketing and sales support to drive demand. We sold 700,000 products to 
end-users last year. Our suppliers are chiefly Asian and we use third-party logistics support. 
We employ around 1 70 people in the UK, USA, Germany and Hong Kong.

of Group revenue
The Focusrite division has evolved from 
selling large studio consoles 25 years ago. 
It now provides a spectrum of products, 
from recording equipment to hobbyists all 
the way to audio networking systems to 
large organisations such as NBC and 
Microsoft. The Focusrite brand has always 
meant legendary sound quality; through 
innovation we now offer the best value  
too in a wide range of segments. We’ve 
become the number one producer of  
audio interfaces in the world.
Bought by Focusrite in 2005, Novation 
now represents about a third of our 
revenue. Making new instruments  
and software for electronic music,  
the fastest-growing music creation 
segment, Novation is disrupting how 
music is made with its grid controllers, 
iOS software and new approaches to 
mobile music making.

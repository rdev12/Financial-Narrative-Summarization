> Continuing to deliver on production, 
with 70,000oz targeted in 2011
> Completion of a US$7m exploration programme 
in 2011 including 63,000m of drilling, targeting:
• Increasing oxide reserves along the twin shear
structures within the Kalsaka licence
• Exploring sulphide potential beneath the current
open pits
• Satellite deposits within the neighbouring Yako
licence, 20km to the south of the Kalsaka mine
Angovia and Mamoudouya Objectives
> Complete ground geophysics and 2,000m 
trenching programme at Mamoudouya prospect 
in Mali to define initial drill targets
> Initiate a US$3.3m exploration programme at
Angovia, including 31,000m of drilling, focused on:
• 4 identified lateritic targets suitable for processing
in the current plant
• Additional oxide targets along the structural 
trends within the Angovia licence
• Further drilling at the Kongonza deposit to test
continuity along strike
• Following up the sulphide potential beneath the
current defined oxide resources, evidenced by
292,000oz at 1.6g/t Au in measured and 
indicated sulphide resources delineated to date

2 Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation (including acquired intangibles but excluding 
amortisation of intangibles included in cost of sales) and exceptional items.
3 Exceptional items are detailed in Note 3 to the financial statements.
4 Adjusted profit after tax, which excludes the amortisation of acquired intangibles and the after tax effect of exceptional items 
from reported profit after tax, is used as the basis for calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share.
5 The constant currency comparatives have been calculated by translating the 2008 results at 2009 exchange rates. This disclosure 
has been provided as a guide to the underlying growth in the business before the effect of the change in exchange rates.

Chairman’s statement
A strong year for Renew
Results 
Record results for the year ended 
30 September 2014 demonstrate 
the Group’s continued progress as a 
leading multidisciplinary Engineering 
Services provider, supporting critical 
UK infrastructure. 
Group revenue and operating profit, prior 
to exceptional items, amortisation and 
discontinued operations were both up 
64% to £464.5m (2013: £282.7m) and 
£16.4m (2013: £10.0m) respectively. 
Group operating margin was maintained 
at 3.5% (2013: 3.5%). Earnings per share 
prior to exceptional items, amortisation 
and discontinued operations increased 
by 68% to 20.80p (2013: 12.38p) with 
basic earnings per share on continuing 
activities of 16.83p (2013: 16.62p). 
The Engineering Services business 
has seen growth across all its markets of 
Energy, Environmental and Infrastructure 
with revenue up 65% to £382.5m (2013: 
£232.4m). Engineering Services accounts 
for 82% of Group revenue. 
The largest area of growth was in our 
Rail business which experienced high 
levels of demand for emergency repair 
works following last winter’s extreme 
weather conditions alongside a Network 
Rail “enhanced spend” programme which 
together added £64.7m of non-recurring 
revenue. Our position with Network Rail 
has been recently strengthened following 
our appointment to seven Control Period 
5 Infrastructure Projects frameworks 
with an advertised value of £450m over 
the next five years. 
Engineering Services operating profit 
has seen a 54% increase to £16.3m 
(2013: £10.6m) with an operating margin 
of 4.3% (2013: 4.6%). Margin reduced 
slightly as much of the additional 
non-recurring Rail revenue referred to 
above was undertaken on a cost 
reimbursable basis with a lower margin. 
When the effect of the non-recurring Rail 
activity and acquisitions is excluded from 
our results, Engineering Services 
delivered 18% growth in revenue and 22% 
growth in operating profit.
Specialist Building is predominantly 
focused on the High Quality Residential 
market in London and the Home Counties. 
Revenue increased by 62% to £82.1m 
(2013: £50.6m) and operating profit by 
69% to £2.2m (2013: £1.3m), delivering 
an operating margin of 2.6% (2013: 2.5%). 
These results exclude those of Allenbuild 
Limited which has been treated as a 
discontinued business following its sale 
subsequent to the year end. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 3.50p per share, increasing the full year 
dividend by 39% to 5.0p (2013: 3.60p). 
The dividend will be paid on 2 March 2015 
to shareholders on the register as at 
30 January 2015. The Board continues 
to grow dividends progressively.
Order Book
The Group's contracted order book 
at 30 September 2014 stood at £439m 
(2013: £364m), a 21% increase, with the 
Engineering Services order book up 20% 
to £361m (2013: £301m). 
Acquisitions 
During the year, the Group made two 
complementary acquisitions in Clarke 
Telecom Limited, a market leader in 
wireless telecoms infrastructure delivery, 
for £17.1m and Forefront Group Ltd, 
a leading provider in the gas infrastructure 
market, for £14.8m. These strategically

important acquisitions will be accretive to 
Renew’s Engineering Services operating 
margin as we progress towards our target 
of 5% within this business segment, a key 
objective for the next financial year. 
Disposal
Subsequent to the year end, the Group 
announced the disposal of Allenbuild 
Limited, the new build affordable housing 
part of the Group’s Specialist Building 
business, to Places for People Group 
Limited ("PFP") for a total consideration 
of £2.75m payable in cash. PFP has 
acquired 50% of the issued share capital 
for £1.375m and will assume 100% 
ownership of Allenbuild after ten 
outstanding contracts, for which the 
Group retains the benefit, reach practical 
completion which is expected to be in 
about twelve months' time.
Cash
£24m of term loans were taken out to 
finance the Group’s acquisitions. At the 
year end, net debt was £16.1m (2013: net 
cash £2.8m), which represents only 0.85 
times 2014 EBITDA. 
People
The Group prides itself on providing a 
safe and rewarding working environment 
for its highly skilled directly employed 
work force. Our results and ongoing 
success are a testament to the skills, 
hard work and commitment of all of the 
Group’s employees and the Board would 
like to take this opportunity to express 
its gratitude.
Outlook
The Group enters the 2014/15 financial 
year in a strong position. In Specialist 
Building, the Group concentrates on 
the High Quality Residential market 
in London and the Home Counties. 
Our expertise is in the fit out and 
refurbishment of prestigious private 
residential projects, specialising in 
developing engineering solutions for 
major structural alterations. 
In Engineering Services, the Group has 
made excellent progress in expanding 
its position as a leading provider of 
engineering support services in the UK's 
Energy, Environmental and Infrastructure 
markets with strong organic growth 
coupled with two acquisitions into new 
markets. We operate in markets mainly 
governed by regulation that undertake 
long term programmes of essential 
non-discretionary spending to maintain 
critical infrastructure assets. The Group 
continues to focus its activities on 
these programmes which deliver good 
visibility of future opportunities, margin 
enhancement potential and sustainable 
earnings streams. 
It remains the Board's strategy to 
continue to grow its Engineering 
Services business, both organically 
and through selective acquisitions. 
The Board's ambition is to grow Group 
revenue to over £500m delivering a 
Group operating margin of over 4.5% 
within the next three years. 
The excellent organic and acquisitive 
growth achieved in the year along with its 
record order book gives the Board every 
confidence that the Group will continue 
to deliver on its strategic targets.

Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
2010 was a difficult year, characterised by performance issues with 
parts of the Cambridge business and a weak economic background 
in our principal markets. 
In 2010, revenue increased by 4%. Underlying operating profit 
was £67.3 million (FY 2009: £63.9 million), helped by contract 
settlements and consultancy income totalling £11.8 million  
( F Y 	 2 0 0 9 	 £ 8 . 0 	 m i l l i o n ) . 	 I n 	 a d d i t i o n , 	 e x c e p t i o n a l 	 i t e m s 	 t o t a l l i n g	
£112.5 million have been recorded, including an impairment 
provision against goodwill arising from the Cambridge acquisition. 
The operating cash flow of the year was similar to 2009 and the  
net cash balance of £24.8 million at the year end was slightly  
higher than at the end of 2009 (£22.1 million).
Cambridge
Cambridge was purchased at the beginning of 2009 and the results 
to date, particularly in the American workers’ compensation and  
ITO businesses, have been very disappointing. The business in India  
is performing well. The results from the Australian and the other

the future. The acquisition has been costly in terms of profitability, 
cash flow and management distraction. A plan is underway to 
resolve the major issues as quickly as possible.
Board changes
In October, Richard Houghton stood down from the Board and his 
role as Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Ken Lever was appointed 
his successor. 
On 9 February, we announced that David Andrews had decided  
t o 	 s t e p 	 d o w n 	 f r o m 	 t h e 	 B o a r d 	 a n d 	 h i s 	 r o l e 	 a s 	 C h i e f 	 E x e c u t i v e	 
Officer (CEO) with immediate effect. As David was the founder  
and successful creator of Xchanging as a business, I am delighted  
he has agreed to take on a new role as Senior Adviser to me,  
to support Xchanging’s business development initiatives.
We have begun the search for David’s successor as CEO. Whilst 
this is ongoing, Ken Lever will be acting CEO in addition to his 
r esponsibilities 	 as 	 CFO, 	 and 	 I 	 will 	 support 	 him 	 as 	 Executive 	 Chairman.
Our people
It is in difficult circumstances that we recognise the strength  
and resolve of our people, our most valuable resource. The last  
few weeks have been challenging but I am confident that our

for the company .
employees have the determination to meet these challenges  
and to put Xchanging back on the path to becoming the global 
business processor of choice.
Our customers
Xchanging’s strength is based on unrelenting attention to customer 
service. We have been reassured by the continued support of all 
of our customers and partners during 2010 and look forward to 
building on these relationships in 2011.
Liquidity
The Group’s liquidity and cash position remain sound and cash 
generation will be a primary focus in the coming year. 
Dividend
Shareholders will be disappointed by our decision not to declare a 
dividend in respect of 2010. However, we want to conserve our cash 
resources in the business for the changes we are effecting in 2011 
and to fund the growth opportunities we see. We will review this 
again at the end of the year. 
Action plan
We have developed a four-part action plan to overhaul our entire 
business, seeking value creation through regenerated profitable 
revenue growth and cash flow improvement. Where value is best 
created through disposal, we will pursue this option. The first part 
of our plan, a fundamental value assessment of our entire business, 
is complete, and we have already started taking specific action. We 
will report on progress at the half year. There will be costs associated 
with any such restructuring but we believe this will put the company 
in a better position to resume growth in 2012.
Outlook
W e 	 e x p e c t 	 2 0 1 1 	 t o 	 b e 	 a 	 y e a r 	 o f 	 t r a n s i t i o n 	 f o r 	 t h e 	 c o m p a n y . 	 W e 	 w i l l	
continue to drive the successful and profitable parts of our business, 
focusing 	 our 	 sales 	 ef forts 	 on 	 our 	 existing 	 customer 	 base 	 and 	 some	
potential new ones. I believe that the initiatives now underway will 
enable us to start rebuilding shareholder confidence and value.

proﬁtable growth during ﬁnancial year 2008.

Introduction
This has been a good year of progress and gives a ﬁrm basis for optimism about the future. 
I am pleased to announce that the management team has again met expectations and continued 
to deliver growth in proﬁt, in particular a 54% increase in EBITDA and a 46% increase in adjusted 
diluted EPS.
This year has been the most signiﬁcant in terms of strategic positioning since the formation of 
the Group. We acquired a wafer reclaim facility in Arizona, US during February of this year which 
gives us further access to a very exciting market.
We also saw the exit of our original venture capital funding partner, Apax Partners Limited (“Apax”). 
On behalf of all at Pure Wafer, I would like to thank Apax for their continued support from formation 
until the day they exited. Without Apax’s initial ﬁnancial and management support to one of the 
UK’s largest ever venture capital backed greenﬁeld start-ups, Pure Wafer would not be in the 
enviable position that we ﬁnd ourselves in today.
Shareholders may wish to note that the Group’s results have been signiﬁcantly affected by 
movements in the US Dollar. I draw your attention to the ﬁnance director’s analysis in the ﬁnancial 
review and point out that movements in the exchange rate this year have had a negative impact 
of approximately £1.4m on our pre-tax proﬁts. It is worth noting that the US acquisition will 
reduce our exposure to currency movements on new business in our largest market.

Management
We have further strengthened our Board this year by the appointment of Paul Dolan, a chartered 
accountant and formerly a partner of Deloitte, as non-executive director following the departure 
of the Apax representative, John Samuel.
Our senior management team is also beneﬁting from the wealth of experience and skills acquired 
as part of the purchase of our US facility. The senior management of the US site has many years 
experience of the semiconductor and wafer reclaim industry between them, in many key areas 
from manufacturing and process development through to sales.
I shall take this opportunity to welcome our new colleagues in Arizona and all new employees in 
Swansea, and to congratulate them on joining this successful, results driven Group.
I would like to thank the entire team across both sites, led by Keith Baker, for their hard work and 
continued delivery of results. I am conﬁdent that they will continue to strive for success and 
achievement in the current ﬁnancial year.
Outlook
The Board expects proﬁtable growth during the next ﬁnancial year as the Group exploits its strong 
position in the expanding global 300mm wafer reclaim market. The results for the ﬁrst quarter 
of ﬁnancial year 2008 are expected to be affected by technical difﬁculities slowing down the ramp 
of a new product line with a single customer. With support from the customer we have recently 
developed an improved manufacturing process that we believe will enable us to run this product 
in higher volume. 
We look to the future with conﬁdence.

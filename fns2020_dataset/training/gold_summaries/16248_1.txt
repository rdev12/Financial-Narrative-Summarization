 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
2002 WAS ANOTHER VERY DIFFICULT YEAR. SEVERE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON
TECHNOLOGY ADVERTISING AND NEWS DISTRIBUTION REVENUES IN THE US PUSHED US
PROFITS* DOWN BY 58 PER CENT. IN CONTRAST, OUR EUROPEAN AND ASIAN BUSINESSES
– CMPi, CMP ASIA, UAP AND NOP RESEARCH – DELIVERED STRONG PERFORMANCES WITH
PROFIT* OF £44.9M, AHEAD BY APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD.
Action to improve operating efficiencies throughout the group has reduced fixed costs by £180m or over 25 per cent
against the 2000 base. These improvements and our success in building market share and protecting yields have left
group profit attractively geared to an improvement in revenues.
We have steadily increased our investment in new products with over 40 launches in 2002 at a cost of £20m which,
in their first year, generated revenue of £17m.
In the second half of 2002 our US high tech business achieved some stability for the first time in two years with revenue
at 55 per cent of the peak 2000 levels. Substantial cost reductions enabled CMP Media to meet its target of an operating
profit in the fourth quarter. The news distribution business was hit by the de-listing of many US companies – there were
16 per cent fewer Nasdaq companies at the year end – and by the weak state of the financial markets. NOP World’s UK,
syndicated US media and automotive businesses all performed well in 2002 but the healthcare and ad hoc sectors suffered
a marked deterioration and traded at a loss. Action has been taken to ensure these businesses trade profitably in 2003.
CMP Asia delivered revenue growth and improved profit and launched nine new exhibitions. CMP Information’s revenue
was down, reflecting closures and tough markets, but profit nearly doubled thanks to a wide ranging cost reduction
programme. UAP improved margins and increased profit by more than one third on steady turnover. This was thanks to
a maiden profit from Auto Exchange, the free pickup auto advertising publication, after five years of investment.
Stringent financial management, with tight control of working capital and capital expenditure, has improved our
already strong balance sheet. Cash conversion of around 140 per cent produced a net cash position at the year end
of £94m. Our robust balance sheet ensures that we can continue to invest in new products and achieve global reach,
both organically and, where appropriate, by acquisition.
five (formerly Channel 5), the principal holding in our investment portfolio, made excellent progress with strong
gains in advertising and audience share.
Current Trading and Outlook as at 28 February 2003
Trading conditions continue to be tough in 2003. In the first two months of the year professional publishing revenues
are in line with recent trends. PR Newswire’s revenue continues to be adversely affected by the uncertain state of
financial markets. In the UK, NOP has made a good start and in the US our continuous research businesses are well
set to make further progress. Revenues in the healthcare and ad hoc businesses remain under pressure.
The outlook for revenue has however been clouded by growing corporate uncertainty in the face of geopolitical
concerns. Against this difficult background we will strive to manage our cost base in line with actual revenues.
In 2003 we are targeting – in the absence of a sharp decline in revenues – an improvement in the group margin from
8.2 per cent in 2002 to around 10 per cent.
Professional publishing margins should benefit from the turnaround to profit at CMP Media in the US and the benefits of
the extensive restructuring at CMPi and UAP in the UK. PR Newswire continues to take action to reduce costs in the face
of the current weakness in revenues. The strength of our continuous market research business in the US, a resilient UK
business and the actions being taken to reduce costs in the US ad hoc business should improve market research margins.
We will continue to build, and at the right time realise, the value of our investment portfolio. five is on course to make
further gains in advertising share and to break into profit in 2003.
The company intends to purchase its own shares in the market from time to time under the existing authority granted
by shareholders.
We remain firmly committed to our strategy of patiently building shareholder value through improvements in
operational performance, investment in new products and sensibly priced acquisitions and market share gains.

IRON ORE AND 
MANGANESE
9,400 employees

 • Of all the metals that 
make modern life 
possible, steel is the 
most widely used –  
and iron ore is its main 
ingredient. Steel is 
needed in many types 
of infrastructure and  
is therefore in great 
demand from emerging 
economies such as 
China and Brazil. 
 • Manganese is a vital 
component of stainless 
steel and many 
advanced alloys.

COAL 
11,600 employees
(1)
 • Metallurgical coal is  
an essential ingredient 
in blast furnace steel 
production and 
accounts for around 
70% of global steel 
output.
 • Thermal coal is the  
heat source for  
around 40% of all 
electricity generated 
globally today and is 
vital in supporting  
the development of 
emerging economies.

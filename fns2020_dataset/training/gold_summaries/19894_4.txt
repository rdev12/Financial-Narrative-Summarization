refurbishments, new builds or conversions on time 
and to budget. According to the nature of the project,

THE UNITE APPROACH
UNITE has moved rapidly to lead an exciting and
dynamic new market sector in quality , affordable 
student and key worker accommodation. We take an
integrated approach to the delivery of each scheme,
using a solid research foundation to ascertain market
– fit for our accommodation and services. Once a
development opportunity has been identified, project
management teams are responsible for delivering the
new accommodation to turnkey stage. In delivering 
the project, modular bedroom and bathroom units 
may be required within the build process. 
UNITE is the only UK company to use modular
manufacturing techniques to improve the build 
speed, quality and affordability of student and key
worker accommodation. Each unit is manufactured
under factory conditions and incorporated within the
construction programme. In tandem with activities 
to deliver the new student or key worker residence,
Accommodation Services teams drive sales, marketing,
reservations and room allocations. As a long term
operator of accommodation, UNITE continues to
provide added value to its customers through functions
such as 24-hour security monitoring, call-centre and a
range of customer services. UNITE has a dedicated and
focused team of 400 people across 5 regional offices.

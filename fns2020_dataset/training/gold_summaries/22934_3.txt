 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 02
Chairman’s Statement
Strong growth in  
shareholder value
benefited from a contribution of £2.4m 
from acquisitions completed in the year 
and £2.7m from currency effects on 
translation. Adjusted operating margins 
reduced to 17.2% (2015: 18.1%) reflecting 
a further impact on gross margins in 
the Canadian and Australian Healthcare 
businesses from transactional currency 
effects because of the weaker Canadian 
and Australian dollars. Adjusted profit 
before tax increased by 9% to £64.9m 
(2015: £59.6m) and adjusted earnings 
per share (“EPS”) increased by 10% to 
41.9p (2015: 38.2p), reflecting a slight 
decrease in the effective tax rate.
The Group again generated very strong 
free cash flow of £59.0m (2015: £40.3m) 
which included a cash inflow of £6.3m 
from reduced working capital and 
£4.6m of cash realised on the sale of 
assets. Capital expenditure reduced this 
year to £3.7m (2015: £4.3m) reflecting 
lower investment in Healthcare field 
equipment as Canadian hospitals sought 
to limit their expenditure this year. 
It was another good year for acquisition 
activity with investment of £32.7m 
(2015: £37.8m) in new businesses 
during the financial year, extending 
the Group’s activities into new 
products and geographies in line 
with our strategic objectives.
The Group’s balance sheet remains strong 
and after investing £32.7m in acquisitions 
and making distributions to shareholders 
of £21.0m (2015: £19.7m), the Group’s net 
cash funds increased by £7.6m to £10.6m 
at 30 September 2016 (2015: £3.0m). 
Dividends
The excellent free cash flow, helped 
by the cash received from the sale 
of assets this year, together with a 
positive acquisition environment, 
has led the Board to recommend an 
increase in the final dividend of 11% to 
13.8p per share (2015: 12.4p). Subject 
to shareholder approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, this dividend will be 
paid on 25 January 2017 to shareholders 
on the register at 2 December 2016.
The total dividend per share for the 
year will be 20.0p (2015: 18.2p) which 
represents a 10% increase on 2015. 
The dividend is well covered by 
adjusted EPS at 2.1 times, in line with 
the Board’s objective of targeting 
towards a two times level of cover.
The Group achieved a strong performance 
this year against a background of political 
volatility and challenging economic 
conditions in a number of our markets. 
Diploma has a long track record of 
consistent delivery and against this 
difficult market backdrop our aims and 
objectives remain unchanged. The 
Board remains focused on executing 
the Group’s established strategy which 
is designed to deliver strong, double-
digit growth in earnings and shareholder 
value over the economic cycle.
Faced with a low growth economic 
environment, the achievement of the 
Group’s objectives this year has been 
driven by its success in executing its 
acquisition strategy and bringing carefully 
selected businesses into the Group, 
financed by strong cash generation and 
supported by a robust balance sheet. 
Results
Group revenues increased in 2016 by 
15% to £382.6m (2015: £333.8m), with 
acquisitions completed during the 
year contributing £16.3m and currency 
movements boosting the revenues 
of the overseas businesses when 
translated into UK sterling by £13.8m, 
when compared with last year. After 
adjusting for the contribution from 
acquisitions completed both this year 
and last year and for currency effects on 
translation, Group revenues increased 
by 3% on an underlying basis. Steady 
underlying revenue growth of 4% in 
both the Life Sciences and Controls 
Sectors more than offset a weaker 
performance from the Seals Sector where 
underlying revenues increased by 1%.
Adjusted operating profit increased 
by 9% to £65.7m (2015: £60.3m) and 
Governance
Early in the year, we saw the retirement 
of Iain Henderson and Marie-Louise 
Clayton and the introduction of the 
Executive Management Group, which 
completed the process of developing 
and refreshing the Board. The Group is 
benefitting from the guidance and support 
of this strong and experienced team as it 
pursues the successful implementation 
of the Group’s growth strategy. 
 
Employees
The energy and commitment of our 
employees is a critical factor in the success 
of our Group. On behalf of the Board 
I wish to thank our employees for their 
commitment and hard work during this 
year. I remain confident of their ability to 
continue to respond to the new challenges 
which we will face in the coming year. 
Outlook
Diploma has a strong and resilient 
business model with a broad geographic 
spread of businesses, supported by a 
robust balance sheet and consistently 
high free cash flow. This model has 
delivered a strong result this year 
benefitting from a good contribution 
from acquisitions and boosted by a 
currency tailwind in the final quarter.
 
Despite the current macroeconomic 
uncertainty in the global environment, 
the Board remains confident that the 
Group will continue to make further 
progress in the coming year from 
a combination of steady GDP plus 
organic growth and a strong and 
successful acquisition programme.

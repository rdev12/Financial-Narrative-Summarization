CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
OVERVIEW
NEXT has had another good year.  Overall sales increased by 7.2% which was close to the top end of guidance 
we issued in March 2014.  However, it was a year of two very different halves.  NEXT Brand sales in the first half were 
exceptionally strong, up +11%, whilst the second half was relatively disappointing and up just +5%.
Growth in underlying profit before tax of £782m was up 12.5%.  This figure is flattered by 1.3% as a result of a £9m 
accounting profit on currency instruments, which is unlikely to recur in the year ahead.  Strong cash generation 
enabled us to buy back 1.4% of the shares outstanding which, along with the effect of buybacks in the previous 
year, meant that underlying Earnings Per Share (EPS) grew by 14.7%.
For much of the year the Company’s share price was above our internal buyback price limit and we were unable 
to return all surplus cash through share buybacks.  As a result, and in keeping with our stated intentions, we 
returned a further £223m to shareholders through three special dividends of 50 pence each.  Ordinary dividends 
for the full year will increase by 16.3%, to £1.50.

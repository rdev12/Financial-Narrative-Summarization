Chief Executive’s review
The 2011 underwriting year of account 
which closed at 31 December 2013 
performed well, producing a profit of 
£1,207,000, compared to a profit of 
£401,000 for the 2010 year of account 
at 31 December 2012. This represents 
a profit of 7.58% on 2011 capacity 
(Lloyd’s overall market result was 4.02%) 
compared to a profit of 2.55% for the 
2010 account which was 0.06% above 
the Lloyd’s market average result of 
2.49%. The 2012 year of account is 
estimated to outperform Lloyd’s with a 
profit of 7.51% at the mid-point estimate 
(Lloyd’s 5.61%). As you will note from the 
chart, the final result typically represents 
an improvement over the initial estimates.
Our combined ratio for 2013 was 
a creditable 83.5% on this key 
measure, our best result to date.

Chief Executive’s review continued
A complete set of published estimates is not 
available for the 2013 year of account until 
the end of May 2014, however, we have 
already received estimates accounting for 
57% of HUW’s capacity averaging a 6.1% 
mid-point profit. Hampden Agencies retains 
its forecast of a profit in the range of 2.5% 
to 7.5% for the 2013 account for Hampden 
Agencies clients on average. 
The traditional method for comparing the 
performance of competing insurance business 
is an analysis of the combined ratio, which is 
the sum of net claims and expenses divided 
by net earned premiums. The combined ratio 
of HUW’s portfolio for 2013 was a creditable 
83.5% on this key measure, our best result to 
date, with the underwriting result benefiting 
from a benign year for catastrophe losses. 
HUW strongly outperformed both the Lloyd’s 
market combined ratio of 86.8% and a peer 
group of eleven competing insurance and 
reinsurance companies whose average 
combined ratio was 93.4%.
Net tangible assets per share fell marginally 
by 4% during 2013, principally as a result 
of the four acquisitions made in the year. 
Year end net tangible assets were £6.897m 
with the balance of Lloyd’s minimum capital 
requirement in November 2013 of £11.088m 
being supplied by Letters of Credit from 
quota share reinsurance capital providers 
from which we benefit from both a fee and 
profit commission. 
Our strategic objective is to underwrite at 
Lloyd’s with superior capital efficiency, lower 
risk and higher return. Our quota share 
agreement with XL Re released over £4m 
from our Funds at Lloyd’s ("FAL") to provide 
a modest war chest and during the year we 
acquired over £5m of underwriting capacity 
for the 2014 year of account through a 
series of transactions. We continue to see 
a strengthening flow of vehicles for sale at 
attractive prices. This is partly due to the 
age profile of the investor population, some 
of whom may wish to take profits after a 
long run of favourable results combined 
with tax benefits for those that wish to 
sell as going concerns. The two charts 
show how our capacity and underwriting 
profits by year of account have grown 
through our acquisitions to date.
The quota share has also improved our  
risk/reward ratio since we retain the earnings 
for the more certain underwriting years prior 
to 2013. I am pleased to report that the 
agreement has been renewed for the 2014 
account. Increasing our scale has also 
allowed us to negotiate our fees with some 
of our advisers and while some of the terms 
have a delayed effect they will significantly 
improve results over time.

Classes of business for 2014
Helios Underwriting’s portfolio for 2014 
continues to provide a good spread of 
business across managing agents and 
classes of business with motor and 
liability providing a balance to the 
catastrophe exposed reinsurance and 
property business, as well as contributing 
through diversification to lower capital 
requirements. The two largest classes 
of business remain reinsurance and 
US dollar property insurance.
We continue to actively increase our 
exposure to higher quality syndicates and 
ended the year with approximately 75% 
of our capacity supporting syndicates 
rated either A (superior) or B (above 
average) by Hampden Agencies. HUW’s 
portfolio for 2014 continues to provide a 
good spread of business across 
managing agents and classes of 
business. 25.6% of the capacity is in the 
three syndicates rated “A” by Hampden 
Agencies, being Syndicates 386, 609 and 
2791, with Kiln Syndicate 510 being the 
largest holding at 13.6% of capacity. The 
top ten syndicates comprise 78.5% of 
the portfolio. Two new syndicates were 
joined for 2014. The chart demonstrates 
how we have steadily improved our 
focus on our core six syndicate 
holdings whilst still maintaining 
appropriate diversification.

Chief Executive’s review continued
We welcome Paul Lumbis to the management 
team. Paul joined us on a consultancy basis 
in July 2013 and has since been appointed 
as Group Chief Financial Officer. Paul’s 
financial acumen, his expertise in the world 
of corporate finance and long association 
with the insurance markets equips him 
extremely well to be of significant value 
as we continue to grow.
As we have grown we have also improved 
the infrastructure supporting the day to day 
functioning of the Company. In March this 
year we announced the appointment of 
Westhouse Securities Limited as the 
Company’s broker. We have also appointed 
a new Group Company Secretary and 
retained Haggie Partners to provide public 
relations support. Smith & Williamson 
Corporate Finance Limited continue to act 
as our nominated adviser, with Hampden 
Group continuing to provide back office 
support and Hampden Agencies acting as 
our members’ agent and Lloyd’s adviser, 
as well as providing syndicate research. 
With continued significant opportunities for 
growth ahead, we are pleased to have the 
support of a broader advisory team, all of 
whom have extensive expertise and 
experience in the Lloyd’s market.
A by-product of the worsening conditions in 
the reinsurance market is that some traditional 
reinsurance products are now once again 
available on terms acceptable to HUW. 
We will investigate whether we wish to avail 
ourselves of such opportunities with a view 
to further increasing our capital efficiency.
Our investment strategy announced last 
year remains unchanged with the majority 
of our portfolio being split roughly half in 
the CF Ruffer Total Return Fund and the 
CF Ruffer Absolute Return Fund (both 
managed by Ruffer LLP) and half in the 
Trojan Fund (managed by Troy Asset 
Management Limited). The amount invested 
has reduced significantly as a result of the 
investment in acquisitions but over the 
period the total return from the two funds 
has been 3.4% which has significantly 
beaten cash. 
The investment of these assets gives the 
shareholder the ability to obtain an investment 
return as well as a return from taking 
underwriting risk. Over many years this 
double use of assets has been one of the 
attractions of investing at Lloyd’s.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties to the 
Group’s future cash flows will arise from the 
Group’s participation in the results of Lloyd’s 
syndicates. These risks and uncertainties are 
mostly managed by the syndicate managing 
agents. The Group’s role in managing these 
risks and uncertainties, in conjunction with 
Hampden Agencies Limited, is limited to 
a selection of syndicate participations, 
monitoring the performance of the syndicates 
and the purchase of appropriate member 
level reinsurance.
With effect from the 2013 year of account, the 
Group benefits from a strategic collateralised 
quota share arrangement with XL Re for 50% 
of its business. The Group anticipates this 
being a strategic long-term relationship. 
However, the contract is annually renewable 
and the Group has a contingency plan in 
place in the event of non-renewal under 
both normal and adverse market conditions.
Further information on risk management 
is disclosed in Note 3 to the Financial 
Statements.
2013 has been a transformational year for HUW . We have 
redefined our strategy, refined our portfolio of existing 
syndicates, launched a 50% quota share with XL Re, made 
further acquisitions, implemented a new investment policy 
and strengthened the management and advisory teams. 
We look forward to the future with great enthusiasm.

Corporate, social and 
environmental responsibility
The Group aims to meet the expectations 
of its shareholders and other stakeholders 
in recognising, measuring and managing 
the impacts of its business activities. The 
majority of the Group’s business activities 
are carried out by the syndicates in which 
activities, including employment of syndicate 
staff, are the responsibility of the syndicate 
managing agents. Each managing agent 
also has responsibility for the environmental 
activities of each syndicate although, by 
their nature, syndicates do not produce 
significant environmental emissions.
For the reasons described above, the Board 
of Directors does not consider it appropriate 
to monitor or report any performance indicators 
in relation to corporate, social or 
environmental matters.
Outlook
The underwriting environment in 2014 continues to be challenging. Opportunities remain, 
however, particularly for higher quality syndicates, not least in the more effective purchase 
of better priced outward reinsurance, but also for nimble underwriting to exploit the more 
profitable niche classes for which Lloyd’s has such a well earned reputation. HUW’s 
strategy and business model is based on backing the best underwriters and syndicates 
as we seek out-performance of the average market experience. We will continue to explore 
options for making capital available for acquisitions, both through further potential quota 
share arrangements and through other capital raising alternatives.
In summary, 2013 has been a transformational year for HUW. Over the past 12 months, 
we have redefined our strategy, refined our portfolio of existing syndicates, launched a 
50% quota share with XL Re, made further acquisitions, implemented a new investment 
policy and strengthened the management and advisory teams. We look forward to the 
future with great enthusiasm.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
continued
The two major risks faced by insurers and 
reinsurers are deficient loss reserves and 
inadequate pricing, which, taken together, 
account for 43.4% of insurer impairments 
according to A M Best. The pricing cycle is 
easier to identify in real time. The reserving 
cycle is more difficult to identify in real time 
as typically reserving standards slip after a 
period of reserve releases and there is a lag 
before this is recognized. HUW approaches 
the management of portfolio risk by diversifying 
across classes of business, syndicates and 
managing agents and with the advice of 
Hampden Agencies understanding the cycle 
management and reserving strategy of each 
syndicate as well as the rate environment. 
We also assess the downside in the event of 
a major loss through monitoring the aggregate 
losses estimated by managing agents to 
realistic disaster scenarios (RDS’s). Risk is 
assessed in the context of potential return 
with catastrophe exposure being actively 
managed dependent on market conditions.
The RDS events comprise 14 compulsory 
events including a Florida hurricane, 
Californian earthquake and Japanese 
earthquake, together with six scenarios 
subject to de minimis reporting of the more 
difficult to model liability or political risk 
scenarios. The largest losses modelled for 
2014 remain $125bn for a Florida windstorm 
in both Miami Dade and Pinellas. The largest 
earthquake loss modelled remains in 
California with a $78bn industry loss for 
both Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
HUW’s largest modelled exposures net of 
reinsurance as a percentage of gross premiums 
are similar for 2014 compared with 2013. 
The largest for 2014 is the larger of Two 
Windstorm Events consisting of a North-East 
US hurricane, immediately followed by a 
South Carolina hurricane at 32.2% of gross 
premium, net of reinsurance (29.7% in 
2013). The next largest is the Gulf of Mexico 
windstorm at 30.4% net (28.9% in 2013). 
Apart from the larger of Two Windstorm 
Events all RDS exposures as a percentage 
of gross premium remain for all scenarios 
within the 30% net of reinsurance Hampden 
Agencies guidelines.

market conditions
In	2011,	EnQuest’s	average	realised	
oil	price,	net	of	hedging,	was	$107.6	
per	barrel,	up	from	$81.3	per	barrel	in	
2010.	EnQuest’s	averaged	invoiced	
oil	price	in	2011	was	$111.8	per	barrel.
Oil	prices,	although	volatile,	
nonetheless	stayed	above	$100	per	
barrel	for	most	of	2011.	This	was	due	
partly to a general tightness in the 
markets	for	crude	oil,	exacerbated	by	
increased	levels	of	producer	domestic	
consumption and by supply disruption 
from	North	Africa	and	the	Middle	East,	
in	particular	Libya	and	Iran.	Despite	the	
uncertainties in the global economy 
which	continue	today,	it	seems	clear	
that	following	the	‘Arab	Spring’,	there	
have	been	structural	increases	in	the	
level	of	social	costs	in	Middle	Eastern	
countries.	Maintaining	oil	prices	at	high	
levels	will	be	critical	if	Middle	Eastern	
countries are to meet these increased 
costs.	High	prices	have	not	stimulated	
a dramatic supply expansion and the 
Organisation	of	Petroleum	Exporting	
Countries	has	adjusted	its	price	targets.
Overview
I	am	pleased	to	report	that	EnQuest	
delivered	another	strong	performance	in	
2011.	Production	was	up	12.5%	on	2010	and	
reserves	replacement,	at	a	ratio	of	over	
400%,	was	well	ahead	of	the	targets	set	
out	at	the	time	of	EnQuest’s	IPO.	The	
operational	capabilities	of	the	EnQuest	
organisation	have	grown	significantly	
during	the	year.	EnQuest’s	basic	earnings	
per	share	were	7.6	cents	in	2011,	up	by	
90%	over	2010.	EnQuest	is	continuing	to	
deliver	on	the	plans	it	laid	out	at	the	time	
of	its	inception.

EnQuest,	along	with	the	industry,	has	
been	actively	engaged	in	working	
with	the	u K	Government	to	promote	
changes	in	the	fiscal	structure	and	
is	encouraged	by	the	u K	North	Sea	
investment	incentive	measures	recently	
announced	in	the	2012	Budget.	
Macroeconomic	concerns	have	again	
focused attention on the challenges 
companies face in accessing 
capital	to	fund	developments	and	
acquisitions.	EnQuest	is	fortunate	
to be differentiated by the strength 
of its balance sheet and its cash 
flow	and	consequently	by	the	scale	
of	the	borrowing	facilities	it	can	
secure,	as	demonstrated	by	its	
new	$900	million	credit	facility.	In	
these	difficult	markets,	EnQuest’s	
technical	skills,	operational	scale	and	
considerable	financial	strength	are	
substantial	competitive	advantages.	
t he EnQuest model
EnQuest’s	development	and	
production model is focused on 
realising the untapped potential in 
mature	assets	and	undeveloped	
oil	fields.	EnQuest	concentrates	on	
production	hubs,	on	near	field	appraisal	
and	exploration,	and	on	business	
development.	Members	of	the	Board	
and	I	have	had	considerable	experience	
of	successfully	deploying	this	model.	
Reassessing	and	developing	fields	is	
a	relatively	low	risk	way	of	steadily	
generating	shareholder	value.	Now,	two	
years	post	IPO,	we	believe	it	has	been	
successfully	established	at	EnQuest.	
Indeed	EnQuest	has	created	a	powerful	
new	force	in	integrated	development.	
This has enabled us to sanction 
the	Alma	and	Galia	development,	
EnQuest’s	fourth	hub	and	a	substantial	
contributor to our expected production 
growth.	Formal	field	development	
plan	(FDP)	approval	for	Alma/Galia	
is	anticipated	in	the	coming	weeks.
t he EnQuest Board
During	EnQuest’s	critical	early	days	
it	was	invaluable	to	have	Alexandre	
Schneiter	as	a	non-executive	director,	
given	his	knowledge	of	the	Heather/
Broom	and	Thistle/Deveron	hubs	
through	his	association	with	Lundin	
Petroleum	AB.	Alexandre	was	however	
not independent for the purposes of 
the	u K	Corporate	Governance	Code,	
and	therefore	EnQuest	undertook	
that	he	would	in	due	course	stand	
down	from	the	Board.	Alexandre	
Schneiter	will	duly	be	retiring	at	the	
Annual	General	Meeting	on	30	May	
2012.	The	Board	and	I	would	like	to	
thank Alexandre for his important 
contribution to the successful 
establishment	and	subsequent	
development	of	EnQuest.	The	Board	
plans	to	appoint	a	new	independent	
non-executive	director	in	due	course.	
In	July	2011,	I	was	delighted	to	
welcome	Clare	Spottiswoode	to	
the	Board	as	a	new	EnQuest	non-
executive	director.	Clare’s	wealth	of	
experience,	from	within	and	beyond	
the	energy	industry,	makes	her	a	
valuable	addition	to	the	Board.	
The	Board	would	like	to	thank	
EnQuest’s	employees	for	their	
continuing	commitment,	enthusiasm	
and	support.	EnQuest’s	values	are	
critical	to	our	success;	respect,	focus,	
agility,	creativity,	passion,	collaboration	
and	empowerment.	EnQuest	people	
live	and	breathe	these	values	and	this	
has	been	essential	to	the	delivery	of	the	
achievements	we	are	reporting	today.
t he updated EnQuest c ode 
of Conduct
In	2010,	EnQuest	launched	its	Code	 
of	Conduct,	setting	out	the	behaviour	
EnQuest	expects	of	its	directors,	
managers	and	employees,	of	our	
suppliers,	contractors,	agents	and	
partners.	EnQuest	is	committed	
to	complying	with	the	applicable	
legal	requirements,	to	upholding	
the highest ethical standards and 
to	acting	with	complete	integrity	at	
all	times.	In	2011,	EnQuest	launched	
an	updated	version	of	the	Code	of	
Conduct.	While	the	majority	of	the	
existing	code	remains	in	place,	we	have	
augmented	the	sections	dealing	with	
business	ethics,	in	particular	those	
impacted	by	the	u K	Bribery	Act,	these	
include sections on business gifts and 
entertainment,	as	well	as	facilitation	
payments	and	how	EnQuest	must	
deal	with	partners	and	suppliers.	The	
integrity	of	EnQuest’s	employees	and	
everyone	we	work	with	underpins	
our	future	progress	and	success.
Delivering sustainable growth
2011	was	an	important	year	for	
EnQuest,	one	of	both	consolidation	
and	growth,	bedding	in	and	developing	
the	organisation	we	launched	in	2010	
and putting in place the people and 
structures to execute our long term 
growth	plans.	EnQuest’s	focus	on	
hubs	delivered	strong	production	
growth,	as	well	as	the	sanction	of	
Alma	and	Galia.	We	had	an	active	
business	development	programme	and	
consolidated	our	positions	in	Broom,	
Crawford	and	Porter	and	we	also	
farmed	in	to	the	Kildrummy	discovery.	
The	strong	2011	reserves	and	resources	
performance has already been 
materially	augmented	in	2012,	with	the	
acquisition	of	a	45%	stake	in	the	Kraken	
discovery.	The	macro	environment	
has	thrown	up	challenges,	but	also	
opportunities,	and	the	EnQuest	team	
has	been	able	to	respond	quickly	and	
effectively.	The	EnQuest	Board	remains	
as	excited	and	confident	as	ever	of	
EnQuest’s	very	considerable	potential.

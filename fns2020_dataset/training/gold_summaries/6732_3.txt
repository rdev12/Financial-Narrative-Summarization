 Your Company is recovering from a very difﬁcult twenty four months. We have successfully moved
virtually all support operations to Mumbai in India, reorganised the sales units in Europe and
America and intend soon to be selling products in India.
Your executive team has signiﬁcantly improved cashﬂow with the result that we have reduced our
borrowings by £8.2 million.
Despite the fact that operating proﬁts have fallen, current trading is as expected.
Under the leadership of Ajit Patel the Company is moving towards a focused style of
entrepreneurial business units that is already bringing beneﬁts to shareholders. On your behalf 
I would like to thank directors, executives and all our staff for their hard and effective work over
the last year. 
Russell Race who has served you as an independent director since July 1998 is retiring from the
board at the AGM as his other business responsibilities have increased. We are actively recruiting
a new Independent Director to ﬁll this vacancy.
Full details of the Company’s activities are contained in the Chief Executive’s review and the
Finance Director’s report and I hope you will be pleased that your Board feel conﬁdent in
recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 2.5 pence which, with the 1 pence already paid, represents an
increase of 21% over the previous year.
Finally, you will be pleased to know that your company has donated surplus drugs, worth 
over £200,000, to the Bulgarian Red Cross and, for Jordan and surrounding territories, to the
Jordanian Red Crescent for immediate distribution to families in these countries.

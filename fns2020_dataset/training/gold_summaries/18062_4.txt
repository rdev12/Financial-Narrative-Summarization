SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION
With our low cost, dependable copper production from the 
Kounrad SX-EW plant in Kazakhstan, we are well positioned 
to continue returning cash to shareholders, progress our 
Copper Bay technical studies and maintain our business 
development activities.
What we do
CAML is a copper producer with a solvent extraction electro-winning 
(“SX-EW”) production plant in Kazakhstan. We have operated this plant for 
four years and guidance for 2016 is for copper cathode production of  
13,000 to 14,000 tonnes. We have invested in Copper Bay, and now have a 
75% interest which is advancing its project in Chile through  
technical studies. 
Kounrad – Kazakhstan 
CAML owns 100% of the Kounrad SX-EW copper recovery plant at the 
Kounrad mine site in Kazakhstan. This facility recovers copper from dumps 
that originated from the open-pit copper mine, and is located near the city 
of Balkhash in central Kazakhstan. 
The JORC compliant resources at Kounrad are estimated to be in excess of 
600,000 tonnes of contained copper, of which 27% are situated in the 
eastern dump area and the remaining 73% are situated in the western dump 
area. In total, it is estimated that over 250,000 tonnes of copper is 
recoverable over the life of the operation of which 40,302 tonnes has been 
recovered to the end of December 2015. 
Since the commencement of leaching operations in April 2012, the focus of 
activity has been on the eastern dump area. The Stage 2 Expansion, which is 
currently underway, will extend the life of the mine to 2034 as it will enable 
the resource from the western dumps to be leached and processed. 
The SX-EW processing plant produces copper cathode, and the metal is 
delivered from the Kounrad site by rail and sea to the end customers, 
predominantly in Turkey.
Copper Bay – Chile
Copper Bay is a private company in which CAML has a 75% interest and 
owns 100% of the project at Chañaral Bay, in the Atacama region of Chile, 
some 1,000km north of Santiago. The total estimated mineral resources are 
124,000 tonnes of contained copper. 
Between 1938 and 1975 the Potrerillos and later the El Salvador copper 
mines, disposed of tailings from their respective mineral processing 
operations into the Rio Salado which outflows into Chañaral Bay. Over that 
period, it is believed that some 250Mt of tailings were discharged into the 
bay. These tailings now sit in the bay and on the beach at Chañaral, covering 
an area of 13km

. 
On 30 June 2015, CAML exercised its right to invest a further $3 million to 
increase its shareholding in Copper Bay from 50% to 75% following the 
completion of the Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”). The PFS examined the 
viability of reclaiming and processing the copper tailings to produce copper 
cathode and copper concentrate. The Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) is 
underway and should be concluded in Q4 2016.

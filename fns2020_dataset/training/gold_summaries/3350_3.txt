 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 05
OUR BUSINESSES
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present an excellent set of results for 2008.
Adjusted earnings per share, our principal measure of 
the Company’s performance, were 99.2 pence per share 
(the comparable figure for 2007 was 84.7 pence), an increase 
of 17.1 per cent. 
After three quarters of rapid growth in generally favourable
economic conditions, the fourth quarter of the year saw
economic activity severely constrained by worldwide shortages
of credit. ESAB responded by taking steps to bring its capacity
into line with the expected lower levels of demand. Howden,
with its strong order book and exposure to the energy industry,
has so far been less affected by the economic conditions 
and has continued to operate at high levels of activity. The
managements of both businesses remain vigilant and ready 
to take further action should trading conditions deteriorate. 
In 2008, Charter generated sales of £1,887.0 million (the
comparable figure for 2007 was £1,451.1 million), an increase 
of 30.0 per cent, and operating profit of £201.0 million (2007:
£173.3 million), an increase of 16.0 per cent. Adjusted profit
before tax was £212.5 million (2007: £181.1 million), an increase
of 17.3 per cent, and profit attributable to equity shareholders
was £150.2 million (2007: £137.8 million), an increase of 
9.0 per cent. 
During the year the balance sheet was further strengthened 
and the continued focus on cash generation resulted in Charter
finishing the year with a net cash balance of £51.8 million. 
New holding company 
On 22 October 2008, Charter International plc, a company
registered in Jersey and headquartered and resident in Ireland,
became the new holding company of the Charter group 
of companies. As part of these arrangements, shareholders 
in Charter plc exchanged their shareholdings for equivalent
shareholdings in Charter International plc. 
The Company has adopted corporate governance and investor
protection measures broadly equivalent to those adopted 
by Charter plc prior to 22 October 2008. As it is registered in
Jersey, the Company is subject to the City Code on Takeovers
and Mergers. 
Dividend
The Directors intend to declare a final dividend in respect of
2008 of 14 pence per share, resulting in a total dividend for the
year of 21 pence, which compares to the 12 pence paid during
2007. Subject to being declared by the Directors immediately
prior to the Annual General Meeting of the Company, to be 
held on 29 April 2009, the dividend will be paid on 5 May 2009
to holders of ordinary shares registered on 14 April 2009.
Charter recommenced the payment of dividends to shareholders
with a final dividend in respect of 2007. The Board recognises
the importance which shareholders attach to the payment of a
dividend and will look to maintain a progressive dividend policy
subject to the overall performance of the Company and general
economic and financial conditions in the principal markets 
in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate.
Concluding comments
The Board’s aim is to create long-term value and it continues 
to believe that the most important determinant of this over the
medium-term is adjusted earnings per share which it will look 
to maximise and will seek to ensure that this is underpinned by
continued generation of cash from the Company’s operations. 
The Board remains confident that the Company is well placed
for the future and that, despite the current economic slowdown,
the long-term prospects for future growth in both businesses 
are strong, underpinned by positive long-term dynamics in the
key sectors which they supply.

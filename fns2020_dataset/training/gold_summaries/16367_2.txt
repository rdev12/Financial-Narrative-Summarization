*Note on adjusted figures
Umeco uses adjusted figures as key performance indicators. Adjusted figures are stated before the results of discontinued operations, 
amortisation and impairment charges relating to intangible assets, significant items, the revaluation of financial instruments based on their 
market values and associated tax effects. The differences between the total and adjusted measures of operating profit, profit before tax and 
profit attributable to owners of the Company are reconciled in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The narrative contained in the 
Business Review is based on the adjusted measures of operating profit, profit before tax and earnings per share. These provide a more 
consistent measure of operating performance.

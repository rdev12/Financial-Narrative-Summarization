 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report that Hellenic Carriers has delivered strong and
healthyresultsfor2010despitethechallengingmarketconditionsof
the dry bulk sector.
The volatility and uncertainty in the global ﬁnancial markets, and the
shipping market in particular, was a signiﬁcant factor during the
reporting period. Yet, as a result of implementing a prudent and
proactive business strategy, Hellenic has been able to strengthen the
Company’s trading performance and cash reserves by restructuring
existing time charter agreements and taking advantage of short term
opportunitiesthataroseduringtheyear.Despitethemarketdownturn
thatoccurredattheendof2008anditssequentialeﬀectsinto2009,
togetherwiththecontinuedvolatilitytheglobalmarketshavefacedin
2010, Hellenic is pleased to report that the Company has continued
with its dividend payments each year.
During2010theCompany’sﬂeetrenewalandexpansionprogramwas
initiated to improve long term growth and proﬁtability with the sale of
oneolderPanamaxvesselatfavourableterms,andtheplacingoforders
fortheconstructionoftwonewbuildingKamsarmaxvessels.Hellenic’s
operational ﬂeet now comprises of three Panamaxes, one Supramax
and one Handymax, a diversiﬁed ﬂeet which oﬀers wider employment
opportunities. The Company’s expansion in the Kamsarmax sector will
not only grow the ﬂeet with larger vessels and reduce the weighted
average age, but will also enhance our versatility as these vessel sizes
have shown high resilience, strong returns and employment ﬂexibility.
Looking forward, Hellenic Carriers is in a strong ﬁnancial condition to
take advantage of the opportunities in this testing market to further
grow the ﬂeet through selective acquisitions that will maximize the
long term value for our shareholders. With an eﬃciently run ﬂeet and
experienced management, Hellenic is well positioned to face the
market challenges of the coming year.

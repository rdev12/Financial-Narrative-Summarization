 The financial results for the year ended 30 September 2006
demonstrate a continued strengthening of Cobra’s
competitive position. Turnover grew by 31% to a record
£10.1m (2005: £7.7m) and the Group made a profit before tax
of £0.2m (2005: £0.4m loss), generating £1.2m operating cash
(2005: £0.6m).  Cash at bank (including short term deposits) at
the year end stood at £3.2m (30 September 2005: £3.0m). The
contracted forward order book for the financial year 2007
currently stands at £6.0m (10 January 2006: £5.0m). 
North America continues to dominate with £8.7m or 85% of
turnover (2005: £6.1m) and this increase reflects both the
buoyancy of investment into the biotechnology sector in the
region, and the ability of our business development team to
successfully promote Cobra’s range of protein, virus and DNA
manufacturing services.  
Process development skills in protein particularly resulted in a
doubling of turnover relating to that product segment over
the previous year to £6.7m (2005: £3.2m), including the
completion of our first Phase III clinical programme. This
offset somewhat a lower demand for DNA, which fell by 27%
to £1.0m (2005: £1.4m).
Despite the phasing of demand for virus based manufacturing
services in 2006 to £1.9m (2005: £2.8m), the forward order
book for this product segment shows good growth potential,
with Cobra recognised as an expert in this scientifically
challenging field.  Accordingly, further investment in people
and facilities is planned at our Oxford Facility to enable all
three suites to be operating during 2007.  In order to broaden
our virus service offering we have also entered into an
agreement with an internationally recognised provider of ‘fill
and finish’ services to the biopharmaceutical industry. A
dedicated virus ‘fill and finish’ suite will be constructed and
made available to Cobra so that we can provide a seamless
service from pre-clinical through to final clinical trial dosage
form. This facility will be operational during 2007 with
customer contracts already under discussion. We will continue
to examine other ways of providing specialised services for
our customers and also stand ready to acquire additional
manufacturing capacity, subject always to confirmed demand
from our customers.
During the year we have continued to support internal
research and development initiatives to add value to our
service offering and we have filed a number of patents and
acquired certain patents to compliment existing intellectual
property.  This is a knowledge-based business and we seek to
be at the forefront of process development science to
enhance our competitive position.
In September 2006 David Bloxham retired as a Non-Executive
Director. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank him for
his four year service; his commitment and enthusiasm for
what we are seeking to achieve has been invaluable during
these early years in the Group’s development. David Oxlade
joined as a Non-Executive Director in July 2006.  David has
worked in the biotechnology, diagnostic and therapeutic
healthcare industry for over 30 years, with CEO appointments
in the UK, Asia and North America. David’s experience will be
applied to the challenges that we face in the global market
place and I am delighted to welcome him to the Board.
Cobra’s return to profitability is a significant milestone.  We
are a Group with a broad service offering across all
biopharmaceuticals, a strong North American business
development capability and active research and development
programmes into new processes and techniques to support
our customers in developing effective products. Further
expansion will be predicated on customer demand, and given
the forward order book, continued growth in sales and
profitability should support our ambition to be a leading
provider of biomanufacturing services to the global market
place.

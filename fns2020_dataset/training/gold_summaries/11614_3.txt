 2 OsmetechAnnualReport 2005
Chairman’s statement
Osmetech has continued to make significant progress with its strategy to developa diagnostics
business in the fast growing near patient testing market serving small to medium sized hospitals.
The two recent acquisitions ofOFEX-listedMolecular Sensing plcandClinicalMicroSensors,Inc
(“CMS”) fromMotorola,Inc. havecreateda strongand unrivalled product combination. OPTI
GENE will target simple test applications suchas sexually transmitted diseases, where thereis
oftena demand for fast results. TheCMS eSensor™ product is suitable for morecomplex tests,
suchas CysticFibrosis, where theanalysis of multiple gene targets is required. As theHuman
GenomeProject continues to provide the genetic information necessary for new tests, these
products createa strategically strong position for Osmetech in the fast growing market segment of
genetic diagnostics.
TheOPTIbusiness has again performed well in the year. It provides us withan excellent platform
from which wecan develop new product opportunities within theGroup. This proven operational
infrastructure willbe very valuable in the process ofbringing theOPTIGENEand eSensor™
products through to market. Weanticipatebeingable to successfully leverage our skills in
instrument manufacturingas wellas benefiting from our strong international distribution network
that currently sell toa similar customer base of small to medium sized hospitals.
Iam delighted to welcomeBruceHuebner andGeoffMcKinley to the management team,both of
whom haveconsiderable experience in the field of genetic diagnostics. Bruce joins theGroupas
President ofCMS. He was previously ChiefOperatingOfficer ofGen-ProbeandPresident and
ChiefOperatingOfficer ofNanogen, two major internationalcompanies in the genetics and
infectious diseases markets. Bruce has a strongSales andMarketingbackgroundand oversaw
Gen-Probe througha period of growthandcommercial success in the diagnostics industry. Geoff
McKinley is responsible for our OPTIGENEbusiness. He was previously Sr. Director Business
Development bioMérieux NA with responsibility for new technologies for this globalMolecular
biology business, successfully in-licensing technology fromGen-ProbeandAffymetrix 
InJuly 2005,Osmetech raised £10.2 million net of expenses by way ofa placing of new shares in
order to provide workingcapital for theGroup througha very exciting stage in our development.
We recognise the support andcommitment of many of our long term shareholders and had
originally proposed to provideall existing shareholders with the opportunity to participate in the
fundraising throughan offer of shares ona pre-emptivebasis. However, particularly in view of the
new EuropeanProspectus Directive that became effective inJulyand the increased timeandcost
that would havebeen involved in preparing suchan offer, we reluctantly concluded that to
proceed on this basis would not be in thebest interests of theCompany. 
At the forthcomingAnnualGeneralMeeting tobe held on 30 September 2005,a resolution willbe
proposed toconsolidate every 10 ordinary shares of 0.01p each into 1 ordinary share of 0.10p each.
Weexpect to launchboth theOPTIGENEand eSensor™ products in thecoming months and with
Osmetech underpinnedby the strength of theOPTIbusiness,Ibelieve that weare very well
placed tobuilda successfuland fast growing international diagnostics business.

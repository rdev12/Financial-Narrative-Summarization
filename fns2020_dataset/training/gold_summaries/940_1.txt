The year ended 30 April 2006 has been 
a year of expansion for ANGLE. We 
ended the year with a strengthened IP 
pipeline, a larger and more valuable 
portfolio of Progeny
®
 companies, a 
stronger institutional shareholder base 
and increased cash resources.
REsUlts FOR th E yEa R End Ed  
30 aPR il 2006 
During the year ended 30 April 2006, 
ANGLE made a loss before tax of  
£2.7 million (2005: £2.9 million). This 
comprised a substantially reduced loss 
before controlled investments and tax 
of £0.5 million (2005: £2.7 million) and 
expenditure on controlled investments 
(where relevant costs are charged to the 
income statement), increased by nine 
times to £2.2 million (2005: £0.25 million).
As the ventures programme was 
expanded, net operating costs to 
establish, develop and create value in 
Progeny
®
 companies increased by 52% 
to £2.4 million (2005: £1.6 million). 
The change in fair value of investments 
comprises gains and losses as follows:
The largest fair value gain was achieved 
on the successful flotation of Progeny
®
 
company Provexis in June 2005. Overall 
the value of Progeny
®
 companies 
(excluding controlled investments) 
increased by £3.2 million, a 95% increase, 
to £6.5 million (2005: £3.3 million).
cO ns Ulting and Manag EMEnt
Following the deferment of business 
and planned investment in expansion  
in the first half, the Consulting and 
Management business returned  
to profitability in the second half  
as planned.
The Consulting and Management 
business is designed to deliver key 
benefits to the Ventures business 
including access through consulting 
relationships to IP opportunities,  
market credibility with IP owners,  
and a strong management resource  
for commercialisation activities.

Institute (Europe’s leading nutrition 
research institute) and British Telecom. 
In 2005, ANGLE added to its IP pipeline 
by signing a collaborative deal with  
Ben Franklin Technology Partners of 
Southeastern Pennsylvania. The terms  
of this agreement made ANGLE the 
preferred commercialisation partner for 
technologies from universities, colleges 
and related institutions in the region, 
which attracts more than $1 billion of 
research funding per annum. 
In a major strategic development  
during the year, ANGLE developed  
and launched its own Progeny
®
 
Partnership programme for long term 
partnership agreements with major 
research establishments. 
The first such partnership signed in July 
2006, following collaboration during the 
year, is a 20 year exclusive agreement 
with The University of Reading. Reflecting 
the value enhancing potential of 
ANGLE’s proprietary Progeny
®
 process, 
ANGLE has secured market leading 
terms for commercialisation as follows:
The exclusive right of first refusal  
to invest in all University IP that is 
commercialised. Where ANGLE 
exercises this right, it will invest under 
a set formula obtaining an equity 
stake of 60% in each Progeny
®
 
‡
company for an investment of up  
to £0.5 million. ANGLE will drive 
development of these businesses 
utilising its proprietary Progeny
®
 
process and expects to invest at  
least £3.0 million over the first five 
years of the agreement.
A 15% share in all commercial returns 
from University IP , both licensing  
and spin-out, in which ANGLE does 
not invest. ANGLE will provide 
consultancy support to the University 
on IP commercialisation. 
The Progeny
®
 Partnership programme 
provides a complete system and  
legal framework for turnkey venture 
establishment with the IP partner.  
We believe it combines the benefits  
of existing investment models with  
a unique approach to addressing  
the fundamental management issue 
which limits the ability of IP owners  
to achieve commercialisation.
Progeny
®
 Partnerships has been well 
received by other major universities and 
we are in active discussions to establish 
long term Progeny
®
 Partnerships with 
other universities.

During the year, Consulting and 
Management activities delivered 
revenue of £4.0 million, which was 
maintained from 2005, itself a record 
year. Business in Qatar is developing 
particularly well, where the follow-on 
contract worth in excess of £6.0 million 
over three years is now established.  
This revenue is a major contributor to 
the whole Group’s infrastructure costs 
enabling ANGLE’s Ventures activities to 
be undertaken more cost effectively.
The Consulting and Management 
business also provides a route into new 
markets. Progeny
®
 companies are now 
being developed in the United States 
following six years of Consulting and 
Management development there.

During the year, ANGLE increased its 
expenditure on controlled investments 
to £2.2 million (2005: £0.25 million). 
Controlled investments are Progeny
®
 
companies where the Group has control, 
typically through owning more than 50% 
of the equity. 
At the beginning of the year, ANGLE 
had a portfolio of eight Progeny
®
 
companies. During the year ended  
30 April 2006, ANGLE founded three 
new companies taking the total 
portfolio to eleven companies. The 
movement in the number of Progeny
®
 
companies is set out below:
At 30 April 2006, ANGLE’s quoted 
investments were valued at £4.9 million 
(2005: £0.8 million).
At 30 April 2006, ANGLE had nine 
unquoted investments. Of these seven 
were controlled investments and two 
non-controlled. Non-controlled 
investments are recorded on the 
balance sheet at fair value of £1.6 million 
(2005: £2.5 million). 
The controlled investments are 
consolidated and their value is not 
shown on the balance sheet. At 30 April 
2006, ANGLE’s cumulative expenditure 
on these controlled investments was 
£2.5 million (2005: £0.25 million). 
During the year, our portfolio of 
Progeny
®
 companies achieved key 
commercial milestones. As a result,  
the portfolio has made progress 
towards major cash realisation 
opportunities. Notable successes 
during the year were the:
launch of its software testing product 
and initial sales by Aberro; 
launch of rapid MRSA test and initial 
sales by Acolyte Biomedica;
development of computer games 
graphics product by Geomerics; 
establishment of clinical trials for its  
in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) product by 
Novocellus;
launch of product and initial sales to 
beta sites by Synature; 
flotation of Provexis followed by the 
launch of heart-health juice drink  
Sirco
®
 in Tesco and Waitrose, US  
patent granted, Heart UK product 
endorsement, GRAS (Generally 
Recognised as Safe) status achieved in 
the US, collaboration agreement for 
Crohn’s disease.
In addition, work was completed  
to establish three new Progeny
®
 
companies, broadening and 
strengthening the portfolio as follows:
 InnoMatica: developing products for 
the US$1.2 billion per annum global 
market for percussive power tools

reducing operator exposure to

Parsortix: developing products for  
the US$0.6 billion per annum global 
market for prenatal diagnostics 
allowing the separation of foetal  
cells from maternal blood eliminating 
the need for maternal invasive 
procedures such as amniocentesis. 
The technology, developed in private 
laboratories in both the US and 
Europe, is also applicable to bone 
marrow transplant procedures used 
for the treatment of cancer. 
None of the value of these companies is

At the year end, ANGLE had 
strengthened its cash position to  
£8.2 million (2005: £5.5 million). 
Planned expenditure on development 
of the Progeny
®
 companies portfolio 
was more than offset by a placing in 
March 2006 raising £8.1 million of 
additional funds (gross). We were 
delighted with the strong support  
from existing institutional shareholders 
and the quality of the additional 
institutional places. This strengthening 
of the shareholder base will support 
the Group’s growth plans to develop 
the existing Progeny
®
 company 
portfolio and exploit opportunities 
from the pipeline. 
In addition to cash balances, ANGLE 
held quoted investments valued  
at £4.9 million at the year end 
(2005: £0.8 million).
ANGLE’s integrated business model 
benefits from consulting revenues which 
cover a substantial proportion of the 
Group’s overhead as well as providing 
key strategic and operational benefits. 
OUtl OOk FOR th E yEa R Ending  
30 aPR il 2007
The Consulting and Management  
sold order book remains strong at 
£7.8 million (2005: £9.0 million) but lower 
due to delivery of significant contracts 
won in earlier years. Over the next year, 
we are looking forward to returning  
to higher levels of profitability in the 
Consulting and Management business, 
although the Ventures business will 
remain the primary focus.
We expect strong developments in the 
Progeny
®
 company portfolio during the 
year as the existing Progeny
®
 companies 
mature and new Progeny
®
 companies 
are founded. In particular we are looking 
forward to working with The University 
of Reading to deliver some high growth 
Progeny
®
 companies based on their IP .
A major emphasis will be placed on 
building substantial value in our IP 
pipeline through the measured roll-out 
of our Progeny
®
 Partnership programme 
securing long term partnerships with 
further top-rated institutions. 
Overall, we expect another year of 
continuing growth.

 2 Chairman’s Statement
Senior, like many other industrial groups, endured difficult
conditions throughout 2003.The Iraq war and the SARS outbreak
early in the year adversely impacted business confidence and
extinguished any hope of an early recovery in the civil aircraft
market. Against this background, the Group reduced costs and
implemented improvements across its business. Group net debt 
fell by 26.5% to £64.2m (2002 – £87.4m), in a year of uncertainty
and poor market demand.This debt reduction, helped by currency
factors, primarily the weakening of the US$, emphasises the
underlying strength of the Group.
Financial Results
Group turnover from continuing operations declined by 
11.0% to £354.9m (2002 – £398.7m) and operating proﬁt before
goodwill amortisation declined to £17.6m (2002 – £23.4m).
Group profit before tax increased to £7.7m (2002 – £7.0m) 
and underlying earnings per share was 3.52p (2002 – 4.47p).
The derivation of underlying earnings per share and other 
non-statutory information is explained in the Finance 
Director’s Review.
Turnover in the Aerospace Division reduced by 12.6% from
£164.6m in 2002 to £143.8m in 2003.This was due to the
contraction of the commercial aerospace industry where demand 
for civil aircraft continued to reduce. Demand in the defence and
military sector remained steady.Whilst divisional operating proﬁt
before goodwill amortisation reduced by 3.9% to £7.3m from 
£7.6m in 2002, the operating margin before goodwill amortisation
increased from 4.6% to 5.1%.
Sales of automotive vehicles declined by 3% in North America 
and by 2% in Europe, but turnover of the Group’s Automotive
Division fell by 12.7% from £148.4m in 2002 to £129.6m in 2003.
This was primarily due to programmes in North America coming 
to an end, as expected, when product was designed out of
vehicles. Divisional operating profit before goodwill amortisation
reduced from £12.3m in 2002 to £7.4m in 2003.The operating
margin before goodwill amortisation was 5.7% (2002 – 8.3%).
Turnover in the Specialised Industrial Division reduced 
by 4.8%, from £86.1m in 2002 to £82.0m in 2003, primarily 
due to market weakness in the North American power generation
and UK office construction markets. Divisional operating 
profit before goodwill amortisation was £2.9m (2002 – £3.5m) 
and the operating margin before goodwill amortisation was 3.5%
(2002 – 4.1%).Whilst there were no disposals completed during
the year, work remains ongoing to secure further disposals from 
this Division.
Dividend
The Board is recommending an unchanged ﬁnal dividend of 1.35p 
per share in respect of 2003, bringing the total dividend for the 
year to 2.00p per share (2002 – 2.00p).
Employees and the Board
Richard Turner, who has been a non-executive Director of the
Group for nearly eight years, has indicated that he intends to retire 
at the AGM in April.The Board would like to thank him for his
unstinting enthusiasm and support of the Group during a period 
of great change, particularly his wise counsel at Board meetings 
and incisive observations following visits to the operations.
In the middle of the year, Ron Case, previously the CEO of the
Group’s largest aerospace business, Senior Aerospace Ketema,
was promoted to be CEO of the Aerospace Division. He took 
over from Graham Menzies who had undertaken the role himself
since the events of 11 September 2001.
Across the Group our employees have worked with enthusiasm 
and commitment throughout another year of change, challenge 
and cost reduction and I would like to thank them for their loyalty
and wholehearted contribution during this period.
Outlook
A more stable market outlook is anticipated for the Group and 
it is hoped that 2004 will be the bottom of the economic cycle 
for Senior. Raw material prices are, however, increasing and any
continued weakness of the US$ would have an adverse effect when
local results are translated into sterling for reporting purposes.
With some recovery occurring in passenger numbers in the civil
market and steady demand being seen in the defence and military
sector the outlook for the aerospace industry appears more settled
than it has been for the past three years.The near-term outlook for
the automotive industry is anticipated to be one of steady consumer
demand but continued competitive pressure. In 2004 further
automotive programme reductions in North America are expected
to be largely offset by volume increases on a number of the Group’s
European programmes. In the industrial markets there are early signs
of a modest recovery in some of the sectors in which we operate.
Overall, whilst in the near-term the North American automotive
market is likely to remain challenging, the Group’s other markets 
are expected to be generally stable.With the much reduced level 
of net debt, the recent aerospace programme wins and the ongoing
level of automotive diesel product development, the longer-term
prospects for the Group are increasingly encouraging.

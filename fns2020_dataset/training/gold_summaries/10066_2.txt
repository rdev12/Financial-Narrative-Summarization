How we performed Financial highlights
(1)
“ Our first full year of ownership of FKI has 
exceeded our expectations, with margin 
improvements, debt reduction and cash 
generation being the highlights. In a very 
difficult year these results illustrate the  
quality of our businesses.
  Across the Group, sales in our early 
cycle businesses are now beginning to 
increase and in our later cycle businesses 
order books are reviving. For the moment 
it appears recovery, which has been 
noticeable for several months in the East, 
may be on the way to the West.
  We continue to believe that market and 
economic conditions favour acquisitions  
over disposals at present and so we 
continue to look for the right opportunity. 
Fortunately, the strong growth potential of 
our existing businesses over the next few 
years gives us the ability to be patient.”

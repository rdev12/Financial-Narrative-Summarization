 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
I am writing this review at the beginning
of my second year as Chief Executive of
Wagon plc, having started on 1 May
2004. It has been a year of internal
change, both in terms of the business
structure, and the people leading the
change process. It has also been an
excellent year commercially with a
marked improvement of our relationship
with our customers.
Soon after my arrival, five key priorities 
were identified, being:
1 Build on the organisational changes
introduced prior to my arrival.
2 Focus on operational performance 
and improved service and quality 
to customers.
3 Simplify our operating model 
to streamline our processes, 
decrease our costs and accelerate
decision-making.
4 Build a strong international team 
to accelerate cross-fertilisation and
leverage our presence in the main
European countries.
5 Establish a strategy increasingly 
based on technology and innovation 
to offer more value added products
and assemblies.
1 Build on Organisational Change
Last year we announced that we had
restructured our German operations,
closed the UK consultancy services
business, and closed or sold three UK
manufacturing operations in Smethwick
and Redditch.
In the current year, we have again
focused on streamlining our
manufacturing footprint, with a 
further plant closure in the UK (Oxford).
We have also taken the decision to
divest the US engineering and design
consulting business, which concludes
the exit from the former Hawtal Whiting
business (closed in the UK in the
previous year). We expect that the
divestment will close shortly.
We have implemented the reorganisation
and restructuring programme on
schedule and cost. In addition to the 
cost savings that the new organisation
model has brought through alignment
and de-layering of the management of
the business, we have made further
changes to reduce excess capacity
and realise additional efficiencies in 
our operations and support services. 
This restructuring programme will deliver
the anticipated benefits of c. £6 million
per annum, of which c. £4 million per
annum will flow through in the 2005/06
financial year.
2 Operational Performance 
and Customer Focus
As the year progressed, it became 
clear to us that there were two pressing
priorities which needed to become the
centre of attention: our safety systems 
in the workplace, and to enhance our
manufacturing efficiencies. 
We conducted a comprehensive audit 
of the safety performance across all of
our plants, which led to the launch in
October of our first Wagon initiative,
‘Safety First’. We believe that, as a
fundamental tenet for a successful
Group, we must have the safety of all 
of our employees and site visitors at 
the top of our agenda. Our target is to
achieve zero tolerance of accidents,
through the implementation of a
continuous risk management cycle
involving the regular reporting of 
accidents, immediate follow-up and
training, and the sharing of best practice
and learning experiences across 
the Group.
The whole Group is aware of the
importance of safety, and it is now 
the first subject considered at every
Board and Executive Committee and
management meeting. I am pleased 
to say that the results of the Safety First
initiative have been encouraging, with
the number of accidents having fallen by
50% in only a short period of time, albeit
from a higher base than we would have
wished. We still have much to do to
achieve our targeted benchmarks, 
and the initiative will continue to be 
the centre of attention for everyone
during 2005/06.
The second initiative is the ‘Wagon
Excellence System’ (WES). This lean
manufacturing and engineering system
was created to ensure that all of our
plants run as efficiently as possible, 
and it is a fundamental requirement 
of running a plant within Wagon that 
the WES principles are fully embraced.
However the concept is more than
simply monitoring and measuring plant
activity; it is a “management culture”
that must prevail throughout the plant,
and again it features high on the Board
and management agenda.
The review began with an initial audit of
performance and benchmarking these
results against key indicators, followed
by the setting of targets at each plant.
Although this initiative began a few
months ago, we can already see
significant results in quality, productivity
and inventory. We expect this initiative
will improve our product profability in 
the future.
Pierre Vareille, 
Chief Executive Officer
“IT HAS BEEN A YEAR 
OF SIGNIFICANT 
INTERNAL CHAN GE,
BOTH IN TERMS OF 
BUSINESS STRUCTURE
AND THE PEOPLE 
LEADING THE CHANGE” Innovative Solutions. This is strongly
contributing to the focus on accountable
operating performance, and has created
a more responsive, decisive and dynamic
business. It has also helped us to clarify
our commercial strategy in order to
become more aggressive on the market.
In addition to this we have aligned the
shared service functions into four
efficient and lean centrally managed
teams, in Industrial Development,
Purchasing, Human Resources and
Finance / Legal / IT . The resultant
Executive Committee provides a tightly
focused management team to deliver
increasing value to Wagon shareholders.
4 International team
Each Business Group and shared service
function has a new leader, compared
with 12 months ago. The recruitment
criteria for new executive management
included three key elements: they had 
to have experience of large international
organisations, including automotive
experience, and speak at least two
languages. The team consists of five
Frenchmen (including myself), a Belgian,
and two British. 
5 T echnology and Innovation 
based Strategy
In January 2005, the Executive
Committee presented to the Board its
medium and long term strategy, with 
a view to achieving my stated aim of
positioning Wagon as a leading European
automotive manufacturing company, 
and partner of choice for structural
assemblies in niche and high-end
vehicles, and “comfort systems” 
for the whole automotive industry.
Consequently, our focus remains 
on achieving growth by running only
efficient plants, by managing and
reducing operating costs and overheads,
and by making the customer the centre
of attention to drive top-line growth.
By reorganising the business into
product and technology focused
business groups, we have focused 
the capabilities of each group more in
line with customer requirements. Each
business group’s engineering teams are
now better able to respond to customer
requests and promote their innovations.
We are developing advanced engineering
teams to take this service right inside 
our main customers to directly service
their requirements.
Having defined our business groups’
technology and products we have
developed a manufacturing footprint
strategy consistent with this, and
independent of nationality. This
recognises the external strategic
developments in the market such 
as localisation in low cost countries.
In parallel, we will look for complementary
acquisitions, building on the expertise
that we have across the Group, and
ensure that we have the right capital
equipment to enable us to be providing
the support that our customers are
increasingly seeking.
It would seem inevitable that companies
in the automotive sector will need to
consolidate to ensure that they have the
economies of scale that will allow them
to survive. It is our intention that Wagon
will be among the thriving companies of
the future.
More recently, we have launched two
new initiatives; the ‘Wagon Supplier
Development’ (WSD) programme, and
the ‘Wagon Customer Focus’ (WCF)
initiative. The WSD programme seeks 
to ensure that all of our purchasing
initiatives across the Group are co-
ordinated and focused on maximising
efficiencies. We are in the process of
introducing relevant purchasing indices,
consolidating our supplier base, and
improving the monitoring of quality
issues in product received from
suppliers. Later this year, we will be
introducing cost saving programmes,
such as internet auctions for certain out-
sourced items. We have also organised
ourselves to be able to profit from
purchasing from suppliers located in 
low cost countries.
The WCF initiative was borne of 
the recognition that in order to grow
organically we must have strong
commercial relations with our customers.
Most importantly, we must be close 
to our customers. After safety, our
customers must be the number one
priority for us all. That is why this initiative
aims at creating a unique system of key
account management which will help us
to get closer to our customers and to
establish our commercial strategy jointly
with them.
3 Streamlining the process
A major aspect of this was the
reorganisation of the business structure.
During the year we have refocused the
operations of the Group into three main
business groups relating to their product,
technologies and expertise: Engineered
Structures, Metal Components and 
—Safety First: to target best 
in class in safety performance.
—Wagon Excellence System: to
streamline our processes, and
improve on efficiency.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTIN UED
Results for the year
This subject is covered in much greater
detail in the Financial Review. However, 
I am pleased to be able to report that:
— Sales from manufacturing were
slightly lower at £405.1 million (2004:
£408.3 million); Engineering Services
were £7.6 million lower (51%),
following reorganisation of the UK
business, and T ooling revenues were
£25.5 million lower (40%), following
the tail-off from the high level of
production introductions in 2004. 
—Underlying operating profits from
continuing operations increased 
by 13.4% to £22.8 million (2004: 
£20.1 million), reflecting the
improvements in manufacturing
efficiency.
—Our cash collection received
significant focus, and our year-end
debt levels were reduced from last
year’s £48.2 million, to £29.3 million.
—Our order-intake, the barometer for
future sales, enjoyed a record year.
New orders in the year were 
£83 million, and represents order
intake to sales ratio of more than 1 .2: 1 .
Operational Review
Although the European automotive
market has been difficult, the Group has
been able to mitigate these unfavourable
conditions by a stronger operational
focus and to improve the operating
margin strongly in spite of slightly lower
sales from manufacturing. Moreover, 
our team has reached successful
conclusions to negotiations with our
customers regarding the impact of
increased steel price.
As an automotive manufacturing
company, our plants are the key to
success, hence the focus around those
operations. We have been able to
produce some excellent results in most
of the plants, but we also have a number
of plants where there is still a lot of room
for improvement .
In particular, we are pleased to report
that all serious operational issues 
have been resolved during the year. 
At Fontaine, we have seen further
improvements in the plant’s efficiency
and increased sales levels following the
ramp up of production have contributed
to improved margin. At Fleurus, all
quality and customer issues have been
resolved and profitability has benefited
strongly from this turnaround. Following
significant restructuring and cost
reduction, our Waldaschaff plant 
has improved margins dramatically.
However, year on year operating profit
was impacted by lower volumes in
Bessines and Bressuire. All other 
plants delivered positive year on year
improvements in operating profit.
A special mention goes to our facility 
in the Czech Republic, which has
continued to show signs of it being 
a significant launchpad into low cost
countries, following the lead set by the
customers. It has won a considerable
amount of business in the year, and has
improved its operating margin. We have
demonstrated that we can run this
facility efficiently and profitably, and 
win new business thanks to the lower
cost structure of this plant. Lastly, we
eliminated the prior losses in our
engineering consulting activities, 
based in North America.
The demise of MG Rover was anticipated
for some time, and we have acted swiftly
since in adjusting our business. We have
accelerated the closure of the Oxford
site, and made headcount reductions
across all the UK plants affected. We
have been able to mitigate some of the
impact of the lost contribution and short
term disruption to the 2005/06 year
through other business improvements
already realised. Of the £2.0 million 
of one-time exceptional costs incurred 
to date, the majority of this relates to
provisions for debts and stock, as 
well as the impairment of relevant 
assets and tooling. Redundancy 
costs of £0.4 million will flow into 
the current year.
We are in the process of building new
facilities on the back of business won
from some of our key customers. Our
Orense, Spain plant will become a part 
of the Innovative Solutions Business
Group, and will make sunblinds and
sunroofs for the new Citroën Picasso,
due for launch in early 2006. This is
particularly significant, as it is the first
Wagon plant to be opened in Spain, a
location that is becoming increasingly
important as a centre for car assembly.
At Pescara, Italy, we will manufacture 
for the joint venture between Fiat and
Peugeot in making assemblies for the
“Ducato” light commercial vehicle.  Commercial Review
As a result of our business process
simplification our commercial teams 
are now operating with clearer lines 
of communication, and with greater
focus on operational strategy. We have
appointed a Key Account Co-Ordinator
(KAC) for each of our major customers.
The KAC’s responsibility is to be the 
focal point of all activity, ensuring that 
our customers receive premium support
from the whole of Wagon through one
point of contact.

This has delivered
handsomely with record order intake 
of £83 million, equivalent to 1 .2 years 
of turnover against the normal vehicle
programme cycle. It equates to 
£486 million of sales over the
programmes’ lives. This positions Wagon
extremely well on a two to three year
time frame – the industry cycle for
conversion of orders into revenue – and
for the duration of these programmes
thereafter.
An important development this year 
has been Wagon’s success in winning
commercial vehicle orders with longer
programme lives than passenger cars,
such as the Ducato project for the
Pescara plant. This type of contract
enables Wagon to build a significant
presence in this niche market in the
years to come. It also illustrates 
Wagon’s competence in the innovative
roll forming technology.
Amongst the more significant other
contracts secured in the year were 
the following:
—Significant volumes of stampings 
for the future Peugeot 207 coupé
cabriolet, to be assembled in Spain.
(1) Further details of the progress and results from our
Business Groups can be found on pages 12 to 17.
—Significant volumes of outsourced
assemblies for successful models
such as the Peugeot 407 for 
French plants.
—A new complete ‘front end’ for 
Nissan in the UK.
—Front and rear bumpers for the Land
Rover and door frames for Honda, 
also in the UK.
—A return to success in Germany with
door frames for Daimler Chrysler.
The increase in order intake reverses 
the declining trend of recent years in
securing new business. In addition, 
our customer quality has improved
dramatically, and with it customer
satisfaction with Wagon as a key partner.
Our commercial teams are now
operating on clearer lines of
communication, and with greater 
focus on operational strategy. 
Oleo
The Oleo business continues to remain 
a key contributor to the Wagon group. 
It is a global leader in the design and
manufacture of gas and hydraulic
cylinders for energy absorption in safety
critical applications in rail, elevator and
other specialised industrial markets.
2005/06 Priorities
After having successfully delivered
improved operational performance 
and significant structural change in
2004/05, in 2005/06 we will focus 
on the following priorities:
—Maintaining our current momentum
on order intake.
—Carefully monitoring the cash
necessary to fund our growth.
—Driving the strategic initiatives 
to realise the corresponding 
cost savings, particularly in lean
manufacturing (WES) and supplier
development (WSD).
—Cautiously looking for acquisition
targets in the domain of value 
added products and assembly
manufacturing.
—Accelerating our shift towards 
Eastern Europe.
Although the year 2005/06 will remain
challenging with a flat market and lower
sales, we are very optimistic for the
years ahead. 
We would like to thank all of our
employees for their commitment 
and their contribution. They can be 
justifiably very proud of all operational
improvement they have driven
throughout the year.
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would
like to thank David Kendall for his
commitment to Wagon for over 8 
1
/2
years as Chairman, during which time 
he has provided wisdom and guidance
gained through many years’ experience
as a senior executive in international
businesses and Chairman of several
public companies. On a personal note, 
I am most grateful to David for the
support he has given to me during my
first year as Chief Executive. He leaves
the Company in a strong position for the
future, and we wish him a long, healthy,
and active retirement.

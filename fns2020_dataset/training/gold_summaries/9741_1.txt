ceo’s review
Manx Telecom provides a wide range  
of communications services to 
consumers, businesses and the public 
sector on the Isle of Man. We have 
strong market positions across fixed line, 
mobile and data services and are 
investing in growth opportunities, 
including expanding our data centre 
footprint and growing off-island services, 
which leverage our flexible approach,  
our telecoms expertise, and our 
international roaming agreements.
We believe that following the IPO and its 
associated capital raise, Manx Telecom 
is well set for future success. As the only 
operator of a fixed line copper network 
providing local access on the Island, 
Manx Telecom is in a strong position, 
serving almost all of the existing 
available residential and business 
customers for fixed line, and providing  
a substantial proportion of the Island’s 
existing available customers with 
broadband and mobile services.
We operate in a growing, relatively 
affluent, local market, with a population 
of approximately 85,000 people, and  
the benefit of a zero % corporate tax  
rate which applies to the vast majority  
of Manx Telecom’s business means that 
the Group currently pays no corporation 
tax on both on and off-island profits.  
The Isle of Man has seen 29 years of 
unbroken economic growth, including 
throughout the recent recession.
We focus on providing a superior service 
and having a reliable, trustworthy 
reputation. Our goal is to ‘innovate and 
invest for growth’ reflecting our desire  
to maintain and develop existing  
and new customer relationships.
The Company sees growth 
opportunities within the off-island  
and data centre markets, including 
high-value managed service contracts, 
and aims to be the Island’s leading, 
quality data centre operation. Off-island, 
we intend to grow revenues through 
our various mobile virtual network 
operator (‘MVNO’) relationships, as well 
as through increasing penetration of 
connected devices and expansion into 
M2M market.
Results overview
2013 has been another good year  
for Manx Telecom. We have continued  
to drive an increase in revenue and 
profits, with a focus on growth being 
maintained in all areas of the business, 
whilst continuing to implement 
operational efficiencies to improve 
margins. Revenue growth in the year of 
5% was mainly driven by our off-island 
and data centre channels. However , we 
have also been able to achieve growth 
in fixed line services and maintain 
mobile revenues at a similar level to 
2012. By focusing on opportunities to 
improve the way we run our business, 
in particular our interaction with our 
customers and tight cost control, we 
have increased EBITDA, operating profits 
and margins in 2013. Cash generation 
remained strong and free cash flow 
remained at similar levels to last year 
despite increased capital expenditure  
on the commencement of the two 
significant capital projects, namely the 
4G network and data centre.

 These are our first results 
since the Company’s 
successful IPO and admission 
to trading on the London 
Stock Exchange and underline 
Manx T elecom’s strengths 
and solid prospects for the 
future. We have seen good 
progress across our key areas 
of growth – data centre and 
off-island – while the core 
business continues to generate 
good levels of cash, which will 
enable us to invest in future 
growth whilst also paying an 
attractive dividend.

Our 4G mobile service is due for launch 
in the summer of 2014 bringing high 
speed data services to our mobile 
customers as well as a significant uplift  
to our current 2G and 3G data services. 
4G enabled handsets and new mobile 
data packages have been made available 
in preparation for the summer launch.
Phase one of the new data centre 
project was completed at the end of Q1 
2014, bringing additional capacity as well 
as dual site resilience opportunities. The 
conversion of the existing engineering 
centre means the project is being 
undertaken in an extremely cost 
effective manner as well as having 
scope for further development, 
potentially trebling our existing hosting 
capacity. This phased approach to 
expansion means that we can link 
capex spend to customer demand, 
minimising risk and maximising returns.

Fixed, broadband and data services
Fixed and broadband provides fixed line 
voice, broadband and connectivity 
services for customers, connecting 
approximately 35,000 homes and 
approximately 4,000 businesses on the 
Island. At 31 December 2013, the Group 
had 51,500 voice lines. Customers have 
access to ADSL and high speed VDSL 
broadband services throughout the 
Island, via a high quality copper and 
fibre network. 
As at 31 December 2013, we had 
approximately 36,000 pre-paid 
subscribers and approximately 28,700 
post-paid. In terms of network, we have 
a 2G/3G mobile network with 60 sites.
Despite this being the area where we 
have the strongest competition, mobile 
revenues remained at the same level  
as the previous year. Increased revenues 
from the sale of higher value handsets 
and post-paid tariff plans as well as 
increased inbound roaming revenues 
helped counter the slowdown in 
pre-paid. Competition remains strongest 
in the pre-pay area and the introduction 
of lower priced packages and continuing 
loss of market share, albeit at a lower 
rate than previous years, contributed to 
the decline.

Data centre
Data centre offers co-location, managed 
hosting, cloud and disaster recovery to  
an international corporate client base,  
via three data centres on the Island, at 
Douglas North, Douglas Centre and the 
Greenhill Data Centre (‘GDC’). Manx 
Telecom’s data centres at GDC and 
Douglas North are ranked as Tier III data 
centres (according to Telecommunications 
Industry Association standards). This 
provides high standards of data security, 
resilience, and expandable hosting 
capacity, including business continuity and 
distributed denial of service protection. 
The Company’s data centres already 
provide hosting services for many leading 
private sector brands.

At 31 December 2013, Manx Telecom  
had approximately 25,300 broadband 
subscribers, a substantial proportion of 
the Island’s existing available customers. 
In addition, Manx Telecom delivers 
connectivity solutions to corporate 
customers, which can include voice, 
data and video services.
Further focus on rolling out high speed 
broadband has resulted in revenue 
growing 2.2% in the year due partially  
to the overall increase in the number of 
broadband customers but, in particular , 
due to the up-sell from basic speed to 
high speed broadband. With further 
roll-out of high speed broadband 
planned for 2014 and relatively low  
take up there remains further scope  
for revenue growth in this area.
Core fixed revenues remained flat in the 
year with reducing call usage offset by 
increased revenue from line rental 
charge increases.
Data services revenues grew by 
around 3.5% in the year mainly due  
to connectivity associated with data 
centre customers.
Mobile
Mobile offers a combination of pre-paid 
and post-paid tariffs addressing all 
market segments and also sells mobile 
hardware (mobile handsets and 
accessories), serving a substantial 
proportion of the existing available 
customers in the Isle of Man.

On 28 March 2014 we announced the 
completion of phase one of the third 
data centre, GDC, at a total cost of £3.5m, 
which houses 100 racks of storage 
space. This additional capacity increases 
the total storage space to 385 racks.
Phases two and three, which are 
planned for completion in 2015 and 2017 
and will add a further 120 and 320 racks, 
making GDC the biggest data centre on 
the Island in terms of rack space. We 
were delighted to win the opportunity to 
significantly increase our hosting revenue 
with one of our key customers in Q3 2012, 
which in turn contributed to the delivery 
of a 17% increase in hosting revenues in 
2013. Since completing the project, focus 
on this area of our business and 
attendance at a number of international 
exhibitions has resulted in continuing 
interest from various sectors and the 
desire to complete phase one of our new 
data centre to meet the levels of demand.
Off-Island – Global Solutions
Off-island primarily relates to the  
mobile technology platform, enabling 
wholesale and corporate customers  
to offer a variety of mobile products 
using Manx Telecom SIMs. There are  
six key areas including wholesale text 
messaging, strongest signal roaming, 
inbound services, M2M, wholesale  
voice termination, UK Mobile Virtual 
Network Enabler and a service 
management platform.
Off-island revenue continued to grow  
in 2013 by almost 26%. The 2013 growth 
follows significant focus in this area  
of the business and accelerated 
development of our capabilities and 
products. Good progress was made 
across our off-island product range 
including strongest signal mobile 
(branded Chameleon), mobile virtual 
network enabler services (‘MVNE’)  
and M2M services.
Other Revenues
Other revenues comprise: the Manx 
Telecom telephone directory, inbound 
roaming, hardware equipment, mobile 
termination, managed services and 
interconnection fees.
Revenues fell by 12% in the year mainly 
due to a reduction in equipment sales. 
However , 2012 included a large equipment 
order for one of our key customers.
Encouragingly, managed services 
revenues grew by 3% in the year and 
we are attracting increasing interest in 
this area. Directory advertising revenues 
remained fairly constant.
Summary
Overall, this is a good set of results for 
2013 giving us a solid platform to move 
into 2014 as a public company. With the 
launch of phase one of our new data 
centre already completed and our  
4G launch due for later in 2014, it will  
be a very busy first half year with 
opportunities to capitalise on these 
investments coming through in the 
second half. We look forward to 
maintaining our on-island customer base, 
continuing to grow our off-island and 
data centre revenues whilst seeking new 
opportunities to expand our business, 
using our core strengths of our on Island 
network, experienced workforce and  
a high standard of customer service.

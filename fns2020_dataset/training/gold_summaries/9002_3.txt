CHAIRMAN
“ The main factors impacting our clients’ 
businesses during 2011 have persisted 
into 2012. We expect these drivers will 
lead to the maintenance of our current 
activity levels and continue to stimulate 
demand from our clients in both the 
traditional reﬁning market and the 
new sectors in which we are becoming 
established. We look forward to another 
good year for the Group in 2012.”
–  Strong growth in earnings and proﬁts driven by 
consulting revenue growth and cost management
–  Demand for KBC’s services driven by pressure 
on reﬁning margins in Europe and North America 
and by investment activity in other regions
–  The Board recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 1.55p 
per share, giving a total of 2.25p per share
–  We expect the current high levels of demand 
for work to continue
–  Underlying EPS up 27% to 7.1p
Summary
2011 was a very successful year for KBC with strong growth in 
earnings and proﬁts driven by consulting revenue growth and cost 
management. Consulting revenues, which remained steady in the 
ﬁrst half of the year, grew strongly in the second half to a total of 
£42.7m (2010: £39.2m) with overall revenue growing by 5% to £55.7m. 
With utilisation increasing in the second half, margins improved 
accordingly and underlying earnings increased by 27%. 
Sales awards for the year were strong at £44.9m, although less 
than the prior year ﬁgure of £67.8m which included the US$42.0m, 
three-year Proﬁt Improvement Program awarded by PEMEX in Mexico. 
Consequent workload backlog was £48.7m at 31 December 2011, 
down from £58.7m the year before, but still at a much higher level 
than seen in previous years.

7 KBC Advanced Technologies plc Annual Report 2011
In Europe and North America the difﬁcult operating environment 
for many of our clients in the reﬁning industry has meant that we have 
continued to be successful in working with clients in these regions 
to improve the performance of their assets. In other parts of the 
world client investment in downstream assets continued and has 
driven demand for our services and technology. We have also seen 
increasing demand in adjacent sectors of the energy industry. 
Results
Revenue for the year increased by 5% to £55.7m (2010: £53.1m). 
Underlying proﬁt before tax increased by 20% to £5.9m (2010: £4.9m) 
and underlying earnings per share were up 27% to 7.1p (2010: 5.6p) 
due to a lower tax rate and reduction in exceptional bad debt 
provisions. On a statutory basis, proﬁt before tax was up 35% at £4.9m 
(2010: £3.6m) and basic earnings per share were 5.9p (2010: 4.0p).
Year-end cash balances increased by 29%, with a net cash balance 
of £5.8m compared to £4.5m at 31 December 2010. This is a signiﬁcant 
increase from the £2.7m at 30 June 2011 as a result of strong second 
half cash ﬂow. 
Dividend
The Board recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 1.55p per share. 
This gives a total for the year of 2.25p per share when combined 
with the interim dividend paid in October 2011 of 0.7p, an increase 
of 22% over the 2010 total of 1.85p. This recommendation reﬂects 
the strength of the results and the growth shown in earnings in 2011. 
Subject to approval at the annual general meeting, the dividend 
will be paid on 15 May 2012 to shareholders on the register at close 
of business on 4 May 2012.
Current trading and outlook
We expect the current high levels of demand for work to continue 
since the main factors impacting our clients’ businesses during 2011 
have persisted into 2012. Oil price volatility, increasing oil demand 
in the developing world and pressure on oil reﬁning margins in markets 
where demand is declining are all contributing. Reﬁning assets 
are still changing hands and there is a lack of experienced 
engineers in the areas where they are most needed. We expect 
these drivers will lead to the maintenance of our current activity 
levels and continue to stimulate demand from our clients in both 
the traditional reﬁning market and the new sectors in which we are 
becoming established. With the software arbitration now behind us, 
we expect new licence sales to grow again in 2012. We therefore 
look forward to another good year for the Group in 2012.

Chief Executive’s review
Our business is in a strong 
position for the future
through exclusive products for key new releases 
and first-to-market promotions, which offer 
customers a real point of differentiation.
Our stores make the buying decision as easy  
as possible and, more importantly, our highly 
trained and knowledgeable teams provide 
great service to core gamers and novices alike.
We have grown our GAME Reward Card 
database by 17 per cent over the last year. 
We now have over 14 million GAME Reward 
Card members around the world receiving 
loyalty points on everything they buy from us. 
The Reward Card also enables us to tailor our 
customer service to individual customer 
demands.
Through every channel and in every location 
in which we operate, our attributes as a 
specialist are at the forefront of our interaction 
with the customer. 
Market Development 
Over the short to medium term, we believe that 
the pc and video games market will continue to 
be dominated by boxed product. This is 
reinforced by the manufacturers who are

Due to our established 
specialist proposition, our 
business is in a strong position 
for the future. Central to this is 
our brand strategy which 
places our customers at the 
heart of everything we do. 
Our relationship with them is centred on a 
strong value message, offering the widest 
range of products, market leading service 
and rewarding loyalty. 
In a market where value for money has 
become increasingly important, we are 
maintaining our competitive position through 
our trade-in and preowned programme and 
“deal of the week” and “price promotion” 
campaigns, which help us to compete with 
our competitors on price.
We ensure that our customers get the 
product that they want, when they want it, 
so that they can be the first to play, delivered  Our performance

producing peripherals for the third generation 
console hardware, before looking towards the 
fourth generation. This is positive news for the 
specialist as we always perform well when new 
boxed product technology is released.
Over the longer term, we expect to see 
increasing diversity in the way people play  
and interact – more use of digital downloading 
to enhance disc based games, games 
downloaded in their entirety, greater access to 
casual (free-to-play) games, and more people 
playing mobile games. Customers will expect a 
seamless service across stores, eCommerce and 
digital platforms. Fundamentally, however, we still 
believe that customers will want to access the pc 
and video games world through a trusted, 
reliable and independent provider, and we have 
developed a GAME branded offer for them all. 
Our Strategy – Brand Proposition 
To strengthen our market leading position we 
believe that our specialist proposition must evolve, 
and we must also ensure that our brands take a 
leading role in the longer term structural changes 
in the market. Our brands offer customers:
Value: We continue to give our customers value 
for money whenever and wherever they shop 
with us. Through supplier supported deals we 
have unique bundle deals, “deal of the week” 
promotions and other price campaigns on mint 
product throughout the year. We are supporting 
this value message with an increase in the 
frequency of sales.
We continue to be the leading preowned retailer 
by maintaining compelling trade-in deals and 
offering the best prices on preowned product. 
By trading in product that they have already 
played, our customers can buy new games for 
less. We, in turn, sell those traded-in games on to 
other customers at attractive prices.
These value offers are supported by our Reward 
Card loyalty programme, which provides points 
equivalent to a 2.5 per cent in points on every 
purchase and 5 per cent if you pre-order with us.
Product and range: As a leading specialist, 
breadth of range is fundamental to our offer. We 
obtain the best allocation of new release 
product on the day of launch and through the 
product’s lifecycle. The products we sell are 
differentiated by the exclusives attached to 
them, both as tangible products (such as the 
Guitar Hero exclusive Coloured Guitar) or  
digital downloads (such as the exclusive race 
tracks in Forza Motorsport 3). The range in  
stores is being extended significantly through 
greater connectivity to our websites via 
interactive kiosks. 
We are increasing the range of own brand 
products, Gameware, to provide our customers 
with more choice at cheaper prices. These 
products are largely peripheral items, such as 
controllers.
Our teams are gearing up for the launch of 
Sony’s PlayStation Move and Microsoft’s “Project 
Natal” in the second half of 2010. These new 
peripherals will each be supported with a new 
software range and our brands are positioned to 
be the lead launch partners in Europe with the 
most comprehensive range and volume of 
products, combined with in store demonstrations 
and specialist advice.
Service: Our employees offer expert advice to 
consumers in an increasingly complex market. 
We continue to champion new technology 
launches and enhance our support service. 
To do this we are continuing to invest in our 
employee training programmes (Xcite and 
Smile). All employees receive thorough training 
in retail which, when combined with their 
genuine enthusiasm for pc and video games, 
gives us a competitive advantage. We are 
enhancing our eCommerce and digital services 
with such items as gift selectors, exclusive 
product reviews and demonstrations. Our 
eCommerce offering is more than just a virtual 
shop window; it acts to inform, compare and 
advise, creating a sense of community with our 
customers.
Loyalty: Our loyalty scheme, the GAME Reward 
Card, has given us great insight into our 
customers and provided real savings to its 
members. We are increasing membership 
benefits and personalisation to continue to build  28
The GAME Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2009-2010
Chief Executive’s review continued
trust between ourselves and our customers. We 
are furthering our target audience through the 
launch of a loyalty card in Gamestation before 
the end of the year.
These changes to our commercial offer will give 
us the points of difference to compete against 
the price and offer-led propositions on the high 
street, in the supermarkets and online. 
Our Strategy – Infrastructure and Support
Location and technology
Consumers are buying and playing pc and 
video games through a variety of different 
channels. Boxed products are still 
overwhelmingly the most popular with 
customers, but playing games online and via 
digital downloads, although less than 1 per cent 
of sales today, will become an increasingly 
important part of it in the future.
GAME is constantly updating its customer offer 
to continue its lead in this evolving market. There 
is a GAME offering in every channel and our 
objective is to offer customers the same value 
and service wherever they choose to shop and 
interact with us.
Stores: remain central to our offer, delivering 
over 94 per cent of our revenues. We strongly 
believe that stores will continue to have a very 
significant role in pc and video games retailing. 
We actively manage our store portfolio in each 
of our territories, to create a store footprint that 
is appropriately matched to local market 
conditions. As non-boxed revenues increase, we 
are reducing the number of overlapping outlets 
in the UK, targeting 550 stores by Christmas 2013. 
The profile of our leases will allow us to do this. 
We are also limiting store openings in our existing 
international locations, but will continue to look 
at new markets if they show the right return 
characteristics.
Our stores are a place to experience games, 
and the format is evolving to cater for their 
changing needs and the incoming new 
technology. We are trialling interactive kiosks 
and improved eCommerce connectivity in 
selected stores to expand further the range with 
thousands more product lines and enhance the 
customer experience. 
To deal with the transactional volumes through 
our stores, we continually upgrade our IT 
infrastructure. As part of this we are installing 
both customer conversion technology and 
top-up card activation capabilities within our 
outlets.
eCommerce: is an important part of our 
customer offering, delivering over 5 per cent of 
our revenues. Through our websites we can offer 
the same services as in our stores, plus a 
substantially enhanced range, online-only offers 
and additional marketing and support, i.e. Click 
and Collect, to our customers and stores. We 
are launching two eCommerce initiatives to 
develop this opportunity further.
To give our customers a seamless brand 
experience we are introducing a new 
“Websphere” eCommerce platform over the 
next two years, linking all of our territories and 
stores to provide a universal online portal, and 
fully connected infrastructure. This will help 
customers by increasing the efficiency of 
product targeting and searching, and will 
support GAME’s marketing efforts by increasing 
awareness of both new releases and back 
catalogue software. It will also give us a single 
view of customer behaviour across our stores 
and websites, and help us improve our services 
further. GAME will invest £5 million this year and 
the next in this eCommerce platform.
Our websites around the world receive 112 million 
visits per annum. This, coupled with our Reward 
Card programme, already gives us one of the 
largest communities of video gamers in the 
world. Now we are building on this position by 
“Our stores are a place to 
experience games, and the 
format is evolving to cater for 
customers’ changing needs 
and the incoming new 
technology.” Our performance

delivering joint benefits of scale and enhancing 
our customer proposition in every territory and 
channel in which we operate.
By seeking exclusives for all major titles we have 
a competitive point of difference, and where 
those exclusives are digital content we are 
building a brand image in the digital arena. 
Distribution
In all of our markets, the majority of new 
products are sold in the first weeks of launch, so 
immediate availability, and timely replenishment, 
is crucial to our credibility. GAME Group has 
purpose-built distribution facilities in all territories 
to ensure that products reach customers at the 
right time. Distribution centres support our stores, 
as well as our direct to home solutions. 
Multi-channel
The actions we are undertaking will give us a 
genuine multi-channel proposition that will 
make us the aggregator of choice for customers 
wherever they want to shop and however they 
want to interact with pc and video games.
Summary
The resilience of our performance last year was 
entirely attributable to our credentials as a 
specialist retailer, which gives us many 
competitive advantages. We have clearly 
identified plans to move these forward, and in so 
doing will address and outpace the current 
competitive pressures that we face and position 
ourselves for the longer term changes in our 
market place.
Whilst we recognise that the outlook for the 
wider global economy remains uncertain and 
that we face a difficult current year, we believe 
that our value-led offer positions us well and with 
our ongoing cost discipline, we are confident 
about our prospects going forward.

creating a social networking site, Gamesnation, 
which is currently in beta testing with thousands 
of members to increase brand awareness further 
and to appeal to a wider target audience.
Digital: revenues are small, less than 1 per cent 
of turnover, but are a growing part of our 
business. The digital market is still very disparate, 
and activity is currently limited by technological 
capacity and customer appetite. However, as 
digital revenues form a larger part of the market 
over the next five years, we believe that both 
customers and manufacturers want a trusted 
brand to act as the independent aggregator. 
Consequently we continue to grow our digital 
pc download offer, which is now the largest in 
Europe with over 1,000 titles available. 
This gives us invaluable insight into customer 
demands as we extend our digital offer. We can 
be reached through a GAME iPhone app which 
was launched in 2009 and we have become the 
first video games retailer to have a presence in 
Sony PlayStation Home (the online portal for 
12 million PlayStation 3 players). Over the coming 
months we will announce our plans for other 
digital arenas. 
We continue to participate in online gameplay, 
selling time cards, add-ons and a wide range of 
peripherals to maximise the gameplay 
experience.
Our focus continues to be on our customers, 
ensuring that for every service they want to use 
we can provide functionality, either by building it 
ourselves or by involving a partner such as 
Metaboli. In every case we will also provide 
extensive advice and full after-sales care. 
Business relationships 
To provide customers with all the product and 
offers they want from a specialist it is vital that we 
maintain long-term and successful relationships 
with all of our partners. We are committed to 
working with our suppliers to continually improve 
our specialist proposition and we have recently 
appointed a Group Commercial Strategy 
Director to work with our partners at a global 
level, further strengthening our relationships,  30

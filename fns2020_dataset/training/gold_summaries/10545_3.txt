Introduction
Against the background of the 
current economic climate, I am pleased 
to report satisfactory results for the year .
In these challenging trading 
conditions, the Group’s established 
strategy of shifting the balance of 
revenues from Specialist Building 
to Specialist Engineering, which now 
accounts for 36% compared with 15% 
three years ago, is justified as both 
revenues and profits from Specialist 
Engineering have increased. The impact 
of the recession has been keenly felt 
in Specialist Building but the cost 
reduction measures which we have 
implemented throughout the year 
leaves that part of the Group’s business 
well placed to negotiate these difficult 
market conditions successfully. 
Results
Group revenue for the year ended 
30 September 2009 was £316.6m 
(2008: £390.6m). Profit before income tax 
for the year prior to exceptional items 
and amortisation charges was £5.5m 
(2008: £9.5m). Profit after tax, exceptional 
items and amortisation charges, 
was £0.4m (2008: £5.3m).
The Group remains debt free and at 
30 September 2009, the Group’s net 
cash position stood at £14.6m (2008: 
£28.2m). The Board expects a similar 
level of net cash at 30 September 2010.
Specialist Engineering revenues grew 
by 14% to £114.8m (2008: £100.8m) 
and operating profit prior to exceptional 
items and amortisation charges increased 
by 16% to £4.0m (2008: £3.5m).

chairman’s statement
The specialist markets in which we 
operate are in sectors which have 
strong regulatory drivers. This provides 
greater visibility of workflow and 
stability of earnings. 
In Specialist Building the past year has 
seen worsening conditions resulting in 
revenues reducing to £202.4m (2008: 
£287.0m). These reductions have been 
principally experienced in the retail and 
non‑specialist sectors which accounted 
for 27% of Specialist Building revenue 
in 2009 compared to 46% in 2008. 
Nevertheless, Specialist Building 
delivered operating profits prior to 
exceptional items and amortisation 
charges of £2.5m (2008: £4.9m).
The Group has incurred £4.4m of 
exceptional costs including £2.6m 
of restructuring and redundancy costs. 
The decisive action taken resulted in 
reduced capacity of 35% in Specialist 
Building which realigns the business 
appropriately for market conditions. 
These actions have produced annual 
cost savings in excess of £12m.
The Group’s order book at 
30 September 2009 stood at 
£202m (2008: £219m) with a 67% 
increase in Specialist Engineering 
to £82m (2008: £49m). Over 80% 
is in the form of repeat business 
for both Specialist Building and 
Specialist Engineering sectors. 
Within Specialist Engineering 70% 
is in resilient markets with regulated 
spending plans. Our emphasis 
will remain on project selectivity 
to reduce contract risk and to 
maintain quality of earnings. 
Office of Fair Trading Investigation 
Renew has received the decision 
from the Office of Fair Trading (“OFT”) 
following its investigation into tender 
activities within the construction sector. 
This decision was that a fine of £0.5m 
will be levied on Allenbuild Limited 
(“Allenbuild”), one of its subsidiaries, 
and that a fine of £3.0m will be levied on 
Bullock Construction Limited (“Bullock”). 
Bullock is a former subsidiary of Renew, 
which was sold in September 2005 to 
a company controlled by Bullock’s 
management. The OFT holds that 
Renew is jointly and severally liable for 
these fines. Having taken legal advice, 
Renew has appealed against the OFT 
decision and the Board believes that 
Renew will have no liability in respect 
of the Bullock fine. Accordingly, in these 
results, the Group has provided a sum 
of £0.5m as an exceptional charge in 
respect of the Allenbuild fine. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing to maintain 
the final dividend at 2.0p per share. 
This will provide an annual dividend 
of 3.0p (2008: 3.0p). The dividend 
will be paid on 25 February 2010 to 
shareholders on the register as at 
29 January 2010 and in accordance 
with accounting standards will be 
accounted for in the 2010 financial 
year. The shares will become 
ex‑dividend on 27 January 2010.
Growth strategy
Our strategy addresses current 
market conditions and focuses on 
two distinct business streams, Specialist 
Engineering and Specialist Building. 
Our aim is to increase revenue in 
Specialist Engineering both organically 
and by acquisition, whilst maintaining 
operating margins in the target range 
of 3% to 4%. During the year, we have 
added to the breadth of our offering in 
both the Water and Nuclear industries 
with the acquisitions of C.&A. Pumps 
Limited and Mothersill Engineering. 
In Specialist Building we aim to 
selectively access opportunities, 
maintaining profitability of at least 1% 
at the operating level with a longer term 
target of 2% as markets improve.
Our medium term objective is to 
develop a Specialist Engineering 
and Construction Services Group 
with overall operating profits of over 
2% and with Specialist Engineering 
providing 50% of revenue.
Outlook
The continuing difficult market 
presents challenges however our 
debt free balance sheet with available 
cash resources puts Renew in a position 
of strength. The Group benefits from a 
highly experienced management team, 
led by Brian May, Chief Executive, and I 
am confident that the Group will deliver 
a resilient performance and trade 
profitably through the recession.

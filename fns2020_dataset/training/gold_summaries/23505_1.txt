Overview
We are pleased to report our full 
year results for the year ended 30 
September 2016, during which period 
we have delivered EBITDA before 
exceptional items of £292 million, 
down £4 million on the comparative 
period primarily as a result of planned 
asset disposals. Profit before taxation, 
excluding exceptional items, was 
unchanged at £122 million as lower 
interest costs, resulting from reduced 
levels of debt, have offset the decline 
in EBITDA. 
Through the execution of our strategic 
plan we have set out to improve our 
capability in retailing, developing 
our understanding and usage of 
consumer insights to help us to 
identify the most appropriate retail 
proposition for each of our assets, to 
inform our subsequent investment 
decisions and to determine the 
appropriate operating model with 
which to optimise the return from 
each asset and deliver greater 
shareholder value. This means we are 
evolving from a predominantly leased 
and tenanted operation to a portfolio 
of businesses operating a variety of 
models and trading styles. Our Group 
vision is to be recognised as the 
most innovative, progressive, value-
creating portfolio manager of pubs 
and properties in the UK. 
Enterprise Publican 
Partnerships 
Enterprise Publican Partnerships is 
the trading name for our tied leased 
and tenanted business which is the 
largest part of our Group. Whilst the 
scale of our tied leased and tenanted 
business is expected to decline over 
the coming years, as we migrate 
assets to alternative operating 
models, we are confident that the 
quality of the retained Enterprise 
Publican Partnerships estate will be 
enhanced. Such quality enhancement 
will be delivered through the disposal 
of the poorer performing sites; 
continued capital investment in tied 
tenancies to drive enhanced retail 
offers; market-leading support from 
our highly trained regional managers; 
our plans to share the knowledge 
and experience we are gaining from 
our directly managed operations with 
our tied publicans; and our ability to 
leverage scale benefits from managed 
operations which can then be shared 
with our tied publicans.
As at 30 September 2016, there 
were 4,470 pubs trading within the 
total leased and tenanted estate 
which delivered growth in like-for-like 
net income of 2.1% in the financial 
year. The improvement in trading 
performance has been achieved 
across all geographic regions within 
our estate throughout the year. 
It is particularly pleasing to see 
like-for-like net income growth being 
delivered across all regions with the 
North reporting growth for the first 
time in several years (up 1 .1%). We 
have maintained our like-for-like net 
income growth in the Midlands (up 
1 .7%), and delivered strong growth in 
the South (up 2.7%).

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Strategic report
15
We provide our tied leased and 
tenanted publicans with a broad range 
of services to help them operate 
their pubs efficiently and effectively. 
Where appropriate we also provide 
direct financial assistance to publicans. 
In the year we provided £5 million 
(2015: £6 million) of such assistance. 
As a consequence of the successful 
application of these initiatives we 
have further reduced the number of 
unplanned business failures, down 
14% in the current year compared 
to the prior year. The proactive 
intervention of our regional managers 
to identify and then avoid these 
potential business failures is a key 
driver of the consistent improvements 
achieved in our like-for-like net income. 
Following the recent regulatory 
changes and specifically the 
introduction of the Market Rent 
Only (MRO) option for publicans 
there is now a degree of uncertainty 
with regard to the level of future 
income that we might earn from 
long-term tied leases. Therefore we 
no longer offer new tied leases for 
a period of greater than five years, 
we are unlikely to invest significantly 
in existing long-term tied leases 
and we more closely scrutinise 
such agreements at the time of 
renewal or assignment to protect 
our interests. We do offer a wide 
range of tied tenancy agreements to 
prospective publicans including our 
Beacon “managed tenancy” , for the 
competitive value wet-led retail offer, 
and our new Partnership Tenancy 
Plus, which we launched in the 
second half of the financial year. 
Enterprise Commercial 
Properties 
We continue to expand our high 
quality commercial property portfolio 
operated within our Enterprise 
Commercial Properties business and 
in the financial year properties that 
traded as commercial properties 
throughout both this year and the 
prior year increased like-for-like net 
income by 3.8%. 
As at 30 September 2016 we had  
273, and at 14 November 2016 we 
have 291, commercial properties, the 
vast majority of which trade as pubs 
on a free-of-tie basis. These properties 
have an annualised rental income of 
£18.0 million (with an average rent 
of £62,000) and were valued at 30 
September 2016 at £208 million, 
resulting in a gross yield of 8.7%. 
On 7 June 2016 we sold a portfolio 
of 22 commercial properties 
which comprised of 17 pubs and 5 
convenience stores geographically 
spread across England. The disposal 
generated £20 million of net proceeds, 
representing a 9% premium to the 
prior year-end book value and a 6.7% 
yield based upon the gross rental 
income of £1 .34 million. The disposal 
package is typical of the type of assets 
we are now adding to our commercial 
property portfolio and therefore 
provides an indication of the inherent 
value of the portfolio.
We expect to be operating around 
400 to 450 commercial properties 
by 30 September 2017 , although, 
as demonstrated by the recent 
disposal described above, growing 
the scale of our commercial property 
portfolio in itself is not our primary 
objective, and we will constantly 
assess opportunities to crystallise and 
capture value from this estate.

leased and tenanted business
 — Continued momentum with leased and tenanted 
like-for-like net income up 2.1% (2015: up 0.8%)

We are building the capability to

business and we are pleased with 
the progress made to date. Greater 
operational control, complete 
transparency of all sales and cost 
lines and the use of consumer 
insights are giving us increased 
certainty over the returns achievable 
from these managed pubs.
Utilising our segmentation model 
we have identified that our existing 
pub estate provides us with a robust 
pipeline for the future expansion of 
our managed retail formats and we 
are confident that the original target, 
set in May 2015, of a managed house 
estate comprising between 750 and 
850 pubs by 2020 is deliverable.

Chief Executive’s 
review
Enterprise Managed 
Operations: Craft Union  
Pub Company
Our largest managed house operation 
is the Craft Union business which 
operated 71 sites at 30 September 
2016. It operates 75 sites at 14 
November 2016 and we expect it 
to be operating around 170 sites by 
30 September 2017 . This business 
predominantly operates in the north 
of England, but is beginning to 
expand south and we expect its offer 
to appeal nationally. Currently, its 
offer is wet-led with quality beers, 
at affordable prices, served in local, 
well-invested, community pubs. The 
simplicity of the offer mitigates our 
execution risk and also improves the 
efficiency of our capital investment. 
As at 14 November 2016, we had 38 
pubs operating within Craft Union 
that had traded for more than six 
months and these pubs are to-date 
generating average annualised site 
EBITDA of £92,000, from an average 
capital investment of £126,000, 
which delivers pre-tax returns of 
36%. A number of these early sites 
have delivered exceptional trading 
performance which we may not be 
able to replicate as we extend our offer 
and accelerate the rollout programme. 
We would expect our Craft Union sites 
to generate site EBITDA in the range 
of £80,000 to £100,000 on average. 
After an average capital investment in 
the region of £100,000, we expect to 
yield returns on investment in excess 
of 20%.
Enterprise Managed 
Operations: Bermondsey 
Pub Company 
As at 30 September 2016 we 
operated 28 managed pubs within 
our Bermondsey business. As at 14 
November 2016 we operated 30 pubs 
and expect to have in the region of 50 
pubs in this model by 30 September 
2017 . All of these Bermondsey 
pubs operate under our successful 
“Meeting House” format, an upper 
mid-market, mixed food and drink offer.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Strategic report
During the year we trialled five 
Bermondsey sites operating under 
our “Friends and Family” format in 
the value-led, mixed food and drink 
segment. We found this market 
segment to be highly competitive, 
requiring significant investment 
and scale of operation in order to 
deliver adequate returns. We have 
therefore determined that this retail 
segment should not be a priority for 
our business and have subsequently 
either sold, let free-of-tie or converted 
the trial sites to an amended retail 
offer within our managed operations.
At 14 November 2016 we had 11 pubs 
operating within our Bermondsey 
business that had traded for more 
than six months and these pubs 
are to-date generating average 
annualised site EBITDA of £116,000, 
from an average capital investment 
of £187 ,000, which delivers pre-tax 
returns of 25%. As we enhance 
our offers within the Bermondsey 
business we would expect the 
average capital investment to be in 
the region of £200,000 with average 
site EBITDA expected to grow to be 
in the range of £125,000 to £175,000, 
which we expect to yield returns on 
investment in excess of 15%.
Enterprise Managed 
Investments 
In some retail segments, pub 
operators have to be both innovative 
and highly flexible in order to be 
able to continually adapt more 
complex retail offers to the changing 
demands of consumers. Within our 
Managed Investments business we 
have developed a partnership model 
whereby we can work with carefully 
selected managed house operators to 
share in the benefits of trading certain 
high quality establishments in such 
retail segments. 
We entered our first such partnership 
with Hippo Inns, established with 
Rupert Clevely, founder of Geronimo 
Inns, and Hippo Inns currently has 
six pubs in operation. To date we 
have established four additional 
partnerships with the creation of: 
Mash Inns, a new venture with Laine 
Pub Group; Frontier Pubs, a venture 
with Food & Fuel; Hunky Dory Pubs 
in conjunction with Oakman Inns; and 
Marmalade Pub Company, a venture 
with the Marylebone Leisure Group. 
In aggregate these partnerships 
enable us to provide a broader range 
of consumer offers across a wider 
geographic market than we might 
have achieved on our own. As at 30 
September 2016 we had eight pubs 
and as at 14 November 2016 we had 
a total of 11 pubs trading under our 
various relationships and we expect 
to grow this model in the coming year 
such that by 30 September 2017 we 
expect to be operating with around 
ten partners and trading in the region 
of 30 pubs. 
Optimising capital 
allocation to enhance 
returns
Enterprise generates significant 
cash flows from trading activities 
supplemented by disposals of 
under-performing assets. We have 
established a returns-based approach 
to the use of our future cash flows 
which seeks to continue our debt 
reduction programme and to provide 
a balance between additional value 
enhancing investment opportunities 
and more immediate returns to 
shareholders. 
Our capital allocation framework 
first seeks to ensure that all priority 
calls upon cash flows are satisfied, 
including corporation tax, interest, 
scheduled debt amortisation 
and costs associated with debt 
refinancing, followed by on-going 
investment in our business. We are 
committed to gradually reducing our 
leverage over the medium-term and, 
assuming we are on track to satisfy 
this objective, then any “excess” cash 
flow can be assessed for alternative 
use, including in particular, further 
investment in the estate or the return 
of capital to shareholders.

Capital investment
Capital investment is a value-
enhancing use of cash generated 
by the business and includes the 
recycling of proceeds of disposals. It is 
an important contributor to delivering 
improved like-for-like net income within 
our leased and tenanted business and 
is an essential element of the strategic 
evolution of the business as we invest 
in the conversion of pubs to our 
managed operations. 
Total capital investment in the year 
was £74 million (2015: £69 million), 
of which 57% was directed toward 
income growth opportunities 
(2015: 44%). We target Return on 
Investment (ROI) in excess of 15% 
on our growth oriented capital 
expenditure and have achieved an 
average ROI of 22% (2015: 19%) on 
schemes delivered during the  
financial year. 
Allocation of excess cash
During the year to 30 September 
2016 we generated £48 million of 
excess cash flow. Applying our capital 
allocation framework, the Board 
decided to utilise this excess cash 
flow to fund the £27 .5 million cost 
to repurchase £250 million of the 
2018 bonds and, in order to optimise 
shareholder returns, to fund a £25 
million share buyback of ETI shares 
for cancellation. This share buyback 
programme was initiated on 22 March 
2016 and as at 14 November 2016 we 
have purchased 14 million shares at 
an average price of 91p per share.
Outlook 
Trading in the first six weeks of the 
new financial year has been in line 
with our expectations and we are 
confident that the actions we are 
taking to execute our strategic plans 
are the most appropriate response 
to changes in the regulatory and 
economic environment. Whilst 
mindful that the potential impact of 
the regulatory changes is not yet 
completely clear, we plan to deliver 
positive like-for-like net income growth 
in our leased and tenanted tied pub 
estate for the full year and to further 
expand our commercial property and 
managed house businesses in line 
with our strategy.   
Regulatory review
On 21 July 2016 the new Statutory 
Code of Practice introduced by the 
Small Business, Enterprise and 
Employment Act 2015 came into 
effect. The Pubs Code applies to 
the six companies with over 500 
pubs operating under tied leased 
and tenancy agreements in England 
and Wales, and is overseen by an 
independent Adjudicator.
The new legislation includes 
a tenant’s right, under certain 
circumstances, to change the freely-
negotiated commercial terms of 
their existing agreement to a new 
Market Rent Only (MRO) compliant 
agreement. This enables some 
occupational tenants to elect to 
opt-out of the supply tie at certain 
points or after certain exceptional 
events during the term of their lease 
agreement and therefore occupy the 
premises on a standard commercial 
property lease, paying rent only. In 
the event that a tenant elected to 
invoke this option, whilst our income 
derived from the supply of tied drinks 
products would be partially offset by 
increases in rent, it is possible that 
our total income from that property 
would be adversely affected.
The impact of MRO is expected to 
take effect over five years, as MRO 
trigger events are largely expected 
to arise through the cycle of five 
yearly rent reviews and agreement 
renewals, which apply only to our 
leases. As such, since the concept 
of MRO agreements was first 
announced in November 2014, 
we have worked hard to reduce 
our exposure to such longer-term 
leases and increase the proportion 
of our tied business operating under 
shorter-term tenancies where rent 
reviews and renewals do not apply. 
As at November 2014 we had 3,035 
long-term lease agreements and this 
has reduced by 634 to 2,401 as at 30 
September 2016. 
From the date of the implementation 
of the new Pubs Code, there have 
been 285 potential MRO trigger 
events. In 94 of these cases the 
publican made a valid request for an 
MRO quote. Whilst none of these 
requests has yet to result in the 
introduction of an MRO compliant 
agreement, at this stage it is too 
early to say how many may ultimately 
do so. In our 2017 financial year we 
expect to have approximately 600 
cyclical rent reviews and agreement 
renewals which may potentially 
constitute MRO events. Although we 
experienced a short-term slowdown 
in letting activity upon implementation 
of the Pubs Code, due to the need to 
re-market all lets in line with the new 
regulatory requirements, we do not 
expect this to impact our expectations 
for the current year financial 
performance.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Strategic report
The Duke of Sussex in Lower Marsh, Waterloo was the third 
site in our Hippo Inns Managed Investments business, 
opening in April 2016. The pub had been operated as a 
traditional ‘wet-led’ pub for over 30 years by the previous 
publican. Following lease expiry, Enterprise, under its new 
strategy was able to occupy, invest and evolve the offer 
to include great food, trade longer hours and create a 
modern vibrant pub. The opening has been celebrated by 
customers and local community groups alike, has increased 
employment in the local area, and is now one of the most 
successful businesses in Lower Marsh, providing solid 
returns for the investment and creating substantial value for 
Enterprise. 
Our partnership with Rupert Clevely and the unique ‘magic’ 
that is provided through design, great service culture and 
people has allowed us to deliver what many have described 
as the future pub experience today. Hippo Inns now 
operates six pubs in this model with more in the pipeline.

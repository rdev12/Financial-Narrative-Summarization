Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to announce that Cohort plc has 
continued to make good progress in its second full 
year as a publicly quoted company, successfully 
implementing our strategy of growing both organically 
and by acquisition in the provision of technical 
services to defence and related markets. Our existing 
subsidiaries, MASS Consultants Limited (MASS) and 
Systems Consultants Services Limited (SCS) again 
delivered strong revenue growth. Cohort acquired 
SEA (Group) Limited (SEA) on 31 October 2007 and 
the new business has settled in well and performed 
ahead	of	expectations	in	its	first	six	months	within	
the Group.
Key Financials
In the year ended 30 April 2008, Cohort achieved 
revenue of £57.1m (2007: £34.4m) representing 
a 66% increase on 2007. This included revenue of 
£26.1m (2007: £22.1m) from SCS, and £18.0m from 
MASS (2007: £12.3m for nine months), representing 
annualised organic growth of 18% and 10% respectively , 
with an initial contribution from SEA of £13.0m.
The	Group’ s	adjusted	operating	profit	was	£6.1m	
(2007:	£2.9m).	 This	included	operating	profit	from	
SCS of £2.3m (2007: £2.2m) and from MASS of £2.3m 
(2007: £1.3m for nine months) representing annualised 
organic growth of 6% and 30% respectively. The initial 
contribution from SEA for six months was £2.2m, 
representing a strong second half performance. 
Cohort group overheads were £0.7m (2007: £0.6m). 
Group	operating	profit	was	£5.5m	(2007:	£2.5m).
P r o fi t 	 b e f o r e 	 a m o r t i s a t i o n 	 o f 	 o t h e r 	 i n t a n g i b l e 	 a s s e t s ,	
interest and tax was £6.0m (2007: £2.7m) after 
accounting for the Group’s share of joint venture 
losses of £118,000 (2007: £256,000).
P rofit	after	interest	and	before	tax	was	£5.6m	
(2007:	£2.7m)	and	profit	after	tax	was	£4.5m	
(2007: £2.3m).
Basic earnings per share were 12.81p (2007: 8.21p). 
Adjusted earnings per share were 14.24p 
(2007: 8.71p). The adjusted earnings per share 
were based upon profit after tax, excluding 
amortisation of other intangible assets and 
exceptional items.
The Cohort cash balance at year‑end was £6.1m 
(2007: £5.0m), reflecting the good operating 
performance, net of the cash invested in the 
acquisition of SEA. The earn‑out payment for 
the shareholders of SEA, estimated to be £4.7m 
is expected to be paid in July 2008.
Dividends
The	Group	plans	to	pay	a	final	dividend	of	1.0p	per	
ordinary share (2007: 0.9p), making the full year 
dividend in respect of the year ended 30 April 2008 
1.45p per ordinary share (2007: 1.30p). This will 
be payable on 3 September 2008 to shareholders 
on the register at 8 August 2008 subject to approval 
at the Annual General Meeting on 28 August 2008.
Board and Personnel
Ian Dale‑Staples joined the Cohort executive team 
and Board on 1 November 2007 following the acquisition 
of SEA. As well as holding responsibility for SEA, Ian 
is working closely with Stanley Carter, Simon Walther 
and me on the Group’s acquisition plans.

Chairman 03
Cohort plc
Annual Report 
and Accounts 2008
I would like to add a warm welcome to all the 
employees of SEA who have joined the Cohort Group.
I would like to thank all our employees for the 
efforts which have helped to make this year another 
successful one.
Outlook
Following a good year for order intake with total 
orders of £63.8m the Group order book at 1 May 2008 
stood at £58.3m. This provided a good platform 
going into the current year. With the addition of SEA 
the Group now stands with a wide offering to its 
largest customer, the UK MOD, but has also, through 
further export orders secured at MASS and through 
the space, transport and other commercial segments 
of SEA, positioned itself to grow in additional markets 
and sectors. We continue to look for acquisitions 
to complement the organic development 
of the business.
Overall the Board is positive about the outlook 
for the continued progress of the Group.

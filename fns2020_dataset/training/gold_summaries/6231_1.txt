 Chief Executive’s Review
Freshwater UK made considerable progress in 2006-07 towards its goal of building a
substantial PR-led marketing group combining a regional network with specialist and
sectoral expertise.
During the year, the Group transformed itself into a public company and secured
admission to AIM in July 2007 through a placing that raised £4m before expenses to fund
further growth.  
The year also saw a very strong trading performance with turnover rising 59 per cent to
£6.54m, revenue (gross profit) rising 65 per cent to £4.66m and operating profit rising 114
per cent to £1.02m.
The large increases in turnover and revenue were achieved by a combination of:
� Organic growth of 7.7 per cent in the businesses that were in the Group at the start of
the previous financial year (2005-06)
� A full-year’s trading from the four businesses acquired in 2005-06, all of which were
successfully integrated under the Freshwater brand during 2006-07
� A contribution of six months’ trading from Attenborough Saffron, a leading London-
based consumer agency
At the same time, the Group has delivered increases in profit margins, taking them to
among the best in the PR industry.  As a percentage of revenue, operating profit grew from
16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent and EBITDA grew from 20.7 per cent in 2005-06 
to 24.6 per cent in 2006-07, ahead of our key performance indicator (KPI) target of 
23 per cent.  
This outstanding profit performance was underpinned by higher productivity, with average
revenue per full time employee rising 16 per cent from £61,373 to £70,963 and EBITDA
per full time employee rising 38 per cent from £12,681 to £17,443.
Strategy
Freshwater is now beginning to reap the benefits of its strategy of creating an integrated
Group, trading under one brand and offering a single point of contact for regional and
specialist PR and marketing services.  
Our model provides considerable scope for growth through cross-selling to existing
clients, economies of scale in our own marketing activity and the ‘combined’ selling of
diverse services and expertise to new clients.  We have also kept overheads low by basing
two-thirds of our staff outside London and centralising back office and Group functions 
in Cardiff.
The Group’s aim is to become Britain’s leading regional and specialist PR network through
organic growth and earnings-enhancing acquisitions.
We already have strong operations in Wales, Scotland and the English regions and
substantial specialist expertise in technology, healthcare, education, consumer, property,
leisure, retail, utilities and the public sector. Our PR and communications offering is
enhanced by teams offering creative, digital and training services.  
The market for agency PR services in the UK was estimated to be worth more than £1.2bn
in 2005 (Chartered Institute of Public Relations) and has seen sustained and substantial
growth every year since 2003. We believe that PR will continue to play a growing role as
media and communication channels become more diverse and technology changes make
them more accessible. PR is less vulnerable to cyclical factors than conventional advertising
and other marketing services, and the Freshwater business model, with its diverse client
base across many regions and sectors, is particularly robust.

Acquisitions
The acquisition of Attenborough Saffron on 28 February 2007, which had a turnover in the
11 months prior to completion of £2.1m, was our largest to date and puts Freshwater
among the market leaders in consumer PR.
Our policy is to acquire well-run businesses with a history of profitable trading led by
principals who share the Group’s vision and want to participate in implementing our
strategy. We are continuing to look at a variety of acquisition options that fit our strategy
in one or more of the following ways:
� Expansion into new regions and greater market share in regions where Freshwater
already has a strong presence
� The addition of new specialisms and sectors
� Expansion of existing specialisms to achieve market leading positions
� New marketing services that enhance and complement the PR offering
Our formula for acquisitions is financially prudent and minimises risk while incentivising
performance.
Freshwater’s strategy also provides for incremental and gradual expansion into overseas
markets, both organically and through acquisitions and joint ventures that fit our strategy
and deliver synergies with existing operations.   
On 1 November 2007, we acquired Lynx Public Relations in Leeds, which adds regional
strength in the north of England and specialist expertise in the utility sector and the
growing field of community relations. Its clients include; National Grid, Halifax [a division
of HBOS], Northern Electric Distribution Limited, Yorkshire Electricity Distribution and
York-based Beacon, the purchasing arm of Best Western Hotels and the UK’s largest
purchasing consortium for the independent hospitality industry. 
The total maximum consideration of the acquisition will be £1.25m. This comprises an
initial consideration of £0.45m, which is satisfied by £0.35m in cash and by the issue of new
Freshwater shares. In addition, a maximum payment of £0.15m will be made for the net
assets of Lynx at completion and a further deferred consideration of a maximum of £0.65m
will be made dependent on the profit performance of Lynx in the 12 months following
completion.
On 2 December 2007, we acquired the Waterfront Partnership and the Waterfront
Conference Company in London and Brussels. Waterfront will contribute public affairs
expertise to the Group, particularly in the transport sector, and a well-established
conference business with experience of organising up to 40 events annually at venues
across Britain.  Waterfront’s clients include the Association of T rain Operating Companies,
Civil Aviation Authority, Go Skills, Mersey T ravel, D P World, Port of London Authority,
UK Major Ports Group, Macquarie, GNER and Bristol Port Company. 
The combined businesses, which had unaudited turnover of £2.07m and net profit before
tax of £0.29m in the year to 31 March 2007, were acquired for a total maximum
consideration of £2.245m. This comprises an initial consideration of £0.945m, which is
satisfied by £0.72m in cash and the issue of new Freshwater shares. The additional
deferred consideration will be subject to the profit performance of the two businesses in
the 15 months following completion.

Clients 
Freshwater’s client roster grew from 239 in 2005-06 to 329 in 2006-07, with none
accounting for more than 3.5 per cent of revenue.
Major brands using our services include John Lewis, Lloyds TSB Insurance, Ryder Cup
Europe, Specsavers, Bellway, RBS, Morphy Richards, Waterford Wedgwood, Scottish &
Southern Energy, General Mills, Nivea Beauté, QVC and Edwards (formerly part of the
BOC group).
Public sector clients include the Environment Agency, London School of Economics,
Sheffield Hallam University, University of Birmingham, the Food Standards Agency, several
NHS regions and trusts, and the Welsh Assembly Government. 
Cross selling and combined selling is reflected in the fact that we provided more than one
service to 90 clients, including 18 of the top 20. We believe that the potential 
for broadening our partnerships with clients through meeting more of their marketing 
and communication needs is very significant, providing real potential for further growth
in revenues.
In 2006-07, we won a national award at the Chartered Institute of Public Relations’
President’s Grand Prix, for ‘Putting Newport on the Map', a campaign on behalf of
regeneration company Newport Unlimited.  The Midlands and Wales PR teams also won
one silver and three gold awards at the CIPR’s regional PRide awards, including the Grand
Prix for best overall campaign in Wales. 
Management
The Group has an integrated management team, many of whom benefit from a broad
business experience. Senior managers from each division meet with the executive
directors and group managers on a regular basis to discuss strategy, operational issues and
marketing and new business.
The Group team is responsible for finance and accounts, IT , human resources, corporate
communications, acquisitions and group marketing.  The Group also plays a co-ordinating
role on new business, particularly in relation to cross-selling and the ‘combined’ selling of
regional and specialist services.
All staff are incentivised through bonus schemes and share options.  In addition, a number
of senior managers hold shares by virtue of having been principals of acquired businesses
and some have also purchased shares.  
The Board and management are committed to building shareholder value. In 2006-07
basic earnings per share increased 58 per cent from 6.10p to 9.66p.
Outlook
Our markets remain buoyant and our strategy of offering an integrated PR and marketing
service across all our offices has helped win new business and increase the range of client
needs we can meet. 
Our strong cash position also means we are well placed to make further acquisitions in line
with the Group’s strategy outlined above.  
T rading in the first quarter of 2007-08 is in line with expectations and we expect to deliver
another progressive trading performance in the current financial year.

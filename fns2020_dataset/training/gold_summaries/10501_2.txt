Our Financial Highlights

1. The financial highlights relate to the Adjusted Income Statement covering the years 
ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 assuming a debt free acquisition of 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by Moneysupermarket.com Group 
PLC on 1 January 2006, from which date intangible amortisation commenced, and a 
share option charge which reflects the average charge over the vesting period of 
currently unexercised options. Further information on the Adjusted Income Statement 
is set out in the Financial and Business Review on page 22.
2. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by the Directors by making certain adjustments to the 
historical compensation levels of the Directors and senior managers, and share 
based bonus awards to employees on the listing of Moneysupermarket.com Group 
PLC. These adjustments reflect the Directors’ and senior managers’ profit share, 
discretionary bonus and related employer’s national insurance contributions. They 
also include charges relating to the issue of free shares to each eligible employee to 
the value of £3,000, charges relating to the conditional share award made to Gerald 
Corbett on listing and charges related to share based compensation relating to 
options issued prior to listing. Following listing, these elements of compensation no 
longer apply at these levels. Charges relating to the impairment of goodwill in 2008 
have also been added back to calculate adjusted EBITDA. For further information,

3.  As noted in the prospectus issued in connection with the listing of 
Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC on 31 July 2007, the Group’s visitor numbers 
during the period between January and May 2007 were understated due to certain 
visitors not being assigned a unique global user ID. The issue was resolved in May 
2007 and has not impacted visitor numbers in the Insurance vertical after May 2007. 
The Group has not been able to quantify the exact extent of the understatement.
 The Group recorded a substantial increase in its reported visitors from 27 April 2008 
to the end of June 2008 following a release made in respect of the anti-virus 
software AVG. In assessing whether a webpage was safe it ‘followed’ every link or 
url displayed on an email or webpage to the destination website. This meant that 
many web based businesses including the Group recorded visitors from users of the 
AVG software who themselves did not technically visit the website. The 2008 visitor 
count has been adjusted for the estimated impact of this. AVG released a further 
update to its anti-virus software in early July 2008.

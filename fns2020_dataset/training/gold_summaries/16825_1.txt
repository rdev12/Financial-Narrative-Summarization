Volex plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Our performance this year was 
disappointing. Group revenues were 
down 9% to $473.2m from $517 .8m whilst 
normalised gross margin was 18.0%, 
1.8 percentage points lower than FY2012. 
A combination of factors including weaker 
markets, particularly in consumer 
electronics and the telecoms sectors, 
and delays in new customer programme 
launches contributed to the poor result.
Our markets 
We operate in four market sectors. 
Customers in our Consumer sector 
manufacture a wide range of electronic 
devices and electrical appliances, 
including PCs, laptops, TVs, games 
consoles and kitchen equipment. They 
increasingly choose high quality global 
suppliers who can help them satisfy the 
demand for increasingly sophisticated 
next-generation products.
Our Telecoms/Datacoms solutions address 
the need for increasing rates of high 
volume data transmission. Customers 
include manufacturers of equipment for 
telecoms networks, datacentres and high 
performance computing. With burgeoning 
demand for internet services accessible 
via mobile devices, increased data speeds 
are essential and these customers seek 
outstanding quality of manufacture 
coupled with high performance – at 
a competitive price. 
The Healthcare sector is characterised by 
extended product development cycles 
and long product lifetimes. Customers 
seek long term relationships with suppliers 
and include manufacturers of critical 
equipment including imaging, diagnostics 
and patient monitoring systems. Ageing 
populations and an increased emphasis 
on early diagnosis and monitoring are 
driving the market, along with a growing 
demand for sophisticated healthcare 
services from developing economies.
Our Industrial sector includes a range 
of segments including vehicle telematics, 
solar power installations and robotics 
for manufacturing. The constant push 
for greater productivity and increased 
efﬁciency is driving growth in both 
telematics and manufacturing automation. 
Our performance
Despite signiﬁcant revenue growth of 35% 
with our largest customer, total Consumer 
revenue was down 6% compared to last 
year as many of our customers suffered 
from the downturn in consumer electronic 
spend. The normalised gross margin was 
down by 3.2% to 14.7% largely as a result 
of a ramp up in manufacturing capability 
in the ﬁrst half of FY2013, for which the 
expected revenues did not materialise. 
These surplus costs were then removed 
during the second half of FY2013. 
In our Telecoms/Datacoms sector, lower 
spend from telecoms operators in 
response to ongoing economic uncertainty 
impacted revenue. We did however, 
experience good growth in datacoms, 
from high speed copper products and 
our new passive optical engagements. 
This mix change helped normalised gross 
margin in the Telecoms/Datacoms sector 
increase to 23.7%, from 21.2% in FY2012.

Volex plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Business review In our Healthcare sector, revenues were 
down 9% compared to last year. This was 
principally due to customer destocking 
programmes and delays in new product 
launches. However, normalised gross 
margin for the Healthcare sector remained 
stable. 
Industrial revenues decreased as our 
customers – particularly in transportation 
– reduced their capital expenditure. 
Normalised gross margin also slipped, 
due to the operating leverage effect of 
absorbing ﬁxed overheads over reduced 
revenues. Certain test and measurement 
programmes usually supplied by Volex 
also experienced delays during the year. 
Business improvement 
initiatives
We took swift action to address the trading 
conditions that we faced in FY2013 and to 
maximise Volex’s longer term growth 
potential. Our efforts so far have been 
focused on four principal areas:
1. Stringent cost control
During FY2013, we have conducted a 
signiﬁcant cost reduction programme 
to align our cost base with customer 
demand. We had a signiﬁcant increase in 
our headcount in anticipation of enhanced 
sales volumes. When these volumes did 
not materialise, we moved swiftly to initiate 
a programme that was group-wide and 
cross-function.
The restructuring was broken down 
into three key areas:
 – Direct/indirect labour – removal of the 
headcount that had been brought in 
to support the enhanced volumes 
that failed to materialise; 
 – Sales – an entire restructuring of the 
sales force was carried out to better 
align our sales support services with 
our key accounts and to identify new 
business opportunities; 
 – Back ofﬁce support – a full review 
of the back ofﬁce support functions 
was performed. Where roles were 
duplicated or could be ﬁlled through 
internal promotion at a reduced cost, 
the programme sought to eliminate 
the excess expenditure.
As a result, Group-wide stafﬁng levels 
have dropped from their peak in H1 of 
9,750 to 7 ,300 by year end.
The cost of the programme totalled 
$7 .2m in FY2013, principally in relation to 
employee severance costs, associated 
consultancy costs and asset write downs. 
The cash cost in FY2013 of the programme 
was $5.7m. The estimated annual savings 
from the programme total approximately 
$17 .5m when compared to our ﬁrst half peak, 
primarily arising from the headcount savings.

2. Improving operational efﬁciency 
across the organisation
Through the introduction of a number of 
operational initiatives in the second half 
of the year, we have made signiﬁcant 
progress in improving our operational 
efﬁciency. These initiatives include: 
 – New production processes such as 
3P (Production, Preparation, Process) 
and the Volex Production System;
 – Ongoing LEAN manufacturing 
technique application;
 – Upgrades to our primary 
manufacturing site in Shenzhen; and
 – Roll-out of new precision moulding 
and tooling equipment.
As a result of these actions, scrap rates 
have reduced by 42% from 3.6% during 
the ﬁrst half of FY2013 to 2.1% by year end. 
Similarly labour initiatives have helped 
offset minimum wage inﬂationary pressure 
in our manufacturing territories.
During FY2013 we completed an extensive 
upgrade of our Shenzhen manufacturing 
plant in China at a cost of $12.8m. 
Approximately $10m of this spend was on 
new equipment. This investment provides 
18,000 sqm of upgraded manufacturing 
space and 12,000 sqm of warehousing. 
We have also expanded our plant at 
Batam, Indonesia, at a cost of $6m, 
creating an improved manufacturing 
facility to enhance our global 
manufacturing capability and better 
serve our worldwide customer base. 
Construction at Batam is due to complete 
in July 2013 with a further $1.8m of 
construction costs forecast to be incurred. 
Production at this expanded site 
commenced in April 2013.
During FY2013, we made good progress in 
rightsizing our business with customer 
demand, making signiﬁcant operating cost 
reductions. In FY2014, we will consider our 
manufacturing and distribution footprint 
to ensure that they are even closer aligned 
with our customer needs.
3. Strengthening senior sales leadership 
and improving the effectiveness of the 
sales organisation
To provide the cabling and interconnect 
solutions our customers require, we need 
to better understand the problems they 
face. To this end we are working hard to 
forge deep customer relationships so that 
we may align ourselves more closely with 
our key customers; engaging with them 
earlier in their product development 
lifecycles and acquiring a deeper 
knowledge of their businesses, ensuring 
that we are designed-in to long term 
product cycles. 
During the year, Roger Wendelken was 
appointed Senior Vice President, Sales 
& Marketing. Roger has overseen a 
restructuring of the sales function with 
a move towards a key account structure. 
This has been supplemented by enhanced 
integration of our sales and engineering 
teams to create a New Business 
Development function. 
Furthermore, Karen Slatford has assumed 
the role of Deputy Chairman. Karen has 
supported Roger in his new role and has 
provided valuable guidance in developing 
the new sales structure.
We believe this structure will make 
Volex more agile and responsive to our 
customers’ needs and will improve our 
forecasting ability. Already we have 
seen success through this new structure 
with new business wins in the 
Healthcare sector.

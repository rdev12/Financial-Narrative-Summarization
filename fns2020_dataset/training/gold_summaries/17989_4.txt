disposal of assets, exceptional items, M&A costs,  
and the charge relating to Continuation Option Plan 
shares awarded as part of the IPO.
2  Occupancy excludes fostering placements which  
are reported separately.
3  Adjusted basic EPS is defined as statutory basic EPS, 
adding back the impact of amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, exceptional items, M&A costs, and  
the charge relating to Continuation Option Plan shares 
awarded as part of the IPO, net of the tax effect of these 
adjustments. All Adjusted EPS calculations reflect the 
number of shares in issue post IPO (excluding shares 
held in the Employee Benefits Trust) of 168,888,888.

Roll out of specialist  
personality disorder services
In 2015 we opened 48 places in three 
hospitals for adults with a personality 
disorder. We are now a leading provider 
of personality disorder services in the UK. 
 
Greater specialisation and 
move to higher acuity services 
In response to customer demands, we 
are increasing the focus of our services 
on specific conditions (for example in 
Adult Autism and Children’s Learning 
Disabilities), and continue to move to 
higher acuity services (for example 
expanding our offering for children who 
have suffered from neglect or abuse). 
 
By the Bridge, delivering  
on our strategic objective  
to grow our fostering 
capability for higher  
severity children
With our customers preferring a family 
setting where possible for looked after 
children, fostering has been a focus  
for Cambian. With a strong reputation  
for supporting children with high 
severity needs, By the Bridge has 
significantly increased Cambian’s 
capability in this area.
 
Added 321 net places to  
the Group in 2015
We have increased the capacity of the 
Group by over 12% in the year. We now 
have a total capacity of 2,989 places 
which we expect to mature over  
the next 18 months, providing the 
opportunity for growth in revenue  
and profits over the period.

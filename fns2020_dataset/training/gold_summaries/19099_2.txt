CURRENT TRADING
•  Group like-for-like* sales, including VAT, in the first seven weeks of the new financial year are 
up 7.5%.
•  Hire has seen an upturn in bookings to date for the 2015 wedding season, and the business is in 
excellent shape to build market share, following a difficult two years.
Commenting on the results and outlook, Brian Brick, Chief Executive Officer, said:
“We continue to make good progress in the delivery of our strategic priorities. The modernisation of the 
store portfolio is achieving the anticipated returns and we have exciting plans for the implementation of 
our multi-channel shopping environment. The adoption of the master brand “Moss Bros” and launch of 
our sub brands in Autumn 2014 have improved the resonance the brand has with current and potential 
customers of all age groups.
The early response to the 2015 Spring/Summer retail range is positive, and retail like-for-like* sales are 
continuing to improve year on year. Hire is showing signs of recovery and we are well placed to maximise 
revenues in 2015 following a difficult two years for wedding related hire.
The Group’s trading performance continues positively, in line with the Board’s expectations.”

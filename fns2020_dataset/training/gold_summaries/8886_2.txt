to satisfactory levels. We continue to use 
excess cash to reduce the Group’s debt 
and, as required under our financing 
arrangements, no dividend is proposed  
for the year. 
Our industry has once more been in the 
spotlight with the publication of the Leveson 
Report. We support the principle of effective 
redress for complaints relating to the local 
press and the efforts of the industry to put  
in place a new system of self-regulation 
without resorting to legislation which could 
potentially burden a fragile sector with 
crippling costs. 
At the end of March, Danny Cammiade, 
who has served as our Chief Operating 
Officer since 2005, will step down. Danny 
started his career with TR Beckett which 
became part of Johnston Press in 1992 
and has over 35 years of experience in the 
newspaper industry. He leaves with our 
thanks for his work over that time and we 
wish him well for the future. In accordance 
with best practice, all of our continuing 
Board will stand for re-election at our 
Annual General Meeting on 26 April.
I am satisfied that our Board remains 
effective and it regularly reviews both  
the balance of its membership and the 
issues which it considers when it meets.  
Its meetings are structured to scrutinise 
both strategic and operational matters in  
an atmosphere of constructive challenge  
and debate. A key feature of our Board’s 
effectiveness is our programme of site  
visits for all of our Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board once again wishes to convey 
its gratitude to our employees whose hard 
work has been essential in overcoming  
the challenges we have faced. Their 
commitment to the quality of our products 
has been remarkable during a period of 
great change and difficult trading conditions. 
The outlook for the economies of the UK 
and Republic of Ireland and our markets  
is still challenging. That only serves to 
highlight the need for innovation in our 
business to continue. We believe that the 
opportunity is there to do so successfully 
and return Johnston Press to growth.

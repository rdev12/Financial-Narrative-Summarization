Business review
The	 Company	 sells	 software	 in	 a	
market	 niche	 that	 provides	 mould	 and	
die	 makers	 with	 the	 ability	 to	 design,	
simulate,	 plan,	 cost	 and	 machine	
their	 products	 across	 a	 wide	 range	
of	 sectors	 including	 automotive,	
aerospace,	 electronic,	 medical,	 toys	
and	 household	 goods.	 Last	 year,	 all	
of	 these	 sectors	 suffered	 some	 lack	
of	 confidence	 but	 sales	 continued	
to	 those	 looking	 to	 cut	 costs	 and	
improve	 productivity	 through	 software	
that	 reduced	 the	 resources	 required	 to	
produce	 the	 necessary	 moulds	
and	 dies.
The	 downturn	 was	 not	 spread	 evenly	
through	 the	 regions	 and	 while	 sales	
in	 Japan	 and	 Italy	 fell	 with	 respect	 to	
2008,	 those	 in	 North	 America,	 France	
and	 UK	 all	 grew.	 Even	 among	 the	
sectors	 supplied	 the	 effects	 were	
relatively	 unpredictable,	 with	 plastic	
based	 products	 doing	 less	 well	 than	
sheet	 metal,	 whilst	 software	 used	
solely	 by	 the	 automotive	 sector	
surprisingly	 grew	 substantially.
The	 worst	 hit	 sectors	 were	 those	
associated	 with	 machine	 tools,	
where	 worldwide	 investment	 in	 both	
machines	 and	 software	 were	 very	 low	
causing	 some	 of	 the	 major	 machine	
tool	 producing	 countries	 to	 initiate	 new	
incentives.
Software	 maintenance	 and	 service	
revenues	 held	 up	 well	 as	 a	 result	
of	 many	 customers	 relying	 on	 the	
productivity	 improvements	 brought	
in	 through	 new	 releases	 and	 the	
expertise	 of	 the	 product	 support.
Operating expenses
As	 a	 result	 of	 the	 anticipated	 fall	 in	
revenue,	 the	 Company	 took	 swift	
action	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 2009	 to	
reduce	 budgeted	 operating	 costs.	
This	 was	 later	 supplemented	 by	 a	
temporary	 reduction	 in	 personnel	
costs,	 mostly	 through	 short	 time	
working	 during	 the	 summer	 and	
autumn	 periods.	 Tight	 control	 of	
expenditure	 led	 to	 a	 13%	 reduction	 in	
selling	 expenses	 before	 exceptional	
items.	 Administrative	 expenses	 rose	
by	 7%	 but	 this	 was	 largely	 as	 a	 result	
of	 exchange	 rate	 movements,	 with	 the	
underlying	 administrative	 costs	 in	 local	
currency	 lower	 than	 in	 2008.
Product development
Product	 development	 expenditure	
of	 £1,303,000	 has	 been	 capitalised	
(2008:	 £1,008,000)	 in	 accordance	
with	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	
Standards.	 The	 Board	 strongly	
believes	 that	 the	 continued	 investment	
in	 product	 development	 is	 fundamental	
to	 current	 software	 sales,	 future	
growth	 and	 customer	 loyalty.
The	 product	 solutions	 are	 increasingly	
being	 applied	 to	 the	 whole	 process	
relating	 to	 mould	 and	 die	 production	
and	 from	 product	 design	 and	 planning	
to	 mould	 performance	 analysis,	
building	 and	 precision	 machining.
Taxation and earnings per share
Earnings	 before,	 interest,	 tax,	
depreciation	 and	 amortisation	
(EBITDA)	 were	 £2.0m,	 an	 increase	
of	 10%	 compared	 to	 the	 previous	
year	 (2008:	 £1.8m).	 The	 Group	
also	 recorded	 a	 pre-tax	 profit	 after	
exceptionals	 of	 £0.6m	 (2008:	 £.0.9m).	
This	 reduction	 was	 mainly	 a	 result	 of	
increased	 amortisation	 charges	 and	 an

exceptional	 write	 down	 of	 a	 property.	
The	 Group	 received	 a	 net	 tax	 credit	 of	
£0.13m	 (2008:	 £0.07m	 charge).	 The	
tax	 credit	 has	 arisen	 mainly	 because	
of	 research	 and	 development	 tax	
credits	 received	 in	 Italy	 and	 the	 UK.	
Exceptional	 costs	 of	 £201,000	 (2008:	
£445,000)	 were	 incurred	 during	 the	
year.	 These	 included	 redundancy	
costs	 of	 £46,000,	 a	 £26,000	 provision	
for	 an	 onerous	 lease	 and	 £129,000	
exceptional	 depreciation	 relating	 to	
the	 write	 down	 of	 a	 property.	 Post	 tax	
profit	 after	 exceptionals	 was	 £0.74m	
(2008:	 £0.85m)	 and	 basic	 earnings	 per	
share	 were	 2.00p	 (2008:	 2.28p).
Cash flow and net funds
Cash	 flows	 from	 operating	 activities	 in	
2009	 were	 £1.7m	 compared	 to	 £1.9m	
in	 2008.	 The	 cash	 balances	 at	 the	
year	 end	 were	 £2.3m	 (2008:	 £1.6m),	
with	 £1.5m	 of	 short-term	 borrowings	
(2008:	 £1.5m),	 resulting	 in	 net	 funds	
of	 £0.87m	 (2008:	 £0.09m).	 Net	 debt	
reduced	 to	 £2.2m	 from	 £2.9m.	 The	
Company	 completed	 a	 refinancing	 of	
its	 UK	 loans	 in	 December	 2009	 with	 an	
advance	 of	 £2m	 from	 the	 Capital	 for	
Enterprise	 Fund.	 These	 funds	 were
used	 to	 repay	 the	 Group’s	 outstanding	
balances	 with	 Fortis	 Bank	 and	 restore	
working	 capital	 levels	 to	 pre-recession	
levels.
Interest	 payments	 during	 the	 year	 were	
£159,000	 (2008:	 £213,000).
Summary
The	 Company	 proved	 to	 be	 fairly	
resilient	 to	 a	 strong	 global	 recession	
through	 its	 hallmarks	 of	 technological	
innovation,	 customer	 support	 and	
repeat	 transactions.	
2009	 was	 a	 predictably	 difficult	 year	
for	 trading	 but	 the	 Company	 managed	
to	 broadly	 reduce	 its	 costs	 in	 line	 with	
revenues,	 in	 a	 timely	 fashion,	 so	 as	 to	
maintain	 profitability	 and	 cash	 flow.
A	 number	 of	 product	 improvements	
have	 still	 to	 come	 on	 stream	 in	 2010	
and	 these	 should	 provide	 further	
draught-proofing	 against	 the	 cold	 wind	
of	 recessionary	 times.

This has been an exceptional year for MITIE. We have continued our
track record and delivered an impressive set of results, completed our
largest ever acquisition and won a series of new and exciting contracts
across a number of emerging and established markets. With a clear
corporate strategy, we are extremely well placed for the future.
Chairman’s
Statement
MITIE provides a comprehensive range of support
services to both public and private sector 
clients in the UK. We will build on our success by
further strengthening the range of services we 
offer and by providing service excellence for 
all our customers. 
MITIE has achieved 19 years of consecutive
revenue, profit and dividend growth and now
employs over 39,000 staff. Our success is testament
to the Group’s unique culture, which motivates both
management and staff to grow the business by
concentrating on the needs of our customers. 
The dedication of our employees, our core skills in
managing and motivating a large and diverse
workforce, and our passion to support our customers
is a real and valuable differentiator in the marketplace.
On behalf of the Board I would like to welcome the
employees of our acquired companies to the
Group and thank everyone in MITIE for their
contribution to our success and their hard work 
over the financial year.

Security Ltd our largest acquisition to date. 
Secondly, and in accordance with our unique
business model, we purchased the minority interests
in seven MITIE businesses for a total purchase
consideration of £9.4m. 
Three of our external acquisitions were in the security
sector, an area we have been strategically targeting,
and saw us purchase:
• Initial Security Ltd, the UK manned guarding
business of Rentokil Initial, for £70.8m (including
repayment of debt) in March 2006; 
• The Watch Security Ltd, a provider of manned
guarding and electronic security solutions in the
Midlands, for £8.0m in June 2005; and

Supplying gallery attendants to museums is a special niche in the security market.
Attendants do not t play a ‘traditional’ security role, but are employed predominantly 
to be on hand to enhance the vi isitors’ experience, providing information and
assistance in exhibition halls. The number of attendants needed at a museum is
subject to fluctuation and dependent on the type and scale of exhibition, which
means that MITIE may need to provide anywhere between three and 33 assistants
from day to day a at Tate Britain. We have been doing so since 1995, because we are
able to provide the right calibre o of attendant and value of service to meet the
customer’s needs and demonstrate exceptional flexibilit ty.

Being part of the unique concept of bringing together a primary, secondary and
special needs school in one campus to enable the teaching of 1,400 students, 
was not only an exciting development for Da arlington and its local community, but 
for MITIE and the future of national education. We mobilised  the 25-year contract 
to deliver FM services in September 2005, partnering with our client to provid de 
better educational facilities for children and improved sustainable assets for local
communities. . With 40 employees on site we are responsible for a full range of 
FM services including helpdesk, c cleaning, catering, M&E maintenance, security and
grounds maintenance, as well as for the lifecycle m maintenance of all of the buildings.
MITIE was selected because we were able to provide the managemen nt and services
needed to support the facilities and property infrastructure.

Chairman’s Statement continued
These acquisitions have transformed our Security
business into a strong nationwide operation which is
now ranked as the UK’s second largest provider of
manned guarding. The integration of the businesses
is on plan. We are confident that our Security
business has considerable potential for the future.
Lyndhurst Services Ltd, a provider of external
grounds maintenance to commercial property 
sites across the UK, was also acquired by MITIE. 
The purchase of this company in February 2006, 
for £8.8m, has added to MITIE’s regional coverage in
the landscaping market and has been an important
development in our strategy of growing that business.
Board changes
There have been a number of changes to the MITIE
Group PLC Board. Ruby McGregor-Smith, previously
Group Finance Director, was appointed Chief
Operating Officer in September 2005, while 
Suzanne Baxter was appointed Group Finance
Director, following the year end, in April 2006. 
David Jenkins and Ishbel Macpherson have both
joined the Board as Non-Executive Directors during
the period, bringing with them considerable
financial and professional experience. Manish
Chande has retired from the Board as Non-Executive
Director after four years of service. I would like to
thank him on behalf of the Board for his valuable
contribution to the development of the Group.
Pensions
In March 2006, the Group made a one-off
contribution of £7.8m to eliminate the actuarial
deficit on the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme. 
This is the Group’s principal defined benefit pension
scheme and is now closed to new entrants. 
Corporate Governance 
The Board recognises its responsibilities in terms 
of ensuring that MITIE achieves high standards 
of Corporate Governance and conducts itself
appropriately in order to protect the interests 
of all MITIE stakeholders.
Corporate Responsibility 
This year we are acting to improve our communication
with MITIE stakeholders on matters concerning
corporate responsibility. We are therefore publishing
a separate report, that will also be available on our
corporate website, which expands further on the
areas already covered in this Annual Report. The
report will look in more detail at how MITIE motivates
and looks after its people, relates to the community,
works with charities and behaves in relation to our
environmental responsibilities. 
Outlook
MITIE has a solid track record in developing a
profitable business and it is our strategy to 
ensure that this continues. We will seek to grow
further organically and will make acquisitions 
within our chosen markets when appropriate
opportunities arise. 
We will continue managing our business in a manner
which facilitates sustainable growth and delivers
service excellence for our customers. We are
developing national coverage across the portfolio
of services we provide, which will enhance our
ability to work with customers across many sites
providing multiple services. 
The support services market is increasingly looking
for companies who are able to offer a wide range
of services with their own workforce and we are
clearly benefiting from that trend. As a result of this
we expect significant contract opportunities 
which, when combined with the energy and
commitment of our employees, will ensure MITIE 
will continue to prosper. 
We are well positioned for future growth.

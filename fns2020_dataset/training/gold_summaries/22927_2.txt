Non-GAAP measures
The Board believes that whilst statutory reporting measures provide a useful indication of the financial 
performance of the Group, additional insight is gained by excluding certain non-recurring or non-trading 
transactions. These measures are defined as follows:
(a)
Underlying profit is calculated as profit excluding profit (or loss) on sale of fixed assets and external 
transaction costs.
(b)
Underlying earnings per share is calculated as profit on ordinary activities after taxation, before profit 
(or loss) on sale of fixed assets and external transaction costs and exceptional items (all net of tax), divided 
by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue in the period.
(c)
Cash generated from operations excludes external transaction costs.
Other notes
(d)
Interim dividend represents the interim dividend that was declared and paid in the period out of earnings
generated in the same period.
(e)
The final dividend represents the final dividend that was declared and paid in the period relating to the 
earnings generated in the previous period.

A CONSISTENT TRACK RECORD
Our consistent track record in strong cash generation and
financial discipline enables us to reinvest and grow the
business both organically and by strategic acquisition.
We generate revenues from new and returning clients and by
carefully acquiring businesses that complement our network
of locations, extend our geographic reach and represent a
reasonable return on our capital.
We control and measure growth by making well informed
decisions, supported by careful risk management and 
good governance.
Our business is driven by relatively predictable factors over 
long periods of time. This allows us to operate and fund our
business in a way that generates value over the long-term.

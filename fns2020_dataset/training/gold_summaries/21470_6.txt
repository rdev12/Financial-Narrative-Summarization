Investment Business
Georgia Healthcare 
Group (GHG) 
A long-term, high-growth 
investment story 
 
GHG is the largest healthcare 
services and medical insurance 
provider operating in the 
fast-growing, predominantly 
privately owned, Georgian 
healthcare market, which is 
characterised by low utilisation 
and high fragmentation, leaving 
significant room for medium 
to long-term growth. Our 
healthcare services business 
had a 26.6% market share as 
of 31 December 2015, with 
2,670 hospital beds and it 
has the widest geographic 
coverage among its peers with 
facilities located in six regions 
that contain three-quarters 
of the population of Georgia. 
GHG is also the largest 
medical insurer in Georgia with 
a 38.4% market share as of 
31 December 2015, based on 
revenue and with approximately 
234,000 people holding 
GHG’s medical insurance 
policies as of 31 December 
2015. In November 2015, 
GHG completed an initial 
public offering on the premium 
segment of the London Stock 
Exchange (GHG:LN). BGEO 
holds a 65% stake in GHG 
as of the date of this report.

Georgian Global 
Utilities (GGU) 
Major utility and energy 
company, with more 
efficiency and clear growth 
opportunities
GGU, in which we acquired 
a 25% minority interest in 
December 2014, has two 
main business lines - water 
utility and electric power 
generation—and is a major 
player on both markets. In its 
water utility business, GGU 
is a natural monopoly that 
supplies water and provides 
a wastewater service to 1.4 
million people (approximately 
one-third of Georgia’s 
population) in three cities: 
Tbilisi, Mtskheta and Rustavi. 
In electric power business, 
GGU owns and operates three 
hydropower generation facilities 
with a total capacity of 143MW. 
Generated power is primarily 
used by GGU’s water business, 
with the excess amount of 
generated capacity sold to third 
parties. GGU posted EBITDA 
of GEL 63.2 million in 2015. 
Since 2014, BGEO Group put 
in place a strong management 
team and streamlined 
operations, however we see 
room for further improvement. 
Teliani Valley  
Creating a leading 
beverages producer and 
distributor in Caucasus 
We operate the largest 
wine business in Georgia, 
Teliani, where we have a 71% 
shareholding. Teliani has a 
strong existing franchise, being 
a leading wine producer with 
a wide distribution platform. 
Teliani sells 3 million bottles 
of wine annually, with 60% of 
sales coming from exports.

franchise of distribution, 
Teliani is currently expanding 
into a new business line 
of beer and soft beverage 
production, with ten-year 
exclusivity from Heineken to

Armenia and Azerbaijan 
– a total population of 17 
million people. With strong 
management team and a

Chief Executive’s Review
Michael Laurier
The Group successfully completed an important 
phase in its long term d
2
w development plan 
and no longer requires the same level of 
investment, time and overhead cost to realise 
the full sales potential for this technology. 
d
2
w® – Controlled-life Plastic 
Technology
Symphony d
2
w technology is known 
globally as an important technology 
and credible brand that is helping 
governments deal with the issue of 
plastic pollution and litter without the 
need to ban plastic products. d
2
w 
has been trialled and tested over a 
long period of time by a wide range 
of organisations. It is the only 
oxo-biodegradable technology that 
has a complete set of sustainable 
credentials, namely, Life Cycle 
Assessment (“LCA”), Eco-label, 
Millennium Product, Eco-Toxicity, 
Bio-degradation, Recycling and 
membership to the important trade 
body, The Oxo-biodegradable Plastic 
Association (“OPA”).
Consistent with previous years, the 
range of d
2
w masterbatches and 
products represented the majority 
of the Group’s revenues in 2015. 
Towards the year end it became 
clear that costs and investments 
could be reduced or even eliminated 
as the business had achieved one of 
its primary objectives, namely to 
create demand through positive 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
(“CSR”) credentials and legislative 
drivers. It was also clear that sales 
should grow from the many ongoing 
and established relationships and 
projects. The main drivers for d
2
w 
technology have been: organisations 
that need a low cost, easy to 
change, pragmatic solution to 
improve their CSR and 
environmental credentials, and 
governments that urgently needed 
to resolve the many issues created 
by plastic litter on land and in the 
oceans, and without materially 
increasing the cost of packaging or 
risk to food and health. The 
legislative drive in support of our 
d
2
w biodegradable type technology 
is continuing albeit mostly outside of 
Europe and the USA where recycling 
and litter collection are well-
developed and where they do not 
have the same level of issues created 
by litter that impact the less 
developed nations. The Board has 
started to see slow, but gradual 
enforcement of laws aimed at 
encouraging or enforcing the use of 
oxo-biodegradable plastic in a 
number of developing nations. 
d
2
p™ – Technology that is  
designed to protect
Symphony’s product diversification 
and expansion strategy is being 
driven under the umbrella of the d
2
p 
brand, which is gaining momentum 
in many applications within the 
global distribution network.
Symphony continues its investment 
into creating intellectual property for 
the growing number of d
2
p products. 
Some of these technologies require 
certification or regulatory clearance 
before commercial use, and some 
do not. Customer trials have been 
ongoing for a number of years 
and some have been initiated in 
the period under review. From 
these, a number of trials have 
completed successfully with initial 
modest sales being achieved. 
Moving forward, given the stage 
of development now reached for 
the d
2
p range of technologies, the 
level of investment required on an 
ongoing operating basis is expected 
to be less than in previous periods. 
Due to confidentiality, details  
cannot be provided at this stage 
other than to say that these projects 
cover several countries and industry 
sectors. In particular, the business 
has one major project at contract 
negotiation phase after the 
completion of successful trials  
over the past 18 months. 
Trading results
Group revenues were marginally 
higher at £6.37 million (2014: £6.35 
million) albeit with a reduced gross 
profit margin at 46.0% from 49.8% 
in 2014. The contribution from 
gross profit was also reduced at 
£2.93 million versus £3.16 million in 
FY14. The fall in gross margin was 
driven by a less profitable sales mix 
during the back end of the year 
and a year-end stock impairment 
provision of £0.08 million. 
Recurring administrative expenses 
increased by 12.9% to £3.68 million 
(2014: £3.26 million) due to an 
increase in R&D and marketing 
costs together with an increase 
in the receivables impairment 
provision of £0.12 million. Non-
recurring administrative expense 
of £1.31 million were incurred in 
2015 (2014: £nil) which included a 
£1.28 million impairment charge 
relating to development cost within 
intangible fixed assets, and £0.03 
million relating to staff adjustments, 
following the strategic review. Symphony Environmental Technologies plc

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BUSINESS REVIEW
07
Including non-recurring items, the 
Group made an operating loss of 
£2.29 million in 2015 compared to  
an operating loss of £0.27 million in 
2014. This resulted in a loss before 
tax of £2.30 million in 2015 (2014: 
loss £0.39 million). 
Excluding non-recurring items,  
the Group made an EBITDA loss of  
£0.84 million in 2015 (2014: loss  
£0.14 million) with an operating loss 
of £0.97 million (2014: loss £0.27 
million). The increase in loss was due 
to marketing and R&D cost increases, 
together with the impairment 
provisions against receivables and 
stock as detailed above.
Included within the taxation charge 
of £1.03 million (2014: tax credit 
£0.09 million) is a deferred tax asset 
impairment of £1.14 million (2014: 
£nil) following the strategic review, 
together with an R&D tax credit of 
£0.11 million (2014: £0.09 million). 
The Group therefore reports a loss 
for the year of £3.33 million (2014: 
loss £0.31 million) with basic loss per 
share of 2.26 pence (2014: loss per 
share 0.23 pence). 
The Group’s primary selling currency 
is the US Dollar. The Group had no 
contractual hedging instruments at 
the end of 2015 and self-hedges 
where possible by purchasing in US 
Dollars, and has banking facilities in 
place in order to secure rates going 
forward. As at 31 December 2015 the 
Group had a net balance of US 
Dollar assets totalling $0.82 million 
(2014: $0.64 million). A majority of 
the Group’s revenue is in US Dollars 
and accordingly, a strong dollar is 
beneficial for the Group.
Segmental analysis
The Group operates two business 
divisions being the Plastics Division 
(Symphony Environmental Limited 
or “SEL ”) and the Recycling 
Technologies division (Symphony 
Recycling Limited or “SRT”). Within 
SEL there are two operating 
segments; “Plastics Sales” which 
generate and maintain revenues 
relating to plastic additives, 
masterbatches and finished 
products, and “Plastics R&D” which 
includes all new product 
development and research 
expenditure.
Plastics Sales, which represent all 
Group sales, generated an EBITDA 
loss of £0.35 million (2014: profit 
£0.48 million). This loss compared to 
the previous year was the result of 
significantly increased marketing 
spend, together with the asset 
provisions detailed above. Plastics 
R&D incurred an EBITDA loss of 
£0.52 million (2014: £0.41 million).
SRT has no revenues to date and 
incurred a small amount of 
maintenance expenditure in 2015.  
In 2014 SRT had incurred costs of 
£0.22 million. The Board’s strategy  
is to commercialise SRT with an 
appropriate partner when identified. 
Cash flow
The Group generated cash of  
£0.03 million from operations  
(2014: cash used £0.10 million).  
The Group has a £1 million trade 
finance facility with HSBC Bank plc 
of which £0.16 million was drawn 
down as at 31 December 2015 (2014: 
£0.15 million). 
The Group had net cash in the bank 
of £0.12 million at the year-end 
(2014: £0.59 million), with trade 
receivables of £0.72 million (2014: 
£1.27 million) and continues to work 
comfortably within its banking 
facilities.
Outlook
The results for 2015 reflect the 
continued investment phases for 
both our d
2
w and d
2
p technologies, 
and we have now set a much lower 
operating cost basis for the business 
going forward. The business is 
transitioning away from product 
development activities that required 
capital for long-term returns and is 
now moving towards a stronger 
focus on shorter-term 
commercialisation and sales 
opportunities.
Sales for the first quarter of 2016 are 
8% higher than for the same period 
last year, and on a conservative basis 
for the full year the Board expects to 
achieve moderate sales growth 
whilst maintaining gross margins. In 
addition, the Board expects 
operating costs for the full year 2016 
to be approximately £750,000 
lower than 2015. 
The Board considers the longer 
term sales prospects for both d
2
p 
and d
2
w as being positive as a 
result of the new d
2
p technologies 
being capable of commercialisation, 
and for d
2
w, where there is 
enforcement of legislative changes.
The Group has been working  
for some time on a number of 
high-profile projects for both its 
technologies and the Board believe 
these are progressing well, although 
it should be noted that no certainty 
of success can be provided at  
this stage. 
I am pleased to confirm that the 
Group has sufficient working capital 
to execute its strategy and to 
complete its short to medium-term 
objectives. As an operationally 
geared business, now running with  
a significantly lower cost base, the 
Board looks forward to a financially 
more successful year in 2016.

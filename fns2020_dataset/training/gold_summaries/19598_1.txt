REPORT
Introduction
In a successful period of new acquisitions, 
capital raising and organic growth, Sirius is 
pleased to report a strong twelve months 
of trading. The Group continues to measure 
its success in asset management through 
total returns generated by both increased 
income returns and improvement in capital 
returns. In this financial year, Sirius saw its 
recurring profit before tax increase by 26% 
on a like-for-like basis of the pre-acquisitions 
portfolio, driven largely by increased rental 
income across the board. Adjusted NAV per 
share has also seen a like-for-like increase 
of 10.5% during the year, after adjusting 
for the December 2014 equity raise and 
is now 47.5c as at 31 March 2015. Total 
NAV return, including dividends paid, was 
13.0%. Whilst this is a positive movement, 
we believe there remains further scope to 
improve the value of the Group’s portfolio 
of assets through the Group’s investment 
and asset management initiatives. This has 
been a significant contributor to the Group 
trading at a stronger share price, but the 
shares also appear to be benefiting from 
greater liquidity through the dual listing 
in Johannesburg as well as it now being 
one of the largest companies on AIM.
During the twelve months, Sirius has 
increased the portfolio from 30 business 
parks to 33 (29 of which are deemed to 
be core assets). The four acquisitions in 
the period have all been earnings enhancing 
and the intensive capex investment 
programme, aimed at transforming 
previously unlettable or under-rented space, 
is showing a positive return. The Sirius 
business model remains very much focused 
on organic growth and we will continue 
to leverage our operating platform and the 
experience of our management team as we 
scale up our portfolio. Ultimately, by having 
a relatively fixed overhead cost base spread 
over a larger estate, we are well positioned 
to harvest the economic benefits that a 
larger scale brings to the business.
Whilst we have increased our flexible products 
such as SmartSpace (Office, Storage and 
Workbox) and Flexilager, which offer higher 
yields than conventional lets, our core anchor 
tenant base remains strong, with our top 
50 tenants generating 54% of the rent roll. 
Operations
Strong market conditions mean that 
demand for our flexible and conventional 
workspace from the German SME market 
continues to be high. In particular, 
SmartSpace is progressing well with high 
demand for our SmartSpace Office and 
SmartSpace Storage products in our core 
locations. Whilst the returns from offering 
flexibility in the SmartSpace product range 
are particularly good at the moment, the 
Group continues to recognise the benefit 
of having a stable base with strong covenanted 
blue-chip anchor tenants, as well as mid-term 
conventional SME tenants. This asset 
management focus is as much directed 
towards strengthening the quality and 
security of this core income stream as it is 
on the higher yielding flexible income stream.
The diversity of our tenant base ensures that 
we can maximise the yield whilst preserving 
the covenant quality within each park, so 
that our assets will always remain attractive 
from both an investment and a financing 
perspective. The table below illustrates 
the current tenant mix across the entire 
portfolio including the new acquisitions:
In summary:
 » The Sirius business model remains very much focused on organic growth 
and we will continue to leverage our operating platform and the experience 
of our management team as we scale up our portfolio.
 » Strong market conditions mean that demand for our flexible and 
conventional workspace from the German SME market continues to be high.
 » The capex investment programme continues to be a strong driver of rental 
income growth.

Operations continued
Our SmartSpace product range across the entire portfolio currently represents 75,663 sqm or 6.8% of the total lettable space of the portfolio 
and we would expect our capex investment programme to increase that to around 8% or more in the next twelve months. With rental rates 
of more than €10 per sqm being achieved on the latest SmartSpace office and storage products in our key locations, we are encouraged 
that this product range will continue to grow, especially given the locations of our recent acquisitions. The capex investment programme 
is also directed at converting our cheaper, lower-quality Flexilager product into both the higher-quality SmartSpace storage product or, 
in some instances, back to higher-quality conventional space. The demand and level of rental rates being achieved on these products 
continues to improve and the price point that we are achieving for newly created SmartSpace is now up to three times that achieved 
by the pre-conversion usage. This is being achieved despite our products often being priced at half that of our main competitors.

Capex investment programme
The capex investment programme continues to be a strong driver of rental income growth, aimed at transforming approximately 100,000 sqm 
of previously unlettable or under-rented space over a three year period through both a major projects and a light investment programme. 
As of 31 March 2015, 15 months after the commencement of the initiative, €3.1 million of the total €8.9 million budget has been invested, 
transforming 37,860 sqm of space, which is already generating €1.96 million of rental income on an occupancy of 74%. Sirius has also 
successfully transformed this space under budget with the investment on this space coming in lower than expected. The progress of the 
major projects element of this initiative can be seen in the table below:

Once the full capex investment programme is completed, the Group expects that space with an estimated rental value of €5.5 million 
will have been created and, with an occupancy rate of 80%, should contribute close to €4.0 million towards the Group’s total rental income. 
Considering the recurring profit level of the Group at the time this commenced, this initiative represents a material improvement in the 
Group’s profitability over the programme’s life. As the programme is focused on converting previously unusable or under-rented space, 
which has limited value attributed to it in the property valuations, this investment is also expected to have a positive impact on the value 
of the portfolio.
Disposals
Our objective is to fund our capex investment programme, as far as possible, with the disposal of non-income producing land as well 
as cash flow from operations. In the twelve month period, the Group disposed of 34,800 sqm of non-income producing land across sites 
in Bremen, Bonn and Berlin, generating proceeds of €4.55 million. Going forward we have identified four non-core (two of which are 
unencumbered) low-income producing business parks and a further 105,000 sqm of surplus land as potentially available for disposal. 
As these assets generate little profit, have low or no occupancy, and are conservatively valued on our balance sheet, recycling the capital 
from these disposals would both streamline the portfolio whilst providing funds that can be invested with much higher rates of return.

 We believe that as asset managers of multi-tenant, mixed-use 
workspace across Germany we have created a substantial 
operating platform that has enabled us to increase profitability 
and open up the debt markets. Sirius Real Estate Limited

Acquisitions
During the period, Sirius completed the 
acquisition of four multi-let business parks 
for a total consideration of €70.9 million. 
Located in and around Berlin, our Mahlsdorf 
and Potsdam assets, with a total lettable 
area of 65,444 sqm, were the first two sites 
acquired in December 2014, adding further 
presence in a core market for Sirius where 
demand for both conventional and flexible 
workspace solutions is high. Acquired for 
a total consideration of €49.1 million, these 
sites will initially contribute €4.1 million 
to the business in annualised rental income 
on an occupancy of 85% and €3.8 million 
in net operating income.
In February 2015, the Group acquired two 
further sites in Aachen and Bonn with a 
total lettable area of 35,153 sqm for a total 
consideration of €21.8 million. These sites 
provide an initial annualised rental income 
of €2.3 million on an occupancy of 76% 
and €2.0 million of net operating income.
The four acquisitions were funded by 
the net proceeds from the Company’s 
€40 million private placement in December 
along with a drawdown from the new 
€36 million five year debt facility with 
BerlinHyp. This facility is secured over three 
of the four assets and bears interest at 
a fixed rate of 2.85% per annum. These 
assets were acquired on an EPRA net initial 
yield of 8.1%, with opportunities to drive 
further returns from the vacant space. 
With demand for available space seen so 
far being encouraging, these acquisitions 
provided immediate improvement in 
profitability, a sustainable and growing 
income stream and ample opportunity 
to generate high long-term total returns.
New lettings and move-outs
In the twelve month period, there were new 
lettings of 119,992 sqm at an average rate of 
€5.02 per sqm and move-outs of 93,087 sqm 
at an average rate of €4.18 per sqm. For the 
year ended 31 March 2014 we reported 
new lettings of 113,784 sqm at an average 
rate of €5.16 per sqm and move-outs of 
112,956 sqm at an average rate of 
€4.42 per sqm. This further occupational 
improvement has contributed to the 
pre-acquisitions portfolio occupancy 
increasing to 78% (2014: 76%) and rate 
per sqm increasing to €4.58 (2014: €4.46). 
We are continuing to see new lettings at 
a higher rate per sqm than the portfolio 
average and the rate of existing tenants. 
This can be partly attributed to having more 
SmartSpace available through the capex 
investment programme but it is also indicative 
of the strength of the market we operate 
in. Given the breadth of our tenant base we 
will always have move-outs in the portfolio 
but we are confident that the strength of 
our sales and marketing platform will once 
again result in move-ins exceeding move-outs 
in the next financial year.
Operational efficiencies
Our level of service charge recovery 
continues to be above industry standards 
and we have made further progress this 
financial year. Most aspects of the service 
charge recovery area are controlled by our 
employees and the systems that we have 
developed, which is why we are able to 
contract and allocate service charge costs in 
a more detailed and sophisticated way than 
our competitors. This, combined with using 
our consolidated purchasing power, means 
we are able to provide a cost efficient and 
transparent service to our tenants which 
they are beginning to really appreciate. 
What this has meant to Sirius is an 
unprecedented level of cost recovery, which 
has been one of the main profit drivers 
for the Group over the last few years.
Portfolio analysis
The table below shows the key details of 
the core portfolio of 29 assets and the four 
assets that are for sale. The core portfolio 
is currently valued on a gross yield of 8.9% 
and a capital value of €547.1 per sqm.
Outlook and the years ahead
We would like to thank the management 
team and all the staff for their tremendous 
work this year. We have secured four 
excellent new sites to add to our portfolio 
and we are confident that the management 
team has the experience to fully capitalise 
on the opportunities available. We will 
continue to explore further opportunities 
to increase the value of the existing estate, 
recycle non-core and mature assets and 
improve the Group’s financing terms and 
expand our sources of lending. The capex 
investment programme continues to generate 
strong returns on investment, largely due 
to the effectiveness of our asset management 
activities, and we are hopeful to see further 
increases in our rent roll, occupancy and 
capital value of the portfolio over the years 
to come.

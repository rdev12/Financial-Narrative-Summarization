Markets
halfords has a unique role to 
play for uK and irish consumers. 
t hrough its Retail and autocentres 
businesses the Group can exploit 
a number of diverse growth 
opportunities. with a special place 
in the heart of consumers, halfords 
is a powerful brand with a great 
heritage and strong brand equity.
Halfords Retail differentiates itself in the markets of 
automotive, cycling and outdoor leisure across its 
three strategic pillars of Supporting Drivers of Every 
Car, Inspiring Cyclists of Every Age and Equipping 
Families for their Leisure Time.
With 465 locations, Halfords Retail has a significantly 
favourable market position with stores being located 
less than 20 minutes driving distance away from 90% 
of the UK population. Unique offers such as wefit 
create convenient local solutions. Halfords.com, in 
combination with the stores, their expert colleagues 
and specialist product ranges, creates a true 
omnichannel advantage for the business. 
Over the past year Halfords’ markets have been 
either relatively flat or, in categories such as cycling, 
in strong growth. It’s difficult to segregate how much 
of the market performance was down to changing 
consumer behaviour, an improving economy or even 
the weather; however, the sustained growth in the 
popularity of cycling and advantageous technological 
changes in the Auto Aftercare category have and will 
benefit Halfords in the future.
supportin G dri Ver s of eVer y Car
After a number of years of decline, UK car mileage 
rose in 2013, coinciding with the highest number 
of new-car registrations for five years. According to 
the SMMT, 2,264,737 cars were registered in 2013, 
up 10.8% on 2012. The UK is consistently Europe’s 
second-largest car market and was the only one to 
grow continually throughout 2013.
The number of cars on Britain’s roads also continued 
to grow whilst the average age of a UK car increases 
each year. Technology changes progressed with 
around 50% of new cars coming fitted with stop-
start batteries. Although the Sat Nav market remains 
in structural decline, technological and regulatory 
factors have favourably impacted the Auto Aftercare 
market. For instance, European Union directives 
regarding CO
2
 emissions and road safety mean that 
more and more cars will come fitted with daylight 
and automatic lights, along with flat wiper-blade 
functionality.
With bulbs, blades and batteries (“3Bs”) becoming 
increasingly complex to fit on new vehicles and the 
DIY approach to fixing cars shrinking with each 
generation of new drivers, the 3Bs fitting market 
presents Halfords with a unique opportunity to grow 
its current low market share. Fitting services were in 
significant demand throughout FY14, augmented by 
an enhanced marketing approach and expert service 
with Halfords uniquely placed to provide a value and 
hassle-free Do It For Me (“DIFM”) level of service that 
more and more drivers are set to need.
Since the acquisition of Autocentres, Halfords has 
also consolidated and strengthened its position in 
the c.£9bn servicing market. That market was made 
up of nearly 40,000 outlets in 2008, dropping to 
less than 37,000 in 2013 as the market continues 
to consolidate. Halfords can and does exploit this

opportunity using its scale-based business model, 
expanding its number of Autocentres each year.
In the Car Enhancement category the Sat Nav 
market shows no signs of slowing its sharp decline. 
However the Government remains committed to a 
digital future for radio with a potential switchover in 
the medium term. With Halfords occupying most 
of the in-car digital-radio market in 2013, this could 
have a material impact on the category for the 
business, though not in the short term. Halfords also 
made gains in audio equipment thanks to reduced 
competition on the high street and with the digital 
switchover on the horizon, this looks set to continue. 
In fact no other UK-wide business can match 
Halfords’ skillset and price on either Audio fitting or 
Sat Nav set-up and demonstration.

Halfords is the largest player in the UK cycling 
market, reflecting its scale positioning and also the 
successful extension of its ranges into the premium 
segment of the cycle market in recent years. This 
included the introduction of the Pinarello brand to 
the range alongside a successful complete refresh 
of the Boardman series. The business also materially 
expanded its offer in the fast-growing Cycling Parts, 
Accessories and Clothing (“PACs”) market during 
the year.
The summer of 2013 saw better weather conditions 
year on year, despite the fact that the October 2013 
to February 2014 period was one of the wettest 
on record. According to Mintel, road bikes saw the 
strongest growth in the past year, reflecting the 
success of British riders in the Tour de France and 
the growth of UK road-riding events, known as 
sportives. Before Sir Bradley Wiggins’ famous win 
in Paris in 2012, the British Cycling Association had 
around 42,500 members; by November 2013, it had 
grown to 84,250. 
The number of people cycling keeps growing against 
a continuing trend of declining participation for other 
major sports. As a result, Mintel expects up to 46% 
growth in the value of the Cycle market between 
2013 and 2018 (as a best-case scenario).
In 2013, a record number of certificates were issued 
by the Cycle To Work Alliance, a group of leading 
providers of the scheme, including Halfords. Around 
100,000 new users were recruited to the scheme  
in 2013.
Road safety remains the greatest concern for 
potential UK cyclists. However, public bodies are 
increasingly looking to invest in Cycling infrastructure, 
particularly given the benefits greater participation 
can bring in terms of not only public health but also 
reduced congestion and pollution.
It is clear that smartphones and wearable technology 
play an increasingly important role for cyclists; 
this trend will only accelerate. In the year Halfords 
introduced a compelling range of wearable-fitness 
products from brands such as Jawbone and Garmin. 
A new Halfords Bikes Miles app allows cyclists to 
earn points for offers online and in-store, join teams, 
log rides and reach milestones.
Within a rapidly growing cycle market Halfords has 
strengthened its core position whilst penetrating 
key opportunities across premium, PACs, female, 
junior and a host of others. With a strong brand, 
increasingly-skilled expert colleagues, a growing 
range of products and brands, an extensive national 
network of stores being refreshed and a true 
omnichannel offer, Halfords’ credibility as a place for 
Inspiring Cyclists of Every Age is beyond doubt.

This third category pillar occupies the smallest 
element of Halfords Retail sales. It is spread across 
several fragmented markets, which can be grouped 
under the umbrella of camping and outdoor 
leisure, while also encompassing a wide variety of 
strategically chosen impulse products. The range 
changes throughout the year build in a vital element 
of seasonality.

 4 Charteris Annual Report 2005
Chairman’s statement
The rapid progress – in market conditions that
generally remained challenging – required
additional investment in business and
organisational development, but the company
simultaneously achieved a substantial increase
in profit with good operational cash flow.
I congratulate the whole team on this impressive,
all-round performance.
Results
T urnover in the year ended 31 July 2005 was
£19.3m (2003/04: £13.8m) – an increase of
40%. Cedalion was acquired on 29 October 2004
and contributed £1.8m to turnover in three
quarters of the year. T urnover from the
continuing business was £17.5m. The organic
growth of 27% was an excellent achievement in
the current market.
Profit before tax was £891k (2003/04: £541k) –
an increase of 65%. Profit before tax and the
amortisation of goodwill was £1.17m (2003/04:
£717k). On the latter basis operating profit
margin was 6.1% (compared to 5.2%); the
operating profit margin of the continuing
business was 6.4%.
There was strong cash generation of £1.4m from
operating activities. £2.7m of cash was used for
the acquisition of Cedalion. The cash balance at
31 July 2005 was £2.1m (31 July 2004: £4.2m).
Cedalion
The integration of Cedalion has gone very well
and I am delighted to report that the practice is
now performing strongly. In the first three
months after acquisition the business made a
small loss of £16k; in H2, despite some slippage
on key sales prospects, the practice made an
operating profit of £48k. Good orders were
achieved towards the end of the year. The costs
of integration were £132k. 
Dividend
Three years ago the board agreed that it was a
financial goal for Charteris to pay a dividend and
sustain a progressive dividend policy. A dividend
of 0.4p per share was paid in respect of the
financial year ended 31 July 2002 and the
dividend was maintained at that level for the
subsequent two years. The Directors are
recommending the payment of an increased
dividend of 0.5p for the year ended 31 July 2005,
which is covered 3.9 times by earnings. If
approved, the dividend will be paid on 29
November 2005 to eligible shareholders on the
register on 4 November 2005.
Strategy
The central theme of Charteris’ three-year
strategic plan (developed in 2003 for the financial
years 2003/06) was a return to strong growth but
on a broader business base. At the end of the
second year of the plan, the results of the
successful implementation of this strategy can be
seen clearly. There is a good spread of business
It is a great pleasure to report excellent results for
Charteris in the year ended 31 July 2005. Strong
organic growth was achieved in parallel with the
acquisition and integration of Cedalion, which now
forms a fourth practice within the business.  Charteris Annual Report 2005 5
across the sectors represented by the three
Southern practices. The Northern practice (from
Cedalion) has been introduced to complement
these and broaden the base further. Within each
sector we are proactive in developing propositions
that can be brought to both existing clients and a
wider market.
The practices are focused on segments of the
market that show good growth potential, but we
do not expect them to grow uniformly. In the last
year the strongest growth has been in Government
and in Financial Services and Media, whereas in
the previous year it was in Retail, Manufacturing
and Services. We deploy our professional resources
across all sectors and the increased breadth gives
the company greater flexibility in adjusting to
market conditions. 
In the third year of the plan our strategy is to
continue growing the business ambitiously, but
with more emphasis on improving operating
margin. Although we shall continue to make
investments in business and organisational
development, we believe that the current structure
can largely support the next stage of growth. 
Prospects 
The directors believe that Charteris is well
positioned for its tenth year of trading. It has
established an outstanding reputation for
transforming businesses through the strategic
application of technology. Our advice and
solutions are informed by practical hands-on
experience; we have currency of knowledge from
using the latest proven techniques, yet our team
represents one of the most experienced in the
industry. We find that the importance and value
of such key services are increasingly being
recognised in the market, where organisations
are tending to be ever more discriminating in
seeking suppliers for their IT-related
programmes.
We see good prospects for further growth in
earnings through a combination of growth in
turnover and gradual improvement of operating
margin.

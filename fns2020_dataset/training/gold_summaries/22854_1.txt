Significant growth
We are pleased to report excellent 
results following a year of 
considerable activity leading 
up to and following our recent 
admission to AIM.  
We continue to deliver on all our 
key performance indicators and 
not just in relation to turnover 
growth and profitability which 
have grown by 79.3% and 61.9% 
respectively over the 12 months 
to 31 July 2006. Indeed our 
profitability for the current year 
exceeded our expectations at  
the time of the flotation by  
nearly 25%. 
We commenced our new 
advertising and marketing 
campaign on 16 October 2006 
following which we expect 
these already buoyant trading 
levels to continue to accelerate. 
Our initial assessment of the 
effectiveness of this campaign is 
extremely positive and we would 
expect this to increase over 
time as the campaign gathers 
momentum. The quality of leads 
being generated is expected 
to result in higher conversion 
rates than those previously 
experienced.
Additionally, with the total 
number of IVAs expected to 
exceed 40,000 in 2006 and with 
some reports suggesting that 
the total number of IVAs will 
continue to grow to over 100,000 
by 2010, the signs remain that the 
significant demand for the Group’s 
range of services will continue in 
the future.
Welcome regulatory change 
and best advice
The Board welcome the recent 
calls to increase the current levels 
of regulation in the IVA market 
and will ensure that best practice 
advice continues to be offered 
to our customers through our 
experienced debt counsellors 
at our Borehamwood offices, 
giving the Group the ability to 
continue to expand its business, 
with the benefit of the substantial 
increase in the Group’s marketing 
spend. Initial enquiries already 
indicate increased levels of 
trading. Additionally, through 
our experienced team of 
insolvency practitioners, who 
are themselves subject to tight 
regulation by various regulatory 
bodies including the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of 
England and Wales (‘ICAEW’) 
and the Association of Chartered 
Our initial assessment 
of the effectiveness of 
our new marketing 
campaign is extremely 
positive
The Board welcome

I am pleased to 
welcome Bernard Asher 
to the board as our non-
executive Chairman 
who brings with him 
a wealth of experience 
of the consumer 
orientated financial 
services industry
It is through the broad base 
of our service offering to the 
customer that we are able to 
provide impartial advice
Chief Executive’s Statement continued
Certified Accountants (‘ACCA’) we 
are already the subject of external 
scrutiny and examination.  
At the time of our AIM 
admission we highlighted that 
we offer a full range of services, 
including debt management, 
IVAs, and secured loans to our 
customers.  We are pleased to 
announce that these services 
have been complemented 
through the acquisition of 
Neville Eckley & Co which will 
enable us to offer a bankruptcy 
option for the first time as well 
as allowing us to enter the 
corporate market with company 
voluntary arrangements and 
corporate insolvencies. It is 
through the broad base of our 
service offering to the customer 
that we are able to provide 
impartial advice. 
An important measure of 
performance is the current 
average level of dividend we 
deliver on IVAs to the creditor 
which stands at approximately 
42p in the pound.  We would 
expect to maintain this level 
of dividend by leveraging our 
administration costs and through 
our cost effective marketing 
strategies developed over the last 
nine years.
Growth in resources
In the short time since coming 
to the market, we have further 
strengthened the board and 
senior management team. 
I am pleased to welcome 
Bernard Asher to the board as 
our non-executive Chairman 
who brings with him a wealth 
of experience of the consumer 
orientated financial services 
industry which will prove to be 
invaluable to us as we develop 
the business further. Bernard was 
an executive director of HSBC 
Holdings from 1986 to 1998 and 
chairman of HSBC Investment 
Bank. In 1998 Bernard became 
non-executive vice chairman 
of Legal & General Group plc, 
chairman of Lonrho Africa plc 
and is currently a non-executive 
director of Morgan Sindall plc, 
China Shoto plc and Investment 
Management Holdings plc 
(formerly Seymour Pierce Group 
plc). Bernard is also the chairman 
of Liontrust Asset Management 
Holdings plc, a UK based equity 
investment fund.
Additionally, I am delighted to 
welcome Neville Eckley and his 
team following the acquisition of 
his business earlier this month. 
The acquisition of 
Neville Eckley & Co, 
will enable us to offer 
a bankruptcy option 
for the first time

Neville, who joins our Insolvency 
Management Committee, is a 
highly respected insolvency 
practitioner who brings with 
him over 30 years of experience 
of the insolvency industry. His 
input into the ongoing regulatory 
environment and best practices 
and procedures of the Group in 
the future will be a valued asset 
to the Group.  The acquisition of 
Neville Eckley & Co brings with 
it a staff of 18 highly experienced 
administrators and a client base 
of over 300 IVAs currently under 
supervision. With limited further 
recruitment we anticipate that 
Neville Eckley & Co will be able 
to process approximately 50, 
rising to 100 new IVAs a month 
by early 2007. 
The Board has also invested 
heavily in improving the 
overall infrastructure of the 
business, the first stage of 
which was completed earlier 
this month following the 
move into new purpose built 
offices in Borehamwood. 
the Group has also recently 
relocated its Chesterfield 
operations into a 30,000 sq 
ft purpose built office. This 
gives us the ability to continue 
to expand the businesses 
following the increase in the 
Group’s marketing spend 
which commenced with the 
new advertising campaign in 
October 2006. The new premises 
will give the Group capacity 
to employ up to 400 people 
who would enable the Group 
to process in excess of 500 
IVAs a month, together with 
substantially increasing its debt 
management, bankruptcy and 
secured loan businesses and 
provide capacity to enter into 
the mortgage market in 2007.
Acquisition of  
Neville Eckley & Co.
On 12 October 2006, we 
announced the acquisition of 
Neville Eckley & Co, chartered 
accountants and licensed 
insolvency practitioners. The 
business operates out of four 
offices in the South East with 
some 18 employees, including 
one Insolvency Practitioner, 
and offers a range of services 
to both individual and 
corporate clients including 
IVAs and Company Voluntary 
Arrangements.  In the year to  
31 December 2005, Neville 
Eckley & Co had sales of 
£769,000 and EBITDA of

£122,000.  Based on the balance 
sheet as at 31 December 2005, 
the net assets acquired as 
part of the acquisition were 
£100,000.
We are delighted that Neville 
Eckley and his team have joined 
Debts.co.uk plc and in the short 
time they have been part of the 
Group the level of synergies and 
ability to leverage the resources 
of the combined Group have 
proved to be significant.
We firmly believe that selective 
acquisitions form an important 
part of the overall development 
of the Group and have identified 
a number of suitable candidates 
which we hope will become part 
of the Group.
Marketing strategies 
Historically, the initial approach 
from a prospective customer 
was normally through one of 
the Group’s websites or by 
telephone to our Borehamwood 
initial contact centre. A 
material part of the strategy 
for raising additional capital 
was to create awareness of 
the Group’s services and to 
generate potential customer 
leads through the investment in 
marketing on a broad range of 
media including TV advertising, 
radio, national and local press 
as well as online marketing 
strategies.
We have maintained our previous 
online advertising expenditure 
whilst we developed other 
advertising strategies, including 
a new TV advertising campaign 
which has been run in parallel 
with an extensive national press 
campaign. As I mentioned earlier, 
the response rates have been 
extremely encouraging in both 
the level and the quality of the 
leads generated.
In addition, we have invested 
in new phone systems and 
software to provide a more 
detailed and accurate analysis 
of responses to our advertising 
which will enable us to 
maximise the return on our 
investment in marketing over 
the coming weeks and months.
Other marketing strategies 
include the development of 
affiliation links with a select 
number of preferred partners. 
The Board believes this strategy 
will be extremely complementary 
to our off- and online advertising 
strategies.

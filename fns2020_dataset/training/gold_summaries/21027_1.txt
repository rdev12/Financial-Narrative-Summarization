Whilst all investment themes have seen 
net redemptions across the year, these 
slowed significantly in the second half, 
which also saw a turnaround in markets  
and investment performance. The pace 
of recovery varied by theme, with 
external debt recovering fastest to 
record a 9 per cent increase in AuM  
in H2, while local currency still had  
net redemptions that outweighed its 
positive performance during that period. 
Special situations lagged the listed 
equity markets, as is usual emerging 
from stress events, and as we waited  
for corporate and capital market activity 
– the principal driver of revaluations –  
to pick up. AuM in the theme remained 
broadly flat in the second half of the year.  
Lately there have been some positive 
signs pointing to the re-establishment  
of the global IPO market after an almost 
complete absence of such activity in  
the last year.

The Group achieved net revenue  
for the year of £203.5 million (2008:  
£240.0 million) a reduction of 15 per cent. 
Management fees (net of distribution 
costs) in Sterling terms rose marginally 
to £183.2 million (2008: £182.0 million), 
reflecting the fact that the reduction in 
average levels of AuM was offset by  
the strengthening of the US Dollar and 
the increase in management fee margin. 
Total performance fees for the year were 
£52.5 million (2008: £44.7 million), an 
increase of 17 per cent, including the 
maturity of the first Global Special 
Situations Fund in July 2008, and the 
August 2008 annual performance fees. 
Other income was £6.4 million (2008: 
£10. 1 million), the reduction occurring  
as a result of reduced transaction  
The Group’s overall financial 
performance achieved in the year 
ended 30 June 2009 was broadly 
satisfactory within the context  
of the extraordinary global market 
conditions. In the first half, as a result 
of significant reductions in asset 
valuations and sharply increased 
outflows, assets under management 
(AuM) were reduced by a third and 
after a further small fall in the third 
quarter the final quarter saw an 
increase to close at a level of  
US$24.9 billion. 
The opportunity presented now for 
Ashmore is greater than ever as world 
events over the last year have both 
emphasised and accelerated the 
increase in the significance of the 
emerging markets within the global 
economy. We continue to see 
opportunities going forward across  
the asset classes we operate in, and 
during the last year have further improved 
our operating platform to enable us to 
take full advantage of these opportunities.
assets under management and financial 
performance
The opening AuM at 30 June 2008 stood 
at US$37 .5 billion. Overall during the 
year, net redemptions of US$7 .5 billion 
(H1 US$5.8 billion, H2 US$1.7 billion) 
and negative investment performance  
of US$5. 1 billion (H1 negative US$7 . 1 
billion, H2 positive US$2.0 billion) have 
resulted in final AuM of US$24.9 billion.
activity levels. Foreign exchange  
losses for the full year were £38.6 million, 
comprising £38.3 million realised hedging 
costs related to hedging the US$-
denominated management fee income 
for the period, £4. 1 million unrealised 
hedging loss related to the hedging  
of management fees for future periods, 
and a £3.8 million gain from foreign 
exchange movements on the Group’s 
non-Sterling-denominated net assets. 
After costs of £52.9 million (2008: £58.8 
million) and interest income of £9.2 million 
(2008: £15.0 million) profit before tax was 
£159.8 million, a decrease of 19 per cent 
from the previous year. Basic earnings 
per share for the year were 17 .1 pence 
(2008: 21.0 pence). 
The impact of the credit crisis
The events of the global credit crisis 
have been extensively documented  
over the last year. There is little merit in 
recounting them again, rather in looking 
instead at the impact felt in the emerging 
markets and at our resultant opportunity 
set. It is clear that the crisis did not 
originate in the emerging markets but,  
in a global crisis as severe as that 
experienced over the last year, no 
market or sector could be immune  
from impact.
Chief executive officer’s statement
w orld events over the last year have both 
emphasised and accelerated the increase  
in the significance of the emerging markets.

Secondly, based upon Ashmore’s 
experience in managing across cycles 
through a number of past crises we 
believe we are well positioned for strong 
investment returns in the future. The 
investment process employed managing 
a portfolio during periods of market 
stress is one where the liquidity of  
a portfolio is retained through the 
purchase of highly liquid instruments, 
whilst adding lower liquidity instruments 
with high embedded value such as 
special situations and corporate high 
yield to provide significant alpha over  
the cycle. This active management 
approach is not based on market 
indices and accepts short-term mark- 
to-market declines, often arising simply 
as a result of wider bid-offer spreads  
in distressed markets, to secure 
long-term gains through the acquisition 
of attractive assets which will appreciate 
over the medium to long term. We have, 
as expected, begun to see the start  
of such outperformance, and look  
to realise further upside.
Thirdly, we are confident Ashmore 
remains well positioned to raise more 
AuM in the future through the second 
and third phases of the Group’s strategic 
development – the further diversification 
of developed world capital sources  
and themes and the mobilisation of 
growing emerging market capital pools. 
Developed world capital sources have 
undoubtedly been the most affected by 
the events of the last 18 months with an 
extreme reduction in leverage available 
resulting in an overriding reduction in the 
scale of funds deployed. However, we 
are beginning to receive subscriptions 
from these pools again, as investors 
work out where their capital should best 
Ashmore’s experienced fund 
management team have managed 
funds through significant crises before, 
perhaps most notably in 1994 and 1998. 
On this occasion the global scale of the 
crisis was greater but the emerging 
market impacts have been very different. 
Unlike in the earlier crises the emerging 
markets are now net creditors in global 
terms and as a result there has been  
relatively little increase in the default risk 
in Latin America and Asia and lower 
levels of contagion. The impact in those 
regions has principally been one of 
collateral damage from either reducing 
cross-border flows or a reduction in 
export levels. In Eastern Europe there 
has been a more direct impact, in part 
due to the greater direct investment  
from a concentration of EU countries 
and institutions and also to the greater 
extent to which leverage had been 
employed compared to other emerging 
market regions. 
Following these events the resultant 
position is an opportunity in three ways. 
Firstly, in a macro sense we believe that  
it has accelerated the shift of economic 
weight to, and the bargaining positions 
of, the emerging markets. The G20 
London summit saw emerging markets 
deliverables dominating and indicates 
that the international community 
recognises that emerging markets will  
define globalisation in the future. 
be allocated. At the same time, levels of 
redemptions, which were predominantly 
liquidity-driven rather than asset- 
allocation-based, have reduced 
dramatically from the levels we received 
during the middle of the year ended  
30 June 2009. Capital allocators within 
those largest emerging world sources of 
capital – central banks, governments/
reserve managers and sovereign wealth 
funds – are also seriously assessing 
greater reserve allocations to the 
emerging markets and so diluting the 
historic dominance of the US Dollar in 
this role. Therefore, looking forward, the 
opportunity for greater emerging market 
significance, strong investment returns 
and AuM growth sees Ashmore very 
well positioned.

Operational delivery
At the core of Ashmore lies our central 
investment committee whose 
established investment processes  
focus on the maintenance of long-term 
outperformance. Periods of high market 
stress drive increased volumes of  
inputs to those processes, including 
correspondingly greater analysis to 
enable the best investment decisions  
to be implemented. The investment 
professionals in all themes have been 
tested extensively this year in 
successfully implementing active 
investment management decisions. 
Some of the public funds with broad 
mandates not tied to benchmarks saw 
short-term underperformance for part 
of the year as we added illiquid assets 
and subsequently as the special 
situations valuations lagged more liquid 
investments in the recovery phase.  
Ashmore’s experienced fund management team  
have managed funds through crises before.

The Group’s local asset management 
subsidiaries now operate in Brazil, 
Turkey and India. At the beginning  
of January we launched equity funds 
managed in our Sao Paulo office 
mirroring the onshore and offshore  
fund structures established there last 
year with the local currency funds.  
All these funds have begun to see  
some subscriptions following the 
establishment of good opening track 
records. In Turkey, having established 
the local asset management business  
in Istanbul following regulatory approval 
in August last year, we launched three 
Ashmore mutual funds in May this year. 
In India the period has been a busy  
one for both the locally based special 
situations team and our mid-market 
private equity venture. 
Following the acquisition of a majority 
interest in Dolomite Capital, a New 
York-based emerging market fund  
of third-party funds manager and 
independent advisor, in November we 
completed the acquisition of the balance 
before the year ended to enable us  
to consolidate the team with our existing 
staff and grow our overall Ashmore 
marketing and distribution presence  
in the United States.
People and culture 
Ashmore has been successful over  
the long term because we have 
combined a successful operating model 
with good people and a robust culture. 
At the heart of the culture we believe are 
two overriding principles – alignment with 
our clients and alignment with our 
shareholders. The performance of the 
team at Ashmore over the year to  
30 June 2009 has been one of immense 
effort and significant achievement in 
many areas. Nonetheless, as in past 
years, the financial rewards for the  
team have been reduced, mirroring the 
negative absolute returns delivered by  
Our long-term institutional investor  
base has a good understanding of our 
approach but nevertheless a feature  
of last year was a significant increase  
in the time spent by our marketing and 
client relationship teams in reinforcing  
and enhancing this understanding. 
In the area of new product launches,  
the period has naturally seen somewhat 
reduced levels achieved compared  
with recent periods. The second half 
saw the fifth global special situations 
fund launched with AuM of US$0. 1 billion 
and in May we launched the Global 
Consolidation & Recovery Fund giving 
financial institutions a way of addressing 
some or all of their distressed or other 
emerging market balance sheet 
exposures. In addition to these public 
fund launches, the period saw two new 
segregated mandates funded in external 
debt and corporate high yield. At the 
same time we have been working hard 
on future initiatives to provide our clients 
with further diversification into those 
asset classes where we see significant 
opportunity in the next one to three years. 
see page 14 for further details
 
It has been another very busy year in  
the area of infrastructure projects with  
the implementation of a new portfolio 
management system which, in 
conjunction with the fund accounting 
system implemented last year, provides 
the backbone upon which to execute 
our long-term fund management  
strategy. In addition we have deployed 
new core systems in the human 
resources and company secretarial 
areas and implemented a new general 
ledger system. In all cases these  
provide us with further robust scalable 
applications that can be used across  
the Group.

Ashmore’s shares. This demonstrates 
the long-term nature of our commitment 
to make returns for both our investors 
and our shareholders. Our culture 
doesn’t change.

The organisation has grown as we have 
recruited a significant number of people 
into the Ashmore team during the last 
two years. The experiences we have 
shared in the delivery of investment 
performance, client management, 
support and infrastructure development 
over the last year have been stretching, 
but nevertheless highly enjoyable and 
rewarding. I would like to thank everyone 
for the part they have played over  
the period in providing Ashmore with  
the platform to seize the significant 
opportunities going forward and I  
look forward to us all getting on and 
seizing them.

Outlook statement 
The outlook can be assessed from  
two standpoints, the internal perspective 
of the firm and the external perspective 
of the markets in which we operate. Our 
outlook based on the first of these is as 
positive as at any time I can remember 
as the number of new opportunities, 
projects and initiatives that are being 
worked upon across the firm is 
extensive. New funds, new themes, 
potential clients and strategic initiatives 
are underway which we hope will bring 
significant value over the coming years. 
July and August have seen net inflows 
and positive investment performance, 
AshMOr e gr OuP Pl C / Ar 0 9 / Per FOr MANCe r eview / C hieF eXeCutive OFFiCer ’s st At eMeNt 
following the trend established in  
May and June.
As far as the prospects for emerging 
market investment are concerned we 
believe the reshaping of the emerging 
markets’ role within the global order  
has received a significant boost in the 
last year. We are also optimistic that we  
are seeing investors begin to allocate 
capital again and our challenge remains, 
as always, to persuade them of the 
compelling investment opportunities 
presented in the emerging markets.  
The long-term trend of an increasing 
allocation from investors towards 
emerging markets as these markets 
make up an ever greater proportion  
of world markets, whether measured  
by market capitalisation in debt or  
equity or through alternatives like GDP 
or growth potential, continues to be very 
positive for Ashmore. The largest source 
of capital to manage over the long term 
remains the capital from within the 
emerging markets themselves, and we 
are increasingly focused on this, and  
on the resources required to access it.

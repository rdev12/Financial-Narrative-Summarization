Chairman’s statement
David Holland Chairman (Non-Executive) I am pleased to be reporting on another
successful year for Telford Homes. The
Company has achieved exceptional results
once again and we are continuing to
build a good reputation, particularly in
and around East London. 
We are making a significant contribution
to the regeneration of the area
surrounding Docklands and the City.
With average selling prices below
£250,000 and the increasing attraction
of living close to major employment
areas, demand for our product continues
to be strong.
Relationships with public sector housing
providers are crucial to our business and
we have continued to develop these during
the year. We firmly believe that these
relationships will prove very successful,
both for our partners and for Telford
Homes, in the future and we place great
value on them.  
At the end of the financial year our
business employed 48 people, more
than double the number at our previous
year end. This increase includes the
strengthening of our management
team, both at board level and senior
management, as well as the appointment
of staff throughout the business. I would
like to take this opportunity to thank
each and every one of our employees for
their contribution to the Company this
year. Our success is clear evidence of
their efforts.  
We have a number of exciting new
developments to build and sell in 2003
and 2004 which will contribute to another
year of growth for the Company.

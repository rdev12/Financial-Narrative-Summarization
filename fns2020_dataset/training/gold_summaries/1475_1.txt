review of tHe PerioD
The mining business continued to perform 
profitably for the period under review in the face 
of very challenging conditions. However, the Group 
reported a loss after tax of £1.8 million after 
allowing for a loss of £3.4 million on disposal of 
the Regeneration business. Cash generation was 
good with debt reduced by a further £4.9 million 
in the period. Proved Reserves at the end of the 
year were at a record level of 6.1 million tonnes, 
a 30% increase over the previous year.
oPerational review (continuing 
oPerations)
Revenue for the period was £78.3 million 
(2009: £77.5 million). This was in spite of sales 
of 1.79 million tonnes from 1.82 million tonnes 
the previous year. Average selling prices per tonne 
were up 2.8% at £43.70 per tonne (2009: £42.50). 
Operating profits of £7.0 million were £2.0 million 
(restated) lower than the previous year.
The year’s performance was affected by a number 
of factors which led to lower production levels and 
increased costs: in particular a very wet autumn 
followed by heavy winter snows in East Ayrshire 
and disruption caused by delays in obtaining 
the necessary permissions to divert a burn and 
electricity supply at Muir Dean in Fife. In addition, 
unexpected geological conditions at Glenmuckloch 
in Dumfries and Galloway, which is approaching 
the end of its productive life, resulted in a lowering 
of the estimate of remaining reserves by approximately 
50,000 tonnes and an accelerated write down 
of work in progress of £0.7 million.
The second half of the year was marked by the 
deployment of additional manpower and equipment 
necessary to recover production lost over the winter 
period. The resultant increase in cost enabled contract 
commitments to be met and the delivery of the year’s 
sales of 1.79 million tonnes, given the half year 
position, was a significant achievement. The Group’s 
workforce endured some very difficult and, at times, 
Proved Reserves at the end of 
the year were at a record level of 
6.1 million tonnes, a 30% increase 
over the previous year. 
cash generation was good 
with debt reduced by a further 
£4.9 million in the period. 
Earnings remain suppressed by 
the continuing impact of supplying 
in excess of 40% of total sales to 
the Electricity Supply Industry 
at contract prices significantly 
below those available in the 
current market.

unpleasant conditions but displayed high levels

challenges that arose during an exceptional year.
legacy contracts
The Group’s earnings remain suppressed by the 
continuing impact of supplying in excess of 40% 
of total sales to the Electricity Supply Industry at 
contract prices significantly below those available 
in the current market. The Group is working hard 
to complete these contracts as quickly as possible 
but the first of these legacy contracts will not be 
fulfilled until March 2012 with the second finishing 
around September of the same year. Supply to 
legacy contracts thereafter is anticipated to amount 
to no more than 15% of sales volumes in 2013.
However, the Group is in the process of finalising 
a new market price related contract with a major 
Generator that will be supplied alongside an 
existing fixed price contract. This will further 
increase the average sales price for the Group.
coal reserves anD mine DeveloPment
2010 proved to be a very successful year for the 
Group’s Development team marked by a significant 
increase in the Group’s Proved Reserves base. 
Planning consents at Netherton, a site adjacent to 
our existing Skares Road site and Duncanziemere, 
close to our previously mined site at Laigh Glenmuir, 
added a total of 3.1 million tonnes to Proved 
Reserves, taking the total to in excess of 6 million 
tonnes. Both of these sites are planned to be 
developed during the current financial year and 
will become the cornerstone of the Group’s 
production over the next four years. Investment 
in these two mines will be around £14 million 
with both sites commencing operations in 2011. 
This exceptional level of capital expenditure will 
not be repeated in 2012.
The mining business continued 
to perform profitably for the period 
under review in the face of very 
challenging conditions.

The table below, relating to exploration results, 
mineral resources or mineral reserves is based upon 
information compiled by Mr Peter Morgan, a full 
time employee of the Group, who is a Fellow of 
the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining. 
Mr Morgan has sufficient experience which is 
relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of 
deposit under consideration. He has reviewed and 
consents to the inclusion in this report of the 
matters based on his information in the form and 
context in which they appear. A Glossary of terms 
is available on our website – www.ath.co.uk.
coal Prices 
International coal prices rose steadily during the 
year and at the end of November 2010 stood 
at around $110 per tonne (£70 per tonne). The 
Group’s selling price in 2010 averaged £43.70 per 
tonne, largely reflecting the impact of the Group’s 
legacy contracts. Forward market price indices 
indicate pricing will continue to rise year on year.
DiscontinueD oPerations
ath rEgEnEration The Group disposed of the assets and business of 
ATH Regeneration on 29 July 2010 for £6.5 million 
plus the opportunity to receive further additional 
royalty payments until 2017. It also retained 
ownership of certain properties at Pinxton in 
Derbyshire which the Group will be able to sell in 
2014 for a value expected to be around £2.5 million. 
During the financial year the business had incurred 
losses of £1.6 million. The loss on sale of the business 
including a write down in the value of goodwill 
amounted to £3.4 million.

The Group has decided to exercise its right to 
receive £2 million in royalties in January 2011 in 
exchange for a reduction of £3 million in the total 
value of royalties it may have otherwise received 
over the next seven years.
HealtH anD safety
The Board understands the potentially hazardous 
nature of the work undertaken in the Group’s 
operations and takes very seriously its responsibilities 
for health and safety.
The Group has a dedicated Health and Safety 
Manager and all operational sites have a mine 
manager who has the necessary qualifications 
and competence to manage operations safely. 
Employees are regularly trained in the Group’s 
processes with 85% of our workforce attaining 
grade NVQ Level 2, delivered by our own accredited 
training centre. This commitment to competence 
throughout the Group was a key factor in gaining 
both a RoSPA Gold Award and OHSAS accreditation 
from BSI for health and safety standards in 2010 
– a truly excellent achievement.
staff The Group also recognises the critical importance 
of its employees in the continual growth and 
success of the business. The Group employs over 
330 skilled, innovative and highly motivated people 
and continuous development is delivered through 
structured and targeted training programmes.
The Board would like to join me in thanking our 
people for all of the efforts they have made during 
a very challenging year and for the commitment 
that they continue to demonstrate.
summary During a difficult year, the Group disposed of the 
Regeneration business, significantly reducing debt 
and enabling the management team to focus on its 
core activities. The Group also increased its proved 
reserve base by 30% to record levels. 2011 will 
see production commencing at two new mines at 
Netherton and Duncanziemere which will form the 
cornerstone of the Group’s production for the next 
few years. Debt is expected to continue to reduce 
and, over the medium to long term, reserves 
should increase further. 
The Group is well positioned to deliver increasing 
returns to shareholders as the impact of its legacy 
contracts reduces significantly during 2012.

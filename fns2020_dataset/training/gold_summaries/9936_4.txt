 Mears is... a leading provider 
of integrated social housing 
maintenance and domiciliary care
Mears’ success is built on strong, long term partnerships with 
Local Authorities and Housing Associations, as well as with community 
groups, supply chain partners, staff and investors. 
We believe the future requires new partnerships to be built, that link  
together housing, social care and the NHS. Partnerships that will provide 
integrated services which improve customer outcomes, as well as helping 
to meet the financial challenges that exist. Mears is uniquely placed to 
support this new integration and we welcome the opportunities that this 
will bring to the benefit of all our partners.

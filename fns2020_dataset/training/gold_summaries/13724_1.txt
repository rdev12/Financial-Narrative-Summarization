CEO’s strategic review  
and update
“ The immediate challenge was to increase 
the pace of development of the Company. The Ruspetro team made some 
signi cant accomplishments during 
2012. Unfortunately, we did not meet 
our principal objective which was to 
reach a 10,400 boepd production target. 
I am sincerely disappointed with that 
result. Nonetheless, we did achieve a 
great deal. We created a business that 
ef ciently develops, produces and sells 
hydrocarbons.
Following our Initial Public Offering 
(‘IPO’) on 19 January 2012 we needed 
to move quickly and accomplish six 
key objectives, which were to:
1) Build a team.
2)  Develop sales, treatment and access 
infrastructure urgently.
3) Grow production.
4)  Improve reserve quality by 
increasing the proved category (1P).
5)  Develop a strategy to develop and 
monetize our gas resources.
6)  Improve the Company’s nancial 
performance towards becoming cash 
 ow positive. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Ruspetro plc

Key partnerships
One of the main risks to our business 
is execution. Part of the challenge is 
to manage the contractors working 
with us to develop our eld and 
ensure they share our vision and 
values and respect how we operate. 
This vision includes timely and 
accurate execution of projects along 
with strict adherence to best practice 
HSE standards. Without contractors 
sharing our vision and working with 
us to maintain the highest standards, 
it is dif cult to maintain consistent 
best practice standards across 
the eld.
Our business relies on close 
cooperation with a number of 
contractors to whom we outsource 
many of our operational functions. 
During 2012, having been let down 
by two fracturing service providers, 
we built a strong relationship with 
Weatherford in the last quarter of 
the year. They were able to ful ll the 
well completion schedule that had 
fallen behind due to the lack of 
capacity of our previous fracturing 
service providers. Building this 
type of long-term, reliable, mutually 
bene cial relationship is key to 
the successful execution of our 
long-term objectives.
 nance, legal, human resources and 
HSE departments both in the head 
of ce in Moscow and in our UK plc 
of ce in London. 
This team executed our eld 
development program successfully 
by mobilizing four additional rigs in 
the eld over the course of the year 
and drilling 33 wells whilst improving 
the surface infrastructure to provide 
access, electricity and pipelines to 
all working pads. This also included 
building and commissioning the 27km 
sales pipeline ahead of schedule and 
signi cantly under budget. The 
Company now has 15,000 bopd of 
processing capacity for our crude oil 
production in our west eld area, and 
9,000 bopd of processing capacity for 
condensate and 3 million cubic meters 
of gas processing capacity per day in the 
north of the eld. The team continues to 
exceed the regional benchmarks in the 
construction of pipelines, power lines, 
roads and facilities.
While the Company made great strides 
in putting in signi cant infrastructure 
quickly and at a lower cost than budgeted, 
growing production at the tempo we had 
initially planned proved to be dif cult. 
Our plan at IPO was to continue 
development of the structural high in the 
west of the eld. Our mapping showed the 
geology progressing on-trend to the east 
and west from Pad 21. As we had some 
existing infrastructure to the east of Pad 
21 and knowledge of the formations from 
3D seismic, we directed our development 
efforts in this direction by building Pad 19, 
The immediate challenge was to 
increase the pace of development of 
the Company. To do this we needed to 
get more rigs into operation, start and 
complete on schedule the construction 
of a sales pipeline to link the Company’s 
processing facility with the Transneft 
pipeline network, build a pump station 
and increase oil treatment capacity. 
At the time of the IPO, we had only 
one rig in operation on Pad 21, with 
no more room for expansion to drill 
further wells. For other rigs to be 
activated, we needed to extend existing 
pads and build the roads, power lines 
and pipelines to connect them. Within 
days of the IPO, we began procurement 
of the pipe for the 27km sales pipeline 
and in parallel began trenching 
operations. Concurrently, we started 
extending Pad 21 in preparation for 
more drilling. This level of activity, 
while impressive, did require a more 
capable team to manage the multiple 
parallel processes for this pace of 
 eld development. 
During the year, we increased the 
size of our team considerably in order 
to be able to gain the expertise and 
management capability necessary to 
triple our drilling program, build-out 
the required infrastructure, increase 
our production and improve our 
understanding of the eld. The new 
team needed to be able to deliver on 
our fast paced rollout. We were able to 
bring key people into the Company with 
both international and local business 
backgrounds. They have roles and 
responsibilities throughout the 
business, in operations, in our 
subsurface department and in the

Staff
Since our IPO, we have considerably 
increased the size of our team in order 
to be able to gain the expertise and 
management capability necessary to 
increase our production and improve 
our understanding of the eld. Key 
new hires include Robert Stewart, who 
heads our production and operations 
and is based in the eld. Robert has 
28 years of industry experience 
with Conoco. Nick De’ Ath, formerly 
of TNK-BP with over 30 years 
of industry experience, heads our 
Subsurface Team. John Krupa has 
joined us from Exillon as Senior 
Geophysicist. He also has over 30 years 
of industry experience. We have also 
made senior appointments to head 
drilling, workovers and fracturing.
In addition to our operations and 
subsurface team, we have made key 
appointments in the nance, legal, 
human resources and 
HSE departments.
We are focused on promoting a 
performance based culture. To do 
this, we are developing an incentive 
program structured to deliver optimal 
performance from our team.

condensate production during the year, 
several upgrades to the production system 
were conducted including upgrading the 
in eld pipelines, separation, water 
disposal and testing equipment.
At the end of 2012, it was necessary to 
further upgrade the EPF to manage the 
large volumes of gas production and to 
dissipate the heat carried to the surface 
by the gas and condensate production. 
A heat exchange system, new separators 
and larger diameter ow lines were 
all added to the facility to bring the 
temperature and pressure of the 
well production to a point whereby the 
condensate could be stabilized. However, 
when the heat exchange system was 
commissioned reservoir pressure decline 
and the resultant drop in condensate 
yield meant that condensate production 
did not rise as initially expected.
The increased gas supply and reserves 
identi ed by the development work 
in the north of the eld has been 
instrumental in pushing forward 
our gas utilization and monetization 
strategy. This strategy is discussed 
in more detail on page 09.
From the Company’s inception it has 
been our stated aim to increase the 
quality of our reserves. 2012 saw a 35% 
increase in our proved reserves, which 
now stand at 234 mmboe. This is a 
61 mmboe increase of which 29 mmboe 
are the proved gas reserves added 
due to the development of the gas and 
condensate play in the north of the eld.
The respectable current gas production 
in the north of the eld associated with 
the condensate we are selling presents 
the potential for a signi cant gas 
business for Ruspetro that will enhance 
our pro tability when brought on-line. 
This was not something that we 
envisaged to be feasible a year ago. 
We are currently producing about 
1.6 million cubic meters per day 
(9,400 boepd).
We have been developing a gas 
monetization plan to allow us to sell 
our associated petroleum gas to several 
potential clients. The initial primary 
customer is a commercial electricity 
generating plant being constructed in 
the region. Other potential customers 
are available via the Gazprom pipeline 
network, which is beginning to open up 
in response to the Russian Government’s 
drive towards greater utilization of 
associated gas by oil producers.
The planning process for a gas processing 
plant and pipeline is under way and we 
intend to start building during the winter 
of 2013 with revenues from the project 
beginning to be realized in the second 
half of 2014. The gas business will have 
relatively low operating costs and thus 
will become another high margin 
revenue stream for Ruspetro.
erecting a rig and beginning to drill. After 
drilling several wells in different areas 
from Pad 19, we were met by consistently 
lower permeability than we had found 
previously. The reservoir rock had similar 
thickness and in some cases superior 
porosity to the reservoir accessible from 
Pad 21 but, due to the lower permeability, 
the wells were only yielding 
approximately 150 bopd of initial rate 
after fracture treatment. At the same time 
that we were experiencing poor reservoir 
quality from Pad 19, we were getting 
better results from the gas-condensate 
reservoir in the north of the eld. 
The gas-condensate eld provided 
two positives. Firstly, the well rates 
and reservoir quality, while variable, 
were on average better than our 
 ndings from Pad 19. Secondly, the 
Mineral Extraction Tax (‘MET’) for 
condensate is approximately US$20 less 
per barrel than for crude oil. This lower 
 scal burden nearly doubled the Well 
Head Revenue (‘WHR’) of production 
on a per barrel basis.
The combination of the higher ow 
rates and the much lower rate of MET 
currently makes condensate far more 
cash generative to produce and sell than 
crude oil. In the second half of the year, 
we capitalized on this and refocused 
our drilling strategy towards this 
condensate rich area. To do this, it was 
necessary to mobilize rigs and build 
an early processing facility (‘EPF’) to 
stabilize the condensate before it could 
be taken to its destination re nery by 
truck and rail. With the increase in gas and

Conclusion
Over the course of 2012, we increased our 
proved reserves base as well as the pace 
of well completions. We have completed 
the surface infrastructure necessary to 
build production and have engaged 
the necessary contractors to ensure 
an optimal well completion tempo. 
We identi ed signi cant contributions 
from higher-value condensate which 
has, in turn, driven a change in direction 
for our short-term initiatives. 
We have gained valuable insights into 
the characteristics of our eld in 2012, 
marking it out as a year of delineation 
for Ruspetro. Although there have been 
some disappointments, we have the 
measures in place to capitalize on the 
vast potential of our eld. The years 
ahead will draw on these insights to 
allow us to effectively exploit the 
intrinsic value of Ruspetro’s assets.

Outlook
Our main priority for 2013 is to deliver 
on our growing cash generation. We will 
continue to develop the gas-condensate 
play in the north of the eld. This will 
help to build our revenues and cash 
 ows, which will give us the exibility 
to grow our business signi cantly 
in the coming years. 
Building production and making sure 
that we execute our drilling program 
are the main tasks ahead of us now. 
We will look to expand our gas business 
to sell substantially all of the associated 
gas produced to third parties from the 
second half of 2014.
In our crude oil area, we will continue 
to expand water ood operations as 
we are now seeing stabilization, and 
in some cases increases, in reservoir 
pressures. This is beginning to generate 
production enhancement opportunities 
and will continue to do so in 2013. 
We will also look to resume drilling 
and increase the range of completion 
technologies used to optimize 
production from the varying geology 
of the eld in 2013.
With these aims in mind we are 
currently working with our lender 
to arrange the required nancing.
“ Our main priority for 2013 
is to deliver on our growing 
cash generation.”

taxation liabilities.
We improved our performance and grew our order book by 
delivering on our gameplan for the downturn. 
Converting operating profit to cash continues to be a strength 
of ours: cash conversion for the year was 107%, with free 
cash flow of £100 million and net cash at 31 March 2010 of 
£363 million. The Group remains debt free. 
During the recent recession our customers showed increased 
confidence in us — in our people, our technologies and our 
execution capabilities.

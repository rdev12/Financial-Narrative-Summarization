 Directors’ Report: Business Review
Chief Executive’s review
4_www.regus.com
Over the course of 2009 we have delivered a robust
performance which underscores the resilience of our
business model. Despite this once in a generation recession
and the extremely challenging and unpredictable trading
conditions which have resulted, the geographic and product
diversiﬁcation we have established – and continue to
develop – has beneﬁted us, and reﬂects the success of our
long term strategy in creating a balanced business mix.
Strategy
Our consistent long term strategy is that of measured, sustainable profitable
growth to maximise benefits for our stakeholders.
Business model
Companies of all sizes are able to leverage our diverse product range and
infrastructure to work in a more efficient manner.
Future prospects market moving to Regus
We believe there has been a fundamental structural shift toward flexible 
working, driven in part by the challenging economic environment which plays 
to our strengths. 
The nature of our business will ensure that we continue to drive
sustainable growth

Overall
The Group’s strategy of controlled and
disciplined growth has resulted in an
increase in total capacity (including non-
consolidated workstations) of 1.0% to
173,004 workstations in the year and the
number of actual workstations by 2.9% to
163,740 workstations as at 31 December
2009. The Group has opened 45 new
centres this year with the total number of
centres now standing at 983. The new
centres reﬂect the Group’s strategy of
focusing on diverse growth opportunities
with 87.0% of new centres opened on
variable or ﬂexible lease deals reﬂecting
the focus on low risk opportunities. New
locations included Brasilia in Brazil, Doha
in Qatar, Dakar in Senegal, Talinn in
Estonia and Platina in India.
Strategy and objectives 
Despite the severity of the current
downturn, our strategic approach
remains fundamentally unchanged – that
of continued proﬁt and cash generation
through controlled and disciplined
capacity growth. 
After 20 years in business, we have
barely scratched the surface of 
accommodating the way people work. 
By updating their workplace strategy,
companies will reduce overall facilities
expenses and will be in a stronger
position for success. Furthermore, with
forecast changes over the next decade
which could see the property market
fundamentally altered by huge increases
in energy and transport costs and
employee demand for a better work-life
balance, we feel uniquely positioned in
the market to support our current and
future customers. 
Against this backdrop of constant
economic and social change, we will
continue to seek to manage our business
in a sustainable way, which will have
positive impacts on the environment and
on the communities in which we operate.
We do not consider these goals mutually
exclusive to achieving our wider strategic
and ﬁnancial objectives, which continue
to be to pursue continued proﬁt and 
cash generation. 
We have taken aggressive action to
reduce our cost base and have remained
proﬁtable throughout the year. We
continue to re-evaluate our costs on an
ongoing basis and in particular look to
continue improving the efﬁciency of the
business model. In addition we will take
additional cost savings measures as
necessary and without delay, including
centre closures where continued
underperformance is anticipated. 
With continued cash generation producing
a free cash ﬂow of £80.3 million, we can
be conﬁdent that we enter 2010 with a
stronger balance sheet than was the case
twelve months ago. 
Our brand awareness continues to grow,
and whilst we are now present in 78
countries, we are conﬁdent that we can
continue to gain market share and expand
our global footprint further. We remain
ready to take advantage of sustainable
and proﬁtable opportunities for developing
our portfolio and for ensuring we are
appropriately positioned to take
advantage of a recovery when it arrives.

The fundamental drivers of our ability to
maximise what we see to be signiﬁcant
future opportunities for growth remain: 
• Needs of our customers.
• Systems and technology.
• People and processes.
Needs of our customers
It has been two decades since we
commenced trading from our ﬁrst centre
in Belgium, and our current portfolio of
nearly 1,000 centres in 78 countries is 
a testament to the growth and solidity 
of our brand, now recognised globally 
as the market leader.
Late in 2009 we undertook an extensive
survey of global business leaders to
assess what they felt the workplace of
the future could look like. The following
key trends were identiﬁed:
• Two thirds of business leaders were
implementing extensive innovations to
their workplace models over the next
three years, primarily through
implementing ‘socially-networked’
workplaces and ‘trust-based’ practices.
These initiatives actively encourage
employees to engage and collaborate
with likeminded people far beyond the
traditional workplace boundaries with 
a view to signiﬁcantly increasing
innovation and strengthening
competitive and creative developments.
• More than 40% of business leaders are
changing their workplace models to
become more collaborative in nature. 
• Technology continues to revolutionise
how individuals work and how
companies employ people – the
workforce is increasingly working from
home some of the time, with beneﬁts to
companies in terms of reduced ﬁxed-
ofﬁce space, and beneﬁts to employees
in reducing commute times and in
having an environmental upside. 
These ﬁndings also continue to be
supported by independent third party
studies which indicate that:
• it will be even more important in the
future to choose the best location for 
a business centre, avoiding locations
where workers have to commute long
distances by car; and 
• business centre operators will themselves
have to be ﬂexible in terms of what they
offer to their customers, and ready to
adapt to changes in both what clients
want and who the clients are.
In light of this, we continue to feel
strongly that the Regus product and
service offerings available accommodate
all businesses – regardless of size – and
are uniquely placed to accommodate

anticipated changes to the future
workplace on a global scale. Within the
current severe trading environment, the
Regus proposition also continues to offer
businesses immediate and effective cost
saving options with the added liquidity
advantage of no capital investment. 
Systems and technology 
Our global scope requires a constant
need for technological development 
and innovation and 2009 has been no
different. During the year: 
• we have launched our online service
agreement initiative, which involves
prospective clients being given online
visibility of their proposed, speciﬁc
agreement, in an easy to use way,
enabling them to conveniently sign-up 
to the agreement online on their PC,
without the need for printing, signing 
and faxing.
• booking of Meeting Rooms and
DayOfﬁces online via our real-time
reservation sites has been implemented.
Some 11% of all bookings now go
through this route, and we are growing
this number every month – with the
added beneﬁt of an increase in average
booking value via this route. The service
gives both a more convenient
experience for our clients as well as
reducing our cost of sale.
• there has been a further advanced
development of our centre front-desk
Point of Sale software. We now have 
a feature rich solution enabling full
support of our clients and centre teams
in this highly intuitive software.
• we have implemented our new
Business Data Warehouse, which now
sends out a daily action-targeted report
to every centre and salesperson in
Regus, who receive them at the start of
their day wherever they are around the
globe. These reports are used to focus
effort for the day, plan the coming days
and to improve overall performance.
We also continue to develop our internal
global inventory and reservation system
to meet the changing global demands of
our business. 
People and processes
After one of the most challenging years
for business that any of us can remember,
the efforts of all of our 5,500 team
members have been critical to weathering
the storm and to continuing to provide
the best level of service possible for our
customers. Our business relies upon 
our people, and from a strong platform
for growth in 2010, their continued
dedication and delivery will be critical 
to our maximising our potential. I would
therefore like to take this opportunity to

thank all of them throughout the Group
for their signiﬁcant efforts in the year. 
During 2009, we launched
“Reguscareers.com”, on a global basis,
and have seen this positively received 
by both employees and prospective
candidates alike. This interactive website,
tailored for our key global markets, allows
us to:
• highlight the wide variety of career
options available globally with Regus
• give a clear “day-in-the-life-of”
overview for a number of roles
throughout the Company; 
• provide career building guidance for
existing employees 
We have also considerably updated 
core elements of our learning and
development programmes to identify and
train the next generation of leaders, as
well as to ensure talented people within
our business are given the appropriate
training and encouragement to develop.
Speciﬁc examples in 2009 have included: 
• Creation of new sales content to reﬂect
changes to the sales process and newly
deﬁned roles.
• Introduction of ﬁeld-based Sales and
Operations Drills to reinforce critical
skills on a monthly basis.
• Development of Leadership Skills
Training for Area Directors, Area
Operations and Commercial Directors.
• Introduction of new ﬁeld manuals 
and a complete training suite to support
“SmartWorking” for centre and area
staff; driving forward consistency 
of approach and best practice in
customer service. 
• Creation of additional online learning
modules and assessments to reinforce
key knowledge and skill.
Responding to market conditions
Throughout 2009, and in line with our
previously communicated intentions, the
Group has continued to move decisively
to adapt its cost base to the increasingly
challenging trading conditions which
prevailed in the majority of its markets.
We have delivered full year cost savings
of £54.6 million when compared to 2008,
which exceeded our expectations but
which have not left us complacent. 
Costs continue to be monitored closely
and will be managed at a level which
ensures that they remain appropriate for
forecast activity levels. In addition, capital
spending is being carefully controlled to
ensure that we maximise as quickly as
possible the value of any investment 
we make and that we focus on growth
opportunities in the most resilient and
proﬁtable sectors of the global economy.
Working capital management also

remains a key focus for the business and
we have continued to manage our cash
ﬂow tightly.
At the same time, the Group has
continued to drive forward with a number
of initiatives to increase commercial and
operational efﬁciencies within its regions,
and we anticipate completion of the
migration of certain administrative
functions into our regional service centres
during 2010. We have already started 
to beneﬁt from certain cost savings
associated with these centralised
locations, and would expect to garner
operational efﬁciencies shortly. 
In December 2009, we implemented 
a restructuring plan to further develop
and accelerate our activities relating to
the development of our regional service
centres. This plan includes reductions in
our worldwide workforce, the closure of
certain underperforming facilities, and
reductions in other related asset values.
We incurred an exceptional charge of
£2.6 million in 2009 relating to the
delivery of the initial phases of this
restructuring plan. 
Board changes
I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank John Matthews and Martin
Robinson for their signiﬁcant contribution
to the business over the years. Their
leadership within Regus has been
considerable during their tenure and they
have proven real assets to the business.
Douglas Sutherland is an excellent
candidate to succeed John as Chairman
of Regus and we are delighted that he
has accepted the role. 
Outlook
While the outlook remains unclear,
particularly for the UK, we are cautiously
optimistic across our other three
geographies. We remain focused on
increasing revenues, ﬂexing our cost
base and further improving efﬁciency 
in order to restore our margin. We are
experiencing an increased level of growth
opportunities as the trend toward ﬂexible
working accelerates. This, combined 
with our strong cash position, will allow
us to step up our new centre opening
programme in 2010.
Mark Dixon 
Chief Executive 
22 March 2010
Grow our revenue
The augmentation of our diverse product range and widening our
partnerships will enable us to increase our customer base and cross 
sell additional new services to the customer.
Control our costs 
We will continue to identify and realise signiﬁcant cost savings through 
a combination of operational simpliﬁcation and leveraging the beneﬁts 
of scale. 
Grow our capacity 
The current economic situation is presenting us with excellent
opportunities to grow in a focussed and controlled way, both organically
and through acquisition.

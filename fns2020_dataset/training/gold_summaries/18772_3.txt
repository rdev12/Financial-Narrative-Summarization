CHAIRmAN’S St Ateme Nt
This has been a significant year for Inland Homes, with record 
breaking financial results achieved through the delivery of a well-
balanced strategy of new homes, land sales, land purchases and 
rental income. The Group’s results demonstrate that our small 
team has been highly successful in delivering and managing the 
significant increase in both turnover, profitability and shareholders’ 
funds achieved from our expanding housebuilding and the sale of 
consented land. 
our focus remains on development opportunities in Southern 
England in locations where the economy is strong and demand  
is high. 
Inland built and sold 248 private homes and 39 homes for housing 
associations with an average sale price of £264,000 for our 
private units. This is a 52% increase in overall completions when 
measured against the comparable period last year.
we completed the sale of 440 building plots (2014: 169 building 
plots) and our rental income was £0.8m, although this has 
increased significantly since the year end to £1.1m per annum.
During the financial year, Inland acquired 76 existing houses, 
together with undeveloped land, that was released by the Defence 
Infrastructure organisation at w ilton Park in Beaconsfield, 
Buckinghamshire. The Group intends to hold the houses as 
investment properties and we have seen a revaluation surplus on 
these properties of £14.5m at the balance sheet date.
These transactions have resulted in a record profit before tax of 
£34.0m (including the revaluation surplus on investment properties 
of £14.5m), an increase of 254% over the previous year. 
our varied portfolio of mainly 1, 2 and 3 bed homes are particularly 
popular with first time buyers and investors. The Government’s 
‘Help to Buy’ initiative is a very attractive incentive with 31% of our 
buyers taking advantage of this scheme during the financial year. 
we are pleased to note that this scheme has been extended by the 
Government to 2020. 
The forward sales position of homes that have been reserved or 
where contracts have been exchanged, is very strong at £31.1m.
The Group’s balance sheet has strengthened significantly over 
the previous period with cash balances of £21.4m at the year end 
and shareholders’ funds of £88.8m. Net borrowings amounted 
to £34.9m (2014 restated: £40.9m). Borrowings have increased 
post the year end date due to continuing investment in land 
opportunities and a further increase in work in progress.
Despite the substantial increase in plot sales with planning 
permissions and completed homes, I am pleased to report that the 
land bank has increased to a record 5,176 plots (2014: 3,734 plots), 
a significant achievement by any measure. 
The Group’s administrative expenses have increased as we 
continue to invest in quality personnel in a competitive  
marketplace and as a result of the substantial increase in the 
activities of the Group. 
Given the Group’s strong earnings, forward sales position and 
sound balance sheet, the Board is proposing to increase the 
final dividend by 17% to 0.7p per share (2014: 0.6p) subject to 
shareholders’ approval at the AGM which is to be held on  
14 December 2015. The final dividend will be paid to shareholders 
on 22 January 2016. Together with the interim dividend of 0.3p per 
share paid in July 2015 this brings the total dividends for the year 
to 1.0p, an increase of 67%.
Finally, I should like to extend my thanks once again to our small, 
highly motivated team led by our CEo, Stephen w icks, for their 
continued hard work during the year which has made these 
outstanding results possible.

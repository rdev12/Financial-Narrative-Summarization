Financial Highlights
 34% increase in revenue 
Revenue increased by 34 per cent to £98.8 million, principally due to an increase in revenue of
£23.6 million across the Vantage, Discretionary and Advisory divisions resulting from increased
assets under administration and management and a full year’s revenue on assets secured in the
previous year.  The proportion of recurring revenue i.e management fees, renewal commission
and interest, increased from 61% to 65%. 
 41% underlying operating profit margin 
The Group’s operating margin increased from 33 per cent to 41 per cent.  The increase resulted
from revenue growth, driven by higher asset values, which did not necessitate an equivalent rise
in costs.
 £10.2 billion total assets under
administration
The 67 per cent growth in asset values is attributable to strong new business volumes, the
addition of Hargreaves Lansdown shares to the platform (£805 million as at 30 June 2007), and
market growth. The FTSE All Share index increased by 15 per cent during the year, from
2967.58 to 3404.14.
 52% increase in underlying diluted EPS
From 4.2 pence to 6.4 pence.
 £13.4 million of investment revenue and
other gains
This is primarily due to the disposal of a number of investments during 2007, including
holdings in EMX Company Limited and the London Stock Exchange plc which resulted in net
gains of £11.9 million.

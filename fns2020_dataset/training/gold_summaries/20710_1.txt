 Group Chief Executive’s Statement
4 Alliance & Leicester
Introduction
Alliance & Leicester delivered a good set 
of ﬁnancial results in 2004. 
Pre-tax operating proﬁt was up 6% to
£556m. Underlying basic earnings per
share increased by 12% to 88.2p. Our
underlying post-tax return on equity
increased to 23.3%. These all exclude 
the £52m of pre-tax proﬁt from the sale 
of our merchant acquisition business in
April 2004, but include the one-off costs 
of £9m arising from the rationalisation 
of our branch network. The Board has
proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 32.6p per
share, making a total dividend of 48.3p, 
an increase of 10% on 2003.
By delivering 12% growth in underlying
basic earnings per share, we achieved our
primary strategic target of double digit
percentage growth in 2004. We also
achieved each of our supporting objectives
of accelerated revenue growth, cost savings
and a more efﬁcient capital base. 
These results have been delivered in a very
competitive environment and reﬂect the
clear and coherent strategies we have
developed for our Retail and Wholesale
Banking businesses. Our strategic focus 
is to deliver shareholder value by growing 
our franchise, driving down costs to
improve cost efﬁciency, and delivering 
a strong return on equity of around 20%.
This will be achieved whilst ensuring 
above average asset quality, through 
our responsible lending policies.
Retail Banking 
Retail Banking pre-tax proﬁt increased by
£5m to £446m, after charging the one-off
costs of £9m relating to the rationalisation
of the branch network. 
We saw franchise growth in each of our
Core 4 Retail Banking products, with
increased market shares in current account
openings, net mortgage lending and new
personal loans, and growth in personal
customer deposit balances.
Growing our current account base is central
to our strategy. Historically, current account
customers have been unwilling to switch
banks, but there is increasing evidence that
this is changing. For example, the Mintel
report on Financial Intelligence, published
in 2004, found that the number of
customers now wanting to switch 
current accounts has doubled over the 
past 2 years. Current account customers 
are proﬁtable in their own right and
provide a long term relationship, with the
potential for further product sales during
the life of that relationship. We opened
228,000 new current accounts in 2004, 
a 25% increase compared to 2003.
Our gross mortgage lending during 2004
was up 7% to £8.7bn, a market share 
of 3.0%. Net mortgage lending increased
by 22% to £2.5bn, a market share 
of 2.4%. Our mortgage lending in the
second half of 2004 was lower than that
achieved in the first half of the year,
reﬂecting our continued stance of only
targeting high quality and profitable
lending, and avoiding some market
segments which we regard as higher risk.
Our unsecured personal loan gross
advances were £2.3bn, 23% higher than 
in 2003. Asset quality remains very strong.
Our personal customer deposit balances
grew by £0.6bn to £19.5bn.
We supplement the Core 4 Retail Banking
products by providing products in
“Our coherent strategy and
business model is well 
aligned to the changing 
needs of customers.”

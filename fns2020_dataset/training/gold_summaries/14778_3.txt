 Introduction
I am pleased to report a year 
of significant progress and strong
financial results.
Stadium Electronics has developed
to become a single, cohesive
business unit offering flexible product
engineering and manufacturing
solutions to a growing base of key
customers. Enhanced capabilities
have enabled us to attract higher
value added projects, with associated
benefits of improved margins and
greater forward visibility.
During the second half of the year
our new operation offering domestic
sales into the rapidly growing
market in the People’s Republic 
of China opened for business.  
Whilst this operation made no
contribution to earnings this year, 
it represents a strategic opportunity
which we expect to bring benefits in
future.
Results
Profit before tax was £1.9m 
(2002: loss of £1.3m).
Profits before tax, exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation increased
by 49% to £1.9m (2002: £1.3m) and
borrowings were reduced further to
£1.6m giving year end gearing of
12%.
These results have been delivered
despite further weakening of the 
US dollar, which had an adverse
impact on the translation of 
earnings of Stadium Asia Limited 
at average rates of approximately 
8% year on year.
Shareholders
Stadium has continued to attract 
greater interest as a growth
investment and there has been
significant activity in the share
register. This has provided scope for
the welcome addition of a number
of major new institutional holders.  
In view of these good results and 
a favourable outlook, I am pleased 
to report our intention to return 
to a progressive dividend policy.
With this in mind, a final dividend 
of 1.95 pence per share will be paid
on 4 May 2004, bringing the total
for the year to 2.9 pence per share
(2002: 2.8 pence per share).
Outlook
It is becoming increasingly
important for many manufacturing
companies to access the rapidly
developing opportunities in China.
Stadium Asia is delivering these
benefits to a growing list of key
customers, and is well placed to
fulfil its growth potential through
repeat orders and further new 
business wins.

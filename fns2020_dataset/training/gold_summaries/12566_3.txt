DECEMBER 2007
NEW FURNACES INSTALLED AT THE
ULTRA-LARGE FORGE, REDUCING GAS USAGE
BY 50% AND IMPROVING BOTH PRODUCT
QUALITY AND THROUGHPUT.
It gives me pleasure to announce an outstanding
set of results for the Group, which surpassed all
original expectations for the year .
We are also on course to exceed one of the major
aims in our flotation strategy “to be a £40 million
turnover business within five years”, as the
Group achieved record exports to its Oil and Gas
exploration and production customers, as well as
winning selected overseas defence contracts.
RESULTS
Turnover increased to £23.7 million, compared
with £15.1 million in 2007 - a creditable rise of
over 50%. This increase in sales, combined with
ongoing operating efficiency gains, served to more
than double operating profits to £4.9 million
before exceptional items (2007: £1.9 million).
Profit before taxation was £5.0 million
(2007: £1.4 million) and earnings per share rose
to 31.6p (2007: 10.9p).
Despite long lead times from major suppliers,
I am pleased to confirm that our actions to
control working capital resulted in year end net
funds of £5.9 million (2007: £4.6 million).
The Board has agreed a progressive dividend
policy and is recommending a maiden final
dividend of 4.0 pence per share, giving a total
dividend for the year of 6.0 pence. If approved at
the Annual General Meeting, this dividend will
be paid on 12 March 2009 to shareholders
on the share register at the close of business on
13 February 2009. The ex-dividend date will be
11 February 2009.
STRATEGY
Our Business Growth Strategy, to penetrate key
growth sectors, notably global energy and high
pressure gases markets, establishing a
presence in new niche markets and acquire
businesses which offer synergistic benefits in
related niche sectors, is progressing:
Long term export contracts and orders have
been secured from overseas defence and
aerospace programmes in Europe and Asia.
As well as supplying assemblies to drilling rig
constructors, we are also continuing to win
orders for offshore diving support vessels.
In the industrial gas trailer refurbishment sector,
contracts have been secured stretching into 2009
from a major industrial gas supplier .
In the Compressed Natural Gas (“CNG”) and
Biogas sectors, we have signed an Agreement
with Greenlane
®
Biogas Limited, a New Zealand
based company with a market leading position
on Biogas upgrading technology. The UK lags
behind the rest of northern Europe in exploiting
an energy source that is growing at over 25% per
annum in those countries. Recent changes in UK
legislation will facilitate the growth of this energy
source in the UK gas market.
We continue to invest in R&D programmes,
including composite material cylinders and
internal selected surface coatings, which are
attracting interest from both industrial and
defence customers. Initial prototype products
are being manufactured and evaluated for
potential applications.
Key equipment has been procured and skilled
staff recruited that will enable us to target the
in-service field testing of ultra-large cylinders.
This sector is expected to develop as cylinders
in service start to require re-certification.
PEOPLE
We welcomed Philip Cammerman to the Board
as a Non-executive Director in April 2008 and
also James Lister, who was appointed Group
Finance Director on 1 June 2008. The Group
is already benefiting from their combined
expertise.
I am particularly pleased to report that the
achievements of our Chief Executive, John
Hayward, were recognised nationally when he
scooped the Ernst & Young Business Products
Entrepreneur of the Year Award 2008.
We strengthened our second tier management
and professional staff during the year under
review. Recognising that there is a skills
shortage in the UK, we have ramped up our
engineering training and apprentice programmes.
The Group is also well positioned geographically
to benefit from local universities and Research
Institutes which have maintained sound technical
faculties - including Sheffield University, Hallam
University and NAMTEC. Our future as a
value-driven engineered products business
depends on our investment in engineering and
metallurgical skills and resources.
It is appropriate to acknowledge the skill, hard
work and support of our Operational Directors
and all our employees in contributing to another
successful year for our business.
Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for
their support of the Company throughout the year .
PROSPECTS
Pressure Technologies has entered the new
financial year with a record order book of
£23 million (2007: £18.0 million) giving clear
visibility throughout 2009 and into 2010. There
remains a shortage of semi submersible and
deepwater drilling rigs to support the world’s
demand for hydrocarbons and we are enthused
by the medium term prospects of the CNG and
Biogas sector, in which Chesterfield BioGas is
already developing a significant tender pipeline.
The Company continues to evaluate synergisitic
acquisitions, particularly in the light of our cash
resources and the opportunities now being
presented in the market.
The Board is confident that Pressure Technologies
will deliver further growth in the short term and,
as we roll out our diversification strategy on a
controlled and profit driven basis, the medium to
long term future of the Group remains strong.

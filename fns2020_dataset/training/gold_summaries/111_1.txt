888 Holdings plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
2014 Overview
Another record-breaking 
year
This excellent financial result 
reflects the fundamental 
strengths of our business 
and the continued execution 
of our focused strategy. 
Innovation and technology 
leadership are at 888’s core 
and we have continued to 
enhance our offering to 
ensure that our customers 
always play the most 
enjoyable games in the 
safest possible environment. 
Underpinning this focus are 
our technology platform and 
analytical capabilities which 
together deliver industry-
leading marketing strategies 
that enable the Group to 
attract more players to the 
888 brand and increase 
customer lifetime value. This 
was evidenced by the number 
of active players in Casino 
and Poker increasing as at 
Q4 2014 by seven and eight 
per cent. respectively, against 
the prior year.
888’s Casino offering has 
again been a key driver 
behind the Group’s success, 
delivering consistent stand-
out growth reflecting the 
quality of our product as well 
as our unrivalled heritage in 
this vertical. In Poker, I am 
delighted that we maintained 
our position at number two 
in the PokerScout* global 
rankings at the year end and 
Chief Executive’s Review
I am delighted to report that 2014 was 
another exceptional year for 888 as the 
Group delivered all-time-high revenues, 
further enhanced profitability and 
maintained strong cash generation. 
were able to deliver stable 
revenue in a market which 
many other operators have 
found challenging. In Bingo, 
we continued to benefit from 
the strategic decision we took 
during 2013 to restructure 
the division as we performed 
well in what remained a 
competitive and mature 
market. The performance of 
888Sport was undoubtedly 
a major highlight in 2014 
as revenue increased in 
this important vertical by 
115% against the prior year 
reflecting the standard of 
our offer since re-launching 
the product in May 2013. 
Underpinning our growth 
across verticals has been our 
leading mobile proposition 
as more and more customers 
choose to play on touch 
devices, benefitting from the 
unrivalled accessibility and 
usability they provide. We 
were also pleased with the 
revenue growth delivered by 
Dragonfish, our leading B2B 
offer, which was driven by 
our US operations as well as 
further progress on our Bingo 
business. 
The excellent overall progress 
we made in 2014 is testament 
to our highly skilled and 
dedicated team and, as ever, 
I would like to thank everyone 
at 888 for their hard work 
during the year. As described 
in the Chairman’s statement 
and as previously announced, 
2014 was my final full year as 
CEO of 888. I look back on my 
three years as CEO with pride 
as the business has delivered 
transformational growth in 
its core markets and entered 
new regulated markets in 
Spain, Italy and the US which 
provide a strong platform 
for future development. 888 
boasts one of the most 
dynamic and talented teams 
in the industry and I look 
forward to continuing to 
provide guidance and support 
to the rest of the executive 
team as 888 continues to 
develop in the years to come. 
* As at 17 March 2015.

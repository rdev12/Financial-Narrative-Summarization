 In our Interim Announcement 
in November we commented on
our experience of slow markets 
and that we expected further
consolidation within the foundry
sector. Activity continued at a
disappointingly low level until the
end of January but since that 
time we have experienced some
improvement in general demand.
In addition to this there have been
a number of foundry closures
which have benefited our order
books.  However at the same 
time we have experienced very
significant increases in the price of
ferrous raw materials, driven by
rapidly escalating global prices, 
and it has been difficult to 
achieve timely price rises from 
our customers to adequately
compensate for these.
Overall, turnover for the year was
1% higher than in 2003 at
£27.31m. Operating profit was
reduced to £1.007m (£1.373m
previously), largely due to pressure
on margins resulting from the raw
material price rises referred to
above. Profit before tax was
£1.013m compared to £0.908m
previously. Earnings per share were
9.6p (9.0p previously). The Balance
Sheet remains strong with net cash
of £482,000 (£692,000 previously)
at the year end. The Directors 
are recommending an unchanged
final dividend of 8.00p, making 
a total for the year of 11.85p
(2003: 11.85p)
We announced in March our
agreement to purchase certain
assets and the business of Russell
Castings in Leicester. Following
shareholder approval at our EGM
on 2nd April we completed this
transaction, significantly extending
our foundry operations. We are
exploring the synergy opportunities
for Russell Castings with our
existing foundries and are pleased
to be joined by an excellent 
team that will complement our
existing staff.  
For the first time for some while all
of the foundry sites are now
operating at budgeted levels of
volume, although the problem of
rising raw material prices has
continued. We have also seen 
some improvement in demand for
our safety and security products,
albeit of a more modest amount.
Overall we expect to see a return 
to growth in the year ahead aided
by Russells, although as indicated in
the circular posted to shareholders
at the time of the acquisition, some
non-recurring restructuring costs
are anticipated in order to maximise
the opportunities available.

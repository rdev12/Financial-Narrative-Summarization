Key Performance Indicators
The Board considers the key performance indicators by which it measures the performance of the Group 
to be revenue, recurring revenue (both the level and the percentage of total revenue), gross margin, profit 
from operations and earnings per share, both adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles, acquisition 
costs, exceptional reorganisation costs and exceptional income. The performance indicators used by the 
Group are summarised below and the table sets out K3’s performance for the year under review.
Revenue is the gross revenue as reported 
in the financial statements, comprising 
software, hardware, consultancy, and 
support and managed services. This is 
a key measure of activity within each 
business segment and for the Group as 
a whole.
Gross margin percentage is calculated as 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
This measure identifies the level of 
contribution derived from each sale or 
component thereof. 
Adjusted profit from operations is 
calculated as profit from operations per 
the financial statements, adjusted for 
the impact of amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, acquisition costs, exceptional 
reorganisation costs and exceptional 
income. This is a key performance 
indicator for quoted companies.
Adjusted operating cash percentage 
is the operating cash generated after 
adding back cash flows in respect 
of regularising liabilities that were 
significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at 
the date of acquiring companies and 
trades, acquisition costs, exceptional 
reorganisation costs and exceptional 
income, divided by the adjusted 
operating profit. This is a key indicator in 
measuring the Group’s ability to convert 
operating profit into cash. 
Adjusted EPS is calculated as profit 
for the period, adjusted for the 
tax affected impact of acquired 
intangibles amortisation, exceptional 
reorganisation costs, acquisition costs 
and exceptional income, divided by 
the weighted average number of 
shares during the period. This is a key 
performance indicator for quoted 
companies. 
Recurring revenue is the income 
provided for annual licence renewals 
and support for software used by our 
customers. This is a key indicator in 
measuring the underlying resilience and 
growth of the business.
Percentage of recurring revenue 
measures the growth of income 
providing core stability to the business.

Revenues at the SYSPRO and Sage 
Division (which comprises four business 
units) increased by 54% to £24.96m 
(2011: £16.17m), with the majority of 
the increase reflecting our acquisitions. 
These contributed £7.55m of revenue. 
Adjusted profit from operations
*10
 rose 
by 40% to £5.86m (2011: £4.17m), with 
acquisitions contributing £1.15m of 
adjusted operating profit
*11
. It should 
be noted that our Sage activity typically 
delivers lower operating margins 
compared to our SYSPRO activities. 
Our SYSPRO business secured nine order 
wins in total worth £0.9m compared 
with nine worth £0.5m last year, a 
marked improvement. Lead intake is 
holding up well (235 leads compared 
with 201 last year) and the pipeline 
value is currently 76% higher than last 
year, at £4.4m. Of this, approximately 
£1.8m is new customer business and 
£2.6m is potential new orders from the 
existing user base. This compares to a 
pipeline worth £2.5m last year, where 
potential new customers represented 
£1.6m of the value.
Our SYSPRO customers continue 
to generate high levels of recurring 
revenues through annual software 
licence renewals. These are collected 
between October and December, and 
licence renewals in the year were in 
excess of 98%, in line with historic levels. 
The SYSPRO maintenance licence and 
support income is worth approximately 
£6.48m per annum (2011: £6.25m 
per annum) and 85% of the income is 
recognised in the first half of our financial 
year, giving the first half a significant 
weighting against the second half. 
We entered the Sage marketplace in 
November 2010, with the acquisition 
of Panacea and through a number of 
subsequent acquisitions have now 
established a leading position as a Sage 
supplier, providing the full range of Sage 
products, from Sage 50 to enterprise level 
Sage X3. Our Sage customer base now 
stands at 922 customers and generates 
recurring annual income of around 
£6.20m (2011: £2.19m). In July 2011, 
we acquired Fifth Dimension Systems 
Ltd and, in October 2011, the business 
secured the Sage Enterprise Partner of 
the Year award, which entitles it to higher 
margins in the next year. We are in the 
process of merging our Sage operations 
under one Managing Director. 
Our Sage operations secured 58 deals 
worth £2.20m (2011: 16 deals worth 
£0.30m). While the Sage support market 
is highly price competitive, we continue 
to attract customers from other Sage 
partners. Mirroring the model we are 
deploying for our Microsoft and SYSPRO 
customers, we will be cross-selling 
our Cloud Computing solutions to our 
new Sage customer base and have a 
deployment model already operational 
for the Sage 200 product. 
Our other two business units in the 
Division have customers who can be 
offered upgrade opportunities to our 
SYSPRO or AX solutions and hosting. 
These businesses contributed £2.71m 
(2011: £2.20m) of sales in the year, of 
which £2.08m is recurring (2011: £1.68m).

International Division
Results from the International Division, 
based in The Netherlands, were 
exceptionally good this year. Revenues 
increased by 40% year-on-year to 
£12.65m (2011: £9.05m) and adjusted 
profit from operations
*12
 rose by 57% 
to £3.67m (2011: £2.34m) excluding 
exceptional income from the sale 
of IP of £0.76 (2011: £nil), with our 
acquisition contributing £2.40m to 
revenues and £0.66m to adjusted profit 
from operations
*13
. These results are in 
part due to the strengthening of our 
relationship with Inter IKEA Systems BV 
(the owner and franchisor of The IKEA 
Concept and worldwide IKEA franchisor), 
the largest customer in the Division. 
At the end of the financial year, we 
signed an exclusive minimum five year 
agreement with the company to support 
and develop the IKEA Master Version 
software (“IMV”) used by franchisees 
outside the IKEA group. The growth 
with this customer has offset some 
weakening in the Dutch fashion market 
in the second half. 
Also contributing to the Division’s 
excellent results was the performance 
of our international partner channel for 
K3’s IP . Sales into this reseller channel 
have increased by 56% to £1.19m as a 
result of investment in the Pebblestone 
solution that was made over the last 
18 months and a rationalisation of the 
reseller base.
In December 2011, we acquired certain 
assets of Unisoft BV, a leading provider 
of retail point of sale solutions in 
Holland and Scandinavia. The solutions 
complement our existing offering and 
create cross-selling opportunities. The 
maintenance base for this business is 
weighted toward the second half of 
the K3 financial year producing post 
acquisition revenue of £2.40m and 
adjusted profit from operations
*13
  
of £0.66m.
The Division also generated excellent 
levels of services income and we 
recruited additional resource in the 
second half year in Holland and in 
our Far East office in Singapore which 
services our customers in that region.
We signed 61 new contracts in the 
period, worth a total of £3.3m (2011: 
14 contracts, £2.7m). The increase 
in deal numbers reflects the smaller 
deals prevalent in Unisoft and the 
reseller channel. Looking ahead, the 
prospects pipeline currently amounts 
to approximately £3.7m. This excludes 
potential business anticipated in the 
long term plan with Inter IKEA  
Systems BV.

Microsoft UK Division
Our Microsoft UK Division experienced 
a challenging year. Revenues increased 
to £24.92m, up 9% over the year (2011: 
£22.88m), including a combined 
contribution of £1.87m from the Azurri 
and Retail Systems Group Limited 
(“RSG”) acquisitions made in the first half 
of the financial year. However adjusted 
profit from operations
*14
 was down 20% 
year-on-year to £2.22m (2011: £2.78m), 
notwithstanding the inclusion of an 
adjusted £0.38m contribution*
15
 from 
the acquisitions. 
The decrease in operating profit (pre 
acquisitions) reflected both the tough 
trading conditions and major investment 
we are making in our retail software 
offering, in particular bringing the 
Microsoft AX product in line with our 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV portfolio. 
We also invested in our sales and 
delivery resource in advance of sales of 
this product offering. The cost of our 
investment was £0.70m with a further 
£0.22m capitalised as development costs. 
Our acquisitions of Azurri and RSG have 
brought some notable benefits to the 
Division. RSG, one of the leading providers 
of Microsoft Dynamics ‘RMS’ to retailers in 
the UK and Ireland, brings us a software 
suite suitable for smaller retailers and 
therefore widens our marketplace. It also 
has a managed service offering 
which further expands K3’s own growing 
Managed Services Division. RSG has 
closed 21 new business deals since 
acquisition, worth a total of £0.76m. Azurri, 
which supports the retail solutions used 
by several major high street retailers, 
brings us additional recurring income 
and potential customers for our Microsoft 
Dynamics products.
The Microsoft UK retail business 
secured £5.9m of new business wins 
compared to £5.6m last year after a 
slow start, closing seven major new 
deals, including our first major order for 
Microsoft’s new AX for Retail solution 
in a contract we won with Eason. The 
agreement has been structured so 
that Microsoft is the prime delivery 
contractor, with K3 providing the 
specialist retail modules required. 
Other significant AX deals include 
Grafton, Wynsors and Weird Fish, with 
the remaining deals being NAV multi-
channel offerings. The deals were closed 
late in each half year and therefore have 
resulted in low services income to date 
with the focus to date being on scoping 
and system discovery rather than on 
high levels of implementation. Our 
multi-channel offering, incorporating 
our own IP , continues to support our 
performance on NAV. The prospects 
pipeline for the UK retail business stands 
at approximately £21.0m (2011: £19.0m), 
with over 50% focused on our Microsoft 
AX Multi Channel retail solution. We are 
hopeful that a number of these deals 
will close in the first half of the new 
financial year. 
In the course of our Group 
reorganisation to create the Microsoft 
UK Division, we integrated our other 
smaller Microsoft-based software units 
under a single management team to 
achieve cost savings and efficiencies. 
This business unit closed 12 deals worth 
£0.9m in the year, including wins with 
Prices Candles, Refrigeration Vehicles, 
Sportsman Guns and High Mark. During 
the year we also established a lower-cost 
implementation process, adapting our 
model for current conditions.
In the light of the weak trading 
performance of our process 
manufacturing AX business, we took the 
decision to restructure it, reducing the 
cost base by £0.75m per annum. The 
cost of this restructuring is included in 
exceptional costs. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

Managed Services Division
The Managed Services Division offers 
a range of application solutions both 
on-premises, hosted and via Software as 
a Service using hosting centres in New 
York, London, Edinburgh and Toronto. 
Revenue rose by 16% to £5.43m  
(2011: £4.70m) but more noteworthy is 
the 36% increase in the year end run rate 
of recurring income to £3.58m  
(2011: £2.64m) of which around £195,000 
per month (2011: £115,000 per month) 
or £2.34m annualised is hosting revenue. 
As expected, profits lagged revenue 
growth as we added £1.16m of additional 
resource. Divisional overheads have 
increased to £2.99m (2011: £1.41m), 
capitalised development was £0.38m and 
capital expenditure was £0.84m. Adjusted 
result from operations
*16
 was £nil (2011: 
profit of £0.54m). We now have platforms 
in place for the hosting of SYSPRO, 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Sage 200 
software and are seeing a good demand 
for these and the other complementary 
services we can offer from “the Cloud” . 
Our deployment now ranges from on-site 
managed services to fully hosted services 
provided on a multi-tenanted solution in 
the Cloud. The final quarter of the year 
saw an acceleration of new deployments 
and included a substantial new SYSPRO 
order in Canada. We are also launching 
hosting with SYSPRO Australia and have 
launched ‘mini-SYSPRO’ hosting with a 
low cost option for up to 10 users.
Currently, the prospects pipeline stands at 
£2.65m of potential income (2011: £1.30m).

Central costs for the year amounted 
to £0.41m (2011: £0.25m). These 
costs included Directors’ costs, group 
human resources, accounting and 
legal personnel, and costs associated 
with the Plc including financing. The 
costs are stated net of recovery of 
elements recharged to the operating 
units and are higher year on year due to 
additional costs arising from the acquired 
companies and foreign exchange costs.
We made a total of five significant 
acquisitions in the year and these have 
been reorganised to fit into our divisional 
structure at a cost of £0.56m (2011: 
£0.45m invested to create our new Group 
structure, following four significant 
acquisitions). In addition we rationalised 
the structure of our Sage and non-retail 
AX operations at a cost of £0.26m and 
incurred costs of £0.14m in relation to the 
strategic review and sale process.

Strategy and Objectives
The Board believes that K3 has the 
potential to build on its current position 
as a leading supplier of SME and mid-tier 
supply chain management solutions, 
with a particular emphasis on “hosted 
applications” and “cloud computing” . 
Acquisitions also form a key part of the 
growth strategy. Nearer term, the Board’s 
main objectives are to: 
•	 achiev e 	 g r o wth 	 in 	 our 	 tar get 	 mar kets;
•	 cr ea t e 	 shar eholder 	 v alue 	 thr ough

•	 g r o w 	 r ecur r ing 	 inc ome 	 lev els 	 and
•	 achiev e 	 pr og r essiv e 	 incr eases 	 in 	 the

Outlook
While the economic climate remains 
challenging, and we have to remain 
responsive to market changes, we 
view K3’s growth prospects positively. 
The acquisitions we have made in the 
financial year under review, as well as 
in the prior year, have strengthened 
the Group and added to our stream 
of annually recurring income. We also 
see substantial growth opportunities, 
especially in Managed Services and 
our International operations, which 
will drive recurring income, profit and 
cash generation in the medium term. 
We are continuing with our investment 
programme to develop our product 
offerings, especially Microsoft Dynamics 
AX and Managed Services, and see the 
new financial year as one of investment, 
with the benefits to come over the 
course of 2013 and beyond.

 Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 6
Chairman’s statement
Keith Henry
Chairman
the project received a positive ruling 
from the Commission charged by the 
Ministry of Environment with ruling on 
the Ombrina Mare oil and gas field 
development EIA. We look forward to 
progressing the development of this 
cornerstone asset over the next few 
years.
A second important development was 
the completion of the sale in February 
2013 of 75% of MOG’s wholly owned 
subsidiary Phoenicia Energy Company 
Limited (‘PECL’) to Genel Energy plc 
(‘Genel’). PECL owns the exploration 
and production rights to Area 4 
offshore Malta. MOG was able to 
secure a consideration that returned 
$10 million of prior years’ costs, 
together with a 100% carry of the cost 
for the first exploration well planned to 
be drilled in Q4 2013, plus a 100% carry 
of the cost for the second exploration 
well up to a maximum of US$30 million 
gross expenditure.
Dear Shareholder,
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc (‘MOG’, 
the ‘Group’ or the ‘Company’) is 
pleased to announce the Company’s 
2012 results.
After more than a year with the 
Company I am pleased to be able to 
report on behalf of the Board the 
continuation of the transformation of 
the Company that was started in 2011.
A key development for 2012 was the 
introduction of a new law in Italy that 
provides an exemption for the 
Ombrina Mare development from the 
offshore ban to all new exploration 
and production activity that was 
introduced in 2010 after the Macondo 
incident in the Gulf of Mexico. This 
exemption has enabled the Company 
to seek the approval of the 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) submitted in 2009. We are 
currently in the final stages of that 
approval, having recently heard that 
‘ We have continued the 
transformation of the 
Company started in 
201 1 and we are 
building on our abilities 
to advance the value 
of our portfolio in the 
year ahead.’ Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements

Production for the year was 
underpinned by the Guendalina field, 
which produced in-line with our 
expectations, averaging net to MOG 
4.1 million scf/d (116,000 scm/d) and 
accounted for 84% of total net 
production. The field reserves were 
re-certified post the reporting period in 
line with the previous year’s report. As  
a result of the strong revenues from 
Guendalina and our onshore Italy 
assets, the Company has continued to 
strengthen its net assets, which will 
help us to achieve our key commercial 
objectives and growth strategy going 
forwards.
Cash and cash equivalents at the 
period end was €8.7 million, which has 
since been strengthened through the 
receipt of cash equivalent to €7.7 
million from completion of the Genel 
transaction post period end. Net 
cashflow from operations in 2012 were 
€6.5 million, up from €1.1 million in 2011, 
more than covering operating 
expenses.
During 2012 a number of changes 
were made to the membership of the 
Board and the Executive Management 
Team. Jake Ulrich and I joined the 
Company in January 2012 as Non-
Executive Directors, and Dr William ‘Bill’ 
Higgs joined as MOG’s Chief Executive 
in March. During the year Miles 
Donnelly, Michael Seymour and 
Salvatore Russo stepped down from 
the Board and I am very grateful to 
them for their support, particularly to 
Salvatore Russo who had served as a 
Director since the formation of the 
Company in 2005. Chicco Testa and 
Dr Peter Jackson joined the Board in 
October 2012 and in January 2013 
respectively. I am confident we have a 
Board of Directors that is well placed to 
guide the Company through its next 
phase of development.
Outlook
There is no doubt that 2013 will be 
another important year in the growth 
of the Company. During the period we 
expect to receive the approval of the 
EIA and the award of the Production 
Concession for Ombrina Mare, thereby 
enabling the Company to drill a pilot 
appraisal well in early 2014, targeting 
the transformation of 2P reserves into 
1P reserves and contingent resources 
into reserves. We will also continue with 
the preparations to drill the first Hagar 
Qim exploration well offshore Malta, 
which, with our partner Genel, we plan 
to spud before the end of the year.
MOG continues to build up a very 
experienced technical and 
management team highly capable of 
exploring and developing oil and gas 
assets. To that end the Board remains 
focused and committed to growing 
the Company and we are actively 
seeking additional opportunities to 
expand our current portfolio.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
thank our shareholders and employees 
for their continued support of the 
Company.

CHieF exeCutive ’s r eview
We have had another active year and I am pleased to report significant progress across 
several areas. Our stated business plan remains on track and we continue to achieve this 
while maintaining compliance with the terms of our Production Sharing Contract, applicable 
laws and sound standards of health and safety. We have successfully started the second phase 
of production, as per the ‘Gas Sale Contract’ with GAIL, and the enhanced revenue/receipts 
commenced from 1
st
 October 2012. We have also continued with our appraisal program 
and have completed significant drilling and testing, confirming and establishing further gas 
presence. During the year, we also obtained a new reserve report which significantly increased 
our reserves and resources. A summary of activities since April 2012 is provided below:
sgl F ield d evelopment
During the year, a total quantity of 2,444 mmscf of gas was produced from the field and 
supplied to GAIL. There were no major breakdowns and our buyer met their respective 
obligations under the ‘Take or Pay (ToP)’ agreement. The ToP obligation on the second phase 
production for GAIL started from 1
st
 October and the Company invoiced a total ToP amount 
of US$ 11.66 mn in addition to the sales revenue of US$ 8.06 mn from gas supplies, during 
the year. With the start of the second phase, the price of gas has also gone up to US$ 5.00 
per mmbtu. 
For implementation of this Phase II, the required Gas Gathering Station (‘GGS’) including 
the gas processing plant, the CO2 removal plant and other equipment has been successfully 
installed. A sufficient number of production wells have also been drilled and completed. 
As part of its future gas development, the Company is negotiating for another off take 
agreement with GAIL for the supply of an additional 28 mmscfd (net of CO2) gas for a 
new 160 MW power plant proposed to be set up in Ramgarh, alongside the existing power 
generation capacity of 270 MW. The ultimate gas buyer, Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan 
Nigam Limited (RRVUNL), the State Electricity Company in Rajasthan, has already received 
the turbine and is soon to start its installation. This plant is solely based on the enhanced gas 
supplies from the SGL field. There is no other source of gas nearby and the imported gas is 
very costly, with no pipeline infrastructure to transport imported gas. The recent price increase 
approval by the Indian Government will greatly help in finalizing and the signing of this new 
off take agreement. 
d rilling , s eismiC , Completion o perations and r eserves
Operational activities over the last year have largely followed the Group’s various objectives: 6
a) appraisal drilling covering as large an area as possible to be able to retain the 
maximum potential development area upon completion of the appraisal phase in late 
2013 under the Production Sharing Contract; 
b) drilling and completion of production wells for the SGL Field Development continued 
as planned to meet contracted gas sale requirements; 
c) testing various wells previously drilled, where gas shows were encountered to enable 
the Group to increase its reserve base; and 
d) testing the tight gas recovery potential in addition to conventional gas discovered in 
the Pariwar formation. 
During the year, Indus has been acquiring in phases new seismic data, giving more clarity on 
the block potential and providing additional drilling prospects. Some of these new prospects 
have been drilled or are being drilled and a few more are proposed to be drilled soon. Some 
of the existing formation which had earlier shown encouraging results have been further 
drilled and tested. A number of wells drilled during the year have shown the presence of gas. 
The details of the wells, which were drilled during the year, are as follows:
SGL-9 (3155m) Gas Producer (Pariwar)
Well SGL-9 terminated at 3155 metres within the uppermost parts of the P10 Reservoir zone. 
The well was completed with a barefoot open hole completion from 3048-3152m which 
covered the P20 zone and the uppermost P10 reservoir zone. The well is currently flowing 
from the P10 and P20 reservoir zones. 
SGL-10 (3311m) Gas Producer (Pariwar)
SGL-10 terminated at 3311m within the lowermost parts of the Pariwar P10 Reservoir 
Zone. The well was cased and a zone from 3171-3176m within the P20 reservoir zone was 
perforated and completed for production. This interval is currently on production. 
SGL-2A (3895m) Gas Producer (Pariwar)
SGL-2A was drilled to 3895m, terminating within the upper B&B Formation. The well 
encountered gas shows within the Upper B&B Target sands and the Pariwar Formation 
reservoir sands. The well was cased and a zone from 3163-3169m within the P10 Reservoir 
zone was perforated and completed for production and is producing currently. 
SX-3 (3606m) Gas Shows (Pariwar Formation)
Well SX-3 is located in the extreme south-western parts of Block RJ-ON/6. The primary aim of 
this well was to test Pariwar reservoir sands in which gas shows were encountered in nearby  7
SX-2, but completion complications in that well led to test results being inconclusive. Gas was 
encountered in the same Pariwar reservoir zones in SX-3 and subsequently an interval from 
3294-3299m was selected for perforation. This interval has flowed gas to surface during 
testing. Testing of additional intervals will be undertaken soon to determine commerciality. 
SU–1(SUHF-1) (4003m) Gas Shows (Pariwar and B&B Formations)
Appraisal well SU-1 terminated in the lower B&B sands and encountered gas shows within 
the Pariwar and B&B Formations. At present, one zone from the lower B&B Formation target 
interval has been perforated from 3867-3870m and gas has been recovered to surface from 
this zone but with low rates of flow. This interval is currently under assessment for further 
testing and potential hydro fracture stimulation. On the basis of well log analysis one further 
zone in the lower B&B, plus two upper B&B and two additional Pariwar Formation zones have 
been identified as potential targets for further testing. 
S – 97 (3341m) Gas Shows (Pariwar Formation)
S-97 terminated in the upper parts of the Pariwar Formation in which key gas shows were 
encountered from the target reservoir zones. An initial open hole Drill Stem Test (DST) from 
3129-3182m flowed gas to surface with a FTHP of 200 psi on a 2” choke. A subsequent zone 
from 3175-3178m was perforated which flowed gas and water to surface. This well is under 
review for further testing.
EP – 2A (4146m) Gas Shows (Pariwar and B&B Formation)
Key gas shows have been encountered in the main Pariwar reservoir zones and the upper B&B 
Formation sands in well EP-2A, with two zones (3808-3811m and 3846-3870m) currently 
high-graded for further testing in the upper B&B Formation.
PR – 2 (3269m) Gas shows (Pariwar Formations)
PR-2 terminated in the upper parts of the Pariwar Formation in which key gas shows were 
encountered in the main P10 Pariwar reservoir zone sands. A perforation interval from 
3157m-3165m successfully flowed gas to surface but sustained flow rates were low. This 
interval and an additional interval with good gas shows based on wire line log analysis are 
under review for further testing and potential hydro fracturing stimulation.
NQL -1 (3635m) Gas shows (Pariwar Formations)
Well NQL-1 terminated in the uppermost B&B Formation. The well has encountered multiple 
zones with gas shows based on drill shows and wire line log analysis, with eight potential 
zones in total are currently under review for further testing. 8
Brent – 1 (3254m) Dry Hole Minor Gas shows only
Well BRENT-1 terminated in the uppermost Jaisalmer Formation. This well was drilled in 
a structurally shallow/up-dip location to the east of the other wells in RJ-ON/6 to test the 
eastern extent of the Pariwar/B&B Petroleum System. Minor gas shows were encountered in 
the Pariwar P10 reservoir zone and mid B&B Formation but no objects have been currently 
identified for further testing.
LILOI –1 (3384m) Gas shows (Pariwar Formations)
Key gas shows were encountered in LILOI-1 well in the main Pariwar P10 reservoir zone in 
which the well terminated. A zone from 3157-3165m was perforated which has flowed gas 
to surface, albeit with sub-commercial flow rates recorded to-date. This zone and two further 
Pariwar P10 reservoir intervals are currently under review for further testing.
During the year, the Company has completed eight appraisal wells and has encountered 
gas shows in a large number of these wells. Most of these wells are in testing stages and are 
critical in establishing our right to retain the maximum area in the block, once the appraisal 
period comes to an end by the end of this year. This will also help us in establishing more 
reserves and resources. Since many of these wells have multi-zone gas shows, the Company 
is evaluating an optimum strategy for multi-zone testing and completion. 
In December 2012, Indus published an updated reserves report, reflecting work done since 
2010 but, due to timing, excluded wells drilled outside the SGL area in the second half of 
2012. The report saw a significant increase in both reserves and resources, with gross 2P 
reserves increased to 573 Bcf from 307 Bcf in 2010. Net 2P reserves increased from 210 Bcf 
to 449 Bcf. 2C gross contingent resource also saw a meaningful increase, from 1,808 Bcf to 
2,699 Bcf, and over 1 Tcf of gross prospective resource was attributed to wells outside the SGL 
development area.
FinanCials
During the financial year, the Company supplied 2,444 mmscf of gas and invoiced revenues of 
US$ 8.06 mn (2011/12 US$ 6.76 mn), resulting in reported operating profit of US$ 4.54 mn 
(2011/12 US$3.98 mn). The reported profit after tax was US$ 1.39 mn (2011/12 
US$1.36 mn) after considering foreign exchange gains of US$ 0.03 mn and interest costs of 
US$ 1.49 mn. 
Indus additionally received take or pay payment of US$ 11.66 mn for the period, which is 
considered as deferred revenues and shown as liabilities since these receipts can be potentially 
set off against future gas supplies to GAIL, provided such supplies are over and above 90% 
of the contracted quantities, subject to certain restrictions as to the period in which such set off 
can be made. An amount of US$ 5.08 mn is shown as current liabilities and the remaining  9
US$ 6.58 mn is shown as non-current liabilities. Current liabilities include the maximum 
amount for which the Company is obliged to supply gas against the ToP amount received, in 
the next twelve months. Further the Company is not obliged to supply the gas over and above 
100% of the contracted quantities in any given period. In the event, the set-off terms are not 
complied with, the Company has no further obligation to return back ToP amounts. Since the 
amount of “ToP” invoiced is non-refundable, the management considers this amount as a 
revenue & profit adjustment and accordingly adjusted consolidated revenues, operating profit 
and profit before tax for the year were respectively US$ 19.72 mn, US$16.20 mn & US$ 
14.73 mn after including “ToP” amount of US$ 11.66 mn.
While, the Company is not expected to pay any significant taxes on its income for many years 
in view of 100% deduction allowed under Indian income tax act on the capital expenses in 
the Block, the Company has accrued notional non-cash deferred tax liability of US$ 1.68 mn 
as per IFRS requirements. 
Post this deferred tax liability provision, the net profit for the year was US$ 1.39 mn.
The expenditure on exploration and evaluation assets during the year was US$ 53.57 mn. 
Also subsequent to the certification of new 2P reserves of 266 bcf in the SSF area within 
the SGL field, an amount of US$ 76.14 mn has been transferred from exploration and 
evaluation assets to development assets. The value of development assets and other tangible 
plant and machinery has increased US$ 105.19 mn, including the amount of US$ 76.14 mn 
transferred from exploration and evaluation assets as mentioned above, during the period. 
The development assets amortised on the gas produced during the year was US$ 1.51 mn. 
The current assets (excluding cash) as of 31 March 2013 stood at US$ 16.17 mn, which includes 
US$ 5.97 mn of inventory and US$ 9.93 mn of trade receivables. The trade receivables are 
mainly on account of receivables of the fourth quarter ToP amount of US$ 6.15 mn and the 
‘Annual ToP’ amount of US$ 2.80 mn billed on the last day of the year. The current liabilities 
of the Company, excluding the related party liability of US$ 55.85 mn and current portion of 
long term debt of US$ 16.96 mn, stood at US$ 5.14 mn. This comprised mainly of deferred 
revenue of US$ 5.08 mn and accrued expenses and liabilities of US$ 0.06 mn.
As of 31 March, the outstanding term loan of the Company was US$ 119.18 mn, out of which 
US$ 16.96 mn was categorised as repayable within a year and the remaining US$ 102.22 mn 
has been categorised as long term liability. The Company utilised a term loan of US$ 40 mn 
during the year and its repayment has commenced from June 2012. During the year, the 
Company has repaid an amount of US$ 17.32 mn of the outstanding term loan facilities, as 
per the scheduled repayment plan. 
In view of the delay in the implementation of Phase II, the funding requirements of the Company 
were met primarily through continued financial support from Gynia Holdings Ltd. (“Gynia”) (a 
significant shareholder and a related party). Accordingly, the amount payable to Gynia has  10
increased by US$ 63.51 mn from US$ 42.54 mn from 31 March 2012 to US$ 106.05 mn as 
of 31 March 2013.The Gynia loan is unsecured and carries an interest calculated @6.5% per 
annum which is accrued and will be paid only at final maturity of the loan amount. Out of this 
payable, an amount of US$ 52.6 mn is subordinated to the bank term loan and is repayable 
(both interest and principal) only after the entire term loan availed from the bank lenders have 
been paid off. Balance of Gynia loan is payable in the year ending 31 March 2019. 
In addition to the Gynia Loan, the Company has a short term facility payable of US$ 55.85 mn 
(FY 2011-12: US$59.40 mn) due to Focus Energy Ltd. (“Focus”), a related party. Focus is the 
Operator of the block and Indus is obliged to bear its proportion of the costs and expenses 
borne by the Operator in respect of the block. An interest amount of 6.5% is payable on 
the outstanding amount due to Focus, in accordance with the operating and assignment 
agreement for the block. Both the Gynia loan and Focus payables are contracted on usual 
commercial terms and on an arm’s length basis.
Indus expects to meet its capital investment requirements during FY 2013-14, primarily 
from loans and revenues from gas sales. The Company also expects to be able to contract 
additional debt financing from banks/institutions for the expenditure proposed to be incurred 
for FY 2013-14 and onwards. With the start of the second phase of production, the Company 
has sufficient cash flows to be able to support additional debt.
o utlook
During the next twelve months, we look forward to continuing the extensive appraisal drilling 
and testing campaign to be able to establish the maximum potential development area and 
additional reserves. This will be critical from the perspective of retaining as much prospective 
area of the block as possible after the appraisal period end in late 2013. We also look 
forward to progressing and concluding discussions with GAIL for the supply of additional 
quantities of gas to the RRVUNL owned power plant expansion.

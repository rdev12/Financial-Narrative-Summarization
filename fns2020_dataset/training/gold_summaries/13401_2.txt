 Business Highlights
• A continuing strategic focus on executing licences in the high value consumer specialties
business area including household products, coatings and adhesives and personal care
• Following the IPO, funds available at 31 December 2012 of £21.9 million providing a signiﬁcant
funded “runway” to enable management to deliver on key commercial projects;
• Products update:
o Consumer specialties: development programmes being progressed in partnership with a
number of international FMCG companies through joint development and other
collaborative structures that allow Revolymer to retain the underlying polymer intellectual
property as the subject of subsequent licences to such partners;
o The development of a nicotine gum offering with the potential to generate signiﬁcant
medium term shareholder value in targeted markets;
o Bioequivalence study for nicotine gum product completed. Abbreviated New Drug
Application (“ANDA”) for submission to the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in
closing stages of drafting;
o Licensing potential remaining in the confectionery gum business, despite the decision to
stop direct sales in the US;
• A portfolio of product programmes for potential licensing, which also helps to mitigate the
challenges inherent in striking commercialisation deals and reduces the dependence of the
business on success in a single product development programme (i.e. “multiple shots on goal”);
• Guidance from a strong and experienced Board of Directors chaired by Jack Keenan,
formerly CEO and Chairman of Kraft Foods International, and supported by independent
Non-executive Directors with speciﬁc industry expertise, namely Julian Heslop, formerly CFO of
GlaxoSmithKline, and Dr Bryan Dobson, formerly President Global Operations of Croda
International.
Financial Highlights
• £21.9 million of current cash investments, cash and cash equivalents on hand at the year end
(2011: £3.1 million);
• Net cash outﬂow from operating activities of £4.3 million (2011: £3.9 million);
• Revenue for the period of £176k (2011: £150k), comprising sales of Rev7
®
removable and
degradable confectionery gum in the US and nicotine gum in Canada;
• Gross loss for the period of £606k (2011: gross proﬁt £84k), but a gross proﬁt of £90k (2011: £84k)
before charging US closure costs, stock provisions and write offs amounting to £696k;
• Other operating income for the period of £340k (2011: £505k), from potential licensing partners
in the consumer specialties business areas. Reduction in income reﬂects the advanced status
of a number of our programmes, and our focus on securing licence deals to deliver high
quality medium term value, rather than seeking signiﬁcant short term collaborative income;
• Reported loss for the year of £10.1 million (2011: £3.9 million), which was adversely impacted by
signiﬁcant and primarily non-cash charges in respect of stock provisions, US closure costs and
share based payments (as a result of all share options vesting at Admission) amounting in total
to £5.2 million (2011 £261k). The loss excluding these items was £4.9 million (2011: £3.7 million).

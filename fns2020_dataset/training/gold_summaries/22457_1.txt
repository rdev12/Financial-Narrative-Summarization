 ClearDebt Group plc 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT

The Group has enjoyed a good year in terms of profitability and cash flow although this has to be tempered by 
lower numbers of new IVA cases particularly in the second half of the financial year. During the year 1,459 
(2011: 1,601) new IVAs were passed. In addition some 120 new IVAs were acquired in the first quarter of the 
financial year and as at 30 June 2012 the total number of IVAs and PTDs generating income was 6,504 (2011: 
5,893). 
 
The number of new IVAs is disappointing but I feel that this position is being mirrored by many in the sector as 
the IVA market as a whole remains flat at best. In addition, clients’ average disposable incomes after basic 
living expenses continue to fall as household food and energy costs remain high which has the effect of reducing 
fees for new IVAs as they are geared towards the level of contributions paid by clients. 
 
I am pleased however to report that Abacus has returned to growth in DMP client numbers, excluding acquired 
back books, and as at 30 June 2012, the total number of active DMPs under management was 6,566 (2011: 
5,761).  
 
We have been successful in generating substantial income from consultancy services related to the IVA business 
to offset the lower IVA numbers. Income from this source has increased substantially in the current year with 
revenue generated of £1,307,992 (2011: £361,341). Whilst I expect revenue from this source to continue into the 
new financial year it will continue at lower levels as certain elements of a non-recurring nature drop out.  
 
We continue to invest in the training of our staff with many having obtained the Certificate of Debt Resolution 
(CertDR), exclusively offered by the Debt Resolution Forum (“DRF”), and many more are progressing towards 
the qualification. I am proud of the culture within our organisation for training and the focus on the highest 
ethical standards which will keep us well ahead of industry standards and compliance in the United Kingdom.  I 
am also pleased with our commitment in supporting the DRF in all of its activities especially ensuring 
representation on many government and industry wide committees in our sector.  
 
We have continued to reduce our dependency on internet advertising and increasingly are focused upon referral 
sources for client leads together with the acquisition of good quality data for our now well established call 
centre. We constantly try to diversify and expand our referral base in an effort to boost the numbers of new 
clients to the business.  
 
Cash flow remains good and we are now focused on accumulating cash to repay the convertible bond in April 
2013 with cash balances currently now in excess of £1m and increasing.

The numbers of new IVAs in the second half of the financial year have been disappointing and this has 
continued since the year end. New IVAs passed in the year declined by 9% to 1,459 from 1,601 new cases in 
2010/11.  We acquired the income stream from some 120 IVAs in the year and including this purchase, we had 
as at 30 June 2012 a total of 6,504 (2011: 5,893) IVAs and PTDs generating income.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT

Revenue of £1,307,992 (2011: £361,341) from consultancy income related to the IVA business has increased 
substantially in the year to offset the lower numbers of new IVAs. This year has benefitted from items which are 
one off in nature and whilst we continue to expect significant revenue from this source we expect income to be 
lower in the new financial year as it returns to more normal levels. 
 
The Board monitors several key performance indicators  (“KPIs”) for the business on a monthly basis including 
the number of cases passed, various conversion ratios from lead to cases passed, the cost per case acquired and 
the staff to caseload numbers. Whilst reduced numbers of leads and referrals has led to lower numbers of cases 
passed, all other indicators remain within expectations. 
 
Abacus– Debt Management Division  
 
The division made a pleasing profit in the period with DMP client numbers, excluding acquired back books, 
starting to increase again month on month since January 2012.  
 
As at 30 June 2012, the total number of DMPs generating income was 6,566 (2011: 5,761). Our attrition rates on 
DMPs are well within our normal expectations and we continue to look to acquire back books as a means of 
boosting income over the short and medium term. 
 
The Board has KPIs to monitor the number of active income generating plans as well as the value of monthly 
payments made by debtors.  The costs of acquisition of cases and plans are also monitored closely. We continue 
to resist the temptation to grow the book through lead sources providing leads at what are, in our view, 
uneconomic prices. 
 
ClearCash – prepaid MasterCard 
  
Steady progress continues to be made with our Pre-Paid MasterCard, ClearCash, although it has yet to reach a 
break even position. Increased losses in the current year as compared to 2011 have arisen due to the decision in 
December 2011 to switch service providers to enhance the card functionality. This has led to duplicated costs 
whilst we wind down the old card and switch clients to the new ClearCash card which was successfully 
migrated in July 2012 - but we believe the switch will be a worthwhile one for future card sales.  
 
The new ClearCash card has increased functionality, in particular giving card holders their own unique sort code 
and account number. This not only gives cardholders the feel of a traditional bank account but also allows them 
to set up direct debits for the first time giving them the full functionality they require. Following the successful 
migration of current card holders we will start actively marketing the new card to our extensive database. 
  
As card numbers increase we expect the card to produce a profit next year. 
 
 
FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Group turnover increased by 18% to £9,203,453 (2011: £7,776,362) and gross profit by 18% to £4,678,074 
(2011: £3,963,959). The performance was driven by the consultancy income related to the IVA business as well 
as revenue generated from our substantial IVA and DMP back books. Amortisation charges in respect of 
acquisitions and impairment amounted to £1,199,481 (2011: £1,388,809). 
 
Finance costs rose to £585,611 (2011: £532,404 ) reflecting the continued accrual of interest due in respect of 
the three year 10% secured convertible loan notes which are due for repayment in April 2013. Actual interest 
paid in respect of the convertible loan notes totalled £230,000 with the balance being an accounting charge for 
the redemption premium due on maturity in 2013. 
 
Cash resources at the year-end amounted to £462,459 (2011: £336,636) after back-book acquisitions of some 
£259,880 (2011: £1,088,783) and repayment of loans of £700,000 (2011: net loans advanced £315,000). 
Operational cash flow remains strong and cash balances at the end of September 2012 were in excess of £1m as 
we continue to build cash for repayment of the convertible loan notes.

GOING CONCERN 
  
As part of its going concern review the Board has followed the guidelines published by the Financial Reporting 
Council entitled “Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for UK Companies 2009”.  The Board has 
prepared detailed financial forecasts and cash flows for the three years to 30 June 2015 and in drawing up these 
forecasts the Board has made assumptions based upon its view of the current and future economic conditions in 
the UK that will prevail over the forecast period - given that the business is likely to be solely focused on the 
UK market for the foreseeable future. The timing of the cash flows in respect of loans provided has been taken 
into consideration and in addition to the forecasts we have produced sensitivities to these forecasts to test our 
ability to trade as a going concern for at least the following 12 months. In addition, I have provided the Board 
with an undertaking of support in the event that the Group should require additional finance. 
 
The Board believes that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate based upon a review of 
these forecasts and the finance available to the Group. 
 
FUTURE OUTLOOK 
 
The IVA market has plateaued and the numbers of new cases are not rising as expected due to declining 
disposable incomes of consumers and some resistance by certain creditors to the solution.  We are working on 
initiatives to increase our penetration whilst also considering new models to offer IVAs at much reduced levels 
of contribution to enable consumers to enter this solution. 
 
We continue to look for acquisitions of client books wherever we can at reasonable prices to supplement our 
growth as we know these can be highly profitable given the ease with which we can assimilate them into our 
scalable business model and systems.  
 
Given the current economic outlook in the UK with unemployment showing no signs of falling together with 
high taxation and continued public sector cuts I believe the Group is still well placed for another profitable year.  
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our staff for their dedication and hard work over the last year 
and for their continuing advice and assistance to our thousands of clients.

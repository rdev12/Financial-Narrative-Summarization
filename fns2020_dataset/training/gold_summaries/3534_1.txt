Performance Overview
In the 53 week financial year box office revenue 
increased 16.9% to £230.9m (2008: £197.5m) 
or 14.7% on a 52 week basis, representing a 
box office market share of 23.9% (2008: 23.3%). 
The Group’s admissions increased by an 
impressive 4.0m on the prior year (8.9% on 
a reported basis or 6.9% on a 52 week basis). 
Average ticket price per admission increased 
by 7.5% to £4.71 (2008: £4.38) largely reflecting 
an improved mix and the higher ticket prices 
charged on 3D films. Retail spend per person 
held firm at £1.72 (2008: £1.71). 
Cineworld’s success in 2009 was underpinned 
by the excellent film slate as well as the 
successful introduction of 3D films. Overall 
prices were higher, reflected by the higher box 
office revenues, due to modest general price 
increases and also the benefit of the price uplift 
from 3D admissions. Approximately 12% of 
market box office was from 3D for the full year, up 
from approximately 10% in the first half of 2009.
box Office
A combination of strong price and admissions 
growth in the year enabled Cineworld’s box office 
to increase 16.9% to £230.9m (2008: £197.5m) 
and achieve a box office market share of 23.9% 
(2008: 23.3%). On a 52 week pro rated basis 
for 2009, box office increased by 14.7%. By this 
measure, Cineworld is the number two cinema 
operator in the UK and Ireland, according to EDI 
Neilsen (“EDI” an organisation which collects, 
reports and analyses information on the UK 
and Irish cinema industry). Admissions of 49.1m 
Cineworld’s success in 2009 was 
underpinned by the excellent film 
slate as well as the successful 
introduction of 3D films. 09
Cineworld Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
gave Cineworld a UK market share in admissions 
of 26.8% (up from 26.5% in 2008), making us 
the leading operator in the UK and Irish market 
on this basis (source: EDI). Average ticket price 
per admission increased 7.5% to £4.71 (2008: 
£4.38). The increase was partly aided by the 
premium pricing on 3D performances and by a 
larger adult audience mix during the year. The 
average ticket price excluding VAT of 3D was 
almost £5.90 compared to 2D of almost £4.54. 
Cineworld nevertheless continues to offer its 
customers compelling value with the lowest 
average ticket price of any of the major UK 
cinema groups. 
 
There were strong performances in the year 
from a number of core blockbusters which 
included “Harry Potter and the Half Blood 
Prince”, “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen”, 
“The Hangover”, “Twilight Saga: New Moon” and 
“Star Trek”. All these films performed in line with 
industry expectations. The 2009 film highlight of 
the year was “Slumdog Millionaire”, a relatively 
unknown film released in the UK at the beginning 
of the year, quickly catching the attention of the 
film industry and cinema-going public and 
receiving much critical acclaim. It exceeded 
expectations by grossing over £30m in national 
box office and collected eight Oscar awards. 
 
The year also saw 13 major films released in 
3D, the most notable being “Avatar”, the highest 
grossing film of all time with strong support from 
“Bolt”, “Monsters Versus Aliens”, “Ice Age 3: 
Dawn of the Dinosaurs”, “UP” and “A Christmas 
Carol”. Overall Cineworld achieved a market 
share of 35% in 3D films. The success of 
these films has helped to raise the profile of this 
format, which in turn has supported cinema 
admissions and increased box office revenues. 
It is particularly pleasing to see the establishment 
of the 3D format in mainstream cinema 
entertainment and, given our strong position in 
the provision of digital facilities, enables us to 
give further choice to our customers. 
In line with our strategy, we have continued to 
offer customers the broadest range of films on 
the market. There were a number of small and 
mid range films which performed well during the 
year including “District 9”, “Paranormal Activity” 
and “The Time Traveller’s Wife” where we 
achieved higher individual market shares than 
our competitors. Whilst we remain the biggest 
exhibitor of Bollywood films in the UK with a 62% 
share of the UK market, the supply of product 
during the first half of 2009 was disrupted due 
to the Bollywood strike which resulted in our box 
office for Bollywood product falling 8% against 
2008. We remain the only major chain to screen 
Tamil language films. In addition, we showcased 
a series of other successful foreign language 
films such as “Coco before Chanel” and “Let the 
Right One In” which contributed favourably to our 
full year results. 
We made steady progress during the year in 
developing our alternative content offering and 
played a series of operas transmitted live via 
satellite from the New York Metropolitan Opera, 
opera and ballet from The Royal Opera House 
and theatre productions from the National 
Theatre. Since the year end, we have also 
successfully screened international rugby in 3D, 
further widening the choice which we are able to 
offer our customers. 
Retail
Despite the tough consumer environment, 
retail spend per person has held firm in 2009 
at £1.72 (2008: £1.71). This is a reflection of 
the competitive offers and strength of our 
promotions. As expected, our customers have 
become more value conscious given the tough 
economic backdrop, and we have responded 
with a number of value initiatives which have 
been successful.
During 2009, we refreshed and replaced a 
number of ice cream and general retail areas, 
adding 13 new Ben & Jerry’s scoop shops and 
refurbished a number of other retail stands. We 
are also pleased to report that we have renewed 
long-term arrangements with Coca Cola and 
Candyking, continuing our partnership with these 
recognised brands, which will help to maintain 
the value of our overall offer.
We also began targeting retail promotions at 
specific customer groups who typically spend 
less on retail products. Amongst the more 
successful initiatives were the high value “Buy 
One Get One Free” Coke promotion for Orange 
Wednesday customers and the high value 
Combo packages for our Unlimited customers. 
The results from these and other initiatives 
will be used to develop our offers further 
during 2010.
As reported at the last set of results, we 
have seen increased costs on key commodities, 
but the business has a number of long-term 
fixed price agreements in place which have 
afforded us a degree of protection. We have 
also continued to develop new social and 
environmental initiatives and have reduced the 
paper used in the production of our popcorn 
bags, as well as sourcing healthier cooking oil.
We played a series 
of operas transmitted 
live via satellite from 
the New York 
Metropolitan Opera, 
opera and ballet 
from The Royal Opera 
House and theatre 
productions from the 
National Theatre.

Advertising
Digital Cinema Media Limited (“DCM”), our joint 
venture screen advertising business formed in 
July 2008, had a challenging year in line with the 
rest of the advertising industry. Screen 
advertising revenues fell 38.8% against the 
previous year which had benefitted from two 
months’ worth of revenue from the old Carlton 
Screen Advertising minimum guarantee, 
representing an additional £1.0m of revenue.
DCM’s primary function is to sell advertising 
time on cinema screens on behalf of Cineworld 
and its other clients. It also engages in related 
promotional work between advertisers and 
cinemas. The fall in revenues generated for 
Cineworld against the previous year largely 
reflected the state of the wider advertising 
industry, with reduced levels of demand.
A new management team at DCM, formed during 
the end of 2008 and early 2009, has been 
driving operational efficiencies and effectiveness 
so that the business is well positioned to 
capitalise on the increased flexibility offered to 
advertisers via the digital format, as well as any 
improvements to the overall advertising market. 
Cineworld believes that DCM remains an exciting 
prospect for us to drive future growth in revenue 
and profitability.
Investment in Digital
At the end of December 2009, Cineworld had 
one of the largest digital estates of any cinema 
operator in the UK. Digital projection is an 
important part of our strategy, which enables the 
screening of films (2D and 3D) and other content 
using digital media. During the first quarter of 
2009, the Group installed a further 74 digital 
projectors, thereby consolidating its leading 
position in digital. A number of existing digital 
projectors were also redeployed to larger 
auditoria, to satisfy customer demand while also 
maximising the financial benefits from screening 
3D films. Cineworld is currently installing a 
further 102 digital screens bringing the total 
number of digital screens in the estate to 265.
The film industry thrives on technological 
advances and the swift adoption of 3D, with 
thirteen 3D films shown in 2009 and at least 18 
scheduled for 2010, means the industry appears 
set to enjoy further growth from 3D and digital 
content in 2010 and beyond, with Cineworld well 
placed to capitalise on this trend.
u nlimited Card Programme
Our unique subscription service, Unlimited, 
offers a competitive value proposition to our 
customers. The service offers customers the 
opportunity to pay a fixed monthly (or annual) 
subscription which enables them to watch 
standard films at our cinemas as many times 
as they wish. Cineworld prides itself on being 
the only cinema operator in the UK and Ireland 
to offer this service which currently has 
approximately 240,000 subscribers. The service 
is one of the pillars which underpin our strategy 
of growing other revenues and admissions. 
It brings to the Group the financial benefits of 
regular subscription income and reduces the 
level of fluctuations in our revenues. It also 
brings operational benefits by encouraging 
repeat visits, often at off peak times. This, in 
turn, enables us to improve capacity utilisation 
at our cinemas, provide more retail opportunities 
and introduce a wider range of films than our 
competitors. As a result, we have delivered 
significant growth in market share amongst the 
smaller, less mainstream films in 2009.
Initiatives and Developments
The investment made in our consumer website 
in late 2008 has generated on-line sales up 13% 
on the previous year and recorded over 48m 
visits in 2009. We also launched a mobile 
enabled web booking service in the year to 
capitalise on increased use of handheld devices 
by our customers and their preference to book 
via the web rather than by telephone.
Progress continued to be made in growing the 
“My Cineworld” membership on our consumer 
website which stood at 200,000 at the end of 
the year, a 100% increase over the year. This 
is an important tool for us in engaging with our 
customers and in understanding how we can 
improve our offer to them, thereby improving 
customer retention and increasing visits to our 
cinemas. Our partnership with Tesco continues 
to flourish and over 200,000 admissions in 
2009 were achieved through their Clubcard 
programme. Tesco has also invested in TV 
advertising to promote the ticket offer, raising 
Cineworld’s brand profile. Our new gift card 
proposition was rolled out in the year and is 
being sold at many well known retail outlets. It 
replaces our existing paper based gift vouchers 
and will improve operational efficiencies on 
redemption at the tills as well as facilitate 
payment for our customers. Since the year end, 
we have expanded our marketing team to 
increase focus on digital related opportunities 
in screenings of alternative content and 
opportunities in the Business 2 Business sector.
Our People
Attracting, developing and retaining talented 
staff is important for our business. It is vital for 
our continued success that we encourage our 
employees’ personal development and career 
progression. A new performance management 
framework was implemented during the year. 
It involved all senior and line managers with 
the aim of providing meaningful employees’ 
objective setting and structured performance 
reviews. By using this framework, we aim to 
increase further the high proportion of 
management and supervisory positions which 
are held by internally promoted employees, 
thereby bringing operational and financial 
benefits to the Group. As part of the drive to 
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of staff 
recruitment, a new recruitment website was 
launched in the year. It provides cinema 
managers with a tool to select candidates 
efficiently and then to process the selections 
quickly and effectively. 11

New Openings
In line with our strategy for growing our estate, 
we successfully opened a 10-screen cinema in 
Aberdeen and a five screen cinema in Witney in 
October 2009, both with full digital projection 
facilities. Looking further ahead to 2010 and 
beyond, our cinema opening programme is likely 
to be impacted by the availability of finance for 
developers and therefore uncertainty over the 
timing of projects. Nevertheless, our national 
expansion remains a key strategic priority for the 
Group over the medium term as we seek to 
deliver growth for our shareholders and we 
continue to pursue such opportunities.
Key t rends and Factors Potentially Affecting 
the Future
The future success of the Group in 2010 will 
remain principally dependent on the strength 
of the film releases during the year. Sequels 
and franchises will continue to contribute 
a significant number of the higher profile 
blockbuster films. Many such films outperform 
the original film or concept, so the film studios 
will continue to look to capitalise on proven 
successful formulae. The overall film release 
programme for 2010 is known and there is a 
strong line up of potential blockbuster films 
which include a range of sequels and new films.
The enormous success of “Avatar” has further 
elevated the profile of 3D films and has given 
the 3D format and digital technology greater 
impetus. More films are planned for release in 
3D together with conversion of older films to 3D. 
To date, most 3D films have tended to be of the 
animated, computer generated imagery variety, 
though as 3D technology and film making and 
production improve, we expect to see more 
live films in 3D. In addition, we have already 
successfully started to screen certain high-
profile rugby events in 3D in the early part of 
2010 and would anticipate further opportunities 
to show similar alternative content.
The major product for the cinema industry will 
remain 2D films, though 3D and other content 
will continue to gain in popularity as more 
content is provided digitally. Our plans for digital 
mirror these trends and we will continue to 
convert our existing estate to digital.
As previously reported, we enjoyed more 
mid week business in 2009, particularly in 
conjunction with our “Bargain Tuesdays” 
promotion and “Orange Wednesdays”. The two 
days combined now contribute over 27% of 
weekly admissions for the year, up from a little 
over 25.5% for 2008 and demonstrates that 
customers have been seeking greater value in 
the current economic climate.
An improving economy will be good all round 
for the business and aid the recovery of the 
advertising market and of our screen advertising 
revenues in particular. However, plans for new 
cinemas will remain less certain until finance for 
developers becomes more available. We will 
continue to identify and sign agreements with 
developers for new cinemas in anticipation of 
when the fiscal situation eases.
Cineworld will continue to offer a highly 
compelling choice within the wider range of 
entertainment and leisure activities. Going to the 
cinema will remain one of the best value forms 
of popular entertainment and will continue to 
attract audiences because of the film product 
and the immersive viewing experience that 
cannot be matched by any other media.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Revenues
Total revenue for 2009 was £333.4m, a rise 
of 11.5% on the prior period (2008: £298.9m) 
or a 9.4% rise on a pro rated 52 week basis.
As a result of strong film product and 
maintenance of our market share, we have 
enjoyed very buoyant trade during the year 
and box office was 16.9% higher at £230.9m 
(2008: £197.5m). On a pro rated 52 week basis 
for 2009, box office was 14.7% higher than 
2008 on 6.9% more admissions. 
Retail sales for the year were up 9.6% at 
£84.4m (2008: £77.0m) or 7.5% higher on a pro 
rated 52 week basis. The percentage increase is 
less than that of box office and is reflective of 
the challenging consumer environment. 
Other revenues were down 25.8% to £18.1m 
(2008: £24.4m). Excluding the additional week in 
2009, the adverse variance increases to 27.0%. 
Income from non-screen advertising such as 
ticket bookings, theatre hires, sponsorships and 
games were up 20.0% against the previous year, 
but their performance was overshadowed by a 
38.8% fall during the year in screen advertising 
revenue. The previous year also benefitted from 
two months’ worth of revenue from the old 
Carlton Screen Advertising minimum guarantee, 
being an additional £1.0m of revenue.
EbIt DA* and Operating Profit
EBITDA was up 5.1% at £55.7m against the 
2008 figure of £53.0m and was achieved 
through better spend levels and cost margins 
and continued management of operating costs. 
These were partly offset by rising energy costs 
during the year and the shortfall in screen 
advertising revenue. The EBITDA margin was 
adversely impacted by the change in the sales 
mix from reduced screen advertising revenue, 
nearly all of which feeds directly into EBITDA. 
Operating profit increased to £39.6m (2008: 
£38.1m). The estimated contribution to 
EBITDA from the additional week in 2009 was 
approximately £1.1m and approximately 
£0.6m to operating profit. 
Earnings
Overall profit on ordinary activities before tax 
was £30.8m compared with £27.6m in 2008. 
Basic earnings per share amounted to 14.4p 
and adjusted pro forma earnings per share were 
16.2p (using a normalised tax rate of 28.0%). 
This compares favourably with the 2008 
adjusted pro forma earnings per share of 14.6p. 
The weighted average number of shares during 
2009 was 141.7m and no shares were issued 
during the period.
Finance Costs
The falls in interest rates during the later part of 
2008 benefited the Group during 2009 and the 
early part of 2010. The interest expense in the 
year relates primarily to interest on bank debt. 
The majority of the remaining interest charge  
is non-cash interest on onerous leases and the 
pension scheme.
taxation
The overall tax charge was £10.4m giving an 
overall effective tax rate of 33.8% for the year 
(2008: 26.8%). The corporation tax charge 
consisted of the charge in respect of the current 
year of £7.1m and a charge of £1.7m relating 
to prior years. The balance of the tax charge 
of £1.6m resulted from the utilisation of a 
deferred tax asset principally relating to capital 
allowances (the difference between the tax 
written down value of the capital allowance and 
the net book value of the underlying assets).
Cash Flow and balance Sheet
The Group continued to be strongly cash 
generative at the operating level during the year. 
Total cash generated from operations increased 
to £54.6m (2008: £48.4m). This reflects the 
healthy conversion rate of our profits into cash 
flow that is the nature of our business. There 
was a working capital cash inflow for the year 
arising from an increase in the level of creditors 
at the end of December, which reflects the 
higher level of trade during the Christmas period. 
The high level of internally generated cash has 
funded our entire capital expenditure whilst 
repaying debt of £9.0m and paying dividends 
of £13.5m. Furthermore, the Group enjoys 
the security of a revolving credit facility of up 
to £30.0m (undrawn at the end of the year), as 
part of the overall bank facility which further 
enhances the Group’s overall liquidity.
Net cash spent on capital for the year of £15.6m 
consisted of gross expenditure of £18.3m 
against which contributions of £2.7m were 
received from the landlords. Of the gross 
amount, £4.4m related to new digital projectors 
and £6.5m represented equipment replacement, 
site refurbishments and expenditure on various 
initiatives such as website enhancements and 
upgrading of automated ticket sales points. The 
balance of capital expenditure of £7.4m related 
to the cost of opening the new 10 screen cinema 
at Aberdeen and the new five screen cinema 
at Witney. The contributions received from 
the landlords have been treated as reverse 
premiums and will be amortised to the profit  
and loss account over the terms of the 
respective leases.
As a result of strong 
film product and 
maintenance of our 
market share, we have 
enjoyed very buoyant 
trade during the year. 14

Cineworld Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Net debt at the end of December 2009 fell 
to £104.3m (2008: £117.4m), due to the 
repayment of £9.0m of the bank loan and the 
maintenance of a healthy cash balance. Net 
debt included a £3.9m liability valuation of 
the interest rate swap hedge on the bank loan 
(2008: £4.2m liability). The liability position 
arose because the fixed rate of interest payable 
on the swap was higher than the three month 
LIBOR rate receivable on the hedged portion 
of the loan for the remainder of its term. 
Like the previous year, the Group remained well 
within its banking covenants and continued to 
achieve the financial targets which enabled it to 
benefit from a low margin on its bank debt of 
0.95% above three month LIBOR. By reducing 
net debt and improving EBITDA during the year 
ahead, the Group will increase scope to reduce 
the margin on its bank debt further to 0.7% 
above three month LIBOR. 
Dividends
The Board continues to apply a dividend policy 
reflecting the long-term earnings and cash flow 
potential of Cineworld. In line with the above 
policy, the Directors are recommending to 
shareholders for approval a final dividend in 
respect of the year ended 31 December 2009 
of 6.8p per share, which taken together with 
the interim dividend of 3.2p per share paid in 
October 2009, gives a total dividend in respect 
of 2009 of 10.0p per share, a 0.5p increase 
from the level in 2008. Subject to shareholder 
approval, the final dividend will be paid on 
7 July 2010 to shareholders on the register 
on 11 June 2010. Going forward, subject 
to business performance and the Group’s 
investment requirements, in accordance with our 
desire to provide shareholders with an attractive 
level of cash distribution, the Board expects to 
increase the dividend taking account growth in 
adjusted pro forma earnings per share and our 
existing target payout ratio of 60% of underlying 
net income.
Current t rading and Looking Ahead
2010 has started well in view of the adverse 
weather conditions across the UK in January. 
We have enjoyed some carry over of business 
from the Christmas blockbuster films, in 
particular “Avatar” which has exceeded 
industry expectations to become the biggest 
film of all time (in world box office terms), 
overtaking Titanic.
However, we are not complacent and will 
continue to work hard to improve our competitive 
position across the United Kingdom. We remain 
committed to offering our customers the 
broadest range of films in the most modern 
and comfortable of cinema multiplexes. We 
constantly seek to update and invest in our 
customer offer with a clear focus on achieving 
operational and financial targets. 
Given the sound financial standing of the Group, 
we feel well positioned to take advantage of 
business opportunities which may arise in the 
future. With an exciting film release schedule in 
2010, we are confident of the prospects for the 
business in the forthcoming year.

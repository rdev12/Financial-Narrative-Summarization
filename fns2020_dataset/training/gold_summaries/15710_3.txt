During 2006 the Group achieved
record sales and profits
Introduction
I am pleased to be able to announce
excellent results for Tikit Group plc for
the year ended 31 December 2006. The
Group undertook a number of
acquisitions during late 2004 and 2005
and the focus for 2006 was to secure
good organic growth from the enlarged
Group and at the same time improve
operating margins across all of the
business areas.
We achieved overall revenue growth of
17% in 2006 compared with 2005 and
operating margins improved from 10.4%
to 12.3%. Profit before taxation, goodwill
amortisation and share option charges
increased by 38% to £2.9 million
compared with 2005 (£2.1 million).
Good progress has been made
throughout the business including major
project wins with our existing large legal
clients and significant success from our
recent move into the accountancy sector .
Our operations in France and Spain
performed ahead of plan.
Results
Turnover for the period increased by
17% to £23.5 million (2005: £20.2
million). Within this, consultancy and
managed services businesses increased
by 13% to £15.3 million (2005: £13.5
million) of which £8.0 million (2005:
£7 .2 million) related to managed
services turnover , representing
recurring revenues of 34% of our 2006
turnover . The improvement of operating
margins from 10.4% to 12.3% reflects
higher utilisation rates of our
chargeable staff and efficiencies gained
through the integration of managed
services operations and reducing some
lower margin business in non-strategic
areas such as hardware sales.
The Group improved profits by 38%,
achieving a profit before taxation,
goodwill amortisation and share option
charges for the period of £2.9 million
(2005: £2.1 million).
The figure for pre-tax profit after share
option charges and goodwill
amortisation increased by 233% to £2.1
million (2005: £0.6 million). Following a
review by the Board of the Group’s
goodwill amortisation accounting policy,
the goodwill charge for 2006 was made
on the basis of a ten-year amortisation
period (2005: five years). As a result
goodwill amortisation in the year was
£0.64 million (2005: £1.34 million).
Share option charges during the period,
as required by FRS 20, were £127 ,000
(2005: £126,000).
Earnings per share before goodwill
amortisation and share option charges
increased by 38% to 18.0 pence (2005:
13.0 pence). Basic earnings per share
were 12.0 pence (2005: 1.7 pence).
Chairman’s Statement

Cash generated from operations was
£3.6 million (2005: £2.1 million). Our
balance sheet remains strong, with net
assets at 31 December 2006 at £6.2
million (2005: £5.2 million), including
cash balances of £4.2 million (2005:
£2.3 million).
During the year , we took the opportunity
to use £392,000 of our cash resources
to purchase 203,535 Tikit shares in the
market for cancellation, as we believed
this to be immediately earnings
enhancing.
In order to facilitate a proposed new
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), for key
personnel, the implementation of which
is subject to shareholder approval,
100,000 Tikit shares were purchased in
the market during 2006 at a cost of
£234,000 and these, together with a
further 100,000 purchased in January
2007 at a cost of £258,500, are
available to satisfy the award of shares
under the proposed LTIP.
Dividends
Given the ongoing strength of the
business and our excellent record of
cash generation from operations, the
Board has decided upon a more
progressive dividend policy. A final
dividend of 2.75 pence per share is
proposed. It is to be paid on 7 May 2007
to shareholders on the register on
30 March 2007 . This, when taken with
the interim dividend of 1.25 pence
(2005: 0.75 pence), brings total
dividends for the year to 4.0 pence
(2005: 2.5 pence), an increase of 60%
over the previous year .
Employees
I would like to take the opportunity to
thank the directors and employees of
the Group for their contribution in
delivering this excellent set of results.
Executive Long Term Incentive Plan
(LTIP)
Since its public listing in June 2001, Tikit
has been very successful in generating
not only profits, but also, more
importantly, cash from its operations.
This generation of cash has enabled us to
make acquisitions and fund our growth
without recourse to the capital markets.
Although an issue of new Tikit shares has
sometimes been used partially to fund
acquisitions, the rate of growth of the
issued share capital has been
significantly less than the rate of growth
of the company. As a result, the ability of
the company to grant share options
within the ABI guidelines (which restrict
the issue of options over a ten year
period to a maximum of 10% of the
issued share capital) is severely limited.
The proposed Long Term Incentive Plan
(LTIP) is performance related and
provides incentives to key executives and
staff to remain with the business and
share in the increase in shareholder
value over the next three years.
The proposed LTIP requires shareholder
approval at the company’s Annual
General Meeting to be held on 3 May
2007 . In the notice convening the
Group’s Annual General Meeting the
necessary resolution is set out together
with explanatory details of the proposed
scheme. It is proposed that share
options over 250,000 Tikit Group plc
shares are granted to the senior
management team with a nominal grant
price. There are currently 200,000

to large law firms.
shares held in treasury. An additional
50,000 shares will, if required, be
purchased in the market and held in
treasury. These options may vest at the
end of a three-year period and will be
subject to an earnings per share growth
target over three years. For the
maximum number of shares to vest
under this scheme, a compound growth
rate of 20% per annum in normalised
earnings per share has to be achieved.
For this purpose, normalised means the
fully diluted earnings per share of the
company taxed at the standard
corporation tax rate of the company and
before goodwill amortisation and share
option charges.
Most of the cost to the company will be
fixed at the outset as 80% of the
maximum number of shares to vest
under this scheme have already been
purchased and held in treasury. No
dilution of the existing issued share
capital through the issue of new shares
will occur .
As at 31 December 2006, there were
unexercised options granted over
638,778 shares under existing Group
share options schemes, representing
approximately 5.0 % of the existing
issued share capital of the company. If
the proposed LTIP is approved and
implemented, share options over an
additional 250,000 shares representing
approximately 1.9% of the company’s
existing issued share capital will be
granted.
Business review and prospects
The purpose of this section is to give
shareholders a summary of the
prospects of the business. The
performance in 2006 is a good indicator
of the skills that currently exist within
the Group and the financial results show
how effectively those skills are
employed.
The overriding Group objective is to
continue to focus on the provision of IT
systems and support to large law firms
and accountancy practices. Tikit has
established itself as a leading supplier to
this market in the UK and remains
focused on expanding its market share.
In addition, we seek to become the

13534TIKITGRO:13534TIKITGRO  12/4/07  08:41  Page 8 13534 30/03/2007 Proof 7
leading supplier of these services and
products to the large firms in mainland
Europe.
The large UK law firms and accountancy
practices have announced significant
recent growth in their businesses and
are investing commensurately in their IT
systems. Tikit is ideally positioned to
provide consultancy, services and
products to help these firms derive
maximum benefit from their IT
investment. In 2006, we estimate that
the top one hundred law firms in the UK
spent approximately £500 million on IT
products and services. The top fifty
accountancy firms spent an estimated
£300 million. At this stage of our
development we do not believe that the
size of our chosen market is a limit to
our growth.
Tikit’s competitive advantage is that it is
a specialised business focused on the
large legal and accountancy markets.
This differentiates us from general IT
consultancy organisations. Our
relationship with clients is from a service
perspective in that we understand how
large law firms and accountancy
practices work, their language and
culture. We understand their business
issues and can help them identify
potential IT-based solutions to those
issues. We differentiate ourselves from
software vendors by our independence
and, whilst we have strong relationships
with our software partners, our strength
is that we endeavour to select the best
of breed software appropriate to our
clients’ needs and are not committed to
providing standard solutions. There may
be some short-term risk associated with
this strategy given that new software
developments may render existing
partnership arrangements
inappropriate. This may lead to short-
term direct competition from software
vendors.
Our focus remains on achieving strong
organic growth. At the same time we
continue to look for businesses, products
or services that can further expand our
current portfolio. We also believe that
Tikit is well positioned to participate in
the consolidation that is taking place in
both the legal and accountancy sectors.
The average size of the top one hundred
UK law firms continues to rise faster
than the overall market because of
merger activity. We believe that the large
UK law firms will lead consolidation
across Europe and that Tikit, with its
strong client base among those firms,
will benefit from this.
The Group’s pipeline of consultancy and
implementation projects should provide
the opportunity to schedule resources
more efficiently and improve utilisation.
The managed services group will
continue to streamline its services so
that clients can benefit from the full
range of support offerings, from
hardware and infrastructure support to
onsite support for complex applications.
In addition, the introduction of a number
of new software products during 2006 is
expected to result in additional sales in
2007 and beyond.
The key performance indicators (KPI’s)
used by your Board to measure the
success of the business remain those
that have underpinned our success to
date. The most important of these is

When your board considers risk issues
going forward, the prominent element
is dependence on our people.
customer retention, especially reflected
in support contract renewal rates.
Following our first year in business,
some 13 years ago, we have had annual
renewal rates in excess of 90%. With 92
of the top one hundred UK law firms as
clients and 18 of the top fifty
accountancy practices, it is essential
that we retain existing clients at the
same time as winning new ones.
The second KPI is the organic growth of
our revenues and this should be at least
as great as that of the top one hundred
firms. In addition, we seek to add
additional services so that our actual
revenue growth is higher . The third KPI
is the operating margin that we are able
to achieve. Since inception in 1994, Tikit
has had operating margins in excess of
10%, with the exception of the year
ended 31 December 2002 where
operating margin was 6.5%. We aim to
have operating margins of 12.5%. A final
KPI is our ability to generate cash from
our operating activities — in our view,
the true measure of profit. This is an
area where Tikit has excelled over the
years. We aim to achieve a conversion
ratio of profit before tax to cash of at
least 100%.
In commenting upon the capital
structure of the company, I draw
attention to the acquisitions made by us
that have largely been funded by the
cash generated by the business. We have
been able to act quickly without incurring
the time and costs associated with equity
or debt fundraisings. The company has
had no debt since its inception in 1994.
However , we continue to consider the
most appropriate capital structure given
the outlook for interest rates on long-
term debt. There is a determination not
to hold surplus cash and we will return
such cash to shareholders by a
combination of the progressive dividend
policy where it is our intention to provide
shareholders with a yield over 2%,
combined with the purchase of shares in
the market for cancellation.
Business review — risks
When your board considers risk issues
going forward, the prominent element is
the dependence on our people. We
recognise the value of their
Chairman’s Statement
13534TIKITGRO:13534TIKITGRO  12/4/07  08:41  Page 10 13534 30/03/2007 Proof 7
commitment and are conscious that we
must keep the reward systems, both
financial and motivational, in place to
minimise this area of risk; our proposed
LTIP is an example of this. A second risk
issue, competition, arises in relation to
our strong position with the large law
firms. Given that there is no external
direct competition of any size in this
market, we must be careful not to abuse
our position. The main competition issue
in any project proposal is whether a law
firm’s internal IT department may wish
to undertake the assignment itself.
Accordingly, our services are designed
to complement and assist internal staff
rather than replace them. Finally, we are
aware of the supply risk of losing key
software partners. This would have a
short-term impact as we sought to
identify and then train our staff in a
suitable alternative product. We have an
excellent record of maintaining good
relationships with our software partners
and usually get notice of impending
changes in time to minimise the impact
on Tikit.
Environmental policies
The Group acknowledges the
importance of environmental matters
and where possible, utilises environment
friendly policies in its offices, such as
recycling and energy efficient practices.
Summary and prospects
In summary, 2006 was an excellent year
for the Group. We enter 2007 with a
good order book of projects to be
implemented, reflecting a blend of
consultancy, support and software
business sold in the last quarter . The
targets we have set ourselves for 2007
and 2008 are challenging and, if met,
will lead to further significant
improvements in the trading
performance of the Group and to
earnings per share. Tikit’s opportunities
are many and your Board continues to
be optimistic about the trading
prospects of the Group.

04 t he group continued to 
make good progress during 
the year. 
Despite the well publicised financial 
challenges facing the NHS and similar 
constraints faced by providers of 
healthcare in other territories, turnover 
increased to £3.4 million and the loss 
after tax was halved to £1.9 million. 
Capital sales accounted for 47% of sales, 
with sensor and fee–per–use sales 
accounting for 51%. 
Notable events included the sale of  
31 monitors to the US Army, the sale  
of 49 monitors to a USA medical 
equipment leasing company and the 
publication of the St George’s Hospital 
outcome study in the Critical Care 
journal. 
The UK and USA direct sales teams 
continued to perform well, and the 
performance of most European 
distributors has been encouraging. The 
performance of the Group’s regional 
partners in the USA was, however, 
disappointing and sales activity in the 
USA therefore continued to rely mostly  
on our direct sales team. We will continue 
to look for additional distribution support.
Regulatory approval was achieved  
and sales activities were launched in a 
further six countries, bringing the total 
number of countries in which the Group’s 
products are registered and marketed  
to 16, 13 in the EU plus the USA, Brazil 
and Japan. 
The Board appreciates the importance of 
maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance and complies with most 
provisions of the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance. During the year, 
the Board performed a wide–ranging 
review of risks and controls. Annual 
independent audits are performed  
to ensure that the Group’s systems, 
procedures and products continue to 
comply with the requirements of Quality 
Standards BS EN ISO 9001:2000 and BS 
EN ISO 13485:2003 and the EC Medical 
Devices Directive. These audits represent 
independent verification of the Group’s 
compliance with some of the key 
elements of corporate governance.
In addition, the Board conducted a review 
of its own composition and performance. 
In May 2005, Hugh McGarel–Groves joined 
the Group and was appointed as Finance 
Director, and in October Ian Brown was 
appointed as a Non–executive Director to 
replace Bert Wiegman, who resigned from 
the Board in December. We are grateful for 
Mr Wiegman’s valuable contribution since 
his appointment in 2001. Mr Brown brings 
with him extensive commercial experience 
in the medical device markets. In January 
2006, Grant Thornton UK LLP were 
appointed as the Group’s auditors. 
During the year, the Group made use  
of its assets to strengthen its working–
capital position, putting in place a 
revolving secured convertible loan 
facility and further agreements with a 
medical equipment leasing company 
relating to installed monitors. 
The body of validation data in support of 
hemodynamic monitoring and the Group’s 
products continues to grow. This and our 
record of continuing to address the needs 
of our customers through regular product 
improvements and upgrades, together 
with our strong direct sales and 
operational teams, places the Group in  
a strong position to take advantage of 
opportunities and further grow the 
business.  
once again, i would like to 
extend my thanks to all the 
group’s Directors and staff 
for their hard work and 
dedication during the year 
and to our Clinical advisory 
Board for its support and 
enthusiasm.

Chief Executive’s Review
2013 represented the beginning of a 
new era in the Company’s history as 
we became a recognised Operator 
in two more countries in the MENA 
region and established our credentials 
as a recognised Operator in 
Colombia, made significant changes 
to the shape of our business and 
meaningfully reduced our overheads 
and general costs of operating.
Mahdi Sajjad
Chief Executive Officer
Our objective over the past two years has been to secure new 
opportunities to grow our Company and create shareholder 
wealth in countries outside of Syria where the continuing unrest 
and economic sanctions mean that our oil and gas production 
capability remains idle and unavailable to generate revenues for 
the benefit of our stakeholders.
Overall, we are pleased with the progress we made during 2013 
to establish a presence in each of these countries and to begin 
operations that we believe provide our Group with the potential 
to create projects of significant value and generate revenues with 
which to build substantial business units that provide necessary 
diversity in our portfolio. That we have managed to deliver 
significant progress while continuing to carefully husband our 
financial resources is of itself a considerable achievement and one 
for which everyone in our organisation can deservedly be proud.
Morocco
Following the late January completion of the acquisition of the 
Cabre Maroc portfolio of onshore permits in northern Morocco, 
we moved swiftly to commence two seismic programmes, 
a 3D seismic programme on the Rharb permits (100% interest 
pre-ONHYM participation) to assist in the planning and execution 
of a nine well, exploration programme and a 2D seismic 
programme to identify drillable prospects on a planned three 
well exploration programme on the Fes permit (66.7% interest 
pre-ONHYM participation).
These two seismic programmes began in late June 2013, 
with the 220 km² 3D seismic programme on the Rharb permits, 
being completed in October while the approximately 650 km 2D 
seismic programme on the Fes permit was concluded in February 
of this year.
With the benefit of being able to deploy to Morocco a number 
of our experienced employees from the technical team who 
contributed to great success in Syria, we were able to quickly 
evaluate a range of options to permit the commencement of 
exploration drilling on the Rharb Centre licence and this resulted 
in the importation to Morocco of a drill rig operated by COFOR, 
the drilling subsidiary of the Vinci group, one of France’s biggest 
companies and a group already well established in Morocco.
Each of the first three exploration wells drilled on the Rharb 
Centre permit, in the first part of what is planned to be a nine well 
programme, intersected gas bearing reservoirs but unfortunately 
these were not considered to be of sufficient magnitude as to 
be commercial with the consequence that each of the wells was 
plugged and abandoned. As we now have access to the higher 
quality 3D seismic data acquired in our contemporaneous data 
capture programme, we are hopeful that the subsequent wells to 
be drilled in this programme utilising this 3D data, will meet with 
greater success when drilling commences in the next month.
The initial 650 km portion of a 2D seismic programme that will 
eventually involve the capture of 1,000 km of data over the Fes 
licence area is now being processed by Spectrum and following 
interpretation later this year we expect to be in a position to start 
drilling the first well in a three exploration well programme on the 
Fes permit area.
Colombia
Following award of the PUT 14 and LLA 50 blocks in the Ronda 
2012 bid round, the Group has established itself in Bogota, 
Colombia with a team of experienced local professionals 
supplemented by assistance provided by our local partner 
Luna Energy.
Late in the fourth quarter of the year we finalised joint venture farm 
out arrangements with Luna Energy on both of our blocks resulting 
in our Group retaining a 55% working interest partially carried by 
Luna Energy (45%) in each of these joint ventures.
Work is now underway to complete the environmental, community 
and security assessments that are a necessary preliminary to the 
commencement of exploration activities on each of our blocks 
with the end of this year targeted for the commencement of 
a programme of approximately 100 km of 2D seismic on the 
PUT 14 block with a similarly sized programme anticipated to 
be undertaken on the LLA 50 block during the first half of 2015. Gulfsands Petroleum plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013  7
Introduction Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Tunisia
During 2013 we concluded arrangements with our former partners, 
which remain subject to final regulatory approval, to withdraw from 
our non-operated 40% interest in the Kerkouane licence offshore 
Tunisia and the adjacent Pantellaria permit in Italian waters while at 
the same time we increased our interest in the Chorbane onshore 
licence to 100% and assumed operatorship.
Planning is currently underway for a 2D seismic programme of 
approximately 105 km to be carried out over two areas in the north 
east corner of this block nearby to existing producing oil fields 
on an adjacent licence. We plan to commence this programme 
once local licensing and other regulatory approvals are obtained 
with the intention of using the data obtained in the programme 
to locate at least one exploration well which is anticipated to be 
drilled next year.
Syria 
While the situation in Syria remains unresolved and sanctions 
prevent our returning to active operatorship of the Khurbet East 
and Yousefieh oil fields held by the Block 26 joint venture in north 
east Syria (Gulfsands 50% and Operator with Sinochem 50%), 
we are fortunate to be able to confirm that our facilities remain 
intact with the two oil fields having remained closed in for almost 
the entire year save for some very small, intermittent production to 
provide energy to the local community. Security for our fields and 
facilities is provided by a combination of central government military 
personnel and trained volunteers from the local community and 
together these groups have ensured that these valuable assets 
remain safe and secure and in a condition to allow us to return the 
fields to full operation as soon as sanctions permit us to do so.
With our partner Sinochem’s unwavering support, we have been 
able to help our staff to remain safe and their families provided with 
financial support to help them through this difficult time. Our much 
reduced but fiercely loyal and dedicated staff in Damascus has 
enabled us to maintain a continuous local presence in Syria and for 
that I am and our Board and shareholders are enormously grateful.
Reshaping our business
During the past twelve months our Management has continued 
to evaluate and capture, where sensible to do so, a number of 
new business opportunities that have enabled us to diversify our 
portfolio of projects and, we believe, provide the Group with a 
bright future.
The pursuit of these opportunities has required the reshaping of 
our organisation and that has brought with it a number of changes 
to our management team including my appointment to the role 
of CEO, Alan Cutler’s appointment as Director – Finance and 
Administration and the addition of a number of highly motivated 
finance, administration and technical people who have either joined 
the organisation or been promoted from within. I am especially 
pleased to report that we have managed to effect all of these 
changes while at the same time making significant progress with 
our efforts to further reduce our overheads and general operating 
costs, a process that will continue during the remainder of this year.
We are acutely conscious of the need to manage carefully the 
financial resources we have available to help us in building upon 
these new business initiatives so we will continue to explore the 
approaches we regularly receive from energy sector participants 
and investors that might be utilised to finance our business 
development ambitions at the least possible cost to our existing 
stakeholders. Further assessment of the Company’s going concern 
status is made in note 1.3a of the Financial Statements.
Finally, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the 
tremendous effort made by our employees and members of the 
Board to position the Company to develop the new business units 
and projects that we now have underway in Morocco, Tunisia 
and Colombia.

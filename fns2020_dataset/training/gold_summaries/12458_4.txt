The brands
Three brands with unique appeal
The Park Plaza Hotels & Resorts brand (part of Carlson Hotels Worldwide) to which we  
have exclusive rights in 56 countries, consists of full service hotels. Each is ideally located at  
the heart of its city’s business and cultural life. Thanks to a design-led approach, guests’ first 
impressions of stylish and welcoming lobbies are confirmed by guestrooms notable for space, 
distinctive décor and state-of-the-art facilities. Park Plaza Hotels & Resorts average 150 to 500 
rooms and suites. Carlson is further strengthening the Park Plaza Hotels & Resorts brand by 
developing contemporary hotels in key travel destinations such as Bangkok, Beijing and Shanghai. 
Our art’otels – a brand which we acquired in July 2007 – are unique. Each showcases the  
work of a single contemporary artist, such as Andy Warhol, Georg Baselitz and Donald Sultan. 
art’otels are destination lifestyle hotels where modern interiors blend with contemporary art. 
They are carefully sited in the best neighbourhoods for shopping and culture.
The Group’s three Chino Latino bars and restaurants offer a refreshing fusion of exotic  
cocktails and contemporary pan-Asian cuisine – all in lively and glamorous settings. Adjuncts to 
our hotels in London, Leeds and Nottingham, they have become highly popular local destinations 
in themselves.

Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
After a good first half year in which the Company made 
progress in meeting its objectives, the second half year 
deteriorated progressively as the crisis deepened within the 
financial services sector — our principal market. Although 
our products are firmly within the ‘spend to save’ category, 
and there is increasing evidence of demand, our clients have 
subjected expenditure on new and existing IT projects to more 
intense scrutiny since October 2008. This has led to delays 
in placing orders and, in certain instances, cancellation of 
projects which were at a late stage of negotiation. As a result, 
performance in the last quarter of the year was significantly 
below forecast, affecting the results for the year as a whole 
which were below expectations.
Results and finance
Following the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the 
Company’s new Auditors in September 2008, the opportunity 
was taken after the year end to review the detailed treatment 
of R&D capitalisation and amortisation policies under IFRS. 
This led to a restatement of the results for the year to 
31 January 2008, reducing the amount charged to the Income 
Statement for development expenditure and amortisation by 
an aggregate £231,000, thereby reducing the stated loss for 
that year.
After recording an increase in revenue during the first half 
year, a very quiet last quarter of the year resulted in total 
revenue for the year to 31 January 2009 of £3.7m (2008: 
£4.1m) and an operating loss of £792,000 (2008: previously 
stated: £897,000; restated: £683,000). The loss before tax 
was £753,000 (2008: previously stated: £815,000; restated: 
£601,000). The loss per share was 5.5p (2008: previously 
stated: 5.0p; restated: 3.8p).
Net cash at the year end was £262,000 (2008: £878,000) and 
cash balances are currently at a higher level.
Dividend
The Board will not be declaring a dividend for the year ended 
31 January 2009. 
Board and senior management
During the second half of the year, Robert Maxfield joined 
the Company as Head of Sales with a brief to help convert a 
promising pipeline of potential business into firm orders. 
I am pleased to report that Robert is making good progress.
More recently we announced that Violetta Parylo had resigned 
as Finance Director and has now left the Company to take up 
a position in a larger organisation. Given the current size of 
eg solutions, it has become apparent to the Board that the 
role of Finance Director does not warrant a full-time executive 
position. Accordingly, the Company has decided that the 
position of Finance Director will become a part-time position 
supported by the current Financial Controller and accounts 
staff.
Andy McRae, currently a Non-executive Director of the 
Company and a qualified UK Chartered Accountant, has 
assumed the position of part-time Finance Director until a 
suitable replacement with public company experience has 
been appointed.

Current trading and outlook
In the period end trading update issued in January 2009, we 
noted that our pipeline of potential sales was stronger than 
at any time in the past 24 months. That continues to be the 
case and our focus is on converting this potential into signed 
contracts. While trading conditions are difficult and customer 
decision times are longer, steady progress is being made in 
closing new sales contracts.
Meanwhile, the Company’s net cash deposits have increased 
since the year-end; and together with a bank facility for the 
forthcoming year, this provides adequate financing for the 
foreseeable future.

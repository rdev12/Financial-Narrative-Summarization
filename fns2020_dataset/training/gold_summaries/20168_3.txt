When I joined 3i in 2010, I believed that it 
was fundamentally a strong business 
which had not recovered purpose and 
direction since the financial crisis. The 
appointment of Simon Borrows as Chief 
Executive in 2012, and the subsequent 
strategic review, resulted in a clear set  
of objectives designed to enable 3i to 
generate long-term value through the 
economic cycle. 3i has focused back to its 
core sectors and geographies, underpinned 
by a strengthened investment process  
and by a disciplined approach to cost 
management. I am pleased to report that 
Simon and his management team have 
made excellent progress against these 
objectives and the 3i of today is a more 
resilient and high performing operation.
PERFORMANCE
In 2015 all three businesses contributed to the good 
performance. Against an unstable macro-economic 
environment and geo-political landscape we generated 
strong realisations of £841 million (2014: £677 million).  
We added four new companies to our Private Equity 
portfolio with total cash invested of £369 million  
(2014: £276 million). With significant levels of capital 
searching for good investment and returns as well as  
the continuation of central bank measures such as 
quantitative easing, we have invested selectively. We have 
focused on companies where our sector expertise and 
international experience can generate enhanced returns. 
Our Infrastructure business performed well and our 
holding in 3i Infrastructure plc delivered a 25% total 
shareholder return, its strongest annual return since  
its IPO in 2007 . Debt Management benefited from a very 
good year of fund raising in its CLO funds and, in an 
important diversification, launched a €250 million 
European Middle Market Loan fund.
DIVIDEND
The Board has declared a total dividend of 20.0p (2014: 
20.0p) for 2015. This is made up of an 8.1p base dividend 
and an 1 1.9p additional dividend, making a total of 20.0p for 
the year after taking into account the interim dividend paid 
in January 2015. Due to net divestment in the year and our 
robust balance sheet, we have proposed an additional 
dividend above the top end of our 15% – 20% distribution 
range, equivalent to 23% of gross realised proceeds. 
Subject to shareholder approval, we will pay the final 
dividend of 14.0p (2014: 13.3p) in July 2015.
OUTLOOK
We remain cautious about the current environment.  
Many financial markets are at or near all time highs and 
currencies are subject to increased volatility. We are 
focused on enhancing the value of our existing investment 
portfolio as well as pursuing investment opportunities if 
the strategic and financial case is strong. 
BOARD CHANGES
I will be stepping down as Chairman after the AGM in June 
2015. The Board has announced that Simon Thompson  
will succeed me as Chairman. Simon is an experienced 
FTSE 100 chairman and non-executive director. He joined 
the Board in April and will take over from me in June. It 
has been a great privilege to serve in the role of Chairman 
over the last five years as 3i has progressively recovered 
its poise, and I am confident that, in its 70th year, I am 
leaving the Group in very capable hands. 
I wish 3i, its employees, investors and all of its 
stakeholders every success for the future.

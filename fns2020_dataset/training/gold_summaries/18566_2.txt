Ensuring that good governance  
is achieved throughout G4S is  
vital for the delivery of long term 
sustainable value for shareholders 
and for all the group’s stakeholders.
This is an integrated report, 
combining our annual report and 
accounts with our core corporate 
social responsibility approach. This 
reflects the fact that our corporate 
values influence every aspect of our 
culture and day-to-day business 
activity and recognises that 
sustainability strategies are best 
achieved when integrated into 
business practices.
The strategic report is set out within 
the Strategy and Business review on 
pages 4 to 54 and the Chief Financial 
Officer’s review on pages 96 to 105.

COBHAM’S INTERNA TIONAL

IN F AST GROWING MARKETS
The Group in 2014
Cobham is a provider of specialist 
technologies and know-how for 
components and subsystems, in 
its four Sectors; Communications 
and Connectivity, Mission Systems, 
Advanced Electronic Solutions and 
Aviation Services. It has three broad 
end markets which comprise 
commercial, US defence/security  
and non-US defence/security. 
Our Sectors
The Group has transitioned to a new 
operational structure in the year, with 
four realigned Sectors replacing the 
four Divisions. The former Aerospace 
and Security Division has been 
renamed the Communications and 
Connectivity Sector to reflect the 
significant amount of revenue it now 
generates in other markets, including 
marine and wireless communications. 
The former Defence Systems Division 
has been renamed the Advanced 
Electronic Solutions Sector to reflect 
the commercial revenue it generates 
following the Aeroflex acquisition.

ENRC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 In under fifteen years, ENRC has transformed itself into one of the world’s 
largest and fastest-growing natural resources groups, well positioned to take 
a leading role in the global mining industry. Integrating Kazakhstan’s foremost 
mining, processing, power and logistics operations, ENRC is now firmly 
established as a world-class business with 2007 revenue in excess of 
$4 billion, an ongoing investment programme that invested over $900 million 
in 2007 and over 64,000 employees.
The Ferroalloy Division was established in 1995. Its mining operations comprise 
Kazchrome’s Donskoy GOK and, manganese miner, Zhairemsky GOK. The Division 
also includes the Aktobe and Aksu ferroalloy plants and the Akturbo gas-fired 
power station. The Division produces and sells high-carbon ferrochrome, 
medium- and low-carbon ferrochrome and other alloys, including 
ferrosilicochrome, ferrosilicomanganese and ferrosilicon, as well as chrome and 
manganese concentrate. The Division sells its ferroalloys primarily to steel 
producers and sells the remaining chrome and manganese ore to third party 
ferroalloy producers and the chemical industry. The Ferroalloy Division, according 
to estimates, is the world’s largest ferrochrome producer, by chrome content. 
The Iron Ore Division was established in 1996. The Division includes primary 
mining operations that produce iron ore, ancillary mining operations that 
produce limestone, dolomite and bentonite-clay, an iron ore processing plant 
and a power plant. It mines and processes iron ore into iron ore concentrate 
and pellets for sale primarily to steel producers. The Division’s external 
energy needs are provided by the Group’s Energy Division. The Iron Ore 
Division sells much of its iron ore to the Russian steel producer, MMK, under 
a long-term contract. The Iron Ore Division, according to estimates, is the 
sixth largest iron ore exporter by volume in the world.
The Alumina and Aluminium Division was established in 1996. The Division’s 
assets include two bauxite mining units, a limestone mine, an alumina 
refinery and a power station. A new aluminium smelter was commissioned  
in December 2007 with an initial capacity of 62,500 tonnes per annum.  
The Division sells its alumina, which it produces from mined bauxite, 
primarily to the Russian aluminium producer, United Company RUSAL (‘UC 
RUSAL’), under  a long-term contract. The Alumina and Aluminium Division, 
according to estimates, is the fifth largest supplier of traded alumina by 
volume in the world.
The Energy Division was established in 1996. The Division is one of the 
largest producers of electricity and coal in Kazakhstan, accounting for 
approximately 16% of the country’s recorded electricity production in 2007. 
The Division operates through Eurasian Energy Corporation JSC (‘EEC’), and 
includes a hydroelectric power station. The Division supplies electricity and 
coal primarily to the Company’s other divisions (42% of the Division’s 2007 
revenue) as well as to third parties. Within the Division, the coal mine and 
power station supply coal and electricity to each other. The Division also 
purchases electricity for resale from third parties. 
The Logistics Division was established in 1999. The Division provides 
transportation and logistical services to the Group’s primary operating 
divisions (36% of the Division’s 2007 revenue) and to third parties. The 
Division’s operations include three core businesses: freight forwarding; 
railway construction and maintenance; and wagon and locomotive repair.  
In addition, the Division operates a transfer and reloading terminal on the 
Kazakhstan and Chinese border.

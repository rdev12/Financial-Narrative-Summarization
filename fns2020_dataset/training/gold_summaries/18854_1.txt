The Board is reviewing all development projects and 
enhancement opportunities. 
Gas realisations are anticipated to remain at current levels 
in Ukraine through 2016, with Rouble-denominated gas 
realisations in Russia expected to remain flat and to decrease 
in US$-terms, if the Rouble devalues.
Risks 
Ukraine	
Investment plans in Ukraine to increase production may be 
impacted if there is any further government intervention in 
the gas market or increases to gas production tax. Production 
growth requires the economic parameters for investment in 
Ukraine being maintained.
Russia	
In Russia, tubing replacements at our wells are complex and 
the chances of success are reduced due to the depth of the 
wells and the high temperatures and high pressures at which 
they operate. 
Future development work may only be commercial with  
higher local gas prices and a strengthening of the Rouble 
against the US$.
The Russian gas prices are controlled by the government and 
therefore may not increase in line with current expectations. 
In addition, the Rouble could weaken against the US$ and both 
of these factors could reduce the value of future projects in 
Russia and their net returns.
Ukraine
Development drilling in Ukraine was suspended in 2015 
because of the government’s intervention in the gas sales 
market including the introduction of punitive rates of 
production tax, foreign exchange controls and government-
imposed restrictions on the sale of gas. Consequently, further 
development of the Elizavetovskoye field was on hold in 2015, 
although workover operations have continued in our mature 
Ukrainian fields.
In Ukraine, production decreased by 10% to 4,325 boepd, gas 
realisations reduced to $7.65/Mcf, as did production costs at 
$7.45/boepd.
The three wells at our Elizavetovskoye field, contributed 
production of 1,715 boepd (10.1 MMcfd of gas and 29 bopd).
Production at our mature fields in the Novo-Nikolaevskoye 
Complex reduced 20% to 2,611 boepd.
Russia	
In Russia, tubing failures in two of the five production wells at 
the Koshekhablskoye field continued to constrain production 
in 2015 to approximately 30 MMcfd from the remaining three 
wells (see page 37). One of these wells, well-27 was restored 
to production in December 2015 following repairs and 
recompletion.
Production in 2015 reduced 9% to 4,671 boepd and our local 
gas price improved 7% on 1 July 2015. 
The Russian authorities issued their approval of the upgrade 
project for expansion of our Russian GPF capacity to 60 MMcfd 
in 2015, which permitted the project to be completed. The 
nominal processing capacity of the GPF is close to 60 MMcfd 
(approximately 10,000 boepd).
Outlook for 2016 and beyond
Production in 2016 is expected to increase following the 
restoration of well-27 in Russia, in December 2015, the cost of 
which was mostly covered by insurance proceeds. 
A new Board was appointed at JKX on 28 January 2016  
(see page 6). After visting the Group’s main assets within  
30 days of its appointment, the new Board is encouraged by  
the physical characteristics of the reservoirs in both Russia  
and Ukraine.

Outlook for 2016 and beyond 
Future reserves replacement in Ukraine requires capital 
investment and the Board that was appointed on 28 January 
2016 is reviewing the investment programme in Ukraine and 
Russia for 2016. 
Risks 
The calculations to measure oil and gas reserves require an 
estimate of expected future oil and gas prices. If a prolonged 
period of low oil and gas prices is forecast, the commercial 
returns from development projects reduce, which in turn can 
reduce the reserves assessments. 
The oil price is mainly influenced by international markets. 
In Russia the governments control the gas sales price and 
in both Ukraine and Russia governments control other key 
economic parameters for investment there. It is therefore 
difficult to predict whether any of these parameters affect JKX 
in the foreseeable future which may impact the commercial 
rates of return for investments into oil and gas projects.
Russia	
Wells at the Russian gas field are deep, complex and 
expensive, and will require significant technical analysis in 
advance to de-risk the project.
Reserves reassessment
66.1 MMboe 29.7 MMboe 
During the year our estimation of remaining 2P reserves decreased 
by 6.2 Bcf of gas (total 1.0 MMboe). Our reserves were independently 
reviewed by DeGolyer & MacNaughton at 31 December 2014 and 
updated internally to 31 December 2015.
During the year our estimation of remaining 2P reserves increased 
by 9.6 Bcf of gas and 0.8 MMbbl of oil (total 2.4 MMboe). Our reserves 
were independently reviewed by DeGolyer & MacNaughton at  
31 December 2014 and updated internally to 31 December 2015.

Our UK-based technical team focus on refining the Group’s 
short, medium and long term plans to maximise value from 
existing reserves and to increase the reserves in our licence 
areas. 
This requires applying the latest Western technologies to 
interpret the subsurface data and production results. We 
use this to regularly reschedule our drilling targets and field 
development plans to maximise our cash flows and chances of 
success. 
In addition the UK team oversees the day-to-day technical 
challenges that arise at our fields and support the Group’s 
business development activities with technical due diligence 
when new opportunities arise. 
We regularly use independent engineering firms to estimate 
our reserves and resources which provide a certain level of 
assurance over our own assessments.
We share technical knowledge and resources between our 
projects in Ukraine and Russia.
Progress in 2015
Our 2P reserves have been assessed at 95.7 MMboe (Russia 
66.1 MMboe; Ukraine 29.7 MMboe). Our reserves replacement 
ratio was 42%.
In Ukraine, our potential to increase reserves has been 
extremely limited in 2015 due to the suspension of 
development drilling at the beginning of the year as a result of 
the government’s introduction of punitive rates of production 
tax, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on the sale 
of gas (see page 32). The rate of gas production tax has now 
reduced to 29% from 1 January 2016, and there has been no 
further direct government intervention in the gas sales market 
since it expired in February 2015. 
Why is oil and gas reserves growth important?
Production from our oil and gas reserves in Ukraine and 
southern Russia will continue to generate cash to fund future 
development and exploration in the region. 
The reserves replacement ratio measures the amount of new 
oil and gas reserves that we have discovered during the year 
compared with what we have produced from existing reserves.
Our ability to replenish and grow our reserves base is a good 
indicator of the success of our exploration and appraisal 
programme and ensures sustainable production.
How we go about it
To ensure we can continue to grow our oil and gas reserves we 
maintain a balance of investment in:
• exploration
• appraisal and 
• development projects.
Visionary	 marketplace	 analysis	 and	 subsurface	 expertise
Exploration includes acquiring new oil and gas exploration 
and production licences when they arise in the region and 
continuing with our exploration programme across our 
existing portfolio of licences. We continue to screen a lot of 
potential opportunities in central and eastern Europe that fit 
with the Company’s strategy.
We continue to focus on geographies and geologies that we 
understand in central and eastern Europe. 
Significant	 regional	 experience	 and	 local	 expertise
Our three technical teams in London, Poltava (Ukraine) and 
Maikop (southern Russia) all have important roles to achieve 
the highest quality results from subsurface.

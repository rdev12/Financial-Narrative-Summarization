 Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to report that 2006 has been another year of considerable achievement for Osmetech.
Our Molecular Diagnostics Division received FDA clearance for its eSensor
®
Cystic Fibrosis screening
test and has achieved its first sales of diagnostics products in this rapidly developing and strategically
important market.
In December 2006 we announced that the sale of our Critical Care Division to our veterinary partner,
IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. for $44.9m in cash had been agreed. This sale was completed at the end of
January 2007, crystallising a considerable gain in the value of this business under Osmetech’s ownership
and management since its acquisition from Roche Diagnostics in April 2003.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our Critical Care Division employees for their
dedication, enthusiasm and commitment over the past few years in helping to create a strong and
successful business in the blood gas market. The Board wishes them well for the future as they enter an
exciting new chapter under IDEXX’s ownership.
The sale of the Critical Care Division has demonstrated the skill of the Osmetech management team in
acquiring and developing underexploited assets and now management is focussed solely on the major
opportunities available in Molecular Diagnostics market. We are confident that we can deliver similar
success with our Molecular Diagnostics business, which is now appropriately funded, and I look forward
to updating shareholders on further progress in due course.

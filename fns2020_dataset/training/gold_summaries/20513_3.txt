 Chairman’s Statement
Creating quality  
outcomes...
AMS has had another year of strong performance 
and continues to progress as a leading, 
international provider of high quality, high 
value, innovative and technologically advanced 
products for the surgical and advanced  
woundcare markets. We are pleased that we have 
delivered another year of strong revenue growth, 
profit performance and good cash generation.
I am pleased to report a 20% increase in 
revenue to £82.6 million (2015: £68.6 million), 
representing growth of 13% on a constant 
currency basis and an increase in adjusted

 profit 
before tax before exceptional items of 13% to 
£19.7 million (2015: £17.4 million), and an increase 
in profit before taxation of 12% to £19.1 million 
(2015: £17.0 million). The continued strong cash 
flow generation of the business has resulted 
in the Group ending the year with net cash 
of £51.1 million (2015: £34.2 million).
Our strategy of having multiple products and 
multiple routes to market continues to pay off 
and we have made good progress across all 
Business Units in the last year. Whilst revenue 
growth was steady in our Branded Direct 
Business Unit, our Branded Distributed Business 
Unit’s success in the US has continued with 
LiquiBand
®
 gaining market share, and surpassing 
our initial 20% target market share. We have 
also launched a range of dental sutures into 
the US through a new partner and we intend 
to expand our distribution network more widely 
by targeting market opportunities in Asia-Pacific 
and South America.

using medical adhesive inside the body, with 
plans in place for open surgery hernia use

The Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.62p 
per share, making a total dividend for the year 
of 0.92p per share (2015: 0.80p), an increase of 
15%. If approved at the Annual General Meeting, 
this dividend will be paid on 16 June 2017 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 26 May 2017.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all 
of our employees for their contributions during 
the past year which have been central to the 
Company’s strong performance. I would also 
like to thank our customers, suppliers, business 
partners and shareholders for their continued 
support in helping AMS achieve its goals.
We ensure that the Group is managed in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code as far as is reasonably practicable, 
although it is not a requirement for an AIM 
quoted company. The Board believes that 
effective corporate governance will assist in the 
delivery of shareholder value and safe-guarding 
shareholders’ long-term interests.
AMS continues to be in robust financial health 
and is well positioned to invest in both internal 
and external opportunities in line with the 
Group’s long-term strategy priorities and 
growth objectives.

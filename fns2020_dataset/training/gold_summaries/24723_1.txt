Review of 2011
In any normal period, 201 1 would have felt 
like an extraordinary year. However, in these 
times, it is more like the norm. After an 
optimistic start, sentiment turned negative 
in August weighed down by the debate 
over Chinese economic prospects, the 
continuing eurozone sovereign debt crisis 
and slowing global growth. Emerging 
markets such as Brazil, India and China, 
which had performed well in 2010, retreated 
in 201 1 as concerns of higher inflation and 
weaker global demand increased and as 
investors’ risk appetites waned.
Notwithstanding these events, the Group 
delivered a strong financial result in 201 1 with 
underlying profit up 58%. We also made good 
progress in our key strategic objectives, 
including growing our retail and absolute 
return businesses, and I would like to thank  
all staff for their continued dedication. The 
Chairman has highlighted the success of  
the Gartmore acquisition and I echo his 
Strong profit growth and 
continued margin 
improvements
Good progress towards 
achieving strategic 
objectives
Gartmore acquisition 
exceeds expectations and 
strengthens our business
comments. Gartmore wasn’t the only 
corporate activity we focused on. With clear 
sight on our central business priorities, we 
exited a number of non-core businesses 
which has improved efficiency in the business.
In 2012, we will continue to focus on 
progressing towards our strategic objectives. 
The Gartmore and New Star acquisitions 
have provided a solid base from which to 
grow our UK retail business. Our SICAV 
fund range is strongly positioned for when 
investor demand returns and in our US 
retail fund range, we plan to develop 
more investment propositions.
We are well placed to further grow our 
absolute return fund range and we are 
bringing in new talent to develop our 
global product.
By staying close to our clients and partners, 
whilst focusing on efficiency in the business, 
we are confident that we can continue to 
grow profitably.
After a positive start,  
political and economic  
events resulted in increased  
market volatility and  
lower market levels

Changes in the political landscape
One of the most noticeable developments in 
201 1 was the increasing influence of 
political events on capital market behaviour. 
This different dimension generated further 
volatility and uncertainty. The political 
impasse in many developed nations and 
resultant lack of clarity was most notable  
in the eurozone and questions remain over 
the sustainability of the euro. These political 
ramifications have a disproportionate 
influence over the investment universe, 
making the challenge for investment 
managers even greater. Similarly, the 
political upheavals seen in the Middle East 
coupled with a number of elections and 
leadership changes due to take place will 
add to uncertainty and volatility, at least in 
the near term. 
That said, company valuations on many 
measures sit at undemanding levels and 
earnings growth is gathering pace. We 
expect to see company valuations to be less 
correlated to the risks associated with 
country specific economies and therefore 
could perform better despite these 
economic headwinds.
Outlook for equities
The balance of economic data seen more 
recently already seems to show that the 
eurozone is in recession and is likely to stay 
there through the first quarter of 2012. 
However, we see this as an opportunity. 
Whilst European equities may have further 
short-term downside, they are already 
trading at compelling values. Investors  
need courage in these markets but  
this is precisely the time to seize  
long-term opportunities. 
The US is more finely balanced and has a 
good chance of avoiding recession, although 
it remains vulnerable to global events such 
as those unfolding across Europe. In the US, 
equities are the asset class that has most 
discounted a weak outlook and therefore 
offer the most upside potential, especially  
as investors have largely been sellers of  
US equities for the last 10 years. 
Over the last decade, the Western world 
spent more than it saved, but Asia did the 
opposite. In the coming year, we hope to  
see the beginnings of a reversal of this cycle 
as consumption levels rise in Asia with 
governments more focused on domestic 
demand rather than exports which, given  
the deterioration in global growth, are likely 
to decline. 
Outlook for fixed income
Inflation and interest rates are unlikely to be 
a major threat for fixed income markets in 
developed countries in 2012. The key 
concern will be the impact of across-the-
board deleveraging. Governments are 
embarking on austerity measures when 
households and the banking sector are also 
deleveraging. This could hamper economic 
growth and worsen debt-to-GDP ratios. 
Although European politicians finally seem 
to understand the gravity of the situation, 
they need to promote growth if they are to 
avoid further setbacks and potentially 
defaults amongst a number of smaller 
eurozone countries. The disruption in the 
sovereign debt markets fed into corporate 
bond spreads causing them to widen by year 
end, arguably pricing the default rates higher 
than balance sheet health warrants.
For the coming year, continued volatility  
will present opportunities to satisfy various 
risk appetites. 10

Expand absolute return 
product range: 
Henderson and Gartmore 
combined strength
With the acquisition of Gartmore, we have 
significantly strengthened our absolute 
return capability. By combining the two 
fund ranges and launching new absolute 
products, we have seen increased client 
interest and sales. We have been 
successfully managing hedge funds for 
over 10 years and we are widely 
recognised as one of the leading absolute 
return fund firms in Europe. Today, we 
manage approximately £4.6bn of assets 
across the fund range. 
We offer clients an award winning range of 
equity long/short, macro and credit 
strategies within a rigorous institutional 
framework. 
We continue to work closely with our 
clients on existing products and 
developing new products with the aim of 
delivering strong, risk adjusted returns. 
Given our experience, diverse fund range 
and investment expertise, we are well 
placed to participate in the growth of the 
absolute return sector. Both retail and 
institutional investors are expected to 
increase their allocations significantly in 
the absolute return space.
Our distribution team will specifically be 
looking at ways to grow our market share 
in Continental Europe, the US, Asia and 
Japan.
Outlook for property
The UK commercial property market 
showed considerable resilience in 201 1.  
We consider 2012 will be more about 
income and quality than capital return. 
Although the market has lowered its return 
expectations for 2012, demand for the asset 
class remains healthy, given the compelling 
yield profile of commercial property. In 
Europe, investor focus is on liquid markets  
in the strongest economies, most notably  
in Germany. Investors are preferring retail 
property, due to the defensive quality of that 
sector, and investors are targeting Germany 
in search of safe cash flow. However, it is 
likely that Europe’s best performing region 
will continue to be the Nordics and investors 
in Sweden stand to benefit from 
comparatively strong growth expectations 
and perceived safety in northern Europe. 
More opportunistic investors should target 
Spain and Italy, countries most likely to 
survive a potential restructuring of the 
eurozone. In Asia, we expect investment 
activities are likely to be driven by both 
Western and Asian institutional capital 
seeking safe havens and in the US, the 
multi-family sector continues to offer the 
best return outlook.
Regulatory outlook
Around the world, regulatory bodies are 
working through an unprecedented number 
of initiatives to shore up the infrastructure, 
transparency, competence and reputation  
of the financial services industry. In the UK, 
the primary focus remains on protecting 
consumers’ best interests by introducing 
regulation such as the retail distribution 
review, new safeguards for client assets and 
increased governance requirements around 
the life cycle for retail products.
European regulators are concentrating on 
directives aiming to increase market 
transparency, reduce systemic market risk 
and boost consumer protection. The new 
requirements for alternative products are 
still under development. 
US regulations such as Dodd-Frank and the 
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act will also 
bring a number of new obligations for which 
significant preparation will be necessary. 
We believe our business is in good shape  
to meet these challenges through 2012  
and beyond.
Case study
The outlook for the Group
Despite this ongoing market volatility, I 
remain confident about the outlook for 
Henderson. The New Star and Gartmore 
acquisitions have strengthened our 
presence in a number of core areas, notably 
in the UK retail market and absolute return. 
By investing in other areas of our business 
to enhance or add capabilities, together with 
our ongoing efficiency programme and 
variable cost base, we are in a good position 
to deliver value for our shareholders.
Our collaborative way of working ensures 
that we are always focused on producing the 
best product and best service for our clients.

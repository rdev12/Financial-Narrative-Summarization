Chief Executive’s review
Michael Laurier
Much has been achieved in 2014 in the further 
development of our technologies, and product 
range. New IP formulations have been created, and 
major trials following signed agreements continue 
with some of the world’s largest companies.
The commercial objectives have been clearly 
defined within each project and trial. The 
potential value, if only some of these trials 
succeed, is considerable. As a result, we 
have continued to invest resources into 
each project.
Commercially for d
2w, we have seen several 
countries either taking steps to enforce 
legislation or to pass new legislation in favour 
of oxo-biodegradable plastic technology. 
This is an unknown process so it has been 
difficult to predict timing or value, and as 
such, no material financial effect occurred 
in the year under review.
For d
2p, there is strong commercial interest 
to buy our technology, and small orders are 
now starting to be placed. We have continued 
to develop and process new formulations, 
conduct trials, and seek regulatory approvals 
in the countries and products that require 
these approvals. The d
2p development has 
been significant since our formulations have 
expanded beyond polymer master-batch 
into active powders and liquids. 
The Group’s pre-tax loss for the year reduced 
to £0.39 million from £0.78 million in 2013. 
Within these losses, R&D expenditure of 
£0.41 million (2013: £0.55 million) was 
expensed in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Trading results
Group revenue decreased by 12% to £6.35 
million (2013: £7.19 million), but Group gross 
profit margins increased slightly to 49.8% 
from 49.3% in 2013. The contribution from 
gross profit was £3.16 million (2013:  
£3.55 million). 
Recurring administrative expenses 
decreased by 8% to £3.26 million (2013: 
£3.53 million) due to the effect of savings 
implemented during 2013. Non-recurring 
administrative expense of £0.57 million 
were incurred in 2013 but there were no 
non-recurring items in 2014.
Including non-recurring items, the Group 
made an operating loss of £0.27 million in 
2014 compared to an operating loss of 
£0.73 million in 2013. This resulted in loss 
before tax of £0.39 million in 2014 (2013: 
loss £0.78 million). 
Excluding non-recurring items, the Group 
made an EBITDA loss of £0.14 million in 2014 
(2013: loss £0.01 million) with an operating 
loss of £0.27 million (2013: loss £0.16 million).
The Group reports a loss for the year of 
£0.31 million (2013: loss £0.71 million) with 
basic loss per share of 0.23 pence (2013: 
loss per share 0.55 pence). 
Development costs of £0.26 million were 
capitalised in 2014 (2013: £0.12 million), and 
the net book value of capitalised development 
costs at the end of the year amounted  
to £1.13 million. Further development 
expenditure of £0.41 million (2013: £0.55 
million) was expensed directly to the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Capitalised development costs represent 
8% of expenses as detailed above. Within 
the total amount of £1.13 million capitalised 
to date less amortisation and impairment, 
£0.16 million relates to d
2w products which 
have been developed and are being sold, 
while the balance of £0.97 million, relates to 
further environmental plastic applications 
still in development and where we believe 
significant revenues will be generated in the 
foreseeable future. 
The Group’s primary selling currency is the 
US Dollar. The Group self-hedges where 
possible by purchasing in US Dollars and has 
banking facilities in place in order to secure 
rates going forward. As at 31 December 
2014 the Group had a net balance of US 
Dollar assets totalling $0.64 million (2013: 
$0.56 million). 
Segmental analysis
The Group operates two business divisions 
being the Plastics Division (Symphony 
Environmental Limited or “SEL ”) and the

evaluations. As stated above, there have 
been some orders to date, the volumes so 
far being small as expected. The new d 2p 
bag4life, medical products, toys, food and 
non-food containers, and industrial 
packaging applications, are all areas where 
we expect substantial sales activity in the 
medium term. 
I am confident that our strategy will continue 
to work in a world that needs both of our 
main technologies d
2w and d 2p. Plastic 
pollution, health and food protection are, 
and will remain important concerns in 
today’s society.
Our expectations for 2015 and beyond are 
to deliver positive and meaningful growth.

Recycling Technologies division (Symphony 
Recycling Limited or “SRT”). Within SEL 
there are two operating segments; “Plastics 
Sales” which generate and maintain revenues 
relating to plastic additives, masterbatches 
and finished products, and “Plastics R&D” 
which includes all new product development 
and research expenditure.
Plastics Sales, which represent all Group 
sales, generated an EBITDA profit £0.49 
million (2013: £0.78 million). Plastics R&D 
incurred an EBITDA loss of £0.41 million 
(2013: £0.55 million).
SRT has no revenues to date and incurred 
expenditure of £0.22 million in the year, 
resulting in an EBITDA loss of the same 
amount (2013 expenditure and EBITDA loss: 
£0.81 million). As previously stated, the Board’s 
strategy is to commercialise SRT. We have 
reduced costs and are still investigating 
areas where this can be achieved.
Cash flow
The Group used cash of £0.10 million from 
operations (2013: cash used £0.81 million). 
The Group has a £1 million trade finance 
facility with HSBC Bank plc of which £0.15 
million was drawn down as at 31 December 
2014 (2013: £0.58 million). The invoice-finance 
facility increased in line with receivables.  
In addition to these facilities, the Group had 
borrowed a further £0.65 million through 
unsecured loans. These loans were repaid  
in January 2015.
The Group had net cash in the bank of 
£0.59 million at the year-end (2013: £0.03 
million), plus trade receivables of £1.27 
million (2013: £1.16 million) and continues  
to work comfortably within its facilities.
Outlook
A positive trend clearly shows a strategy that 
is working across several key business drivers. 
The first being new legislation in support of 
oxo-biodegradable technology like d
2w. The 
second is the enforcement and widening of 
the scope of existing legislation. The third is 
a gentle domino effect from the legislation 
together with a growing momentum of 
companies that want to upgrade their 
sustainability credentials without supply 
disruption or increased cost.
The Group has seen an increase in d
2w 
activity in the current year where there is 
legislation in place and indications of a 
strengthening position later in the year.
There is a similar positive trend for the 
growing range of d
2p products. Many of  
our global distributors have shown serious 
interest by requesting trials and product

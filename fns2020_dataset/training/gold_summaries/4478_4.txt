“The Group has demonstrated extraordinary resilience during a challenging period for the TV
production industry. The vertically integrated model of DCD and the breadth of our production genres
affords us the versatility to focus on profitable activity whilst minimising our costs in weaker areas. 
To have weathered that tough environment and emerged with a stronger balance sheet, a
geographically expanded group, achieved with minimal capital expenditure, and a growing foothold 
in the lucrative US production market is a testament to the determination of our team.”

2012 has been a good year for Melrose with continued progress from 
our businesses and two important M&A events. 
In June 2012, Melrose sold McKechnie Plastic Components for £30.7 
million. Whilst not in itself sizeable in the context of the Group this 
Company was the last business acquired in the McKechnie/Dynacast 
acquisition made in May 2005 and thus completed the ﬁnal part of our 
“buy, improve, sell” business model for Melrose’s ﬁrst acquisition. This 
acquisition has resulted in our initial equity investment from shareholders 
of £244 million increasing to cash for shareholders of nearly £800 million 
and thus has been highly successful.
Secondly, during 2012 we embarked on the next phase in the “buy” 
element of our strategy by acquiring the Elster Group for an enterprise 
value of £1.8 billion.
We are at the time of writing just over six months into our post-
acquisition programme. Much has been achieved in that relatively short 
time, as is set out in this review and we would draw your attention in 
particular to the following key actions:
 the Gas and Electricity businesses have been reorganised into global 
operations;
 the old Elster Head Ofﬁce has been completely restructured;
 extensive restructuring has been announced at several of the key 
businesses; and
 R&D expenditure has been maintained but has been far better 
targeted on the growth areas of the businesses.
These, and a number of other projects and opportunities, create the 
basis for “improving” Elster and make us conﬁdent that Elster will be a 
better business in the Melrose Group for the beneﬁt of shareholders and 
the employees, customers and suppliers of Elster.

Business performance Governance Financials Shareholder information
We would like to thank our shareholders and lending banks for their 
support in the Elster acquisition. It is not something we take in any way 
for granted. On behalf of our shareholders, I would also like to thank the 
employees of Elster who have welcomed and assisted in the changes 
that have needed to be made.
Elster is a very high quality business with strong market shares in its key 
markets. 2013 will be a year of substantial change and I believe these 
developments will enable Elster to achieve its full future potential in an 
exciting marketplace.
In the rest of the Group, 2012 has been a year of substantial investment. 
We have invested approximately £45 million this year in a number of 
exciting projects. The largest single project was Bridon’s new factory in 
Newcastle upon Tyne, which opened in autumn 2012. We are conﬁdent 
that these investments will position our businesses well for the future 
and will continue to improve their value.
The Energy division had a successful year in 2012. Whilst order intake 
for turbogenerators in 2012 has been lower, the success in growing 
the aftermarket business has been very pleasing. The division has 
also made very good progress in the restructuring of two of the Brush 
subsidiaries, HMA and Hawker Siddeley Switchgear (“HSS”). The 
medium and long term dynamics of the marketplace are likely to be very 
beneﬁcial for Brush.
Marelli has had an outstanding year. The business strategy of increasing 
the size of its generator products and continuing to focus on niche 
markets has succeeded beyond our expectations. Marelli entered the new 
ﬁnancial year with high order books and a very strong market position.
In the Lifting division Bridon has had a good year. Revenue, proﬁt and 
orders have all increased. The new factory at Newcastle upon Tyne has 
been delivered on time and on budget. 
Crosby has had an outstanding year with sales and proﬁts signiﬁcantly 
up on 2011. We are also pleased to have invested to increase its 
forging capacity over the next 12-18 months and to have improved the 
European business by restructuring its operations. Crosby continues 
to grow its worldwide sales and offers exciting opportunities for future 
development.
In the Other Industrial division it is pleasing that the US housing market 
recovery appears to be well underway. This has beneﬁted Truth in 
2012 and positions it well for 2013 and beyond. Harris also performed 
creditably in a difﬁcult market.
OUTLOOK
Conditions in the overall world economy are still very hard to predict with 
any certainty. The US appears to be recovering subject to uncertainties 
about the “Fiscal Cliff” but Europe is still in a very difﬁcult position. 
We are likely to see volatility in the UK caused by rapidly changing 
currency markets. As a result of these factors we are expecting a year 
in which growth may be challenging but our exposure to good markets, 
opportunities for improvement at Elster and the fruits of recent investment 
should still position us well to improve the Group’s performance.

It gives me great pleasure to report on the 
progress Anglo Asian has made during this 
pivotal time in its development as a leading 
gold-copper-silver production company in 
Azerbaijan and indeed Caucasia. In FY 2012, 
we have continued to perform well as a highly 
profitable, low cost mining company, with a 
progressive portfolio of assets that includes 
our flagship Gedabek gold, copper and silver 
mine in western Azerbaijan (‘Gedabek’), 
which produced 50,215 ounces of gold in 
FY 2012, a second development gold project, 
Gosha only 50 km away from Gedabek and a 
third gold exploration/development project, 
Ordubad, located in the Nakhchivan region 
of Azerbaijan.
In terms of financial performance, we 
have enjoyed another period of profitability, 
driven by our gold, silver doré and copper 
concentrate production at Gedabek. 
To this end, I am pleased to report that 
the Company recorded a profit before tax 
of US$28.6 million (2011: US$31.6 million) 
on revenues of US$73.5 million (2011: 
US$83.8 million) and a gross profit of 
US$36.1 million (2011: US$43.0 million).
During the period we have been highly 
active developing and implementing plans 
to ensure the future growth of Anglo Asian. 
These plans have been centred on: increasing 
the production at Gedabek to return gold 
production levels to 60,000 ounces for 
FY 2013, whilst lowering the production 
cash costs, which for the FY 2012 stand at 
US$668 per ounce of gold, to US$450–500 
per ounce; increasing the life of mine of 
Gedabek through defined exploration and 
development programmes to increase 
the reserve and resource base, which 
currently stands at 744,038 ounces and 
1,276,422 ounces of gold respectively; and 
establishing a secondary mining project, 
Gosha, which we are currently developing 
to increase our production by the end of 
2014 to 80,000 to 90,000 ounces of gold. 
I believe the Anglo Asian team has delivered 
on numerous key objectives during 2012 
with respect to these initiatives and it has 
laid the foundations for a transformational 
year for the Company in 2013 and beyond.
Gedabek, which is located in western 
Azerbaijan on the Tethyan Tectonic Belt, 
one of the world’s significant copper and 
gold bearing belts, is currently an open 
pit, heap leach operation. In terms of gold 
and silver production for the reporting 
period, we were pleased to report figures 
in line with management’s expectations 
of 50,215 ounces of gold and 20,133 ounces 
of silver in doré from the heap leach 
processing. From this we made gold 
sales of 42,557 ounces at an average 
price of US$1,666 per ounce and silver sales 
of 16,342 ounces at an average price of 
US$32 per ounce. The difference between 
sales and production is for two reasons. 
Firstly the Government of Azerbaijan 
takes title to 12.75% of all metals produced, 
according to the Product Sharing Agreement 
in place on Anglo Asian’s operating licences 
(as outlined later in this statement), and 
secondly there is a time lag from production 
to sales. In terms of production in FY 2013, 
Q1 2013 gold production for the three months 
ending 31 March totalled 8,585 ounces 
with gold sales of 8,725 ounces at an 
average price of US$1,638 per ounce.
Importantly we also produce copper in 
the form of a precipitated copper sulphide 
concentrate by-product, which also contains 
silver and a small amount of gold, from 
our Sulphidisation, Acidification, Recycling 
and Thickening (‘SART’) plant at Gedabek. 
Interestingly this plant is one of the largest 
of its kind to be used on a commercial basis. 
Production from the plant for FY 2012 totalled 
502 tonnes of copper, 98,158 ounces of 
silver and 86 ounces of gold. Income from 
04 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2012 sales of this copper concentrate totalled 
US$2.1 million in FY 2012. Towards the 
end of 2012, we entered into a sales 
contract with Glencore International plc 
(‘Glencore’) for the sale of 2,500 wet 
metric tonnes (‘WMT’) and 550 dry metric 
tonnes of copper concentrate and we also 
sent an additional trial shipment of 200 WMT 
of copper concentrate to Seagate Minerals 
and Metals Inc. At the end of 2012 stocks 
were 2,900 WMT. These sales will see our 
copper concentrate product continuing to 
add to our bottom line and in turn increasing 
our profitability for FY 2013. In Q1 2013 
production from SART totalled 93 tonnes 
of copper, 9,875 ounces of silver and 
16 ounces of gold and we had stockpiles of 
2,535 WMT of copper concentrate product. 
We hope to arrange further sales contracts 
for copper concentrate in 2013 and look 
forward to providing future updates on this.
As mentioned, a key focus of 2012 for the 
Company was the review of Gedabek’s 
operations with a view to implementing 
initiatives and development plans to improve 
the production profile of the mine both in 
the near-term, and increasing the life of 
mine to ensure its future production 
success. As highlighted, gold production 
for FY 2012 was 50,215 ounces, which was 
in line with management’s expectations, 
but this was a drop from the previous 
year’s production levels of 57,068 ounces 
in 2011. This decrease in production was 
anticipated in the 2012 Company mine 
plan, which took into consideration the 
reducing gold grade in the ore-body and 
the need for longer leaching cycles in the 
existing heap leaching process.
Having identified the key factors, the 
Company assessed different processing 
routes to improve the recovery of gold 
from the ore, over that achieved by the 
conventional heap leach process currently 
in use, in order to maximise the economic 
return. In May 2012, following a pre-feasibility 
study carried out by mining consultants, 
Arcadis Chile Limited, we announced our 
intention to construct an agitation leaching 
plant at Gedabek, which is expected to both 
increase gold production and recovery and 
also reduce cash operating costs per ounce. 
Construction of the new agitation leaching 
plant, which had a forecast CAPEX of 
US$52 million, began in August last year 
and the plant is now in the process of full 
scale commissioning and is expected to 
come in US$7 million under budget. The 
new plant will initially treat 100 tonnes of 
ore per hour and it will increase both gold 
oxide and sulphide recovery to 85% and 
69% respectively. This is expected to positively 
impact gold production for the second half 
of 2013 to allow us to meet our 60,000 ounce 
production target (which represents a 20% 
increase over FY 2012). Gold production 
thereafter will improve on an on-going basis 
and the lower grade ore will continue to be 
heap leached.
In addition to improving processing 
efficiencies at Gedabek, we also continue 
to explore the greater Gedabek area with 
the aim of delineating further resources 
and reserves to increase the life of mine 
of the operation. In April 2012 we were 
delighted to announce a JORC compliant 
resource upgrade to 48,138,979 tonnes 
at 0.825 g/t gold for 1,276,422 ounces 
of gold in the Measured and Indicated 
categories. In addition, we also announced 
a maiden JORC compliant ore reserve 
report, which significantly exceeded our 
previous internal estimate of recoverable 
ounces of gold at Gedabek. A total mineable 
reserve of 20,312,879 tonnes at 1.139 g/t gold 
for 744,038 ounce, 0.293% copper for 
59,479 tonnes and 9.456 g/t silver for 
6,175,531 ounces as at 30 December 2011 
was calculated, of which 532,607 ounces 
of gold are recoverable, a significant increase 
over the previous internal estimate of 
311,000 ounces announced in 2007, prior 
to the construction of the Gedabek mine. 
Importantly, in addition to the 532,607 ounces 
of recoverable gold in the ground, we have 
an estimated 90,000 ounces of gold that 
was not recovered by the heap leach 
process, in the spent ore that is currently 
stacked on the leach pads. This ore will 
be reprocessed through the new agitation 
leach plant to recover the major part of 
this ‘lost’ gold and further boost production 
flow for FY 2013/4.
Since the announcement of our maiden 
reserve, an extensive 28,872 metre drilling 
programme has been completed, targeting 
an extension of the existing mine at Gedabek 
with the aim of further increasing the mineral 
resources and reserves as part of our 
on-going exploration and development 
programme. Early indications from the 
recent drilling indicates the potential to 
continue increasing the size of the Gedabek 
deposit in Q2 2013, and we look forward to 
updating the market on these results in 
due course.
Looking ahead, the Company is committed 
to establishing a second mining operation 
in Azerbaijan. As mentioned, Gosha is located 
50 km away from Gedabek and work is 
currently under way to develop a small, 
high-grade, underground gold mine, which is 
expected to produce circa 15-20,000 ounces 
of gold per annum. Mining development 
at Gosha is targeted to begin in H2 2013 
with the intention being to start production 
in 2014. Due to the close proximity of Gosha 
and Gedabek, it is intended that gold ore 
produced at Gosha will be sent by truck 
to Gedabek for processing through the 
new agitation leach plant. The input of ore 
from Gosha, in addition to the increased 
recoveries from the Gedabek ore achieved 
in the new plant, is expected to see Anglo 
Asian’s total gold production rising to 
between 80,000 and 90,000 ounces by the 
end of 2014, subject to both the Gosha 
mine and the Gedabek Agitation Leaching 
Plant operating as expected. 
Further exploration works at our Ordubad 
Contract Area, located in the Nakhchivan 
region of Azerbaijan, resulted in the issuance 
of a notice of discovery for two gold deposits, 
Piyazbashi and Agyurt. The Company will 
continue the exploration works to seek 
more mineral potential in the area.
In terms of our corporate activity for the 
period, we continue to work closely with 
the Government of Azerbaijan. As noted 
above, we have a Production Sharing 
Agreement in place with the Government 
of Azerbaijan, which is based on the 
established Azeri oil industry model. 
Up until the time we have recovered all 
of our carried-forward, unrecovered costs, 
the Government of Azerbaijan effectively 
takes 12.75% of commercial products of 
any mine we bring into production, with 
Anglo Asian taking 87.25%. We expect to 
continue retaining 87.25% of the commercial 
products until at least the end of 2014 based 
on costs incurred to date and with the 
construction of the agitation leaching plant.
In addition, we have strong relations with 
the International Bank of Azerbaijan, which 
is majority owned by the Government of 
Azerbaijan, and we have various financing 
agreements in place with the bank. As at 
31 December 2012, the Company’s net 
debt totalled US$28.3 million (2011: 
US$3.2 million) after taking into account cash 
of US$2.4 million (2011: US$9.9 million). 
This increase in net debt was due to an 
additional loan agreement undertaken with 
the IBA by the Company to finance the 
new agitation leaching plant at Gedabek, 
which as mentioned had an estimated 
CAPEX of US$52 million and an expected 
actual cost of US$45 million. In May 2012, 
the IBA provided a US$7.5 million loan and 
agreed a further US$10.5 million loan with 
a letter of intent stating that, subject to 
internal consideration and approval, it would 
provide up to an additional US$42 million 
to the Company for the construction of the 
new agitation leaching plant. Including the 
US$18 million already agreed in May 2012, 
this brought the total funding available to 
the Company by the IBA to US$60 million.

Overview
Corporate governance
Financial statements The loans agreed during 2012 have an annual 
interest rate of 12% and can be drawn 
down in tranches of up to US$1,500,000. 
Repayment will be within 36 months in 
equal quarterly instalments starting two 
years from the date that each tranche of 
funds is drawn down. There is no penalty 
for early repayment. 
As at 31 March 2013, the total funds drawn 
down from the IBA for the Agitation Leaching 
Plant from the $60 million facility were 
US$40.1 million. The remaining amount 
outstanding of the first loan with the IBA 
was US$0.8 million and cash in the bank 
was US$3.4 million. Net debt, being interest 
bearing loans and borrowings less cash 
and cash equivalents, therefore stood at 
US$37.5 million at 31 March 2013.
As a Company we are committed to 
maintaining high health, safety, social and 
environmental standards. We have a Health, 
Safety, Environment and Technology 
Committee (‘HSET’) established at Board 
level, which is under the chairmanship 
of Professor John Monhemius, one of our 
Non-executive Directors. This committee 
has the responsibility to oversee all aspects 
of the HSET of the Company and to make 
recommendations to the Board. Operational 
control of HSE is the responsibility of our 
Sustainability Manager, Mr Angel Vega, who 
has a team of HSE officers to police and 
encourage all safety aspects of day-to-day 
working practices on the mine.
During 2012 there were no serious work 
related injuries or reportable environmental 
incidents, and numerous safety and 
environmental initiatives were undertaken. 
We have approximately 566 personnel 
working in the Company. We achieved a 
landmark in our safety-at-work record by 
surpassing for the first time one million 
man-hours worked without a Lost Time 
Incident (LTI). Despite this achievement 
we recognise that mining is a hazardous 
environment and we will continue to strive 
for further improvements. In May 2012, 
we introduced a penalty scheme whereby 
infringements of safety regulations or codes 
of practice are penalised by fines that are 
deducted from offenders’ wages. The scheme 
applies equally to Company employees 
and to contractors working on site.
Since becoming signatories to the 
International Cyanide Management Code 
in 2010, we have been working towards 
achieving the required safety standards 
in our working practices for the handling 
and management of cyanide, which is the 
principal chemical used for the leaching of 
gold ores. This has involved the preparation 
and translation of documentation and 
training courses for employees. We have 
appointed external auditors, who will 
assess our performance under the auspices 
of the International Cyanide Management 
Institute (‘ICMI’). In September 2012, 
the auditor-carried out a pre-audit gap 
analysis, which highlighted areas that 
require further attention to achieve the 
required standards. The full audit will 
take place shortly, after which we expect 
to be granted full certification by the ICMI.
On the environmental side, we have 
undertaken a full Environmental and 
Social Assessment (‘ESA’) of our operations 
during this year. We appointed AMEC, a 
leading international engineering consultancy 
(http://www.amec.com), to perform this 
work for us. The ESA was a major exercise 
carried out over several months by a team 
of specialists from AMEC. We received 
their final report in December 2012, which 
comprised a main volume and 12 substantial 
appendices, and the task for the coming 
year is to incorporate the consultants’ 
recommendations into our working 
practices and to develop a comprehensive 
environmental management plan for the 
life of the mine.
Looking at Anglo Asian in the wider market 
context, despite the economic turmoil in 
the market that all resource companies 
are facing at present, I remain positive 
about the longer term fundamentals for 
gold mining companies and indeed Anglo 
Asian. Gold has enjoyed a spectacular 
bull market over the past 13 years, growing 
at a compound annual growth rate of 
approximately 13% since the low gold 
price circa US$278 in 1999. In spite of 
recent gold pricing developments, which 
have seen gold price levels drop to circa 
US$1,350, I believe that there remains a 
convincing case for sustainable upside in 
the gold price based on gold as a hedge 
against inflation/currency depreciation, 
a ‘safe haven’ and store of value, and with 
continued robust physical demand from 
China and India projected. Moreover, 
similar corrections both mid-2006 and 
again in late-2008 when the gold price 
was hit, down more than 25% and 33% 
respectively, build a positive case for this 
recent drop being a ‘correction’ rather than 
a bearish gold market. At current levels 
gold equities do not seem to reflect current 
gold prices and mining companies are at 
their cheapest level in decades. I consider 
that gold equities, especially Anglo Asian, 
as a low cost producer still represent a 
compelling investment opportunity.
In conclusion, the past year has been one 
of significant progress for Anglo Asian on 
many fronts. We are delighted to report a 
strong financial performance with a profit 
Chairman’s statement continued
before tax of US$28.6 million. This is thanks 
to reliable gold production from Gedabek, 
which has achieved our production target 
for FY 2012 by producing 50,215 ounces 
of gold and also 502 tonnes of copper 
concentrate for the year. 
Looking ahead to 2013, we are committed 
to increasing Gedabek’s gold production 
and we are in the final stages of constructing 
a new Agitation Leaching Plant, estimated 
to be US$7 million under budget at 
US$45 million, which will improve 
production from the mine substantially 
once commissioned and enable us to 
achieve FY 2013 production of 60,000 ounces. 
In terms of our copper production, we 
produced 93 tonnes of copper in Q1 2013 
and expect to produce 700 tonnes by 
year-end in line with the 2013 production 
plan. Importantly we have signed a sales 
agreement with Glencore International in 
Q4 2012, which will continue to positively 
impact our bottom line in FY 2013 when 
copper sales are realised. 
Furthermore, we remain dedicated to 
establishing our second mining project in 
Azerbaijan, Gosha, with a view to production 
in 2014, which will be another significant 
step for Anglo Asian as we look to ramp 
up our annual gold production output to 
80,000–90,000 ounces by the end of 2014.
I believe that this development strategy, 
coupled with our low gold production 
cost forecasts for FY 2013, highlights 
our commitment to achieving significant 
growth and increasing value over the 
coming year. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
our Anglo Asian employees, partners, the 
Government of Azerbaijan, the IBA, advisers, 
fellow Directors and shareholders for their 
continued support as we continue to build 
ourselves into a leading gold, copper, 
silver mid-tier production company in 
Azerbaijan and Caucasia.

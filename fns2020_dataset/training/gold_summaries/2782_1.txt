 12 Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
CEO and Business Review
This year has seen Cambrian successfully launch the process
of transforming into an operating mining Group.
Subsidiary and associate operations all demonstrated progress in
terms of production growth. During the year overall coal sales
increased by 84% from 2,253,000 tonnes to 4,140,000 tonnes.
Antimony – gold concentrate production increased by 168%
from 1,033 tonnes to 2,772 tonnes.
T aking into account our share of associate results the Group’s
continuing operations made a £29.2 million profit before
exceptional derivative revaluations and tax and an after tax loss
of £0.5 million. A more detailed analysis is set out on pages 19 to
22 of the Financial Review.
The acquisition of Coal International Plc although completed on
1 August 2008 represented one of the key steps for Cambrian
in consolidating the status of the Group as a mining operator.
This acquisition resulted in the West Virginian properties
becoming 100% owned by Cambrian as well as increasing our
direct holding of Energybuild Group Plc an anthracite coal
producer in South Wales, from 27.50% to 50.6%.
The other key transaction during the year was the sale of Falls
Mountain Coal Inc (‘FC’) to Western Canadian Coal Corp.
As a result of this transaction, Cambrian’s holding in WCCC is
42.96% (34.4% fully diluted) as at 30 June 2008.
Other steps relating to Cambrian’s focus on core assets were
the disposal, in September 2007, of its interest in Asian Mineral
Resources generating proceeds of £10.7 million and Vulcan
Resources, in December 2007 and May 2008, generating
proceeds of £2.0 million.
During the year as well as continuing to grow our operations,
we also embarked on a strategic change programme to
transform the Company into an operating mining group.
Mark Burridge
Chief Executive Officer Cambrian Mining Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 13
This corporate activity has been running in parallel with
developing the Company’s systems, controls and governance.
The Corporate Governance statement appears on pages 28 to
29. Alongside this, significant resource has been devoted to
improving the financial reporting systems this year to allow
Cambrian to report more effectively to its shareholders and
between the operations and corporate functions. On 1 August
2008, Braam Jonker joined the Cambrian team as full-time
Chief Financial Officer. He will continue to focus on these
projects and further develop Cambrian’s financial strategy.
While, like all companies in the sector, Cambrian’s fortunes are
impacted by changing macro-economic conditions, the Group
is well positioned to increase production in the 2009 Financial
Year. We have coal contracts in place that should mean we realise
higher revenues than last year as well as favourable margins.
Also, recent currency movements, if sustained, will also work
to our advantage as should reduced cost inflation due to low oil
and steel prices. Importantly, we have significant operating
flexibility in terms of being able to adjust our capital programmes,
production levels and product mix to adapt to changes in the
economic environment. Management are currently analysing a
number of scenarios to ensure that we can respond effectively to
changing conditions.
Next year, as well as optimising value from existing opportunities
and completing the key steps in our strategic change programme,
we will also examine selective opportunities for external growth.

Gauley Eagle, West Virginia, USA
Underground and Surface
The 17,000 acres Gauley Eagle property produces thermal and
metallurgical coal from the underground Silo Mains mine and
the Crooked Run surface mine. Coal is washed at the Gauley
Eagle coal preparation plant and is shipped via truck, barge and
rail to utility and industrial clients throughout the east and
south eastern United States.
Gauley Eagle surface and underground activities produce both
metallurgical and thermal coal. In the year to 30 June 2008,
120,000 tons of metallurgical coal were produced. Marketable
thermal coal production for the year to June 2008 totalled
585,000 tons, including 44,800 tons of third-party coal
washed and sold by Atlantic Leaseco. This production is sold
under a range of short and medium term contracts with selling
prices increasing throughout the year as older fixed-price
contracts have expired and been replaced by new contracts
reflecting higher market prices.
Coal production in the financial year to 30 June 2009 will
migrate from the current Silo Mains underground and Crooked
Run surface operations to new reserve blocks as resources
in the current project areas are depleted. Permitting is
substantially completed and construction activities commenced
to establish the new Black Pearl underground mine, which will
utilise the underground equipment currently in use at Silo
Mains. Production will be from the same Kittanning
C Seam as Silo Mains which has found strong acceptance in
both thermal and metallurgical markets.
Final permitting to establish the Lower Muddlety surface mine
at Gauley Eagle is near completion. The existing spread of
surface equipment operating the Crooked Run mine will transfer
to the Lower Muddlety project upon completion of mining at
Crooked Run. As the project is developed, a second surface
mining spread will be established. Production will come from
the Kittanning C, Widen and Mearns seams and will be sold
to both the thermal and metallurgical markets.
Maple Coal, West Virginia, USA
Surface
The Maple Coal property contains significant thermal coal
reserves, accessible with surface mining methods. In response
to strengthening thermal coal prices early in 2008, efforts
commenced to establish the Sycamore South surface mine at
Maple. The first spread of surface equipment was installed in
June 2008, with first production sold in July. A second spread
of equipment is currently being mobilised and will bring surface
production to approximately 60,000 tons per month by
calendar year end 2008.
CEO and Business Review continued
Group Health, Safety and Environment
Cambrian is committed to ensuring a safe working environment
is provided in all aspects of operations within the Group’s
structure. The safety policy and procedures of our operating
associate companies are achieving commendable results
in safety.
A notable achievement this year is the award of the ‘Joseph A.
Holmes Safety Association Award’ by the Governor of the State
of West Virginia to the Gauley Eagle Mine for its impressive
performance in safety. The West Virginian operations reported
four lost time injuries across all sites during the year. The Non-
Fatal Days Lost (‘NFDL’) rate (calculated as the rate of lost time
injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked) for the total man-
hours worked in the six-month period ended 30 June 2008 was
3.40, which is just above the NFDL national average of 3.25 for
the corresponding period. Since the year end our West Virginian
operations have received two further safety awards
WCCC continued to prove its excellence in safety when the
Burnt River property was awarded the ‘John T. Ryan Safety
Award’, in recognition of being one of the safest coal mining
operations in Canada. There have been no lost time accidents
recorded from the beginning of the project. WCCC recorded
three lost time injuries over the financial year, combining all
mining and construction activities at the Wolverine group
of mines and the Willow Creek property.
Our gold and antimony mining operation in Australia is
committed to safety and has implemented safety policy and
procedures to ensure the safe operation of the mine and
processing plant. AGD recorded four lost time incidents for this
financial year. Although this was an improvement on the five
lost time incidents recorded for the same period the previous
year, we believe we can improve on AGD’s safety record.
The Group is committed to mining in an environmentally safe
and sustainable way. We identify and implement best practice
to reduce pollution, comply with environmental legislation
and we maintain management systems to a high standard to
ensure that environmental incidents are limited in number
and dealt with effectively and quickly if they occur.
Group Employment
The Group has expanded over the course of the year both
through organic growth and acquisitions. As at 30 September
2008, there were 246 employees in West Virginia, 77*
in Australia, 198 in Wales, over 600* in Canada and 14
employees in the corporate head office in London.
The Group values the contribution of all of its employees and
strives to maintain a competitive remuneration structure at
each operation as well as maintaining high levels of safety
and training for each individual.

Maple Coal, West Virginia, USA
Underground
The 2008 Financial Year has focused on expanding the
production base to take best advantage of the market for
metallurgical coal. In early 2008 a second continuous mine unit
was established in the Eagle Seam and a third unit is currently
being brought into production. Production ramped up
throughout the year despite the requirement to perform
substantial underground construction and remediation to old
works. This mine produced 282,000 marketable tons in the
year to 30 June 2008. All of Maple’s production was sold into
the domestic and international metallurgical coal market at an
average price of $88 per ton range for older contracts to
prices at a highest price of $195 per ton for current business.
With the completion of underground construction providing
sufficient working space for the third continuous miner unit,
underground production capacity is expected to ramp-up to
approximately 900,000 tons per year. Work to expand the
capacity of the Katie preparation plant to handle the increased
production is near completion.

Nant y Mynydd, South Wales, UK
Surface
Overall opencast activities have produced 70,000 tonnes of
thermal coal in the year at an average selling price of £65 per
tonne. The Nant y Mynydd site was a higher ratio coal site than
anticipated resulting in operational inefficiencies. A delay to
commencement of sandstone activities in the year resulted in
reduced revenue from operations and increased costs, as the
coal seam beneath would have been produced at marginal cost.
Planning consent was received for a new site with lower coaling
ratios in November 2007 and production commenced in
February 2008 at an average of 2,000 tonnes per week.
Sandstone operations are now expected to commence in the
year ending 30 June 2009.
Opencast activities will continue, but will become less
important to Energybuild as production increases from the
drift mine. Production is estimated at approximately 100,000
tonnes from opencast operations in the 2009 financial year
from the Nant y Mynydd, Forest Quarry and continuity sites.
Although this is dependent upon planning consents, Energybuild
management are confident these will be obtained, due to
their positive record on restoration and rehabilitation of old
derelict sites.
Aberpergwm, South Wales, UK
Underground
Energybuild has successfully accessed the anthracite reserves
under its control in the year and an increase in production to
265,000 tonnes of clean coal in the year to 30 June 2009 is
expected. Further production increases are expected with
440,000 tonnes and 750,000 tonnes of clean coal targeted for
the years to 30 June 2010 and 2011 respectively.
Energybuild produced approximately 30,000 tonnes of clean
thermal coal from the 18ft seam in the period to 30 June 2008
at an operating cost of £73 per tonne. Of that tonnage 13,600

the balance in inventory at 30 June 2008. Recovering the old
British Coal intake and return drifts across the Pentreclwydau
fault into the 18ft seam was achieved in September 2007 – on
time and within budget. In February 2008 the air circuit in the
seam was completed and mining started in March 2008.
A significant amount of work has taken place on the mine
surface and equipment procurement in order to cater for the
increased production forecast over the next two years.
An important stage of the development of the mine will be
driving the new drift which received full planning consent
in July 2008. This drift will increase the ventilation capacity
of the mine and assist in reducing production costs, due to
the efficiencies it will bring in terms of coal clearance, material
handling and conveying men to production areas faster.
Western Canadian Coal Corporation
See table above
Total metallurgical coal production at Wolverine and Brule
during the year ended 30 June 2008 was 2,823,000 tonnes.
Coal sales for the corresponding period were 2,997,000
tonnes with an average price achieved of US$108 per tonne.
Wolverine, British Columbia, Canada
Surface
The Perry Creek property started production in 2006. The last
remaining major initial capital project item, the mine equipment
maintenance services (shop and warehouse) complex, was
occupied in March 2008. In June 2008 WCCC obtained a Mine
Permit allowing for coal production from the Wolverine mine
of 3,000,000 tonnes per annum, utilising the design capacity
of the preparation plant.
Shipments continued to major steel mills in Asia and Europe.
Testing of coal samples at the loading port from these vessels
indicates that coal quality from Wolverine continues to meet
or exceed the high expectations identified during pre-
production tests.
Clean coal production to 30 June 2008 has averaged 156,600
tonnes per month, which is below the targeted production of
175,000 tonnes per month. Productivity has been constrained
by the shortage of skilled operators and tradesmen. WCCC
continues to address the impact of skilled labour shortages
CEO and Business Review continued
(endemic to the industry and to north eastern British Columbia),
including intensive recruiting efforts and training programmes.
WCCC believes that these issues can be overcome and
improvements in production are being seen, with the
expectation that production levels will meet targets through to
year ending 31 March 2009.
No significant issues have arisen with respect to coal quality and
the plant processing capabilities have exceeded expectations.
For the year ending 31 March 2009, coal production from
the Wolverine mine has been fully committed and WCCC is
projecting coal shipments of approximately 2,000,000 tonnes
of coal from the Wolverine mine, comprising 1,800,000 tonnes
of coking coal and 200,000 tonnes of mid-volatile PCI coal.
Brule (Burnt River), British Columbia, Canada
Surface
The Brule mine produces Ultra Low Volatile Pulverised Coal
Injection (‘ULV-PCI’) coal for export, primarily to Korea. ULV-
PCI coal can replace up to 30% of the coke feed in the blast
furnace, resulting in significantly reduced raw material costs
for steel makers. 1,090,000 tonnes of ULV-PCI coal from the
Brule mine was sold in the year 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008.
Initial mining at Brule is being conducted with no coal processing
beyond crushing, and planned production of approximately
1,200,000 tonnes per annum. This plan requires minimal
capital investment and involves mining high quality coal from
low strip ratio portions of the Brule deposit.
The 2005 feasibility study for Brule demonstrated that
additional initial capital for a new wash plant, site infrastructure,
coal-haul route and new load-out of C$144 million was
required, as well as C$70 million worth of additional mining
equipment in order to increase annual production to 2,000,000
tonnes. Due to the FMC acquisition, WCCC has access to an
existing wash plant and rail load-out facility, which will result in
a reduction of about C$70 million in capital costs included in the
original estimate. Refurbishment and upgrading of the
Willow Creek wash plant has begun. Design and permitting
work is under way on road upgrading, with construction
planned during calendar year 2009 to allow current Brule
production to be diverted from the Bullmoose rail load-out to
the closer Willow Creek load-out facility. Application has been
made to the Environmental Assessment Office to amend the
Environmental Assessment (‘EA’) certificate to allow coal haul
via highway to Willow Creek as an interim measure.

All gold and antimony concentrates produced were sold
under contract to the Hunan Zhongnan Tungsten and Trading
Company, an antimony smelting company in China. Antimony
prices averaged A$6,570 per tonne and the gold price
averaged A$934.40 per ounce.
The Augusta drilling campaign was successful. The results
indicate the Augusta vein system extends north of the known
mineralisation and continues at depths below the previously
known depth. Drilling also intercepted a previously-unknown
mineralised structure in the hanging wall of the W lode.
A revised mineral resource estimate based on the drilling and
underground sampling data has been prepared by Fredericksen
Geological Solutions as at 30 June 2008 and suggests there are
sufficient resources to support a minimum five year mine life
for the Augusta deposit at the targeted mine production rate
of 65,000 tonnes of ore annually. The revised estimate is
331,000 tonnes with an average content of 11.4g gold per
tonne and antimony of 6.1%.
Exploration of the Brunswick deposit was suspended while
the potential of Augusta was assessed. Data from the previous
year’s drilling programme on the Brunswick deposit was
utilised by AMC Consultants to prepare a resource estimate.
This estimate is 157,100 tonnes with an average content
of 7.1g gold per tonne and antimony of 3.8%.
Due to drilling success, AGD is currently analysing plans to
extend the mining operations down to 15 level (152 metres
below the surface) versus the previously planned 10 level.
Depending on the outcome of this study we will make some
decisions regarding the future of AGD.
Energy and Resources Technology
Our Strategic Review identified that Xtract has a promising
future and that it should create significant value for its
shareholders, but we also recognise that Xtract’s structure and
focus on developing early-stage energy assets is no longer
compatible with our strategic direction as an operating Group. It
was therefore decided to dividend a significant portion of the
holding directly to our shareholders. Whilst we expected this to
happen prior to December 2008, the current market turmoil and
our desire to return real value to our shareholders has resulted in
Cambrian’s sale of FMC to WCCC should allow WCCC to
enhance its ULV-PCI coal production through a combination of
cost savings at Brule and increased metallurgical coal
production at Willow Creek.
AGD Mining
See table above
Costerfield, Australia
Gold and antimony mine
AGD continued development of its Costerfield
gold and antimony mine and treatment plant in central
Victoria, Australia. Development of the operations was
financed with proceeds from the sales of shareholdings in
Asian Mineral Resources and Vulcan Resources.
The Augusta mine continued to advance toward its
annual planned production rate of 65,000 tonnes of gold and
antimony ore. Prices for both metals firmed during the year but
the extent of the benefit for AGD was moderated by an
increase in the value of the Australian dollar against the US
dollar, in which the metals are priced. Subsequent to the year
end the Australian dollar has weakened and therefore the
results for AGD have improved.
The mine experienced a series of setbacks to the production
schedule during the year including more difficult ground
conditions in the upper level of the mine, equipment shortages
and a lack of skilled personnel. These issues began to be
addressed in the course of the year and a number of measures
were implemented, including increased investment in mine
equipment and training, and AGD taking over direct
management of the mining operations from its mine contractor.
As a result of these changes, production rates showed a gradual
improvement over the year and this has continued with
production increasing from 7,750 tonnes in the first quarter
to September 2007 to 15,254 tonnes in the quarter ending
June 2008.
This year further improvements were made to the treatment
plant. Recovery of antimony metal in concentrate improved
to 82% while recovery of gold in concentrate and from the
gravity section of the plant rose to 79% compared with
antimony recovery of 69% and gold recovery of 52% during
the previous year.

IPO positions in the energy and related sectors. In July 2008,
Wasabi made an investment in Xtract through the purchase of
36.5 million shares and an equivalent numberof options from
Cambrian. Xtract currently holds 153 million shares in Wasabi,
representing approximately 19.4% of the issued capital.
Group Outlook
Cambrian expects to increase production and revenues
in the 2009 financial year.
In the current environment of financial and economic
uncertainty, there are a number of factors that may impact
on the business of the Group. However, Cambrian is well
positioned to deal with this environment from an operating
standpoint. While it appears likely that the price of coal may
decline on a spot basis, Cambrian will actually generate higher
revenues per tonne in the 2009 financial year than in 2008
due to higher price contracts being in place and increased
proportion of metallurgical coal. In West Virginia, the coal
contracts we have in place are expected to support our
ability to generate an operating cash margin.
The Group has significant flexibility in its operating plans to be
able to adjust production levels and product mix to respond to a
variety of economic scenarios, and management are actively
considering different plans to ensure that operating performance
is optimised. This flexibility also provides us with a competitive
advantage in terms of responding positively to any potential
regulatory changes in the USA regarding surface mining.
In general, while commodity prices are turning down, prices of
coal, gold and antimony, Cambrian’s key products, are currently
performing better than other commodities. The drop in oil
and steel prices, while reflective of the challenges that face
the industry in general, should result in material operating
cost reductions.
Cambrian’s operating margins will also benefit from the
recent strength in the US dollar against the Canadian, Australian
and British currencies. Due to exchange rate fluctuations
profit generated in US Dollars from the West Virginian Coal
Operations will result in increased Sterling results. Sales from
the Canadian and Australian operations are also denominated
in US dollars with underlying operating cost exposures in
currencies that have weakened significantly.
a delay. It is still the intention of the Company to dividend the
majority of its holding to shareholders in the near future.
MEO
Xtract has a 13.9% shareholding in MEO, a company focused
on developing gas-to-liquids (‘GTL’) projects in the Timor Sea,
on an area of shallow water known as Tassie Shoal, located
approximately 275km northwest of Darwin, Australia. MEO has
secured Australian Government environmental approvals which
are valid until 2052.
Elko
In September 2007, Xtract provided Elko Energy with
US$2 million of development equity through a private
placement. Elko’s exploration strategy aims to realise the
potential of its highly significant gas and oil assets in the Danish
and Dutch North Sea to maximise long term shareholder value.
In December 2007 another private placement took place in
which Xtract contributed a further US$6 million, maintaining its
ownership interest at 35.2% of the issued capital of Elko.
Elko operates the largest exploration licence in Denmark,
with an off-shore area of 1.3 million acres. The licence is held
80% by Elko and 20% by a Danish government entity. Elko
is committed to drilling at least one well on its Danish Licence,
with the addition of further wells as funding is secured. Elko
plans to farm out part of its 80% interest before moving ahead
with drilling the first exploratory well, which is projected to
cost approximately US$25 million. The development of the
very significant gas reserves on the Dutch blocks, clearly
identified through drilling, testing and extensive 3D seismic
coverage, remains Elko’s priority project.
Oil Shale
Through its wholly owned Australian subsidiary, Xtract is
pursuing a twin-track strategy to build its oil shale resource
base and to develop a proprietary oil shale technology
directed towards improving economic and environmental
performance compared with traditional technologies. The
mining and production of refinery feed-stock crude oil from
oil shale represents a potentially significant and valuable
source of hydrocarbon to help satisfy future international
energy demands.
Other Interests
Through its subsidiary companies, Xtract continues its oil and gas
exploration, development and production programmes in the
Kyrgyz Republic. On 12 November 2008, Xtract announced that
it had completed the farm-in agreement with Santos International
Holdings Pty Ltd in relation to its subsidiary Zhibek Resources Ltd.
During the period under review, Wasabi Energy Ltd (“Wasabi”)

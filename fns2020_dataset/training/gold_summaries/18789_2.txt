1.  EBITDA is a non-statutory measure often used by 
investors as a proxy for cash and to calculate the value of 
a business. The Company uses adjusted EBITDA (Earnings 
before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortisation, share of 
joint venture results, equity fundraising costs and IFRS2 
share-based payment charges) as an indicator of trading 
profitability and a proxy for operating cashflow, before any 
cash movements relating to investment, tax, funding and 
changes in working capital. It is not an IFRS measure, and is 
not therefore shown in the Group income statement.
2.  Net cash is defined as cash and cash equivalents and 
short-term deposits less debt.

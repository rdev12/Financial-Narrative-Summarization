 04 Melrose PLC Annual Report 2010 
Chairman’s 
statement
I am pleased to report Melrose’s eighth set of annual results 
since flotation in 2003. Over this period Melrose’s market 
capitalisation has grown from £13 million at flotation to  
£1.5 billion as at the date of this report. This has been achieved 
with a net investment
(1)
 by our shareholders of c£450 million and 
so at the current share price over £1 billion of shareholder value 
has been created since flotation.
Results for the Group
These accounts report the results for the Group for the year  
to 31 December 2010 and comparatives for the previous year. 
Revenue for the year was £1,379.5 million (2009: £1,298.5 million). 
Headline profit before tax (before exceptional costs, exceptional 
income and intangible asset amortisation) was £170.8 million 
(2009: £118.6 million) and headline basic earnings per share 
were 25.4p (2009: 16.6p). Profit before tax was £155.3 million 
(2009: £82.0 million) and the basic earnings per share were 
28.4p (2009: 11.0p).
Further explanation of these results is provided in the Finance 
Director’s review.
Dividends
The Board intends to propose a final dividend of 7.0p per share 
(2009: 4.8p). Together with the interim dividend of 4.0p per 
share (2009: 2.9p) paid on 1 October 2010 this gives a total for 
the year of 11.0p per share (2009: 7.7p), an increase of 43%. 
This reflects both the highly successful performance in 2010 
and the Board’s confidence in the future.
Trading
The trading performance of our businesses in 2010 has  
been outstanding. 
“ In the first half of the year the  
Group story was one of substantially 
increased operating margins on 
essentially flat turnover. In the  
second half of the year this has  
been augmented by the return  
of top-line growth.”

Annual Report 2010 
In the first half of the year the Group story was one of 
substantially increased operating margins on essentially flat 
turnover. In the second half of the year this has been augmented 
by the return of top-line growth. This combination has produced 
an increase of 32% in annual headline operating profit and  
an even higher 53% increase in the year’s headline earnings  
per share due to reductions in tax and net financing costs. 
Group headline operating margins are now at 14.3% up from 
11.5% last year and in the second half of the year we have 
virtually achieved the margin target of 15% we set on the 
acquisition of FKI.
Much of this profit growth has come from FKI businesses 
acquired in July 2008, but also from Dynacast, our principal 
early cycle business, which saw strong sales growth particularly 
in the first half of the year. Order books for the Group remain 
strong going into 2011.
Cash generation in 2010 remained extremely strong. Over 100% 
of profits were turned into cash, generating headline operating 
cash (after capital expenditure) of £202.5 million; and working 
capital remained under strict control even in the face of improving 
sales. Capital expenditure, which had been somewhat curtailed 
during the downturn, is now back on a rising trend – we expect 
this to exceed depreciation over the next few years as our 
investment plans are implemented. We see opportunities for 
profitable investment in all of our businesses.
Dynacast
Dynacast has been owned since May 2005 and the Board 
considers this to be an appropriate time to seek to realise the 
value created since then. A sale process has commenced  
and we are hopeful of a satisfactory outcome. Shareholders, 
however, can be confident that this excellent business will only 
be sold at a price which fully reflects the quality of its prospects. 
In the event a sale is successful it is our intention to return the 
proceeds to shareholders.
Strategy and outlook
Much has been achieved in the period since the acquisition  
of FKI with our existing businesses and management and 
employees are to be congratulated on this performance. 
However, there remains much opportunity for more to  
be achieved.
None of our major businesses has yet regained the levels of 
sales reached in the recent past, nor do we believe they have 
reached their potential in terms of profitability. Our strategy  
of selling businesses at the appropriate moment in their 
improvement cycle remains in place and this moment has not 
arrived for the majority of our businesses. Demand, though 
stronger in Europe and South East Asia than North America, 
continues to be good and current order books lead us to be 
optimistic on the sales outlook for 2011. Our ability to pass  
on raw material price increases, together with many initiatives 
on the cost front, mean we are also hopeful of further 
improvements in operating margins.
We are well placed operationally and financially to take on 
another substantial acquisition. We are as selective as ever  
with our criteria and although it is impossible to be precise 
about timing we are confident of identifying a value enhancing 
opportunity in due course.
In the meantime the inherent strengths of our businesses and 
their management teams gives the Board confidence of further 
progress in 2011.

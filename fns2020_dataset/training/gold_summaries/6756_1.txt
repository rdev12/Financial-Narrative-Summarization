CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Overview
After a slow start, the past year has been characterised by
improving market conditions culminating in strong demand in the
last quarter.  This upturn in demand was felt across most parts of
the business and resulted in increases in revenue and profit before
tax for the Group of 14% and 23% respectively, and very strong
individual performances by NEOS Technologies Inc (NEOS) and
Cleveland Crystals Inc (CCI).
Events of significance during the year include the appointment of
Dr Julian Blogh as Non Executive Chairman, the acquisition of ChromoDynamics Inc (CDI), and the
conferring of a second Queen’s Award on Gooch & Housego’s UK operations.
I am very pleased to be able to welcome Dr Blogh to Gooch & Housego and I am sure that his
extensive experience will prove to be invaluable.
The Queen’s Award is the most significant and widely recognised award that a UK business can
receive.  To be able to add the Queen’s Award for Enterprise: International Trade in recognition of
our recent export performance to our 1994 Queen’s Award for Technological Achievement is an
achievement of which the entire workforce can be very proud.
The development of our new factory and headquarters in Ilminster has suffered delays during the
year due to the scale and complexity of the project, but it is now progressing well, with the first
phase nearing completion and scheduled for occupation in January 2007.  We now expect to have
completed the development and to have relocated all Ilminster operations by the end of 2007.
Earlier in the year we embarked on a major reorganisation of our optoelectronic components
activities.  Going by the project name of ORION, and comprising Gooch & Housego UK Ltd
(G&HUK), CCI, NEOS and Landwehr Electronic GmbH (LE), the reorganisation is aimed at creating
a more efficient and effective integrated global business with greater market presence and extended
reach.  Significant progress has already been made in key areas such as establishing the essential
IT and communications infrastructure, and the project is on target to be completed mid-2007.
Under the new structure, as the boundaries between the individual businesses dissolve, we will
report on the integrated business in terms of its products and markets, rather than by
manufacturing locations as we have in the past.  The increase in inter-company trading is already
distorting individual results and emphasises the need to focus on ORION’s overall performance.
From 1 October 2006 we have also reorganised the corporate structure of the Group, detaching
the UK trading company from Gooch & Housego PLC and establishing a new company, Gooch &
Housego UK Ltd, to carry out UK trading activities.
Gareth Jones – Chief Executive Financial Results
For the year ended 30 September 2006, Group turnover increased by 14% to £25.36m (2005:
£22.32m).  Profit before tax, after charging goodwill amortisation of £0.38m (2005: £0.34m),
increased by 23% to £5.77m (2005: £4.68m).  Profit before tax and goodwill amortisation improved
from £5.02m to £6.15m during the year.  Basic earnings per share increased by 25% to 20.1p
(2005: 16.1p) while basic earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation, rose to 22.2p from last
year’s 18.0p.
The Group’s improved sales results were led by NEOS with sales of £6.38m, an increase over
2005 of £1.20m.  CCI were close to equalling this performance with sales in the year of £5.61m
(2005: £4.46m).  G&H maintained last year’s exceptional performance with sales of £7.52m (2005:
£7.61m) and LE recorded sales of £2.54m (2005: £1.99m). 
Outside of the ORION companies Optronic Laboratories Inc (OLI) increased sales to £3.32m
(2005: £3.08m). 
Operating profits for the Group improved by 21% to £5.74m (2005: £4.76m). ORION companies
contributed a total of £6.08m to total operating profits. NEOS reported profits of £2.31m (2005:
£1.62m), G&H trading profits of £2.40m (2005: £2.41m) and CCI at £1.36m (2005: £ 0.78m). 
OLI returned a 14% increase in operating profits to £0.43m (2005: £0.38m) while LE returned
operating profits of £19,000 (2005: £85,000).  Costs incurred from the new developments at CDI
since its acquisition in February, totalled £0.16m.  Head office costs totalled £0.61m (2005: £0.51m)
The Group’s financial position remains strong with net funds inflow of £0.53m (2005: £2.04m).
This is after financing the acquisition of CDI at a cost of £0.69m.  At 30 September 2006 the
Group had total net funds of £2.90m (2005: £2.37m).
An overall tax rate of 37% for the year (2005: 38%) is as a result of higher rates of US tax and the
effect of the non-allowable charge for goodwill amortisation.
Dividends 
Reflecting the Group’s improved performance, the Directors are proposing a final dividend of 2.8p
making a total for the year of 4.2p.  This represents an increase of 8% over last year’s total of 3.9p
and is covered 4.8 times by post-tax earnings.  The shares went ex-dividend on 6 December
2006, and following approval at the Annual General Meeting on 14 February 2007, the dividend
will be paid to Shareholders on 15 February 2007.

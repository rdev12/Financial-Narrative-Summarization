Our operations
From 1 January 2015, our operations are structured into the 
four business units described here. Compared to 2014, only 
the Americas business unit has the same geographical remit 
as there were previously three AMEC divisions (Americas, 
Europe and Growth Regions) and two Foster Wheeler divisions 
(Engineering & Construction and Global Power Group).
The new company structure has been designed to further 
enable collaboration and promote greater growth opportunities.
Global Power Group
Operating four manufacturing facilities, two cogeneration 
plants, 11 engineering and service centres in eight countries 
and employing around 2,600 employees, this business unit 
designs, supplies and erects boilers, auxiliary steam and 
air pollution control equipment, as well as a wide range of 
aftermarket products and services.
Delivering projects and services virtually anywhere in the 
world, we enable utilities, independent power producers and 
industrial customers to achieve their power, process steam 
and environmental goals.
Northern Europe & CIS
Northern Europe & the Commonwealth of Independent States 
has around 12,000 employees operating in more than 120 
locations across 15 countries, with its expertise extending into 
many more. 
The unit has broad-based customer reach across three of 
our markets, in Environment & Infrastructure; Clean Energy 
– notably in the nuclear industry, including asset support, 
decommissioning and new-build programmes; and Oil & Gas 
– across the value chain and lifecycle for projects on and off 
shore, from pre-feasibility consulting to late-life management 
and decommissioning.
AMEA & Southern Europe
The Asia, Middle East, Africa & Southern Europe (AMEASE) 
unit has over 9,000 employees, spread across more than 
40 locations with strong capabilities and customer reach 
across each of our Oil & Gas, Environment & Infrastructure 
and Mining markets. In addition we have our Consultancy and 
Special Construction group which is focused on infrastructure 
planning, design and construction serving government, 
Oil & Gas, and Mining customers across key geographies 
in and beyond the AMEASE region.
Americas
The largest of our business units, with around 16,000 
employees and approximately 150 offices in 10 countries, 
across the two continents.
Our business is balanced across our markets and we have 
a growing mid/downstream Oil & Gas business in North 
America; a presence in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil upstream 
offshore and we are the market leader in mineable oil sands. 
We are the leading mining consultant in the region and have 
good solar and bioprocess positions in the US, nuclear and 
wind positions in Canada, and we are a leading environmental 
consultancy.

Our four markets
We have positioned our operations across four markets 
because we believe a diversified approach minimises risk 
and maximises opportunity over the long term. In Oil & Gas, 
Mining, Clean Energy and Environment & Infrastructure, 
we provide similar services, winning work through strong 
customer relationships and our proven ability to deliver projects 
successfully. Many of the services we provide to our customers 
are transferable across markets.
Oil & Gas
We are involved in every part of the project delivery phase 
across the oil and gas value chain, but we specifically do not 
operate in early cycle exploration or drilling.
Clean Energy
In renewables we provide a full service engineering, 
procurement and construction solution on wind, solar, biomass 
and biofuels projects. We also support the full lifecycle of 
nuclear energy and are a respected leader in the design and 
supply of combustion and steam generation equipment.
Mining
We offer mining consultancy (including ore resource estimation, 
mine planning and feasibility studies), design, project and 
construction management services.
Environment & Infrastructure (E&I)
We are a leading consulting, engineering and project 
management firm with strong market positions, especially 
in the water, transportation and infrastructure, government 
services and industrial sectors.

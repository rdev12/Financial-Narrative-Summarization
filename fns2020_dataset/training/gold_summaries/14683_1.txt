Overview
The Group’s strategy is to build a multi-
platform gaming business in the US using the 
legal regulated horseracing and greyhound 
operations as a base to position the Group 
for broader-based gaming opportunities as 
regulation develops. 
The Group comprises three divisions: Racing 
and Digital, Venues and Football Pools, all 
of which focus on horseracing and football 
markets. The Racing and Digital and Venues 
divisions are based in the United States, 
where we are licensed by gaming regulators 
in 28 states, employing 700 people across 
field operations and four corporate offices. 
The Football Pools is the oldest football 
gaming business in the world and, through 
its Classic Pools product together with a 
range of pools and casino games, it 
generates strong cash flows.
Strategic progress
During 2014, the Group has made further 
progress in delivering its strategy. This includes 
entry into the New Jersey online gaming 
market through SNG Interactive, our joint 
venture with NYX. This is an important first 
step for the business in the largest US state 
to have legalised online gaming to date, and 
provides a platform for future growth as online 
regulation develops across the US. In our 
Venues business, we opened a 10,000 sq ft 
sports bar and restaurant in our Bradley venue 
which is attracting a younger, more diverse 
customer base. In Connecticut, we also 
launched the State’s only legal online betting 
site, MyWinners.com. The Group obtained 
key regulatory approvals for new sports bar, 
restaurant and betting venues in Stamford, 
Connecticut and San Diego and Norco in 
California. Refinement of Venues expansion 
plans is ongoing and development is subject 
to the Group’s available capital resources. 
The Racing and Digital business has secured 
a number of new contracts in the year, 
including the supply of a new tote system 
and digital technology to Totepool in the UK. 
However, we have been informed that our 
contract with the Californian racing authorities 
to process bets across the State will not be 
renewed at the end of October 2015. 
Chief Executive’s review
Positioning Sportech as one of the 
leaders in the global betting market
The Group’s strategy is to develop 
Sportech’s position as one of the leading 
companies in the regulating US and global 
betting industry. In 2014, we have continued 
to invest in developing our strategic position 
in the US technology and gaming markets, 
whilst modernising our Football Pools 
business, positioning us for future growth.
Business model
04 Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 This difficult trading environment is 
expected to continue in 2015, but we 
remain confident in the long-term value 
within the Venues business. 
VAT claim
In September, the Upper Tribunal ruled in 
favour of Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs 
(“HMRC”) in HMRC’s appeal case relating to 
a VAT repayment claim on the “Spot the Ball” 
game. This followed the initial ruling last year 
of the First-tier Tribunal in Sportech’s favour. 
The Group has been granted permission 
to appeal to the Court of Appeal which 
will be held in the week commencing 
2 November 2015.
Outlook
Racing and Digital and Football Pools are 
trading in line with expectations. Trading in 
our Venues business remains challenging, 
with amounts wagered below prior year levels, 
as a result of a lack of racing due to the cold 
weather in North East USA. The Group 
launched operations in its online gaming 
joint venture in February. The Board remains 
confident in the Group’s prospects for the 
full year ahead.

The Group is confident that it will be able 
to substantially mitigate the impact of this 
contract loss through cost saving and revenue 
generating actions.
During the year the Group strengthened 
its capability in online technology with the 
appointment of Rich Roberts to head its 
Digital operations in the US, including SNG 
Interactive and MyWinners.com. Rich has 
recruited an experienced team to drive 
progress in this important growth area. 
2014 performance
Turning to the performance of our three 
divisions, our Racing and Digital business 
has shown EBITDA growth following the 
investments made in technology and products 
over recent years. The Football Pools has 
made further progress in modernisation of 
its systems and development of its customer 
offering, and is moving towards stabilisation 
of direct channel revenues. 
However, Venues profits fell in 2014 due to 
reduced wagering revenues combined with 
increased content costs and start-up losses 
at Bradley. Whilst disappointing, the fall in 
Connecticut revenues has been in line with 
US industry-wide wagering handle and our 
venues have performed better than similar 
facilities in the North East of America.

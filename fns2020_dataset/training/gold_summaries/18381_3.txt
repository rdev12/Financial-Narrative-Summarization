 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 2
Chairman’s Statement
Sir Michael Heller
Turnover for the year to 30 September 2015 
was £5.16 million compared with £5.51 million 
the previous year. As we reported last year, one 
of our major customers acquired a competitor 
software business and subsequently transferred 
to that company’s software product. The above 
figures reflect the full year impact of this. 
However, it is pleasing to report that second 
half revenues were up on the first half by 
£120,000 or 5%.
Adjusted operating profit was £459,000, 
compared with £553,000, which reflects the 
impact of the reduction in turnover offset by 
significant cost savings. (Adjusted operating 
profit excludes non-cash IFRS charges 
and credits together with one-off 
restructuring costs.) 
Our statutory pre-tax profit for the year was 
£347 ,000 (2014: £401,000) after a net charge 
of £72,000 in relation to two property matters 
referred to below.
We have continued to enhance our main 
products, Quantum VS and Vecta, and the 
operating result for the year is after increasing 
R&D expenditure by 9% to £1,067 ,000 
(2014: £981,000). 
Hosting revenues continue to represent in 
excess of half of total revenues during the 
year under review. Contracted recurring 
revenues, which include annual software 
licence fees and hosting charges, amounted 
to 79% of total revenue compared with 80% 
in the previous year.
I am pleased to report that in July we sold 
our surplus freehold warehouse in Sheffield 
for a cash consideration of £425,000, 
generating a profit after disposal costs 
of £117 ,000. This will result in annual cost 
savings of approximately £27 ,000. We now 
have one remaining surplus freehold property 
which is located in Milton Keynes on which 
we have recently accepted an offer of 
£1 .2 million. Whilst this is lower than its 
previous carrying value, this property has 
been on the market for some time and 
accordingly we have written the property 
down by £189,000 to reflect the expected 
net sale proceeds. We are early in the sale 
process but, if it proceeds, the sale would 
result in annual cost savings of approximately 
£35,000. We will update shareholders 
further in due course.
Cash flows during the year were strong 
and at the year end our cash balances were 
£5.55 million (2014: £4.98 million). This is 
after £425,000 proceeds from the property 
disposal and dividends paid during the year 
of £504,000. We continue to be interested in 
using our cash balances should opportunities 
to acquire similar software -producing 
businesses arise.
Net assets at 30 September 2015 were 
£4.96 million compared to £5.34 million at 
30 September 2014. This in part reflects a 
further provision of £232,000, net of deferred 
tax, against the liability relating to our defined 
benefit pension scheme following a further 
decrease in the discount rate used to value 
liabilities under IAS19. This is discussed 
further in the Chief Executive’s Statement.
The Directors are proposing to pay a 
final dividend of 3p per share (2014: 2p) 
maintaining the total dividend for the year 
at 5.0p. Total dividends paid to shareholders 
will therefore be £631,000. If approved by 
shareholders, the final dividend will be paid 
on 6 April 2016 to those shareholders on the 
register at 4 March 2016. The shares will be 
ex-dividend on 3 March 2016. 
We will review future dividends according 
to the acquisition opportunities that arise 
and our overall cash position at the time. 
However, in view of our relatively large cash 
balances, it is our current intention to pay 
an interim dividend of 2p per share and a 
final dividend of 3p per share in future years. 
At the year-end share price of 65.5p this 
is equivalent to a yield of 7 .6%. 
I would like to thank all our members of staff 
and my colleagues on the Board for their 
contribution during the year.
With a robust, cash generative business 
model combined with a strong balance 
sheet I remain confident about the future.

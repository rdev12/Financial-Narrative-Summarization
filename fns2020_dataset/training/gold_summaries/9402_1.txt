LiDCO Annual Report
2010/11
The market
The directors estimate that the potential
number of patients in Europe who could
benefit from hemodynamic monitoring 
is six times the number currently being
monitored. The cost of critical care
continues to grow. Heightened awareness
of the benefits from the use of LiDCO’s
technology such as reductions in infections,
length of stay and costs are all contributing 
to increased sales. 
The market for minimally invasive
hemodynamic monitors breaks down into
three categories: intensive care (ICU), high
risk surgery and alternate sites such as trauma
and ‘outreach’ (i.e. outside the ICU) care sites.
LiDCO monitors have the potential to play
major roles in each of these arenas.
Reducing surgical complications such 
as infections is a key growth driver for our
business. In the US, it is estimated that
surgical site infections alone cost US$10bn
per annum. The need to prevent central line
infection and septic complications has led
to a drive to reduce the use of invasive
central venous catheters. Use of LiDCO’s
technology can reduce central venous
catheter use by up to 80% in high risk
surgery (Green D, Paklet L (2010) Latest
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
LiDCO had another very good year.
The monitor base increased by a net
233 units (13%) to 2001 units, with
524 units sold or placed during the
year. Disposables income increased 
in our intensive care and surgery
markets by 8% and 39% respectively.
Overall revenues were up 16% on the
previous year to £6.24m with gross
profit up 28% to £4.22m. Expenses
were kept under tight control
resulting in administration costs
reducing by 2%. Average product
margins were maintained at 76%.
Cash outflows before financing were
at a record low with the Group

half of the year. Over the prior year
the loss fell by over £1m with the loss
per share reducing by 75% to 0.22p.
developments in peri-operative monitoring 
of the high-risk major surgery patient.
International Journal of Surgery 8 90-99).
With a US$1.2bn market potential in surgery
and intensive care, the global market for
minimally invasive hemodynamic
monitoring products is large and growing.
The experience level of clinicians in the ICU 
is declining due to the retirement of staff
experienced in the use of older invasive
catheter based technologies. Consequently
there is a growing need for reliable, accurate
and easily adoptable products that can
deliver more cost effective care. The
minimally invasive market now represents
53% of the European hemodynamic
monitoring market value, followed by the
invasive and non-invasive markets which
represent 42% and 5% of sales respectively. 
It is projected that the European minimally
invasive hemodynamic monitoring market
will grow at a compound rate of 12% per
annum; from US$51m today to US$112m 
by 2017 (iData 2011 patient monitoring
research report). The UK represents the
biggest European market for, and fastest
rate of adoption of, minimally invasive
technology. Sales in the UK are projected 
to grow by an average of 17% per annum
from US$14m in 2010 to US$42m in 2017.
The NHS in the UK is now the largest
healthcare organisation in the world, with
an annual spend of £100bn. LiDCO has 
a direct sales force in the UK where our sales
revenues increased last year by a noteworthy
29%. We are resourced to take advantage 
of this fast growing domestic market
opportunity. Acquiring the sales and
marketing rights to the Argon critical 
care products has further broadened and
strengthened our hemodynamic offering 
to our UK customers. 
Evidence and awareness
The minimally invasive hemodynamic
market is documented as the fastest
growing sector in the European hospital
monitoring field. The potential size of the
market, its growth rate and the increasing
presence of clinical guidelines for adoption
of hemodynamic monitoring is inevitably
resulting in an increasing appetite from the
major corporate players to participate 
in providing these advanced products.
The pressure on hospitals to reduce costs
while improving efficiency is intensifying. 
In the UK, the NHS QIPP (Quality, Innovation,
Productivity and Prevention) and ERAS
(Enhanced Recovery After Surgery)
programmes have resulted in a higher focus 
on adopting advanced hemodynamic
monitoring technology. For example, 
in a 2010 survey of UK hospitals by the
British Intensive Care Society, 77% of hospitals
had, or were planning to implement, 
fluid-optimisation of their colorectal 
cancer surgery patients. The three most
important issues determining their choice
of technology were ease of use/adoption,

trending accuracy and suitability of use 
for the broadest variety of patients. 
The LiDCOrapid was specifically designed 
to be easy to set up and usable in the fluid
and drug management of any patient with
arterial line access. Our surgical product 
is proving very adoptable, with UK sales 
of LiDCOrapid disposables increasing 
by 137% in the year. 
Cumulatively more than 100 publications
are in print referencing our technology.
During 2010 alone 25 research abstracts
and papers on the use of LiDCO monitors
were presented and published. Using 
LiDCO technology for high-risk surgery
patients has been shown to help reduce
complications – particularly infections – 
by more than a third, reducing hospital stay
by an average of 12 days per patient and
costs by £4,800 per patient (Pearse et al. 
Early goal-directed therapy after major 
surgery reduces complications and duration 
of hospital stay. A randomized, controlled trial.
Crit. Care 2005, 9 (6) 687-693).
In September 2010, the Journal of Critical
Care published the findings of a study from
the University of Iowa, showing that using
the LiDCOplus monitor significantly reduced
the mortality rate in patients treated for
shock (Hata et al. Reduced mortality with non
invasive hemodynamic monitoring of shock,
Journal of Critical Care, 26:2, pages 224.e1-
224.e8). Treatment of patients using LiDCO’s
monitor significantly reduced the observed
mortality rate to 13% against 32% and 20%
in the two invasively monitored groups and
37% in the unmonitored patient groups.
These results add to the previous findings 
of Pearse et al who reported that supportive
care guided by LiDCO’s lithium dilution and
arterial waveform assessments of cardiac
output was associated with reduced peri-
operative morbidity compared with
conventional assessment.
Two further large multi-centre outcome
trials are progressing well. In the UK, the
LiDCOrapid cardiac output monitor was
chosen as the sole monitoring system 
to be used in OPTIMISE, a government-
supported trial which aims to improve
surgical outcomes by optimising a patient’s
cardiovascular management. The trial,
covering 12 centres, is the largest of its 
type to date; it is underway and currently
recruiting patients. 
The LiDCOplus is the sole hemodynamic
monitor used in a 960 patient US-
Government funded multi-centre trial –
MOnIToR (Monitoring Organ donors 
to Improve Transplantation Results). 
The results of earlier studies using
LiDCOplus to monitor and develop 
a treatment protocol designed to improve
the hemodynamic status of donors
generated considerable interest within 
the US transplantation community. 
As with the OPTIMISE trial, the MOnIToR 
trial is progressing well. 
To facilitate adoption and productive 
use of its equipment, LiDCO’s monitoring
products are also supported by excellence 
in clinical education. In April 2010 LiDCO
established a Hemodynamic Workshop 
in collaboration with doctors at St George’s
Hospital in London aimed at teaching
hemodynamic optimisation techniques 
to senior physicians. This course is accredited
by the UK’s Royal College of Anaesthetists
for continuing medical education points.
The course has been very well received 
by all the consultant level attendees and 
we have seen a high degree of participation
and take up by our European distributors 
of places for courses held this year. In July
LiDCO received accreditation from the 
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) for its
LiDCOplus monitor competency-based
study day. The course is designed for 
all critical care nurses, nurse educators,
professional development nurses, nurse
consultants and junior doctors. Our plans
are to considerably expand both of these
educational activities. 
Products and applications
LiDCO applies several common criteria 
to its products. They must be innovative,
protectable, and applicable to significant
clinical applications. They must have a large
addressable market and deliver significant
margins. The manufacturing process must
also be low cost with very high reliability. 
Each LiDCO monitor addresses a particular
market. Launched in 2008, the LiDCOrapid
principally focuses on high risk surgery
patients with arterial lines, but also addresses
alternate site use – for example in trauma,
obstetrics and shock. The LiDCOplus is used
mainly in the intensive care arena. 
During the year several new product
developments were introduced, for example: 
• a software upgrade to the LiDCOrapid,
including a module to expand access 
to blood pressure data;
• a translation facility to convert information
from English into 22 languages; and
• improved communication with Philips
and GE hospital information systems.
Sales and distribution 
Revenue was up 16% to £6.24m (2009/10:
£5.37m). A similar number of LiDCO
monitors were sold or placed in the year
(524 vs. 565 units in 2009/10) with monitor
capital income up 5%. The monitor base 
at the year end was 2,001 units, with a net
increase of 233 units (13%) in the year. 
As explained in the Financial Review, 
from this year we are now reporting our
installed base as the net number of sold
and placed units over the last seven years.
Our monitors have an expected life of seven
years in use, so we have decided to assume
all monitors over seven years old will 
no longer be disposable income generating.
From here on the installed base will only
increment by the difference between those
monitors sold in the year and those retired
i.e. that were sold eight years ago. The
LiDCOrapid portion of the installed base
grew by 474 units and now represents 
in excess of 50% of the monitor base.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
Disposables income was higher for both 
our intensive care and surgery markets 
by 8% and 39% respectively and by 18%
overall. Disposables numbers were also up
26% at 47,938 units (2009/10: 37,918 units).
Export sales represent 62% of total income –
slightly down from 66% in the prior period,
reflecting the very strong UK sales growth
seen in the period as well as economic
weakness in some parts of continental Europe. 
LiDCO’s strategy is to sell directly to the 
high value, high growth UK hospital 
market via its strong, direct sales force and 
is expecting to take a significant share 
of the domestic market growth. In export
territories we are focusing on addressable
markets i.e. those where we expect good
growth and where we have access to
specialist distribution partners with the
attributes and commitment to sell our
products and develop our market within
their territory. These include the US, Japan,
Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, the Middle
East and Latin America. 
In the US there are almost 5,000 hospitals
performing surgery and within these
hospitals there are over 100,000 intensive
care beds. In addition to the challenge 
of selling to this large and geographically
spread out hospital market, there are 
a significant number of regional and/or
national accounts to work with. Once sales
traction is gained in the US, these hospital
groups and group purchasing organisations
(such as Premier and Novation) become
increasingly important customers. 
Over the years it is clear that fully accessing
the growing USA hemodynamic monitoring
market has become logistically and
financially impossible for the smaller and
even larger sized companies. Therefore, 
in order to address a significant share 
of this opportunity we have established 
a distribution agreement in the US with 
the Respiratory and Monitoring division 
of Covidien plc (‘Covidien’). Covidien has 
a long standing and substantial existing
oximetry monitoring business and more
recently made significant investment 
in the monitoring market, acquiring two
additional US monitoring companies
(Aspect and Somanetics) with a very
significant total investment of US$460m. 
Collectively the Respiratory and Monitoring
division now has one of the largest
monitoring equipment sales forces available
today in the US. Importantly this group sells
into over 80% of operating rooms in the
major hospitals. In the US Covidien is now
able to offer customers a suite of monitoring
systems that can collectively monitor
respiratory function, brain oxygenation and
through the LiDCOrapid the underlying
hemodynamic status. These products are 
a natural fit together and offer, in particular,
advantages to the management of high risk
surgery patients. Accordingly, we believe
that the commitment by Covidien 
to promoting LiDCO’s LiDCOrapid monitor
along side their own products is strong. 
Covidien achieved the first year’s minimum
sales requirements and our business with
them grew 26% over the prior year. This was
a good result, as inevitably amalgamations
of this scale take a lot of effort and time out
from the field. Indeed, training of the new
members of the consolidated sales force
and internal national accounts sales teams
on LiDCO’s product is still taking place. 
We expect the number of evaluations 
and pipeline to continue to build as the
recently trained representatives also start 
to contribute to the sales efforts. Clearly
Covidien has made a significant investment
in the monitoring field and has the interest,
infrastructure, resources and products
necessary to access in particular a significant
share of the high risk surgery hemodynamic
monitoring market. 
Geographic sales and trading
UK sales summary
• Total revenue up 29% at £2.36m
(2009/10: £1.82m)
• Monitor revenue up 52% to £0.50m
(2009/10: £0.33m)
– ICU: LiDCOplus monitor revenue 
up 49% to £0.30m
– Surgery: LiDCOrapid monitor revenue

• Disposables sales of £1.80m up 21%
(2009/10: £1.49m)
• Other income £55,000 (2009/10: nil)
Our focus last year was to maintain our ICU
business and grow our LiDCOrapid surgery
interest. Our direct sales force had a very
good year achieving both these goals. Total
income was up 29% to £2.36m, with the 
UK representing 38% of our total worldwide
sales. Monitor and disposables income
increased across both the ICU and surgery
markets. As expected the greatest growth
was experienced in the surgery segment
where LiDCOrapid monitor sales were 
up 118% and smart card disposables 
up 137%. The monitor base increased 
by a net 24 units (9%) to 300 units in the UK,
with 61 units sold placed during the year.
The total number of disposables sold
increased from 14,055 to 17,605. 
In the UK there will be intense pressure 
on the NHS in terms of revenue and capital
spend in the new financial year starting 
this month. We believe this will continue 
to drive hospitals to focus on reducing 
costs while improving efficiency. ERAS
programmes within the NHS will most likely
continue to be prioritized, despite the

worsening economic conditions. We expect
these conditions will deliver sales growth 
of our surgery product in particular. Fluid
and hemodynamic monitoring is already
adopted, or planned in the majority of UK
hospitals. Additional sales growth should
come from increasing use in a number 
of surgical procedures. 
We announced in March 2011 that LiDCO
was appointed by Argon Medical Devices
Inc. (‘Argon’) to take over their existing UK
critical care sales. Argon acquired the critical
care business of Becton Dickinson (‘BD’) 
in late 2010. We are delighted that Argon
has decided to extend the relationship 
we previously established with BD’s
Japanese critical care group. We expect 
to start selling Argon’s products from May
2011. UK customers will then be able to buy
an expanded and related group of critical
care and surgery products including the
arterial pressure transducer necessary for
use with our monitors. 
USA sales summary
• Distribution revenue up 26% to £1.89m
(2009/10: £1.50m) 
• LiDCOrapid monitor revenue steady
£0.68m (2009/10: £0.68m)
• LiDCOrapid smart card sales up 54% 
to £0.83m (2009/10: £0.54m)
• Licence fee and other income of £0.38m
up 35% (2009/10: £0.28m)
Sales to Covidien were up 26% during the
period. Comparisons across the period 
are complicated by the stocking orders
taken in both periods and the subsequent
temporary sales disruption from acquisition
and integration of the Aspect and
Somanetics sales forces. We are pleased 
to report that Covidien has achieved the
minimum sales in the first year of our
contract. Overall Covidien has purchased
657 LiDCOrapid monitors representing 
both sales stock and a demonstration/
evaluation pool. Covidien has shown a high
level of commitment to developing the
high risk surgical market opportunity and 
is putting a significant amount of time into
training and incentivising the sales force. 
LiDCO has retained sales responsibility 
for the ICU-focused LiDCOplus product 
sales in the US with our direct sales force.
Direct sales have decreased to £464,000
(2009/10: £773,000) with £111,000 of the 
fall the inevitable result of the transfer 
to Covidien of LiDCOrapid sales in accounts
that were previously a direct sales business.
Capital revenues (i.e. new monitor sales)
from the LiDCOplus fell from £184,000 
to £83,000 due to the reduced sales effort 
as four of the LiDCO sales team transferred 
to Covidien. LiDCOplus sensor sales declined
from £422,000 to £341,000, a consequence
of some customers now purchasing the
LiDCOrapid – where previously they would
have purchased the LiDCOplus – and
reduced geographic sales coverage outside
our key accounts. 
LiDCOplus consumable sales to our key
accounts (i.e. accounts where we can
support the business) declined modestly – 
by only £43,000. Most of this decline was
due to product substitution in a small
number of accounts towards use of the
LiDCOrapid. Going forward we expect the
core key account direct business to be
supportable and maintainable while we
focus on the bigger and more addressable
surgery opportunity for the LiDCOrapid. 
We continue to believe there is a significant
ICU market in the US for our more precise
and sensor calibrated monitor. 
Continental Europe sales summary
• Total revenue down by 13% to £0.86m
(2009/10: £0.99m)
• Monitor sales revenue of £0.32m down
40% (2009/10: £0.53m)
• Sensor/smart card sales up 17% to £0.54m
(2009/10: £0.46m)
We reported at the interim stage that the
economic climate in Europe had been
weak, delaying capital and disposable
purchases in some countries. Where
economic conditions have been poor this 
has affected our distributors’ business. 
In contrast, where finances are stronger, 
e.g. in Eastern Europe, we have seen a very
significant increase in sales. The results are
therefore very mixed; ranging from increases
of 71% in Slovenia to an 82% fall in business
in Italy, previously our best performing
territory. Despite the challenging conditions,
underlying disposable income was up by 17%.
We expect sales to increase modestly in 2011
as the economic climate gradually improves. 
Rest of World and licence fee income
• Total revenue up 135% at £0.66m
(2009/10: £0.28m)
• Monitor revenue up 225% to £0.39m
(2009/10: £0.12m)
• Sensor/smart card sales up by 117% 
to £0.13m (2009/10: £0.06m)
• Licence fee and other income of £0.14m
(2009/10: £0.10m)
Sales in the ROW were up 135%, reflecting
increases across the board in licence fees,
monitor and disposable revenues. This was 
a good performance with particularly good
results seen in Brazil and the Middle East.
Minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring 
is becoming well established in Japan. 
We believe the Japanese hemodynamic
monitoring high risk surgery market has 
a potential market value of US$285 million 
per annum, with reimbursement currently
available. With respect to our distribution
arrangements in Japan, in October 2010
Argon announced that it had acquired the
critical care division of BD. LiDCO had signed 
a distribution agreement with BD in April
2009 for sales of the LiDCOrapid in Japan 
and a registration application file for product
approval has been prepared for submission.
We expect registration and reimbursement
to be approved late 2011/early 2012.
Negotiations with distribution parties 
in Japan are well advanced and a Heads 
of Agreement has been signed – we expect
to be able to further update shareholders 
in the near future.

Financial review
Turnover increased by 16% to £6.24m
(2009/10: £5.37m). Losses after tax
decreased significantly by 73% 
to £390,000 (2009/10: £1,427,000)
and the loss per share was reduced
to 0.22 pence (2009/10: 0.87 pence).
Exports rose by 9% to £3.88m but
with a strong increase in sales in the
UK represented 62% of sales, down
from 66% the previous year.
During the year a total of 524 monitors
(2009/10: 565 monitors) were sold or placed.
Historically the reported installed base has
represented the total monitors sold or placed
since the first sales in 2001. It is inevitable
that some of the earlier monitors will now
have been replaced by newer models 
or may simply be no longer in use and 
in common with some other companies 
in our sector, the installed base has been
restated based on the number of units sold
or placed within the last seven years. 
The restated installed base of monitors 
at the year end was 2,001 (2009/10: 1,768)
representing a net increase in the year 
of 233 monitors. Some of the installed base
will be demonstration and evaluation
monitors sold to distributors. The monitors
sold/placed in the year comprised 474
LiDCOrapid monitors and 50 LiDCOplus
monitors with 515 (2009/10: 536) of the
monitors being sold and nine (2009/10: 29)
being placed.
Recurring revenues from the sales 
of disposables, service contracts and fees 
for use increased by 18% to £3.68m (2009/10:
£3.13m) and represent 59% of total revenues.
The number of disposables sold increased 
by 26% to 47,938 (2009/10: 37,918). 
The average product margin across all
products after external procurement costs
increased slightly during the period from
75% to 76%. Future profitability will
significantly depend on margins achieved
on disposables and these have remained
high during the year. Margins achieved 
on LiDCOplus sensors remained steady 
at 86% and on LiDCOrapid smart cards
increased marginally to 93% (2009/10: 92%). 
Sales of LiDCOrapid smart cards which 
rose by 39% will be an important growth
revenue stream in future years. In the UK
where hemodynamic output monitoring
has been demonstrated to help to reduce
hospital costs and where we have detailed
usage information, we have seen the
average use rate increase from 3.5 to 4.7
uses per monitor per month, with use 
in some hospitals as high as 15 uses per
monitor per month.
The overall gross margin on sales was 67%,
up from 61% in the previous year largely
due to reduced Med One payments in the
period which amounted to £526,000
(2009/10: £688,000). Med One payments 
are expected to reduce to about £230,000 
in 2011/12 and be minimal in the following
year. Total overheads fell by £118,000 (2%)
compared with the previous year. As noted
previously, the comparative effect 
of transferring most of the US sales force 
to Aspect (now Covidien) in July 2009 was
to reduce costs by about £325,000. This
reduction was offset most significantly 
by additional sales and marketing costs 
in the UK where sales increased by 29%.
Taxation
As the Group is still at the pre-profit stage
there was no tax charge for the year and 
in addition the Group has a deferred tax
asset of £5.6m although this has not been
recognised in the accounts. The Group
qualifies for research and development tax
credits, which are estimated as £109,000
(2009/10: £122,000) and are shown in the
income statement. 
Cash, ﬁnancing and working capital
The net cash outflow before financing
activities was £433,000 (2009/10: £1,044,000),
its lowest rate since flotation in July 2001.
Cash balances at 31 January amounted 
to £1,404,000 and the Company has no
bank borrowings. The Board anticipates 
this will be sufficient to see the Company
through to profitability and positive cashflow. 
Stock at the year end decreased slightly 
to £1.05m and represents 18% (2009/10: 22%)
of non-licence fee revenue. Expenditure 
on fixed and intangible assets in the year 
of £556,000 compares with £608,000 the
previous year and is below the charge for
depreciation and amortisation of £639,000.
Expenditure on fixed and intangible assets
is not expected to rise significantly in the
foreseeable future.
Product development 
New product development
The latest revision of the LiDCOrapid
software, version 1.03 and the development
of the universal pressure waveform module
were completed in the year. The new
software release introduced a number 
of features focused on further developing
the LiDCOrapid graphical user interface 
and simplifying use of, and connectivity 
to, our monitors.
Summary of developments 
concluded during 2010

Allowing the LiDCOrapid monitor 
to communicate with a wider range 
of hospital information systems. One such
communication project, announced in
October, was to connect to GE’s Centricity
Clinical Information Systems in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa. This follows our
previous software development enabling 
a link between LiDCO’s proprietary stand-
alone monitoring system and Philips’
patient monitors via the Philips VueLink.

LIDCO software evolution
Given the growing interest in fluid
management and hemodynamic monitoring,
we are exploring further refining the
graphical user interface and core algorithm
software architecture to allow for potential
OEM solutions, whereby elements of the
software could be more easily licenced 
to third parties. Research is also underway
into the performance of the core algorithm
with alternate, often less high fidelity, signal
sources with the objective of widening the
patient applications and thereby increasing
the addressable market for our technology. 
Regarding our intensive care product 
the LiDCOplus we intend to update the
LiDCOplus monitor software to v 4.02. This
will involve updating the operating system,
adding the blood pressure module option
and further improving ease of use and
calibration methodology. 
We believe that there is a significant market
for a combined graphical user interface that
can realise the clinical synergy between
Covidien’s Bispectral Index (BIS) depth 
of anesthesia product and the LiDCOrapid
monitor. The former ensures the correct
depth of anesthesia is achieved, and the
LiDCOrapid is used to restore and maintain
blood pressure and cardiac output 
to appropriate levels after anesthesia
induction and during surgery. A prospective
study at King’s College Hospital, London,
strongly suggested that this combination
display could significantly improve 
the management of patients’ levels 
of anesthesia, fluid and hemodynamic
status. The project to develop a combined
graphical user interface (GUI) is advancing
with a communication interface already
developed. Work is now progressing to
finalise the screen design. This development
project is expected to conclude around 
the last quarter of 2011. Patent applications
have been filed on both the basic structure
of the LiDCOrapid monitor GUI and this has
been followed by a second application 
on the combined hemodynamic and depth
of anesthesia GUI display. 
Regulatory and quality review
During the year LiDCO Limited was
successfully audited against the
requirements of ISO13485:2003,
ISO9001:2008, the EU Medical Devices
Directive and the Health Canada Medical
Device Regulations, allowing continued
certification of the Company and our
products. Also during the year, LiDCO was
successfully inspected by the UK MHRA, 
to ensure continued compliance with 
Good Distribution Practice requirements.
Our activities and products comply with the
requirements of all relevant EU Directives –
the Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE) regulations; the
Restrictions of the use of certain Hazardous
Substances in Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (RoHS) regulations; the
Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation
of Chemicals (REACH) regulations; the Waste
Batteries and Accumulators regulations; the
Batteries and Accumulators (Placing on the
Market) regulations; the Machinery Directive 
and the Eco Design Directive.
LiDCO’s products are registered in a number
of major territories and registration of LiDCO
products is ongoing in Japan.
Outlook and prospects 
We are pleased to be reporting another year
of considerable progress. Looking ahead,
independent research shows that cardiac
output monitoring is now the fastest
growing sector within the European
monitoring market with the minimally
invasive products now representing more
than 50% of sales (source: 2011 iData
Research). With our pressure waveform
based technology, international distribution
partners and increasing evidence and
awareness, we are confident of continuing
commercial progress. We traded profitably
in the second half of the year and for the full
year on an EBITDA basis. We look forward 
to building on this and making further
progress in 2011 and beyond.
On a personal note my co-founder and
Scientific Director, Dr David Band, has
retired from the Board this month. David
has worked with me on the Board since the
Company’s foundation and has contributed
enormously to bringing the Company 
to its current position. His many contributions
to medical science over the last 50 years
have had a profound impact on the
management of high risk patients. We thank
David for all he has done. I am delighted 
to say he will be staying with us and
continue advising LiDCO with regards 
to product development.

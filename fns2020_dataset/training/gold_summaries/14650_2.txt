Performance Analysis
Spirent puts innovation to the test. With a concentration on Ethernet, 
mobility and satellite positioning as well as the applications that enrich 
these networks, Spirent’s Performance Analysis division facilitates device 
and network testing from the research and development stage to the launch 
of communications networks and services. We push the limits of these 
networks, their elements, mobile and satellite positioning devices, and 
applications by allowing equipment makers and service providers to subject 
their offerings to lab-based conformance and performance testing simulating 
real-world conditions before a commercial launch. This approach accelerates 
time to market and improves the quality of the products and services our 
customers bring to market. 
Service Assurance
Spirent’s service assurance solutions allow service providers to diagnose, 
troubleshoot and determine how to resolve issues with networks and systems 
within the live network. Service providers rely on Spirent to provide 
centralised and field test tools to improve the quality of service and allow 
technicians to efficiently prevent or resolve issues from the core of the 
network to inside the consumer’s home.
Systems
PG Drives Technology is a leading supplier of sophisticated electronic control 
systems for electrically powered vehicles in the mobility and industrial 
markets. These include medical vehicles such as powered wheelchairs and 
mobility scooters as well as industrial vehicles such as floor cleaning vehicles,  
fork-lift trucks, aerial access platforms and golf carts. 3 Spirent Communications plc

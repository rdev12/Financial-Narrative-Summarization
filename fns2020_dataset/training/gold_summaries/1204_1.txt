Strategic Report  Dr . Kerim Sener 
Managing Director
Ariana’s investment case remains strong with  
its robust project economics on the Red Rabbit  
Gold Project and a substantially de-risked route  
to production that it is pursuing in partnership  
with Proccea Construction Co. 
Proccea’s and Eldorado Gold’s funding for the  
Red Rabbit JV and Artvin JV respectively will enable 
Ariana to focus on value creation through further 
resource definition and project portfolio expansion 
across Turkey.
Ariana remains focused and dedicated to the 
discovery and development of gold and silver 
deposits in Turkey.

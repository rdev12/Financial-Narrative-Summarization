GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS (GBUs)
Kentz is organised into three global 
business units whose broad range of 
services allows for multiple entry points 
into the life of a project. These business 
units complement each other, providing 
high value services and complex project 
solutions to some of the world’s largest 
energy and resource companies.
EPC
Kentz offers a broad range of engineering and 
construction services, providing clients with fully 
designed and delivered turnkey solutions. Our 
approach to projects is client-focused, preferring a 
“one team” style of execution. Our full in-house team 
designs, engineers and builds complex facilities for 
our clients in remote and challenging locations 
throughout the world.
CONSTRUCTION
Kentz executes multi-disciplinary construction 
contracts that add significant value to a client’s 
end asset. We focus on the technically challenging 
areas of construction: the provision of structural, 
mechanical, electrical, instrumentation and piping 
services. Our construction management teams are 
highly experienced in the construction of new plant 
facilities, and the retrofit and expansion of existing 
plant facilities.
TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES
Through the Technical Support Services (TSS) 
business, Kentz offers a range of services for capital 
projects from front-end and detailed engineering, 
project and construction management, through to 
completions and commissioning of major energy 
plants. This has been a key area of growth for Kentz 
and highlights clients’ demand for our specialist 
engineering and construction capabilities.

GEOGRAPHIC REACH
OUR PLATFORM FOR GROWTH GRAPHIC
AMERICAS
Kentz has achieved strong 
growth in the Americas 
mainly due to the increased 
contributions of our 
Canadian operations. In 
2013, Kentz established new 
operations in Colombia with 
a core client and in January 
2014, we completed our 
acquisition of Valerus Field 
Solutions in the US which 
provides us with material 
entry into both the US and 
Latin American markets. 
MIDDLE EAST  
AND CASPIAN
Our core market which has 
experienced competitive 
pressures in recent years is 
showing signs of 
improvement. Kentz won 
several important new 
contract awards in 2013, 
many with our core client 
base. We continue to see 
further activity in Iraq, an 
important market in this 
region where we are focused 
on building a sustainable 
business with some of the 
world’s largest energy 
companies. 
AFRICA
The significant gas 
discoveries in East Africa 
provide an optimistic future 
for the oil and gas sector in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Kentz’s 
large presence in 
Mozambique and strong 
track record in LNG 
developments elsewhere 
positions us to provide our 
services to these exciting 
developments. 
AUSTRALASIA
The Australasia region was 
the largest region in the 
Group in terms of revenues 
and profits for 2013. The 
main focus in this market 
continues to be the 
significant investment by 
some of the oil majors in 
developing LNG facilities. 
Kentz has played a large part 
in these facilities since 2009 
and expect this activity to 
continue for the foreseeable 
future. 
FAR EAST AND RUSSIA
In Russia we continue to provide services to our clients in 
Sakhalin Island - a remote and challenging location. Our 
expansion into mainland Russia following the opening of our 
Moscow office is still at an early stage but we continue to 
evaluate opportunities and possible partnerships to position 
ourselves for major upcoming developments

Our flexible and agile business 
model, combined with robust 
strategies, enables Kentz to 
effectively deliver growth in 
its core businesses.
We operate a continuous 
strategic review process which 
allows our three GBUs to 
focus on sustaining long-term 
value generation.

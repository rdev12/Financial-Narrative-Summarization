 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 3
Along with Geoff Somervail, the Group’s newly appointed CEO, I am pleased to be
able to report on the Group’s results and performance for the financial year to
December 2006. Over the period, turnover increased by 4% to £2.82 million (2005:
£2.71million) and consultancy income lifted significantly to £1,241,846 (2005:
£358,749).
Although initially disappointing, the small loss of £62k (2005: profit of £52k) belies
the positive strides we have made to developing the business overall, and the
Board is greatly encouraged by the outlook of the business.
During the year the Board faced the challenge of balancing the growth of the
consultancy business and rationalising the loss adjusting cost base. The Group
enjoyed the financial benefit of this in the second half of the year – in which Claims
People turned its half year loss of £67k to a loss of £62k at the year end. 
The Board continues to carefully monitor costs and cash-flow, and we believe
additional margin gains are achievable as our level of activity increases.  
As announced on 1 March 2007, and as part of the Board’s plan for the ongoing development of the current
Claims People business, the Group has appointed Geoff Somervail as Chief Executive, with Barry Whyte moving
to the position of Group Managing Director. Robert Mitchell of Bluehone Investments has been appointed as a
Non-Executive Director, effective immediately. Dominic Boyce, the Group Financial Director, is to assume the
added responsibility of Company Secretary from Peter Morgan who is giving up the role due to commitments
outside the Group. The Board also announces that Graham Cole, Non-Executive Director, has stepped down
from the Board with immediate effect due to increasing business commitments elsewhere. I’d like to take this
opportunity to thank all of the directors for their combined efforts during what was a very busy period, and wish
Graham the best for the future.
We are encouraged that new and existing Directors have subscribed for new shares in the Company as part of
the Placing at 1.5p raising a total of £500k. Geoff Somervail has subscribed for 11,121,667 shares, representing
8.16 per cent. of the issued share capital of the Company. Bluehone Investments have subscribed for 4,423,333
new ordinary shares, which increases their holding to 18,089,330 shares, representing 13.27 per cent. of the
issued share capital of the Company. Cornhill Shareholders Limited have subscribed for 11,121,667 new
ordinary shares, representing 8.16 per cent. of the issued share capital of the Company.
Founding Directors Barry Whyte and David Croston have each subscribed for 3,333,333 new ordinary shares
taking their holdings to 8,850,014 shares (6.49 per cent.) and 6,835,014 shares (5.02 per cent.) respectively.  
As highlighted at the time of the Placing, the Board has clearly identified a number of interesting target markets
to accelerate the growth of the Group. I believe the changes, as outlined, will provide the foundations in terms of
management skills and other related resources to enable the Group to capitalise on such opportunities, a
number of which have been identified for exploration.
As always, I wish to thank our employees and shareholders for their continued support.

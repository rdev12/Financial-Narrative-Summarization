The execution of major engineering 
projects requires hundreds of decisions 
– large and small – every day. Thousands 
more are required in the subsequent 
decades of operation, maintenance, 
modification and end of life. Throughout, 
accurate and timely decisions depend 
on the quality, completeness and 
accessibility of the information that 
forms the Digital Asset.

industries we serve underpins our

Management and Integrated 
Shipbuilding. The world’s capital 
intensive industries depend on AVEVA 
technology to continually anticipate

At a glance
Our aim is to establish Clareti Transaction Control (“CTC”) as the leading 
enterprise data integrity platform, giving our customers the control and 
certainty they need in a world awash with real-time streaming data.
Our Clareti products
CTC was originally designed as a disruptive product to 
address the global matching and reconciliation market 
dominated by inflexible legacy products and poorly 
governed user-developed applications. CTC is powered 
by a versatile high performance transaction matching 
engine able to handle all data types, and uses modern 
in-memory data grid technology to achieve the extreme 
scalability and real-time processing required by many 
global customers. Even in extremely high volume, low 
latency, environments with complex unstructured data 
flows, CTC is proven to give operational certainty 
to organisations conducting millions of transactions per 
hour in fast-moving markets. Functionality to provide 
rapid, user-driven, on-boarding along with powerful 
matching algorithms, flexible workflow and reporting 
complete a best-in-class solution. 
With ongoing investment from the Group, and successful 
customer implementations, CTC has now evolved into 
a full platform capable of providing real-time transaction 
control and enterprise data integrity across a growing 
set of use cases. Our current portfolio of Clareti business 
applications includes CTC Accounts Receivable 
Management for automating matching, reconciliation 
and allocation to reduce the corporate order-to-cash cycle, 
CTC Intersystems for controlling intra and inter-company 
trades, CTC OTC Derivatives for operational control 
of over-the-counter derivative financial instruments, 
and CTC Transition Management for integrity assurance 
during systems change and data migration. We also offer 
a full portfolio of complementary consulting services 
and 24/7 global support, and all our products are cloud 
ready and available on our Clareti-as-a-Service platform.

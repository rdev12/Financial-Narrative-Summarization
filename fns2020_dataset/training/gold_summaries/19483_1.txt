customers to promote their properties, brands and proposition 
more strongly and gain a competitive edge.
As the property industry becomes more digital, Rightmove’s 
market leading audience and best in class software is 
becoming more valuable to customers. Our customers’ spend 
on digital advertising is growing as the property advertising 
market continues to shift structurally from ofﬂ ine to online and 
also as customers choose to reinvest the savings from the 
business efﬁ ciencies that our platform and the internet brings. 
We expect that our growth will continue to come through 
product innovation and pricing. 
We also continue to develop a number of smaller adjacent 
businesses focused on advertising overseas and commercial 
properties and property related data and valuation services.
15 successive years of growth
Rightmove celebrated its 15th birthday in 2015 delivering both 
another record year of results and our 15th successive year of 
growth. Our customer base grew by 2% to reach an all-time 
high of nearly 20,000, our property stock advantage increased 
to nearly 50% more than any other UK portal, we attracted an 
additional 200 million visits to Rightmove, we generated 16% 
more leads for our customers and our underlying operating 
proﬁ t grew 16% to a record £144.3m.
It is remarkable how far Rightmove has come. Our progress 
is testament to our disciplined focus on the UK property 
advertising market and the huge effort Rightmovers have put in 
to build this business together with our industry customers. 
Rightmove has changed the way Britain searches and 
researches property and we look forward to delivering 
continued growth and further empowering the UK’s decisions 
around property. 
Our strategy
The place that consumers turn to ﬁ rst and engage 
with most when searching and researching property.
For 15 years we have invested in our brand. However, it is not 
just the 15 years of investment that makes Rightmove so 
strong, it is the depth of connection that the British public has 
with our brand. With our focus on doing the right thing for both 
consumers and customers Rightmove has become a trusted 
and valuable source of property information.
Rightmove celebrated its 15th birthday in 2015 and together 
with the support of nearly 20,000 customers, it has changed 
the way Britain searches and researches property.
Our property stock advantage coupled with our brand 
strength and innovation have substantially increased our 
audience size and engagement this year. We attracted 200 
million more visits in 2015 as more people came to search 
and research the only place with a million properties for sale 
and to rent in the UK. 
We help our customers succeed by delivering great 
value marketing and by helping drive business efﬁ ciencies. 
We have grown our customer base by 2% during 2015 to a 
record high and continue to build broader relationships to 
support customers’ ambitions. We continue to break records 
at the start of 2016 having already generated over 9 million 
leads for our customers.
Business model
Rightmove is the UK’s number one property portal and 
operates a two-sided network. On one side we have the UK’s 
largest and most engaged property audience and on the other 
side we have the largest inventory of properties. We beneﬁ t 
from strong network effects as our property audience and the 
properties our customers advertise create a ‘virtuous circle’ 
enhancing the Rightmove value proposition. 
Rightmove is free to the consumer and is where home 
buyers and renters turn to ﬁ rst as they can see virtually the 
whole property market in one place. It is equally compelling to 
home sellers and landlords as it is where nearly all home 
buyers and renters are searching and researching the market. 
Our customers are primarily estate agents, lettings agents 
and new homes developers advertising properties for sale and 
to rent in the UK. We offer the most signiﬁ cant and effective 
exposure for their brand and properties, the largest source of 
high quality leads together with best in class software 
providing market insight and tools that empower their 
decisions and help drive business efﬁ ciencies.
Our principal sources of revenue are the monthly 
subscription fee paid by customers to advertise all of their 
properties and the fee paid for additional advertising products 
and packages. Our additional advertising products enable

platforms each month, our new launches in the year included 
our Valuation Range App, the Rightmove School Checker, 
mortgage content to further support home movers in their 
journey and we began to roll-out our new look search results 
pages and products based on a brand new site architecture. 
Looking forward, we will be pressing home our advantage with 
further innovation including a new ‘Where can I live?’ search.
We continued to invest in our brand in 2015 with our ‘ﬁ nd 
your happy’ advertising campaign. This campaign connects 
with the strong positive emotions that moving home often 
generates and reﬂ ects our position at the heart of it. Our brand 
building focused on national TV , through our ‘always on’ 
partnership with Channel 4 across their property content. 
We added further weight to our presence in London with 
more heavyweight TV advertising and through additional 
outdoor media across the capital. We also became the 
exclusive property partner with the Evening Standard in 
addition to our existing exclusive partnership with Time Out. 
The popularity of our Overseas property site increased 
signiﬁ cantly as we launched a new mobile site, added over 
500 new customers and increased the number of properties 
advertised by a third. We now advertise over 230,000 properties 
across the world with a focus on the most popular British 
destinations such as Spain, France, USA, Italy and Portugal. Our 
audience for overseas property set new records in 2015 with 
searches up over 20% to 98 million and leads up by nearly 50%.
Our Commercial advertising business continues to 
grow with 55,000 properties now advertised. It has quickly 
established itself as the UK’s largest commercial property 
portal with engagement up strongly in the period as the 
number of commercial enquiries grew over 30% year on year.
Provide the most signiﬁ cant and effective exposure 
for customers’ brands and properties, be the largest 
source of high quality leads and offer high value-
adding products and packages.
We generated nearly 50 million leads for our customers, up 16% 
on last year, twice as many as our nearest competitor. The better 
quality of our leads continues to stand out as they convert to 
over four times
(4)
 as many sales and lets for our agency 
customers. This is the 15th successive year we have delivered 
increased exposure for our customers’ brands and properties. 
We provide indispensable support for home movers enabling 
them to feel conﬁ dent, inspired and more in control. This not 
only results in more consumers turning to Rightmove ﬁ rst and 
spending more time on Rightmove, but most importantly, 
generates more and better quality leads for our customers 
leading to better outcomes and value. 
We remain relentless in our focus to deliver the fastest, 
easiest to use and most engaging experience for home 
movers. At the core of our strategy is to have the largest, most 
up to date and richest property content together with the best 
search and research tools, and the most relevant content to 
support home movers in their journey. We are the digital 
advertising market leader in the UK for every major property 
category: sales; rentals; new homes; overseas and most 
recently commercial property.
This year Rightmove has become even more compelling to 
consumers and customers as we strengthened our position 
on both sides of the network. We are the only place to search 
and research virtually the whole property market in the UK and 
consumers can view nearly 50%
(1)
 more UK residential 
properties on Rightmove than on any other portal. Our 
property stock advantage coupled with our brand strength, 
innovation and expertise has substantially increased our 
audience size and engagement.
There were a record 1.3 billion visits to Rightmove in 2015, 
a year on year increase of 18%, and 17.5 billion pages of 
property content were viewed. With this substantial increase 
our share of trafﬁ c of the top four property portals has grown 
across the board
(2)
. Our audience is also compelling to people 
selling their homes with 85%
(3)
 now ranking us as the most 
important site for marketing their properties in a recent 
independent survey.
Trafﬁ c to our research tools grew signiﬁ cantly in 2015 as 
sellers and landlords turned to Rightmove ﬁ rst to help inform 
their decisions. Our research tools, such as sold prices, are 
by far the most widely used in the UK and provide the unique 
beneﬁ t of access to our unrivalled catalogue of current and 
archived properties. Consumers viewed over 350 million 
pages of research content on Rightmove in 2015 which is 
up by a third on the previous year.
Our culture of restlessness continues to drive improvement 
and innovation. In addition to the hundreds of updates to our

Winning the right to sell a property is the lifeblood of agents. Over 
a million home movers highlighted they had a property to sell when 
emailing an agent about another property , creating business 
opportunities for our customers. We also delivered nearly 200,000 
leads from people asking for a valuation on their home, for those 
customers who bought our Local Valuation Alert product. 
From our beginnings as a simple listings business we have 
developed additional advertising products and now provide our 
customers with a range of products to promote their brands 
and properties more strongly to gain a competitive edge.
We launched our ﬁ rst product in 2007 and we now have a 
suite of products across three categories: display advertising, 
property promotion and direct response. Product revenue 
now accounts for 42% of Agency and New Homes revenue 
with the remainder coming from listing fees. 
Revenue from products grew by 20% in 2015 to £73.9m. 
There is signiﬁ cant headroom to grow product revenue as we 
have the opportunity to increase the penetration of existing 
products, evolve their value and pricing, and continue to 
innovate and introduce new products as customers look to 
invest more to drive their brand exposure. 
This year average monthly revenue per advertiser (ARPA) 
increased by 10% with around two thirds of the ARPA growth 
driven by customers spending more on products and 
packages. ARPA has grown to over £750 as customers 
choose to spend more online and transition away from the 
historic use of newspapers where ARPA peaked at circa 
£2,500
(5)
 per month back in 2007.
Help drive operational efﬁ ciencies and empower 
customer decisions through software, data and insight.
Over the last 15 years Rightmove has helped drive signiﬁ cant 
efﬁ ciencies within the property industry by providing our 
customers with training, support and a suite of software as 
part of their membership to help them in the day to day 
running of their businesses.
For example, whereas previously our customers would 
have manually gathered valuation and comparable data, 
paid for printing and postage of property or development 
details and paid a third party to count ‘For Sale’ and ‘Sold’ 
advertising boards for market share information, they can 
now do this electronically. 
Using our software customers can:
�  Easily ﬁ nd a range of comparable properties from over one 
million properties currently advertised on Rightmove and 
from our archive of over 35 million properties advertised 
on Rightmove; 
�  Upload a new vendor’ s property onto Rightmove almost 
immediately and in the same instant alert relevant home movers 
from Rightmove’ s database of millions of registered users;
�  Easily see the level of interest in a property and provide 
independent market feedback to their vendors and landlords;
�  Monitor their market share and ranking versus their local 
competition;
�  Identify potential valuation opportunities faster and more 
efﬁ ciently;
�  See a map of lead activity by street in their local area to 
help target potential sellers and landlords; and
�  Ensure leads are dealt with effectively by using our lead 
reporting and call recording functionality. 
The digitalisation of the property industry and the efﬁ ciencies 
these tools bring helps to reduce cost per ofﬁ ce and has also 
enabled the growth in the number of agents. Over the last 
12 months our membership base has grown by over 2%. 
Our software products have become an integral part of the 
industry over many years of use and in a recent independent 
survey
(6)
 49% of agents said our software was ‘crucial’ to their 
business and would be hard to switch from with a further 39% 
saying it was ‘helpful’. Over 50% of agents also cited that our 
software makes them more efﬁ cient not just in marketing but in 
other areas of their business too. 
In 2015 we introduced the next wave of market share analysis 
tools to help our customers drive further business efﬁ ciencies and 
make better informed decisions. The new functionality and data, 
greater ﬂ exibility and unique ‘whole of market’ view has doubled 
agent use year on year. We are also delighted that the survey 
found that nearly 60% of agents place their trust in us and only use 
Rightmove portal software for their insights. 
We care about our customers’ business success and building 
strong relationships is vital to support their ambitions, especially 
in light of the signiﬁ cant digital changes taking place. T o that end 
we are spending more time with customers than ever before by 
expanding our account management team and increasing the

team’ s efﬁ ciency through better tools. We also continued our 
popular agent seminar programme which covers concepts 
such as brand building, targeting sellers and customer service 
in a digital world. Over 2,000 agents attended one of the 35 
seminars we ran across the UK in 2015 from Norwich to 
Swansea and from Truro to Inverness. 
To help all agents and developers realise the full beneﬁ t 
from Rightmove we also set up a telephone training team and 
expanded our webinar offering. Our webinars provide 
customers with an efﬁ cient way to learn about Rightmove 
and our software without leaving their ofﬁ ces. We ran over 
80 webinars in the year with 2,500 agents and developers 
attending with popular topics including Winning Landlords 
and The Ultimate Property Listing.
Build great teams and continue to make Rightmove a 
great place to work.
From the ﬁ rst Rightmove team of a dozen people to the current 
organisation of 435 we are always striving to create one team of 
Rightmovers with as few barriers as possible to rapid growth 
and innovation. We believe that this comes from a process-light, 
highly connected organisation with little constraining hierarchy 
and bureaucracy. T o enable this we need every Rightmover to 
be both individually empowered and accountable.
T o ensure we foster a highly connected organisation, we have 
taken care to create a physical environment that encourages 
open and honest discussion, including social spaces for the 
teams to enjoy each other’ s company. Our workplace is free 
from ofﬁ ces and the usual trappings of hierarchy.
We believe in sharing often and early and reinforce this 
through events such as ‘townhalls’ which share progress, 
successes and challenges. In June 2015 the whole Group spent 
a day and a night under canvas together building and reinforcing 
cross team connections. The culture is not solely built on these 
events, but also from the everyday small gestures and the 
authentic care Rightmovers have for one another. Everything 
together creates a unique, driven and quirky environment that we 
believe results in people feeling there’ s no place they’d rather be. 
By striving to make Rightmove a great place to work we can 
attract and retain the best talent and provide the best service 
for consumers and customers. 
Great talent and passion to perform is not enough to make a great 
Rightmover; the way in which we behave towards each other, our 
customers and partners is vital. How we go about our work is 
central to our recruitment, feedback and personal development 
processes. We also have a scheme to allow the team to recognise 
their peers who embody the behaviours we aspire to.
The biggest inﬂ uence in our restless and inquisitive culture, 
of course, comes from our people. Their actions and 
behaviours create the sense of belonging and connection 
and allows the business to continue to thrive and attract 
great people. In our 2015 ‘Have Your Say’ people survey, 
again over 90% of Rightmovers think it is a great place to work. 
To recognise employees who have been part of the journey 
with Rightmove for ten years we create a gnome in their image. 
I’m pleased that for such a young company, over 40 gnomes 
have pride of place in our ofﬁ ce. 
I am proud of the vibrant culture and business we have built 
together, I would like to thank everyone for everything they have 
done to achieve this and look forward to enjoying continued 
success in the future.
Current trading and outlook
The outlook for the UK online property advertising market remains 
positive as consumers and customers become ever more digital 
and the market continues to shift from traditional advertising 
channels. We are well positioned to beneﬁ t from this transition and 
with our market leading position strengthening, average spend per 
advertiser continuing to grow and record January trafﬁ c numbers, 
the Board remains conﬁ dent of making further progress in growing 
the business organically in 2016 and beyond.

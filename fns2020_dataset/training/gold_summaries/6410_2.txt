The digital market is still small and disparate, 
but GAME is taking a leading role in its 
evolution. Our pc download service has 
grown over the last three years, and helps us 
develop new services for digital customers.
•  GAME is the first video games retailer 
to have a branded presence in 
Playstation Home.
•  We are working with existing and new 
supplier partners to develop a GAME 
branded offer for customers across the 
digital arenas, giving customers a  
universal specialist proposition.
We have over 1,300 stores in ten countries. 
They are our principal channel to customers, 
generating over 90 per cent of our revenues. 
We are market leader in the UK, Spain and 
Czech Republic; joint leader in Scandinavia, 
and a leading specialist in France and 
Australia.
•  We continually review our portfolio to 
achieve the right footprint in each market. 
•  Our store formats are evolving to increase 
connectivity with our websites, to create 
more theatre, and to prepare for the 
launch of new technology before 
Christmas 2010.
Transactional websites support our stores  
in each territory. We offer customers the 
same value, extensive range of products and 
expert advice and service as in our stores.
•  The range of products was expanded 
in 2009 to include other home 
entertainment and electrical items.
•  Over the next two years we are introducing 
a new platform, called “websphere”, to 
provide seamless connectivity between all 
of our stores and websites.
•  We have launched a new social network
site Gamesnation to expand our reach to 
mass market gamers online.

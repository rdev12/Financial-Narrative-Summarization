Geoff Cooper Chairman
We continue to have great 
faith in our ‘Simply value for 
money’ proposition.
Once again Dunelm has delivered record sales and profits, 
despite the difficult conditions in which the business has had 
to operate. 
Tough trading conditions allow strong companies to 
prosper at the expense of weaker competitors. I believe that 
this will be the case for Dunelm. We continue to have great 
faith in our ‘simply value for money’ proposition and we 
expect customers to become increasingly aware of the 
value we offer.
I am pleased to report that we have converted profits into 
cash very successfully. As a result we have been able to 
reduce net debt significantly during the period so that the 
balance sheet is now substantially unleveraged. This means 
we have the financial strength to face difficult times with 
confidence, and the flexibility to take advantage of 
opportunities as they arise – such as the acquisition 
of the Dorma brand which we announced shortly after 
the year-end, as well as the ongoing expansion of the 
store portfolio.
The business has enjoyed a high level of stability in terms of 
Board membership for a number of years. However, during 
the year Bill Adderley has stepped down from his position as 
Non-Executive Director after reaching his 60th birthday. I am 
delighted we are able to recognise his role in establishing 
Dunelm by confirming his honorary position of Founder 
and Life President.

Results

I am pleased to report another year of good 
progress in 2015. Whilst Group revenue fell by 
2% to £1,562.4m (2014: £1,599.7m), primarily due 
to the completion of the Group’s largest ever 
contract, Wheatstone in Australia, towards the 
end of 2014, operating profit increased by 12% 
to £103.4m (2014: £92.0m), and profit before tax 
increased to £95.7m, up 12% on the previous 
year’s £85.1m. Earnings per share were 86.4p 
(2014: 75.3p).
The Group’s operating margin improved to 6.6% 
(2014: 5.8%), achieving our through-the-cycle 
target of 6.5%. Return on average capital 
employed increased from 18.3% to 20.5%. The 
margin uplift reflects a combination of improving 
conditions in certain markets, most notably the 
US from where Keller derives almost 50% of 
its revenue, further success in our drive for 
improvements in all aspects of the business 
and some good final project settlements. 
Cash generated from operations
2
 was £142.3m, 
which represents 92% of EBITDA. The Group 
remains focused on improving working capital 
ratios across the business and ensuring profits 
turn into cash. 
Year-end net debt was £183.0m (2014: £102.2m), 
representing 1.2x EBITDA. This increase reflects 
£52.5m spent on acquisitions during the year and 
a £27.5m cash outflow relating to the exceptional 
contract provision recognised in 2014. In addition, 
net capital expenditure of £69.9m was up on 
last year’s £61.0m and £17.8m in excess of 
depreciation and amortisation. This increase in 
capital expenditure results from the Group’s 
ongoing investment in higher growth markets.
The financial position of the Group remains 
very strong. There is comfortable headroom 
in the Group’s main financing facilities and we 
continue to operate well within all of our 
financial covenants.
Exceptional items
The 2015 result includes an exceptional non-cash 
charge of £31.2m relating to an impairment of 
the goodwill arising on the 2013 acquisition of 
Keller Canada. After taking account of tax and 
exceptional items, the Group’s post-tax result 
for the year was a profit of £26.3m (2014: loss 
of £1.2m).
Dividends
As a result of these improved results, the Board’s 
confidence in the business going forward and its 
commitment to a progressive dividend policy, the 
Board has decided to recommend a final dividend 
of 18.3p per share (2014: 16.8p per share), to be 
paid on 10 June 2016 to shareholders on the 
register at 20 May 2016. Together with the 
interim dividend paid of 8.8p, this brings the total 
dividend per share for the year to 27.1p (2014: 
25.2p), an increase of 7.5% for the year. Dividend 
cover, before exceptional items, for the full year 
was 3.2x (2014: 3.0x). 
Board 
On 26 September 2014, we announced that Justin 
Atkinson had decided to retire as Chief Executive. 
Justin retired on 14 May 2015 and was succeeded 
by Alain Michaelis. 
With a new Chief Executive now in place, 
I have decided that 2016 is the right time for 
me to retire as Chairman of the Board of 
Keller Group plc. 
I was appointed to the Board as a Non-executive 
Director in July 2007 and appointed Chairman of 
the Board in July 2009. I have led Keller through 
some challenging times since my appointment 
and am pleased to be leaving at a time when the 
Group is positioned for solid growth under a 
new executive leadership team. 
Paul Withers, Senior Independent Director, 
is leading the selection process for the new 
Chairman which is underway and making good 
progress. We will make an announcement on 
my successor in due course.
Employees
Over 10,000 employees have contributed to the 
strong performance of the Group during 2015. 
On behalf of the Directors, I would like to thank 
them for their hard work and efforts. The Board 
believes our people are a key component of our 
success and remains focused on providing 
leadership and oversight to engender the strength 
of the Keller culture, creating an environment in 
which our employees can thrive.
Outlook 
The 2015 results demonstrate the continued 
strength of the Group’s business. I am confident 
that the measures currently being implemented 
to improve operating performance, together with 
the organisational changes made under the new 
management team, will build on this strength.
The Group has performed well in 2015. We have 
been pleased to record another year of profit 
growth despite sales being lower as a result of 
less revenue from large projects. At the end of 
January, the Group order book of work to be 
undertaken over the next 12 months, including 
that of acquisitions, was 15% higher than at the 
same time last year, with increases in all Divisions. 
Whilst conditions in our markets are varied, the 
ongoing strength in the US, our largest market, 
continuing improvements in underlying operating 
performance, and our strong order book mean 
that the Group is set for another year of progress 
in 2016.

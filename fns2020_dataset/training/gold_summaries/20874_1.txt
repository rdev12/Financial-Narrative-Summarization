 Market outlook
The outlook for the mining sector has 
changed markedly over the past year, 
primarily due to a combination of 
Chinese production restrictions and 
improved macro-economic conditions. 
Whereas a year or so ago, people 
expected a negative macroeconomic 
environment, today the combination  
of supply restrictions and faster growth 
prospects has led to a much more 
optimistic outlook and a rapid rebound 
in equity prices. This also suggests that 
we are at the beginning of another 
multiyear cycle and that we need to 
accelerate our level of activities over 
the next year or two, as this should be  
a relatively favourable period to put 
capital to work in the sector.
With regards to the royalty and 
streaming markets, this about turn has 
significant implications. First, some of 
the very large bulk royalties we were 
working on during 2016 with the majors 
are unlikely now to materialise. The 
rebound in commodity prices is rapidly 
resulting in the deleveraging of their 
balance sheets so they have little need 
for further assistance and soon will be 
looking to expand again. There is still  
a lack of capital flowing to the sector 
and so there may be room in the 
coming mergers and acquisitions 
activity for royalty financing. However, 
more prospective is the mid-tier and 
development arena where the expected 
supply deficits as a result of consistent 
underinvestment in the sector should 
spur renewed investment in developing 
the next wave of projects for the future. 
We are, as a result, already seeing an 
uplift in activity and royalty financing 
opportunities for those seeking to 
engage in mergers and acquisitions  
or moving projects forward.
Coal outlook
Whilst we continue to diversify the 
portfolio away from Kestrel, coal, and  
in particular coking coal, continue to  
be a major area of exposure for your 
company. Whilst we suffered with lower 
coal prices in 2015, fortunately at a time 
when our share of Kestrel's production 
was also low, the recovery in coal pricing 
together with the growth in that share 
contributed significantly to our growth 
in 2016 and is expected to do the same 
this year. In that context, the outlook for 
coal continues to be important to us. 
The coal price has seen significant 
volatility over the past year, driven largely 
by restrictions on Chinese production in 
the autumn. This was part of a general 
trend to reduce poor quality coal 
production and consumption in China 
to improve air quality. The impact of this 
reduction in supply increased the price 
of energy or thermal coal by around a 
third in H2. The effect on the rarer form 
of coal which Kestrel produces, namely 
coking coal, was even more extreme 
and the spot price tripled. Subsequently 
over the Chinese winter, the authorities 
relaxed their restrictions and the price of 
thermal coal dropped by 20%, with the 
spot price of coking coal almost halving. 
It is worth noting that coking coal prices 
nevertheless remain roughly double  
the level of a year ago. 
Looking forward, we expect the 
direction of travel to remain unchanged 
i.e. continued Chinese volume 
reductions. It is possible that further 
restrictions will be imposed during Q2 
after the Chinese winter which in turn 
will send prices back up. However, we 
are making much more conservative 
assumptions in our internal forecasts 
and assume prices average slightly less 
than current spot levels for the year. 
What is important is that the 
environment for coal has changed  
and prices are unlikely to return to  
their previous low levels.
Shareholders should note that we are 
well positioned in coal with royalties on 
modern mines in safe locations and 
exposure to high quality, cleaner coals. 
Denison financing  
and streaming agreements
Though this transaction was announced 
early in 2017, we had been working  
on it for much of last year. As the case 
study presented on � pages 10 and 11 
highlights, it is a transaction which should 
provide a stable long-term stream of 
income with some upside. Shareholders 
should expect to see the positive effects 
of the Denison transaction start to  
come through in our results from Q1  
of this year.
Reflecting the different structure of the 
Denison transaction, where income will 
be derived in part from the repayment of 
debt, we are now introducing a new KPI 
in the form of cash generation which we 
believe will be a more accurate measure 
of progress going forward than earnings.
We expect to execute on further 
transactions in the year ahead, though 
the structure of the Denison transaction 
was a one off and future deals should be 
more in the form of traditional royalties 
and streams.
STRATEGIC REPORT 
Chief Executive 
Officer’s 
statement
I am pleased to 
report that 
royalty income 
grew strongly in 
2016 and is 
expected to do so 
again this year. 
The result was 
strong growth in 
profits, dividend 
cover and net 
asset value.

Anglo Pacific Group Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2016 08 New strategy
Although our main focus will continue 
to be on immediately revenue 
producing royalties, we announced 
early in the year that we were 
broadening our investment mandate  
to include development royalties.  
These could take up to a decade to bring 
into development, should generate 
higher returns, given the development 
risk, and have the potential to increase  
in value significantly in the coming 
years. The size of these investments  
is unlikely to exceed US$20m and the 
intention is to fund them primarily  
from retained earnings.
Dividend
The recovery in our earnings has 
significantly improved our dividend 
cover and it is pleasing that this 
exceeded 1.6x last year. With further 
improvement expected this year, there 
should be scope for dividend increases 
on a prudent and progressive basis. 
However, the levels of our earnings are 
in turn driven by the price of coking coal 
and this has been extremely volatile of 
late. Barring a transformational large 
transaction which fundamentally alters 
this relationship, your Board therefore 
intends to await the outcome of the first 
half of the year before considering any 
alterations to dividend levels. Any new 
level of dividends announced needs to 
be a new base from which we can 
comfortably grow in the years ahead.  
Taxation
Assisted in part by the disposal of our 
Isua royalty, announced with the year 
end results, we have created significant 
tax losses. These should reduce our tax 
charge in the coming year, more than 
we had previously indicated to the 
market. We also have significant capital 
losses, some of which were used to 
shield against our equity profits in the 
current period, and which hopefully  
will be utilised during this cycle.
Currencies
The weakening of sterling as a result  
of the EU referendum has had the effect 
of increasing our income and profits.  
In order to maintain this benefit, we have 
instituted a rolling hedging program 
over part of our income, hedging against 
the main currencies in which our 
income is denominated. As at year end, 
this program had generated £0.7m of 
additional income.
Central costs
Central costs continued to be well 
controlled. One of the virtues of the 
Anglo Pacific model is that overheads 
do not increase in line with income, 
providing additional operating leverage. 
This proved to be the case in 2016 
where income slightly more than 
doubled but operating profits rose 
almost six fold.
Financial resources
We are pleased to have repaid 
significant amounts of our borrowings 
last year and took advantage of the 
Denison opportunity to renew our 
borrowing facilities and extend them.  
If we had not invested in Denison, we 
would have been debt free by the end 
of Q1 2017. With our much higher 
income levels, we expect the new debt 
assumed for Denison to be repaid in 
short order leaving our new facility 
available for new acquisitions. This, 
together with our equity portfolio and 
income, provides considerable 
firepower for new deals. We intend to  
be prudent with regards to debt levels, 
with the intention of not exceeding 2x 
free cash flow and generally operating 
well below this level. 
Net assets and share price
The increase in net asset value per 
share to 124p after the payment of 6p 
of dividends during the year is good 
news for all shareholders. The share 
price has recovered along with the 
sector and provides us with a better 
currency to move forward. However, it 
continues to trade at a discount to what 
we consider to be the true net asset 
value, and gives no credit for those 
assets in our portfolio which we believe 
have increased in value considerably 
since we acquired them and which is 
not reflected on the balance sheet.
Our shares continue to provide a much 
higher dividend yield than our global 
peers and we hope that the process of 
rerating will continue during the year.  
We were gratified that approximately 20 
new institutional investors joined the 
register with the Denison transaction  
and we welcome these new shareholders 
on board.
Board developments
I would like to take the opportunity to 
pay tribute to the chairmanship of Mike 
Blyth over the past few years. He has 
made a significant difference to the way 
the Company is run and governed, 
instigating a series of disciplines and 
controls which reflect best practice, and 
which should stand us in good stead for 
the years ahead. We are fortunate that 
he has decided to retain his presence  
on the Board.
I look forward to working closely with 
Patrick Meier in the years ahead to take 
the Company to a new level.
Outlook
In summary we have moved forward 
significantly over the past 12 months 
and are now in the fortunate position of 
having the resources to take advantage 
of being in the early stages of the 
upcycle. We expect this progress to 
continue during 2017, both from 
organic growth and new acquisitions.

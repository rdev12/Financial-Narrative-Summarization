Regus Report & Accounts 2006 02
Operating profit has increased by 73.8% while 
at the same time we have grown the scale of 
our business measured in workstations by 
45.4% year on year. This profitable growth 
and our strong cash conversion has enabled 
the Group to fund its expansion plans with 
minimal external funding. Net cash was  
£23.4 million at 31 December 2006 (2005: 
£36.0 million). 
In an industry where size and scale are  
critical in order to provide customers with the 
greatest range of product, service and price 
offerings and achieve operating efficiencies, 
our network at 31 December 2006 consisted 
of 790 centres in 64 countries, operating  
under the respected Regus and HQ brands.
f inancial performance
Group revenue has increased by 46.8% to £680.0 million and gross profit 
by 57.1% to £184.1 million. Excluding the impact of new centre growth the 
like for like improvement was 9.0% and 29.1% respectively. This overall 
result was driven by average occupancy increasing to 81.8% from 78.0% in 
2005 and REVPAW increasing 7.6% from £5,890 to £6,340. Earnings (profit 
after tax) grew by 83.7% to £82.3 million and basic earnings per share (EPS) 
increased by 3.9p to 8.4p.  
On 13 March 2006, we signed a new £100 million five-year revolving credit 
and letter of credit facility and in April added £50 million of term debt. The 
latter was used to finance the acquisition of the UK business. The new facilities 
have been negotiated on significantly more favourable terms, reflecting the 
strong financial progress the business has made over the last two years.  
This year’s results are 
a testament to Regus’
strong business model. 03 Regus Report & Accounts 2006
Our strategy remains one of 
controlled and disciplined 
growth with the aim to be 
number one in all the markets 
in which we operate.
Sustaining growth
We continue to implement our controlled and disciplined expansion strategy. 
To supplement our strong organic growth, during the financial year we  
acquired 28 businesses for a net consideration of £88.5 million. These  
businesses have all been successfully integrated into the Regus network.  
In the year to 31 December 2006 our workstation capacity increased in line 
with our expansion plans by 45.4% to 120,108 workstations (December 
2005: 82,586 workstations) with the acquisition of Regus UK accounting  
for around 25,000 workstations.  
Dividend
Given the robust performance and positive outlook we are pleased to  
announce that Regus will be paying a dividend. Subject to the approval of 
shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the final dividend 
of 0.6p will be paid on 1 June 2007 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 27 April 2007.  
The Group continues to monitor its capital structure and retains flexibility  
to repurchase its shares in the market place should surplus cash resources 
be available.
Corporate Responsibility
The Board believes that the integration of Corporate Responsibility through-
out the business and the incorporation of broader social and environmental 
issues into day to day decision making will benefit all our key stakeholders 
and better enable us to achieve our target levels of performance. This year 
we will set up a formal Corporate Responsibility Committee to oversee CR 
strategy. The Committee’s aim is to ensure that we take a sustainable  
approach to business – to do the right thing for our shareholders, our  
customers, our suppliers, the community and the world around us.
We will be commissioning a series of initiatives to reduce energy  
consumption. Through our virtual office and video conferencing services we 
will continue to promote teleworking and therefore support a longer term 
approach to tackling the impact of climate change on the environment.
Our stakeholders
We rely on the goodwill and commitment of our landlords, suppliers,  
customers and investors as we continue to maintain our record of double 
digit sales growth since 2003. The commitment, loyalty and efforts of our 
team members have played a key role in our success. Our people are 
integral to differentiating Regus from our competitors and maintaining the 
Company’s position as the international leader in outsourced workplace 
solutions.  
Outlook
Our strategy remains one of controlled and disciplined growth with the aim 
to be number one in all the markets in which we operate. This well proven 
strategy has resulted in our third year of consistent growth, both organically 
and through acquisitions, and we expect this to continue.  
We will continue to open centres wherever our research indicates there  
is a profitable opportunity to increase our geographic footprint and better 
serve our customers. In addition, we will continue to acquire complementary 
businesses, which meet our strict investment criteria, enabling us to move 
into new markets and develop a wider customer base.

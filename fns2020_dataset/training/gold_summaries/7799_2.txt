Ilika at a glance
Ilika’s unique process is far quicker and more efficient than traditional materials 
discovery processes. 
Ilika uses high-throughput, or combinatorial, techniques which involve the rapid 
synthesis of a large number of different structurally related materials  
in a few automated steps.
How we generate growth
Early	 engagement	 	
of	 large	 multinational	
partners	 which	 	
co-	 fund	 the	 route	 to	
commercialisation
Rapid	 discovery	 of	 	
new	 materials
Existing	 commercial	
agreements	 underpin	
revenue,	 strong	
pipeline	 in	 place,	 IP	
value	 amplification	
opportunities
Our key differentiators
High throughput materials discovery
>  10–100x faster and more reliable than traditional discovery methods
>  Creates output equivalent to 100s of individual materials
> Unique patent-protected platform
>  Rapid identification of materials suitable for industrial scale-up
Combinatorial synthesis
Ilika’s High Throughput Physical 
Vapour Deposition (‘HT-PVD’) facility 
can deposit large numbers of films 
of different composition in one 
automated experimental run. The 
deposition of all elements occurs 
simultaneously and the composition 
profile can be carefully varied across 
the substrate in a controlled manner.
Characterisation/screening
Large numbers of samples are 
screened and characterised using 
automated, high throughput 
techniques. Unique sample 
arrays allow the many different 
compositions synthesised to be 
analysed in a rapid manner for 
specific, sought-after, behaviours.
Informatics
A range of specialised, 
in-house software controls the 
instrumentation associated with 
our workflows and also enables 
the rapid, simultaneous collection 
of large datasets which are then 
processed, analysed and presented 
so that meaningful conclusions 
about material properties can  
be drawn. 03

Key products
Shipments	of	fuel	cells	continue	to 	
be	 dominated	 by	 proton	 exchange	
membrane	('PEM')	technology, 	
which	grew	87	percent 	in 	
2011	compared	to	2010.	 The	
technology	is	dependent 	on 	
platinum	containing	electrodes, 	
which	are	the	most 	expensive 	
components	in	the	fuel	cells.
It	is	widely	recognised	that	cost	reduction 	
of	these	electrodes	is	necessary	to	enable 	
widespread	commercialisation	of	PEM 	
technology.
Ilika’s	proprietary	low	cost	catalysts	have 	
been	tested	by	an	independent	fuel	cell 	
testing	company	and	material	transfer 	
agreements	are	now	in	place	with	the 	
global	top	three	automotive	manufacturers. 	
Fuel cell catalysts
The	market 	for	lithium-ion 	
batteries	is	being	driven	today 	
by	demand	for	consumer 	
electronics,	but 	the	car 	
makers	are	also	adopting	the 	
technology	for	hybrid	electric 	
vehicles.
In	order	to	deliver	the	fuel	economy 	
benefits	of	hybrid	and	electric	vehicles, 	
batteries	are	required	which	can	store 	
energy	in	a	small	volume,	but	can	also 	
charge	and	discharge	rapidly	while 	
remaining	 safe.
Ilika	has	worked	with	Toyota	since	2008 	
on	the	development	of	novel	battery 	
chemistries	that	can	fulfill 	 	
these	 objectives.

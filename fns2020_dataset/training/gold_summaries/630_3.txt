Alexandra is now in its twentieth
year as a listed company and in
my first full year as Chairman it is
particularly pleasing for me to
announce that the Company
delivered profitable sales growth
during the financial year ended
2004/5. Operating profit grew
7.4% to £5.64 million from a
turnover increase of 0.4%,
producing an 11.5% rise in
adjusted earnings per share to
9.7 pence (2003/4: 8.7 pence). 
This return to top line and further
bottom line growth marked the
culmination of the transformation
of the business from domestic
workwear supply to globally
procured corporate and
occupational clothing across a
wide range of industrial and
commercial sectors.
The improvement in profitability
in a competitive market was
achieved through strict
management of the supply chain
that allowed the gross margin
percentage to rise, productivity
and efficiency gains in operational
activities and the continued
reduction in interest charges. 
Cash flow from operations was
up 8.9% at £9.1 million (2003/4:
£8.4 million) and gearing was
reduced to 36% at the year end
(2003/4: 48%), enabling the long
term Group target of 40% to be
beaten.
We are pleased to report that the
purchase of Prima Corporate
Wear (“Prima”) was completed
on 26 April 2005 for a
consideration of £3.99 million.
This move demonstrates the
successful completion of the
business transformation that
enables Alexandra to enact its
corporate strategy of growing
both organically and by
acquisition. Prima will increase
the customer base, strengthen
our market position in the
security and transport sectors and
add to the bottom line.
These strong results reflect the
underlying strength of the
Alexandra business model allied
with an unwavering commitment

Dividend
The Board is proposing a final
dividend of 3.5 pence per share
(2003/4: 3.3 pence) which,
together with the interim
dividend of 1.8 pence (2003/4:
1.7 pence), makes a total
dividend for the year of 5.3
pence, an increase of 6% on the
total of 5.0 pence paid last year.
This continues the Company’s
progressive dividend policy and
maintains dividend cover at 1.8
times. If approved at the AGM on
28 June 2005 the final dividend
will be paid on 8 July 2005 to
Shareholders on the register at 10
June 2005.
Board changes
Alexandra has continued to
strengthen its executive
management team throughout
the last year. 
Ken Gibbs joined the Board as
Finance Director in July 2004.
Ken was hired in March 2004 as
Corporate Planning Director
(designate), having previously
worked in a number of senior
financial roles within Hewlett
Packard. Ken replaced Richard
Michell who has left the
Company and we wish him well
in the future. 
James Tucker was promoted to
the Board as Sales Director in
February 2005. Previously James
was Head of Sales, having joined
the Company from Dixons in 2003.
As notified in December 2004,
Raees Lakhani resigned his
position as Commercial Director
and will not be replaced. Raees
contributed to the transformation
of the business from in-house
manufacture to out-sourced
global procurement.
Staff
The quality of the staff across all
functions within the business
underpins our success and is an
ongoing strength of the business.
Their enthusiasm and
commitment to our customers’
needs has been instrumental in
delivering the results achieved.
The Board would like to thank
them for their hard work and
dedication throughout the year. 
Current trading and outlook
Current trading continues to be
satisfactory. 
The market will remain
competitive but the Board
believes the Group is well
positioned to build on the
profitable growth achieved last
year.  The focus of the sales team 
on large corporate accounts has
resulted in the signing of new
prestigious accounts, including
McDonalds and Shell. These will
produce turnover for the first
time in 2005/6 and will
contribute to organic growth.
The enhanced management team
is focused on delivering excellent
products and customer service to
this strengthened portfolio of
customers. 
Inflationary pressures on costs, in
particular oil price increases, will
be offset by the productivity gains
achieved during 2004/5. 
The successful integration of Prima
and the search for additional
acquisition opportunities will be high
priorities to further enhance
turnover and profit.
Chris A. Marsh
Chairman
We understand how important it is to our
customers to receive their packages on time, so
we track them 24 hours a day.

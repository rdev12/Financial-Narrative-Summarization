Our business in brief
Our business is based in pan-America, 
a region consisting of the countries which 
lie in and around the Caribbean basin. 
Where we operate
We can trace our involvement in the region back to 
the 1870s and have been supporting the development 
of its telecoms infrastructure since that time.
We control 14 businesses within the Caribbean, with 
the largest markets being Jamaica, The Bahamas and 
Barbados. We also hold a minority stake in TSTT in 
Trinidad and Tobago. In Central America we are the 
leading operator in Panama. 
Across the region we have an extensive grid of 
sub-sea cable networks and sell carrier services 
in 40 countries. 
We are also the majority shareholder in Monaco 
Telecom, Monaco’s leading telecoms operator.

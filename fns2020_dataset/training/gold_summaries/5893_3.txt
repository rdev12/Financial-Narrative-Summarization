 Chairman’s Statement
2 Fenner PLC
Following a solid first half performance, Group profit before tax for the
year increased 88% to £12.0m. We have benefited from an
unprecedented worldwide demand for energy particularly in China.
Our capital expenditure and rationalisation programmes have created
opportunities for productivity improvements throughout our operations.  
The acquisition of Wellington Holdings plc (“Wellington”) in May
has provided a valuable addition to our niche precision polymer
businesses. Our strengthened balance sheet leaves us well placed to
exploit these opportunities.
We are encouraged by our
strong start to the year and 
by current positive
indications for the future.

Chairman
TURNOVER AND
PROFITS
Group turnover increased
20% to £313.0m (2004
£260.6m) which includes £10.8m from the former Wellington businesses acquired on 20 May
2005. Turnover growth in our underlying businesses amounted to 16% reflecting the strong
recovery in the heavyweight belting market driven by global energy demands.  
Group operating profit for the year before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
amounted to £21.3m (2004 £16.1m) including £1.9m from the former Wellington businesses.
After goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, Group operating profit amounted to
£15.8m (2004 £8.7m).
Turnover for the second half year reached £171.7m (2004 £139.8m) generating an
operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of £14.7m (2004 £10.6m)
reflecting a strong second half performance characteristic of the markets in which the Group
operates.
Following an improved first half performance, our heavyweight belting businesses made
further progress building on the significant volume recovery particularly in North America.
Despite intense raw material price pressures, profit margins have continued to improve. 
The Precision Polymers businesses in both the UK and North America have performed
well, benefiting from a recovery in levels of industrial activity. 
The former Wellington businesses outperformed our expectations during the final
quarter of our financial year.
Exceptional items of £3.5m (2004 £6.2m) principally arose from impairment costs,
giving a Group profit before tax of £12.0m (2004 £6.4m). As a result of the much improved
operating performance, Group earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items increased to 9.34p per share (2004 7.67p) and after goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items to 5.28p (2004 2.19p).

DIVIDENDS
The Board recommends a final dividend maintained at 3.85p, which, together with the
interim dividend of 1.975p, represents a total for the year of 5.825p (2004 5.825p). The
underlying dividend cover is 1.6 after adjusting for goodwill amortisation, exceptional items
and the element relating to shares that were only in issue for three months of the year.
CASH RESOURCES AND INVESTMENT
We have raised a net £56.3m from shareholders during the year. £45.7m was invested in the
Wellington acquisition. The balance was applied to reducing our
existing debt levels whilst we examine the opportunities available
for further investment. Net borrowings at the year end amounted
to £33.9m (2004 £39.4m).
PEOPLE
The progress in improving our margin returns is a demonstration of the commitment by all
our employees, whom I thank for their efforts in this regard.
Our AGM in January 2006 will mark the retirement from the Board of Tom Glucklich,
who has been a non-executive director of the Company for over 10 years. I would like to
take this opportunity to thank Tom for his support and intellectual contribution during that
period and to wish him every success for the future.
I am pleased to announce the appointment on 1 November 2005 of David Campbell as
a non-executive director of the Company.  David was formerly Chief Executive of British Vita
PLC and following the retirement of Tom Glucklich in January 2006, will chair the Company’s
Remuneration Committee.
OUTLOOK
We have made a strong start to the new year with many of our markets showing continuing,
robust strength. A buoyant energy sector has been a significant factor
in our recent growth and the confidence of our customers in this area is
an encouraging sign. Asian demand has provided the opportunity for
further new developments as the region becomes a more significant
part of the Group. Overall we look forward to another year of healthy
progress as we consolidate the benefits of our acquisition strategy.

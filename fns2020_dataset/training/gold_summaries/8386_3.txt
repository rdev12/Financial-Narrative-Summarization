 12 Invensys plc Annual report + accounts 2007
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
We now have a clear strategy in place
that should enable Invensys to become
a high performing, sustainable and
cohesive business.
I am very pleased to report that Invensys has made further
significant progress during the past year in continuing the
turnaround in its performance. For the Group as a whole, we
increased orders, revenue, operating profit and in particular
operating cash flow which, together with the 2006 Refinancing,
resulted in a significant reduction in the level of net debt at
the year end. Our net debt is now £166 million compared with
£1,556 million around the time I joined the Board in 2003. In
the same period, our pension fund deficit has reduced from
£931 million to £522 million and our other legacy liabilities
have fallen from £700 million to £95 million.
On behalf of the Board and everyone within Invensys, I would
like to thank our shareholders, bankers and advisors for their
tremendous support for the 2006 Refinancing, details of which
I explained to you in my Statement in last year’s Annual report.
It was completed successfully and we are now benefiting from
the expected significant reduction in finance costs and the greater
confidence being shown by all our stakeholders in the future stability
of the Group. We also anticipated that the 2006 Refinancing would
provide us with an improved platform for growth and our Chief
Executive, Ulf Henriksson, explains in his Statement the progress
that we have already made and his plans to ensure that each of
our businesses continue to improve their performance.
After the difficulties that we have experienced in recent years, it is
encouraging to see that we now have a clear strategy in place that
should enable Invensys to become a high performing, sustainable
and cohesive business. The Board has taken a great interest in the
development of the strategic plans by the executive teams for each
of the businesses and the Group as a whole and we believe that we
now have the right strategy and the right leadership team to take
Invensys to the next stage. The Board is also pleased to see the
progress that we have made in addressing ethical, social and
environmental issues so that we act as a good corporate citizen
across the world.

7% at CER to £2,562 million. Operating profit before exceptional
items was up 30% at CER to £241 million, resulting in an operating
margin of 9.4% (2006: 7.8%).
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations were
10.1 pence per share (2006: 6.2 pence loss per share). The Board
is recommending that no dividend be paid for the year ended
31 March 2007 (2006: nil).
For the second year in succession, we produced a strong cash
performance with operating cash flow from continuing operations
of £266 million (2006: £209 million), representing cash conversion
of 110% (2006: 109%). For the first time in three years, free cash
flow was positive at £93 million (2006: £75 million outflow), which
together with the 2006 Refinancing, resulted in a very substantial
reduction in year end net debt to £166 million (2006: £757 million).
I believe that the combination of Ulf’s leadership and the hard work
by everyone across the Group has been the major factor in achieving
this improvement in performance and I would like to thank everyone
in Invensys for their contribution to a very successful year.
The Board
Pasquale (Pat) Zito joined the Board as a non-executive director on
23 May 2007. Pat is President of the worldwide automotive original
equipment and aftermarket operations of Pilkington Group Ltd, one
of the world’s largest manufacturers of glass and glazing products for
the building and automotive markets and now part of Nippon Sheet
Glass Company. He joined Pilkington in 1985 as finance director of
the Group’s Australian operations. He became President, Automotive
OE Europe in 1997 and was appointed to the Board of Pilkington plc
in 2002. He will be joining the Remuneration and Audit Committees.
As mentioned in my Statement last year, Adrian Hennah resigned
on 16 June 2006 and Steve Hare joined the Board as Chief Financial
Officer on 21 July 2006. Also Michael Parker joined the Board on
24 May 2006 and Larry Farmer and Andrew Macfarlane retired
from the Board on 3 August 2006.
Outlook
During the new financial year, we expect that market conditions
in our long cycle businesses will remain generally positive but that
the markets for Controls will continue to be uncertain for some
time. Our actions to improve productivity will allow increased
funding for research and development and sales and marketing.
Overall the Board is confident that the Group will make further
progress in the year ending 31 March 2008.

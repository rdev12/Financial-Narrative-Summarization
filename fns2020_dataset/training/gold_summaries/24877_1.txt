 Strategic objectives
Our strategy continues to be to support our 
customers’ brands and their development 
in local markets, whilst achieving attractive 
and sustainable rates of growth in value 
for our shareholders. This straightforward 
approach has generated growth over 
an extended period of time and, with a 
strong reputation, well invested modern 
facilities and a robust balance sheet, the 
Group remains well positioned to achieve 
continuing progress.
Hilton seeks to build long term customer 
and shareholder value by focusing on:
 – Growing volumes and extending product 
ranges supplied and services provided to 
its existing customers;
 – Optimising the use of its assets and 
investing in new technology and 
capacity expansion as required;
 – Maintaining a vigilant focus on food 
safety and integrity and reducing unit 
costs, while improving product quality 
and service provision; and
 – Entering new territories and markets 
either with new customers or in 
partnership with our existing customers.

improvement and development of 
our racecourse assets

I am delighted to report that Arena Leisure Plc (‘Arena’) 
has produced very good trading results this year through
concentrating its energies on driving its racecourse business
forward and investing in its racecourse assets. We have
withdrawn from our involvement in software development 
and together with our 47.5% partner, British Sky Broadcasting
(‘BSkyB’) have put At The Races, the media rights company , 
on a sound business and ﬁnancial footing.
Results for the year ended 31 December 2004
The results for the year highlight the signiﬁcant strides that
your Company has made. Turnover increased by 9% to £37.3m
(2003: £34.3m). Group operating proﬁt before exceptional items
reduced by 13% to £5.3m (2003: £6.1m) due to closure of Arena
Online. After deducting the losses incurred by At The Races,
pre-tax proﬁt amounts to £0.2m compared to a loss of £42.0m 
in 2003. A tax credit of £5.1m, principally in respect of At The
Races consortium relief, brings proﬁt after tax to £5.3m
(2003: £42.2m loss). Basic and diluted earnings per share 
were 1.5 pence (2003: loss per share 11.7 pence).
Chairman’s statement
‘I am delighted to 
report excellent
progress at Arena
Leisure and I am
particularly pleased
that we are able to 
pay our shareholders 
a maiden dividend.’
Roger D Withers  Outlook
Arena is increasingly focused on the long-term growth of its
racecourse assets and the distribution of media rights through
the increasing variety of media and technology platforms both
nationally and internationally .
We have seen a good start to the ﬁnancial year, we are 
currently trading ahead of expectations and we have excellent
opportunities for growth and further development of our assets.
With your company building on the successes of 2004, and with
low levels of bank debt and gearing, we approach the future
with conﬁdence.

consists of two executive directors, two non-executive directors,
myself as Chairman, with the Company Secretary who is also
our Chief Financial Ofﬁcer.

such good progress this year.

 In the period to the end of the financial
year, and subsequently, I have visited
all of our subsidiary businesses, met
our senior staff and visited a large
number of our projects. These visits
have enabled me to undertake a
detailed assessment of the
performance and prospects for each
business. The majority of the Group’s
businesses have been profitable for
many years and trade under 
well-respected and long-standing
brand identities operating in selected
markets, defined by specialist activity,
regional knowledge and experience.
This review process has enabled me
to gain a full understanding of the
Group’s businesses and agree with 
the Board a strategy for the Group
going forward. This is fundamentally 
a development of the Group strategy
which was implemented last year,
focusing on the specialisms of our
constituent brands which sets them
apart from others in the market.
As mentioned in the Chairman’s
Statement the Group’s name has been
changed to Renew Holdings plc to
better reflect this strategy.
The Group’s specialist areas of 
activity are: 
Land remediation
Nuclear decommissioning
Social housing
High quality residential
Structural refurbishment
Restoration
Retail
Science and Education
Rail infrastructure
These markets have good future
prospects and the Board will look 
to grow the Group’s operations in
each while building on client
relationships which have been
developed over many years. All the
Group’s businesses will continue
developing these relationships 
to ensure longer term working
arrangements and increased repeat
and negotiated business.  
Key to the Group’s strategic objectives
is having an effective and efficient
executive control in place. I have
formed an Executive Management
Committee comprising the Managing
Directors of the subsidiary businesses,
who will all report directly to me. This
new committee will co-ordinate the
strategy, across the Group, sharing
knowledge and best practice, and
continue to implement key processes
to ensure that we effectively manage
all our risks and safely deliver high
quality services.
In addition, control will be enhanced
by regular visits to the individual
businesses by me and my senior
financial and commercial colleagues 
to ensure that all controls are being
implemented and that Group policies
are communicated widely.
The specialist differentiators within 
the Group give us an excellent
opportunity to develop the business
further and I am confident that we 
will deliver reliable and growing profits
in the years ahead.

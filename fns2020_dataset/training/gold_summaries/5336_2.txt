>  Contracted recurring revenues remain strong representing 80% 
of total revenue (2013: 77%)
>  Hosting revenues continue to increase and now represent 52% 
of total revenues (2013: 48%) demonstrating the success of 
our strategy to grow the hosting/cloud side of the business

opportunities and the overall cash position at the time. However, 
in view of the Company’s relatively large cash balances and as 
reported at the half year results, it is the Board’s current intention 
to pay an interim dividend of 2p per share and a final dividend 
of 3p per share in future years

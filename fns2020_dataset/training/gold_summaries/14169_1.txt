 OVERVIEW FOR THE 12 MONTHS
I am pleased to announce Shed’s final results covering the 12 months to 31 December 2009.
During the period, turnover increased to £92.6m from £81.9m, up 13%. Gross profit is up by 4% to £32.1m
(2008: £31.0m) and adjusted operating profit
1
is up 1% to £14.7m (2008: £14.5m).
Gross margins have been under pressure this year at 35% (2008: 38%) due to a combination of tighter
production budgets, lower margins on high value US commissions and a slight fall in intellectual property
gross profit. At an adjusted operating level
1
, our margins have dropped from 18% to 16%, mainly due to the
investment we have made in our US business. This remains significantly above the industry average
operating margin of 8.2%*.
The Group delivered 250 hours of programming, up from 215 hours in 2008. 35 hours were drama and 215
were factual. Programmes included Waterloo Road series 5, New Tricks series 6, Who Do You Think You Are?
series 7 and Supernanny US series 6.
The Group is now working with 23 different broadcasters including, for the first time, two webcasters.
Shed continues to be known for the quality of its output and in the period the Group won many awards
including: an Oscar, 2 BAFTAS, 1 RTS, 1 Broadcast Award, 1 BANFF, 2 TV Quick Awards, and Wall to Wall
was voted Best Indie by its peers.
Business in the US has again grown strongly with 100 hours delivered (2008: 64). Current brands continue
to perform and there have been significant new business wins for US home-grown product.
Shed’s in-house distribution arm, Outright, has performed well, successfully distributing Shed content and
growing its third party business. The Group’s IP exploitation accounted for 42% of the Group’s gross
profit (2008: 44%).
UK Business
The UK commissioning environment continued to be challenging in 2009.
Against a backdrop of the worst advertising recession in a generation and, in the BBC, a public broadcaster
looking for across the board savings in programme costs, Shed performed extremely well. UK programme
revenue was £40.2m (2008: £43.1m) and we delivered 151 hours (2008: 151 hours).
Shed Productions’ stand-out drama, Waterloo Road, went from strength to strength with 26 hours delivered
in the period for BBC One.
Ricochet’s output included Blood Sweat and Takeaways (4 x 60’ BBC3), The Real Swiss Family Robinson (4 x 60’
BBC One), Born To Be Different (2 x 60’ Channel 4) and Cowboy Builders (12 x 60’ Five).
Twenty Twenty produced the drama Garrow’s Law (4 x 60’ BBC One), the award winning The Choir:
Unsung Town (4 x 60’ BBC2), World’s Strictest Parents 2 (10 x 60’ BBC3) and the Sorcerer’s Apprentice 2
(20 x 60’ BBC One).
Wall to Wall delivered New Tricks series six (8 x 60’) and series seven of the celebrity genealogy show, Who
Do You Think You Are? (5 x 60’) both for BBC One. Amongst the other highlights were Electric Dreams
(3 x 60’ BBC Four) and Sea Patrol (6 x 60’ Five and National Geographic).
Since the year end, major commissions and re-commissions for delivery in 2010 included a seventh series of
Shed Productions’ Waterloo Road (20 x 60’).

US Business
During 2009, we consolidated all our production assets in the US under one brand, Shed Media US. The
company produced 100 hours of programming (up 56% on 2008) for eight different broadcasters.
Returning brands included a sixth series of Supernanny US (13 x 60’ ABC), the third season of Real
Housewives of New York City (12 x 60’ Bravo), season 2 of It’s Me or the Dog (30 x 60’ Animal Planet) and
World’s Strictest Parents US 2 (10 x 60’ CMT).
New programmes commissioned or made in the period include Who Do You Think You Are? (7 x 60’ NBC),
The Marriage Ref (8 x 60’ NBC), and Thintervention (8 x 60’).
Since the year end, production has begun on Bethenny’s Getting Married (8 x 60’ Bravo) and NBA Wives
(8 x 30’ VH1).
Outlook
Three months into our current financial year and the Group has secured 64% of its production revenue
target (72% in the UK and 50% in the US) and 68% of its IP gross profit target.
Last year, we continued to invest in the expansion of our US operation and we expect that investment will
continue to fuel the growth in America. In the UK, we have made a substantial commitment to our Scottish
office which will begin to provide a return in 2010.
Revenue from the Group’s intellectual property will continue to grow as our library of content expands
and in 2010 we expect to see some recovery in the market for drama sales. We have made a commitment
to grow Outright’s third party content in 2010, which will require investment that will see returns in 2011
and beyond.
The Group had a good 2009 and we have had a good start to 2010. As ever, our talented and experienced
team will be working hard to create, produce and distribute the new brands of the future.

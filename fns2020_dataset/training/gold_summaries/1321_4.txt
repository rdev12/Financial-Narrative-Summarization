management market through
organic growth and the acquisition

Pharmacy
The Hospital & Retail Pharmacy
market continues to offer strong
growth opportunities. The Audit
Commission’s ‘Spoonful of Sugar’
report raised several concerns
around the management of
medicines, which can be addressed
with IT solutions. With clients in the
UK, the Far East & Australasia, the
company has seen a marked
increase in the demand for IT
solutions that can be delivered
today and that will integrate with
future health service requirements.
Mental Health and 
Community Care

Care market is a significant growth
sector within the NHS. There is a

by Ascribe, to provide ready access
to patient-centric healthcare
information; this allows healthcare
professionals make more informed
decisions, allocate resources and
even book and track appointments
and visits.

surgeries throughout the world are

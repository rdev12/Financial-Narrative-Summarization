The company was incorporated on 1 April 2011 and the acquisition of Genel Energy International 
Limited (“GEIL ”) completed on 21 November 2011. The reported results and ﬁnancial statements 
therefore reﬂect the trading of GEIL from 21 November 2011 but include corporate and other costs as 
incurred from 1 April 2011. References to 2011 operating performance of Genel Energy in the business 
commentaries refer to the underlying performance of GEIL for the full 12 months of 2011 and not the 
period since Acquisition (unless otherwise stated).

Highlights
“ We have rebalanced Eleco by restructuring and reducing the risk profile  
of ElecoBuild
®
 and continued to expand ElecoSoft’s
®
 business organically 
and by acquisition in the past 18 months. The financial position of Eleco 
has also improved in the past 12 months and, as a consequence, I believe 
that Eleco is now better placed to take advantage of any improvement in 
the markets we serve.” 
 
John Ketteley, Executive Chairman

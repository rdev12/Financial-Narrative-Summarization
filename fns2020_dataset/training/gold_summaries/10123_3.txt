The strategy set out in our Strategic Review is to build a business 
focused on specialist engineering products occupying niche positions in 
growth markets, supported by significant barriers to entry. In pursuit of 
this strategy the Group completed one acquisition, three disposals and 
three closures during the course of 2008. Additionally, three businesses 
were consolidated into other existing operations. As a consequence, 
the Group started 2008 with twenty-one operating businesses and 
finished the year with thirteen. Since the year end the Group has 
disposed of a further business. Exiting from underperforming sectors 
and the consequent avoidance of further potential losses and cash 
outflows significantly reduces the Group’s risk profile. 
The £3.2m acquisition of Post Glover LifeLink (PGL) takes us into 
the growing market for the supply of specialist medical equipment, 
perfectly fitting the strategic criteria outlined above. Acquired in January 
2008, PGL has exceeded management’ s expectations and significantly 
enhanced its operating profit in the year ended 31 December 2008.
The Group’s strategic momentum has continued since the year end. 
In April 2009, we announced the disposal of BSC Diecasting. MRX 
China’s operations have also been consolidated into other operating 
businesses in 2009. 
Results
The resilience of our continuing businesses is demonstrated by their 
success in increasing revenues to £74.8m (2007: £70.2m) during 
an increasingly difficult year. Adjusted operating profit before 
exceptional items, goodwill impairment and share-based payments 
was £2.0m (2007: £2.6m). After exceptional items the Group 
incurred a loss before tax and discontinued operations of £2.2m 
(2007: £5.2m). Exceptional items including goodwill impairment and 
share-based payments amounted to £17.6m (2007: £12.2m) and 
were predominantly associated with the restructuring programme, 
with £14.2m relating to discontinued operations. Of this, £11.6m 
related to goodwill and asset impairment. The Group therefore 
incurred a loss after tax of £16.2m (2007: £7.0m). Adjusted Group 
earnings per share before exceptional items, goodwill impairment 
and share-based payments were 1.10p (2007: 4.36p) and basic loss 
per share was 13.55p (2007: loss of 5.83p note 8). 
Chairman’s Statement
John Crabtree
Chairman
“The resilience of our continuing 
businesses is demonstrated by their 
success in increasing revenues to 
£74.8m (2007: £70.2m) during an 
increasingly difﬁ cult year.”
Dividend
The Group’ s policy is to make dividend payments that are covered 
between 2.0 and 2.5 times by its earnings. In light of the current 
economic conditions and the Group’s performance in 2008, there will be 
no dividend payable in respect of the year ended 31 December 2008.
People
The year also saw considerable change to the Group’s Board as we 
positioned ourselves for growth under a talented and energetic 
new management team. As announced in last year’s annual report 
Michael Stock was appointed as Group Finance Director on 2 April 
2008, succeeding William Kelly who resigned by mutual consent on 
15 January 2008. In addition, Ian Paling joined the Group as Non-
Executive Director on the 4 April 2008. 
More recently, Andrew Pearson resigned as Non-Executive Director at 
the end of 2008 and John Adcock informed the Group that he will 
stand down as Non-Executive Director following the 2009 Annual 
General Meeting. The Board would like to record its thanks to Andrew 
Pearson and John Adcock for their significant contribution to Metalrax. 
The Group’s restructuring alone has created substantial challenges 
for our people, but the exceptional conditions presently affecting 
the economy impose additional burdens and discomfort. Many of 
our employees and other stakeholders have been personally and 
financially compromised by actions to assure the Group’s long term 
future. Our employees have been very supportive and I would like to 
record my thanks and those of the entire Board to all involved.
Outlook 
As announced in March 2009, trading in the first two months 
of 2009 was significantly below the levels experienced in 2008, 
although subsequent trading has shown a slight improvement. 
Against the current economic backdrop, visibility of future trading 
levels continues to be very limited and, in the Directors’ opinion, 
there is a wide range of potential outcomes for the Group in the 
current financial year. Although trading has improved slightly during 
the course of 2009, if this trend does not improve further over 
coming months, the Directors would expect the Group’s performance 
in the current year to fall below current market expectations. 
In the meantime, we will vigorously pursue organic growth 
opportunities within our continuing operations, continue to reduce 
costs and focus our business on markets that will deliver long-term 
Shareholder value.
Going concern
The Group has commenced re-financing discussions with its bankers to 
secure fully committed facilities. Whilst these discussions are significantly 
progressed, at the time of signing the accounts they had not yet been 
finalised, but I look forward to updating shareholders appropriately 
in due course. Further details of the Group’s liquidity position and 
going concern are given in the Financial Review and note 1 to the 
financial statements.

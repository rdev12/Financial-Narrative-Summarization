LiDCO Annual Report
2011/12
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
Overview
The combination of marginally increasing 
administration expenses (by 2%), 
improvements to product margins and 
revenue growth of 14% resulted in a 
maiden profit after tax of £15,000. The 
majority of our revenue (70%) now comes 
from a growing recurring disposable 
income stream. This was an excellent 
performance given the background of 
another year of very mixed economic 
conditions in some of the markets where 
our products are sold. 
During the past year we signed significant 
distribution and licensing agreements  
with Argon, ICU Medical and CNSystems 
Medizintechnik. These are all important 
commercial collaborations, aimed at 
increasing disposable income flow while 
significantly improving our major market 
reach. The retrofit nature of our non-
invasive blood pressure option should 
significantly increase disposable income  
in both our existing and future LiDCOrapid 
monitor installed base. 
The evidence for making hemodynamic 
monitoring of high-risk surgery patients 
routine is compelling. In our domestic 
market we are starting to see a strong  
push emerge from the National Health 
Service (NHS) for country-wide adoption.  
In December 2011 the NHS Improvement 
and Efficiency Directorate published its 
report Innovation, Health and Wealth.  
This report sets out actions to drive towards 
full adoption of advanced fluid and 
hemodynamic monitoring of surgery 
patients. We expect that this project will 
start from May 2012, and that hospitals will 
be encouraged to monitor more patients 
with a mixture of payment incentives 
coupled with the requirement to comply or 
explain. Ultimately, as detailed in the report 
of December 2011, this could result in the 
monitoring of an additional 750,000 
patients per annum and a saving to the 
NHS of £400 million a year. We expect other 
countries to adopt similar approaches. 
Advanced hemodynamic monitoring looks 
set to become an integral part of delivering 
effective care to the majority of high and 
moderate risk surgical patients. 
The economic background and 
emerging drivers of adoption
As a substantial part of the world’s 
economy continues to attempt to recover 
from the global economic crisis, healthcare 
expenditure growth can no longer be 
automatically assumed. Increasingly, 
budgetary constraints will rouse demands 
for healthcare efficiency savings. In the  
UK, NHS hospitals are expected to  
deliver efficiency savings in the region of  
£15 billion over the three years to March 
2014. Despite economic headwinds, the 
cost of treating an ageing population in the 
‘developed’ world ensures that there will 
continue to be a growing demand for 
medical devices as part of treatments that 
are evidence-based and proven to be cost 
effective. Around 250 million major surgical 
procedures are performed worldwide 
annually, resulting in about 12.5 million 
patients with surgical complications (Pearse 
et al., 2011). The traditional methods of 
monitoring fluid, blood volume and oxygen 
delivery are notoriously inefficient and fail 
to accurately predict those patients who 
need, and will respond to, fluid therapy.  
In marked contrast, treatment guided  
by advanced hemodynamic monitoring 
has been shown to better maintain fluid 
volumes and ensure adequate blood flow 
and tissue viability. Use of these parameters 
has significantly reduced operative 
complications (Lobo et al., 2011). Advanced 
hemodynamic monitors greatly assist with 
therapeutic decision-making and more 
With sales growing, a maiden profit 
after tax, corporate partnerships 
expanded and mainstream 
adoption planned for the NHS  
in England, last year was our most 
productive since joining AIM.

accurately guide appropriate fluid and  
drug interventions. Through their use, 
anesthetists and surgeons can provide 
greater consistency of care for the higher 
risk surgery patients. 
Worldwide sales for the new generation  
of minimally invasive hemodynamic 
monitors and disposables have grown  
to a substantial level already worth circa 
US$200 million per annum. In the UK, 
programmes are active in encouraging 
adoption and providing tariff payment 
enhancements; systematic adoption of 
hemodynamic monitoring is just starting  
to happen on a much larger scale. There  
is a growing realisation that the major 
surgery hemodynamic monitoring market 
is capable of reaching a recurring revenue 
business of approximately US$860 million 
per annum (Pearse et al., 2006). If a totally 
non-invasive monitor were available, the 
number of eligible patients and associated 
revenues could more than double. 
LiDCO’s route to the  
worldwide market
Smaller technology companies have to find 
an efficient and economic way to access 
the global market. It is almost impossible, 
both financially and logistically, for the 
Company to sell directly to the USA and 
Japanese markets. Recognising this market 
access challenge, LiDCO has chosen to 
export via third parties. This means that  
we sell through independent distributors  
in the smaller territories and through 
bigger medical device corporations in  
the major markets. 
Registration of the LiDCOrapid monitor  
and disposables commenced in 2011  
and the registration review is well 
advanced entering its final stage. Our best 
estimate is that this will conclude within 
the next few months. We have appointed 
Argon Medical Devices (‘Argon’) as our 
partner in this important territory and  
have signed heads of agreement with an 
additional major monitor sales organization 
in order to fully access the Japanese 
market, which is the second biggest  
market for hemodynamic monitoring in the 
world. Minimally invasive hemodynamic 
monitoring is becoming well established  
in Japan and the Board believes that the 
Japanese hemodynamic monitoring 
high-risk surgery market has a potential 
market value of US$285 million per annum.
Excellent performance 
  in a year of mixed economic conditions across our markets
Our relationship with Argon brings 
additional benefits to both parties. In March 
2011 we were appointed by Argon as the 
exclusive distributor for certain of their 
critical care disposable products in the UK. 
We started selling these products in June 
2011. Sales have grown well and now 
provide an additional regular monthly 
disposable income and profit contribution. 
LiDCO has a substantial and effective sales 
and distribution presence in the UK 
hospital market that can be further 
leveraged in this way. 
In the USA we continue to work closely 
with the Respiratory and Monitoring 
division of our US distribution partner 
Covidien. Considerable efforts are being 
made by Covidien to promote LiDCOrapid 
products through sales activities, sponsored 
workshops and satellite symposia. Covidien 
has achieved its monitor sales minimums  
in the first two years of our collaboration. 
We are working closely with them and their 
US customers to further develop the US 
market for surgical hemodynamic 
monitoring. We have a licence from 
Covidien to include their depth of 
anesthesia parameter into our monitor.  
The progressive engagement of Covidien’s 
large sales force, coupled with our  
closer collaboration through parameter 
integration, should help foster the 
relationship and help drive sales over  
the next few years.  10

Revenue and trading
Revenues were up by 14% to £7.12 million 
(2010/11: £ 6.24 million), with particularly 
good growth seen in disposable income 
£5.02 million (2010/11: £3.68 million). The 
seven year adjusted installed monitor base 
rose to 2,189 units (610 LiDCOplus; 1,579 
LiDCOrapid) up by a net 188 (9%) units in the 
year. LiDCOrapid monitors have become the 
majority (72%) of our installed base just over 
three and a half years since launch. Although 
the installed base grew the number of 
monitors sold was less than in the prior year 
(364 vs. 524). The majority of this shortfall 
reflected lower monitor sales to Covidien  
(185 vs. 300) – the consequence of the 
unfavourable phasing of orders across the 
period. LiDCOrapid disposable sales in the US 
were similarly affected by the order phasing. 
We have now agreed regular quarterly 
shipments of monitors and disposables that 
will even out variances for comparisons made 
across periods. Sales to Europe were steady 
with overall growth being held back by lower 
sales to some southern European territories. 
LiDCO disposable income outside of the  
USA of £2.89 million was up 17% and was 
predominantly driven by LiDCOrapid  
smart card sales which were overall up a very 
commendable 107% to 17,750 units. Looking 
ahead we expect sales in the UK, Middle East, 
USA (Covidien), Japan and northern and 
eastern Europe to progress during 2012, 
particularly for the LiDCOrapid business. 
During the year the Company entered into 
an agreement to distribute Argon’s critical 
care product lines in the UK. Handling 
Argon’s and later ICU Medical’s product 
sales in the UK allows us to offer a more 
comprehensive offering to customers. Sales 
over the eight months of Argon’s products 
were £1.21 million and, although at a lower 
margin than our own products, provided 
income that helped offset the effect on 
profitability and cash flow of the order 
phasing differences seen during the period 
with Covidien. Argon sales are projected  
to increase significantly in 2012/13,  
as we will be reporting a full year’s revenue 
augmented with organic sales growth. 
Markets
UK 
Overall sales revenue growth was 57%  
to £3.7 million (2010/11: £2.36 million). 
Argon distribution revenue was £1.2 million 
(2010/11: nil). Monitor sales/placements  
in the period were higher at 66 units with 
monitor revenue of £471,000 (2010/11: 61 
units; £500,000). LiDCO disposable  
revenue was £2,024,000 up 12% (2010/11: 
£1,800,000). Sensor (12,310 units) and  
smart card (8,735 units) were up 5% and 
47% respectively, the latter reflecting strong 
growth in the high-risk surgery market 
segment of our business. Revenue from 
LiDCO disposables grew to 81% of total 
LiDCO product revenues (2010/11: 76%). 
The push by the NHS in England for full 
adoption of hemodynamic monitoring in 
surgery should help with more systematic 
use and wider adoption. We expect to be 
able to offer customers our new software 
with depth of anesthesia and the non-
invasive blood pressure module towards 
the end of 2012 in the UK. Given the push 
for adoption of intraoperative fluid and 
hemodynamic management and widening 
of the patient populations suitable for our 
products, the Board expects revenues to 
grow well in our domestic market during 
2012. In particular we are expecting good 
sales growth of our LiDCOrapid and Argon 
distribution businesses. 
USA
Sales to the USA of £1,788,000 were  
down by 24% (2010/11: £2,359,000). This 
was principally due to timing/phasing 
differences of bulk orders to Covidien  
(for both monitors and disposables)  
which affected comparisons across the two 
periods. In the prior year we had five bulk 
orders, compared with only three in the last 
reporting period. Monitor sales were down 
from £748,000 to £575,000 with disposables 
down to £923,000 (2010/11: £1,207,000). 
Revenues were also affected, but to a lesser 
extent by reduced sales of disposables  
in the older LiDCOplus sensor intensive  
care accounts where a number of  
these accounts have transitioned to  
the LiDCOrapid monitor instead. Sales to 
Covidien are predicted to grow this year 
following the move to more regularly 
spaced bulk order shipments.

Continental Europe
Total revenue in Continental Europe was 
steady at £853,000 (2010/11: £859,000). 
Monitor sales revenue was £279,000 
(2010/11: £320,000) and disposables sales 
were up by 6% to £574,000 (2010/11: 
£539,000). Strong growth in sales of 
LiDCOrapid disposables was seen with units 
up by 83% to 4,455 units. Sales prospects  
in Europe remain quite challenging in the 
southern territories. In the countries where 
economies are stronger and we have 
successful distributors we expect to see 
continued progress. 
Rest of World
Total revenues we up 17%. In June 2011 the 
Company signed an agreement in Japan 
with Argon Medical Devices, as previously 
noted above. Outside of Japan, we have 
made good progress in both the Middle 
East and Brazilian markets. 12
LiDCO Annual Report
2011/12
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
Margins achieved on LiDCOplus sensors 
remained steady at 86% and LiDCOrapid 
smart cards increased marginally to 94% 
(2010/11: 93%).
Unit sales of LiDCOrapid smart cards rose 
by 9% overall. Excluding the US where 
there were reduced sales caused by the 
phasing of orders, smart card unit sales 
increased by 107%. In the UK, total 
disposable unit sales increased by 20% with 
smart cards increasing by 47%. In the UK 
where we have detailed usage information, 
the average use rate remained steady at  
4.7 uses per monitor per month but with 
use in some hospitals as high as 20 uses  
per monitor per month.
Total overheads increased by £85,000 (2%) 
compared with the previous year.
Taxation
Although the Company continues to 
benefit from research and development  
tax credits the receipt of these in cash  
is reducing as the Company approaches 
profitability and the credit of £60,000 this 
year is likely to be the last received in cash. 
The Company has a deferred tax asset of 
£5.3 million although this has not been 
recognised in the accounts.
Cash, financing and working capital
To mitigate against the effect of end of life 
notices being issued by manufacturers on 
some monitor components, the Company 
placed larger than normal forward orders 
for monitors as noted in last year’s financial 
statements. This resulted in an increase  
in inventories during the year of £302,000.  
It is anticipated that these forward monitor 
orders will be absorbed into normal  
trading in 2013. This increase in inventories 
together with shorter-term working capital 
movements and an increase in fixed assets 
resulted in a net cash outflow before 
financing activities of £582,000 (2010/11: 
£433,000).
In January 2012, the Company entered into 
a sale and leaseback financing arrangement 
in respect of 77 upcharge monitors in the 
UK resulting in a cash inflow of £518,000 
repayable in equal instalments over three 
years. These funds are to finance the costs 
for licensing and development of the 
continuous non-invasive blood pressure 
technology project with CNSystems 
Medizintechnik AG, which was announced 
on 9 January 2012, and the increase in 
inventory. Cash balances at 31 January 
2012 totalled £1,553,000 (2010/11: 
£1,404,000). Cash net of the overdraft facility 
was £1,341,000 (2010/11: £1,404,000). The 
Board anticipates that this will be sufficient 
to see the Company through to profitability 
and positive cash flow. 
Expenditure on intangible assets in the  
year of £453,000 was broadly similar  
to the previous year. This will increase 
significantly during 2012/13 as a result  
of the continuous non-invasive blood 
pressure technology project noted above. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Operating results 
Turnover increased by 14% to  
£7.12 million (2010/11: £6.24 million). 
Operating losses decreased 
significantly by 90% to £49,000 
(2010/11: £498,000). The Company 
produced its maiden profit after tax 
of £15,000 (2010/11: loss £390,000) 
and earnings per share of 0.01p 
(2010/11: loss 0.22 pence).  
Exports fell by 12% to £3.42 million 
(2011/12: £3.89 million) largely the 
result of reduced sales to the US 
caused by the phasing of orders  
to Covidien. Exports represented 
48% of turnover. 
During the year a total of 364 monitors 
(2010/11: 524 monitors) were sold or 
placed. The seven year installed base  
of monitors at the year end was 2,189 
(2010/11: 2,001) representing a net increase 
in the year of 9% or 188 monitors. The 
installed base includes demonstration and 
evaluation monitors sold to distributors. 
The monitors sold/placed in the year 
comprised 310 LiDCOrapid monitors 
(2010/11: 474) and 54 LiDCOplus monitors 
(2010/11: 52) including 11 (2010/11: 9) 
being placed.
Recurring revenues from the sales of LiDCO 
disposables, service contracts and fees  
for use increased by 4% to £3.81 million 
(2010/11: £3.68 million). Including third 
party disposables, recurring revenue 
increased by 36% and represented 70% 
(2010/11: 59%, though it should be noted 
there were no third party disposable sales 
last year) of total revenues. The number  
of LiDCO disposables sold increased by 6%  
to a milestone 50,595 (20010/11: 47,938).
The average product margin across all 
LiDCO products after external procurement 
costs increased during the period from 76% 
to 80%. This was largely the result of mix 
variance compared with the prior year  
with an increased proportion of disposable 
sales and licence revenue, which have a 
higher margin than monitor sales. Future 
profitability will significantly depend on 
margins achieved on disposables and these 
have remained high during the year.  13
LiDCO Annual Report
2011/12
Expenditure on plant property and 
equipment was £292,000 (excluding the 
effect of the sale and leaseback of the 
upcharge monitors). Of this £211,000 was 
in respect of medical monitors used for 
demonstration purposes, upcharge and 
clinical trials and product development.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
Hemodynamic monitoring is a key part  
of an effective surgical care pathway for 
high-risk surgery patients. Better outcomes 
can be achieved through more balanced 
fluid, drug and anesthetic use in patients. 
Research will continue to further refine  
and quantify the most effective approaches 
for treating these high-risk surgery  
patients. LiDCO is the sole hemodynamic 
monitoring technology used in two of the 
world’s biggest multi-center trials of their 
kind: OPTIMISE (in the UK) and MOnIToR  
(in the USA). Both trials are progressing well 
with 371 patients recruited in the MOnIToR 
trial and over 400 in the OPTIMISE trial. 
In September 2011, the Company was 
informed by the European Patent Office  
of the intention to grant our European 
patent protecting the novel Graphical  
User Interface (GUI) features that we believe 
help make the LiDCOrapid unique and easy 
to use. The broadening of our patented 
intellectual property into the display is a 
significant development. We are delighted 
that key aspects of our software can be 
protected in this way and have also applied 
for additional patent protection for 
developments that will be part of our 
multi-parameter software. 
Parameter convergence pathway  
for high-risk surgery 
LiDCO is committed to monitor integration 
and parameter convergence that will 
realize the full potential for our PC monitor 
hardware platform. We believe that 
customers require total monitoring 
solutions, ie complete products that  
can replace the multiple existing single 
parameter monitors, and that convergence 
creates more effective monitoring devices. 
The new LiDCOrapid software, that is 
currently being developed, will allow the 
connection of two modules that effectively 
integrate Covidien’s depth of anaesthesia 
and CNSystem’s non-invasive blood 
pressure technology. The non-invasive 
blood pressure module will provide 
continuous data from a simple to use dual 
finger sensor. Combined hemodynamic 
and depth of anesthesia monitoring will 
help anesthetists limit and control the fall  
in blood pressure and blood flow seen after 
anesthetic induction. The technology will 
be quick to set-up, completely non-invasive 
and usable in the more than 80% of surgery 
patients who do not have an existing 
arterial blood pressure catheter. The 
addition of this technology potentially 
doubles the number of major surgery 
patients suitable for fluid and 
hemodynamic monitoring and should 
increase disposable use in both the existing 
and future installed base of LiDCOrapid 
14% increase in turnover
monitors. It has been estimated that the 
addition of non-invasive blood pressure 
monitoring could take the worldwide 
major surgery market potential to 
approximately 10.5 million patients per 
annum with a potential disposable revenue 
stream of US$1.72 billion per annum. 
Intensive care 
Regarding the Company’s intensive care 
product, the LiDCOplus, we expect to 
significantly update the monitor software  
(v 4.02). This will involve updating the 
operating system, adding the arterial line 
blood pressure module option and further 
improving ease of use and calibration 
methodology.
Outlook
This has been an exciting and very 
productive year, and with our broadening 
corporate partnerships we are very well 
placed for the future. The increasing levels 
of adoption within the NHS, along with  
our planned expansion into Japan,  
together with the forthcoming product 
developments give us confidence for 2012 
and beyond.

 The Directors set out in this section
their analysis of business. We do so
voluntarily and do not seek to comply
in full with the Accounting Standard
Board’s Statement “Operating and
Financial Review” issued in 
January 2003.
Business Review
Vero Software made further and
substantial progress in 2007 following
the introduction of new products, the
consolidation of earlier acquisitions
and an increased marketing emphasis.
All these effects combined to provide
a record increase in revenue and a
15% rise in pre tax profits.
There was a 20% increase in revenue
from the competitive German market
where Vero Software products have
attained an impressive reputation for
technical excellence and where the
productivity of the software solutions 
is much sought after. Revenues from
operations in both Japan and North
America increased by over 10% in
local terms although these positive
revenue effects were partly offset in
pound terms by the weaker Yen and
US Dollar throughout 2007. Italy and
France also showed revenue gains as
mould and die manufacturers sought
to regain cost of production benefits
through new automation advances.
Customer care and technical support
services are showing good returns as
the number of renewed maintenance
agreements continues to rise along
with the basic software license
revenues. Consulting and training
revenues grew by a third as we
expanded the subsidiary Company
capabilities in providing quality technical
expertise for customer projects. 
The greater development capacity
provided by the 2006 Camtek
acquisition has led to a further
increase in our gross margin. 
Acquisitions
The acquisitions of Plastics &
Computer in Italy and Camtek Ltd. 
in the UK both completed in 2006
provided significant product and
integration opportunities that were
capitalised on during 2007. The
plastics flow analysis product is now
integrated within the VISI mould and
die offering and the Camtek PEPS
products have been introduced to all
of the major Vero Software markets.
Both companies are now successfully
integrated in the Vero Software
structure and the combination of 
the two UK offices into one will be
completed by the summer.

In June 2007 we also acquired the
North American distributor for the
CAMTEK PEPS product to provide
further qualified sales and support
personnel as well as open cross selling
opportunities in some of the newer
mould and die areas in the south of
the USA. 
New Operations 
In January this year the Company
established its new Vero Insight division
to address the data mining needs of
the technical and manufacturing
arenas. These software application
and consulting services bring together
many of the Company’s traditional data
design, mathematical, and 3D graphics
skills required to uncover technical
solutions among large data files. 
The division will be working with and
wherever empirical data results hold
the key to improving performance or
prolonging the lives of components in
such diverse fields as motor racing or
mining. The division’s impact on 2008
results will be small in comparison to
the existing business but is set to
provide a fast growing element for 
the future. 
Operating Expenses 
Selling expenses grew at 5% as a
result of further investment in the Asian
and North American subsidiaries. The
increase in administrative expenses of
21% to £2.4m reflected a full year of
costs relating to the previous year’s
acquisitions. 
Product Development and Other
Operating Income
The 2006 acquisitions provided 
an increase in qualified software
development personnel to accelerate
some product introductions and
accentuate the focus on providing
specific product sets for the niche
application areas within the mould 
and die sector. 
Product development expenditure 
of £1,026,000 has been capitalised
this year (2006: £603,000) as required
by International Financial Reporting
Standards. This reflects investment in
development which will be included 
in future releases of our products. 
New releases of Vero Software
products in all ranges will be
introduced from next month. 
Machining STRATEGIST is a powerful
3D CAM product that generates optimum

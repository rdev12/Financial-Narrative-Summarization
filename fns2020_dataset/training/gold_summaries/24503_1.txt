CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S REVIEW
H&T’s continued investment in our people, stores  
and systems has provided a platform for growth  
in this rapidly evolving market.
IntroductIon
The alternative credit market is undergoing  
a seismic shift as it adjusts to a very different 
high street trading environment, a lower gold 
price and a new regulator. These factors have 
already reduced earnings across much of the 
sector and the impact of the interest rate cap  
on pay day loans will put some businesses 
under further pressure in 2015.
Profit before tax for the period fell to £5.5m 
(2013: £6.7m), a fall of 17.9%, principally as a 
result of reduced profits from our Pawnbroking 
Scrap and Gold Purchasing operations. 
 
The Group has responded well to protect 
earnings in the short term through effective cost 
control and a focus on jewellery retail, while 
making appropriate investments to develop the 
business through a focus on products, service 
and distribution.
H&T has always sought to be the customer’s 
first choice for pawnbroking services by 
providing high quality locations with 
professional, knowledgeable and approachable 
staff. H&T has enhanced this proposition by 
expanding other services including our new 
personal loan, foreign exchange and buyback. 
This level of development has not affected the 
quality of service, as demonstrated by our 
independent customer research which shows 
customer satisfaction significantly outperforming 
the specialty retailers’ benchmark.
Our store estate of 191 stores comprises  
152 H&T Pawnbrokers stores and 39 est1897 
second hand jewellery retail stores. During 
the year we have closed eight stores, opened 
one H&T Pawnbrokers store, opened three 
standalone est1897 stores and acquired one 
established pawnbroking business.
The Group has launched its online valuation 
service, its Personal Loans product, est1897 
retail site and the ‘My H&T‘ customer portal in 
H2 2014. These developments enhance our 
online capability and provide our customers 
with the ability to interact with us in the way 
they find most convenient. The main focus for 
2015 will be driving adoption of these services 
through effective online and offline marketing 
and communication.
We believe that the high quality of investment 
made in our stores, systems and people has 
provided a strong platform for growth. While 
we will have to adapt aspects of our business 
model we believe we are well positioned to 
take advantage of the market disruption seen 
to date.

CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S REVIEW continued tHe market
H&T provides a range of options for customers 
to raise the cash they need, whether using 
an asset or taking out an unsecured loan. 
The pricing of our loan products is among the 
lowest in the sector, particularly versus larger 
chains, and almost without exception the 
1.6m customers of pay day lenders would be 
substantially better off taking a loan with H&T 
instead.
The Board believe that the wider alternative 
credit market is likely to undergo significant 
change in the coming year primarily due to the 
implementation of the FCA’ s interest rate cap. 
The FCA has stated that “it is possible that one 
high-street firm may be able to operate” at the 
0.8% per day cap, we would therefore anticipate 
store closures in that segment of the wider 
sector. 
The Board believes that the financial stability 
of the Group, our range of products and our 
outstanding service delivery position us to take 
advantage of these market conditions.
our Strategy
The Group’ s strategy is to serve a customer 
base whose access to mainstream credit is 
limited and for whom small sum loans can help 
get through short term financial problems. The 
Group will deliver this strategy by developing a 
range of lending products, both secured and 
unsecured, offered in-store and online. 
 
The development of a strong retail proposition 
supports our lending and purchasing 
operations, improves returns and reduces the 
Groups exposure to gold price volatility. The 
development of the standalone est1897 brand 
could play an important part of this strategy in 
the future.
The Group will address the low returns on capital 
over the medium term by increasing earnings 
through product development, release of capital 
in underperforming units and reinvestment into 
high return areas.
regulatIon
The FinanciaL conducT auThoriTy The regulation of Consumer Credit moved 
from the Office of Fair Trading to the Financial 
Conduct Authority on 1 April 2014. The Group 
has obtained interim permission from the 
FCA and has submitted its application for full 
authorisation in February 2015.
The Group has appointed a Compliance 
Manager and established a Risk Committee 
comprised of independent non-executive 
directors to oversee the compliance framework 
and our preparation for authorisation. Our non-
executive directors have extensive experience 
with the regulatory requirements of the FCA 
and its predecessors and provide the Group 
with valuable support and insight into the new 
regime. 
high cosT shor T Term crediT 
inTeresT ra Te cap
On 11 November 2014 the FCA published its 
rules relating to a cap on the interest rate and 
charges that apply to High Cost Short T erm 
Credit (“HCSTC”). The rules took effect from  
2 January 2015 and provide for:
• a maximum charge of 0.8% per day on the 
amount borrowed
• a maximum of £15 fees on default
• a cap on the total costs incurred over the life 
of the loan of 100% of the amount borrowed
The definition of HCSTC is broad but provides a 
specific exemption for pawnbroking and certain 
other credit products at present; we do not 
expect the cap to apply to pawnbroking in the 
near term.
The Group’ s personal loan product must 
conform to the cap although our relatively 
low rates of interest compared with the wider 
alternative credit market mean that the cap has 
almost no impact on our earnings. 
revIew oF oPeratIonS
During the year the average gold price was £768 
per troy oz (2013: £903), a fall of 15.0 %. This 
reduction impacts on the profit derived from 
pawnbroking scrap and purchasing and is the 
principal reason for the reduction in gross profits 
to £45.7m (2013: £49.9m), a fall of 8.4%.
PawnBrokIng
The pledge book has reduced 12.7% to £38.5m 
(2013: £44.1m) as a result of the competitive 
environment, a lower lending rate per gram and 
a reduction in aged pledge. The rate of reduction 
has slowed significantly during the course of the 
year, the June 2014 balance was £38.5m, as 
lending has stabilised during 2014.
The Group’ s Pawn Service Charge was  
down 1.0% to £28.4m (2013: £28.7m) and 
now represents 62.1% of Group gross profit 
(2013: 57.4%). The interest component of the 
Pawn Service Charge declined 3.8% to £28.2m 
(2013: £29.3m) which more accurately reflects 
the underlying performance of the pawnbroking 
segment than the total Pawn Service Charge. 
The yield on the pledge book has increased due 
to the improved ageing profile of the book and 
the higher average rate of interest.  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014

Strategic report
The store based competitive environment for 
pawnbroking peaked in early 2013 following 
which the fall in the price of gold impacted both 
demand and the level of security available to 
support the loan value. T otal lending in 2014 
reduced 9.1% to £94.5m (2013: £104.0m) and 
the average lending rate per gram reduced by 
6.7% as we sought to maintain a reasonable 
loan to value ratio.
The Group implemented a number of initiatives 
during the year to support the pawnbroking 
proposition:
1) Implementation of “Expert Eye”, a system 
which enables high definition magnified 
images to be sent from a store to our centre 
of excellence at the jewellery centre where 
the images are assessed and with telephone 
support the store is able to make a better 
loan decision
2) The development of the “We lend on 
anything” valuation portal on the website 
where customers can submit an item for 
valuation
3) The development of mobile apps both 
for iOS and Android phones to enable 
customers to photograph items and submit 
to us for valuation
4) During October 2014 the sponsorship of  
the “Pawn Stars UK” TV programme and  
a promotional relationship with the stars for 
personal appearances and web referrals
 
The Group has developed these platforms 
to provide ways to enhance our customers 
engagement and maximise the returns from our 
marketing investments. The development of the 
“My H&T” customer portal to allow customers to 
view and manage their pawnbroking loans online 
together with the launch of online pawnbroking 
in Q2 2015 will provide further convenience and 
provide access to a wider customer base.
PawnBrokIng ScraP
Pawnbroking Scrap produced a loss in the year 
of £0.2m (2013: £1.8m profit). 
This loss was expected in light of the relatively 
higher rate per gram on forfeited items against 
the gold price. We would not expect margins on 
pawnbroking scrap to return to historical levels 
as we seek to maintain a competitive proposition 
on lending and support the pledge book.
retaIl
Retail sales increased 24.1% to £30.9m (2013: 
£24.9m) and gross profit increased 8.1% to 
£10.7m (2013: £9.9m).
Retail has been a real success in 2014 as we 
seek to rebalance the business away from its 
exposure to the gold price and drive revenues in 
the short term. The changing business mix and 
the complex interaction of VAT schemes in the 
business resulted in an additional VAT cost in 
the year of approximately £1.9m. VAT has been 
a net recovery in recent years and was netted 
against expenses whereas VAT payable on sales 
has now been deducted from the retail sales. 
The Group considers a successful retail offering 
to be a core part of our Group proposition. 
Pawnbroking and Gold Purchasing both 
generate significant amounts of saleable 
jewellery which must be sold. While higher 
historic gold prices provided a reasonable return 
from scrapping gold, this disposition route is 
not suitable for gemset items or watches. The 
ability to retail items rather than scrap them also 
provides a higher return and reduces the Group’ s 
exposure to short term gold price volatility.
The principal drivers for growth have been:
1) Increased stock in store: Through effective 
working capital management we have 
reduced stock in process, transit or central 
locations to allow an 19.7% increase in 
average store stock in 2014 vs 2013 with  
a 2.6% reduction in overall stock holding
2) ‘est1897’ retail brand: During the year we 
rebranded 36 H&T Pawnbrokers stores 
and built 3 standalone stores in shopping 
centre locations. Whilst too early to judge 
their performance, these stores provided 
retail sales growth higher than the Company 
average
3) Pricing Strategy Improvements: We have 
developed more sophisticated methods to 
deliver effective pricing and discount policies 
in store to maximise sales and margin. This 
remains a key focus as we seek to maximise 
overall gross profits from this area

CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S REVIEW continued The Group also launched a fully transactional 
website www.est1897.co.uk in September 2014 
which is used to showcase the exceptional items 
available from our stores.
gold PurcHaSIng Gold Purchasing gross profit declined to £2.4m 
(2013: £4.8m) as a result of four key factors:
1) Gold price reduction: The average gold price 
was £768 per troy ounce during 2014 (2013: 
£903 per troy ounce) a reduction of 15.0% 
which impacts on the gross profit available 
on each transaction
2) Closure of GoldBar: The retail mall units 
contributed £0.7m of profit in 2013 and were 
closed as volumes decreased during the 
course of that year
3) Competitive Pressure: The margin derived 
from Gold Purchasing reduced from 19.5%  
in 2013 to 17.9% in 2014
4) Changing business mix: The increased cost 
of goods sold through retail means that a 
higher proportion of profits are realised in the 
retail segment rather than Gold Purchasing. 
Cost of goods sold through retail increased 
by 34.7% from 2013 to 2014
We estimate that the weight of fine gold 
purchased in like for like H&T stores fell by 1.7% 
from 2013 to 2014, with the trend in fine gold 
weight being encouraging since January 2014.
While Gold Purchasing has never been 
considered a core revenue stream for the 
Group we would expect that the improvements 
delivered to support pawnbroking and retail will 
also support Gold Purchasing. 
PerSonal loanS
The Personal Loans segment comprises all 
unsecured lending activity in the Group, including 
the pay day loan product which was withdrawn 
in September 2013. Gross profit fell to £1.8m 
(2013: £2.9m).
The Group took the decision in early 2013 to 
simplify its unsecured loan offering from the 
Pay Day Advance and KwikLoan products to 
the new more flexible Personal Loan which is 
tailored to a customer’ s personal circumstances. 
The product provides loans from £50 to £1,000 
over any term of up to two years, subject to 
affordability checks. 
The H&T Personal Loan may be taken out for 
periods of less than a year and as the APR on 
the loans is more than 100% a proportion of 
our lending falls within the FCA definition of High 
Cost Short T erm Credit (“HCSTC”), as such 
the interest rate cap applies to those loans. We 
estimate that approximately 1% of our lending in 
2014 would have been restricted by the loan cap 
where they were small amounts and very short 
term (up to two months). We have now reviewed 
the pricing of our products to ensure that all 
loans are fully compliant and our products remain 
competitive in the context of the new market.
The Personal Loan product was launched online 
in August 2014 and will provide a key medium 
term opportunity.
otHer ServIceS
Other Services includes Third Party Cheque 
Cashing, Foreign Exchange, Buyback, Western 
Union and other income. T otal gross profit from 
Other Services was £2.7m (2013: £1.8m), 
the increase being generated from Foreign 
Exchange and Buyback activities, both new 
products launched in 2013.
Third Party Cheque Cashing gross profits 
reduced 8% to £1.1m (2013: £1.2m) as the 
number of cheques in circulation reduced. 
Foreign Exchange continues to grow with an 
increase in gross profits of 167% to £0.8m 
(2013: £0.3m). This simple transactional product 
brings new customers and revenues into H&T’ s 
stores without detracting from the core services.
Buyback has been a particular success as 
part of the wider strategic development of the 
“We buy anything” proposition. Gross profits 
increased to £0.5m (2013: £0.1m) as the value 
purchased increased to £2.9m (2013: £0.7m) 
and brought a new customer base to H&T . 
Buyback customers are younger – (57% are 
35 or under vs 33% in Pawnbroking) and more 
likely to be male – (63% are male vs 40% in 
Pawnbroking).
ProSPectS
The Group has made good progress in delivering 
our strategy described above with the initial 
development complete on a range of initiatives 
to develop our position as the UKs leading 
pawnbroker. The challenge for 2015 is to ensure 
that the investment to date yields tangible results 
to drive earnings growth and improve returns 
from the store estate.
We believe that the wider market is stabilising 
and future changes will be positive for the Group 
and we have built a solid platform for growth. 
Current trading is in line with management’ s 
expectations for 2015.
I would also like to add my great thanks to those 
of the Chairman, in recognising all our people 
whose skills, commitment and enthusiasm 
continue to drive our success, and who give  
us confidence in the future.

Underlying performance
The Group’s management uses underlying performance to plan for, control and assess the performance of the Group. Underlying performance differs from the statutory  
IFRS performance as it excludes the effect of special items, which are defined in note 2. The Board’s view is that underlying performance provides more meaningful information 
for the Group’s investors and so it is the primary focus of the Group’s narrative reporting. Where appropriate, statutory performance inclusive of special items is also described.

 Enterprise Inns Annual Report 2003 3
Chairman’s Statement
am delighted to report on our results for the year to 30 September 2003 which benefited from growth in our
core estate and from the contributions made by our major investments in 2002. In March 2002 the 
Company invested £75 million to acquire a 16.8% share in the Unique Pub Company Limited (Unique) and in
May 2002 the Company acquired an estate of 1,860 pubs from Laurel Pub Holdings (Laurel) for a total
consideration of £881 million.
Total operating profit before exceptional items increased by 44% to £293.2 million and profit before tax and
exceptional items rose by 51% to £173.2 million. Interest cover was 2.8 times excluding the contribution from
Unique. Cash generated after payments in respect of interest, tax, dividends and capital expenditure amounted
to £119 million which, together with proceeds from the sale of pubs, facilitated the repayment of £135.5
million of borrowings in the year. Total debt at the year end was £1.395 billion, 99% of which is fixed at a
weighted average interest rate of 6.9% for an average life of almost 16 years.
Unique continued to perform in line with expectations, achieving an operating profit before exceptional items
approaching £230 million.
Adjusted earnings per share which has been calculated excluding exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and a
one-off tax credit in 2003, following settlement of prior years’ tax computations, increased by 23% to 72.3 pence.
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 11.4 pence per share, making a total for the year of 17.1
pence per share, an increase of 21% over the prior year. This increase is closely aligned to earnings growth
which the directors believe is appropriate given the Company’s strong and stable cash flows. The total dividend
will be covered 4.3 times and will be payable on 26 January 2004, subject to shareholder approval.
Average operating profit per pub increased by 8% over the prior year in the core estate which averaged 3,324
pubs in the period. The core estate excludes Laurel, acquired in May 2002, which has contributed just over £91
million of operating profit in the year.
On 3 March 2003 the Company issued £250 million of secured bonds with interest payable at 6.5% per annum
until redemption in December 2018. Following strong investor demand, this issue was subsequently increased
in October 2003 by £350 million to a total issue of £600 million. Total long-term debt issued by the Company
over recent years now amounts to £1,185 million.
These strong results, and those of our associate Unique, have been delivered in a testing economic
environment and reflect our continuing success in developing a high quality leased and tenanted pub estate.
Enterprise’s commitment to charging fair rents and to providing a full range of leading national, regional and
local brands continues to attract and motivate top quality licensees, who are the key to our long-term success.
We thank them and all our staff for their contributions.
Earlier this month we announced the appointment of David Harding as an independent non-executive director of
the Company. He brings with him a wealth of financial and management experience and will succeed Michael
Garner as Chairman of the Company’s Audit Committee during the current financial year ending September 2004.
The Company’s estate and its investment in Unique provide many opportunities for profitable growth and we
look forward to another year of solid progress.

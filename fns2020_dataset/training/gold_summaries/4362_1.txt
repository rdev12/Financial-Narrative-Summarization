CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
DMGT’s Philosophy
DMGT is a multi-media  
and information company 
providing essential news, 
entertainment and information 
services in both the business to 
business (B2B) and consumer 
sectors. We operate in many 
different markets, in many 
countries, each with its own 
competitive and regulatory 
requirements. 
It has been DMGT’s philosophy 
for many years to take 
advantage of its shareholding 
structure and to invest with  
a long-term perspective to 
generate value. Our particular 
ownership structure, with 
control maintained by the 
founding family, has proved 
itself throughout our long 
history to be a successful 
business model in the media 
and information industry. It is 
this ownership structure that 
affords us a longer-term 
perspective and that is at  
the heart of our philosophy.
We are committed to 
remaining diversified across 
both the B2B and consumer 
media sectors in order to give 
us a breadth of opportunities 
and to spread risk. Our B2B  
arm is made up of Risk 
Management Solutions (RMS), 
dmg::information, dmg::events 
and Euromoney Institutional 
Investor. Our consumer media 
activities comprise within A&N 
Media Mail Newspapers, our 
digital-only businesses, our free 
newspaper division, principally 
Metro, and Northcliffe Media. 
We also own 50% of dmg Radio 
Australia, a joint venture. 
Strategy
The overarching strategy for 
the Group is to remain the 
owner of high quality, 
sustainable, market-leading 
media and information assets 
across both the B2B and 
consumer sectors and to 
improve DMGT’s overall share 
rating. Our intention is for DMGT 
to become a truly global 
growth company with 
sustainable earnings and 
This Business Review outlines the main operational and 
financial factors underpinning the development, performance 
and position of the Group as well as those likely to affect 
performance over the coming year, illustrating this with key 
performance indicators.
My Chief Executive’s Review sets out the nature, objectives and 
strategy of the Group. A business review of the performance  
of each of our operating divisions follows on pages 24 to 37.  
A Financial and Treasury Review is given on pages 38 to 43 
and the principal risks and uncertainties the Group faces are 
set out on pages 50 to 53 of the Directors’ Report.
INTRODUCTION
OUR STRATEGIC AMBITION –

internationally into 
high growth markets
Our structure,  
as a publicly listed

family, provides  
a successful business 
model for the media 
and information 
industry.  13

dividend growth, with an 
increasing exposure to growth 
economies and international 
opportunities. 
Last year I stated that our 
strategy is underpinned by five 
guiding tasks, which are still all 
relevant today, but this year I 
have added a sixth, and that  
is technology innovation.
The first is to enhance focus  
by concentrating our 
management and investment 
on a subset of businesses 
where we see the closest 
alignment between 
opportunities and growth, and 
which fit with our investment 
criteria. 
Secondly, we have been 
strengthening our balance 
sheet in order to maintain 
financial flexibility so that we 
are able to take advantage  
of opportunities as they arise. 
The third key priority has been 
to reduce pension liabilities. 
The fourth is applying 
consistent investment criteria. 
This requires being highly 
disciplined both in regularly 
assessing our current 
businesses and in the way we 
assess all future investments, 
resulting in a clear capital 
allocation process. There is  
a preparedness to sell as well 
as to buy on a timely basis. 
The fifth is building on  
DMGT’s distinct values and 
management philosophy.  
We remain committed to  
a decentralised operating 
structure with a small  
central team in order to 
nurture innovation and an 
entrepreneurial mind set.  
We have been raising the bar 
on talent by being committed 
to attracting and retaining  
the best people in order to 
optimise our management 
philosophy and to meet  
our global growth ambitions. 
Our work on talent remains 
critical in order to have the 
entrepreneurially minded 
people who can drive the 
revenue line and our strategic 
ambitions.
The sixth task, to which we are 
dedicating increased 
attention, is ensuring that we 
are making the necessary 
changes to embrace new 
technologies to meet 
changing customer needs and 
to improve efficiency and to 
lower costs.
Progress in year
We have made good progress 
in pursuit of our strategy over 
the last twelve months. We 
have narrowed further the 
range of companies DMGT 
operates to concentrate 
financial and talent resources 
where growth opportunities 
are greatest. We have 
repaired our balance sheet by 
achieving a high profit to cash 
conversion, through active 
portfolio management and by 
extending our bank facilities 
out to 2016. We have focused 
strongly on operational 
efficiency throughout the 
Group. We have negotiated  
a medium-term funding 
arrangement with the pension 
fund trustees and have made 
inroads towards curtailing our 
pension liabilities. We are 
looking at ways of reducing 
the schemes’ volatility. We 
have applied our clearly 
articulated set of criteria  
for making investments. We 
have elevated the priority 
given to talent and launched 
a new leadership programme.  
We have improved 
communication both internally 
and externally. We are 
developing a long-term plan 
for international growth as part 
of our ambition to create a 
truly global company and we 
invested additional resources 
to execute against this plan. 
Finally, we are pursuing a 
number of DMGT Group-wide 
initiatives in the technology 
area.
My summary of this year’s 
progress should be seen as a 
testament to our unwavering 
commitment to the strategy 
we set out last year.
DMGT Operational Model
DMGT’s approach to 
managing the Group’s 
companies has not changed: 
we continue to adopt a 
decentralised structure. We 
take a considerable amount of 
comfort in the fact that we 
know all our companies are 
run by chief executives with 
expert knowledge of the 
markets in which they operate. 
We have continued to nurture 
operational autonomy with 
strong incentives based on 
performance, whilst retaining 
central control over surplus 
capital and its reinvestment. 
Maintaining this approach  
is of the upmost importance  
to me and my colleagues. The 
benefits are numerous and 
enabled us to respond rapidly 
to the economic downturn. At 
DMGT we realise that if you 
want to survive in this sector, 
you must be able to react 
quickly and efficiently to the 
rapidly changing media world. 
Autonomous management 
keeps decision-making  
close to the customer. Real 
innovation comes from having 
a customer focus. Our 
decentralised model provides 
a fertile environment for 
innovative people and, in turn, 
a positive breeding ground for 
innovative ideas.
At Group level, the Investment 
and Finance Committee  
works alongside the DMGT 
Leadership Team, making 
decisions on investment and 
capital allocation, acting 
independently from the 
divisions, and overseeing 
Group strategy development. 
The Leadership Team 
comprises all the divisional 
company leaders, together 
with the DMGT executive. Its 
remit is to focus on developing 
DMGT Group-wide longer-term 
strategy, on furthering 
cross-Group co-operation 
when and where this makes 
sense, and to guide policy on 
cross-divisional matters, for 
example Group leadership 
courses, communications, 
international expansion  
and aspects of technical 
capability. It does not replace 
the decision making and 
accountability structures  
in place through our 
decentralised operating 
structure.
We are developing 
DMGT into a truly 
global growth company, 
with sustainable 
earnings, consistent 
dividend growth and 
increasing exposure  
to high growth 
economies.
Our decentralised 
model provides a fertile 
environment for 
innovative people and 
a positive breeding 
ground for innovative 
ideas.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW continued
On compensation, we do not 
apply a ‘one size fits all’ policy. 
This is a big strength, reflecting 
the value of the decentralised 
model. A series of templates 
has been created. Local 
incentive plans are in place 
and the Remuneration 
Committee takes care to 
ensure that compensation is 
aligned with the particular 
circumstances of each 
business. 
Information sharing and 
technology
We recognise that our future  
is largely digital, whether it be 
in the consumer or in B2B 
markets, and we are uniquely 
placed to take key learnings 
and experience from one to 
inform the other. Accordingly, 
we have encouraged the 
sharing of more information 
regarding technological 
developments across the 
Group, particularly regarding 
new product development 
and entering new markets.  
We launched DMGT Chatter, 
which already serves as an 
excellent pan-Group idea 
sharing tool. We have made 
more use of the services of Bill 
Raduchel, our technology 
expert, to advise us at Group 
level during the year. Last  
year I reported that since 
technology defines our 
businesses, driving the 
presentation of content, we 
had carried out a study of 
technology systems and what 
our future requirements would 
be. During the year we started 
taking actions based on this 
analysis. A further example of 
information sharing is in the 
establishment this year of an 
energy forum, under the 
guidance of David Dutton, 
which has gained excellent 
traction by putting executives 
from dmg::information, 
dmg::events and Euromoney 
together to exchange ideas.
Active portfolio 
management
When I became Chief 
Executive in 2008, I recognised 
the need to focus on a 
narrower range of activities in 
order to concentrate human 
resources and financial capital 
where the most potential for 
long-term growth and value 
creation existed. I stated that 
we would remain active 
managers of our portfolio  
of businesses and apply our 
investment criteria vigorously 
in determining where to 
allocate capital. At the same 
time we would maintain our 
long-term perspective and 
rate of internal investment to 
drive organic growth. 
The investment criteria that  
I identified were to focus  
on having businesses which 
operate in attractive growth 
markets. Such businesses should 
have products or services  
that are highly innovative  
and highly valued, ones which 
customers repeat buy. We 
have a strong bias towards 
market leaders. Businesses with 
these characteristics will not 
only grow but be high margin, 
cash generative and produce 
a high return on capital. We 
are also focused on capturing 
and retaining entrepreneurial 
management and we give 
preference to businesses  
which can benefit from DMGT’s 
long-term perspective. 
We have fully adopted these 
investment criteria both in  
new investments and in the 
management of currently 
owned businesses. In keeping 
with this approach, we have 
further refocused the portfolio 
with a range of disposals and 
reorganisations.
As well as maintaining our 
focus on organic growth  
and on nurturing our existing 
businesses, we have also 
made a significant acquisition 
in July, backing Euromoney  
in its acquisition of an 85% 
interest in Ned Davis Research 
Group, the US-based provider 
of independent financial 
research to institutional 
investors. We are keen on 
bolt-on acquisitions to 
strengthen the competitive 
position of our businesses: and 
dmg information have made a 
further attractive acquisition, 
that of On-Geo for Landmark 
which has now been 
combined with its Inframation 
business to give Landmark a 
market leading position in the 
German market. 
We have also made a number 
of disposals of businesses 
which had become non-core. 
These were RMSI, the Indian-
based geographic information 
services division of Risk 
Management Solutions, 
Sanborn, dmg::information’s 
business serving the geospatial 
market in the USA, and 
dmg::events’ US retail-focused 
events managed by George 
Little Management (GLM). We 
also disposed of 
dmg::information’s stake in 
CoStar Group, Inc, acquired in 
exchange for Property & 
Portfolio Research in July 2009. 
Combined with our strong 
operating cash flow 
generation, this has reduced 
our debt significantly. We are 
now in a good position to 
make further acquisitions,  
but will continue our policy  
to prioritise a programme of 
selective smaller scale deals 
which we can develop and 
which can benefit from our 
longer-term perspective.  
We will continue to divest on  
a periodic basis where our 
track record over recent years 
is good.
Review of the year
DMGT has delivered a solid  
set of results. Our international 
B2B companies have again 
increased their revenues  
and adjusted profits,  
reflecting the strength of  
their market positions. Our  
UK consumer businesses have 
proved resilient in the face of 
weak consumer advertising, 
particularly in the third quarter, 
and taken together with higher 
newsprint prices, resulted in 
profits being down sharply for 
the year. There has been a 
strong focus on operational 
efficiency throughout the 
Group and we have sought 
further cost savings, 
particularly through the 
decision to relocate our  
Surrey Quays printing 
operation to a green-field  
site in Thurrock, Essex. 
Notwithstanding the fact that 
operating profit fell by 5% and 
operating margin from 15% to 
We are embracing new 
technologies to meet 
changing customer 
needs and improve 
efficiency. 
Our energy forum  
has gained excellent 
traction. It’s bringing 
together executives  
to exchange ideas.  15

14%, our debt has fallen 
significantly. We have beaten 
our debt: ebitda target range 
of 2 to 2.5 times and have 
eliminated bank debt. We now 
have cash on deposit. We 
have maintained our rate of 
investment in new products 
and services during the year. 
DMGT has always been a  
first mover in the media and 
information industry. Our results 
demonstrate once again the 
success of the decision to 
diversify and move away from 
a dependence on UK 
newspapers. But at the same 
time our national newspapers 
have strengthened further 
their market-leading positions. 
We are experiencing growth in 
our newer consumer digital 
business and in our strong 
grouping of B2B sector 
companies. 
Business to Business 
Summary
I am pleased to report that our 
B2B operations achieved good 
growth in the year. They 
reported combined revenues 
of £892 million, 8% higher than 
last year, with an underlying 
increase of 10%. Operating 
profit was up by 4%. The 
underlying increase, including 
adjusting for an additional 
charge for Euromoney’s 
management incentive 
scheme, was 14%. The overall 
B2B margin was 25%.
Risk Management Solutions
RMS had a solid year of 
revenue and profit growth. 
Revenues increased by 4%  
on a reported basis, with an 
underlying increase of 11%. 
Operating profit rose by 6% in 
spite of the inclusion of RMSI’s 
£4 million loss up until its 
disposal in August; underlying 
profit grew by 21%. 
Subscriptions continued to 
grow well, with a renewal rate 
of approximately 95%.
RMS has multiple growth 
drivers. Whilst continuing to 
focus primarily on in its core 
commercial catastrophe 
modelling business, it is aiming 
to establish itself as a platform 
solution provider, beginning a 
significant development 
programme on a new software 
platform, which is expected to 
generate future, multi-year 
revenue growth, as explained 
on page 24. The company  
also made good progress  
in addressing opportunities  
to model additional risk 
categories, mostly in the  
area of life and health.
dmg::information
dmg::information had a good 
year, with reported revenue up 
3%. Underlying revenues grew  
by 7%, which is a good 
performance given the 
economic backdrop. 
Operating profits were 
unchanged, but with an 
underlying increase of 9%  
year-on-year.
dmg::information’s strategy 
remains focused on investing in 
those companies within the 
existing portfolio which 
operate in an attractive sector 
and have the combination of 
attractive business models, 
strong market positions, growth 
potential and good 
management. Its ambition to 
invest in must-have, high-
growth, innovative business 
information companies 
remains unchanged, as does 
its remit to diversify DMGT by 
sector, by business model and 
by geography. 
dmg::events 
dmg::events had a very good 
year with both underlying 
revenues and underlying 
profits increasing by 14%. The 
strong momentum that started 
in the latter half of 2010 has 
continued through the past 
year due to exhibitions and 
events being late-cycle 
media. The reported revenues 
and profits benefited from two 
of our large biennial shows 
taking place in the year. The 
sale of GLM was completed  
in September. 
The remediation phase has 
been completed by ‘right-
sizing’ the portfolio and 
reinvesting in the ongoing 
events. The business is now 
moving into its third phase of 
sustainable, profitable growth. 
This will involve continued 
portfolio management, the 
driving of new launches by 
building off the big shows in 
Energy and the Middle East. 
With respect to the latter,  
there have been several new 
launches including new shows 
in Saudi Arabia and organic 
investment. The Ad:Tech 
business in digital marketing is 
growing strongly as is Evanta in 
executive conferences. dmg 
events will also look to make 
selected targeted small 
acquisitions.
Euromoney Institutional 
Investor
Euromoney’s operating profit 
was up 9%, before its capital 
appreciation plan (CAP) 
expenses, maintaining its 
impressive recent history of 
profits growth, illustrated on 
page 30. 
These results confirm the value 
of Euromoney’s strategy to 
build a more resilient and 
better focused business by 
increasing the proportion  
of revenues derived from 
subscription products. With 
subscriptions now accounting 
for nearly a half of total 
revenues. A predominantly 
publishing driven business has 
been transformed to one with 
significant activities in 
electronic information and 
database services. 
Euromoney has outperformed 
expectations, allowing 
management to shift its focus 
to positioning the business  
for growth, both from existing 
products as markets recover, 
and from investment in 
technology and new products. 
Euromoney’s performance 
and its shift into more 
subscription and digital activity 
and its global reach mean that 
the Board regards it as core to 
DMGT’s own strategic global 
growth ambitions. 
Euromoney’s separate listing 
on the London Stock Exchange 
has enabled it to introduce 
incentive plans which have 
motivated management  
to grow the company 
significantly over recent years. 
We remain a supportive 
shareholder, fully backing its 
management’s expansion 
DMGT has always 
been a first mover  
in the media and 
information industry.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW continued
strategy. We have maintained 
our equity interest at around 
67% and are taking opportunities 
to increase it, as they arise. 
Consumer media
At A&N Media, the testing 
economic conditions adversely 
affected both Northcliffe’s 
classified revenues and the 
Mail titles’ display advertising 
revenues. Combined revenues 
were £1,098 million, an 
underlying decrease of 2%  
and a fall of 4% on a reported 
basis. Together with discounted 
cover price-related marketing 
activity for The Mail on Sunday, 
and a further increase in the 
price of newsprint, this meant 
that operating profits 
decreased by 20%. The pursuit 
of cost efficiencies in shared 
back office functions and 
service centres continued 
during the year. A&N Media’s 
underlying margin fell from 11% 
to 8%. Headcount reduced by 
740 (10%).
A drive for efficiency has 
delivered a leaner and more 
robust base on which to grow. 
Alongside this, investment 
continues in new and emerging 
business models, particularly 
MailOnline which is key to 
future growth, and A&N Media 
Enterprises, which sells 
products and services directly 
to customers.
Consumers are increasingly 
adopting new mobile devices 
to access digitally delivered 
news, entertainment and 
information. Advertising is 
following this trend, moving 
away from printed press. But 
the growth in the number of 
55+ aged newspaper readers 
has softened the readership 
decline for the Daily Mail which 
continues to outperform the 
market. MailOnline grew 
rapidly and increased its global 
reach, positioning us well to 
capture share of digital 
advertising. 
Associated Newspapers 
The Mail titles, despite 
operating in a sector in 
long-term decline, is and will 
be a core business for many 
years to come and will 
continue to offer real growth 
opportunities, by building off 
the strength of the brand, for 
example, through MailOnline 
which has significant growth 
opportunities ahead of it. 
Content has been at the heart 
of our success at Associated 
and we continue to invest in 
editorial quality. The graph on 
page 35 shows that our actions 
are delivering success with 
circulation relatively stable 
and market share rising. This 
was due in part to the success 
of the Mail Rewards Club 
initiative.
Our national free morning 
newspaper, Metro, increased 
its distribution and advertising 
volumes. It extended into new 
advertising categories and 
reported record profits. It also 
grew its digital offering. 
Mail Digital made further 
progress this year, recording a 
63% improvement in revenue. 
Traffic to its primary website, 
MailOnline, increased 
significantly, largely through its 
targeting of the US market. We 
opened an office in New York, 
alongside that in Los Angeles, 
aimed at increasing US 
content, audience and 
thereby driving US advertising 
sales. This has contributed 
towards a 62% year-on-year 
increase in US daily unique 
visitors in October 2011. 
On a global basis, MailOnline 
became the world’s second 
most visited English language 
newspaper website. It is 
differentiated in the UK from 
the Mail newspapers by its 
particular treatment of news 
and entertainment, which 
appeals to a younger 
demographic, the majority  
of whom do not buy a Mail 
newspaper. An iPad version 
was launched in April, 
alongside our iPhone and  
iPod Touch versions. We see 
digital publishing as a growth 
opportunity, and a means of 
extending the Mail brand. 
Whilst MailOnline is growing 
audience we expect to retain 
our policy of free access. Our 
approach to distribution 
channels and pricing remains 
flexible. 
Digital-only businesses 
Our digital-only verticals in the 
jobs, property, motors and 
travel markets increased 
underlying revenues by 5%.  
The recruitment and property 
sectors both grew strongly, 
offset by challenging markets 
in motors and travel. In 
October 2011, A&N Media 
agreed to merge the online 
property business of its Digital 
Property Group with Zoopla 
Limited. This merger will create 
a genuine opportunity to 
challenge the dominant 
market leader in the online 
property sector. We believe 
that the combination of our 
respective digital property 
assets will benefit both 
consumers and clients. Under 
the proposed merger, A&N 
Media will retain a 55% interest 
in the newly merged entity. The 
completion of the merger is 
subject to competition 
authority clearance.
Northcliffe Media
Northcliffe’s titles continued  
to be affected by weak 
advertising markets, with total 
revenues down by 10%. In 
March, we appointed Steve 
Auckland, formerly Managing 
Director of Metro to be 
responsible for Northcliffe’s 
print publishing, with Roland 
Bryan running the local digital 
operations including the Local 
People business. A programme 
to extract further efficiencies 
and reduce costs was initiated 
including a re-organisation 
and simplification of the 
management structure. A 
review of the portfolio was 
carried out resulting in a 
rationalisation of the number 
of free newspapers published 
and the creation of one 
recruitment call centre for  
the whole business. Where 
profitable we are switching 
some daily titles to weekly 
publications and four such 
changes were made 
successfully. In Hull, 
Nottingham and Bristol  
new publishers have been 
appointed to enable these 
centres better to adapt  
to their individual market 
circumstances. 
Investment continues 
in new and emerging 
business models, 
particularly 
MailOnline. 17

We have again demonstrated 
the benefits of our diversified 
international portfolio of 
market-leading businesses. 
Our priorities
The environment in which we 
operate remains unsettled,  
just as it was this time last year. 
In light of our performance,  
we continue to apply the  
same priorities. We remain 
disciplined about our 
approach to costs and 
acquisitions, whilst continuing 
to work on building a pipeline 
of new innovative products, 
and in growing a target list of 
attractive bolt-on acquisitions. 
Given the significant prevailing 
economic uncertainties, we 
will run the Group with the 
utmost prudence.
At our first Investor Day in 
March 2009, I stated that our 
aim for DMGT was to be a 
modern company of 
tomorrow, not a legacy 
company of the past. We  
have a much sounder platform 
today than we did then  
on which to execute this 
objective, due to the 
management actions taken 
right across the Group, and 
from the recovery in a number 
of key markets. Therefore our 
strategy remains unchanged.
Whilst we believe print is far 
from dead, our growth lies in 
digital media in both consumer 
and in B2B, and we are 
increasingly focused on doing 
what is needed to excel in the 
digital world.
We envisage DMGT becoming 
a more global and faster 
growing company. We plan to 
be nimble, bold and decisive 
in order to realise this vision. 
Our objective is to ensure 
profitable sustainable growth 
over the long term.
Share price performance
Our share performance 
remains important to us as an 
indicator as to whether our 
strategy is understood and 
appreciated by institutional 
investors.
The price of our widely traded 
‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting Shares 
has again been volatile, 
despite stock lending of the 
shares reducing significantly 
below 5% of the free float. The 
share price started the 
financial year at £5.26, rising to 
a high of £5.95 at the start of 
February. The shares fell as low 
as £3.43 in September, due 
largely to external factors 
outside our control, before 
closing the year at £3.63. 
As explained in last year’s 
Business Review, as a 
consequence of a decision  
by FTSE, in response to the 
Financial Services Authority’s 
Policy Notice in February 2010, 
to adopt listing classifications 
for determining the weighting 
of share classes in their indices, 
DMGT’s weighting in the UK 
Index Series will fall from 75%  
to 0% when our ‘A’ shares are 
redesignated by the FSA as 
having a standard listing on 
31st May, 2012. DMGT will 
remain a premium listed 
company, following this 
change, by virtue of its 
Ordinary shares. Pure index 
funds tend to hold only around 
5% of our ‘A’ shares.
New advertising packages 
and sales campaigns have 
been introduced to improve 
revenue growth. 
The much-mooted talk of 
potential consolidation within 
the regional newspaper 
industry has not yet come 
about. Whilst we can see 
benefits from consolidation, 
the Board has decided not to 
put further capital into the 
regional newspaper industry 
because of the more certain 
potential of other opportunities 
for investment. We remain 
committed to the continuing 
transformation of Northcliffe 
because we believe there will 
always be a demand for local 
news and information. Our 
attempt to safeguard the 
future of some of Northcliffe’s 
titles in Kent by selling them to 
the Kent Messenger Group was 
thwarted by the Office of Fair 
Trading which referred the 
sales to the Competition 
Commission for further 
investigation causing the 
acquirer to withdraw. We 
believe it is now imperative 
that changes are made to 
allow the industry to 
consolidate in a way that can 
safeguard its future.
A&N International Media
Whilst print advertising 
declined, circulation and 
digital revenues both grew, as 
did the audience visiting our 
digital businesses. Headcount 
has been reduced and 
significant savings made. 
Summary
The Group’s B2B companies 
increased their overall profit by 
4%, which was offset by the 
profits of A&N Media being 
down 20%. As a consequence, 
74% of this year’s operating 
profit was generated from the 
Group’s B2B operations and 
26% from consumer, compared 
to 67% and 33% last year. A 
significant part of our 
operations and more than half 
of the Group’s operating profits 
again derived from outside the 
UK, which also has the effect 
of reducing the Group’s 
exposure to media regulation.

Capital structure
The Company has not made a 
capital call on its shareholders 
since 1933. Capital growth is 
funded by long-term debt and 
by retained earnings. Since the 
late 1980s, our strategy has 
been to seek to raise the 
dividend in real terms and 
since 2002, the Board’s policy 
has been to target a real rate 
of growth in the dividend in  
the region of 5% to 7% on  
the basis of the Directors’ 
confidence in the Group’s 
long-term financial health. 
Whilst maintaining its policy of 
seeking to increase the 
dividend in real terms over the 
economic cycle, the Board 
has declared a final dividend 
up 6%, making an increase of 
6% for the year. As shown 
above, the compound 
dividend growth over the last 
23 years is 10% in nominal 
terms, which is an increase of 
7% in real terms. 
As we now have surplus cash, 
we will look to buy back any 
available bonds, especially 
those due for repayment in 
March 2013, at the right price. 
On 30th September, we 
repurchased £25 million of our 
Bonds due 2018. Share buy 
backs are not currently 
attractive, given our strategy 
to grow the business, the 
scarcity of available capital 
and our desire to regain 
investment grade status. They 
will be considered, however, at 
the time any major acquisition 
is contemplated. We envisage 
repaying our 2013 Bonds from 
our cash resources. Containing 
and eventually eliminating 
significant liability risk and 
volatility from our pension 
schemes remains a high 
priority. 
By the year end, we had 
eliminated bank debt and 
have £328 million of unused 
bank facilities. Having 
comfortably stayed within our 
debt: ebitda limit of 2.4 times 
by achieving a ratio of 1.99 
times, we will continue to 
manage the ratio down 
through strong cash flow 
generation, in order to create 
more capacity to satisfy 
attractive acquisition and 
investment opportunities. 
Whilst we can run the Group 
without having to raise new 
finance, we will want to do so 
in order to sustain the Group’s 
long-term growth ambitions. 
Therefore regaining investment 
grade status remains an 
important objective.
Resources 
The Group’s main resources 
are its brands, reputation, the 
market-leading position of its 
major businesses and above 
all its people. I realise that the 
skills required of leaders in our 
industry ten years ago are not 
the same today. Superior 
business performance starts 
with superior people. We 
cannot capitalise on the future 
unless we invest in the talent  
of today, in the leaders of 
tomorrow. It is my overriding 
priority to ensure that we 
continue to attract and 
promote the very best talent 
and reward talent suitably  
in line with shareholders’ 
interests. 
Our commitment to raising the 
bar on talent is continuing and 
increasingly effective, 
applying human capital where 
growth prospects are best. Two 
DMGT-wide executive training 
courses were held and talent 
reviews are taking root in every 
business.
We made several further key 
appointments in order to 
populate the Group with new 
superior talent, from both 
within and outside the Group. 
At Group level, Stephen 
Daintith joined us in January, 
succeeding Peter Williams as 
Finance Director at the end of 
March. We hired Galen Poss in 
December 2010 to the newly 
created role of Chief 
Operating Officer of 
dmg::events. 
Communications
We continue our commitment 
to raise the profile of DMGT 
and communicate the quality, 
performance and prospects of 
the Group, both internally and 
externally. We have increased 
the regularity and consistency 
of our communications. Our 
Investor Day in March was 
positively received. We are 
planning a further Investor Day 
to be held in London on 18th 
April, 2012.
A variety of approaches to 
staff communications exist 
within the Group, as explained 
in our CR report. In September, 
we launched a business 
collaboration tool called 
Chatter, which encourages 
staff to share ideas and 
enables communication  
on a Group-wide basis. 
Stakeholder relationships 
and Corporate Responsibility 
Across the Group we take 
corporate responsibility (CR) 
seriously and it permeates our 
outlook on the environment, 
the way we treat our 
employees, our customers and 
suppliers, as well as on local 
community issues.  19

DMGT companies are 
combining innovation and 
business knowledge to further 
corporate responsibility issues. 
Metro’s inaugural four-day 
EcoVelocity event at Battersea 
Power station in London is a 
case in point. The event 
focused on low-carbon 
motoring and showcased the 
latest low emission vehicles 
from leading manufacturers. 
We recognise that our 
businesses have an impact  
on the environment, be  
that through our printing 
operations, offices, transport  
or other activities. We are truly 
committed to ensuring that, 
where possible, our impact on 
the environment is minimised. 
The greatest impact we  
make arises from our printing 
operations. Here, I am pleased 
to say that we have been 
diligent in measuring and 
reducing waste in our usage  
of materials, and through  
our analysis of our carbon 
footprint, monitoring and 
improving our efficiency in the 
use of energy. 
We started to measure our 
footprint in 2006 and the graph 
shown below illustrates that the 
Group’s emissions have fallen 
steadily since then. 
At Harmsworth Quays, our 
largest printing plant, and 
Northcliffe House, the 
Company’s headquarters and 
the London base of Associated 
Newspapers, Northcliffe  
Media and dmg::events, we 
maintained the key 
international environmental 
standard ISO 14001. 
Community involvement is 
integral to the way we run our 
company, as is its importance 
to the personal motivation of 
our employees. We donate 
money, time and in-kind 
donations such as advertising 
space, and staff participate in 
a huge range of activities, 
including fundraising, 
organising events and acting 
as trustees to charitable 
initiatives. 
Over the last six months there 
has been a considerable 
amount of public discussion 
about the conduct and 
regulation of the press and the 
launch of the Leveson Inquiry. 
At DMGT, our journalists have 
for a number of years received 
regular training and 
communications on the PCC 
Code of Practice (which 
forbids telephone hacking), 
the Data Protection Act and, 
most recently, on the UK 
Bribery Act. Furthermore, it is a 
condition of employment (and 
is written into employment 
contracts) that our journalists 
comply with the PCC Code 
and the Data Protection Act 
and now includes compliance 
with the Bribery Act, following 
its introduction on 1st July. Any 
breach of the Code or the law 
is a serious disciplinary matter 
that results in immediate 
dismissal. Thus the tone from 
the top and culture at 
Associated Newspapers has 
always made it clear that 
compliance in these areas is 
non-negotiable.
There have been comments  
in the media on the Mail titles’ 
use of ‘inquiry agents’. In  
the 2006 ‘What Price Privacy’ 
report, the Information 
Commissioner expressed 
concerns about the 
widespread use of ‘inquiry 
agents’ by many organisations. 
It would seem that, for  
the most part, it related  
to the tracing of individuals. 
Following this report, the 
Associated Newspapers 
Editor-in-Chief, banned  
the use of ‘inquiry agents’. 
In the context of these 
measures, the Editor-in-Chief, 
Paul Dacre, was able to inform 
a Parliamentary Committee  
in July that he had never 
countenanced hacking or 
blagging and the Daily Mail 
has never published a story 
that he knew, either at the 
time or subsequently, was 
based on a hacked message 
or any other source of material 
that had been obtained 
unlawfully. 
In August, the Risk Committee 
and Paul Dacre initiated an 
internal review of editorial 
policy and process. This  
review was conducted by  
the Head of Editorial Legal 
Services. It considered editorial 
policies, ethics, training, 
communications and 
payments. This was a routine 
assessment which was seen as 
a sensible step to reconfirm 
and give comfort that 
appropriate policies and 
procedures exist over our 
editorial practices. The review 
was discussed by the Risk 
Committee of the Board, as 
explained in the Risk 
Committee section of the 
Corporate Governance Report 
on pages 59 and 60. 
A further important part of  
our overall culture and control 
environment is the DMGT  
Code of Conduct, which we 
require all our staff to follow. 
This was updated, particularly 
in light of the Bribery Act, and 
re-communicated to all staff  
in July. 
For more detailed information 
on our CR activities, please  
see the CR Report on pages  
44 to 47.

DMGT and our Employees 
The number of employees fell 
by 2,590 from 14,592 at the 
beginning of the year to 12,002 
at the year end, a decrease of 
18%. Of this reduction, 2,253 
was due to disposals, 
principally within RMS’s India 
operations. Excluding 
acquisitions and disposals and 
with a continued focus on cost 
reduction, the number of 
employees fell by 472 in the 
year. Within this number there 
was a fall within A&N Media of 
740 (10%), mainly due to further 
job losses at Northcliffe Media 
of 601 people (19%), while the 
principal increases were from 
the acquisitions of Ned Davis 
Research and On-Geo . 
The Company attaches  
great importance to a clear 
understanding of personal 
financial issues by its 
employees, a view which led 
to the development by DMGT 
Pensions of an online 
workplace financial 
information website (www.
timeformoney.co.uk) in the 
prior year. It is early days for 
this innovative facility but there 
are interesting possibilities for 
this application in supporting 
broader financial 
communications to employees 
by the Group.
In the first quarter of 2012, we 
plan to relaunch our share 
incentive plan, DMGT 
SharePurchase+, which is 
available to all eligible UK staff 
to give them the opportunity 
to own the Company’s shares, 
so that they can benefit if we 
are successful in meeting our 
financial objectives.
DMGT has been operating 
defined benefit pension 
schemes, primarily in its 
newspaper businesses, for a 
long time and has a reputation 
for the quality of pension 
provision. However, the cost of 
providing this benefit continues 
to rise as people are expected 
to live longer and, more 
recently, as turmoil in financial 
markets has reduced 
expected investment returns. 
In addition, regulatory 
changes introduced to  
protect pensioners make it  
less attractive to use defined 
benefit pension provision  
as a form of remuneration.
Given the value of the 
Company’s defined benefit 
pension commitments 
compared to the current 
market valuation of the Group, 
this cost needs to be controlled 
to ensure the financial health 
of the Company and these 
pension schemes. So, having 
previously closed its defined 
benefit schemes to new 
employees, the Board 
introduced a series of 
measures during the year  
to help secure the financial 
health of these plans into  
the future. These were 
communicated to relevant 
staff in December 2010  
and introduced, following 
consultation, on 1st April.  
All members of the schemes 
retain benefits accrued to  
that date which are increased 
in line with the Retail Price 
Index up to 5%. From 1st April 
onwards, the link to final salary 
has been broken and they 
earn a cash credit on the basis 
of their current year’s salary 
which increases in line with  
the Consumer Price index.
All new employees of A&N 
Media are now being offered 
a defined contribution pension 
plan, which has brought this 
division into line with our other 
newer and more 
internationally focused 
divisions where we have long 
believed this type of pension 
plan to be more appropriate.
Outlook
We have entered our new 
financial year with our 
businesses performing well and 
in line with our expectations. 
We expect underlying growth 
in revenue and profit to be 
delivered by all our B2B 
companies, A&N Media’s 
progress will be primarily 
dependent on the advertising 
environment which remains 
volatile and difficult, and on 
cost reduction. As referred  
to earlier the degree of 
economic uncertainty, 
especially in Europe, makes 
forecasting especially difficult 
and may well negatively 
impact our current 
expectations.
RMS has started the year 
strongly with a solid sales 
pipeline and a range of 
significant development 
programmes, including its new 
software platform. RMS 
expects to achieve revenue 
growth in the mid-to-high 
single digits and maintain 
margins of around 30%. 
dmg::information expects to 
drive continued solid organic 
growth, due to the strength of 
market positions and through 
new product initiatives. Growth 
would be enhanced by any 
sustained improvements in the 
economic environment, 
particularly for our property 
and financial businesses. 
Overall, dmg::information 
expects to achieve high single 
digit revenue growth and to 
maintain operating margins  
at around 20%.
At dmg::events, the positive 
momentum experienced 
through 2011 has continued 
into the autumn, with bookings 
for key events showing positive 
trends. The reported results for 
2011/12 will be affected by the 
disposal of GLM and by only 
one of our three major biennial 
shows taking place. On an 
underlying basis, and fuelled 
by our launch plans, revenue 
growth is expected to continue 
in the high single digits, with 
margins of around 20%. 
Our growth lies in 
digital media in both 
in B2B and consumer.  
We are increasingly 
focused on doing what 
is needed to excel in 
the digital world. 21

For Euromoney, despite the 
continuing volatility and 
uncertainty in financial 
markets, the broad outlook for 
the first quarter of the new 
financial year is reasonably 
positive. Euromoney expects 
the trading environment after 
that to be more challenging 
and, as usual at this time, 
forward revenue visibility 
beyond the first quarter is 
limited other than for 
subscriptions. For 2011/12, it 
expects to achieve mid-single 
digit revenue growth and to 
maintain operating margin 
(before its CAP charges).
Within A&N Media, national 
advertising revenue at 
Associated in the first eight 
weeks of the new year was 
down 2% on last year, with 
continued limited visibility  
on future trends. Circulation 
revenues will be boosted by 
the full year impact of the 
Monday to Friday cover price 
rise for the Daily Mail in July 
2011 and that for the Saturday 
edition in October 2011. 
Overall, Associated expects  
to achieve low single digit 
revenue growth due in part to 
the Olympics and margins in 
the region of 10%, with cost 
efficiency helping to protect 
profitability. We expect 
revenues from our digital 
products, especially 
MailOnline, to grow rapidly.
Northcliffe is going through  
a substantial change 
programme and will benefit 
from the full-year flow through 
of cost saving initiatives 
actioned in the previous six 
months. Advertising revenues 
have continued to track  
the year-on-year trends 
experienced in 2010/11 with a 
decline of 7% on a like-for-like 
basis last year in the first eight 
weeks of the new financial 
year (10% on a reported basis). 
The first quarter and outlook for 
the year as a whole are not 
expected to improve on this 
trend. Cost reduction initiatives 
will continue and margins are 
expected to be stable. 
Northcliffe is now focused on 
building new revenue 
opportunities from its print and 
digital products. 
It is not a coincidence that 
much of this year’s Business 
Review echoes that of last 
year. It is entirely intentional 
and demonstrates our 
unwavering commitment to 
the long-term strategic 
objectives I laid out on 
becoming Chief Executive.  
For the Group as a whole, that 
strategy remains focused on 
our key pillars: investing in 
innovation, achieving greater 
efficiency, nurturing talent  
and driving growth. With these 
factors in mind, all of our 
businesses will continue to 
invest in order to secure future 
growth and ensure that their 
financial and talent resources 
are appropriately managed. 
My colleagues and I remain 
confident that DMGT is well 
placed for 2012 and beyond.

Key performance indicators
We use a variety of other key performance indicators to track 
our progress towards our goals. These relate to the elements 
of our business model and can be found in the strategic report 
on pages 12 and 13.
Adjusted performance measures used by the Group are 
explained and reconciled to the equivalent IFRS measures 
in the section entitled Performance measures on  
pages 172 to 174.
1  C ontinuing oper ations . 2  Figures for 2012 and 2011 have been restated to reflect the reclassification 
in 2013 of the UK conventional power business as a discontinued operation 
and the adoption of IAS 19 (Revised 2011) ‘Employee Benefits’ .
3  Adjusted profit before tax represents profit before tax before 
exceptional items, the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, 
asbestos-related costs and interest expense (net of insurance recoveries), 
and the Group’s share of tax on the results of joint ventures.
4  Adjusted diluted earnings per share represents profit for the year before 
exceptional items, the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, 
asbestos-related costs and interest expense (net of insurance recoveries), 
and the tax effect of those items, divided by the diluted number of 
ordinary shares.
5  The dividend values disclosed in cents were calculated at the following year 
end exchange rates: 
31 December 2015 – 1.4739 
31 December 2014 – 1.5593 
31 December 2013 – 1.6563 
31 December 2012 – 1.6255 
31 December 2011 – 1.5541 
This represents an estimate and no representation can be made that 
the dividend could have been converted into US dollars at this rate, and 
as a result these figures have been included in square brackets in the 
table above.

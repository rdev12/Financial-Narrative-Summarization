CEO’s statement  
André Brown, Chief Executive Officer, 26
th
 February 2015 
 
Introduction 
We are very pleased with the strong 
operational and financial progress 
achieved by ATTRAQT during 2014. 
We have grown our customer base 
significantly, adding important 
marquee names to our client roster, 
further building the volume of 
recurring revenue.  
 
The focus on our production 
processes earlier in the year has 
paid off with a significant increase in 
the number of new client sites being 
delivered in 2014. Success in sales 
and production has contributed to 
the growth in revenue, which we 
expect to see continue in 2015.  
 
We have made some significant 
enhancements to the Platform 
during the year and have an 
exciting development programme 
for 2015. In addition, we are 
working on a number of important 
technology partnerships to extend 
the functionality of the Platform 
and to expand the use of our 
technology into new market 
segments. 
 
Business model 
The Company’s business model is 
based on a recurring monthly 
service fee plus a one-off set-up 
fee and additional follow-on 
project fees. Clients sign up for a 
minimum of 12 months but some 
larger clients sign up for a longer 
period of 2-3 years.  
 
  
The current sales model is based on 
direct sales via a dedicated sales team. 
Due to the importance of the 
functionality provided by the Platform 
to our clients, client loyalty is strong 
and churn is typically less than 5% of 
revenue per annum, with most clients 
automatically renewing at the end of 
the contractual term. This rate 
remains the same throughout the 
year, on an annualised basis. 
 
Growth strategy 
The Company’s current objective is to 
become the merchandising platform 
of choice for online retailers in 
Western Europe and the US with the 
longer-term aim of taking on more 
global capacity. 
    
 
 
22 
ATTRAQT’s business plan is simple 
and scalable, founded on 5 key 
elements: 1) Focus on sales and 
marketing to grow client base and 
volume of recurring revenue; 2) 
Expand the company’s productive 
capacity to keep pace with 
accelerating sales; 3) Develop 
strategic partnerships – both sales 
and technology – to accelerate sales 
growth and extend our product 
offering; 4) Extend the capabilities of 
the Platform through continued 
investment in platform development, 
adding new features and creating 
new products to create new revenue 
streams; and 5) Identify new markets 
and new ways to repurpose our 
technology. 
 
Review of sales & operations 
The Company has continued to grow 
the client-base in the year, adding 36 
new clients in the UK and the US 
(2013: 31) worth £0.89m on an 
annualised basis. These included 
important marquee names such as 
Ben Sherman, Cotton Traders, 
Heals, JD Williams, Kate Spade, 
Screwfix, Warehouse, Wilkinson 
and White Stuff – bringing the total 
number of clients by the end of 
December 2014 to 87 (2013: 60). 
 
The average value of new client 
contracts signed in 2014 has 
increased by 45% to £24,700, 
reflecting the clear return on 
investment we can demonstrate for 
our products, the growing maturity of 
the sales team and process and the 
increasing size of our typical customer. 
 
Production also performed well in 
2014, with the Company delivering 35 
new client sites during the year 
bringing the total live sites to 110 by 
year end. The Company also started 
24 new site builds at the end of 2014 
which are scheduled to be delivered in 
2015.  
It is also pleasing to see existing 
clients trusting the Company to do 
follow on project work, such as 
RWD (responsive web design) 
projects and search auto-complete 
projects during 2014.  
 
The Company’s investment in 
excellent client service continues 
to pay dividends through low 
customer churn rates. We have 
achieved renewals from major 
clients, including BT Directories 
and Nectar both having  been 
clients since 2005, as well as Laura 
Ashley, Paperchase and Tesco 
Clothing. 
 
Interesting client 
implementations during the year 
included the following: 
 
Ellis Brigham decided to leverage 
the ‘check-out page’ by tempting 
customers to add extra items to 
their basket just before they pay. 
During Christmas trading, Ellis 
Brigham used the tools within 
Freestyle Merchandising to make 
sure the first two products in the 
‘recommendation zone’ were £10 
and £20 gift vouchers. This was a 
huge success as customers were 
triggered to buy gift vouchers 
where they normally would not 
have thought to do so. 
 
Life Style Sports recently went live 
with an 'iPad Ambassador’ program 
where in-store sales staff were 
supplied iPad tablets loaded with 
ATTRAQT’s Freestyle 
Merchandising solution. These 
devices are then deployed as an 
alternative browsing and check-out 
channel. The functionality 
replicates the main website which, 
in-store, allows for a wider range of 
products to be considered, 
alleviates stock issues, enables  
  
greater interaction with the customer 
and ultimately offers a more 
streamlined check out process. 
Customer feedback was very positive – 
they particularly liked the integration 
and ease of purchase and delivery. 
 
US expansion  
ATTRAQT has continued to focus on 
its US expansion plans following the 
establishment of a sales office in New 
York at the end of 2013. During 2014, 
we have successfully added 6 new US 
clients; Cufflinks.com, Ghurka, Kate 
Spade, Revolve Clothing, St. 
Bernards Sports Inc, and 1800 
Wheelchairs. The Company recently 
hired a senior sales person together 
with a telemarketer as part of its plans 
to continue the expansion of the US 
operation.  
 
Platform enhances and product 
development 
Platform enhancements and 
product developments increase the 
competitive strength of the 
Platform, with developments being 
largely driven by customer demand 
and trends in the market. In 
particular, 2014 saw the continuing 
development of the Platform with 
eight upgrades being deployed 
during the year.  
 
These releases included additional 
functionality such as improved 
currency and language support and 
options to synchronise product 
collections between sites. Other 
enhancements included increasing 
the performance and functionality of 
the Platform, integrating “A-B testing” 
to allow retailers to split site traffic to 
test different merchandising 
strategies, enhanced search 
capabilities and increased reporting 
functionality.

Market developments 
Online retail is a very competitive and 
high profile industry that is constantly 
evolving as retailers find new ways to 
drive conversion rates and increase 
customer loyalty.  
 
A new and developing market trend 
has been the move by retailers away 
from the automated ‘black-box’ 
method of providing product 
recommendations. The black box 
method works by blindly processing 
data through an algorithm, which 
neither provides an explanation for its 
recommendations nor allows the 
retailer to make adjustments to the 
recommendations.  
 
The market trend is towards a more 
nuanced approach that allows the 
retailer interaction with the 
recommendations being made and 
in particular to extend their 
merchandising strategies into those 
recommendations – a move which 
plays to the core strength of the 
Platform.  
 
One of the other big developments 
we have seen in the market is the 
move to multi-channel with retailers 
such as Tesco Clothing adopting in-
store tablets and kiosks, and to 
internationalisation; with clients 
such as Superdry rolling out 20 
international sites.  
 
The big challenge for both multi-
channel and internationalisation is 
how to ensure consistency of 
merchandising across channels and 
countries – something at which the 
Board believes ATTRAQT particularly 
excels through its Platform. We will 
continue to monitor market trends 
and enhance the Platform to ensure 
it meets customers’ needs.  
  
 
Financial review 
Total revenue was marginally 
ahead of expectations, having risen 
by 32% to £2.09m (2013: £1.58m) 
as new customers were added and 
existing customers launched 
additional sites. The recurring 
monthly revenue, which represents 
90% of total Group revenue also 
rose by 30% from £1.48m to 
£1.92m and the Exit Rate (year-
end annualised billing) for 2014 
was up 42% at £2.36m.  
   
The Group recorded losses before 
tax and at the EBITDA level, both at 
levels in line with management 
expectations. Losses before tax 
increased to £1.53m (2013: 
£0.56m), predominantly as a result 
of the AIM flotation expenses, the 
higher ongoing costs associated 
with the Company’s public listing 
and investing to grow the business. 
EBITDA losses rose to £0.74m 
(2013: £0.39m), driven by the 
investment in the US sales 
operation and in expanding the 
productive capacity of the 
Company. ATTRAQT continues to 
invest in technical enhancements 
to the existing product offerings 
and in new products. Some of this 
cost is capitalised but some is 
absorbed as part of the operating 
costs of the business.  
 
Admission to AIM 
As a UK-based technology 
company, AIM feels like the natural 
home for ATTRAQT. The Company 
spent the first half of 2014 
preparing for its admission to the 
AIM market, which was successfully 
completed on 19
th
 August 2014. 
 
We are proud of ATTRAQT’s 
progress to date, having achieved a 
great deal over the last 12 years, 
since our founding in 2003. We now 
have a strong portfolio of clients and 
believe that by joining AIM, we will 
have an increased profile with future 
customers and better access to funds, 
allowing us to further develop the 
Company both domestically and 
internationally.  
 
The capital raised on IPO, £1.25m 
before expenses by way of a share 
subscription, is being used to fund 
expansion of the US sales team, 
increase the productive capacity of the 
business and increase the 
functionality of the core platform. 
 
Outlook 
We are very pleased with the strong 
progress we have made in 2014. The 
management team is delivering to 
plan and we are gaining traction with 
leading retailers both in the UK and 
US, securing an increasing number of 
larger customers as retailers look for a 
means to grow their online revenues 
and interact with their customers in a 
more personalised manner. 
 
• There is real momentum in the 
sales process and we see this 
continuing into 2015.  
 
• The Platform is performing well, 
having coped with a significant 
increase in Platform usage in 2014 
compared to 2013 without 
affecting performance. 
 
• Our production processes are 
becoming more efficient, enabling 
the Company to support the 
increasing volume of new clients 
being signed. 
 
• The US sales operation continues 
to show good progress, having 
signed six new clients from a 
standing start.  
   
 
 
24 
 
  
• We have maintained our high 
margin and low revenue churn. 
With a strong pipeline of new 
business opportunities for 2015, 
and an increasingly sophisticated 
merchandising platform, we are 
confident in the ongoing success of 
ATTRAQT and in the outlook for 
2015 and beyond.

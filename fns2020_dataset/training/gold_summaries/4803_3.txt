 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2011

Chairman’s Statement
As I enter my tenth year as a Director of the Company, 
it is particularly encouraging to report another year of 
excellent progress at Diploma with key performance 
indicators all hitting record levels.
These results continue to demonstrate the strength and 
resilience of the Group’s business model which has 
enabled it to report consistent profitable growth over 
the past ten years. In July 2002 when I joined the 
Company, the Group had recently emerged from a 
major restructuring programme, having divested a 
number of traditional core businesses and returned a 
large proportion of the cash proceeds (ca. £70m) to 
shareholders. The Group had just reported pre-tax 
profits of £10.0m on revenues of £66.3m in respect of 
its continuing businesses. At the same time the Group’s 
market capitalisation was below £100m and total 
dividends were 2.6p per share. 
Over the ten years since then, the Group has generated 
strong double digit compound growth in revenues 
through a combination of steady organic growth and 
value enhancing acquisitions. Profits and dividends over 
this period have increased by a factor of more than four 
times. The total shareholder return (“TSR”) has also 
grown strongly relative to the FTSE mid-250 index 
(excluding investment trusts) (“FTSE 250”) which we have 
always seen as a benchmark for our performance. This 
strong relative performance was recognised in October 
of this year when the Company achieved the important 
milestone of promotion to the FTSE 250. 
Towards the end of this year, the Board approved 
proposals to further expand the activities in a number 
of key businesses by moving their existing activities to 
new enlarged facilities. These facilities will enable the 
momentum of growth to be sustained, within the 
constraints of an uncertain economic outlook. I remain 
confident that with its broader base of businesses, the 
resilience of its business model and its depth of 
resources, the Group is well placed to continue to make 
further progress in the next ten year period.
2011 Results
Group revenue increased by 26% to £230.6m (2010: 
£183.5m) with the businesses continuing to benefit from 
strong customer demand and with acquisitions 
completed over the past eighteen months, contributing 
£17.2m to this year’s Group result. The on-going focus 
on adding value to our delivery of product and services, 
together with the benefit of cost reductions carried 
out in 2009 has led to a further increase in adjusted 
operating margins to 19.6% (2010: 17.5%). As a result there 
was a substantial increase in adjusted operating profit, 
up by 41% to £45.2m (2010: £32.1m). Underlying Group 
revenues and adjusted operating profit increased by 17% 
and 31% respectively, after adjusting for the contribution 
from acquisitions and from the impact of currency 
movements on the translation of overseas results.
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 39% to £44.9m 
(2010: £32.2m) and adjusted earnings per share, which 
were boosted by the purchase of minority interests, 
increased by 48% to 27.9p (2010: 18.9p).
Free cash flow of £25.0m was generated as the 
businesses took advantage of better supply of product to 
rebuild working capital from the exceptionally low level 
last year. Last year’s free cash flow of £29.8m included 
£6.4m from the disposal of the Anachem businesses. 
Strong Balance Sheet
Given the current uncertainty in the global financial 
markets, the Board continues to focus on ensuring that it 
has sufficient financial resources to take advantage of 
acquisition opportunities. An important part of this 
process was the securing of new bank facilities, earlier in 
the year, which can provide up to £40m of borrowings. 
These facilities, together with net cash of £12.2m held at 
30 September 2011, ensure that the Group continues to 
maintain a strong balance sheet. 
Acquisitions 
During the year the Group spent £28.2m on acquisitions, 
principally in the Canadian Healthcare sector, with the 
acquisition of Carsen Medical Inc. (“CMI”) in December 
2010 and the purchase of the outstanding 25% minority 
shares in AMT. This latter acquisition of minorities 
facilitated the merger of AMT’s endoscopy business with 
CMI with effect from 30 September 2011.

It remains an important part of the Board’s strategy to 
accelerate growth through carefully selected, value 
enhancing acquisitions. A cornerstone of our acquisition 
programme has always been to target businesses where 
we see the opportunity for above average growth soon 
after the activities have been integrated into the Group.
 
We believe that the current stage of the business cycle 
provides a reasonably good environment for making 
such acquisitions. Good recent performance by target 
companies allows for sensible valuation discussions to be 
held with sellers, while the general economic uncertainty 
may encourage them to feel that the time may be right 
to sell their companies. 
Dividends
As a result of the excellent progress made by the 
Company during the year, the Board is recommending 
an increase in the final dividend of 37% to 8.5p per share 
(2010: 6.2p) which, subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 25 January 2012, 
to shareholders on the register at 9 December 2011. 
The total dividend per share for the year will be 12.0p 
which represents a 33% increase on 2010 and represents 
the twelfth successive year that the Company has 
reported an increase in dividends paid to shareholders. 
Governance
The importance of maintaining high standards of 
governance within the Company has been re-
emphasised this year with the implementation of 
recommendations set out in the updated UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The development of strong 
governance is a continuous process and I will be working 
closely with my Board colleagues this year to ensure that 
the Company’s governance standards and procedures 
are appropriate to meet the requirements of a FTSE 350 
constituent member. These requirements are set out 
further in the Chairman’s foreword to the statement on 
Corporate Governance set out on page 26 of the 
Annual Report & Accounts. 
Employees
Our employees are our most important asset and we 
continue to invest time and resources into developing 
strong management groups and committed staff teams. 
We encourage an entrepreneurial culture within our 
businesses so that our employees feel responsible for 
their own businesses while being able to draw on the 
resources of a larger group. I wish to thank all of our 
employees for their exceptional efforts in helping to 
deliver this year’s very strong financial performance. 
 
Outlook
The financial performance of the Group this year has 
benefited from strong trading in its principal markets. 
While trading remains robust, underlying organic 
growth is expected to trend towards our target “GDP 
plus” levels when measured against increasingly 
demanding comparatives.
With a resilient business model, a good geographic 
spread of activities and supported by a strong balance 
sheet, the Group is well placed to withstand further 
shocks to the global economy. With this background, a 
combination of consistent organic growth, together with 
a favourable environment for acquisitions, provide the 
Board with confidence that further progress will be made 
in the new financial year.

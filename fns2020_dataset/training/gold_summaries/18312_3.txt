Chairman’s statement
We celebrated our 30
th
 anniversary in 2015 and 
I am very proud that the Group has produced 
another excellent set of results. We continue to 
deliver as one of the strongest franchises across 
the Domino’s network worldwide and we are 
proud of our achievement as the number one 
pizza company in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
In the UK and ROI, our success in 2015 is rooted in revenue-driven 
profit growth based on continued investment in e-commerce initiatives 
and record levels of new store openings, underpinned by improving 
franchisee profitability. 
I am encouraged by the signs of progress we are seeing in Switzerland, 
where the mature store portfolio delivered improved profitability and 
where we continue to invest in new stores.
Towards the end of the year, we announced our intention to form a joint 
venture with Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Limited in order to acquire 
Joey’s Pizza, Germany’s largest pizza delivery chain, which will give us 
the opportunity to participate in a larger scale business in this market.
The Group’s business model continues to be highly cash generative 
and will allow us to resume share buy backs.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final dividend for 2015 of 11.75p (2014: 9.69p) 
per share, being a 21.3% increase on the final dividend for the prior 
year. Together with the interim dividend of 9.00p per share paid on 
4 September 2015, the total dividend for the year will be 20.75p per 
share, representing an increase of 18.6% on the dividend paid for the 
prior year (2014: 17.5p). The full year dividend is 1.7 times covered 
by underlying profits after tax (2014: 1.5 times). Subject to receiving 
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2016, 
the final dividend will be paid on 25 April 2016 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 11 March 2016. 
SUMMARY
STEPHEN HEMSLEY
CHAIRMAN Domino’s Pizza Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2015 05
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
201 5 HAS BEEN ANOTHER YEAR OF EXCELLENT PROGRESS. 
I CONTINUE TO BE DELIGHTED WITH 
THE MOMENTUM ACROSS THE BUSINESS.
In readiness for this event, Steve Barber joined the Board on 1 July 2015 
as a non-executive Director and as chairman-designate of the Audit 
Committee. He brings over 40 years’ experience in accountancy and 
finance to our Board, both from an audit and corporate perspective 
and also has strong general management experience.
In my report last year, I noted that we were seeking a new Chief 
Financial Officer. On 8 June 2015, Paul Doughty joined the Board and 
was appointed as our CFO. Paul has more than 20 years’ commercial 
finance experience including 10 years as CFO with Moneysupermarket.com 
Group. Unfortunately, this appointment did not work out as either we or 
Paul would have liked, and he subsequently resigned as a Director and 
left the Board on 31 December 2015. A selection process is currently 
underway as we continue to search for the best possible candidate.
Conclusion
In summing up, 2015 has been another year of excellent progress. 
I continue to be delighted with the momentum across the business and 
the entire team can be very proud of their efforts. Our focus is now on 
2016 and I look forward with optimism to our continued progress in 
the next phase of the Group’s development.

Non-executiveChairman
Ourpeople
Our business relies on a network of entrepreneurial, diligent and 
driven franchisees who serve our customers day and night. Every year, 
I continue to be amazed by their ability to improve our business, for 
our mutual benefit. This year is no exception and I would like to place 
on record my thanks for all of their hard work and commitment, which 
continues to be the lifeblood of the business. Their willingness to invest 
in new stores and to explore other means of growth gives the Board 
continued confidence for the future.
Our franchisees in turn depend on Domino’s employees, and I want 
to thank them for their ongoing commitment and contribution, helping 
to keep us as the number one pizza company in every neighbourhood 
in which we operate, despite ever-increasing competitive pressures. 
Boardchanges
During the year, we have focused on consolidating the significant 
changes we made to the Board in 2014, but also addressed 
two recruitment challenges.
Michael Shallow had served for slightly more than nine years as a 
non-executive Director when he retired from the Board on 31 July 2015. 
I would like to thank Michael for his stalwart contribution to the Board 
of Domino’s, most recently as our Senior Independent Director, 
and we wish him well for the future.

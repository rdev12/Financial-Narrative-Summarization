Syntopix Group plc Annual report and accounts 2006
Introduction
Over the last twelve months Syntopix has made signiﬁcant progress 
in the discovery and development of innovative drug candidates for 
the treatment of acne and staphylococcal skin infections, our principal 
areas of focus in the dermatology market. Syntopix, which was founded 
in 2003, has dedicated its resources to the discovery and development 
of therapeutic products against these indications and we believe the 
Group is well positioned to create new and much needed therapies.
The global market for our products is reasonably large with acne 
accounting for some 22% of skin disease, or approximately $3.3 billion 
in value. Acne has been largely regarded as a teenage condition but 
increasingly recognised problems of late-onset and persistent acne 
are expanding the potential market size. Superﬁcial Staphylococcus 
aureus infections account for some 5% of the market, with a value 
of approximately $0.75 billion.
During the period under review we have continued to successfully 
screen combinations of compounds from our library of approximately 
1,000 compounds and now have a pipeline of candidates that have shown 
synergistic actions against Propionibacterium acnes and/or S. aureus. 
To date, management of superﬁcial Staphylococcus aureus infections 
and prophylaxis of nasal carriage continues to rely heavily upon antibiotics 
with associated concerns about rising resistance rates. Our approach, 
which uses synergistic combinations of antimicrobial compounds, has 
the potential to mitigate the problem of drug resistance.
The Group has carried out consultancy and contract work for other 
pharmaceutical companies throughout the year. Although the revenue has 
been modest at £31,914 (2005: £61,156) the relationships formed with the 
companies for which we have carried out this work could be the basis for 
future partnerships or collaborations. Discussions have also taken place 
with several potential partners in other pharmaceutical companies who 
have interests in the dermatological area. 
Discovery and development
During the year we have made signiﬁcant scientiﬁc advances, culminating 
in the selection of three lead candidates from our portfolio to enter 
formulation and pre-clinical trials. It is intended that these will commence 
clinical trials in early 2007.
Our ﬁrst candidate, SYN-24-0017, is an anti-oxidant present in a wide variety 
of foods and cosmetics. It will enter pre-clinical development as a remedy 
for the prevention and treatment of S. aureus infections. 
Our second candidate is a synergistic combination of SYN-24-0017 with 
a metal salt that will be developed as a topical treatment for acne vulgaris. 
The third candidate, which will also be developed as a treatment for acne, 
will be a synergistic combination of SYN-24-0401 and SYN-24-0016 or 
SYN-24-0017 (previously SYN-24-0403) (or its salt). SYN-24-0401 is an 
anti-fungal ingredient in personal healthcare products. SYN-24-0016 is 
an oxidising agent present in a number of pharmaceutical preparations. 
The Board has decided to substitute SYN-24-0016 or SYN-24-0017 
for SYN-24-0403 due to stronger intellectual property protection over 
the combination of SYN-24-0401 and SYN-24-0403.
Chief Executive’s statement
The Group is well positioned to create new and   much needed therapies in dermatology
“ We are extremely pleased to have made signiﬁcant scientiﬁc advancements 
since the ﬂotation of Syntopix in March this year. We have selected three 
lead candidates from our portfolio to enter formulation and clinical studies 
in line with expectations and I am very excited about the quality of our 
development programme.”

Intellectual property
We have continued throughout the year to ﬁle for patents based on the 
growing pipeline of new synergistic combinations of compounds. At the 
year end we had seven submitted patents. 
Financials
The balance sheet was strengthened considerably in March 2006 with the ﬂotation 
on AIM. The placing at the time of the ﬂotation raised £3.3 million net of expenses 
through the issue of 2,259,887 ordinary shares at a placing price of 177p. 
T urnover in the period was £31,914 (2005: £61,156) and the net loss was £910,846 
(2005: net loss £99,660), equating to a loss per share of 21.6p (2005: loss per 
share of 3.7p). Net cash as at 31 July 2006 was £3,247,430 (2005: £645,423).
Staff levels have been increased during the ﬁnancial year, with the addition 
of an administrator, a part-time technician and a Chief Operating Ofﬁcer, 
and subsequent to the year end we appointed an additional Research Scientist. 
Overhead costs however remain as forecast, due in part to the move from 
our previous high cost premises at Leeds University to low cost purpose 
built ofﬁces and laboratories at the Institute of Pharmaceutical Innovation 
at University of Bradford. The Group qualiﬁes for repayable research and 
development tax credits amounting to £86,000 for the year in respect of 
its research activity.
Conclusion
We have continued to invest in the research and development of our drug 
candidates and this will increase as we enter the formulation and clinical 
stages of our product development. The current ﬁnancial year will be a pivotal 
year for Syntopix and we look forward with conﬁdence to the opportunities 
ahead both in terms of the development of our product portfolio and of 
our commercial relationships.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review
4 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Charles Dunstone, Chief Executive Officer
 
“ ”
For 20 years now we have 
developed our business with 
long-term shareholder value 
in mind. This is now more 
important than ever.
It seems hard to believe that it is a year 
since the last annual report. I note from 
my review last year that I flagged the 
“poor economic climate and inflationary 
pressures” as reasons for caution in my 
outlook statement. I was half-right: world 
economies have been at best, poor; at 
worst, terrible; but it is a reflection of how 
fast the macro environment can change 
and make fools of us all that we have 
been worrying for the last six months 
about the spectre of deflation rather  
than inflation.
Companies have to constantly adapt and 
change to survive. This is the difficult 
message I have had to give to 
shareholders this year. Our own major 
change this year – the deal with Best Buy 
which saw them become 50% owners  
of our retail business – was not generally 
well received, and did in part contribute 
to the share price decline. However,  
I am convinced it was absolutely the  
right thing to do and the right time to  
do it. Here’s why.
Carphone has thrived for 20 years now 
on offering customers simple, impartial 
advice over their choice of handset, 
network and tariff. Increasingly though, 
customers don’t need our advice for 
buying mobile phones: they have done it 
before and they understand how it works. 
So if we were to carry on selling just 
mobile phone contracts, we would risk 
opening the stores one day in two or 
three years’ time and finding that we just 
weren’t relevant to customers any more.
We believe our core skill is in making 
complex technologies simple for 
customers. As a result, we have been 
busy over the last two years – ever  
since I first mentioned it in the 2007 
annual report – developing our retail 
proposition to deliver the “Connected 
World” to customers. A range of laptops 
is now available across most of our 
stores, and we are now rolling out 
mid-sized stores to offer a much wider 
range of connected devices.
We could have continued to go it alone 
with this strategy, but during our work 
with Best Buy helping them re-engineer 
their US mobile retailing operations, we 
discovered how much the two businesses 
have in common, and in particular that  
we have a shared vision of the future of 
technology for customers. I absolutely 
believe that in partnership with Best Buy, 
we can deliver the connected world to 
customers much better and faster than 
we could on our own. 
Secondly, Best Buy is without doubt the 
leading consumer electronics retailer in 
the world. They have conquered their 
home market, where consumers are very 
demanding and the competition was 
strong. They have long eyed Europe as 
an attractive opportunity and see 
Carphone as a great vehicle through 
which to launch Big Box consumer 
electronics stores. It is a huge market 
and the existing customer experience 
can be indifferent. By joining together 
with them, shareholders in Carphone can 
access what is potentially an enormous 
new growth opportunity.
Finally, the years of investment in building 
up a valuable telecoms business had 
taken its toll on our balance sheet, and 
our levels of debt were uncomfortable 
given the gathering clouds of the 
financial crisis. The consideration from 
Best Buy enabled us to pay off the large 
majority of our underlying borrowings 
and we are now in a strong financial 
position where many others are 
struggling in this very tight credit market.
So in summary, we have brought in a 
peerless retailing partner to drive forward 
our strategy, given our shareholders 
access to a new growth opportunity, and 
achieved renewed financial strength. 
I feel that over the long term, these 
benefits more than outweigh the issue  
of near-term earnings dilution.  Directors’ Report –

Through organic growth and 
acquisitions, the Group has delivered  
a high rate of compound growth in 
revenues and profitability over the last  
10 years. From a business that used to 
be predominantly reliant on its UK retail 
business, we now have significant retail 
operations across continental Europe 
and a highly visible recurring revenue 
base from our UK residential telecoms 
operations, creating a much broader and 
better diversified business.
Growing and diversifying  
the business over the long term
▪ Growth: we remain focused 
on growing our businesses  
in strategically important 
areas. The opening of our  
first Best Buy Big Box stores 
in the UK, the continued 
expansion of our US interests 
through Best Buy Mobile,  
and further growth in our  
UK broadband base will be 
central to our plans.
▪ Cash: we have set ourselves 
ambitious targets for the year 
ahead to generate operating 
free cash flow* of over £150m, 
after all investment in the  
Big Box business.
▪ Operational efficiency: 
we have undertaken a 
reorganisation programme 
covering all aspects of our 
business. Our goal is to 
reduce our operating cost 
base within Best Buy Europe 
and TalkTalk Group by around 
£50m and £10m respectively, 
without compromising on the 
customer experience.
▪ Transparency: we are 
enhancing our financial 
disclosure and simplifying  
our KPI reporting to allow 
investors to compare our 
businesses more easily with 
peer group companies.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review – continued
Accessing the internet via  
mobile phone is still a relatively 
under used and limited activity. 
How will customer expectations 
drive innovation?
Q&A
Two of the innovative 
handsets that allow 
customers to access the 
internet, almost anywhere 
and at anytime.
Charles Dunstone, Chief Executive Officer
Our conversations with investors 
generally revolve around just a few  
key questions. These change over time 
as our strategy and the marketplace 
evolve, but currently these are the  
main discussions we are having.
Q
 How are you responding to the 
tough macro environment?
A While the economy has entered 
what is for most of us uncharted territory, 
I view it as much as an opportunity as  
a threat. I take the view that in buoyant 
markets, anyone can do well, and 
innovators are easily copied. When  
times are tougher, imaginative and 
well-financed businesses can put clear 
water between themselves and their 
competitors. So the business remains 
committed to its growth avenues – 
through the evolution of the existing  
retail proposition, the launch of Big Box 
consumer electronics stores, and the 
expansion of our US franchise.
At the same time, you have to remember 
that customers have two choices: firstly, 
whether to spend their money or not;  
and secondly, who to spend it with. As  
a retailer, you have to give customers  
a reason to part with their money, and  
by offering outstanding value, exclusive 
products and a unique new customer 
proposition, we are growing our market 
share. There is a cost to us in margin,  
but as markets recover, our increased 
market power will help us to rebuild  
that over time. 
In the broadband business, TalkTalk  
is the clear value proposition in the 
marketplace, focusing on simple, 
transparent tariffs where customers  
only pay for what they want. There are 
signs of building momentum within this 
business thanks to its outstanding value 
and improving service and innovation.
Finally, all businesses need to protect 
their bottom line. We have had to make 
some difficult decisions as part of our 
cost reduction exercise, and our goal  
has been to offset further deterioration  
in gross margin through a matching 
reduction in operating costs. 
Q
 How are you going to improve 
cash generation? 
A We have been disappointed by our 
cash generation over the last couple  
of years. There have been three main 
reasons: an overspend on capex and 
subscriber acquisition costs a couple of 
years ago; working capital outflow within 
the retail business; and foreign currency 
exposure in a weak Sterling environment.
We are now past the peak of investment 
in our broadband network: capex has 
fallen sharply this year and will fall a little 
further next year, to a sustainably low 
run-rate. At the same time, broadband 
gross adds and churn are lower than  
they have been historically, reducing the 
overall cost of recruiting new customers.
On working capital, the way we earn 
commission from networks automatically 
creates a lag between payment to 
handset suppliers and receipts from 
network operators. This is well 
understood by investors. However,  
our terms vary between networks,  
with the working capital of certain 
partners being greater than others;  
so our business mix over the last year 
accentuated this trend. We expect a 
more normal mix going forward, resulting 
in a continued working capital outflow 
but at a much reduced rate.
Finally, we have closed out our Swiss 
Franc hedging position, leaving our 
currency exposure now just to the Euro, 
where we hedge our Euro-denominated 
trading assets. This should result in 
much reduced volatility in our net  
debt figures.  Directors’ Report – 
Business Review

Q
 Your competitors and suppliers are 
generally larger and better capitalised 
than you: isn’t this a long-term 
disadvantage?
A It is true that we are a relatively 
small business in industries generally 
populated with major multinationals, but 
this has been the case throughout the 
Group’s life. We have thrived on being 
nimble, allowing us to minimise the time 
between spotting opportunities and 
mobilising to address them. Our ability  
to come from nowhere to become the 
number three in the UK residential 
telecoms market is clear evidence of this.
We have also stayed focused and  
stayed close to the customer. In both  
our businesses, the first thing we ask 
ourselves is “What can we do better for 
the customer?”. This may not result in 
immediate profit maximisation, but it 
does create a sustainable business  
that makes fair margins over time and 
creates barriers to entry through scale 
and low pricing.
Q
 How does fibre deployment affect 
your broadband business? 
A The regulator OFCOM has recently 
announced that it plans not to impose 
any wholesale price regime on BT for  
the resale of fibre-based connectivity  
to UK homes. Fibre networks facilitate 
much higher broadband speeds than 
existing copper networks. In theory,  
this could allow BT to set a very high 
wholesale price for fibre, thus preventing 
users of its network (such as us and Sky) 
from reselling fibre profitably and giving 
BT the opportunity to gain significant 
market share through marketing its own 
superfast broadband product without 
meaningful competition.
There are several flaws to this theoretical 
argument. Firstly, BT has a low retail 
market share for an incumbent. This 
means that it will be difficult to get a 
good return on an expensive fibre 
deployment on a “go it alone” strategy 
because they don’t have the density  
of customers; they would need wholesale 
customers to help defray the capital 
outlay. We expect to work closely with 
Openreach, the infrastructure arm of  
BT, on the development of wholesale 
products.
Secondly, demand for “raw” speed, while 
growing, is still relatively low. BT’s ability 
to take significant retail market share 
simply through a higher speed product, 
with no compelling exclusive content, is 
likely to be limited. At the same time,  
the achievement of higher speeds 
through the enhancement of the copper 
infrastructure, and the rapid development 
of compression technologies which 
would allow much more effective data 
transmission at prevailing broadband 
speeds, could dampen demand for 
fibre-based products.
Finally, we all look to Virgin Media, the 
cable-based broadband operator with its 
own network, to see how their customers 
are responding to their new, higher  
speed products. If demand for 50Mbps 
services picks up rapidly, then rapid fibre 
deployment with fair wholesale prices  
will be the natural market response.
Q
 Won’t increasing customer usage 
erode margins in the broadband 
business? 
A Customer usage increased, on 
average, 60% year-on-year this year, 
which was in line with our expectations. 
We are designing our network for 
continued strong traffic growth as 
customers find more to do on the internet 
and will, over time, value reliability and 
consistency from their ISP as much as 
out-and-out speed.
Over the last two years we have been 
increasing backhaul capacity into our 
exchanges by up to ten times. The scale 
economies of this process are very 
healthy, with the operating cost to us  
of running a gigabit circuit only being 
twice that of running a 100 megabit 
circuit. This means that our capacity-
related operating costs are effectively 
capped for the medium term.
I believe that, as customers use 
broadband for an ever-wider array of 
services, metering will be an inevitable 
next step in the marketplace, with 
customers learning to pay for what they 
use rather than having flat rate tariffs.
Q
 Don’t you need content as part 
of your broadband offer?
A The way customers are accessing 
content is rapidly fragmenting. Although 
Pay TV is a significant part of the market, 
an increasing amount of content is freely 
available on the internet and this is only 
going to grow over time. I don’t think that 
telecoms businesses make good media 
businesses, so we will continue to focus 
on providing the best value and most 
reliable network allowing our customers 
to access content of their choice on the 
web. How could we justify charging a 
premium for content that customers 
either don’t want or could find 
somewhere else for free anyway?
Q
 How do you compete with the 
mobile networks’ direct distribution 
strategies?
A The mobile networks have long been 
competitors on the high street as well  
as partners, and we have thrived within  
this market dynamic for many years. 
Customers are not all the same: for every 
customer who is happy to stay with the 
same network and deal with them direct, 
there is another who wants to shop 
around, try a wider range of handsets 
and get impartial advice. That’s why 
Carphone Warehouse exists.
Q
 Isn’t consumer electronics retailing 
an unattractive sector?
A Not at all. It is estimated to be a 
£30bn market in the UK alone. We  
all love the technology we have in our 
homes – music, home theatre, gaming, 
even coffee machines and fridge freezers 
– but generally we don’t love going to 
buy it or having to make it work. Our 
analysis of the UK market suggests  
that competition is focused around  
price rather than service, and while  
most technology products aren’t 
commoditised, they are sold that way.
Our goal is to open large stores with  
deep ranges, well-informed staff, and  
a high level of in-store interactivity  
and after-sales service. We want it to  
be a pleasure to come shopping for 
technology, not a chore. The economics 
of running 30,000 square foot stores  
are much more attractive than stores  
half the size, which our competitors 
typically run, and the current property 
market is providing us with some 
compelling opportunities. 8 The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Directors’ Report – Business Review
Chief Executive Officer’s Review – continued
In November last year we announced plans 
to conduct a structural review of the Group. 
This process was a natural consequence of 
the Best Buy deal and reflected discussions 
with investors through the summer over  
our future plans for the Group.
Key considerations for the structural review
The review covered a broad range of 
considerations, the most significant  
of which are set out below, with our 
summarised views on each issue. In 
conclusion, the Board decided that a 
demerger was the right course to pursue, 
allowing the two businesses clearer 
autonomy and investors clearer choices. 
We expect to achieve the demerger  
by July 2010, at which time we expect 
TalkTalk Group and our investment  
in Best Buy Europe to be listed as 
independent publicly-quoted companies. 
We are confident this will make it easier 
Consideration Conclusion
Do the two businesses complement each other 
commercially?
Yes, but not materially. The Carphone Warehouse stores are still  
an important distribution channel for TalkTalk broadband sales but 
now account for only 20% of gross sales, down from around 50%  
at launch. Most new customers are now switchers rather than new 
to broadband and use other channels to switch providers. 
Commercial terms are already at arm’s length. 
Does one business have a financial reliance  
on the other?
Not any more. The growth of the broadband business was 
historically financed by the cash generated by the retail business. 
Both businesses are now expected to be self-financing.
Do the businesses have different investor profiles? Yes, we believe so. The TalkTalk Group is becoming a highly cash 
generative business with a utility-like profile; Best Buy Europe is 
entering a growth and investment phase with a major market 
opportunity in front of it.
Are the businesses easily separable from a 
management and administrative viewpoint?
Yes. We pushed the majority of shared resource down into the 
divisions in May last year, and have gone through a further 
restructuring process early in 2009.
Are there any material financing implications of  
a demerger?
Yes. The demerger will require us to put in place separate facilities 
for the two businesses. However, we are making good progress on 
this and do not see it as an obstacle to demerger.
for shareholders to assess more clearly 
the value of the Group’s businesses and 
that each business will continue to thrive 
with its distinct management strategy, 
investment characteristics, financing 
arrangements and potential.
Meanwhile, the two businesses are 
already effectively run as separate 
entities, with a very limited shared central 
function. This was a process begun 
ahead of the Best Buy transaction last 
year, and taken further in early 2009 with 
the devolution of most remaining central 
functions down to the divisional level. 
The Group functions that remain are the 
Board, Group Finance, Treasury, Investor 
Relations and Company Secretariat.
We now see the Group as a holding 
company managing four assets – our 
100% holding in TalkTalk Group, the  
50% stake in Best Buy Europe, the 
48.5% stake in Virgin Mobile France,  
and the Group’s freehold properties.  
The key elements of each and our 
strategy for them are set out here. Directors’ Report –

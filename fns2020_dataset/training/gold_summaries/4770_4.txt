Business overview
Crematoria revenues arise from
cremation services and the sale of
memorials and burial plots at the
Group’s crematoria and cemeteries.
We are the largest single operator of
crematoria in Britain. We operate 30
crematoria in England and Scotland
and carried out 42,700 cremations 
in 2009 representing 8 per cent of
estimated total deaths in Britain.
Pre-arranged funeral plans income
represents amounts covering the 
costs of marketing and administering
the sales of plans. Pre-arranged
funeral plans allow people to plan 
and pay for their funeral in advance.
The Group has a strong market
presence in the provision of pre-
arranged funeral plans with 216,000
unfulfilled funeral plans as at 25
December 2009. Dignity works with a

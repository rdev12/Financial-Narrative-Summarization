The Innovation Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Momentum continues
Chief Executive’s review
Innovation Group is clearly on a growth path 
under a stable and strong management team. 
Our task now is to build on these foundations 
and achieve our top three market share 
ambition in each operating region and grow 
our newly separated software business.
The results in this report come from very good 
operational and sales momentum. This is in turn 
based on the stability and quality of our regional 
management. I believe that we now have the 
best team of senior management we have had 
in the business since I first became involved, all 
aligned towards achieving our strategic goals. 
This clarity of purpose is already resulting in 
a consistency of results and a depth of 
engagement with the market that is building a 
strong pipeline of new and extended business.
This engagement is vital as the market is 
changing rapidly with more use of mobile 
technologies, data analysis and customer 
self-service. We are at the forefront of these 
changes, both through our own R&D with our 
Insurer software business, and also by working 
with partners such as Wunelli and Symbility. 
As well as technology leadership, we also aim 
to lead the market through innovative business 
models such as fixed price claims, backed up by 
partnerships with major reinsurers.
This year also saw us add the ability to manage 
both wet and dry perils in our property claims 
business in the UK. We will expand this capability 
into our other operating regions over the 
coming year, giving insurers access to a 
complete range of motor and property policy 
and claims services.
We are now well placed to grow strongly and 
consistently in all areas of our business.
With clear opportunities in both divisions of our 
business and with a strong pipeline in all regions, 
I look forward to the year ahead with confidence.

 Chief Executive’s Review of Business
H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 8
Chief Executive’s Review 
of the Business
2007 was a record year for H&T on a number of metrics. Our business
model has proved scaleable, with new stores and continued
improvements to our existing businesses driving strong growth.
During 2007, H&T has set a number of new records. Turnover
and gross profit of all business segments increased by double
digit figures. Pawnbroking activities, comprising Pawn Service
Charge and Disposition, represented 87 per cent. (2006: 88
per cent.) of total 2007 gross profit and grew 17 per cent.
year on year. Gold asset-backed lending continues to see
strong demand both in existing and new markets. At the same
time financial services activities, comprising Cheque Cashing
and Other Financial Services, represented 13 per cent. (2006:
12 per cent.) of total 2007 gross profit and grew 29 per cent.
year on year. The transition in 2006 of the back office functions
of Cheque Cashing and Pay Day Advance in-house gave us
the opportunity to market these products more effectively
during 2007.
H&T remains the UK’s leading pawnbroker by size of pledge
book and had 89 outlets across the UK at the end of 2007.
The estate increased by the record number of 12 stores
(2006: nine) during 2007. Of these, five were greenfield
stores and seven were acquired branches. The acquisitions
located in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and the South Coast 
will give us access to new markets where pawnbroking has
historically been strong. We will be looking at expanding in
those regions through a regional hub system and take full
advantage of market potential.
The continuing growth we derive from our established and
greenfield stores combined with profit-enhancing acquisitions
has led to record profits. Operating profit before exceptional
items reached £10.0 million in 2007 (2006: £8.0 million), 
a 24.1 per cent. increase on 2006.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Pawn Service Charge 
H&T has been the largest pawnbroker in the UK based 
on the size of the pledge book for many years and as at 
31 December 2007 had a pledge book of £27.8 million
(2006: £25.2 million).

Pawn Service Charge 
Pawn Service Charge (PSC) represents all income earned up to
the completion of a pledge. The main items are interest and net
profit from auctions after returning any surplus to the customer.
In 2007 PSC represented 61.9% of gross profit (2006: 65.6%)
and 71.2% of total pawnbroking gross profit (2006: 74.6%).
The average loan in 2007 was £111 (2006: £105), 
the yield on the pledgebook was 66.2% (2006:62.5%).

Chief Executive’s Review of Business
H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 9
As indicated in the “develop and establish new products and
services” section of this review, the growth in the pledge book
was impacted by the full roll out of gold purchasing. The
increase in pledge book combined with an improved yield
translated to an 11.9 per cent. increase in Pawn Service
Charge. Maintaining this market leading position remains 
a priority for the Group.
Disposition
The sale of forfeited items to the general public (“Retail”) is 
the most important element of Disposition, generating higher
margins when compared with items that are sold in auction 
or scrap. Although the general trading environment on the
high street deteriorated during the last quarter of 2007, I am
delighted to report that trading remained good for H&T and
we achieved turnover growth of 18.8 per cent. year on year
(11.7 per cent. LFL) while increasing Retail gross profit margin
to 49.4 per cent. (2006: 44.2 per cent.). This has resulted 
in gross profit increasing by 32.6 per cent. between 2006 
and 2007. This very strong performance is a result of the
continued investment in training, marketing and a wider
product range.
In 2007, Scrap gross profit reached £1.5 million (2006: 
£1.1 million). This £0.4 million increase is as a result of the
increase in the price of gold (£0.2 million) and higher Scrap
volumes (£0.2 million). 
OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Cheque Cashing and Pay Day Advance
In January 2006, H&T brought in-house the back office 
for underwriting the in-store Cheque Cashing and Pay Day
Advance businesses, enabling the Group to manage both
products internally saving the fees previously paid to a third
party. It has also allowed us to apply our own expertise in
managing this product without the restrictions imposed by 
a third party. 
11.9%
growth in PSC gross profit
Disposition
Disposition refers to the entire process to dispose of forfeited
pledges. The key routes are retail through the stores and scrap.
Given the higher margin our preferred route is via retail.
Retail
The Company’s retail proposition is primarily gold and jewellery
and almost all (94.7%) retail sales are items sourced from
pawnbroking or purchasing operations. We complement our 
retail offering with a small amount of new jewellery.
We have incorporated the retail offering into all but one H&T
branded outlet and all new H&T Pawnbrokers now have a
dedicated retail window, most including an internal display with 
a separate retail counter.
Profitability in this area is driven by sound valuation at the point of
purchase or lending and also by the management of appropriate
stock. Our preference is to retail the stock that is produced from
forfeited loans purchased over the counter to maximise our returns.
The advantage of H&T over other retailers is that the cost of our
supply is relatively low and we can scrap surplus items and still
make a profit. This offsets the fact that we have little choice over
our supply and therefore must retail what we have available to sell.
As almost all items retailed come from pawnbroking or purchasing
operations we are able to offer an excellent value proposition that
is extremely hard to beat on the high street.
Scrap
Items that are damaged beyond repair, slow moving or surplus 
to retail requirement, may be smelted and sold at the current 
gold spot price less a small commission. The point of sale system
reduces the amount lent or paid on items identified as scrap or 
low quality so we are still able to make a reasonable margin on 
scrap sales.

H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 10
Our experience in 2007 on Cheque Cashing appears to 
go against the market trend. Whilst our competitors reported
difficult times and reducing turnover, H&T turnover grew by 
7 per cent. on a like-for-like basis. Although this is encouraging
we acknowledge that this is in the face of a changing market.
Pay Day Advance continues to provide excellent growth. 
We did however experience a small increase in the percentage
of bad debt which was expected in the context of a rapidly
expanding loan book.
In 2007, gross revenues from Cheque Cashing increased 
to £2.2 million (2006: £1.9 million) and Pay Day Advance
increased to £2.9 million (2006: £1.8 million). 
The revenues net of bad debt from Cheque Cashing and Pay
Day Advance increased to £3.4 million (2006: £2.6 million).
KwikLoan
The KwikLoan product has continued to develop as a medium
term alternative for our Pay Day Advance customers. As in
2006 our focus has been on the development of Pay Day
Advance, with KwikLoan growing alongside it. We believe
there is further opportunity to grow the KwikLoan product
through the development of the loan term, loan value and 
the customer base.
The KwikLoan loan book increased from £0.4 million to 
£0.5 million in the 12 months to 31 December 2007.
KwikLoan gross profit increased by 45.5 per cent. during 
the same period.
Point of sale development
In 2006 we commenced the development of our new point of
sale system which will unify the current store and head office
systems which have developed over a number of years with
one, purpose built, application to support all current business
activities.
The use of new technology will result in some improvement in
operational efficiency, but more importantly, will simplify store
Other Financial Services
Cheque Cashing
Cheque Cashing is the provision of cash in exchange for a
cheque payable to our customer for a commission fee based
on the face value of the cheque. The average cheque value
in 2007 was £355 (2006: £364), with the average fee
being £23 (6.4%).
The cheques are normally in respect of wages and the
service is used as a quick and convenient alternative to a
bank overdraft. The product simply serves a short term need
for cash.
In order to manage the risk associated with cashing 
third party cheques we have access to a variety of
information, from credit reference agencies to internet
directories, as well as our own point of sale system and
database of customer activity. 
Pay Day Advance
Pay Day Advance is a simple form of credit, where the
advance is repaid by cheques presented by the customer at
the point of the loan. The contract allows for 30 days credit
and the average advance in 2007 was £452 (2006: £435),
with a typical charge of 13% (2006: 13%) per 30 days.
The customer will agree a date for the cheque to be banked,
then either:
• Pay additional fees for another 30 days (Extend); or
• Pay the face value of the cheque in cash (Settle); or
• Allow the cheque to be deposited into our account.

operations to enable us to achieve the full potential of the
existing product range and implement new products more easily.
Although the development of our new point of sale system is
taking longer than originally anticipated, the project remains
within budget and is expected to be fully rolled out into all
stores by late summer. Since the beginning of the project we
have incurred capital expenditure of £1.3 million and the total
cost including implementation is expected to be in the region
of £1.8 million.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY
Our growth strategy is based on two main streams. Each of
them is progressing in line or ahead of the Board’s expectations.
1. Expand geographical footprint
The significant fragmentation in the UK pawnbroking market 
will continue to provide the Group with acquisition opportunities.
In addition, there remains substantial opportunity for organic
growth with a significant number of towns with an appropriate
population size and demographic mix to support a greenfield
store.
H&T’s strategy at IPO was to develop 30 units between 2006
and 2008, both through greenfield stores and acquisitions,
using current resources whilst maintaining cash flow and
earnings growth at an appropriate level. During 2007, 
we added 12 outlets (2006: nine) to the store portfolio - five
greenfield and seven acquisitions. Two of the acquisitions
opened up new regions to us, in Yorkshire and the South
coast, and can now be used as a regional hub to further
develop these key markets. We would expect to grow the
store footprint by a similar number during 2008 and exceed
the original 30 unit target.
Initially, new pawnbroking units tend to be loss-making. As a
consequence, expanding the store base can suppress short term
earnings growth but provides significant medium term benefit.
KwikLoan
H&T identified the need for an unsecured loan product that had a
longer duration than a Pay Day Advance. The principle is that
some customers are unable to repay the lump sum of a Pay Day
Advance after 30 days and prefer a smaller regular repayment.
The underwriting criteria are essentially the same as for a Pay
Day Advance although we do more verification to ensure that the
customer is likely to be a reasonable risk for the duration of the
loan.
KwikLoan is currently offered over a 12 month period for loan
values up to £750, although the average is closer to £600. We
earn approximately £300 gross interest on a £500 KwikLoan
over a 12 month period.
Prepaid Debit Card
H&T offer a prepaid debit card on behalf of Advanced Payment
Solutions (APS) under the CashPlus brand. The card is an instant
issue Cirrus card (which allows ATM access immediately), with a
personalised MasterCard issued to the customer in the post within
10 days. For further product information refer to
www.apsgroup.com.
H&T were the first national chain to provide the CashPlus card in
the UK and we remain one of the largest customers of APS.
The card is the ideal vehicle to provide funds to our customers in
a more convenient form than cash. The card is the natural
extension to each of our cash based products, with the store staff
cross selling the benefit as part of our pawnbroking and cheque
cashing transactions. We expect the card to enhance our
relationship with customers, increasing retention and loyalty as
they will use our outlets to load additional funds on to the card.
The customers value the status of having a MasterCard and the
ability to use the card online, with over half the transactions on
the card being for internet purchases.

The Group is actively pursuing acquisitions to accelerate the
consolidation of the industry. During the year the Group issued
3.6m shares to raise additional capital of £7m, of which
£3.4m remained at the year end. This new capital and the
headroom available on existing borrowing facilities provide
the Group with the resources to complete a number of further
transactions. The H&T Board will make acquisitions selectively,
appraising each opportunity fully before proceeding with a
transaction. Consequently, the timing and nature of these
transactions depends on the availability of appropriate
opportunities.
Our greenfield stores are performing well and are on average
exceeding our expectations in terms of pledge book growth.
Whilst encouraging, we note that given the maturity of these
stores they will not have a significant impact on revenues in
the immediate term. These stores will nevertheless deliver a
greater contribution to group profitability over the next few
years. 
2. Develop and establish new products and services
During 2007 we introduced the purchase of gold and
jewellery into all of our stores. This minimises the time required
to access the asset for disposition and also enables simpler
communication with the customer. Whilst this has the effect of
reducing the pledge book as customers who would previously
pledge now sell, it allows a more efficient use of capital as
those goods are held for only 30 days, rather than up to eight
months for a pledge.
The strategy in 2008 is to further develop gold purchasing
and to expand the portfolio of unsecured products, using 
the Pay Day Advance and KwikLoan models to their best
advantage. All of these products provide customers with 
a simple and accessible route to cash, a service that is
invaluable, especially in the current credit climate. We believe
that through cautious development we can expand our
customer base, whilst maintaining an acceptable risk profile. 
The prepaid card continues to attract new customers to the
stores although the general market awareness has taken
longer to develop than anticipated. 
REVIEW OF THE PAWNBROKING MARKET
Competition
The competitive environment has not changed substantially 
in the last year.
The pawnbroking industry remains very fragmented. Although
there are no official statistics, the National Pawnbrokers
Association estimates that there are around one thousand
pawnbroking locations in the UK.
In this environment it is critical to maintain the high levels 
of customer service in store and by doing so we will continue
to be the first choice for our customers.
Regulation
There have been no changes to regulation that will have 
an impact on the products and services we offer.
Current Trading and Outlook
The increasing awareness of the pawnbroking industry 
will undoubtedly provide opportunities in the coming year. 
I believe that the current portfolio of pawnbroking and other
financial services products will enable H&T to capitalise on
those opportunities.
Against wider perception, the general economic climate is 
not necessarily a driver for our business – we do not and have
not seen the pawnbroking industry as cyclical. Our success 
has been based on the fundamentals of a well run business,
with the focus on the customer and an understanding of the
opportunities to grow within a fragmented market. We remain
confident that we can achieve further success.
Finally I would like to recognise the hard work and commitment
of our staff year after year and give them full credit for our 2007
business achievements. Thank you all.

Development Highlights
iPads
The introduction of iPads, in conjunction with the development of 
bespoke software, to all our sales people has undoubtedly been 
beneficial in further improving their working practices and time 
management and ultimately, provides an enhanced service to our 
customers. 
The iPads provide our sales people with improved visibility of 
real time customer data, the ability to access stock files to place 
orders and give an immediate flow of information on customer 
visits to our sales managers. An additional benefit is that our 
businessesâ€™ extensive marketing literature and display information 
can be contained within the iPad for efficient demonstration to 
our customers.
Investment in infrastructure
We have agreed to acquire, subject to planning permission, 
land adjacent to the existing distribution centre in Coleshill in 
order to increase the size of the centre from 159,500 square 
feet to 283,800 square feet. This will provide the capacity to 
increase our central stock holding in certain product sectors 
to satisfy the demand from our regional distribution centres 
and manage our future working capital investment on  
a more efficient basis. The existing and proposed 
elevations are shown below and it is anticipated that  
the development will be complete by late Summer 2013.

 06 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 www.angloasianmining.com
During the course of 2011 we continued to 
focus on the development of our flagship 
Gedabek mine. Our first aim was to realise 
our internal management target of circa 
60,000 ounces of gold for the year. Our 
second aim was to continue exploring 
the greater Gedabek area to re-classify 
the mineral resource and ore reserves 
categories, and our third aim was to consider 
future mineral processing options such as 
agitation leaching to optimise gold recovery 
at the mine. 
Additionally, in line with our strategy to 
establish other mining operations within 
Azerbaijan, we conducted exploration work 
at our other two Contract Areas, Gosha, 
which is located 50 km away from Gedabek, 
and Ordubad, which is located in the 
autonomous Nakhchivan Republic of Azerbaijan. 
Mining operations
Gedabek
Gedabek is an open pit heap leach gold/
copper/silver mining operation located on a 
300 sq km Contract Area in western Azerbaijan 
across the Tethyan Tectonic Belt, one of 
the world’s significant copper and gold 
bearing areas. 
We were pleased to announce that for FY 2011 
we produced 57,068 ounces of gold with an 
average cash operating cost of US$448 per 
ounce. With regards to gold and silver sales 
for the year, we sold 49,304 ounces of gold 
at an average of US$1,573 per ounce for the 
year and 34,593 ounces of silver at an 
average of US$35 per ounce. 
Table 1 highlights the quarter-on-quarter 
gold production at Gedabek over the past 
year with average gold sale price achieved. 
In terms of processing, during 2011 the 
volume of dry ore being transferred onto the 
leach pad totalled 842,751 tonnes with an 
average gold content of 3.29 g/t (2010: 821,176 
tonnes of dry ore with an average gold content 
of 4.33 g/t). Table 2 summarises levels of dry 
ore that have been transferred to the leach 
pad on a quarterly basis from 1 January 2011 
to 31 December 2011.
The reduced grade in 2011 was a result of 
treating transitional ore and was in line with 
our mine plan. A change in the physical 
characteristics of the ore, whereby a 
significant change in density and structure 
associated more with the transitional ore zone, 
affected the leaching rate and in turn the gold 
recovery and production. Channelling also 
occurred during the second half of the year in 
one of the cells as a result of the harsh winter, 
which affected leaching efficiencies. 
Due to this, we implemented an initiative in 
Q3 2011 to accelerate waste removal to open 
“ In May 2012, following a pre-feasibility study 
carried out by consultants, Arcadis Chile, the 
Company announced that it intends to construct 
an agitation leaching plant at Gedabek to further 
improve gold recoveries.”

up areas of oxide ore which has leaching 
characteristics more suitable to the heap 
leach process. Additionally, we crushed the 
ore more finely to make it more accessible 
to cyanide leaching.
As previously stated, Gedabek is currently 
an open pit heap leach operation. To ensure 
its long-term success as a leading gold/
copper/silver mine in the Caucasian region 
we are continually looking at ways to 
improve operational efficiencies and 
production. Accordingly, in May 2012, 
following a pre-feasibility study carried out 
by consultants, Arcadis Chile, the Company 
announced that it intends to construct an 
agitation leaching plant at Gedabek. The 
plant will have the capacity to treat 100 tph 
of ore and has an expected capital cost of 
US$52 million, including construction of the 
tailings dam and all related infrastructure. 
The Company is now in the process of 
seeking approval from the Government of 
Azerbaijan for construction of this new plant.
For the recovery of copper concentrate 
at Gedabek we use a SART process, which 
facilitates the recovery of the copper 
dissolved in the leaching solution. The 
copper is recovered in the form of a 
precipitated copper sulphide concentrate 
by-product, which also contains silver with 
commercial value. Recovery of copper and 
silver from solution is in the region of 90% 
and 96% respectively. The SART process has 
the added economic benefit that substantial 
amounts of cyanide are recovered from the 
leach solutions.
Using this process, for the year 31 December 
2011 we produced 611 tonnes of copper, 
134,240 ounces of silver and 200 ounces of 
gold, which exceeded our internal target of 
525 tonnes of copper for the year. A full 
quarterly breakdown of copper concentrate 
production can be reviewed in table 3.
We expect copper production in FY 2012 to total 
in the region of 833 tonnes of dry concentrate 
containing 500 tonnes of copper, 102,000 
ounces of silver and 134 ounces of gold.
Exploration
Gedabek
During the period, exploration remained 
an important part of our focus at Gedabek 
to increase the resource base, which at 
the beginning of the year stood at 791,000 
ounces of gold, 49,300 tonnes of copper and 
7,597,000 ounces of silver for all categories, 
and in turn increase the life of mine at Gedabek, 
which currently stands at approximately 
323,000 ounces of gold over a six year period. 
During the course of 2010/2011 we 
undertook an advanced exploration 
programme comprising of a two phase 
drilling programme. Phase 1 drilling, which 
was completed February 2011, comprised 60 
holes concentrated within the boundaries of 
the existing pit at Gedabek, totalling 5,452 
metres across a 90,000 square metre area 
with 4,626 samples prepared and assayed. 
Best intersections from the Phase 1 drilling 
programme at Gedabek included: 
 > SGSDD02 – 19m at 3.61 g/t Au, 10.52 g/t 
Ag and 0.18% Cu
 > SGSDD16 – 17.3m at 11.57 g/t Au, 46.52

The second objective of the 2010 – 2011 
exploration programme was to look at the 
mineral resources around the current 
economic open pit limit with a view to its 
possible future expansion. This was achieved 
by the Phase 2 exploration drilling campaign 
that consisted of 56 drill holes with 9,058.48 
metres drilled and 4,080 samples prepared 
and assayed.
The results for Phase 1 and 2 drilling 
programmes demonstrated consistent gold, 
silver and copper grades and continuity of 
mineralisation at Gedabek. Importantly, it 
also increased the geological knowledge and 
confidence in the quantity and quality of the 
mineral resources and ore reserves within 
the current economic open pit limit at 
Gedabek, and also enabled us to gain a 
better understanding of the metallurgy of 
the ore body to help assess future mineral 
processing options such as agitation 
leaching. As previously mentioned in this 
report, agitation leaching could potentially 
enable an increase in Gedabek’s mine life 
and improve its economic fundamentals.

Exploration continued
Gedabek continued
The Gedabek mineral deposit has the style 
of mineralisation typical of porphyry gold 
deposits (Robert, Poulsen and Dube, 1997), 
which is confirmed by the extensive analysis, 
interpretation and processing of the previous 
and recent sources of geological and chemical 
information. This is also supported by the 
geological and structural geology cross 
sections, which show that the spatial 
distribution of the gold, copper and silver 
mineralisation is located under, or immediate 
to, the geological contact between the 
andesitic and dacitic lavas and volcaniclastic 
tuffs and the dacitic quartz porphyry.
The updated mineral resources estimation 
was completed by mining consultants, CAE 
Mining, taking into account surface and open 
pit structural geology mapping and the 
information from the 2010-2011 exploration 
drilling campaigns, which together with 
earlier campaigns totalled 34,936 metres 
of drilling at Gedabek. 
As a result, in April 2012 we were delighted 
to be able to announce a 50%* increase in 
the JORC-compliant gold resource at Gedabek 
to 37,111,577 tonnes at 0.884 g/t of gold for 
1,054,382 ounces; 0.220% copper for 81,765 
tonnes; and 7.215 g/t of silver for 8,608,551 
ounces in the Measured and Indicated 
classifications at a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t 
of gold. Including the Inferred category, the 
total JORC mineral resource is now 
48,138,979 tonnes at 0.825 g/t gold for 
1,276,422 ounces of gold (a 61% increase); 
0.197 % copper for 94,890 tonnes (a 93% 
increase); and 6.66 g/t silver for 10,305,653 
ounces (a 36% increase) at a cut-off grade 
of 0.3 g/t of gold. 
The updated Measured, Indicated and Inferred 
mineral resources of both the oxide and 
sulphide mineralisation based on a cut-off 
grade of 0.3 g/t of gold is described in table 4. 
In Q1 2012, we commenced a further 24,567 
metre drilling programme with the aim of 
increasing the mineral resources of the 
Gedabek deposit and completing a JORC 
compliant ore reserves estimate in Q2 2012.
Gosha
The 300 sq km Gosha Contract Area is 
located in western Azerbaijan, 50 km 
north-west of Gedabek and contains three 
prospects: Gosha, Itkirlan and Munduglu. 
Following the Government of Azerbaijan’s 
approval of the Development and Production 
Programme, it is our intention to develop a 
small, profitable, high grade underground 
gold mine at Gosha. 
An exploration programme was undertaken 
at Gosha in 2010, which included 3,000 
metres of drilling and 300 metres of adit 
and sample work. Gosha has more than 6 km 
of exploration adits from the Soviet era and 
this programme highlighted that one of its 
Chief Executive’s review continued
Improving gold recoveries
A pre-feasibility study was completed in 
January 2012 aimed at looking at ways to 
improve gold recoveries at Gedabek. The 
study suggests that the current conventional 
heap leach process, which results in gold 
recoveries of circa 70% with leaching cycles 
extending up to a year, could be improved 
with an agitation leaching plant. This would 
see the production of gold with recovery 
rates for oxide and sulphide materials rising 
to 85% and 69% respectively. The plant, with 
an estimated capex of US$52 million, would 
be designed to treat 100 tonnes of ore per 
hour and is planned to be commissioned 
during H2 2013.

mineralisation zones, designated during 
Soviet times as ‘Zone 13’, has the potential 
to become a small narrow vein gold mining 
operation. In addition to this zone, there are 
several other vein type mineralisation zones. 
At present no JORC compliant information 
on Gosha’s resource is available. 
Having assessed the results of our exploration 
programme, in February 2011 we submitted 
a Notice of Discovery at Gosha to the 
Government of Azerbaijan, and later in 
November 2011 we submitted a Development 
and Production Programme in accordance 
with our PSA which was subsequently approved 
in April 2012. An update on our progress and 
summary of the proposed work programme 
at Gosha will be published in due course. 
Ordubad
Our 462 sq km Ordubad Contract Area 
is located in the Nakhchivan region of 
Azerbaijan and contains numerous targets 
including Shakardara, Piyazbashi, Misdag, 
Agyurt, Shalala and Diakchay, which are all 
located within a 5 km radius of each other.
Post period end, in April 2012, we submitted 
a Notice of Discovery following exploration 
work performed by Anglo Asian at its 
Piyazbashi and Agyurt targets during 2010 
and 2011, building on work performed in 
Soviet times. This exploration work included 
surface trenching and sampling, re-sampling 
of 3,000 metres of adits, 2,500 metres of surface 
drilling and 1,400 metres of underground 
drilling at the Agyurt target. 
As with Gosha, under the terms of the PSA, 
following the submission of the Notice of 
Discovery, we have a six month period to 
submit a Development and Production 
Programme to the Government of 
Azerbaijan for approval.
Further information concerning the results 
of the studies and exploration work at Ordubad 
will be announced in due course and further 
exploration work is now planned with a view 
to confirming a small gold deposit with 
production potential. 
Outlook
2011 has been a successful year for Anglo 
Asian in terms of solid gold and copper 
production and increasing profitability. 
The year ahead looks very promising as 
we advance our flagship mining operation 
Gedabek, continuing exploration to increase 
the resource base and define reserves and in 
turn increasing the life of mine. In addition 
the gold production target is 54,000 ounces 
for FY 2012 and the decision to build an 
agitation leaching plant to further improve 
gold recoveries marks an exciting time in 
Gedabek’s development and its future 
success as the first gold mine in Azerbaijan 
in modern times. In addition, we remain 
committed to developing Gosha and 
enhancing our production profile by 
commencing development of a second 
mining operation in the second half of 2013. 
I therefore believe that we are in a strong 
position to generate value for shareholders 
during the coming year and look forward 
to updating shareholders regularly on 
our progress.

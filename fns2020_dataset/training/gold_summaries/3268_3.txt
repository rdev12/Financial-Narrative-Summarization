When I reported to shareholders in
November 2004, we expected that
the activity levels experienced in
the first half would continue to be
broadly similar for the remainder of
the year. In the event this was
indeed the case, and I am pleased
to report that, for the year ended
31 March 2005, it has allowed the
Group to record a significant
improvement over the previous
year despite the difficulties arising
from the escalating costs of raw
materials and energy. 
Turnover for the group reached
£42.0m (2004: £27.3m), a growth
of 54%. Operating profit increased
103% to £2.05m (2004: £1.01m),
while profit before tax, after
exceptional items of £325k relating
primarily to restructuring of the
foundry divisions, and a net
goodwill credit mainly arising from
the Russell acquisition of £299k,
was £1.99m (2004: £1.01m). Fully
diluted earnings per share rose to
18.0p. The balance sheet remains
strong with net debt at the year
end of £42k (2004: Net cash
£482k) after the purchase of
Russell Castings for £1.12m in
cash, and capital investment 
of £1.25m.
The Board is recommending an
unchanged final dividend of 8.0p
per share (11.85p total for the
year) payable on 29 July 2005 to
shareholders on the register as at
close of business on 8 July 2005.
The largest contributor to the
Group’s welcome return to growth
was an excellent performance from
Russell Castings, which we
acquired on 2 April 2004. Russell
has fully lived up to our initial
expectations and continues to
demonstrate it was a sound
investment. Synergy opportunities
and plans for longer term
integration of our foundry activities
continue to be developed. The
Walsall foundry and PFP Electrical
Products, our specialised lighting
business, also showed welcome
progress.
An improvement in demand was
accompanied by very substantial
increases in the costs of our raw
materials and energy. Difficulties
and delays in recovering these cost
rises have had the inevitable effect
of reducing net margins. At the
time of writing there has been a lull
in cost increases, but uncertainty
remains over their future direction.
The Group is presently operating 
at budgeted levels of sales and
profitability. We currently anticipate
activity to remain broadly similar
for the foreseeable future and if
this proves to be the case we
anticipate another year of
underlying progress. In addition,
we will continue to seek new
opportunities to use the Group’s
strong balance sheet to further
enhance earnings.

We are continuing our objective to 
increase overall profit contribution 
from Marketing Services through 
acquisition and growth of businesses 
in this segment. In addition our Print 
businesses continue to perform well 
in difficult market conditions.
Our business operates in two distinct markets: Publishing Services and Marketing Solutions. St Ives’ 
growth strategy aims to develop its sector specific propositions by cultivating a range of services 
and a toolbox of delivery capabilities. 
Our Marketing Solutions offer has strengthened following the acquisitions this year of Response One, 
Pragma and Incite – all of which provide insight offerings to our clients. Our marketing services 
propositions are underpinned by key customer relationships and account management.
We manage our business as two segments: Print, which is primarily efficiency focused, and Marketing 
Services, which is growth focused.

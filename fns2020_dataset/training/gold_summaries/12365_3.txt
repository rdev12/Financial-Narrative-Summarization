Business review
Chairman’s statement
A year of achievement
A year of achievement
2011 was a tremendous year for 
Polymetal, both operationally and  
in terms of corporate development.
Not only did we deliver record levels 
of production, we also achieved  
a Premium Listing on the London 
Stock Exchange in November –  
a month later gaining entry to the 
FTSE 100 index. As a result, we  
have raised our international profile, 
increased our transparency, 
broadened our shareholder base  
and significantly improved our  
access to capital markets. 
We have also maintained a strong 
focus on investment, both in new  
and existing processing facilities  
and exploration. As a result, we have 
made significant progress across  
all our key investment projects.
Corporate governance
We have historically operated 
according to high standards of 
governance. During the year we  
have paid particular attention to 
ensuring that our practices are 
further developed to reflect the 
change in our status, and that  
we achieve compliance with the 
majority of the requirements of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Our aim is to deliver progressively 
more effective stewardship and 
accountability to all our stakeholders 
through an ongoing process of 
review and assessment. Improved 
internal control systems and a 
renewed Board are the key changes 
that we have implemented in 2011.
We now have a stronger and more 
experienced Board, with half of the 
Directors, excluding the Chairman, 
being independent non-executives.  
A careful and disciplined selection 
process has enabled us to attract 
Board members with extensive 
international experience in the mining 
industry. The new Board has a 
greater role in strategic decision-
making, conducts in-depth reviews 
of the Company’s performance  
and is better positioned to maintain  
a constructive dialogue with our 
expanded stakeholder base. The 
Board’s Audit and Risk, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees  
are also now chaired by – and are 
composed of – independent non-
executives and the Board Chairman. 
We have also implemented a range 
of policies and procedures that cover 
internal control, financial reporting, 
risk management and disclosure, 
enabling us to fulfil all the obligations 
required of a UK Premium Listed 
company. The Directors and I are 
strongly committed to maintaining 
the highest standards of corporate 
governance and best practice. 
Our people
I would like to extend my sincere 
thanks to my fellow Directors for their 
wise counsel and hard work in what 
has been a momentous year for 
Polymetal. This year’s good 
performance is the result of a 
collaborative effort on the part of all 
our people. I am, therefore, extremely 
grateful to all our employees whose 
talents and commitment have 
contributed to our success to date. 
I have become Chairman of 
Polymetal International at an 
extremely exciting point in the 
Company’s development. We 
are entering a new era, and  
I have every confidence that 
Polymetal is well positioned  
to build and sustain a strong 
future for all our stakeholders. Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1 9
Financial statements Appendices Governance Business review Overview
Share and dividend policy
Over 83% of JSC Polymetal 
shareholders converted their shares 
to Polymetal International through the 
Institutional Share Swap Facility 
(ISSF). A Mandatory Tender Offer 
(MTO) for the remaining shareholders 
was launched in November, and  
on completion in February 2012 we 
had achieved 99.48% ownership of 
JSC Polymetal, while JSC Polymetal 
delisted its global depositary receipts 
from the London Stock Exchange.
When moving to the London Stock 
Exchange, we carefully considered 
our approach to dividend payment. 
As a result, a new dividend policy 
was adopted in 2011, reflecting our 
commitment to meet shareholder 
expectations in an environment 
characterised on the one hand by 
high commodity prices, and tight 
financial markets on the other.  
A dividend of US$0.20 per share is 
proposed by the Board for payment 
for 2011. From 2012, we intend to  
pay annual dividends of 20% of net 
income, provided that net debt/
adjusted EBITDA is less than 1.75.
Outlook
Polymetal is entering a new era.  
Our strategy of improving efficiencies 
in existing mines, creating centralised 
processing hubs to benefit from 
economies of scale, and investing  
in exploration has given us the 
foundations to deliver long-term 
growth.
Despite continuing economic 
uncertainty across global markets, 
we believe we have a robust 
business model and a clear strategy 
that will enable us to prosper in the 
years ahead. We remain firmly 
focused on delivering the sustainable 
value that will establish Polymetal as 
a world class mining company.

Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Q How would you describe 2015  
for Lamprell? 
2015 will certainly be remembered as 
a difficult year for the industry, but for 
Lamprell it was an important turning point. 
After a year of recovery in 2013 and the 
exceptional performance in 2014, this 
year has shown the underlying robustness 
of Lamprell’s business with its ability to 
be flexible and adapt to the changing 
environment. In 2015 we demonstrated 
that Lamprell is resilient enough to return 
to normalised performance, even in the 
context of a challenging market.
Q What is your assessment of 
Lamprell’s performance in 2015?
Overall, our performance across the key 
metrics was strong. We focussed on the 
elements under our control, which allowed 
us to manage the impact of the external 
environment. Operationally, we have 
done well, delivering three major projects 
on time, on budget and to high safety 
and quality standards. We have seen an 
extension in scope of the project we are 
fabricating for Petrofac, a testament to 
our performance. Our yards remained full 
throughout the second half of the year .
The strength of our client relationships is 
a key driver of our performance, and we 
continued to develop these through our 
collaborative approach. Having awarded 
Lamprell the ninth jackup rig  pages 24 
and 25, NDC subsequently extended its 
options with Lamprell. We also offered 
the service of stacking client rigs in our 
facilities  page 27 in the spirit of current 
and future cooperation.
Our safety record throughout the year  
was steady with a TRIR of around 0.3. 
The Jebel Ali and Dubai facilities achieved 
a major milestone having now operated 
for three years without a day away from 
work case (DAFWC). We have set new 
improvement goals and are looking at 
new ways to strengthen the safety culture 
further within the workforce and prevent all 
avoidable incidents  page 30.
We have also significantly improved our 
efficiency and productivity in the yards.  
The implementation of Project Evolution  
 page 12 was almost entirely completed 
by the end of the year , with a new panel 
line  page 24 fully operational and with 
significant improvements in automation. 
After a year of exceptional 
financial results in 2014, 
Lamprell has maintained 
a steady operational 
performance and built 
on the strong business 
position towards long-term 
growth. The focus is now on 
executing our strategy .
BUILDING  
ON OUR 
STRONG 
FOUNDATIONS Q When are you expecting to see the 
benefits of Project Evolution? 
We started to see the benefits in terms 
of productivity almost immediately upon 
completion of each component of the 
project. As you would expect with the 
introduction of new equipment and training 
requirements, some of the initiatives took 
time to ramp up to their full rate but we 
have benefited from the improvements 
throughout the year . 
For example, welding  page 26, 
which constitutes a major component 
in fabrication with approximately 30% 
of manhours, has seen a dramatic 
improvement as we modernised our 
processes. The beam cutting robots cut 
beams to exact size multiple times faster 
and more accurately than a human can. 
We have optimised painting, crane and 
scaffolding services, as well as our use  
of yard space and assets  page 34. 
As a result, we have been able to 
accommodate the construction of seven 
concurrent jackup rigs  page 25 in our 
Hamriyah yard, a record for the Group. 
Q What are the financial benefits of 
these improvements?
When we announced Project Evolution, 
we explained that we expect full payback 
within three to four years. While this remains 
appropriate guidance, we delivered better 
savings than first anticipated in 2015. The 
savings and efficiencies generated by 
Project Evolution  page 12 allowed us 
to protect our margins whilst at the same 
time remaining competitive in a market with 
increased pricing pressure. With the recent 
appointment of Niall O’Connell as COO, 
a strong focus will be on driving these 
operational improvements even further . 
Q What were the main challenges you 
encountered and how did you adapt  
to face them?
As drilling programmes started to be 
scaled back in response to weak oil prices, 
the pace of the contract awards slowed 
down the whole supply chain. Along with 
our peers, we suffered from this which is 
reflected in the lack of major awards during 
the second half of the year . 
In response, we have continued to improve 
our approach to business development 
and, specifically, we dynamically adapted 
the composition of our bid pipeline  
 page 8 throughout the year to address 
the changing circumstances. When our 
target projects moved to the right, we 
regularly reassessed their likelihood of 
sanction or proactively replaced them with 
new bids more likely to be awarded in the 
near future. In practice, this was driven by 
a conscious shift away from the quieter 
international markets to more buoyant 
regional markets such as the Middle East 
which maintains higher activity levels  
in the current environment. 
This approach allowed us to mitigate 
the risk  page 16 of adverse impact 
in areas where we have control, but of 
course Lamprell cannot resist the market 
dynamics. While bidding activity levels are 
high, we continue to be affected by the 
industry-wide trend of projects drifting  
to the right.
Q What are your predictions for 2016?
The strong foundations laid over the last 
18 months have created a structure for us 
to be competitive and deliver operational 
excellence consistently . With our ongoing 
bidding efforts, we expect to be able to
persevere through the downturn and then 
emerge from it in a position for growth to 
deliver our strategy  page 14.
In our drive to expand our offering, we 
also built our first land rig of Lamprell’s 
proprietary design  page 27, which we 
started marketing towards the end of the 
year . We believe it will be an attractive 
product for Middle East clients, having 
been specifically designed for the region.
We believe our ability to win large projects 
could be enhanced by forming strategic 
alliances. In early 2016 we signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding regarding 
Lamprell’s potential participation in the
Maritime Complex in eastern Saudi Arabia. 
We will continue to scrutinise the market  
for other value-added alliances.
There is a lot of uncertainty in the current 
markets but Lamprell’s focus for 2016  
is on demonstrating resilience and its 
ability to progress towards future growth 
despite the industry challenges. We are 
confident in our ability to deliver on our 
strategy  page 14.

WE ARE A KEY PLAYER
IN THE GLOBAL ENERGY MARKET
Following Lamprell’s 
record performance in 
2014, this year presented 
new challenges. However , 
challenges that test some 
organisations will create 
opportunities for others. 
Despite falling oil prices 
and slowing demand, our 
2015 bid pipeline remained 
strong. We aim to weather 
the downturn and are 
currently in a strong position 
for the anticipated recovery 
as the world’s energy 
demand is expected to 
continue its rise of around 
0.8% each year over the  
next 20 years

Macroeconomic factors and strategy
Amid the continued oil price depression, 
there continues to be a strong discipline 
around any E&P spend and new 
high profile developments are closely 
scrutinised. This has had an impact on 
project awards in 2015. However , the 
impact for Lamprell is mitigated to some 
extent by our expertise and focus which 
primarily lie in the conventional and shallow 
water activities. 
While long-term industry fundamentals 
remain strong with capex forecast to 
recover by 2020, the shorter-term capex 
for the upstream oil & gas industry is set to 
drop by a further 20% from 2015 capex
2
 
levels. Major oil companies also continue 
to delay final investment decisions due to 
cash flow affordability and less favourable 
project economics caused by current low 
energy prices. 
Offsetting this, the conventional shallow 
water in the Middle East region where  
most production costs are viable at levels 
below USD 30/bbl
3
 remains attractive  
with continued investment forecast over  
the next five years. Led by Saudi Arabia 
and Iran (post sanctions), the Middle East 
is pressing ahead with major oil & gas 
development projects. By leveraging  
our strong reputation and regional 
presence, Lamprell expects to win our 
share of these opportunities although 
we recognise that competition for such 
projects has intensified. 
Our business opportunities
We continue to diversify our bid pipeline 
portfolio across our market sectors  
and via a broader geographic footprint. 
This has strengthened our bid pipeline, 
which as at 31 December 2015 totalled 
USD 5.4 billion. With a win rate slightly 
over 30% in 2015, we continue to focus on 
converting the pipeline to contract awards. 
However , numerous projects have been 
cancelled or deferred. Consistent with our 
2015 refined corporate strategy  page 14 
we are proactively sourcing opportunities 
through diversification across markets. 
The emphasis will be to target sizeable 
opportunities through strategic alliances 
and partnerships. We recently announced  
a Memorandum of Understanding regarding 
Lamprell’s potential participation in the 
Maritime Complex in Saudi Arabia. We have 
also agreed to work with Dubai Drydocks 
to identify opportunities for cooperation on 
FPSO projects in the context of Dubai’s 
aspiration to become a strategic location  
for FPSU/FPSO.

New build jackup rigs
While the global jackup drilling 
fleet has seen a significant 
increase over the past seven 
years through aggressive build 
programmes by major drilling 
operators and speculators, 
worldwide jackup utilisation 
decreased to 67.4% at 
December 2015 versus 
83.5% at December 2014. 
Despite the current oversupply 
of jackup rigs, the market 
specifically in the Middle East 
is still promising as NOCs 
invest billions of dollars into 
redeveloping maturing fields. 
A forecast 4% CAGR rise in 
shallow water drilling over the 
next six years in the Middle 
East should compensate for 
some of this decline
4
, with 
the slowdown in new orders 
expected to continue until 
the oversupply of rigs is re-
balanced. Meanwhile, Lamprell 
has a proven capability of 
bidding competitively against 
international bidders. Of 
the three rig orders in 2015, 
Lamprell received one new 
order from an established 
drilling contractor . 
Offshore platforms 
Fixed offshore platform 
demand in the medium term is 
anticipated to remain resilient 
due to the lower sanction 
point generally required for 
shallow water as opposed 
to deep water floating 
developments. The Middle East 
region, notably Saudi Arabia, 
Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Iran, 
remains highly attractive in 
this environment. The long-
term fundamentals remain in 
place despite the near-term 
uncertainty in this sector . 
With the projected growth of 
deep water developments 
in the longer time frame, 
FPSOs are expected to be the 
preferred solution among the 
floating production concepts, 
as fixed platforms become 
technically challenging and 
cost prohibitive. With Lamprell’s 
geographical location, cost 
competitiveness and proven 
track record of world-class 
project delivery, we are well 
positioned to re-enter this 
potential growth market  
as the industry recovers. 
Modules
Despite the expected softening 
in spend due to recent over-
supply in refining capacity 
in the downstream market, 
significant investment is 
continuing in the Middle East 
and hence this remains a key 
region for Lamprell where the 
Group is strategically located. 
Investment is divided with circa 
50% on upgrades to existing 
refineries and the remainder 
split between maintaining 
existing facilities and greenfield 
projects
5
. We increased our 
volumes of modular work 
in 2015, demonstrating our 
capabilities in this area, and 
continue to actively pursue 
opportunities in all onshore 
module markets. The long-term 
outlook for the LNG industry 
remains positive as vast 
reserves of natural gas are 
being discovered in developing 
regions such as East Africa. 
Investment in LNG facilities 
has increased in recent years 
as global demand is trending 
towards natural gas, a fuel 
considered to be cheaper and 
more environmental friendly 
as highlighted at the COP21 
climate conference in 2015.
Oil & gas contracting services 
Although drilling activity is 
subdued by current oil price 
forecasts, we expect there to 
be continued activity in the 
Middle East market for jackup 
rig refurbishment services as 
the aging rig population often 
requires regular maintenance 
or upgrades. This business 
stream also includes site 
works, pressure vessels, 
static equipment and general 
fabrication works, all of 
which are required to operate 
regional facilities, and are core 
competencies of Lamprell. 
There is a relatively modest 
outlook forecast for the global 
land rig market until 2019, 
however the global rig count will 
need to expand in order to meet 
projected drilling demand

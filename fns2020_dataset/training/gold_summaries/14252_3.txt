Chairman’s Statement
Silverdell Plc is well placed for the future, 
with a strong balance sheet, a capable 
management team, effective internal 
disciplines and excellent customer 
relationships that underpin a strong 
order book.
I am pleased to report substantial progress during the second half 
of the year, including a successful share placing that raised £5.3m 
in cash (after costs) and the repayment of £4.75m of debt which 
led to a reduction in gearing to 26% at 30 September 2009. This 
has been combined with a business review undertaken by the 
new management team that has established a clear strategy for 
the business, a reduction in overheads and a focus on improving 
our gross margins. There is much still to be done, but I consider 
that the Silverdell Group is well placed for the future, with a 
strong balance sheet, a capable management team, effective 
internal disciplines and excellent customer relationships that 
underpin a strong order book. The market remains competitive 
with substantial margin pressure; however, Silverdell is positioned 
now to win new business on both a short and long-term basis at 
reasonable margins.
We welcomed Ian Johnson onto the Board in August as the Chief 
Financial Officer and we have started the search for an additional 
independent Non-Executive Director. We have also made some 
changes at the divisional Managing Director level to further 
strengthen the team to enable the Group to fulfil its growth plans 
and reinforce its position as the dominant provider of specialist 
hazardous waste remediation services in the United Kingdom.

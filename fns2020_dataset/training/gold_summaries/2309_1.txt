Booker Group plc
annual report & accounts 2010
Booker continues to make good progress. 
in november 2005 we outlined our plan 
to focus, drive and broaden the business. 
that plan continues on track:
FOCUS
(commenced November 2005) 
We continue to improve business efficiency 
and cash management. throughout the 
business we are seeking to ‘stop, simplify 
and standardise’ work so that we enhance 
customer service whilst improving efficiency. 
through tight cash management we ended 
the year with net cash of £7m compared to 
net debt of £25m at the end of the previous 
financial year.
DRIVE
(commenced April 2006)
During the year we served 431,000 
customers, an increase of 17,000 
customers versus last year. We survey more 
than 40,000 customers each year to see 
how each branch and product category 
is performing. customer satisfaction for 
choice, price and service has improved 
during the year:
Choice Up
following improvements to the range, •	
fresh departments are doing particularly 
well with sales of fruit and vegetables 
up 54% in the year. 
euro shopper, launched in July 2007, •	
is one of the uK’s fastest growing 
convenience brands with sales of 
more than £40 million per annum at 
wholesale prices. the range now has 
48 products, which allows retailers to 
benefit from great quality products at 
discount prices. More than 16,000 
retailers purchase euro shopper every 
week and the brand has proved popular 
with shoppers. recent launches include 
cornflakes, tissues, bleach, chewing 
gum and noodle snacks. in 2009, euro 
shopper energy Drink won ‘product of 
the Year’ at the prestigious convenience 
retail a wards. 
We continue to build our entry price •	
range for caterers with our Booker 
Basics brand. We have recently 
launched tinned tomatoes, baked beans 
and ketchup. sales are up 28% year on 
year, selling £50m per annum.
in 2008 we launched exclusive lichfields •	
luxury individual portion packs – ideal for 
hotels and pubs. this range extended 
in 2009 with the launch of fair t rade 
coffee sticks and British farm assured 
Milk sticks, has proved very popular with 
sales of £10m per annum, an increase 
of 38%.
Prices Down
our pricing has remained competitive. in •	
spite of increases in commodity prices, 
we have managed to reduce the price 
of bread, milk and other essentials. We 
have developed targeted promotions to 
help our customers drive sales at special 
occasions. these include chinese new 
Year, Back to college and spring clean, 
which have all proved popular. 
Better Service
Booker is now the uK’s largest catering •	
butcher. We regularly hold ‘Meet the 
Butcher’ week in branches giving the 
customers the opportunity to discuss 
their catering needs with their local 
branch butcher. During these weeks 
we have cookery demonstrations, free 
stock give-aways and tastings. 
all branch staff are trained on priDe •	
– our programme to improve parking, 
reception, internal, delivery and exit 
experiences for customers.
our branch delivery service is growing •	
and improving.
Catering
improvements continue to be made •	
to the catering offer resulting in a 3% 
increase in new customers and a 
growth in sales to caterers of 9.1%. 
We are now selling over £1 billion of 
supplies to caterers per annum.

We have strengthened our catering •	
Development team, which is dedicated 
to help caterers grow their businesses, 
from 50 to 75 people over the last 
two years. this team, many of whom 
have worked as chefs, publicans and 
caterers, are experts in developing 
customers’ businesses.
Premier
premier, Booker’s symbol group, •	
continues to go from strength to 
strength and is well on the way to 
becoming the uK’s biggest and best 
symbol group. in the year the estate 
grew from approximately 2,200 to 
2,500 stores.
sales to premier customers grew in the •	
year by approximately 13% to £620m 
(2009: £550m). 
We relaunched premier in March 09, •	
which has been well received by retailers 
and suppliers. Greater emphasis is now 
placed on bringing the premier stores 
closer to the local community, and 
ensuring the store is ranged to meet 
the needs of the local consumer.
BROADEN
(commenced April 2007)
We continue to ‘broaden’ Booker. 
Improving the cash and carry 
experience
in 2006 we converted our first ‘extra’ •	
branch. By March 2010, 91 of the uK’s 
173 branches had been converted to 
the ‘extra’ format. the key features are 
a lighter, brighter branch environment 
and improved layout, signage and 
ranges. our customers much prefer 
the environment. the conversion 
pays back in around a year. We plan 
to convert a further 20 extras in the 
2011 financial year.
Increased delivered wholesale
Booker distributed £797m of product •	
to our customers’ premises this year 
versus £679m last year. about 90% of 
this is delivered via the cash and carry 
branches and 10% from the Booker 
distribution centres. Booker Direct 
serves national accounts. it is the uK’s 
largest food supplier to the cinema 
sector. other customers include HM 
prisons, Marks and spencer and 
we have recently started supplying  
the naafi.

Internet
our website is market leading in the •	
wholesale sector and is continually 
being developed to make it simpler, 
easier and faster for customers to use. 
s ales were £407m this year versus 
last year at £250m. the site is tailored 
to the local branch and customer 
requirements. customers can see 
recent orders, make shopping lists and 
view new promotions and products. 
Booker India 
We opened our first branch in india •	
in september 2009. the offer in the 
Mumbai branch is tailored to suit the 
needs of the indian market. all the stock 
is purchased in india and 99% of the 
colleagues are local. We now have 
approximately 4,000 customers who 
are either kirana stores or caterers. t he 
customer reaction has been excellent. in 
the 2011 financial year we plan to open 
a further branch in Mumbai and test the 
opening of a franchised Booker branch 
in another city with a local partner. We 
believe that outside Mumbai expansion 
with partners could accelerate the roll-
out whilst tailoring our offer to local 
markets. this will help Booker offer the 
best choice, price and service for the 
kirana store and caterer.
the focus, Drive, Broaden plan is facilitated 
by people development and by improving 
the sustainability of the business.
People Development
all branch colleagues are trained in •	
priDe (parking, reception, internal, 
Delivery, and exit.) this programme 
was designed by branch colleagues 
to help improve customer service and 
has made a real impact. 
t here is a shortage of butchers in •	
the trade and as a result we have 
trained over 40 colleagues to start 
a career in butchery. all of these 
colleagues had previously held other 
positions within branches and could 
progress further in the future to 
become Butchery Managers. t his 
first group completed their training in 
august 2009 and currently there are a 
further 52 colleagues who are on the 
programme. 
Sustainability
Booker was the first food wholesaler •	
to be awarded the c arbon t rust 
standard.
Booker has now recycled over 1.5 •	
million litres of catering customers’ 
used cooking oil. at our regional 
distribution centre in Hatfield we 
generate renewable electricity from 
used cooking oil.
recycling increased by 13% and we •	
sent 10% less to landfill in spite of the 
6.5% increase in sales. 
in summary, our plan to focus, drive 
and broaden Booker continues to make 
good progress. By improving the choice, 
price and service we offer to the 431,000 
businesses we serve, Booker has helped 
customers to prosper in a difficult economic 
environment. this has helped us grow sales 
by 6.5% and operating profits by 15%, 
whilst eliminating net debt.
internet sales have again grown strongly, 
while Booker Direct has had another 
good year with more contract wins. the 
opening of our first store in india has been 
successful and we plan to open a further 
two stores in the year ahead.
successful independent retailers, pubs, 
nursing homes and cafes are crucial to 
communities throughout the uK and 
we look forward to continuing to serve 
these customers in the year ahead.  While 
the outlook for the economy remains 
challenging, we are confident that Booker 
will continue to make progress by helping 
our customers to thrive.

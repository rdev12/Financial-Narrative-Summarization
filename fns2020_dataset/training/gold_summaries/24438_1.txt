GREGGS AT A GLANCE: OUR BUSINESS MODEL
We’ve been on a journey to 
transform Greggs from a 
traditional bakery business into  
a winning brand in the dynamic 
food-on-the-go market…
Having made strong progress in recent years, we are now ready to set the bar higher, 
refreshing both our vision and strategic plan to reflect our longer-term ambitions and 
commitment to putting the customer at the heart of our strategy.
What we do Where we operate What we offer
Our purpose
Our business began in the 1930s, serving fresh 
bakery products to working families in the North 
East at prices everyone could afford. T oday we’re 
just as keen for Greggs to have a positive impact on 
people’ s lives. With ambitions to grow to over 2,000 
shops nationwide and ownership of our supply 
chain, we are in a unique position to make good, 
freshly prepared food accessible to everyone.
Our vision
In recent years we have shown we can be a 
winning brand in the food-on-the-go market and 
our vision now is to become the customers’ 
favourite for food-on-the-go. To achieve this  
we need to get even better at seeing our business 
through the eyes of customers and have continued 
to invest in understanding their needs. We recently 
appointed a new Customer Director to lead our 
development of customer insight, making sure it 
drives decision making across the business.
Our operations
Ownership of our supply chain means that we  
can make good, freshly prepared food 
accessible to everyone at great value in  
an extremely competitive market place.  
By managing our own logistics operation we can 
remain focused on the customer, delivering what 
our shops and customers need on time and in full.
Our target market
Greggs is a brand with universal appeal and  
we have been working hard to ensure we 
understand our customers and evolve our  
offer in response to their changing needs. 
This customer understanding informs all our 
decision making as we set out to become the 
customers’ favourite for food-on-the-go. 
Our market locations
As ‘on-the-go’ eating habits change, we have 
built on our existing estate of shops to take 
Greggs where our customers want us to be. 
As a result we can now be found in retail parks, 
shopping centres, industrial estates and office 
parks. We are also located where our customers 
need us when travelling, with shops in travel 
hubs and roadside locations with parking. 
Through our franchise partnerships we are  
also in motorway service stations and 
petrol forecourts. 5

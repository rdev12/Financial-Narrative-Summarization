growth opportunity for K3 and Project 
Gemstone is our major software 
development programme, which is 
enriching and tailoring Microsoft’s new 
A X	pr oduc t	with	our	o wn	IP	t o	cr ea t e	
a world class solution for the retail and 
wholesale	mar kets .	
Microsoft is supporting our 
development programme and the 
software is being written to Microsoft’s 
strict development standards so that our 
solution	will	be	ac cr edit ed	as	 ‘ C er tified	
f or	M icr osof t	D ynamics ’ .	 T he	fully	
completed product will incorporate rich 
func tionalit y	which	w e	ha v e	specifically	
developed for the retail and wholesale

capitalised £0.73m of costs in relation to 
G emst one	and	a	fur ther	£0.28m	on	UK	
specific	G emst one	func tionalit y .
W e	made	the	first	c ommer cial	r elease	of	
Gemstone functionality available in the 
second half of the year and importantly 
have completed initial implementations 
of Gemstone functionality. This gave us 
important reference sites which helped 
us	t o	win	some	sig nifican t	initial	or ders	
in	the	final	quar t er	of	the	financial	y ear	
and we now have an expanding base 
of reference customers, including some

releases of Gemstone later in 2013 and 
expect the development project to be 
fully	c omplet e	ar ound	mid	2014.
Our	position	in	the	UK	cur r en tly	looks	
very encouraging and there is a strong 
pipeline of interest in our new Gemstone

international partner channel which 
gives us access to approximately 27

T he 	 Micr osoft 	 UK 	 Division ’ s 	 disappoin ting	
results for the year reflect the 
combination of very tough conditions in 
the retail sector and the impact of Project 
G emst one . 	 T he 	 first 	 half 	 w as 	 sev er ely 	
affected by order deferrals, which meant 
tha t 	 ser vic es 	 inc ome 	 w as 	 lo w . 	 Ho w ev er ,	
ther e 	 w as 	 a 	 mar ked 	 impr o v emen t 	 in	
or der 	 wins 	 in 	 the 	 sec ond 	 half . 	 In 	 t otal ,	
we signed 59 major new orders, worth 
£6.5m (2012: 28 deals, £6.7m) but more 
sig nifican tly 	 £4.2m 	 of 	 these 	 deals 	 w er e 	
ag r eed 	 in 	 the 	 final 	 quar t er 	 of 	 the 	 y ear 	
and 	 included 	 14 	 major 	 or ders 	 in 	 UK 	 R etail	
which 	 will 	 help 	 t o 	 under pin 	 a 	 sig nifican t 	
impr o v emen t 	 in 	 2014.	
Revenues decreased to £18.86m (2012: 
£24.92m),	and	the	adjust ed	loss	fr om	
operations
*8
	w as	£1.66m	(2012:	pr ofit	
of £2.22m). The loss in the second half 
r educ ed	t o	£0.40m	against	£1.26m	
in	the	first	half ,	sho wing	a	sig nifican t	
turnaround. Margins for the twelve 
mon ths	 f ell	 b y	 9%	 t o	 44%	 r eflec ting	 both	
low level of services revenues in the year 
(the result of expected deals not signing) 
and our investment in the delivery 
resource. Recurring income decreased 
b y	£1.87m	(18%)	which	mainly	r eflec t ed	
some customers reducing spend on 
product support and fewer multi-year 
deals arising on new business.
As mentioned earlier, our new AX retail 
solution, Gemstone, now has customer 
reference sites, and £1.0m of the £5.0m 
new Retail business wins signed in the 
year were for AX solutions based on 
Gemstone functionality. A number of 
these orders were just for the initial 
phases of the implementation of 
Gemstone but, as further phases are 
taken,	w e	expec t	these	wins	t o	gener a t e	
approximately £8.0m of additional 
revenues.
The major part of the £5m of new Retail 
business wins were for our established 
NA V	r etail	solution,	which	is	tar get ed	a t	
medium-sized retailers who want a fully 
integrated multi-channel solution. This 
uptur n	in	demand	f or	our	NA V	solution	
is most encouraging. As most of the new 
business wins came late in the year, they 
had little impact on services income, but 
will	benefit	2014	mar kedly .
T he 	 Division ’ s 	 pr ospect 	 pipeline 	 cur r en tly	
stands at approximately £38.0m (2012: 
£21.0m) with the large majority focused 
on our Gemstone AX solution. We are 
encouraged by signs that retailers 
ar e 	 sho wing 	 mor e 	 c onfidenc e 	 about 	
investing in technology than has been 
previously apparent although it should 
be noted that customers are choosing to 
spend in stages.
T he	smaller	units	in	the	Division	sell	a	
mix tur e	of	non-r etail	NA V ,	non-r etail	
AX and legacy products. These units 
generated revenue of £6.96m (2012: 
£7.27m)	and	adjust ed	pr ofit	fr om	
operations

 of £0.35m (2012: loss of 
£0.21m),	and	closed	45	deals	w or th	
£1.50m (2012: 21 deals at £0.76m).
W hile	the	Division ’ s	r esults	this	y ear	
are disappointing, the improved 
or der	in take	will	r esult	in	a	mar ked	
improvement in its performance in 
the	new	financial	y ear .	K3	is	alr eady	
one of Microsoft’s leading global retail 
par tners ,	with	a	str ong	tr ack	r ec or d	in	
dev eloping	and	deliv er ing	D ynamics	
NA V	based	r etail	solutions ,	f ocused	on	
medium sized retailers. We believe that 
our investment in Gemstone will help us 
bec ome	as	suc c essful	with	D ynamics	A X,	
which is focused on the larger retailers. 
As the trading environment improves, 
our	existing	str ong	mar ket	position

Over the last two years we have merged

that they now operate under a single 
Manag ing 	 Dir ect or 	 and 	 ha v e 	 a 	 lo w er

the reorganisation was in January 2013 
when 	 w e 	 mer ged 	 the 	 sales , 	 mar keting

integration is included in exceptional 
operating costs and is expected to result 
in 	 an 	 annualised 	 benefit 	 of 	 £0.8m 	 of 	
which 	 £0.4m 	 w as 	 r ealised 	 in 	 H2 	 2013.
K3 Sage is now performing well and 
generated recurring annual income of 
around £6.50m (2012: £6.20m). After 
a 	 slo w 	 first 	 half 	 with 	 oper a ting 	 pr ofit

the 	 Division 	 w as 	 £0.55m 	 (2012: 	 £nil),	
which reflected an increase in divisional 
overheads to £3.71m (2012: £2.99m) as we 
invested in our hosting platforms (AX and 
Sage X3) ahead of revenue. 
We have now completed our investment 
in the development of our hosting 
platforms with £0.26m capitalised in 
the year, and offer a range of scaleable 
hosting services from low cost simple 
hosting for smaller customers, through

large global customers. The completion 
of our investment should also facilitate 
a reduction in the cost base of the 
Division 	 and , 	 sinc e 	 the 	 y ear 	 end , 	 w e 	 ha v e

We believe the combination of an upturn 
in 	 demand 	 a t 	 our 	 Micr osoft 	 UK 	 Division,	
the availability of affordable and scalable 
high quality hosting platforms for all our 
products, and a new management team,

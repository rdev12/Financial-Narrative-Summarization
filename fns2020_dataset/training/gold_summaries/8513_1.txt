I am pleased to announce a robust set of results, in line 
with management expectations and delivered against a 
challenging and competitive market.  our strategy to be 
a diversified business has created a balanced and flexible 
portfolio where we are not over exposed to any sector 
or geography.  In the past year, our uK businesses have 
performed strongly ahead of expectation and this has 
offset a delay in the expected pick up in international 
markets. 
Key features of our business during the year included:
•	 a private sector portfolio which accounted for circa 
70% of our revenue, helping to ensure we are not 
over exposed to future uK public sector spending 
cuts;
•	 continued strong allocations from our retail banking 
and food retail clients in the uK;
•	 a slower start to the year overseas as our 
international clients delayed commitments, but a 
stronger performance in revenue and profit in the 
second half of the financial year;
•	 closer customer relationships with multinationals, 
leading to more international opportunity;
•	 an increase in our office network both within and 
outside the uK.  underpinning this has been our 
strategy to grow in line with customer demand 
through both organic growth and acquisition;
•	 development of a high-end residential fit out activity 
in London to complement our commercial and retail 
fit out activities;
•	 we have further embedded our visions and values 
throughout the organisation.  It is this that keeps our 
brand strong and consistent as we continue to build 
our business across new geographies and sectors.  
our vision is to be a leading international brand 
delivering exceptional service in fit out, construction 
and management services; 
•	 we have continued to embed our systems and 
processes in our recent acquisitions and completed 
their integration into the Group.

Results
For the year ended 30 June 2010, adjusted profit before 
tax
1
 was £12.0m (2009: £13.3m) on revenue
2
 of £972m 
(2009: £1,046m).  Adjusted earnings per share
1
 amounted 
to 29.91p (2009: 33.65p).
t here were two exceptional items in the year.  t he first 
exceptional item of £1 .9m was recorded at 31 December 
2009 and represents the Group’s current estimate of 
fines and legal costs net of recoveries in respect of the 
office of Fair trading’s cover pricing investigation of 
two subsidiaries, propencity Group Limited and pearce 
construction (Midlands) Limited, prior to ISG’s ownership.  
t he propencity Group Limited’s fine of £0.1m has been 
settled.  We have lodged an appeal against the fine 
imposed on pearce construction (Midlands) Limited which 
has been heard.  We await the competition tribunal’s 
findings.
t he second exceptional item was the closure of our office 
in Japan, where we offered project management services 
only.  With no sign of recovery in the investment plans 
of our multinational clients in the Japanese market, we 
decided to discontinue our operations at a total loss for 
the year of £0.8m.
net cash as at 30 June 2010 of £31 .0m was slightly 
behind prior year (2009: £32.1m).  In the year there was 
net cash inflow from operating activities of £6.0m (2009: 
£6.9m) and the Group repaid £5.6m of bank borrowings.  
t he Group continues to trade well within its banking 
covenants.  In addition, the Group retains an undrawn 
working capital revolving credit facility of £10.0m which 
expires in 2013. 
Dividends
An interim dividend of 4.20p was paid in April 2010.  
t he Board has decided to recommend an increase for 
the final dividend of 5% to 10.14p, bringing the total to 
14.34p (2009: 13.66p).  Subject to shareholder approval 
at the AGM on 3 December 2010, the final dividend will 
be payable on 7 December 2010 to shareholders on the 
register on 5 november 2010.  t he ex-dividend date will be 
3 november 2010.  t he closing date for elections for the 
Dividend Reinvestment plan is 11 november 2010.

London Fit Out
After two years of decline, we predicted a stabilisation of 
the London fit out market.  t his has proved accurate, with 
revenue up by 4% to £170m (2009: £163m).  However it 
continued to be both a challenging and highly competitive 
market.  With operating margins decreasing to 1 .9% 
(2009: 2.6%), total operating profit decreased by 24% to 
£3.3m (2009: £4.3m).
notable successes over the year have included the fit 
out of KpMG’s new uK headquarters in canary Wharf, a 
15-storey office building totalling 400,000 sq. ft.  We also 
continue to develop our profile in the high-end residential 
sector with a number of prestigious wins in central 
London.  to support this growth in high-end residential, 
we recruited the former management team from Harry 
neal, a long-established London residential construction 
company.
t he current order book stands at £122m (2009: £159m) of 
which £118m is to be delivered in the current financial year 
(2009: £137m).  Significant contract awards for delivery 
in the current financial year include: Riverbank House for 
Man Group, t he Ark, Hammersmith, for Ge capital Real 
estate and 30 crown place, for pinsent Masons.  
currently we are seeing an upturn in the smaller-end 
fit out market and together with our focus on high-end 
residential, we anticipate revenue being ahead in the 
current financial year, although margins are likely to 
continue to be competitive.

London Construction
We expected that revenue would continue to decrease 
from the private sector London construction market.  t his 
is proving to be the case, with commercial developers 
only now starting to return to the market.  In line with this, 
we anticipate seeing an upturn in London construction 
activity levels but not until the second half of 2011 .  t his 
upturn will be partly fuelled by those 25-year leases from 
the 1980s and 15-year leases from the 1990s expiring, 
leading to a demand from new occupiers seeking modern, 
high-quality commercial space. 
During the year, we worked on some high-profile projects 
such as the olympic Velodrome, where our advice and 
methodologies have attracted positive media coverage 
for their delivery of cost and time benefits.  Additionally 
we worked on two large-scale student accommodation 
schemes – nido Spitalfields and nido notting Hill – for 
Blackstone and also a significant mixed-use scheme for 
Marshall Street Regeneration Limited.
Within London construction we have launched a new unit 
called London Building.  London Building is a dedicated 
business unit, established to focus on smaller spend 
projects within London and the South east. 
Despite a decline in revenue of 29% to £154m (2009: 
£217m), the operating margin on revenue increased to 
1 .4% (2009: 0.5%) resulting in operating profit increasing 
by 119%, to £2.2m (2009: £1 .0m).  t his reflects tight 
management of costs, together with better buying 
margins and a different mix of work.
In London, our construction portfolio is heavily weighted 
towards the private sector, so public sector cuts should 
have a negligible effect on our revenues.  However, project 
sizes have reduced, and we are therefore anticipating a 
10% decline in revenue in this financial year.  t he current 
order book stands at £114m (2009: £188m) of which 
£103m is to be delivered in the current financial year 
(2009: £140m).

Regional Construction
t he uK construction market outside London has 
declined as expected at a rate of around 10%.  Revenue 
in the period decreased by 8% to £338m (2009: 
£367m).  However, margins increased to 1 .0% (2009: 
0.8%) resulting in operating profit increasing by 17% 
to £3.5m (2009: £3.0m), mainly as a result of better 
buying margins.  t his is the Group’s one division with 
significant exposure to the public sector although we 
have been careful to ensure that our public sector 
portfolio is broadly spread across sectors, including 
work in education, defence, the Home office, health 
departments and social housing.  In addition, we 
continue to target the business towards smaller projects 
which we believe will be more resilient to the coming uK 
public sector cuts.
We continue to win work under a number of public 
sector frameworks including Ministry of Justice - 
custodial p roperty framework, Aspire Defence’s pFI 
framework, Manchester city council framework, 
Sovereign Housing Group framework, Swann Housing 
Group framework and during the year we were appointed 
to the construction Framework South West, as the Sole 
Framework contractor for Smaller p rojects for cardiff 
city council, and to Sheffield teaching Hospitals nHS 
Foundation t rust framework.
olympic Games related development has also featured 
in the regions, including Garon’s olympic Diving p ool in 
Southend and a national rowing facility in Durham.  While 
commercial activity remains slow, there are now some 
tentative signs of recovery in the residential sector.
During the year, we worked on 72 education projects 
(2009: 56) with a total revenue of £114m (2009: £118m) 
including completing the Suffolk one centre in Ipswich 
and St John’s School in Marlborough.  We have an 
education order book of £99m as at the end of June 2010 
(2009: £108m), which includes t he Manchester college, 
Millwood Special education needs School, north 
Warwickshire college Hinckley and newcastle university 
translational Research Building.
We have continued to spread our geographical reach 
across the uK in order to be positioned locally wherever 
there is market demand.  In line with this, we are 
strengthening our uK office network with a larger office 
in Birmingham and new offices in exeter and cardiff, 
both of which have already started to also support ISG 
pearce’s food retail expansion plans.  As at 30 June 2010, 
the total order book for Regional construction stands at 
£276m (2009: £286m).  of this, £253m will be delivered 
in the current financial year (2009: £223m).  Despite 
the in-year order book being ahead of prior year, we 
anticipate a tougher second half of the year and a decline 
in revenue for the year as a whole of 10%.

Retail
our uK retail operations continue to be provided by ISG 
pearce and ISG cathedral, with ISG p earce focusing on 
major food retail customers and larger format high street 
retailers and ISG cathedral working with the retail banking 
sector and smaller format high street retail customers.
Retail – ISG Cathedral
t he market for the financial services sector has continued 
to grow, in particular, our work under frameworks.  current 
clients include Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, RBS and 
HSBc, the latter choosing ISG to deliver their p remier 
concept Branch in Kings Road, London.  t his increased 
activity from the banking sector has offset challenges 
presented by the high street retail sector.  However, there 
are encouraging signs that the high street retail sector is 
improving with recent wins from existing clients Monsoon 
and t he carphone Warehouse and, in addition, we have 
attracted new clients including Mulberry and oliver 
Sweeney.
ISG cathedral’s reputation for excellence in fit out services 
to the retail and leisure industry has been recognised 
at this year’s global RLI Awards.  t he company not 
only won Shopfitter of the Year, but its project for the 
Doyle collection’s London’s Kensington Hotel was also 
presented with the Award for Interior excellence.
t he order book for ISG cathedral at the end of the 
financial year is in line with the prior year at £50m (2009: 
£51m).
Retail – ISG Pearce
Although the capital spend of key clients on refurbishment 
programmes decreased during the year, ISG pearce was 
able to increase its market share with more turnover 
for new build and extension work, with increased work 
coming from major retailers including tesco, Asda, 
Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer and Morrisons where we 
are a key strategic partner on their frameworks.  During 
the year the business built its first new build supermarket 
for tesco, with three more currently under construction.  
During the last quarter we have continued to receive 
strong allocations with an order book at the end of the 
financial year of £113m (2009: £84m).
o verall, in uK retail, revenue decreased by 8% to £192m 
(2009: £208m).  t he operating margin increased to 3.5% 
(2009: 3.2%) resulting in operating profit being maintained 
at £6.7m (2009: £6.7m).  With the potential growth from 
high street retailers and a continued strong allocation from 
food and banking frameworks, we anticipate increased 
revenue in the current year.

Europe
In mainland europe our multinational clients held back 
from significantly investing in the first half of the year, 
recovering only in the last quarter of the year.  t his, 
despite a positive result in the second half of the year, 
has led to an overall operating loss of £0.2m (2009: 
operating profit £1 .4m).  We continued to grow the 
business with revenue increasing by 14% to £33m (2009: 
£29m).  Highlights have included project wins for clients 
such as Barclays, pfizer and Standard chartered Bank.  
In particular, our appointment to the exxon framework 
has led to projects for them in Belgium and Germany, 
with Rome and egypt scheduled for the year ahead.  on 
the back of customer demand, we continue to develop 
our network of offices in the region, with a new office 
in Geneva opened during the year and our acquisition 
of olson in Russia.  olson, rebranded ISG olson, is a 
specialist fit out company based in Moscow, with a 
strong track record of servicing multinational clients 
and it will further strengthen our european capability.  
our confidence in the future in mainland europe is 
demonstrated by a record order book at the year end of 
£32m in europe (2009: £6m).
Middle East
In the Middle east, where we offer fit out and joinery 
services, the joint venture business continued to 
make a small loss of £0.3m (2009: £0.4m) which was 
predominantly due to the poor performance of the joinery 
division.  However the fit out side of the business made 
a profit, delivering projects such as the Abu Dhabi football 
stadium, a cinema complex for cinestar and a commercial 
office for exxonMobil.  We have continued to invest in the 
build up of our capability in the region and are targeting 
to open a permanent office in Abu Dhabi in the current 
financial year.  
Since the year end, we have agreed terms to dispose 
of our interest in the joinery division to our joint venture 
partner, Al Habtoor Leighton, and to acquire a 100% 
interest in the fit out division.  t he order book for the fit 
out division at the end of the financial year is £9m (2009: 
£6m).

Asia
our Asia operations experienced significant margin 
pressure and a weighting in volumes to the second half of 
the year.  o verall the business continues to grow.  
Revenue from continuing operations increased by 44% 
to £86m (2009: £60m) but with operating margins 
decreasing to 2.2% (2009: 3.7%).  operating profit from 
continuing operations decreased by 16% to £1 .9m (2009: 
£2.2m).
Highlights in the year include our work for major clients 
such as Marina Bay Sands casinos, a 225,000 sq. ft. office 
for Standard chartered Bank (ScB) in Singapore and the 
project management of the Saudi Arabia pavilion at the 
Shanghai expo.  We were also appointed to the Goldman 
Sachs project management framework for china.  After 
the year end, we were appointed by ScB to provide 
project management services in Asia under a two-year 
contract.  Additionally, ISG’s design team hub in china was 
awarded a global two-year agreement to provide technical 
production design services for ScB internationally.
We have continued to progress in the retail sector, 
particularly in Hong Kong and china, working with clients 
such as Ralph Lauren, Apple, citibank, Bohai Bank, 
uGG and Giorgio Armani on their international roll out 
programmes.
t he year ahead is likely to be characterised by maintained 
volumes consolidating last year’s significant growth and 
a continued recovery in margins.  We expect our profit 
contribution within Asia to be more evenly spread than 
last year.  to support our future in the region we will be 
looking to continue to develop our people and we have 
appointed peter K Yam as a non-executive director of ISG 
Asia.  peter has extensive business experience in the 
region and was previously president of emerson Greater 
china - p eter’s focus will be to advise on our Greater 
china strategy and also to help us develop our leadership 
capability in the region.
Last year’s order book was heavily weighted to Singapore 
with the large Marina Bay Sands casino projects (£21m).  
t he order book at the end of the financial year of £26m 
(2009: £42m) is more evenly spread and focused on 
smaller projects.
We anticipate continued investment from our retail 
clients and we are now starting to see the recovery of 
the financial sector and an increase in commercial office 
activity.  For example, since the year end we have been 
appointed to project manage the 350,000 sq. ft. credit 
Suisse relocation to Kowloon.

Structure
As of 1 July 2010 we have reorganised to face the 
market with three distinct offers:
•	 For multinational corporate office and retail fit out 
customers the Group provides a broad range of 
services internationally;
•	 For national food retail customers the Group 
provides a comprehensive range of services in 
the uK extending from large and small fit out to 
refurbishment and new build;
•	 For uK construction customers the Group provides 
a full network of regionally based construction 
businesses operating on a nationally coordinated 
basis across england and Wales.
t his change to our structure, which includes the 
refocusing of our management teams on the three 
offers, will be reflected in the reporting of our numbers 
in future.  t he change is part of our ongoing development 
of the ISG brand, designed to make it easier for 
customers to engage with the right part of the business.  
It is reflected in our new corporate website, launched in 
June 2010. 
Outlook
At the end of June 2010 our total order book was £742m 
(2009: £822m), of which £704m (2009: £686m) is for 
delivery in the current year and £38m (2009: £122m) for 
the next financial year.
Across the Group, we will continue to focus on 
growing and developing our relationships with national 
and international customers.  t his, alongside our 
strengthened office network and further appointments 
to frameworks, will form the backbone of our strategy. 
t he London fit out market is likely to be stable over 
the coming year, with a greater number of smaller 
projects and an increase in activity in high-end residential 
refurbishment.  For London and Regional construction, 
with public sector cuts and waiting for the return of the 
private sector, the market is likely to decline overall in 
the second half of the financial year.
In uK retail, with continued strong investment by the 
banks and food retailers and the return of the high 
street, we expect volumes in the retail market to be 
moderately higher than the last financial year.
In europe, we expect to see continued progress 
in the next 12 months particularly in respect of the 
opportunities presented by the expansion plans of our 
multinational clients and we will also commence offering 
retail fit out.
In Asia, similarly with the return of finance sector clients 
to augment our strong activity with retail customers, we 
expect to see continued progress and benefit from the 
recovery of the Asian economy.
While there is little doubt that overall our markets will 
remain highly competitive over the coming year, we 
are seeing a recovery in the spending programmes of 
our private sector customers.  our results show the 
continued resilience of the Group and our strategy 
places us well to resume the growth path we 
demonstrated leading up to the global economic crisis.

 We consider PFO and EPS, excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements  
(for more information see pages 33, 60 and 107 to 108), to be appropriate indicators of performance,  
as these measures:
—  exclude significant items which, by virtue of their size or incidence, could potentially distort  
year-on-year comparisons
—  allow a better understanding of the financial information presented, and specifically the Group’s 
underlying business performance, by excluding fair value movements on economic hedges
—  assist shareholders and analysts who, for the reasons set out above, have expressed a preference  
for the reporting of results without the inclusion of the effects of exceptional items and specific  
IAS 39 mark to market movements
Presenting the Group’s segmental results, total PFO, and EPS, before exceptional items and specific  
IAS 39 mark to market movements, is consistent with the way management measures the Group’s 
performance in its budgets, forecasts and management accounts on a day-to-day basis.
The financial KPIs are calculated from data included within the consolidated financial statements.  
On pages 33 to 35, the results of our financial KPIs, which are presented excluding exceptional  
items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements, are also reconciled to the results presented 
including exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements.

Key performance indicators
We use a range of performance indicators, both financial and non-financial, to measure the delivery of our 
strategic objective – growth in shareholder value through the efficient operation, financing, and trading of 
output from our portfolio, whilst maintaining the highest levels of safety and environmental performance 
– and to manage the business.
The most important of these measures are considered Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and their targets 
are determined annually during the business planning process. The KPIs are used by management to compare 
actual performance during the year, and the latest monthly forecasts, against the annual budgeted targets. 
Our KPIs, both financial and non-financial, are set out below.
The explanations and results of our KPIs follow.
Key performance indicators and financial highlights
International Power Annual Report 2008
28 Profit from operations
PFO is a measure of the operating profitability of the 
Group. It excludes the impact of all non-operating 
costs from subsidiaries, financing costs and  
income tax expense, and therefore provides  
a comprehensive measure of operational 
performance. 
PFO, excluding exceptional items and specific  
IAS 39 mark to market movements, has grown  
at an average compound growth rate of 47%  
over the last four years reflecting strong financial 
performance over the period. The results for the 
current and prior year are also presented in the 
consolidated income statement on page 103.
This KPI is also used as one of the measures to 
evaluate Regional Directors’ performance when 
quantifying their annual bonuses (more information 
can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report 
on pages 84 to 99).
 
Earnings per share
EPS is a measure of the overall profitability of the 
Group and shareholder returns. It is defined as the 
profit in pence attributable to each Ordinary Share 
in the Company, based on the consolidated profit 
for the year, after deducting tax and minority 
interests. Growth in EPS over time is indicative  
of the ability of the Group to add value.
EPS, excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 
mark to market movements, has grown at an 
average compound growth rate of 39% over the 
last four years. The calculation of this year’s result is 
presented in note 11 to the financial statements on 
page 126. This KPI is also used as the basis of one  
of the measures to evaluate Directors’ performance 
when quantifying their annual bonuses and as a 
performance condition in their long-term incentive 
plans (more information can be found in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on pages 84 to 99).
This KPI is also used as a performance condition  
in the Company’s share-based reward and  
incentive schemes (more information can be  
found in note 28 of the consolidated financial 
statements on pages 141 to 145).

Business overview 29 Free cash flow
Power generation is a capital-intensive business  
and hence it requires the assets within the Group  
to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the initial 
investment in those assets, to provide returns  
for shareholders and to provide funds for future 
investment opportunities. We define free cash  
flow as net cash flow from operating activities after 
all pre-exceptional operating costs, maintenance 
capital expenditure, interest and tax (i.e. exceptional 
items are excluded from free cash flow).
We consider this measure of cash flow to be a key 
indicator of performance as it measures the cash 
generated from the underlying business 
performance of continuing operating activities.  
This is consistent with the way management 
measures the Group’s performance in its budgets, 
forecasts and management accounts on a day-to-
day basis. This KPI is also used as one of the 
measures to evaluate Directors’ performance when 
quantifying their annual bonuses (more information 
can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report 
on pages 84 to 99).
Free cash flow has grown at an average compound 
growth rate of 49% over the last four years 
reflecting both an increase in the size of the Group 
and strong operational and financial performance 
over the period. The results for the current and prior 
year are also presented in the consolidated cash 
flow statement on page 106.
 
Non-financial KPIs
Accident frequency rate
Health and safety is of vital importance in our 
business. It is important to provide all personnel  
at our sites with a safe place to work, and any 
accident is disruptive to the running of the  
business. AFR is our reporting standard and is 
defined as the number of Lost Time Accidents  
(LTAs) divided by the number of hours worked, 
multiplied by 100,000. 
We define a LTA as 24 hours absence from work – 
this is a much tighter definition than the usual legal 
requirement of three days. In addition to recording 
accidents at our subsidiaries we include, in the 
results presented, any accidents pertaining to staff 
at joint ventures and associates and we also include 
contractors in our accident statistics, which is not 
common practice. This approach to reporting helps 
us to improve our understanding and management 
of health and safety at our sites.
The majority of the injuries are relatively minor and 
result from slips, trips and falls, or incorrect lifting 
and handling. More serious injuries are rare.
In 2008 the AFR for employees and contractors  
combined was 0.09. This can be compared with  
0.12 for 2007. International Power has seen a 
reduction in AFR over the last three years and 
intends to maintain this improvement. This does not 
mean we tolerate unsafe behaviour; our overriding 
target is zero LTAs. All Regional Directors have a 
common personal, non-financial objective, relating 
to Health, Safety and the Environment (HS&E).

International Power Annual Report 2008
30 Reportable environmental incidents
Our power plants are issued with environmental 
licences by the relevant statutory authorities. 
Environmental licences require that any significant 
environmental incident is reported. 
We have always had a policy of complying with  
all applicable environmental regulations and we 
measure our ability to comply with environmental 
regulations by recording the number of reportable 
environmental incidents at all plants where we have 
an interest (including joint ventures and associates). 
 
In 2008 there were six reportable environmental 
incidents which demonstrates a significant 
improvement on 2007. This information is derived 
using data submitted by individual plants directly 
into the corporate reporting system.
The environmental incidents reported in 2008 
related to relatively minor breaches of the pollution 
control limits set by operating licenses and none 
have led to prosecution. International Power has 
reduced reportable environmental incidents over 
the last four years and intends to maintain this 
improvement as it moves towards the ultimate  
goal of zero reportable environmental incidents.
Technical availability
Technical availability measures when a plant  
is available for dispatch. Each of our plants will 
generally be unavailable during some periods in  
the year due to a combination of planned outages 
for maintenance and unplanned outages.
An important aspect of our business is ensuring that 
our merchant power trading and Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs) are closely aligned to our 
operational activities and availability planning is a 
key factor in this regard. The year-on-year variance 
in the profile of planned outages influences the 
technical availability.
Technical availability is calculated by first 
determining the potential maximum amount of 
electricity that could be generated in the year if all 
our plants, including joint ventures and associates, 
were operated at full output for the entire year.  
We then deduct from this maximum amount the 
electricity that could not be produced due to 
planned and unplanned outages at the plants 
throughout the year. 
This number is then expressed as a percentage  
of the potential maximum electricity that could be 
generated, where all these quantities are calculated 
in terms of electrical energy (GWh). This calculation 
is performed by using data submitted by individual 
plants directly into the corporate reporting system.
In 2008 we achieved technical availability of 89.1%, 
a decrease from the 90.0% achieved in 2007. The 
extension of the outage at Rugeley was the key 
contributor to the reduced technical availability  
this year. If technical availability at Rugeley had  
been consistent with its average performance  
over the last three years, the technical availability  
of the portfolio as a whole would have been 90.3%.

Financial highlights
The financial information included in the consolidated financial statements has been prepared on the basis 
of all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
(EU). A discussion of the policies we believe to be most critical in considering the impact of estimates and 
judgements on the Group’s financial position and results of operations are set out on pages 52 to 61.
In order to allow a full understanding of the financial information presented within the consolidated 
financial statements, and specifically the Group’s underlying business performance, the Group presents  
its income statement such that it separately identifies: 
—  the results excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements
—  the effect of the exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements
—  the total result
The basis of preparation is outlined more fully in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on  
pages 107 to 108. However, in summary, those items that the Group separately present as exceptional  
are items which, in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size  
or incidence in order to enable a proper understanding of the financial information. Those items that  
the Group separately present as specific IAS 39 mark to market movements are those mark to market 
movements recorded in the income statement which relate to: derivative contracts into which the Group 
has entered in order to economically hedge certain of its physical and financial exposures; and fair value 
gains and losses on equity conversion features embedded within convertible bonds, so as to separately 
identify a non-cash movement which, if the conversion option is exercised, will ultimately be extinguished 
by the issue of equity. 
A summary of the Group’s financial performance during the year is as follows:

2008 PFO (excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements) at £1,050 million 
is 16% ahead of 2007, driven by higher profit from operations in Australia and North America, a record 
year at First Hydro in the UK, and good performance from our long-term contracted asset base.
PFO (excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements) is discussed in more

2008 EPS (excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements) at 32.4p is 20% 
ahead of 2007. This increase principally reflects those items discussed under the heading ‘profit from 
operations’ and also reflects an increase in interest expense and a smaller increase in tax expense (both  
of which are discussed on page 53).

compared with 2007. This decrease is driven by an increase in maintenance capital expenditure of  
£37 million, principally at Rugeley, Hazelwood and Saltend; and an increase in net interest paid of  
£87 million. In addition, there was a working capital increase in the year of £109 million due to stock

Dividend 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 8.59 pence per share, bringing the full-year dividend to  
12.15 pence per share (2007: 10.16 pence per share), an increase of 20% year-on-year. Payment  
of this final dividend to shareholders registered on the Company share register on 5 June 2009 is due  
to be made on 9 July 2009, following approval at the 2009 AGM which will be held on 21 May 2009.
Outlook
We have a well established portfolio of long-term contracted assets which continues to perform well.  
We are also well positioned in our key merchant markets, although forward pricing in the UK and  
the US does not reflect the attractive long-term market fundamentals. In the absence of a significant 
improvement in pricing in these two markets, it is likely that Group profitability in 2009 will be lower  
than in 2008. However, our assets are well placed to capture value, from both market recovery and  
short-term pricing volatility. The financial position of the Group remains strong, with good corporate 
liquidity and no material refinancings in 2009. We expect to continue to deliver strong free cash flow  
in 2009.

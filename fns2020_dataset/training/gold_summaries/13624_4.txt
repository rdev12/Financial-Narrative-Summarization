continues to have a strong
valvemaker base with a powerful
engineering and production
heritage that is integral to the
major infrastructure development
projects that are active across 
the world.
AFRICA
This is a diverse market with some
signiﬁcant project development
programmes. Investment in the
power industry as well as in 
oil & gas is supported through 
our direct presence, local agents
and distributors as well as
regionally from our European
production units.
ASIA
Rotork has traditionally been strong
throughout Asia and now counts
mainland China as the biggest
market for Rotork electric valve
actuators. We are making progress
in bringing these and the Rotork
Gears products into the wider and 
more price competitive areas of
infrastructure development in this
important market. India has long
been core to Rotork’ s strategy with
two production plants and 
a further three sales ofﬁces.

This large geographic area is
supported by three customer
support centres, one dedicated to
the Fluid Systems products, and
one to Rotork Controls products.

Nationwide Accident Repair Services plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Introduction
In very tough trading conditions, underlying
results for the year are creditable, with profit
before tax excluding non-recurring items at £5.5
million on sales of £172.9 million. In addition,
our financial position remains robust with net
cash at the year end standing at £8.0 million
compared to £7.5 million at the same point 
in 2010.  
Underlying profits however are below our
original expectations for the financial year and
reflect a difficult second half where our more
profitable light repair insurance work reduced
both in total and as a proportion of our overall
repair volumes, not helped by the very mild and
dry weather. The trend for consumers to avoid
making claims on their motor insurance policies
for light cosmetic damage is a feature very
much in play currently. Progress outside our core
insurance market in our newer market segments
of fleet and retail has been encouraging and we
are successfully cross-selling our services into
new and existing customers. Over the year, fleet
and retail sales have risen respectively by 25%
to £24.5 million and 55% to £9.4 million.  
In November 2011, in view of economic
conditions, we took decisive action to rebalance
the Group’s cost base. This was largely completed
in January 2012 and has incurred one-off costs
of £8.1 million in the period under review. The
expected annualised savings arising from the
cost-saving programme are approximately £1.9
million. It is important to note that we have also
preserved our overall operational capacity.  
Nationwide remains a leading operator in its
core market, benefiting from a comprehensive
offering, a national network of bodyshops and
efficient operating systems. We continue to focus
on managing workflows effectively and our
growing mobile repair offering plays an important
role in this, as well as aiding our steady expansion
in the fleet and retail markets. We believe that
the strategy of leveraging our infrastructure and
systems to grow sales in non-insurance related
markets, where Nationwide is currently relatively
under-represented, continues to offer very good
growth potential over time and progress to date
is encouraging.  
The Board is pleased to recommend an increased
final dividend of 3.6p per share, taking the total
dividend for the year to 5.5p (2010: 5.3p).
Financial Results
Revenues for the year ended 31 December 2011
were £172.9 million (2010: £172.3 million).
However, as indicated above, the mix of repair
work included a greater proportion of larger
repairs, with lower margins, against light repairs,
with higher margins. This adversely affected gross
margins which reduced to 45.6% from 47.2%
in 2010. Operating profit before non-recurring
items was £5.2 million (2010: £6.4 million).  
Profit before tax before non-recurring items was
£5.5 million (2010: £6.0 million) and earnings per
share before non-recurring items were 9.2p per
share (2010: 10.4p). During the year, the Group
implemented a cost reduction programme to align
Nationwide’s cost base with the current market
requirements. The total one-off non-recurring
items relating to this programme were £8.1
million, of which £1.8 million was a cash cost 
in the financial year under review. The expected
annualised savings are £1.9 million. Taking into
account non-recurring items, the statutory loss
before tax was £2.6 million and the statutory
loss per share was 5.5p (2010: earnings per
share of 10.4p).
The Group’s balance sheet remains robust, with
no borrowings and net cash of £8.0 million as
at 31 December 2011 (2010: £7.5 million), which
was ahead of expectations due to strong year
end customer cash receipts.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to recommend an increased
final dividend of 3.6 pence per share (2010: 3.5
pence per share). This takes the total dividend
for the year to 5.5 pence per share (2010: 5.3
pence per share). 
Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual
General Meeting on 25 June 2012, the final
dividend will be paid to shareholders on 2 July
2012, based on the register at the close of
business on 1 June 2012.
Trading overview
Conditions in our traditional insurance-funded
market proved challenging. During the first half
of the year, we achieved a small increase in
volumes, compared to an overall decline in
insurance claims across the industry, however
insurance claims frequency decreased sharply in

Chairman’s Statement 
the second half and our volumes were
affected, particularly for light repairs. In order
to win volumes in a market where claims
frequency is under pressure, we launched a
number of sales initiatives and we continued
to secure new insurance contracts over the
year. Given the ongoing economic conditions,
in the second half, management took decisive
action and initiated a cost reduction
programme to realign Nationwide’s cost base
with demand, generating annualised cost
savings of approximately £1.9 million.  
Nationwide remains a leading provider in the
insurance marketplace and notwithstanding
the current environment, we believe that the
Group is well placed to build on this position.
As insurers seek to enhance efficiency by
consolidating their suppliers, our integrated
offering is attractive.  
Our initiative to build our presence in the fleet
and retail markets saw good progress, with
pleasing volume increases.  Fleet volumes
increased 25% to £24.5 million (2010: £19.6
million). We are cross-selling our core
competencies to the fleet and retail markets
with increasing success.   
Direct retail sales grew by 55% to £9.4 million
(2010: £6.1 million). We have invested in
additional resource to support growth in these
markets and it is pleasing to see the benefits
of this coming through. In October 2011, we
also opened our third Fast Fit+ branch, which
offers vehicle servicing, at our existing
bodyshop site in Redruth, Cornwall.   
The mobile service which we re-launched in
2010 has continued to perform strongly and
revenues grew 57% during 2011 to £7.5
million (2010: £4.8 million). Our mobile
offering is attractive to fleet and retail
customers, where speed and convenience 
are paramount, but also to our core 
insurance customers.
The Board
After the year end, at the start of March
2012, Nationwide announced that it had
appointed David Pugh as Finance Director with
effect from 10 April 2012.  He succeeds David
Loftus, who is stepping down from the Board
and the Company on 10 April. I would like to
reiterate the Board’s thanks to David Loftus for
his hard work and contribution to the Group
over the last nine years and welcome David
Pugh to the team.
Outlook
In a tough year for the industry, Nationwide
has performed robustly and the decisive action
we took in the second half to reduce the cost
base was the correct response to position
Nationwide appropriately for the future. At
the same time, we are continuing to invest for
long-term growth both in our core insurance
market as well as our newer fleet and retail
markets. The overall market for repairs (both
insurance-funded and fleet and retail) remains
substantial and Nationwide has the
infrastructure in place to build market share
across all three sectors. 
In addition, the Group has a strong balance
sheet with net cash of £8.0 million and good
cash generation.
Therefore, while we expect trading to remain
challenging in 2012, we believe that the
medium and long-term prospects of the
Group are positive.

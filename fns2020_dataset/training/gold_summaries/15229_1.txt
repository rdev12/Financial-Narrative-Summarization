Market overview
Synchronica believes that the mobile 
phone is becoming the preferred device 
for consumers in emerging markets 
to access Internet content and services. 
It is widely documented that in many

continue to experience massive

rapid increase of mobile data usage 
as mobile phones are contributing to 
the economic growth in these regions.

world is hungry for access to the online 
applications we take for granted – 
em ai l,	in s t ant 	me s s agin g	and	soc i al

the mobile device has the opportunity 
to become the primary device for 
accessing these next-generation

Synchronica signed a record 13 new

throughout 2009 – predominantly 
in	the	emer gin g	m ark ets 	of 	Afric a,

While in 2009 Synchronica received 
revenue from these customers for initial 
lic en se	r equir ements,	w e	e xpect 	t o	
receive further revenue as their user base 
grows and they place expansion orders.

every reason to believe that we will 
see substantial expansion orders 
from these operators within the next 
12-18 months.
The impact expansion orders have 
on revenue contribution has already 
been	demon s tr at ed.	In	Apri l 	2009,

orders with a combined value of 
us$645,000,	fr om	one	of 	the	l ar g e s t 	
mobile operators in Russia and the CIS. 
It is reasonable to expect subsequent 
expansion orders from our customers 
as they commercialise their service 
and the user base exceeds the initial 
license orders. Synchronica will also 
receive recurring revenues from 
customers in the form of hosting 
f ee s 	(wher e	ho s tin g	i s 	pr o v ided),	
annual support and maintenance

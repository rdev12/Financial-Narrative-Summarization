 02 Reuters Group PLC Annual Report and Form 20-F 2005
First year of revenue growth (up 3%) since 2001
Our 2005 revenue was £2,409 million, a 3% increase over 2004. 2005
was the first full year of revenue growth since 2001, mainly driven by
growth in recurring revenues, as a result of acquisitions made during
the year.
Recurring revenue
2
of £2,242 million (up 4%) was driven by the
acquisition of Moneyline Telerate (Telerate) and price increases.
Usage revenue
2
of £97 million (up 13%) reflected a good performance
in transaction services and higher reuters.com advertising revenue.
Outright revenue
2
was £70 million (down 22%) with the fall principally
explained by our continued withdrawal from technology consulting.
Operating profit up £13 million, trading profit
1
up £8 million
Operating profit was £207 million in 2005, up £13 million on the
previous year, principally explained by an increase in trading profit.
Trading profit of £334 million (trading margin 14%) was up £8 million
over 2004. A strong revenue performance combined with continuing
tight cost control was sufficient to fund our Core Plus transformation
and growth investments of £41 million and a £7 million charge relating
to an accounting change in the Reuters Pension Fund (RPF), to a
defined benefit plan.
Within trading profit, the three year Fast Forward restructuring
programme delivered additional savings of £126 million, bringing 
the cumulative total from the programme to £360 million.
Profit for the year up £107 million
Our 2005 profit was £482 million, an increase of £107 million over 
the previous year, principally explained by the increase in profit from
discontinued operations and profit on asset sales.
Profit from discontinued operations, which is where Instinet Group 
is reported as the disposal of a major business line, was £253 million.
This largely represents profit realised from our disposal of Instinet
Group (£191 million) and profit from Instinet Group in the eleven
months prior to its sale (£68 million).
Profit from other asset disposals totalled £38 million, largely from
further sales of our remaining stake in Tibco Software Inc. (TSI).
EPS up 6.6p to 32.6p and adjusted EPS
1
up 2.0p to 13.8p
EPS was 32.6p in 2005, up 6.6p from the previous year, mainly due 
to the increase in profit for the year.
Adjusted EPS was 13.8p in 2005, up 2.0p from the previous year,
reflecting stronger trading profit and a reduction in the number 
of shares in circulation due to the share buyback programme.
Dividend of 10p per share
A final dividend of 6.15p is proposed, which will bring the total
dividend to 10p per share, the same level as the previous year.
Net assets stand at £570 million
Net assets stand at £570 million, the same level as at 31 December
2004. The profit for the year was offset by the return of equity to
shareholders and the removal of minority interest equity, due to 
the sale of Instinet Group.
Net funds
1
were £253 million, down £73 million from the previous year.
During 2005, £363 million of cash was returned to shareholders via
dividend payments and as a result of the share buyback programme
to return £1 billion to shareholders by July 2007. 
Notes:
1 A number of measures are ‘non-GAAP’ figures, which are business performance measures
used to manage the business, and which supplement the IFRS-based headline numbers.
These include ‘trading profit’, ‘adjusted EPS’ and ‘net debt/net funds’. The rationale for using
non-GAAP indicators and their reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS indicator is
provided in sections 19 and 20 on pages 25 to 30.
2 See note 2 of the Financial Statements on page 59 for definitions of the terms ‘recurring’,
‘usage’ and ‘outright’ revenue.

 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Principal Activities 
I am pleased to report that in 2013 the Group traded 
br oadl y	in	line	 with	expectations.	 Gr oup	r ev enue	 for	 the	
y ear	 was	£18,095,000	(2012:	£20,071,000)	and	pr ofit	
befor e	 tax	 was	£1,269,000	(2012:	£1,302,000).
Basic earnings per share benefited from a Corporation Tax 
credit of £120,000 and increased for a fifth successive year 
to 4.38p (2012: 3.50p). The Board recommends that the final 
dividend be maintained at 0.4p per share (2012: 0.4p).
Overall performance in our Education market continues 
to be strong. A solid performance in the UK saw UK 
Education revenue increase by 1.37% to £10,570,000 (2012: 
£10,427,000), and international education revenue grew by 
20.8% to £4,880,000 (2012: £4,039,000).
As expected, non-Education revenue decreased to 
£2,645,000 (2012: £5,605,000). This is because the 2012 
revenue included a number of infrequently occurring  
census and elections projects, the largest of which, with 
a revenue of £2,471,000, was for the electronic counting 
of the 2012 London Mayor and Assembly Elections. As 
expected there were fewer high value contracts in 2013. 
The largest non-Education project during the year was 
the census forms printing and data scanning solution for 
Myanmar, approximately 78% of which was delivered in 
2013. Adjusting for the significant 2012 London Mayor 
and Assembly Elections contract, like-for-like total Group 
revenue was up 2.8% on last year.
2013 was an important year for DRS, with the Group 
demonstrating tangible progress in the execution of its 
strategy. A key goal was to establish ourselves in the 
overseas electronic marking market, which was achieved. 
The signing of key partnerships for the distribution of the 
DRS electronic marking software solution (e-Marker®) to the 
Indian and African education markets and the completion 
of several e-Marker® pilot projects in these regions laid 
important foundations for increasing international growth. 
This strategic progress was reflected in the growth we 
saw in our overseas education market revenue for the fifth 
successive year.
In August 2013 a key milestone was achieved for the Group’s 
core UK business when we agreed a two-year extension, to 
September 2016, of the agreement with AQA Education for 
the provision of e-Marker® Examination Services. 
In the non-Education market, we signed a Long Term 
Agreement with the United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA) in June 2013 which provides a framework for future 
contracts to be awarded for international census projects. 
We also successfully concluded the first sale under that 
agreement for the provision of forms and a data scanning 
solution for the Myanmar census to be held in 2014. The 
initial deliveries were made in 2013 and we expect to 
complete the contract in 2014.
C orporate	R esponsibility
The Board is focused on the adoption of responsible 
practices across the organisation through a process of 
continual improvement in the use of resources, the  
wellbeing and diversity of our employees, compliance with 
local laws and appropriate international standards and the 
requirements laid out in our Code of Business Ethics.

 STRATEGIC REPORT
Sir David Brown
Chairman Governance
As a publicly listed company, we strive to adopt best 
practice standards for corporate governance. During  
the year the Board has attended to the changing  
regulations for corporate reporting, and this Annual Report 
includes additional disclosures on strategy, in the form of 
a Strategic Report, and remuneration, in the form of an 
extended Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The Board continues to take seriously its responsibility 
for managing risk, so as to ensure that we meet the high 
standards of trust and reliability expected of us when 
handling large volumes of sensitive data for our customers. 
Risk is at the core of our focus as we continue to develop and 
maintain systems to ensure that our people are safe, that 
our assets are safe, that our reputation is protected and that 
we are delivering an impeccable service to our customers   
and partners.
The Group continues to maintain its certification in the key 
areas of Business Continuity (BS 25999-2:2007), Quality 
Management (ISO 9001), Environmental Management (ISO 
14001) and Information Security Management (ISO 27001), 
which the Board regards as important evidence of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s focus on compliance with best 
practice risk management standards.
No changes were made to the Board of Directors in          
2013 and, at the time of writing, none are foreseeable in       
the year ahead.
Outlook
DRS has had a good year, delivering a solid operational 
performance and achieving its cornerstone strategic goals. 
Looking forward, while we continue to see some risk from 
volume reductions in the UK in the medium term as a result of 
the anticipated structural changes to academic qualifications 
in the UK secondary education market, the international 
opportunities over the same period are expected both to 
balance these and to provide opportunities for growth.
The objective of the Group continues to be to maintain its 
position in the UK market and at the same time to seize 
opportunities for geographical diversification in selected 
markets overseas, with a particular focus on those markets 
in which the Group believes that long-term scalable growth 
of its core examination processing solutions, including 
e-Marker®, can realistically be secured.
In March 2014 we were delighted to be able to announce 
that DRS and its joint arrangement partner in IntElect®, 
Electoral Reform Services Limited, have been selected to 
provide electronic counting for the 2016 London Mayor and 
Assembly Elections, as we did in 2012.
DRS expects to continue to deliver other high value 
projects in the Elections and Census space, including further 
opportunities under the UNFPA Long Term Agreement. These 
are by their nature not annually recurring opportunities, 
with each opportunity needing individually to be won in a 
strongly competitive environment. However they tend to be 
of a high value and are integral to the Group’s business focus.

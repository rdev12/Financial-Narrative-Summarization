Inmarsat was founded on the vision of seamless, 
reliable, globally available communications. 
This focus remains at the heart of our business 
and today with the successful introduction of our 
fastest and most powerful high-speed broadband 
service – Global Xpress – we remain at the 
forefront of global connectivity. Our services 
reach across every continent and every ocean, 
ensuring that wherever our customers are located 
– on land, at sea and in the air – they can be 
assured that Inmarsat is ready and available to

For all our customers, reliable connectivity – 
from voice services to high-speed broadband – 
is a crucial enabler. We continually invest in our 
networks and work with a unique community of 
partners to deliver a suite of solutions that are 
specific to each sector. Through this strategy, 
we provide an environment in which ship operators 
can deploy advanced technologies to improve 
efficiency; we bring new opportunities for airlines 
to augment cockpit communications and deliver 
a new era in passenger services. And, across our 
other core sectors, we are delivering globally 
available services tailored to make a real difference.

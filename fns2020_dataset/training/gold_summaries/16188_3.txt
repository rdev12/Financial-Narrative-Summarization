Following completion of the merger with 
TUI AG and as stated in the prospectus, 
we understand the Directors of the combined 
group intend to adopt a dividend policy in line 
with TUI Travel’s present progressive dividend 
policy under which dividends grow broadly in 
line with earnings. TUI Travel shareholders 
(including TUI AG) will receive a second interim 
dividend of 20.5 pence per TUI Travel share, 
to include 10.5 pence per TUI Travel share 
in lieu of a final dividend (2013: 9.75p) for 
the financial year 2013/14. At the time of 
our interim results, the Board proposed an 
increase of 8% to 4.05p (2013: 3.75p), leading 
to a full year dividend of 24.55p (2013: 13.5p). 
Provided the performance of the combined 
group develops in line with expectations, 
the combined group will target an increase in 
its dividend per share for the financial years 
2014/15 and 2015/16 of 10% in excess of the 
growth in the underlying earnings per share 
growth for the combined group.

Our sustainability performance has been 
recognised through many achievements this 
year, including joint first place in the FTSE 350 
with a ‘perfect 100’ score for climate change 
reporting and transparency (Carbon Disclosure 
Project). We have made significant progress in 
the final year of our Sustainable Holidays 
Plan – our three-year sustainability strategy 
which aligns with our corporate strategy and 
strategic drivers. Our airlines are Europe’s 
most carbon efficient. In FY14, TUI Travel 
airline's CO
2
 per revenue passenger kilometre 
was 69.9g – an improvement of 10.3% over 
the last six years. We also exceeded our 
goal to deliver 10 million greener and fairer 
holidays over three years, by taking over 
11.5 million customers to hotels with credible 
sustainability certifications.
Sustainability is a priority for our business 
and our industry – we have experienced 
a range of business benefits, including cost 
efficiencies, quality improvements and 
the enhanced engagement of customers, 
colleagues and suppliers. We aim to continue 
to lead the industry by making real changes 
at scale.

The TUI Travel and TUI AG merger that 
was agreed by an overwhelming majority 
of shareholders on 28 October 2014 is 
a fantastic result for both businesses. 
The combined group will achieve further 
sustainable growth at a faster rate, 
delivering more value to both shareholders 
and customers. I am very excited about the 
opportunities we have for the future. 
The travel and tourism industry remains 
a growing one. International arrivals increased 
by 5% in 2013 to 1,087 million and are expected 
to increase by 3.3% a year to reach 1.8 billion 
by 2030*. We are therefore well positioned as 
market leader in the leisure sector to take full 
advantage of this growth industry.
Resu l ts
Our strong financial performance is driven 
by our strategy. We know what our customers 
want and we continue to deliver unique 
holiday experiences sold directly to them, 
increasingly online. Our success is testament 
to the continuing commitment to put the 
customer first in everything we do. This year 
we maintained record customer satisfaction 
levels of 79% across our key Mainstream 
Source Markets. 
Our unique holidays now account for 71% of 
all Mainstream holidays, up three percentage 
points on the prior year (2013: 68%**). The 
growth in this key strategic area reflects 
the demand our customers have for our 
unique holidays.

Q2 
Samsung selected Dialog’s power management and audio 
technology for a second smartphone platform – the  
Galaxy Pocket S5300 – and our audio technology for its ultra 
compact Pebble MP3 accessory that syncs with the Galaxy SIII 
smartphone to enable runners and sportspeople to enjoy music  
on the move. 
SmartPulse™ DECT ULE (Ultra Low Energy) was adopted by a 
European plug manufacturer for internet-enabled smart plugs, 
enabling home appliances to be controlled from a smartphone 
or tablet.

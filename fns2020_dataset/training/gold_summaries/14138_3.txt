 SHAFT SINKERS REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2010

Chairman’s Statement
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
I AM DELIGHTED TO REPORT A 
STRONG PERFORMANCE BY THE 
GROUP IN 2010 WITH SIGNIFICANT 
FINANCIAL, STRATEGIC AND 
OPERATIONAL PROGRESS.  
UNFORTUNATELY, JUXTAPOSED 
AGAINST THIS ARE THE SAD EVENTS 
MARKED BY THE DEATH OF OUR 
EMPLOYEES, MR. MOJALEFA LEKORO 
AND MR. SANSAO MACAMO. THEIR 
LOSS IS A STARK REMINDER OF 
THE DANGERS INHERENT IN OUR 
BUSINESS AND HAVING COME AFTER 
ACHIEVING 3 MILLION FATALITY 
FREE SHIFTS IN SOUTH AFRICA. WE 
REMEMBER THESE TWO  
EMPLOYEES AND WILL CONTINUE 
TO REINFORCE THE IMPORTANCE 
OF OUR OPERATIONAL SAFETY 
PROCEDURES AS WELL AS TO STRIVE 
FOR ZERO FATALITIES.
Financial results
Revenue for the year grew 24% to GBP183.1 
million (2009:  GBP147.9 million).  Proﬁt before 
Income Tax grew 34% to GBP16.7 million (2009:  
GBP12.5 million) and basic Earnings per Share 
grew 27% to 30p (2009:  24p).  The results are 
stated after including a GBP3.8 million contract 
recovery against an earlier impairment and one-
off income less charges of GBP0.7 million.
The Group ended the year in a strong ﬁnancial position 
with net Cash and Cash Equivalents of GBP11.1 million 
(2009: net borrowings of GBP6.6 million).
Dividends
In line with the dividend policy set out in our 
Listing Prospectus, the Board is not proposing a 
ﬁnal dividend for 2010.  We continue to expect, 
in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, to 
commence payment of dividends later this year.
Strategy
Admission of our shares to trading on the London 
Stock Exchange Main List at the end of 2010 
was a major step forward in positioning us to 
achieve our strategic objectives. I would like to 
congratulate management on their hard work in 
achieving this milestone.
Our strategy remains as set out in our Prospectus.  
We intend to maintain and build on our existing 
strategic and technical strengths, to expand 
further into the CIS and India and to diversify our 
offering into additional end-market applications.  
We will also remain alert to selective acquisition 
opportunities with the potential to add value to 
our operations.
Management has done well to secure a new tender 
in Styldrift. We are pleased to have expanded 
our client base  with the Styldrift Joint Venture 
as it indirectly exposes us to two more clients 
in Anglo Platinum and Royal Bafokeng Nation. 
Whilst Management has encountered technical  5
difﬁculties on some of the projects such as Impala 
16, Management is redoubling its efforts and 
there are improvements.  Eurochem, our largest 
single contract, is slowly starting to catch up with 
early delays. A combination of technical and 
administrative issues was, and continuously is, 
being proactively addressed by the management 
which culminated in some good progress and 
recommencement of the sinking process. 
We have sold our stake in the Eureka gold mine 
in Zimbabwe and with that ends a chapter in the 
company  owning equity in projects. This strategy 
has not worked and, in fact, was creating drag 
in terms of management time and effort; so I 
welcome this divestment. 
I would like to congratulate Alon Davidov on 
his appointment as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. 
Alon is well placed to spearhead Shaft Sinkers’ 
expansion into new territories; in particular the 
former Soviet Union with which he is very familiar. 
I would also like to thank the other executive 
colleagues for their efforts. Rob Schroder, Chief 
Operating Ofﬁcer has worked hard to improve 
the safety, operations and service delivery across 
the business. Chris Hall, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, 
has been instrumental in improving the ﬁnancial 
strength of the company and ultimately readying 
the Group for listing.
I would like to welcome Messrs Stephen Oke, 
Ian Watson and Roger Williams to our board as 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. Stephen 
Oke is the Senior Independent Non-executive 
Director and will chair the Remuneration 
Committee. Stephen serves on several listed 
company boards in the mining industry and I look 
forward to working closely with him.  Ian Watson, 
who is himself a shaft sinker, will make a valuable 
contribution as Chairman of our Safety Committee, 
and Roger Williams will bring his considerable 
experience in executive ﬁnancial roles to bear as 
Chairman of our Audit Committee.
Outlook
In 2010 we saw a signiﬁcant upturn in the mining 
industry across the globe. Gold has reached new 
record highs, whilst platinum has surged. Base 
metals prices have also performed well, giving 
encouragement to the sometimes deceptive 
global recovery. 
With a record year end committed order book 
and the potential to win further new contract 
awards both in South Africa and elsewhere, 
the Directors believe that Shaft Sinkers is well 
positioned to capitalise fully on the coming 
recovery.  We have established a solid footing 
for 2011 and are performing in line with 
expectations. We remain conﬁdent of the Group’s 
prospects both for 2011 and beyond.
Finally I would like to welcome all our 
stakeholders to the Shaft Sinkers family. We are a 
South African mining institution having turned 50 
years old this year. In today’s instantaneous world, 
this is a rare milestone which speaks volumes. 
Shaft Sinkers has successfully developed into a 
world leader in its ﬁeld and now has the platform 
and the resources to grow internationally and 
achieve its full potential. So, welcome to the Shaft 
Sinkers family.

Admission to Johannesburg Stock Exchange
On 5 December 2014, the Company 
completed a dual listing on the AltX of the 
JSE and was the first ever Company to do 
so under the newly introduced fast track 
listing process.
The JSE listing further diversifies the 
Company’s shareholder base, providing 
existing and new South African investors 
with an opportunity to participate in 
the Company’s income and value 
generation potential.

  On behalf of the Board I am delighted to confirm the 
Company is now listed on the JSE and is the first to have 
been fast tracked through the listing process. South African 
investors now represent nearly half of our investor base and 
we feel that Sirius is truly dual listed.

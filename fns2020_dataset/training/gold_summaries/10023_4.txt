STATEMENTS
1
 Onshore Italy
Gas exploration,  
development and production
•  Geographically spread low risk 
production and exploration 
opportunities
•  Returns on assets to cover operating 
costs for the Group
2
 Northern Adriatic
Guendalina gas production
•  Non-operated gas production 
providing ~75% of revenues
•  Asset delivers net cash flow for small 
capital projects
Northern Adriatic gas exploration and 
development
•  Non-operated gas discoveries with 
upside potential
•  Goal is to increase the priority of 
these developments in the overall 
portfolio of ENI

Val D’Agri (one of the largest onshore 
fields in Western Europe) and Tempa 
Rossa fields.
•  Technically challenging exploration 
well that is currently waiting for EIA 
approval of the well proposal

 Malta
Malta oil and gas exploration
•  Frontier exploration which is 
unproven in Malta
•  Prospect size and presence of 
hydrocarbons are key risks, which are 
being mitigated with the 3D seismic 
and basin modelling
•  Evaluation in progress with results 
expected early in the 3rd Quarter  
of 2012

 France
France gas exploration
•  Triassic Bunter Sandstone play 
analogous to North Sea southern 
Gas Basin, but unproven in southern 
France.

charge are the key risks. 2012 plan is 
to acquire 400km of 2D seismic over 
the prospect

 04 Group overview
Mike Welton
Chairman, Hanson PLC
Hanson’s primary objective is to create
sustainable, long-term value for our
shareholders. In the ten years to December
31, 2006, our total shareholder return
(“TSR”) was 316%, ranking us in the top 25
companies in the FTSE 100. This means an
investment of £100 in Hanson on January
1,1997 was worth £416 at the end of
2006. As we mark our tenth anniversary, 
we are delighted with the value we have
created in the last ten years.
Our strategy 
Our strategy remains straightforward. 
We will continue to focus on heavy building
materials in selected markets. Our product
range and location of operations provides
us with end use and geographic
diversiﬁcation through the construction
cycles. Within each local market, we aim 
to develop a strong network of operations
from which to supply our customers. 
We are driven and incentivised to increase
the economic value of the group through
margin management and capital investment.
We have a good track record of adding
value through acquisitions and remain
committed to a targeted acquisition
programme. Financial discipline is a key
strength which we will seek to maintain.
2006 highlights 
The operating performance in 2006
highlights the fundamental strengths of 
our business. Our business seeks to deliver
value over the long term by leveraging 
our asset positions, including 17 .8 billion
metric tonnes of mineral reserves and
resources, alongside pricing discipline 
and cost control. 
Investments in 2006 were signiﬁcant. 
First, the acquisitions we completed are
intended to provide an excellent strategic 
ﬁt, extending our product range whilst
expanding and strengthening our operations.
Secondly, the increase in our capital
investment programme takes advantage 
of productivity improvement opportunities,
which we believe will deliver signiﬁcant
value in the medium term. 
Returns to shareholders
Total shareholder return in 2006 was 24%,
compared to 13% for the FTSE100. We 
are conﬁdent in our ability to increase the 
long-term value of the business and hence
propose a ﬁnal dividend of 15.35p per
share for 2006. This would result in a total
dividend declared for 2006 of 21.8p, an
increase of 9% compared to 2005. During
2006, we continued our share buyback
programme, repurchasing 9.96 million
shares for £64.1m. 
Board of Directors 
The Board has a strong balance of skills
and experiences. During the year, Jonathan
Nicholls left and we thank him for his
contribution to the development of the
Group during his tenure at Hanson. 
We are pleased that Pavi Binning joined 
as his successor as Finance Director. 
He brings with him a wealth of experience,
having been Chief Financial Ofﬁcer at telent
plc, formerly Marconi Corporation PLC, 
and I am sure that he will make a positive
contribution to Hanson. 
Corporate governance 
We remain committed to exercising high
standards of corporate governance with
open and transparent reporting. Our Annual
Report incorporates a review of the group’s
activities during the year, including ﬁnancial
performance, key performance indicators
and a description of principal risks and
uncertainties facing the group. We also
remain compliant with Section 404 
of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act as 
well as with the Combined Code. 
Corporate responsibility 
Health and safety in the workplace and
respect for our communities is of prime
February 24, 2007
marks our ten year
anniversary since we
completed the last
demerger. Since then,
we have grown to
become a world
leader in heavy
building materials and
we continue to deliver
shareholder value.

importance. In 2006, the Board formally
endorsed its approach to health and safety
with a group policy statement. We also take
our environmental responsibilities seriously.
Our key areas of focus are to increase our
resource and energy efﬁciency, reduce 
CO

emissions, manage our land holdings
to provide habitats for wildlife and be a
responsible neighbour. Addressing
sustainability also provides opportunities 
for new products and services, which we
develop through innovation, partnerships
and acquisitions. 
Our people
We have 25,900* people worldwide who
have made Hanson a world leader through
hard work and determination to succeed. 
I would like to thank them for their dedication
and commitment. Investment in our people
remains paramount. We will continue to
shape and develop our own talent by
providing career development opportunities. 
Outlook
We believe our strategy is delivering
shareholder value. Our physical assets,
including our mineral reserves, our people
and our track record give us conﬁdence 
for the future.

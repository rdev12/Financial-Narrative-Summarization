Government’s intended audience. 
Nevertheless there remains a significant 
imbalance between supply and demand 
for housing stock in the South East and 
Government and Local Authority policies 
will remain important in helping to bring 
these forces into a better sense of balance.
Outlook
The positive market trends which 
began in 2013 have continued into 2014. 
In January 2014, total income for the Group 
of £50.1 million was the highest ever level 
recorded for the month of January, and 
furthermore profitability was at the highest 
level since January 2007. With more lenders 
now supporting Help to Buy, macro-economic 
indicators forecasting growth in the UK 
economy and consumer confidence indices 
improving, we fully expect the UK housing 
recovery to continue and anticipate that 
we can deliver the highest ever levels of 
Group profitability in 2014.
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank everyone across the Group for their 
commitment and passion during a year that, 
whilst being undoubtedly challenging, marks 
a major step in the transformation of the Group.

Interim Chairman

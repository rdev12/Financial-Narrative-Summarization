 04 Synchronica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
CHAIRmAN’S STATEmENT
Synchronica continues to make great 
strategic and commercial progress as we 
focus our efforts on becoming the leading 
provider of push mobile email solutions 
for mobile operators in emerging markets. 
Key to this progress is the enhancement 
of our distribution network. 
During 2009 we successfully secured 
global reseller agreements with 
Brights t ar ,	nok i a	 siemen s 	netw ork s,	
and a large Asian-based network 
equipment vendor. This has resulted 
in us being able to substantially enlarge 
our	c u s t omer	f ootprint,	and	w elc ome	
new customers from our target markets 
of 	the	Mid dl e	e a s t 	and	Afric a,	e a s t ern	
e ur ope,	As i a	and	Latin	Americ a.	Our	
distribution partnerships provide 
Synchronica with global reach and 
local presence in all the high growth 
m ark ets 	and	w e	r em ain	c onfident 	th at 	
our focus on distribution will continue 
to bear fruit. 
Financial results
We increased revenue slightly on last 
year at £3.83m (2008: £3.71m). The 
consensus broker expectation had been 
for higher revenues in 2009 and in the 
latter part of 2009 and into 2010 we 
believed that this had been achieved.

of that customer being involved in 
ac qui s ition	di s c u s s ion s,	the	r el ev ant 	
counter-signatures and purchase orders 
relating to the delivery of mobile Gateway 
in 2009 would not be received in time 
for us to recognise the revenue in 2009. 
We gave the appropriate guidance to 
the	m ark et,	and	h av e	in	the	me antime	
successfully restarted discussions with 
the customer aiming to conclude this 
contract soon after the acquisition 
is completed.

We derive our revenue from a relatively 
sm al l 	 number 	 of 	 di s c r et e 	 lic en s in g 	 de al s,	
the frequency and timing of which is often 
diffic u lt 	t o	pr edict .	In	r ec ent 	 y e ar s 	our	
revenue has been heavily weighted 
towards the second half. 
With the level of interest shown in our 
pr oduct 	bein g	at 	an	al l 	time	high,	our	
sales pipeline has never been stronger. 
Ho w ev er , 	 w e 	 ar e 	 r eli ant 	 upon 	 a 	 s t e a dy 	
and sustained conversion of these 
prospects into revenue and cash.

the Group’s needs the Group has 
successfully sought and received 
the support of its shareholders. 
Each fundraising requires engagement 
with the Group’s shareholders and 
therefore we will need to undertake 
this discussion if and when the need 
arises. In this context please also see

He is also recognised for his long and 
successful position as chairman of 
Sage plc. We welcome the experience 
which michael brings to Synchronica 
from the technology and smaller 
company arena.

Januar y 	2008,	c ho se	t o	l e av e	the	
Synchronica Board. We would like 
to thank Robert for his contribution 
to Synchronica during this critical 
phase of the Group’s development.
A key asset of the Company is our 
t e am.	Onc e	ag ain,	 s y nc hr onic a’s

without the hard work and total 
dedication of our management team

Post year-end events
On 	 the 	 31 	 M ar c h 	 2010, 	 s y nc hr onic a 	 p lc	
announced the acquisition of the 
ImPS instant messaging business of 
C o libri a	As,	a	l e a din g	mo b i l e	in s t ant 	
messaging company. Synchronica has 
acquired Colibria’s ImPS technology 
and 13 contracts with mobile operators. 
We expect that the acquisition will 
accelerate our entry in to the instant 
me s s agin g 	 m ark et, 	 and 	 th at 	 it 	 w i l l 	 al so	
boost the demand for Synchronica mobile 
Gateway among those customers 
which use Colibria’s technology.
At the same time we announced a placing 
t o	r ai se	£4.8m	gr o s s,	£2.8m	in	c a sh	
and an equity swap placing providing 
the Company with further funding of 
approximately £2.0m over the next 
24	months.	 The	f u nd s 	h av e	been	u sed	
in part to satisfy the cash consideration 
element of the acquisition and will be 
used to provide the enlarged Company 
with further working capital for further 
development and roll-out of mobile

Trading update
Thanks to the Company’s reseller network 
and	the	M e s s ag ePhone™,	2010	h a s 	
started positively building the sales 
pipeline to a higher level than ever 
bef or e. 	 Ho w ev er , 	 t o 	 d at e 	 the 	 c on v er s ion	
of this pipeline to revenue has been 
slower than expected. The Directors 
believ e 	 th at 	 the 	 s al e s 	 pipeline 	 i s 	 s uffic ient	
t o 	 meet 	 m ark et 	 e xpect ation s 	 f or 	 the 	 y e ar ,	
provided there is an accelerated rate of 
conversion to revenue in the remainder of 
the 	 y e ar . 	 In 	 pr ev iou s 	 y e ar s, 	 s y nc hr onic a’s	
revenue has been heavily weighted 
towards the second half. The slower 
conversion of the sales pipeline has 
led to a lower than expected level of 
c a sh 	 g ener ation, 	 ho w ev er , 	 the 	 Dir ect or s	
believ e	th at 	the	C omp an y 	h a s 	s uffic ient 	
funds to meet its present requirements. 
We are encouraged that the conversion 
rate is accelerating by the signing of 
three uS $1m plus deals in June 2010.

CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S STATEmENT
nicK sALmOn
t he Group’s performance improved very significantly 
in 2010. this is the result of the actions taken to 
radically restructure in late 2008 and the first half of 
2009, coupled with the continued market penetration 
of newly-developed products and the further 
expansion of our presence in emerging markets, 
which positioned our businesses favourably to benefit 
from the continued recovery in our end-markets. We 
see considerable potential for further improvement 
and in January 2011 we announced new three-year 
performance targets, setting out our ambitions and 
strategy for further strong progress.
TRADING PERFORmANCE
Group revenue of £2,546m was 30% higher than 2009 
as reported, and 23% higher on an underlying basis, 
that is to say at constant currency and eliminating 
the impact of passing through significantly higher 
commodity metals prices (tin, silver and gold). t rading 
profit of £252.1m was £140.4m (126%) higher than 
that reported for 2009 and the return on sales margin 
improved strongly to 9.9% (2009: 5.7%). the Group’s 
end-markets have continued to recover from the 
impact of the global economic crisis but generally 
remain below the levels experienced in the first half of 
2008 prior to the crisis. 
t he ceramics division’s revenue of £1,495m was 32% 
higher than that reported in 2009 and up 27% on an 
underlying basis. the global steel production end-
market accounts for almost 60% of the division’s 
revenue. According to the World steel Association, 
global steel production in 2010 was 15% higher than 
in 2009 and, excluding china, the rest of the world 
showed an increase of 20%. t he division’s steel-related 
businesses, steel Flow control and Linings, reported 
revenue for the year of, respectively, £494m and 
£486m, underlying increases of 32% and 19% on the 
prior year and approaching 2008 levels, indicating 
continued market share gains. the recovery in the 
division’s other main end-market, foundry castings, 
gained momentum through the year. Accordingly, 
the Foundry product line’s revenue of £440m was up 
33% on 2009 but was still some 17% below 2008 on an 
underlying basis. Lastly, the Fused silica product line’s 
revenue of £75m was up an underlying 29% on prior 
year, reflecting the strong recovery in the photovoltaic 
wafer production end-market. in total, the division’s 
trading profit of £177.4m was £106.5m (150%) higher 
than the prior year, and the return on sales margin was 
11.9% (2009: 6.3%).
the electronics division’s revenue of £721m was 36% 
higher than 2009, as reported. in part, this increase was 
due to the pass through of higher tin and silver commodity 
prices in our solder product sales and higher gold prices 
in our plating chemicals sales, which had the effect of 
increasing revenue by about £84m compared with the 
prior year when commodity prices were considerably 
lower. On an underlying basis, revenue increased by 18%, 
reflecting the continued strong recovery in electronics 
end-markets, particularly in the high-end consumer 
segment, and continuing market penetration of new, 
higher margin, products. the division’s trading profit of 
£71.0m was £31.8m (81%) higher than the prior year and 
the return on sales margin was 9.8% (2009: 7.4%). the 
effect on revenue of passing through higher commodity 
metals prices than those prevailing in 2009 reduced the 
reported margin by about 1.3 percentage points.
the precious metals division’s net sales value (being 
revenue excluding the precious metals content) of 
£134m was broadly unchanged from the prior year. 
Weak retail markets continued to be offset by strong 
levels of reclaim business in europe and gold and 
silver coin blank sales to the us m int. trading profit of 
£12.7m was £3.8m (43%) higher than the prior year, 
reflecting the full year benefits of the restructuring 
completed in the first half of 2009 and improved sales 
mix with higher levels of reclaim and coins.
ExCEPTIONAL ITEmS
A net charge, pre-tax, of £32.7m was incurred, principally 
due to restructuring charges (£17.3m) and amortisation 
of intangible assets (£17.7m), partially offset by a gain 
relating to the closure of the uK defined benefit pension 
plan to future benefit accrual (£4.7m). the equivalent 
charge in 2009 was £96.6m, reflecting the major cost 
reduction/restructuring programme implemented in 
the face of the economic crisis.
TAxATION
the headline effective tax rate for 2010 was 21.1%, a 
significant improvement on the 2009 rate of 35.2%. 
t his improvement reflects the return to a more normal 
geographic distribution of profitability, combined 
with the benefit of a number of non-recurring credits 
recognised in the year. these credits related to the 
recognition of some previously unrecorded tax losses 
combined with a number of adjustments arising from 
the finalisation of prior year tax liabilities. t he underlying 
tax rate for 2010, excluding the benefit of these non-
recurring credits, was around 24%. An underlying tax 
rate of between 23% and 24% is anticipated for 2011 
and 2012.

we announced new three-year performance targets, setting out our ambitions 
and strategy for further strong progress.”

ATTRIBUTABLE PROFITS AND EARNINGS
Headline attributable profit was £169.8m (2009: 
£45.6m) and headline earnings per share was 61.5p 
(2009: 18.0p).
After taking into account all exceptional items, the 
Group recorded a profit for the year of £145.3m 
compared with a loss of £48.5m for 2009.
FINANCIAL POSITION
net debt at 31 December 2010 was £330m, £41m lower 
than a year earlier. t he Group has very substantial liquidity 
headroom within its committed debt facilities which total 
£855m. in December 2010, we successfully completed the 
issue of $250m of us p rivate placement loan notes with an 
average fixed interest rate of 4.6% and average duration of 
just under nine years. the principal maturities under the 
existing bank facility are in late 2012 and our intention is 
to refinance this facility by the end of 2011.
At 31 December 2010, the ratio of net debt to eBitDA  
was 1.1 times, very comfortably within the debt 
covenant level of 3.0 times and the interest cover ratio 
was 13.8 times.
OUTLOOK FOR 2011
For 2011, based on a number of third party forecasts, 
we are expecting global steel production growth to 
be at mid-single digit levels, slightly higher growth 
in electronic equipment production and double digit 
growth rates in our foundry castings and fused silica 
end-markets. t he significant cost reduction measures 
implemented in the first half of 2009, the continuing 
market penetration of new, higher margin products, 
and the production capacity expansion projects 
completed in 2010 and currently under way, mean 
that the Group is well positioned to benefit from these 
positive end-market growth trends. 
Accordingly, we continue to expect that the Group’s 
performance in 2011 will be well ahead of 2010. 
TARGETS AND STRATEGY
On 26 January 2011, we gave an extensive capital markets presentation setting out our targets for 
performance improvement over the coming three years and our strategy for achieving those targets. t he 
full presentation is available on our website. t he targets are:
	 average annual revenue growth to exceed 1.5 times global GDp growth;
	 return on sales margin of 12% by year 2013;
	 double digit average annual headline earnings growth;
	 dividend growth at least in line with earnings growth;
	 return on investment increasingly ahead of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital; and
	 maintaining a strong financial position with a leverage ratio (year-end net debt to eBitDA ratio) of not 
more than 1.5 times.
in setting these targets we are not assuming any significant acquisitions, but some bolt-on acquisitions are 
possible. Also, no major disposals are anticipated but any opportunities to create value will be considered 
objectively.
We see the achievement of these targets being underpinned by:
	 leading global market positions, supplying consumables to essential industries — steel, foundry and 
electronics;
	 track record of market share gains with new, enhanced technology, higher margin products — increased 
R&D capability and spending;
	 significant emerging market exposure (c.50% of revenue; >60% of trading profit);
	 considerable further recovery potential in mature markets where cost base significantly reduced; and
	 opportunities to leverage further organic growth through bolt-on acquisitions.

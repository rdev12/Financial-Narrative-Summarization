 CircleReading, our newest hospital, 
secured £22.9 million revenue in its  
third full year of operations. 
Patient volumes increased 16%.  
In particular, the hospital saw a 
significant uplift in the number of  
day case procedures, as it expanded  
the range of NHS services offered.  
Like CircleBath, CircleReading attracts  
a large number of patients who 
choose the hospital: roughly 80% of 
CircleReading’s NHS patients come 
through the NHS e-Referral system, 
formerly known as Choose and Book. 
We were pleased to see an 8% point 
improvement in gross margin. This is 
primarily due to a number of efficiency 
measures, such as standardising 
consumable and prosthesis compliance 
towards industry standards – which in 
turn, we attributed to a model of clinical 
engagement. Agency staffing costs also 
reduced from £1.1 million in 2014 to  
£0.4 million in 2015.
Patient and staff satisfaction both 
remain extremely high at 99.6%  
and 79% respectively.

Revenues at CircleBath grew at a  
greater rate than patient volumes,  
12% and 3% respectively, reflecting  
a shift towards higher acuity work.  
On average, the hospital now performs 
100 hip and knee joint replacements a 
month, and has doubled the volumes  
of spinal procedures performed from  
the previous year. 
A clear majority (85%) of NHS revenue 
is derived from patients individually 
choosing CircleBath, as opposed to a 
trust transferring waiting list work to 
the hospital. The hospital continues to 
capture orthopaedic market share, which 
now stands at 54% of the local market, 
up from 44% in the previous year.  
CircleBath still faces challenges over 
agency staff expenses, in common  
with many other hospitals across the UK; 
however, we have resolved this issue in 
priority areas, and are ensuring a staffing 
and skill mix that ensures patient safety. 
The patient recommendation rate at the 
hospital remains strong at 99%, and we 
are proud that almost 80% of our staff 
would recommend working at Circle to 
their friends and family.

We are now two years into our five-year 
Bedfordshire MSK contract. The purpose 
 of the contract is to make the system  
for MSK services more coherent for the 
patient, while capping the contract value – 
and thus the cost to taxpayers – beneath 
previously anticipated projections of MSK 
spending. 
Total MSK referrals increased 6% in 2015 
on prior year, and were up 17% compared 
to the 2013 calendar year. Despite this 
increase in patients, we achieved a 
number of improvements to MSK care.
We improved the triage process, so that 
every patient who was referred via our 
hub is triaged within 24 hours. At the 
same time, all patients requiring secondary 
care were offered a genuine choice of 
treatment providers – with 98% offered 
choice verbally by a patient advisor.
A number of operational issues were  
also resolved. Previously, we reported  
our challenge in convincing all local  
partners to use our triage hub. 
Following discussions with the local 
clinical commissioning group (‘CCG’), 
we launched a prior approval scheme 
which has reduced the level of patients 
circumventing the hub, and improved 
choice for a larger number of patients. 
We also saw improvements in outcome 
collection, such as a new MSK patient-
reported outcome measure developed 
by Oxford and Keele Universities, and 
using technology to improve community 
care outcome collection, where data 
has traditionally been poor. With this 
improved triage, better engagement  
with patients, greater control of the 
system, and stronger outcomes collection, 
we saw significant shifts towards more 
clinically-appropriate care.
In 2013, the year before the contract,  
11% of all MSK patients were treated 
in community care, with 18% in 
physiotherapy, and 65% in surgery  
or outpatient care. By 2015, this had 
moved to 18% in community care, 20%  
in physiotherapy, and 55% in surgery  
or outpatient care. 
These shifts make the MSK service more 
cost efficient than the previous system, as  
it moves activity towards more clinically-
appropriate treatments, and reduces 
unnecessary surgery. This underpins our 
ability to manage MSK services within 
the capped budget. This is in line with 
our contract and half the rate of activity 
increase.
More importantly, this shift in referral 
patterns is also better for patients, which 
is reflected in outcomes such as patient 
recommendation rates – where 97% of 
patients in our triage hub saying they 
would recommend our care – and county-
wide measures such as EQ-5D scores, 
which ask patients to report on their 
health before and after care. In 2014, 
73% of Bedford area patients reported 
health improvements following a course  
of physiotherapy; this rose to 78% in 2015.
In short, we believe the Bedfordshire 
contract is starting to deliver its proposed 
model of improved outcomes for capped 
spending, even as activity rises, with 
benefits shared between the NHS  
and the provider.
As mentioned in our interim results, 
CircleNottingham received a rating  
of ‘outstanding’ from the CQC for its 
core service of surgery. It is only one of 
a handful of facilities in the country to 
receive this rating. This was one highlight 
in a year of consistently strong clinical 
performance, also reflected in a strong 
patient recommendation rate of 97%. 
The hospital continues to increase its 
patient volumes, despite its contract 
having no guaranteed volumes: again, 
this is a testament to the patient care 
offered and the active choice of GPs  
and patients to be treated by us. To offer 
greater patient choice, we are offering 
operations on weekday evenings, and  
all day on Saturdays. 
EBITDA increased by £0.5 million to  
£3 million, supported by efficiencies 
in the treatment centre. We also seek 
further opportunities to support the  
local healthcare economy, and consider 
the treatment centre to be a prime 
example of the independent sector 
working closely with the NHS to  
offer excellent care.

 Entertainment Rights is a leading global media group specialising in
children’s and family programming, characters and brands. This year
has seen ER substantially strengthen its established partnerships
with key television broadcasters, toy manufacturers and new media
businesses worldwide, notably, in the significant US market.
ER’s extensive library of revenue generating intellectual property is
exploited on a global scale across television distribution, licensing
and merchandising, home entertainment and digital media markets.
Classic Media will significantly enhance ER’s existing strong portfolio
of high-quality content. We believe that this acquisition is a powerful
addition to our future growth and global recognition.
The rapid development in the number of distribution channels
competing for audiences worldwide has transformed the landscape
of the media industry. The growth in the number of specialist
television channels operating on a multi-platform basis available to
the children’s and family audience has, as a direct consequence,
increased the demand for variety in children’s and family
programming. This in turn has fuelled a global increase in character
licensing and the DVD market. We believe that ongoing technology
developments offer content owners many opportunities to generate
additional revenues as new platforms and formats deliver routes to
new and expanding consumer audiences. Furthermore, the advent of
digitisation and increased broadband penetration in the home as well
as mobile technology will increase the revenue earning potential of ER.
The US remains the largest entertainment and media market in the
world, projected to reach US$660 billion by 2008. American children
aged between three and eleven had a combined purchasing power
of US$18 billion in 2005 and this is projected to rise to US$21.4
billion by 2010. ER’s strong position in the lucrative US market
underpins the Company’s long term strategy.
In January 2007, the Company acquired worldwide publishing
phenomenon, Where’s Wally?
®
. This is a unique brand that presents
significant opportunities for exploitation as a multi-media property
and offers substantial potential for launch onto new digital media
platforms. The Company will create new animated and live action
content with multi-platform application that is anticipated to launch
worldwide in 2008/2009.

Michael V. Heap
Chief Executive Officer Operational Highlights:
2006 saw the commissioning and delivery of a record level of
new programming to leading broadcasters. In January 2006, ER
reported Channel Five’s commission of 52 x 10 minute episodes of
Rupert Bear
®
– Follow the Magic which followed the acquisition from
Express Newspapers of a majority stake in the Rupert Bear
®
brand.
Rupert Bear
®
– Follow the Magic was delivered on schedule to
Channel Five for their pre-school block, Milkshake! in November
2006. Rupert Bear
®
- Follow the Magic is now ranked as the top
pre-school show for kids aged between four and six on terrestrial
channels in the UK.
New episodes of The Basil Brush Show™ and Postman Pat
®
were
delivered to the BBC in September 2006. In November 2006, ER
commenced delivery of ITV’s biggest ever pre-school commission of
260 x 11 minute episodes of Jim Jam & Sunny™.
The delivery of the new programming, the concentration of which
accentuated the second half weighting of the Group’s financial
performance in 2006, has enabled ER to recognise the associated
revenue in accordance with its accounting policies. Traditionally,
fourth quarter Christmas trading has been an important factor in
the overall performance of the Group’s home entertainment and
consumer products business and the Board expects a similar trading
pattern this year.
Other highlights include the acquisition of the worldwide distribution
rights, (excluding certain territories) of 78 x 11 minute episodes of
Finley the Fire Engine™. In September 2006, ER announced a multi-
picture, multi-year distribution agreement with Mattel for the long
term distribution rights to the entire Barbie
®
film franchise in the
UK/Eire and television rights on a multi-territory basis. ER also signed
an agreement with BT for supply of content, including Basil Brush
®
,
to their next-generation TV-via-broadband service, BT Vision.
Classic Media:
In January 2007, the acquisition of Classic Media transformed ER
into a leading force in the global children’s and family entertainment
market. This acquisition further diversifies our portfolio of world
famous characters and our library now stands at approximately
3,500 hours of content. In uniting the characters and brands of ER
and Classic Media, we have created one of the strongest portfolios
of contemporary classic and new children’s brands in the world
where Postman Pat
®
, Basil Brush
®
, Rupert Bear
®
, He-Man
®
,
She-Ra
®
and Where’s Wally?
®
now stand alongside iconic US brands
such as Lassie
©
, The Lone Ranger
®
, Casper the Friendly Ghost
©
and
leading values based children’s and family brand, VeggieTales
©
.
The Directors regard the acquisition of Classic Media as a highly
complementary addition to the Group’s business activities and
believe that it further consolidates ER’s position as one of the leading
independent owners of intellectual property in the children’s and
family entertainment sector. This acquisition is a significant step
forward in the long-term development and profitability of ER and is in
line with our continued commitment to enhance shareholder value.

Digital Media and Music
ER is strategically pursuing opportunities across digital platforms
increasing both brand exposure and revenue through new
distribution streams. Children are exposed to advanced technologies
and digital platforms such as computers, the web, video games and
mobile devices at an ever increasing rate and their appetite for
engaging with their favourite characters on different media platforms
opens up significant opportunites for ER. As the owner of sought
after brands, ER is able to create content and develop programming
which is compatible with the target audience. ER is experiencing
increased demand for long and particularly short form programming
which is suitable for digital devices and downloads. In addition to the
recent agreement with BT for specific ER characters to appear on its
next generation TV-via-broadband service, BT Vision, ER has also
secured deals with leaders in the digital category including MobiTV,
Google, AOL/In2TV, YouTube, Lycos, Virgin Media and Player X.
As part of the recent agreement with US based Genius Products, ER
has licensed interactive rights across a number of brands including
She-Ra

who will feature in interactive games to be released from
2007 onwards.
In 2006, ER secured an agreement with Sony BMG who featured

Summary:
ER’s balanced business model of generating revenue from television
distribution, licensing and merchandising, home entertainment and
digital media ensures that ER is in a strong position to fully capitalise
on the global demand for content.
The opportunity for ER to exploit its brands and characters across a
diverse group of distribution channels including television, retail,
broadband and PC’s has never been more prevalent. Our focus
going forward is to continue to seek out and exploit opportunities
created by the increasing number of new media platforms as well as
continuing to maximise traditional platforms to the benefit of
Entertainment Rights and its shareholders.
I would like to join the Chairman in extending my thanks to our team
of dedicated staff.
ER operates in a dynamic and expanding marketplace and we look
forward to capitalising on the opportunities arising from the evolving
media landscape.
We look forward to a successful 2007.

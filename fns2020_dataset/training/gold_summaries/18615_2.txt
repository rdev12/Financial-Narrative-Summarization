Investing in our future by developing our people 
The group’s expansion has allowed us to make a number of senior appointments during
the year. The result is deeper, broader management expertise from which the business 
will benefit as it develops.
In September 2005 we launched a competency framework to continue our work of
aligning employees’ needs to the overall objectives of the group. All staff now have 
an individually tailored development plan to help meet their own goals and aspirations 
and those of the organisation.
To ensure that our health and safety responsibilities are adequately resourced, we’ve now
appointed a group H&S Manager to maintain and improve our H&S standards and practices.
Having realised last year that our Epsom office could no longer cope with the demands 
of a growing business, we moved this year into new and modern office space in Putney. 
Staff training
Investment in employee development is 
vital to our growth. In the last year, just 
over 75% of employees attended formal
training courses with 31 people studying 
for professional qualifications.

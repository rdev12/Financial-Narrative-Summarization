Strategy
Bovis	Homes	has	made	significant	progress	
in	2012,	delivering	a	strong	improvement	
in	revenue,	profits	and	return	on	capital	
employed	against	a	backdrop	of	challenging,	
but	stable,	market	conditions.	
The Group has continued to acquire high quality consented 
land and has consequently grown active sales outlets, leading 
to higher volumes, increased average sales price and higher 
profit margins. Having delivered an improvement in the 
efficiency of capital employed, both by managing working 
capital tightly and through the sale of selected land parcels, 
the Group has increased its capital turn. The combination of 
improved profitability and increased capital turn has delivered a 
strong improvement in the Group’s return on capital employed.
Bovis Homes aims to be a quality housebuilder delivering  
high returns generated from a strong land bank, much  
of it strategically sourced, and a quality product sold at a 
premium price. In order to deliver improved returns, the 
following clear strategic objectives for 2012 were set out  
and have been delivered:
• Increase operating profits
• Build future margin potential in the land bank
• Improve efficiency of capital employed
Additionally the Group has demonstrated significant progress 
against the following objectives:
• Deliver strong health, safety and environmental standards
• Deliver a strong customer service experience
Increase operating profits
Operating profit increased in the year by 56% to £56.8 million, 
as a result of the compound positive effect of an increased 
volume of legal completions at a higher average sales price with 
an improved margin. 
Volume growth was driven from the increased number of active 
sales outlets in 2012. The average number of active sales outlets 
grew to 82 from 73 in the prior year and the Group finished 
2012 with 90 active sales outlets.
The increase in active sales outlets contributed to the delivery of 
2,355 legal completions during 2012, 15% ahead of the previous 
year (2011: 2,045). The Group legally completed 1,854 private 
homes (2011: 1,624), an increase of 14%. Legal completions of 
social homes increased by 19% to 501 (2011: 421), representing 
21% of total volume (2011: 21%).
In addition to increased volume, the Group’s average sales  
price increased by 5% to £170,700 in 2012 (2011: £162,400).  
For private homes, the average sales price in 2012 was  
5% higher at £188,700 (2011: £180,100), in line with  
Group expectations. This uplift was almost entirely due to the 
mix of homes legally completed as the Group increased the 
proportion of family homes sold in the south of England.
Gross profit margin (excluding land sales) increased to 22.6% 
in 2012 from 20.8% in 2011, resulting from the increased 
contribution from legal completions on stronger margin sites 
acquired post the housing market downturn.
As a result of the compound positive effect of volume growth, 
higher average sales price and improved gross profit margin, 
gross profit (excluding land sales) increased by 33% to  
£92.1 million (2011: £69.5 million). Combined with land sales 
profits of £4.8 million (2011: £2.7 million) and with overheads 
well controlled, the significant growth in operating profit to 
£56.8 million (2011: £36.4 million) was achieved at an operating 
margin of 13.4% (2011: 10.0%).
Build future margin potential in the land bank
During 2012, the Group invested in 3,501 plots of consented 
land, of which 2,651 consented plots on 18 sites were added 
to the consented land bank at a cost of £161 million  
(2011: 2,552 consented plots at a cost of £134 million). 
Approximately 86% of these plots are located in the south  
of England, where the housing market continues to show 
greater robustness. The plots added have an estimated future 
revenue of £561 million and an estimated future gross profit 
potential of £146 million, based on current sales prices and 
current build costs, and are expected to deliver a gross margin 
of over 25%. Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 9
Strategy delivery is on track with further growth in 
returns supported by land investment
The remaining 850 consented plots were contracted during  
2012 and were awaiting satisfaction of legal conditions as at  
31 December 2012. Of these, three sites containing 408 consented 
plots have been added to the land bank during the first eight 
weeks of 2013. The balance of these consented plots are expected 
to be added to the land bank in early 2013.
The consented land bank amounted to 13,776 plots as at  
31 December 2012, marginally above the 13,723 plots held  
at 31 December 2011, with plots added being roughly equivalent 
to legal completions combined with plots sold through land sales. 
The Group estimates that the gross profit potential on the plots 
within the consented land bank at the 2012 year end, based on 
current sales prices and current build costs, was £600 million 
with a gross margin of 22.7% (31 December 2011: gross profit 
potential of £524 million with a gross margin of 21.4%).  
The increase during 2012 of £76 million arose from the land 
additions (£146 million) less utilisation from home sales  
(£84 million) and land sales (£12 million). The balancing positive 
value of £26 million reflects other profit enhancing, added value 
changes delivered by the Group, including improvements in 
planning, enhanced sales prices and cost efficiencies.
Of the 13,776 plots, 74% are located in the south of England 
(2011: 72%). At the year end, the consented land bank included 
7,368 consented plots (54% of total), which have been acquired 
since the housing market downturn (2011: 5,797, 42% of total). 
The average consented land plot cost was £42,100 at the start of 
2012 and increased over the year to £45,800, as a result of  
a lower number of written down plots held in the land bank  
(13% of land plots versus 17% at the start of the year) and the 
addition of new prime southern traditional housing sites where  
the average plot cost is higher.
The strategic land bank at 31 December 2012 stood at  
19,318 potential plots as compared to 18,749 potential plots  
at 31 December 2011. The Group continues to invest in new  
strategic land assets and has strong visibility on the potential to 
convert a number of sizeable strategic land holdings into  
consented opportunities during 2013 and 2014.
Improve efficiency of capital employed
The Group has controlled the size and value of the consented land 
bank during 2012, with a similar number of consented plots in the 
land bank at the start and end of the year. This has been achieved, 
at the same time as increasing the level of legal completions and 
operating from a higher number of active sales outlets, being 90 
outlets at 31 December 2012 compared to 80 outlets a year earlier.
The Group has tightly controlled work in progress, with the 
number of units of production held at the end of 2012 reduced to 
918 units (2011: 949). The overall value of work in progress has 
increased to £172.7 million from £166.5 million. Work in progress 
turn increased to 2.5 times in 2012 from 2.2 in 2011, marking a 
further positive step in improving capital efficiency.
Overall capital turn has increased to 0.6 in 2012, up from 0.5 in 
2011 and 0.4 in 2010. With the investment undertaken to date 
and the strength of the ongoing land pipeline, the output capacity 
of the business is expected to increase, which, on the basis of 
stable market conditions, should improve capital turn further in 
2013 and beyond.
Improve returns 
During 2012 Bovis Homes has delivered on the three strategic 
objectives set out above, which has resulted in a significant 
increase in return on capital employed to 7.7% in 2012 from  
5% in 2011. 
The Group strongly believes that, based on stable market 
conditions, return on capital employed will improve further in 
2013, driven by the compound positive effect on profit of higher 
volume, increase in average sales price and improved profit margin. 
Whilst future output capacity will grow, capital employed will 
remain tightly controlled.
Deliver strong health, safety and  
environmental standards
The Group is committed to delivering strong health and safety 
standards for its employees, subcontractors and other site visitors. 
It maintains a high level of organisational focus on its health and 
safety regime through comprehensive staff training, clear and 
accountable management processes and through regular and 
transparent reporting of performance. 
This is overseen, firstly, through the operational line, which takes 
day to day accountability for this area and, secondly, via a Group-
wide oversight committee with nominated regional directors 
responsible for safety, run by the Group Director of Health and 
Safety and chaired by a senior Group manager. The Group also 
seeks to ensure that all of its employees and subcontractors 
who operate at or visit sites carry a CSCS card, indicating its 
commitment to a fully trained workforce. 
Notwithstanding the increase in the Group’s build activity during 
2012, the Group’s NHBC risk score for the year was 0.61, 
which compares favourably to the industry peer group average. 
Additionally, the risk incident rate was 23.
During the last 12 months the Group has continued to focus 
efforts on the key areas of significant risk, being working at 
heights, PPE and slips, trips and falls in order to raise awareness in 
these areas. Whilst the Group’s health and safety performance is 
relatively strong versus external benchmarks, the Group cannot  
be complacent. Health and Safety will remain a key area of focus 
for regional and Group management. 10		 |		 Annual	report	and	accounts		 |		 Strategy
Chief Executive’s report 
The Group continues to regard sustainable development as 
critical to the long term creation of value for its shareholders. 
The housebuilding industry has an important role to play both 
in mitigating the impact of its building activities on the local 
environment and in the evolution of building techniques  
and advances, which reduce the carbon usage from new  
build developments.
During 2012, the Group has significantly increased the 
focus on waste in order to drive down the quantity of waste 
produced in building a home. The quantity of active waste 
generated per home in 2012 was reduced by 24% to 3.1 
tonnes and the amount sent to landfill was reduced by 42%.
The Group works with a range of external stakeholders to 
agree and carry out development in a mutually acceptable 
manner, thereby ensuring that its developments take place in 
a way which mitigates the impact on the local environment, 
thereby balancing the needs of local communities for new 
housing with the requirement to avoid environmental damage.
Looking forward, the Group is focusing on ways to ensure 
that its products conform to good environmental standards, 
including both to EcoHomes standards and to emerging 
standards under the Code for Sustainable Homes.  
Reflecting the existing contribution that the Group makes  
to the communities and environments in which it operates,  
the Group is proud to say that it is a member of the 
FTSE4Good index.
Further details of the Group’s efforts and achievements during 
2012 in regards to Corporate Social Responsibility will be 
published in a separate report, available from the Company’s 
website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk).
Deliver a strong customer service experience 
for Bovis Homes customers
The Group continues to invest in delivering its customer 
charter, which sets the expectations in relation to the quality 
of the product it delivers and the manner in which the sales 
transaction is serviced. The Group has been recognised 
independently by the achievement of a five star builder rating 
by the Home Builder Federation. Additionally, the Group is 
pleased to see the key internal scoring metrics of ‘recommend 
a friend’ and ‘purchase another Bovis home’ continuing to 
generate strong satisfaction scores during 2012 of 94% and 
92% respectively.
The focus of the Group’s customer communication has 
remained digitally based during 2012, with the Group using 
the power of the internet to directly market its products to 
consumers, utilising internally generated mailing lists as well as 
via intermediaries such as rightmove and Zoopla. Over 70% of 
customer enquires originate via the web.
The sales structure has evolved into a blended solution of both 
hubs and standalone sites, based upon geographic, product 
and competitor criteria. This ensures that the sales resource is 
deployed in the most appropriate manner. IT connectivity is 
provided to all of the sales operations, enabling efficient and 
effective customer communication and the utilisation of an 
integrated CRM system. The selling process is supported by the 
Group’s bespoke prospect management system, which delivers 
on-site technology whilst integrating the Group’s prospect 
database with brochure fulfilment.
Market conditions
Overall market conditions were challenging but stable  
during 2012. Sales prices were generally stable with some 
regional variations. A continuing lack of availability during the 
year of high loan to value mortgage products constrained 
market activity for new build homes. This was particularly  
an issue for first time buyers, who, since the financial crisis, 
have had to provide a higher level of deposit for their  
home purchase than had historically been the case.  
Monthly mortgage approval levels were stable throughout 
2012, but at significantly lower levels than historically would 
have been viewed as “normal” market activity.
With a backdrop of continuing economic and employment 
uncertainty, trading conditions in 2013 are expected to remain 
similar to 2012. Although the market remains challenging and 
customer confidence and commitment levels remain subdued, 
the Group currently believes that the pricing environment will 
be broadly stable during 2013.
A range of Government initiatives are beginning to provide 
impetus to the housing market and in particular the new 
build market. The Government’s NewBuy scheme has been in 
operation for nearly one year and, after a period of awareness 
building and reductions in interest rates attaching to lenders’ 
NewBuy mortgage products, NewBuy activity is increasing.  
The Government’s FirstBuy scheme has entered its second 
phase of delivery with allocations awarded to housebuilders for 
use in 2013 and early 2014. This will provide further support 
for first time buyers in obtaining finance from lenders.

Strategy delivery is on track with further growth in 
returns supported by land investment
Whilst not a housing initiative, the Government’s Funding for 
Lending Scheme is providing assistance to banks in the form of 
more cost effective finance, which in turn will support these banks 
in lending mortgages at higher loan to value ratios and at cheaper 
rates of interest. The positive effect of the Funding for Lending 
Scheme has not yet been evidenced in published mortgage 
approval statistics, but there is a growing consensus that such a 
positive effect will be seen in mortgage approval data over the 
coming months. Increased mortgage approvals will support an 
improvement in housing transactions, including activity in the new 
homes market.
Current trading
The Group entered 2013 with a forward sales order position of 
778 homes, a 37% improvement on the 568 homes brought 
forward at the start of 2012.
The Group has delivered 350 private reservations in the first eight 
weeks of 2013 (2012: 320), an increase of 9%. Operating from 
an average of 90 active sales outlets during this period (2012: 83), 
the Group has achieved a sales rate per site per week of 0.49, 
in line with the comparable period in 2012. Sales rates in recent 
weeks have exceeded 0.5 sales per site, indicating an encouraging 
start to the spring selling season and providing confidence that 
the Group is on target to deliver its anticipated volumes in 2013. 
Encouragingly, NewBuy has contributed circa 10% of 2013 private 
reservations to date. 
Sales prices achieved to date have been in line with Group 
expectations, with an increase in the average private sales price 
to circa £200,000, driven by the improving mix with more family 
homes in southern England.
As at 22 February 2013, the Group held 1,198 net sales for 
legal completion in 2013, as compared to 926 net sales at the 
same point in 2012, an increase of 29%. Of these, private sales 
amounted to 599 homes (2012: 550) and social housing sales 
amounted to 599 homes (2012: 376).
Outlook
As a result of the strong consented investment in land in recent 
years, the Group expects to continue to increase its number of 
active sales outlets during 2013 from the opening position of 90 
active sales outlets. Given the focus on acquiring land in the south 
of England, it is anticipated that more than 70% of the active sales 
outlets at the end of 2013 will be in southern locations versus 
two thirds at the start of 2013. As the Group opens more new 
sales outlets than it closes, absolute weekly reservation levels are 
expected to increase.
The Group anticipates that during 2013 it will take the opportunity 
to invest significantly in promoting a number of strategic land 
holdings where there is strong visibility of achieving planning 
during 2013 or 2014, a number of which were discussed  
at the Group’s Analyst and Investor Presentation held on  
24 October 2012. The Group estimates the cost of promoting 
strategic land during 2013 will, therefore, be circa £3.5 million 
higher than in 2012. This significant investment for future value 
generation will impact the profits deliverable in 2013 and will 
constrain the rate of growth in housing gross margin in 2013, 
compared to 2012, but will support further growth thereafter.
The continued growth in active sales outlets should enable the 
Group to deliver increased volumes, at a higher average sales 
price with improved margins. With a clear focus on controlling the 
capital employed of the Group through rigorous management of 
the landbank and tight control of work in progress, on the basis of 
stable market conditions, the Group will deliver strongly increasing 
returns on capital employed in 2013, with the expectation of 
continuing progress for the foreseeable future.

“BAE Systems
has delivered
a further
year of good
performance”
Dick Olver Chairman
BAE Systems has delivered a further year of good
performance against its objectives,delivering on our
strategy,financial performance and other non-financial
metrics that are becoming an increasingly important
component of a successful business operating in
global markets.
The more difficult economic climate may restrict many
governments’ spending,but we believe defence and security will
continue to be amongst the priorities for a number of our main
government customers. The long-term nature of much of our
business,underpinned by a record order book,provides a good
level of forward visibility. BAE Systems has been successful in
addressing growth opportunities in a strong US defence market,
whilst continuing to improve operating performance in the more
difficult UK market environment,and winning new business and
expanding our presence in other markets around the world. The
Group’s continued focus on delivering performance and value
for money will be increasingly important in its drive to deliver
our aspirations for sustainable growth in shareholder value.
– Good performance against objectives
– Further progress in delivery of strategy
– Greater focus on the Corporate
Responsibility agenda
– Transition to a new Chief Executive

 CPP is committed to providing a 
great service to its customers which 
is why I was delighted to return to 
the business as its CEO in May 2016 
Upon arriving I was heartened by 
the resilience and professionalism 
all employees demonstrated 
through what had potentially 
been a difficult period

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 10 Since returning in May 2016, I have undertaken 
a major review of the business and have identified 
many things that are good and working well, but 
also opportunities that we are not capitalising on  
I have set focused plans in motion to address these 
missed opportunities  I have visited all of our major 
operations to understand how they are run and 
where the opportunities lie  Both the progress 
being made and the relationships being developed 
in many of our markets are highly encouraging 
Organisational improvements
For any business to be successful it is critical 
that the structure is right; it must enable flexible 
and dynamic operations  As a result, the Group 
Leadership Team has been slimmed down, allowing 
focus to be provided in the correct areas  There is 
now direct responsibility for country operations, 
product and innovation in addition to marketing and 
the support functions, which allows the Company 
to focus on the key growth drivers in the business  
As part of this streamlining certain Executive 
Directors have also accepted additional support 
function responsibilities  This action has also taken 
cost out of the business, which will allow investment 
in other strategically important areas and roles 
What is the plan?
My assessment of our operations quickly led me 
to identify a clear set of strategic priorities that 
will propel the business towards sustainable, 
profitable growth  These strategic priorities are:
• growing revenue and customer volume;
• driving innovation, through local insight 
and global new product development; and
• cost management 
These priorities will be underpinned by the 
development of colleagues and the cultural 
behaviour within the organisation, along with the 
launch of a new visual identity for the business  
The strategic priorities have been cascaded into the 
business and colleagues are focused on successfully 
realising our growth ambitions which have been 
articulated in a vision for the Group that takes us 
to 2020  These are exciting times 
Growing revenue and volume
The future looks very positive in some of our 
developing markets such as India, China, Turkey 
and Mexico and our strategic plan focuses on 
ensuring that the required investment is directed 
to these markets to maximise all available 
opportunities  The potential in these markets is 
significant  India, China and Turkey are already 
contributing increased volumes to the business, 
but there is more to come  Our established markets 
are not going to be forgotten and we expect renewed 
contribution from markets such as the UK, Spain, 
Germany and Italy  Stronger renewal rates in 
these countries are really encouraging and have 
contributed to an improvement in the Group 
renewal rate to 74 9% (2015: 72 9%) 
Driving innovation
Whilst proud of our existing products we 
recognise the need to stay relevant in a rapidly 
changing world  New product development is key  
We are creating a suite of products with global 
appeal and compatibility  These are service-based 
propositions that can be traded in any of our markets, 
including the UK  The first in this suite of products, 
OwlDetect, has been launched in the UK and 
Germany during 2016  Mexico and Spain will 
follow shortly, with other markets due to launch 
in the first half of the year

operations quickly led me

strategic priorities that 
will propel the business 
towards sustainable, 
profitable growth ”

Driving innovation continued
A further product is planned for release in 
H1 2017, with others to follow as we continue 
to invest in ideas and concept generation  
These propositions are centred on consumer 
insight and needs and will also be delivered 
digitally to match consumer preference  Product 
innovation will also draw on external sources – via 
partnerships and strategic alliances – to generate 
additional concepts to test and market  The 
acquisition of Blink represents the first step in 
this  New products may have regulated content 
if the opportunity arises  Aligned to this, and 
very much a part of the overall product strategy, 
local innovation is being encouraged and 
supported to capitalise on particular market 
and Business Partner opportunities 
Cost management
To enable additional investment in our developing 
markets, cost management remains an important 
pillar of the strategic plan  This will ensure that our 
cost base remains appropriate and can be targeted 
in the right areas  The Company has made important 
decisions in the recent past to control costs but 
more can be done  In 2016 a number of difficult 
decisions were taken to promote this: we stopped 
development of our IT platform with SSP Limited 
(SSP) in favour of developing a more cost-effective, 
flexible in-house platform, the leadership team has 
been slimmed down, and operational requirements 
and capability across the Group have been reviewed  
The changes made have not only reduced costs 
but improved the performance of the Group  Cost 
management initiatives will continue in 2017 
Colleague engagement and culture
Our colleagues are central to the success of the 
business and are at the heart of providing great 
products and services to our customers  We have 
embedded values of ‘commit, collaborate and 
perform’ within the organisation and implemented 
initiatives to promote colleague development and 
behaviours  The promotion of our People & Culture 
Director, Justine Shaw, to an Executive Director 
position further demonstrates our commitment 
to colleague development  This has created 
greater influence at Board level to drive the 
colleague engagement programme 
Customer
Our customers are hugely important to us  We pride 
ourselves on providing relevant and engaging 
propositions, along with a great ongoing customer 
experience  This will not change and our new 
product development has this understanding 
and commitment at its core  Our customer contact 
centres remain important but we recognise that 
we must also embrace digital channels, supported 
by innovative and engaging branding  
Understanding and engaging 
with our stakeholders
We have proactively engaged with our stakeholders 
through frequent, transparent dialogue and 
consultation  We believe this is critical in the 
development of the Group and sustaining valued 
relationships  We have a credible plan and a strong 
team and I am committed to ensuring our business 
operates in a responsible way, meeting the needs 
of all stakeholders

CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 12 Performance
Our global operations continue to progress 
well, leading to a reduced dependency on the UK  
Asia Pacific has seen significant growth and now 
represents 23% of Group revenue, compared to 
11% in 2015  This has been a record year for India; 
customer numbers are increasing rapidly; new 
propositions introduced to the market are gaining 
momentum; and a significant contract signed 
with a leading non-banking financial company is 
expected to provide continued growth  Turkey has 
shown good revenue growth, driven by developing 
multi-partner, multi-channel routes to market 
which will provide a level of sustainability and 
further market opportunity  Other markets are 
also contributing with the annual renewal rate 
increasing to 74 9% (2015: 72 9%)  This is largely 
due to rates increasing in our established markets, 
providing a continued endorsement of the value 
customers place on our traditional products  
Symbolically, the Group’s live policy base has also 
returned to growth with 4 3 million customers at 
the year end (2015: 3 8 million), reflecting growth 
in our Indian and Chinese markets 
As expected, Group revenue from continuing 
operations has declined to £73 6 million 
(2015: £76 8 million)  However, this represents a 
much reduced rate of decline than previous years  
The growth in India has been offset by the natural 
decline in the UK renewal book where new regulated 
sales remain restricted  Underlying operating 
profit from continuing operations has increased 
to £8 4 million (2015: £6 9 million), which reflects 
the improved performance in India and continued 
focused management of the cost base  During 2017, 
we anticipate that revenues will grow  However further 
investment will be made in order to provide a 
sustainable performance in the medium to long term 
Looking ahead
We have made good progress 
in 2016 and are moving forward 
with a clear plan which will 
provide the platform for long 
term growth and profitability  
New product development is 
progressing well with further 
globally applicable propositions 
currently in development  As 
a truly global business, we are 
genuinely excited by the great 
opportunities we have to 
support customers around 
the world

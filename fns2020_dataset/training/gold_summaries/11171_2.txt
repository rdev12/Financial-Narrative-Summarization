 We the Board of Directors are happy to present to our Shareholders yet another profitable year. Management has worked
diligently to conclude a profitable outturn to the year. Our core client relationships have been maintained and in some cases
strengthened and we also continue to make progress in expanding our presence in core target markets such as the Middle
East, Africa and Southeast Asia. At the same time, we remain optimistic about the long term prospects in our target markets
around the world given the fundamental demand drivers in those markets.

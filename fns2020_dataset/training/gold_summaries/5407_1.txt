 As service industries become a bigger part of the industrial mix
the management of human resource expenses and the utilisation
of a flexible work force will take on increasing importance.
Performance review 2006
The last two years have proven to be a
transition period as the Group has
undertaken the transformation from a
diversified, specialist UK staffing group to
an international one. In financial terms the
Group has taken a number of small steps in
its overseas development. In terms of
strategy and structure, however, several
significant steps have been taken which
will allow Empresaria to increase its scale
of operations at a rapid pace as
opportunities, such as the acquisition of
Headway in Germany, emerge.
One of the features of the strong financial
performance in 2006 has been the differential
between profit growth and revenue growth.
The explanation highlights the core of our
“balanced growth” strategy. In the year we
committed over £1m to fund start up operations
in Asia, Europe and the UK, incurring start up
losses during this period. In addition the Group
invested in additional management, finance
and technical skills and resource, to provide a
platform for further growth. Where we have
made small acquisitions in the year we have
also made significant further internal
investment in order to accelerate future
growth. In making these investments in
companies, people and infrastructure we are
seeking to develop sustainable, long term,
growing revenue streams. The consequence of
investment now is expected to be strong
organic growth in the future. 
Highlights
A number of regional and company
performances stand out in the year. The fastest
growth is, as expected, being experienced
internationally. The Asian markets have all
been buoyant. Our Japanese operations, with
particular contribution from Skillhouse (IT
staffing), experienced spectacular growth in
revenues and gross margins from a small base.
The Monroe Consulting operations, acquired in
December 2005, saw growth in Asia both in
terms of revenues but also sector
diversification with new temporary and
outsourcing services added in both Indonesia
and Thailand and, following the end of the
year, new operations launched in Malaysia. 
In Europe, we have used the IT staffing
platform offered by GIT (a Czech company
acquired in early 2006) to launch new services 
in Slovakia. We have also invested further in
ITC (a Polish company acquired in October
2006) to develop a broader regional branch
presence in Poland.
While Group development focus has been
concentrated on international opportunities, it
is encouraging to see the UK companies deliver
such a positive performance, particularly in
the second half of the year. It is equally
encouraging that these strong results were
delivered by a combination of sectors,
specifically Property Services and Construction,
Financial Services and Other Brands. Within
Other Brands our creative staffing company
The Recruitment Business had a particularly
successful year with contribution coming for
the first time from the Manchester office set
up in 2005 and with the successful launch of a
new office in Australia.

Chief Executive board of directors with a Chairman, two
executives and two non-executives. Historically
there has been a direct line of reporting from
individual managing directors to the Chief
Executive. This flat structure is changing,
reflecting the rapid development of our
international operations. The appointment of
Armin Preisig as head of European operations
(a position he previously held with Vedior and
Select Appointments) has resulted in an
apportionment of both management and
development responsibility across different
regions. Separately, we have re-structured the
central finance function bringing in additional
skills and expertise both at central and regional
level. The net result of these changes is that we
have increased our capacity to manage growth.
Market overview 
The international staffing industry is
expanding. Growth rates and market
opportunities differ from country to country
with each country retaining different
regulatory environments, political and 
cultural perceptions, economic and market
characteristics. Countries such as Japan and
Germany represent mature economies but at
the same time, mainly as a consequence of
structural change, represent high growth
staffing markets. India combines both a high
growth economy and staffing market but, for
reasons of demography, represents a completely
different challenge in fulfilling the needs of
local clients. China represents a high growth
economy but with a small staffing industry
still, for the moment, held back by legislative
restrictions. 
A common characteristic in all our geographic
markets is the positive trading environment
and the number of new opportunities at both
local and at Group level. As service industries
become a bigger part of the industrial mix the
management of human resource expenses and
the utilisation of a flexible work force will take
on increasing importance.
Strategic focus
Group development focus is to strengthen and
grow our existing businesses and look for 
new investment opportunities in growing
international staffing markets. To date our
resources have been applied to the developing
economies and staffing markets of Eastern
Europe and Asia. These regions remain a 
focus of attention and offer a number of
incremental investment opportunities. In
addition, we are researching and targeting
opportunities in Western Europe and Latin
America. In each case we are seeking partners
who are motivated by our management equity
philosophy, structure and the opportunity to
create a new multi-specialist, multi-national
staffing group with high growth prospects.

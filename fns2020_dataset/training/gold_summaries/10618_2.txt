	 UK	losses	were	reduced	to	£21.7	million.
	 Our	strategy	is	to	close	loss-making	stores
	 and	reduce	operating	costs	mitigating
the	ongoing	challenge	of	weak	consumer
	 spending	conditions	in	the	UK.
 A Our strategy to transform the UK and return it to profi tability is making 
good progress. We closed 56 stores during the year and took out 
operating costs, meeting the targets we set ourselves a year ago.
 A Total UK sales were down 10.8 per cent (down 9.2 per cent on a 
comparable 52 vs. 52 week basis) at £499.7 million. Like-for-like sales 
were down 3.6 per cent, helped by Direct in Home, which was up 
4.0 per cent on a comparable basis.

During the year, we reduced space in the 
UK by 7.2 per cent, closing 141k sq. ft. or

larger with 196 stores covering 1,711k sq. ft. 
compared to our Early Learning Centre 
(ELC) format with 59 stores covering 
94k sq. ft., which is where our store closure 
programme is concentrated. Our strategy 
to reduce space further to 1,700k sq. ft. 
or 200 stores and reduce the operating 
cost base by £20 million by March 2015 is 
progressing well.

Miniclub, our strategic partnership with 
Boots, continues to perform well. We 
continue to look for opportunities to extend 
the ELC range to wholesale without 
impacting our store or direct sales. 	 Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2013 3

Base for International direct building well
Over the last year, we have laid the 
foundations for a robust multi-channel 
offering for our franchise partners. 
We now have a scalable online platform 
that can be rolled out with ease, in 
multiple languages and currencies. 
Most of our franchise partners operate 
in markets where multi-channel is still 
in its infancy and so developing the 
infrastructure is crucial. We now have 
transactional e-commerce sites in 
Ireland, Indonesia, Kuwait and Russia. 
In addition, our partner in China has 
a transactional site on TMall, China’s 
largest online site. Our aim remains 
to have a multi-channel offer for all 
our major markets by March 2015.

the growth opportunities offered by our 
International markets and believe we 
can grow space in line with the level 
achieved during FY2013.

We believe that there is an opportunity 
to extend the reach of ELC through 
wholesale but only in those markets 
where we do not already have a 
presence through franchise stores. 
This is a small part of our overall 
International business, but does offer 
interesting growth opportunities.
	 Our	International	business	delivered	another	
year	of	growth.	On	a	comparable	basis,	
space	was	up	13.5%,	sales	were	up	15%	
in	constant	currency	and	profi 	ts	were	
up	20.3%.	
 A Our strategy to grow our International business remains unchanged. We continue 
to see growth opportunities in both new and existing markets, where our franchise 
partners are moving to larger stores while embarking on multi-channel strategies.
 A Total International sales were up 8.4 per cent at £728.7 million (up 11.8 per cent 
at £685.4 million on a comparable 52 vs. 52 week basis and excluding Australia 
and New Zealand). Adjusting for the Eurozone, where consumer confi dence 
remains depressed, all our regions delivered double-digit sales growth 
and positive like-for-like sales growth, which was up 5.6 per cent during 
the year.

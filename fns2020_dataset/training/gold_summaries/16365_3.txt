Debt and financing
Net debt at 31 March 2010 was £79.6 million, a reduction of  
£40.6 million during the year. This significant reduction reflects  
an improvement in the Group’s working capital management and  
also the restrictions on capital expenditure imposed during the year. 
At 31 March 2010, the ratio of the Group’s net debt to earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’), as computed 
under our banking agreements, was 2.14 times (2009: 2.59 times);  
this compares favourably to the covenant of 3.25. Interest cover was 
4.97 times (2009: 5.63 times) and was comfortably over our banking 
covenant of 4.00 times.
The Group’s principal banking facilities comprise a US$150.0 million 
revolving credit facility due for repayment in June 2014 and a term 
loan of US$87.7 million due for repayment in August 2011. The Board 
is confident the Group has appropriate banking facilities in place to 
finance its continuing operations and dialogue with potential providers 
of funding is well advanced in respect of replacing the term loan.
Management and employees
Umeco’s results demonstrate the talent and resilience of our 
employees, who have adapted to the unpredictable and challenging 
market conditions we continue to face. I thank them for their support 
and ongoing commitment to Umeco.
Board changes
I am delighted that, on 30 April 2010, we announced the appointment 
of Adrian Auer as Senior Independent Director. Adrian’s breadth 
of international corporate experience, both in Executive and Non-
executive roles, is already proving invaluable to the Board.
Since joining Umeco in October 2009, I have been very impressed by 
the quality of the Group’s businesses and management. Much of the 
credit for this must go to my predecessor, Brian McGowan, who retired 
in August 2009 having served as Chairman for over 12 years. Brian 
presided over a transformation of Umeco and I take this opportunity to 
thank him sincerely for his service to the Group during that period.
On behalf of the Board, I would also like to give my thanks to  
David Porter, who retired from the Board on 31 December 2009  
having served as a Director for nine years. David made a significant 
contribution to Umeco and played a key role in the Group’s development.

Chairman’ s Statement
We are weathering the effects of the 
economic downturn well, with actions taken 
to improve working capital management and 
reduce debt leaving us strongly positioned
Overview
Umeco has continued to perform creditably despite the difficult 
and uncertain conditions prevailing in its markets and in the macro 
economic environment. The impact of these factors on the Group’s 
trading has been partly mitigated by the actions we have taken to 
reduce costs and raise efficiency. We anticipate softness and volatility 
in near term demand, but our longer term outlook remains positive, as 
new aircraft programmes go into production and the other markets in 
which we operate begin to recover.
Results and dividend
Revenue from continuing operations in the year to 31 March 2010 
was £409.4 million (2009: £410.9 million) a decrease of 0.4 per cent. 
At constant exchange rates and adjusting for the effects of the 
acquisition of IPM in the prior year, the decrease in revenue was  
5.6 per cent (the ‘underlying’ decrease).
Operating profit from continuing operations fell by 8.9 per cent  
to £31.6 million (2009: £34.7 million) with margins reducing to  
7.7 per cent (2009: 8.4 per cent). The underlying decrease in operating 
profit was 11.9 per cent.
Net interest charges, excluding the revaluation of financial 
instruments, were £6.7 million (2009: £6.2 million). The increase 
reflects the full year funding effect of the acquisition of IPM and 
foreign exchange rate movements. 
Profit before tax from continuing operations was £24.9 million  
(2009: £28.5 million), a decrease of 12.6 per cent. Earnings per share 
were 36.6 pence compared to 39.7 pence, a reduction of 7.8 per cent.
The Board is proposing an unchanged final dividend of 11.0 pence 
making a total for the year of 17.5 pence per ordinary share  
(2009: 17.5 pence). The final dividend is payable on 8 October 2010  
to shareholders on the register on 10 September 2010. 2006

Strategy
In the period since joining the Board, I have visited the Group’s principal 
operations, met with each of their management teams and spent time 
with some of our major customers. It is clear to me that we have three 
fine businesses within the Group. They have strong positions in their 
respective markets with considerable potential for further growth. 
They are well invested, with good facilities and experienced operating 
management teams. They enjoy the support of, and are valued by, their 
customers. 
The Board’s task is to ensure that the strength of our businesses is 
reflected in optimal value for our shareholders and the Board continues 
to review its strategy to ensure this is achieved. We will be encouraging 
each business to grow organically, improve efficiencies, invest in new 
technologies and, if appropriate, acquire relevant skills. We will seek to 
develop deeper partnerships with our customers. Each business will 
flourish by being totally focused on its markets.
Prospects
The indicators for long term demand in the civil aerospace market 
continue to be positive. Airbus and Boeing at 31 March 2010 had a 
backlog of 6,776 orders and it is expected they will deliver 946 aircraft 
in 2010 compared with 979 deliveries in 2009. More importantly, 
Boeing expects that delivery of the first B787 will occur in the fourth 
quarter of 2010 and Airbus continues to commit considerable 
resources to the development of the A350XWB. Both of these new 
programmes are expected to provide the Group with growing long 
term revenue across all of our business streams.
We are weathering the effects of the economic downturn well. We 
have a good order book, underpinned by expanding relationships 
with our key customers, and there is a good pipeline of new business 
opportunities available to us across all our operating segments. 
Although trading conditions in our markets remain uncertain, the 
actions we have taken to reduce our cost base, improve working capital 
management and reduce debt leave us strongly positioned.

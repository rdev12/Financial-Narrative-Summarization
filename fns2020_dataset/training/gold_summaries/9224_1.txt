 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
08 Annual Report and Accounts 2008

Christopher Bell
Chief Executive
2008 has been a busy year for the Group.
eGaming has launched a range of initiatives
which have led to an increase of 20.0% in 
net gaming revenues whilst, in UK Retail, the
OddsOn! customer loyalty card was launched
and strong control was exercised over costs.
Outside the UK we are building businesses 
in Spain and Italy, and continue to explore
opportunities in China.
Retail betting
In spite of the challenging economic
environment our UK Retail business has seen
gross win growth of 4.7% over the period, an
improvement from last year’s 3.3% increase.
This rise was driven by our 8,044 machines
which delivered gross win growth of 15.2%.
The implementation of the 2005 Gambling Act
has allowed us to operate extended winter
evening opening and introduce B3 (£1 stake:
£500 jackpot) content onto our terminals.
During the year we have introduced five 
new B3 slot games.
OTC gross win benefited from extended
winter evening opening in the first three
months plus the incremental activity of the
European Football Championships. However,
a lower margin contributed to OTC gross 
win declining by 0.6%.
Cost control has remained a key area of focus
for the UK business. After allowing for the
4.3% increase associated with extended
winter evening openings and the introduction
of Turf TV , other costs grew by just 0.5%. This
mainly reflects the introduction of voluntary
single opening, improved staff scheduling, 
the closure of unprofitable shops and the
further reduction of Sky coverage in 
the shop estate.
In Ireland, we added a net 71 shops to the
estate, the majority of which were in Northern
Ireland. While the like for like Northern Ireland
performance showed good gross win growth
of 21.3%, the shops in the Republic of Ireland
suffered an 8.8% like for like constant
currency gross win decline. This reflected 
the more challenging economic environment
and, with no machines, a greater reliance 
on Irish horseracing which experienced an 
unusually high number of abandonments. 
The underlying gross win performance for
Ireland was down 6.6% during the year. 
Our Belgian business reported £3.1 million 
of profit and is expected to benefit in 2009
from the recent closure of our two largest
competitors. In Italy, the roll-out of our
licences has been completed and the clear
priority in 2009 is to grow revenues across 
the estate.
Remote betting and gaming
In February 2008 we announced our
eGaming strategy of enhanced investment
into new customer acquisition to drive 
profit growth in future years. The main
initiatives announced included: television
advertising for Ladbrokesbingo.com and
Ladbrokescasino.com in the UK; tailoring
regional content to more effectively satisfy 
the customer base (for example in the
Nordics) and content innovation (for example
increased opportunities for betting-in-play).
On the back of these initiatives we have seen
net gaming revenue increase by 20.0% 
over the year, with new customer sign ups
growing by 21.5% to 373,000 and the
number of unique active players using
Ladbrokes.com also increasing by 20.8% 
to 726,000. The competitive environment 
for Poker remains extremely challenging, 
and in the second week of February we joined
the Microgaming network to improve the
liquidity on higher staking tables.
We have always been clear that the frequency
of High Rollers activity is unpredictable and
although not as active as 2007, High Rollers
contributed £80.1 million of profit during 
2008, a very material source of cash flow.
International development
In Spain, following the grant of our Madrid
licence in April, our Sportium joint venture 
has now opened 45 outlets. The full potential 
of Spain remains dependent on the pace 
of regulation in other regions. 
Our international team continues to pursue 
a number of opportunities and bids around
the world, with a particular focus currently 
on China. CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 09
Capital structure
During 2008, the Group successfully took 
a proactive stance in managing its debt
facilities. We signed an additional £185 million
of committed bank facilities and extended
£400 million of maturities from 2011 to 
2013. During the year we also repaid our
£175 million 7.25% bond on maturity, and 
in December took the opportunity to
repurchase €35.5 million of our 2009 6.5%
Eurobond. At 31 December 2008 the 
Group had undrawn committed facilities 
of £510.4 million, well in excess of our 
2009 Eurobond maturity of £351 million.
Regulatory environment
2008 saw the first full year of implementation
of the 2005 UK Gambling Act. In response 
to the changes, we have had 82% of our
estate open until 9.30pm throughout the year
and have improved our machine content.
eGaming meanwhile has seen the benefits 
of television advertising with campaigns 
for both Ladbrokesbingo.com and
Ladbrokescasino.com.
On 31 October 2008, The Horserace Betting
Levy was agreed with a roll-over at the
previous levy rate of 10% of UK horseracing
gross win. In addition The British Horseracing
Association and The Race Course Association
agreed to stage an additional 102 races 
in 2009.
In July 2008 the Gambling Commission
outlined its plans for additional research into
high-stake, high-prize gaming machines. The
research is aimed at increasing understanding
of what impact these machines may have on
problem gambling. The Gambling Commission
agreed to report back to the Minister for Sport
by the end of June 2009.  
In Spain the regulation of retail betting by the
Comunidad de Madrid and the issuance of
licences enabled us to launch our Sportium
joint venture. In Italy we have rolled out the
new licences we were awarded following
further market regulation in 2006.
Consistent with EU single market law, 
we continue to strive for the removal of
restrictions on the freedom of establishment
and the free movement of services across
borders. The European Commission has
brought ongoing infringement procedures
against a number of Member States, primarily
in relation to national measures that effectively
prohibit the activities of private remote
gambling operators. A number of Member
States are currently considering changes 
in legislation varying from those seeking 
to legalise, regulate and tax to those seeking
restrictions which further protect state
controlled monopoly operators and their
revenues. We actively lobby individual
Member States and challenge restrictions
through complaints to the Commission 
and legal challenges in the national courts. 
In 2008 our long-running case in the Dutch
national courts was referred to the European
Court of Justice, from which a ruling is
expected in late 2009/early 2010.

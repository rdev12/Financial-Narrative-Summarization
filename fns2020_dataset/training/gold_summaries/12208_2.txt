Strategy 
 
We have completed phases one and two of our strategic growth plan and have entered phase 
three of our four-phase plan for growth. The phase three objective is to cross-sell all of the group’s 
services into our existing customer base, this strengthens our customer's reliance on Pinnacle, 
increases our profit per customer and dramatically decreases the likelihood of our customer’s 
switching to a competitor. Our strategy is predicated on cross-selling the elements of our 
converged managed services offering, which is already delivering positive results.

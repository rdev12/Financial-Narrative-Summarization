 4 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2011
Ten year total return outperformance 
against the FTSE All-Share
1 13.5%
Overview
Main themes from the review
Caledonia’s aims are:
● ● to provide an increasing store of wealth for 
shareholders
● ● to provide an increasing annual income for 
shareholders.
Caledonia’s core investment philosophy is:
● ● to invest in listed and unlisted companies  
and funds
● ● to invest in the UK and overseas
● ● to back high quality management teams
● ● to take significant minority positions with board 
representation if possible
● ● to take a long term supportive approach
● ● to invest in a value orientated style
● ● to maintain a concentrated portfolio.
We will also maintain an income portfolio,  
as described below.
Caledonia will avoid:
● ● start up or very early stage companies
● ● highly leveraged companies
● ● companies whose business we do not understand.
We will continue to measure ourselves against the 
FTSE All-Share capital and total return indices.
Key areas that required attention
● ● The way in which our management resource was 
deployed, whilst seeking to keep our total expense 
ratio to about 1%.
● ● The number of investments in our portfolio (68) 
was too large and too many were sub-scale so 
unlikely to make a significant impact. In the 
future, we will aim to keep the minimum size  
of new investments above £10m.
● ● Caledonia’s portfolio yield of 1.9% and dividend 
yield of about 2% were too low compared with  
the FTSE All-Share at 3%. Our portfolio yield 
therefore needs to increase.
● ● Our investment and divestment process  
needed refining.
Performance summary
Caledonia’s net asset value (‘NAV’) per share grew 
from 2034p to 2165p over the year to 31 March 
2011. This represented an increase of 6.4% and  
a welcome return to outperformance against the 
FTSE All-Share index, albeit by a modest 1.0%.  
Our five year record also remains positive with  
an outperformance of 5.3%. However, we should  
not ignore the deterioration in our total return 
performance in the medium term, both on an NAV 
per share total return (‘NAV TR’) and share price 
total return (‘TSR’) basis. Our NAV TR has 
underperformed the FTSE All-Share Total Return 
index by 5.0% over the past five years and our TSR 
has underperformed by 24.4% over this same 
period reflecting, to a large extent, the significant 
widening of the discount from a small premium in 
2006 to its year end of 20.3%. Over the longer term, 
on all measures, we have delivered strong 
outperformance, but in particular our TSR exceeded 
our benchmark by 113.5% over a ten year period.
Review of strategy
As I mentioned in the half-year report, I took the 
opportunity on my appointment as Chief Executive 
to conduct a review of our strategy. My review 
confirmed that much at Caledonia is fit for purpose, 
but also that we need to address certain issues  
and this work is underway. The review concluded 
that we had too many investments which were  
too small, we were not using our management 
resource efficiently and that we could enhance our 
investment process. I have recommended to the 
board a series of proposals specifically aimed at 
improving, over time, our overall returns, including 
the introduction of a specific allocation to income 
producing assets. The structure of this year’s annual 
report reflects these strategic initiatives and they 
are described in more detail below. In summary, 
they involve the re-orientation of our portfolio into 
pools of capital, each reflecting an investment theme 
with clearer management responsibilities and 
objectives. We have strengthened our management 
team to introduce specific skills to manage these 
pools of capital and have refreshed our investment 
and divestment criteria, which will in due course 
result in a core portfolio of 40 to 50 investments.

To address these issues, we implemented the 
following changes:
Pools of capital
The investment portfolio has been reorganised  
into six distinct pools of capital, details of which  
are described on pages 11 to 16. These pools,  
which will form the basis of our reporting from  
now on, are:
Pool Investment manager
Current
Portfolio
Possible 
allocation
in 3-5 years
Quoted Mat Masters 34% 20-30%
Unquoted Duncan Johnson 22% 20-30%
Asia John May 13% 15-20%
Property Charles Cayzer 8% 5-10%
Funds Jamie Cayzer-Colvin 16% 10-15%
Income and 
Growth Stephen Mitchell 1% 15-20%
Cash/(debt) 6% 10-(10)%
Each pool is headed by an investment executive  
who has clear objectives and an agreed strategy. 
However, most of our existing investments continue 
to be managed by the executive responsible for its 
origination. The transition to the new pool format 
will take some time to complete. We will NOT 
manage the portfolio by strict allocation to each 
pool, though the board will review on a regular 
basis the absolute amounts with regard to upper 
limits. The probable shape of the portfolio in the 
future is shown above though, of course, events  
will continue to play a large part in our decisions. 
Geography
Caledonia’s style of investment, in taking significant 
minority positions often allied to a board seat, 
works effectively in the UK and, to a certain extent, 
Europe, but is more difficult to execute further  
afield due to differences in culture, distance and 
communication. We will however continue to invest 
directly in India. Caledonia will tend to use indirect 
means, such as funds or holding companies, to 
invest in other regions.
Dividend and the income portfolio
Caledonia is one of only a handful of companies in 
the UK that has increased its dividend every year  
for more than four decades. Over time, our strong 
capital growth has meant that our current dividend 
yield at around 2% is now too low and lags the 
market significantly. We have decided therefore to 
invest in a portfolio of large capitalisation global 
companies that offer a significant yield whilst 
retaining good medium term growth prospects.  
We believe that income will be an increasing part of 
overall return in what is likely, in the medium term, 
to be a challenging investment environment. Despite 
the considerable level of distributable reserves on 
our balance sheet, we would not consider it prudent 
to pay an uncovered dividend. Whilst it remains  
the board’s intention to raise the dividend to a 
higher base level and to continue its progressive 
nature, we will only do so when income from the  
portfolio allows.
I am confident that these initiatives will form a 
sound basis for Caledonia to improve its returns  
in the future.

Investment activity
In the year to 31 March 2011, we invested  
£106.7m and realised £180.1m. We made five new 
investments (excluding Income and Growth pool 
investments), seven follow-on investments and 
seven full disposals during the year. On the pool 
basis by which we now categorise and manage our 
portfolio, Quoted, Unquoted and Fund investments 
have been the main drivers of our performance  
over the past year, with Property producing a 
disappointing fall in value.

In a concentrated and long term portfolio such as 
ours, the main drivers of performance are the larger 
investments. To highlight the concentrated nature  
of the portfolio, we hold two investments that 
exceed £100m in value, three between £50m and 
£100m and 14 that are worth between £20m and 
£50m, together comprising 75.7% of the portfolio.  
As might be expected, most of the larger ones have 
been held for some time, though of the 19 mentioned 
above, 12 were investments made in the past eight  
years, including four within the past five years, the 
investments being sourced and made by the existing 
management team. On an individual investment 
basis, the table below highlights the principal 
contributors (measured by absolute value) to  
our performance during the year.

of the pools in the investment review section on 
pages 8 to 16.
Discount
Our discount has ranged between 13% and 23% 
during the course of the year. With the Cayzer  
family concert party owning just over 46% of our 
issued share capital, we only have limited capacity 
to undertake share buy-backs. We acknowledge  
that buy-backs are immediately NAV per share 
enhancing and will use them when there is 
exceptional value on offer for shareholders, though 
we question their longer term effect as a discount 
control mechanism. We believe that it is 
performance of the portfolio that attracts new 
investors to our register. This creates demand  
for our shares which will reduce the discount  
and I am confident that the strategic initiatives 
discussed in detail in this report will help to 
enhance our performance record.
Outlook
Caledonia retains a strong, ungeared balance sheet 
with over £100m of cash. We will continue the 
process of rebalancing the portfolio, exiting the 
smaller investments and looking in particular for 
new opportunities for the Unquoted and Asia pools. 
There is still value to be found in certain equity 
markets and we would anticipate adding 
significantly to the Income and Growth pool 
throughout the year. In the UK, the FTSE 250 looks 
expensive by historical standards, but, should there 
be a major correction in markets, we might use our 
facilities to build stakes in a number of UK quoted 
businesses that we follow closely. We have put 
significant effort into stimulating deal flow, which 
should lead to a good list of opportunities, though 
we note the very high prices currently being paid  
in unquoted markets by those needing to get funds 
deployed. This has never been our way and we will 
seek value in sound, well managed companies. We 
will continue to look for new opportunities in Asia, 
with the aim of increasing further our exposure to 
this fast growing region.
We are confident that our shareholders will benefit 
in the long run, despite a difficult economic climate.  
I would like to thank our staff for their contribution 
over the past year and welcome to our team the new 
joiners whose impact is already being felt.

Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
2013 was another period of major success 
for Kentz and represents a key milestone 
in our growth. Kentz has achieved 
exceptional organic growth in its business 
in the six years since listing and the 
acquisition of Valerus complements and 
extends that growth and provides many 
benefits to the enlarged group. 
INTRODUCTION
Kentz continued its previous 
successes in 2013 and has achieved 
exceptional organic growth in its 
business in the six years since it 
listed. That growth is complemented 
and extended by the addition to the 
Group of Valerus, whose acquisition 
marks a key milestone in our 
growth strategy. 
Overall, the 2013 results are very 
positive. We achieved our stated 
target of double digit earnings 
growth* and realised a growth of 
17.3%. This growth was attributable 
to both our ability to develop natural 
growth opportunities through 
existing relationships as well as to 
attract new business. We ended 
the year with a record backlog of 
US$3.1bn, with the backlog of the 
enlarged Group at the end of 
February 2014 having grown to 
US$4.1bn. Further, a considerable 
amount of Valerus’ contracts are 
book and burn and do not form part 
of the Group backlog. Our backlog 
continues to offer a low risk profile 
for the Group with approximately 
78% of the year-end backlog being 
cost-reimbursable. In addition to the 
orders on hand, we have a pipeline 
of prospects of US$15.6bn that 
provides confidence for the future 
and demonstrates how our broad 
service offering continues to provide 
opportunities for growth.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Our Technical Support Services 
(TSS) business unit has had an 
exceptional year, growing its 
revenues by 60% and its backlog 
by 83%. We have increased our 
revenue in the North American 
market through the expansion of our 
operations in Canada and our entry 
into Alaska. 
Construction remains our largest and 
our core business unit and has had 
exceptional success in winning new 
projects. Our construction team 
has established new operations in 
Colombia and added further success 
with a new contract at the Ichthys 
LNG project in Australia. In February 
2014, we were awarded the 
US$640m structural, mechanical 
and piping construction contract 
in a 50:50 joint venture with UGL

Resources. There has been further 
bidding activity on other sizeable 
contracts at Ichthys which are due for 
award in the first half of 2014. 
Our strategy to grow EPC both 
organically and inorganically has 
achieved great success in 2013. The 
additional leadership, technical and 
sales resources have delivered a 30% 
increase in legacy EPC backlog, 
positioning us for significant growth 
in 2014 and beyond. The acquisition 
of Valerus has increased our technical 
capabilities, introduced us to a new 
client base and built a critical mass in 
the Americas region. We expect to 
deliver future growth through joint 
business winning opportunities.
CORPORATE ACTIVITY
During the year, the Group received 
approaches from two parties 
expressing their interest in acquiring 
the entire share capital of Kentz. As 
stated in our announcement in 
August, the Board of Kentz met and 
discussed these approaches, taking 
into account the growth plans that 
we had and the resulting value we 
saw for our shareholders. Having 
performed detailed analysis and 
receiving assistance from our 
advisors, the Board unanimously 
rejected each of these approaches 
and subsequently the interest from 
these parties ceased. The Board 
maintains that it made the correct 
decision and, as evidenced by our 
success through the latter half of the 
year, acted in the best interests of 
our shareholders.
SAFETY
In 2013, we worked a total of 
46,364,322 man-hours, and at 
0.14, our full year Total Recordable 
Incident Rate (TRIR) was down 26% 
from 2012’s TRIR of 0.19. Safety 
continues to be our core value, 
with the safety and health of all our 
employees being of vital importance 
to the organisation. Safety is also a 
paramount value of our clients and 
we work closely with each client to 
ensure that safety is given priority on 
all project sites to ensure that no one 
gets hurt and everyone goes home 
safe and well. 
PEOPLE
Kentz prides itself on the integrity, 
dedication, technical excellence and 
teamwork of all its employees. The 
strong workforce and teamwork 
provides for effective collaboration 
between business units and ensures 
that clients’ needs are fulfilled in the 
most efficient manner. I would like 
to thank all of our staff for their 
continued support, commitment 
and hard work. Our future 
accomplishments depend on our 
people and I have no doubt we have 
the people, skills and ambition to 
continue our success and realise 
further value for all our stakeholders. 
STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
In 2013, we began to implement 
the strategic initiatives to build our 
business capabilities and continue 
our exceptional performance. 
Acquiring engineering capability was 
a key objective that was met with the 
acquisition of Valerus Field Solutions 
on 3 January 2014. This new addition 
to the Kentz Group provides many 
benefits as well as opportunities 
to grow the Group through the 
expansion of the client bases of both 
entities and the global reach of the 
combined Group. We are continuing 
to implement the other initiatives 
and have made good progress 
already on many of these. 
The outlook for Kentz remains very 
positive. I am confident that 2014 will 
be a very busy and successful year. 
We have a strong order book and an 
abundance of opportunities that 
exist for our services in our core 
markets. We also have a strong 
workforce to execute these projects 
with the ultimate aim of creating 
further value for our shareholders.

ACQUISITION OF VALERUS  
FIELD SOLUTIONS
We were very pleased to announce 
the proposed acquisition of Valerus 
Field Solutions (Valerus) in early 
December. Our strategy for EPC 
has been to expand our ability to 
provide EPC for small to medium 
onshore process facilities. The 
acquisition of Valerus provides a 
number of benefits to Kentz such 
as process engineering expertise to 
pursue further EPC opportunities, 
material entry into the US and 
Latin American markets, new 
clients and opportunities to sell 
Kentz’s services. 
The addition of Valerus to the Kentz 
Group brings 665 people including 
198 with demonstrable experience 
in gas handling and processing. 
Valerus is a strongly performing 
business with a track record of 
delivering high margins. One of 
the main aims of the transaction 
is to expand its service offering 
geographically through the broad 
network of Kentz’s operations. The 
business development teams from 
Kentz and Valerus are already 
engaging with each other to 
identify opportunities for the 
enlarged Group. 
The Board of Kentz believes that, 
consistent with our strategy, the 
acquisition of Valerus will help to 
establish Kentz as a recognised 
market leader in providing highly 
skilled process engineering, 
Engineering Procurement 
Construction Management 
(EPCM) and EPC services for 
small and medium sized oil and gas 
processing facilities worldwide.

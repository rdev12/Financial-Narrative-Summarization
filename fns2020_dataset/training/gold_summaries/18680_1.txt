STRATEGIC REPORT
It has been another good year for 
Helical with returns from its portfolio 
reaffirming the Group’s multi-sectoral 
and multi-disciplined approach to the 
property cycle. 
This involves identifying opportunities across the 
property spectrum which contribute to a regular 
and increasing flow of rental income as well as 
creating capital growth and development profits 
throughout the cycle. We seek a balance between 
an investment portfolio that provides income for 
the Group and a development programme that, 
through the use of limited equity, seeks to 
maximise returns. This balance currently targets, 
and has achieved, an investment portfolio 
representing at least 75% of our total property 
assets and a development programme covering 
the remaining 25% which is capable of producing 
exceptional profits. The portfolio is primarily 
targeted towards London for capital growth and 
development profits and the regions for high 
yielding investment assets and trading profits.
Results for the year
The profit before tax for the year to 31 March 
2015 was £87 .4m, the second highest in the 
Group’s history following last year’s record pre-tax 
profits of £101.7m. Total property return 
increased by 10.8% to £155.3m (2014: 
£140.1m) and included growing net rents of 
£38.6m (up 30% on 2014) and development 
profits of £17 .6m (2014: £65.0m). The gain on 
sale and revaluation of the investment portfolio 
contributed £96.6m (2014: £45.0m) and there 
were trading profits of £2.5m (2014: £0.3m). 
Net finance costs of £21.2m were significantly 
higher than in 2014 (£12.7m), with the Income 
Statement also adversely affected by falls in 
expected future interest rates which led to an 
£8.4m charge arising from valuing the Group’s 
derivative financial instruments (2014: a gain of 
£5.3m) and a £3.3m charge from valuing the 
£100m Convertible Bond issued in June 2014. 
Recurring administration costs were higher at 
£10.2m (2014: £8.8m) with increased numbers 
of head office employees reflecting the growth of 
the Group’s portfolio and the acceleration of the 
delivery phase of its development programme. 
Performance related awards, before national 
insurance costs, reflecting the success of the 
Group’s activities in the year were £13.4m, down 
from £15.7m in 2014. 
The growth in rents and the surpluses on the 
investment portfolio contributed to an increase in 
the EPRA net asset value per share to 385p, up 
23% from 313p at 31 March 2014. EPRA 
earnings per share were 2.4p (2014: 33.3p) 
reflecting the exclusion of the £96.6m (2014: 
£45.0m) investment portfolio gain from this 
measure. These results allow the Board to 
continue its progressive dividend policy and to 
recommend to shareholders a final dividend of 
5.15p, an increase of 8.4% on 2014 (4.75p), 
taking the total for the year to 7 .25p (2014: 
6.75p), an overall increase of 7 .4%.
The London Portfolio
The London investment and development portfolio 
continues to combine exceptional contributions 
from individual schemes with significant progress 
in delivering the Group’s programme of new and 
refurbished properties. 
At Clifton Street, London EC2, we have forward 
sold an office development of 45,000 sq ft which 
is due to complete this summer, for £38.25m, having 
committed to purchase it on completion for £21.0m. 
At Barts Square, London EC1, our scheme in joint 
venture with The Baupost Group LLC, we have 
exchanged contracts for sale, at an average of 
£1,574 psf, on 64 of the 92 residential units 
released in September 2014 from phase one of 
the development, which commenced in January 
2015 and is due for completion in summer 2017 . 
Subsequent phases will commence in 2016. 
At The Bower, Old Street, London EC1, our joint 
venture with Crosstree Real Estate Partners LLP, 
we expect to complete phase one, the refurbishment 
and extension of The Warehouse (122,000 sq ft 
NIA of offices, 5,300 sq ft of restaurant use) and 
The Studio (18,363 sq ft of offices, 3,7 46 sq ft of 
restaurant use) by summer 2015 having pre-let 
Empire House (20,726 sq ft) to Z Hotels and 
restaurant Ceviche who carried out their own 
refurbishment works. The second phase, a 
complete refurbishment of The Tower at 207 Old 
Street, is due to commence in summer 2015. At 
C-Space, London EC1 we expect to complete the 
refurbishment in August 2015 and are confident 
that the whole building will be let by the end of 
this year.

Our 271,000 sq ft office development at One 
Creechurch Place, London EC3, equity funded 
with our joint venture partner HOOPP (Healthcare 
of Ontario Pension Plan), is under construction 
and due for completion in September 2016. At 
23-28 Charterhouse Square, London EC1 we 
have acquired an existing office building which 
will comprise 38,600 sq ft of offices and 5,350 sq 
ft of retail/restaurant use on completion of 
refurbishment works in late 2016.
At Shepherds Building, London W14, having 
completed the refurbishment of the common 
parts, we have recently let space at £47 .50 psf 
which compares to a current average passing rent 
of £30.50 psf. At New Loom House, London E1, 
we continue to refurbish space as it becomes 
available and are achieving rents of £37 .50 psf 
compared to an average rent on acquisition of this 
building in 2013 of £18 psf. In 2015 we shall be 
embarking on a substantial refurbishment 
programme which will provide a new entrance and 
refresh many of the common parts of the building. 
At Artillery Lane, London E1 we expect to 
complete the comprehensive refurbishment of this 
17 ,000 sq ft office building in September 2015, 
following which we will complete the sale of the 
building at an agreed price of £15.1m. 
This level of asset management activity has 
contributed to a 27% valuation increase of the 
London investment portfolio, which is now valued 
at £370m (47% of the total investment portfolio). 
Passing rents on the portfolio are £9.3m, but will 
grow over the next few years towards its ERV, 
now estimated to be £28.1m. 
The Regional Portfolio
The regional investment and development portfolio 
provides a growing stream of net rents from a high 
yielding investment portfolio whilst contributing 
development surpluses from the retirement village 
and retail development programmes. The 
investment portfolio has seen a major switch out of 
secondary retail assets, acquired in 2010 and 
2011, into high yielding distribution warehouses, 
regional offices and out-of-town retail parks. We 
have sold our shopping centres at Corby T own 
Centre; Clyde Shopping Centre; The Guineas, 
Newmarket; Idlewells Shopping Centre, Sutton-in-
Ashfield and T own Square Basildon. We now retain 
just one in-town retail investment asset at The 
Morgan Quarter, Cardiff, a prime retail asset 
opposite the St David’s Shopping Centre. We have 
reinvested the proceeds into 44 new regional 
assets, primarily distribution warehouses 
throughout the country but also offices in 
Manchester, Bristol, Cobham and out-of-town retail 
park units in Harrogate, Stockport, Great Y armouth, 
Southend, Stoke-on-Trent and other locations. 
The regional portfolio also includes our retirement 
village development programme where we have 
continued construction works at Durrants Village 
Horsham, Millbrook Village Exeter and Maudslay 
Park Great Alne near Stratford-upon-Avon. During 
the year we sold 36 residential units and look 
forward to the opening of the Clubhouse at 
Durrants Village later this year. Our retail 
development programme, with partners Oswin 
Developments, continues to progress schemes at 
Truro, Cortonwood, Kingswinford and Evesham 
having completed its scheme at Shirley, West 
Midlands. 
Finance
The £100m 4% Convertible Bond, issued in June 
2014, continued the move away from the use of 
secured borrowings which started in 2013 with 
the issue of the £80m 6% Retail Bond. The issue 
of these two financing instruments allowed the 
Group to increase its investment in the property 
market without significant dilution of existing 
shareholders and without putting pressure on the 
Group’s loan covenants. We draw a distinction 
between secured borrowings, on which we have a 
net L TV (loan to value) of 34% and unsecured 
forms of debt i.e. our Retail and Convertible 
Bonds, which increase our overall L TV to 52%. 
During the year we agreed a 10 year facility with 
Aviva Commercial Finance and extended our 
revolving credit facilities with Barclays and, since 
the year end, with RBS, whilst taking advantage 
of the low interest rates to arrange medium to 
long term interest rate hedging. The effect of 
these financial arrangements has been to extend 
the average debt maturity to 4.3 years (2014: 3.9 
years) whilst reducing our average cost of debt to 
4.1% (2014: 4.5%). The Group continues to have 
a significant level of cash and unutilised bank 
facilities at the year end of £229m (2014: 
£186m) to fund any additional purchases and 
capital works on its portfolio. 
Outlook
Our strategy of investing and developing in London 
whilst maintaining a high yielding regional investment 
programme continues to bear fruit. We expect our 
London portfolio to continue to provide significant 
surpluses over the next few years as rental levels 
grow and we complete and let our development 
schemes. In the regions, we have completed our 
rotation out of secondary shopping centres and into 
high yielding distribution warehouses, regional offices 
and out-of-town retail parks. We have seen good 
demand from occupiers for the assets in our portfolio 
and strong interest in those types of assets from 
institutions. This is leading to a rise in both rental and 
capital values as the UK economy strengthens 
outside London.
With the General Election behind us we can look 
forward with confidence to a more stable domestic 
political situation, which should help the UK economy 
to grow, and we anticipate providing shareholders 
with continued strong growth in the value of our 
business.

increase in
long-term
contracted
revenue
2003: £97.8m
2002: £71.9m
During 2002 we announced
the costly but necessary
closure of our operations in
France, and the reduction of
operations in Germany to the
now profitable Frankfurt
Carrier Ring. These decisions
were successfully executed
well within our budgeted costs
during 2003, and I am pleased
to report a year of considerable
progress for the Group.
The strength of Fibernet’s core
business is that existing and
new customer revenues are
derived from long term
(typically 3-7 years) contracts
with predominantly blue chip
organisations from both our
Enterprise and Service
Provider target markets.
Revenue is recognised evenly
over the contract period.
During the year ended 31 August
2003, we signed a further £58.0m
of such long-term contracts;
an increase of £21.3m from the
level of £36.7m signed last year .
These new contract wins exclude
the positive effects of contract
renewals with existing customers.
The value of our long-term
contracted revenue as at 
31 August 2003 was £97.8m,
an increase of £25.9m over the
prior period comparative of
£71.9m. Of this contracted
revenue, £28.8m is expected to
be recognised in the year ending
31 August 2004, an improvement
of £6.8m over the prior year
comparative of £22.0m
Y ou will see, however , that full-year
revenues from continuing
operations of £36.3m are 1%
below the £36.7m from the
previous year . Previous year
revenues included a one-off
amount of £2.3m derived from
early cancellation of a customer
contract.
During 2003 we reduced the
costs of our UK organisation,
achieved significant exceptional
and ongoing savings, including
a rebate from the renegotiation
of our national business rates
charge. Loss before tax was
£5.0m compared to £92.4m
in the prior year .
EBITDA from continuing
operations, before exceptional
items increased by 46% to
£7.3m for the current year as
compared to £5.0m in the prior
period. Including the effects
of exceptional items, EBITDA
increased to £11.4m.
We finished the year with a cash
balance of £24.9m, against
£34.3m last year . Although our
cash balance is expected to
reduce in 2004, we remain
confident that we have substantial
cash headroom to execute our
business plan.
We have achieved significant
progress during 2003. Our
strategy has remained the same.
We continue to provide
specialised high value services
to large Enterprise customers
along with cost effective, flexible
and innovative products to
Service Providers. We have the
financial strength to continue
to execute this strategy and are
optimistic for the future.

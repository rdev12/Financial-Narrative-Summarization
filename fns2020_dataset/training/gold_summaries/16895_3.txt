Terry Stannard Non-executive Chairman
Overview
I am delighted to report that the excellent progress achieved in the 
first half of the year continued throughout the second half, giving 
an impressive outcome for the year. The Company’s brands achieved 
their highest ever level of sales during the autumn selling period, 
reflecting the strength of our recent product launches, the 
desirability of our brands and the positive trends in the luxury 
interior goods market.
Revenue and profits continued to grow during the second half, 
and our balance sheet strengthened further. Net debt reduced 
despite our continued investment in the business and return to 
dividend payments.
Revenues for the year grew by 13.9% to £68.78 million with all 
segments of the Group achieving growth over last year. Gross margins 
improved from 59.7% to 60.2%, which, combined with continued 
investment in product and marketing, has led to an increase of 77% 
in operating profit before exceptional items of £4.47 million.
Our Brands segment grew by 11.7% with all of our brands 
performing well, including a significant improvement in Zoffany. 
Sanderson led the way with growth of 17%, following strong 
investment in product during its 150th anniversary year. In our 
largest market, the UK, retail income grew by 13%. In the Rest of the 
World it grew by 21%, led by the Far East. Our global licence income 
grew 30% led by Japan and Australasia and with a significant 
improvement from our UK bedlinen licencee.
The Overseas segment includes our North American and French 
operating companies. Both these businesses achieved growth over last 
year and, following the disposal of our Italian business to our Italian 
distributor B&B Distribuzionne in December 2009, sales in Italy have 
grown significantly. Investment in marketing has increased substantially 
in the USA, following a very cautious approach the previous year.
The Manufacturing segment grew 30% over last year with third 
party revenues growing by 28% as customers continued to invest 
in new product and built stock levels.
Financials
Revenue increased 13.9% to £68.78 million from £60.38 million. The 
operating profit for the year grew 106% to £4.97 million (2010: £2.42 
million) which included the benefit of an insurance settlement of 
£0.50 million from a loss of profits claim. Profit before tax grew 188% 
to £4.46 million (2010: £1.55 million). The profit after tax increased 
158% to £3.03 million (2010: £1.17 million).
Earnings per share were 5.36p (2010: 2.10p) an increase of 155%.

The Group’s net indebtedness at the year end reduced to £1.82 
million (2010: £3.11 million). This represents a reduction in gearing 
to 8% (2010: 17%). The cash inflow from operating activities was 
£4.26 million (2010: £4.34 million), reflecting strong operating profits 
with lower interest costs but a significant investment in product. 
Following a negotiation and extension of the Group’s banking 
facilities for a further three years the Group’s headroom increased 
to £10.56 million (2010: £9.28 million).
Dividend
During the year, the Group has paid a final dividend for the year to 
31 January 2010 and an interim dividend of 0.15p. The Group will 
continue to invest in the future growth of the business and continue 
to pay dividends. The Directors recommend the payment of a final 
dividend of 0.80 pence per share (2010: 0.50p) which will be payable 
on 6 August 2011 to shareholders on the register on 8 July 2011. This 
brings the total dividend for the year to 0.95p (2010: 0.50p).
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our management 
and employees for their contribution to an extremely successful year.
Outlook
Our impressive performance during the year to 31 January 2011 
reflects the strength of our brands and strategic importance of our 
manufacturing capability amid positive trends in the luxury interior 
furnishings market.
The current year has started well, with our brand sales up 8% in the 
first quarter of the year compared with the same period last year.
We remain focused on winning further market share in established 
markets and on developing our sales overseas, where the heritage 
of our brands has significant appeal. We are encouraged by sales 
last year in countries including Russia and China, which underlines 
our international potential.
We are confident of a positive outcome for the year.

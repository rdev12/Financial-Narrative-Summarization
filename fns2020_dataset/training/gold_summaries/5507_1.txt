ENQUEST VALUES
PASSION
With the right level of passion people remain motivated and 
energised to perform at the highest level. I am passionate 
about my performance, continuously challenging the way I, 
and the organisation do things. This is important when working 
at EnQuest. Passionate people work hard to chase the next 
result, and will go that extra yard to deliver. 
DEREK ELLINGTON, HEATHER OPERATIONS MANAGER
EnQuest’s performance, business model and strategy
EnQuest’s core competency in controlling costs and managing 
operations efficiently is particularly important in the current climate 
of low oil prices. Despite challenging macro conditions, EnQuest 
delivered a strong operational performance in 2014, with production 
of 27,895 Boepd, whilst EBITDA was $581 million. 2014 was a record 
year for production and was up 15% on the prior year. The acquisition 
of the Seligi and PM8 oil fields in Malaysia provided EnQuest with its 
first contribution from outside the North Sea, countering the impact 
of delay to the Alma/Galia project. 
EnQuest delivered an increase in its net 2P reserve base, up by 
25.2 MMboe to 220.0 MMboe, reflecting a reserve replacement 
ratio of approximately 350% for 2014. The increase resulted partly 
from positive revisions to reserve estimates from infill drilling and 
an improved knowledge of the reservoirs. Approval of the Ythan 
discovery for development, and the promotion of the Scolty and 
Crathes discoveries following development planning, also 
contributed to the increase in EnQuest’s reserve base. Further 
additions arose from 2014 acquisitions, including interests in the 
Greater Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’) and PM8/Seligi in Malaysia. 
During the latter part of 2014, EnQuest acted quickly to counter 
the impact of a rapid decline in oil prices, increasing the hedging 
programme and significantly cutting 2015 cash capital expenditure 
to c.$600 million, with reductions from both developments and 
existing fields. We are targeting a reduction in EnQuest’s operating 
cost per barrel of c.10%, from $42.1/boe in 2014 to an average of 
c.$38/boe in 2015. This is being achieved through lower cost barrels 
coming onstream, reducing opex per barrel in newly acquired fields, 
and through substantial direct cost savings. We are targeting cost 
savings across the business, through the supply chain and by 
improving efficiencies in our operations, through maximising 
production and minimising waste. We have cut limited company 
contractor rates and reduced our headcount in the UK and logistics 
costs are down significantly. This agile focused approach enabled 
EnQuest to hold unit operating costs flat during its first five years, 
while average costs in the North Sea doubled. EnQuest continues to 
work with the supply chain and contractors to achieve further cost 
savings and optimisation. 
Given the low oil price environment, EnQuest negotiated a 
relaxation of covenants to its revolving credit facility until mid-2017. 
This continued commitment from our lenders recognises the cash 
flow generation of EnQuest’s business and in particular the 
expected increases in cash flow from the Alma/Galia and Kraken 
developments.
EnQuest has achieved a 173% increase in net oil reserves over the last 
five years, having converted more than half of the original reserves 
into flowing barrels. Despite the reductions to the investment 
programme, EnQuest remains on course to achieve annual net 
production from the UK North Sea of 50,000 Boepd, with six 
operated producing hubs in the UK. In Malaysia, PM8/Seligi has the 
potential to increase international production significantly over the 
coming years. 
Health, safety, environment and assurance (‘HSE&A’)
In 2014, EnQuest met its commitment to deliver safe results, with 
the best HSE performance since formation in April 2010. EnQuest 
achieved a Lost-Time Incident Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’) of zero and 
a Recordable Incident Frequency Rate (‘RIFR’) below the industry 
average. There were no High Potential Incidents (‘HIPO’s): the last 
recorded HIPO was in April 2013.
In addition, the producing northern North Sea assets achieved a 
total of 11 years without a Lost-Time Incident (‘LTI’) and 11 million 
man hours LTI-free. Health and Safety Executive inspections were 
performed on all the assets, and no major issues were identified. 
These results are a testament to the focus given to HSE&A. 
North Sea operations
In 2014, EnQuest delivered good production of 24,436 Boepd in 
the UK, marginally ahead of the 24,222 Boepd in 2013. This reflects 
the continuing strength of field reservoir performance and high 
production efficiency from EnQuest’s existing UK assets. With 
production efficiency from existing assets averaging 88% in 2014, 
EnQuest is likely to have further improved its position in the Oil & 
Gas UK rankings.
EnQuest delivered 12 wells in 2014, including successful wells at 
Heather and Don South West. At the Dons, the Ythan development 
in Don North East, moved from licence award, through Field 
Development Plan submission and approval, to spudding of the 
first well in less than 12 months. The Thistle life extension project 
continued to improve production levels in 2014. Thistle produced 
over three million barrels of oil for the first time since 1997. The 
Greater Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’) assets were acquired early in 2014. 
Subsequent to the acquisition of GKA, the discovery of Avalon 
further enhanced the potential of GKA.  20 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2014

North Sea developments
Alma/Galia 
During 2014, both the subsea and the drilling programmes for the 
Alma/Galia project were delivered on time. By the end of the year, 
five production wells were fully completed and ready for tie-in and 
the subsea infrastructure was in place. However, delays to the 
programme for the Floating Production, Storage and Offloading 
vessel (‘FPSO’, the ‘EnQuest Producer’) had moved the earliest 
possible ‘sailaway’ date into the winter months. This would have 
significantly increased the operational risks and costs of waiting for 
appropriate weather conditions. Sailaway and first oil were therefore 
rescheduled to spring 2015 and to mid-2015 respectively. Since 
August 2014, the FPSO construction has remained on track and 
following first oil, initial net peak production of c.13,000 Boepd is 
expected, significantly increasing EnQuest’s production profile. 
Plateau unit operating cost is expected to be approximately $15/bbl 
to $20/bbl. 
Delays and cost increases for the EnQuest Producer initially 
stemmed from changes to the implementation of safety codes, 
such as for moorings and also other regulatory imposed scope 
changes. The extent of work required on the vessel was also 
greater than anticipated. 
The FPSO is essentially now a new vessel with all the topsides 
having been replaced. Ownership of the vessel at first oil provides 
EnQuest with a range of additional funding options, such as a 
potential sale and leaseback. 
EnQuest’s net 2P reserves for Alma/Galia increased slightly to 
c.26 MMboe at the start of 2015, following the positive results 
from the wells which have been drilled. 
Kraken 
During 2014, the Kraken project progressed well, on budget and 
on schedule. 
In Q2 2014, the FPSO donor vessel arrived at the shipyard in 
Singapore and its conversion scope commenced. In H2 2014, 
EnQuest commenced installation of the subsea structures at the 
first drill centre, where the initial wells for the development will be 
drilled. Detailed engineering, procurement and manufacture for all 
equipment relating to wells, subsea infrastructure and the FPSO 
continued throughout 2014.
With the Kraken project on budget, its anticipated net capital 
expenditure estimate is unchanged at $1.4 billion to first oil. The full 
cycle breakeven cost for the project continues to be in the region of 
$55/bbl. In addition, with $512 million invested to the end of 2014, 
the forward economics of the 25 year life project are strong with an 
internal rate of return in the mid thirties per cent, net to EnQuest 
using the forward curve in early March 2015. 
North Sea acquisitions
In Q1 2014, EnQuest applied for and was offered an ‘out of round’ 
licence in the Don North East area (‘Don NE’) for blocks 211/18e 
and 211/19c. This included the Area 23 and Area 24 discovered oil 
accumulations and an undrilled extension to the Don NE field. 
Following the award of this licence a Field Development Plan for 
‘Ythan’ was submitted and approved.
In Q1 2014, EnQuest announced the acquisition of the Greater 
Kittiwake Area assets. The acquisition fits within the goals of 
managing mature fields and of exploiting nearby discoveries and near 
field exploration opportunities. The Scolty and Crathes discoveries 
are within the GKA area, with potential to benefit from a tie-back to 
Kittiwake. The combination of these opportunities also facilitates the 
extension of the GKA field life itself.
The base consideration for the acquisition was $39.9 million, 
which following working capital and other adjustments resulted 
in the payment of a cash consideration of $30.3 million. When the 
acquisition was announced, the additional net 2P reserves were 
recorded as 4.7 MMboe as at the economic date of 1 January 2013. 
Following GKA post acquisition production of a net 0.5 million barrels 
of oil in 2014, EnQuest recorded net 2P reserves of c.8 MMbbls in 
GKA as at the end of 2014. Reasons for the net increase included not 
only the addition of Scolty/Crathes, but also improved performance 
and the lengthening of the field life. 
In Q4 2014, EnQuest was offered and accepted eight licences as 
part of the UK 28th North Sea licensing round.

EMPOWERMENT
Empowerment means that I work within a culture that gives 
me the authority to do my job to the best of my ability, with full 
understanding of EnQuest’s vision and drivers. Empowerment is 
important to EnQuest as it promotes autonomy and nimbleness 
within the Company, gives us an edge on our competitors, 
permits rapid response to the ever changing circumstances we 
experience and allows individuals to develop and grow.

International
2014 was a transformational year for EnQuest’s international 
business, particularly with the acquisition of the PM8/Seligi fields, 
delivering our first production from outside the North Sea. 
In Q2 2014, EnQuest announced the signing of a small field risk 
service contract with Petroliam Nasional Berhad (‘Petronas’), the 
national oil company for Malaysia, for the development and 
production of petroleum from the Tanjong Baram field offshore 
Sarawak, Malaysia. Start-up is expected in mid-2015. Separately, the 
Kitabu prospect, was drilled in Q1 2014, however the well failed to 
encounter hydrocarbons; this was in the SB307/SB308 contract area 
where EnQuest has a non-operated interest.
Later in Q2 2014, EnQuest announced a significant expansion 
of its footprint in Malaysia, through the acquisition of the PM8 
Production Sharing Contract (‘PSC’) fields and the Seligi oil field, 
from ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Malaysia Inc; both 
EnQuest and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd to hold participating 
interests. EnQuest also signed an agreement with Petronas to 
extend the term of the PSC, comprising PM8 PSC assets and the 
Seligi oil field to 2033 (formally ‘PM8 PSC (Extension)’ or simply 
‘PM8/Seligi’). This acquisition has a good strategic fit and offers 
considerable potential for EnQuest to use its core skills in enhancing 
value from maturing fields. 
The base consideration for the acquisition was $67.0 million, which 
following interim period adjustments resulted in the payment of a 
cash consideration of $24.7 million. Following strong production of 
a net 0.8 million barrels of oil in 2014, EnQuest recorded net 2P 
reserves of c.15 MMbbls in PM8/Seligi as at the end of 2014. In 
December 2014, following a short transition period, EnQuest took 
over operatorship and is working on an ongoing programme to 
target further efficiency improvements and to maximise recovery. 
Production in the last six months of 2014 was approximately 7,000 
Boepd net, on a working interest basis and this continued to 
improve into 2015. 
In February 2015, EnQuest announced that it had exited from its 
small investment in Tunisia, retention of which had been subject to 
conditions which were not satisfied within the relevant timeframe. 
Consideration of $22 million had been kept in escrow and was duly 
returned to EnQuest. 
In 2014, EnQuest was offered and accepted 2 licences as part 
of the 2014 Awards in Pre-Defined Areas (‘APA’) Norwegian 
Licensing Round.
Financial performance 
In 2014, EnQuest generated EBITDA of $581 million, benefiting from 
further action taken on costs in H2 2014 and also from its full year 
currency hedging programme. 
Following the delays to the Alma/Galia project in early 2014, 
EnQuest’s net capex cost for the first phase of the project is 
expected to be c.$55/bbl.
EnQuest’s funding facilities include c.$900 million of bonds and a 
committed credit facility of $1.2 billion plus an accordion of up to a 
further $500 million. 2014 year end net debt was $933 million, with 
$218 million drawn on the credit facility utilisation before taking into 
account cash balances. 
Total full year 2014 unit operating costs of $42.1 per barrel reflected 
the initial benefit of cost reduction initiatives taken in H2 2014 and 
the lower exchange rate and generally a year of good operational 
performance and strong control of direct costs. 
There were non-cash post-tax impairments of $335.3 million, due to 
lower near term oil price assumptions.
2015 year to date
EnQuest has performed well at the start of 2015; production 
efficiency has again been very strong on our North Sea assets and 
our focus on operational efficiencies in PM8/Seligi has been 
delivering excellent daily production. 
The EnQuest Producer programme is proceeding according to 
schedule in Q1 2015; the boilers were ignited and fired, notice 
was given to moor and hook up the vessel in the field. The FPSO 
recently left the yard in Newcastle, and has successfully completed 
marine performance trials in deeper water nearby, on schedule for 
first oil from Alma/Galia in the middle of this year. 
The drilling of an appraisal well in Kraken West has confirmed 
the presence of oil, with potential for upside. Further evaluation 
is ongoing. 
 
Hedging for 2015 was already in place and hedging is now also in 
place for 2016, currently with 10 million barrels hedged through puts 
averaging c.$68 per barrel in 2016. 
Outlook for the rest of 2015 and beyond
EnQuest is focused on performance and execution. Safety will always 
be a priority and we are focused on operational efficiency and further 
reducing costs. Alma/Galia is on track for first production in the 
middle of the year. Production for 2015 is expected to be an average 
of between 33,000 Boepd and 36,000 Boepd, a 24% increase over 
2014 at the mid-point of the range. With unit operating expenditure 
of approximately $15/bbl to $20/bbl during the period of initial net 
peak volumes, Alma/Galia will also contribute towards a reduction in 
EnQuest’s 2015 unit operating costs of c.10% over 2014. 
2015 priorities also include delivering the $600 million cash capital 
expenditure programme, focused on the Kraken development 
project. The drilling programme has been rationalised to existing 
commitments and to projects with high margin barrels, including the 
drilling of three low cost near field production wells on Thistle, a 
Gadwall sidetrack and bringing Alma/Galia onstream. 
In Malaysia, the 2015 work programme on PM8/Seligi will be 
focused on well intervention activities and improving the field 
infrastructure. For Tanjong Baram, the implementation of our 
development plan is well underway, with first oil targeted by the end 
of H1 2015. 
In Q1 2015, covenants of the credit facility were relaxed giving 
significant flexibility in a lower oil price environment. EnQuest’s focus 
in 2015 will be on near term profitable cash flow and optimising the 
long term value of the business. If the low oil price environment 
continues, then beyond existing development commitments, capital 
expenditure will continue to be rationalised.
The speed and size of changes made to the business in response 
to deteriorating energy market conditions was achieved through 
the agility and focus inherent in EnQuest’s business model. EnQuest 
delivers material improvements to mature fields and we will continue 
doing so in 2015 and beyond.

POSITIONED
Kazakhstan is an ideal location for the 
development of natural resources, combining 
mineral wealth with ready access to the 
necessary factors of production and sharing  
a land border with China, the largest market 
for commodities in the world. 
Kazakhstan continues to attract significant foreign 
direct investment, including a strong partnership  
with China, for the development of natural resources 
under the ‘one belt one road’ investment programme.
WHY KAZAKHSTAN?
1. Stable socio-political environment
2. Experienced mining workforce
3.  Direct access to key markets – China  
and Europe
4.  Established infrastructure and  
transport links
5. Availability of water
6. Access to energy at a competitive cost
OUR STRATEGY
KAZ Minerals’ vision is to be the leading natural 
resources company in Central Asia. By 2018 we  
aim to produce over 300 kt of copper, with 80%  
of that production coming from our new open  
pit mines. In 2015 we have made significant progress  
in delivering on our three strategic priorities:
Operating mine
Major growth project
Rail connections

 Sdi Group plc Annu Al report And Accounts 2009 04
cHairman’S Statement
I am pleased to present 
SDi Group plc’s results for the 
16 months ended 31 March 2009.
Whilst current trading conditions 
for retailers throughout Europe 
remain challenging, our recently 
announced contract wins confirm 
that the services and solutions we 
provide deliver real cost savings 
by driving operating efficiencies 
and create a sustainable platform 
for our customers to compete in 
this market. 
We have taken a number 
of steps during the period to 
improve our offer, efficiency and 
balance sheet. The acquisition of 
p .E.p beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh 
(‘pEp’) in april 2008 was undertaken 
to provide the Group with improved 
access to key European markets 
and leading edge products and 
solutions. The integration of this 
business is complete and has 
allowed us to have a more 
consistent offer to our markets 
based around these industry 
leading technologies. 
The company is now much 
better placed than before the 
acquisition to compete across 
all of our markets.
We have also reviewed operations 
in all of the subsidiary companies 
to ensure we are able to offer the 
right products and services for 
each market. This has resulted 
in cost reductions in all of the 
subsidiary companies and a 
redeployment of resources. 
The Group now has a more 
sustainable cost base and 
operating model.
The Board’s decision to 
sell the US businesses has 
resulted in the removal of its losses 
from the Group’s results as well 
as in an important cash injection 
to the remaining Group. As a 
result, the board has been able 
to focus on the remaining parts 
of the Group which has resulted 
in a more cohesive sales and 
management process.
FinancialS and Key 
perFormance indicatorS
The disposal of the US businesses 
was completed on 22 December 
2008. consequently, the results 
for the 16 months ended 
31 March 2009 disclose the results 
of the disposed subsidiaries for the 
period in the c onsolidated income 
statement as ‘Loss on discontinued 
activities’. comparative figures for 
the year ended 30 November 2007 
have been restated to disclose the 
results of the disposed subsidiaries 
as ‘profit on discontinued activities’. 
The comparative results for the year 
ended 30 November 2007 therefore 
represent the five months of trading 
of the remaining companies from 
the date of the Group reorganisation 
on 2 July 2007.
Revenue for the 16 month period 
ended 31 March 2009 was £53.1m 
(year ended 30 November 2007: 
£14.9m), the increase reflecting 
the shorter reporting period in 2007 
and the acquisition of PEP in 
april 2008. Gross profit margins 
decreased to 15.4% (year ended 
30 November 2007: 30.3%) as a 
result of difficult market conditions 
and a number of innovative projects

undertaken at lower margin during 
the period for new customers which 
has enabled the Group to develop 
hardware and software solutions 
which will be of benefit going forward. 
administration expenses, excluding 
exceptional items, increased to £8.8m 
(year ended 30 November 2007: 
£2.5m), which again reflects the 
longer reporting period under review 
and the acquisition of PEP during 
the period.
The operating loss, before 
exceptional items, was £0.7m 
(year ended 30 November 2007: 
profit £2.1m) and loss before tax, 
after exceptional items, was £1.6m 
(year ended 30 November 2007: 
profit £1.1m). The exceptional 
items include amortisation of 
sales order backlog arising on 
consolidation of £0.5m and £0.6m 
of redundancy costs incurred in 
the uK as a result of the closure 
of a maintenance department 
arising on the administration of 
our customer. These costs have 
been fully provided and are not 
expected to continue.
The disposed US subsidiaries 
recorded a loss after tax on 
operations for the twelve months 
ended 30 November 2008 prior 
to the disposal of £4.5m, which 
is included in the consolidated 
income statement under ‘Loss on 
discontinued activities’. The Group 
also recorded a loss on the 
restatement of assets to fair value 
of £6.6m, which represents the 
difference between net asset value 
and the proceeds received from 
the sale. 
The cash position and 
balance sheet remain strong, 
with the Group’s cash and cash 
equivalents at 31 March 2009 of 
£5.8m (30 November 2007: £10.1m).
The retained loss for the period 
after tax, exceptional items and 
including the loss on discontinued 
activities was £12.3m (year ended 
30 November 2007: profit £2.9m).
dividend
On the basis of the results 
for the period, the directors are 
not proposing a final dividend.
StrateG y During the period the Group 
has continued to win contracts 
in existing markets with high profile 
customers such as Decathlon, 
TNT Fashion Group and h ugo boss, 
and it is our intention to continue 
to focus on our core market of 
non-food retail, whilst being able 
to explore new product categories 
where our products and solutions 
are applicable.
our maintenance support, which 
currently equates to approximately 
15% of our business, is another 
key potential growth area providing 
us with an additional, consistent 
and predictable long term 
revenue stream.
people
Dominick Donald De Sanctis 
retired as a Non-executive Director 
on 11 November 2008 due to 
personal reasons and, as a result 
of the sale of the uS businesses, 
Mary adams resigned from the 
Board on 28 November 2008. 
The Board is grateful to both 
Don and Mary for their contribution 
to the Group and wishes them 
both well for the future.
Gary pyle who has been Group 
chief Financial officer since the 
initial listing has decided to leave the 
Group to explore new opportunities. 
Without his efforts the listing may 
never have happened and his 
contribution to the Board and 
organisation will be missed. 
We wish him every success in his 
new ventures. We announced on 
11 May 2009 that Gary’s replacement 
will be Steve butler who will join 
as Group chief Financial officer 
on 1 august 2009. Most recently, 
Steve held the position of VP 
Finance and commercial with 
DhL Exel Supply chain and prior 
to this was a management 
consultant with Willis, ibM 
business consulting and 
pricewaterhousecoopers. 
Steve qualified as a chartered 
Management accountant with 
pricewaterhousecoopers in 2001.
i would like to take this opportunity, 
on behalf of the board, to thank 
all the employees of the Group, 
across the seven countries 
in which we now operate, for 
their dedication and continuing 
contribution to the success of the 
Group, despite the challenging 
environment during the period. 
We are confident that we can 
build on past successes and 
that we now have in place the 
right structure, people and strategy 
to continue to develop the business 
and achieve its full potential.
current tradinG 
and outlooK
The Group is far better positioned 
to compete in its current European 
markets and develop opportunities 
in new territories than a year ago as 
a result of the changes over the last 
16 months. The Group currently has 
an encouraging order book and 
sales pipeline for the year ending 
31 March 2010 which continues 
to demonstrate the quality of its 
offering. T oday, SDi is recognised 
as a leading international specialist 
in the design, build and support 
of bespoke integrated materials 
handling solutions for international 
retail, fulfilment and e-commerce 
distribution and this continues to 
create opportunities for us even 
in the current difficult retail trading 
environment and we believe we 
can continue our drive to grow 
market share in our markets. 
i am pleased with the Group’s 
progress during the past 16 months 
and your board looks forward to the 
forthcoming year with confidence.

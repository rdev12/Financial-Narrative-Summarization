Chairman’s 
Statement
Overview
The year started well with a continuation of 
the strong growth momentum of recent years 
but performance was impacted by the 
economic downturn as the year progressed. 
Total revenues increased by 2% for the year 
with growth of 7% at the half year and a 
decline of 3% in the second half. In 
challenging market conditions our 
performance was supported by successful 
design innovation and our strong portfolio of 
brands including Sanderson and Harlequin 
positioned at the mid market and Morris & Co 
and Zoffany at the upper end of the interior 
furnishings market. Revenues from these 
brands have grown year on year by 5%.
Collection - Tamika  
Design - Miya
Approximately half our manufacturing output 
was to third parties and this business 
declined by 9% in contrast to production for 
our own brands which increased by 4%.
We have strengthened our balance sheet 
during the year reducing net debt at the year 
end to £6,218,000 from £7,289,000 in 2008.
The current economic environment is clearly 
unfavourable. However many global 
opportunities are available to us in the 
medium term and a clear strategy to develop 
the Group for a strong future and to manage 
the downturn is set out in the Chief 
Executive’s Review. Walker Greenbank PLC

Overview
Financials
Revenue increased 2% to £63,698,000, from 
£62,448,000 over the same period last year. 
The operating profit for the year decreased 
10% to £3,561,000 (2008: £3,961,000). The 
profit before tax decreased 10% to 
£2,787,000 (2008: £3,099,000). The profit 
after tax declined to £1,622,000 (2008: 
£8,171,000), due almost entirely to non-cash 
deferred tax movements as a consequence of 
the recognition for the first time last year of a 
deferred tax asset. This related predominantly 
to historical corporation tax losses.
The earnings per share were 2.96p (2008: 
14.49p). An adjusted earnings per share that 
excludes the deferred tax movements and 
reflects the cash tax of the Group is 4.97p 
(2008: 5.44p).
Interest cover increased to 5.1 times, 
compared with 4.0 times last year.
The Group’s net indebtedness at the year end 
reduced to £6,218,000 (2008: £7,289,000). 
This represents a reduction in gearing to 31% 
(2008: 35%). The cash inflow from operating 
activities was £2,830,000 (2008: £3,542,000), 
reflecting higher stock levels as a result of 
extensive brand product launches during the 
year. At the year end, the Group had available 
banking facilities of £12,773,000 (2008: 
£14,183,000) representing headroom of 
£6,555,000 (2008: £6,894,000).
Dividend
The Directors do not recommend the 
payment of a dividend at this point in time. In 
this current economic environment we remain 
focused on continued cash generation and 
reduction in net debt.
People
On 31 January 2009, Ian Kirkham retired from 
the Board. He has served as Non-executive 
Chairman for a period of five years and during 
that time has overseen the transformation of 
the Group’s fortunes. I would like to offer our 
grateful thanks to Ian on behalf of the Board.
Following Ian’s retirement, I am delighted to 
have become Chairman at the start of the 
2009/10 financial year.
On 17 December 2008, Fiona Goldsmith 
joined the Board as a Non-executive Director. 
Her extensive financial background across a 
variety of business sectors will be of great 
value to the Group in future years.
 
Finally I would like to offer sincere thanks to all 
of our management and employees for their 
loyalty and commitment during the year. 
Outlook
Over the past five years the Group has 
established itself as a leader in its field 
increasing revenue and profits significantly,

generating cash and building a strong balance 
sheet. In the current uncertain global 
environment in which we operate we have 
focused on reducing our cost base, improving 
manufacturing efficiency and reducing net 
debt. In addition we continue to invest in the 
strength of our exceptional brand portfolio. 
Revenues in the first half will be significantly 
down on a buoyant period last year, though 
the impact of this reduction will to some 
extent be mitigated by our focus on costs and 
efficiency. With a clear strategy and a robust 
balance sheet we believe that the Group is 
well positioned to take advantage of an upturn 
in its markets.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Progress
I am pleased to report that your Company increased total 
Annualised Recurring Revenue by 1% to £28.7 million at 
constant currency (2014: £28.3 million) including a 46% 
increased contribution from StatPro Revolution of £7.8 million 
(2014: £5.4 million). Owing to reduced professional services 
income and currency effects, total revenue decreased 6%  
to £30.2 million (2014: £32.0 million). Adjusted EBITDA 
increased by 1% at constant currency to £4.0 million (2014: 
£4.0 million). StatPro Revolution related recurring revenue 
now amounts to £14.1 million (2014: £11.7 million), representing 
56% of total software recurring revenue (2014: 46%).
Acquisitions
On 21 January 2016, StatPro Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary 
of the Company) acquired the entire share capital of Investor 
Analytics LLC, the US-headquartered, cloud-based risk 
analytics company to hedge funds and asset managers. This 
acquisition brings a complementary cloud-based risk service, 
a highly professional team, new clients and greater market 
penetration into the important US and hedge fund market. 
With effect from 1 March 2016, StatPro South Africa (Pty) 
Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) acquired  
a 51% shareholding in InfoVest Consulting (Pty) Ltd, a South 
African headquartered software provider, specialising in  
data warehouse, ETL and reporting software for the asset 
management industry.
By taking a majority stake in InfoVest, your Company will 
participate in the benefits of the expanding compliance 
management market as well as improving the product and 
services we offer to clients. In addition, InfoVest’s data 
warehouse software is a cost-effective solution for asset 
managers and service providers to manage their internal 
data effectively in order to provide input data to StatPro 
Revolution and other systems. 
Financing
The Group signed a new financing facility with Wells Fargo in 
July 2015 available for acquisitions, share buy-backs and 
general corporate purposes. As part of the acquisition of 
Investor Analytics in January 2016, the financing facilities 
were increased and the key features of the facilities now are:
Carl Bacon
Chairman
• Five year commitment period to July 2020
• £10 million committed revolving credit facility
• US$7 million committed term loan
• US$3 million committed deferred drawdown loan
• £7.5 million uncommitted additional facility 
Dividend
Your Board is proposing a final dividend of 2.05p per share 
for 2016 payable on 25 May 2016 to all shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 29 April 2016 taking the 
total dividend to 2.9p per share (2014: 2.9p per share). 
Products
In 2015, total research and development expenditure was 
maintained at the high level of £4.9 million (2014: £5.0 million) 
representing 16% of Group revenue. The total cash expenditure 
in 2015 on StatPro Revolution, including marketing and other 
costs, amounted to £5.4 million (2014: £5.5 million).
It has been a long journey but at last your Company is 
positioned in 2016 to deliver the first cloud-based, integrated 
platform for performance, risk and compliance analytics in 
the asset management industry.
People
I would like to take this opportunity once again to 
congratulate our employees for the achievement of 
delivering such a fantastic suite of products and I look 
forward to their continued success selling and implementing 
these products throughout 2016.
Prospects
Asset managers still continue to grapple with increased 
regulation, more complex investment strategies, cost 
reduction and demands for better communication. Front 
office and middle office technology will continue to converge. 
The asset management industry is one year closer to your 
Company’s vision of integrated performance, risk and 
compliance delivered in the cloud.

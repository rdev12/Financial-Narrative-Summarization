operating activities Dividend Progress  I am pleased to report that your Company 
has again made substantial progress in 2010, increasing 
revenue by 5% to £33.1 million (2009: £31.6 million) 
and increasing total annualised recurring revenue by 
4% to £29.4 million (2009: £28.1 million at constant 
currency and excluding disposal). Adjusted profit 
before tax fell by 3% to £6.7 million (2009: £6.9 million).
Dividend  Your Board is proposing a final dividend of 
1.7p per share for 2010 payable on 25 May 2011 to all 
shareholders on the register at the close of business 
on 26 April 2011 taking the total dividend to 2.4p per 
share (2009: 2.1p per share) an increase of 14%. We 
intend to maintain a progressive dividend policy.
Products  In 2010 we increased our investment in 
research and development from £3.8 million to £5.4 
million, mostly related to StatPro Revolution and 
cloud technology and we will continue to invest in 
2011. Our Software as a Service (“SaaS”) strategy made 
further progress with the addition of 44 new clients 
for StatPro Seven, 30% (2009: 20%) by revenue of our 
software clients are now on SaaS. 
People  Our employees have, once again, done 
a great job and I take this opportunity to thank 
them for their contribution to meeting both the 
Company’s objectives and the objectives of our 
clients. I am confident that their hard work and 
enthusiasm will continue in what should prove to be 
an extremely exciting year for the Company.
Prospects  We start 2011 in confident mood 
looking forward to the full launch of StatPro 
Revolution during the year, a product with the 
potential to transform your Company.

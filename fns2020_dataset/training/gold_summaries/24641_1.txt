Highlights
Growth in capacity 
through acquisitions
The strategy of building a portfolio of 
underwriting capacity at Lloyd’ s has continued 
through the purchase of further corporate 
members. There remains a steady flow 
of vehicles for sale as existing owners wish 
to cease underwriting due to a change 
of circumstances. Since 1 January 2016 
£7.9m of capacity has been acquired. 
We remain selective on the purchases and 
have encountered reticence from potential 
vendors as the prices offered do not match 
their expectations. Premiums over the 
Humphrey’ s value are no longer paid and as the 
soft market conditions are reflected in the profits 
generated and auction values, we would expect 
discounts on the Humphrey’ s value to increase.
Following the close of 2014 year of account, 
another very profitable year, further vehicles 
are expected to be marketed as the impact 
of the soft insurance market affects the future 
returns to be generated by LLVs. We continue 
to expect resistance from vendors regarding 
our value expectations. There remains a risk 
to the implementation of our strategy if suitable 
vehicles are not available at attractive prices.

Quality of portfolio
We continue to focus ruthlessly on the quality 
syndicates. So, participations on weaker 
syndicates in acquired portfolios are sold to 
maintain the overall quality. The six largest 
participations with the leading managing 
agents at Lloyd’s account for 77% of the 
portfolio. These participations in syndicates 
managed by these managing agents 
represent shares in the better managed 
businesses at Lloyd’s. 
The underwriting results of the Helios portfolio 
have consistently outperformed the Lloyd’s 
market average. Helios’ average return on 
capacity over the last three closed years 
is 14.3% and is on average 3.69% higher 
than the average of the Lloyd’s market. 
The combined ratio of the portfolio (before 
Helios corporate costs) has been 5.79% lower 
on average over the last three calendar years. 
These incremental returns demonstrate the 
diversity and the breadth of underwriting 
expertise within the businesses comprising 
the portfolio of syndicate capacity.
• 77% of the portfolio managed by 
leading managing agents at Lloyd’s 
• Helios portfolio underwriting 
results for 2014 underwriting 
year outperform Lloyd’s average 
return on capacity by 4.7% 
• Helios cedes 70% of portfolio at 
the start of the underwriting year
• Helios expects to retain over 50% 
of overall underwriting result by 
the close of the underwriting year
Maintaining the quality of the portfolio.
Helios return on 
capacity is on average 
3.6% higher than the 
Lloyd’s market over the 
last three closed years.

Reinsurance quota share
The use of quota share reinsurance to 
provide access to the Lloyd’s underwriting 
exposures for reinsurers and private capital 
has been expanded. The core of the panel 
of reinsurers remains XL Group plc and 
Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited.
This reinsurance reduces the exposure 
of the portfolio and assists in the financing 
of the underwriting capital. Helios will seek 
to reinsure a significant proportion of the 
capacity at the start of the underwriting 
year to mitigate the open-year underwriting 
exposures. For corporate members acquired 
during the year, a proportion of the “on-risk” 
capacity will be ceded to reinsurers whilst 
the capacity on older years will be retained 
100% by Helios. Therefore, the proportion 
of the overall capacity that Helios retains 
is expected to rise as further corporate 
members are acquired in the future. The 
profits earned after the company has been 
acquired will be recognised by Helios.
The table shows that the Helios retained 
capacity increases significantly in years 
2 and 3 as further corporate members 
are acquired and the older years are 
not reinsured. Capacity on underwriting 
years after 18 months of development 
is substantially “off risk” as the underlying 
insurance contracts have mostly expired. 
Therefore, the profits from the capacity 
on the older years are retained 100% by 
Helios. The proportion of overall capacity 
retained by Helios for the 2015 and 2016 
underwriting years is expected to increase 
to approximately 50% as further corporate 
members are acquired.

Strategic report
Annual report and financial statements 2016 — Helios Underwriting plc 7 Development of profit estimates
As Helios has no active involvement in the 
underwriting or management of the syndicates 
on which it participates, it relies on information 
on forecast profitability of the portfolio that is 
released on a quarterly basis by the managing 
agents of the syndicates. The managing 
agents have traditionally been conservative 
in the estimation of the profitability of a year 
of account, waiting until the development of 
the underlying reserves for the claims can 
be assessed with greater certainty. 
The capacity acquired on the “off-risk” years 
that is retained 100% by Helios contributes 
a significant part of the profits of the Group. 
The chart below indicates that a significant 
proportion of the improvement in the estimates 
of profitability of syndicates are declared by 
the managing agents in the last 12 months 
to the close of an underwriting year. Helios 
benefits from the conservative nature of the 
managing agents.
Risk management
Helios continues to ensure that the portfolio 
is well diversified across classes of businesses 
and managing agents at Lloyd’s. 
The purchase of quota share reinsurance cedes 
70% of the risk on the younger or “on-risk” 
years, which has remained consistent for 
the last three years. The market conditions 
continue to soften even as the incidence 
of insured natural disasters and large loss 
events have been above normal expectations 
in 2016. This has allowed the insurance 
industry to generate adequate returns 
on capital and thereby attract new capital 
to the industry. 
There is today a strong consensus in the 
insurance industry that the continued 
pressure on rates will have to slow shortly. 
It might take a catastrophe, or series of 
catastrophes, on a very large scale to 
materially turn the market for short-tail lines 
of business. The high aggregation of coastal 
exposures in the US and other developed 
markets is one reason why such massive 
dislocations cannot be ruled out. 
The biggest single risk faced by insurers 
arises from the possibility of mispricing 
insurance on a large scale. This is mitigated 
by the diversification of the syndicate 
portfolio and by the depth of management 
experience within the syndicates that Helios 
supports. These management teams have 
weathered multiple market cycles and the 
risk management skills employed should 
reduce the possibility of substantial 
under-reserving of previous-year underwriting.
We assess the downside risk in the event 
of a major loss through the monitoring of the 
aggregate net losses estimated by managing 
agents to the catastrophe risk scenarios 
(“CRS”) prescribed by Lloyd’s. 
The individual syndicate net exposures will 
depend on the business underwritten during 
the year and the reinsurance protections 
purchased at syndicate level.
The aggregate exceedance probability 
(“AEPs”) assess the potential impact across 
the portfolio from either single or multiple 
large losses with a probability of occurring 
greater than once in a 30-year period.
In addition, Helios buys stop loss reinsurance 
that will mitigate the impact of a significant 
loss to the portfolio.
For 2017, the scope of the stop loss cover has 
been rationalised and terms have been included 
which will assist in funding a large loss.

Helios Underwriting plc — Annual report and financial statements 2016 8 Capacity value
The value of the portfolio of the syndicate 
capacity remains the major asset of the 
Group and an important factor in delivering 
overall returns to shareholders. The adjusted 
net asset value (“ANAV”), being the value of 
the net tangible assets of the Group, 
together with the current value of the 
portfolio capacity, is a key management 
metric in determining growth in value 
to shareholders. 
The Board recognises that the average prices 
derived from the annual capacity auctions 
managed by the Corporation at Lloyd’s could 
be subject to material change if the level of 
demand for syndicate capacity reduces. 
Notwithstanding the average prices derived 
from the auction process, each of the syndicates 
will have a track record of trading profitability 
and generating cash.
The 2016 auctions valued the Helios portfolio 
at 31 December 2016 at £14.9m. Applying 
the 2015 auction average prices to the same 
portfolio, the overall value was very similar at 
£14.9m. There were variations in the prices 
achieved by individual syndicates between 
the years. 
The accounting policy requires an assessment 
of the carrying value of each syndicate 
participation against the latest average 
auction prices. The impairment charge 
for this year of £555,000 (2015: £63,000) 
results in a reduction in the fair value of the 
syndicate capacity held on the balance sheet. 
The two syndicates that mainly contributed 
to this impairment charge were Syndicate 
2010 (Cathedral) and Syndicate 386 (QBE 
Liability). The excess supply of capacity over 
demand for these participations at the last 
auction, the Board believes, was due to 
circumstances peculiar to each syndicate. 
Should the average auction prices for these 
two syndicates exceed the current carrying 
value in the future; the impairment charge 
could be reversed.
These movements in the carrying value of 
capacity have no impact on cash flow.
For calculation of the ANAV, the carrying 
value of the capacity in the balance sheet 
is replaced by the total current portfolio 
value. Therefore, this impairment charge 
does not impact the ANAV of the Group.

Helios has generated free cash of £3m in 
2016 (2015: £1.8m) from the distribution of 
its share of the final underwriting profits of the 
2014 underwriting year. These profits have 
assisted in funding the recent acquisitions 
and will provide working capital for the next 
12 months. 
Corporate, social and 
environmental responsibility
Helios aims to meet its expectations of 
its shareholders and other stakeholders 
in recognising, measuring and managing 
the impacts of its business activities. 
As Helios manages a portfolio of Lloyd’s 
syndicate capacity, it has no direct responsibility 
for the management of those businesses. 
Each managing agent has responsibility 
for the management of those businesses, 
their staff and employment policies and 
the environmental impact. 
Therefore, the Board does not consider 
it appropriate to monitor or report any 
performance indicators in relation to 
corporate, social or environmental matters.
Sir Michael Oliver has been our Chairman 
since the Company was created in 2007. 
Sadly he has decided that it is time to 
stand down at this year’s AGM in June. 
His experience and wise counsel was 
invaluable when the Company was launched 
as a new spread underwriting vehicle and 
has continued to be through all stages of 
its development. I would like to take this 
opportunity to extend our heartfelt gratitude 
to him and wish him well for the future.

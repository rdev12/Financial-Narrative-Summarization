Annual Report 2007
2007 was another year of excellent progress for The Restaurant Group, with substantial
increases in both revenue and profits. Againstamoredifficultbackground for consumer-
facing businesses the Group grew like-for-likesales by 5.5% following on from growth
of 5% for the previous year.Our strong and resilient market positioning combined with
affordable offerings enabled the Group to producearecordset of results, with adjusted
earnings per sharegrowth of 27%. We sold morethan 30 million meals (including around
four andahalf million children’smeals) during 2007, an increase of three million total meals
on the previous year and also created approximately 1,000 full and part time new jobs.
2007 was the second full year of trading in the Group’srefocused form. Youwill recall that
we took the decision to direct our focus away from the increasingly crowded high street
marketplace and positioned TRG’sbusiness firmly in the out of town segments of the
eating out market. This strategy has served us well as it affords us some protection in
amorechallenging economicenvironment.
Buildingonastrong performance for the first half of the year the Group made further
progress during the second half to produce an excellent set of full year results. Revenue
increased by 17% to £367m, adjusted profit beforetax increased by 24% to £43.5m
(2006: £35.0m) and adjusted earnings per shareincreased by 27% to 14.64p (2006:

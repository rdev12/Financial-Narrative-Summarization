exclude businesses which were sold (‘discontinued’) in 2006/07. ’Restructuring items’ which relate to significant restructuring events and the impact of the Fletchers fire in the 52 weeks ended

losses on the disposal of businesses and assets and financial instrument gains and impairments arising from the group’s restructuring activities.

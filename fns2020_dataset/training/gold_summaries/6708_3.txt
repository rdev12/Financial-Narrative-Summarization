Current Trading and Outlook
T r ading	activities	impr o v ed	in	the	second	quarter	of	2009,	f ol lowing	the	late	2008	financial	crisis,	and	ha v e	appear ed	
to	stabi liz e	thr ough	the	r emainder	of	2009	and	into	2010.	T r ading	in	the	first	quarter	of	2010	has	been	in	l ine	wi th	our	
expectations. 
Business volumes were relatively steady throughout 2009, and we are seeing an uptick in activity in 2010, from several 
large corporate clients. Our core strategic focus is on increasing the depth of our relationships and the volume of 
business we undertake with major global manufacturing companies, many of which are seeking to improve their control 
over capital costs and to better utilise their existing asset base. Using our proprietary software, particularly AssetZone 
that is integrated with our online auction engine, these clients are better able to buy, sell, redeploy and value their 
assets. These systems have been at the heart of the group’s capital expenditure programme, and we continue to invest 
in them. We will also continue to serve our other clients, including corporations, insolvency practitioners, asset based 
lenders and dealers.

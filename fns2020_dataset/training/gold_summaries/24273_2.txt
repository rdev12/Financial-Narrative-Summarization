GBG has had another strong year achieving record revenues and 
delivering profitability ahead of market expectations. This is testament  
to the hard work, dedication and talent of our excellent team.
This was achieved whilst simultaneously increasing our operating expenditure on the development  
of new products, expanding our international operations and strengthening our management team. 
As a result we have entered the new financial year with strong momentum and excellent prospects.

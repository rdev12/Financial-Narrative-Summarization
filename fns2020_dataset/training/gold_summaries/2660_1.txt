 6 PartyGaming Plc 
Annual report 2005
Chief Executive’s review
Richard Segal
Chief Executive Officer
Introduction
I am delighted to welcome you to the Group’s first annual report
since becoming a listed company in June 2005. In the following
pages we have given you an overview of our business and the
markets in which we operate, the key challenges we face and
the resources and strategies that we have in place to not only
meet those challenges, but to overcome them and deliver
attractive financial returns for our shareholders.
PartyGaming is a dynamic, vibrant and exciting business, one
which is probably unique in its scope, breadth and financial
performance. We hope this annual report brings home to you
the scale of our achievements to date, with a focus on the
events of 2005. But this is just the beginning of our journey.
Yes, we are a gaming company but more than that we are 
a highly professional and commercially driven enterprise. 
Business is our lifeblood, it is what drives every single one of our
employees, all of whom have a stake in the Group’s future
performance. We have the skills, we have the resources and
most importantly we have the capability to fulfil our objective of
becoming the world’s number one gaming company.
My decision to leave PartyGaming has been a difficult one 
given the success already achieved and the exciting prospects
ahead. My gratitude and best wishes go to the first class team at
PartyGaming for the successes and achievements to date, as
well as for their preparations for the even greater things to come. 7 PartyGaming Plc 
Annual report 2005
Our players enjoy a flutter.
Some trust to luck, others employ 
their well-honed skills. Either way,
they play for entertainment.
Over the next few pages we have
sought to communicate the sheer
scale of our business, but at the same
time have some fun. We hope you
enjoy it.
Game on!

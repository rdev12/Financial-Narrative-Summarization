 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Financial Highlights
For the year ended 30 June 2008,  
adjusted profit before tax
1
 increased by 
33% to £14.1m (2007 - £10.6m). Adjusted 
basic earnings per share
2
 grew by 21% 
to 36.22p (2007 - 29.91p). As anticipated, 
volumes increased by 33% to £1,110m 
(2007 - £833m), with fee income in the 
year increasing by 43% to £150.3m (2007 - 
£104.8m).
The strong improvement in performance,  
with adjusted group operating profit
1
 
increasing by 56% to £15.1m (2007 - £9.7m), 
has been driven by a combination of organic 
and acquisition growth. Our overseas 
businesses generated operating profits of 
£4.9m (2007 - £1.5m) and now represent 
26% of group trading operating profit, with  
a full year contribution from ISG Asia of £1.8m 
(2007 - £0.8m) and a nine month contribution 
from IASA from its activities in Europe of 
£3.0m (2007 - £0.7m). Our National Retail 
and Leisure businesses generated operating 
profits of £3.9m (2007 - £2.0m) which now 
represents 21% of group trading operating 
profit. Included in this result was a full year 
contribution from ISG Cathedral and a  
seven and a half month contribution from 
Pearce Retail.
Our London operations increased operating 
profit by 22% to £7.9m (2007 - £6.5m), 
representing 43% of group trading operating 
profit. The operating profit of our Regional 
Construction businesses increased to £1.8m 
(2007 - £1.5m) and included a seven and a 
half month contribution from Pearce  
Regional Construction.  
Throughout the year operating cash flow has 
remained strong with net cash inflow from 
operating activities increasing in the year 
to £20.4m (2007 - £11.5m). Along with the 
increase in bank borrowings during the year 
to fund one of our recent acquisitions, this 
resulted in net cash as at 30 June 2008 of 
£35.3m (2007 - £22.3m).
Dividend
An interim dividend of 4.00p was paid in April 
2008. A final dividend of 9.20p is proposed 
bringing the total to 13.20p (2007 - 11.50p), 
an increase of 15%. Subject to its approval 
at the AGM on 8 December 2008, the final 
dividend will be payable on 10 December 
2008 to shareholders on the register on 14 
November 2008. The ex-dividend date will 
be 12 November 2008. The closing date for 
elections for the Dividend Re-Investment  
Plan is 14 November 2008.

27228_Text.indd   11 30/10/08   14:56:34 Strategic Developments
Over the past three years the group’s key 
strategic priority has been to reduce its 
dependency on the London office sector 
via organic and acquisitive growth outside 
London, whilst retaining our leading market 
position in the sector. The result of our efforts 
over this period has been to increase the 
group trading operating profit outside London 
from 11% to 57% of the group, and we are 
targeting this to increase further in the  
current year.  
Growth in our overseas operations
During the last twelve months we have 
extended our geographic capabilities for our 
clients by fully integrating into the group 
our existing European associate and, more 
recently, agreeing terms to create a joint 
venture in the Middle East.
We completed in September 2007 
the acquisition of the remaining 80% 
shareholding in IASA. The business offers 
office, hotel, leisure and retail fit out services 
across mainland Europe, from offices in Paris, 
Milan and Frankfurt. During the nine months 
of trading since acquisition, the company has 
generated an operating profit of £3.0m on 
£30.1m of work delivered. 
The European market place provides 
considerable opportunity and we will seek 
to continue to build our presence and brand 
across the region. We anticipate opening  
an office in Switzerland in the current year 
and we have just won our first contract 
in Poland. We are seeking joint venture 
opportunities in both Eastern and Western 
European countries.
In Asia, we have continued to expand 
organically our activities in China and  
Hong Kong.
 
Whilst we have a growing project 
management presence in North Asia,  
we presently have limited exposure in South 
East Asia where we are now pursuing 
acquisition opportunities to build a wider  
regional presence.  
In April, we announced entering into Heads 
of Terms with the Al Habtoor Leighton Group, 
one of the largest construction services 
groups across the Middle East region, to 
establish a 50:50 joint venture based in Dubai, 
to provide fit out services across the Middle 
East region. We are targeting completion by 
the end of October 2008 once the relevant 
government approvals are in place.
We have supported these expansion plans 
from London by strengthening both our 
acquisition capability and our group resources 
for servicing our international clients.
Growth in our National Retail and 
Leisure operations
 
The acquisition of Pearce Retail as part of 
the Pearce Group in November 2007 has 
strengthened substantially our retail offering 
with the addition of a leading national retail fit 
out business that works on a framework basis 
with major food and clothing retailers such 
as Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Morrisons and 
Marks & Spencer. For the seven and a half 
months of activity the business generated an 
operating profit of £1.3m on revenue  
of £49.2m.
From 1 July 2008, the businesses of ISG 
Dean and Bowes and ISG Cathedral have 
been combined and re-branded as ISG Retail 
and Leisure, operating from three locations 
in Whitstable, Huntingdon and Chorley.  
The integration of the two businesses will 
provide an enhanced level of service to our 
key national banking and high street retail 
customers. Recently we have secured 
a five year retail roll out programme for 
Lloyds TSB extending our decade long 
relationship, together with a five year 
framework appointment with RBS, an annual 
extension to the HSBC framework and a new 
appointment to a framework with the HBOS 
group. In addition, we have commenced 
working with Barclays and have now 
completed several projects. In the financial 
year ended 30 June 2008, the business 
delivered projects with revenue totalling 
£28m under these appointments and we are 
targeting a 50% increase in the current year. CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT [continued]
Increasing our UK Regional 
Construction activities
The acquisition of Pearce Construction as 
part of the Pearce Group in November 2007 
has expanded our coverage into the South 
West of England and South Wales, delivering 
build solutions for both public and private 
sector clients. The business has over four 
social housing frameworks and a number of 
other public sector frameworks. In line with 
our expectations, the business generated 
an operating profit for the seven and a half 
month period of £0.2m on revenue  
of £50.4m.
Our regional construction businesses have 
been targeting the education sector where 
the government is currently spending around 
£7 billion per year. We were pleased to 
announce recently our appointment as the 
preferred contractor on a £50m education 
project for Suffolk County Council to build the 
South West Ipswich and South Suffolk Sixth 
Form Centre, currently subject to planning 
permission. Our appointment came on the 
back of four significant UK education projects 
that have been secured by our regional 
construction businesses in the last six months 
with a combined contract value of almost 
£80m; Gateway College in Leicestershire 
(£20m), St John’s School in Marlborough 
(£18m), St Brendan’s College in Bristol  
(£13m) and Sir John Deane’s College in 
Cheshire (£26m).
Rebalancing of our London activities
Over the last two years we have been 
reducing the London business exposure to 
the office market by targeting opportunities 
in the Olympics, student accommodation, 
data centres, transport, government and local 
authority sectors.
 
Current major projects outside the office 
market include the St Pancras Eurostar 
terminal, the Velodrome for the 2012 
Olympics and Nido Spitalfields student 
accommodation.

 Project of the Year
1 Trading
The following is a summary of the fee income and gross value of work 
performed (“volumes”) and a summary of the forward order book.
The strong improvement in trading has continued throughout the year.  
Fee income, volumes and forward order book increased year on year  
by 43%, 33% and 25% respectively. Adjusted group operating margin
1
 
on fee income increased to 10.0% (2007 - 9.3%). 
In respect of the order book of £1,051m at the end of June 2008, only 
33% of the activity relates to the UK corporate office sector (2007 
- 60%), with 35% relating to the education, affordable housing and 
government sectors (2007 - 15%) and 25% to the retail and leisure 
sector (2007 - 18%).
The group continues to focus on being a leader in health and safety 
excellence having won 15 Gold Awards and one Gold Medal in May 
2008 from The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. The 
group’s Accident Incident Rate during the year was a ratio of 5.38, 
compared to the industry average of 8.65. We are currently reviewing 
our practices to continue to improve performance in this key area.

London Fit out
London Fit out maintained a strong 
performance. Volumes remained constant 
at £309m (2007 - £310m), with fee income 
rising 7% to £36.4m (2007 - £34.0m). Notable 
project delivery successes were the fit out 
of the common areas of the new St Pancras 
Eurostar Terminal, the new London offices 
for the Financial Services Authority and for 
Eversheds, the second phase of the refit of 
Shell House on the South Bank, three projects 
for RBS in the City and the new London head 
office for Standard Chartered Bank.
In line with the previously reported reduction 
in opportunities for major projects (>£25m) 
resulting from the current lack of large scale 
new office space in the City, the June 2008 
forward order book has declined to £174m 
(2007 - £208m), with the June 2008 in 
year order book declining to £103m (2007 - 
£190m) including the completion of current 
projects for Transport for London, Mayer 
Brown International and Unilever. However 
since the year end, five contracts have been 
won with an aggregate contract value of 
£107m (of which £80m is to be delivered by 
June 2009), including a £75m data centre fit 
out construction management contract in the 
North East of England and a £15m office fit 
out for the legal firm Reed Smith. With the 
planned start on site of the circa £50m fit out 
of KPMG’s new UK headquarters building in 
Canary Wharf in May 2009 and a number of 
large potential projects in the pipeline, we 
remain confident of being able to maintain 
the current activity levels for 2009/10 with an 
existing order book of circa £100m.
London Build
London Build division’s volume increased 
by 38% to £279m (2007 - £202m) and 
fee income increased by 27% to £28.2m 
(2007 - £22.2m). The increased volume has 
been driven by our success working for 
repeat relationships, where in the year we 
worked on ten new build projects and 15 
refurbishment projects. Operationally, notable 
successes in the period were the delivery of 
the Aviatior Hotel in Farnborough, the base 
build for the Audi show rooms in Brentford, 
Horseferry House for Derwent London, 
Howick Place for Fabbriche Ceramiche 
Investments, One Finsbury Circus for Hermes 
and 14 Cornhill for IVG Asticus. In addition, 
we are making good progress on the Nido 
Spitalfields 32 storey student accommodation 
tower for Blackstone, the Stratton Street 
scheme for Grafton Advisors, the Savannah 
House scheme for Standard Life and 
Fleetway House for Tishman Speyer.
As at June 2008, London Build starts the 
current year with an increased forward order 
book of £357m (2007 - £318m), of which 
the June 2008 in year order book is £215m 
(2007 - £237m). Included in the order book is 
the Velodrome for the London 2012 Olympic 
Games but with a start on site envisaged in 
early 2009, there will only be modest activity 
in the financial year ended 30 June 2009. 
OUR LONDON OPERATIONS HAD ANOTHER STRONG YEAR. VOLUMES GREW BY 15% 
TO £588M (2007 - £512M) AND FEE INCOME GREW BY 15% TO £64.6M (2007 - £56.2M).  
OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED BY 21% TO £7.9M (2007 - £6.5M), RESULTING IN AN 
OPERATING MARGIN ON FEE INCOME OF 12.3% (2007 - 11.6%). WITH THE WELL 
PUBLICISED SLOW DOWN IN THE OFFICE MARKET, WE HAVE REDUCED THE VOLUME 
TARGET FOR LONDON IN THE CURRENT YEAR BY 23% TO £450M. AS AT JUNE 2008,  
THE BUSINESS HAS AN IN YEAR ORDER BOOK COVERAGE OF 70% (2007 - 73%). 1. Client: AXA Investment Managers

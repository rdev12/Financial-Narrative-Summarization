 4    FIBERWEB PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 
INDUSTRIAL 
OVERVIEW
 AMERICAS INDUSTRIAL 
2009 was a difficult year for 
volumes with the ongoing 
US recession. The business 
focused on efficiency 
improvement and innovation, 
with a significant reduction in 
working capital and exciting 
new products in graphic arts 
and roofing.
EUROPE INDUSTRIAL 
Following a weak 2008, 2009 
was a recovery year which 
saw operating margins almost 
double, despite extremely 
difficult markets, especially 
in house building and hence 
roofing. Cost reductions, new 
product launches and improved 
sales and marketing initiatives 
combined to deliver a strong 
result.
TERRAM Terram continued 
the recovery apparent since 
2007, with record output from 
its remaining production line 
in South Wales and progress in 
developing sales in the Middle 
East and Russia in particular . 
Late in H2, new needle-punch 
products were launched, 
extending the product range.

OUR OPERATIONS AT A GLANCE
Nonwovens markets tend to be regionally orientated because the bulk export of nonwoven materials over long 
distances is not generally logistically viable. Fiberweb has a presence in all major regions, concentrated primarily 
in North America and Europe.

HYGIENE OVERVIEW
 CONSUMER FABRICS An 
eventful year, with high 
utilisation in the US offset by 
over-capacity in Europe and 
weak volumes in the first half. 
Second half improvement seen 
through recovering markets, 
the successful commissioning 
of the new Italian spunbond 
line, weakness at some 
competitors and initial benefits 
of the European restructuring 
programme. 
FITESAFIBERWEB JV The 
creation of this joint venture 
in July 2009 brings together 
two of Fiberweb’s facilities – in 
Washougal, US and Queretaro, 
Mexico – with Fitesa’s modern 
and well-invested facility at 
Gravatai in Southern Brazil 
to form a $200 million sales 
operation which gives Fiberweb 
excellent access to the fast-
growing and attractive South 
American market. 
AIRLAID For Fiberweb’s airlaid 
business in China 2009 was a 
disappointing year, with volume 
weakness. Success in bringing 
new products on-stream on line 
1 will underpin progress in 2010.       FIBERWEB PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009    5

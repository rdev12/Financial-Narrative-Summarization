Chairman’s Statement
In the midst of a perfect storm of increased regulation, 
higher costs, making market outperformance ('alpha') 
more challenging... StatPro Revolution is ideally placed  
to help. 
Progress
I am pleased to report that your Company 
increased total annualised recurring 
revenue by 4% to £29.5 million (2011: 
£28.5 million at constant currency) 
including a greatly increased contribution 
from StatPro Revolution of £1.5 million 
(2011: £0.5 million). Total revenue 
increased by 1% to £32.0 million (2011: 
£31.7 million) and despite continued 
expenditure on StatPro Revolution, 
adjusted profit before tax increased by 
14% to £5.0 million (2011: £4.4 million).
Financing
Your Company raised £5.8 million (net 
of expenses) in a placing in November 
2012 and, combined with another year 
of strong operating cash flow, the Group 
had net cash of £3.7 million at year end 
(2011: net debt of £3.4 million). The 
purpose of raising further equity was 
to allow increased investment in cloud 
services. Your Board believes that StatPro 
Revolution has immense potential with 
‘first mover’ advantage and the plan 
is to capitalise on this opportunity. 
Dividend
Your Board is proposing a final dividend of 
1.9p per share for 2012 payable on 22 May 
2013 to all shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 26 April 2013 
taking the total dividend to 2.7p per share 
(2011: 2.6p) an increase of 4%. We intend 
to maintain a progressive dividend policy.
Products
In 2012, total research and development 
expenditure was £4.2 million (2011: 
£5.0 million) representing 13% of Group 
revenue. Although total research and 
development expenditure decreased by 
17%, following your Board’s decision to 
develop solely cloud-based solutions, 
research and development expenditure 
increased for StatPro Revolution and 
StatPro Revolution Plus (the cloud 
upgrade path for StatPro Seven). The 
total cash expenditure on StatPro 
Revolution including marketing and 
other costs incurred in 2012 amounted 
to £3.7 million (2011: £3.3 million).
Corporate governance
As previously announced, Charles 
Fairbairn resigned from the Board of 
Directors with effect from 31 December 
2012. Charles has been a Non-Executive 
Director of StatPro since April 2000 
and helped prepare the Company for 
its stock market flotation successfully 
achieved in May 2000. I would like to 
express my deep gratitude to Charles for 
his contribution, advice and invaluable 
support over these past 12 years and wish 
him well in his other business ventures. 
I was delighted to welcome Jane Tozer 
OBE MBE to the Board on 1 October 
2012. Jane brings with her a wealth 
of experience in both large and small 
companies, the asset management and 
software industries. Jane was appointed 
Chairman of the Audit Committee 
with effect from 1 January 2013. 
People
In what has been a transformational 
year for your Company, our employees 
have again done a fantastic job and 
I take this opportunity to thank 
them for their contribution to this 
transformation and for ensuring that 
the objectives of both the Company 
and of our clients are achieved. 
Prospects
The asset management industry in 
its broader sense, including asset 
owners, asset managers, advisors, 
administrators and custodians, is in the 
midst of a perfect storm of increased 
regulation, reducing fees, higher costs, 
greater demands for transparency, 
increased global competition, making 
market outperformance (‘alpha’) more 
challenging. Your Company, with its 
StatPro Revolution service, is ideally 
placed to provide solutions to the 
asset management industry to help 
cope with this storm. I look forward 
to capitalising on StatPro Revolution’s 
undoubted appeal in 2013.

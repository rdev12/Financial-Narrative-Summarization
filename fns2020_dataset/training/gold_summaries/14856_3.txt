     7 statpro momentum annual report & accounts 2006
Acquisitions
Your Company acquired three businesses in 
2006, the most signiﬁcant of which was FRI, 
a company based in Canada, the acquisition 
of which completed in October 2006.
FRI provides data for asset managers and 
custodians and portfolio management 
systems for asset managers. There are 
significant synergies bet ween the 
increasing data requirements of both 
our existing and prospective clients and 
the FRI data service. 
In May 2006 we acquired a business based 
in Cape Town called Kizen which develops 
compliance software, thus cementing our 
market leading position in South Africa 
and adding an additional product we can 
distribute to existing clients.
In April 2006 we acquired a business based 
in Sydney called Alphai that develops 
performance software, providing an entry 
into the Australian market and a further 
product that can be integrated into our 
Web Service platform. 
Financing
Your company successfully raised further 
equity during the year amounting to 
£14.9 million and bank debt amounting 
to £12 million (before expenses) to finance 
the acquisition of FRI.
Products
In my report for 2005, I commented on the 
launch of our Fixed Income Attribution 
product (SFI) in January 2006. This proved 
to be successful and together with our 
Risk product (SRM) produced a good sales 
performance. We are well placed to beneﬁt 
from the increasing demands generated by 
the growing market in complex assets.       
Board of Directors
As previously reported, Dominic Wheatley 
resigned from the Board of directors in 
January 2007. Dominic has been a non-
executive director of StatPro since 1999 and 
has helped guide your Company through 
its major transition from an unquoted loss-
making business to a successful proﬁtable 
dividend paying AIM listed Company. I 
would like to express my deep gratitude 
to Dominic for his contribution, advice 
and support and wish him well in his other 
business ventures.
People
It has been my good fortune to welcome 
many new employees to StatPro during 
2006; our achievements rely heavily on 
the enthusiasm and commitment of all 
our employees and my thanks go to 
all of them.
Dividend
Your Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend of 
0.7p per share for 2006 payable on 30 May 
2007 to those shareholders on the register 
on 27 April 2007 taking the total dividend 
to 1.0p per share (2005: 0.5p per share) 
an increase of 100% on the dividend for 
2005.  We intend to maintain a progressive 
dividend policy reflecting the balance 
between the investment needs of the 
business and growth in underlying cash 
and earnings per share.
Prospects
We enter 2007, as we did in 2006, with 
considerable conﬁdence. Again we have 
a large pipeline of prospects, a growing 
number of existing clients and a wider 
range of products and data that meet 
the complex requirements of increasingly 
demanding asset managers.     
Carl Bacon Chairman

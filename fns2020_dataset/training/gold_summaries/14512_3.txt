 South Staffordshire Group Plc Report & Accounts 2003
2 – Chairman’s Statement
Lindsay Bury – Chairman
The Group had a particularly successful year
achieving 26% organic growth in operating profits
†
from its Support Services businesses combined
with a contribution of £6.2m from the acquisitions
in the year. 
During the year we saw a substantial increase in the
liquidity of the Group’s shares following the
successful placing of 40% of our stock, owned for
many years by Vivendi and Axa, with a range of
institutional investors. 
Group Results
In the year ended 31 March 2003 the Group’s
turnover (including share of joint ventures) increased
by 50% to £265.8m (2002: £177.1m). Profit before
tax, goodwill and exceptional item* has increased
by 22% to £44.5m (2002: £36.4m). This comprises
a 54% increase in operating profit
†
from Support
Services and a 2% increase in Regulated Water
Supply profits. Earnings per share (excluding
goodwill and exceptional item)* for the year have
increased by 15.9% to 45.9p (2002: 39.6p). The
Board is proposing a final dividend per share of
12.4p making a total for the year of 18.0p (2002:
16.1p), an increase of 11.8%. Following the
acquisitions, which increased debt by £84m, the
balance sheet remains strong with net debt at 31
March 2003 of £103.1m (2002: £28.6m) and
interest cover* of 8.5 times.
HomeServe
The HomeServe businesses have more than
doubled turnover to £121m (2002: £60m), with
operating profits
†
increasing by 70% to £24.0m
(2002: £14.1m). This represents 37% organic profit
growth in the existing HomeServe businesses
together with a profit contribution of £4.7m from
Regency and Highway, which were acquired during
the year.
Home Service has increased the number of policies
in force by 30% to 2.4 million, which represents the
largest annual increase since the business started.
This reflects a combination of growth in the core
plumbing product, new products introduced during
the year, together with greater use of outbound
telesales for customer acquisition and renewal rates
being maintained at 86%.
Regency, which was acquired in May 2002 and
provides underwritten furniture warranties and
repairs to retailers and manufacturers, has achieved
strong sales growth in the year. It has significantly
expanded its employed repair network and
successfully implemented a new warranty
programme for Harveys, one of its major retail
customers.

Highway, which was acquired in July 2002 and
provides emergency repair services to insurers, has
achieved a reduced profit compared to last year.
Highway had increased its cost base and
operational capacity in anticipation of continuing to
win new customers. New customers have been
added but not as quickly as anticipated. This has
been combined with a reduction in average job
values. This has reduced profits in the short term
and has led to us putting measures in place to
create a more flexible cost base.
Commercial Outsourcing
The Commercial Outsourcing businesses have
grown turnover by 34% to £104m. Operating profit
†
has increased by 25% to £10.0m, which includes a
contribution of £1.5m from the acquisition of
Middleton Doorman.
OnSite has achieved significant growth in its long
term business with Thames Water and London
Underground. Additionally, Middleton Doorman has
performed well since acquisition and has broadened
the division’s customer base and service offering.
The Echo joint venture with South West Water is
now well established and our Rapid software has
been implemented. In addition, our mailing services
business has achieved improved margins during the
year.
Regulated Water Supply
Operating profits from Regulated Water Supply have
increased by 2% to £16.5m (2002: £16.2m) on
turnover of £59m. This compares to an RPI of
0.9%, which was used as the basis for increasing
charges for 2002/03. The business continues to
achieve efficiency gains and deliver the highest
levels of service. The business remains on course to
meet all of its regulatory targets, including
demanding efficiency savings, which apply until the
next price review in 2005. The Water Company
issued an unsecured 23 year index-linked bond of
£85m which increased debt to approximately 65%
of the Regulated Asset Value, thereby reducing its
cost of capital.
Prospects
The Group’s strategy for growth remains to develop
as a Support Services business through both its
HomeServe and Commercial Outsourcing activities.
It will continue to benefit from the increasing
demand for a broad range of assistance services
into the home and the trend to outsourcing in both
industry and the utilities market.
Significant opportunities for growth exist in all areas
of our Support Services businesses. Home Service
will continue to develop new products and improve
market penetration. Regency’s priorities will include
growing its repair business and developing new
retail warranty products. Within Highway our focus
will be on improving operational efficiency and
developing a plumbing service for its insurance
customer base. Commercial Outsourcing is well
positioned to build on its established long term
customer relationships. The Regulated Water
Supply business will continue to provide high levels
of service at low charges. 
Overall the Group should benefit from continued
strong demand for its Support Services activities,
together with stable returns from Regulated Water
Supply.

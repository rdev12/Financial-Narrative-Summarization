 BrainJuicer Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to report that BrainJuicer has had an excellent year. An encouraging first half was followed by 
a strong second half, and in particular an excellent final quarter. For 2013 as a whole, our revenue increased by 
17% to £24,457,000, and operating profit by 135% to £3,550,000, bouncing back from the decline in 2012. Diluted 
earnings per share increased by 137% to 18.7p. This substantial progress resulted entirely from organic growth 
within the business.
The Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 3.0p per share, an increase of 33% over the 2012 final pay-
ment. This would take the full year ordinary dividend payout to 3.9p, an increase of 26%. In addition, and 
reflecting another year of strong cash generation, £1,508,000 was returned to shareholders in October 2013 via a 
12p per share special dividend.
Even after this substantial return of capital, BrainJuicer ended 2013 with cash of £6,188,000 and no debt. 
In view of this, the Board proposes to return a further £1,508,000 to shareholders via another special dividend, 
again of 12p per share. 
The 2013 results mean that over the last 5 years (taking 2008 as the base year), revenue and operating profit 
have grown at an average annual rate of 21% and 22% respectively, despite the disappointing results in 2012. 
Over the same period, diluted earnings per share have increased from 7.4p to 18.7p. The BrainJuicer share price 
has responded very positively to the Company’s good progress. The closing share price as at 19 March 2014 was 
425p, an increase of 294% since the shares were first admitted to trading on AIM in 2006 at a price of 108p.
John Kearon, our Chief Executive or “Chief Juicer,” and James Geddes, our Chief Financial Officer, will review 
BrainJuicer’s 2013 performance and underlying progress in the sections following this Chairman’s Statement. 
From my “top down” perspective, however, the much improved results were driven essentially by a resumption of 
double digit revenue growth, primarily due to our expanding business with major multinational clients, and by a 
reduced rate of cost growth following actions taken towards the end of 2012. With revenues growing much faster 
than costs, profits rose sharply.
In terms of geography, growth in 2013 was fuelled primarily by our two main businesses, the UK and the US. 
It was pleasing to see all of our operations, with the exception of Germany, generating higher revenue, and our 
most recently established businesses, in France, Italy, India and Singapore, getting off to a promising start.
2013 saw a further encouraging shift in the balance of our revenue towards our unique “Juicy” products. Juice 
Generation, our suite of qualitative research services, also delivered impressive growth – contributing 14% of 
total revenue. Our new behavioural consultancy services, while so far generating only modest revenue in their 
own right, are helping us to work even more closely with key clients. 
All of these trends indicate strongly that BrainJuicer’s approach to market research, centred on Behavioural 
Science, leaves us well positioned to deliver further attractive growth in the years to come. While we did not win 
a major piece of international recurring business during 2013, there are signs that we are getting ever closer to 
doing so.
Finally, I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work, determination and enterprise during 
what was a busy and successful year for BrainJuicer.

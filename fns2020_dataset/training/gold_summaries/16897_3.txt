 2 / Walker Greenbank PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Overview
I am pleased to report that the Group continues to make 
encouraging progress in sometimes difficult global markets. 
This progress reﬂects our continued focus on developing our 
product offering, manufacturing capability and international 
sales potential.
The year has seen signiﬁcant growth in the US for the ﬁrst time 
since 2008, with brand sales increasing 17.6% in reportable 
currency, 16.7% in constant currency. 
The US performance has been driven by the success of the 
Harlequin brand, which has increased sales year-on-year by 
39.4% and is now the Group’s biggest selling brand in the US 
market. We believe the US offers signiﬁcant potential for all 
our brands and, to assist in taking advantage of this 
opportunity, we are currently extending our ﬂagship 
showroom in New York.
I am pleased to report that we have grown sales in the UK, 
our largest market, by 2.5%. This growth has been achieved in 
a difficult marketplace but we have seen good responses to 
our new collections, brand development and manufacturing 
investment. The challenging conditions in the Eurozone are 
well documented but we have seen some improvement in 
sales in the second half. Year on year sales in the Eurozone 
have declined 9.4% in reportable currency, 3.0% in 
constant currency. 
Establishing our strong 
position through 
quality brands and 
key partnerships

Outside of the Middle East, we have grown our Rest of the 
World sales by 4.3%, with most major markets making 
progress including growth in the Far East of 5.7%, Eastern 
Europe 3.3%, Australasia 9.2% and a doubling of sales in South 
America. The Middle East has seen a sales decline of 30.8% 
but this is predominantly due to two signiﬁcant contracts in 
the prior year.
We continue to make signiﬁcant progress in extending our 
product range. In the ﬁrst half, we launched Scion, a 
completely new interiors brand aimed at younger customers, 
and Sanderson Home, a competitively priced brand extension. 
In the second half, we have added an entirely new trimmings 
range for both Harlequin and Sanderson together with a 
Harlequin wallpaper collection developed with Orla Kiely, the 
internationally acclaimed designer. In addition, we have 
extended our product offering through new licensing 
arrangements for the Scion brand in bedding, rugs and towels, 
helping us grow our licensing income 18.2%.
Our UK manufacturing base is a key asset that differentiates us 
from others in our industry and puts us at the forefront of 
innovation in printing techniques. In the second half we 
commissioned our ﬁrst high speed digital printer at Standfast, 
our fabric printing factory, and our ﬁrst digital printer at Anstey, 
our wallpaper factory. These new digital printers have helped us 
grow our manufacturing sales and proﬁts on what was a record 
year last year. I am particularly pleased with the 17.5% growth in 
sales to export customers from our manufacturing base. 
Financials
Total sales increased 2.3% to £75.7 million (2012: £74.0 
million). The operating proﬁt before an accounting charge 
relating to the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) rose 10.2% to 
£6.58 million (2012: £5.97 million). The proﬁt from operations 
was up 5.0% to £5.83 million (2012: £5.56 million). 
The interest charge has reduced from £254,000 to £193,000 
due to lower average borrowings. The deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension charge has risen from £407,000 to £704,000 as a 
consequence of a reduction in the expected return on 
scheme assets.
Proﬁt before tax before the LTIP accounting charge and the 
increased deﬁned beneﬁt charge was £6.38 million (2012: 
£5.72 million) an increase of 11.7%. The proﬁt before tax after 
the two charges was £4.93 million (2012: £4.89 million). The 
proﬁt after tax was £3.96 million (2012: £3.83 million) and 
adjusted earnings per share were up 15% after removing the 
LTIP accounting charge and deﬁned beneﬁt charge.
The cash inﬂow from operating activities was £5.80 million 
(2012: £4.28 million), reﬂecting strong operating proﬁts and 
continued investment in product. The Group has continued 
to invest with capital expenditure of £3.12 million (2012: £2.54 
million). Despite this investment, the Group had net funds at 
the year end compared to a net debt of £0.67 million a year 
ago. This is the ﬁrst time the Group has returned to net funds 
since 2000. 
Dividend
During the year, the Group has paid a ﬁnal dividend for the 
year to 31 January 2012 of 1.00p per share and an interim 
dividend of 0.23p per share. The Directors recommend the 
payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 1.25p per share (2012: 1.00p) 
which will be payable on 9 August 2013 to shareholders on 
the register on 19 July 2013. This brings the total dividend  
for the year to 1.48p per share (2012: 1.20p) an increase  
of 23.3%. 
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our 
management and employees for their contribution to another 
successful year. 
Outlook
The current ﬁnancial year has started well. In the ﬁrst 11 
weeks, our UK manufacturing base has performed strongly 
and our brand sales are in line with a strong comparator 
period last year. 
We are excited by our new product launches, including the 
second collection from the Scion brand, and by the 
opportunities to develop our business internationally. We look 
forward with conﬁdence to the year ahead.

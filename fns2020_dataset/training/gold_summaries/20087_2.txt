 Cautionary statement 
This document contains certain ‘forward-looking statements’ with respect to Keller’s 
financial condition, results of operations and business and certain of Keller’s plans and 
objectives with respect to these items.
Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified by their use of a date 
in the future or such words as ‘anticipates’, ‘aims’, ‘due’, ‘will’, ‘could’, ‘may’, ‘should’, ‘expects’, 
‘believes’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘potential’, ‘reasonably possible’, ‘targets’, ‘goal’ or ‘estimates’.  
By their very nature forward-looking statements are inherently unpredictable, speculative 
and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances 
that will occur in the future.
There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to  
differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the economies and markets in 
which the Group operates; changes in the regulatory and competition frameworks in  
which the Group operates; the impact of legal or other proceedings against or which  
affect the Group; and changes in interest and exchange rates.
All written or verbal forward-looking statements, made in this document or made 
subsequently, which are attributable to Keller or any other member of the Group or 
persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the factors 
referred to above. Keller does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.
Nothing in this document should be regarded as a profits forecast.
This document is not an offer to sell, exchange or transfer any securities of Keller Group plc 
or any of its subsidiaries and is not soliciting an offer to purchase, exchange or transfer such 
securities in any jurisdiction. Securities may not be offered, sold or transferred in the United 
States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements  
of the US Securities Act.

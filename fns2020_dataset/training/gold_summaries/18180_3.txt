Conviviality Retail Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
This has been a year 
of growth for the Group 
and the results clearly 
demonstrate the delivery 
of our strategy set out 
in 2013 as we continue 
to develop the business 
and drive growth. 
Our acquisitions of Rhythm & Booze in 
May 2014 and GT News in February 2015 
have strengthened our position and 
enabled growth in new areas. Our ambition 
to increase our presence in Scotland 
has resulted in a trial with Scotmid 
to franchise stores.
The significant changes to the Group 
over the last two years mean that we 
are now in a position to drive sustainable 
growth across the business, deliver value 
to our shareholders and Franchisees and 
continue to provide an exceptional service 
and experience for our customers. 
As a company we are passionate about 
our business and brand, with our values 
being driven from the ground up: passion, 
adaptability, teamwork, excellence and 
professionalism. We run recognition 
schemes throughout the year to celebrate 
employees who demonstrate these values. 
We work with a number of charities with 
a focus on community-based projects as 
we believe we are an important supplier 
and employer in the local community. 
During the year, we supported charities 
including Beanstalk, Cheshire & Shropshire 
Immediate Care and Funky Choir. 
We are pleased to announce that the 
Board is proposing a 5% increase in the 
final dividend to 6.3 pence per share, 
making a full year dividend of 8.3 pence 
per share (2014: 8.0 pence per share).
During the year we welcomed two new 
Board members, Andrew Humphreys 
as Chief Financial Officer in June 2014 
and Amanda Jones as Chief Operating 
Officer in October 2014, completing the 
recruitment of our Executive team. After 
the period end, we appointed Ian Jones 
as a Non-Executive Director; he brings 
with him extensive retail and operational 
experience to complement the Board.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all of our new and existing 
Franchise partners and our employees 
for their continued passion and 
commitment to our Group.

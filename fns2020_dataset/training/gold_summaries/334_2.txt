A
Accelerating healing and managing wounds  
Silver alginate
Silver is widely recognised as a safe and effective broad 
spectrum anti-microbial agent for infection control. We have 
developed a range of wound dressings that incorporate silver 
into our proprietary calcium alginate technology. These 
dressings are suitable for moderate to heavily exuding 
infected wounds. Ongoing technical and clinical support for 
our silver alginate product range has continued to drive 
growth in our silver dressings business and has helped our 
partners capture a 20% global market share in just  
five years, second only to the dominant leader.
Foam
In October 2009 we strengthened our position in hydrophilic 
polyurethane foam, by acquiring the Corpura B.V. business 
based in The Netherlands. In 2010, we saw the first full year 
contribution from this business. Foam is one of the fastest 
growing segments of the advanced woundcare sector and 
provides an ideal platform for delivering actives and  
anti-microbials to help accelerate wound healing. Foam 
revenues have benefited from a number of product  
launches with key partners. 3 Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2010  
 
ActivHeal® 
ActivHeal® is a cost-effective range of 
products supplied directly to the NHS 
as first-line therapy for routine wounds, 
generating significant cost savings and 
equivalent clinical performance over 
branded equivalents.
Our compelling 
proposition has  
increased sales by 21% 
as the NHS
 
responds to 
budgetary pressure.
Following a relaunch of the product range, 
in new, distinctive and easily recognisable 
packaging, ActivHeal® is a product of first 
choice when it comes to cost-effective 
dressing of non-infected wounds.

Minimising adverse surgical outcomes
LiquiBand® Surgical
‘close and protect’ tissue sealant
Approval has been received to market our LiquiBand® Surgical 
‘close and protect’ tissue adhesive in the US. We are working 
with key surgeons to design the ideal delivery system for this 
surgical device. We now have a product range that covers 100% 
of the target, topical tissue adhesive market in the US.
Surgical sealants
Our clinically proven range of surgical sealants are an essential 
tool in the fight to reduce surgical site infections. Prepping  
and draping are an important part of any pre-op routine but  
do not completely sterilise a patient’s skin. Our range of 
surgical sealants are proven to seal and immobilise the 
bacteria that survive the patient prep, preventing them from 
contaminating the surgical incision site. Finding the right 
partners to successfully access the Operating Room is a focus 
for the management team. 
Internal fixation device
Progress continues to be made in the development of an 
implantable adhesive device for the internal fixation of materials, 
such as hernia meshes, via minimally invasive surgery. Successful 
completion of this project will allow entry of our tissue adhesive 
range into the high-value internal sealants market, currently 
estimated to be valued around $600m per year.

Sealing and closing tissue 
Progress has been excellent in our first 12 months of 
promotional activity. A high number of clinical evaluations 
took place in 2010, with hospitals trying the product for the 
first time. We are pleased with both the outcome of the 
evaluations and the speed with which hospitals are 
converting to regular usage.
We have four distribution partners promoting LiquiBand® 
including Cardinal Health, which has a substantial sales force 
targeting the Acute Care segment (80% of the US tissue 
adhesives market), and the largest US pharmaceutical 
distributor targeting the Alternate Site segment (the other 
20% of the market). We are well placed to challenge the 
dominant market leader.
With the approval of LiquiBand® Surgical ‘close and protect’ 
tissue sealant received for the US, we now have a full range of 
products that address the total tissue adhesive market.
The launch of LiquiBand® into the key 
$220 million US market has been a 
pivotal milestone for the Group 7 Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2010

Building strong partnerships
We have strong relationships 
with the leading global 
healthcare suppliers
How we operate
Branded partners
Working with most of the world's leading woundcare 
companies, our products are distributed globally. We believe 
that the most effective way of commercialising new concepts 
and technologies on a global basis is through strategic 
partnerships with major branded companies.
Private label
We also provide own-label products to distributors driven by 
the increasing cost constraints faced by healthcare providers. 
These products allow savings to be made in the treatment 
of routine wounds. 
Distributors
Our LiquiBand® range of tissue adhesives is sold under the 
LiquiBand® brand by distributors and marketing partners in 
Europe and the US.
Quality & regulatory
One of the continuing strengths of the Group is its ability to 
work with different regulatory bodies throughout the world  
to gain regulatory approval for our products. It is pleasing that 
since 2005 we have successfully gained 33 approvals for both 
ourselves and our partners.
The Group’s manufacturing facilities are in compliance with  
ISO 13485.
New site
The new Winsford facility was officially opened in January 201 1. 
It provides the capacity to support the growth of the Group 
and a facility that addresses the increasingly stringent demands 
being placed on medical device companies by various 
regulatory bodies. With nearly £10 million of investment made 
over the last two years, it demonstrates our long term 
commitment to our woundcare partners.
We continue to improve our methods of working and are now 
taking the opportunity to embrace the principles of lean 
manufacturing, positioning the Group for improved future 
operational efficiency. 9 Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2010

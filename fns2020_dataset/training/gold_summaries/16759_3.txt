 Chairman’s introduction 
04 Vislink plc report and accounts 2007
Introduction
In 2007 , we delivered year-on-year growth in a number of key
financial performance metrics including underlying revenue, margin,
earnings per share and cash generated from operating activities.
We also successfully completed the acquisition of Western Technical
Services which is in line with our strategic growth plan to build US
service and integration revenues in the broadcast, law enforcement
and security markets.
Financial results
In 2007 the adjusted operating margin has improved to 15.9 per
cent of revenue (2006 – 14.2 per cent) generating a 13.5 per cent
increase in adjusted earnings per share.
Revenue for the year grew by 7 .4 per cent, excluding the effects 
of exchange on translation of £4.9 million and reduced sales 
on the completed legacy Venezuelan contract of £4.0 million.
Headline revenues were £98.6 million (2006 – £100.5 million). 
The Group has been able to continue to improve its operating 
profit and operating margins. The adjusted operating profit, 
being operating profit from continuing operations before the
amortisation of acquired intangibles, increased by 9.6 per cent 
to £15.7 million (2006 – £14.3 million). This increase is after an 
adverse impact from foreign exchange on translation of £0.8 million.
Operating profit from continuing operations was up by 9.9 per cent
to £14.2 million (2006 – £12.9 million). Profit before tax was up by
10.1 per cent to £14.0 million (2006 – £12.7 million).
The Group net cash inflow generated from operating activities was
£9.3 million (2006 – £8.4 million). After increased capital expenditure
and acquisition costs the Group held net funds of £3.5 million at 
December 31, 2007 (December 31, 2006 – £3.9 million).
Dividend and shareholder returns
The basic undiluted earnings per share for the year was 6.47 pence
(2006 – 5.65 pence). After adjusting for the amortisation of acquired
intangibles, the adjusted earnings per share increased 13.5 per cent 
to 7 .21 pence (2006 – 6.35 pence). As a result of this strong
performance, the Board is proposing a 25 per cent increase in the 
full-year dividend to 1.25 pence per share (2006 – 1.00 pence).
Board and management changes
Ian Scott-Gall, our Chief Executive, has announced that he will be
retiring at the end of this financial year. On behalf of the Board, 
and our employees I would like to thank Ian for his substantial
contribution to the Group over the last nine years, during which 
time the Group has been transformed through acquisitions and
strong organic growth into a group of highly profitable technology
businesses. The search for a new Chief Executive is now underway.
Tony Finizio has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer of 
our US operations. At the same time we strengthened the US
management team by appointing Morgan Kurk as President 
of MRC. Morgan was previously Vice President and General 
Manager of the Andrew Corporation Wireless Solutions Group.
In 2007, we delivered year-
on-year growth in a number 
of key financial performance
metrics including underlying
revenue, margin, earnings 
per share and cash generated
from operating activities.

 Eland Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 4
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Harry Wilson
Chairman
I am pleased to introduce Eland’s second annual report which has 
seen your Company make significant progress over the year on a 
number of fronts. This has not been an easy year but despite 
experiencing delays in operations on our OML 40 licence we 
achieved first oil in early 2014, with production from the Opuama 
field largely as a result of the experienced team we have in Nigeria. 
We are now starting to see the real value of our Nigerian asset.
The focus during 2013 has been on rehabilitating the Opuama field 
working with the Operator (NPDC) to put back in production the 
two wells which were shut-in in March 2006. This has involved 
re-commissioning the flowstation facilities and wellheads as well as 
laying new flowlines and repairing the export pipeline. This enabled 
us to start production in February 2014 somewhat later than hoped 
for but with very pleasing production rates. We have also 
undertaken a major review of the prospectivity of the licence largely 
through the extensive 3D seismic data which has not previously 
been used to identify drilling targets. This resulted in a significant 
increase in net 2P reserves and 2C resources in the report by our 
reserves auditor Netherland Sewell & Associates Inc. We are 
confident of further increases as the operational work proceeds. 
The financial performance for 2013 (a loss of $26.1 million) largely 
reflects the expected increased costs as our operations in Nigeria 
gathered pace. At the end of 2013 our cash and cash equivalents 
were $3.8 million with undrawn bank debt facilities of $22 million 
which have been extended to February 2015. More recently the two 
equity options were exercised in full raising a further £20 million. We 
have also made good progress on securing advantageous tax terms 
which may result in a five year tax-free period for OML 40 in Nigeria.
I would like to thank all our stakeholders for their support and 
particularly the management and staff for their hard work and 
persistence over the year. We have a very experienced Board which 
ensures that the highest levels of corporate governance are 
maintained in the conduct of our business. James Ede-Golightly and 
Gilles Krijger have both stepped down from the Board and I would 
especially like to thank them for their contribution during the 
start-up phase of Eland. Our team is still growing and our aspiration 
is to become the leading international oil company operating 
in Nigeria.
The strategy of Eland is based on the opportunities that Nigeria 
offers and the experience of our management team based on the 
ground. The increasing awareness of Nigeria’s potential is reflected 
in the scramble for assets being disposed of by the majors in recent 
months. We are of course looking at these and other assets and 
look forward to updating our shareholders on this front and with 
further progress on OML 40 over the coming months.

A PORTFOLIO IN A LICENCE
OML 40 is a world-class asset with production, booked oil reserves, an 
export pipeline and plentiful contingent and prospective resources. The 
OML 40 area currently produces light oil with low GOR and has a very 
strong aquifer drive resulting in high ultimate recoveries. 
The OML 40 partnership successfully recommenced oil production from  
the Opuama field in February 2014 through the re-commissioning of the 
existing infrastructure and the re-opening of two existing wells.
OML 40’s booked reserves are found in Opuama in the western, and 
Gbetiokun in the eastern, part of the licence. Our primary contingent 
resources lie in the Polobo and Abiala fields and in addition there are 
numerous prospects and leads across the whole of the OML 40 licence.

History
 ` OML 40 was awarded to SPDC in 1964.
 ` The Opuama field was in production from 1975 until 2006 and 
during that period produced 43.4 mmbbl. 
 ` In 2006, SPDC undertook a controlled shut down of OML  
40 due to community disturbances and pipeline disruption 
near the Forcados Oil Terminal.
 ` In September 2012 Elcrest Exploration & Production Nigeria 
Limited purchased a 45% interest in the OML 40 licence.
 ` The Opuama field was returned to production in  
February 2014.

The Opuama field was discovered in 1972 and hydrocarbons 
were found at 12 different levels. Of these 12 reservoirs, the 
largest four account for over 90% of the total field reserves.  
The reservoirs contain light crudes with API gravities ranging 
from 47.5� in the shallow reservoirs to 37.8� in the deep and 
saturated reservoirs. There has been very little pressure 
depletion over the 30 plus years of production, which indicates  
a strong aquifer support and consequently leading to very high 
total ultimate oil recoveries.
The oil production from the Opuama wells is received at the 
Opuama flowstation where it is, after initial treatment, pumped 
via the Otumara manifold into the Shell-operated Trans Escravos 
Pipeline network to the Forcados Oil Terminal.

54.2 mmbbl
FIRST OIL AND HOW WE GOT THERE
 ` Oil production from the Opuama field was re-started in 
February 2014 through the successful re-commissioning of 
existing infrastructure and the re-opening of existing wells 
Opuama 1 and Opuama 3 (dual completion).
 ` Replacement of the three flowlines of the start-up wells. These 
flowlines have been trenched and overlaid with protective 
concrete mats at major water crossings.
 ` Rehabiliation work on the flowstation.
 ` Repair of the 8” and 10” sections of the export pipeline which 
make up the first 12km of the export pipeline as well as the 
24km long final 12” section leading to the custody transfer 
point at Otumara.
WHAT NEXT?
A detailed field review was undertaken in 2013 resulting in a Field 
Development Plan (‘FDP’) for the exploitation of the remaining 
reserves. The FDP defines drilling a total of seven new 
development wells, which aim at infill targets in the main reservoirs 
D1000, D2000, D5000 and E2000. It also includes carrying out 
appraisals with the possibility of developments on three so-called 
intra reservoirs, which carry at present total contingent resources 
of some 8 mmbbl. All new wells will be drilled from a central 
location near the flowstation minimising the environmental and 
social impact, increasing efficiency and ensuring security and 
safety of the facilities.
The development concept is:
 ` Drill seven new wells 
 − Four slightly deviated wells on the D1000 and D2000 
reservoirs, 
 − Two horizontal wells on the E2000 reservoir,
 − One deviated well on the D5000 reservoir.
 ` Appraisal of deeper reservoirs in the earlier development  
wells to assess further development potential and to obtain 
depth control. 
The wells will be drilled with a swamp rig after dredging of the 
existing access canals to enable easy access. After completion of 
the wells the Opuama gross production is expected to reach over 
25,000 bopd.

OTHER RESERVES IN OML 40
OML 40 is an underdeveloped asset and currently has one producing 
field, the Opuama field. The Gbetiokun field has been fully appraised and 
a number of development drilling locations identified, as part of a full Field 
Development Plan.
2. GBETIOKUN
Highlights
Discovered: 1987
Gross 2P: 27.6 mmbbl
Location: 63km NW of Warri
Reservoir Depth: 4,500 – 10,000ft
Distance from Opuama flowstation: 27km to the SE
History
 ` Gbetiokun is located 63km North West of Warri on the 
boundary of OML 40 and OML 49, which is operated by 
Chevron. The field is known as Gbetiokun in OML 40 whilst the 
extension of the field in OML 49 is called Bime.
 ` The field was discovered by well Gbetiokun 1 in 1987 and 
presently four wells have been drilled on the structure (two in 
OML 40 and two in OML 49).
 ` The Bime wells are located close to the licence boundary 
between OML 40 and OML 49 and provided valuable 
information about the eastern flank of the field. The extension 
to the east is very limited with the second Bime appraisal well 
not finding any hydrocarbons. 
 ` The latest appraisal well Gbetiokun 2 was drilled in August 1991 
on the western flank of the field where it found a significant 
number of reservoirs containing hydrocarbons. 
A total of 20 hydrocarbon reservoirs have been identified  
in the Gbetiokun field. The crude is generally characterised as 
having a low viscosity, high API gravities from 39-41� and also 
being under-saturated.
PVT samples were taken in the discovery well and the results  
of the PVT analysis have indicated the presence of good quality 
oil. The reservoirs are similar to those found in Opuama and it  
is considered very likely that they will have moderate to strong 
aquifer drive.
Detailed geological studies, supplemented with development 
studies, resulted in a Field Development Plan (FDP). The field is 
planned to be produced through an early production facility 
which contains equipment needed for oil treatment, pumping 
and gas compression. A 30km wet crude export pipeline is 
planned to join the Opuama-Otumara export pipeline system.

CONTINGENT RESOURCES
In addition to Opuama and Gbetiokun, there are five other discovered and 
undeveloped fields in OML 40, the largest of which are discussed below. 
These fields may provide a conveyor belt of reserve additions as they are 
appraised further. 
3. POLOBO
Highlights
Discovered: 1972
Gross 2C: 21.5 mmbbl
Location: OML 40 West
Reservoir Depth: 6,000 – 6,100ft
Distance from Opuama flowstation: 11km to the NW
The Polobo discovery was made in 1972 based on 2D seismic. 
The full structure was probably not evident from the 2D seismic 
interpretation. However, following the acquisition of 3D seismic, 
Polobo has been upgraded to an exciting contingent resource.
Polobo is 11km north-west of the Opuama flowstation and could 
be easily tied into the existing facilities. The Polobo discovery 
well was drilled to a depth of 9,712ft. Oil was found over a 96ft 
thick interval. RFT tests confirmed the presence of under-
saturated oil with an API gravity of 47�. An appraisal well is 
planned in the near future and, if successful, provides the 
opportunity for an accelerated development with production 
through the Opuama flowstation.
4. ABIALA
Highlights
Discovered: 1989
Gross 2C: 16.1 mmbbl
Location: OML 40 North East
Reservoir Depth: 6,800 – 11,000ft
Distance from Opuama flowstation: 24km to the NE
The Abiala discovery was made in 1989 and is located in the 
north-east of OML 40 near the northern boundary of the licence. 
Using 3D reprocessed seismic in 2009 it became clear that the 
Abiala discovery well had crossed a fault between the Abiala 
North and Abiala South blocks effectively proving up further 
potential in both fault blocks. Abiala therefore has significant 
near-field potential which will need to be appraised. 
Future development wells will be designed to capture all the 
reservoirs within a particular fault block, whilst pilot holes will be 
drilled and plugged back as a cheap and efficient way of exploring 
the near-field prospective upside. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information

OML 40’s other contingent resources are the Ugbo and 
Adagbassa Creek fields. Ugbo was discovered in 1991 and is 
located in the central-eastern part of OML 40. Ugbo 1 
discovered a shallow oil-bearing reservoir of some 24ft above a 
possible oil-water contact. The top 10ft was tested and flowed 
200 bopd with an API gravity of 37.8° and a 5% water cut. 
Seismic analysis poses some challenges, and Ugbo is still under 
study. Currently the hydrocarbon volumes around the well are 
considered relatively small. However, it carries significant 
prospective resources with a best estimate of 15.7 mmbbl, 
which makes it an attractive target to explore further. 
Adagbassa Creek was discovered in 1971 and is located in the 
centre of OML 40. Three wells have been drilled by the previous 
operator, SPDC. The discovery well found two hydrocarbon 
intervals: the shallow C4 reservoir at 4,875-4,910ft, and a deeper 
E3 reservoir at 9,132-9,178ft. The C4 reservoir was reported to be 
oil bearing, but RFTs taken only recovered drilling fluids. The E3 
reservoir was production tested and produced 1,300 bopd with 
a GOR of 1,850 cu ft/bbl. Estimated contingent resources are 
1.5 mmbbl of oil and 294 Bcf of gas. It is planned to acquire 
additional 3D seismic over this area with further subsurface 
studies determining the potential for future appraisal drilling. 
This well is likely to be deepened to explore the potential of 
Adagbassa Deep.

PROSPECTIVE RESOURCES AND LEADS
Beyond the discovered fields is a larger prize consisting of 
already identified near-field opportunities and prospects, which 
can be drilled in the near future using the drilling rigs scheduled 
for the Opuama and Gbetiokun development drilling.

 Oil field
 CR – Oil Discoveries
  PR – Based on 
3D seismic
  Leads – Based on

 Gas discovery
In the longer term the resource base will be augmented through 
developing leads (additional 3D surveys and detailed studies) 
into drillable prospects. Many of these were already identified by 
the previous operator SPDC. In-house studies by Eland based on 
reprocessed 3D surveys have not only confirmed these SPDC 
concepts, but added additional prospects and leads. The 
recoverable volumes of the prospects and leads qualify as 
prospective resources. 
In the western area of OML 40 the prospects are Amobe, Polobo 
South and Opuama North. Furthermore, there could be possible 
extensions of Ojumole and Tsekelewu (outside OML 40) into the 
OML 40 block. Also, a number of isolated closures have been 
identified but these are generally too small on their own to 
warrant an economic development. The possible extensions and 
isolated closures have not been incorporated in our present 
analysis, nor in the prospective resources.
In the eastern area of OML 40 there are a large number of 
prospects covered by 3D seismic surveys. The central part of 
OML 40 is not covered by 3D seismic surveys. In this corridor, a 
number of 2D seismic lines have been shot. The previous 
operator has identified significant prospects in this area, which 
have been classified as leads until this corridor is covered by 3D 
seismic as well. 
Finally, a number of deep turbidite plays are recognised, namely 
Adagbassa Deep, Polobo Deep, Abiala Deep, and Gbetiokun 
Deep, but these studies are too immature to carry prospective 
resources and require further detailed studies to mature as 
drillable prospects. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information

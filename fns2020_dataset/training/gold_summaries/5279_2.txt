2014 built on the achievements of 2013. The 
installed base of active point-of-care analysers 
is estimated to be more than 80,000 providing 
a consistent demand for tests. Clinical 
chemistry continues to be a competitive 
market and yet Beta-Hydroxybutyrate 
Liquicolor sales grew through a sustained 
focus in the USA.
Molecular diagnostics contributed revenues for 
the ﬁ rst time with Selah Genomics, acquired in 
April 2014, providing new revenue streams from 
a portfolio of molecular test services. EKF’s 
proprietary molecular testing platform, 
PointMan
™ 
also delivered revenues from the 
research-use-only market ahead of the planned 
release of CE marked products in 2015.

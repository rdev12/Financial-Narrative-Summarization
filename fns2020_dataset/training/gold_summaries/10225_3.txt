 Eric Yeatman
Chairman
2012 was a year of good progress for the
Company. We signed an OEM (Original
Equipment Manufacturer) agreement with
Biotage AB, and developed our first
integrated product with them, which has
been introduced to the market at trade
fairs and is being very well received by
customers.
We also welcomed Colin Jump as our new Chief Executive
to lead the Company in capturing the opportunities that lie
ahead. Colin brings many years’ experience with him from
the scientific instrument sector. He joined us from Shimadzu
UK where he was Managing Director and we are delighted
to have him on board. In his first months he has already
brought his expert knowledge of the industry to bear in our
external relationships and our planning for the future.
Colin’s first statement as Chief Executive outlines the
achievements of the Company over the past year and the
strategy for delivering value to our shareholders over the
coming year and beyond.
Peter Selway, a Non-executive Director of Microsaic for ten
years, retired at the 2012 Annual General Meeting having
reached the age of 70. We owe Peter a debt of gratitude for
his contribution and wise counsel over that time and wish
him a long and happy retirement.
On a personal note, I would like to take the opportunity to
thank the Board and staff for their support whilst I was
Acting CEO, and particularly to Colin Nicholl who took on
the role of Chairman for that period. Following Colin
Jump’s appointment, I have resumed the role of Chairman
and Colin Nicholl has reverted to Deputy Chairman.
I would also like to thank our shareholders for their support
during 2012 and I look forward with confidence to 2013 as
the Company, led by Colin Jump, advances towards
achieving our business goals.

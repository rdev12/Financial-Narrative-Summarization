Strategic Report
Chairman’ s statement
Diversified portfolio delivering consistent 
performance in a challenging market.
I have always believed that the ability to produce robust results  
in volatile markets is the hallmark of a strong and agile company. 
I am therefore pleased to announce another set of commendable 
operating and financial results delivered by our management 
team and employees, as we mark a decade at Vedanta.
Ten years ago we had a vision to create a 
large global diversified natural resources 
major that unlocks the remarkable resource 
potential of India, meets the growing 
demand of a nation of a billion people, and 
gives investors an opportunity to participate 
in the journey with the comfort of a premium 
listing on the London Stock Exchange.
We believe the benefits have been felt 
all-round: since our IPO at 390 pence in 
December 2003, shareholders have seen 
a Total Shareholder Return of over 200% 
and we have paid a progressive dividend 
that was increased in nine out of 10 
years and held constant for one year.
We now stand as one of the world’s 
largest diversified resources company with 
operations in India, Zambia, Namibia, 
South Africa, Ireland, Liberia, Australia and 
Sri Lanka, which directly and indirectly, 
enhances the lives of at least 4.1 million 
people across the world. As we look back 
over this first decade I am proud of the 
contribution that we have made, both 
fiscally and socially, to the exchequer, our 
employees and the numerous communities 
in and around our operations.
Highlights of the year
Vedanta has again shown that the 
fundamentals of our business remain 
strong. We have a diversified portfolio 
of assets that have cost-efficient 
operations, are highly productive, and 
have generated strong free cash flows of 
US$1.6 billion after capital expenditure 
on sustaining and expansion projects.
In particular we were delighted with the 
performance of the Oil & Gas division, 
Cairn India, which passed two notable 
milestones during the year. The onshore, 
prolific, Rajasthan block achieved the 
landmark of 200 million barrels of 
cumulative oil production over its life, 
and also reached a production rate of 
200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day 
in March 2014, against a production rate 
of 125,000 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day, when we acquired this business.
I warmly congratulate the team on this fine 
achievement, and I also thank the Indian 
government whose partnership has been 
crucial. Cairn now produces 27% of India’s 
oil production and with the Government’s 
focus on increasing India’s oil production, 
it can contribute further to helping reduce 
India’s dependence on imported oil & gas 
which still accounts for 75% of its needs.
Zinc India is the second largest integrated 
zinc producer globally with a mine life 
of more than 25 years and costs in the 
lowest quartile of the global cost curve. 
It delivered an excellent performance 
with a record production of mined 
and integrated refined metal.
Financial performance
The year saw revenues of US$12.9 
billion and an EBITDA of US$4.5 billion 
despite lower commodity prices.
EBITDA reflected weaker global commodity 
and oil prices, increased rate of share of profit 
on petroleum to the Government of India, 
although these were partly offset by lower 
costs in aluminium, increased volumes at 
Zinc India and our record oil production.
We also experienced lower volumes at 
Konkola Copper Mine (‘KCM’) and Zinc 
International and Iron Ore, where the 
state-wide bans on mining in Karnataka 
and Goa were lifted in December 2013 
and April 2014 respectively, albeit with 
conditions. We resumed mining in Karnataka 
in December, and are currently working with 
the State Government and the Environment 
Ministry to restart operations in Goa. Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements Additional Information

Delivering against our strategy
As well as producing satisfactory results, we 
remained focused on our core strategy.
It was a year when we eased back on 
capital expenditure and concentrated on 
production. Despite inflationary pressures, 
we succeeded in controlling our costs; in 
aluminium, for example, we rank in the 
second quartile, even ahead of many others 
who enjoy the advantage of captive bauxite.
We continued to reduce net debt 
which now stands 8% down at 
US$7 .9 billion, and generated strong 
free cash flow of US$3.0 billion.
I was also pleased to see further progress on 
our goal to discover more than we mine out. 
During the year we delivered a 100% reserve 
replacement at Oil & Gas and Zinc India.
In addition, we responded to an often-
received feedback from shareholders for 
a simpler group structure by completing 
the Sesa Sterlite merger during the year, 
which has eliminated cross-holdings, 
better aligns cash flow generation 
and debt across the Group structure 
and delivers valuable synergies.

Sustainability
I have always felt deeply that it is our 
employees who drive our success. It has 
therefore been a priority that they have 
been able to grow with us, both financially 
and personally, and that we contribute to 
their well-being and development. We’ve 
developed incentive plans to broaden 
share ownership among our middle 
and senior management, so they also 
become shareholders of our Company.
However, even growth is a secondary 
consideration compared to the need to work 
safely and to minimise our impact on the 
environment. We were deeply saddened 
by the 19 fatalities that occurred during 
the year and both our incoming CEO and I 
are determined to address this as we make 
personal safety an absolute priority. 
It was good to see a reduction of 37% in lost 
time incidents over the last four years, and 
74% of non-hazardous waste being recycled 
during the year which shows an encouraging 
progress. Over the past year, I have been 
particularly pleased with the success our 
businesses’ have had in implementing our 
Sustainability Framework underpinned by 
our successful Scott Wilson audit and the 
insights we have gained from this exercise.
Out in our communities, we continued 
to expand our support programmes. 
We have seven discrete focus areas: 
health, education, sustainable livelihoods, 
women empowerment, community 
asset creation, bio-investment and 
integrated village development. During 
the year we spent US$49 million, 
benefiting over 4.1 million people.

Governance
At the close of the year our CEO of five years 
MS Mehta took well-earned retirement. I 
wish to place on record my thanks to him; 
he joined us around 14 years ago and led 
various operations across the Group. His 
insight and leadership have been pivotal 
to our success over this first decade and 
he departs with our warmest wishes.
We are also delighted to have secured a 
replacement of the calibre of Tom Albanese, 
who took up the reins as our new CEO on 1 
April 2014. Tom brings with him a lifetime’s 
experience in resource mining and operations 
and will add considerable value as we meet 
the opportunities and challenges ahead.
During the year, Deepak Parekh, the 
non-executive Chairman of the Housing 
Development Finance Corporation (‘HDFC’) 
Limited, India’s premier housing finance 
company, joined the Vedanta Board as an 
independent Non-Executive Director. I would 
also like to thank Naresh Chandra who retired 
from the Board following the conclusion of 
the 2013 Annual General Meeting having 
served nearly nine years on the Board.

Outlook
India’s per capita consumption of 
commodities is expected to rise consistently 
and strongly over the next two–three 
decades with favourable demographics 
and growing urbanisation, and as a large 
and responsible corporation, Vedanta is 
well positioned to supply India’s need for 
commodities while operating at international 
standards of sustainable development. 
FY2013–14 has been a year of building 
momentum in the right direction, and I 
see it as a powerful springboard for the 
year ahead as we build on the significant 
headway achieved in production ramp-
ups, cost controls, regulatory clearances 
and sustainability. We remain focused on 
our stated strategic priorities of ramping 
up production across our portfolio and 
to deleverage the balance sheet.

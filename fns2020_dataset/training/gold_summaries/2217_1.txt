Chief Executive’s Review.
In January of last year we set out the 
turnaround plan for the Blacks Leisure 
Group business.    
The primary focus of the initial phase was 
to reduce the cost base. On this measure 
we considerably exceeded expectations 
with the cost base being reduced by 
£6.6m in the year against the original 
target of £3m.
The next objective was to provide the 
Group with greater security at a time 
of banking uncertainty by significantly 
reducing our working capital requirement. 
Over the year we reduced our debt 
facility from £40m to £35m by managing 
our supply chain more effectively and 
reducing range duplication within stores.
Thirdly we set out to develop two new 
outdoor retailing formats for Blacks and 
Millets which would provide us with the 
opportunity to refresh and update our 
estate. We trialled units in Kensington, 
Stockport, Holborn, Haverfordwest, 
Croydon and two in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. 
These new format stores have performed 
well at 14.7% better than the fascia 
average and given us the confidence that 
we have successful models which we 
can roll out across the estate as funding 
allows.   
We have also made significant progress 
in resolving the issue of our Boardwear 
business. This has been a declining 
category for several years as consumer 
tastes have changed and the items 
retailed in this format have become more 
generally available. During the year we 
rationalised the Boardwear business 
by closing the Washington (O’Neill) 
warehouse and offices and combining the 
O’Neill, Freespirit and Outdoor overheads 
into one. We also managed to exit the 
loss making and cash consuming O’Neill 
wholesale contract without penalty 
and we have converted eight of the 
Boardwear stores to our new Blacks 
Outdoor format and initial results suggest 
that this has worked well.    
    
Finally, we have redesigned our Millets 
and Blacks websites and improved 
the logistical infrastructure behind this 
growing part of our offer with the result 
that internet sales have more than 
doubled in the current year to date.   
     
In summary, a great deal of progress has 
been made in a short time to streamline 
and enhance the business. Unfortunately, 
this had to be completed in the teeth of 
a significant retail recession which has 
added huge additional pressures to the 
already major task of delivering a business 
turnaround.    
 “Eighteen months 
into the turnaround 
plan I am pleased 
with the progress 
we have made.”

However, the work that we have done 
has not only enabled us to weather this 
recession but has also placed Blacks 
Leisure in an excellent position to take full 
advantage of the consumer upturn as and 
when it occurs.    
  
Eighteen months into the turnaround plan 
I am pleased with the progress we have 
made. We have reduced costs, reduced 
our working capital and significantly 
reduced our exposure to the declining 
Boardwear business. 
We have also grown our internet 
business, developed new store formats 
which have grown by 14.7% and in the 
first twelve weeks of the new financial 
year grown like-for-like sales in our 
Outdoor business by 1.2%. We are a 
streamlined, enhanced and more focused 
business with the potential to deliver 
strong and sustainable growth.

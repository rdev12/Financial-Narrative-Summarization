 The Group’s two divisions made good 
progress in 2013 with both increasing 
their revenues and operating profits 
compared with 2012.
The move from our multiple offices in New York City into a single location at Times Square in 
June 2013 has completed the integration of the business. 
Baseball representation
The baseball representation business, which derives revenues through long term 
relationships with many established and young players, had a solid year. Revenues increased 
by 30% to $13.1 million in 2013 (2012: $10.1 million), reflecting like for like organic growth of 
2% and the first full year contribution from PEG. Based in New York City, PEG is particularly 
strong in representing Spanish-speaking players of Latin American origin. 
A total of $150 million worth of contracts were signed on behalf of clients during the 2013 
off-season (2012: $210 million). This was lower than 2012 due to fewer contracts requiring 
negotiation for 2013. 76 new baseball players were added to the client list in 2013 bringing 
the total baseball client list to 249 (2012: 173)
The roster of potential new stars also continued to grow with 190 Minor League Baseball 
clients (2012: 117) of which 19 (2012: 18) were called up to major league teams thereby 
starting their initial three year service period. This will enable us to negotiate future 
contracts on their behalf at higher market related salaries on which TLA will start to earn 
fees in the coming years. 
Looking ahead, a new eight-year TV rights contract for MLB commences with the 2014 
baseball season, which will substantially increase MLB revenue. The agreement, worth $12.4 
billion over eight years to MLB, represents an increase of more than 100% in annual rights 
fees to MLB compared with previous years. As a result, many player contracts have been 
structured to match this revenue profile, with lower salaries in 2013 and then increases in 
future years. This will clearly benefit our clients and therefore the Group in 2014 
and beyond.
As set out in the Group’s half-year results, the Draft (the mechanism for appropriating 
young players to teams) did not produce the revenues that we expected. This was caused by

Sports marketing 
The Sports Marketing division continued to grow with revenues increasing 10% to $5.5 million 
(2012: $5.0 million). We now have 12 PGA clients (2012:13), including some of Golf’s hottest 
young talents evidenced by two Tour wins and 25 top 10 PGA TOUR finishes in 2013, with a 
further three wins in 2014. 
PGA TOUR revenues rose in 2012 to a record high of $1.1 billion, highlighted by a nine-year 
television deal, which commenced in 2011 and averages $800 million per annum. These 
markets are key drivers for the growth of TLA’s Sports Marketing Division as they underpin 
marketing spend and increase our ability to secure sponsorship opportunities for our clients.
Talent marketing continued to perform well in commercially promoting its clients, 
securing sponsorship deals for clients with such companies as GEICO, Under Armour, Adidas 
and Web.com, as well as advising Izod and Samsung with their golf brand activation at the 
Masters and the US Open. We also secured our first National Basketball Association client, 
Trey Burke. 
Coaching and broadcasting continues to grow. We now have the leading NCAA basketball 
coaching business, increasing our client base by 15% and increasing our representation of 
coaches with teams in the 2013 NCAA Champions Tournament by 38%. In broadcasting we 
have grown our representation by 17.6% to 40 clients (2012: 34), who include Jay Onrait and 
Dan O’Toole, the new hosts of Fox Sports 1.
We have added new service offerings to the Sports Marketing business by internally 
developing our ability to advise rights holders and teams on their media value rights. We 
expect to see both the events and the media rights consulting businesses contribute further 
during 2014 and provide growth to TLA in the future.
At the end of 2013 we opened an office in Melbourne to pursue the strong sports 
marketing and event opportunities that exist in the Australasian market. The opportunity in 
this market is borne out by the fact that the first MLB games of the 2014 season were played 
in Sydney in late March 2014, with other opportunities of a similar nature, currently live and 
moving to contract.
New revenue streams
We created and delivered our first event around the MLB All-Star baseball game, which took 
place in July 2013, and followed this up with a similar event around NFL’s Super Bowl in 
January 2014. We also created a larger two-day event called “Baseball City”, which took place 
in Phoenix in March 2014 and was timed to align with fans that attended baseball spring 
training. The event was successful and made a small profit.
Since the year-end, we have been appointed by the National Hockey League (NHL), to 
promote and sell its digital content in the Australian market.

 2 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Chairman’ s statement

Shaping a more focused group
Adjusted pre-tax profit in 2005 
was up 7 per cent to £124.1 million
(2004: £115.6 million), with pre-tax
profit* for the year being
£25.4 million (2004: £91.2 million).
During 2005, we saw strong
performance in our Engineering
and Technical Services activities 
and in our Oil and Gas business.
Results overall were depressed 
by our UK construction activities.
We have taken action in the UK and
as a result have incurred costs to
exit several unattractive activities.
Strong performance in our other
activities enabled us to report good
progress and proposed dividends
for the year are increased by 
4.5 per cent to 11.5 pence per share
(2004: 11.0 pence). The outlook for
overall progress** in 2006 remains 
in line with our earlier expectations.
These results reflect, and support,
our strategy of focusing on
attractive energy and process
markets, while continuing to 
build an increasingly attractive
portfolio of equity investments.

Energy markets hold 
real promise
International energy markets hold
real promise as we look ahead. 
As I write, AMEC is contributing 
to the UK Government’s important
review of energy policy – which
looks at the serious question of
investment in the energy assets 
of the future. Worldwide,
governments anticipate rapidly
rising energy demand, which will
drive investment in new energy
assets and benefit companies 
like AMEC that design, deliver 
and support these assets. 
In this context, the energy
acquisitions we completed during
2005 are particularly significant.
We acquired the oil and gas services
company Paragon, gaining a
position in the important Houston
market. We strengthened our
position in the UK, Canadian and
international nuclear markets 
with the acquisition of NNC, 
the UK’s leading private sector
nuclear services business. Both
businesses are performing well.
Maturing portfolio 
of investments
In recent years, we have built an
attractive portfolio of investments
in PPP and property developments
and a strong position in wind energy,
all of which are expected to become
increasingly valuable over the 
next few years.
During 2005, we took important
steps to improve our performance 
in UK construction, not just 
exiting markets but restructuring
the business, putting in a new
management team and addressing
the cost base. As a result of these
actions, we can look forward 
to a better year in 2006.
Scale of opportunity
The scale of opportunity open 
to AMEC is substantial. Energy
markets are growing apace, major
investments in UK infrastructure
are anticipated over the next 
few years and we expect further
profits from our longer term
investments activities.
We must now ensure that we
exploit these opportunities to 
the full. On pages four and five 
of this report, we describe the
strategic changes announced 
in 2005 to enable us to do so.
By restructuring the group, 
we will overcome the investment
challenges we have recently 
faced as a large business with
competing priorities.
We hope to complete the
restructuring by the end of 2006.
While Sir Peter Mason, our chief
executive, is due to retire in
September, he is committed 
to assisting in this strategy and 
is working with the board to 
ensure a smooth transition 
to his successor .

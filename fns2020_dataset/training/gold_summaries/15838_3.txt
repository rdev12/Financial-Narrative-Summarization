 T opps Tiles Plc
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2008
4
This has been a challenging year for the T opps business in a difficult trading environment.
However, we are facing these challenges and managing the business in a robust and
prudent manner. We have delivered a credible financial performance in a tough operating
environment. I remain confident that our business will show resilience through this period
and we will be well positioned to capitalise on the strong foundations of the Company as
the economic situation improves.
Financial results
T otal Group revenue has been almost flat year-on-year at £208.1 million (2007: 
£207.9 million) with like-for-like revenue for the period showing a decline of 5.4% on 
last year. Operating profit for the period was £34.6 million (2007: £44.3 million) giving a
profit before tax of £27.7 million (2007: £37.8 million). Basic earnings per share is 9.56p
(2007: 15.09p). During the period our banking facilities were renegotiated with a relaxation
of both covenants associated with the debt and the facility has been extended to 2012.
There was a one-off arrangement fee of £0.5 million which will be amortised over the
remaining period of the facility. 
Dividend
In order to reduce net debt and improve the Company’ s financial flexibility, the Board has
decided not to pay a final dividend for this financial year. We believe this is in the best
interests of the business in the prevailing economic environment and we will continue 
to review the dividend policy on a bi-annual basis. 
Board changes
In March this year we announced the appointment of Alan White, currently CEO of 
N Brown Group plc, to the Board as a Non-Executive Director. His appointment 
was effective from 1 April 2008. In addition we also announced the resignation from 
the Board of Alan McIntosh with effect from 31 March 2008. I would like to thank 
Alan McIntosh for his support and contribution to the Company during his 10 years 
as Non-Executive Director.
We are also announcing that Victor Watson will not seek re-election at the next AGM, 
after 10 very successful years on the Board, Victor has decided to step down. I would 
like to thank Victor for all of his support and contribution to the Company.
Chairman’ s statement
I am confident that we can capitalise on our position 
as market leader as we trade through the current
economic cycle and expect to benefit significantly
when consumer confidence returns.

People 
The Company’ s staff are fundamental to the continuing success of the business. 
Their ability to deliver exceptional customer service is a key factor in differentiating 
T opps from its competitors and will contribute to the future success of the business. 
I would like to extend the Board’ s thanks and gratitude to everyone in the Company 
for their continuing efforts and hard work.
Outlook
We have a very resilient business model and an extremely capable team who are
managing the business prudently. The team have made significant progress during 
the year to ensure that the business is in the best possible condition for the year ahead. 
We have again tightened our cost base for the coming year, reviewed our plans for
growth, focused our attention on cash management, and extended our banking facilities.
The Board is confident that as a result of these actions the business can withstand a
sustained period of weak consumer activity.
I am confident that we can capitalise on our position as market leader as we trade
through the current economic cycle and expect to benefit significantly when consumer
confidence returns.

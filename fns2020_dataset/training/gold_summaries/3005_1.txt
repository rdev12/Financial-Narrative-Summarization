 Chief Executive’s 
Review
With our highest ever profits, the 2012 result broke the 
Group’s previous record set last year, by 30 per cent.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
We have maintained our emphasis on continued growth with capital 
projects and acquisitions across all three divisions. In addition 
we have embarked on further projects that will support the future 
growth of the Group in both the UK and abroad.
In the period, the major investment projects completed,　commenced  
and proposed include:
•  £17.0 million for a new mill at Kirkcaldy
•  £0.4 million for a fuel oil depot at Cockermouth 
•   £4.4 million to replace the Wälischmiller Engineering factory  
scheduled for completion in 2013
•  £1.2 million for expansion of the Agriculture Retail Branch  
at Carlisle
• £2.2 million for a new Agriculture Retail Branch at Annan
•  £0.7 million for a low moisture block plant in Tennessee
•  £0.4 million for the expansion of the AminoMax plant in 
Watertown, New York State
• £0.8 million acquisition of Clive Walton Engineering Limited
•  £0.8 million acquisition of J L Marsden + Petsmart Ltd  
t/a Laycocks
Of the above £27.9 million investment programme, £8.6 million was 
incurred in the period to 1 September 2012 and £19.3 million is 
expected to be incurred in the current financial period.
Staff
This year has not been without challenges, and the Board together 
with senior management recognise that without the continued 
commitment and dedication of our employees our success would 
not have been possible. Carr’s is fortunate to have many employees 
with 20, 30 and even 40 years’ service and this experience together 
with expertise enables Carr’s to thrive.  
I welcome our members of staff joining this year through 
acquisitions. On behalf of the Board I express our thanks and 
appreciation to all employees throughout the Group for their 
continued commitment and dedication.

The trading environment for Agriculture during the period was broadly 
favourable, and although input prices were volatile, growth was primarily 
driven by feed block both in the UK and overseas, and retail and machinery 
sales in the UK.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  
continued
Revenue for the period grew by 7 .7 per cent to £293.8 million (2011: £272.7 million) with  
profit before tax increasing by 26.1 per cent to £8.1 million (2011: £6.4 million). 
Profit before tax, including contribution from associate and joint ventures, increased by  
15.6 per cent to £9.5 million (2011: £8.2 million).
Feed block sales increased by 24 per cent, reflecting market 
share gains in the UK and overseas and remain a prime source of 
growth in this division.
In the USA, the northern states had a very dry, mild winter with 
little snow, a complete contrast to the previous period; whilst the 
southern states experienced heavy rain in the summer followed 
by a prolonged drought. These weather conditions generated the 
demand for low moisture feed blocks and this, combined with 
new business won, resulted in a 37 per cent increase in Smartlic 
and Feed in the Drum sales.
In Tennessee, Gold-Bar Feed Supplements LLC, our 50 per cent 
joint venture, is now in full production of high moisture feed blocks 
and is expected to contribute positively to revenues and profits for 
2012/13. In April 2012, full production of AminoMax, the patented 
rumen bypass protein, started at the 50 per cent joint venture 
plant at Watertown, New York State, after early engineering issues 
were resolved. The high quality of the product has been well 
received by US dairy farmers and the plant is on track to achieve 
profitable sales for the current period. Investment is being made in 
a new by-pass amino acid product, Aminogreen, and once trials 
are concluded it is planned that full production will commence 
alongside AminoMax.
Sales of low and high moisture feed blocks from our UK and 
German operations grew by 12 per cent with continued growth 
of our branded product, Crystalyx, continuing throughout Europe 
and New Zealand. Scotmin, based in Ayr, increased profitability 
through a combination of production efficiencies, increased sales 
of Megalix, and the introduction of the Megastart range marketed 
through the enlarged distribution network.
By contrast dairy feed sales remained static during the period but, 
overall, compound feed sales were down 7 per cent. Reduced 
margins for the period were affected by substantial increases in 
raw material prices, which are now showing some signs of easing.
Retail sales continued to achieve growth on last period’s excellent 
result with a 13 per cent increase. This is the result of an enlarged 
product range being sold through an extended branch network in 
Scotland and the North of England, and the successful integration 
of Safe at Work, acquired in April 2011. Machinery sales are a 
continuing success with a 23 per cent increase following the  
18 per cent growth of last period. This is attributable to new 
franchises increasing the product selection for our increasing 
number of customers.
In July 2012, the £0.8 million acquisition of Laycocks, of which 
£0.7 million was paid on completion, added branches in Malton, 
Settle and Skipton and further increased the veterinary product 
range available to our customers. It is expected to make a 
profitable contribution in 2012/13. A new branch, to be opened at 
the new auction mart at Kendal in December 2012, will take the 
total number of retail branches to 26.
Despite the relatively mild winter, fuel sale volumes were 
maintained, reflecting market share gains and positive 
contributions from new depots at Hexham (opened in August 
2011) and Cockermouth (opened in February 2012).

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
continued
Revenue for the period from our three flour mills, at Kirkcaldy in Fife, Silloth in Cumbria and 
Maldon in Essex, was down by 2.6 per cent to £80.5 million (2011: £82.6 million) with profit 
before tax falling by 64.9 per cent to £0.4 million (2011: £1.3 million) mainly as a result of 
significant industry-imposed selling price reductions and rising wheat prices.
The continuing over-capacity in the flour milling industry had a 
negative impact during the period when volumes were down by 
1 per cent and the wheat price was volatile with a price range 
of £180 per tonne to £250 per tonne experienced in the last 
twelve months. The financial impact on this was partly mitigated 
by the performance of our wheat handling facility at Kirkcaldy, 
which exceeded our expectations, and the continued growth of 
speciality flour sales, in particular the expansion of our products 
sold to the ethnic food market.
The decision to invest £17 million in a new replacement flour 
mill at Kirkcaldy followed a comprehensive review by the Board 
of the options available to improve financial performance, and 
increase the competitiveness of Carr’s in a difficult market.  
The Board took into account: the fact that the current mill is 
near the end of its natural life, the ever increasing importance 
of food safety, Carr’s market position, and potential operational 
efficiencies to be achieved.
Carr’s has a strong customer base in Scotland and the North of 
England. Kirkcaldy is the ideal location for the new mill, given 
the success of the re-opened port, and the logistics of the 
customers the mill serves. 
The new mill will provide significant and immediate efficiencies 
in the areas of operations, energy consumption and raw 
material costs. Even with the less favourable market backdrop 
persisting, the profitability of the Food division is expected to be 
very positively impacted by the commissioning of this new mill. 
Construction of the new mill commenced in July with 
commissioning scheduled for September 2013.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
continued
Profit before tax for the period increased by 183.8 per cent to £4.7 million (2011: £1.7 million)  
on revenue up by 65.2 per cent to £29.7 million (2011: £18.0 million).
The 18 per cent revenue growth seen in the UK reflects 
steady demand, mainly from the nuclear industry. Specialist 
fabricators, Bendalls, completed a contract for the supply of 
pressure vessels to Bechtel in the US for the river protection 
project-water treatment plant in Handford, Washington State. 
Post-delivery issues arose which we are working with Bechtel 
to resolve. It also delivered, in the second half, a major vessel 
for the UK’s largest nuclear project, Evaporator D, at Sellafield 
in Cumbria. Outside the nuclear industry, Bendalls commenced 
work on a £4 million project to supply pressure vessels for a 
floating production, storage and offloading platform being built 
by Hyundai for the BP Quad 204 area, west of the Shetland 
Islands. This is scheduled for delivery in early 2013.
In May 2012, Bendalls acquired Clive Walton Engineering 
Limited for £0.8 million, a precision machining business which is 
expected to make a positive contribution to revenue and profit 
in 2012/13. The acquisition complements the Bendalls business, 
enabling a wider set of skills to be offered to customers. 
In the second half of the 2012 financial period, the performance  
of Carrs MSM benefited from the “life of plant” contract,  
signed in the first half of the period, for the supply of critical  
parts to Sellafield.
Wälischmiller, the remote handling and robotics business 
based in Germany, has been exceptionally busy and operating 
to capacity during the year. In order to fulfil existing contracts 
and support future growth, it has expanded its design and 
production engineering teams. Significant contracts for remote 
handling equipment were completed for customers in France, 
Japan and South Korea as well as delivery of the specialist 
Telbot
®
 robots for a decommissioning plant in Germany. 
Following the successful conclusion of the tests in Norway 
for our designed Telbot
®
 for inspecting gas tanks for Shell, 
discussions are on-going to progress the project on a 
commercial basis.
Wälischmiller is currently working with the nuclear division of 
Mitsui to design specialist remote handling equipment for use at 
the tsunami destroyed Fukushima plant in Japan. 
 
Phase I (new office accommodation and some production 
capacity) of the new 15.5 million factory at Markdorf was 
completed in October 2012, with construction of the main 
production facility now underway and scheduled for completion 
in October 2013.

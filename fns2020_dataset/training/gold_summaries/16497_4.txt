Annual Report and Accounts 2014 
AT A GLANCE
We focus on the treatment 
of cancer and associated 
Biomarkers, specialising
in epigenomic and  
genetic analysis.
The principal activity of the Company continued 
to be that of an oncology therapeutics and 
companion diagnostics development company. 
The Company has undertaken to develop a novel 
and ground-breaking class of therapeutics across 
a number of fields in oncology and has taken its 
lead compound, VAL201, into Phase I/II clinical 
trials. The Company listed on the Alternative 
Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock 
Exchange in October 2006. 
The Company has a pipeline of other therapeutic 
drugs, which are currently progressing towards 
clinical trials. The product focus is in the  
targeted analysis and treatment of cancer,  
but the technologies can be applied to  
other fields as well, such as neurology and 
inflammatory diseases.
It actively manages projects within its portfolio 
as a trading company. The ValiRx business model 
spreads the risks of life science technology 
development by minimising financial exposure 
and running a set of projects to defined 
commercial endpoints. This maximises returns  
to shareholders by adding value at the earlier 
stages where value increases per investment  
unit are the greatest.
The Company operates through the following 
divisional companies: 
ValiPharma
ValiPharma is the therapeutics division,  
with two embedded technologies primarily 
directed at the treatment of cancers.
ValiFinn
ValiFinn is the Biomarkers and Diagnostic 
development division. ValiRx acquired 
through its ValiFinn subsidiary, the 
complimentary TRAC technology later  
in the year to strengthen the portfolio.
ValiSeek
ValiSeek is a joint venture between ValiRx 
and Tangent Ltd to develop VAL401 in lung 
cancer and potentially other indications.
A review of the development and 
performance of the Group can be found  
in the Chief Executive’s Report (p. 12).

Financial and Operating  
Performance Highlights
Business and Operating Performance 
• Business pivoted from a lottery company into a technology  
company, beginning with its signing of the Xinhua News mobile  
app payments deal in April 2016, following the state mandated 
suspension of online sale as of lottery products in March 2015.
• Completed signing of all 12 targeted provinces before year end.
• Raised £51.2 million across three placings in the year, providing 
vital funding to grow our business and adding a number of high 
quality institutions into the share register. 
• Launched B2B mobile payments business in second half of 2016.
• Signed unique mobile content deal with FC Barcelona  
to be launched in first half of 2017.
• Completed a 10% Strategic investment in Xinhuatong, further 
strengthening the relationship between BNN and Xinhuatong, 
and ensuring BNN has access to opportunities to build additional 
revenue streams.
• Began secondary listing application for Nasdaq exchange.
• Rebranded the Group from DJI Holdings plc to BNN Technology 
plc to reflect our current business model and Chinese heritage 
(BNN referencing our main Chinese operating partner, Beijing 
NewNet).
• Formally moved sector classification on LSE AIM from  
‘Gambling’ to ‘Internet’.
• Sold BaiFa in Q4 2016, as business no longer fits with company 
strategic direction.
• Added three new directors to the Board, two of whom are 
Chinese, providing an appropriate balance of our operational 
scope. New directors were: Group CFO Scott Kennedy, China 
CEO Wei Qi and Non-Executive Dong Jinhua.
Key Performance Indicators
Business expected to deliver growth in 2017 in all three  
KPIs that the Board are planning to use to evaluate the 
Group’s financial and operating performance from 2017 
onwards: 
1. REVENUE GROWTH 
We anticipate revenues to grow as we rollout new B2B and 
B2C payments, receive advertising revenues from our unique 
content, and launch our new student and credit services 
propositions
2. GROSS TRANSACTION VOLUMES (“GTV”) 
We expect to grow GTVs, a lead indicator of revenue 
growth, fulfilled by our payments platform, to demonstrate 
the size and scope of our technology platform  
3. MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS (“MAU”) 
We expect to grow the number of average monthly active 
users on our platform.  The more we grow the user base 
(visiting our content and utilising our students platform), the 
greater amount of consumer data we collect and the greater 
the advertising revenues we expect to generate
Group Financial Performance
• Revenues for the Group were £2.1 million in 2016, down from 
£5.5 million in the prior year as a result of the suspension in online 
lottery sales and as the business transformed into a technology 
company.
• Operating loss widened from £9.3 million in 2015 to £16.5 million 
in 2016, as the business invested in people and technology, sought 
a secondary listing in the United States and the company entered 
into partnership with Xinhua in 12 provinces across China.
• 2016 saw the launch of BNN’s Business to Business (‘’B2B’’) mobile 
top up business, significantly increasing Gross Transaction Volumes 
(“GTV”) to £289.6 million.
• In 2016, exceptional costs have been incurred predominantly 
whilst preparing the business for, and in relation to, submitting a 
formal application for a secondary listing on the Nasdaq exchange.
• Cash and cash equivalents £28.0 million at year end 2016 versus 
£4.0 million at the 2015 year end.

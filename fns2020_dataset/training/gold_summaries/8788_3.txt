 Our  year
Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report on another successful
year for your company
8 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
rise in revenue. Gross fixed assets
increased by $147.9m (2006: $43.4m),
with $64.8m expended in development 
of our Ukrainian assets and $67.8m
attributed to acquisition of our Russian
production company, Yuzhgazenergie,
and initiation of redevelopment. Cash
resources at year end totalled $68.1m
(2006: $81.1m). 
The pace of development on our existing
production licences in Ukraine increased
during the period with 13 new wells
drilled and/or completed for production.
The Company remains committed to
broadening its portfolio of both
development and exploration licences in
Ukraine and is actively seeking attractive
assets to acquire. I am pleased to report
that the business environment in Ukraine
continues to improve with little if any
impact on our operations from the
considerable level of political activity over
the period. I remain confident that our
stable working environment will continue
through 2008.
I am delighted that the Company has
successfully identified and acquired its
first gas development asset in Russia
during the period. The Company is
Oil and gas revenues and profits have
continued to grow in 2007 with average
daily production from our core Ukrainian
production licences rising by 13 per cent
to 12,579 boepd (2006: 11,137 boepd).
The Company acquired its first
development asset in Russia in the fourth
quarter of the period and is scheduled to
recommence gas production from the
field this year .
Oil and gas revenues rose by 39 per cent
in the period to $181.9m (2006: $130.5m),
reflecting: production increases, an 
11 per cent rise in average oil
realisations and a 40 per cent rise in
domestic Ukrainian gas prices over the
period. Profit before tax of $113.3m
(2006: $109.2m) represents a modest
increase of 4 per cent. However, this
figure for 2007 includes $17.7m of
impaired and written off exploration
costs, whilst the 2006 comparative figure
includes the net $13.5m beneficial effect
relating to impairment (2006: $15.2m
reversal and $1.7m charge). Excluding
the effect of the 2007 net impairment
charge and the 2006 reversal, the
underlying profit before tax for the period
is $131.0m (2006: $95.7m) an increase of
37 per cent and is consistent with the

Board is recommending a final dividend
of 2.4 pence which will be paid on 30 May
to shareholders who are on the
Company’s Register of Members at the
close of business on 11 April. This
payment will bring the total dividend for
2007 to 4.4 pence per share (2006: 2.2
pence per share), a 100 per cent increase
over 2006.
Outlook
The Company’s priorities for 2008 are the
accelerated development of its production
licences in Ukraine, and the initiation of
gas production from its new production
licence in Russia. The broadening of our
exploration portfolio is focused on
replacement of produced reserves. 
Notwithstanding the ongoing reserve
review of our Ukrainian production
licences, I anticipate further material
increase of reserves to result from
continuing acquisitions, utilising the
Company’s healthy balance sheet and
strong cash flow. I trust that I will be able
to announce progress on these fronts in
the coming year . 
The Company’s performance owes much
to the dedication of its professional staff
whose commitment to the Company’s
goals drive the implementation of our
corporate strategy. The vast majority 
of our workforce is located overseas,
mainly in Ukraine but also now in Russia. 
I would like to thank all members of 
staff for their contribution to the success
of the Company. Finally, I extend my
appreciation to the shareholders of the
Company for their continued interest 
and support.
HSEC
The Company is expanding its
programmes on Health, Safety,
Environmental Protection and
Community Liaison (HSEC) in all Group
companies, and is committed to achieving
OHSAS 18001 accreditation for the HSEC
management system, and ISO 14001
accreditation for the Environmental
Management System. The Company has
also introduced Benchmarking Initiatives
to provide assurance and to ensure
continuous improvement in its
operations. Jack Lee was appointed in
the first quarter of the reporting period as
Group HSEC Manager, reporting to the
Chief Executive, and I am conscious of the
benefit the Company is deriving from his
25 years of experience in the field. 
During the period, we have also set in
place a Carbon Management Plan which
has been lodged and approved by the
Carbon Trust.
Board changes
The Company announced the
appointment of Nigel Moore as Non-
executive Director, and Peter Dixon and
Martin Miller as Executive Directors in
the middle of the period. I am delighted
that we have been able to strengthen our
Board at a time of rapid growth in our
business and we intend to make further
Non-executive appointments in the
current period.
Dividend
The Company paid an interim dividend 
of 2.0 pence per share on 5 November
2007. I am pleased to report that the
currently in the process of upgrading 
the field facilities and mobilising a
drilling rig into Russia in order to
commence well workover operations.
First gas from the Koshekhablskoye Field
is scheduled for mid-2008. The Company
is seeking further acquisitions of gas
assets in southern Russia, subject to 
a continuation of the current domestic
investment climate.
The Company’s exploration activities in
the period comprised seismic acquisition
in Ukraine and Turkey, and drilling a
deep well on its Golitza licence in
Bulgaria (JKX: 50 per cent). Although 
our first Bulgarian well was dry, we are
proceeding with our partner to identify
shallower prospects on our extensive
exploration acreage in 2008.
The Company is broadening its
exploration portfolio in central and
eastern Europe, and Turkey. The
Company announced in December that 
it had: farmed into the two Hernád
exploration licences in Hungary (JKX: 
50 per cent) and, immediately following
the end of the reporting period, the farm-
in to the two South East Bismil licences
in south east Turkey (JKX: 20 per cent). 
I anticipate further exploration farm-ins
by the Company in central and eastern
Europe during 2008.
Since the end of the reporting period, the
Company has disposed of its non-core
Italian exploration portfolio (including the
Aglavizza gas discovery) to Mediterranean
Oil & Gas plc, and is continuing to seek
an exit from its remaining North America
exploration asset.

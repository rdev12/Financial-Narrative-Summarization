 Introduction 
In 2005, Domino’s Pizza celebrated the 20th anniversary of our 
first UK store opening and another year of excellent progress. 
We believe that this success results from a total focus on the
development of the Domino’s brand in the UK and Republic of
Ireland. This focus has extended our market leadership with the
opening of 50 new stores and strong like-for-like sales growth. 
This has resulted in another year of robust system sales growth,
increased profits and excellent cash generation. 
We are confident that your Company’s growth is sustainable into
the long-term given the robust growth prospects of the market in
which we operate. The combined effect of a growing number of
households in the UK and Republic of Ireland, increased acceptance
of home delivery and favourable demographic changes provides the
opportunity for 800-1,000 Domino’s Pizza stores in these territories.
It has taken us 20 years to open the first 400 stores, we hope to
reach our next target in a further ten years.
System sales 
In 2005, system sales, which are the sales of all stores in the
Domino’s system in the UK and Republic of Ireland, rose by 
15.1% to £200.7m in 2005 (2004: 22.5%). Like-for-like sales in 
the 317 stores open for more than twelve months in both periods
grew by 7.1% (2004: 6.6%). 
In addition to the continued store roll-out, several other factors
underpinned system sales growth in 2005. We launched a number
of new pizzas in the year, which were very well-received and gave us
the opportunity to communicate something new to our customers.
The combination of these new products, national TV and direct
marketing proved a strong driver of system sales.
In the area of e-commerce, our first-mover advantage continues 
to pay dividends with sales increasing by 69.5% over the last 
year. E-commerce sales represented 10.4% of all delivered pizza 
sales by Domino’s Pizza in the UK. Orders made via our website
(www.dominos.co.uk) account for 94% of e-commerce sales. 
The remaining 6% of orders are generated by our presence on 
two national interactive TV platforms.
Expansion 
In 2005 we opened 50 new stores (2004: 40 stores) to take the
year-end store count to 407 stores (2004: 357). No stores were
closed during the year (2004: one).
Mindful of the speed at which we are growing, and the fact that 
we must focus on the quality as well as the volume of new stores,
we are increasingly selective about the franchisees whom we allow
to expand. We must also build a system that can be effectively and
cost-efficiently managed as we grow to 1,000 stores. Finally, we must
provide the opportunity for our franchisee partners to build substantial
and successful businesses. To this end we will focus more on
assisting our existing franchisees to open as many of the new
stores as possible, providing they meet our very rigorous standards.
In 2005, 70% of new stores were opened by existing franchisees.
New franchisees will be increasingly encouraged to acquire existing
stores from franchisees wishing to leave the system.
Trading results
Group turnover, which includes the sales generated by the Group
from royalties, fees on new store openings, food sales, finance lease
and rental income, as well as the turnover of corporately owned
and operated stores, grew by 10.0% to £81.7m (2004: £74.2m).
This rate of growth is slower than the system sales rate due to 
6 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT the disposal of the corporate stores during the year. Excluding the
impact of lost revenue from these disposed stores, Group turnover
would have increased by 19.3%.
Group operating profit, including our share of operating profit in joint
ventures, but before the accelerated LTIP and exceptional items,
was up 20.4% to £11.0m from £9.1m. As a result of the early
vesting of the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) outlined below,
we have taken an accelerated £0.6m charge that would otherwise
have been made in 2006 and 2007. This treatment follows the
requirements of FRS20 which we have now adopted. After taking
into account this charge, Group operating profits were up 13.6% 
to £10.4m.
As our Chairman stated we have significantly strengthened the
resources we commit to our operations function. The key to our
eventual growth to 1,000 stores will lie in our focus on the
execution of the Domino’s system at store level. This additional
investment in our operations team cost £0.5m in 2005. 
During 2005, we also introduced a commissary rebate scheme
which was designed to help our franchisees overcome a number of
external cost pressures they were facing. This performance-related
rebate enabled our franchisees to receive a reduction in the cost of
food purchased from our commissaries, provided they achieve
certain percentage sales increases. Franchisees benefited from a
total rebate of £0.5m which was an increase of £0.4m over a more
limited scheme that operated in 2004. 
Profit on ordinary activities before interest and taxation grew 
by 23.8% to £11.3m (2004: £9.1m). This includes the profit of
£0.9m on the sale of corporate stores as well as the accelerated
LTIP charges as referred to above. 
Net interest paid fell to £0.1m (2004: £0.3m) primarily due 
to stronger cash generation from operations during the year. 
Net interest costs are covered 122 times by operating profits 
(2004: 34 times). 
The tax charge for the year was 26.2% (2004: 23.3%) and is lower
than the statutory tax rate of 30% as a result of the relief available on
the profit from the sale of the corporate stores under the substantial
shareholding exemption and the exercise of employee share options.
The increase in the tax rate from 2004 is due to substantially higher
relief in the earlier year on the number of employee share options
exercised.
Profit after tax and minority interests was up 22.6% to £8.3m
(2004: £6.7m).
Earnings per share and dividend 
Basic earnings per share were up 22.8% to 16.25 pence from
13.23 pence. Diluted earnings per share increased by 22.1% 
to 15.47 pence from 12.67 pence.
As a result of the ability of the business to generate strong cash
flows, the Board is pleased to recommend a further significant
increase in the dividend payment which, if approved by shareholders,
will give a final dividend of 4.15 pence per share (2004: 3.05 pence
per share). This would give a total dividend for the year of 7.25 pence
per share, a 38.1% increase over the 5.25 pence per share declared
for 2004. The proposed dividend is 2.2 times covered by profits after
tax (2004: 2.5 times). 
Subject to shareholders’ approval the final dividend will be payable
on 28 April 2006 to shareholders on the register on 7 April 2006.

FRESH INGREDIENTS IN 
EVERY STORE
Every day, teams from our 
three commissaries travel 6,000
miles to supply fresh ingredients
to Domino’s Pizza stores. By 
centrally controlling the sourcing
and distribution of ingredients,
customers can be assured of 
the highest standards and team
members can concentrate on 
getting a tasty pizza delivered 
to customers on time, every time.
great 
product Annual Report & Accounts 2005
Delivering great tasting, piping hot pizza time after time
relies on a team of highly skilled people. From our purchasing
team who scour the earth sourcing for great tasting, high
quality ingredients right the way through to our in-store
teams who are trained in the art of hand crafting every
order to the customers’ individual requirements, and 
delivering a freshly made piping hot pizza directly to the
customer’s door.
33.5m
We made 33.5m dough balls during 2005
FRESH DOUGH
Our stores now offer a range of
four pizza crusts, The Chicago Thin
Crust, the Dominator, the Double
Decadence and the perennial
favourite, our classic Fresh Dough
which remains the Number One
choice. Why? Our customers tell us
that it’s the unbeatable combination
of that freshly baked taste and
lightness of texture which makes 
it so irresistible. There is a lot of
effort in using fresh dough but
we’ve seen the results for over 20
years in the UK and it’s worth it.
FINEST INGREDIENTS
We are fanatical about ingredients. 
Take our tomatoes, for instance. 
During just one fortnight of every
year, enough tomatoes are harvested
to make an entire year’s supply of
our secret recipe sauce. Specific
weeks are chosen for the harvest so
that our tomatoes are at their most
ripe. We then go into round-the-
clock production to get fresh sauce
made within hours of the tomatoes
coming off the vine.
9 Cash flow and balance sheet 
Net cash inflow from operating activities reached £12.7m, up from
£9.9m in 2004. This increase was attributable mainly to the higher
operating profit, before the accelerated LTIP charge, which was
£1.8m up on 2004.
Cash flows were also stronger as cash interest was £0.2m lower,
taxation paid was £0.5m lower, and capital expenditure £1.5m
lower. Proceeds of £3.7m from the sale of subsidiary undertakings
and £0.5m from the sales of fixed assets of corporate stores were
partially offset by an increase in dividend payments of £0.9m.
Overall, net cash inflow before financing was £7.2m higher than
last year, up from £1.8m to £9.0m. This strong cash generation has
allowed us to return a further £8.2m to shareholders through share
buybacks during the year. We have now returned £15.2m of cash to
shareholders over the past two years via share buybacks of £9.8m
and dividends of £5.4m.
In the year, options over 0.7m shares were exercised generating an
inflow of £0.5m (2004: £1.1m). The Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”)
borrowed an additional £1.1m taking its total borrowings to £7.5m
(2004: £6.4m). This additional loan was used to purchase further
shares in the Company, over which an LTIP award was granted.
During the year DP Capital continued to provide leasing support to
franchisees for the fit-out of new stores and the refit of existing stores,
with new advances of £1.2m (2004: £0.9m). After repayments, the
balance outstanding at the year end on these leases was £2.9m
(2004: £2.9m). These facilities are financed by a limited recourse
loan facility and the amount drawn down at the end of the year
stood at £2.5m (2004: £2.6m).
At the year end, the Group had cash at hand of £5.9m (2004: £4.8m)
and consolidated debt of £10.0m (2004: £9.0m) all of which related
to the EBT and DP Capital loans. Net borrowings at the year end
therefore stood at £4.1m (2004: £4.2m) representing 34.5% 
(2004: 28.4%) of shareholders’ funds.
Although adoption of IFRS will only be mandatory for AIM listed
companies from 2007, a preliminary assessment has highlighted
that the adoption of IFRS is not expected to have any significant 
impact on the Group’s reported results.
Corporate stores
During 2005, we disposed of 14 corporate stores, acquired one 
and opened two new stores, leaving just five. It is our intention to
dispose of these remaining stores as the opportunities arise. Since
the year-end, one of these stores has been sold and terms have
been agreed on three others. These disposals effectively complete
our exit from own-store operation. This has been achieved at a
significant capital profit and the stores are now being operated
successfully by franchisees.
During the year, two stores were transferred into subsidiary
companies in which our partners have a 20% equity stake. We
hope that the combination of our partners’ entrepreneurial skill 
in operating the stores, combined with our strategic direction 
and capital, will provide an attractive return for our shareholders.
In total, we now have an equity interest in five ventures which 
are not 100% owned and operate in a total of 26 stores. Our 
total equity investment in these enterprises is £565,000 
(2004: £205,000) and they contributed £166,000 to operating 
profits in 2005 (2004: £105,000). 
The market
According to Mintel’s 2004 Home Delivery Report, the home-delivered
food market was estimated to be worth around £1.36bn in 2005
with pizza takeaway/delivery being the largest component at 48%.
10 Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT (continued) Annual Report & Accounts 2005 11
Current purchasing habits indicate that there is an enormous growth
opportunity in the pizza delivery sector. Mintel also states that just
23% of adults have ever ordered a delivered pizza, and only 6% of
the population had ordered from Domino’s. When compared to the
more mature US market, where 75% of adults have ordered a
delivered pizza, and 50% of those have had a pizza delivered from
Domino’s, these figures suggest that the scope for growth lies not
only in the expansion of the system into virgin territory but also in
attracting more new customers to our existing stores.
Furthermore, a report by The Future Foundation forecasts growth
of 91% in the pizza segment of the home delivery market by 2015.
This report also underlines how your Company is well-placed to
maximise future opportunities in the market arising from changing
eating habits, the increasing spend on in-home leisure as well as
the continuance of the cash-rich, time-poor society.
People
At Domino’s Pizza, we believe that encouraging longevity of service
is a key part of our success. To this end, we seek to foster long-term
loyalty from our people and offer them market-leading rewards.
During the year we introduced a Save As You Earn scheme giving
team members an option to acquire shares in your Company. This
offer was extremely well-subscribed. We have also reinforced
previous schemes with the granting of a further round of share
options to all team members, excluding the executive directors,
further demonstrating the commitment and strong partnership
between our people and the Company.
Long Term Incentive Plan and Employee Benefit Trust
As a result of the rapid growth in profitability and earnings per share
over the last three years, the performance targets included in the
2003 LTIP award have been achieved. The early vesting of these
awards necessitates the acceleration of the 2006 and 2007 charge
as referred to above. 
Based on the closing share price on 24 February 2006 of 416.5 pence,
the beneficiaries of the LTIP are now entitled to the growth in value
of the LTIP which will be satisfied by the transfer of 1,909,334 shares
to them. During the year, the EBT purchased a further 375,000
shares, over which an LTIP interest was granted. Following these
movements, the EBT owns 2,065,587 shares, of which 975,000 are
subject to an outstanding LTIP interest.
Current trading and outlook 
Trading in the first six weeks of 2006 has got off to an excellent
start with like-for-like sales up 10.3% (2005: 6.6%). E-commerce
has continued to show robust growth with an increase of 59.5% in
the same period (2005: 49.2%). E-commerce in the first six weeks
accounted for 11.8% of all UK delivered pizza sales. Our store
opening programme is also progressing in line with expectations
and we are on track to achieve our target of 50 new store openings
this year. 
Cash flow remains strong and it is the Directors’ intention to return
cash not needed to expand our business to shareholders by further
share buybacks and a progressive dividend policy. The Company is
once again well-positioned for another year of strong growth.
Conclusion 
On behalf of the team in the UK and Ireland, I should like to thank
our customers for their loyalty and continued support of Domino’s
Pizza. Finally, to all of our franchisees and team members, I thank
you sincerely for your tireless dedication at every level of the
business and for contributing to another successful year.

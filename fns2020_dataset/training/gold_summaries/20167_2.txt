Performance highlights
A summary of our performance for the year to 3 1 March 201 4
The financial data presented in the Overview and Strategic report relates to the 
Investment basis financial statements. The Investment basis is described on 
page  40 and the differences from, and the reconciliation to, the IFRS Audited 
financial statements are detailed on pages 54 to 57 .
Strong total shareholder return
Our share price increased from 316p on 28 March 2013 to 398p  
on 31 March 2014. After adjusting for dividends paid in the year,  
this represents a total shareholder return in the year of 30%.
We committed to pay a regular base dividend of 8.1p per share in 
respect of each financial year. A good level of realisations in the year 
has funded an additional dividend of 1 1.9p per share, so that the total 
proposed dividend for the year to 31 March 2014 is 20p per share.  
We paid one-third of this, 6.7p per share, in January 2014 as an interim 
dividend and, subject to shareholder approval, will pay the remaining 
balance of 13.3p per share as a final dividend in July 2014.

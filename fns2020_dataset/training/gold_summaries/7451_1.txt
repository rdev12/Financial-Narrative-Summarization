 4 HRG Annual Report 2010
Our business model has
delivered for us at the
same time as helping
our clients reduce their
travel spend.
Overview
The financial year to 31 March 2010 (FY10)
was as challenging as many of us have
seen. So, it is with great pride that I am
able to report a set of results that show
how well the HRG team has performed.
Our business model has delivered for us
at the same time as helping our clients
reduce their travel spend. Despite a 12%
reduction in client travel spend and a 7%
reduction in our own revenues, we have
managed our cost base to improve
margins and deliver results that were in
line with expectations. As difficult as some
of these changes were, I am convinced
that we now have a fitter company that is
better able to serve its clients and deliver
lasting value to its staff and shareholders.
The first half of our financial year was in
many ways a continuation of what we
experienced during the last six months of
the previous year as our clients wrestled
with the depth of the recession. They were
increasingly willing to change their travel
policies, and often this created further
opportunities for HRG.
In the second half of the year, we saw the
first signs that market conditions could be
easing, as clients in Asia Pacific began to
relax travel policies. Assuming that the
global economy continues to recover, we
expect a gradual return towards pre-
recession levels of travel activity to follow
in Europe and North America.
Two particular trends emerged during the
year. Firstly, we saw a greater adoption of
technology solutions and, in particular,
lower cost, online self-booking tools,
especially in North America. Secondly, even
as clients sought ways to reduce their
overall travel expenditure they continued
to demand solutions that offered good
value. We have continued to focus on
delivering first-class bespoke solutions
which combine products, services and
geographies to achieve greater overall
efficiencies and cost savings.
The question on most people’s minds in
this industry is not whether corporate
travel spending will recover but how
quickly it will do so. By its very nature,
forward visibility of corporate travel
bookings is relatively limited. As a result of
the decisive actions that we have taken
during the past year or so, coupled with
our stable client base and new client
contracts, I am convinced that HRG is
very well positioned to grow. In doing
so, we are determined to deliver value to
our clients and positive returns to our
shareholders.
Financial results
Revenue of £326.8m was down 7.0% as
reported, or down 11.6% at constant
exchange rates. Underlying operating
profit, which is before the amortisation of
acquired intangibles and exceptional
items, was up by 1.7% to £35.2m,
representing a margin improvement of
1.0% to 10.8%. These figures include a
contribution of £1.4m from favourable
movements in exchange rates. Aided by
significantly lower net interest costs,
underlying profit before tax was up by
15.0% to £28.4m. Underlying EPS increased
by 34.0% from 4.7p to 6.3p.
After including the amortisation of
acquired intangibles and exceptional
items, reported operating profit was up by
10.7% to £28.0m; profit before tax was up
by 37.7% to £21.2m; EPS increased by
83.3% from 2.4p to 4.4p.
The year-end net debt reduced by £7.8m
to £77.5m and represented a healthy 1.7x
underlying EBITDA (FY09: 2.0x), with
interest cover of 13.9x (FY09: 5.0x).
Our existing bank facilities are committed
until September 2011. Preparations to
renew these facilities have begun, but
based on current market conditions,
we expect any renewal to be more
expensive than today.

The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 0.8p per share to leave the
full-year dividend unchanged at 1.2p per
share. Our dividend is covered 5.3x
(FY09: 3.9x) by underlying EPS. The final
dividend will be paid on 2 August 2010 to
shareholders on the register at the close
of business on 2 July 2010.
Outlook
In the coming months, we anticipate an
increase in travel activity from our existing
client base as businesses generally begin
to benefit from the economic recovery.
This should be supplemented as new
clients come on stream during the course
of the year. Despite the short-term
closures of European airspace due to
volcanic ash, client revenues for April and
May are expected to be similar to 2009.
For the full year, we expect to deliver
further progress.

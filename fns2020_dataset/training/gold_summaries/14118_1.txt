cH ieF executive’s REVIEW
t Om Hau GHey, CHIEF ExECUTIVE OFFICER
In 2010 Severfield–
Rowen traded through 
some of the most difficult 
conditions seen by the 
UK industry in the 
last few decades.
In 2010 Severfield–Rowen traded through 
some of the most difficult conditions seen by 
the UK industry in the last few decades.
It faces the challenges of 2011 in a 
determined but pragmatic manner and is 
now more optimistic of a partial recovery in 
demand during 2012.
Business
The companies within the Group have 
displayed their individual strengths which 
have collectively enabled the Group to 
trade profitably and competitively in the 
last 12 months. Features such as close 
commercial interaction, design capability, 
cost base, volume outputs, experience and 
co-ordinated steel erection, together with 
product range have been key in growing 
market share in such difficult circumstances.
Internationally, the Company is successfully 
establishing long-term positions in India and 
the Middle East. 
Or Der BOOk
The order book for the UK based operations 
(as at 22 March 2011) stood at a healthy 
£226m, as it continues to secure business 
from all of the sectors making up UK 
demand.
The pipeline of enquiries is more 
encouraging than six months ago, however 
a large proportion of the work will be for 
commencement in 2012.
cO sts
The Company specifically targeted cost 
reductions across all businesses at the end of 
2009. These improvements have provided 
for our resultant competitiveness throughout 
2010. Further cost reduction initiatives 
remain under review and development, 
including a procurement related initiative.
prices an D mar Gins
Market prices bottomed in the first half of 
2010 and, while remaining relatively low, 
have moved in line with the steel material 
developments of the international market.
Margins have remained subdued with little 
improvement in the supply/demand balance 
of the UK market.
inD ia
In November 2010, the joint venture 
(JSSL) manufacturing facilities at Bellary 
were officially opened and attended by 
approximately 200 guests from the Indian 
construction industry.
The business is now designing, drawing, 
fabricating and erecting quality structural 
steelwork for the growing Indian market.
Four months after the opening, the order 
book (as at 22 March 2011) stands at 
£33m, demonstrating the value of the new 
service on offer to clients in India.
These developments underpin the 
Company’s confidence that it can realise its 
financial and growth ambitions in India.

risk mana Gement
The Company has a proactive and formal 
approach to Risk Management. During 
the year, another comprehensive review 
of its risk profile and risk management 
process was undertaken in conjunction 
with Willis. The emphasis changed from 
previous reviews to reflect the more 
challenging environment within which it is 
now operating and the greater international 
dimension to its business. A more complete 
review of the principal risks which the 
business faces is set out on pages 34 to 35.
s ummary 
The Company remains pleased with 
its relative performance in the very 
challenging UK market place. The UK based 
operations have shown their strengths 
and competitiveness to produce an overall 
successful performance in the last 12 
months. We commence this year with a 
good order book, but recognise that UK 
demand in 2011 remains weak.
In India, we now have a very strong order 
book and will continue our drive for growth 
in those markets.
We see a partial improvement in UK 
demand and mix emerging in 2012, 
which, while not a comprehensive recovery, 
will present the Company with good 
opportunities. 19 OUR BUSINESS 19

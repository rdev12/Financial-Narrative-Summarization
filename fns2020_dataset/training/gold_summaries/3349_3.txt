 04 Charter plc Annual Report 2007
Chairman’s statement
Adjusted earnings per share, our principal measure of the
Company’s performance, increased by 24.4 per cent to 
84.7 pence per share (2006: 68.1 pence).
The results achieved in 2007 continue to show that both of
Charter’s businesses, ESAB and Howden, are successfully
building upon the investments previously made in restructuring
the businesses and subsequently on enlarging the product
range and on new and improved capacity, much of which 
is now in low cost areas. This has taken place against 
a background of generally strong markets.
As shown opposite, in 2007 Charter generated sales 
of £1,451.1 million (2006: £1,257.9 million), an increase 
of 15.4 per cent, and operating profit of £173.3 million (2006:
£144.6 million), an increase of 19.8 per cent. Adjusted profit
before tax was £181.1 million (2006: £145.8 million), an
increase of 24.2 per cent, and profit attributable to equity
shareholders was £137.8 million (2006: £123.4 million), 
an increase of 11.7 per cent. 
As a reflection of the Company’s strong results and much
improved financial position, the Board is recommending a final
dividend of 12 pence per share.
Balance sheet and cash flow
During the year, equity shareholders’ funds increased by
£180.3 million to £426.4 million, reflecting the profit attributable
to equity shareholders generated during the year of 
£137.8 million, the net reduction in retirement benefit
obligations of £11.9 million, the exchange translation gain 
of £25.1 million plus other items of £5.5 million.
During the year, cash generated from operations was 
£149.1 million (2006: £106.8 million), an increase of 39.6 
per cent. Capital expenditure was £47.7 million (2006: 
£24.5 million), an increase of 94.7 per cent. The depreciation
charge for the year was £14.7 million (2006: £13.5 million).
Various acquisitions, including an increased shareholding 
in ESAB India, cost £26.2 million. Net cash, which stood at
£43.1 million at the end of 2006, increased to £88.2 million 
at 31 December 2007.
I am pleased to present another
successful year for Charter in my 
first report to you as Chairman.

Board
On 11 September 2007, I was appointed to the Board as a
Non-Executive Director and became Non-Executive Chairman
on 1 November 2007.
David Gawler stood down as Chairman and retired from the
Board on 31 October 2007. During his time as Chairman,
David led Charter through an extensive reorganisation of its
businesses, which saw the disposal of a number of non-core
businesses and other assets, a significant recovery in operating
margins and a reduction in debt. The remainder of the Board
joins me in thanking David for his contribution and wishes him
well in his retirement.

Dividend
The Board has decided to recommend a final dividend in
respect of 2007 of 12 pence per share. Subject to approval 
by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 May
2008, the dividend will be paid on 23 May 2008, to holders 
of ordinary shares registered on 2 May 2008.
The Board envisages a progressive dividend policy under
which payments to Shareholders will reflect future growth 
in earnings per share and anticipates declaring an interim
dividend at the time of the interim results, subject to the
general economic and financial conditions in the principal
markets in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate.

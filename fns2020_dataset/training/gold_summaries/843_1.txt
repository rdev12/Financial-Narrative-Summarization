 30 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Chief executive’ s review
Our continuing businesses present
substantial but different opportunities
Sir Peter Mason KBE
Chief executive 
2005 was a good year across 
most of our main businesses, 
with profits in Oil and Gas up 
by 25 per cent and Engineering and
Technical Services by 18 per cent.
However, whilst our PPP activities
performed well, the overall
outcome for the year was heavily
influenced by poor performance 
in UK Construction. Full details 
of our results for 2005 are given 
in the business and financial 
review that follows this section. AMEC plc annual report 2005 31
Future growth 
Looking ahead, confirmation of 
our strategy of the proposed sale 
of AMEC SPIE, followed by the
separation of remaining activities,
will allow us to capitalise on growth
opportunities in our core energy
and process markets and to
continue to build our portfolio 
of equity investments.
Engineering and T echnical
Services (“ETS”) 
All of our major ETS markets, with
the exception of Iraq, are either in
recovery, already growing, or have
real prospects for growth.
In Continental Europe, AMEC SPIE
continues to grow with increasing
levels of economic activity, and
further improvement in margin 
is expected.
Iraq is now declining, as US funding
tails off. While we will need to
replace this income, our recognition
as a leading contractor in Iraq has
helped build our reputation as a
natural choice to manage complex
“disaster recovery” projects.
Recently, for instance, we were
asked to lead the recovery at
Buncefield, the oil depot in the 
UK which was destroyed by a
major explosion.
Meanwhile, we see real recovery 
in US industrial markets and our
environmental business is benefiting
from the trend to greater regulation,
and strength in energy markets.
In the UK, our industrial business
is developing a range of power and
gas storage and distribution assets.
This is a rapidly expanding market
as ageing infrastructure and
concerns over security of supply
drive demand. Spending in this
market is set to grow substantially
over the next five to ten years.
Meanwhile, we are beginning 
to benefit from the global
reassessment of nuclear power
and are well placed to win a good
share of the UK decommissioning 
market and, beyond that, other
international contracts.
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas markets remain strong
and our particular skill set and
experience means we are well
positioned to benefit from market
drivers. In the mature North Sea
market, we are the market leader
in upgrading and extending existing
assets (brownfield work) and we
are the leading engineering player
in the fast-growing oil sands
investments in Canada – winning
new work with our major
customers. Beyond that, we have 
a strong position in fast emerging
regions such as Azerbaijan and
Sakhalin in Russia, where our
experience of partnering with 
local suppliers makes us a 
natural choice.  32 AMEC plc annual report 2005

Project Solutions 
In our Construction Services
business, the main growth
opportunity is recovery – following
our exit from unattractive markets
and our substantial restructuring
of the business. 
In the Investments segment, 
we have assembled a high quality
portfolio of assets, having invested
selectively for a number of years.
And the value of these investments
is increasing as discount rates
have been improving. We are
continuing to invest in quality
opportunities and both our PPP
and Property Developments
businesses are targeting several
new schemes each year .
Investment opportunities
As we look to the future, and to 
the restructuring of our continuing
businesses following the
prospective sale of AMEC SPIE, 
the nature of the opportunity 
is different in each of the 
Energy and Process and UK
Infrastructure businesses.
In our Energy and Process
businesses, notably oil and gas,
mining, and downstream gas and
power, we are in markets that are
enjoying quite dramatic growth,
and in some cases this will be
sustained for some years. AMEC 
is already a strong player in these
markets, but we need more
resources to meet the demand. 
By making selective, quality
acquisitions, we can gain scale,
and achieve growth more quickly,
from 2007 and beyond. 
In the UK Infrastructure business,
we see rather different engines 
for growth. Recovery in the
Construction Services business
will be one, and continuing to
release value from the investments
portfolio will be another . Beyond
that, we must maintain the pipeline
of investments. However, there 
is also room here for selective
acquisition, for instance in the
facilities management and building
services areas where we have 
a good base but can scale up.
Across our markets, therefore,
there is considerable opportunity 
to accelerate growth, and the
prospective sale of AMEC SPIE will
give us the balance sheet strength
to pursue selected opportunities, 
in a planned way, with real focus
on building our position in our
target markets. AMEC plc annual report 2005 33
Sustainability
During 2005, we took steps to place
more emphasis on sustainability 
as a central aspect of the way we
manage the business. We made
further progress in our overall
performance in health and safety,
environment, community and
employment. However, it saddens
me personally and remains
unacceptable that we suffered eight
fatalities at work and I remain
committed to promoting increased
vigilance in the workplace to
ensure a safer year in 2006. 
An overview of 2005 appears 
on pages 24 to 27 of this report 
and our sustainability report is
available on-line at our website

Outlook
We continue to see generally
strong market conditions in our
European Multitechnical and
Environmental businesses and
recovery in North American
industrial markets is expected 
to continue. Our activities which
contributed to the rebuilding 
of infrastructure in Iraq will
continue throughout 2006, but 
at a much reduced level. This will
lead to a smaller contribution to
profits than in 2005.
Oil and gas markets are 
expected to remain robust and 
our order book is strong. Overall
performance for the Oil and Gas
segment in 2006 is expected to 
be offset by a lower contribution
from mining activity in North
America following an outstanding
year in 2005.
With construction activities now
stabilised and another strong
performance expected from the
PPP business, we expect to see
Project Solutions make satisfactory
progress during 2006. 
Taking these factors into account,
the board maintains its earlier
expectations for overall progress*
in 2006.

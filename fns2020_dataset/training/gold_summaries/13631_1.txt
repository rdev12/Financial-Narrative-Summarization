19 ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Strategic Report
Roger	joined	the	Board	in	1988	as	one	of	two	non-executive	directors.	In	the	subsequent	27	years	
Roger	has	seen	Rotork	grow	and	establish	itself	as	a	global	leader	in	flow	control	equipment.
In	1988	Rotork’s	turnover	was	£34.1m	and	had	
an	operating	profit	of	£4.5m.	The	business	was	
operating in 12 countries and had 584 
employees. During the subsequent 10 years in 
Roger’s term as a non-executive director , the 
Group	grew	substantially,	initially	under	the	
leadership of T om Eassie as CEO and then under 
Bill Whiteley.
In	1998	Roger	was	asked	to	become	Chairman.	
At	this	time	the	Board	composition	was	similar	
to	1988,	with	two	non-executive	directors	and	
three executive directors. In 1997 revenue had 
increased	to	£92.8m	and	the	operating	profit	
was	£20.4m	with	812	staff	in	19	countries.
As Chairman, Roger has been a central part of 
the team that has continued to drive Rotork 
forward,	making	it	the	Company	it	is	today.	
Roger has set high standards and is passionate 
about the culture, style, and integrity of the 
business and its people. He has promoted 
diversity and Board performance, and the Board 
has	been	strengthened	during	his	tenure.	It	now	
comprises	five	independent	non-executive	
directors, four executive directors and the 
Chairman. Roger leaves the Group in a strong 
position,	both	financially	and	operationally.	In	
2014 the Group had direct operations in 37 
countries	with	3,469	staff,	revenue	of	£594.7m	
and	operating	profit	of	£142.2m.
Roger	will	retire	from	the	Company	at	the	
conclusion of the AGM on 24 April. In the history 
of Rotork there have only ever been four CEOs 
and	Roger	has	worked	with	three	of	them.	On	
behalf of them, the Board and Rotork employees 
past	and	present,	I	would	like	to	wish	him	the	best	
for	the	future	and	on	a	personal	note,	I	would	like	
to thank Roger for the guidance and support he 
has given me over the years.

amounted	to	approximately	 
£3 million in the last four years to 
ensure	each	store	remains	well	
presented,	attractive	and	modern	
with	a	fashionable	look	and	feel.
  IT systems
   The Group has invested in IT 
systems	which	seek	to	support	
ScS’s	growth	by	offering	business

distribution	centres	and	head	office	
experience	minimal	disruption.

provision of high levels of 
service	throughout	the	customer	
experience	from	the	point	of	sale	
through to delivery and providing

to operate to high standards,

CHAIRMAN’S 
REVIEW
2 01 3 REVIEW
I am delighted to report that this is our 
fifth consecutive year of profit growth and 
that Lookers has achieved an *adjusted 
profit before tax of £48.1 million (2012: 
£38.0 million). This result has been achieved 
against the background of a welcome and 
strong recovery in the UK new car market 
which has returned to a more normal level 
of activity, in conjunction with an improving 
UK economy.
Total registrations for the UK new car market 
in the year were 2.26 million, an increase of 
10.8%. Our motor division, again, delivered an 
excellent performance producing strong growth 
in volumes of both new and used cars, ahead of 
the market.
I am very pleased to report that our independent 
parts distribution business has made good 
progress in the year. Whilst I have previously 
reported that market conditions in this sector 
have been challenging, the management team 
in the parts division have returned the business 
to growth with improvements in both turnover 
and profit before tax to levels which are ahead 
of last year.
The group continues to generate significant 
levels of operational cash flow, resulting in 
lower levels of bank borrowings, a strengthened 
balance sheet and a stronger financial position. 
We also renewed and extended our banking 
facilities in February 2014 which has provided 
the group with additional funding for a longer 
period of time. Further details of our progress 
in both the motor division and the parts division 
are provided in the Strategic and Operational 
Review. A more detailed consideration of the 
improvement in financial performance during 
the year together with the cash flow and 
financial position of the group are given in the 
Financial Review.
DIVIDEND
I am pleased to announce that with another 
positive result for the year and improved 
financial position of the company, the board is 
again intending to increase the total dividend 
for the year. We are proposing to pay a final 
dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 
of 1.7p per share, giving a total dividend for 
the year ended 31 December 2013 of 2.58p 
per share (2012: 2.35p). This represents an 
increase in the total dividend for the year of 
10%. Payment of the final dividend is subject to 
approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting and will be payable on 4 June 2014.
BOARD CHANGES
As I mentioned in our interim report, Peter 
Jones, our Chief Executive of over four years, 
retired on 31 December 2013. Peter made an 
outstanding contribution to Lookers, leading 
the company during a period in which the 
profitability and market capitalisation increased 
significantly with consecutive record results 
from 2009 to the present day.
Andy Bruce, previously the group’s Chief 
Operating Officer, has now taken the role of 
Chief Executive, with effect from 1 January 
2014. Andy is a key member of the board and 
the development of the motor division under his 
leadership has been tremendous.
“There has clearly 
been a welcome 
recovery in both 
the UK new car 
market and the 
general UK 
economy and our 
motor division 
has produced an 
outstanding result 
during the year.”

OUTLOOK
There has clearly been a welcome recovery in 
both the UK new car market and the general UK 
economy and our motor division has produced 
an outstanding result during the year. In the 
year ahead we have further opportunities 
to develop our existing business as well as 
benefiting from acquisitions made in 2013. The 
parts division has made a good recovery and 
has further potential for future growth.
The group balance sheet continues to be 
strengthened by positive operational cash 
flow and we have substantial headroom in 
our bank facilities, with net debt continuing to 
be closely controlled. This provides financial 
security for the group as well as providing 
funding for strategic acquisitions in both 
the motor and parts divisions, as further 
opportunities arise.
I also referred in our interim report, to the 
appointment of Nigel McMinn as Managing 
Director of the motor division. Nigel assumed 
this important role on 1 January 2014 and is 
already making an excellent contribution to the 
company.
I am also pleased to report that Richard Walker 
joined the board on 4 February 2014 as a 
non-executive director. He brings significant 
operational expertise in the retail environment, 
which I am sure will be of great benefit to 
Lookers.
Together with all my colleagues on the board 
I would like to thank Peter for his invaluable 
contribution, wish Andy success in his new 
role and welcome Nigel and Richard to Lookers 
where I believe they will make a valuable 
contribution to the development of the company.

The new financial year has started well, with 
results so far being ahead of both budget and 
the prior year. We are therefore confident that 
we are well placed to deliver future growth. 
The group is in a strong position to continue to 
trade successfully in 2014 and develop further 
opportunities in all areas of the business
I would like to conclude by thanking all our 
people at Lookers for their hard work and 
dedication and without whom we would not 
have been able to deliver such a result for the 
fifth consecutive year.

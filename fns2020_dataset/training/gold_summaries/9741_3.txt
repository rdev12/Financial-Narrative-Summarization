 08 manx telecom plc annual report and accounts 2013 strategic report
chairman’s 
statement
I am pleased to present my inaugural 
report as Chairman of Manx Telecom 
plc (the ‘Company’ or ‘MT’) following  
the Company’s successful IPO on  
10 February 2014. I am delighted to 
report a positive set of results for 2013 
which include a 5% increase in revenues 
to £76.0m, and a 19.9% increase in 
adjusted operating profit to £18.1m.
10.02.14
successful 
flotation on AIM
Post year end, on 10 February 2014 the 
Company completed its successful IPO 
and admission to trading on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange 
raising £89.2m (before expenses) for  
the Company. Together with a new 
£80m credit facility agreement the IPO 
proceeds were used to refinance the 
balance sheet which leaves the 
Company well positioned to execute its 
strategy for future growth. The IPO also 
enabled Hg Capital and CPS Partners  
to divest their interests in the Company. 
As a result 97.6% of our shares are now 
freely traded and in the most part held 
by long-term institutional investors.
There are several other benefits of  
Manx Telecom being a public company. 
The process has brought stability and 
certainty to the Company’s ownership 
and the Company’s brand and profile 
should also be enhanced, creating further 
opportunities to grow the business.  
Our people will also benefit from being 
part of public company life through  
career opportunities and the opportunity 
to participate in incentive schemes.

Dividend policy
As stated in our AIM admission 
document, the Company intends to 
operate a progressive dividend policy; 
this will take into account our profitability, 
underlying growth in earnings and  
cash flows. It is the Board’s intention, 
based on current and future trading,  
to pay a dividend in respect of the year  
to 31 December 2014 that equates to 7% 
dividend yield, calculated on the IPO 
placing price of 142p per share.
Therefore, the Board plans to  
declare a maiden interim dividend  
with the Company’s results for the  
six months ending 30 June 2014, 
payable in November 2014. It is our 
intention to announce these results  
in September 2014.

People, management and Directors
The Company is fortunate to have an 
effective and hardworking workforce, 
which takes pride in providing a high 
standard of customer service.
The Board was restructured at IPO, 
when I joined as Non-Executive 
Chairman. Previous MT Holdings Ltd 
independent Directors Jeff Hume  
and Sir Miles Walker have been 
appointed to the plc Board as Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director  
and Non-Executive Director respectively.

+19.9%
increase in  
operating profit
I also believe a public Manx Telecom plc is 
in the interests of the Island as a whole. 
The Government has expressed a desire 
to have a well-invested telecoms 
infrastructure and the Company is now 
well placed to support its strategy of 
attracting e-commerce and other 
business to the Island.
An IPO process can be very demanding. 
Therefore it is appropriate that I 
acknowledge and thank the strong and 
capable senior team, together with the 
hardworking and dedicated people in 
MT, who remained focused on our 
customers to ensure that we delivered 
their expectations, whilst at the same 
time growing our revenues.

“
 Both these results and the 
successful IPO of Manx T elecom 
are a testament to the hard 
work and dedication of our 
talented and long-serving 
workforce, who take pride in 
providing an excellent customer 
experience. In addition it will 
also allow us to reward our 
shareholders with an attractive 
dividend which we expect  
to initiate during the current 
financial year . The Board 
confirms that current trading  
is in-line with expectations.

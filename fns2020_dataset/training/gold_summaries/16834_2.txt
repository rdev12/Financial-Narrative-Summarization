 Dobrinskoye gas processing plant
2014 Progress
Completed the final phase of the gas 
plant upgrade, increasing processing 
capacity to 1 million cubic metres per 
day (35.3 million cubic feet per day).
2015 Objectives
Complete an engineering study for a 
further upgrade to the gas processing 
plant for extraction of liquid petroleum 
gases (“LPG”).
Vostochny Makarovskoye 
(“VM”) gas/condensate field 
2014 Progress
Commenced drilling of new well, VM#3.
2015 Objectives
Complete drilling of well VM#3, 
sidetrack VM#4 and drill VM#5 to 
increase production capacity and utilise 
the full gas plant capacity.
During 2014 Volga Gas achieved its first full 
year of production at full operational 
capacity of its gas/condensate wells, laying 
the foundation for sustained production 
from its principal fields.
Volga at a Glance
Our assets are located in an established oil and gas 
province. The area benefits from the existing rail, road 
and pipeline infrastructure and proximity to Russia’s  
main energy markets.

02 VOLGA GAS PLC  |  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Dobrinskoye gas/ 
condensate field
2014 Progress
Managed production from the two 
existing wells.
2015 Objectives
Continue to maintain production from 
the two existing wells to maximise 
long-term extraction of gas and 
condensate.
Uzenskoye and Sobolevskoye 
oil fields
2014 Progress
Managed Uzenskoye production for the 
sixth year, with production constrained 
to prevent water cut. 
2015 Objectives
Maintain/enhance production profile 
and maximise extraction of oil from 
existing wells. Possible re-drill of 
Sobolevskoye to tap undeveloped 
reserves.
Exploration activity
2014 Progress
Identified potential shallow exploratory 
targets in the Karpenskiy Licence Area.
2015 Objectives
Potential discretionary exploration 
drilling of shallow, supra-salt targets 
during 2015–16.

Chairman’s Statement 
Nirj Deva
2012 was disappointing in terms of 
ﬁnancial performance, but strong in 
terms of cash generation, and product and 
market development. There were delays 
in securing expected orders and the Group 
changed its trading polices in order to 
reduce foreign exchange and asset risks 
by improving the level of letter of credit 
or proforma based business. This led to a 
reduction in revenues for the year to £4.94 
million (2011: £8.54 million) and a loss before 
tax of £2.20 million (2011: proﬁt £0.42 million). 
The policies were, however, successful in 
contributing to the generation of £0.45 million 
of cash from operations (2011: cash 
consumed £0.19 million).
Underlying R & D expenditure increased in 
line with identiﬁed opportunities. Together 
with d
2
w controlled life products and 
applications, we invested further into our 
d
2
p (anti-microbial and anti-fungal) and d
2
t 
(anti-counterfeiting) products. The Group 
employs a highly qualiﬁed scientiﬁc team with 
a presence in four continents. Full “in-house” 
development facilities became operational 
during 2012.
Our recycling division, Symphony Recycling 
Technologies, continued its investment in 
tyre recycling technologies. The Government-
funded RuPERT project successfully concluded 
at the end of the year and we are investigating 
commercial opportunities going forward. 
“ The most signiﬁcant aspect 
over the last twelve months 
was the increasing momentum 
of legislative change in favour 
of d
2
w oxo-biodegradable 
type products.”
Signiﬁcantly, and separate to RuPERT, we 
launched in early 2013 the SymTyre-S300 
tyre “ﬂat-pack” machine in order to generate 
initial revenues and to establish an early 
market presence.
The most signiﬁcant aspect over the 
last twelve months was the increasing 
momentum of legislative change in favour 
of d
2
w oxo-biodegradable type products. The 
results of this are expected to show in 2013. 
Pakistan announced in February 2013 that 
it has legislated against plastic which is not 
oxo-biodegradable, and the United Arab 
Emirates extended its product range covered 
by similar legislation that came into effect 
in 2012. This extension to the product range 
adds items such as food packaging and 
stretch ﬁlms to the carrier bags and refuse 
sacks that are currently being enforced. 
Other countries are following their example.
Exciting opportunities have been developed 
for our d
2
p product range with end-user 
beneﬁts relating to food and non-food sectors 
with potential cost savings being identiﬁed for 
the industry and the consumer. This is being 
marketed through our existing distribution 
network together with d
2
t, which we believe 
is a unique and valuable offering to users with 
a highly valued brand or to protect high value 
goods from unauthorised copying.
I am pleased to report that revenues for 
January and February 2013 are 100% higher 
than in the same period last year.
I would like to thank our distributors, staff 
and the Board for their hard work over the 
last year and we look forward to the future 
with conﬁdence.

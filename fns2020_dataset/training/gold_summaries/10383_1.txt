We operate a wide range of brands and 
formats which offer food and drink across 
a broad spectrum of price points and 
occasions, from a casual meeting with 
friends to special occasion dining. We have 
identified five market spaces, accounting 
for around half of the £78bn eating and 
drinking-out market, on which to focus:

 “Since I joined Mitchells & Butlers 
in October 2012, we have been 
committed to the fundamentals 
of our business plan. I remain 
confident that this is the right 
plan and will deliver sustainable 
profit growth and future 
shareholder value.”
Alistair Darby
Chief	 Executive
We are the UK’s largest operator of 
managed restaurants and pubs, with  
a high quality freehold estate and a 
portfolio of strong brands. Our strategy is 
to focus on the long-term growth of food 
within the £78bn eating and drinking-out 
market, with around three-quarters of our 
turnover coming from guests eating in our 
pubs and restaurants.
During the year we took a significant step to 
grow our business by acquiring 173 pubs from 
the Orchid Group. This acquisition enables  
us to create value through the conversion  
of the majority of these pubs into our own 
brands and formats, a reduction in its central 
overheads and the realisation of purchasing 
synergies across the whole estate.

Around three-quarters of our sales 
come from guests eating in our pubs 
and restaurants
In a challenging year, we continued to  
position the business for future growth,  
whilst delivering increased earnings per share 
of 1.2%. We have delivered sales growth 
underpinned by volumes rather than price, 
invested further capital in both expansion  
into new sites and enhancement of amenity, 
and continued to upgrade our key systems. 
Together with the quality of our estate and  
our people, we have confidence going into  
the year ahead.
In this review I will update you on our market, 
and our well-established business model and 
strategy as well as our progress against the key 
measures we use to monitor our performance.

Guests love to eat and drink with us.
Consistently deliver great service to our guests to drive repeat visits and 
recommendation, while delivering great financial results and shareholder returns.
Our business model is designed to maximise 
revenue and profit from our operations. We 
believe that by adopting industry-leading 
practices; recruiting, training and retaining  
the best people; and by focusing on excellent 
customer service we will deliver long-term 
growth in profits and shareholder value.
We recognise that we operate in a dynamic 
market with ever-changing circumstances. 
Our market is, in aggregate, a mature one 
with growth expected broadly to track GDP 
and consumer expenditure. However, there 
are dynamics within this market on which 
we can capitalise, namely the:
 • growth in branded outlets
 • continued growth in eating out
 • consumers’ continued focus on value
 • consumers’ demand for eating out at any 
time of day 
 • Passion
 • Respect
 • Innovation
 • Drive
 • Engagement

Our strategic priorities remain unchanged to:
 • focus the business on the most attractive 
market spaces within eating and drinking-out
 • develop superior brand propositions with 
high levels of consumer relevance
 • recruit, retain and develop engaged people 
who deliver excellent service for our guests
 • generate high returns on investment 
through scale advantage
 • maintain a sound financial base
KPIs
How we monitor our success
— Page 22
We measure our performance and progress 
against our strategy through five key 
performance indicators including two 
non-financial KPIs, relating to our ability to 
retain our employees and to the extent that 
our guests would recommend our businesses 
to their friends and family. These KPIs are 
reviewed at every Executive Committee 
meeting and are central to our understanding 
of our performance.
Risks

affect the Company, together with the key 
mitigating activities in place to manage those

with associated risk mitigation plans.
Through our research we have identified  
five market spaces in which our businesses 
operate. We tailor our approach on the  
basis of the different dynamics of each

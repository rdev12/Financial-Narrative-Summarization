highlights
2016 has been another year of real progress for 
us as we continued on our journey to transform 
Greggs into a winning brand in the food-on-the-
go market. We’ve been busy developing our 
great range of freshly prepared food in line with 
changing food trends, improving our shops and 
investing in customer service so we’re now 
tastier than ever! 
We’ve made good progress with our £25 million 
programme of investment in new systems and 
announced plans to invest £100 million in our 
supply chain, which will allow us to compete 
more effectively in the food-on-the-go market 
and grow shop numbers. The result has been  
a third consecutive year of strong like-for-like 
sales growth and record profits.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

INTRODUCTION
It has been a very satisfactory year for the company as we report our 
second set of full year results since listing on AIM, and I am pleased 
that the management team has met expectations and delivered 
Pure Wafer’s ﬁrst full year proﬁt. 300mm wafer throughput has 
rapidly increased, generating a large increase in turnover leading 
to sustainable and increasing proﬁtability.
The success of the business was recently recognised when as a result 
of the company’s continuing growth and achievements we won the 
accolade of being named the Western Mail’s “Welsh Company 
of the Year 2006”.

HIGHLIGHTS
The company has reported its ﬁrst full year proﬁt.
The management team has been further strengthened.
The company is well placed to capitalise on growth opportunities.
MANAGEMENT
We have continued to strengthen our management team during this 
ﬁnancial year with the appointment to the board of James Dearing 
(group ﬁnance director), and the management appointments of 
Professor Tony Peaker (chief scientiﬁc ofﬁcer) and Trevor Hoskins 
(operations director). These three appointments bring a wealth 
of experience and skills into the business to support our growth 
into the high volume manufacturing phase and solidify our new 
product introduction.
We have initiated a SAYE scheme during the period to incentivise 
our staff, aligning their interests with those of the shareholders. 
I would like to thank the entire team, led by Keith Baker for their 
hard work and congratulate them on their achievements.
OUTLOOK
We have built ourselves a valuable technology platform in the 
300mm wafer reclaim market which continues to grow quickly as 
our blue chip customers open new semiconductor fabs and convert 
existing 200mm production facilities to 300mm capable plants.
As well as the strong growth experienced in the expanding 
300mm marketplace, we are also experiencing good levels 
of demand from 200mm customers adopting our advanced 
high performance products. Management is therefore conﬁdent 
of another year of signiﬁcant growth.
We are now a leading market player in a consolidating global 
industry ensuring that we are well placed to capitalise on the growth 
opportunities as the market continues to develop.

 MARITIME ENTERPRISE
Inmarsat is the leading provider of global, mobile satellite 
communications services. On land, at sea and in the air,  
the Company serves Government, Commercial and NGO 
customers on every continent, providing highly reliable 
broadband data and voice connectivity services in regions 
where local network connectivity is unreliable or unavailable.
Through Inmarsat’s satellites, users can send data or make 
voice calls while outside the coverage of any terrestrial 
network. This vital capability has placed us at the heart of 
maritime and aviation safety services and positioned us at  
the forefront of satellite connectivity services for merchant 
shipping, air transport, news broadcast, energy and utilities 
companies, mining businesses and humanitarian aid  
agencies – to name but a few.

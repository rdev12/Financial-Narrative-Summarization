The group’s size and structure 
provides a unique competitive 
advantage allowing it to deliver a 
range of benefits, including continuous 
product development, wide and 
diverse product portfolio, extensive 
marketing support and next day 
distribution services, all of which are 
aimed at supporting and enhancing its 
customers’ market position.
Development of the group’s overall 
business is achieved by operating each 
of the group’s 56 businesses on an 
autonomous basis and encouraging the 
managers of each individual business 
to develop their own unique trading 
style, albeit within a well-developed 
and consistently applied framework of 
operational and financial control.
This diverse business structure, 
particularly in the UK, covering the 
retail and commercial sectors, gives 
the group substantial reach across 
floorcovering markets and provides 
suppliers with a flexible channel for the 
sales, marketing and distribution of 
their products.
In addition, the structure has allowed 
the group to be active with a wide 
and diverse product portfolio across 
a significant proportion of the 
floorcovering market and will, to a 
degree, help insulate the business from 
the downside risk arising from static or 
contracting markets.
In the UK, the business operates with 
56 businesses (2014: 55) served from 
four national distribution hubs
 
(2014: 4), 
14 distribution centres (2014: 14) and 29 
service centres (2014: 27).
Each individual business is supported 
by the group’s commitment to 
continued investment in people, 
product, marketing, distribution 
facilities, service centres and IT. This 
structural investment, in conjunction 
with the development of the identity of 
each individual business, has enabled 
us to bring together the benefits of a 
market facing culture delivering the 
latest selling, marketing and product 
initiatives with a comprehensive and 
sophisticated logistics operation.
Ultimately, the total investment 
has underpinned the growth and 
performance of each business thus 
enabling the group to establish itself 
as Europe’s leading floorcovering 
distributor.
Performance
One of the group’s key performance 
objectives is aimed at achieving growth 
in market share. We drive this growth 
by setting each of our individual 
businesses, in conjunction with the 
management teams, an annual growth 
parameter, which is collectively set to 
outperform the anticipated underlying 
growth in the market.
Once again, it is pleasing to record 
that the group’s growth in UK revenue 
during 2015, as has consistently 
been the case for a number of years, 
outperformed growth in the UK 
floorcovering market with the like 
for like growth of 3.9% exceeding 
the estimated market growth in 2015 
of 3.4%.
 
The increase in like for like 
revenue reflected slightly stronger 
growth in residential, up 4.1%, 
compared with commercial up 3.5%. 
The revenue mix between residential 
and commercial floorcoverings in the 
UK has remained broadly at the same 
level for a number of years, and 2015 
maintained the balance at 69% and 
31% respectively. 
The resilience of residential sales is in 
part because a typical purchase by a 
residential end-user is of one piece of 
carpet at an average size of 4m by 5m.
 
It is well-established that people in the 
UK tend to replace carpets one room 
at a time, helping with the affordability 
of the purchase. The trend towards 
grey coloured carpeting has continued 
and, of the new best-selling carpet 
products launched during the year, grey 
carpet accounted for about 40% of the 
content of each range in the middle to 
higher price points.
 
All of the group’s principal product 
groups showed growth on the 
corresponding period. Sales of the 
Lifestyle Floors brand increased by 
28% as a result of further investment in 
sampling, an improving product profile 
and increased market penetration.
On the Continent, economic 
headwinds continue to influence 
performance and the overall trading 
result has registered a further decline 
during the year.  It is encouraging 
that the rate of decline slowed in the 
second half with the markets showing 
signs of stabilisation.
 
We continue to 
believe that there are opportunities 
to develop each individual business 
irrespective of the market conditions in 
each individual territory. Gross margins 
continue to be protected and costs 
managed diligently. As ever, additional 
revenue volume would transform 
the operating performance of these 
businesses.
Chief Executive’s Review
Our Strategy
The group continues to follow a strategy focused on 
developing its floorcovering distribution business in the UK 
and Continental Europe and improving the all-round service 
offering it provides to customers.
06 24347.04    5 April 2016 2:50 PM    Proof 6
During the year, we have maintained 
our investment in people, marketing, 
infrastructure and the promotion and 
development of each of our individual 
business identities. We continue to 
provide extensive marketing support 
to our customers and, through our 
well trained and knowledgeable sales 
teams, seek to gain an increasing share 
of their business opportunities. In 
addition, our teams are also focused 
on prospecting for new customers and 
business opportunities.
Developments in the year included a 
new buyers app for use on an iPad to 
promote group-wide best practice and 
an iPhone based driver delivery app to 
further improve customer service.
Investments
Over the six year period from 2010 to 
2015, we have used the group’s balance 
sheet strength, allied with its positive 
cash flow, to invest £39.1 million in 
property, plant and equipment, with 
a further £19.7 million expenditure 
forecast for 2016 and 2017. This level of 
capital expenditure has been running, 
on average, at a rate of 1.5 times 
depreciation.
Expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment during 2015 was £2.9 
million, with the investment being 
focused on maintenance covering 
items such as forklift trucks and 
racking. Expenditure for 2016 was 
previously forecast to be £18.0 million, 
a significant portion of which was 
earmarked for the new 160,000 square 
foot distribution facility in Ipswich 
for Faithfull’s Floorcovering, one of 
the group’s regional multi-product 
businesses. Owing to delays to the 
start of construction at Ipswich, which is 
now expected in the latter half of 2016, 
projected expenditure is expected to 
be £13.5 million over the course of 2016 
and 2017.
Once the Ipswich distribution facility 
is fully operational, the group will 
have a well invested portfolio of four 
national distribution hubs and 14 
regional distribution centres in the UK 
as well as four distribution centres on 
the Continent. These facilities should 
be able to satisfy the group’s capacity 
requirements and growth expectations 
for a number of years and there 
should be no requirement for further 
investment in additional or replacement 
distribution facilities in this time frame. 
During recent years, we have 
supplemented our distribution network 
in the UK with a number of service 
centres with the aim of improving 
customer service by making product 
more readily available. This type of 
investment is particularly helpful for 
customers who prefer to collect their 
product needs as opposed to relying 
on our delivery service.
During the year, we continued to 
expand the number of service centres 
we operate across the UK and at the 
end of the year they numbered 29.
 
The provision of trade counters is 
also offered within our distribution 
centres thereby bringing the number of 
collection points in the UK to 44. There 
are still some locations that would 
benefit from the opening of a service 
centre and we anticipate expanding 
our coverage in the future, subject to 
the availability of suitable sites. The 
opening of two new service centres in 
Croydon and Hull is imminent
Acquisitions
We intend to continue to utilise our 
capital resource to augment the group’s 
growth with further acquisitions. 
We have a history of quickly and 
successfully integrating small bolt-
on acquisitions into our existing 
infrastructure, achieving overhead 
synergies and an earnings enhancing 
performance.
During the year, we acquired Matty’s 
Wholesale Carpets, and integrated its 
operations into our distribution facility 
in Coleshill. The acquisition has been 
immediately earnings enhancing and 
the group has also benefited in 2015 
from acquisitions completed in the 
prior year.
Prospects
Trading in the current year has started 
well, with like for like growth in the UK 
of 6.3% during the first eight weeks 
of the year. We are confident that the 
group will continue to perform well 
during the year ahead.

Continued investment in our people for the future...
With the support of third party training providers, 
the group continued with its programmes for senior 
managers, sales managers and representatives 
throughout the year and expanded the number  
of courses with the introduction of additional 
training opportunities for our sales office and 
distribution managers.
In addition, the induction training offered to all our new sales 
representatives was reviewed and improved. The enhanced 
programme, which includes supplier led training to provide  
better product knowledge, has proven to be both rewarding  
and beneficial.
The group has also looked to widen its appeal and a recruitment 
process aimed at attracting graduates by developing a set 
programme which allows the individuals to gain a thorough 
knowledge and understanding of all aspects of the business.  
Past experience has taught us that our best talent is home grown 
so by attracting and recruiting able young people at the start of 
their career, we have an improved potential to develop future 
managers to take the business forward.

Supplier App
During the year, we introduced a supplier app to promote 
and share best practice amongst our buying managers with 
the purpose of enabling our managers to record and share 
information gathered during their supplier meetings with 
appropriate colleagues elsewhere around the group.
The app will allow our managers to function more 
efficiently in their meetings with suppliers and in many ways 
provides a mirror image of the CRM app used by our sales 
representatives with their customers.
The functionality of the app allows meeting notes to be 
taken, images of product to be recorded and attached to 
text and a planning facility and diary reference for the quick 
and easy scheduling of meetings and visits with suppliers.
In addition to posts, a manager can also request his/her 
supplier reports to be downloaded and viewed within the 
app. Previously these were viewed via email. The apps built 
in calendar enables the manager to customise the various 
options. For example, the manager can request a date and 
time for information and a suite of reports relating to the 
supplier meeting to be generated in a timely manner so 
that they contain the most up to date information prior to 
attending their meeting. They can also state the duration of 
the meeting and make note of the expected attendees as 
well as send the appointment as an invite to other managers 
or the suppliers themselves
When in use, the app invites the manager to follow a process 
both before and after the supplier meeting; the manager 
will now create meeting plans which highlight the meeting 
objectives. Once the meeting is concluded, the manager will 
complete their meeting notes and any follow up actions. The 
notes of the meeting can then be shared with other relevant 
managers.
Driver App
The new driver app has been designed for use on the 
iPhone 6 plus and provides our drivers and customers with 
a comprehensive suite of information that enhances the 
service we are able to provide.
The app gives the driver a vehicle check facility that all our 
drivers must complete before leaving the distribution facility 
to ensure the vehicle is fit for purpose; a schedule of the 
deliveries loaded on the vehicle; and the ability to generate 
electronic proof of delivery and subsequent invoice.
Satellite navigation is included within the package and 
importantly, it allows the driver to notify the customers when 
he estimates arriving at their premises.

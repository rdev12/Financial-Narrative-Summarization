Review of operations 
YouGov’s	business	performance	throughout	 the	year	has	been	strong.	In	the	UK	we	 	 h a v e	m o v e d	t o	n e w	o f fi c e s ,	q u a d r u p l i n g		 our	capacity	to	allow	for	our	growth	in	 h e a d c o u nt	i n	t h e	f o r t h c o m i n g	fi n a n c i a l	y e a r .	
We	are	very	pleased	with	the	business	 performance	in	the	UK	and	the	Middle	East.
	 The	YouGov	brand	continues	to	obtain	 substantial	media	coverage	in	both	the	UK	 and	the	Middle	East.	We	continue	to	be	the	 most	quoted	market	research	agency	in	 these	territories.	Our	brand	is	strong	and	 	 we	strive	to	protect	it.
YouGov	 retains	 substantial	 intellectual	 capital,	 not	 only	 in	 terms	 of	 our	 unique	 technological	 solutions,	 but	 also	 in	 our	 methodology.	 We	maintain	an	ongoing	programme	of	 research	and	development	and	investment	 in	our	intellectual	capital.	Research	and	 development	is	a	priority	at	YouGov	hence	 its	leadership	by	Stephan	Shakespeare	 	 c o - f o u n d e r	a n d	C h i ef	I n n o v a t i o n s	O f fi c e r .
Our	 UK	 operations	 have	 grown	 strongly	 with	 revenues	 growing	 by	 65%	 from	 £4.8m	 in	 the	 y e a r 	 e n d i n g 	 3 1 	 J u l y 	 2 0 0 6 	 t o 	 £ 7 . 9 m 	 i n 	 t h e 	 y e a r

range	 of	 products:	 BrandIndex,	 Omnibus	 	 and	 our	 bespoke	 offering.
At	a	time	of	ongoing	investment	in	the	 business,	we	have	seen	no	margin	pressure	 in	our	business 	 overall	 as	 clients	 have	 continuously	 valued	the	quality	and	depth	of	 our	research	to	meet	their	business	needs.
In	the	Middle	East	operations	revenues	 have	grown	by	39%	from	£4.6m	in	the	year	 e n d i n g	3 1	J u l y	2 0 0 6	t o	£ 6 . 4 m	i n	t h e	y e a r

A t	t h e	b e g i n n i n g	o f	t h e	l a s t	fi n a n c i a l	y e a r ,	
we	established	an	Operational	Board	which	 is	chaired	by	myself,	and	includes	our	Chief	 Fi n a n c i a l	O f fi c e r ,	C h i ef	I n n o v a t i o n s	O f fi c e r	
and	the	country	representatives.	This	 reorganisation	was	vital	to	allow	us	to	 manage	our	business	whilst	delivering	 growth	and	greater	internationalisation.
10	 YouGov	 Annual	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2007	 www.yougov.com We	launched	two	new	businesses	in	the	 year,	YouGovCentaur	and	YouGovStone	 which	are	both	contributing	as	expected.
YouGovCentaur	will	focus	on	the	lucrative	 area	of	specialist	panels	from	lawyers	to	 engineers	and	marketeers.	We	will	engage	 with	 these	 audiences	 so	 as	 to	 provide	 clients	 with	an	in	depth	research	and	product	 portfolio	that	meets	their	business	needs.	 YouGovStone	focuses	on	opinion	leader	 research.	More	and	more	companies	 	 and	organisations	are	seeking	ways	of	 understanding	how	opinion	leaders	affect	 the	world	we	live	in.
	 Following	the	year	end,	we	announced	that	 we	have	concluded	our	joint	venture	with	 Execution,	YouGovExecution,	and	launched	 YouGovAlpha,	YouGov’s	100%	subsidiary	to	 take	primary	research	for	the	investment	 community	forward.
We	 believe	 that	 companies	 are	 about	 people	 and	I	want	to	thank	everyone	who	has	 worked	so	hard	to	make	2007	a	success	 and	look	forward	to	a	successful	2008.
Our future strategy 
We	are	well	positioned	to	be	the	premier	 international	provider	of	market	and	opinion	 r e s e a r c h .	W e	a r e	f o c u s e d	o n	s p e c i fi c

services,	brand,	health,	consumer,	 organisational	and	public	sector	research.	 We	will	continue	to	recruit	the	best	minds	 and	apply	our	technological	development	to	 support	our	growth.
We	will	roll	out	our	syndicated	research	with	 BrandIndex	being	launched	in	the	USA	and	 other	geographies.	Post	year	end,	we	have	 acquired	psychonomics,	a	top	10	agency	 	 i n	G e r m a n y ,	a n d	Z a p e r a ,	t h e	‘ j e w e l	o f	t h e	
Nordic	region’,	in	Scandinavia	and	exercised	 our	option	to	acquire	Polimetrix	in	the	USA.	 This	gives	us	a	presence	in	5	of	our	target	 hubs	around	the	world.	 As	well	as	in-depth	knowledge	within	 s p e c i fi c	i n d u s t r y	a r e a s ,	t h e	a c q u i s i t i o n s		 will	extend	YouGov’s	capability	in	target	 g e o g r a p h i e s	f o r	g r o w t h .	S i g n i fi c a nt	p a r t s		 of	the	acquired	businesses	will	be	moved	 	 to	YouGov’s	model	and	the	staff	will	be	 retained	for	their	sector	expertise.	 Ultimately	we	aim	to	provide	a	constant	 stream	of	primary	data	from	strategic	 business	hubs	around	the	world	with	a	 global	panel	and	a	global	set	of	syndicated	 p r o d u c t s :	‘ T h e	Y o u G o v	S c r e e n ’ .

beginning	to	achieve	that	goal.

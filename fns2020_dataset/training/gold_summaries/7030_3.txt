 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“ Order intake for the year was a record 
at £208.0 million, 36% higher than the 
previous year. The closing order book at the 
end of the year was 71% ahead of 2005 
at £206.8 million. This is a solid foundation 
for future growth and is an indication of 
the Group’s success in developing its four 
core businesses to leading positions in their 
world-wide markets.”
The Group has recorded a second year of outstanding growth since ﬂotation 
which is a tribute to the expertise and commitment of all of its employees. 
I thank them all on behalf of the board.
Turnover for the year increased by over 20% to £137 .0 million (2005: £113.9 million). 
Operating profit before amortisation rose by 21.5% to £9.1 million 
(2005: £7 .5 million) and proﬁt before taxation rose by nearly 29% to £8.5 million 
(2005: £6.6 million). Net cash ﬂow from operating activities was £12.6 million 
(2005: £8.6 million) and at the end of the year the Group had net funds 
of £27 .4 million (2005: £2.5 million).
Earnings per share, after adjusting for the issue of new shares at the time of 
ﬂotation, rose by 10.6% to 16.7p (2005: 15.1p after adjustment, 18.4p on a 
statutory basis). Y our directors are recommending a ﬁnal ordinary dividend of 
4.2p per share which, if approved, would result in a total dividend declared in 
respect of the year of 6.0p per share (2005: 3.24p). Subject to shareholders’ 
approval, the ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 31 July 2006 to all shareholders  
on the register on 7 July 2006.
Order intake for the year was a record at £208.0 million, 36% higher than the 
previous year. The closing order book at the end of the year was 71% ahead 
of 2005 at £206.8 million. This is a solid foundation for future growth and is 
an indication of the Group’s success in developing its four core businesses to 
leading positions in their worldwide markets. A review of the outlook for gas 
systems, inert gas systems, pump systems and wastewater systems mainly in 
the marine sector, provides evidence for sustained organic growth. The Group 
is continuing to develop a range of new technologies in these sectors to 
maintain its competitive advantage.
In December the Group raised £17 .5 million before costs through the issue  
of 6.1 million ordinary shares. The principal objective was to strengthen the 
balance sheet and support the bonding and working capital requirements of 
substantial growth. The Group will look for strategic acquisitions which ﬁt strict 
criteria for enhancing the business and shareholder value. Much of the industry 
in which the Group operates is fragmented and signiﬁcant consolidation is 
expected over time. The Group intends to play a pro-active role in this process.
Hamworthy plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005/06 04 Hamworthy plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005/06 05 The Group is on programme to introduce International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) for the year ending 31 March 2007, a year earlier than 
required for AIM companies. Further development of the Group’s corporate 
governance policies has continued and the board has completed an evaluation 
of its own performance. An external evaluation will be considered at an 
appropriate time. In an ambitious programme, all Group sites will seek 
accreditation to environmental standard ISO 14001 during 2007/8 and all 
manufacturing sites will seek accreditation to the Occupational Health and 
Safety Series (OHSAS 18001) by the end of this reporting year.
Since ﬂotation, the Group has grown rapidly. It is not only much larger but  
also more broadly based and has a signiﬁcantly increased presence in its key 
markets in the Far East and in Europe. Its products are technologically advanced 
and meet current customer requirements. Further cost-effective technology 
developments will come to market over the next few years. The longer term 
strategic outlook is good with several opportunities for acquisition likely to 
become available.
The board looks forward to future growth with conﬁdence.

TRULY GLOBAL
Operating in a worldwide market place requires a truly global 
company. Hamworthy is big enough to create that global presence 
and is uniquely placed to apply international strength to local 
issues. Through localised manufacturing facilities and extensive 
customer support, Hamworthy is able to provide customers with 
faster response times and a more personal and direct service.
Like shipping, the offshore oil and gas sector is a truly global market. 
Hamworthy’s international presence enabled it to win an order 
from Woodside, Australia’s largest publicly traded oil and gas 
exploration and production company.
With a continued emphasis on safer and more environmentally 
friendly cargo pumping systems, Woodside speciﬁed Hamworthy 
electric-drive deepwell cargo pumps for its ﬂoating product storage 
and ofﬂoading vessel (FPSO) Nganhurra. T o fulﬁl this order, Hamworthy 
utilised a sales and technical team based in Norway with the 
support of Hamworthy’s South Korean ofﬁce network where the 
Nganhurra was built by Samsung. Hamworthy products for this 
order were delivered from its factories in Denmark and Singapore.

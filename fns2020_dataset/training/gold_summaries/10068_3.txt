Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report Melrose’s ninth set of annual results 
since flotation in 2003. In this time Melrose has raised £785 
million in capital for acquisitions and has returned £771 million in 
capital returns and dividends giving a current net investment by 
shareholders of £14 million. After payment of the final dividend 
proposed below, Melrose will have repaid all equity raised. 
At the current share price our market capitalisation means 
that approximately £1.5 billion of value has been created for 
shareholders since 2003. 
RESULTS FOR THE GROUP
These accounts report the results for the Group for the year to  
31 December 2011 and comparatives for the previous year.
Revenue from continuing businesses for the year was £1,153.9 
million (2010: £1,035.4 million) and headline profit before tax 
(before exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset 
amortisation) was £161.2 million (2010: £121.7 million). Headline 
diluted earnings per share (‘EPS’) on continuing and discontinued 
businesses were 28.8p (2010: 24.1p). Diluted EPS on continuing 
and discontinued businesses were 59.0p (2010: 27.0p). 
Further details of these results are contained in the Finance 
Director’s review.
DIVIDENDS
The Board intends to pay a final dividend of 8.4p per share (2010: 
7.0p) on 14 May 2012 to those shareholders on the register at  
13 April 2012, subject to approval at the AGM on 9 May 2012. This 
gives a total for the year of 13.0p per share (2010: 11.0p), which 
represents an 18% increase.
We continue to pursue a progressive policy even in years such as 
this where a capital return has been made.

TRADING
2011 saw an excellent performance from our businesses. Headline 
operating profit was up 23% on sales up 11% reflecting another 
year of increased headline operating margins, which are now at 
15.7%. We believe there is more to come from these businesses 
both in profits and margins and, in this context, the most 
encouraging sign was the increase in order intake throughout the 
year, with the fourth quarter being the strongest.
We have now fully entered the investment phase with increased 
capital expenditure across all of our businesses. Nevertheless 
net debt has remained at £290 million, which means that this 
investment has been funded out of operational cash generation. 
We continued to maintain strict controls on working capital and we 
expect this excellent cash generation to continue.
Further details on trading are included in the Chief Executive’s 
review.
BOARD CHANGES
We have announced today a forthcoming change of roles within 
the Melrose Board. Simon Peckham, currently our Chief Operating 
Officer, will take over as Chief Executive from the next Annual 
General Meeting. David Roper, whom he succeeds, will become 
Executive Vice-Chairman. As a founder Director, David has been a 
highly important and fundamental part of Melrose and its success 
since inception in 2003. Equally Simon, also a founder Director, 
has made a huge contribution to our progress and has fully earned 
this appointment. On behalf of shareholders I would like to thank 
them both for their efforts past and future. This is part of a planned 
management succession programme, and all your executive 
Directors remain fully committed and are looking forward to 
continuing Melrose’s development and success. 
We were delighted to welcome Justin Dowley to our Board as a non-
executive Director last September. He has had a distinguished career 
in the City and we look forward to his contribution to Melrose.
STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
The sale of Dynacast in July 2011 for an enterprise value of 
£377 million and the subsequent return of these proceeds to 
shareholders was a further demonstration of our strategy. The first 
and most important part of our strategy of ‘buy, improve, sell’ is, of 
course, making good acquisitions. We continue to look for suitable 
opportunities but, it should go without saying, we will be extremely 
careful in the application of our criteria, which include price. We are 
optimistic that we will identify something which will add further to 
the excellent growth of the Group.
At the interim stage we highlighted the strong end markets which 
most of our businesses serve and the expected return, in due 
course, on our increased investment programmes. Since then 
order books have continued to improve and we feel we are seeing 
early signs of recovery in the USA. Our businesses in the Rest of 
the World continue to perform well. While we are naturally cautious 
about economies in continental Europe, we are encouraged by 
current trading and the outlook for 2012.

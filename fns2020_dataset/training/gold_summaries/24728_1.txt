Market conditions proved challenging for  
our investment management teams this year. 
On a three year basis, 77% of our assets 
outperformed, demonstrating that we 
continue to deliver exceptional long-term 
track records for our clients. On a one year 
basis, performance was not as good, with 
50% of assets outperforming. 
One year performance was weakest in  
our European Equities and Global Equities 
capabilities. At the beginning of 2016, some 
of our biggest European funds saw a period 
of poor investment performance as concerns 
over China and a rally in the energy sector 

performance in many of our funds suffered 
throughout the year because of their lack  
of exposure to the US and the US dollar.

investment styles and theses, which means 
that even in tough market conditions we 
continue to have interesting investment  
ideas to discuss with our clients. 
Whether our performance is good or poor,  
we always make sure that our clients have 
frequent access to our managers, both  
in person and digitally, to make sure that  
they remain well informed. Strong client 
relationships can help mitigate the effects  
of poor short-term investment performance.

mainly as a result of a global pull-back from 
exposure to European assets. This was  
in sharp contrast to last year, where our 
well-regarded European capabilities saw us 
deliver industry-leading growth and market 
share gains. Whilst disappointing, we see this 
as a result of the current environment rather 
than a longer-term trend.

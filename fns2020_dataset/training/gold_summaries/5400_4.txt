EMIS Group is the UK GP software market 
leader providing primary care clinical systems.
EMIS Web, our flagship product, uses the 
latest technologies to help GPs manage every 
aspect of providing the best possible care to 
their patients. It enables GPs to share data 
with other healthcare professionals involved 
in their patients’ care, so everyone has the 
complete picture. This leads to improved 
patient treatment times and outcomes.
Community, Children’s and Mental Health 
With EMIS Web, healthcare professionals 
working in community, children’s and mental 
health can easily access records and share 
patient data electronically.
It’s more efficient for the organisation and 
provides a better experience for the patient.
It can use automatic recall schedules to invite 
children for vaccinations or make it easier to 
create care plans across different community 
settings. EMIS mobile allows true mobile 
working online or offline at the point of care.

play a key part in making decisions about their

and up to date reference material.

EMIS Group software is used by community 
pharmacies across the UK for managing 
and dispensing patients’ medications.
ProScript is the most widely used system in the 
pharmacy software market. It efficiently manages 
the dispensing process and handles standard tasks 
such as labelling and endorsing, patient records, 
ordering and stock control.
Pharmacies using ProScript and GPs using EMIS 
Web are improving patient outcomes by working 
together to deliver “joined-up” services. Pharmacy 
Access allows pharmacies to view a summarised 
patient record and order repeat prescriptions 
direct from the GP.
This means pharmacists can view the patient 
GP record, helping to improve patient care by 
spotting any issues with medication before it 
becomes a bigger problem for the patient.

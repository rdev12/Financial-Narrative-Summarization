EBIQUITY BACKGROUND
Ebiquity Plc* was founded in 1997,

The Company floated on the 
AIM market in 2000 and in 2005 it 
acquired Billetts, already a highly 
respected international name in 
media consultancy and analytics.
Today, the Group employs over 250 
people in the UK across two locations 
– at our head office next to Tower 
Bridge in London and in Bromley, 
Kent, where our extensive data

We work with over 400 clients 
providing media consulting, analysis

The aim for the next year is to build on the achievements to date whilst 
continuing to develop new markets. The Group has improved its technical 
facilities and increased its team to ensure that product development is 
continually advanced.
The Group is working closely with its distributors and will be investing in 
various marketing opportunities during the forthcoming year to ensure 
that revenue growth for d

 Controlled-life products is maximised. 
These products show strong growth globally and are currently being sold 
into 90 countries.
Developments on Symphony Energy are progressing with the aim of 
commercialisation as soon as practical.
These impressive results reflect the efforts of all involved within the 
Group, whom I thank, and we look forward to building on this excellent 
foundation. I would like to congratulate and thank the many people 
associated with helping the Group become what it is today; a Group that is 
profitable, cash-flow positive and one that is in good position to capture a 
substantial part of the potentially large and developing oxo-biodegradable 
plastics market. Thank you also to our many loyal shareholders and staff 
who have worked tirelessly over the years and have supported the 
management team since inception. It is due to this remarkable and long 
standing effort, that our technology, the d

 brand, is visible in more 
than 90 countries worldwide, and this in itself is an achievement with no 
parallels by any other firm in this industry sector .

 GROUP AT A GLANCE
Infrastructure is the backbone of the 
economy and society. Everyone relies on 
energy, water, communications, transport 
and buildings.
Balfour Beatty finances, develops, builds 
and maintains the infrastructure that 
underpins daily life, supports communities 
and enables economic growth.
Together with our partners and supply 
chain of small and large firms, we know 
how to deliver innovative, efficient and 
highly complex infrastructure projects  
with the highest levels of quality, safety 
and technical expertise. We integrate  
with customers and local supply chains, 
and work with local communities.
Balfour Beatty’s main geographies are  
the UK and US, and the Group has a 
significant presence in the Middle East  
and South East Asia. 
Our key market sectors are:
• infrastructure
• transport (roads, rail and aviation)
• power, energy and water
• buildings
• commercial
• social (health, education, defence, 
institutional and housing).
Over the last 100 years we have created 
iconic buildings and infrastructure all over 
the world including the London Olympics’ 
Aquatic Centre, Hong Kong’s first Zero 
Carbon building, the world’s biggest 
shopping mall in Dubai, the National 
Museum of the Marine Corps in the US  
and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.

The Investments portfolio continues to 
grow as we diversify into new sectors and 
expand into new geographical markets. 
We continue to realise value through  
the investment recycling programme by 
selling investments that are mature and 
operationally proven, while preserving 
interests in strategic projects or sectors 
that offer opportunities to the Group.

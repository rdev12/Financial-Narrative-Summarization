chairman’s statement
“Telford Homes has
continued to make good
progress during the last
12 months and once
again I am reporting on
a record year in which
our financial targets
have been exceeded.”
David Holland 
Chairman (Non-Executive)
The Company’s strategy is to pre-sell
properties as early as possible, in many cases
before construction has commenced, and a
number of successful sales launches have
contributed to this aim of reducing risk in the
business. At 31st March 2008 unrecognised
revenue secured by contracts exchanged was
£125 million, higher than ever before. Our
strategy has put us in a very strong position
in the face of a weakening market. 
Since last summer the Company has been
more cautious when investing in new land
given the restricted availability and higher
costs of mortgage finance for homebuyers
and the impact this had on consumer
confidence. This prudent approach will
continue. Funds have been retained for
investment in our partnerships with housing
transfer organisations but other land
purchases will be restricted to those where
the initial cash outflow is limited or cash
inflows from the development are secured. 
We expect trading conditions to improve
when restrictions ease in the mortgage
market although it is not clear when this will
occur. There remains a need to increase the
supply of new homes over the next few years
and this, together with ongoing growth and
regeneration in East London, underpins the
future success of Telford Homes.

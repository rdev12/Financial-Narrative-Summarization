EBITDA
Existing assets continue to perform well, we produced an 
average of 24,222 Boepd in 2013, an increase of 6%. This was 
around the middle of the guidance range we indicated at the 
start of the year, even though first production from Alma/
Galia was rescheduled into 2014.
In 2013, we produced 8.7 million barrels of oil from our 
existing reserves. We also added 74.9 million barrels of oil to 
2P reserves; this was achieved through the sanction of the 
Kraken development, the extension of the planned Alma/
Galia field life, selective asset acquisitions, such as our stake 
in the producing Alba field, and from upward revisions to our 
existing fields. 
In 2013, cash flow generated from operations was $562.7 
million and EBITDA was $621.3 million. We invested $984.3 
million of cash on capital expenditure for the future growth 
of the business. 
In 2013, we agreed the acquisition of a 50% interest in the 
Greater Kittiwake Area, giving us an opportunity to extend  
its field life and also to enhance reserves by facilitating a 
proposed development of the Scolty and Crathes discoveries. 
This fits well with our objectives of managing maturing fields, 
exploiting nearby discoveries and near field exploration 
OVERVIEW
CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE’S 
REPORT
EnQuest’s strategy and business 
model; a good performance in 2013
In 2013, following the sanction of the 
large Kraken field in November, 
EnQuest increased its net 2P reserve 
base by 51.6% to 194.8 MMboe, 
reflecting a reserve replacement ratio 
of over 850% for 2013 and strongly 
reinforcing the sustainability of 
EnQuest’s growth model.

opportunities. EnQuest also announced its first acquisition of 
an international producing asset, giving us an operating 
platform in Tunisia with short term infill drilling opportunities 
and a low cost entry point into potentially substantial 
development opportunities at the Zarat and Elyssa fields.
EnQuest is well positioned for sustainable growth and is 
successfully implementing its strategy to deliver that growth.
Operations and developments
Health, safety, environment and assurance (‘HSE&A’)
EnQuest will always maintain the highest level of vigilance 
with regard to HSE&A, we should acknowledge some 
significant achievements in 2013. The transfer of duty 
holdership (direct management of production platforms) to 
EnQuest from an outsourced contractor was conducted 
safely and effectively; a natural evolution of our integrated 
approach to operations management, giving us increased 
direct control over our assets. 
In 2013, EnQuest’s 2013 lost time injury frequency rate (‘LTIF’) 
of 1.4 compared favourably with the latest available industry 
average of 1.9. Also encouraging was that at the end of 2013 
our safety critical backlog (a measure of outstanding safety 
maintenance items) was almost zero. 
We will not be complacent, we have put in place a new series 
of challenging HSE&A objectives for 2014, by way of 
continuous improvement planning. We continue to exhibit 
leadership in demonstrating safety that comes before 
production and operations. 
Operations
In 2013, EnQuest delivered good production growth of 6%. 
We produced oil from the Thistle field at volumes not 
achieved since the mid-1990s, demonstrating EnQuest’s 
ability to rejuvenate maturing fields and to extend their field 
lives. New drilling at the successful Don fields enabled them 
to maintain their position as EnQuest’s highest volume 
producing hub. 
EnQuest delivered nine wells in 2013, including the successful 
Thistle and Dons drilling programmes. Uptime performance 
was strong and in the top quartile of UK operators as 
assessed by the UK Production Efficiency Taskforce, utilising 
DECC data, despite the relative maturity of EnQuest’s assets. 
The Heather/Broom hub also made a strong contribution to 
production, reflecting good well performance at Broom and 
improved operating efficiency at the Heather platform. In 
2014, Heather returns to drilling for the first time in eight 
years, following its recommencement of rig operations at the 
end of 2013.
Developments
Kraken
In November 2013, EnQuest delivered the sanction of the 
Kraken development in the UK North Sea; the largest single 
oil investment sanctioned in the UK last year. EnQuest 
originally acquired its interests in Kraken after a series of 
appraisal wells had proven both the presence of oil and also 
that its flow characteristics were good. Prior to sanction, 
EnQuest had a good understanding of the reservoir, had 
completed a full front end engineering design (‘FEED’) 
process and had the major supplier arrangements already in 
place, including those for the floating, production, storage 
and offloading vessel (‘FPSO’). 
EnQuest is the operator of the project. The Kraken 
development uses conventional technology and is 
anticipated to produce over 30,000 Boepd net to EnQuest  
at its peak rate; we expect it to come onstream by 2017, 
creating EnQuest’s sixth operated producing hub. With its 
long field life in excess of 25 years, Kraken further increases 
the sustainability of EnQuest’s growth. Comprehensive 
additional information on the Kraken project was published 
at EnQuest’s capital markets day for investors in Q4 2013, 
these materials are available on EnQuest’s website. 
Alma/Galia
In late 2012, EnQuest confirmed the sanction of the Alma/
Galia development, now with a gross 34 MMboe. By the end 
of 2013, the Alma/Galia subsea infrastructure had been put in 
place, drilling and completion operations were well underway 
and the ‘EnQuest Producer’ FPSO vessel had been moved to 
the Tyne in Newcastle, to undertake finishing yard scope and 
onshore commissioning. 
In H2 2013, as an assessment of the remaining work 
concluded that additional time was needed for the project, 
the anticipated date of first production was rescheduled into 
2014. Additional information on the Alma/Galia project was 
provided to investors at EnQuest’s capital markets day in Q4 
2013, including details in relation to health and safety, 
progress in the field, also revised capex and opex, with 
EnQuest’s net capex cost for the first phase at c.$45 per bbl. 
EnQuest now expects production to start in H2 2014. Alma/
Galia will significantly increase EnQuest’s production when it 
comes onstream, with an initial net peak production of 
c.13,000 Boepd. 18

International 
In Q4 2012, EnQuest announced its first measured steps 
outside of the UK North Sea, replicating its existing model by 
targeting previously underdeveloped assets in what will be a 
small number of other maturing regions. In 2012, EnQuest 
entered Malaysia with an initial investment of only US$3 
million, to acquire Nio Petroleum (Sabah) Limited and thereby 
a 42.5% interest in Blocks SB307 and SB308, offshore Sabah, 
Malaysia. In 2014, a well is being matured for drilling offshore 
Sabah, Malaysia.
In January 2014, EnQuest was offered and accepted two 
licences in the Norwegian 2013 Awards in Pre-defined Areas 
(‘APA’) licensing round, both located in the Norwegian Sea. 
EnQuest was offered production licence 758 (‘Rosslyng’), with 
EnQuest as the operator and having a 35% interest. EnQuest 
was also offered licence 760 (‘Chinook’), with Total as the 
operator, both Total and EnQuest having a 50% interest each. 
In both cases, the work commitments in the initial two year 
period entail 3D seismic licensing and reprocessing. 
In Q2 2013, EnQuest agreed its first acquisition of 
international producing assets, acquiring 70% and 
operatorship of the Didon oil field in Tunisia; including 2 
MMboe of net 2P producing oil reserves in Didon, along with 
over 40 MMboe of net contingent resources in the Zarat field. 
With an initial consideration of US$23 million on completion, 
this represents another low cost entry point into a new 
region, with the potential for a development of the Zarat field 
and possibly also the nearby Elyssa field. Completion of this 
transaction is expected in H2 2014. 
Building on this first move into North Africa, EnQuest has 
also made a small investment in a 50% interest in the North 
West October appraisal block in Egypt, with the possibility of 
a future development opportunity; the consideration is 
refundable if a development does not proceed.

Acquisitions and disposals
UK North Sea
In January 2013, EnQuest agreed the acquisition of an 8% 
interest in the Alba oil field, including 5.9 MMboe of net 2P 
reserves, as at the economic date of 1 January 2012. Alba 
also brings EnQuest additional experience relevant to the 
development and operation of the Kraken field. The 
transaction completed in March 2013.
In H1 2013, EnQuest negotiated the farm out of a total of 55% 
of its previous 100% interest in the Cairngorm basement oil 
discovery. EnQuest received a promoted carry on the 
Cairngorm appraisal well, this transaction completed in 
August 2013 and an appraisal well is currently being drilled. 
In August 2013, EnQuest announced it had farmed into a 50% 
interest in the Avalon prospect. This is located close to the 
Scolty and Crathes discoveries, in each of which EnQuest has 
a 40% interest. An EnQuest operated exploration well is to 
be drilled on Avalon in 2014. 
In Q4 2013, EnQuest announced an agreement to acquire 
50% of the Greater Kittiwake Area assets, along with a 100% 
interest in the Kittiwake to Forties oil export pipeline. This 
gives EnQuest increased production and additional net 2P 
reserves of 4.7 MMboe, as at the economic date of 1 January 
2013. We see significant potential to improve production 
both through infill drilling and through exploring further 
prospects in the area. With Scolty, Crathes and Avalon all 
nearby and the possibility of a tie-back to Kittiwake, this 
acquisition creates the potential for a substantial new 
EnQuest hub and for an extension to the field life of GKA.  19

Financial performance
In 2013, EnQuest generated strong EBITDA of $621.3 million. 
EnQuest is in a strong financial position, having recently put  
in place a new credit facility, for up to $1.7 billion; providing 
capacity both for our current projects and for new 
opportunities. 2013 year end net debt of $381.1 million, 
compares to a $89.9 million net cash position at the end of 
2012 and reflects EnQuest’s increased investment programme.
In total, unit operating costs of $35.5 per barrel were on 
target; reflecting a good operational performance and good 
control of direct costs, although transportation costs were up 
due mainly to an increase in the costs per barrel at the Sullom 
Voe oil terminal in the Shetland Islands. Within the total, unit 
production costs of $27.2 per barrel were flat compared to the 
$27.4 per barrel equivalent costs incurred in 2012.
2014 so far
In Q1 2014, EnQuest was offered an ‘out of round’ licence (‘Don 
NE’) in the Don North East area for blocks 211/18e and 211/19c, 
including the Area 23 and Area 24 discovered oil accumulations 
and an undrilled extension to the Don NE field, in the same 
area as Don Southwest and West Don. This is a natural fit for 
EnQuest, providing new production opportunities and utilising 
existing infrastructure in the Don fields.
The Cairngorm appraisal well has recently reached its target, 
with indications of hydrocarbons in a relatively good quality 
basement reservoir.
Outlook for the rest of 2014 and beyond
Production performance has been good in 2014 so far, despite 
severe winter weather conditions. Average production for the 
full year 2014 is anticipated to be between 25,000 Boepd and 
30,000 Boepd, excluding production from uncompleted 
transactions. EnQuest plans to deliver over 15 wells in 2014. 
The drilling programme includes a new production well  
on Don Southwest, a production well workover on GKA,  
an ongoing intervention programme on Thistle, three 
production wells and one injection well on Alma/Galia and 
the recommencement of drilling on Heather for the first time 
since 2006, with two sidetracks and two workovers. Also, two 
production wells are planned for the non-operated Alba field.
The 2014 exploration and appraisal well drilling programme 
includes Cairngorm, Kraken and Avalon in the UK. 
Internationally, in H2 2014, a non-operated well is being 
matured for drilling in the Sabah area, offshore Malaysia. 
The drilling on Alma/Galia and the completion work on  
the EnQuest Producer will be followed by the anticipated 
start-up of production in the second half of 2014, revitalising 
the first field to produce oil in the UK North Sea, almost 
40 years after it initially came onstream. We are now moving 
ahead on the Kraken development, with the FPSO vessel  
for Kraken due to arrive in the yard in Q2 2014, for the 
commencement of its conversion programme.
With production from Alma/Galia due to start this year and 
Kraken scheduled to produce first oil by 2017, EnQuest’s 
already sanctioned development projects are set to deliver  
a material increase in production to around 50,000 Boepd.

Progress within the social housing sector 
has been pleasing and there are now over 
50 registered social landlords trialling the 
VPhase product. 2011 orders include 
Stockport Homes with a 1,200 unit order 
and City South Manchester Housing Trust 
with a 980 unit order which British Gas 
Community Energy (“BGCE”) is installing.
Other routes to market are also being 
developed and our product will shortly be 
available on the Tesco Home Energy 
website via Enact Energy.
The Group’s focus on converting its 
pipeline to sales intensified as the year 
progressed with over 35% of the total 
sales volume occurring in the last quarter 
of 2011. At the end of the year the Group 
had orders worth £178,000. 
We continue to lobby for inclusion in the UK 
Government’s Green Deal programme and 
have gained the support of some utilities 
and other organisations in this regard.
We have announced the extension of our 
product range with the introduction of our 
premium priced and light commercial 
products. This includes a modular 
distribution board offering, making it even 
quicker and more cost effective to fit a 
VPhase unit and widening significantly the 
number of properties where a VPhase can 
be fitted. These products will be available 
for sale from the beginning of the third 
quarter of 2012.
During 201 1, the Group saw sales grow 65% to 
£440,000, and demand for our product continues to 
grow steadily. As we start 2012, our monthly run rate 
continues to increase and our pipeline of potential 
business has strengthened further.

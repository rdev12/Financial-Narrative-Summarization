 Our strategy is to improve and develop
our two principal activities, Packaging 
and Office Products Wholesaling. 
We are improving operational performance
across the Group through better products, a
more competitive cost base, increased efficiency
and raised service levels for our customers.
We are developing the Group’s strong 
market positions through organic development
and acquisitions, focusing particularly on
opportunities in our existing markets.

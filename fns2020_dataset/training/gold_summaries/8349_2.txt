“Our 2003 results were broadly in line with expectations and reflect a satisfactory
performance in our core activities, achieved in conjunction with the implementation of
planned management changes and the withdrawal from non-core businesses. These actions,
taken under our new Chief Executive and Finance Director, will improve the quality of the
Group’s earnings and will do much to strengthen our platform for future growth. 
“We saw an increase in the pace at which contracts are being secured across the business.
With £1.7 billion of new work won in the period our future workload now stands at a record
level of £4.3 billion and firmly underpins our position going forward.”
Mike Bottjer 
Chairman

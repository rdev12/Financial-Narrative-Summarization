Phil White | Chairman
I am pleased to report good results for Kier Group 
plc for the year to 30 June 2008. Revenue was up 
11.6% to £2,374.2m (2007: £2,127.9m); underlying 
profits before tax and exceptional items grew 12.2% 
to £87.1m (2007: £77.6m) and underlying earnings 
per share before the amortisation of intangible assets 
and exceptional items increased by 10.0% to 174.8p 
(2007: 158.9p).

The market for our housing business has been 
tough with 18.6% fewer sales achieved this 
year compared with last year and a continuing 
deterioration in reservation levels. We have 
responded to reduced demand by restructuring the 
Homes division from five administrative centres 
to one with the regrettable but necessary 60% 
reduction in Homes staff numbers. This has resulted 
in one-off reorganisation and restructuring costs 
of £9.5m partially offsetting the profit arising from 
the sale of the Hairmyres Hospital PFI investment 
of £16.2m during the year. In addition, we have 
reviewed the carrying value of residential and 
commercial land and work in progress at 30 June 
2008 in the light of current market conditions 
and have written those values down by a total of 
£31.3m; £26.6m in Homes and £4.7m in Property.
Cash, one of our key measures particularly within 
the Construction division, has been strong. Net cash 
inflow from Group operating activities was £56.6m 
(2007: £114.8m) leading to year-end net cash 
balances of £143.9m (2007: £148.4m).
We have experienced strong order intake leading 
to record year-end combined order books for 
Construction and Support Services of £3.7bn 
(2007: £3.5bn). Our Homes division is experiencing 
a continued reduction in reservations with order 
books at 31 August 2008 at about half of last 
year’s levels.
The Board proposes a 10% increase in the total 
dividend for the year to 55p (2007: 50p). The final 
dividend of 37p will be paid on 28 November 2008 
to shareholders on the register on 26 September 
2008 and there will be a scrip dividend alternative.
Board changes
Dick Side, who joined the Board in January 2003 as 
managing director of Kier Regional, will be retiring 
from the Board and the Group at the Company’s 
annual general meeting in November 2008. Dick 
has served Kier with great distinction for over 25 
years and his experience and knowledge have 
contributed greatly to our business. On behalf 
of the Board I would like to thank Dick for his 
contribution and wish him well in his retirement;  
he will be greatly missed by us all.

Paul Sheffield, who has been deputy managing 
director of Kier Regional since October 2005, will 
assume responsibility for all of our Construction 
activities following the annual general meeting. 
Other changes in responsibilities have taken effect 
from 1 July 2008. Ian Lawson, managing director 
of Kier Support Services also took responsibility 
for our Homes business embracing both private 
housing and our Partnership Homes business. Dick 
Simkin, managing director of Kier Property has also 
taken responsibility for our PFI business together 
with a new business stream, Kier Asset Partnership 
Services, established to focus on local authority 
asset management and development.
These changes have been implemented to reflect 
changes to our business structure designed to  
bring our operations closer together.
Finally I should like to thank Peter Warry, who 
retired as chairman of the Board in December  
2007, for his contribution during his ten years with 
the business and particularly the last three years  
as chairman.

Prospects
The advantages of our spread of operations and 
product diversification coupled with the quality and 
commercial capability of our staff will continue to 
provide stability in the current environment. Clearly 
2009 is going to be a challenging year but we have 
a strong balance sheet, good cash resources and 
healthy order books and I am confident that Kier 
will respond positively to our changing markets as 
we enter 2009.

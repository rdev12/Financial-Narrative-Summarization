in acquiring and developing other gold projects  
in the prospective Arabian-Nubian Shield.  25
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
The report contains certain forward-looking statements 
and attention is drawn to the cautionary statement that 
appears at the front of this document. 
OVERVIEW
Centamin is a mining company that has been actively 
exploring in Egypt since 1995. The principal asset of 
Centamin is its interest in the Sukari Gold Mine, located 
in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Sukari Gold Mine 
commenced construction in March 2007 with the ﬁrst 
gold bar being produced on 26 June 2009. Sukari is the 
ﬁrst modern large-scale mine in Egypt, a country which 
in ancient times was a proliﬁc gold producer.
Optimal design throughput at the Sukari Gold Mine 
was achieved during December 2012 and the ‘Stage 4’ 
expansion program commenced in 2011 to target  
450-500,000 production per annum from 2015. 
Centamin’s operating experience in Egypt gives it  
a signiﬁcant ﬁrst-mover advantage in acquiring and 
developing other gold projects in the prospective 
Arabian-Nubian Shield. 
ACCOUNTING FOR SUKARI GOLD MINES
The operating company of Sukari, Sukari Gold Mines 
(“SGM”), is jointly owned by Pharaoh Gold Mines NL 
(“PGM”) and the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority 
(“EMRA”) on a 50% equal basis. For accounting 
purposes, SGM is 100% proportional consolidated 
within the Centamin group of companies reﬂecting the 
substance and economic reality of the Concession. 
Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, the provisions 
of which are described more fully below, PGM 
solely funds SGMs activities. PGM is also entitled to 
recover the following costs and expenses payable 
from sales revenue (excluding the royalty payable to 
the Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”)) (a) all current 
operating expenses incurred and paid after the 
initial commercial production; (b) exploration costs, 
including those accumulated to the commencement of 
commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of total 
accumulated cost per annum); and (c) exploitation 
capital costs, including those accumulated prior to the 
commencement of commercial production (at the rate  
of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum).
Since the commencement of commercial production  
on 1 April 2010, the cash ﬂows generated by SGM 
through the sale of gold are used to fund the on-going 
operating expenses incurred in its own right and to fund 
the cost recovery due to PGM for exploration  
and exploitation capital costs at a rate of 33.3%  
of total accumulated cost per annum. 
In return, on-going capital expenditure incurred  
in connection with the Sukari mine is funded solely  
by PGM out of cash ﬂows received from SGM through 
the cost recovery process as described above.  
The expenditure incurred by PGM in relation to Stage 4 
will become recoverable once the infrastructure has 
been commissioned, which is currently planned at the 
end of 2013, at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated 
cost per annum.
EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM’s net production 
surplus “proﬁt share” (deﬁned as revenue less payment 
of the 3% production royalty to ARE and recoverable 
costs). Based on the Company’s calculation there was  
no Net Proﬁt Share due to EMRA as at 30 June 2012,  
nor is any likely to be due as at 30 June 2013. It is 
expected that there will be a net production surplus 
(revenue in excess of production royalty and cost 
recoveries) available for sharing between EMRA and 
PGM for the SGM ﬁnancial year ending 30 June 2014 
(SGM’s accounting period is 1 July to 30 June) based  
on current gold prices, production forecasts and 
operating expenses. Any disruption to operations or 
reduction in gold price realised will delay this proﬁt 
sharing. This expected proﬁt sharing takes into account 
the costs incurred on paying for fuel at international 
prices. Any recovery of these prepayments, discussed in 
Note 20 to the Financial Statements, will result in further 
amounts to be shared between EMRA and PGM. Any 
payment made to EMRA pursuant to these provisions 
of the Concession Agreement will be recognised as a 
variable charge to the income statement of Centamin, 
which will lead to a reduction in the earnings per share.
Following discussions with EMRA, and with a view to 
demonstrating goodwill toward the Egyptian government, 
subsequent to year end, PGM has made an advance 
payment in relation to this likely 2014 proﬁt share to 
the value of US$8.2 million and this advance payment 
will be netted off against any future proﬁt share that 
becomes payable.
Separate accounts are prepared in respect of SGM. 
These are independently audited and certiﬁed by 
Egyptian certiﬁed accountants approved by EMRA. 
Any expected proﬁt share payable to EMRA and PGM 
becomes payable on completion of the audit of the 
SGM accounts. Centamin will be working together with 
EMRA to ensure that these can be approved as soon as 
possible so that the proﬁt share can be paid to EMRA 
and PGM. Centamin is looking forward to paying the ﬁrst 
proﬁt share to EMRA. 26 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE YEAR
(1) (2) (3) 
Centamin delivered strong operational and ﬁnancial 
results in 2012, producing 262,828 ounces of gold 
(2011: 202,699 ounces) and generating proﬁt after tax 
for the year of US$199 million (2011: US$194.0 million). 
Through the Group’s emphasis on rigorous cost control, 
Centamin has continued to reap the beneﬁts of the 
high gold price, and this was enhanced further by its 
debt-free and unhedged position. Now in its third year 
of production, the Sukari Gold Mine is highly cash 
generative, providing EBITDA of US$233.3 million (2011: 
US$211.4 million), a 10% increase on 2011, and a robust 
cash and cash equivalents balance of US$147.1 million 
(2011: US$164.2 million) as at 31 December 2012.  
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for the 
deﬁnition of EBITDA.
2012 presented some operating environment challenges, 
however a solid second quarter and a record fourth 
quarter of production have shown that a substantially 
larger production proﬁle is achievable for Sukari.  
This potential for production growth combined with the 
Group’s reserves, a signiﬁcant expansion programme,  
a solid ﬁnancial position, and an experienced team 
means Centamin is well positioned for 2013, as is shown 
by the following:
 Basic earnings per share 18.27 cents, up 2%  
on prior year.
 Record EBITDA $233.3 million, up 10%  
on the prior year.
 Full year production was 262,828 ounces,  
a 30% increase on 2011 and above guidance  
of 250,000 ounces.
 Cash costs of production of US$669 per ounce 
(equivalent to US$530 per ounce versus US$556  
per ounce in 2011 at subsidized fuel prices).
 Stage 4 plant expansion (to 10Mtpa) commissioning 
activities began in Q1 2013 with the new power 
station commissioned in January 2013 and new 
blowers and compressors to be commissioned  
in Q2 2013. The bulk of commissioning will 
commence, and be complete, in the second half of 
2013. Expenditure to date is US$228.5 million of the 
total forecast US$325 million including contingency.
 Centamin remains debt-free and unhedged with cash, 
bullion on hand, gold sales receivable and available-
for-sale ﬁnancial assets of US$219.4 million as at 
31 December 2012.
 Drilling continued at the V-Shear porphyry and 
commenced at the Kurdeman prospect. 
 A gravity survey, aimed at targeting and deﬁning 
porphyries beneath the wadi sediments was 
completed late in 2012 with results due in Q2 2013.
 Results in Ethiopia conﬁrm the existence of low grade 
mineralisation, with drilling continuing.
During the year Centamin was involved in two separate 
court cases directly relevant to the operation of the  
mine at Sukari. The ﬁrst of these was triggered by  
a decision taken by the Egyptian General Petroleum 
Company (EGPC) to charge international prices,  
not local (subsidised) prices for the supply of Diesel 
Fuel Oil (“DFO”). The second case saw a judgment 
by an Egyptian Administrative Court in relation to the 
validity of the Company’s 160km
2
 exploitation lease, 
although on 20 March 2013 the Supreme Administrative 
Court upheld the Company’s application to suspend 
this decision until the merits of the Company’s appeal 
are considered and ruled on, thus providing assurance 
that normal operations would be able to continue during 
this process. Both of these cases are described in 
detail elsewhere in this report (refer to Note 20 to the 
Financial Statements). Every action is being taken to 
contest the decisions, including the making of formal 
legal appeals and, although their resolution may take 
some time, we remain conﬁdent that a satisfactory 
outcome will ultimately be achieved. With respect to 
the DFO case, management however recognises the 
practical difﬁculties associated with re-claiming funds 
from the government and, for this reason, have fully 
provided against the prepayment of US$41.4 million 
as an exceptional item (refer to Note 6 to the Financial 
Statements). In the meantime the Group is continuing  
to pay international prices for DFO.
In addition the Group during the year received  
a demand from Chevron for the repayment of fuel 
subsidies received in the period from late 2009 through 
to January 2012, amounting to some US$60 million 
(EGP403 million). No provision has been made in respect 
of the historic subsidies prior to January 2012 as, based 
on legal advice that it has received to date, the Company 
believes that the prospects of a court ﬁnding in its favour 
in relation to this matter remain strong.
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review
(1) Cash cost of Production, EBITDA and cash, bullion on hand and available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are non-GAAP measures. For further information  
and a detailed reconciliation, please see ”Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below.
(2) Basic EPS, EBITDA, Cash Costs of Production reported inclues an exceptional provision against prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal of fuel 
subsidies which occurred in January 2012 (refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further details). The provision had no impact on the 2011 results.
(3) Historic Cash Cost of Production, EBITDA and Basic EPS now reﬂect adoption of IFRIC 20 (refer to Note 3 of the Financial Statements for further details). 27

NR – Not Reported. 28 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Centamin produced 262,828 ounces of gold in 2012, 
which is a 30% increase on 202,699 ounces in 2011. 
The higher year-on-year production was a result of:  
(a) a 25% increase in tonnes milled (to 4.5Mt) due  
to the improved plant productivity and availability,  
(b) an 18% increase in production from the 
underground due to improved underground mining 
contractor equipment availability, and (c) a 7% higher 
feed grade to the mills (2.04g/t in 2012 compared to 
1.91g/t in 2011) as underground and open pit head 
grades increased in line with the budget.
Open Pit
The open pit delivered total material movement of 
25,108kt for the year, an increase of 18% on the prior 
year, although impacted by stoppages in December due 
to a temporary disruption to the fuel supply. 
Ore production from the open pit was 6.4Mt at 1.04g/t 
with an average head grade fed to the plant of 1.35g/t. 
The ROM ore stockpile balance increased by 1kt to 
722kt by the end of the year. Mining was primarily from 
the Stage 2 area, with the completion of Stage 2A and 
Stage 2B down to the 1040RL and 1016RL respectively. 
In Stage 3 development work progressed in the Gazelle 
area and the new face shovel commenced in the Eastern 
Hills area of Stage 3. 
Underground Mine
Ore production from the underground mine was 393kt. 
The ratio of ore from stoping versus development 
decreased during the year, with 52% of development ore 
(203kt) and 48% of stoping ore (190kt). Production from 
stoping was affected by the availability of the teleremote 
bogging system in quarters three and four, which was 
offset by increased ore deliveries from development  
as a result of an increased development effort. 
A total of 2,934.8m of diamond drilling was completed 
for both short-term stope deﬁnition and underground 
resource development, of which 2,532m were driven 
through ore. The project development total to date  
is 10,248m, of which 5,414m were through ore.
Development of the Ptah Decline had reached the 
position of the ﬁrst drill cuddy and was connected to the 
exhaust system by the end of 2012. The anticipated  
ﬁrst-phase capital cost of the Ptah Decline is 
US$18 million, with expenditure to date of US$17.5 
million, which will see the decline reach the ﬁrst ore 
blocks to be developed below the middle of Sukari Hill. 
It is expected that this initial development work will be 
complete in early 2013. 
Processing
The annual throughput in the Sukari plant was  
4.5Mt in 2012, a 25% increase on 2011 (3.6Mt). 
Industrial disputes affected availability during the ﬁrst 
and third quarters although the nameplate rate of 
5Mtpa was achieved in the second and fourth quarters. 
Productivity of the processing plant averaged 656tph  
for the year, 5% above the nameplate design rate of 
625tph, as the operations team continued to optimise 
availability and throughput.
Plant metallurgical recoveries were 86.0% in the year,  
a 1.0% increase on 2011. Tighter operational controls 
and improved circuit stability resulted in the recovery 
steadily increasing throughout the year. Whilst operational 
improvements continue to have some impact, recoveries 
are expected to remain consistent until the new carbon 
regeneration kiln is commissioned in 2013.
The dump leach operation produced 6,686oz in 2012,  
a 37% decrease from 2011. 
Fuel Costs
In light of the on-going dispute with the Egyptian 
Government regarding the price at which Diesel Fuel Oil 
is supplied to the mine at Sukari, it has been necessary 
since January 2012 to advance funds to our fuel supplier, 
Chevron, based on the international price for diesel. 
Management however have fully provided against the 
prepayment of US$41.4 million, as an exceptional item, 
during Q4. Refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for 
further details on the impact of this exceptional provision 
on the Group’s results for 2012. For comparative 
purposes, had these prepayments been expensed during 
the year, the fuel cost differential would have had the 
following impact on the cash costs: the cash costs for  
Q1 increased by US$108 to US$717 per ounce,  
Q2 increased by US$164 per ounce to US$729 per 
ounce, Q3 increased by US$185 to US$724 per ounce 
and Q4 increased by US$112 to US$558 per ounce. 
As noted previously, the Company has commenced 
proceedings in the Administrative Court in Egypt in 
relation to this matter.  The Company remains of the view 
that an instant move to international fuel prices is not a 
reasonable outcome and will look to recover any funds 
advanced thus far at the higher rate should the court 
proceedings be successfully concluded. Please refer 
to Note 20 to the Financial Statements and the most 
recently ﬁled Annual Information Form (‘AIF’) for  
further information.
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review 29
In addition the Group during the year received a demand 
from Chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies 
received in the period from late 2009 through to January 
2012, amounting to some US$60 million (EGP403 
million). No provision has been made in respect of the 
historic subsidies prior to January 2012 as, based  
on legal advice that it has received to date, the Company 
believes that the prospects of a court ﬁnding in its favour 
in relation to this matter remain strong.
STAGE 4 EXPANSION
Construction continued on Stage 4 of the process 
plant expansion, which commenced in late 2011, 
which will expand Sukari nameplate capacity from 
5Mtpa to 10Mtpa. The estimated capital cost of the 
Stage 4 expansion which is funded by PGM out of cost 
recoveries, is US$325 million including contingency, 
with expenditure to date of US$228.5 million. 
Some unforeseen delays have meant that commissioning 
of the plant is now expected to commence in the second 
half of 2013 (previously the bulk of commissioning was 
expected in Q2 2013) and be complete by year end. 
These delays have been caused by:
 strikes at Sukari, in some of the ports and at some  
of the local suppliers, and
 suspension of operations at Sukari due to lack  
of fuel and a temporary prohibition of gold exports, 
resulting in delays for critical path items, materials 
and services.
Main Plant
Detail engineering of the main plant is complete and 
85% of the mechanical equipment has now arrived 
on site. All major civil works have been completed, the 
erection of structural steel and installation of mechanical 
equipment is in progress. Procurement of electrical 
equipment, cables and instrumentation is proceeding 
and the piping contractor is mobilising to site. Installation 
of both sag and ball mills is in progress, however late 
arrival of structural steel is impacting on the schedule in 
this area. 
Power Station
The ﬁfth MAK engine has been installed, commissioned 
and is fully operational in the existing plant. The 
new Wartsila plant has been completed, load bank 
commissioned and is ready to operate, although the 
cables to the new plant still have to be installed. 
Sea Water Pipeline
Excavation of the trench for the new pipeline has 
been completed. Welding and installation of the 
pipe is continuing, approximately 50% is complete. 
Construction of the booster station is proceeding with 
most of the civil work completed. Delivery of the intake 
and booster pumps is scheduled to take place in April 
and May.
Tailings Storage Facility
Construction of the embankment is 100% complete and 
installation of the HDPE liner has commenced.
New Primary Crusher
Excavation has been completed and construction of the 
crusher building is 20% complete. Some delays with 
cement deliveries have been experienced due to diesel 
shortages in Egypt.
Capital Expenditure
A breakdown of the major cost areas up to  
31 December 2012 is as follows:
 Mining Equipment US$34.9 million
 Processing Plant US$115.5 million
 Power Plant US$43.5 million
Other US$34.6 million
 US$228.5 million
Major contributors to the payments made in 2012  
were as follows: 
 Mining Equipment US$28.9 million
 Processing Plant US$85.2 million
 Power Plant US$32.5 million
Other US$29.3 million
 US$ 175.9 million 30 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
EXPLORATION UPDATE
Sukari Hill
Centamin has resources (inclusive of production since 
30 September 2011) of 13.13 million ounces Measured 
and Indicated, and 2.3 million ounces Inferred, and 
reserves (inclusive of production since 31 December 
2011) of 10.1 million ounces. Underground drilling 
was progressively stepped-up during the year as new 
development provided improved access from below 
surface to test potential high grade extensions of the 
deposit. The ore body has not yet been closed off by 
drilling to the north, or at depth. Further exploration 
of the Sukari deposit will take place during 2013, 
predominantly from both the Amun and Ptah declines. 
We aim to provide an updated resource and reserve 
statement during the second half of 2013.
Regional Exploration
Geochemistry, reverse circulation and diamond drilling 
programmes have been underway on the Quartz Ridge 
and V-Shear prospects to the east and north-east of the 
hill respectively during 2012. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant signs of 
low grade porphyry away from Sukari Hill were identiﬁed 
at the V-Shear prospect. On-going drilling to the south at 
the Kurdeman prospect offers the potential to fast-track 
near surface high grade ore to supplement the existing 
production. Further regional drilling of the Sukari licence 
is planned for 2013. 
A gravity survey, aimed at targeting and deﬁning 
porphyries beneath the wadi sediments, was completed 
in late 2012 with results due in early 2013. 
Growth Beyond Sukari
Centamin continued exploration on its four tenements 
in northern Ethiopia where drilling commenced in 
the ﬁrst half of 2012. Results to date have conﬁrmed 
the presence of mineralisation and follow-up drilling 
continues.
We will continue to grow and diversify our asset base 
through targeted acquisitions in this region and beyond 
in the coming years.

Results of operations
The Group recorded net proﬁt before tax for the year ended 31 December 2012 of US$198.6 million  
(2011: US$194.0 million). The increase is driven by higher volumes of gold sold, higher gold prices obtained and 
lower costs due to management’s rigorous cost control offset by the inclusion of an exceptional provision against 
prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal of the fuel subsidy which occurred in January 2012  
(refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements). 32 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review 33
Revenue has increased by 25% to US$426.1 million, 
as a result of a 19% increase in gold sold to 254,959oz 
together with a 7% increase in the average gold price to 
US$1,667 per ounce. 
Cost of sales has increased by 58% to S$202.9 million, 
as a result of:
(a)  a 57% increase in mine production costs to 
US$176.7 million, primarily due to the inclusion 
of an exceptional provision in Q4 to reﬂect the 
removal of the fuel subsidy which occurred 
in January 2012 (including fuel subsidy mine 
production costs would have increased by 25% to 
US$140.1 million) and due to an increase in tonnes 
mined and milled,
(b)  a 91% increase in depreciation and amortisation 
from US$18.6 million to US$35.6 million, a 
result of an increase in the underlying capitalised 
preproduction costs and mine development 
properties offset by:
(c)  a US$9.4m credit for movement in production 
inventory a result of additions to stockpiles.
Finance income. The movements in ﬁnance income are 
in line with the movements in the Company’s available 
cash and term deposit amounts.
Other comprehensive income has decreased by 
US$1.2 million to a US$2.8 million loss.
Other operating costs increased by 30% to 
US$25.5 million, as a result of: 
(a)  a US$4.6 million increase in net foreign exchange 
movements, offset by the inclusion of the 2011 
executive bonuses,
(b)  a provision in relation to the 2012 executive and 
senior management bonuses, together with, 
amongst other matters,
(c)  additional costs associated with the new corporate 
head ofﬁce, costs associated with the re-domicile, 
the ongoing litigation, and the share of loss  
of Associate.

Current assets have increased by US$14.5 million  
to US$283 million, as a result of:
(a)  a US$22 million increase in inventory to 
US$94.6 million. Stores inventory has increased  
by US$12.6 million to US$71.8 million in 
preparation for the increase of the processing 
nameplate capacity from 5 to 10Mtpa by the end  
of 2013. Mining stockpiles and ore in circuit

(b)  self-funding of the stage 4 expansion amounting  
to a cash outﬂow of US$160.7 million.
Non-current assets have increased by US$223.8 million 
or 39% to US$802 million, as a result of:
(a)  exploration and evaluation assets have increased 
by US$14.6 million to US$45.7 million as a result 
of the drilling programs in Sukari Hill, the Sukari 
tenement area and Ethiopia, 
(b)  available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets have increased  
by US$3.8 million to US$5.6 million as a result 
of an acquisition via a placement of 67 million 
shares in Nyota at GB£0.06 (US$0.10) per share 
amounting to US$6.4 million offset by the loss  
on fair value of the investment and loss on foreign 
exchange movement of US$2.8 million and 
US$0.2 million respectively, and
(c)  a US$241.3 million increase in property, plant of 
equipment, mainly relating to the net capitalised 
work-in-progress costs of US$184.5 million, 
of which $175.9 million relates to the Stage 4 
processing plant development and US$8.6 million 
relates to additional mining equipment, together 
with a US$56.6 million increase in mine 
development properties, offset by:
(d)  a depreciation and amortisation charge of  
US$35.6 million.
Current liabilities have increased by US$33.9 million 
to US$59.6 million mainly driven by the rise in supply 
relating to higher production at the Group’s Sukari Gold 
Mine and an increase in the accruals in relation to the 
Stage 4 processing plant development, together with the 
provision in relation to the 2012 executive and senior 
management bonuses.
Non-current liabilities reported during the period have 
increased by US$2.9 million as a result of:
(a)  a US$2.7 million increase arising from a change  
in estimate of the future rehabilitation costs; and
(b)  the unwinding of the discount on the provision  
for rehabilitation.
Issued capital increased by US$3.9 million to 
US$612.5 million as a result of the issue of forfeited 
shares under the Loan Funded Share Plans (LFSP). 
Reserves reported have increased by US$1.5 million  
to US$3.5 million as result of the recognition of the 
share based payments.
Accumulated proﬁts increased by US$196.2 million 
as a result of the increase in the proﬁt for the year 
attributable to the shareholders of the Company of 
US$199 million offset by a US$2.8 million loss on 
available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets.
Current ratio is calculated by dividing the current assets 
by the current liabilities. The decrease in the current 
ratio is a result of the increase in current liabilities driven 
by the rise in supply relating to higher production at the 
Sukari Gold Mine and an increase in the accruals in 
relation to the Stage 4 plant expansion development.
The return on equity ratio is calculated by dividing the 
proﬁt for the year attributable to the shareholders of the 
company for the period (which includes an exceptional 
provision against prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect 
the removal of fuel subsidies which occurred in January 
2012) by total shareholders’ equity and measures the 
return on ownership. The return on equity ratio showed  
a decrease from 23 for 2011 to 20 for 2012 as a result 
of the increase in the shareholders equity.

Net cash ﬂows generated by operating activities comprise 
receipts from gold and silver sales and interest revenue, 
offset by operating and corporate administration costs. 
Cash ﬂows have increased by US$67.0 million to 
US$220.5 million, primarily attributable to:
(a)  an increase in revenue, due to higher gold sales 
volumes and a higher average realised price, and
(b)  an increase in cash ﬂows in relation to payables 
and prepayments, largely a result of the 
management of the settlement of trade payables  
in December 2012, both offset by

removal of fuel subsidies in January 2012  
and the payment of higher international fuel 
prices, and

receivables and inventories resulting from the 
ramping up of the Stage 4 processing plant 
development and the increase in stockpiles.
Net cash ﬂows used in investing activities comprise 
exploration expenditure and capital development 
expenditures at Sukari including the acquisition of 
ﬁnancial and mineral assets. Cash ﬂows have decreased 
by US$96 million to US$243.8 million. The primary use 
of the funds during the year was for investment in capital 
work-in-progress in relation to the Stage 4 development. 
In addition cash used in the purchase of available-for-

subsidies which occurred in January 2012 (refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further details).
The Company’s results over the past several quarters 
have been driven primarily by ﬂuctuations in gold price 
and increases in gold equivalent ounces produced. 
Additionally, increases in input costs and foreign 
exchange rates have impacted results.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, revenue increased to 
$138.5 million on gold equivalent ounces sold of 82,316 
compared with revenue of $84.5 million on sales of 
56,513 gold equivalent ounces during the fourth quarter 
of 2011. The average realized gold price per ounce in 
the fourth quarter of 2011 was $1,666 compared with 
the average realised gold price during this quarter of 
US$1,697 per ounce. 
Cost of sales increased by 111% to US$79.5 million  
in the ﬁnal quarter of 2012 versus US$37.6 million  
in the prior year, primarily as a result of the inclusion  
of an exceptional provision against prepayments 
recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal of the fuel subsidy 
which occurred in January 2012, together with higher 
input costs in areas such as energy and labour,  
as well as higher throughput.
Liquidity and capital resources
At 31 December 2012, the Group had cash and cash 
equivalents of US$147.1 million compared to US$164.2 
million at 31 December 2011. The majority of funds have 
been invested in short term deposits. The decrease in 
cash position is primarily due to the payments in relation 
to the Stage 4 processing plant development together 
with the inclusion of an exceptional provision against 
prepayments to reﬂect the removal of fuel subsidies offset 
with increased production and favourable gold prices. 
Centamin has a strong and ﬂexible ﬁnancial position 
with no debt, no hedging and cash, bullion, gold sales 
receivables and available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets of 
US$219.4 million at 31 December 2012. Cash, bullion, 
gold sales receivables and available-for-sale ﬁnancial 
assets is a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure and includes 
cash, bullion, gold sales receivable and available-for-sale 
ﬁnancial assets. 
Liquidity risk is the risk associated with not having 
access to sufﬁcient funds to meet planned and 
unplanned cash requirements. Centamin manages its 
exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating 
and strategic liquidity levels are well above minimum 
company requirements.
In the day to day business, the Group receives cash from 
its operations and is required to fund working capital and 
capital expenditure requirements. The cash is managed 
to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise 
returns while ensuring that capital is safeguarded to the 
maximum extent possible by investing only with ﬁnancial 
institutions with a strong credit rating. 
The Group’s primary source of liquidity is operating cash 
ﬂow. The principal risk factor affecting operating cash 
ﬂow is cost, gold prices, timing of gold sales and the 
legal actions in relation to the Concession Agreement 
and Diesel Fuel matters.
The Group’s ﬁnancial commitments are limited 
to planned and discretionary spending on work 
programmes at the Sukari Gold Mine, planned and 
discretionary spending on work programmes at the 
exploration licences owned by Sheba, administration 
expenditure at the Egyptian, Australian and London 
ofﬁce locations and for general working capital purposes.
Management considers that the Group has adequate 
current assets and forecast cash ﬂow from operations  
to manage liquidity risks arising from settlement of 
current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
We had no debt for both the 2012 and the 2011 period.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, 
ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, 
which are described in Note 3 of the Notes to the 
Financial Statements, management is required to 
make judgments, estimates, and assumptions about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
which form the basis of making the judgments. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised if the revision affects only that period or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgments that 
management has made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies and that have the most 
signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
Financial Statements:
Litigation
The Group is currently a party to two legal actions both 
of which could affect its ability to operate the mine at 
Sukari in the manner in which it is currently operated 
and adversely affect its proﬁtability. The details of this 
litigation, which relate to the loss of the Egyptian national 
subsidy for Diesel Fuel Oil and the ability of the Group 
to operate outside the area of 3km
2
 determined by the 
Administrative Court of ﬁrst instance to be the area of 
the Sukari exploitation lease, are available in Note 20 
to the Financial Statements and in the most recently  
ﬁled Annual Information Form (‘AIF’) which is available 
on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.  Although it is possible  
to quantify the effects of the loss the national fuel 
subsidy, it is not currently possible to quantify with 
sufﬁcient precision the effect of restricting operations  
to an area of 3km
2
. 
Every action is being taken to contest these decisions, 
including the making of formal legal appeals and, 
although their resolution may take some time, 
management remain conﬁdent that a satisfactory 
outcome will ultimately be achieved. In the meantime, 
however, the Group is continuing to pay international 
prices for Diesel Fuel Oil. With respect to the 
Administrative Court ruling, on 20 March 2013 the 
Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Company’s 
application to suspend this decision until the merits of 
the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus 
providing assurance that normal operations would be 
able to continue during this process.
Recovery of Capitalised Exploration Evaluation 
and Development Expenditure
The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and 
evaluation expenditure results in exploration and 
evaluation expenditure being capitalised for those 
projects where such expenditure is considered likely to 
be recoverable through future extraction activity or sale or 
where the exploration activities have not reached a stage 
which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence 
of reserves. This policy requires management to make 
certain estimates and assumptions as to future events 
and circumstances, in particular whether the Group will 
proceed with development based on existence of reserves 
or whether an economically viable extraction operation 
can be established. Such estimates and assumptions 
may change from period to period as new information 
becomes available. If, subsequent to the exploration and 
evaluation expenditure being capitalised, a judgment 
is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely or 
the project is to be abandoned, the relevant capitalised 
amount will be written off to the income statement. 38 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Accounting treatment of Sukari Gold Mines (SGM)
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin Group 
of companies, reﬂecting the substance and economic 
reality of the Concession Agreement (see Note 23 of the 
Financial Statements).
The following are the key assumptions concerning the 
future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty 
at the reporting date, that have a signiﬁcant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year:
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs
The Group is required to decommission, rehabilitate and 
restore mines and processing sites at the end of their 
producing lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant 
authorities. The provision has been calculated taking into 
account the estimated future obligations including the 
costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration 
and monitoring of the affected areas. The provision 
for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the 
present value of the expenditure required to settle the 
restoration obligation at the reporting date.
Ore reserve estimates
Estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include 
assumptions on commodity prices, exchange rates, 
discount rates and production costs for future cashﬂows. 
It also involves assessment and judgment of difﬁcult 
geological models. The economic, geological and technical 
factors used to estimate ore reserves may change 
from period to period. Changes in ore reserves affect 
the carrying values of mine properties, property, plant 
and equipment, provision for rehabilitation assets and 
deferred taxes. Ore reserves are integral to the amount of 
depreciation and amortisation charged to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and the calculation of inventory.
Production forecasts from the underground mine at 
Sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future 
resource and reserve growth. It is the opinion of 
management and Directors that these estimates are both 
realistic and conservative, based on current information. 
However, as the mine relies on continued deeper 
development and exploration drilling for further reserve 
deﬁnition, the life of this part of the mine remains limited 
and there is a risk that some or all of this growth will 
not materialise with a consequent negative impact on 
current production forecasts.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group changed its accounting policy on production-
phase stripping costs with effect from 1 January 2012. 
As a result, the 2011 results have been restated. Refer 
to Note 3 of the Financial Statements for further details. 
There have been no further changes to the Group’s 
accounting policies during the year. 
GOING CONCERN STATEMENT
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in this business review. The ﬁnancial 
position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, liquidity position  
and borrowing facilities are also described in this 
business review above. In addition, Note 26 of the 
Financial Statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital;  
its ﬁnancial risk management objectives; details of its 
ﬁnancial instruments; and its exposure to credit risk  
and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in Note 26 of the Financial Statements, 
the Group meets its day to day working capital 
requirements through cash generated by its operations. 
The current economic conditions create uncertainty 
particularly over a) the level of demand of the Group’s 
products; b) the price at which its products can be sold; 
and c) the price at which its main raw materials can  
be procured. 
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account 
of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
show that Group should be able to continue generating 
sufﬁcient cash in order to ﬁnance its operations and 
capital expansions. 
As discussed elsewhere in this document, during the 
year the operation of the mine was affected by two legal 
actions. The ﬁrst of these followed from a decision taken 
by EGPC to charge international, not local (subsidised) 
prices for the supply of Diesel Fuel Oil, and the second 
arose as a result of judgment of an Administrative Court 
of ﬁrst instance in relation to, amongst other matters, the 
Company’s 160km
2
 exploitation lease. In relation to the 
ﬁrst decision, the Company remains conﬁdent that in the 
event that it is required to continue to pay international 
prices, the mine at Sukari will remain commercially viable. 
Similarly, the Company remains conﬁdent that the appeal it 
has lodged in relation to the decision of the Administrative 
Court will ultimately be successful, although ﬁnal 
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review 39
resolution of it may take some time. On 20 March 2013 
the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Company’s 
application to suspend the decision until the merits of 
the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus 
providing assurance that normal operations would be able 
to continue during this process.
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful  
in either or both of its legal actions, and that the 
operating activities are restricted to a reduced area,  
it is the Directors’ belief that the Group will be able  
to continue as going concern.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting  
in preparing the Annual Financial Statements.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
Three non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures are used  
in this report:
1)  EBITDA: “EBITDA” is a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure, 
which excludes the following from proﬁt before tax:
 Finance costs;
 Finance income; and
 Depreciation and amortisation.
Management believes that EBITDA is a valuable 
indicator of the Group’s ability to generate liquidity 
by producing operating cash ﬂow to fund working 
capital needs and fund capital expenditures. 
EBITDA is also frequently used by investors and 
analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA 
is multiplied by a factor or “EBITDA multiple” that 
is based on an observed or inferred relationship 
between EBITDA and market values to determine 
the approximate total enterprise value of a company. 
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information 
to investors and analysts and does not have any 
standardized deﬁnition under IFRS and should 
not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for 
measures of performance prepared in accordance 
with IFRS. EBITDA excludes the impact of cash costs 
and income of ﬁnancing activities and taxes, and 
therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating 
proﬁt or cash ﬂow from operations as determined 
under IFRS. Other companies may calculate 
EBITDA differently. The following table provides 
a reconciliation of EBITDA to proﬁt for the year 
attributable to the Company.

2)  Cash Cost per Ounce Calculation: “Cash costs per ounce” is a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Cash Cost per 
ounce is a measure of the average cost of producing an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing the operating costs 
in a period by the total gold production over the same period. Operating costs represent total operating costs less 
administrative expenses, royalties, depreciation and amortization. Management uses this measure internally to better 
assess performance trends for the Company as a whole. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional 
measures prepared in accordance with GAAP , certain investors use such non-GAAP information to evaluate the 
Company’s performance and ability to generate cash ﬂow. The Company believes that these measures provide 
an alternative reﬂection of the Group’s performance for the current period and are an alternative indication of its 
expected performance in future periods. Cash costs is intended to provide additional information, does not have any 
standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures 
of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP . This measure is not necessarily indicative of operating proﬁt or 
cash ﬂow from operations as determined under GAAP . Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

INTERNAL CONTROLS
Financial reporting controls and procedures are 
designed to provide reasonable assurance that all 
relevant information is gathered and reported to 
management, including the CEO, CFO and COO,  
on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions can 
be made regarding public disclosure. Management, 
with the participation of the certifying ofﬁcers, has 
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation, 
as of 31 December 2012, of the Company’s disclosure 
controls and procedures (as deﬁned by the Canadian 
Securities Administrators). Based on that evaluation,  
the certifying ofﬁcers have concluded that such 
disclosure controls and procedures are effective and 
designed to ensure that material information relating  
to the Company and its subsidiaries is made known  
to them by others within those entities. 
Internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting are designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of our ﬁnancial reporting and compliance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in our Financial 
Statements. Management  evaluated at implementation 
the design of internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting and 
has concluded that such internal controls over ﬁnancial 
reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the 
preparation of Financial Statements for external purposes 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the European Union  
(‘EU IFRS’). In addition, there have been no changes  
in the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting 
during the year ended 31 December 2012 that have 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially 
affect, its internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
At 31 December 2012, the Group has exposure to 
interest rate risk which is limited to the ﬂoating market 
rate for cash.
The Group does not have foreign currency risk for 
non-monetary assets and liabilities of the Egyptian 
operations as these are deemed to have a functional 
currency of United States dollars. The Group has 
no signiﬁcant monetary foreign currency assets and 
liabilities apart from Australian dollar and United States 
dollar cash term deposits.
The Group currently does not engage in any hedging or 
derivative transactions to manage interest rate or foreign 
currency risks.
FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN EGYPT
Foreign investments in the petroleum and mining sectors 
in Egypt are governed by individual production sharing 
agreements (concession agreements) between foreign 
companies and the Ministry for Petroleum and Mineral 
Resources or the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority 
(“EMRA”) (as the case may be) and are individual Acts of 
Parliament.
Title, exploitation and development rights to the 
Sukari Gold Mine are granted under the terms of the 
Concession Agreement promulgated as Law No. 222  
of 1994, signed on 29 January 1995 and effective from 
13 June 1995. The Concession Agreement was issued 
by way of Presidential Decree after the approval of the 
People’s Assembly in accordance with the Egyptian 
Constitution and Law No. 61 of 1958. The Concession 
Agreement was issued in accordance with the Egyptian 
Mines and Quarries Law No. 86 of 1956 which allows for 
the Ministry to grant the right to parties to explore and 
mine for minerals in Egypt.
Whilst the Company is the ﬁrst foreign company to 
develop a modern large-scale gold mine in Egypt there 
is signiﬁcant foreign investment in the petroleum sector. 
Several large multinational oil and gas companies 
operate successfully in Egypt, some of which have long 
histories in the country and have dedicated signiﬁcant 
amounts of capital. The Company believes that the 
successful track record of foreign investment established 
by these companies in the petroleum sector is an 
important indication of the ability of foreign companies to 
attract ﬁnancing and receive development approvals for 
the construction of major mining projects in Egypt.
Egyptian Court Litigation 
As discussed elsewhere in this document the Company 
was involved in two separate actions. The ﬁrst followed 
from a decision taken by EGPC to charge international, 
not local prices (subsidised), prices for the supply of 
Diesel Fuel Oil, and the second arose as a result of 
judgment of an Administrative Court of ﬁrst instance  
in Cairo in relation to the Company’s 160km
2
  
exploitation lease. 42 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Concession Agreement Court case
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Courts in Egypt 
handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by, 
amongst others, an independent member of the previous 
parliament, in which he argued for the nulliﬁcation of the 
agreement that confers on the Group rights to operate 
in Egypt. This agreement, the Concession Agreement, 
was entered into between the Arab Republic of Egypt, 
the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority (“EMRA”) and 
Centamin’s wholly owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines 
(“PGM”), and was approved by the People’s Assembly as 
Law 222 of 1994.
In summary that judgment states that, although the 
Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, 
sufﬁcient evidence had not been submitted to Court 
in order to demonstrate that the 160km
2
 “exploitation 
lease” between PGM and EMRA had received approval 
from the relevant Minister as required by the terms of 
the Concession Agreement. Accordingly, the Court 
found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 
160km
2
 was not valid although it stated that there was 
in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km
2
. 
Centamin, however, is in possession of the executed 
original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 
160km
2
 exploitation lease was approved by the Minister 
of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It appears that an 
executed original document was not supplied to the Court. 
Upon notiﬁcation of the judgment the Group took various 
steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine 
at Sukari. These included both lodging a formal appeal 
before the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 November 
2012 and, in the ﬁrst instance, lodging an “Objection  
to Enforcement in respect of” the original ruling with the 
Civil Court on 31 October 2012, which had the effect of 
“staying” (postponing) implementation for an initial period.  
In addition, in conjunction with the formal appeal the 
Group applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to 
suspend the initial decision until such time as the Court 
is able to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. 
On 20 March 2013 the Court upheld this application thus 
suspending the initial decision and providing assurance 
that normal operations will be able to continue whilst the 
appeal process is underway. 
EMRA lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 
27 November 2012, the day after the Company’s appeal 
was lodged. Furthermore, in late December 2012, the 
Minister of Petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and 
shortly thereafter publicly indicated that, in his view, 
the terms of the Concession Agreement were fair and 
that the exploitation lease was valid. The Minister of 
Petroleum also expressed support for the investment and 
expertise that Centamin brings to the country. We believe 
this demonstrates the government’s commitment to our 
investment at Sukari and the desire to stimulate further 
investment in the Egyptian mining industry.
We do not yet know when the appeal will conclude, 
although are aware of the potential for the process in 
Egypt to be lengthy. The Company has taken extensive 
legal advice on the merits of its appeal from two leading 
Egyptian law ﬁrms who have conﬁrmed that the proper 
steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km
2
 
exploitation lease. We therefore remain of the view that the 
appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will ultimately 
be successful. In the event that the appellate court fails to 
be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the 
Group, the operations at Sukari may be adversely effected 
to the extent that the companies operation exceeded the 
exploitation lease area of 3km
2
 referred to in the original 
court decision.
The Company remains conﬁdent that normal operations  
at Sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal process  
is underway.
Further details about this litigation are set out in Note 20 
to the Financial Statements and in the most recently ﬁled 
Annual Information Form (‘AIF’) which is available on 
SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Diesel Fuel Court Case
In January 2012 the Group received a letter from 
Chevron to the effect that Chevron would not be able 
to continue supplying Diesel Fuel Oil (DFO) to the 
mine at Sukari at local subsidised prices, thereby 
adding approximately US$150 per ounce to the cost 
of production. It is understood that the reason that this 
letter was issued was that Chevron had received  
a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General 
Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). Subsequent to this 
ﬁrst letter, the Group received a demand from Egyptian 
General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) for LE403 
million (US$60 million) being the amount of the subsidy 
received in respect of the diesel fuel supplied from 
December 2009 until January 2012.
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter 
and in consequence in June lodged an appeal against 
EGPC’s decision in the Administrative Courts. Again, the 
Group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong  
and that there is good prospect of success. However, 
as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the 
continuation of supply, the Group has since January 
advanced funds to our fuel supplier, Chevron, based 
on the international price for fuel. Further details about 
this litigation are set out in Note 20 to the Financial 
Statements and in the most recently ﬁled AIF which  
is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review 43
OVERVIEW OF SUKARI CONCESSION 
AGREEMENT
Pharaoh Gold Mines NL (“PGM”) a 100% wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Company, EGSMA (now “EMRA”) and 
the Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) entered into the 
Concession Agreement dated 29 January 1995, granting 
PGM and EMRA the right to explore, develop, mine and 
sell gold and associated minerals in speciﬁc concession 
areas located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt identiﬁed in 
the Concession Agreement. The Concession Agreement 
came into effect under Egyptian law on 13 June 1995.
A summary of the main terms of the Concession 
Agreement is as follows:
 PGM provides funding to the Operating Company, 
Sukari Gold Mining Company, (SGM) and is 
responsible for the day-to-day management  
of that company.
 PGM is entitled to recover: 
 - all current operating expenses incurred and paid 
after the initial commercial production;
 - exploration costs, including those accumulated to 
the commencement of commercial production  
(at the rate of 33.3% per annum); and
 - exploitation capital costs, including those 
accumulated prior to the commencement  
of commercial production (at the rate of  
33.3% per annum).
 The ARE is entitled to a royalty of 3% of net sales 
revenue from the sale of gold and associated minerals 
from the Sukari Gold Mine.
 Commencing on the date of commercial production, 
PGM is entitled to a 15 year exemption from any taxes 
imposed by the Egyptian government, with an option 
to extend this entitlement for further 15 years. 
 After the deduction of recoverable expenses and the 
payment of the 3% royalty, the proﬁts are shared 
equally between PGM and EMRA (with an additional 
10% of proceeds paid to PGM in the ﬁrst 2 years that 
there are net proceeds and an additional 5% in the 
following 2 years).
 PGM, EMRA and the Operating Company are 
exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect 
to the importation of machinery, equipment and 
consumable items required for the purpose of 
exploration and mining activities at Sukari. 
 PGM, EMRA, the Operating Company and their 
respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or 
taxes on the export of gold and associated minerals 
produced from the Sukari Gold Mine.
In addition, the Concession Agreement establishes 
a procedure for the conversion of any exploration 
lease granted in favour of PGM into an exploitation 
lease. Upon following the procedure prescribed by the 
Concession Agreement, the Company was granted such 
an exploitation lease in respect of 160km
2
 in 2005 and 
is in possession of the original document granting this 
lease duly signed by all relevant parties. The validity 
of this lease is, however, the subject of the litigation 
referred to above.
For the accounting treatment of the Concession 
Agreement refer to Note 23 of the Financial Statements. 44 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
PRINCIPAL RISKS AFFECTING THE CENTAMIN GROUP
The Group faces a variety of risks which could adversely affect its performance, earnings, ﬁnancial position and 
prospects. In addition, there may be additional risks unknown to Centamin and other risks, which are currently believed 
to be immaterial and could turn out to be material. These risks, whether they materialise individually or simultaneously, 
could signiﬁcantly affect the group’s business and ﬁnancial results. In addition, Centamin could also be affected by 
risks relating to the gold mining industry generally and the risks and hazards involved in the business of mining metals, 
which are largely outside its control.
It is for this reason that the Group conducted a variety of risk assessments throughout the year as part of its normal 
business performance and operational reviews, the results of which have been considered by the Audit and Risk 
Committee, and the Board, on a regular basis as required by the UK Code on Corporate Governance and relevant 
Canadian requirements. Centamin has taken a number of steps to mitigate some of these risks and will continue to 
evaluate ways in which it can manage and mitigate risks accordingly. Notwithstanding this, due to the very nature of 
risks no assurance can be given that mitigating actions taken or planned will be wholly effective.
A description of the key risks affecting the Company and the steps taken to mitigate them is set out in the table below. 
This table should be read in conjunction with the commentary under the heading “Concession Agreement Court case” 
which describes in detail the risks to the Group’s operations in Egypt raised by the judgment handed down on 30 October 
by the Administrative Court. 
RISK CATEGORY DESCRIPTION OF POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION / COMMENTARY
Single project 
dependency
 The Sukari Gold Mine currently 
constitutes all of the group’s 
mineral resources and reserves 
and the potential for the future 
generation of revenue (with the 
exception of the group’s small 
exploration portfolio in Ethiopia). 
 Any adverse development 
affecting the progress of the 
Sukari Project could have a 
material and adverse effect 
on the group’s ﬁnancial 
performance and results.
 In order to ensure continued growth, the group has been 
active in identifying new resources and development 
opportunities through exploration and acquisition targets both 
inside and outside Egypt. 
 Centamin assesses and continues to assess a wide range of 
potential growth opportunities both within Egypt, the wider 
area of the Arabian-Nubian Shield and beyond. 
 Until further production growth beyond Sukari is delivered 
the risk remains high.

RISK CATEGORY DESCRIPTION OF POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION / COMMENTARY
Single country 
dependency
 All of the group’s operational 
revenue is derived from 
production in Egypt.
 Future policies regarding 
foreign development and 
ownership of mineral resources 
may change.
 The courts may interpret 
existing legislation in new ways. 
 Changes in government policy and/or law may affect both 
the group’s ability to undertake exploration, development 
and operational activities in respect of future properties as 
well as its ability to continue to explore, develop and operate 
those properties in respect of which it has obtained mineral 
exploration and exploitation rights to date. 
 Changes in policy in Egypt may result in changes in laws 
affecting ownership of assets, land tenure and mineral 
concessions, fuel subsidies, taxation, royalties, rates of 
exchange, environmental protection, labour relations, 
employment of expatriates, repatriation of income and 
return of capital.
 The current political situation in Egypt has not affected the 
safety of the Group’s employees or its day-to-day operations 
at its ﬂagship project, Sukari.
 Comments under “Litigation risk” also apply here.
 The Directors of the Group continue to monitor the situation 
and there are no matters to report outside of what is already 
publicly available.
 The actions with regard to the “Single project dependency” 
risk apply here.
 Until further production growth outside Egypt is delivered 
the risk remains high.
Operational risks Interruptions to normal 
operations and/or construction 
projects may be caused by 
a number of factors, such as 
late delivery of equipment and 
supplies, adverse weather, 
equipment failures, delays  
in obtaining/renewing permits. 
 Any failure or unavailability  
of operational infrastructure 
could adversely affect 
production output and/
or impact exploration and 
development activities. 
 Some of these factors (particularly delays to supplies, 
material and services) have led to short-term delays in the 
commissioning of the Stage 4 expansion at Sukari.
 Expansion projects at Sukari have been, and continue to 
be, self-funded out of operational cash ﬂow and the cost 
recovery process. The capital investment funding for the 
Stage 4 expansion is therefore to a large extent reliant on 
normal operations continuing. The temporary disruption to 
gold exports and fuel supply in late-2012 caused a shortage 
in working capital within SGM which caused some payment 
delays to suppliers and therefore some minor delays to the 
supply of materials, equipment and services to the project.
 The group’s mining, processing, development and 
exploration activities at Sukari depend on the continuous 
availability of its operational infrastructure, in addition to 
reliable utilities and water supplies and access to roads.
 Management assesses the critical components of the 
group’s operational infrastructure on a continuous basis and 
keep a large inventory of critical spares; however spares for 
some larger capital items are not kept and failure of such 
items could lead to production delays.
 Management closely monitors progress of both normal 
operations and expansion projects and has regular dialogue 
with all project stakeholders and suppliers. 
 The Board receives regular updates on developments.
 Operational risk for a mining project in a remote location 
is high.  46 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
RISK CATEGORY DESCRIPTION OF POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION / COMMENTARY
External risks The current Egyptian political 
situation may affect the safety 
of the group’s employees and/
or adversely affect the group’s 
ability to operate the Sukari 
Gold Mine.
 Civil unrest, war, ﬁghting, 
terrorism or similar events in 
Egypt, Ethiopia or elsewhere 
could adversely affect 
operations.
 Management closely monitors events external to its normal 
operations in all countries in which it operates.
 The current political situation in Egypt has not to date had 
any signiﬁcant effect the safety of the Group’s employees 
or its day-to-day operations at Sukari nor has it had 
any material adverse impact on the group’s investment, 
though the value of the Company’s shares may have been 
adversely affected.
 There have been disruptions to the domestic, subsidised 
fuel supply throughout Egypt which has affected some of 
our suppliers and has contributed towards delays in the 
completion of the Stage 4 expansion project. To date the 
supply of diesel for normal operations, which is priced and 
supplied on an international basis, has not been affected.
 Future disruptions due to external factors are likely,  
but to date have only had a moderate impact.
Political, legal 
and regulatory 
risks
 Changes to existing law and 
regulations, or more stringent 
application or interpretation of 
current laws and regulations 
by relevant government 
authorities, could adversely 
affect the group’s operations 
and development projects.
 Operations may be affected by government regulations 
with respect to production, price controls, export controls, 
income taxes, expropriation of property, maintenance of 
claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of 
local people, water use and safety regulations on adverse 
judicial rulings. 
 Exports of gold from Sukari were temporarily disrupted in 
late-2012 due to a delay in securing the relevant approvals 
from the Egyptian customs authority, causing a temporary 
adverse impact on the working capital position of SGM.
 The group actively monitors legal and political developments 
in Egypt and Ethiopia and actively engages in dialogue with 
relevant government and legal policy makers to discuss all key 
legal and regulatory developments applicable to its operation 
environmental legislation.
 The potential for serious impact should be balanced 
against the Egyptian government’s support of the 
Company’s investment and contribution to both revenue  
and development of the mining industry.

RISK CATEGORY DESCRIPTION OF POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION / COMMENTARY
Relationship with 
EMRA
 A dispute with EMRA may 
adversely affect the group’s 
ability to manage the Sukari in 
the most effective way.
 A dispute may arise under the 
Sukari Concession Agreement 
regarding the cost recovery 
process and the level of Proﬁt 
Share due to EMRA.
 EMRA may pressure for more 
operational control at Sukari.
 The successful management of the Sukari Gold Mine is in 
part dependent on maintaining a good working relationship 
with EMRA.
 The group has regular meetings with ofﬁcials from EMRA 
and invests time in liaising with relevant ministry and 
other governmental representatives. Management and the 
Board of Directors believe the group has a positive and 
constructive working relationship with EMRA.
 The group complies with all terms and conditions of the 
Concession Agreement covering the Sukari Gold Mine.
 EMRA has equal representation on the Board of Sukari 
Gold Mines and is involved to that extent in approving and 
auditing all work programs and expenditures.
 EMRA inspectors are closely involved in monitoring all 
aspects of the Sukari operations.
 Current discussions with EMRA are focussed on 
determining the exact timing and quantum of the ﬁrst 
payment of Proﬁt Sharing for Sukari.
 Whilst the impact would be high, management believes 
there is a low probability of a material deterioration 
in relationships with EMRA, particularly following the 
prepayment in relation to future proﬁt share made 
subsequent to year end.
Government 
inexperience  
in mining
 Egypt has limited experience 
of modern large scale mining 
operations.
 Current laws do not reﬂect 
current mining practices.
 The Company has ‘ﬁrst mover’ status in Egypt, with Sukari 
being the ﬁrst and only modern mine in the country.  
This, however, means that many of the laws, permitting/
licencing procedures and general bureaucracy in relation 
to mining are under-developed relative to those in other 
countries with a more advanced mining industry.
 Management regularly engage in dialogue with all levels  
of government with regard to the challenges that this  
general level of inexperience in dealing with the mining 
industry presents.
 The Company has a solid track record of overcoming 
challenges caused by government inexperience, despite 
occasional impacts on production. For example, the Sukari 
mine operates, with a high degree of efﬁciency, under  
what management considers excessive restrictions  
on blasting activities.
 The Egyptian government has stated publicly that it intends 
to support and assist in the development of the country’s 
mining industry.
 The Company is currently in discussion with EMRA and 
other government departments in relation to securing 
the permissions and supply of ammonium nitrate (AN) 
necessary for open pit mining rates to increase to the 
required level as dictated by the current mine plan.
 The potential for serious impact is balanced by the 
Egyptian government’s support of the Company’s 
investment and contribution to both revenue and

Monitoring of 
Concessions
 Inadvertent breach of the 
Concession Agreement 
 The agreement itself could 
be terminated by presidential 
decree or on public  
policy grounds
 The Concession Agreement between the Arab Republic of 
Egypt, the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority (“EMRA”) 
and Centamin’s wholly owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold 
Mines (“PGM”) was approved by the People’s Assembly as 
law 222 of 1994.
 The agreement imposes certain obligations on PGM and 
there is a risk that any failure by PGM to comply with 
any such obligation may constitute a material breach, 
regardless of actual operational signiﬁcance.
 The Company maintains a register of all its obligations 
under the Concession Agreement, and on a quarterly 
basis this is reviewed by a committee of the Board, and if 
necessary appropriate remedial action taken.
 Steps taken to mitigate this risk are a reviewed during the 
audit process of the Company’s accounts.
 Given the controls in place and the support of the Egyptian 
government, this risk is judged to be low.
Employees and 
contractors
 Industrial unrest may negatively 
impact on the group’s 
operations and production. 
 The loss of, or inability to 
source, skilled workers and 
professional labour may cause 
a medium-term threat to 
operations.
 The Group depends on 
certain key contractors and 
interruptions in contracted 
services could result in loss of 
production.
 Management believes its labour relations, with both 
employees and contractors are satisfactory. 
 Egyptian employment law affords extensive protection to 
employees and the group is committed to keeping the pay, 
beneﬁts, training and conditions for its Egyptian work force 
competitive. 
 A workers’ representative group has been established for 
the purpose of facilitating a better dialogue with those 
employed at the Sukari Gold Mine.
 However, strikes have occurred in the past at Sukari and 
there can be no assurance that a future work slowdown,  
a work stoppage or strike will not occur here or at any of the 
group’s other projects.
 The group’s business signiﬁcantly depends upon its ability 
to recruit and retain qualiﬁed personnel, in particular 
members of the senior management team and its skilled 
team of engineers and geologists.
 The group regularly assesses its staff recruitment and 
retention policies, including its reward structures and 
incentive plans, to assist with labour stability, and maintains 
appropriate investment in training and development to 
safeguard the skills of its work force. 
 Regular reviews are carried out in order to attract, retain and 
incentivise key employees, including the expatriate workforce.
 Assessments of arrangements with key contractors are 
undertaken on a regular basis to ensure that contracted 
services and support meet business requirements and 
expectations.
 Whilst the group and its underground and drilling sub-
contractors are actively training local Egyptians they rely 
also on expatriate workforce and visas for such expats.
 The risk of future disruptions within the work force remains 
elevated but the impacts are judged to be manageable.

Gold price The group’s ﬁnancial 
performance is highly 
dependent upon the price of 
gold, which is affected by a 
number of factors beyond the 
group’s control.
 Rapid ﬂuctuations in pricing of gold will have  
a corresponding impact on the ﬁnancial position.
 The group’s objective is to provide maximum exposure to 
the price of gold and, as such, a policy of not hedging gold 
has been adopted. 
 The group manages its exposure to gold price ﬂuctuations 
by retaining a focus on keeping operating costs as low as 
possible.
Litigation risks The Company’s ﬁnances, and 
its ability to operate in Egypt, 
may be severely adversely 
affected by current and any 
future litigation proceedings. 
 As discussed above, the Company is currently involved in 
litigation that relates both to a) the validity of its exploitation 
lease at Sukari; and b) the price at which can purchase 
Diesel Fuel Oil . 
 The Company has engaged appropriate legal advice and 
continues to actively pursue its legal rights with respect to 
the existing litigation.
 The Company and its legal advisors believe that the 
on-going appeals in relation to both of these cases will be 
successful, although this outcome cannot be guaranteed.
 It is possible that further litigation could be initiated against 
the Company at any time.
 Management and the Company’s legal advisors monitor 
both activity in court and local media for signs of any 
litigation that may threaten its operations, ﬁnances  
or prospects.
 The potential for serious impact should be balanced 
against the Company’s adherence to local laws and 
agreements, as well as the Egyptian government’s support 
of the Company’s investment. 50 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

Reserve and 
resource 
estimates
 Mineral reserves and resources 
are estimates based on a range 
of assumptions, including 
geological, metallurgical and 
technical factors.
 There can be no guarantee that 
the anticipated tonnages or 
grades will be achieved.
 Management has implemented processes to continuously 
monitor and evaluate the current life of the Sukari Gold 
Mine, mine plans and production targets. 
 The group’s resources and reserves are regularly reviewed 
and are presented in accordance with the 2004 Australian 
Code for the Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves (“JORC Code”) which provides an equivalent 
presentation to NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of 
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards  
(the “CIM Standards”).
 The nature of underground mining operations makes it 
difﬁcult to calculate resources in advance of expending 
money on development. As a consequence, underground 
reserves and resources are likely to remain low compared 
with the levels of expected production.
 Production forecasts from the underground mine at Sukari 
are partly based on estimates regarding future resource 
and reserve growth. It is the opinion of management 
and Directors that these estimates are both realistic and 
conservative, based on current information. However, 
as the mine relies on continued deeper development 
and exploration drilling for further reserve deﬁnition, the 
life of this part of the mine remains limited and there is 
a risk that some or all of this growth will not materialise 
with a consequent negative impact on current production 
forecasts.
 Whilst there are no certainties, production to date has 
provided conﬁdence in management’s estimation and mine 
planning methods. 
Health and safety Potential for fatalities and/or 
a signiﬁcant increase in the 
number of serious injuries at 
the mine to materially affect 
operations
 A signiﬁcant rise in the number 
of safety-related incidents could 
cause a deterioration of the 
Company’s relationship with its 
work force.
 The local safety culture in Egypt has been observed to be 
poor, with low standards of risk-awareness and familiarity 
with the risks associated with mining.
 There are active monitoring, communicating and reporting 
systems in place to assess the risk levels and appropriate 
courses of action.
 Safety induction and training programs for staff are an 
essential component of their duties.
 Sukari has a strong safety culture and a good track record 
with a LTIFR of 0.69 per 200,000 man hours in 2012, a 
strong improvement on 1.25 in 2011.
 The group manages effectively the risks to health and 
safety and so the risk is low.

The cost of 
self-generated 
electricity
 The cost of diesel fuel oil 
may ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly 
depending on market prices 
and the extent to which the 
group can continue to take 
advantage of the fuel subsidies 
currently offered by the ARE.
 The Sukari Gold Mine relies on self-generation  
by diesel power generators located on site.
 Since January 2012 the group has paid the full international 
price for its diesel supply in Egypt and does not beneﬁt 
from any government subsidies.
 Management is reviewing alternative energy sources of grid 
power and gas pipelines.
 The risk is low since the Sukari operation does not 
beneﬁt from subsidies and increases in market prices for 
oil products have historically been offset by concurrent 
increases in the gold price.
Environmental 
hazards and 
rehabilitation
 Environmental hazards may 
cause losses and costs, 
licences and permits to be 
withdrawn or suspended, 
or enforced clean-up and 
remediation action. 
 Any such action could have  
a material adverse effect on the 
group’s business, operations 
and ﬁnancial condition.
 Mining operations have inherent risks and liabilities 
associated with pollution of the environment and the 
disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral 
exploration and production.
 No signiﬁcant environmental incidents have occurred to 
date at any of the Company’s projects.
 Laws and regulations involving the protection and 
remediation of the environment and the governmental 
policies for implementation of such laws and regulations 
are constantly changing and are generally becoming more 
restrictive. 
 The Directors believe that the group is in compliance in all 
material respects with applicable environmental laws and 
regulations and holds all necessary approvals, licences and 
permits under those laws.
 Compliance with these standards is monitored  
by the HSES committee. 
 Remediation and rehabilitation costs are assessed and 
reviewed on at least an annual basis.
 Given the monitoring and control procedures  
in place, whilst the impact of an incident would be 
material, the risk of occurrence is judged to be low.
Community 
relations
 A failure to adequately engage 
or manage relations with local 
communities and stakeholders 
could have a direct impact  
on the group’s ability to operate 
at Sukari.
 In addition to its existing corporate social responsibility 
programmes, the group is implementing a number 
of additional initiatives to improve and build on local 
community relations, and has increased its social 
management capacity. 52 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

Strategic report
Silence Therapeutics at a glance
Highlights
•	 Established new mRNA capability 
with mRNA delivery producing 
therapeutic levels of protein in 
pre‑clinical in vivo animal models
•	 Delivery progress with DACC delivery 
system achieving knockdown of 
target genes in the lung vascular 
endothelium of non‑human 
primates (NHPs)
•	 Completed Phase 2a safety trial 
using Atu027 in combination with 
gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer, 
follow up data due in 2016
•	 Fundraising in April 2015 to raise 
£40m gross proceeds to further 
develop RNA platform
•	 Early interim analysis of Phase 2a 
trial of Atu027 in pancreatic cancer 
shows positive signals
•	 European Patent Office upheld key 
RNAi trigger modification patent 
against challenges by four parties 
During the year Post year end events
•	 Collaborations with world leading 
research institutions to develop most 
promising drug candidates
•	 Internal algorithm for cost effective 
pre‑clinical drug development with 
clear go/no‑go milestones
•	 Continued to strengthen team with 
focus on industry experience
•	 Drug candidate Atu027 finished 
recruitment for Phase 2a clinical 
trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer 
during 2014, draft interim report 
shows early positive signals

®
 
well established with over 400 
patients dosed so far
•	 Phase 1b study of Atu027 in head 
and neck cancer planned for 2015
•	 Deliver both short interfering RNA 
(siRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA)
•	 Strong potential with other payloads 
including microRNA and gene editing 
tools such as CRISPR/CAS9
•	 New mRNA technology replaces 
gene expression where it is missing
•	 mRNA delivery produces therapeutic 
levels of protein in pre‑clinical in vivo 
animal models
•	 Potential to be used in genetic 
deficiencies, vaccines and 
infectious diseases
•	 Patented RNA interference (RNAi) 
platform, known as AtuRNAi
®
•	 Proprietary modifications to improve 
the robustness of RNA sequences

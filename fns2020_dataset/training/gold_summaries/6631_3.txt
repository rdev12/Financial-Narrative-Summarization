Chairman’s Statement
www.glisten.plc.co.uk
This is our sixth year as an AIM listed Company and it is with great
pleasure that I announce another record year of turnover and profits
for our Company. This year has seen strong progress in a number of
areas the most notable of which are:
 Significant evolution of our product offering. 
 The successful launch and relaunch of a number of new and
existing branded products.
 Continuing strong operational cash generation and improving
operational efficiency.
 Strengthening of our senior management team with a number 
of key appointments.
 The completion of two acquisitions in the autumn taking us into
savoury snacks for the first time.
 The management and absorption of raw material and utility 
cost increases.
Results
During the year to June 2008 Glisten plc achieved revenue up 
26% to £73.8m (2007: £58.6m) and on a like-for-like basis up 11%.
EBITDA before exceptional items increased by 18% to £9.9m 
(2007: £8.3m) and our pre-exceptional operating profits (see note 5)
were ahead by 21% to £8.0m (2007: £6.6m). Profit before tax and
exceptional items increased by 18% to £6.68m (2007: £5.66m).
Both adjusted basic earnings (note 10) and adjusted diluted 
earnings per share rose by 15% to 35.2p (2007: 30.5p) and 34.1p
(2007: 29.7p) respectively. 
Dividend
The Board is pleased to recommend the payment of a final dividend
for the year ended June 2008 of 1.15 pence (2007: 1.1 pence) per
ordinary share, making 2.25 pence (2007: 2.1 pence) for the year, 
an increase of 7%. It is our intention to grow the dividend distribution
sensibly going forward. If approved, the final dividend will be paid 
on 5 December 2008 to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 7 November 2008.
Management and Board
Our management style continues to place the emphasis on
leadership and innovation within a framework of robust cost 
and capital control. We encourage new ideas in all areas of our
operations, test them, evaluate and implement quickly where there
are clear benefits. We promote an incentive culture, thus rewarding
success and encouraging those who deliver and challenge.
We aim to be a good neighbour in the areas of the country where
our businesses are located, helping to create a stable prosperous
local economy in which our business can grow while supporting
sensible Corporate and Social Responsibility (CSR) and
environmental initiatives.
Over the course of the year we have expanded the role of our
Remuneration Committee to encompass the appointment of Board
members and senior staff within Glisten plc. We believe it is
appropriate for a Company of our size to bring the responsibility of
the Nominations and Remuneration Committees under one umbrella
chaired by Angela Megson.
Shareholders and Share Price
Our private shareholder base has increased in number by around
2% to 779 shareholders (2007: 765). It is the Board’s intention to
communicate fully with all shareholders, current and future, and in 
so doing continue to build awareness and understanding of Glisten.
This has been a difficult year for shareholders as the credit crunch
and inflation concerns have hit confidence across world stock
markets. This has been particularly visible on AIM where our share
price has fallen nearly 40% during a year in which we have improved
adjusted earnings per share by 15%.

Staff
We really value the contribution of our 694 people, including those
who have joined us during the year, and we wish to thank them for
their continuing hard work and enthusiasm. This year particularly 
has thrown us a number of major challenges and these results are
evidence of the huge energy and ingenuity that our team
demonstrates continuously. 
Outlook
We have another ambitious plan for the year ahead and remain
excited about the prospects for the business. The first nine weeks 
of the current year has started with overall sales ahead 15% whilst
showing no like-for-like growth. With a number of new listings in 
all parts of the Group we look forward to this year with optimism in
spite of the challenging economic climate. In summary, we remain
confident that our portfolio of branded and own label product across
the snacking and impulse market leaves us well placed for
continuing growth.

 Chief Executive’s review LTG Technologies PLC
Report and Accounts 2003

Albert Klein Chief Executive
Despite these difficulties our Group
companies have done relatively well. 
The LTG Mailänder division has
delivered underlying sales growth
of 9% and returned to profitability with
an operating margin of 4%. Costs have
been controlled: Gross margins are
up to 28.6% versus 25.2% in 2002,
overheads have been contained
at £11.0m versus £10.3m during the
prior year (at constant exchange rates),
resulting in operating profits of £1.8m
(at constant exchange rates) (versus
£Nil in 2002). This was due to a strong
performance in our conventional
equipment business where demand
converted into orders and sales orders
for Sprint technology obtained in 2002
were completed.
Imagelinx has achieved sales growth
of 16% at constant exchange rates
despite some existing clients spending
less, due in large to the economic
downturn. This demonstrates Imagelinx’s
ability to gain new clients and expand
its business. We are proud to have
started working with Procter & Gamble
Haircare, Uniq, Sara Lee, DuPont,
Lactalis, Boots Retail and Arla. 
Imagelinx is now involved in the
marketing of a range of products
spanning from baby milk to Paul Bocuse
ready-to-eat meals and from Nice‘n’Easy
hair colorants to Mach3 shaving blades.
There is plenty of scope to sell our
services for products in the spectrum
between these. 
We have reduced costs at Imagelinx
to be more in line with sales. We
Chief Executive’s
review
no longer have to incur the high
expansion costs of the last two years
and we have curtailed projects which
did not offer the prospects of profits
within a reasonable time frame.
We may return to them in time.
By reviewing our sales network and
by working with suppliers who offer
better value for money to Icon, overall
operating costs have been reduced by
25% at constant exchange rates. As
a result Imagelinx has seen its operating
losses before operating exceptional
items and goodwill substantially reduced
to £3.1m (at constant exchange rates)
from £6.3m in 2002. We have also
written off £5.6m of prior year’s
expenditure for Icon to reflect our
cautious view of these IT investments
and terminations of contracts
with suppliers. 
Significant achievements, operational
changes and corporate developments
At the operating level, several key
developments have taken place
in our Group during 2003. 
In LTG Mailänder major Sprint
equipment contracts have been
completed and delivered to customers
in Europe, the Far East and Central
America, such as the Dae Sung
in Korea, Kian Joo in Malaysia, and
Grupo Zapata in Mexico. Typically
these systems cost between €3m
and €5m. Some of these installations
are now the most productive
metal printing operations in the
world with astounding operating
performance. These installations
are showcases for the efficiency
of Sprint printing technology and
will allow us to further push the sale
of this technology. 
LTG Mailänder has launched a new
coating system under the Sprint brand
name. This reduces set-up times by up
to 50% and offers significantly higher
speeds and reduced coating material
usage. The system can be used both

Overview
In 2003, the business environment
has been anything but easy. In Asia,
a key market for LTG Mailänder’s Sprint
high technology printing machines,
we experienced the effects of the SARS
crisis through to September 2003.
This disrupted business activity and
confidence in the Far East quite severely,
restricting the flow of new orders for
Sprint machines. Overall the strong
Euro made customers outside the EU
think twice before signing on the
dotted line. 
In the US, Imagelinx’s clients, due to
the uncertain economic environment,
reduced expenditure wherever possible.
Sales of Imagelinx to existing clients
were down significantly. On top of this,
half of Imagelinx’s sales were affected
by the declining US Dollar.

of what we have to deal with as a result

Chief Executive’s review
with UV and with conventional drying
technology, so supporting Sprint and
conventional sales. We believe this
product will make a substantial
contribution to sales in the near future. 
LTG Mailänder has also largely
completed the introduction of
an integrated manufacturing planning
and inventory management system
allowing major efficiency gains in the
future. The system has already led
to much more accurate cost control
and improved timely and cost effective
manufacturing. Further improvements
are expected to flow from this system.
Imagelinx has introduced a Print
Certification Database (“PSD”) – an
advanced print quality data management
system. The system allows the capture
and administration of information on
printing presses around the world on-line
and replaces Imagelinx’s current system
for that purpose. It is the first of a series
of modules to be launched under the
name Icon. It is the basis of Imagelinx’s
capability to deliver top quality digital
packaging graphics information
globally, for large organisations. 
Major global brand managers have
expressed strong interest in the Icon
technology. As a result, £1.5m of capital
was raised in January 2004 in order
to complete the technology ahead
of schedule and make it available
to clients earlier.
This focus of Imagelinx upon the major
consumer product groups in the USA
and Europe, servicing clients out of key
operations in the USA and UK, has
allowed the closure of sales operations
in Germany, Japan and Italy.
We have also reviewed all major areas
of activity and expenditure in the
holding Company, LTG Technologies
PLC. An example of this review resulted
in the move of the listing to AIM. 
Funding and cash flow of the Group
On 26 February 2003 the Company
discounted a receivable due on
24 August 2003 from International
Thermo Systems LLC with a nominal
value of $3.141m (£1.995m at that
date) for the sum of $2.909m (£1.811m)
of which $1.884m (£1.197m) was used
to repay bank debt. This receivable
related to deferred consideration from
the sale of the Industrial Ovens division
in 2000.
On 18 March 2003 the Company
disposed of its interest in the business
activities of LTG Gateshead Limited
(formerly Crabtree of Gateshead
Limited) for a cash consideration
of £2.2m (£2.051m after expenses).
The Group experienced a net cash
outflow in 2003 of £4.2m resulting
in a net indebtedness position at the
31 December 2003 of £6.1m (2002:
£1.7m). This net outflow of £4.2m
represents total outflows from operations
of £8.1m, before the receipt of funds
from the disposal of Crabtree and early
receipt on the ITS loan note totalling
£3.9m. The early discount of the
ITS loan note was also used to reduce
the facility with LBBW from €10m
to €8.25m.
Group financial performance
The following table shows the financial performance of the divisions consolidated
into the Group’s results:

The cash outflow from operating
activities (operating loss before
tax adding back depreciation,
goodwill amortisation and the write
down of capitalised assets) in 2003
was £1.4m. Capital expenditure,
principally Icon development was
£2.2m, interest, tax and financing
was £0.5m and the adverse
movement in working capital was
£4.0m. The large adverse movement
in working capital, arose due to
the high level of cash held at the end
of 2002, resulting from large down
payments received on contracts
awarded in December 2002. 
In December 2003 we announced the
placing of 11.5m shares, providing the
Group with £1.5m of capital for the
completion of the Icon technology. These
proceeds were received in January 2004. 
Looking ahead
For the current year we are optimistic.
LTG Mailänder can contain costs
by focussing on efficiency improvements
rather than on headcount reductions
as in the past. When exchange rates
stabilise Asian demand for Sprint
technology should transpire into orders.
In the meantime, our conventional
business underpins sales. 
Imagelinx should see further sales
growth on the basis of its business with
existing and new clients. Its cost base
has been reduced. The Icon project
is approaching completion and will soon
offer large clients significant benefits
not available from other suppliers
in our markets.
There are four key strategic objectives,
which the Group will continue to focus
upon, all of which confirm our
competitive advantage.
● Deliver the Icon technology
– the recent placing of shares
providing £1.5m of capital will
enable the early completion of
this technology. This integrated
system will offer clients significant
advantages, allowing them to
monitor and influence the progress
of their projects. A new product
launch can then be monitored
and amended on line as it is being
finalised, without the need to
maintain costly in house brand
management functions. Future
investments in this system will be
made in line with the requirements
of our clients and their willingness
to fund tailored developments.
● Grow the Imagelinx client base
– new client acquisition remains
strong. It is our intention to continue
to provide high levels of client service
and to provide clients with the
leading edge technology that they
are demanding. The Icon technology
will provide this. 
● Continue to provide Imagelinx
clients with high levels of service
– increasing sales and adding value
to our existing clients. In 2003 we
experienced variations in demand
for our services over the year, with
high and low levels of activity. It is
very important we maintain high
levels of customer support and be able
to respond to our client’s demands.
The development and completion of Icon
will provide us with a platform to expand
our business.

Chief Executive’s review
Hence it is necessary to carry capacity
during low periods of activity. We
have scaled back infrastructure, but
retained capacity to meet customer
demand. There are signs that this
bold customer focus will pay off
as activity begins to rise again. 
● Maintain leading market position in
Sprint and conventional equipment
– LTG Mailänder is the market
leader in the supply of metal sheet
decorating equipment. It delivers
high specification equipment
worldwide, resulting from high
quality manufacturing capability.
This provides LTG Mailänder with
a strong competitive advantage
in this market place. 
The sales prospects for both divisions
are strong. The development and
completion of Icon will provide us with
a platform to expand our business in
the changing world of print technology.
Imagelinx is continually increasing its
client base and attracting new customers,
with its service offering and unique
technology platform. We anticipate
that this will lead to the accelerated
acquisition of new clients and eventually
expansion of existing business with
Imagelinx. An increase in sales for
Imagelinx together with effective
management of the cost base will 
lead to a continued improvement of
Imagelinx’s operating result.
For LTG Mailänder we are seeing
returns on our investment in the new
Sprint technology, despite the difficult
external market. Interest in SprintSystem
equipment is strong with a very high
number of enquiries being handled. We
are in a good position to maintain and
in time increase our market leadership.
Management and staff
In response to the move to AIM and
the relative size of the Group, the main
Board of LTG Technologies PLC has
been restructured. We will adhere
to best practice in terms of corporate
governance. The Board now has four
full time Executive Directors and four
Non-executive Directors. 
This year enormous efforts and
commitment have been required from
employees across the Group, in order
to make the LTG Mailänder division
profitable, and to consolidate a platform
for growth in the Imagelinx division.
We therefore thank everyone in the
Group for their efforts in the year.

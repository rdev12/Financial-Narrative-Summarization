Fuel
We use a range of fuels, including 
coal, sustainable biomass and others, 
for example, petcoke and pond 
fines, which can be economically 
advantageous. When our biomass 
transformation completes we will 
burn predominantly sustainable 
biomass. In the US we are investing in 
wood pellet plants and a port facility 
to deliver a secure and reliable wood 
pellet supply to meet some of our 
biomass needs.

From the Chairman 
Dear
shareholder
I am delighted to introduce the Annual 
Report on 2011, which has been a very 
successful year for your Company. While 
economic uncertainty continues, our 
operating environment improved during 
2011. Our results for the year are driven 
by revenue growth, an improved operating 
margin, and growth in market share  
due to our successful brands, enhanced 
by the roll-out of product and  
packaging innovations. 
Market share growth 
Overall, industry volumes continued to 
decline in 2011 but there are signs that 
the rate of decline has moderated. Our 
own volumes were down marginally by 
0.4 per cent and we grew market share 
during the year. These positive results 
were spread across many markets  
around the world. 
The expansion of illicit trade is a 
continuing and growing threat to the 
business. Sharp increases in excise duty, 
pressure on consumers’ disposable 
income, and ill-considered regulation of 
our industry, are all making life easier and 
more lucrative for traders of illicit products, 
both contraband and counterfeit. 
Increasing returns
to shareholders 
Using constant currency exchange rates, 
revenue rose by 7 per cent on an organic 
basis. Adjusted profit from operations 
grew by 11 per cent to £5,519 million,  
or by 10 per cent at constant currency 
exchange rates. 
This is reflected in adjusted diluted earnings 
per share for 2011 improving by 11 per 
cent to 194.6p. 
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 88.4p per share, which will 
be paid on 3 May 2012 to shareholders 
on the register at 9 March 2012. This 
takes the total dividend for the year to 
126.5p, an increase of 11 per cent on last 
year, and maintains our target of paying 
out 65 per cent of earnings in dividends. 
In addition, following the suspension  
of our share buy-back programme in 
2009, the Board approved the resumption 
of the programme in 2011. Between  
the beginning of March and the end  
of December 2011, some 28 million  
shares were repurchased at a value of 
£750 million, excluding transaction costs. 
A continuation of the share buy-back to  
a value of £1.25 billion has been agreed 
by the Board. 
2011 has been a  
very successful year 
for your Company
and we carry 
momentum in
market share
growth and margin 
improvement  
into 2012.   03

Board changes 
Ana Maria Llopis retired from the Board 
after the Annual General Meeting in April 
2011. Ann Godbehere, a Canadian, joined 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director on  
3 October 2011. Paul Adams, former Chief 
Executive, retired at the end of February 
2011 and was succeeded by Nicandro 
Durante who was introduced to 
shareholders in his new role at the AGM. 
Christine Morin-Postel resigned as a 
member of the Audit Committee with 
effect from 21 February 2012 due to a 
personal conflict of interest, details of 
which are set out in the corporate 
governance statement. 
Sustainability 
Over the years we have built a strong 
reputation for corporate social responsibility 
and sustainability and have been 
recognised as leaders in our industry.  
For example, we were the first tobacco 
company to be included in the Dow 
Jones Sustainability World Index and we 
were included again in 2011. This focus 
on running our business responsibly 
helps us create value for our shareholders 
as well as being in the best interests of 
our other stakeholders. 
 
Again this year, we publish our 
Sustainability Report alongside our 
Annual Report at the end of March. You 
will find a summary within this report 
that outlines the sustainability agenda we 
have been developing since 2007 and 
our progress against it in 2011. You can 
find more detail about this progress in 
our full Sustainability Report online at 
www.bat.com/sustainability. 
Continued success 
I express my thanks and appreciation  
to our Chief Executive, Nicandro Durante; 
to my fellow Directors on the Board; to 
management; and, in particular, to all 
our 56,000 colleagues around the world. 
2011 has been a very successful year for 
your Company and we carry momentum 
in market share growth and margin 
improvement into 2012. The economic 
climate around the world is far from 
settled but we remain confident that  
our strategy should continue to generate 
growth for our shareholders in the  
years ahead.

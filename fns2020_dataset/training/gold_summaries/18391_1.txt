STRATEGIC REPORT – CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Chief Executive’s review
Announcing record profit levels and our largest investment 
for eight years is testament to the strength of our strategy of 
building a diversified group and developing leading brands.
We have made good progress against this strategy, with net 
fee income growth across all of our regions and an improved 
conversion ratio, helping to reduce debt levels again, down 
below our target ratio of 25% ‘debt to debtors’. 
Our purchase of Pharmaceutical Strategies (‘PS’) opened 
up a new region in the USA, further diversifying the Group 
geographically and at the same time strengthening our 
presence in the healthcare sector. PS is expected to deliver 
a good uplift in profit into 2016, having integrated well into 
the Group and is operating in a high growth market sector 
with good long-term prospects.
Last year we presented our five year growth plan to 2018 and 
we have been pleased with our progress, with improvements 
made in all areas. We delivered a growth in net fee income 
of 10% despite unfavourable currency movements (16% in 
constant currency), an increase in the conversion ratio to 
16.3%, the fourth year of continued improvement and we 
reduced our ‘debt to debtors’ ratio from 32% to 23%, below 
our 25% target. This is important to enable to Group to take 
advantage of opportunities that arise and to be able to 
invest in the ongoing business. There is still more to be done 
but we believe we are on the right track and the Board is 
focused on making all of the targets a reality.
Organic growth is at the core of our business model and 
we have specific plans with each brand to develop them 
into leading brands in their sectors. However, to meet our 
long-term goals we also see the need to supplement our 
organic growth with external investments; to enter a new 
geography, increase our presence in an existing sector or as 
a bolt-on to an existing brand. We have an ongoing business 
development programme to identify suitable brands to join 
the group, where there is a fit of people and culture and 
where they meet our strategic priorities.
‘ Announcing record profit levels and 
our largest investment for eight years 
is testament to the strength of our 
strategy of building a diversified group 
and developing leading brands.’

PHARMACEUTICAL 
STRATEGIES
In October 2015 we acquired 100% of the 
Pharmaceutical Strategies Group (‘PS’), 
comprising Pharmaceutical Strategies LLC, 
Recruitment Strategies LLC, Medical  
Recruitment Strategies LLC and Recruitment 
Strategies Group LLC.
www.pharmaceuticalstrategies.com
The PS Group is based in Stoneham, 
Massachusetts, just outside Boston, 
from where it services clients across 
the whole of the USA with a team of 
19 staff. PS has a strong presence in 
the Pharmacy Benefit Management 
(‘PBM’) sector of the healthcare 
market. The PBM sector has seen 
rapid growth in recent years following 
the adoption of the Affordable Care 
Act, which is reforming the healthcare 
system by providing more Americans 
with affordable quality health 
insurance. The obamacarefacts.
com website identifies that 32 million 
Americans will be able to afford health 
care who could not get it before. 
Under the adoption of the Act 95% of 
Americans would be insured. In 2013 
over 15% were without insurance. The 
growth in the healthcare market is also 
being driven by an ageing population, 
increasing levels of obesity and the 
positive economic conditions over 
the last 5 years. These factors are 
forecast to drive increased demand for 
staffing in the healthcare sector into 
the mid-term.
PBM companies serve as the 
middlemen between insurance 
companies, pharmacies and 
manufacturers to secure lower drug 
costs for insurers and insurance 
companies. Since drug costs have 
been steadily increasing over the 
years, insurance companies have been 
relying more on PBM companies to 
control costs. The US Department of 
Health and Human Services projects 
growth in healthcare expenditure to 
average 5.8% per annum between 
2014 and 2024. The PBM companies 
collectively bring in almost $300 billion 
in revenues each year and engage 
more than 210 million Americans 
through their services (source: Wall 
Street Journal).
PS provides qualified pharmacists 
and pharmacist technicians to the 
PBM companies, primarily to assist 
in call centres dealing with questions 
from doctors and individuals about 
which drugs are available on specific 
client health plans or what would be 
available on a change of plan. They 
also provide pharmacists, pharmacist 
technicians, nurses, and other 
healthcare professionals to hospitals, 
speciality pharmacies, dispensing 
facilities, long-term care centres and 
in-home healthcare providers. 
PS currently provide temporary staff 
across the country and estimate that 
they have a relationship with 70% of 
the PBM market. 
PS represents a good strategic fit to 
Empresaria, by bolstering our presence 
in the high growth healthcare sector 
and further diversifying the Group 
geographically, with an entry into 
the US market. PS is a temporary 
recruitment business focused on 
professional and specialist roles, so 
is complementary to our focus of 
building a temporary recruitment bias 
and operational mix. In line with our 
management equity business model, 
the CEO of PS is remaining with the 
business and is tied in with second 
generation equity incentive.

STRATEGIC REPORT – CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
United Kingdom
Brands:
OVERVIEW
In the UK revenue declined by 5% due to the deliberate 
move away from low value work in the Technical & Industrial 
sector. The lower paid end of this sector has been heavily 
impacted by changes in legislation, with false self-
employment legislation implemented in April 2014 and new 
travel and subsistence rules in place from April 2016. Our 
approach to transition away from the generalist market 
and to increase our presence in professional and specialist 
roles has helped offset the impact of this to a certain 
extent, but there has been a short-term profit impact with 
a lower contribution from this sector in 2015. Excluding this 
sector there was revenue growth of 27%, with a particularly 
strong result from the Professional services area, helped 
by improved conditions in the banking sector and ongoing 
growth within the HR and Secretarial areas. We enjoyed 
a full contribution from Ball and Hoolahan, acquired in 
December 2014. This business has been successfully 
integrated into the Become group and we have clear plans to 
grow the brand’s presence across our network over the next 
few years. There were also positive performances from our 
brands in Domestic services and Retail (new house sales).
Net fee income grew by 16% to £18.4m (2014: £15.9m), 
however due to the move away from the lower paid end of 
the Technical & Industrial sector and the associated profit 
reduction, there was a reduction in conversion ratio. We also 
saw increased costs in the last quarter from three brands 
moving office. Whilst this has created space for future 
expansion there is an increase in rent costs and one-off 
moving costs. Overall there was an increase in average staff 
numbers of 27 with 224 in 2015 (2014: 197) as we continue to 
invest in the future growth.

Continental Europe
Brands:
OVERVIEW
Continental Europe again delivered strong growth in 
profit, up over 100% in the last two years. This is due to 
the Headway business in Germany and Austria, where 
revenue growth (14% in local currency) is coupled with a 
more appropriate cost base, to deliver growth in adjusted 
operating profit of 28% in local currency. The German 
economy has grown in 2015, business confidence remains 
positive and we expect this to continue in 2016.
Our healthcare business in Finland is making good progress 
with its move away from an import model (reliant on Estonian 
staff working in Finland) to a local model (growth coming 
from Finnish staff). Costs were removed with the closure of 
a physical presence in Estonia and whilst we will continue to 
place Estonian workers we expect the mix to be in favour of 
Finnish by the end of 2016. The local economic conditions 
remain weak but we are pleased with the progress being 
made by the management team.
Due to the weak performance of the Euro, currency rates 
have negatively impacted on the reported results for  
the region, with profit growth being £0.3m higher in  
constant currency.
In line with our strategy to exit businesses without strong 
growth prospects, we finalised the exit of our loss making 
GiT business operating in Czech Republic (disposal) and 
Slovakia (closed down).

OVERVIEW
Following investment in 2014, we have seen a marked 
improvement in profit in the year with the new offices all 
delivering improved contributions this year. There were mixed 
performances across the region, with the established markets 
in Japan and Australia both performing well, as well as good 
results coming in particular from Thailand, Chile and India.
In India, our Offshore Recruitment Services business has 
seen significant growth, with staff numbers at the end of the 
year up 65% on the prior year. The plan to open a third office 
in 2016 was brought forward due to high demand, opening 
in November 2015 so they now operate out of three offices 
in Ahmedabad. This business mainly services clients in the 
USA and UK, with a primary focus on the IT and Healthcare 
sectors in each respective market. We see good opportunities 
for continued growth in 2016.
We also now have a direct presence in the USA with the 
purchase of Pharmaceutical Strategies in October 2015. 
Based in Boston, Massachusetts, they supply qualified 
pharmacists to the high-growth healthcare sector. According 
to the US Department of Health and Humans Services, 
healthcare expenditure is expected to grow at an average 
rate of 5.8% between 2014 and 2024. This growth is driven by 
increased demand from the implementation of the Affordable 
Care Act, an ageing population, rising obesity levels and good 
economic conditions.
Market conditions in South East Asia and China have been 
mixed. In Indonesia we have seen business confidence 
dented by worsening economic conditions. Our Executive 
search business saw slightly lower profit levels and our 
training business has been restructured to reflect their 
lower sales level. The majority of this programme has been 
completed in the year and the management team has been 
strengthened so we expect a marked improvement in bottom 
line performance in 2016. In Thailand we have seen strong 
growth and there have been improved performances also 
in the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. China is going 
through a high profile rebalancing of their economy. We only 
have a small presence in China, which has been restructured 
and rebranded to the successful executive search brand 
Monroe Consulting. We see good prospects moving into 
2016, with a greater emphasis on Chinese clients rather than 
relying on multinational companies. 
In January 2015 we sold our small stand-alone brand in 
Malaysia to management. We now operate in that market 
through our established Monroe Consulting brand which is 
making good progress. Empresaria Group plc Annual Report 2015  STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The services provided to clients are either non-voice 
(such as database management, job postings, sourcing 
candidates or CV formatting) or voice based (such as 
headhunting, market research, candidate screening and 
interviews, reference checking and document collation). 
Clients can choose to cover the entire recruitment life 
cycle or specific activities.
The services are highly specialised, customised to the 
client and follow global delivery standards. Although 
services are provided to clients in any sector, the  
primary focus is on the Healthcare, IT and Engineering  
& Energy sectors.
The key asset of the company is its people. IMS invests 
heavily in training, coaching and mentoring its staff to 
ensure they deliver a high quality service to their clients. 
By the end of 2015 they had over 450 staff. On any given 
day they receive 300 orders and submit 500 candidates 
to their clients. In 2015 they filled 1,700 orders for over 
130 staffing firms.
IMS has been recognised for their achievements:
• In 2015 they were awarded the ‘Best SME in India’ in 
the emerging sector category by Dun & Bradstreet.
• Silicon India, a Bangalore headquartered magazine has 
rated IMS as the ‘Best SMEs in Offshore Recruitment 
Services’ in 2015.
• In 2014 IMS won the ‘Outsourced Solutions Provider’ 
award in Australia from Recruitment International.
IMS has clear plans to continue growing, with 
expectations of opening a fourth office in 2016 to meet 
the increasing client demand.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
 “THE GROUP CONTINUES TO HAVE
GOOD FORWARD VISIBILITY FROM ITS
ORDER BOOK AND HIGH LEVELS OF 
RECURRING REVENUES FROM A
DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE.”
Overview
I am pleased to report that in the past year Phoenix IT Group has 
developed into a larger, more resilient and competitive business
with three operating divisions focused on speciﬁ c sectors of
the UK IT services market. The integration of the Group’s most 
recent acquisition, ICM, together with our earlier acquisitions, 
Servo and NDR, was completed in the year and returns on our 
investment in additional business recovery and hosting facilities 
have underpinned our organic revenue growth and positioned 
the Group for future growth.
We have had a successful year ﬁnancially. For the year ended
31 March 2009 Group proﬁ t before tax (before non-recurring
items and amortisation of acquired intangibles) grew by 10.6% 
to £28.3m
(1)
 (2008: £25.5m) on Group revenues of £253.2m 
(2008: £230.8m), an increase of 9.7%. Cash generation was also 
strong enabling a reduction in net debt (including ﬁ nance
leases) of £14.5m to £88.4m (2008: £102.9m).
Factors helping to drive this growth and operational 
performance include: our ﬂ exibility and responsiveness to the
particular needs of our customers; operational precision and 
quality of service; the introduction of new and innovative 
services; and tight cost controls that help us quote competitively 
for new business in the markets in which we operate.
Strategy 
The Group’s strategy for increasing Shareholder value and 
accelerating growth by entering into IT outsourcing contracts 
and through the development of niche IT services, particularly 
business continuity and hosting, remains unchanged. We are 
conﬁ dent that we have the right strategy in place to deliver
value to our customers and shareholders. Each of our three 
operating divisions beneﬁ ts directly from being part of the
wider Group, leveraging our centres of excellence as well as 
giving opportunities to cross-sell between divisions and to sell
a wider portfolio of services to existing and prospective 
customers. In addition, as we plan for the longer-term growth
of the Group, we have established a strong modular structure 
which can be readily expanded with the addition of service lines 
and potential further acquisitions which meet our strict criteria. 
The Board believes that a continuing focus on the UK will 
maximise the performance of the Group for the foreseeable 
future and enhance shareholder value through securing 
proﬁ table, cash generative growth.
The markets the Group serves
With effect from 1 April 2008 the Group moved from ﬁ ve
operating businesses to three customer-facing divisions: ICM 
Continuous Business (Business Continuity) serving the Business 
Continuity and Disaster Recovery market; Phoenix IT Services 
(Partner Services), providing a full range of IT support services
to large Partner organisations; and Servo (Mid-Market) which 
serves the UK corporate and public sector mid-market. Where it 
is most cost-effective to do so, these divisions are supported by 
shared activities, operated as centres of excellence by the 
division best equipped to provide that function to the other 
operating divisions in the Group.
Phoenix continues to be well positioned in each of its chosen 
markets and has good forward visibility and resilience from its 
forward order book. Our spread of customers and penetration 
of more defensive sectors, such as the public sector, results in
a high level of recurring revenue derived from a diversiﬁ ed
customer base. In the year no contract was larger than 4% 
(2008: 4%) of Group revenue. As at 31 March 2009 the Group’s 
annualised contract value was £179.9m (2008: £182.0m) and
the values by sector were:

Integration process
As anticipated, we completed our integration programme 
during the year. The combination of the Phoenix businesses
and ICM resulted in a number of cost synergies together with 
cost savings arising from the increased buying power of the 
enlarged Group. We are also beginning to beneﬁ t from
cross-selling and collaborative working across the three 
customer facing divisions. In addition, the combination of 
Phoenix and ICM’s operations into larger units throughout the 
UK is providing improved operating efﬁ ciency from the greater
density of geographical coverage.
Changes to the economic background
The recession is affecting the markets in which we operate and 
the speed and scale of the general economic downturn has 
been greater than envisaged by some commentators. As a 
result, 2009 is likely to be a tough year for some participants in 
the IT sector. However, having taken early action, including a 
review of our cost base, the Group is well positioned to be able 
to withstand the recession and whilst the short-term outlook 
remains sensitive to recessionary inﬂ uences, the medium-term
prospects for growth in our markets are positive. 
There is an ongoing need for our customers to invest in
IT services, particularly the outsourcing of IT functions, to 
maintain and improve their competitive positions. The 
investments we have made during the year combined with the 
removal of duplicated activities through the integration means 
we are well positioned in the more difﬁ cult economic climate.
Each of our three customer-facing divisions is appropriately 
structured and resourced for the less favourable market 
conditions anticipated for the remainder of 2009 and beyond. 
Actions have been taken to cut costs and maximise cash 
generation in order to mitigate any further downturn and 
protect the Group’s capital position whilst safeguarding the 
Group’s core strengths. The key actions we have taken to 
reduce costs and improve our working capital efﬁ ciency are:
Cost Reduction 
Action has been taken to reduce discretionary expenditure and 
to streamline ﬁ xed elements of cost such as central functions
and management structures. Regrettable but necessary 
decisions have been taken to reduce headcount across the 
Group and to cancel the Group’s annual salary review for 2009.
I have been encouraged by the positive way that our staff have 
adapted to these changes. In addition, we have imposed a 
disciplined approach to the use of subcontractors. We now have 
our cost base at the appropriate level for the current market, 
though we will continue to drive best value from our supplier 
relationships and through continuous improvement of our 
processes and productivity. We are also ready to take any 
additional action that becomes necessary in individual business 
units should demand conditions weaken further.
Working Capital Efﬁciency
We saw pressure on our working capital efﬁciency ratios during
the year as both suppliers and customers sought to conserve 
cash. However, net working capital reduced by £4.8m 
compared with 31 March 2008 which was largely due to a 
reduction in Days Sales Outstanding to 54 days (2008: 60 days). 
The actions we have taken to improve the efﬁ ciency of cash
collections from our customers are expected to have an 
enduring beneﬁ t to the Group’s working capital position.
Cash ﬂ ow and Capital Expenditure
The improvement in net debt was achieved despite signiﬁ cant
cash ﬂ ow pressures on some of our customers during the year.
The Group continues to be highly cash generative and
I am pleased to report that the Group’s net debt position
was reduced by £14.5m to £88.4m (2008: £102.9m). This was 
after continued signiﬁ cant investment in the asset base of
the Group to support future growth and non-recurring 
integration cash costs of £5.8m. The Group also repaid
£11.0m of the principal ﬁ ve year term loan in September 2008
and £3.3m drawn on the 364 day facility in February 2009, 
resulting in the cancellation of these elements of the
banking facilities.
Capital expenditure in the year was £15.5m (2008: £21.4m)
with signiﬁ cant investment in our hosting centres at the
existing Birstall and Farnborough sites and business continuity 
facilities at our Aston ofﬁ ces. There was also further investment
during the second half of the year to increase business

continuity and hosting capacity at our Wapping site. Following 
our investment programme in business recovery and hosting 
facilities, the Group now has sufﬁ cient capacity to support
anticipated growth in these two key growth areas for the 
current ﬁ nancial year. Consequently, planned capital
expenditure can be reduced in the new ﬁ nancial year and is
expected to be broadly sustainable at this reduced level for one 
to two years as we continue to invest selectively in capital 
projects on a sales-led basis where satisfactory investment 
returns can be achieved.

Revenues £51.2m £42.0m 22.0%
Proﬁ t from operations £13.0m £8.9m 47.1%
Operating margin 25.4% 21.1%
The formation of the Business Continuity division has created
a critical mass business providing a national network of 18 
business recovery centres geographically well placed in relation 
to our target customer groups, with each centre equipped to 
meet the speciﬁ c needs of our customers. The ICM acquisition
and integration has further strengthened the Group’s position 
in the UK business continuity services market, making the Group 
one of only four signiﬁ cant providers of these services in the UK.
Combining the ICM and NDR customer bases has given us the 
intended extensive penetration of both the large enterprise and 
SME sectors providing us with a solid platform for growth and the 
knowledge and expertise to accelerate business progress. This is 
reﬂ ected in the strong growth of both revenues and operating
proﬁ t during the year.
Revenues for the year were £51.2m (2008: £42.0m) and operating 
proﬁ t £13.0m (2008: £8.9m). On a pro forma basis assuming that
ICM had been acquired on the ﬁ rst day of the comparative
period, revenues have increased by 12.5% and operating proﬁ t
by 37.5%. 
Despite the impact of an increase in electricity costs during
the second half of the 2009 ﬁ nancial year, operating margins
have continued to improve as the division has increased the 
utilisation of its syndicated seats and expanded its hosting 
capacity. The utilisation rate for syndicated seats increased to 
47% at 31 March 2009 (31 March 2008: 42%).
During the year our contract with a large investment bank
was terminated when that bank ceased trading. Following the 
acquisition of the UK operations of the failed bank by another 
bank, the contract continued on amended terms with the new 
owner, a testimony to our responsiveness and the quality of 
service we provide. 
The Business Continuity order book increased by 6.2%
to £98.8m (2008: £93.1m) at 31 March 2009 representing
almost two years’ annual revenues and the division has a
strong pipeline of new business opportunities. As a result
of the economic downturn, contract renewal rates by value 
marginally decreased to 87% (2008: 89%) including the
net impact of the contract termination and replacement in 
respect of the large investment bank relationship referred
to earlier.
During the year further investment has been made to develop 
the hosting and business continuity facilities at the Aston 
ofﬁ ces, where the division is headquartered, to complete the
ﬁt-out of the Farnborough business continuity and hosting sites
and to provide additional hosting and business continuity 
capacity at our Wapping ofﬁ ces.

Revenue £105.5m £102.9m 2.5%
Proﬁ t from operations £16.1m £17.6m (9.1%)
Operating margin 15.3% 17.2%
The Partner Services business provides services to large 
commercial and public sector end users through ‘tier 1’ IT 
services companies (Partners). 
The strategy pursued in our Partner Services business is to 
provide a comprehensive range of IT services to Partner 
organisations to support their typically multi-year contracts 
with their end user customers. This approach is increasingly 
important in these changeable markets and the Partner model 
continues to have tremendous value with our customer base, 
particularly in an industry which is consolidating and becoming 
increasingly commoditised.
Against a market background of increased competition and 
commoditisation, and the short-term disruption resulting from 
the integration process, revenues for the year were £105.5m 
(2008: £102.9m) and operating proﬁ t £16.1m (2008: £17.6m).
Operating margin for the year was 15.3% (2008: 17.2%).

proﬁ t of the Group’s French business, the Partner Services
division’s results were:

(2)  
Excluding revenues and proﬁ t of French operation disposed of during
the year.
Management believe the division’s margin is broadly sustainable
at this level. It is pleasing to note that the actions taken within the
division increased the operating margin in the second half of the
year to 15.4% compared to the weaker performance in the ﬁrst
six months when the margin was 15.2%.
The performance of the division, and in particular the decline
in operating margin, reﬂ ects not only difﬁcult market
conditions but also some additional costs incurred in relation
to the Group’s integration. These were necessary to ensure 
appropriate service levels to customers through the post-
integration period. Following the integration, service quality 
remains high and we continue to meet overall customer service 
level agreements. 
In the competitive market in which Phoenix IT Services operates, 
in the year there have been fewer large-scale multi-million 
pound, multi-year contract opportunities and consequently 
new business wins have been increasingly of a smaller size.
The uncertainty resulting from the economic downturn has
also increased the average time new customers are taking to 
reach purchasing decisions and has resulted in certain 
Partners committing to shorter periods of minimum 
contracted revenues on contract renewals, contributing to a 
reduction in the division’s contract renewal rate by value to 
66% (2008: 86%). These factors have held back growth in the 
order book which reduced by £28.1m to £142.2m at 31 March 
2009 (2008: £170.3m). 
However, there continues to be a good pipeline of opportunities
and the depth of the recession should provide further business 
opportunities with Partners whose end user customers are 
seeking reductions in their cost bases to improve their 
competitive positions. 
During the year we sold our small French operation which 
delivered services to French IT industry Partners by seeking to 
replicate the UK Partner model. Revenues and operating proﬁ t
of the French business for the year ended 31 March 2009 were 
£1.6m (2008: £2.5m) and £0.2m (2008: £0.2m) respectively. This 
divestment improves our focus and reduces business risk. Whilst 
UK centric, the Group will continue to offer European services as 
an adjunct to UK business using third party providers.

Revenue £96.5m £85.9m 12.3%
Proﬁ t from operations £10.0m £9.0m 12.1%
Operating margin 10.4% 10.4%
This division sells a broad range of IT services and IT products to 
the Mid-market providing customers with a complementary 
and extensive range of services on a UK-wide basis. Year-on-
year operating margins have been maintained with the division 
achieving increased margins of 10.7% in the second half of the 
year compared to 10.1% in the ﬁ rst half. This reﬂects an
improvement in Servo’s business mix, healthy new business 
generation and an increase in hosting revenues. A key objective 
for the Servo division is to extend its presence further in the 
Mid-market business sector as this represents a signiﬁ cant
growth opportunity for the Group.
Hosting revenues increased by 93.3% to £6.1m (2008: £3.1m).
Of the Annual Contract Value of £7.4m (2008: £4.2m) at
31 March 2009, 73% is derived from managed hosting. These 
high quality annuity contracts improve the visibility of future 
revenues and earnings within this division. Investment in 
hosting capacity has been made with further signiﬁ cant data
centre space commissioned during the latter part of 2008
in response to strong market demand for these services.
Revenues for the year were £96.5m (2008: £85.9m) and 
operating proﬁ t was £10.0m (2008: £9.0m). On a pro forma basis
assuming that ICM had been acquired on the ﬁ rst day of the
comparative period, revenues have increased by 1.1% and 
operating proﬁ t by 1.3%.
The Servo order book decreased by 1.4% to £45.9m (2008: 
£46.5m) at 31 March 2009 reﬂ ecting the increase in time being
taken by some new customers to reach purchasing decisions 
and a decrease in the contract renewal rate to 87% (2008: 92%) 
by value which is a reﬂ ection of the current economic
background and some disruption during the integration to
a small number of customers. 
Outlook
With the continued deterioration of the UK economic climate 
this will be a challenging year for the sector. We are conﬁ dent
that we have taken the necessary steps, including a review of 
our cost base, to be ready for these challenges. The Group 
continues to have good forward visibility from its order book 
and high levels of recurring revenues from a diversiﬁ ed
customer base. 
We have achieved good momentum into the new ﬁnancial
year and remain well positioned in each of our chosen
markets. In spite of continuing macroeconomic uncertainties, 
we remain positive about the outlook for the current year and 
beyond and are well placed to capture further opportunities 
and market share.

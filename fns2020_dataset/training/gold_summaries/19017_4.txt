 Great neighbourhood

neighbourhood stores play in many people’ s daily lives.
Our group at a glance
McColl’ s Retail Group is the holding 
company for a portfolio of convenience 
store and newsagent brands.
Convenience
Our 893 convenience stores provide 
a great range of everyday products 
and services to local people living in 
neighbourhoods across the UK.
From a pint of milk in the morning to 
an evening meal, from an open-all-hours 
post office to a great selection of fresh fruit 
and vegetables and food-to-go, from 
the newspapers delivered to your door to 
internet collection and returns around the 
corner – our convenience stores are at the 
heart of the UK’ s neighbourhoods.
Newsagents 
With 459 newsagents across 
the country, we are the UK’ s 
No. 1 specialist confectioner, 
tobacconist and newsagent. 
Our newsagents are not 
only a strong and established 
part of the business, but also 
provide a valuable foundation 
for our continued growth 
in convenience through 
our ongoing programme 
of conversions to 
convenience stores.

Serving our 
customers
We’re deeply committed to 
serving our customers across 
the UK. Our long-standing 
link with the Basildon Triangle 
community is a great 
example – where a disaster 
proved to be the catalyst for 
a brand new store.
Being there for 
neighbourhoods
We believe what’s good for 
the neighbourhood is good 
for our business. At our 
recently acquired Malton 
store for example, offering 
more for the neighbourhood 
has led to a boost in sales.
Making the most  
of food-to-go
We’re putting a big 
emphasis on making the 
most of food-to-go, for our 
customers and our business. 
A key highlight here is the 
success of our first Subway 
franchise, in Tamworth.

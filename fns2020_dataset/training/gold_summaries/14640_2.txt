Highlights
Organic sales increased by 3% despite difficult economic 
conditions. Operating profit rose by an outstanding 26% at 
constant currency and the margin rose to a record 19.7%. 
The margin was underpinned by an increased focus on price 
management, restructuring benefits and improved performance 
from the consolidated manufacturing site in Cheltenham. 
There was good sales growth in the UK, Africa and the 
Middle East.
Highlights
Organic sales increased by 8% with good growth in controls, 
flow metering and services. Market conditions remained 
favourable in China where our business performed strongly and 
our business in Korea delivered another good result. We continued 
to add sales resource expanding our direct sales presence in the 
Philippines and Indonesia. Overall, operating profit was up 6% 
at constant currency. 29 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Highlights
Organic sales were broadly flat with growth in Latin America 
but with lower sales in North America due to the non-repeat of 
large projects in the USA and lower project activity in Canada. 
Operating profit was up 6% at constant currency and the 
operating profit margin returned to almost 20%, with a good 
contribution from cost reductions and efficiencies in the USA.
Highlights
Organic sales increased by 4%, with growth in biopharm and 
food & beverage markets but with a difficult comparison in the 
second half year due to several large non-repeating projects. 
Underlying demand was sustained and we ended 2013 with a 
strong order book. The new Qdos and Apex products contributed 
significantly and we continued to add sector-focused sales 
resource. Operating profit increased by 7% at constant currency.

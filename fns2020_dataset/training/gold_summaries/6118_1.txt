 It has been a good year for Flying Brands, the most pleasing aspects
being that the plans for brand development initiated in 2003 started
to deliver positively in 2004. It has been and remains our intention
to widen the appeal of all our brands so that our existing customers
have greater choice and that a new and different type of customer
will find what we have to offer more appealing. As the cost per new
customer gradually increases from conventional print media, we see
the Internet as central to our growth plans. We are also committed
to improving the quality of our products whilst maintaining our
competitive pricing so that the businesses within Flying Brands
become synonymous with value and service.
The increase in profitability over 2003 was achieved in the face of
continuing delivery cost increases (approximately 10%); I am pleased
to report that we have negotiated a new contract with our postal
services for 2005 that will result in lower increases in this crucial
area for us.
Top line growth has proved elusive over the last two years. We have
been pursuing a deliberate policy of only chasing profitable sales by
eliminating fringe and risky new customer recruitment; however, it is
becoming increasingly expensive to recruit new customers, so it is
essential that we continue to improve customer retention (up to
53% overall in 2004 from 48% the year before) and drive up both
annual customer spend (up to £21.60 in 2004 from £19.24 in 2003)
and frequency of purchase (up from 0.79 in 2003 to 0.89 in 2004
across the whole active trading database) to offset a generally higher
recruitment cost per new customer. We were well positioned for sales
growth at the half year, but trading conditions were much tougher
in the second half, resulting in an outcome below our expectations.
STRATEGIC FOCUS
We will continue to run our core business to maximise profit growth
and cash generation, whilst ensuring that sufficient investment is
made in our existing brands to drive up longer term sales growth.
This means that we need to continue to build our active customer
database (defined as customers who have made at least one
purchase from us in the last 12 months) either through new
customer recruitment or through the reactivation of lapsed customers.
We did well in 2004: the total active database increased by 4% 
over 2003 from 894K to 932K; more importantly, customers who
ordered more than once increased by 9% from 691K to 753K,
pointing to the success both of our targeted mailings and the
deployment of our database management skills. We are finding 
that we are able to mail our best customers more often, whilst the
widening of the overall product ranges gives them more reasons 
to buy more frequently.
We recognise the growing importance of the Internet to our
business as on line sales moved from 6.5% of total revenues in
2003 to 8.1% in 2004, and total on line sales themselves increased
24%. Our brand web sites have developed to a much higher level 
of sophistication and customer involvement whilst remaining both
easy to navigate and order from. We now have over 130K e-mail
addresses, a sophisticated e-mail marketing plan and are working
hard at search engine optimisation to drive potential new customers
to our sites. Our web sites are regularly refreshed with special
seasonal offers and a more editorial approach whilst still dedicated
to driving sales.
Running in parallel with this strategy lies our commitment to make
appropriate acquisitions to drive top line and profits growth as well
as economies of scale through our infrastructure. We deliberately set
ourselves a series of strict criteria when assessing potential businesses.
This should ensure that the companies or brands that we acquire
add real value to the Group as a whole, but for which we have paid
a fair price. An acquisition is key to our overall strategy so getting it
right is more important than setting a tight timescale.
Notwithstanding these issues, we believe that the cash and profits
that we generate, linked to the potential of both the Internet and
the continuing efficiencies of our infrastructure, stand Flying Brands
in good stead. We are close to achieving what we said we were
going to with our current brands, and we are now in a much better
position to see these brands expand and attract more overall spend
and new customers.

FLYING FLOWERS
Sales were £12.8m (2003: £12.8m) with a contribution of £4.1m
(2003: £4.2m) and a contribution margin of 32% (2003: 33%).
Internet sales increased by 13% to £1.62m, representing 13% of
total sales (2003: 12%).
Flying Flowers remains the UK’s leading postal delivered bouquet
business, despatching nearly 1m bouquets a year. Although
predominantly active around the peaks of Valentine’s Day, Mother’s
Day and especially Christmas, we have managed to increase our
activity at other times of the year, with Easter, for instance,
emerging as an important marketing opportunity. We are continuing
to seek out more promotional occasions through the year and have
increased the number of mailings our best customers receive from
eight to ten. The number of active customers who have bought
from Flying Flowers more than once increased in 2004 by 5% over
prior year, and 40 new products were introduced (46% of the total).
Our Mother’s Day promotion won the Direct Marketing Association’s
“People’s Choice” mail order award for creativity and responsiveness.
Although Flying Flowers had a disappointing Christmas campaign in
2004, the rest of the year was the best the brand has experienced for
some time, with positive sales growth across all other areas of activity.
KELVEDON PARK CALL CENTRE PACKING FLOWERS IN JERSEY
The success of the brand outside of Christmas was driven by 
several factors:
• Giving customers reasons to buy flowers throughout the year
• Introducing a lower (£9.99) price point
• Introducing new bouquets and flower varieties
• Successful diversification into other low price gift products
• Creating different and more relevant offers to different 
customer segments
• Better management of new customer recruitment and old
customer reactivation
• More dynamic on line presence
• Improving quality (reduced customer complaints)
• Encouraging growth of our guaranteed delivery date Ultimate offer
The new gift types (pot plants, personalised teddy bears, wine gift
sets) lifted response and we will be promoting these (together with
new gift products) alongside our flower bouquets as a unified
catalogue in 2005.
The web site is regularly updated to offer special seasonal bouquets
and suggest relevant and up to the minute reasons for giving gifts at
different times of the year. Our intention is to create an exciting gift
solution site.

OUR GROWING FACILITIES IN JERSEY
GARDENING DIRECT
Sales increased to £15.2m (2003: £14.8m). Considerable investment
was focused on the Autumn campaign to reactivate lapsed customers
which both drove top line sales as well as the size of the active
customer database going into 2005, increasing by 4%. Despite this,
contribution still improved to £5.3m (2003: £5.2m). Contribution
margin was 35% (2003: 35%), and Internet sales grew by 47%,
which now represents 6% of total sales (2003: 4%).
Gardening Direct is the UK’s largest home delivery provider of
bedding plants, which we grow (over 120m per year) in our two
nurseries on Jersey. We work hard to ensure that our quality is of
the highest standards, a fact that was recognised by Gardening
Which where our products and service received very high positive
recognition in all categories. We are constantly testing new varieties
and looking to assist home gardeners of all types in delivering
beautiful borders, hanging baskets and flower beds. 2004 saw 
170 new products launched, which amounted to 49% of the total.
We also realise that customers expect us to provide excellent value
for money, which is why we cut many of our prices in 2004. As a
result the number of units despatched to our existing customers
increased by 14% over 2003, and overall customer retention
improved from 43% in 2003 to 51% in 2004. Spend per customer
also increased from £17.22 to £20.54.
2004 was the first year where Gardening Direct offered a
comprehensive Internet service. We have made the site much easier
to navigate, have introduced special offers and a customer
preference listing. With over 40K e-mail addresses, we also are able
to send out tactical promotions at different stages of the season.
We are working hard to increase sales of non plant gardening
products (hardware, accessories and gifts) which now account for
more than £0.5m in revenue. This demonstrates our commitment to
expand the Gardening Direct franchise to serve our existing customers
better, as well as attract new ones to grow the brand profitably.

LISTEN2BOOKS
Sales for Listen2Books increased to £3.5m, up from £3.4m in 2003,
with contribution increasing to £0.5m (2003: £0.2m). On line sales
increased by 26%, with on line now representing 9% of total sales
compared to 7% in 2003.
The brand has enjoyed a good year and has emerged as a significant
player in the audio book market place. New product introductions
(340 audio, video and DVD titles in 2004), many of which were
either exclusive or backed up by editorial support, have ensured that
customer spend has increased from £20.87 in 2003 to £25.10 in
2004. The active trading database increased by 7%, with customers
who buy more than once growing by 22%.
In addition during 2004, we successfully introduced CDs as an
alternative format to cassettes (approximately 50% of all titles
featured are dual format but this is increasing all the time) and have
seen a 25% take up of CDs where they have been offered. We
believe that this will widen the appeal of the brand to a younger
market. We also tested 52 video/DVD titles (of similar genre to our
core audio books offer) in the autumn and these were sufficiently
promising for us to integrate video/DVD within the main audio
catalogue from January 2005.
The web site is now far more dynamic and offers visitors the
opportunity to download samples of many audio books as a ‘taster’
to help the uninitiated understand just how good and easy to use
audio books really are. We feature a Best Sellers section driven by
actual sales, new releases changed weekly and recommendations
based on previous customers’ purchases.
Diversification into other home entertainment areas such as video
and DVD will both grow the brand more quickly and create a
rounded offer that should have a wider appeal than merely audio
books themselves. NEW INITIATIVES AT
BENHAM WILL IMPROVE
PERFORMANCE

BENHAM
Benham experienced a tough year, with sales of £4.1m (2003: £4.8m)
and profit £0.15m (2003: £0.24m). 2004 did not provide as many
new product opportunities as 2003 (such as the Queen’s Jubilee or
Rugby World Cup).
During the second half of 2004, we successfully installed a mail order
fulfilment system at Benham which will enable us both to run the
brand far more closely alongside our other businesses and also
provide us with management information to develop Benham far
more proactively. We also anticipate establishing an improved web
site in 2005: we believe that Benham products are ideally suited to
be traded on line.
In 2004, we migrated much of Benham’s stock to a new despatch
facility at our headquarters in Jersey, which will also give us much
greater control over this critical aspect of its business.
Coupled to these developments, we have reviewed our overall
product strategy and will be looking to create more opportunities
for our existing customers both to buy more and to spend more.
These combined actions should result in Benham returning to
growth in 2005.
INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS
We have continued to improve the overall efficiency of our
operations, which have been streamlined by moving order inputting
to Kelvedon Park (our call centre in Essex), alongside our telephone
handling division. This will help reduce the under capacity in
Kelvedon as well as centralising all packing and despatch operations
in Jersey, where a high level of expertise is being developed.
The second phase of the three year renovation project at Retreat Farm
in Jersey (our headquarters and fulfilment centre) was completed in
2004. We created a larger storage and despatch area for
Listen2Books and Gardening Direct hard goods, and a despatch
centre for Benham. These developments not only anticipate the
growth in gardening hard goods, audio books, video and DVD, 
but also anticipate an acquisition when the time comes. In addition,
we cultivated a “trial garden” to assess how new Gardening Direct
plants progress in “customer conditions”, which also enables us to
manage our own photography for promotion. The final phase, to 
be completed in 2005, will focus mainly on the replacement of the
refrigeration units, essential in prolonging the longevity of Flying
Flowers’ stems. The current units have reached the end of their
useful lives; there will also be the conversion of the remaining glass
panes to polycarbonate which are safer, longer lasting and allow for
constant temperature through the seasons. 10
FLYING BRANDS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004
We are also beginning the process of phasing out the use of
polystyrene despatch boxes on Flying Flowers in favour of cardboard.
Not only is this more environmentally friendly, it allows a partial
rebranding, better reflecting where the brand is today and also
enables us to prepare for the introduction of Royal Mail’s “size based
pricing” policy which may be introduced from the middle of 2006.
The Marketing Department has now been reorganised into brand
focused teams, served by a central database function, and we have
seen clear benefits in the approaches being taken to increasing the
brands’ franchises and in targeting our offers more effectively.
OUTLOOK
Flying Brands has many strengths:
• Market leading strong brands
• Increasing Internet presence
• Highly cash generative
• Very profitable (whether measured against revenue or 
capital employed)
• Progressive dividend policy
• Strong balance sheet
• Efficient operations with flexible infrastructure
• Currently debt free and no pension liabilities
• Significant freehold property portfolio
In developing this business to increase the value for shareholders,
we intend to build on these strengths:
• Widen the appeal of our existing brands, offering 
greater choice/value
• Embrace the Internet as the major growth opportunity
• Add brands and services to our portfolio to become a 
rounded retailer
• Increase cash and profits generation
• Maintain a progressive dividend policy
• Continue to improve operational efficiencies
• Accept debt for acquisitions but to a prudent level
I believe that we have a major opportunity, given the strength of our
current position, to become a much more significant retail presence
and really provide our shareholders with increasingly better returns.
We will do this sensibly and in line with our strategy, but we are
committed to achieving it.
I would like to thank the team at Flying Brands for their tenacity,
creativity and hard work during 2004: I know that our shareholders
appreciate their efforts.

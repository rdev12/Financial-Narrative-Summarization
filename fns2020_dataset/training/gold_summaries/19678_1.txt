 06 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Performance highlights
The Group has again delivered  
a strong ﬁnancial performance  
for the year.
Underlying Group revenue of 
£344.6 million was 5% higher than 
the previous year. The growth was 
driven by our Strategic Marketing 
segment, which delivered growth  
of 4% on an organic basis along 
with acquisitive growth of 24%. 
This was partially offset by a 4% 
decline in our Marketing Activation 
segment, due to pressure within  
the grocery retail sector. Revenue 
within our Books segment was 
broadly in line with the prior year. 
Group underlying proﬁt before tax 
grew to £33.0 million (2014 – £29.9 
million) and underlying basic earnings 
per share increasing by 9% to  
20.32 pence (2014 – 18.70 pence).
These improvements reﬂect further 
growth in our Strategic Marketing 
segment, which contributed 46% 
(2014 – 37%) of the Group’s 
underlying operating proﬁt during 
the ﬁnancial year.
The Board is recommending a ﬁnal 
dividend of 5.55 pence, making 
a full year dividend of 7.80 pence 
(2014 – 7.15 pence), an increase 
of 9%, reﬂecting the Board’s 
conﬁdence in the Group’s ability to 
make further strategic and ﬁnancial 
progress during the year ahead. 
Once again there was clear evidence 
of our ability to collaborate across 
our individual businesses to the 
beneﬁt of our clients, with the  
level and quality of internal referrals 
increasing further during the year. In 
2015 more than 100 (2014 – 82) of 
our clients used the services of more 
than one business within the Group.
In line with our strategy, during  
the year we acquired Chicago-
based Solstice, a leading mobile-
ﬁrst marketing and technology 
business which is integrating 
well into the Group. Following 
the year-end we also acquired 
Fripp, Sandeman and Partners 
(‘FSP’), a specialist retail property 
consultancy, which will work 
closely with our Pragma Consulting 
business, particularly in the airport, 
travel and commercial space 
sectors. 
The past year also saw continued 
growth from our international 
operations. Our market research 
consultancy, Incite, opened an ofﬁce 
in Shanghai, to complement the 
ofﬁces we have opened in New York 
and Singapore, with the business 
winning its ﬁrst new client mandates 
in the region at the end of the 
ﬁnancial year. In addition, Amaze, 
one of our digital businesses, won 
its ﬁrst major e-commerce systems 
integration project from our newly 
opened Chicago ofﬁce.
Our strategy for further growth is 
centred around three key priorities:
• organic growth through 
collaboration and investment in 
our existing marketing services 
businesses; 
• internationalisation, primarily 
client-led, into large and high 
growth markets; combined with 
• further acquisitions of 
complementary, ambitious and 
growing Strategic Marketing 
businesses, which share our 
common attributes and ethos. 
We have continued to make 
progress across all three strategic 
objectives in the year:
Collaboration:  
Our approach is based on cross-
thinking as opposed to cross-selling 
and where collaboration is facilitated 
and supported rather than forced. 
Over 100 of our clients currently 
work with more than one business 
across the Group, compared to 
approximately 80 in the previous 
ﬁnancial year, collaborating on 
projects for clients including 
Johnson & Johnson, Carlsberg, 
Royal Mail and Pizza Express.  
In the year, we also extended 
our remit with HSBC, which now 
engages with six businesses across 
the Group. In addition, investments 
have been made in our Occam 
and Amaze businesses, which 
culminated with the launch of our 
digitally-led Customer Relationship 
Management (‘CRM’) offering 
Amaze One.
Once again there was clear 
evidence of our ability to 
collaborate across our individual 
businesses to the beneﬁt  
of our clients, with the  
level and quality of internal 
referrals increasing further  
during the year.
A SOLID STRUCTURE  
FOR GROWTH
STRATEGIC REPORT  
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S PERFORMANCE REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 07
STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
Internationalisation: 
Many of our businesses deliver 
international solutions for clients 
and we plan to open additional 
overseas ofﬁces where we can 
identify client-led opportunities. 
These opportunities must be in 
large markets or in markets with 
the potential for signiﬁcant and 
sustainable growth. During the 
year we continued to expand our 
headcount in both the US and Asia 
to meet client demand. We also 
opened an ofﬁce in Shanghai for 
Incite, our consumer and market 
research consultancy. Over 30%  
of our Strategic Marketing revenue 
now comes from clients based 
outside of the UK, compared with 
27% in 2014 and 15% in 2013.  
Seven of our Group businesses, 
Incite, Pragma, Hive, Amaze, 
Realise, Branded3 and Solstice, 
now service clients on an 
international basis. 
Acquisitions: 
An important element of our growth 
strategy going forward is our 
continued ability to acquire further 
complementary marketing services 
businesses which add value to our 
existing portfolio and operate in the 
growth areas we have identiﬁed of 
data, digital and consulting services. 
Our acquisition strategy adopts very 
stringent quantitative, qualitative and 
ﬁnancial criteria. We aim to acquire 
non-competing businesses that 
support our business model. In 
addition, any companies we acquire 
must already enjoy reasonable 
scale and have management teams 
looking to execute the next phase 
of growth, as well as encouraging 
an entrepreneurial and collaborative 
culture that ﬁts well with our own. 
Once acquired, we transition each 
business into the Group using our 
well-established and successful 
integration process. We then work 
with the management teams to 
identify and implement the most 
appropriate initiatives for driving 
organic growth within the business. 
This model makes it imperative  
that there is a clear sharing of  
values between the Group and  
any acquired company.
HSBC has worked with St Ives 
Group for more than four years. 
The global ﬁnancial services 
company initially became a 
client of SIMS for marketing 
communications and print 
management.
SIMS manages HSBC’s direct 
mail, generating over 60 million 
mailing packs for customer 
acquisition, customer retention 
and mandatory communications. 
It has also implemented an asset 
management system, housing 
and printing on demand a full 
range of training materials 
to centralise learning and 
development collateral in  
a cost-efﬁcient solution.
Through the solid relationships 
that SIMS has cultivated, further 
services are being procured from 
other areas of St Ives Group. 
SP Group produces in-branch 
marketing communications for 
1,400 high-street premises, 
including ﬂyers and Point-of-Sale. 
Meanwhile, Service Graphics 
produced signage and graphics 
as part of the bank’s sponsorship 
of the Leeds First Direct Arena.
Response One manages 
customer data for HSBC, as well 
as a training asset programme 
which has been rolled out in the 
UK and is now planned to be 
implemented globally.
Digital services are also being 
deployed. Realise is converting 
traditional printed materials 
into digital experiences that 
prompt customer conversations 
with branch staff. Additionally, 
Branded3 has overhauled  
HSBC-owned First Direct’s  
search marketing.
In total, HSBC currently engages 
with six St Ives businesses, and 
is seeing clear beneﬁts from the 
collaboration of different Group 
companies offering extensive 
complementary services.
DELIVERING A JOINED UP STRATEGY 
HSBC
In 2015 we acquired mobile-ﬁrst 
marketing & technology business 
Solstice, which has integrated 
successfully into St Ives and is 
performing well, beneﬁtting from 
and contributing to collaboration 
opportunities within the Group. 
Following the year-end, we also 
acquired FSP , a specialist retail 
property consultancy, which will  
work closely with our Pragma 
Consulting business.
While the Group’s strategic focus 
is on expanding our Strategic 
Marketing offering, management  
also recognises the importance  
of continued investment and 
innovation in our complementary 
Marketing Activation segment  
and separate, long-standing and 
market-leading Books segment. 
These separate divisions not  
only support growth for the Group  
as a whole through collaboration,  
but also represent an additional 
source of proﬁt and cash generation 
as we pursue our growth strategy. 
 
CASE STUDY 08 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Our Strategic Marketing 
operations, which represent  
32% of Group underlying  
revenue (2014 – 26%), are 
organised around three high-
growth sectors: Data, Digital  
and Consulting. 
Data
Our Data businesses – Occam and 
Response One – represented 30% 
of Strategic Marketing revenue at 
£33.2 million (2014 – £35.5 million).
As reported at the half year, revenue 
within our Data division reduced 
compared with the previous year  
due to two factors: a significant  
one-off software sale within Occam 
in the previous year and a change 
in work mix in Response One. While 
these factors have led to a decrease 
in revenue in this financial year,  
they have also led to an increase  
in margin during the period. 
Over the course of the year, 
Response One has introduced 
a new analytics proposition and 
improved its digital capabilities.
In addition, Occam has significantly 
expanded its remit within Jaguar 
Land Rover and we are now 
delivering services into them through 
both Occam and Amaze One. 
Occam has also secured a number 
of new wins, including Car Giant, 
Healthspan, Sainsbury’s Retail 
Technology Services and the RAC.
Digital
This division, which comprises 
Amaze, Branded3, Realise and 
Solstice had a good year and 
contributed £45.5 million (2014 
– £27.8 million); 41% of Strategic 
Marketing revenue.
Amaze has continued to extend 
its commerce capabilities with a 
number of significant new client 
wins throughout the year. It has 
established a core strength in 
advising manufacturers who are 
transacting directly with their 
consumers for the first time and 
in the delivery of B2B commerce 
solutions. Both areas are currently 
experiencing significant market 
growth.
Following the launch of Amaze One, 
the CRM collaboration between 
Amaze and Occam, highlighted 
above, the business has progressed 
well, winning projects for the 
Arcadia Group and Royal Mail while 
also extending its CRM remit with 
Northern Rail. 
Branded3 has achieved a number 
of new business wins throughout 
the year, securing the search engine 
optimisation account for First Direct, 
which further extends our remit 
within HSBC, as well as winning 
contracts for Halfords, Chelsea FC 
and Durham University.
Realise has continued to build 
its business both within the UK 
and internationally. Highlights 
included a digital transformation 
project for Greyhound in the US 
and international digital marketing 
campaigns for Disneyland Parks 
and Expedia. In addition, Realise 
has had a number of significant  
new business wins including Nikon 
in Europe and Hewlett Packard  
& Sutter Health in the US. 
The acquisition of Solstice in  
March 2015 broadened the  
Group’s digital capabilities and 
enhanced our international 
credentials. Solstice’s offering  
of mobile product design and 
engineering services complements 
St Ives’ existing digital businesses 
and creates significant opportunities 
for increased collaboration at an 
international level. 
 
Moving forward, it is our intention  
to bring our digital businesses closer 
together in order to collaborate on 
large scale multi-discipline, multi-
territory digital client mandates.
Consulting
Our Consulting businesses – Incite, 
Pragma and Hive – represented 29% 
of Strategic Marketing revenue at 
£32.0 million (2014 – £22.9 million).
Incite continues to grow 
internationally, in response to client 
demand. It has seen strong growth 
in New York and Singapore having 
opened offices in both markets 
during 2013, and has secured a 
number of significant new business 
wins. Following this successful 
expansion, the business opened 
an operation in Shanghai this year, 
winning its first new client mandates 
in the region at the end of the 
financial year.
Pragma has also seen an increase 
in demand for overseas projects. 
Airports and commercial spaces  
in particular are high-growth areas, 
with the business advising on the 
commercial strategy of New Mexico 
City International Airport; one of this 
year’s most high profile projects. 
Hive, the heathcare communications 
consultancy we acquired in May 
2014, has integrated well into 
the Group and continues to add 
new clients to its roster, with 
substantial wins from three top 
20 pharmaceutical companies. Its 
patient journey mapping proposition 
is a strong growth driver for the 
business, with recent new project 
wins from Bayer, Novartis and 
AbbVie. This area is expected to see 
continued momentum into 2016.

STRATEGIC REPORT OUR FIGURES
Our Marketing Activation 
segment represented 48%  
(2014 – 53%) of Group underlying 
revenue for the year. 
Our Marketing Activation segment 
comprises our Exhibitions and Events 
business, Service Graphics; our 
Point-of-Sale specialist, SP Group; 
our Print Management business,  
St Ives Management Services (SIMS); 
and our Field Marketing business, 
Tactical Solutions.
Trading conditions within Marketing 
Activation were mixed, with growth in 
Service Graphics and SIMS offset by 
a reduction in Point-of-Sale revenue 
caused by ongoing pressures within 
the UK grocery retail sector. Despite 
the overall reduction in revenue  
we have maintained margins  
through improved efficiencies  
and cost reductions.

Our market-leading Books 
business, Clays, represented 
20% (2014 – 21%) of Group 
underlying revenue for the year. 
Revenue in Clays was broadly  
in line with the prior year at  
£66.9 million (2014 – £67.4 million), 
with a slight decrease in margins. 
Clays is the market leader in UK 
trade monochrome book production 
services and continues to extend  
its range of value-added services to 
the publishing market through digital 
and supply chain-related investment. 
This has included the introduction  
of a new self-publishing service  
that is seeing rapid volume growth.
As reported at the half year, sentiment 
within the physical book market has 
improved, with eReader penetration 
appearing to have levelled off within 
the UK and the US and with physical 
book volumes stable for the first  
time in a number of years.
During the year we reached 
agreement with Penguin Random 
House, the UK’s largest trade 
publisher, to provide 100% of their 
UK monochrome book production 
under a new multi-year contract. 
This represents a significant market 
share gain for the business and, 
along with a number of other recent 
contract wins and extensions, 
secures approximately 80% of  
Clays’ workload for the next  
three to six years.

The new financial year has started 
in line with our expectations. 
We continue to encourage and 
facilitate significant opportunities for 
collaboration across our individual 
businesses and there is further scope 
to expand our higher margin Strategic 
Marketing activities both organically 
and through acquisition over the 
coming year. We will continue to 
invest in our growing operations and 
client offering in the US and Asia, as 
well as in our recent acquisitions, 
Solstice and FSP .
The outlook for our Marketing 
Activation businesses remains 
challenging, impacted by the 
Outlook
competitive trading conditions  
in the UK grocery retail sector,  
which are expected to continue 
this year. However, this business 
segment remains profitable and  
cash generative for the Group,  
as does our market-leading Books 
business. Both segments have 
recently benefitted from a number  
of contract wins or extensions which 
help to provide an enhanced level 
of stability. This, together with our 
strong balance sheet, leaves St Ives 
well positioned to pursue further 
acquisitions of complementary, 
ambitious and growing Strategic 
Marketing businesses which share 
our common attributes and ethos.
Within Service Graphics we won 
new clients during the year such as 
the Ministry of Defence, Moorfields 
Eye Hospital and Rolls Royce. Within 
SIMS we delivered significant growth 
due to new client wins including 
Adidas and Pernod Ricard as well  
as securing organic growth from  
our existing client base.
Despite a difficult year, due to 
increased competitive pressures 
within the grocery retail market, 
Tactical Solutions has also had 
a number of new business wins 
over the year, including Revlon and 
Quorn. We continue to invest in new 
data and technology capabilities and 
have recently launched a bespoke 
data tool, TSeye, to continue  
to differentiate the business in  
a crowded market place. 
We have also significantly developed 
our creative marketing and design 
offering, The Shop, which sits within 
our SP operation and which has 
extended our European remit with 
international client engagements  
such as Adidas. 
In addition, since the end of 
last year we have re-signed and 
extended contracts with many of 
our leading clients. These contract 
extensions provide an increased level 
of visibility and a stable foundation  
for market share growth over the  
next two to three years.
As a Group, we are clear on our 
growth priorities and are confident 
that, assuming current market 
conditions continue, St Ives will 
make further strategic and financial 
progress during the year ahead.

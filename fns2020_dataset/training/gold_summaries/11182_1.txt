 4  Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Group Chief Executive’s statement
Overview
The Group results for the year and 
comparatives have been adjusted 
to reflect the re-classification of our 
Australian business as held for disposal 
at 31 March 2014.
Group revenue for the year increased by 
9.2% to £218.7m (2013: £200.4m) and by 
16.6% on a constant currency basis. On a 
like for like basis, excluding Vado (acquired 
in March 2013) and Nortec (disposed of in 
November 2012), revenue was 4.5% lower 
on a reported basis, but 1.9% higher on a 
constant currency basis.
UK market conditions during the year have 
been mixed, with the trade sector recovery 
driven by improving new house build and 
housing transactions. The retail sector 
remained weak for most of the year 
although there have been signs of 
improvement in the last quarter of our 
financial year. UK revenue for the year at 
£148.0m (2013: £122.8m) was 20.6% higher 
on a reported basis reflecting the Vado 
acquisition in March 2013. On a like for like 
basis excluding Vado, UK revenue was 3.2% 
lower than last year with good progress in 
Triton Showers and Norcros Adhesives 
offset by lower revenue at Johnson Tiles. 
In its first year under Norcros ownership, 
Vado has performed in line with our 
expectations and although the comparatives 
are not reported in our results, revenue for 
the full year was 16.5% ahead of last year. 
This strong performance, together with the 
successful integration of the business during 
the year, leaves Vado well positioned to make 
further progress.
Despite a challenging market environment, 
our South African business performed well 
with full year revenue growth of 9.1% on a 
constant currency basis and 11.8% on a like 
for like basis (excluding Nortec which was 
disposed of in November 2012). A 19.5% 
weaker Rand compared to last year resulted 
in full year reported Sterling revenue being 
8.8% lower than prior year at £70.7m 
(2013: £77.6m) and 6.6% lower on a like 
for like basis.
Group underlying operating profit at £16.1m 
(2013: £12.8m) was 25.5% higher than prior 
year, with operating margins also ahead at 
7.3% (2013: 6.4%). This was achieved despite 
the weaker South African Rand which 
impacted reported South African profits 
by £0.4m. 
Strong cash conversion in our businesses 
resulted in closing net debt lower at £26.9m 
(2013: £30.7m) and leaves the Group well 
positioned for future growth.
Strategy
As reported in March 2013, the Board has 
set itself three strategic targets. These are 
to double Group revenue to £420m by 2018, 
to maintain revenue derived outside of the 
UK at approximately 50% of Group revenue, 
and to sustain a pre-tax return on capital 
employed of 12% to 15% over the economic 
cycle. I’m pleased to say that good progress 
has been made on a number of fronts 
towards these targets.
The acquisition of Vado has helped drive 
revenue growth of 9.2% in the year and 
16.6% on a constant currency basis. Vado 
has been integrated quickly and seamlessly 
into the Norcros Group, and has been 
Summary

in line with expectations 
and well positioned to 
make further progress

Australian business disposed 
of on 30 May 2014 for total 
consideration of £4.2m
With our strong brands, leading market positions and 
continued self-help initiatives focused on market share 
gain, the Board remains confident that the Group should 
continue to make progress for the year to 31 March 2015.

significantly earnings enhancing in its first 
year of ownership. Furthermore, exciting 
synergy benefits between Vado and the 
rest of the Group are being developed, 
including Vado’s first ever range of top 
end electric showers aimed at high 
street bathroom boutiques.
Towards the end of the financial year, 
the Group entered into a conditional 
agreement to dispose of 100% of the share 
capital of Norcros Industry (Pty) Ltd which 
owns the Group’s Australian tiles business, 
Johnson Tiles (Pty) Ltd (JTA) to Kim Hin 
Industries Berhad (KHIB), a company listed 
on the Malaysian Bursa. This transaction 
was completed on 30 May 2014 for total 
consideration of £4.2m. This sale represents 
an excellent outcome for our shareholders, 
and allows management to fully focus on 
its target geographies of the UK, Africa 
and the Middle East. 
Property
Progress on resolving legacy property 
issues has been mixed. 
Excellent progress has been made 
through the sub-let of the vacant and 
surplus property at Groundwell, Swindon, 
to Network Rail Infrastructure Limited for 
the period through to 31 December 2018. 
This sub-lease will reduce the Group’s 
net cash outflow on legacy leases by 
approximately £4.0m over the five year 
period starting from 1 April 2014. There is 
no exceptional income statement charge 
or credit as a result of this transaction.
Progress on the conditional sale of surplus 
land at Tunstall, Stoke on Trent, to a subsidiary 
of WM Morrison Supermarkets plc (Morrisons) 
has, however, been disappointing. Following 
a contractual dispute, this transaction has 
not progressed as planned, and the Board 
continues to seek compensation from 
Morrisons as well as to investigate 
alternative buyers for the site. 
Summary and outlook
UK construction activity and an improving 
housing market has driven trade sector 
recovery during the year but the UK retail 
sector, as expected, is taking longer to 
benefit, although there have been some 
encouraging signs more recently. Whilst 
the medium-term outlook in South Africa 
is positive, the weak Rand continues to have 
an adverse effect on Rand profit translation to 
Sterling. Nevertheless, with our strong brands, 
leading market positions and continued 
self-help initiatives focused on market share 
gain, the Board remains confident that the 
Group should continue to make progress 
for the year to 31 March 2015.

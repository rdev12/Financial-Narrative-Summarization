 Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to report to Shareholders that Carr’s achieved a strong 
financial performance for the past year whilst continuing to build the 
Group’s market presence both in the UK and overseas.
The result for the 52 weeks ended 28 August 2010 
reflects positive trading across both Agricultural 
businesses with our Engineering business benefiting from 
the first full-year contribution from Wälischmiller, which 
was acquired in March 2009. Over-capacity in the milling 
industry had an adverse impact on our food business 
where management continue to focus on reducing costs 
and developing higher-margin speciality products.
In March and June 2010, we strengthened our 
Agricultural businesses in Scotland and the North of 
England through the acquisitions of Ag Chem (UK), 
Scotmin Nutrition Limited and A C Burn Limited for  
a total consideration of £6.0 million. The integration of 
these businesses is progressing well and will be earnings 
enhancing in the current financial period. 
Overall, the growth in profit and improvement in 
margins, combined with tight control over working 
capital, resulted in strong cash flow with net debt, after 
capital expenditure and acquisition costs, being £3.8 
million lower at the end of the period compared to  
the previous year.
We believe that the Group’s sound financial position  
and the investment made in developing the business  
has laid the foundation for a period of sustained growth, 
particularly in Agriculture.
Financial Review
Revenue for the period was £345.0 million (2009: £350.0 
million) and operating profit was up 25.4% to £9.1 
million (2009: £7.3 million). The growth in profit reflects 
increased sales of animal feed, feed blocks and fuel and 
the recovery in fertiliser after the very substantial fall 
in sales last year. Revenue and profit from the Food and 
Engineering divisions were lower than 2009.
After a reduced retirement benefit charge, which offset 
a lower share of profit from associate and joint ventures, 
pre-tax profit increased by 27.4% to £9.0 million (2009: 
£7.0 million). Fully diluted earnings per share were 27.4% 
higher at 64.1p (2009: 50.3p).
The Group generated net cash from operating activities 
of £15.3 million (2009: £5.6 million). This included a net 
cash inflow of £6.5 million (2009: outflow £0.2 million) 
from reduced working capital, of which £3.2 million 
was from payments on account received from our 
engineering customers.
Capital expenditure was £3.7 million (2009: £4.7 
million) as the Group continued to invest in necessary 
replacement of equipment, and the three acquisitions 
during the year cost a total of £6.0 million. After capital 
expenditure and acquisitions, net debt at 28 August 2010 
was reduced to £15.5 million (29 August 2009: £19.3 
million) representing gearing of 44.7% (2009: 64.7%).
Dividend
The Board paid two interim dividends of 6.0 pence per 
share in May 2010 and October 2010 to smooth the

cash flow for our Shareholders. At the Annual General

register at close of business on 24 December 2010.

Colonel Alexander Matthew
It is with sadness that I report to Shareholders the 
death during the year of Sandy Matthew. Sandy was 
appointed to the Board in 1964 and made an enormous 
contribution to the continuing success of the Company 
over the following 19 years. On behalf of all at Carr’s  
we extend our sympathy to Sandy’s family.
Outlook
The positive momentum of the second half of the 
year ended 28 August 2010 has continued into the 
new financial year. We anticipate farmers will continue 
to invest in response to favourable prospects in beef, 
lamb and cereals. As a result of higher input prices the 
farmgate milk price must only improve from its current 
unsustainably low levels.
We are well positioned to service increasing demand. 
Our businesses have developed significant expertise 
in the supply chain, building on their long association 
in flour and feed milling and extending this into the 
procurement of fertiliser and animal feed ingredients. 
These factors, together with the spread and diversity 
of our customer base, encourage us to believe that 
the two Agriculture Divisions will continue to develop 
and deliver consistent performance, even in challenging 
times.
Our financial performance will further benefit from 
having strengthened our market presence through 
acquisition and we continue to look for further 
opportunities. 
While Food is likely to remain a difficult environment, 
Engineering is trading well and remains a focused niche 
business. 
Overall, therefore, we believe we have laid a solid 
foundation for sustained growth and are confident  
in the outlook for the Group.

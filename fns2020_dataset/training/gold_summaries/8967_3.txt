Chairman’s Statement
“Very encouragingly, the total value of major 
orders won in the year at £25.3m was more 
than double the level of last year”
Overview
In my final results statement as Chairman 
I am delighted to report on the very 
encouraging progress K3 has made 
across the business. Most importantly, 
we have commercially launched our 
new flagship Microsoft-based software 
product, “ax|is” , which has been 
developed for the retail sector. Results 
for the year to 30 June 2014 reflect this 
progress with revenues up 13% year-
on-year to £71.95m and adjusted profit 
before tax
*1
 up 51% to £6.6m.
Very encouragingly, the total value 
of major orders won in the year at 
£25.3m was more than double the 
level of last year (2013: £11.8m). All our 
software products achieved year-on-
year increases, assisted by a general 
improvement in trading conditions in 
the UK. The strongest growth came from 
our “ax|is” solutions which accounted 
for approximately £12.63m of our new 
business wins, some 50% of K3’s total. 
This included two important pilot “ax|is” 
projects which are currently underway 
and should lead to further large orders. 
The financial benefits of these major 
new wins will continue to come through 
in the new financial year. 
We are pleased with the traction we are 
gaining with our “ax|is” solution. The 
significant development work we have 
invested in tailoring Microsoft’s generic 
Dynamics AX product for the retail 
sector and initial market reaction has led 
to a closer relationship with Microsoft. 
This is extremely helpful in supporting 
our plans to expand our channel to 
other markets around the world. 
As we previously reported, the 
expansion of our existing international 
partner channel is a major strategic 
focus and we have invested 
significantly in this over the year. We 
have already entered into agreements 
with a number of new key partners 
and are engaging with global system 
integrators. The development of this 
indirect sales channel will fuel high 
margin growth and will be a key area of 
investment over the new financial year 
and beyond. We are now co-ordinating 
our plans with Microsoft.
We stepped up our recruitment and 
training of AX resource over the year. As 
we have commented before, Microsoft 
Dynamics AX skills are currently in 
short supply and this has had the effect 
of increasing our costs. However, our 
Dynamics AX in-house training and use 
of Dynamics AX resources which we 
have established in near-shore locations 
will help to mitigate this. 
Our SYSPRO and Sage Division 
continued to generate high levels of 
recurring income and cash and the 
Division also saw strong software sales. 
New sales of our SYSPRO software also 
benefit our Managed Services Division 
as we are now delivering most of our 
new SYSPRO systems as part of a hosted 
cloud offering. Our Managed Services 
activities recorded a profit of £0.43m 
for the year compared to a loss of 
£0.56m last year. This reflected both the 
reorganisation and managerial changes 
we made in the Division and increasing 
sales of our products. The potential to 
develop significant recurring revenues 
from this activity, especially as we add 
new “ax|is” customers, remains exciting.
K3 continues to generate high levels 
of recurring revenues, principally from 
software licence renewals and support 
contracts, and as we grow our software 
product sales, this income stream 
will incrementally increase. Recurring 
revenues for the year amounted to 
£35.42m, accounting for 49% of K3’s 
total revenues (2013: £34.54m, 54%). 
Net debt at the year end was £13.63m, 
only marginally lower than at the same 
period last year. We anticipate that it 
will reduce in the new financial year 
as a result of significantly decreased 
exceptional costs and a further 
improvement in profitability. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2014

Financial Results
Revenues for the year ended 30 June 
2014 increased by 13% to £71.95m 
(2013: £63.51m), with revenues in the 
second half 17% ahead year-on-year 
at £37.48m (2013: £31.96m). Growth 
was largely driven by the improving 
performance of our Microsoft-based 
activities, including our traditional 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV business 
but most especially from our newer 
Microsoft Dynamics AX-based  
solution, “ax|is” . 
Adjusted profit from operations
*2
 over 
the year increased by 43% to £7.30m 
(2013: £5.09m). Adjusted profit from 
operations
*3
 in the second half year was 
up 72% year-on-year to £3.69m (2013: 
£2.15m). The performance in the second 
half was especially notable in a business 
which historically has been H1 weighted 
due to the profit arising on SYSPRO 
annual licence fee renewals.
Adjusted profit before tax
*1
 for the year 
ended 30 June 2014 increased by 51% 
to £6.60m (2013: £4.37m). Adjusted 
earnings per share
*4
 increased by 33% to 
18.6p (2013: 14.0p). 
This recovery came off the back of 
the significant software product 
development investment that the 
Group has been making which totalled 
£3.99m over the year (2013: £3.56m). 
The largest element, approximately 
£2.06m (2013: £1.45m), was related to 
our “ax|is” solution but we made further 
investment in our other products, 
including Dynamics NAV and SYSPRO, 
and in our sales channel products.
We incurred exceptional costs of £1.72m 
(2013: £0.73m). This principally related 
to: our decision to restructure our 
Microsoft UK Division and Managed 
Services Division to accelerate the return 
of these businesses to profitability; 
senior management changes and some 
restructuring of prior acquisitions. We 
do not expect major exceptional costs in 
the coming year.
Finance expenses were broadly flat 
at £0.70m (2013: £0.73m) as working 
capital requirements increased for the 
enlarged business.
We have recognised a deferred tax 
credit of £0.89m (2013: £0.65m) largely 
in respect of intangibles and together 
with the impact of lower profits and 
research and development credits (that 
are recognised only as claims are agreed 
with tax authorities), there is an overall 
tax credit of £0.68m in the year (2013: 
£0.78m).
Taking into account amortisation of 
intangibles of £2.99m (2013: £3.18m) 
and exceptional reorganisation costs 
of £1.72m (2013: £0.73m), profit from 
operations for the year more than 
doubled to £2.59m (2013: £1.19m). Profit 
before taxation rose 3.1 times to £1.89m 
(2013: £0.46m). Basic earnings per share 
increased by 91% to 8.2p (2013: 4.3p).

Cash flows and banking
K3 has traditionally generated good 
cash flows, with a seasonal weighting to 
October-December. This has continued 
to be the case, although a combination 
of exceptional costs and increased 
working capital as the business 
expanded into larger contracts has 
meant that cash generation has reduced 
from historical levels. We have seen a 
working capital outflow of £2.79m in 
the current year as the business grew, 
compared to an inflow of £1.51m in the 
prior year. Adding back the cash impact 
of exceptional costs the adjusted cash 
flow from operations
*5
 was £7.07m 
(2013: £8.66m), with cash generated 
from operations being £5.35m  
(2013: £8.02m). 
Whilst the Group made debt repayments 
of £2.31m (net), raised £0.28m from 
the issue of share capital as employees 
exercised share options, and received 
£0.29m of tax repayments (net) in the 
year, net debt at 30 June 2014 was only 
marginally lower at £13.63m (2013: 
£13.81m). A major factor in this was the 
investment in product development of 
£3.99m which has been fundamental 
to the order wins that have driven the 
current year profit improvement. As 
K3’s profitability improves further, and 
with significantly reduced exceptional 
costs, we expect the net debt position to 
improve significantly, whilst continuing 
our investment programme.
In August 2014 we agreed the extension 
of the Group’s banking facilities for 
three years through to August 2017 
on substantially the same terms as the 
existing facilities. 
Dividend
With the improving prospects for the 
Group, the Board is pleased to propose 
an increased final (and total) dividend 
for the financial year of 1.25p per share 
(2013: 1.0p). Subject to shareholder 
approval at K3’s General Meeting, this 
dividend will become payable on  
16 January 2015 to shareholders on  
the register on 12 December 2014. 
K3’s Annual General Meeting will be held 
on 26 November 2014 at 10.30am, at the 
Group’s head office at Baltimore House, 
50 Kansas Avenue, Manchester M50 2GL. 
Board Changes
In January 2014, we announced that 
after nearly 14 years as Chief Executive, 
Andy Makeham was leaving the Group 
and that Chief Finance Officer, David 
Bolton, who had led the Group’s 
expansion with Andy, was assuming the 
role of Chief Executive. On behalf of the 
Board, I am delighted to welcome David 
in his new role and to thank Andy for his 
significant contribution over the years. 
We appointed two new Non-executive 
Directors, Peter Cookson in July 2013 
and Paul Morland in May 2014. Peter, a 
chartered accountant, has many years’ 
experience in senior management 
and finance roles, especially in the 
technology and retail sectors. Paul 
Morland has a well-established track 
record in the Technology sector both in 
management and as an analyst. 
In June 2014, we announced that, after 
nine years as Non-executive Chairman 
of the Group, I would be retiring at 
K3’s forthcoming AGM. Plans for my 
succession are well advanced and the 
Board expects to announce further 
appointments in due course.
Outlook
The year has seen a strong recovery in 
the business with the initiatives we have 
taken in the development of intellectual 
property for the Retail sector paying 
dividends. The work we are now doing 
with Microsoft provides the opportunity 
for substantial further growth in our 
Microsoft Dynamics AX proposition, 
supported by a stable and profitable 
underlying business. Whilst further 
investment will be required to exploit 
the opportunity fully, I am confident 
that K3 is well placed to do this in 
future years. With a strong pipeline of 
opportunities ahead, the outlook for K3 
is particularly encouraging.

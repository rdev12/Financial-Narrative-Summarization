 The investment in data will crucially provide greater insight 
into the commercial opportunities across the group in 2015 
and beyond. These initiatives will deliver further efficiency 
and scale benefits as the group continues to grow.
Alongside the operational initiatives completed in 
2014, the group completed two strategic transactions 
in June 2014. The resolution of the Econsultancy 
earn-out removed the final obstacle to an integrated 
Marketing portfolio. This portfolio is now fully focused on 
accelerating the pace of growth. The disposal of Perfect 
Information, a single format business with limited overlap 
with other parts of the business and limited potential  
for growth without significant investment, reduced 
leverage and provided capacity for further targeted 
investment elsewhere.
This Annual Report will be the last overseen by our 
Chairman Patrick Taylor. He has served this business 
tirelessly and diligently for 11 years. The business has 
undergone an extraordinary evolution in that time and we 
all thank him for his contribution and commitment. On a 
personal note, I am very grateful that he has given me the 
opportunity to lead Centaur Media.
The changes made over the 18 months to December 2014 
have been far-reaching but the business has responded 
exceptionally well. We end the period with a stronger 
balance sheet, a structure that is fit for purpose and 
a sharp focus on innovation and progress in our core 
markets. Our performance in the second half of 2014 has 
been particularly strong, and we are very encouraged by 
the outlook for 2015. 
The business feels reinvigorated and positive. We have 
achieved a lot - and we have only just begun.

Chief Executive’s Report
 
In the face of the most severe global economic downturn in recent 
years the focus for 2009 was necessarily improving profitability, cash 
flow and developing recurring revenue streams. Growth was 
inevitably affected by capital expenditure freezes within much of our 
customer base as well as by the continuing squeeze on available 
debt finance. Underlying operational profitability before exceptional 
items improved as a result of tough cost reductions. These actions 
will continue to improve profitability and cash flow and will ensure 
that full advantage can be taken in any future economic upturn.
Financial Performance Review and Key Performance Indicators
The Group recorded an overall loss before taxation of £599,000 
(2008: loss of £484,000) which was significantly impacted by 
£1,005,000 of exceptional items. This mostly related to £801,000 of 
restructuring costs reflecting cost-cutting programmes in our 
manufacturing operation, and the closure of our Spanish office. 
Whilst an increasing loss is disappointing, the exceptional costs 
incurred were necessary to allow the Group to meet the twin 
challenges of a business in transition and a difficult economic 
environment. Levels of cost remain under review at all times; 
however, the main foreseeable restructuring costs have now been 
incurred.
The early action taken on cost reduction reduced overhead costs by 
9% to £4,454,000 (2008: £4,882,000) and provided the platform for 
a 45% increase in operating profit, before exceptional items, to 
£750,000 (2008: £516,000). This was against the disappointment of 
a revenue decrease of 12.5% resulting from the economic recession. 
Despite this, gross margins grew to 35.9% from 32.6% in the prior 
year. Operating margin, before exceptional items, rose to 5.1% from 
3.1% in 2008 and is moving towards our goal of exceeding 10%. 
Profit before tax and exceptional items increased by 149% to 
£406,000 (2008: £163,000).
The 53% growth in EBITDA (as calculated in note 2) from £1,208,000 
to £1,845,000 demonstrates that progress continues to be made in 
improving operational cash generation. Investment in fixed assets 
over the last two years has changed the Group’s cost structure, 
increasing the total depreciation and amortisation charge by 
£403,000 from the prior year. Whilst investment will continue, the 
asset base is now in place that will allow the Group to deliver 
growth.
The Board will continue to monitor revenue change, operating profit, 
cash generation and customer satisfaction as key performance 
indicators. Service excellence has become an essential element in 
customer relationships with demands for improved service level 
agreement (SLA) targets being widespread. Overall SLAs for 2009 
were 94% (2008: 96%) which are above contractual requirements. 
Contracted service revenues are a key element of PFS sales and 
requests from an increasing number of customers are being made 
for a 24/7 service.
Universe Data Systems (UDS)
The segmental reporting breakdown shows an increase in revenue 
of 63% for the year to £3,086,000 (2008: £1,885,000) which in turn 
drove segmental profit to £959,000 (2008: loss of £69,000).
During the later part of 2008 UDS began the roll-out of what is 
believed to be the largest and only truly global real time loyalty 
scheme. Early 2009 saw the web based system go live in four 
European countries with licence arrangements for more to come on 
stream in future periods. In excess of 100 million transactions have 
been processed by our data centre for the first year and significant 
ongoing revenue streams will accrue from the initial five year 
agreement.
Currently the PCIDSS approved data centre handles £8 billion worth 
of transactions per year and has loyalty schemes with up to 14 
million members operating in a real time environment. HTEC 
provides Mission Critical Services to two of the UK’s supermarket 
groups and four of the major oil companies, either in the UK or 
Europe.
Progress has been made during the year to establish UDS outside 
the petrol and oil industry. Partnerships and alliances with market 
specialists are continuing to introduce exciting new opportunities as 
UDS is positioned as a data handling platform in the extended 
loyalty and customer relationship management (CRM) space.
Long sales cycles remain a feature of loyalty systems projects but a 
growing number of interesting opportunities are now presenting 
themselves, which indicate strong future potential based on a 
recurring revenue model. The SaaS (software as a service) model of 
operation gives increasing benefits to both customer and supplier 
as utilisation of capacity increases.
During the year, development was completed on the automatic 
number plate recognition software (ANPR) range enabling 
agreements to be signed with five channel partners in the latter part 
of 2009. The HTEC data centre can hold and process data with 
reference to a central database for partners dependent on the 
application. The rapidly increasing market for surveillance and 
security products will provide a growing sales channel for future 
years. The ANPR product range now includes forecourt drive off 
control, car park barrier control, visitor systems and a central on-line 
warning list database.

Petrol Forecourt Systems (PFS)
The PFS business segment produced £1,644,000 (2008: £2,486,000) 
of profit and remains the Group’s largest and most profitable 
segment despite a 25% fall in turnover. Prior year sales and profit 
benefited from a major supermarket payment terminal roll-out but 
excluding that, underlying sales were up 15% compared to 2008. 
Recurring contract business is in excess of 70% of turnover for this 
segment.
The core solutions of the PFS business relate to the supply of point of 
sale (POS) payment systems and wet stock management reporting.
HTEC has occupied a prominent position in the UK forecourt 
managed services market for a number of years and its systems 
currently run the petrol forecourts of two major supermarket chains 
and over 33% of all UK forecourts have HTEC equipment on them. 
Development of the software continues in order to improve 
functionality for the growing convenience store market, and to allow 
easier integration with other third party products.
HTEC has a wide range of end to end approvals to handle bank and 
fuel payment cards and will continue to be a market leader for this 
type of payment processing. HTEC’s payment terminals are 
recognised as some of the most secure within the industry, meeting 
the challenges posed constantly from card fraud criminals. 
Investment in the next generation payment terminal which will begin 
roll-out in 2010 has been carefully controlled to give a rapid payback 
to the Group.
Disappointingly, 2010 saw a fall in turnover as customers cut back 
on new project spending. I can however report that we renewed a 
significant long-term contract with Morrisons for enhanced services 
supporting its store IT replacement project.
New outdoor payment terminal roll-outs were particularly badly 
affected last year as capital expenditure plans were put on hold. 
This product is however now opening up new markets related to 
airfields, marinas and commercial truck stops.
Manufacturing (CEM)
The traditional core business of HTEC, subcontract design and 
manufacture, has over a number of years been in decline. 
Continued monitoring showed that although it was loss making at 
the pre-tax level, it did have a positive contribution to fixed 
overheads so an immediate disposal was ruled out as impractical 
because of the requirement to supply components for other 
segments of the Group.
Revenue continued to decline in 2009 to £2,056,000 (2008: 
£3,263,000). Whilst the cost base was significantly reduced to 
ensure a positive contribution to fixed overheads, a loss at the 
operating profit level was recorded of £97,000 (2008: loss 
£120,000). Encouragingly the economic challenges last year have 
actually benefited this part of the business and new customers are 
creating welcome opportunities early in 2010.
JetSet
The financial crisis which began in 2008 continued to seriously affect 
the JetSet business. The market became increasingly tough as 
capital expenditure was cut back and asset finance to support 
machine placement was still both difficult to obtain and 
unreasonably expensive. Despite the conditions, turnover increased 
by 31% to £1,933,000 (2008: £1,475,000). However, due to having to 
operate the production facility in Bedford at below capacity, 
operating losses increased to £241,000 (2008: loss of £181,000), 
particularly weighted to the earlier part of the year.
By Q4 of 2009 JetSet was EBITDA positive and, with an improved 
trading environment, has a high expectation of achieving regular 
and sustainable profitable trading. Visibility of potential prestigious 
future contracts with existing Group customers demonstrates that 
the business has growth potential assuming new asset funding 
avenues are available.
The concept of revenue share from equipment owned by JetSet and 
sited on the customers’ premises has already resulted in the 
winning of contracts from customers such as ASDA, Co-op and BP, 
clearly demonstrating the cross selling opportunity from other 
Universe business units.
Prior year adjustment in respect of Goodwill
The introduction of IFRS8 on Segmental Reporting has required the 
Group to allocate the historic goodwill associated with the HTEC 
subsidiary (£17.3 million) across the operating segments contained 
within HTEC. A significant proportion of this goodwill (£6.3 million) 
has necessarily been allocated to the historic Manufacturing 
segment. The requirement to allocate goodwill to the segments is a 
change of accounting policy and consequently must be applied 
retrospectively, resulting in the allocation being made as at
1st January 2007. Cash flow forecasts for the segment, at that time, 
would not support the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to 
Manufacturing and consequently an impairment provision of £5.1 
million would have been required had impairment been measured 
on a segmental basis in 2007. Consequently, a £5.1 million provision 
has been booked in 2009 and treated as a prior year adjustment.

Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Banking Facilities and Going Concern
During 2009 the priority has been to generate cash and to improve 
the debt repayment profile of the Group’s borrowings. By the year 
end net borrowings (debt less cash) had dropped from £3.2 million 
to £2.5 million, and the repayment profile had improved significantly, 
with 73% of net borrowings due in more than one year (2008: 45%). 
Debt repayment will remain a significant drain on the Group’s cash 
flow in 2010, with scheduled repayments due of £858,000, but this 
debt repayment burden is scheduled to drop significantly in 2011.
Overall the Group generated £1.1 million of cash during the period. 
Clearly the negotiation of a new long-term loan from our bankers 
was a significant part of that, but in reality most of these proceeds 
served to refresh facilities that have been paid down over the last 
two years on an accelerated schedule. Net proceeds from financing 
activities were £371,000, with the balance of the cash arising from 
£1.4 million generated by the operation, net of the £707,000 
invested into software product development and an expansion of 
the JetSet revenue share estate.
During the year the Group breached one of its banking covenants, in 
respect of the net worth of the Group which has been significantly 
impacted by the goodwill impairment referred to above. All other 
covenants were met, and the breach has been subsequently waived 
by HBOS. HBOS has also agreed to remove covenants from both 
loans going forward, and compliance with the loan terms now rests 
on the ability to repay loan instalments as they fall due. The Directors 
have reviewed financial forecasts for the business covering the 12 
months from the date of this report and are confident that the 
repayment schedule will be satisfied and that the Group will be able 
to operate within its current banking facilities. As a result, the 
Directors have continued to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Outlook
The strategy of the management team is to grow and transform the 
Group from lower margin product sale and manufacturing activity to 
a software and services business with associated recurring revenue 
targeted at tier 1 businesses. Dealing with the burdensome debt 
structure, limited funding for investment and an inappropriate 
operational structure has been a difficult task. Restructuring 
write-offs have been higher than expected and new product 
development has been hindered by ongoing support requirements 
from legacy products.
2010 sees us go into a year where the cost structure has been 
significantly improved by the actions taken in 2008/9, new products 
have been added to the portfolio and the economy is emerging 
from a deep recession. The Group is now better placed to deliver 
growth and profitability. 2010 will see further debt reduction and by 
the end of this year our debt repayment profile will have improved 
significantly.
The sales pipeline for UDS continues to grow and strategic 
partnerships within the loyalty/CRM field are beginning to generate 
significant new opportunities. The PFS business is maintaining its 
market leading position and is seeing growth opportunities from its 
major customers. JetSet has the potential to move into profit this year 
and reach critical mass for equipment placements.

Lance Bradley, Sales Director at Mitsubishi
“Smartnav is unlike other satellite navigation systems, in that it is supported by operators who
are able to find an address, even if you don’t have the full details. You are also able to safely
download a route whilst you are on the move, which can help people save time. Above all it
uses the most accurate traffic information available, enabling drivers to automatically avoid
the traffic jams.” 
Smartnav was standard on the Mitsubishi L200 Animal and Shogun Warrior 
short wheel base throughout 2005
Kenyon Neads, Marketing Director at Isuzu UK
“This standard offering comes after the success of fitting Smartnav to the limited edition 
Rodeo Denver Max. This vehicle is used from builders to holiday-makers towing caravans 
and Smartnav was an extremely popular addition. It helps prevent them from getting lost,
directs them around traffic jams, warns them of speed cameras and provides protection if the 
vehicle is stolen. It's a great asset to businesses too as it increases productivity and prevents
excessive downtime. It helps the money roll in, in fact!” 
Smartnav fitted as standard on the Isuzu Rodeo Denver Max 
from January 2006 to December 2006

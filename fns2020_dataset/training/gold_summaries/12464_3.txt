Dear shareholders, 
2013 was another year of progress for PPHE Hotel 
Group. This was achieved against a very strong 
p ri o r 	 y e a r 	 c o mp a ra t iv e , 	 as 	 w e 	 b e n e fi t e d 	 i n 	 20 1 2	
from the London Olympic Games, and despite 
the remaining challenging conditions in some  
of the markets in which we operate. We focused 
on what we do best: giving our customers 
exemplary service at our segment-leading hotels 
which are located in key travel destinations. As  
a result, we were able to increase our revenue 
year on year. Our teams, aided by our ongoing 
investment in training, continued to deliver 
exceptional service, with service satisfaction 
among our guests increasing once again. 
One of our most exciting developments 
during the year was the opening of our new 
fl a g s h i p	a r t ’ o t e l	a m s t e r d a m,	w h i c h	h a s	b e e n	
very well received by the market. 
We acquired the freehold interests in two 
previously leased art’otels in Berlin, with 
a view to maximise returns by renovating and 
repositioning both hotels. In January this year 
we entered into a 50:50 joint venture in relation 
to these hotels. Our development pipeline  
was further strengthened by an exciting new 
acqu isiti on 	 o f 	 an 	 o f fi ce 	 bu i ldin g 	 in 	 London,	 
near Waterloo Station, where we plan to 
develop a hotel with over 400 rooms.
In December, we completed the largest

b e n e fi t s	a n d	a l s o	e n a b l e s	u s	t o	e m b a r k	o n	 
an extensive renovation programme across 
some of our core properties. We have an 
exciting journey ahead of us, which will further 
solidify our already strong position in some  
of Europe’s preferred investor and travel 
markets such as London and Amsterdam. 
For the last two years the Board has 
recommended the payment of an interim and 
fin a l 	 divi dend 	 o f 	 6. 0 	 pence 	 per 	 sh ar e 	 m akin g 	 a	
total of 12.0 pence per share for each year. 
The Board is proposing the payment of an 
ELI PAPOUCHADO
CHAIRMAN 
incr e ased 	 fi n a l 	 divi dend 	 o f 	 8. 0 	 pence 	 per 	 sh ar e ,	
which when combined with the interim dividend 
of 6.0 pence per share paid on 11 October 2013, 
amounts to a total dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2013 of 14.0 pence per share,  
an increase of 16.7%. The increased dividend 
r e flec t s 	 the 	 Bo ar d’ s 	 con fi dence 	 in 	 the 	 s tr en gth	
of the business and in respect of future years 
the Board expects to follow a progressive 
dividend policy. 
Looking ahead, we will focus on the delivery  
of the projects in our development pipeline.  
We have four active new hotel projects, three in 
London and one in Germany, plus the extension 
a n d 	 r e c o n fi gu ra t i o n 	 o f 	 P a rk 	 Pl aza 	 R iv e rb a n k	
London, and two rebranding projects which  
are expected to add over 1,200 rooms by the 
end of 2017 , representing approximately a 15% 
increase on our current number of rooms. 
Additional new projects are also being 
considered. Our investment in these new 
projects and an extensive planned refurbishment 
of our existing estate is expected to exceed 
€ 1 30 . 0 	 m i l l i o n 	 a n d 	 wi l l 	 l e a d 	 t o 	 l o n g- t e rm 	 b e n e fi ts .	
The Company continues to consider options of 
how to best fund future expansion, including the 
release of part of the value of hotel assets, while 
retaining operational control.
2014 will be a very special year for PPHE Hotel 
Group as we will be celebrating the start of a 
25-year journey that has taken us from acquiring 
Park Plaza Eindhoven in 1989 through to 
establishing a high quality hotel portfolio, 
world-class brands and strong operating 
performances. We will commemorate this feat 
with several festivities planned throughout the 
year for guests, partners and employees. I take 
personal pride in what we have been able to 
achieve and I am thrilled about the future 
prospects of our Group.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
the Board for their guidance and all our teams 
for their great work in what was a challenging, 
but rewarding year.

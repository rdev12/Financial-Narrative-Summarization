of total revenue (2014: 80%)

Company now has 200 hosted customers (2014: 184), demonstrating
the success of its strategy to grow the hosting/cloud side of the business

margin of 8.9% (2014: 10.0%)

£425,000, generating a profit on disposal of £117 ,000 and annualised

30 September 2015 (2014: £5.0 million) will be used to further develop
the business
> Final dividend 3.0p per share, meaning overall dividend maintained
at 5.0p for the full year
> Future dividends will be reviewed according to acquisition opportunities
and the overall cash position at the time. However, in view of the
Company’s relatively large cash balances, it is the Board’s current
intention to pay an interim dividend of 2p per share and a final dividend
of 3p per share in future years

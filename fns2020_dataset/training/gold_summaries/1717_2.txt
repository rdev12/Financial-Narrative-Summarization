We have more than 20 years’
experience in the development,
manufacture, marketing and sales
of in vitro diagnostic products.
In collaboration with scientiﬁc
institutions and companies
throughout the world, we have
brought several unique products
to the market. In our Point-of-
Care Division these include
Thrombotest™, Lymphoprep™
and the NycoCard
®
product
portfolio.
“I am very conﬁdent that the infrastructure 
we have built up in our company will deliver
sustainable growth and proﬁtability”
Svein Lien, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
Our new AFINION™ system for decentralised
in vitro diagnostic testing is expected to
make an important contribution to diagnosis
at the point of care, allowing doctors to test
for various biochemical parameters during
patient consultation.
Using ﬁnger prick whole blood, the
AFINION™ instrument will provide laboratory
quality results for a number of tests within
3-5 minutes. The planned test menu
includes several markers that currently are
not available on other point-of-care
systems. The system was launched at MEDICA
in November 2004.
Our Laboratory Division has a
number of important patented
markers, including homocysteine,
conﬁgured to run on many
different platforms. 
Sales take place worldwide
through OEM’s and regional
distributors and products are also
sold through our own direct
selling operations in the UK and
in Scandinavia (Medinor), and
through Plasmatec (in developing
countries).
We work mainly in the following disease areas:
Cardiovascular 
Alcohol-related 
Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Infectious diseases 
Diabetes 
Vitamin B
12 deﬁciency
We are also exploring opportunities in dementia
and cerebrovascular disease, including
Alzheimer’s disease. In this context our new
test for Holo-TC looks very promising, as a more
effective way of determining vitamin B
12 status.
Malabsorption of vitamin B
12
has been linked
to some forms of neurodegenerative disease.
Our direct distribution units are
independent organisations
working on an arms-length 
basis. In addition to selling our
in-house products, they also
distribute a large number of
third-party products.
At present two thirds of revenues from these
units are derived from distribution
agreements for non-Axis-Shield products,
and this is therefore an important part of
the business of these units. Our Nordic and
UK regional organisations can offer their
customers total solutions and in addition
build important business relationships with
other companies in the market.

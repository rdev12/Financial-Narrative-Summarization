 strategic report
I am pleased to report a positive set of results for 2014, 
which are in line with the Board’s expectations.
Revenue continues to show steady 
growth, along with a small expected 
decline in EBITDA as a result of the 
additional costs associated with being 
a public company. Cash generated 
from operating activities was strong 
notwithstanding continued significant 
investment in the future growth of 
the business.
The move to public company status 
continues to be well received by the 
Isle of Man Government and our 
customers, providing ownership 
certainty, greater transparency  
and more opportunities to grow.
During the year, our domestic business 
has performed well, with growth in 
both the core fixed, broadband and 
data business and also the data 
centre business. We have continued to 
invest in our infrastructure, both to 
facilitate further growth and also to 
defend our market position. We 
completed Phase I of our data centre 
investment programme which has 
provided an additional 100 racks to 
our estate, and rolled out a 4G mobile 
network across the Isle of Man to 
reach 99% of the population. We have 
continued the roll out of fibre across 
the Island and can now reach 87% of 
homes. More recently, we have 
announced the roll-out of superfast 
broadband for 50% of the homes and 
businesses on the Island, reaching 
speeds of up to 80Mbps and the 
launch of 4G to our pre-paid 
customers. An increased focus on 
global solutions saw a good return.
The regulatory and economic 
environment on the Island remains 
supportive for the growth of the 
business. The local economy continues 
to grow, with low levels of 
unemployment (c.2%) and a continued 
commitment to maintaining the current 
policy on taxation (0% corporation tax) 
and incentives to attract high net 
worth individuals to the Island.
Our people
The good performance of the business 
in 2014 is a testament to the excellent 
customer service, experience and 
professionalism of everyone involved 
in Manx Telecom. We launched our 
first share save scheme to all 
employees during 2014 and received 
an excellent take-up of over 80%, 
enabling the vast majority of our 
people to benefit from the continued 
success of Manx Telecom.
Following the recent announcement of 
Mike Dee’s intention to retire in H2 2015 
I wish to thank Mike for 31 years’ service 
and commitment to Manx Telecom. He 
will leave the Company well positioned 
for the future and recruitment for his 
successor has commenced.
Dividend policy
The Company paid its maiden  
interim dividend of 3.3p per share  
in November 2014 and intends to  
pay a final dividend of 6.6p on  
25 June 2015. The full year dividend of 
9.9p represents a 7% yield at the IPO 
price and is in line with the policy 
communicated when the Company 
was admitted to AIM. The shares will 
trade ex-dividend on 28 May 2015 and 
will have a record date of 29 May 2015.
As previously stated, the Company 
intends to operate a progressive 
dividend policy moving forward  
taking into account our profitability, 
underlying growth in earnings and 
cash flows.
Outlook
The Company remains committed to 
our dual strategy of defending our 
significant on-island presence, whilst 
seeking off-island opportunities to 
exploit and leverage our data centre 
and mobile infrastructure.
After a slower than anticipated start, 
demand for our data centre services 
has increased and we have signed an 
agreement with an anchor tenant for 
our data centre Phase II expansion.
2014 was a particularly strong year for 
global solutions and we do not expect 
this area to record the same level of 
growth in 2015, however we remain 
encouraged by its growth potential.
We continue to invest significantly in our 
on-island infrastructure, demonstrating 
our continued commitment to the 
Island community.
We remain committed to delivering a 
progressive dividend in 2015 and 
confident in the longer term growth 
prospects of the business.

The Company remains committed to creating shareholder value 
through our dual strategy of defending our significant on-island 
presence, whilst seeking off-island opportunities to exploit and leverage 
our data centre and mobile infrastructure. During 2014, we successfully 
followed this strategy and will strive to do the same through 2015.
 We are delighted to be paying a final dividend of 6.6p, meeting the 
commitment given when the Company was admitted to AIM in 
February 2014. Together with the interim dividend, this constitutes  
a 7% yield for the full year based on our IPO placing price of 142p.
 Following the recent announcement of Mike Dee’s intention to retire  
in H2 2015 I wish to thank Mike for 31 years’ service and commitment  
to Manx Telecom. He will leave the Company well positioned for  
the future and recruitment for his successor has commenced.

“ 
We have made good progress over the year, with revenue 
growth driven by strong sales in global solutions, as well as 
positive take-up of high speed broadband on the Island. 
After a slower than anticipated start, the Greenhill Data 
Centre now has a number of new local customers ready to 
move in. This, and the continuing success of 4G, gives us 
confidence in the year ahead. 
”
Following the IPO in February 2014,  
we have continued to focus on our 
core business of providing a wide 
range of communications services to 
consumers, businesses and the public 
sector on the Isle of Man. We have also 
continued to expand our data centre 
footprint and have had success in the 
local market for high value managed 
services contracts.
Our global solutions business 
continues to show good growth, 
utilising our various mobile virtual 
network operator (‘MVNO’) and 
international roaming relationships  
to address the international traveller 
market, as well as exploiting the 
opportunities arising from the 
increasing penetration of connected 
devices in the M2M market.
We continue to focus on providing a 
superior customer experience  
which, coupled with a reliable and 
trustworthy reputation, has enabled 
us to retain high market share in the 
local fixed, broadband and mobile 
markets despite increased competition.
Overall revenue has grown by 4.2% in 
the year driven primarily by growth in 
the global solutions business, helped 
by our move into managed services 
and an increased sales focus.
EBITDA of £27.1m has decreased by 
1.5%, as expected, due to the additional 
costs of being a public company. There 
has been a slight decline in EBITDA 
margin in the year, mainly driven by 
the mix of business within global 
solutions, with an increase in sales of 
lower margin wholesale voice and 
SMS. We remain committed to focusing 
on higher margin business across the 
Group, with an emphasis on sales of 
Chameleon SIMs and M2M within 
global solutions and a drive towards 
managed hosting sales within the data 
centre business.
Cash generation remains strong and 
we remain committed to a progressive 
dividend policy.
We have been successful in meeting 
our targets for key capital projects in 
the year including completion of Phase 
I of the new data centre and the 
launch of all Island 4G coverage. We 
have achieved this within the capital 
budget set at the start of the year. The 
4G launch has been highly successful 
with take up and usage exceeding our 
initial expectations. Pre-paid 4G 
services were launched in early 2015.
Whilst the contracts and associated 
revenues for Phase I of GDC have taken 
longer than expected to complete,  
we have now successfully signed new 
contracts with key corporate customers 
and the Government, and as a result 
have started to generate data services 
revenues from this increased capacity. 
We are looking to develop Phase II of 
the data centre later in 2015, given we 
now have an agreement signed with 
an anchor tenant.

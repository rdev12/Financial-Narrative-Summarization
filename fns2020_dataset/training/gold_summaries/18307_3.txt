Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased that with 
the newly refreshed 
Board, we have a strong 
and experienced team 
to support and guide 
the Group.”
John Nicholas, Chairman
I was delighted to be appointed Chairman of 
your Company in January of this year , following 
the retirement of John Rennocks from the 
Board. During his ten years as Chairman, John 
guided the Company through an extended 
period of strong and sustained growth which 
delivered excellent returns to shareholders. I 
hope that in the years ahead I will be able to 
maintain this performance through executing 
the Group’s strategy which is designed to 
deliver strong, double-digit growth in earnings 
and shareholder value over the economic cycle.
Shortly after my appointment, in June of this 
year, the Board met at the facility of Kubo, our 
newly acquired Seals business in Switzerland, 
to review the Group’s strategy and to set 
targets and objectives for each of the Group’s 
Sectors to be delivered over the next three 
years. After a number of presentations 
and thorough and challenging reviews 
with Executive management, the Board 
was unanimous in supporting the Group’s 
existing strategy of building larger, broader 
based businesses in our three Sectors. This 
strategy aims to generate stable “GDP plus” 
organic revenue growth over the business 
cycle, sustainable attractive margins and 
strong cash flow. The Board also confirmed 
the ambition of accelerating growth through 
an active acquisition programme, utilising 
the Group’s strong cash resources and 
experienced management to enhance value. 
In September , Iain Henderson informed us of 
his decision to step down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the AGM in January 2016 and 
after an orderly handover of responsibilities, to 
retire from the Company on 31 March 2016. Iain 
has been a key member of the Board since 
1998 and as Chief Operating Officer since 2005, 
has played a significant role in developing and 
implementing the strategy of the Group and in 
particular , the Seals and Controls Sector 
businesses. The Board will miss Iain’s wise 
counsel and robust approach to the day-to-day 
operational challenges that face all businesses. 
All of us in the Group wish him a long, healthy 
and well-earned retirement.
The Board is very supportive of the decision by 
our CEO, Bruce Thompson to establish over 
the coming year , a formal Executive 
Management Group (“EMG”) which will report 
to him. The EMG will comprise the key senior 
managers of the main business clusters and 
certain Group functions. Good progress has 
already been achieved with this development 
and two senior level recruits have recently 
joined the Group to strengthen management 
in key areas. The Board remains confident that 
the formation of this EMG over the course of 
2016 will provide Diploma PLC with a strong 
and experienced group of senior business and 
financial managers who have the potential to 
provide leadership in the coming years. 
 
Results
Group revenues increased in 2015 by 9% to 
£333.8m (2014: £305.8m), with acquisitions 
completed during the year contributing 
£24.2m and adverse currency movements 
reducing the results of the overseas 
businesses when translated into UK sterling 
by £8. 1m, when compared with last year. After 
adjusting for the contribution from these and 
prior year acquisitions and for currency effects 
on translation, Group revenues increased by 
1% on an underlying basis. Steady underlying 
revenue growth of ca.4% in both the Life 
Sciences and Seals Sectors more than offset a 
weaker performance from the Controls Sector 
where underlying revenues declined by 5% 
against a strong prior year comparative.
 
Adjusted operating margins remained robust 
at 18. 1% (2014: 18.5%) and adjusted operating 
profit increased by 6% to £60.3m (2014: 
£56.7m). Gross margins in the Canadian and 
Australian Healthcare businesses were again 
impacted by transactional currency effects, 
but this was partly mitigated by a more 
favourable product mix and strong control 
over operating costs. Adjusted profit before 
tax increased by 6% to £59 .6m (2014: £56.2m) 
and adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) also 
increased by 6% to 38.2p (2014: 36. 1p).
The Group generated strong free cash 
flow of £40.3m (2014: £37 .8m), with tighter 
control over working capital providing record 
operating cash flow of £62. 1m (2014: £55.0m). 
Capital expenditure increased to £4.3m 
(2014: £2.2m) with increased investment in 
productive capital represented by facilities, 
healthcare field equipment and seal cutting 
machinery and tooling.  03

It was a much stronger year for acquisition 
activity with the Group investing £37 .8m 
(2014: £16.5m) in new businesses during the 
financial year, extending the Group’s activities 
into new products and geographies in line 
with the Group’s strategic objectives. Shortly 
after the year end the Group completed the 
acquisition of WCIS, an established supplier 
of sealing products and services in Australia 
for a maximum consideration of £9 .8m. The 
WCIS acquisition is another example of how 
the Group uses acquisitions to extend and 
broaden its activities into new markets and 
geographies. 
The much higher spend on acquisitions in this 
financial year, together with distributions of 
£19 .7m (2014: £18.2m) to shareholders during 
the year, contributed to a reduction in net cash 
funds of £18.3m in the year to £3.0m at 30 
September 2015 (2014: £21.3m). 
Dividends
The robust balance sheet and strong free 
cash flow, together with a more favourable 
acquisition environment, has led the Board to 
recommend an increase in the final dividend 
of 7% to 12.4p per share (2014: 11.6p). Subject 
to shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, this dividend will be paid on 27 
January 2016 to shareholders on the register 
at 27 November 2015.
The total dividend per share for the year will  
be 18.2p (2014: 17 .0p) which represents a 7% 
increase on 2014. The dividend is well covered 
by adjusted EPS at 2. 1 times, in line with the 
Board’s objective of targeting towards a two 
times level of cover.
Governance
We have this year completed the process of 
developing and refreshing the Board started  
by my predecessor in 2013. In February we 
strengthened the Board’s resources with 
the appointment of Andy Smith as a non-
Executive Director. Andy brings excellent 
experience to the Company having previously 
held Group HR roles at Severn T rent PLC and 
The Boots Company PLC. 
I was also pleased that Anne Thorburn 
accepted our invitation to join the Board in 
September. Anne brings to the Company 
many years of experience gained from Board 
level finance roles in listed international 
industrial companies. Anne will replace Marie-
Louise Clayton as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, when she retires from the Board 
this month at the end of her term of office. I 
wish to thank Marie-Louise for the support 
and guidance she has provided to the Board 
during the past three years.
I am pleased that with the newly refreshed 
Board, we have a strong and experienced 
team to support and guide the Group as it 
pursues the successful implementation of the 
Group’s growth strategy . 
 
Employees
Since being appointed Chairman earlier this 
year, I have endeavoured to visit the Group’s 
businesses and meet our employees who 
are so important to the success of the Group. 
I have been impressed by the hard work and 
loyalty that our employees demonstrate to 
each of their businesses and I wish to thank 
them for their efforts this year to deliver a high 
level of service as they strive to meet targets 
in the face of challenging markets.
Outlook
The Group’s strong and proven business model 
delivered robust growth this year , benefitting 
from a good contribution from acquisitions and 
despite adverse exchange rate movements. 
This balance is expected to continue into 
the coming financial year as the economic 
headwinds continue to constrain organic 
growth in the Group’s principal markets in 
North America and Europe, but prospects for 
further acquisitions remain promising.
While the Board remains cautious on the 
current macroeconomic backdrop, we remain 
confident that the Group’s resilient business 
model with a diverse geographic spread 
of activities and strong financial position, 
together with a more favourable environment 
for acquisitions will provide a good platform to 
deliver further growth in the coming year.

 Group Chief Executive’s Review
2015 Overview
I am pleased to report that after the 
slower first half we continued to execute 
our strategy and worked tirelessly 
across the whole business to deliver a 
strong second half performance and 
what was ultimately a full year operating 
profit result higher than the property 
market peak of 2007.
We delivered on our financial 
commitments made at the time of the 
2015 interim results announced in 
August 2015 and I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all my colleagues 
across our business for delivering a 
record breaking result.
Group revenue increased by 4.6% to 
£300.6m (2014: £287.5m) with strong 
second half growth of 8.7%. Group 
Underlying Operating Profit increased by 
2% to a record £42.9m (2014: £42.0m), 
with double digit profit growth in the 
second half in both the Estate Agency 
and Surveying Divisions.
Duty changes. There was little market 
recovery in prime Central London post the 
General Election.
Average house prices
2
 in England and 
Wales grew 6.6% to £292,000 annually 
as stock shortages continued to have an 
impact. Excluding London and the South 
East, the average increase was 4.7%.
Residential property values in Greater 
London increased by 5.6%. Prime Central 
London (5 prime boroughs) fell by 8.7% 
impacted by a range of factors including the 
impact of the December 2014 Stamp Duty 
changes. Outside the top five prime Central 
London boroughs, London experienced an 
11% increase in year-on-year house prices.
The proportion of mortgage lending in 
the market placed through intermediaries 
continued to increase during the year

. 
Following market declines in the 
repossessions market in the past few 
years, market volumes again declined in 
2015, reducing by 51% to 10,200
4
 total 
repossessions as interest rates remained low.
Strategy
We remain committed to the strategy we 
communicated in March 2015. The key 
components of our strategy are:
Estate Agency
•  Drive operating profit per branch to 
between £80,000 and £100,000 in the 
medium term
•  Expand the number of Marsh & Parsons 
branches to a total of 36 by 2019, 
particularly outside prime Central London

The Market in 2015
The UK residential property services market 
in 2015 was a story of two halves.
As we reported at the 2015 interim results, 
the first quarter of 2015 faced very strong 
comparatives relative to the first quarter of 
2014, which was a period characterised by 
strong growth ahead of the implementation 
of the Mortgage Market Review. The 
second quarter of 2015 was impacted by 
uncertainty around the General Election. 
As a result, in the first half of 2015 house 
purchase approvals were down by 3.3% 
year-on-year
1
.
In the second half of 2015, there was a 
modest recovery in the market following 
the General Election and the comparatives 
were against a slowing market in 2014. 
Over the full year therefore house purchase 
approvals increased by 4.7%.
Total Mortgage Approvals
1
 increased by 
8.4% in 2015. This reflected a flat first 
half with accelerating market sentiment 
and volume growth in the second half in 
both approvals for house purchases 
which are typically three months 
before completion and also in 
remortgage approvals.
The prime Central London 
market in 2015 was 
impacted by a range of 
factors including the 
December 2014 Stamp

LSL performance in 2015
Estate Agency Division
Total Estate Agency income of £236.5m 
(2014: £225.3m) increased by 5%. This 
increase resulted from the consistent 
execution of our strategy in 2015.
We continue to adapt our approach to 
maintain competitiveness. We launched 
the Your Move national media campaign 
in January 2016, moving the focus of 
our advertising spend away from more 
traditional local media. The campaign “it 
pays to be with Your Move”, underlines the 
customer value from using an estate agent 
with Your Move’s reach and size.
In 2016, we will continue to focus on further 
improving the digital communication with 
our customers and to improve the customer 
experience.
Residential Sales exchange income
Residential Sales exchange income grew 
1% during the year. Whilst in the first half 
income fell by 5% reflecting the market 
conditions, the second half performance 
was strong with 7% growth, reflecting 
market stabilisation post the General 
Election and the investments we made 
in Estate Agency in the first half. Total 
exchange units were broadly flat in 2015 
with an increase in fees per unit largely on 
the back of house price inflation.
Recurring Lettings income
We remain committed to our strategy 
of increasing recurring Lettings income. 
In 2015 we delivered growth in Lettings 
income of 12%. Lettings Income increased 
as a proportion of the Estate Agency 
business and represented 28% of total 
Estate Agency Division income in 2015 
(2014: 26%).
We delivered organic Lettings growth of 
5% and in addition, in line with our strategy 
substantially increased the rate of Lettings 
book acquisitions, acquiring 30 Lettings 
books in 2015 for a total consideration of 
£9.6m
5
. This is a significant increase against 
2014 when we acquired 10 Lettings books 
for a total consideration of £1.8m.
We have maintained consistent investment 
criteria for Lettings book acquisitions 
throughout the year and we have not 
changed our investment criteria as we 
have increased the rate of investment. The 
Lettings books have been successfully 
integrated into our networks.
Financial Services
Total Financial Services income grew 
strongly again with 16% year-on-year  
growth in 2015. We have also delivered over 
16% compound growth since 2011 as we 
have rolled out our model across the Estate 
Agency business and delivered growth from 
our intermediary networks.
Post our 2015 year-end, we acquired a 
65% interest in GFL in February 2016, 
which provides mortgage and protection 
brokerage services to the purchasers 
of new homes through its subsidiaries, 
Mortgages First Limited and Insurance 
First Brokers Limited. This investment 
supports LSL ’s strategy to grow long-term 
profitability in the provision of residential 
property services in the UK, by identifying 
value enhancing opportunities. Further, the 
investment strengthens LSL ’s relationships 
with its key housebuilder clients.
Selective Estate Agency acquisitions
We remain committed to our strategy of 
evaluating selective acquisition of Estate 
Agency businesses.
In February 2015 we acquired Thomas 
Morris, a multi award-winning Estate 
Agency and Lettings business with seven 
branches in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire 
and Hertfordshire. We are pleased with the 
performance of the business in 2015 and 
also note that since acquisition, Thomas 
Morris has increased its Financial Services 
income, an example of how we can add 
value to our acquisitions.
Marsh & Parsons
Given the overall challenging prime Central 
London market, I am pleased to report 
that Marsh & Parsons’ revenue grew 9% in 
2015 to £35.3m (2014: £32.5m) and profit 
increased by 6% to £6.9m (2014: £6.5m).
This growth was a result of strong Lettings 
performance of 10%, growth in Land and 
New Homes and resilience in Residential 
Sales, with good results from the new 
offices opened previously in the outer prime 
Central London locations.
We continued with our branch expansion 
strategy in 2015, opening two branches 
during the year in the outer prime Central 
London locations of Shoreditch and Queens 
Park. We have continued with our strategy 
in 2016 and since the year-end have opened 
a branch in Tooting. We are pleased with 
the performance of these new branches.
Our ambition remains to expand to 36 
branches by 2019. Outer prime Central 
London has not been as negatively 
impacted as prime Central London and 
Marsh & Parsons is looking to expand its 
new office footprint in outer prime Central 
London locations.
Estate Agency profit per branch  
(Your Move, Reeds Rains and LSLi)
LSL successfully increased operating profit 
per branch from £4,600 in 2011 to £45,600 
in 2014. Our medium term strategy is to 
drive operating profit per owned branch 
to between £80,000 and £100,000 on the 
expectation of longer term stability in the 
UK residential property sector. Our Lettings 
growth and Financial Services growth 
across the network continues to underpin 
this strategy.
We invested in 2015 to drive future growth 
by increasing branch headcount to support 
our successful Lettings and Financial 
Services businesses and also in our 
growing Land and New Homes business.

Group Chief Executive’s Review
We increased our headcount in these 
growing businesses by over 100 colleagues 
during the year. This investment will support 
further growth and has resulted in a short- 
term fall in branch profitability by 7% in 2015.
Estate Agency operating margin was 13.2% 
(2014: 15%) reflecting these investments in 
the business and also the market decline 
in repossessions, impacting LSL ’s Asset 
Management business.
Surveying Division
During 2015 we continued to focus on 
optimising the profitability of our Surveying 
business.
The 2014 contract renewals and wins 
as well as the project undertaken in Q4 
2014 to optimise operational performance 
and productivity have delivered full year 
benefits in 2015. With further optimisation 
of capacity management in 2015, profit 
margins have therefore improved in the 
year to 28.3% (2014: 21.4%). A technology 
refresh is also in progress to deliver further 
enhancements.
Income per job increased by 17% to £196 
(2014: £167) and we performed 327,267 
total jobs in 2015 (2014: 371,717) as we 
optimised the mix of our business. We will 
further support our graduate programme 
which continues to be successful.
Our customers
Our continued focus on providing the 
best service to our customers has been 
recognised in 2015 with numerous industry 
awards including:
•  e.surv: What Mortgage? Awards 2015; 
Best Survey Provider-Winner
•  e.surv: Equity Release Awards 2015; Best

Balance Sheet
The Group has a strong balance sheet with 
closing Net Bank Debt at 31
st
 December 
2015 of £39.9m (2014: £34.7m) reflecting 
the acquisitions made during the year 
and a gearing level at 0.83 times adjusted 
EBITDA (2014: 0.74 times)
6
. The Group has 
a committed revolving credit facility until 
August 2017.
At 31
st
 December 2015, we held a 2.7% 
shareholding in Zoopla, valued at £27.1m.
In December 2014 we announced the need 
to further increase our PI Costs provision 
due to the historic market issues relating to 
the 2004 to 2008 high risk lending period 
and an additional reserve of £24.6m was 
provided and included as an exceptional 
item in 2014. In 2015 we continued to make 
positive progress in addressing these 
historic claims and the reduction in the rate 
of notifications and claims from the high 
risk lending period has been in line with our 
expectations during the year, and those 
assumed in setting the provision.
Outlook
We have started 2016 in line with our 
expectations across the Group and are 
well placed to deliver a solid performance 
during the year. We continue to consistently 
execute on our strategy and are well placed 
to deliver increased Shareholder value.
I look forward to working with all my 
colleagues to deliver another successful 
year in 2016.

 SUMMARY FOR 2009 FINANCIAL YEAR
At the end of 2008, we suspended four high
cost operations and set a target to produce
300 kt of copper cathode equivalent in 2009.
By making full use of stockpiled material and
beneﬁting from previous capital investment,
management exceeded this target and
produced 320 kt. The emphasis on efﬁciency
and conserving cash was also seen in unit
costs, which were contained at 72 US cents
per pound over the year, compared to the
116 US cents per pound reported in 2008.
Over the course of 2009, copper proved to
be a resilient metal. Even in the worst periods,
demand from our own customers remained
steady. By the time of our half-yearly results, in
August 2009, the copper price had recovered
to $6,305 per tonne and ﬁnished the year at
$7,346 per tonne. Demand for copper from
China, one of our principal markets, was
helped by a successful government stimulus
package. The key role that copper plays in a
wide range of applications, and the tightness
of copper supply, also assisted its price
recovery during 2009.
Our realised copper price was $5,024 per tonne
in 2009 compared to $6,714 per tonne in 2008.
The lower copper price impacted revenue from
continuing operations, which was $2,404 million
compared to $3,276 million in 2008. Additional
tonnage from stockpiled material and lower
costs both assisted profitability, although
Group EBITDA declined to $1,634 million
from $2,056 million in 2008 due to lower
commodity prices.
BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING
The balance sheet has strengthened over the
course of the year. Net cash was generated
from operations of $820 million and, shortly
after the year end, we completed the sale
of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 to Samruk for
$681 million. These proceeds leave the Group
with net debt of $689 million from continuing
operations, excluding the Power Division and
MKM. We also recently arranged a loan facility
of up to $2.7 billion, which places the Group in
a strong position to deliver its growth projects.
STRATEGY
Our long-term strategy remains the same as
that set at our Listing in 2005 – to optimise the
performance of our assets, deliver our growth
projects and take advantage of natural resource
opportunities in Central Asia.
In 2009, we focused on the ﬁrst part of our
strategy with considerable success, as seen
in these results. In 2010, there is still much
work to be done on optimising and improving
our efficiency, and we are in a good position
to deliver on the second part of our strategy,
and move our growth projects forward. We
will continue to evaluate other opportunities
for acquisition and development, the third
part of our strategy, as they become available.

Directors’ Report: Business Review
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
At the start of 2009 we were presented with a challenging
environment. The instability in the global financial sector,
which had begun in 2008, fed through to industrial
activity with manufacturers uncertain about demand
for their products and constrained by lack of funding.
Reflecting the poor economic outlook, copper prices
started 2009 at a depressed level of $3,071 per tonne,
compared to their 2008 peak of $8,985 per tonne in July.
Against this background, the Board set two clear aims
for 2009; to focus on efﬁciency and to conserve cash.
These objectives were successfully achieved by operational
management, so that despite a very challenging situation,
the Group produced a very successful outcome.
Kazakhmys ended 2009 in a stronger position than
it had started, toughened by the experience and with
a full understanding of the importance of the value
of production, rather than the volume.

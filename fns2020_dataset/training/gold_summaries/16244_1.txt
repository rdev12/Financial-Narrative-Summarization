 00 in review
In 2005, our revenues grew 40% 
year over year; we captured several 
new key customers; we developed 
or strengthened relationships  
with global channel partners; 
we introduced pre-packaged 
applications intended to drive 
commercial deployments of our  
SIP Application Server; and we 
prepared the Company for growth 
by raising £20 million through the 
floatation on AIM.
During 2005, we were selected by a 
number of customers that we plan 
to leverage in order to accelerate 
our growth in the SIP market in 
2006 and beyond. First, we 
announced a deployment with 
United Online Inc (Netzero), an 
alternative Service Provider based 
in the US who is an early adopter of 
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 
services. Second, we won 
numerous trial engagements with 
the early adopter Carriers that 
include 7 of the 12 industry 
recognised leading global Carriers. 
Finally, we signed contracts with 
Bell Canada and another two Tier-1 
US Carriers and subsequent to the 
2005 year-end, two further Tier-1 
global Carriers via our partners. 
These contracts currently represent 
relatively small amounts of revenue 
through the sale of licences for 
development and initial small-scale 
deployments. I believe that these 
wins will form the foundation of  
our future revenues, which will  
grow as multiple new and existing 
applications are deployed on our 
SIP Application Server. I also believe 
that through our hard work and 
continued efforts at moving our 
customers into wide-scale 
deployments we have earned the 
right to be recognised as a leader 
in the SIP marketplace in 2006  
and beyond. 
In addition to winning the 
architectural beachhead with 
specific Carriers, we have been 
successful in establishing 
partnerships with leading Network 
Equipment Vendors (NEVs), 
including HP , Nokia, Lucent, 
Siemens and Huawei and play an 
important role in their product 
portfolio with our open,  
standards-based SIP platform.  
We return value to these partners 
by way of the applications 
delivered on our platform, which 
helps drive sales of their media 
servers, gateways, session-border 
controllers and other IMS-based 
network elements. These 
relationships provide incentives to 
work together on joint marketing 
and selling activities where both 
parties can be successful. It is 
through these partnerships that  
a company of Ubiquity’s size and 
scale is able to sell to and fulfil 
Tier-1 Carrier requirements and we 
therefore value them very highly. 
Going forward our focus will be  
on helping our partners become 
even more effective in selling our 
products. We intend to further 
leverage this sales model to 
accelerate our growth and further 
extend our global reach.
We also enjoy the benefit of 
complementary technology 
partners such as HP and Microsoft 
where our products are integrated 
into overall Service Delivery 
Platforms. These technologies are 
then used together to design,

solutions in a common repeatable 
framework. Recently, we 
co-hosted a “developer’s 
hothouse” with Microsoft for 
British Telecom where we helped 
developers from around the world 
conceptualise, design, develop 
and demonstrate several 
applications created on the 
Ubiquity SIP Application Server. 
This was a compressed two-week 
exercise that demonstrated  
the speed and flexibility of 
development using our rapid 
service creation environment. 
Additionally, we have worked  
with Microsoft to integrate our  
SIP Application Server with their 
web-services-enabled Connected 
Services Framework (CSF). The 
resulting “I’m Lost” application 
showcases our combined 
strengths by allowing a mobile 
subscriber to access an address  
in their remote Outlook calendar, 
map the location of the address, 
and to get driving directions 
spoken to them via natural speech 
technology over their mobile 
phone. This is just one example  
of how we intend to leverage our 
partners to help deliver new,  
high-value services to our carrier 
customers in the future.
In 2005, we continued to invest in 
our SIP Application Server Platform, 
mediation platform and 
application-creation environment. 
We also invested in pre-packaged 
application products that our 
customers can deploy quickly for 
a faster return on our investment 
with little or no professional 
services support. Currently, there 
are an estimated 3 billion users of 
the Public Switched T elephone 
Network (PSTN), and less then 20 
million users of VoIP , representing 
a tremendous opportunity for 
Carriers to capture new subscribers 
as they migrate to VoIP . 
Recognising this opportunity, 
Ubiquity has introduced Voice Plus, 
a pre-packaged consumer VoIP 
solution that allows Carriers, 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs), 
and alternative Carriers to 
participate and compete in this 
growing market. Voice Plus is 
developed and deployed on our  
SIP Application Server Platform 
and is designed to make it easy 
for Service Providers to add new 
features and scale to millions  
of subscribers. 
IP conferencing is another strategic 
application area for Ubiquity as 
conferencing minutes of use are 
growing significantly. Legacy 
conferencing applications are not 
proving to serve mobile users well 
as they have difficulty capitalising 
on the advanced capabilities of the 
web. SPEAK Conference Director 
is a pre-packaged application that 
takes advantage of the advanced 
multimedia capabilities of the  
SIP Application Server. SPEAK 
offers a full-featured audio and 
web conferencing solution at a 
fraction of the cost of our 
competitors. Easy-to-use SPEAK 
web collaboration tools allow 
moderators to share presentations, 
web content, applications and 
documents in real time with 
individuals and groups around  
the world. This product is moving 
into deployment with two Tier-1 
Carriers, and has several other 
prospects in the near term.
While Ubiquity is well prepared 
to deliver and support the  
Voice Plus and SPEAK solutions 
described above, these 
applications are only two 
weapons in our strategy to 
grow our market position 
going forward. 
“Being familiar with Ubiquity … and considering 
they have a lot of mindshare, I have a feeling that 
they’ll probably do well and this signals more 
potential down the road.”

 00 outlook
The overall strategy for the 
Company remains unchanged and 
clear: to leverage our proven 
technical strengths and continue 
to do what we do best:
 Build on beachhead of customer 
wins, design wins and trials by 
helping move our customers 
towards commercial 
deployments, and adding new 
applications over time to 
aggressively drive subscriber 
growth on our platform.
 Foster and grow our 
relationship with our select 
channel partners to ensure their 
success with our platform.
 Embed our platform in carrier 
networks and enable ISVs and 
third parties to develop new 
applications that drive higher 
utilisation of our platform and 
enable our customers to 
generate a greater return on 
investment.
 Manage our financial assets 
wisely to grow the Company in 
line with future revenues.
 In 2006, it is our plan to launch  
the Ubiquity Developer Network 
(UDN). UDN will be a progressive 
developer ecosystem focused on 
bringing together Carriers, ISVs, 
application developers, System 
Integrators and Network

address the needs of the 
marketplace. These needs will be 
articulated by our newly formed 
Customer Advisory Council  
made up of Carriers and Service 
Provider customers. The goal  
of UDN will be to facilitate the 
building and delivering of a  
wide range of applications by 
providing development tools, 
access to Carrier networks, 
technical information, support 
and advice aimed to take 
developers from concept through 
to deployment. We are excited 
about our customer and key 
partners support for UDN and 
believe it will be a key enabler to 
Ubiquity’s future growth. 
In summary, I am pleased with 
what we have accomplished in 
2005. Our growing customer base 
and market reputation sets us  
up well for the future. While  
we cannot dictate the timing  
of the market’s full-scale move  
to IP-based networks, I am 
confident that Ubiquity and our 
technologies will be considered  
a “key” component of the Next 
Generation Networks. We will 
continue to focus on winning new 
customers through technology 
leadership and world-class 
partnerships. This will be done 
with a financial framework that 
balances revenue growth with 
expense management as we 
continue to match our success 
with the market as it matures.  
In closing, I would like to extend 
my appreciation to our investors, 
customers and partners for their 
continued support, trust and 
confidence. I would also like to 
thank our dedicated employees 
for their passion and contributions 
toward making Ubiquity a great 
company.

 Chairman’s statement
Report of the Directors
2008 was a difficult and turbulent year generally for business  
all around the world. It was dominated by a banking crisis which 
started in the US sub-prime property market and which quickly 
spread to other asset classes and countries. These problems were 
exacerbated by the volatile price of mineral oil and, for companies 
like Unilever, record rises in the cost of vegetable oils like palm, 
soy and rapeseed.
Despite these unprecedented circumstances I am pleased to report 
that Unilever performed well in 2008 and emerged as a stronger, 
more competitive company. It delivered good results on both top 
and bottom line and its strong cash flows allowed it to produce 
substantial returns to shareholders in the form of both share 
buy-backs and dividends.
Part of this was due to the inherent strength and stability of the 
company. Partly it was the result of a robust strategy, effectively 
implemented. But partly, too, it was due to the leadership of 
Patrick Cescau who retired from the business on 31 December 
(see panel opposite).
As a Board team, one of our most important tasks in 2008 was to 
manage Patrick’s succession once he had signalled his intention 
to retire. The process, initiated and led by our Nomination 
Committee, was wide-ranging and thorough. It was as a result  
of this search that we were lucky enough to find Paul Polman.
We are delighted that Paul accepted our offer to become

in which we operate, having spent 26 years in our industry. Paul 
brings with him a deep understanding of brands, consumers and

is palpable and will bring new energy and ideas to Unilever.

the transition of Geneviève Berger from Non-Executive Director  
to Chief R&D Officer on the Executive team. In this capacity  
she will be able to bring her great knowledge of science and 
technology to the service of the business. In an industry where 
innovation is such a critical success factor I believe that this is an 
important and far-sighted appointment.

During that time he has served as our Vice Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and Chairman of our Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees. On behalf of our Boards, I take this 
opportunity to thank him for his contribution, wise counsel and 
service since 2000. It is intended that David will be succeeded  
in those roles by Jeroen van der Veer, with effect from the  
2 0 0 9 	 A G M s.	
Our strategy, in an unpredictable 
economic environment, is to 
maintain our growth momentum 
and deliver competitive levels  
of profitability. Patrick Cescau
On behalf of the Directors and everyone 
at Unilever, I want to express our 
appreciation to Patrick Cescau for  
his services to Unilever over the last  
35 years. By any standards, Patrick’s 
career has been a remarkable one, 
culminating with his appointment  
in 2005 as Unilever’s first ever Chief 
Executive Officer.
Since that time he has helped to 
transform the company. Significant 
organisational change – particularly 
the implementation of ‘One Unilever’ 
– has been accompanied by a 
consistent improvement in business 
results and overall performance. 
Patrick leaves the business stronger 
than he found it, well placed to meet 
the challenges that lie ahead.
Throughout his time in the business, 
Patrick also came to embody the 
qualities and values that help to make 
Unilever a special business: respect, 
humanity, integrity. It is for these 
reasons that he is liked and respected 
in equal measure, both inside the 
company and outside.
We all wish Patrick a long and  
happy retirement.
As part of the time that the Boards spent with the business 
during the year, we visited our laboratories in Bangalore and 
our customer innovation centre in New Jersey. The Boards 
reviewed the strategy at a two-day meeting in October. 
One of the striking things to emerge from our strategy session 
was the consistency of Unilever’s approach. While the strategy 
has evolved to take account of the changing external environment, 
its essential elements remain unchanged. The Group is still 
committed to growing competitively and will do so by developing 
its core assets of brands, technology, geographic spread and 
marketing excellence. Just as importantly its principles remain 
unchanged. The Group will deliver its results in a sustainable 
fashion – seeking to manage its social and environmental 
impacts in a manner which meets the needs of all its stakeholders. 
We are proposing to change to a simpler and more transparent 
dividend practice for the Unilever group from 2010 onwards. 
These changes will result in more frequent dividend payments 
through the payment of quarterly dividends to shareholders. 
They will also better align dividend payouts with the cash flow 
generation of the business. Further details are included in the 
2 0 09 	 A GM 	 N o t i c es.
Looking forward, I remain confident. Unilever entered 2009  
with a realistic assessment of the challenges which it would 
have to face. Its plans were built on the assumption of a deep 
and prolonged global economic downturn. We are determined  
to emerge from this in good shape.
Finally, on behalf of the Boards, I would like to extend my 
sincere thanks to all of Unilever’s 174 000 employees. They  
have had to cope with, and manage, a huge amount of change. 
They have done this in an exemplary and responsible fashion.

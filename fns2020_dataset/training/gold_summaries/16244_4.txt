The Telecoms

Opportunity
The hundred year old 
telecommunications industry is 
undergoing a fundamental and 
highly disruptive transition. 
Antiquated, voice-centric, “circuit-
switched” networks are giving way 
to digital, Internet Protocol (IP) 
based packet networks that 
enable the swift, efficient delivery 
of voice, video and data services 
in a ubiquitous manner to end 
users, anytime and anywhere. This 
is reshaping the industry’s overall 
structure, and opening the door 
to a new set of companies that 
bring an Internet-centric approach 
to delivering innovation within 
the $2.1 trillion worldwide 
telecommunications industry.
Ubiquity’s award-winning  
SIP Application Server (SIP A/S)  
is a Java-based software platform 
that allows telecom Service 
Providers to develop and deploy 
next-generation converged 
communications services faster 
and more easily than using 
traditional methods.
SIP A/S brings the distributed, 
open application development 
model of the Internet to 
telecommunications. This 
maximizes the ability of an 
application developer to reuse 
features and components from 
one service offering to another 
using open, familiar application 
programming interfaces (APIs). 
Migrating Internet development 
practices to the telecoms industry 
enables Service Providers and 
applications developers to create 
and rapidly deploy different 
SIP-based applications across 
fixed and mobile networks.
The Yankee Group forecasts  
the market for telecom-grade,  
SIP-based Application Servers will 
reach $4.7 billion by 2009, as they 
are deployed for a myriad of 
enhanced IP services, as well as  
for service mediation and other 
application routing functions within 
the IP network. Yankee Group also 
believes the opportunity for  
SIP-based Application Servers will 
be fully exploited by the advent of 
IP Multimedia Subsystems within 
carrier IP core networks as well as 
the emergence of robust Service 
Delivery Platforms within Service 
Provider’ s networks.
Ubiquity Software develops and markets 
SIP-based communications software for 
fixed and mobile Service Providers, System 
Integrators, Independent Software 
Vendors and OEM partners worldwide.

Chairman’s 
Statement
This	year	has	seen	a	significant	step	forward	for	the	Group	as	EBITDA	turned	
positive	and	we	announced	two	significant	developments	towards	fully	
exploiting	our	technology	for	both	Accoya
®	
and	Tricoya
®
.	We	have	worked	
closely	with	Solvay	in	establishing	new	arrangements	which	will	allow	us	to	
double	the	Accoya
	
capacity	in	Arnhem,	the	first	phase	of	which	will	be	on	
stream	in	2017.	In	addition	we	announced	in	February,	BP’s	participation	as	
the	proposed	consortium	partner	to	join	with	Medite	and	Accsys	to	fund,	build	
and	operate	the	world’s	first	Tricoya
	
wood	elements	acetylation	plant.	These	
developments	have	been	achieved	as	a	result	of	the	dedication	and	commitment	
of	all	of	our	employees	who	believe	passionately	in	the	value	of	our	technology.	I	
believe	the	Company	is	today	in	a	strong	position	and	on	the	cusp	of	something	
truly	exciting	and	rewarding	for	all	stakeholders.
Financial Summary 
Total	revenue	for	the	year	ended		
31	March	2016	increased	by	15%		
to	¤52.8m	(2015:	¤46.1m).	Within		
this	total,	Accoya
	
wood	revenue	
increased	by	7%	to	¤43.5m	(2015:	
¤40.7m)	largely	as	a	result	of	pricing,	
while	licence	income	increased		
from	¤0.4m	to	¤2.8m	reflecting		
the	new	arrangements	with	our		
Accoya
	
licensee	Solvay.
Gross	profit	margin	improved	from	
27%	to	34%	due	to	the	higher	licence	
income,	increased	Accoya
	
prices	and	
continued	operating	efficiencies.	Other	
operating	costs	(excluding	exceptional	
items)	increased	by	15%	to	¤18.5m	
(2015:	¤16.0m)	due	to	the	inclusion	of	
¤1.6m	of	costs	relating	to	the	Tricoya
	
business	which	was	equity	accounted	
in	the	previous	year,	together	with	an	
increase	in	staff	costs	resulting	from	
increased	activity	levels.
The	above	improvements	resulted	in	
a	¤4.8m	increase	in	underlying	Group	
EBITDA	to	¤2.4m	(2015:	EBITDA	loss	
of	¤2.4m).	This	is	the	first	time	we	
have	been	EBITDA	positive	since	our	
restructuring	in	2010	and	2011.
Accoya
	
sales	volumes	increased	by 	
1%	as	a	result	of	our	pricing	strategy 	
which	enabled	us	to	manage	supply 	
and	demand	ahead	of	additional 	
manufacturing	capacity	becoming	
available	at	Arnhem,	expected	in 	
calendar	year	2017.	This	increase	will 	
initially	add	50%	to	our	production 	
capacity,	to	be	followed	by	a	fourth 	
reactor	adding	another	50%	as 	
demand	requires.	The	improved 	
pricing	implemented	in	the	second 	
half	of	the	previous	financial	year 	
were	complemented	by	operating 	
efficiencies	and	together	resulted	in	a 	
20%	improvement	in	the	manufacturing 	
facility	EBITDA,	an	increase	from	¤6.9m 	
to	¤8.3m.	
The	cash	balance	of	¤8.2m	at	
31	March	2016	(2015:	¤10.8m)	reflects	
an	improvement	in	the	underlying	
operating	cash	flow,	which	improved	
by	22%	to	¤3.5m	cash	inflow	from	
operating	activities	before	changes	in 	
working	capital.	We	have	also	invested 	
¤4.1m	principally	for	engineering	
work	for	the	Arnhem	expansion	and	
proposed	Tricoya
	
plant	in	Hull,	together	
with	maintenance	and	improvements	
to	the	existing	Arnhem	plant.
Operational progress
The	health	and	safety	of	our	staff	
is	our	priority	and	we	continue	to	
seek	improvements	to	ensure	we	do	
everything	we	can	to	exceed	industry	
expectations	by	challenging	our	
methods,	improving	our	reporting		
and	continuing	to	learn.
Accoya
	
wood	sales	volumes	remained	
relatively	flat	for	the	year	(33,847m
3
),	
following	price	increases	last	year	
which	we	implemented	to	improve	
profitability	and	to	help	manage	our	
capacity	utilisation,	with	the	result	that	
some	of	our	distributors,	in	particular	
in	North	America	managed	their	
inventory	levels.	
Demand	for	Accoya
	
continues	to	be	
strong	and	we	continue	to	believe	the	
long-term	market	opportunity	remains	
substantial,	with	in	excess	of	1	million	
m
3
	of	Accoya
	
sales	per	annum	being	
achievable	in	the	long-term.	In	light	of	
recent	improvements	to	our	existing	
Accoya
	
plant	we	would	expect	an	
increase	in	sales	volumes	in	the	new	
financial	year,	although	recognising	our 	
€2.4m
EBITDA; an increase  
from -€2.4m 07
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
short-term	manufacturing	capacity	is	
limited	to	approximately	40,000m
3
.	
In	November	2015	we	agreed	a 	
number	of	important	changes	to	our 	
relationship	with	our	Accoya
	
licensee,	
Solvay.	These	will	enable	us	to	double 	
the	capacity	of	our	manufacturing 	
plant	in	Arnhem	in	stages,	with	a 	
first	new	reactor	adding	50%	extra 	
capacity,	expected	to	be	operational 	
in	calendar	year	2017.	Solvay	remains 	
committed	to	Accoya
	
under	a	revised	
licence	agreement,	and	has	taken 	
over	responsibility	for	Accoya
	
sales	
and	marketing	in	a	revised	region 	
covering	most	of	central	Europe	and 	
Scandinavia,	committing	to	purchase	a	
minimum	of	76,000m
3
	over	five	years. 	
The	agreement	provides	a	platform 	
to	help	underpin	the	expansion	of 	
Arnhem	through	a	combination	of 		
fees	and	a	loan.
In	February	2016	we	were	very		
pleased	to	announce	BP’s	participation 	
in	the	proposed	consortium	to	fund,	
build	and	operate	the	world’s	first	
Tricoya
	
wood	elements	acetylation	
plant.	BP	Ventures	acquired	an	initial	
3%	equity	interest	in	our	Tricoya
	
business,	implying	a	valuation	of	
¤35m.	The	investment	was	a	first	step	
in	the	formation	of	a	consortium	led	
by	Accsys	and	with	BP	and	Medite,	
expected	to	result	in	the	creation	of	
a	new	operating	business	in	which	
Accsys	will	retain	a	substantial	
shareholding.	Considerable	progress	
has	been	made	by	the	parties	and	we	
look	forward	to	the	full	consortium	
being	finalised	later	in	2016	with	
additional	funding	necessary	to	build	
the	plant	in	Hull,	UK.
The	Tricoya
	
plant	is	expected	to	have	
an	initial	capacity	of	30,000	metric	
tonnes	of	acetylated	Tricoya
	
chips	per	
annum,	equivalent	to	approximately	
40,000m
3
	of	panel	products.	The	
acetylated	chips	will	be	used	as	
feedstock	for	the	production	of	high	
performance	MDF	or	particle	board	
panels	in	a	market	estimated	to	be	
approximately	200	million	m
3
	annually.	
It	is	proposed	that	the	plant	in	Hull	
will	be	built	in	such	a	way	that	further	
capacity	can	be	added	to	the	site	as	
demand	grows.
Outlook
The	agreements	with	Solvay	will	allow 	
Accsys	to	expand	our	manufacturing 	
capability	leading	to	higher	Accoya
	
volumes	and	higher	manufacturing 	
EBITDA	in	the	medium-term.	This 	
increased	capacity	will	also	provide 	
greater	flexibility	in	order	to	target 		
new	markets	as	we	continue	to 		
develop	demand	for	Accoya
	
globally		
as	well	as	provide	material	for 	
production	of	Medite	Tricoya, 		
ahead	of	the	new	Tricoya
	
plant	in		
Hull	becoming	operational.
The	progress	we	have	been	able	
to	make	in	respect	of	Tricoya
	
is	
particularly	exciting;	with	the	proposed	
consortium	providing	the	basis	for		
the	first	step	in	exploiting	a	market	
which	we	believe	is	in	excess	of	1.6	
million	m
3
	per	annum.	Accsys	will	
benefit	from	both	the	expected	
substantial	manufacturing	profits		
and	licensing	revenues.	
The	new	financial	year	has	started 	
with	demand	for	Accoya
	
continuing	
to	support	the	expansion	of	our 	
manufacturing	facilities	as	soon 		
as	we	can.	
I	believe	the	progress	we	have	made 	
over	the	last	two	years	has	put	the 	
Company	in	a	more	financially	stable 	
position	than	ever	before	and	I	am 	
confident	that	we	will	be	able	to	build 	
upon	this	in	order	to	achieve	our	goals 	
of	increasing	total	manufacturing 	
capacity	over	the	next	two	to 	
three	years.

 Chairman’s statement
“Telford Homes has taken a
substantial step forward during
the last 12 months. Another year
of strong financial performance
has been complemented by the
share placing raising net funds
of £14.4 million during 2006.
This additional equity gives us
the opportunity to accelerate
our growth in East London, a
region with an exciting future.”
David Holland 
Chairman (Non-Executive)
Sales performance in the year has
been strong and although we are
mindful of rising interest rates this has
not had an effect on the confidence
of our customers. Demand is in excess
of supply in East London and this,
together with the quality of our
product, has been a factor in the
success of our recent sales launches.
Our development pipeline is very
healthy at over 2,200 homes. This does
not include over 1,000 homes not yet
under contract that we expect to
deliver through our development
partnership with Eastend Homes. Last
year I reported that we had been
chosen as their partner on the British
Estate in Mile End and, following a
thorough planning process which has
helped set the precedent for future
estate regeneration in East London,
development is now underway. We have
been appointed as their partner on a
further five estates which we expect to
develop over the next five years.
The share placing in October last year
was extremely successful with demand
for our shares being far greater than
we expected. This is a sign of the
confidence that the directors have in
the future of Telford Homes and the
positive messages we were able to
relay when presenting to institutions.
I am delighted that a number of new
shareholders have been added to our
register during the year and I hope that
they are looking forward to the next
few years as much as I am.

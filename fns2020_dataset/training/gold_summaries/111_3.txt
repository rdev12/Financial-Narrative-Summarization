advantage of these significant 
opportunities whilst ensuring 
that our investment in the US 
is disciplined as the market is 
established. 
We monitor the regulatory 
environment in the UK and 
Europe closely as countries 
adapt their approaches. Our 
significant regulatory 
experience and operational 
scale means that we are able 
to manage the impact of 
these changes better than 
most and to take advantage 
of opportunities that these 
changes open up, particularly 
in enabling larger players like 
888 to increase market share.  
Financial results and 
Dividend
2014 has seen another year 
of record performance driven 
by growth across our core 
products and delivering 
on our financial forecasts 
enabling us to increase 
revenue to US$455 million, 
representing a 14% uplift 
from the prior year (2013: 
US$401 million). We continue 
to strengthen our market 
position through investment 
in product development 
and cost effective customer 
acquisition, while increasing 
our adjusted EBITDA by 33% 
to US$101 million (2013: 
US$76 million) and profit after 
tax by 14% to US$57 million 
(2013: US$50 million). 
Chairman’s Statement
Mobile is having a 
transformational impact on 
our business. We continued to 
innovate with a ‘mobile first’ 
approach embedded in all 
product development whilst 
our best-in-class technology 
and analytical capabilities 
facilitated ever more effective 
targeting of our marketing 
investment. 
Growth in the global online 
gambling industry is set to 
continue in 2015, despite 
challenging Poker market 
dynamics and a competitive 
UK Bingo market. New 
markets are becoming 
regulated, presenting 
opportunities across the 
globe. In the US, we are 
uniquely positioned to exploit 
the progressive regulation 
of the market as the only 
operator active in all three 
regulated states. Whilst to 
date market momentum in 
the US has been slower than 
many anticipated, the long-
term opportunities remain 
significant and we will be a 
major player as more states 
regulate online gaming over 
time. Our approach gives us 
the financial firepower to take 
2014 was another record year for 888, building 
on the strategic development of the Group 
in 2013. This success has been driven by an 
outstanding Casino performance, but was also 
underpinned by notably strong growth both 
in Sport and in our B2B business as well as 
impressive market outperformance in Poker and 
in Bingo.

Overview
As at 31 December 2014, 
888 had US$163 million cash 
and cash equivalents (2013: 
US$116 million) and US$67 
million liabilities to customers 
(2013: US$55 million). 
Given the continuing strong 
financial performance 
of the Group, the Board 
is recommending a final 
dividend of 4.5¢ per share 
(which together with the 
interim dividend equals 8.0¢ 
per share in accordance with 
the Group’s dividend policy) 
and an additional one-off 
7.0¢ per share, bringing the 
total for the year to 15.0¢ per 
share (2013: 14.0¢ per share). 
Board changes
I would like to take this 
opportunity to highlight 
some changes to our Board, 
some of which have been 
previously announced, and all 
of which have been carefully 
planned and implemented 
in order to support the 
Company’s further growth and 
development.
Late last year, Ron McMillan 
joined the Board and was 
appointed Chair of the Audit 
Committee. With a wealth of 
experience on boards and 
audit committees, and a long 
and respected ‘Big 4’ career 
behind him, we can already 
see the great value that Ron 
is bringing to 888. 
From the conclusion of 
the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting, I will be stepping 
down as Chairman of the 
Board due to my retirement. 
It is with a heavy heart 
that I conclude my nine-
year tenure as Chairman. 
However I am consoled by the 
knowledge that I am leaving 
the Company at the top of 
its game and only getting 
stronger.
At the same time as my 
retirement, Brian Mattingley 
will be stepping down as 
Chief Executive Officer, 
and appointed Executive 
Chairman. We are very 
excited at this move, which 
will allow the Company to 
continue to take advantage of 
Brian’s wealth of experience, 
particularly in maintaining 
and developing relationships 
with regulators. In Brian 
Mattingley, shareholders 
have an Executive Chairman 
with huge experience of the 
gaming industry and extensive 
knowledge of our business. 
With Brian as Executive 
Chairman, we feel confident 
that we have an industry-
leading senior team to 
continue 888’s growth and 
development in the years to 
come.
Finally, John Anderson will 
be stepping down as a 
Non-executive Director from 
the conclusion of the 2015 
Annual General Meeting. John 
is a valuable resource of 
knowledge and experience in 
the industry, and will remain 
available to consult with and 
assist the Board as needed. 
I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank John for 
his dedication and service 
to 888, as its CEO until 2006, 
and as a Non-executive 
Director thereafter.
On a personal note, I would 
like to thank our shareholders 
for the trust and confidence 
which they have placed in the 
Board and in my leadership 
as Chairman. 
Winning team
The success enjoyed by 
the company in the last 
12-months is, once again, 
testament to the hard-work 
and quality of the 888 team. 
Globally, our 1,800 staff 
are setting the standard of 
innovation in online gaming 
and are the Group’s greatest 
asset. Their passion will ensure 
that 888 continues to be at 
the fore of the online gaming 
industry for years to come. On 
behalf of the board I would 
like to thank all my colleagues 
for their commitment to 
making the 888 strategy 
come to life. 
Outlook
888’s success has been built 
on its world class technology 
and market leading products. 
The global online gaming 
market will continue to 
develop driven by regulation 
and with mobile, in particular, 
making our products more 
accessible and enjoyable 
than ever. 
Although we do face 
regulatory headwinds in some 
of our markets, including the 
Point of Consumption Tax in 
the UK, I am confident that we 
are strongly placed to take 
advantage of opportunities 
that they also open up to 
larger, well-financed market 
leaders such as 888. 
Our focus will continue to 
be on delivering a truly 
satisfying experience for our 
customers and delivering 
strong, sustainable long 
term earnings growth for our 
shareholders.

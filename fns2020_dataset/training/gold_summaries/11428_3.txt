Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to report that o2o has delivered strong results in 2007 against a
backdrop of significant change during the year. Following a review of our sales
and operations, a new management structure was implemented including the
appointment of a new Chief Executive, logistics efficiencies were realised and a
major cost reduction exercise was completed. This restructuring has placed
the Group in a strong position.  
Results
Group revenue increased by 1.2% to
£167.9m, up from £165.9m in 2006. 
Underlying profit before tax at
£11.6m was up from £11.5m in 2006,
before exceptional and non-recurring
costs of £2.3m (2006: £0.4m) and
share option charges of £0.2m (2006:
£0.8m). Profit before tax, after all such
charges, was £9.0m (2006: £10.3m)
and profit after tax was £6.3m (2006:
£7.2m). Basic earnings per share were
17.4p (2006: 20.2p).
Net cash generated from operating
activities, after reflecting cash
payments in respect of exceptional
and non-recurring costs, decreased
to £5.4m (2006: £7.7m). At 31
December 2007, cash and cash
equivalents balances were £7.0m, up
from £6.3m in 2006.
Dividends
The Board recommends a final
dividend of 6.8p per share (2006:
6.4p), which, if approved at the
annual general meeting, will be paid
on 9 May 2008 to shareholders on
the register at the close of business
on 11 April 2008. Combined with the
interim dividend paid in November
2007, this makes a total dividend per
share of 10p (2006: 9.6p) and
amounts to a distribution of £3.6m
(2006: £3.4m) and confirms the
Board’s commitment to a progressive
dividend policy.
Review of operations
The year to 31 December 2007 has
been one of significant change. Our
supply arrangements with two large
public sector customers, Ministry of
Defence (MoD) and The National
Health Service (NHS), were due for
renewal by competitive tender
during the year and we anticipated
pressure on our gross margin
percentage. 
In June, we announced that we had
decided to withdraw from the e-
auction process to supply office and
other products to the MoD under a
new four year supply framework
because we believed that the quoted
selling prices would not generate
acceptable profit margins for o2o.
Product supply ceased in the last
quarter of 2007.
At the same time, we announced
that our arrangements to supply the
NHS had been extended to 31 March
2009 and expanded to include a
broader range of products.
Since the end of the year, we have
received confirmation of a two year
extension through to September
2010 of our supply arrangements
with Her Majesty's Revenue and
Customs.
Although the public sector is now a
smaller part of our overall business,
extension of these supply
arrangements demonstrates our
ability to compete in one of our key
markets. 
Following the withdrawal from MoD
supply, we undertook a thorough
review of our operations. As a result,
we have improved operational
efficiency and reduced the cost base
to more closely reflect the needs of
the business. Significant supply chain
efficiency savings have been
achieved and we seized the
opportunity to reorganise our
warehouses and rationalise the
distribution function. In addition, our
sales and support functions have
been slimmed down, centralised
where possible and consolidated
under common leadership.  o2o plc Annual Report 2007 3
This restructuring is now substantially
complete at a total cost of £2.7m,
comprising £0.4m charged in the
year ended 31 December 2006 and
£2.3m charged in the year ended 
31 December 2007. We expect to
realise the full benefits of the
resultant savings in 2008.
Despite our withdrawal from MoD
supply, our revenue grew during the
period. The anticipated pressure on
gross margin was mitigated by
improved product sourcing that
resulted in a broadly stable gross
margin of 31.9% (2006: 32.0%).
However, we anticipate that higher
energy costs and higher paper prices
will impact our margins in 2008
although, as in this year, our revised
approach to procurement is
expected to help mitigate the
impact. Underlying profit before tax
(prior to exceptional and non-
recurring costs and share option
charges) as a percentage of revenue
was maintained at 6.9%. 
Board changes
Simon Moate joined the Board as
Chief Executive on 30 July 2007. He
has a successful track record in the
support services sector and
significant experience in strategic
planning and acquisitions. Simon’s
appointment follows the resignation
of Ray Peck on 1 February 2007,
whom I would like to thank for his
contribution to the business. 
Prior to Simon Moate’s appointment
and for a short handover period
afterwards, I acted in the capacity of
Executive Chairman.
During the year, the responsibilities
of Mark Cunningham, Finance
Director, were extended to
encompass a major project to
oversee the Logistics and IT
departments, including the
implementation of the supply chain
restructuring.
Peter Bertram, who is due to retire by
rotation at the forthcoming annual
general meeting, has decided not to
stand for re-election. Peter has
decided to resign to allow him to
pursue his other business interests. I
thank him for both his commitment
and contribution to the Board over
the last three and a half years as a
non-executive Director.
Outlook
The new management structure and
the team ethic that has been evident
throughout a difficult period of
restructuring has resulted in a
stronger and more focused Group.
While we envisage a slight drop in
revenue in 2008, due to the
withdrawal from MoD supply,
partially offset by revenue growth
elsewhere, we expect that the full
year impact of our restructuring
savings will more than compensate.
We are confident that there is scope
to further improve the business and
remain committed to the expansion
of our routes to market beyond our
traditional contracted office supplies
base.
We have a dedicated team reviewing
acquisition opportunities and we will
endeavour to expand the Group and
increase shareholder value in 2008.
We look forward to the coming year
with confidence and renewed vigour. 
Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting (AGM)
will be held at the Company’s head
office, St Crispins, Duke Street,
Norwich on 24 April 2008 at 10.30am.
Notice of the AGM, detailing the
ordinary and special business
together with the proxy forms for use
at the AGM, is being circulated with
these financial statements.

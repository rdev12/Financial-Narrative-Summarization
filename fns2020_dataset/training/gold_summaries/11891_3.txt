Chairman’s  
Statement
Strong foundations &     global reach
During 2009 Patsystems demonstrated 
the inherent strength of its business 
model despite it being a tough year 
for the global financial business 
community. The robustness of the 
Patsystems revenue model, the spread 
of revenue across a breadth of 
complimentary product offerings and 
the exposure to opportunities across 
the globe meant Patsystems’ business 
was resilient during a difficult market 
period. With turnover growth of 13% 
and adjusted profit growth of 7% the 
business has performed well during 
2009 and is well placed for further 
growth in 2010. I am particularly 
pleased by the increase in turnover  
of our Asia Pacific business of 47%  
to £7.6 million.
Cash	flows	fr om	operating	activities	
amounted	to	£4.3	million	compar ed	to	
£3.6	million	in	2008,	an	incr ease	of	21%	
and	we	expect	this	level	of	cash	
generation	to	continue	in	the	forthcoming	
year .	The	year	end	cash	balance	stood	at	
£8.9	million	(2008:	£5.9	million)	and	the

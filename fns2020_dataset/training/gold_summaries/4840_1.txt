 Directors’ Report: Business Overview
Chief Executive’ s Statement
Our five point plan for the renewal and transformation of the Group
1 Focus on the customer: better value, choice 
and service
Many changes have been made to make our shopping trip
better for customers, including:
■ putting over 20,000 colleagues in the UK through a
comprehensive service programme. This provides better
service in our stores and helps customers choose the most
suitable mix of products, services, and accessories to meet
their needs;
■ improving the delivery, repair and after-sales service, for
example through the introduction of Currys’ next-day delivery
in three-hour time slots;
■ enhancements to The TechGuys support services business,
resulting in an increase in the annual sales of services in 
PC World;
■ improvements to our repair service. For example, customers’
TVs are now being repaired within 8 days on average rather
than 21 days previously. Further enhancements to this
service will follow. We carried out approximately 110,000 
flat panel television and over 330,000 laptop repairs in the
UK during the year; 
■ improvements to product ranges in our UK and Italian
stores in order to provide wider and clearer choices of
products at competitive prices; and
■ new incentive and remuneration schemes for UK store
colleagues to support better customer service and 
team work.
Our last financial year has been one of significant change for
the Group. We have taken wide-ranging actions to reorganise,
restructure, renew and transform the business.
The Renewal and Transformation plan was drawn up following
extensive and in-depth customer research. We have listened to
customers about what they want. 
We are improving the business for our customers by delivering
an unbeatable combination of value, choice and service. We
are improving our store formats, providing better service in-
store, selling complete solutions, delivering at more convenient
times and improving our technical and after-sales service. 
The Placing and Rights Issue received strong support from
shareholders. It was well received by suppliers. We now 
have the resources and flexibility to deliver our Renewal and
Transformation plan. This is an update on each of the five
points of the plan.

range, easier navigation and up to date environment
As at 20 June 2009, in the UK, the following new format
stores had been opened:
■ 30 Currys Superstores which have delivered average gross
profit uplifts of between 23% and 57% versus the rest of the
chain, ahead of management’s expectations. There are
plans to refurbish a further 58 Currys Superstores in the
year ahead;
■ 5 Currys.digital stores which have delivered average 
gross profit uplifts of 31% versus the rest of the chain. 
As we have previously stated we intend to focus
Currys.digital in approximately 100 core locations across 
the UK. The remaining Currys.digital stores will be closed 
as their leases come to an end. The average lease length 
of the Currys.digital stores is approximately four years;
■ 2 Currys Megastores. This is a unique new concept to the
UK providing the largest range of electrical products under
one roof in the UK. The first Megastore at Junction 9 in
Birmingham opened in October and is, at 55,000 sq ft, 
the UK’s largest electrical store. In its opening weekend 
it generated sales of £2.3 million, exceeding expectations,
and is expected to generate approximately £30 million of
sales per annum. It has delivered average gross profit uplift
of 65% versus the rest of the chain. On 4 June the second
Currys Megastore opened in New Malden, London, a new
site of 37,000 sq ft which has got off to a very encouraging
start. A further 4 Currys Megastores are planned for the new
financial year;
■ 41 PC World superstores have now been reformatted. 
The changes to the PC World format have been less
significant than compared to the Currys stores but they
have generated an average gross profit uplift of 11% versus
the rest of the chain. Further improvements are being made
to the new PC World stores and we believe that further
improvements to the gross profit uplifts can be achieved;
■ 1 trial Currys and PC World 2-in-1 store in Weybridge,
Surrey, has been opened. By incorporating a mezzanine 
into an existing Currys store, the PC World brand has 
been introduced into a catchment where no PC World
existed before. This new format has exceeded expectations
generating an average uplift to gross profit of 65% compared
to the store prior to its refit. Further trials of these 2-in-1
stores are planned this year;
■ we are sharing best practice across our international
businesses and learnings from new formats are being
introduced across the Group;
■ our first new format Megastore was opened in Lørenskog 
in Oslo on 5 May 2008 followed by 3 further Megastores 
in Sweden and Norway; and
■ superstores in Greece, Italy, Ireland and the Nordics are
being reformatted utilising the latest formats from the UK,
with strong early results.

Currys Megastore, ‘J9’, Birmingham Directors’ Report: Business Overview
Chief Executive’s Statement continued
On the basis of the gross profit uplifts achieved to date, 
and taking into account the investment and costs involved 
in reformatting stores, we plan to roll out these renewed
formats across the UK, to capture the benefits of a better
shopping trip as rapidly and effectively as possible.
The average cash payback of the total investment spent 
on reformatting stores in the UK & Ireland is targeted to be
three to four years, which is equivalent to a cash return on
investment of 25% to 33%.
During the new financial year we plan to reformat in total, 
15 Currys.digital stores, 75 Currys Superstores, 20 PC World
stores, open 5 further Currys Megastores and trial 5 further 
2-in-1 combined Currys and PC World stores in the UK. 
In the Nordics we are planning to open up to 10 Megastores
across the region as well as refurbish 15 to 20 Superstores.
3 Focus on winning positions
We have market-leading electrical and computing retail
operations in the UK & Ireland, the Nordic region and 
Greece as well as the strong and growing internet presence 
in Europe. We will exploit the potential of all of these
businesses over the coming years. Additionally, we have
introduced a programme to reduce losses and turn around
the operations in Italy, Spain and Central Europe.
During the year and in line with our strategy, we closed 
PC City in Sweden and Markantalo in Finland as they were
loss-making chains.
In Italy, following a strategic review, the first stage of a
comprehensive turnaround plan has been completed. 
We have closed stores, reduced costs, improved stock turn
and integrated PC City within UniEuro. We expect to invest
approximately €60 million to €75 million of cash in total over
the next three financial years to achieve profitability in Italy.
The strategic review of PC City in Spain concluded that we
needed to restructure the business to reduce costs and 
to minimise cash outflow until the Spanish market recovers.
As a result, 11 stores have been closed and the remaining 
33 stores will be reformatted utilising the principles of the 
new store formats in the UK. Having made these changes 
we believe underlying cash losses in Spain will be materially
reduced over the next two years.
In Central Europe, the operations in Hungary have been sold.
The core operations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia
continue to perform well in their markets and remain as part 
of the Group. We will restructure the central office operations
based in the Czech Republic to meet the needs of customers
in these two countries better. The operations in Poland remain
under review.
4 Win on the internet 
We achieved over £1.2 billion of sales over the internet across
Europe in the financial year. Our objective is to achieve a return
of 2% to 3% per annum on internet sales in the medium term. 
The PIXmania e-merchant platform is a leading internet 
sales engine for electrical and computing products in Europe.
To leverage e-merchant, we expect to roll out this platform 
in the UK during the course of the 2009/10 financial year. 
This will provide customers with improved functionality, 
easier navigation, better product information and accessory
attachment. In addition, system changes have been made so
that PIXmania can benefit from access to the Group’s logistics
infrastructure, particularly in the UK, enabling it to reduce its
cross-border stock and pricing risk on sales of products.
We will continue to exploit our successful reserve&collect and
collect@store options for customers in the UK and Europe.
5 Reduce costs
We are using the step change programme to simplify our
business operations. We are changing our operations to make
them better for customers, easier for colleagues and therefore
cheaper to operate. 
Cost savings of £95 million were achieved in the 2008/09
financial year. There remains significant opportunity for
productivity improvements within the Group and we plan to
deliver £200 million in cost savings over the next four years.
There are efficiency initiatives in logistics, services, head office
administration and in-store processes. The changes also
improve the number of deliveries and repairs that are done
right first time. Process improvement initiatives have already
contributed to reductions in levels of stock held by the Group
of between 15% and 20% year on year.

approximately £80 million to £130 million over the medium
term. This will be achieved by improving forecasting and
ordering accuracy; allocation of store stock; in-store fulfilment;
and a new clearance policy incorporating dynamic pricing.
Outlook
The difficult economic backdrop across Europe and reduction
in consumer spending, particularly on discretionary products,
has been well publicised. We expect these conditions to
continue throughout the coming year in many of our markets.
We are well prepared for this environment and continue to
focus on managing costs, margins, stock turn and cash flow,
alongside the Renewal and Transformation plan.
With the improvements to our business we are well positioned
to emerge from the recession with a more compelling offer 
for customers and are confident of our medium term target 
of achieving a 3% to 4% return on sales.

(1) Underlying Group sales exclude sales from businesses to be closed and discontinued operations. Sales for the 53 weeks ended 2008 have been re-presented to reflect this exclusion.
Businesses to be closed comprise the operations of PC City in Sweden and Markantalo in Finland. Discontinued operations in 2008/09 comprises Hungary, while in 2007/08 comprised
Hungary, The Link and Genesis.
(2) Sales in 2008/09 were based on a 52 week year, compared to 53 weeks in 2007/08. On a consistent 52 week basis, underlying Group sales were down 1% and total Group sales were
down 1%.
(3) Like for like sales are calculated based on stores that have been open for a full financial year both at the commencement and end of the financial period. Customer support agreement 
sales are excluded from all UK like for like calculations to remove the distorting effect of the introduction of pay-as-you-go customer support agreements. Operations that are subject 
to closure have sales excluded as of the announcement date. Stores subject to a refurbishment are excluded during the period of refurbishment.
(4) Underlying Retail profit is underlying profit before tax, net finance (charges) / income and net property losses.
(5) Throughout this statement, references are made to ‘underlying’ performance measures. Underlying results are defined as excluding trading results from businesses to be closed, the
amortisation of acquired intangibles, net restructuring and business impairment charges and other one-off non-recurring items, profit on sale of investments, net fair value remeasurements
of financial instruments and, where applicable, discontinued operations. These excluded items are described as ‘non-underlying’. The financial effect of these items is shown in the analyses
on the face of the income statement and in note 4 to the financial statements.
(6) Free Cash Flow relates to continuing operations and comprises net cash flow from operating activities before special pension contributions, plus net finance income, less income tax paid
and net capital expenditure.
(7) The weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of earnings per share for both 2008/09 and 2007/08 has been multiplied by an adjustment factor to reflect the bonus
element of the shares issued under the terms of the rights issue (as described in note 35 to the financial statements). The adjustment factor used was 1.2138.
(8) Unless otherwise noted, figures relate to continuing operations, excluding the results of businesses to be closed. Total revenue including discontinued operations and businesses to 
be closed was £8,415.1 million (2007/08 £8,556.8 million).
(9) UK & Ireland Electricals comprises Currys, Currys.digital and Dixons Travel as well as the operations in Ireland.
(10) UK Computing comprises PC World, DSGi Business and The TechGuys. Like for like sales are for PC World only.
(11) Nordics comprise the Elkjøp Group, and no longer include the results of PC City Sweden and Markantalo which are now classified as businesses to be closed within non-underlying items.
(12) Southern Europe comprises Greece (Kotsovolos and Electro World), Italy (UniEuro), Spain (PC City Spain) and Turkey (Electro World).
(13) Central Europe comprises Electro World operations in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia and no longer includes the results of the discontinued operation Electro World Hungary.
Central Europe results are excluded from like for like comparisons as the number of stores trading is insufficient for a meaningful like for like comparison to be made.
(14) e-commerce division comprises PIXmania and Dixons.co.uk.

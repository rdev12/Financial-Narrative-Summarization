Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Financial performance overview
Ultra’s 2012 results
The order book at the end of 2012 was
£905.0m compared with £950.3m
(£934.4m at constant currencies) at the
end of 2011. Within the order book total,
opening ﬁrm order cover for 2013,
compared to analysts’ consensus revenue
forecasts was 58% (2011: 54%) reﬂecting
in part the signiﬁcant orders for US
sonobuoys received in the fourth quarter
of 2012.
Revenue
Revenue grew by 4.0% to £760.8m, an
increase of £29.1m. The positive effects of
both foreign exchange on translation of
overseas revenues and the incremental
beneﬁt of acquisitions outweighed a
decline in underlying constant currency
revenues of 4.2%.
With over 50% of revenues sold in US
dollars, Ultra beneﬁted from a slight decline
in the US dollar rate to 1.59 (2011: 1.60)
which increased revenues by 0.6%.
Acquisitions contributed a further 7.6%.
Principally this arose due to the full-year
effects of Sotech, Zu and AEP which were
acquired in 2011 and, to a lesser extent,
GigaSat, BeMac and RFI that were
purchased in 2012.
Excluding acquisitions and the effect of
currency movements, there was an organic
decline of 4.2%. There were major
shortfalls in two divisions, Aircraft &
Vehicle Systems and Tactical & Sonar
Systems. In contrast, Information & Power
Systems reported a signiﬁcant increase.
The shortfall in Aircraft & Vehicle Systems
arose primarily in the aircraft controls
business due to lower sales in the noise
and vibration segment because of the
phasing of aircraft deliveries as well as
lower reported sales at AMI in the gap
between the cessation of funded
development work and the beginning of
full production. Tactical & Sonar Systems
was a mixed picture. While sales into the
UK crypto programme and to anti-
submarine warfare in the US were robust,
this was overshadowed by a signiﬁcant
reduction in sales of tactical radios, both to
the export and particularly the US market.
In contrast, revenue from Information &
Power Systems was particularly strong
driven by the further ramping up of the
Oman airport IT project and strong sales of
TACPOD in the US.
Operating proﬁt and margins
Underlying operating proﬁt increased
slightly to £122.2m (2011: £122.1m) and
the margin fell a little to 16.1% (2011:
16.7%). The additional contribution from
acquisitions and favourable foreign
currency translation was offset by an
adverse organic performance.
After a record margin performance in 2011,
Aircraft & Vehicle Systems and Information
& Power Systems both improved again in
2012. However, the overall Group position
was held back by a decline at Tactical &
Sonar Systems, where there was a sharp
fall in the radio business; and the margin
consequently fell signiﬁcantly despite
considerable restructuring cost reductions.
It should be noted that Ultra continues to
invest in research and development to
support future opportunities; this
investment increased by £7.8m to £49.2m
(2011: £41.4m) and represents 6.5% of
Group turnover.
Acquisitions contributed an additional
£6.8m; largely through a full-year
contribution from Sotech and Zu.

Interest and proﬁt before tax
Net ﬁnancing charges, excluding the
unwinding of discounted provisions and
fair value movement on derivatives, was
£6.7m (2011: £7.2m). The ﬁnance cost of
the bank debt was £5.3m (2011: £5.2m),
remaining steady as the closing net debt
was little changed. The ﬁnance cost of the
pension scheme reduced by £0.7m to
£1.3m (2011: £2.0m) because of a reduced
interest charge on scheme liabilities due to
a lower discount rate. The interest on bank
debt was covered 23 times (2011: 23
times) by underlying operating proﬁt*, one
of Ultra’s KPI, see pages 10 and 11 for
more information.
Underlying proﬁt before tax was £115.6m
(2011: £114.9m); an increase of 0.6%.
IFRS Proﬁt before tax
Ultra’s IFRS proﬁt before tax fell from
£91.2m (2011) to £82.8m. The principal
reason for the reduction was an increased
charge for the amortisation of intangibles
arising on acquisition; this reﬂects the
acquisition activity of recent years
(particularly Sotech, Zu and GigaSat).
The table below reconciles the underlying
and the reported number.
Tax, EPS, and dividends
The underlying tax rate reduced to 25.3%
(2011: 28.0%) due to a combination of
lower UK rates and the release of
provisions following the close of certain tax
inquiries around the world.
Headline earnings per share were 124.5p
(2011: 120.2p), an increase of 3.6%. A
ﬁnal dividend of 27.8p (2011: 26.8p) is
proposed. If this is approved at the Annual
General Meeting, it will give a full year
dividend of 40.0p (2011: 38.5p) and will
be covered 3.1 times.

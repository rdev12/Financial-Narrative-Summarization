New infrastructure
The decommissioning of the old infrastructure, site clearing and 
various permitting activities, including environmental and social 
impact assessment (ESIA) preparation, have all continued as 
planned. In the next phase, we will progress to more detailed 
studies and the selection of processing flow charts. This should 
all be finalised by Q2 2015.
We have developed a preliminary layout for the mining and 
processing facilities, and the supporting infrastructure, including 
power, heat and water supplies. We have already commissioned 
the design of the power grid, step-down transformer substation, 
water conduits and boiler house. Some existing facilities will  
need to be dismantled during 2015 and into Q1 2016 before  
we start stripping in the pit; others will be used as temporary 
storage and maintenance facilities during the construction period.
In Q4 2015, we will finalise the audit of the updated feasibility 
study with the inclusion of the estimate of the resources required 
for the open-pit mining option. We will also carry out a full ESIA, 
in line with international best practice.

In September 2014, Polymetal completed the acquisition  
of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan. The addition of this world-
class asset to our high-quality portfolio will provide us with  
a considerable expansion of our existing reserves and mine  
life, as well as a significant exploration upside.
The Kyzyl gold project consists of the Bakyrchik and Bolshevik 
gold deposits. Bakyrchik is one of the largest untapped  
gold deposits in the Former Soviet Union and globally.  
With gold reserves of 6.7 Moz at 7.5 g/t (JORC), this will  
double Polymetal’s gold equivalent reserves. Inferred resources 
of 2.9 Moz gold at 6.6 g/t at Bakyrchik are expected to provide  
a life of mine of 20 years and there is the potential for further 
exploration on adjacent properties, which is covered by 
Bakyrchik and Bolshevik licences.
Kyzyl is located in northeastern Kazakhstan, 75 km from the 
industrial centre of Oskemen (Ust-Kamenogorsk). This is a 
traditional mining region with an established infrastructure  
which gives us good access to power and rail.
Open-plan mining planned
The previous owners had only considered underground  
mining of primary ores, with full processing flowsheet to  
Doré production (including roasting and BIOX technologies). 
Polymetal believes that the challenging underground mining 
conditions make open-pit mining a more attractive option  
from the point of view of risk mitigation and capital expenditure 
reduction, despite the expected high stripping ratio. Open-pit 
mining is judged to be the better option for the first ten years  
(to mine 18 Mt of ore with 120 t of gold), followed by a switch  
to underground mining at a later stage.
Initially, we plan to build a flotation plant for ore processing, 
selling the concentrate to third-party offtakers. We will then 
review the options of either processing the concentrate in  
our POX hub in Amursk or, alternatively, building a new POX 
plant on-site. This sequencing will reduce risks, split capital 
expenditures and, ultimately, increase the return on invested 
capital. The initial capital expenditure for the flotation plant  
and open-pit mine is estimated at US$440-530 million.  
This will be revisited once the feasibility study has been 
completed in Q4 2015.
In 2014, Polymetal submitted documents for open-pit 
development to the regulatory authorities of the Republic  
of Kazakhstan for examination. The Company also carried  
out a preliminary assessment of the environmental impact and 
held a series of public consultations with the local Bakyrchik 
community with positive outcomes. The application for the 
statutory permits for open-pit mining should be completed  
with the regulatory authorities in Q2 2015.
Preparatory work underway
We have now started exploration and in-fill drilling in the main 
licence area and along the edges/borders of the deposit. 
Planned exploration is set to continue in 2015 (see table on  
the next page). In Q3-4 2014, we commenced the engineering 
surveys required to design mining and processing facilities,  
and also performed a technical and economic assessment  
of the mining equipment needed for open-pit mining.
From the bulk samples collected, pilot metallurgical testing  
of the Kyzyl ore has confirmed the viability of ore flotation  
to concentrate. This signals the potential to improve on  
the parameters achieved in the previous test work.

Sustained investment  
in standalone exploration
Exploration
Despite the current weak commodity 
price levels, our sustained investment  
in both greenfield and brownfield 
exploration is one of the core pillars of  
our strategy. We strongly believe that  
our long-term growth is underpinned  
by these efforts. In selecting licence  
areas for exploration, we focus on areas 
adjacent to our processing hubs or 
potential hubs (brownfield), and on assets 
with the potential to become sizeable 
standalone operations. The advancement 
of the exploration project is subject to 
rigorous review through pre-established 
project stages that are linked to our 
estimate of the resource potential and  
its economic prospects. At any stage,  
a project may be terminated, suspended  
or moved to the next exploration stage. 
In 2014, we completed internal  
restructuring of the exploration  
function at Polymetal that allowed us  
to decentralise, reduce red tape and  
to increase the responsibility of local 
geology project managers for the 
outcome of the project. This will also 
speed up the project evaluation process 
and consequent turnover of projects and 
licences that we hold.
Our key greenfield exploration targets  
for 2014 were:
•	 continued exploration at key greenfield 
gold assets (Svetloye, Kutyn, 
Maminskoye and Kyzyl), preparing 
them for development stage;
•	 exploration for platinum group  
metals (PGM) deposits in the Karelia  
and Ekaterinburg regions in order  
to establish new hard-rock PGM 
resources sufficient for a standalone 
mining operation.
 
Key greenfield projects
As a result of exploration activities during 
the year, significant resource-to-reserve 
conversions were achieved. Maiden ore 
reserves and mineral resources estimates 
were completed for several greenfield 
and brownfield projects. 
Karelia PGM project
One of our newest greenfield exploration 
projects, Viksha (Semcha), is now very 
well positioned to establish a large PGM 
resource in Karelia, an accessible region 
with developed infrastructure. We have 
been exploring the precious metals 
mineralisation (gold, platinum and 
palladium) of the Koykar ore field. 
Our activities in 2014 were focused on 
drilling to a depth of 100 m at the large 
PGM ore body identified along the known 
surface outcrop. Core drilling (18.7 km) 
was carried out at the Viksha, Kenti 
and Shagri areas. In these areas, PGM 
mineralisation within the ferrous titanium 
horizon was revealed with a steady width 
at shallow depths. Platinum, gold and 
palladium mineralisation was identified 
with an average palladium equivalent 
grade of 1.8-2.6 g/t. Mineralised potential 
in the most explored part of the field 
(Viksha) is estimated at 57 tonnes of 
palladium equivalent. The total mineralised 
potential of the Koykar sill is estimated at 
350-400 tonnes of palladium equivalent, 
including 190 tonnes at an open-pittable 
depth of 150 m. Viksha’s statutory 
feasibility study and the statutory GKZ 
reserves were approved by the Russian 
state authorities in 2014; in 2015 we will 
be converting the exploration licence  
to exploration and mining. 
Svetloye
In 2014, we completed an initial  
ore reserves estimate at Svetloye  
of 677 GE Koz with an additional  
80 GE Koz of mineral resources. Project 
development has been approved by the 
Polymetal Board and Svetloye will now 
become part of Khakanja hub. In 2014, 
our drilling campaign focused on the 
Elena and Emi zones, as well as prospect 
drilling in the Ludmila zone and Emi 
flanks. In 2015, along with the start of 
construction, we will prepare for mining  
at Svetloye with the in-fill detailed drilling.  
To further increase the resource potential, 
we will start prospecting at the new 
licence area, Pravosekchenskaya.
Kutyn
At Kutyn, we targeted the assessment  
of oxidized open-pittable resources and 
the increase of the resource potential of 
the deposit by discovering new ore 
bodies. The works were focused on 
mineralisation located near the surface 
and suitable for heap leaching, including 
extensions of known ore bodies. Detailed 
drilling and mapping of ore bodies  
in Sedlovinnaya, Rodnikovaya and 
Geophyzicheskaya enabled us to perform 
geotechnical mapping of ores amenable 
to cyanidation. Trenching was performed 
in the Itylskaya, Delinskaya, Dzhuaty-1 
and Dzhuaty-2 ore zones. Known and 
new ore bodies have been traced along 
the strike. 
The initial ore reserves estimate  
and the pre-feasibility study at Kutyn 
(completed in 2015) confirmed 386 Koz, 
with additional mineral resources of 
649 Koz. The pre-feasibility study entails 
an all-year-round 700 Ktpa open-pit 
heap-leach operation with an initial  
mine life of five years. Annual average 
production is estimated to be 50 Koz  
of gold with average all-in sustaining  
costs of US$750/oz. Primary (non-oxide) 
mineralisation is not included in the 
current study and therefore not included 
in the ore reserve. Pre-production capital 
expenditure is estimated at US$52 million. 
However, with the current focus on the 
development of the Kyzyl project, we will 
consider sale or partnership to advance 
the development of the asset.
Maminskoye
In-fill drilling continued at Maminskoye  
in the first half of 2014. Following the 
acquisition of the Kyzyl project, we 
decided to re-prioritise the project 
pipeline and, accordingly, slow down  
the development of Maminskoye, 
suspending further exploration activities.

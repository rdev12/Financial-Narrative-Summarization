Chairman’ s Statement
I am delighted to report on the considerable
progress achieved during 2010/11 under
our new Group Chief Executive, Miles
Roberts, who joined on 4 May 2010.
Trading performance improved significantly,
a new and ambitious strategic vision was
set, performance measures are established
which will generate significant shareholder
value, and major corporate developments
have been delivered, not least the acquisition
of Otor in France. 
Corporate developments 
and strategy
In July 2010 we announced that DS Smith
had agreed to purchase Otor, a leading
packaging business in France. The acquisition
was completed on 1 September 2010. To
maintain prudent levels of debt, we issued
an additional 39.3 million shares at the time
of agreement. This share issue was heavily
oversubscribed and placed at a discount of
less than 1% to the opening share price on
the day. The combined operations in France
have been re-branded as DS Smith
Packaging France under a management
team drawn from both businesses. This
transaction has exceeded our expectations
both in terms of financial returns and the
support we have received from customers. 
In December 2010 Miles presented his
strategic vision for the Group to our investors.
That vision is set out in the preceding pages
of this document and will transform the
financial profile of the business. The
management team have made a strong start
in implementing the plan and the results for
the year show that this strategy is already
yielding results. The Otor acquisition, though
it pre-dated the strategic announcement, fits
squarely into the vision, as it accelerates our
leadership in corrugated packaging
solutions for consumer goods customers. 
Trading performance
The restructuring and repositioning of the 
DS Smith Group in the recent difficult years
has enabled us to benefit fully from the
recovery in the European economy. Our
focus on fast moving consumer goods
customers, central to the Group’s strategy,
has served us well as we report like-for-like
volume growth of 8% in our packaging
business for the year. This growth, together
with the benefits of tight cost control, 
resulted in an adjusted operating profit 
“The full year dividend has been increased by 
41.3%. I am confident that the coming year 
will be one of considerable further progress.”

BUSINESS 
REVIEW GOVERNANCE
NOTICE 
OF MEETING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
of £136.1 million, an increase of 38.7%
year-on-year, or 20.0% excluding the benefit
of the Otor acquisition. This improvement
has been achieved despite significant input
cost increases, which we have recovered 
through pricing. Adjusted earnings 
per share rose 36.0% to 18.9 pence
(2009/10: 13.9 pence). 
Dividend
The Board considers the dividend to be an
important component of shareholder returns.
As part of the review of business strategy,
we re-defined our dividend policy to reflect
the expected change in our financial profile.
In considering dividends, the Board will be
mindful of the Group’s debt levels, earnings
growth potential and opportunities for
profitable growth. To sustain a progressive
dividend policy, the Board anticipates that
dividend cover should average 2.0 to 2.5
times through the cycle. 
Accordingly, the Board recommends a 
final dividend for the year 2010/11 of 
4.5 pence per share which, together with
the interim dividend of 2.0 pence, gives 
a total dividend for the year of 6.5 pence
(2009/10: 4.6 pence). This represents 
an increase of 41.3% over the prior year, 
a cover of 2.9 times in relation to our
adjusted earnings per share (2009/10: 
3.0 times), and is a significant first step
towards our target.
Board changes
DS Smith has a very strong Board. This
reflects the exciting potential the Company
has for growth in the coming years.
In addition to welcoming Miles Roberts, 
our Group Chief Executive, at the start 
of the financial year, we have had two 
other Board changes. We are delighted 
that Gareth Davis joined the Board on 
1 June 2010, having previously been 
Chief Executive of Imperial Tobacco PLC
from 1996 to 2010. He also is Chairman 
of Wolseley plc and of William Hill PLC. 
As expected, he has brought a great deal 
of vigour as well as highly relevant
experience to the Board discussions.
Bob Beeston retired from the Board in
December 2010 having served for ten
years, for much of that period as Senior
Independent Director. I would like to thank
him for his ceaseless challenge and support. 
I am also pleased to congratulate another
non-Executive Director, Philippe Mellier, 
on his appointment as Group Chief
Executive Officer of De Beers. 
After ten years as our Company Secretary,
Carolyn Cattermole will be leaving the
Group on 30 June 2011. I would like to
thank her for the tremendous support she 
has given the Board and particularly me
over these years and wish her well in her
future career. I am pleased to report that
Matthew Jowett will be joining the Group 
as Company Secretary and General
Counsel, taking over the role from 
1 July 2011. He brings substantial
international and business experience 
and we look forward to working with him. 
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank all our colleagues across the
business for their continued hard work and
commitment. It has been their support for 
our efforts to recover rising input costs and
sustain growth by focusing on delivering 
the service, quality and innovation our
customers demand that has enabled us 
to deliver our profit performance. 
I am confident that the coming year will 
be one of considerable further progress.

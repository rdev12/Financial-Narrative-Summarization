Tangent Marketing Services – direct marketing
Tangent harnesses together multiple digital platforms 
to offer a complete targeted marketing solution to its clients. 
T angent aims to turn insight into more effective campaigns.
Our delivery involves a piece of customised and personalised 
marketing collateral, ranging from an email, a web 
page, a SMS message to a digitally printed mail piece.
The creative element is optimised to take the customer 
data into consideration and varies in content and imagery 
on a person by person basis. This ensures the campaign 
is aligned to customer behaviour and is more likely to 
result in higher conversion and response rates.
Each response can be measured independently, providing 
insight for future communications. For Sainsbury’s 
the redemption rate increased from 17% to 54% for 
one campaign when data on previous buying habits 
was used to optimise the creative process.
Customers include Creston, Sainsbury’s, TBWA and 
Virgin Mobile.

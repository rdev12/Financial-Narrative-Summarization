 Highlights
We are one of the most international banking  
and financial services organisations in the world.
Group
Our operating model  
consists of four global 
businesses, a Corporate  
Centre and five geographical 
regions, supported by 11  
global functions. 
During the year, we changed 
our reportable segments from 
regions to global businesses. 
We also moved certain business 
portfolios and functions into the 
newly created Corporate Centre.

Performance highlights  
for 2016
Strategy execution 
 – Following our sale of 
operations in Brazil,  
we completed a $2.5bn  
share buy-back. 
 – We further reduced our 
risk-weighted assets (‘RWAs’) 
as a result of our sale of 
operations in Brazil and  
other management actions.
 – Investment in costs to achieve 
of $4.0bn to date has 
generated annual run rate 
savings of $3.7bn.
 – We now expect to deliver 
annualised cost savings of 
around $6bn by the end of 
2017, around $1bn above the 
top end of our original target, 
while continuing to invest in 
regulatory programmes and 
compliance. We will invest  
an equivalent total of around 
$6bn over the same timeframe. 
 – We increased market share in 
a number of key markets and 
international product areas, 
including trade finance in 
Hong Kong and Singapore.
Financial performance
 – Reported profit before  
tax of $7.1bn was $11.8bn  
lower than in 2015, and  
was adversely impacted  
by significant items of $12.2bn. 
These included a $3.2bn write-
off of goodwill in our Global 
Private Banking (‘GPB’) 
business in Europe, costs to 
achieve of $3.1bn, adverse fair 
value movements of $1.8bn 
arising from changes in credit 
spreads on our own debt 
designated at fair value, and 
the impact of our sale of 
operations in Brazil.
 – Reported revenue of $48.0bn 
was down $11.8bn. Loan 
impairment charges and other 
credit risk provisions (‘LICs’) 
fell by $0.3bn and reported 
operating expenses rose  
by $40m.
 – Adjusted profit before tax  
of $19.3bn, down $0.2bn, 
reflected lower revenue  
and higher LICs, partly offset 
by a reduction in operating 
expenses. In 2016, we 
achieved positive adjusted 
jaws of 1.2%.
 – Adjusted revenue fell by  
$1.3bn or 2% despite 
improved performance in 
Commercial Banking (‘CMB’) 
and Global Banking and 
Markets (‘GB&M’). Retail 
Banking and Wealth 
Management (‘RBWM’)  
and GPB were impacted  
by challenging  
market conditions. 
 – Adjusted operating expenses 
fell by $1.2bn or 4%, reflecting 
our cost-saving initiatives and 
focus on cost management. 
We continued to invest in 
regulatory programmes  
and compliance.
Capital
 – Our capital position further 
strengthened during the year, 
with a common equity tier 1 
(‘CET1’) ratio at 31 December 
2016 of 13.6%, up from 11.9% 
at 31 December 2015, mainly 
due to RWA reduction 
initiatives and the change  
in the regulatory treatment  
of our holding in Bank of 
Communications Co.,  
Limited (‘BoCom’).

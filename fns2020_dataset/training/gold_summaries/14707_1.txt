 OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
I am pleased to report a further year of strong revenue and profit growth for Sports 
Direct. The results for the year are even more impressive given that the prior year 
included the UEFA European Championships and the 2012 London Olympics, and have 
been achieved in a retail environment that remains challenging. The Group has grown 
consistently, and the resilience and flexibility of our business model continues to allow 
us to offer an unrivalled product range, offering exceptional quality and unbeatable 
value. We will continue to be the Consumers’ Champion. 
Building on our strategy of broadening our customer base through expansion, during 
the year we have opened c.300,000 net sq. ft. of additional retail space across the UK, 
re-fitting a further c.300,000 sq. ft. In Europe we have opened c.200,000 net sq. ft. of 
retail space in our existing business and have acquired a further c.1.9 million sq. ft. 
with our acquisitions in Austria and the Baltics.
The out-performance that we have achieved over recent years truly serves to 
demonstrate how successful the Employee Bonus Share Scheme has been in motivating 
our employees to work towards a shared goal. The 2009 scheme targets were achieved 
and the shares vested in August 2012 and 2013, with over 2,000 employees receiving 
life-changing sums as reward for their hard work and dedication to the business over 
the last five years. 
Underlying EBITDA targets under the 2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme for FY12, 
FY13 and FY14 have been met. With only one target left to achieve, the scheme is 
also on course to vest in 2015 and 2017. I am also delighted that, following a General 
Meeting on 2 July, shareholders have now given approval for a new 2015 Bonus Share 
Scheme. This will ensure the commitment of our employees for many more years to 
come.
GROUP 
For the year we increased Group revenue by 23.8% to £2,706.0m. This was primarily 
due to the Retail division, where we grew revenues by 25.9%, including a 24.1% 
increase in Sports Retail revenue partly due to the acquisition of EAG in Austria and 
SIG in the Baltic region. Premium Lifestyle revenue also grew by 49.4%, due largely to 
the acquisition of Republic in February 2013.
Group gross margin in the year increased by 180 basis points from 40.9% to 42.7%. 
Sports Retail division gross margin increased by 260 basis points to 42.9% (FY13: 
40.3%), while Brands division gross margin decreased to 43.1% (FY13: 44.9%).
Group operating costs increased 35.9% to £826.1m (FY13: £607.9m). Sports Retail and 
Brands division operating costs were £656.3m (FY13: £479.6m) 
(1)
 and £63.1m (FY13: 
£66.6m), respectively. The increase in Group operating costs is mainly attributable 
to our recent acquisitions in Austria and the Baltics. Excluding the impact of these 
acquisitions, Group operating costs increased by 19.7%. Operating costs increased 
slightly as a percentage of sales from 27.8% in FY13 to 29.7% in FY14, excluding the 
impact of acquisitions, due to provision reversals in the prior year and the impact of a 
full year of costs within Republic.
Reflecting the success of our approach – balancing revenues and gross margin, while 
maintaining a tight focus on operating costs – we grew Group underlying EBITDA 
(before scheme costs) for the year by 15.0% to £331.1m (FY13: £287.9m). Within this 
underlying EBITDA, we increased the Retail division EBITDA by 15.3% to £300.9m 
(FY13: £260.9m) while the Brands division EBITDA increased by 11.9% to £30.2m 
(FY13: £27.0m).
Excluded from underlying EBITDA is an £11.9m (FY13: £22.1m) charge in respect of 
the 2009 and 2011 Employee Bonus Share Schemes and the Executive Bonus Share 
Scheme. This charge has been taken centrally and, except in note 4 to the accounts, is 
not reflected in the divisional (Retail and Brands) numbers in this report. 
For the year, Group underlying profit before tax increased 19.8% to £249.3m, primarily 
as a result of the £43.2m increase in EBITDA (pre-scheme costs) and a £10.2m 
reduction in Employee Bonus Share Scheme charges offset by a £9.3m increase in 
depreciation and amortisation. Underlying EPS for the year increased by 19.3% to 
32.1p (FY13: 26.9p). 
Net debt at 27 April 2014 was £212.0m (28 April 2013: £154.0m), which is 0.66 times 
reported EBITDA (28 April 2013: 0.58 times). Reported EBITDA includes realised foreign 
exchange gains/losses in selling and administration costs and the Employee Bonus 
Share Scheme charges.

SPORTS RETAIL 
Sports Retail revenue growth has continued with the acquisition of two international 
subsidiaries in Austria and the Baltics, as well as further enhancements in our retail 
and logistics infrastructure.
Sports Retail sales grew 24.1% to £2,274.4m (FY13: £1,833.3m), driven by our recent 
European acquisitions and strong growth in our existing business. Sports Retail 
gross margin for the year increased by 260 basis points to 42.9% (FY13: 40.3%).This 
increase is mainly attributable to on-going investment in our ‘better and best’ product 
range and the further development of Group Brands. 
Sales in the second half of the year were up 25.5% to £1,138.3m (FY13 H2: £907.3m). 
Gross margins for the second half of the year improved to 42.5% (FY13 H2: 39.7%). 
Sports Retail like-for-like gross contribution, which excludes online, increased by 
10.5%, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth in this KPI against a tough 
comparator last year which included the UEFA European Championships and the 2012 
London Olympics (FY13: +10.6% / FY12: +0.7% / FY11: +6.8% / FY10: +3.7%). 
Sports Retail like-for-like contribution is defined as the percentage change in gross 
contribution in the successive 12-month period. A like-for-like store is one that has 
been trading for the full 12 months in both periods and has not been affected by a 
significant change, such as a major refurbishment. The number of stores included in 
this year’s KPI is 339 (FY13: 340).
Sports Retail operating costs increased by 36.8% to £656.3m, including acquisitions 
(FY13: £479.6m). Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by 
16.3% to £557.6m - operating costs in H2 increased by 12.3% to £283.6m (FY13 H2: 
£252.6m).

SPORTS DIRECT INTERNATIONAL PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 13 ONLINE 
We have experienced growth in online revenue which has increased by 26.8% from £264.6m to £335.4m in the year.  
This represented 17.1% of Sports Retail sales (FY13: 15.0%), excluding wholesale sales and sales in EAG and SIG (including 
EAG and SIG, online revenue represented 15.1% of Sports Retail sales). Online sales to non-UK customers now represent 
46.5% of all online Sports Retail sales (FY13: 35.1%) and 48.2% of online contribution (FY13: 33.8%)
Our multi-channel offering remains a strategic focus for the Group. Order fulfilment and information technology solutions 
are developed in-house with full back-up support from our National Distribution Centre in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Specific 
customer landing pages, and ‘My Account’ pages have now been upgraded and provide an improved customer experience.  
401 of the UK store fascia are now branded SPORTSDIRECT.com, an increase of 25 from last year (FY13: 376).
Approximately 25% of visits to SPORTSDIRECT.com are now made via mobile devices. Given the rapid developments in this 
area, we have updated our mobile site to support multiple language and currency options. Customer satisfaction through 
a multi-channel offering remains one of our key areas of focus. During FY15 we aim to enhance the customer experience by 
upgrading our search facility to ensure that the results are as relevant as possible. We are developing additional functionality 
including click & collect, which is expected to be rolled-out in UK Sports Direct stores during Autumn/Winter 2014, online gift 
cards and the opportunity to open a credit facility.
STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT & BUSINESS REVIEW  
CONTINUED
Store wages were up 37.5% in the year to £211.4m (FY13: £153.7m) but as a 
percentage of sales increased only slightly to 9.3% (FY13: 8.4%). Sports Retail 
premises costs increased by 33.1% to £192.7m (FY13: £144.8m), largely due to 
a £14.6m reversal of our onerous lease provision in FY13 following the closure of 
a significant number of unprofitable stores. Excluding the impact of this reversal, 
premises costs increased by 20.9%. Other operating costs were up 32.8% to £246.6m 
(FY13: £185.7m), increasing slightly as a percentage of sales to 10.8% (FY13: 10.1%).
The currency impact due to the change in the Euro:Sterling exchange rate was a cost of 
£5.6m in the current year (FY13: a gain of £4.6m).
Underlying EBITDA for Sports Retail was £321.3m (FY13: £259.9m), an increase of 
23.6% for the year (20.2% excluding the impact of acquisitions). This increase was 
driven by a £236.6m increase in gross profit (including acquisitions), due to the  
growth in store contribution and online sales, offset by the £176.7m increase in 
operating costs.
The Group’s retail businesses performed strongly in a difficult economic environment. 
Our retail model, offering outstanding value to our customers, remains resilient, both 
in the UK and internationally. Throughout the year, we continued to focus on offering 
our customers the most comprehensive product range, the best availability and value 
while minimising operating costs as a percentage of gross sales.  
The Group has continued its planned expansion into Europe with the acquisition  
of two key subsidiaries. In June 2013, the Group acquired a 51% stake in the Sports 
Eybl & Sports Experts Group AG (EAG), a leading sports retailer with stores in Austria 
and Germany. The remaining 49% of the business was subsequently acquired in 
March 2014. In August 2013, the Group acquired a 60% shareholding in Sportland 
International Group (SIG), the market leader in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia  
and Lithuania.
We are currently in the final design stages for Phase three of the development of our 
National Distribution Centre in Shirebrook, the construction of an additional c.600,000 
sq. ft. warehouse and office facility. Preparation of the site is already in progress, 
with the aim of commencing works in September 2014, and completion of the project 
anticipated for late 2015.
Employee training continues to be a major area of investment. During the last year  
over 50,000 hours were devoted to training and developing our colleagues. Our 
National Training Facility in Shirebrook is committed to maximising the individual 
performances of our employees, and to helping others to identify, work towards, and 
achieve their own distinct career goals.
The National Training Facility is supported by Nike and Puma, who have their own 
individual environments. This unique training experience is the only centre of its type 
globally for both Nike and Puma.
Our store portfolio remains constantly under review with the performance of each 
store and ways of maximising performance being regularly examined. During the year 
we opened 32 stores in the UK, closing 10 and have opened an additional 15 stores 
in Europe, closing five. Through acquisitions we also added a further 134

 stores in 
Austria and the Baltics.

  (FY13: c.1.1m sq. ft.) across the rest of Europe, including an

of our existing retail store space in the UK.

(3) Due to differing methodologies, this implies a range between 2.75m sq. ft - 3.25m sq. ft.
During the year, the expansion of the Shirebrook Sports Direct store was also 
completed. The expanded store includes dedicated Nike and Puma areas as well as 
enhanced running, outdoor, football and women’s fitness areas. Following the success 
of the Shirebrook store, our Oxford Street store relocated to the former HMV store in 
May 2014. The continued evolution of the whole estate and in particular, key city centre 
stores, is vital in building relationships with third-party brands and will continue with 
the re-development of our Glasgow store which is expected to finish in Autumn 2014.
In FY15 we are targeting to re-fit c.400,000 sq.ft. of retail space across the UK.

In the 52 weeks to 27 April 2014, rent reviews have been agreed on 30 stores. The 
average increase in rent was 0.64% (0.13% annual equivalent). There are currently 41 
rent reviews outstanding with a further 54 falling due in FY15. Our lease expiry profile 
over all leasehold stores (excluding Lillywhites Piccadilly) is now 5.1 years, including 
68 stores with contractual expiries or break dates within the next 12 months.  This 
significant amount of flexibility within our portfolio allows us to continue to monitor and 
adapt our format to the rapidly changing multi-channel environment.
In the current financial year, we are targeting to open between 30 and 40 stores, c.30% 
of which are expected to be relocations. In the first quarter we have already opened 
10 stores, and have closed five, of which four were due to relocations within the same 
town.
We continue to benefit from the acquisition of the properties purchased from Mike 
Ashley in 2012, which have resulted in a £9.4m increase to EBITDA when viewed 
against a proforma comparative.

All of the above stores are operated by companies wholly-owned by the Group, except 
Portugal, where the Group owns 50.1% and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania where the 
Group owns 60.0%. As part of the accelerated growth programme in our European 
subsidiary, we now have an additional 10 stores in Europe and have entered two new 
countries (Spain and Poland). Including our recent acquisitions in Austria and the 
Baltic region, we are now active in 19 countries across Europe (includes associates in 
the Republic of Ireland and Iceland). 
The integration of EAG initially focused on the Sports Expert format, but has now been 
extended to include the Eybl fascia. Sports Direct point of sale systems are now in all 
stores with all EAG stock now centrally managed. While the strategic focus to date 
has been the sell-through of legacy stock, we also intent to rebrand all EAG stores to 
SPORTSDIRECT.com.
Our strategy remains to identify partners in new territories while continuing to expand 
our operations in the countries where we currently trade. For FY15, in line with our 
accelerated European expansion, we are targeting 10-15 organic new stores. In the first 
quarter, we have opened three stores, closing two.
The Group has a 50% shareholding in the Heatons chain which operates 15 Sports 
Direct stores in Northern Ireland and 26 sports stores in the Republic of Ireland. We also 
own a 25% shareholding in the Sports Direct store in Iceland.
Local management continue to work hard to ensure that all new and existing stores in 
Europe are committed to striving towards the operational efficiencies and standards 
that exist across our UK sports stores.

PREMIUM LIFESTYLE 
Premium Lifestyle sales grew 49.4% to £214.1m (FY13: £143.3m), in large part due to 
the inclusion of a full year’s trading in Republic which was acquired in February 2013. 
Premium Lifestyle gross margin for the year decreased by 350 basis points to 40.3% 
(FY13: 43.8%) due to the clearance of old stock in the year.
Premium Lifestyle operating costs including Republic increased by 72.9% to £106.7m 
(FY13: £61.7m). Excluding Republic, operating costs increased by 5.2% to £58.7m 
(FY13: £55.8m). 
Underlying EBITDA for Premium Lifestyle was a loss of £20.4m (FY13: £1.0m profit). 
This was largely due to significant re-structuring costs within Republic. We are 
targeting to see the benefit of this re-structuring, along with the impact of the closure 
of a significant number of loss-making stores in the year, in FY15. 
Integration of our Premium Lifestyle division has continued in the year, including IT 
systems in Flannels, Cruise and Republic, and the relocation of the Flannels head 
office to our site in Wigan. The previous Republic warehouse and head office has been 
relocated to the existing USC facilities, and 53 former Republic stores were converted 
to the USC fascia. Not withstanding this progress, supply from major third-party 
brands remains very challenging.
The FY13 results included nine months of trading for Flannels and two months for 
Republic. 
Online revenue in the division increased by 57.6% in the year to £37.5m (FY13: 
£23.8m). During the year the division’s eCommerce platforms have been integrated 
with the Group’s IT systems. These now consist of Flannels.com, Cruisefashion.co.uk, 
and USC.co.uk. 
USC online sales increased by 116.5% to £23.6m (FY13: £10.9m) due to improved 
stock availability and increased brand awareness. The launch of the USC and Flannels 
mobile platforms, in November 2013, has also contributed towards the increase in 
online sales in the Premium Lifestyle division.
At the year end, the Premium Lifestyle division traded from 126 stores under five main 
fascias:

BRANDS  
The Group’s brand portfolio includes a wide variety of world-famous sport, fashion and 
lifestyle brands. The Group’s Retail division sells products under these Group brands 
in its stores, and the Brands division exploits the brands through its wholesale and 
licensing activities. The Brands division continues to sponsor a variety of prestigious 
events and retains a variety of globally-recognised, high-profile sportsmen and women 
as brand ambassadors.
Brands division total revenue increased by 4.1% to £217.5m (FY13: £209.0m). 
Wholesale revenues were up 3.9% to £185.2m (FY13: £178.3m), with continued growth 
in the key US market which now represents 39.4% of total wholesale revenue.
Brands gross margin decreased by 180 basis points to 43.1% (FY13: 44.9%). 
Wholesale gross margins fell 220 basis points to 33.2% (FY13: 35.4%) negatively 
impacted by the loss of Firetrap wholesale income and stock clearance in Gelert, 
acquired in July 2013. Following the acquisition of the Gelert brand and assets from 
the administrator the business underwent a complete customer and operational review, 
resulting in significant cost savings and a more efficient business going forward.
Licensing revenues in the year were up 5.2% to £32.3m (FY13: £30.7m). We 
signed 84 new licence agreements, covering multiple brands, product categories 
and geographies, with minimum contracted values of $50.7m over the life of the 
agreements. At 27 April 2014, the Group had 427 licence agreements worldwide, 
across 273 licensees with contracted minimums of $309m over the remaining life of 
the agreements.
Longer term, we still regard licensing as the key driver of Brands division profitability 
and central to the overall growth of the Brands business. The key growth areas are 
expected to include Asia Pacific, the Middle East and North Africa and the Americas 
which should compensate for a more challenging licensing landscape in the UK and 
Europe, as Sports Retail continues to expand in these territories. 
Operating costs decreased by 5.3% to £63.1m (FY13: £66.6m) as we begin to benefit 
from the consolidation of our back office functions, with both Firetrap and Gelert now 
fully integrated. The full impact of the consolidation of back office functions across the 
Brands division is expected to be felt in FY15. As a result of cost savings, underlying 
EBITDA increased by 11.9% to £30.2m (FY13: £27.0m).
We continue to focus on developing world-class products that are endorsed by leading 
athletes on the field of play and continue to invest in our key brands.
STRATEGIC REPORT
16  STRATEGIC REPORT
EMPLOYEES 
The success of the Group has largely been 
created by our c.28,000 employees, whose 
dedication and commitment has been 
sustained over many years. Their enthusiasm 
and “One Team” attitude has assisted the 
Group to succeed where many other retailers 
have failed. The Board are extremely grateful 
for the time that our employees have taken to 
develop their skills and expertise. We promote 
staff training wherever possible to enable our 
employees to be the best that they can be. 
The 2009 and 2011 Employee Bonus Share 
Schemes have been fundamental tools in the 
motivation and incentivisation of employees. 
Under the 2009 Employee Bonus Share 
Scheme, c.27 million shares vested with 
our eligible employees. Subject to achieving 
the FY15 EBITDA target, and satisfactory 
personal performance, a further c.20 million 
shares are expected to vest under the 2011 
Employee Bonus Share Scheme.
CONTRACTS ESSENTIAL TO THE BUSINESS OF THE GROUP 
The Group has long-established relationships with Nike and adidas, the major 
suppliers of third-party branded sporting goods, and considers that continued supplies 
from these companies are critical to the business of the Group.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  
The Corporate Responsibility Report is on pages 20 to 23 and a review of the 
assessment of the Group’s impact on the environment is included in the Corporate 
Responsibility Report on page 22.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
The Group’s success depends on the strength of the Group brands and, to a lesser 
extent, the licensed-in brands.
The Group’s efforts to continually develop or obtain brands in a timely manner or at all 
may be unsuccessful.
OUTLOOK 
Overall trading since the year end has been in line with management’s expectations 
with some stronger weeks offset by England’s disappointing World Cup matches. 
The Group’s performance continues to benefit from a number of factors including the 
historic investment in gross margin, investment in product range and availability, 
increased operating efficiencies and the continued optimisation of the Group’s in-store 
and web product offer. 
Based on the performance to date, we are very confident of achieving the final EBITDA 
target of £300m (before scheme costs) under the 2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme. 
Consistent with previous guidance, we continue to target an underlying EBITDA 
target of £360m (before the charge for the 2011 Employee & Executive Bonus 
Share Schemes). The Group’s success is underpinned by our core strategy, offering 
our customers a wide range of products which represent exceptional quality and 
unbeatable value.
 
Dave Forsey 
Chief Executive
17 July 2014
The 2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme underlying EBITDA targets (before scheme costs), relate to performance between FY12 and FY15. The FY12 target of £215m, the FY13 
target of £250m, and the FY14 target of £260m have all been achieved. The FY15 target is £300m (before scheme costs), and this final target, combined with the individual 
employee’s satisfactory personal performance, must be achieved in order for the scheme to vest.
Shares under the 2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme are due to vest in 2015 and 2017. Under the 2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme employees are eligible for awards on a 
pro-rata basis depending on their length of service with the Group. Awards under the 2011 scheme are granted at either 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% of the employees’ base pay. 
Subject to the performance criteria being fulfilled, c.5 million shares are due to vest in 2015 and c.15 million shares are due to vest in 2017.
An additional 3 million shares are due to vest with one of our Executive Directors and two members of senior management in 2017 under the Executive Bonus Share Scheme, 
subject to performance criteria being fulfilled. The Executive Bonus Share Scheme performance targets mirror those to be applied to awards under the 2011 Employee Bonus  
Share Scheme. 
As a result of the successes of previous schemes, the 2015 Bonus Share Scheme has been devised to encourage further outstanding employee performance. The scheme will 
provide for the grant of nil-cost options over up to 25 million shares. The vestings are dependant on particularly stretching performance criteria spanning between FY16 and FY19. 
With targets of £480m for FY16, £570m for FY17, £650m for FY18 and £750m for FY19, the scheme has the potential to not only motivate employees, but also to create a further 
substantial increase in shareholder value.

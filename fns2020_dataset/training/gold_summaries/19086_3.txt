 I wrote a year ago that our market remains 
challenging and competitive; this has 
continued with new supply coming into the 
market and consumer expectations evermore 
demanding. We are also expecting further 
cost inflation as a result of the introduction  
of the living wage from April 2016. These 
challenges mean we need to remain on top of 
our game, and continue to make the most of 
the outstanding assets we have in our estate.
Against this backdrop, I’m delighted that we 
are able to report adjusted EPS growth of  
9.5% in the year. We’ve achieved this while 
making good progress operationally, with  
the integration of Orchid continuing, the 
completion of the pub systems project, further 
single site acquisitions in the UK and Germany, 
and growing further our like-for-like estate.
The resumption of a dividend is a further 
acknowledgement of the improvement in  
the Company’s financial position over recent 
years as well as the Board’s confidence in  
the future prospects for the business. This, 
together with the agreement reached with the 
pension trustees as a part of the 2013 triennial 
settlement, means that the Directors are 
recommending the payment of a dividend of  
5p per share, with a progressive policy going 
forward based on the performance of  
the business.
The market in which 
we operate remains 
challenging and 
competitive.

Operational highlights
I was delighted to end the year with the 
announcement of Phil Urban’s appointment  
as our new Chief Executive. Phil brings a 
wealth of experience from the wider leisure 
sector, has a strong track record of delivery 
and has had a significant impact on the 
business since joining as Chief Operating 
Officer in January. We welcome Phil to the 
Board and look forward to working with  
him to take the business forward.
I would also like to thank Alistair Darby for  
his significant contribution to the business in 
his three years as Chief Executive. We wish 
him all the best for the future.
Also on the Board, we appointed Stewart 
Gilliland as Senior Independent Director in 
February 2015, continuing the strong progress 
we have shown in this area in recent years. 
Since the year end Piedmont Inc. has nominated 
Josh Levy as one of its two non-independent 
representative Board Directors, replacing 
Douglas McMahon. Josh was therefore 
appointed to the Board on 13 November,  
and will stand for reappointment at the  
Annual General Meeting in January. I would 
like to welcome Josh to the Board and thank 
Douglas for his contribution. I remain very 
pleased with the makeup of the Board and 
how we continue to work together to drive  
the business forward.
As ever in this industry, our business is  
driven by the hard work and commitment  
of our employees, and I would like to thank 
them all on behalf of the Board for their 
continued efforts. It is our team of dedicated 
and passionate people who work hard to 
delight our guests and ultimately enable  
us to grow shareholder value.
We look forward to delivering further  
progress in the year ahead.

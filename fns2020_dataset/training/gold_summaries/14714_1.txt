INTRODUCTION
2007 saw the continuing 
successful implementation of 
the strategy that has returned 
the Group to sustainable growth 
and proﬁ tability. We have seen 
increases in revenue, net fee 
income and proﬁ tability driven by 
greater productivity, higher margin 
business and signiﬁ cantly greater 
efﬁ ciencies and automation in 
running our back ofﬁ ce.
In July we successfully completed 
the acquisition of Glotel plc. 
This accelerated our strategy 
and has signiﬁ cantly enhanced 
our geographic spread, with 
businesses in Europe, eleven 
locations in North America 
and two in Australia. During 
the second half of 2007 we 
completed the integration of the 
businesses with the integration 
of the UK back ofﬁ ce functions 
completed ahead of schedule in 
early October. 
Since the acquisition of Glotel 
all parts of the acquired 
business have made a positive 
contribution to our results in the 
year and we anticipate further 
progress in 2008 together with 
a full year’s beneﬁ t from the 
integration synergies arising 
from the combination of the two 
businesses.
STRATEGIC UPDATE
In-line with our strategy the 
Group is now split into 3 clear 
business divisions; Managed 
Solutions, Professional Stafﬁ ng 
and General Stafﬁ ng, which also 
incorporates our engineering 
stafﬁ ng business. These business 
units now all have strong 
leadership teams in place on a 
global basis. 
Our plans to increase our 
permanent business have 
proved relatively successful with 
net fee income growing by 
£2 million to £12.3 million (2006: 
£10.3 million) representing 
approximately 22% of the Group’s 
total net fee income. However, we 
are still predominantly a contract/
temporary-based organisation 
and this less volatile revenue 
stream puts us in good stead to 
withstand market turbulence 
throughout the economic cycle. 
Geographically our business has 
also expanded rapidly and this 
overseas expansion into new 
markets, though requiring initial 
investment in 2007, is now 
generating a positive return for 
the Group. Our new US and Asia 
Paciﬁ c businesses which, with 
mainland Europe, now account 
for over 20% of our net fee 
income on a run rate basis. We 
have 4 ofﬁ ces in mainland Europe, 
Germany, Belgium and two in 
Italy with further overseas ofﬁ ce 
openings planned in Singapore, 
Hong Kong and Delhi during 
2008. We will of course continue

to consider new ofﬁ ce openings 
in existing territories where 
appropriate to continue to drive 
growth and gain market share.
During the course of 2007 we 
also grew our sales capacity, 
increasing the revenue generating 
headcount by more than 250 
net staff. This was accomplished 
through the acquisition of Glotel 
and organically through our 
central recruiting and training 
functions. This central team will 
enable us to continue to invest 
in and expand our sales capacity 
further through 2008. 
OPERATING REVIEW
The results for 2007 show a 
strong improvement in each of 
the primary ﬁ nancial performance 
measures compared with 2006. 
The Group reversed the volume 
decline experienced in earlier 
years and recorded sequential 
quarter on quarter growth in 
revenue, net fee income and 
proﬁ t, throughout 2007. In the 
fourth quarter of 2007 revenues 
increased by 34% to £126.9 
million, net fee income increased 
by 45% to £17.1 million and 
proﬁ t before tax improved by 
49% to £2.7 million over the 
comparative fourth quarter of 
2006.
PROFESSIONAL STAFFING
This division comprises the IT 
Contracting and Permanent 
Recruitment Services businesses 
within the Group as well as the 
Glotel business acquired in the 
second half of 2007.
The division reported a small 
increase in revenue from £226.5 
million in 2006 to £227.4 million 
in 2007 with the corresponding 
operating proﬁ t improving from 
£5.6 million in 2006 to £6.0 
million in 2007. The revenue 
movement is the net effect of 
the Glotel acquisition, the switch 
to lower revenue, higher margin 
accounts and investment in new 
brands, offset by the reduction 
in volumes as a consequence of 
the Group’s decision to exit a 
small number of high volume but 
unproﬁ table accounts.
As with our other divisions, we 
have built a strong management 
team. A key focus has been the 
drive to increase sales headcount, 
with this division absorbing the 
majority of new sales hires as well 
as the business acquired from the 
Glotel acquisition. In 2007 we 
established new sales teams in 
both the contract and permanent 
recruitment divisions with each 
team specialising in a range 
of technical disciplines, which 
should facilitate a greater focus 
on improving further our gross 
margins. 
During the year we have seen a 
signiﬁ cant increase in percentage

margin and net fee income due 
to improvements in the quality of 
business being secured. As new 
sales staff recruited through 2007 
become fully productive, coupled 
with increases in productivity in 
our existing businesses we expect 
to see this trend continue in 2008.
MANAGED SOLUTIONS
Our Managed Solutions division 
which consists of our hy-phen, 
RPO and Spring IT Solutions 
businesses has proven to be 
robust through 2007. As a 
result of focusing on maximising 
revenues from those clients with 
whom we have some of our 
strongest relationships we grew 
revenues by 9.2% from £140.2 
million in 2006 to £153.1 million 
in 2007. As the quality and terms 
of this business has improved so 
has operating proﬁ t improving by 
22.2% from £2.7 million in 2006 
to £3.3 million in 2007.
Investment has been made 
throughout 2007 in new 
corporate sales staff and 
account Directors with the 
aim of improving service levels 
and winning new clients. Our 
resourcing capabilities have 
also become more effective and 
efﬁ cient with the creation of the 
central resourcing pool.
The long-term customer contracts, 
and the predominance of contract 
staff should result in robust 
performance from this division 
throughout the economic cycle 
and we anticipate that growth 
levels should continue.
 
GENERAL STAFFING
During 2007 we grew revenues 
in this business by 10.0% 
from £49.6 million in 2006 to 
£54.6 million in 2007 and turned 
a £0.1 million loss in 2006 into 
a £0.6 million proﬁ t in 2007, 
whilst making investments in new 
ofﬁ ces, people and brands.
This division has seen the opening 
of several new ofﬁ ces in 2007 to 
give greater market coverage in 
both the Spring Personnel and 
Elizabeth Hunt brands. Aligned 
to this has been a corresponding 
increase in headcount. Spring 
Direct has moved into the 
Engineering market with 
marked success and we will be 
investing further in this business 
throughout 2008.
I am conﬁ dent that as ofﬁ ces 
and staff become fully productive 
that we will see further increases 
in revenue, net fee income and 
proﬁ t from this business in 2008.

EFFICIENCY
During the year we established 
centralised corporate sales and

... with net fee income up by 22% and... 9
bid teams together with central 
resourcing units. These support 
the growth of our businesses and 
will allow us to maximise on sales 
opportunities and give customers 
both a high level of support as 
well as provide a central basis for 
efﬁ cient candidate supply.
In order to implement best 
practice and to get maximum 
economies of scale we have 
now completed the creation 
of our centralised Finance, 
Administration and IT functions. 
As well as the obvious symbiotic 
beneﬁ ts this offers we have the 
capacity to absorb further volume 
in these functions with minimal 
increase in our operating costs. 
We have also centralised our HR 
and Marketing functions, which 
allows us to quickly support 
new brands in a co-ordinated 
corporate manner and also to 
integrate any acquired companies 
efﬁ ciently.
Through the course of 2007 
we have used these efﬁ ciency 
savings in the support functions 
to help fund the investment in 
our front ofﬁ ce sales capacity. By 
a combination of both organic 
growth and acquisition we will 
exit 2007 with a net increase of 
in excess of 250 additional sales 
staff worldwide compared to 
December 2006.
OUTLOOK 2008
During 2007 we achieved a 
robust ﬁ nancial performance 
whilst putting in place both the 
strategy and management team 
required to deliver a sustainable 
improvement in performance.
With the Group increasingly 
diversiﬁ ed by both geography 
and market segment and a strong 
business in temporary/contract 
stafﬁ ng, we believe that Spring 
is well placed with its healthy 
balance sheet and solid trading 
to enjoy further growth both 
organically and by acquisition.
2008 has started as 2007 ﬁ nished 
with continuing improvement in 
key performance indicators for 
all of our businesses. With many 
of our new staff still to reach 
full productivity and with our 
ambitious growth plans, we are 
conﬁ dent that we can continue 
to deliver sustainable, proﬁ table 
growth.

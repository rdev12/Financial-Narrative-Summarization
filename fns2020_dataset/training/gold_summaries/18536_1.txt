 RESULTS
During the year, the Company adopted
International Financial Reporting
Standards ("IFRS") for the first time. 
The comparative figures for the year
ended 31 August 2005 have been
restated in accordance with IFRS. 
The comparative figures were included 
in our interim results for the six months
ended 28 February 2006, and details of
the adjustments on transition can be
found in note 2 of the consolidated
financial statements.
For the year ended 31 August 2006,
Group revenue from continuing
operations was 13% higher than last
year at £15.1 million (2005: £13.4
million). Profit before taxation from
continuing operations was £1.5 million,
a rise of 20% over last year (2005: £1.3
million). The loss before taxation from
discontinued operations was £0.6
million (2005: profit of £0.3 million).
Basic earnings per share from continuing
operations increased by 20% to 0.91p
(2005: 0.76p). Basic earnings per share
from continuing and discontinued
operations was 0.46p (2005: 0.93p). 
At 31 August 2006, the Group’s continuing
operations committed future gross profit
was £2.8 million (2005: £5.2 million).
£1.5 million will be recognised in the
financial year ending 31 August 2007.
This year on year decline is mainly due
to the disposal of six subsidiary
companies during and post the year end. 
At 31 August 2006, Group net funds
stood at £2.1 million (2005: £0.4
million), with cash of £1.0 million
generated from operations during the
year (2005: £2.2 million). There was an
inflow from acquisitions and disposals 
of subsidiary undertakings of £0.8
million (2005: an outflow of £3.2
million) and a net inflow from the issue
of new share capital and purchases of
own shares of £0.7 million (2005: £nil). 
The Directors are recommending a final
dividend payment for the financial year
of 0.105p per share (2005: 0.095p) 
an increase of approximately 11% per
share. Subject to shareholder approval 
at the Annual General Meeting on 
19 December 2006, this will be paid on
22 December 2006 to shareholders on
the register at the close of business on
24 November 2006.

SPORTS MARKETING
The division delivered a strong
performance, in line with our
expectations at the start of the year.
Revenue for the year increased to 
£8.3 million (2005: £6.7 million) and
the segmental operating profit for the
division was £1.26 million 
(2005: £1.21 million).
On 31 October 2006, the Group disposed
of this division for a consideration of 
up to £11.273 million. In the Board’s
opinion, the offer from Sportfive Gmbh
& Co KG represented the opportunity to
crystallise the underlying value of this
division. On completion, the Group
received initial consideration of £10.223
million. A further £1.050 million is
dependent on the financial performance
of the division in the year to 31 August
2007 and the retention of key
employees. Based on the receipt of the
initial consideration, the net gain on
disposal is approximately £4.5 million.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN BESPOKE

8 Formation Group PLC • 2006 Annual Report and Accounts Through Kingsbridge Asset Management,
this division offers financial planning,
insurance protection and management
advice to individual athletes,
entertainers and other high net worth
individuals. Revenue for the year was
£3.6 million (2005: £3.3 million) and
the segmental operating profit was
£543,000 (2005: £526,000). 
Serving predominantly professional
football players and coaches based in
the UK, we provide advice to these
clients in all areas of wealth
management, including tax planning,
investments and insurance protection.
Given the specialised nature of the
division’s client base, our products are
often bespoke and tailored to meet
clients’ needs, unlike a more traditional
independent financial advisor. Future
opportunities consist of increasing our
market share in our chosen segments
and adding complementary businesses. 
This division also provides financial
brokerage services to sporting
associations and clubs via Capital Sports
Solutions. The Board is pleased with the
progress we are making in this area and
is investigating the possibility of using
the Group’s capital to create a bespoke
sporting fund. 
WEALTH MANAGEMENT
& PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
9 Formation Group PLC • 2006 Annual Report and Accounts Following the disposal of Proactive
Scandinavia, our Scandinavian football
agency business based in Denmark, on
10 July 2006, this division consists of
two operating companies. Excluding
Proactive Scandinavia, revenue of the
continuing operations was £3.1 million
(2005: £3.4 million) and segmental
operating profit was £995,000 
(2005: £1,061,000). The Representation
division currently acts for 107 
(2005: 200) players throughout the
world, of whom 81 (2005: 118) have
represented their country at international
level. The division completed 60 
(2005: 102) transfers or contract
renewals in the year, a 41 per cent
decrease year on year.
We remain committed to this division
and are confident about its medium term
prospects after a significant period of
instability and uncertainty. The Premier
League enquiry undertaken by Lord
Stevens has not yet been completed.
However, we welcome this initiative and
will comply with all recommendations
which are implemented. We believe any
increased compliance and regulation will
be of benefit to the division and the
industry going forward. 
As at 31 August 2006, the division 
had committed future gross profit of
£2.8 million (2005: £3.2 million
excluding Proactive Scandinavia) of
which £1.5 million will be recognised in
the year ending 31 August 2007.

12 Formation Group PLC • 2006 Annual Report and Accounts
The Group’s key challenges are focused
on four areas: our ability to recruit new
clients in all divisions; our ability to
retain and motivate senior sales
personnel and management; the
continued desire for live English football
matches, both domestically and
internationally, which underpin the
financial health of football clubs and,
therefore, players’ salaries; and finally,
the sustainability of the UK and
European residential and commercial
property sectors.
RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES The business has been significantly
transformed over recent months and
prospects for our retained operations
look positive. The view is reinforced by
the level of contracted income within
the Group and our strong cash position.
The proceeds from the disposal of
subsidiaries provide the Group with a
solid platform from which to grow and
our focus will be to generate progressive
earnings growth for our shareholders.
This will be done though a mix of
continuing organic growth and selective
acquisition. We view the next phase of
the Group’s development with much
optimism.

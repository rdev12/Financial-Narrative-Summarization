Chairman’s Statement 
 
I am delighted to present the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2011.  The Group performance 
has again been driven by the IVA division which doubled the number of new IVAs arranged during the year. 
 
The Group increased revenue to £7,776,362 (2010: £6,633,995) producing a much increased gross profit of 
£3,963,959 (2010: £3,300,688).  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation increased to £2,222,411 
(2010: £1,515,271) resulting in a pre-tax profit for the year of £227,219 (2010: £465,709).  This was after finance 
charges of £532,404 (2010: £206,660) relating to the convertible secured loan note issued in 2010 and other loans 
together with amortisation relating to the acquisition of back books and other intangibles of £1,388,809 (2010: 
£993,980).   
 
During the year the Group acquired two further back books of Debt Management Plans (DMPs) and completed the 
purchase of a sizeable IVA book from Invocas Group plc (Invocas) just prior to the year end.  The acquisitions 
resulted in a gain on bargain purchase of £54,985 which was offset by the write off of £55,612 of goodwill relating 
to the Debt Advice Portal acquisition in January 2009.  A tax charge of £156,183 for the year includes a £75,000 
provision against holding company tax losses previously recognised as a deferred tax asset which, although they 
may ultimately be recoverable, will take a number of years to be fully utilised. 
  
In June 2011, just prior to the year end,  a decision was made in favour of  Paymex Limited against HM  Revenue & 
Customs (HMRC) which ruled that fees for services in relation to IVAs should be treated as exempt from VAT. 
HMRC confirmed in July that they would not appeal the outcome of the case.  Accordingly, as a result of the ruling, 
we have put a protective claim into HMRC to recover net output tax of some £850,000 incorrectly paid to HMRC 
over the last 4 years. A proportion of this VAT may be due to us and a proportion due to creditors. The timing, 
quantum and split of any refunds received will very much be dependent on the stance that HMRC adopt in relation 
to such reclaims by us and many other companies in the sector. No entries have been made in the accounts due to the 
uncertainty on the timing and recoverability of any claim. We expect the loss of input tax recovery on our costs 
going forward to be broadly neutral. 
 
At the year end the group had net assets of £5,150,582 (2010: £5,016,621) including cash of £336,636 (2010: 
£541,504) after spending some £1.1m on acquisitions (2010: £2.7m) in the year financed out of cash flow and net 
new loans of £315,000. 
 
The Group finances continue on a sound footing and I am pleased to report continued growth in the number of new 
IVAs being passed since the year end with a record number of cases passed in August 2011.  Client retention of debt 
management clients remains excellent which is a testament to the service our teams provide to creditors and clients 
alike.  Growth in new debt management clients remains limited going forward, given an increasing acceptance by 
debtors and creditors alike that the IVA product is generally more appropriate to debtor’s circumstances than a 
DMP. 
 
I look forward to another profitable year as we continue to nurture and expand our referral base whilst maintaining 
our web marketing presence and we continue to look for opportunities to acquire back books of clients wherever 
possible at sensible prices.

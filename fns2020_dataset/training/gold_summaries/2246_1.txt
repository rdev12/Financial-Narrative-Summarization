Overview
t
he Group delivered an excellent performance 
for the year with growth in both revenue 
and profits. Continuing profit before tax and 
highlighted items for the year of £12.5 million 
was up 3% on the year ended 29 February 2012 of £12.1 
million. Continuing profit before tax was £9.8 million, up 
16% on the year ended 29 February 2012 of £8.5 million. 
Continuing revenue was up 1% to £98.5 million (2011/12: 
£97.4 million). 
Bloomsbury has succeeded in developing itself into a 
wholly integrated trade and academic publisher in the 
major markets around the world. We are now recognised 
as one of the finest publishers of both general and 
academic books. This is an early delivery of our strategic 
vision for One Global Bloomsbury, integrating our 
operations in trade and academic publishing in Britain, 
America, Australia and India. In May, we were voted 
Academic, Educational and Professional Publisher of 
the Year at the Bookseller Industry Awards. In March, 
the Independent Publishers Guild voted Bloomsbury’s 
Academic & Professional division Independent Publisher of 
the Year. Both are notable achievements less than five years 
after we launched our academic division. We beat even the 
university presses, established hundreds of years ago, to 
these awards this year. The power of the Bloomsbury brand 
resonates and crosses over from our trade bestsellers to 
attract academic authors as the whole brand becomes 
stronger than the sum of its parts due to successful brand 
initiatives like our public engagement programme The 
Bloomsbury Institute. The judges singled out the power of 
our brand.
During the year, our trade authors have also been singled 
out for exceptional recognition, with extra sales being 
driven as a result of short-listings for major prizes including 
the Man Booker Prize and winning the Orange Prize. In 2012 
we made the title acquisitions which will underpin what 
should be a very strong 2013/14 in the Adult division as we 
publish a wide range of bestsellers from Paul Hollywood’s 
Bread (which reached number 1 in The Times Bestseller List) 
to Khaled Hosseini’s stunning And The Mountains Echoed 
which was published in May following his bestseller The Kite 
Runner, to Elizabeth Gilbert’s masterpiece The Signature of 
All Things and Samantha Shannon’s remarkable first novel 
The Bone Season, both published in October. Our Adult 
division’s strength in cookery publishing, which saw us win 
Waterstone’s Book of The Year in December with Polpo, 
will increase in 2013 with the first publication in the new 
partnership with MasterChef.

chief executive’s revie W
We are doing this from a tightly controlled cost base with 
an intense drive for savings. During the year our print 
purchasing was put out to tender: buying as a Group for 
the first time since our numerous acquisitions, we have 
reduced our print expense having secured favourable 
volume-based deals from fewer suppliers. We have been 
cutting other costs in the business, with underlying 
administration costs being down by 1% year on year. 
This includes a tight control of Head Office expenditure – 
where our rent is only £28 per square foot. A further cost 
reduction plan has been implemented for 2013.
We are industry leaders in our digital strategy with a wide 
range of digital initiatives producing good returns. Our 
knowledge hub programme has made huge progress. 
We successfully launched the Churchill Archive in October 
2012 and Drama Online in February 2013 both to praise 
and good early sales. The Churchill Archive was described 
by the judges of the Independent Publishers Guild’s digital 
publishing award as ‘a dynamite digital product’ to which 
Bloomsbury ‘has added stacks of value to the material’. 
The Churchill Centre has acquired access to the Churchill 
Archive from Bloomsbury for every secondary school in the 
USA, UK and Canada in a ground breaking initiative.
We made two academic acquisitions in the year, Fairchild 
Books and Applied Visual Arts Publishing. In the year ended 
28 February 2013 our non-trade divisions accounted for 
61% of the Group’s operating profit before highlighted 
items and 33% of the revenue. We now have 20 publishing 
specialisations in our stable and are market leaders in 
subjects from the Classics and Drama to Fashion Studies, 
Theology and Continental Philosophy. The Independent 
Publishers Guild judges said, when giving Bloomsbury its 
award: “Judges singled out the division for the breadth 
of its academic and professional publishing and its clear 
vision for what it wishes to achieve. Even allowing for the 
resources at its disposal, they recognized a Group with a 
true entrepreneurial and independent spirit…It has used 
its money wisely and made everything work exceptionally 
well.” The Booksellers Award judges said “Success has been 
due to organic growth and innovative business models – 
and it has completely redefined Bloomsbury as  
a publisher”.
These acquisitions join the 18 other acquisitions made in 
recent years by Bloomsbury. They have enabled the Group 
to change the shape of its business, to exploit the potential 
in portfolios which adapt readily to the emerging digital-
based business model and balance the transformation of 
its traditional trade business with the annuity income more 
possible in its new business structure. 
The Churchill Archive online has almost one million pages accessible 
on demand to libraries worldwide. All secondary schools in the UK, USA 
and Canada will be granted access to the entire archive.
Drama Online is a subscription service providing a resource for plays, 
critical analysis and performance featuring pre-eminent drama lists.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Excluding acquisitions and the Harry Potter series (which 
had a strong previous year following the release of the 
final film in August 2011) title sales in the underlying 
business were up year on year. This performance was, 
importantly, achieved without dependence on any 
single runaway bestseller. This is a sign of strength in the 
Group as our portfolio broadens. Total title sales included 
digitally-distributed sales of £10.0 million, which saw 
excellent growth year on year of 71% from £5.9 million in 
2011/12. Within this e-book sales continue to grow strongly, 
increasing by 61% to £9.1 million and now representing 
9% of total Group revenue (2011/12: 6%) and 13% of the 
Adult revenue (2011/12: 9%). Increasing the number of 
available e-book titles is a key part of our strategy and we 
now have 9,000 titles, 1,000 more than a year ago.
Richard Mollet, Chief Executive of The Publishers 
Association, said: “The Publishers Association’s Statistics 
Yearbook 2012 shows that British publishing is a healthy 
industry which continues to grow. The continued increase 
in digital sales across different disciplines illustrates the 
shift of readers to e-book reading. Such growth has been 
achieved as British publishers have been able to invest in 
new exciting, innovative products and in great authors 
thanks to the strong framework provided by copyright 
law, which continues to be the cornerstone of stability for a 
creative industry like publishing”.
Bloomsbury’s core attributes of entrepreneurship, 
innovation, publicity flair and tight control of costs have led 
to the delivery of One Global Bloomsbury, and the future 
performance we have now set the stage for as we enjoy 
the synergies and sales advantages of having delivered 
a unified worldwide publishing group. In our strategy 
for growth we are targeting 50% of profit to be digital 
within five years, with Bloomsbury being the number one 
applied visual arts and independent humanities and social 
science publisher in Europe. Over that time we aim to be 
the number one publisher of choice in cookery, sport and 
natural history, with an Information division which has a 
global base delivering increasing revenues from digital 
knowledge hubs.
financial results
Group financial results are summarised in the table below.
Continuing revenue has increased by 1% to £98.5 million. 
The majority of our revenue derives from title sales, which 
were up by 3% year on year to £87.0 million. The mix 
within title sales is increasingly moving towards digital 
and away from print. Print sales fell by £1.9 million, 2%, to 
£77.0 million, but digital sales rose by £4.2 million, 71%, to 
£10.0 million, leading to a total title sales increase of £2.2 
million. Rights and services revenue, which is primarily 
from copyright licensing, had another good performance 
with revenues of £11.5 million, £1.1 million down on the 
exceptional result in 2011/12 but significantly ahead of 
2010/11. 
Underlying revenue, which excludes the result of the 
two businesses we acquired during the year, Fairchild 
Books and Applied Visual Arts Publishing, was down by 
£4.9million, 5% to £92.5 million, principally due to lower 
sales of Harry Potter titles in the absence of a new film. This 
was more than mitigated by the £6.0 million contribution 
to revenue from our new acquisitions in the year. 
The continuing operating profit margin before highlighted 
items increased to 12.6%. In 2012/13 production, marketing 
and distribution costs were all a smaller percentage of sales 
than in 2011/12. 
The launch of our Indian publishing business in New Delhi 
in August was a success. Its performance was better than 
anticipated, with a loss of £0.2 million, as a result of sales 
exceeding expectations including our first number one 
bestseller in India and rigorous cost control.
The academic acquisitions, the set-up of our business 
in India and other strategic initiatives have resulted in 
£0.3 million of costs which, together with intangible 
amortisation, are highlighted separately in the financial 
statements.

Continuing diluted earnings per share, excluding 
highlighted items, were 13.11 pence, down from 13.27 
pence in 2011/12 largely as a result of the tax credit from 
overseas losses in that year. Total continuing diluted 
earnings per share for the year were 10.46 pence, up from 
9.54 pence in 2011/12.
The Group’s net cash balance increased to £14.6 million at 
28 February 2013 from £12.6 million at 29 February 2012. 
This movement includes £1.7 million outflow for acquisition 
investment and the receipt of £2.2 million for the disposal 
of Bloomsbury Verlag.
Divisional review
Academic & Professional – fulfilling promise
Bloomsbury took a strategic decision in 2008 to build an 
academic and professional business that was not reliant 
on the UK retail sector. The commercial aim of the new 
division is to build a sustainable business that matches the 
combined revenue of our Trade divisions. 
The division has built up a significant holding in humanities 
and social sciences publishing, with a vibrant and 
growing tax and law business. Its acquisitions include 
Methuen Drama, Berg Publishers, Tottel Publishing, 
Arden Shakespeare, Bristol Classical Press, Continuum 
International, Fairchild Books and Applied Visual Arts 
Publishing. 
The combination of excellent title sales in the key UK and 
US markets, two further acquisitions and some longer-term 
licensing deals have meant that 2012/13 was a good year 
for the division, despite very strong 2011/12 comparatives.
 
The Academic & Professional division generated 29% of 
Group continuing revenue this year (2011/12: 24%) and 
42% of the Group continuing operating profit before 
highlighted items (2011/12: 34%). Export revenues now 
account for half of divisional revenue, with a significant 
and growing proportion of revenues from e-books and 
digital, annuity-based services. The division’s results are 
summarised below:
chief executive’s revie W
Bloomsbury Academic publishing has 20 publishing specialisations 
and are market leaders in Classics and Drama to Fashion Studies, 
Theology and Continental Philosophy.
Bloomsbury Professional has a growing range of attractively priced 
online subscription services for tax, law and financial reporting.  These 
complement the division’s e-book and print titles for the professions.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On Bloomsbury continued its strategy of acquiring high 
quality assets in areas complementary to its existing 
academic and professional lists, with the purchase of two 
applied visual arts lists: Fairchild Books in March 2012 for 
£3.8 million and Applied Visual Arts Publishing in June 
2012 for £1.8 million. Combined with Bloomsbury’s existing 
visual arts lists and academic list Berg, this makes us the 
leading global publisher in this field. These acquisitions 
contributed £6.0 million of revenue and £2.0 million of 
incremental operating profit before highlighted items in 
the year ended 28 February 2013. 
Excluding these acquisitions, there was excellent 
underlying growth in title sales which increased by 9%, 
£1.8 million, to £20.8 million. Rights and services revenue 
reduced by £1.8 million to £2.3 million following a very 
strong year in 2011/12, causing the £0.9 million reduction 
in underlying operating profit before highlighted items. 
New title output now exceeds 1,000 titles per year, with an 
increasing focus on digital publishing. We expect digital 
revenues to increase as we rapidly expand our portfolio of 
subscription services.
In October 2012, Bloomsbury published the Churchill 
Archive online in conjunction with the Sir Winston Churchill 
Archive Trust. The work comprises almost one million 
pages, in digital format for university libraries, public 
libraries and schools to access on demand. The content of 
the archive has been made available to a global audience 
who will be able to study one of the largest and most 
important collections of primary source material of any 
individual leader in history. All secondary schools in the UK, 
USA and Canada will be granted access to the entire 
digital Churchill Archive thanks to funding from the 
Churchill Centre.
In February 2013, Bloomsbury launched Drama Online, an 
online resource for plays, critical analysis and performance. 
Featuring the pre-eminent drama lists from Methuen 
Drama, Arden Shakespeare and Faber and Faber, Drama 
Online will offer a complete digital library of the most 
studied, performed and critically acclaimed plays from the 
last 2,500 years. 
Bloomsbury Professional now has a number of online 
services including: UK Tax Online, Irish Company Law 
Online, Irish Property Law Online, Irish Tax Online and 
Financial Reporting Online. The Financial Reporting service 
is now used by a majority of the large accounting firms in 
the UK as the service of choice. Our pricing model is very 
attractive to users and the packages are well focused on 
customer needs. In October 2012, Bloomsbury Professional 
launched Tax Planner Interactive, which delivers online 
solutions rather than pure content to the end user. 
Fairchild Books was acquired in March 2012
AVA Publishing was aquired in June 2012

Adult – Digital sales flourish 
The Adult division generated 45% of Group continuing 
revenue this year (2011/12: 46%). Continuing revenue was 
£44.3 million (2011/12: £45.1million). Continuing operating 
profit before highlighted items was £3.7 million, (2011/12 
£4.8million). Continuing operating profit margin before 
highlighted items for the division was 8% which compares 
very favourably with an industry average of 5.8%.
Print sales decreased by 7% to £34.3 million, but digital 
sales in the division rose 32% year on year to £5.6 million, 
representing 13% of continuing sales (2011/12: 9%).
The highest penetration of e-book sales remains in the 
USA at 27% of net title sales, but UK e-book sales are 
accelerating and now at 11% of net title sales. Other 
territories are also growing rapidly. Rights & Services 
revenue rose by 16% to £4.4 million (2011/12: £3.8 million).
In line with our strategy we focused our efforts on 
acquiring and publishing titles with global English-
language rights. In particular we have invested in the 
area of high-quality cookery books with the potential for 
global sales. Our two most successful new authors in the 
year were Paul Hollywood with two titles, How to Bake and 
Bread, and Russell Norman with his Waterstone’s Book of 
the Year, Polpo. We also saw significant and growing sales 
from our established author chefs such as Hugh Fearnley-
Whittingstall, Heston Blumenthal, Atol Kochhar, Fergus 
Henderson, Raymond Blanc, Nikki Segnit, David Chang, 
Vivek Singh, Philip Howard and many more.
Literary prizes are becoming an ever more important 
way for book buyers to identify what they want to read. 
Madeline Miller won the Orange Prize for Fiction with The 
Song of Achilles, a brilliant re-telling of Homer’s Iliad. The 
International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award is one of the 
richest literary prizes in the world and was won for the 
second year running by a Bloomsbury author, this time Jon 
McGregor with Even the Dogs. Paula Wilfert won the James 
Beard Award with The Food of Morocco, Alistair Hignell with 
Higgy was Rugby Book of the Year, and we were delighted 
that Cuckoos of the World was voted Bird Book of the Year 
by Birdwatch magazine.

Overview Business Review GOvernance Financial STa Temen TS cO mpany in FOrma Ti On We have also focused on publishing in print and digital 
for special interest markets. Jonathan Kingdon’s six-
volume Mammals of Africa is unique, comprehensive 
and authoritative. This was published alongside our 
established natural history list which continues its central 
role in ornithology, not least with the publication of Ralph 
Steadman’s Extinct Boids.
Progressively we view the English-speaking market (and 
many non-native English territories) as a single market, 
particularly with internet and digital distribution channels. 
In this respect our two recent start-up businesses in 
Australia and India are vital to our functions of promoting 
our authors and developing sales and markets. India’s 
first year has been good with bestsellers ranging from 
Manil Suri’s The City of Devi, through William Dalrymple’s 
The Return of a King to the first edition of the Wisden India 
Almanack edited by Suresh Menon.
Digital sales will continue to increase across the board 
with significant opportunities: geographical (India, Latin 
America, China), technological (colour, audio, interactivity 
etc) and reach (new e-tailers, social media, subscription, 
lending etc). The rate of growth in traditional e-book sales 
in the USA is slowing but elsewhere there appears to be 
very significant opportunities for growth.
Children’s & Educational – An innovative team  
builds for the future 
Bloomsbury Children’s & Educational division publishes 
quality books for children up to 16 years old to inspire a 
love of reading. 
Revenue was £21.3 million (2011/12: £25.6 million). This 
reduction is largely due to a 22%, £5.1 million reduction 
year on year in print sales, which in turn is almost wholly 
due to lower sales of Harry Potter titles, with the release of 
the final film in that series in 2011 making the comparative 
for 2011/12 very strong. E-book sales grew to 10% of 
net title sales, up from 5% in 2011/12, with the strongest 
performance in the US market, but steeper growth in the 
UK. Closely managed costs and advance focus led to an 
improved gross profit margin of 53% compared to 49% in 
2011/12. 
The Educational division benefited from a community led 
marketing team focusing on direct selling and inherited 
titles from the Continuum acquisition, growing sales to 
£4.8m, up from £4.2m last year.

The children’s trade division continues to acquire 
world rights to strengthen global publishing. With new 
publishing directors in both the UK and the US, the 
publishing strategy is to acquire market facing titles and to 
publish fewer books better, driving up profitability per title.
Digital innovation is a priority with interactive colour 
e-books and app marketing in development, along with 
an e-first imprint for the young adult market – Bloomsbury 
Spark. The Educational sub-division is developing its first 
online digital product – Music Express Online, which will 
launch in 2014.
Highlights from the 2012/13 year include Hogwart’s 
Library by JK Rowling and Princess Academy: Palace of 
Stone by Shannon Hale, which entered the New York Times 
bestseller list. Throne of Glass by Sarah J Maas has sold in 12 
languages and Steve Jobs by Karen Blumenthal sold almost 
100,000 copies in the year. We also launched both the 
Bloomsbury Activity Books imprint and a new picture book 
list at Frankfurt Book Fair. Nicholas Lake won the prestigious 
Printz Award from the American Library Association for 
In Darkness and is also shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal 
along with The Weight of Water, a debut novel by Sarah 
Crossan. 
Bloomsbury Information – Knowledge hubs
The core activities of Bloomsbury Information are the 
development of IP-rich knowledge hubs in cooperation 
with external partners, the provision of management and 
publishing services and publishing business, management, 
finance and reference titles. 
The division generated 4% of Group continuing revenue 
this year (2011/12: 4%) and 19% of Group continuing 
operating profit before highlighted items (2011/12: 
7%). Continuing revenue was £3.8 million, up 5% on 
£3.6 million for 2011/12. Continuing operating profit 
before highlighted items was £2.3 million, up £1.5 million 
compared to £0.9 million in 2011/12. Rights and services 
revenue of £3.4 million made up 90% of total continuing 
revenue.
Successes in the year include the continuing growth of 
www.QFinance.com, the digital knowledge hub for finance 
professionals created by Bloomsbury which now attracts 
over 300,000 unique visitors per month. Development 
of the IZA World of Labor, our knowledge hub targeted 
at policy makers in the field of labour economics which 
covers topics such as migration and minimum wage, is 
progressing well with launch scheduled for later this year. 
The division continues to grow and is well placed to 
exploit digital, management services and other innovative 
business opportunities for the Group.

Bloomsbury is a global fully integrated publisher of books 
and other media for general readers, children, students, 
researchers and professionals throughout the world. 
Bloomsbury uniquely offers authors access to these 
multiple markets in multiple formats throughout the world: 
in print, through e-books, through digital downloads and 
apps; in schools, in libraries, in universities, and in terrestrial 
and Internet bookshops, with entrepreneurial teams 
in New York, London, New Delhi and Sydney serving all 
territories. 
The bringing together of general and scholarly publishing 
has already resulted in significant cost savings, better 
marketing reach, a balanced portfolio both editorially and 
financially, and excellent results. Bloomsbury’s strategy 
over the next five years is to balance trade and non-trade 
publishing in the business to further enhance these 
benefits. 
The Academic & Professional division aim is to be the 
number one applied visual arts publisher in the world, 
and within five years to be the number one independent 
humanities and social science publisher in Europe, with half 
of turnover coming from digital and subscription-based 
products.
The Adult division aims to be the number one publisher of 
choice in cookery, sport and natural history and in the top 
ten for quality fiction worldwide within five years. 
Our overall strategy for Bloomsbury Children’s & 
Educational books is to be recognised for great author 
care, independent spirit and innovation. Over the next five 
years we will develop Bloomsbury Activity books to be a 
leading profit generating list for the division, with half of 
the trade frontlist being illustrated books and 25% of all 
publishing being in a digital format. 
The Bloomsbury Information division strategy is to increase 
revenues from digital knowledge hubs and broaden the 
base for services and partnerships. Over the next few years 
we intend to expand from the division’s UK base and 
develop a global reach for Bloomsbury Information. 
Outlook
Bloomsbury has an exceptional publishing programme for 
2013/14. This includes And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled 
Hosseini, The Signature of All Things by Elizabeth Gilbert, The 
Bone Season by Samantha Shannon and the first book from 
our new MasterChef venture with Shine TV.
There are exciting opportunities for growth in many areas, 
including; digital sales (e-books, knowledge hubs and 
academic and professional online services), publishing 
services sales and global title sales - particularly in India, 
Latin America and China. We also have many internal 
operational improvements ongoing across the Group 
which will improve business efficiency, including a Group 
wide shift to content-led (XML-based) workflows to expedite 
the print and digital production process.
The publishing industry is going through changing times 
full of opportunity. With online and digital technology 
the book market is increasingly global, facilitating trade 
across Bloomsbury’s international business. Global 
English language speakers and literacy generally are ever 
increasing. Our content has become more widely available 
through the increasing number of e-reading devices and 
the ease of acquiring e-books means that each consumer 
buys more titles than before. Fewer books are being sold 
through high street shops as e-book sales are continuing to 
grow. However, there will be a place for the physical book 
for many more years albeit mainly sold online. 
Bloomsbury has been successfully steering a path through 
this shifting business model. The opportunities for selling 
our content and the different formats for our content are 
proliferating. Whereas content was historically only sold 
as an individual physical title, now we can sell content 
24/7 as an e-book, bundle online rights for sale or create 
innovative knowledge hubs where access rights can be 
sold direct to the consumer. It is this innovation, together 
with our valuable intellectual property and respected 
Bloomsbury brand that form the core of Bloomsbury’s 
strategy for growth.

 The year to 31 December 2012 has been very active.
Alongside continuing lettings we have made some significant
acquisitions, continued our construction programme in
Moscow, prolonged near term debt maturities and raised
further preference share capital.
The same market dynamics we saw in 2011 continued through
2012 and into 2013. The key factors for us have been strong
tenant demand and limited new supply.
The portfolio is virtually fully let and rents have reached
$135 per sqm in Moscow. New leases are being signed for
5 to 10 year terms with high quality tenants.
Our completed investment portfolio comprises 1.3 million sqm
of completed Grade A warehousing. It currently produces NOI
of $170.1 million per annum from a group of high quality
tenants. PLAs and LOIs increase that to $175.5 million and it
will reach $179.5 million when fully let. At the year end, these
properties had a gross value of $1,502 million, equating to a
fully let yield of 11.9 % and a capital value of $1,155 per sqm.
We are well advanced on the construction of new phases of
48,000 sqm at Klimovsk and 36,000 sqm at Noginsk and
expect completion at the end of the second quarter 2013.
These already have signed PLAs and LOIs for $4.1 million and
will add $10.9 million in total when fully let, increasing the
potential annualised NOI from the portfolio to $190.4 million.
During the year, we acquired assets at Pushkino and
Sholokhovo in Moscow. Grade A warehouses, fully let to strong
tenants with current initial yields of 11.8% and 12.1%
respectively. After deducting the cost of bank interest and
preference dividends which financed the acquisitions, they
contribute $11 million to profits on an annualised basis. They
contributed $15.1 million to NOI in the second half of 2012.

We also acquired 38 hectares of land at Padikova on the Nova
Riga highway to the north west of Moscow. Over time, we can
build 197,000 sqm there. 
In addition to the projects and land above, we have sufficient
permitted Moscow land to add at least another 150,000 sqm
to the portfolio in due course.
A potential annualised rent roll of $190.4 million will give a
strong income base for a growing distribution per share. This
remains our main financial objective. If we can demonstrate a
clear record of growing distributions going forward, that will go
a long way to demonstrating the real value of our assets.
A big question for us is how much to accelerate development
beyond our existing organic plan of 50,000 to 100,000 sqm
per annum. The direct property market would suggest
aggressive expansion but we don't want to jeopardize our now
solid investment income foundation and we want to grow
distributions per share. The main constraint is funding.
I will also take this opportunity to reiterate our policy on tender
offer buy backs, repeating what I said at the half year. We are
committed to tender offer buy-backs whilst this can be
achieved at discounts to NAV. In the medium to long-term this
will add value to shareholders. A shareholder tendering shares
will receive cash equivalent to the quantum of a dividend and,
assuming the tender offer is fully taken up, will retain the same
percentage shareholding. Even though the number of shares
held reduces, the percentage holding of the shareholder
remains the same and NAV per share will rise as shares are
cancelled at a discount to NAV.
The perception of Russia is that it is high risk and volatile. It is
our job to demonstrate it is not. We hope to do this by
producing steadily increasing distributions to shareholders.

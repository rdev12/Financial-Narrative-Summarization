 06 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Chairman’ s Statement
Jonathan Silver
USD 1 ,098m
New contract awards
2011 was a landmark year for Lamprell 
in a number of ways. The Group 
reported revenues of USD 1,148m, the 
largest annual revenue in the Group’s 
history, an increase of 128% on 2010 
and adjusted net profit of USD 73.8m, 
10.9% higher than the prior year; the 
Group secured contract awards 
totalling USD 1,098m, the second 
highest in the Group’s history; and the 
Group’s year-end order book, amounting 
to USD 1,215m, is a record. The Group 
continues to be committed to high 
quality and timely project execution.
The Group completed its first significant 
acquisition with the NOK 1,869m (USD 
338m) purchase of Maritime Industrial 
Services Co. Ltd. Inc. (“MIS”), a 
diversified engineering and contracting 
group focused on the energy sector with 
its principal operations based in Sharjah 
in the UAE. Despite the complexities of 
the transaction, the acquisition was 
completed (post the initial negotiations) 
in only 67 days. In the process, the 
Company launched its first ever rights 
issue, which achieved a 99.8% acceptance 
from shareholders and raised equity, 
debt and guarantee facilities totalling,  
in aggregate, USD 530m.
The acquisition of MIS has added 
complementary service businesses 
to the Group’s existing offering, a 
presence in a number of countries in 
the region including, most significantly, 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, it has 
enhanced the Group’s in-house 
engineering capabilities and provided 
375,000m
2
 of additional yard and 
fabrication space. The combined 
Group now employs in excess of 
14,000 people, including labour supply 
personnel, working in multiple locations 
across eight countries. The process of 
integrating MIS and its subsidiaries 
into the Group has progressed more 
quickly than was anticipated and is 
expected to be completed prior to the 
first anniversary of the acquisition. 
Management is confident that the 
annual synergies that will be brought 
about following the acquisition will  
meet the target of USD 11m.
The Company formally opened its 
expanded Hamriyah facility at a 
ceremony marking the official launch  
of the Group’s main facility following 
over three years of construction and  
an investment of over USD 75m. The 
Company was extremely honoured to 
have His Highness Sheikh Sultan  
bin Mohammed Al Qassimi, Supreme 
Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, 
open the facility. With a surface area  
of 365,000m² and a quayside of over 
1.4km, the Hamriyah yard is one  
of the region’s foremost facilities for  
the manufacture of oil & gas assets, 
with capacity to accommodate more 
than 10 jackup rigs at the quayside 
simultaneously and multiple new build 
rigs in various stages of construction 
within the yard. The Hamriyah facility 
201 1 was a landmark year for Lamprell. 07 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011

Value of our order book at year end  
demonstrates the Group’s determination 
to build its business further and is 
already playing a key part in broadening 
the Group’s offering to its widening 
customer base.
The Group’s record year-end order 
book and strong bid pipeline reflect 
the high level of interest there is in 
Lamprell’s services, a point reinforced 
during 2011 by the multiple major 
contract awards with leading 
international clients including contracts 
to construct five new build jackups, 
a wellhead and production utility 
quarters platform for Nexen and two 
new build land rigs. The Nexen contract 
is a significant step for the Group in 
terms of developing the North Sea 
market and its increased scale.
That these achievements came against 
a backdrop of continuing economic 
volatility was particularly pleasing, 
demonstrating the strength of the 
Group’s offering even in more difficult 
times. We are, however, very watchful 
of any impact that continuing economic 
concerns may have on our principal 
markets and will continue to work hard 
to maintain both the quality of our work 
and the flexibility of our business model 
to seek to ensure that Lamprell can 
respond rapidly to any changes in the 
health of the industry supply chain.
In January of last year, Christopher 
Hand joined the Board as Chief 
Operating Officer and in October,  
we welcomed Jonathan Cooper as  
our Chief Financial Officer with his 
predecessor Scott Doak taking a new 
role within the Group. We are fortunate 
to add Jonathan’s undoubted skills in 
both the finance and oil sectors to 
our Board whilst retaining Scott’s 
knowledge of our business in an 
important new role. I am also delighted 
to welcome Deena Mattar to the Board 
as a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from the beginning of April 2012. Deena 
Mattar, who was formerly Group 
Finance Director of Kier Group plc and 
holds non-executive directorships at 
Invensys plc and RM plc, will assume 
the role of Chairman of the Audit 
Committee when Richard Raynaut 
retires in June of this year. We are 
extremely grateful to Richard for the 
significant contribution he has made to 
the Company during the last six years.
These are exciting times for the Group 
and I am pleased to announce that, 
having considered the current market 
conditions, profit earned and cash 
generated during the year ended 
31 December 2011, the Board is 
recommending a dividend of 8.00 
cents per share. If approved, this will be 
paid to shareholders on 22 June 2012 
provided they were on the register on 
25 May 2012.
I am confident that Lamprell’s 
reputation for quality, the safe execution 
of work, its technical capabilities, 
project execution and delivery, coupled 
with the dedication and expertise of 
Lamprell’s management and staff, will 
enable the Company to continue to 
deliver value for all its stakeholders.

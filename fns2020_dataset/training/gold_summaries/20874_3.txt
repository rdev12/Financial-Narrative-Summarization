 GROUP OVERVIEW 
Chairman’s 
statement
12 months ago I reported 
that 2015 had seen the 
beginnings of a turnaround 
in the fortunes of Anglo 
Pacific. It is therefore 
extremely gratifying to now 
report that that turnaround 
has become a full scale 
recovery with a further 
doubling in royalty income 
from £8.7m to £19.7m and 
more significant growth 
anticipated in 2017 . 
Key results
Royalty income, up from £8.7m  
in 2015 to £19.7m 
£19.7m
Basic and diluted earnings  
per share

Basic and diluted adjusted  
earnings per share

Upward revaluation of Kestrel

2017 should be a 
year of continued 
organic growth 
for Anglo Pacific

 4 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
“The Group’s success in
2005 is directly attributable
to the restructuring exercise
we started in 2004. Bradford
& Bingley’s strategy provides
the right direction for
continued success for a
differentiated and innovative
specialist mortgage lender.”
Bradford & Bingley has grown proﬁts and
continued the successful development of its
Lending and Retail businesses in 2005. This
performance is particularly pleasing given the
extent of the changes that the Group has
undergone in the last eighteen months.
Underlying proﬁt increased 1 1% to £31 0.1 million
and underlying earnings per share increased 9%
to 35.4 pence per share. Proﬁt before tax and
loss on sale of discontinued operations
increased by 1 4% to £263.5 million (2004:
£231.9 million).
Dividend
The Board is pleased to propose a ﬁnal dividend
of 1 2.3 pence per share for payment on 5 May
2006 to shareholders on the register as at 
24 March 2006. If approved, the full year
dividend for 2005 will be 1 8.3 pence per share
(2004: 1 7.1 pence), an increase of 7%. The
Board will continue to seek to balance dividend
payments with the capital requirements of the
Group’s growing Balance Sheet.
Lending
Our total lending balances increased 7% to
£31.1 billion (2004: £29.0 billion) and total new
lending was £8.8 billion (2004: £9.2 billion)
including acquired assets.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Continued success
Rod Kent
CHAIRMAN 5 BRADFORD & BINGLEY ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 WWW.BBG.CO.UK
Growth was predominantly driven by our
residential lending business where we grew
balances by 1 0% to £26.1 billion including
acquired assets, the Group’s best ever
residential lending performance.
Net interest margin decline has slowed
appreciably as our asset and liability mixes 
have stabilised. We expect a more stable trend
moving forward.
The arrears performance across all our
portfolios has continued to be good. The
Group’s experience in the specialist lending
markets and prudent approach to
underwriting is a substantial driver of this.
Balance Sheet and capital
We have continued to improve the diversity
and balance of our funding platform in 2005.
We made issues through our master trust
securitisation programme, our covered bond
programme and into the wholesale markets. In
addition, the Savings business has made an
important contribution.
The Group remains well capitalised and capital
ratios are within target ranges.
Retail
We have made progress with simplifying and
enhancing our customer proposition in our retail
branches. Efﬁciency gains made in 2004 have
been improved upon and our partnership with
L&G has continued to be fruitful.
Savings has had a strong year with balances
increasing by £ 1.5 billion to £ 1 7.7 billion.
Costs
Our cost cutting initiative has now been
successfully concluded. This has driven a
wholesale improvement in the cost dynamics
of the Group, driving proﬁt growth in 2005
and allowing us to convert a higher proportion
of income into beneﬁts for our shareholders in
the future. A stronger vigilance against cost has
developed within the Group.
There has been a cost attached to the Group’s
reorganisation amounting to £7.9 million. The
Board remains conﬁdent that this cost will be
rapidly offset by the beneﬁts of the substantial
savings we have achieved.
In common with ﬁnancial services ﬁrms across
the market, we have experienced an increased
level of claims for compensation for mis-sold
investment and endowment products. This has
exceeded the level we had previously
provided and a further charge of £38.7 million
is required. In 2004 the Group closed its
independent ﬁnancial advisory business which
was responsible for selling these products.
Board
I was pleased to welcome two new Executive
Directors to the Board in the second half of
the year. Chris Willford was appointed Group
Finance Director and Chris Gillespie was
appointed Group Lending Director.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to
Rosemary Thorne, who left the Board and the
Group in late 2005, for her contribution over
the last six years.
People
Bradford & Bingley’s continued success comes
about as a direct result of the efforts of the
people who work for the Group. We went
through substantial change and saw many
challenges during 2005. The commitment of
our employees has formed the bedrock of our
performance during a testing period.
Outlook
The Group is well placed moving into 2006.
Bradford & Bingley is stronger, leaner and
better equipped to convert growth into proﬁt.
The mortgage and housing markets are looking
robust, our lending pipeline is strong and we
expect our chosen segments of the lending
market to continue to outperform the wider
mortgage market. Our Retail businesses will
continue to build on the stronger foundations
we have been laying and we will continue to
improve our customers’ experience.
Bradford & Bingley’s strategic aims are clear and
the Group will continue to do what it does
best in 2006: build our strong specialist lending
business and grow our retail operations.
WE HAVE GROWN PROFITS WELL AND CONTINUED
THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR LENDING
AND RETAIL BUSINESSES IN 2005. THIS PERFORMANCE
IS PARTICULARLY PLEASING GIVEN THE EXTENT OF
THE CHANGES THAT THE GROUP HAS UNDERGONE
IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

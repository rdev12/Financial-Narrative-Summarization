BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Chairman’s statement
Chairman’s statement
We have created the platform
to build a successful specialty
pharmaceuticals company .
I am delighted that the acquisition of
Protherics PLC, which was completed 
in December 2008, received such
overwhelming support from both 
sets of shareholders. I believe that 
the enlarged Group has the resources,
capabilities, scale and strategy 
to become a sustainably profitable
specialty pharmaceuticals company.
Progress with integrating the
businesses has been rapid. By March, 
we had made key decisions about the
pipeline, personnel and sites and so
we were ready to start the new financial
year with clarity on goals, roles and
responsibilities. 
Results for the year
The reported financial results for the year show
strong underlying financial performance with 
organic growth from our recurring revenues and 
cash of £78.2m at the year-end. 
Revenues of £84.8m (07/08: £75.0m)
included £13.4m from new lines of business acquired
following the acquisition of Protherics. Gross profit
after revenue sharing and cost of sales increased 
by 11.2% to £47.7m (07/08: £42.9m). Total operating
expenses increased during the year as we included
the costs of the expanded BTG operations in the UK,
Australia and the United States. Operating profit
before acquisition adjustments and reorganisation
costs was £7.0m (07/08: £16.6m). After providing for
the costs of reorganisation and making acquisition
adjustments, the operating loss for the year was
£9.2m (07/08: £8.5m profit). We ended the year 
with a loss after tax of £13.1m (07/08: £8.8m profit)
delivering a loss per share of 7.1p (07/08: earnings
per share of 5.9p).
The acquisition of Protherics has provided 
BTG with the opportunity to build a profitable specialty
pharmaceuticals business. We are working quickly 
to leverage the underpinning strength of our revenue
streams and to drive the cost savings from integration.
Our strong financial position provides an excellent
platform for us to grow as well as stability in the
current uncertain economic climate.
Board changes
Christine Soden, who joined BTG in July 2005 as Chief
Financial Officer and became Chief Operating Officer
following the acquisition of Protherics, retired from 
the Board on 31 March 2009 and leaves BTG in June
2009. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank
Christine for her many contributions to the company’s
strategic, financial and operational development. 
We wish her well for the future.
Rolf Soderstrom, former Protherics Financial
Director, joined BTG as Chief Financial Officer
following the acquisition of Protherics on 4 December
2008. He is a strong addition to the Board and has
already played a major role in integrating the
business and getting it on track to achieve the
planned cost savings.
We are pleased that Jim O’Shea joined us as
a non-executive director on 2 April 2009. He brings
significant industry experience from his previous roles
at Sepracor and Zeneca Pharmaceuticals that will be
valuable as we build our US commercial operations.
Outlook
We anticipate continued good performance in 
our underlying business. Our revenues derive from 
a broad range of products, many of which serve
critical medical needs. Having taken key decisions 
on restructuring, we are on track to reduce operating
expenses by £10m by the end of the 2010/11 financial
year. In addition, having completed our portfolio
review, we anticipate that research and development
expenses will reduce as planned by £10m by 2010/11.
I would like to thank our management 
and employees, including those newly joined from
Protherics, who have worked very hard and shown
professionalism and commitment as we have
integrated the businesses. I believe that we have 
the team, resources and strategy to continue our
transformation into a sustainably profitable specialty
pharmaceuticals business.

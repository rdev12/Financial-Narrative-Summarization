●     Challenging year due to prolonged Forcados shut-in and reduced 
revenues, requiring careful working capital management.
●     Cash currently at $6 million with active working capital management  
to bridge return to Forcados pipeline cash flows.
●    Successful equity placing in April 2016 raised $18.5 million (gross) to 
support the planned work programme.
●    $15m of the Reserve Based Lending (“RBL”) facility with Standard 
Chartered Bank had been drawn down by 31 December 2016. The 
borrowing base amount was $25 million in 2016 with $3.5 million 
held in reserve until return to production. The facility underwent a 
redetermination in early 2017 with the borrowing base confirmed at  
$23.9 million, and the $3.5 million reserve requirement released.
●    Elcrest continues to benefit from Pioneer Tax status in respect of  
OML 40. Elcrest is exempt from paying Petroleum Profits Tax during  
the Pioneer period and in addition has an estimated $433 million tax loss 
pool subject to agreement by the Nigerian tax authorities to be utilised to 
offset future taxes.
●    Elcrest has recognised a $17.25 million liability to its local shareholder 
for management fees accruing since inception and invoiced subsequent 
to the period. Elcrest’s liability to Eland for the same had already been 
recorded. Therefore, Eland, through its subsidiary Westport, now has an 
amount to recover from Elcrest of $380.2 million in principal and interest 
as at 31 December 2016 and remains the sole secured creditor.

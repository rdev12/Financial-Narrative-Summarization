Annual Report 2008
Russia is the world’s tenth largest 
economy and has seen healthy GDP 
growth in recent years. It is widely 
viewed as an attractive emerging 
market for companies who are 
looking to grow their business.
Russia is a country with substantial long term 
growth potential and along with Brazil, India and 
China (the BRIC economies) is seen as an emerging 
economic power.
A signiﬁ cant driver behind Russia’s economy is its oil, 
gas and mineral wealth. This, along with a sustained 
period of political stability has underpinned the 
development of many other areas of the market. 
Russia’s car market has been one of the largest in 
Europe and other sectors such as food & drink, 
building & interiors and outbound travel and tourism 
have also seen signiﬁ cant growth in recent years.

Annual Report 2008
Since their independence from 
the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, 
the countries of Central Asia 
and the Caucasus have emerged 
as an increasingly attractive region 
for investment and economic 
development.
Kazakhstan is the world’s ninth largest country, 
covering a vast area and is rich in natural resources 
such as oil and metals. 
Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan also have signiﬁ cant 
natural resources. In Azerbaijan, revenues from the 
oil sector have fuelled some of the highest GDP 
growth rates in the world in recent years, helping 
to stimulate the expansion of many other industry 
sectors.

ITE Group plc
Annual Report 2008
ITE’s main interest in Eastern & 
Southern Europe is focused on 
the Turkish and Ukrainian markets. 
Both countries have delivered robust 
economic growth in recent years. 
Turkey and Ukraine are both keen to strengthen ties 
with the EU. Turkey opened accession negotiations 
in 2005 but have made slow progress. Ukraine is keen 
to build on its ‘association agreement’ with the EU 
but is hampered by internal politics and split loyalties 
between Russia and Europe.
Nevertheless, long term growth prospects remain good 
and there continues to be interest from companies 
looking to establish their business in the region.

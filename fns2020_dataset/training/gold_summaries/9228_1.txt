Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Chief  
Executive’s 
review
Richar d Glynn examines 
business performance  
in 2012 and expands on 
our performance 
objectives for 2013.
new shops paying back on average  
in around 2.5 years, we are confident  
in further opportunities to grow the 
estate. Next year we plan to open 100 
new shops on a net basis, targeting 
areas that are currently under supplied. 
Enhancing trading capability
Increased OTC profitability in 2012 was 
driven largely by a strengthening of  
our horseracing and football margins. 
Sporting results are a key factor in 
determining the performance of any 
betting business and there is no doubt 
that results in 2012, particularly across 
football during the second half of the 
year , have been favourable when 
compared with 2011. 
Results however are only part of  
the equation. More significant is 
whether the business is well placed to  
maximise returns and minimise losses 
consistently. In that respect, we have 
taken great strides this year to leverage 
the investment in our new trading 
platform. Better technology, increased 
automation and the continual evolution 
of monitoring tools and algorithms are 
enabling our trading teams to develop 
more control; decreasing volatility, 
whilst still ensuring a competitive 
product. In short we are improving  
the quality of our earnings.
This has benefited all parts of the 
business, with tangible improvements 
in our Digital and Retail gross win 
margins. We expect to be able to 
develop this further in the year ahead 
with more innovation continuing 
throughout 2013.
Developing customer value
Over the past two years we have 
invested in technology to enable us to 
deliver the best products and customer 
experiences to our Digital customers. 
We have redefined our core IT 
architecture, increased the flexibility  
of core supplier relationships, 
significantly expanded the range of 
products offered to customers and 
developed a new proprietary trading 
platform. By the end of March 2013  
Richard Glynn
Chief Executive Officer
2012 has been an important year for 
Ladbrokes. We have increased revenues 
in every major division of the business,  
grown underlying earnings, further 
strengthened our balance sheet by 
reducing net debt and also increased  
our dividend to shareholders by 14.1%. 
However , 2012 has been important not 
only because of a strong financial 
performance, but because of the 
significant progress we have continued 
to make in developing the business.
Growing on the UK high street
The performance of UK Retail in 2012 
further demonstrates the continuing 
appeal of betting on the high street. 
2012 was a record year for shop 
revenues and it is pleasing to see 
growth driven by Over the Counter 
(OTC) and machines. Operating profit 
growth in UK Retail has been strong 
with profit per shop ahead for the third 
year in succession assisted by our 
strong control of costs.
During the year we strengthened our 
position as the clear market leader in 
machines. Only two years ago, our 
performance placed us third or fourth 
in the market. Since that time through 
a determination to create the best 
possible offer for our customers we 
have added a further £84 million of 
machines net revenue.
Our competitors are not standing still 
and the machines market is constantly 
developing; we will be working hard to 
develop our offer further in order to 
maintain our market leading position. 
In 2013 we will start the rollout of a 
new, advanced machine cabinet which 
offers customers more interactive 
features through improved technology. 
We will also continue to offer the 
broadest and most exciting range of 
content, introducing new and exclusive 
games throughout the year .
Revenue growth in our OTC business 
during 2012 was in spite of a significant 
reduction in UK horseracing meetings, 
with the calendar affected by the 
British weather throughout the year . 
We are encouraged that the number  
of customers coming into Ladbrokes 
shops to place a bet has remained 
broadly flat during the year , showing 
that the popularity of retail bookmaking 
endures, alongside growth in online 
and mobile. 
We face several specific headwinds 
within UK Retail in 2013. The introduction 
of Machine Games Duty and ongoing 
operational cost pressures, particularly 
regarding horseracing picture rights 
are significant and we will address 
them as part of a clear and focused 
growth agenda. This includes an 
improved sports experience with more 
broadcast events, an increased retail 
Bet in Play offer via more self service 
betting, new video walls and the trial of 
new shop formats designed to create a 
more interactive environment for staff 
and customers. With our investment in  Regulation

Business review
we will have launched a new Digital 
sportsbook, with a new mobile 
platform to follow in Q2.
The focus for the business can now 
turn to growing net revenue per 
customer . The ongoing development of 
our new Active Data Warehouse, which 
is beginning to enable more effective 
insight into customer behaviour is  
the foundation for this. In parallel, we 
have begun to improve our Customer 
Relationship Management capabilities, 
refining the way in which customers 
are segmented, developed and 
rewarded as well as working closer 
with key suppliers and product experts. 
This has started to show some positive
outcomes and we will continue to 
explore opportunities which will help 
us accelerate this process going 
forward. We expect this to lead to 
improving metrics as the year 
progresses, with growth in net revenue 
and Digital profits, particularly during 
the second half of 2013.
Aiming to lead in mobile
Mobile is the key driver of growth in  
the digital market. Mobile devices are 
portable, convenient and increasingly 
popular . They are driving a trend 
towards more spontaneous 
consumption of betting and gaming 
opportunities. Over 33% of our Digital 
customers bet via a mobile device, 
with the number of mobile customers 
growing up to five times quicker than 
those using traditional digital means.
During the year we have continued to 
develop the Ladbrokes Sports Betting 
app, improving functionality and 
usability as well as adding more 
innovative features. We have also 
delivered more gaming product, 
particularly on tablet with a new live 
dealer casino and several exclusive 
slots games.
Our new mobile platform will be live 
during the first half of 2013. It has  
been developed in parallel with new 
Application Programming Interface 
(API) technology, which enables us to 
Our business model
Ladbrokes is in the business of providing excitement to customers. We deliver the excitement of sports betting and 
gaming in retail, online, via tablet, mobile and on the telephone. We are building on our brand leadership and heritage in 
the UK, Ireland and Belgium by expanding into new markets like Spain, and by establishing a presence in markets with 
significant future potential like China and the USA. In developing our product offer in each market we are governed not 
only by regulatory frameworks, but by a commitment to corporate and social responsibility. Our approach is to put the 
customer at the heart of what we do, develop best of breed products utilising a newly invested flexible technology 
platform to deliver unique customer experiences.  Business review 14

continued
adopt a flexible approach to launching 
apps, allowing the simultaneous 
development of a variety of products all 
targeted to meet the needs of different 
groups of customers. The ability to 
release new products quickly will be a 
real advantage in a market which is 
evolving rapidly. We expect to launch 
multiple new apps during 2013. 
Growing our international 
business
Our retail businesses in Ireland, 
Belgium and Spain contributed more 
than £20 million operating profit  
during 2012, an increase of over 50%.  
Despite tough economic conditions in 
Ireland our business there has been 
resilient. We expect legislation allowing 
extended shop opening hours in the 
Republic of Ireland to be introduced 
during the second half of 2013.  
In Belgium we expect further growth  
to be driven by the anticipated 
introduction of machines to shops.  
In Spain, our joint venture business, 
Sportium is now generating positive 
cash flow in Madrid and Aragon, 
regions where the business remains 
the clear market leader . During 2013 
we will roll out new Self Service Betting
T erminals, increase our presence  
in Valencia and expect to confirm 
opportunities for expansion into further 
regions. We also continue to develop 
our nascent businesses in the USA  
and China, both of which offer great 
potential for future growth.
Investing in our people
We are investing in making Ladbrokes 
a great place to work for our 15,000 
people. Employee engagement is 
critical to this, and we have rolled out 
several development programmes 
during 2012, aimed at giving people  
the motivation to go above and beyond 
to help Ladbrokes succeed.
Our Vision & Values programme is  
a long term initiative designed to give 
absolute clarity on how all of our 
people can make faster , better 
decisions using a common framework. 
It has been rolled out during the year 
through a series of roadshows, 
publications, videos and team 
development sessions, specifically  
with the aim of raising awareness  
and understanding of the company’s

perhaps even more critical, how the tax

Outlook
We have continued to make good 
progress throughout the Group during 
2012. The investments we have made 
over the past two years to reinvigorate 
the business are starting to drive 
performance. In 2013 we will invest 
further in our retail businesses and 
expect to see underlying benefits from 
our development of trading. With the 
launch of our new website and mobile 
services on track, our focus in Digital is 
on enhancing our customer relationship 
management capabilities. We expect  
all of these to drive increasing

improvements in our operational

strategic direction, and the behaviours 
and core values required to take us 
there faster . 
We have also this year launched a  
new talent development programme  
to identify, nurture and stretch our  
high-potential employees, which is 
essential for succession planning.  
By fostering an internal culture of 
excellence, we believe we will deliver 
an even better experience for our 
customers and in turn become a  
more successful business.
UK regulatory update
We are currently facing an active and 
often misleading media and lobbying 
campaign in the UK targeted at both 
shops and in particular gaming 
machines. We continue to work both  
as a company and alongside industry 
organisations like the ABB to tackle the 
myths propagated by this well funded 
campaign. We aim to ensure that 
Government, MPs and Local 
Councillors are fully aware of the  
facts regarding betting shops. 
Ladbrokes is a responsible business 
and we continually develop our 
approach to tackling issues like 
problem gambling. T o further restrict 
regulated and licensed high street 
betting shops whether in terms of  
shop numbers or availability of product 
would merely drive people to online  
or mobile services which are freely 
available, or would give rise to an illegal 
gaming machine market. It would also 
have a significant economic impact on 
high street employment. We will  
play a full part in the forthcoming 
Triennial Review of stakes and prizes 
consultation and we are reassured that 
the Government’s current position is to 
maintain the status quo. 
Other regulatory matters in the UK 
include the introduction of Machine 
Games Duty and the draft bill to 
regulate offshore gambling operators. 
We continue to engage with Treasury 
on the latest data supporting our case 
that Machine Games Duty is in fact a 
tax increase on the industry and we 
await the Culture, Media and Sport 
Select Committee’s pre-legislative 
scrutiny of the bill to regulate remote 
gambling operators, where our key 
concerns are both the rate of tax and

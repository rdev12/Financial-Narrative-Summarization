 6 ScS Group plc Annual Report 2015
Results
This	has	not	been	a	year	without	
challenges	but	the	business	has	made	 
good	progress	in	many	areas,	particularly	
in	pursuing	key	strategic	priorities,	
including:	continuing	to	broaden	its	sales	
base	in	new	categories	and	channels;	
driving	supply	chain	improvements	to	
reduce	costs	and	further	improve	customer	
service;	and	delivering	a	good	flow	of	 
new	store	openings.	However,	trading	
conditions	during	the	important	Easter	 
and May Bank Holiday periods this year 
proved	disappointing,	caused	primarily	 
by	a	particularly	warm	early	spring	and	the	
timing	of	the	general	election	campaign.	
As	expected,	a	normal	pattern	of	 
trading	resumed	towards	the	end	 
of	the	financial	year.	
Revenue	in	the	year	grew	by	13.4%	 
with	like-for-like	order	intake	up	5.0%	 
but	adjusted	EBITDA	for	the	2014/15	 
year	declined	to	£11.3	million	(from	 
£13.7 million in 2014) due to the initial 
losses	on	the	House	of	Fraser	concession	
agreement	and	the	period	of	weaker	trading.	
Further	details	of	the	trading	and	financial	
performance	of	the	business	during	the	
year	are	provided	in	the	Financial	Review	
section	of	this	report.

Chairman’s Statement
The Company’s IPO in January was an important milestone 
in its development. By welcoming a new institutional 
shareholder base and an expanded Board with the broader 
skills and experience that go with being a PLC, we have laid 
important foundations for the continued long-term growth 
and success of the business.
“ The business has 
made good progress 
in many areas, 
particularly in 
pursuing key  
strategic priorities.”

Our Values
  Deliver an exceptional 
customer experience
	 	 	 	 We	place	emphasis	on	
providing high levels of 
service	throughout	our	
customers	journey	from	point	
of sale, though to delivery, 
and	after	sales	service.
 Extensive product range
	 	 	 We	aim	to	offer	our	
customers	the	best	choice	
and value in the market-
place,	through	our	range	 
of	famous	brands	and	own	
label	products.
 Knowledgeable team
	 	 	 	 We	train	our	staff	to	 
talk	accurately	about	our	
products	so	our	customers	
can	be	confident	they	are	
making	the	right	choice	for	
their home.
 Growth focused
	 	 	 Across	the	business	we	focus	
on	growing	sales	and	profits,	
by	growing	sales	densities,	
diversifying the range and 
the development of our 
branded	offering.
We	have	a	clear	strategy	for	growth	
underpinned	by	strong	cash	flows	and	the	
Board	remains	positive	about	the	Group’s	
long-term	prospects	for	the	business.	 
We	are	also	encouraged	by	a	strong	trading	
performance	in	the	first	nine	weeks	of	the	
current	financial	year.
Dividend
The	Board	is	recommending	an	 
aggregate dividend payout of £5.5 million, 
representing a dividend per share of  
14.0	pence,	which	reflects	the	Board’s	
confidence	in	the	Company’s	future	and	 
is	in	line	with	our	commitment	at	the	time	
of our IPO. This level of payout is the 
equivalent	of	a	dividend	yield	of	8%	at	 
the	IPO	issue	share	price	of	175	pence	 
per share. 
Governance and the Board
We	have	put	together	a	strong,	balanced	
Board	with	a	good	blend	of	skills	and	
relevant	experience.	David	Knight,	CEO,	 
and	Ron	Turnbull,	CFO,	were	joined	on	 
the	Board	by	myself	and	two	other	
independent	Non-Executive	Directors:	 
Ron	McMillan	at	the	time	of	the	IPO,	and	
George	Adams	more	recently.	Paul	Daccus	
continues	on	the	Board	as	a	non-
independent	Non-Executive	Director	
having	been	appointed	by	Sun	Capital	
Partners	Management	V,	LLC	in	their	
capacity	as	principal	shareholder.	
Ron	Turnbull	announced	in	early	August	
2015	that	he	intends	to	step	down	from	 
the	Board	once	a	successor	has	been	
identified.	We	are	very	grateful	to	Ron	for	
the	significant	contribution	he	has	made	to	
ScS	during	his	11	years	with	the	business	
and	wish	him	well	for	the	future.	
Ron	McMillan	is	the	senior	Non-Executive	
Director	and	Chair	of	the	Audit	Committee.	
George	Adams	is	Chair	of	the	
Remuneration	Committee.	They	each	
contribute	diverse,	thoughtful	and	
informed	perspectives	and	also	apply	
independent judgement and assiduous 
oversight to the operation of the Board.
Colleagues
Through	our	expansion	programme	in	 
new	stores	and,	concessions	in	House	of	
Fraser	stores,	I’m	delighted	that	we	have	
welcomed	150	new	colleagues	into	the	
business	this	year,	bringing	the	total	to	
over 1,700. 
On	behalf	of	the	Board	I	would	like	to	 
thank	everyone	in	ScS,	whether	they	work	
in	stores,	in	the	supply	chain	or	in	the	 
office	support	areas,	for	their	continued	
dedication	and	hard	work.	We	want	ScS	 
to	continue	to	be	a	great	place	to	work	 
and	to	shop,	because	only	through	the	
commitment	and	expertise	of	our	
colleagues	can	we	deliver	our	mission	 
to	provide	our	customers	with	excellent	
service,	value	and	quality.
Outlook
Improving	consumer	confidence	in	the	 
UK	and	a	robust	housing	market	supports	
our	belief	that	demand	for	high	ticket	
items,	and	in	particular	for	furniture	and	
floor	coverings,	will	continue	to	grow.	 
We	expect	to	benefit	from	this	trend	as	we	
continue	to	pursue	our	strategy	which	is	
tightly	focused	on	the	targeted	marketing	
of	our	range	of	branded	and	own	designed	
products	through	our	national	ScS	store	
portfolio,	our	House	of	Fraser	concessions	
and	our	rapidly	growing	online	channel.

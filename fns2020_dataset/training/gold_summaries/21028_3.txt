Ashmore Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2010
It gives me pleasure to present the results for 
the year ended 30 June 2010 in what has been 
a good year for Ashmore Group plc (“Ashmore” , 
or the “Group”). The Group has made significant 
progress in financial terms, with strong growth 
in assets under management (AuM) and good 
investment performance producing management 
and performance fee growth. Through the 
maintenance of a robust and efficient business 
model, overall this results in an increase of 
36% in profit before tax to £217.2 million 
(FY2008/09: £159.8 million).
The Group has also made further progress 
in operational terms with the development 
of new funds and investment themes, 
increased scale and geographical reach 
to its distribution team, and, as part of 
the third phase of its strategy – mobilising 
emerging market capital – by developing 
further local asset management businesses 
in some of the key emerging markets. 
In recognition of this financial 
performance and underlining the Board’s 
confidence in the future prospects of the 
Group, the Directors are recommending 
an increased final dividend of 9.34 pence 
per share for the year ended 30 June 
2010 which, subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 3 December 
2010 to shareholders on the register 
on 5 November 2010. This makes a 
total dividend for the year of 13 pence 
per share (FY2008/09: 12.0 pence), an 
increase of 8.3%.
The Board continues to maintain 
its focus on good corporate governance 
and recognises the year has seen a new 
Corporate Governance Code released in 
May 2010 (“the 2010 Code”). Whilst the 
2010 Code does not apply to Ashmore 
until the next financial year the Company 
intends to adopt it with immediate effect. 
The team at Ashmore has had a 
year they can be proud of and I should 
like to thank them all for the efforts 
they have made in contributing to the 
achievement of these results. These remain 
challenging times in the global financial 
markets but the events of last year have 
emphasised the increasing importance 
of emerging markets within the global 
order. I am confident that Ashmore, with 
its long history and excellent track record 
of investment in emerging markets, is 
extremely well positioned to benefit from 
the growing opportunity.

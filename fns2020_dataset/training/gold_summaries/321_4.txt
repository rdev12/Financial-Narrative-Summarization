Business at a glance
Advanced has a clear structure focusing  
on specific areas of expertise in the health 
and care, managed services and business 
solutions markets. 
In the 18 months since Advanced began 
trading, a combination of organic growth 
and growth by selective acquisition has 
seen pro-forma* revenues rise to over £91m 
and EBITDA to over £21m. Advanced is  
now the 5th largest UK-based provider of 
software and services to the UK market**.
Following a restructuring in February 2010,  
the Group now comprises three divisions, 
each managed separately but with a 
common cross-selling policy to maximise 
Group revenue.
Advanced has built a strong position in  
the Healthcare sector – its software is the 
market leader for Out-of-Hours applications 
and 95% of NHS Trusts take one or more of  
its products.
To complement its suite of healthcare 
products Advanced has added a managed 
service and outsourcing capability as the 
Group believes the challenge to reduce  
costs and improve service quality will drive 
customers towards hosted and managed 
service solutions.
Advanced also has a strong presence  
in the commercial sector through its 
financial, human capital and document 
management solutions which improve 
efficiency and lower costs across a wide 
blue chip customer base.

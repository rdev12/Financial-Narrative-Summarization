 2004 has been a year of significant
achievement for Fibernet.
Our continued focus on winning new
customers, maintaining a high rate
of renewals, cash management and
cost control has delivered a strong
performance. In the year to August
2003 we reduced losses before
exceptional items* through cost
reduction measures. In the year to
August 2004 we have reduced such
losses* further through revenue growth
and gross margin improvement.
We have focused on signing new
business across a broader range 
of vertical markets with both existing
and new services.
As the positive effect of the
sustained high levels of new
contracts signed and installed over
the last two years is now being felt,
I am pleased to report an increase
in revenues for the year from £36.3m
to £42.2m. Combined with our close
control of costs, this has reduced
our loss for the financial year before
exceptional items* from £10.2m in
2003 to £5.7m in 2004. EBITDA**
before exceptional items rose from
£7.3m in 2003 to £12.6m this year .
The loss for the financial year
including exceptional items was
£5.1m as compared to £5.0m in
the prior period.
Chief Executive’s Review
An increase in revenue,
combined with our close
control of costs has greatly
improved our bottom line
performance.
Losses before exceptional
items have reduced from
£10.2m in 2003 to £5.7m
in 2004.
4 The total value of new contracts
signed in the year was £53.6m. Whilst
this was below the £58.0m achieved in
2003, the annual revenue contribution
of the 2004 orders shows an increase
on 2003 attributable to marginally
lower average contract lengths. The
important figure of total long-term
contracted revenues of the business
rose significantly from £97.8m at the
end of 2003 to £120.9m at the 2004
year end.
The renewal of customer contracts
nearing expiry has also gone to plan
during the year both with the expected
number of re-signings and their actual
revenue value. The fact that we are
able to achieve these renewal levels is
not only a result of our competitiveness
but also a testament to the high quality
of service and the close relationships
that we keep with our customers.
Cash reserves at the end of the year
were as expected at £15.7m compared
with £24.9m a year ago and £20.5m 
at the half year . Our operating 
cash flow improved from £9.0m to
£12.2m during the period and capital
expenditure was £15.8m. It continues
to be the case that the majority of
capital expenditure is related to the
acquisition of new customers.
Against a continuing background
of relative uncertainty in the general
telecommunications market, I believe
that Fibernet’s continued focus on its
market niche has produced a very
satisfactory result for the year .
Looking forward, we continue 
to expect a return to a position 
of sustainable profitability in the
medium-term with losses reducing
further in the year to August 2005.
We have made an encouraging start
to 2005 with significant contracts signed
from customers in the Banking and
Pharmaceuticals sectors and our
underlying contract renewal rate is as
expected. However , it should be noted
that one of our larger customer contracts
is due for renewal in the year ahead
and our current expectation is that this
renewal will be significantly lower than
the normal renewal rate; being due to
exceptional changes in the customer’s
own business. This being the case, the
rate of improvement would slow for the
second half of the year ahead.
* Exceptional items are detailed 
in note 3.
** EBITDA is reconciled to operating
loss in note 7.

During the year we were successful
in signing new contracts with many
corporates including Deloitte, Royal Bank
of Scotland and Co-Operative Financial
Services and I am pleased to report
strong rates of contract renewals with
customers including Goldman Sachs
and Standard Chartered Bank.
The services we provide to these
markets continue to be dominated 
by combined data, voice and video
transfer between the major centres 
of our customers. We have also signed
increasing numbers of contracts for
services that are designed to facilitate
the efficient storage and retrieval of
data. Fibernet is particularly well
placed in this part of the market, both
with a long experience in the area 
and also assisted by our Advanced
T echnology Partnership with Cisco
Systems for supply of the specialised
optical networking components that
are required to provide the service 
to the customer .
It has been pleasing to see the
take up of the new services that we
developed last year including our
Callchoice product and the expanded
TANet Access portfolio which allows
us to serve not only the high
speed/head office requirements of
our customers, but also, their branch
offices and retail outlets.
Customers and Markets
It is our enduring ability to provide
innovative, reliable and cost effective
services to our Enterprise and Service
Provider customers that provides us
with our competitiveness. However,
what sets us apart is the bespoke
nature of the way we design, install and
care for the service that our customers
use. Crucially , this also extends to the
commercial and contractual matters
and provides for flexibility over the life
of the relationship.
Our Service Provider market has
continued to develop well during the
year . Significant new contract wins
include Energis, AT&T and Fujitsu.
Renewals of contracts in the period
include Pipex and PSInet. The London
and Frankfurt Carrier Rings (LCR and
FCR) have continued to perform well
and membership numbers are at
record levels.
Our Enterprise market, as ever , is
characterised by longer sales cycles
and installation lead times than our
Service Provider market but continues
to provide a positive balance in terms
of longer-term contract lengths.
In 2004 we have continued to see
our sales develop well both in terms 
of our traditional Financial Services
markets and also Retail, Manufacturing
and Facilities Management /Outsourcing.

and resilience, thus reducing costs
and improving efficiency”.

Company Operations
2004 has been a year of considerable
progress on internal matters.
We have further developed and
expanded the underlying infrastructure
of the network to handle an ever
increasing customer demand for
bandwidth and new features.
Our MIS and IT department have
produced and launched enhanced
extranet facilities during the year to
customers who require online facilities
from us for order management and
service reporting. I expect that this
will be accelerated in 2005.
Fibernet’s own internal systems
and procedures across all departments
and offices have continued to progress
both to improve our efficiency and to
accommodate the continuing growth
in the business. We are now ISO9001:
2000 accredited throughout the 
entire Group.
Our network and the people that
operate it have provided our customers
with industry leading levels of care
and reliability . As a testament to this,
we have won “Best Carrier” at the
Internet Services Provider (ISPA)
awards and also the Metro Ethernet
Forum’s “Best European Ethernet
Service Provider of 2004” award.`
Product Development
We have continued our focus on
developing new services that both
complement the existing ones and
require levels of capital and marketing
expenditure that can be recovered
relatively quickly .
These include the provision 
of wholesale Internet access for 
our largest Enterprise Customers,
advanced telephony services using
the internet protocol (IP), and new
entry levels of membership for the
London and Frankfurt Carrier Rings.
In addition, we have strengthened
our supplier base to include a key
agreement with Huawei T echnologies
that will provide us with very cost
effective access to a broader range 
of networking electronics and
associated facilities.
As we continue to add new services
to our portfolios, (and within our niche)
we move ever closer to our long-term
goal of providing a total “end to end”
networking service for our customers.
We now have products which occupy
all positions of the market lifecycle
thereby maintaining a good balance
of emerging, new and mature streams
of income from our customers. 10

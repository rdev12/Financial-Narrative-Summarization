We have core competencies in
acquiring and developing quality
student accommodation in prime
locations. By encouraging non-
adversarial partnering
relationships with leading
construction companies and
design consultancies, we are
adding to our expertise to ensure
schemes are developed to their
optimum potential. Our project
management teams and the
innovative off-site modular
construction techniques we
employ mean that we can deliver
completed schemes in a
controlled, cost effective and
timely manner.
Uniquely in the sector, we retain,
market and manage our
accommodation, aiming to provide
our customers with the highest
standards of service and value.
UNITE has created an exciting new market sector for student
accommodation. We have set out to deﬁne our own future,
developing an unrivalled range of accommodation and customer
support services.

BUSINESS
I am pleased to report a solid 
set of results, driven by a strong 
performance from our 
international B2B companies. 
These results were achieved 
despite the impact on our UK 
consumer businesses from 
sharply higher newsprint prices 
and a weaker advertising 
environment. 
We have continued to refine 
our portfolio to optimise our 
talent and financial resources. 
In September we sold George 
Little Management, as part  
of our continuing drive to 
improve returns and in July  
we made our first significant 
acquisition for several years, 
backing Euromoney in its 
purchase of an initial 85% 
interest of Ned Davis Research 
Group. DMGT is strong both 
operationally and financially. 
Our debt has fallen further 
through strong operating cash 
flow and disposals, leaving us 
well placed to weather the 
uncertainties of the current 
Eurozone climate. We continue 
to build value and to grow 
revenues and profits.
CONTINUED GROWTH IN B2B
I again hail my father’s 
decision to diversify the DMGT 
portfolio. This year it has 
proved a masterful move. The 
percentage of operating profit 
derived from B2B is now 74% of 
the total (up from 67% last 
year) and continues to 
strengthen. A couple of 
highlights: RMS continues to 
lead their sector and this year 
they launched their new North 
America Hurricane and 
Europe Windstorm models  
that supply seamless coverage 
across 15 countries. 
dmg::events has expanded its 
presence in Saudi Arabia. 
Euromoney remains the 
game-changer in their 
industry: in August Singapore 
Mercantile Exchange 
launched the world’s first 
globally tradable iron ore 
futures contract, based on 
Euromoney’s MBIO index.
Meanwhile, our newspaper 
division remains resilient. In a 
difficult twelve months, the 
Daily Mail produced the 
strongest circulation 
performance of all national 
daily newspapers despite 
having increased its cover 
price. The Mail on Sunday 
became the largest-selling 
national Sunday newspaper 
following the closure of  
The News of the World. A 
revamped Metro is distributing 
a record number of copies, 
producing record advertising 
revenue and record profits.
MailOnline is now a global 
name and is set, I believe,  
to become the world’s most 
popular English language 
newspaper website. In 
October 2011, it recorded 79 
million unique visits of which 
25.7 million were in America 
where, with the opening of  
a New York office, we have 
expanded our operations. 
Meanwhile, MailOnline’s 
iPhone app is showing very 
exciting growth in both visitors 
and revenue. 
At Northcliffe, the future of four 
of our smallest dailies has been 
safeguarded by launching 
them as weeklies. This has 
resulted in a 50% increase  
in circulation with earnings 
totalling almost as much as 
was produced by the daily 
papers they replaced. My 
colleagues across the 
consumer businesses share  
my determination to see more 
such progress and innovation 
across all our titles.
This year more  
than ever, my  
father’s decision to 
diversify DMGT has 
proved to have been  
a masterful move.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
PRESS FREEDOM
The criminality at The News of 
the World has cast a shadow 
over the whole of the 
newspaper industry and, I 
believe, poses a greater threat 
to press freedom than has 
existed at any time in my life. 
Press freedom, of course,  
also demands ethical and 
responsible journalism – 
something, I know, the 
Editor-in-Chief of Associated 
Newspapers is committed  
to. In the ensuing battle over 
press regulation (which I firmly 
believe should result in a 
strengthened version of 
self-regulation) it is important 
not to forget that, but for a free 
press, many scandals in recent 
years, including MPs’ expenses 
and phone hacking, would not 
have been exposed. For my 
part, I continue to highlight  
the Company’s commitment 
to the importance of that 
freedom and the public’s right 
to know – something that my 
family has been dedicated to 
for over a hundred years and 
which I passionately believe is 
a cornerstone of democracy.
DIGITAL
Digital evolution continues  
in our B2B as well as B2C 
companies. In A&N Media 
there have been more than  
2.9 million downloads of their 
mobile apps and more than 
11% of Jobsite traffic comes via 
mobile. Our digital innovations 
go from strength to strength at 
Hobsons where this year they 
launched the College 
Confidential mobile app. Over 
50,000 downloads in the first 
eight months impressively 
reinforces Hobsons’ status  
as the most popular online 
college discussion forum. In 
our B2B portfolio, Quest, part  
of the Landmark Information 
Group, is revolutionising the 
speed and efficiency of 
mortgage valuations with its 
new tablet technology. And 
RMS remains at the vanguard 
of digital progression, boasting 
some of the most sophisticated 
software in the sector. These 
are just a few of our exciting 
digital initiatives.
INNOVATION AND 
TECHNOLOGY
Innovation and the 
deployment of new 
technology are the key pillars 
of DMGT’s exciting future. 
Supporting this, A&N Media 
hosted its inaugural 
technology summer school  
at Cambridge University. 
Delegates finished the  
week proposing ways that  
we might invest in innovation. 
Management teams across 
the Group are considering all 
suggestions. This forms part of 
a wider initiative whereby we 
are investing in, supporting 
and promoting innovative 
ideas and innovative people. 
Innovation and technology  
will provide the focal point for 
discussion at the Chairman’s 
Conference 2012 and the 
resulting ideas will be spread 
across the Group. We have 
launched DMGT Chatter,  
a business networking and 
collaboration tool, which is 
transforming the way our 
talented employees can share 
ideas with colleagues across 
the Group. 
OUR PEOPLE, OUR CULTURE
Selecting and retaining the 
best talent is something we 
can ensure. At RMS we have 
revolutionised the recruitment 
process, using video content 
and engaging explanations 
about prospective positions 
with a live chat function 
answering candidates’ 
questions on a real-time  
basis. Using this outstanding 
technology will help us to 
attract outstanding talent. 
The Nominations Committee 
already considers the benefits 
of diversity, including gender, 
when suggesting Board 
appointments. The 
appointment of women is one 
issue. Of equal importance is 
Innovation and new 
technology are key to 
our future.
But for a free press, 
many recent scandals 
would not have been 
exposed.
the representation of women 
in positions elsewhere within 
our businesses. As a major 
international employer, we  
are pleased that below Board 
level women account for a 
significant portion of our 
workforce – in some businesses, 
for more than half of our staff, 
including senior leadership 
positions.
The year has seen changes on 
the Board. In January, we 
welcomed Stephen Daintith, 
our new Finance Director to 
the Company and in February, 
we were fortunate to be joined 
on the Board by Dominique 
Trempont, whose appointment 
has brought considerable 
technology and international 
experience to it. In March we 
said goodbye to Peter Williams, 
our Finance Director since 
1991. Charles Dunstone has 
indicated that he will not stand 
for re-election to the Board at 
the AGM in February. He has 
provided us with sound advice 
over his ten years as an 
independent non-executive 
Director. I shall miss him.
At DMGT, we believe that  
our people are our future. We 
have the right people to make 
that future a success.

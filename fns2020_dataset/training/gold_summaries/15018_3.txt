Revenue from 
new strategic  
sectors

ahead of  
prior year
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report another good year 
of strategic development as we focus  
on creating a sustainable platform for 
continued growth.
There was further improvement in profit, 
from an underlying profit before tax of 
£1.8m in 2011 to £2.0m in 2012 on 
relatively stable revenue. We have  
seen the benefits of the Group’s 
diversification strategy being realised 
with 21% of business delivered from 
new strategic sectors. This has created 
genuine resilience and has been a 
contributory factor in a strengthening 
order book which is currently 10% 
ahead of prior year.
RESPONDING TO OUR 
CUSTOMERS’ NEEDS
Key to establishing the right platform for 
growth has been a clear focus on the 
needs and requirements of our customers 
and an ability to offer an holistic property 
support services solution. This has 
enabled the business to remain relevant, 
under particularly challenging market 
conditions, and has also ensured that  
we have been able to align our business 
interests with those of our customers.
FOCUS AND SELECTIVITY
It has been important over the course 
of the year to maintain a selective 
approach to new opportunities in order 
to maintain growth in profits whilst, in a 
strategic sense, investing in the future. 
During the year we have had significant 
successes in sectors with real 
opportunities for potential growth 
including Commercial, Education & 
Healthcare and Carbon Abatement.
This diversification, in areas where our 
historic retail credentials are particularly 
relevant, provides a sound basis for 
future sustainable profitable growth.
RECOGNISING OUR 
RESPONSIBILITIES
Recognising our corporate 
responsibilities is not only good  
business practice but also a necessary 
requirement for engagement with all of 
the Group’s stakeholders. Our 
appointment at national level to the 
Business in the Community’s Market 
Place Leadership Team and our direct 
contribution to the development of new 
industry standards for the sustainable 
refurbishment of buildings provides  
some positive differentiation in this 
respect. It is also particularly reassuring 
to note that our commitment to target 
zero significant accidents on our 
programmes and projects is now 
evidenced by an Accident Frequency 
Rate of 0.07* for 2012.

ORGANISATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
The year has seen fundamental  
change on a number of fronts including 
realignment and strengthening of the 
Executive Leadership Team. Operational 
excellence is at the heart of the Group’s 
ethos. The installation and adoption of a 
new fully integrated operating platform 
together with a suite of management 
systems has delivered improved 
business performance as well as a 
broader external expert accreditation  
of our skills and capabilities.
This approach drives confidence  
which together with our core skills  
in technical services and business 
systems’ applications helps to provide 
differentiation in the market place.
OUTLOOK 
Market conditions remain extremely 
challenging and show few signs of an 
imminent recovery. In such uncertain 
times it is difficult to predict the outcome 
for 2013 particularly this early in the year, 
and whilst we are encouraged by a 10% 
improvement in our order book, there 
has been a reduction in order intake in 
recent weeks. The banking sector 
continues to be a significant part of our 
business and has a strong weighting 
towards the second half of the year. We 
continue to invest in new markets for 
long term growth and are pleased with

our early progress. This mix of work, 
combined with increased  competition in 
our market, is however putting significant 
pressure on margins in the short term.
 Our future success relies on the quality 
and professionalism of our people and 
we are selectively adding to the team 
whilst at the same time reducing our 
numbers where skills do not correspond 
with the needs of a changing market.  
On behalf of the Board I would like to 
thank our colleagues for their hard  
work, commitment and creativity  
which should help us this year to 
maximise our performance in such  
tough market conditions.

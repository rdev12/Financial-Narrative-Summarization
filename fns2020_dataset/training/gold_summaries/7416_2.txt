Hilton Food Group plc 
Annual report and financial statements 2014 Strategic highlights
 – Our joint venture with Woolworths 
Limited in Australia is performing well. 
The conversion of the Bunbury site 
in Western Australia to substantially 
increase retail packed meat production 
was successfully completed in the first 
half of 2014.
 – Construction of a new dedicated 
retail packed meat facility, near Melbourne 
in Victoria, to be operated by our joint 
venture with Woolworths is on schedule 
to commence production in the third 
quarter of 2015.
 – Investment to modernise and expand the 
capacity of the Group’s Huntingdon site 
in the UK and service increased volumes 
for Tesco is well advanced, with the new 
production facilities fully commissioned.
Operating highlights
 – Volume growth of 3.5%, with growth 
in the UK and Holland partly offset by 
continuing pressure on consumer spending 
in other countries.
 – Revenue reduced by 2.3%, reflecting both 
the impact of unfavourable movements 
in exchange translation of 4.6%, with 
Sterling appreciating materially against 
all the overseas currencies in which the 
Group trades, and of lower raw material 
meat prices flowing through into reduced 
selling prices.
 – Operating profit at £26.1m ahead of last 
year (2013: £25.8m) despite an increased 
level of start-up costs in the UK and the 
impact of unfavourable movements in 
exchange translation.
 – Substantially higher investment in the year 
at £43.3m (2013: £18.4m) covering major 
re-investment programmes in the UK 
and Sweden.
 – A free cash outflow of £2.1m (compared to 
an inflow of £17.0m in 2013) reflecting the 
£24.9m increase in the level of investment 
expenditure, with net debt at £7.7m at the 
year end.
 – A strong balance sheet providing a solid 
platform both for future expansion and 
a progressive dividend policy.

 4 Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Report	of	the	Directors	About Unilever
This was a significant achievement 
in a world struggling to come to terms 
with an economic crisis, weighed down 
by low consumer confidence, high 
unemployment and sluggish growth 
in developed markets.
Unilever’s already strong reputation 
for responsible business practice was 
enhanced still further by the launch 
of the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan – 
a ground-breaking contribution which 
sets out our social and environmental 
ambitions for the coming decade 
(see page 20).
Innovation is the lifeblood of any 
consumer goods company and the Board 
is also pleased to see Unilever’s brands 
getting stronger and its pipeline of 
innovations becoming even more robust. 
The portfolio is also being sharpened 
through a number of acquisitions, 
in particular the Sara Lee Personal Care 
business and the announced acquisition 
of Alberto Culver.
In 2010 we welcomed two new Directors 
to the Board. Joining the non-executive 
ranks was Sir Malcolm Rifkind who 
has taken over the chairmanship of our 
Corporate Responsibility and Reputation 
Committee. Jean-Marc Huët was also 
elected to the Board in his capacity 
as Chief Financial Officer.
At the 2011 AGMs in May we will be 
saying goodbye to Jeroen van der Veer 
who will be retiring after nine years. 
Over the last few years, Jeroen has made 
an outstanding contribution in his role 
as Vice-Chairman & Senior Independent 
Director. He has also been an invaluable 
source of advice and support to me. 
We wish him well.
It is our intention to nominate Sunil 
Bharti Mittal from India for election to the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director at the 
2011 AGMs. I am very pleased that Sunil 
has agreed to join us. We believe his 
business acumen and experience in 
developing markets will further 
strengthen the expertise of the Board.
The focus of the Board in 2010 has been 
on strategy and governance. The strategy 
was reviewed in detail by the Board 
during a visit to Brazil with an emphasis 
on sharpening the Group’s vision and on 
the choices needed to enable Unilever to 
win in increasingly competitive markets. 
A key element of the strategy is the 
ambitious plan to take advantage of the 
enormous growth opportunities offered 
by the emerging markets of Asia Africa 
CEE and Latin America. These markets 
already account for more than 50% 
of Unilever’s business. We start from 
a strong base therefore in reaching the 
growing number of people in these 
markets who share the same aspirations 
as consumers in the West. We could not 
have chosen a better venue since Brazil is 
home to one of Unilever’s fastest growing 
and most dynamic companies. The Board 
also visited Germany in the year to review 
the Western European business, which 
returned to volume growth in 2010.
We conducted a review of our corporate 
governance procedures during the year. 
This has been recorded and published 
in an updated version of our document 
entitled ‘The Governance of Unilever’. 
The Board participated in enhanced 
training programmes in 2010, 
concentrating on further instruction 
and familiarisation with Unilever and its 
business. This has been achieved in formal 
knowledge sessions for the Non-Executive 
Directors on Unilever’s operations.
Most importantly, the Board also spent 
a lot of time during the year reviewing 
the talent pool of senior management. 
We were pleased, as part of this review, 
to see the significant step up being 
made in leadership development, as well 
as the continuing progress in the area 
of diversity and the award of most desired 
employer status in many places around 
the world.
This could not have been achieved 
without the commitment, dedication 
and hard work of Unilever’s 167,000 
employees spread across over a hundred 
countries. On behalf of the Board I would 
like to thank them for their efforts.
Michael Treschow

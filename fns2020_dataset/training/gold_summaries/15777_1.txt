The Group has continued to deliver strong sales and profit growth. In our first full year results 
we generated $15.1 million of revenue and growth of 9% on a pro forma basis (2011 pro forma 
$13.8 million; for the 23-day period after our admission to AIM, revenues were $171,000).  
Our adjusted EBITDA was $6.6 million (2011: pro forma of $6.1 million). The reported operat-
ing profit for the year was $1.2m (2011: a loss of $0.7m for the 23-day period) after amortisa-
tion charges of $4.4 million (2011: $0.3 million). 
Adjusted EBITDA
1
 margin for the group was 43% (2011 unaudited pro forma
2
: 44%). 
Adjusted diluted EPS was 4.2 cents (2011 unaudited pro forma: 0.02 cents). Statutory EPS  
for the year was a loss of 1.4 cents per share (2011: 2.7 cent loss per share).
Business review
The group has progressed successfully over the past 12 months and now operates under one 
brand across its operations. We also enhanced our sales team to capitalise on the potential 
within our baseball business and the increased awareness of the TLA organisation.
The baseball division was active during 2012, highlighted by four TLA clients being selected as  
MLB All-Stars in 2012. TLA now has 21 current and past All-Stars on our roster. In the MLB 
Amateur Draft, TLA advised 18 MLB draft picks, an increase of 20% on 2011. 18 of TLA’s clients 
were called up to the MLB compared to four in 2011. 
With the acquisition of PEG, TLA expanded into Latin America and is now a market leader in 
that sector. TLA is off to a strong start in 2013 with nearly 60 clients on MLB 40 man rosters, 
compared to 33 commencing the 2012 season. TLA recently completed a productive off-season, 
negotiating over $210m of contracts for its clients, compared to slightly over $100m in the 
prior off-season. 
The sports marketing division has performed well. We have invested in its sales resources, 
which slightly reduced margins in the short term. Golf had a solid year with 42 top 10 PGA 
Tour finishes and three new PGA Tour clients, including 2012 Rookie of the Year, John Huh, 
and 2010 USA Ryder Cup team member, Jeff Overton, signing with TLA for their exclusive 
representation. 
Talent marketing continued to perform well in commercially promoting its clients, negotiat-
ing deals with high-profile brands such as Pepsi, Red Bull and TicketMaster, as well as its 
exclusive marketing representation of top 10 draft pick in the National Football League, Ryan 
Tannehill. Coaching continued its upward trend by selectively expanding its client base, 
highlighted by its representation of eight of the 64 teams in the 2012 NCAA basketball champi-
onship tournament. Broadcasting added more than 10 new clients to its roster meaning TLA 
now has clients commentating across the media spectrum for networks including ESPN, the 
MLB, NFL and NHL Networks, CBS, NBC, Fox and Turner.
Acquisition
Part of our strategy is to acquire companies that fit into and further enhance our business and 
strategy. It was for this reason that we acquired PEG in November 2012. The acquisition moves 
us into a leading position in the Latin American baseball player market as well as enhancing 
our position as a leading baseball management business in the USA. Latin America is a key 
area for baseball representation, with 23.5% of MLB players originating from Latin America. 
PEG’s key markets of the Dominican Republic and Venezuela produce 10.2% and 7.3% of all 
MLB players respectively.
The integration of PEG into the TLA baseball business is progressing well, with the re-brand 
complete. The additional reach, combined with industry recognised agents, will only continue 
to enhance the TLA brand. During 2013 we intend to consolidate all our New York operations 
into one office, which will complete our integration.
The baseball division 
was active during 2012, 
highlighted by four TLA 
clients being selected 
as MLB All-Stars in 
2012. TLA now has 21 
current and past All-
Stars on our roster.

of the US sports market
Equity and debt financing
As part of the acquisition of PEG we raised additional equity. It was pleasing not only to have 
the support of our existing investors but to see new institutions supporting TLA. In January 
2013 we renegotiated our banking facilities, which are in place now until January 2018.  
This enabled us to reduce the interest paid margin by 1% and increase our overall facilities  
to $15 million. The increase in the facilities is by way of a $7 million revolver, which is in 
addition to our current $8 million term loan facility. The revolver is available for the future 
requirements of the group, including acquisitions.
Our markets
The baseball market continues to go from strength to strength. The estimated MLB revenues 
for the 2012 season is expected to be $7.5 billion (2011: $7.2 billion). That revenue figure is 
underpinned by the rapidly growing local broadcast rights market and league attendance. 
MLB’s 2012 gate increased to nearly 75 million, marking a return to pre-recession levels.  
The 2% year-on-year increase is the fifth highest in its history and the largest since 2008. 
These positive factors, combined with the new TV rights deal of $1.55 billion per annum from 
the 2014 season, give MLB a sound footing.
The overall US sports market is worth $48 billion per annum. The key segments of sponsorship 
and media rights are respectively worth more than $9 billion and $12 billion per annum.  
These segments are forecast to grow faster than the overall US sports market at 6.3% and 
7.8% per annum against growth of 4.7%
3
 for the total market. Drilling down further into the 
sports marketing landscape, PGA Tour revenues rose in 2012 to a record high of $1.11 billion, 
highlighted by a nine-year television deal which commenced in 2011 and averages $800 
million per annum. These markets are key drivers for the growth of TLA’s business as they 
underpin the spend by MLB baseball teams as well as increasing our ability to secure  
sponsorship opportunities for our clients.
People
One of the strengths of our business is the quality of our people. As well as the Board appoint-
ments of Andy Pearson and Gareth Jones, we have made a number of key hires, including the 
fulfilment of the newly created position of Senior VP, Business Development. On a personal 
note, I would like to thank all of the TLA team for their enthusiasm, energy and support over 
the last year.
Outlook
As set out in the chairman’s statement, the Group will continue to build upon its progress 
in 2012 by developing organically by expanding the current service offering and geographic 
presence, as well as seeking to make strategic acquisitions if and when the right opportunity 
presents itself.
TLA intends to become the pre-eminent, fully integrated representation and marketing 
services agency with on-field focus on professional baseball. As a combined group, TLA offers 
industry-leading capabilities in baseball, broadcasting, coaching, golf and talent management. 
TLA today offers a stronger platform to recruit new clients and identify new opportunities 
across the portfolio.
2013 has started as expected and the Group is performing is in line with the Board’s  
expectations.

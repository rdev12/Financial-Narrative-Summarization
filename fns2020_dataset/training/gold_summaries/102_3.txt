The Board of 888 Holdings Public

present its first set of full year 
results since the Company’s 
flotation in October 2005 – a major 
step forward and the successful 
result of a long-term growth plan 
for the business.
These results demonstrate the 
strength and growth potential of our

our key strengths of an industry 
leading brand, a highly diversified 
gaming offering and a widening 
geographic footprint.
In the year to 31 December 2005 
we achieved total Net Gaming 
Revenue of US$271 million and 
underlying Profit after tax excluding 
share benefit charges of US$65 
million. Continuing to build profitable 
sustainable topline momentum is

10 By the end of the year we had more 
than 23 million registered member 
accounts and over 330,000 active 
members, representing 177 different 
countries and supported 11 different 
languages for our Casino-on-Net 
offering – a real testament to the 
strength and global appeal of our brand.
The significant achievements of this 
year would not have been possible 
without the support, contribution and 
dedication of our staff whose passion, 
knowledge and enthusiasm gives us a 
further competitive advantage in this 
fast moving market.
The online gaming market is maturing 
and, whilst online regulation is still in its 
infancy, we welcome the UK’s entry into 
the online space through the Gambling 
Act 2005. Of note is the Gibraltar 
Gambling Ordinance which introduces a 
bespoke regulatory regime in Gibraltar 
for remote gaming and further 
consolidates Gibraltar’s position as a 
first-class online gaming jurisdiction. 
Generally, we are seeing a change  
in emphasis of regulators, who are 
looking beyond the grant of licences 
and are focusing more on compliance 
and codes of conduct within the 
industry. This is an area where 888 
has sought to take the lead. We  
were one of the founding members  
of eCOGRA (e-Commerce Online 
Gaming Regulation and Assurance),

Our strategy is clear. We aim to 
create sustainable shareholder 
value by becoming the market 
leader in the global online

gaming activities.
developed a series of self-regulatory 
guidelines for the online gaming 
industry. As online gaming develops 
into a mainstream leisure activity we 
believe further clarification of the 
regulatory position in relation to online 
gaming would be a positive driver  
for growth by enhancing consumer 
confidence and trust in the sector.
board
I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
chair 888 and to welcome to the Board 
three new Non-executive Directors: 
since August 2005, Michael 
Constantine, a former Inspector and 
Acting Commissioner of the Gibraltar 
Financial Services Commission and 
Brian Mattingley, former Executive 
Director of Gala Group Plc; and from 
March 2006 Amos Pickel, Chief 
Executive of Red Sea Hotels Ltd.
With their outstanding complementary 
experience, I am confident that our 
new Non-executive Directors are 
superbly qualified to provide invaluable 
support to our executive team in the 
years ahead.
The Board’s commitment to the 
highest standards of corporate 
governance and corporate social 
responsibility is detailed in the 
Corporate Governance section of 
this report on pages 24 to 28.
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I  
would like to express the Group’s 
appreciation to Marie Stevens for  
her contribution.
dividend
The Board intends to implement, in 
2006, the dividend policy set out in 
the Financial Review on page 19.
outlook
Our strategy is clear. We aim to create 
sustainable shareholder value by 
becoming the market leader in the 
global online gaming industry, providing 
our members with a comprehensive 
selection of uniquely-created gaming 
activities and offering a secure, trusted 
entertainment experience.
I am pleased to report that we have 
already begun the new financial year 
with strong organic growth. 2006 will 
see continued investment in the 888 
brand through worldwide innovative 
marketing initiatives, such as the 
recently announced five year 
sponsorship of the World Snooker 
Championship, which will be known 
as the “888.com World Snooker 
Championship”.
888 is well placed to benefit from 
expansion into new geographic 
markets – as Internet penetration 
continues apace and we react to local 
regulatory developments. We will also 
look to extend the range of products 
so that we can offer members the 
complete online entertainment 
experience. All of this gives me great 
confidence about our future prospects.

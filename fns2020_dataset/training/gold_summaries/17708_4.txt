Accsys’ operations comprise three 
principal business units:
1
 The commercial scale Accoya®  
wood production and sales  
facility in the Netherlands; 
2
 Accoya® and Tricoya®  
technology licensing; and
3
 Technology and product  
development.
The Company’s technologies and brands are 
internationally protected by strict confidentiality, 
granted patents, patent applications and trademarks. 
Many have been technically validated at full 
commercial production level and long term use, and 
others are in pilot-scale or are subject to independent 
validation by experts. 
The Group aims to deliver significant 
financial and environmental benefits 
through:
  Reductions in unit production costs; 
  Lower capital costs enabling commercial production at 
scales not hitherto possible, with additional capacity 
expected to be generated from our plant in The 
Netherlands and the exploitation of our technologies 
globally; 
  Improvements in environmental outcomes (lower 
waste output, reduced energy consumption and faster 
cycle times); and 
  The ability to produce innovative, high-performance 
products.

Our products
Our technology 
Accoya is based upon acetylated wood technology, a process that has been studied by scientists around the world for more than 80 years.
The physical properties of any material are determined by its chemical structure. Wood contains an abundance of chemical groups called 
“free hydroxyls” (represented as OH in the picture). Free hydroxyl groups adsorb and release water according to changes in the climatic 
conditions to which the wood is exposed. This is the main reason why wood swells and shrinks. It is also believed that the digestion of 
wood by enzymes initiates at the free hydroxyl sites – which is one of the principal reasons why wood is prone to decay.
Acetylation effectively changes the free hydroxyls within the wood into acetyl groups. This is done by reacting the wood with acetic 
anhydride, which comes from acetic acid (known as vinegar when in its dilute form). When the free hydroxyl group is transformed to an 
acetyl group, the ability of the wood to absorb water is greatly reduced, rendering the wood more dimensionally stable and, because it is 
no longer digestible, extremely durable.
Accoya® wood is produced 
from sustainably sourced, 
fast growing wood and 
manufactured using Accsys’ 
proprietary patented 
modification process 
from surface to core.
OVERVIEW
Accoya® is the world’s leading high technology long life wood. 
Created via acetylated wood modification, using sustainably grown 
timber, the Accoya® process creates a modified wood that matches 
or exceeds the durability, stability and beauty of the very best 
tropical hardwoods.
APPLICATIONS
Accoya® wood is ideal for windows, external doors, cladding, 
siding, decking and structural projects due to world class 
dimensional stability and class 1 durability.
OVERVIEW
Tricoya® acetylated wood elements (including chips, fibres and 
particles) is a revolution in modified wood fibre technology.
APPLICATIONS
The potential applications for Tricoya® are far ranging and will
inspire creativity and discovery, particularly in environments 
where humidity and weather are usually concerns. Typical 
applications include: Façade cladding/siding and other secondary 
exterior applications, window components, door components and 
door skins and wet interiors, including wall linings.

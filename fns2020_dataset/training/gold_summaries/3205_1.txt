 04 Centrica plc report 2003 
We believe that the fundamental drivers of profitability
within our brand units will continue to improve as we 
broaden and deepen the relationships we have 
with our customers.
Chief executive’ s review
Overall the group delivered a
strong performance in 2003 with
adjusted basic earnings per
share up 11% on 2002. This was
delivered despite the impact of
the second consecutive year of
warm weather which, unusually ,
in 2003 also brought with it higher
commodity costs; both of these
depressed reported margins 
in our gas supply businesses.
However , the underlying
strength of the Centrica 
model with its unique balance 
of upstream and downstream
positions, together with the
positive impact of acquisitions,
has enabled us again to deliver
record profits despite these
adverse external factors.
T urnover and profitability
Group turnover (excluding
Accord trading revenue) was
£11.7 billion in 2003, up 17%
from 2002. Increases were
achieved in all of the main
customer facing businesses as
well as in the industrial and
wholesaling division of the
Centrica Energy Management
Group (CEMG). The highest
growth came from North
America (up 112%) due mainly
to the full year impact of the 2002
acquisitions in T exas. Despite
the unseasonably warm
weather , turnover in British Gas
increased with positive year-on-
year contributions from energy ,
home services and telecoms.
Group operating profit* of
£1,058 million was up 14% 
from £932 million in 2002. 
The lower profits in British 
Gas residential and Centrica
Business Services, due to the
impact of weather and higher
commodity and transportation
costs, were more than offset 
by significant improvements 
in other units, particularly North
America, the AA and CEMG, 
and the full year contribution
from Centrica Storage.
Cash flow, capital expenditure
and acquisitions
Group operating cash flow (from
continuing operations, including
dividends from joint ventures and
associates, before exceptional
payments) was £1,321 million for
2003 compared with £795 million
for 2002. An increase of
£141 million to £1,463 million 
in operating profit* before
depreciation was supplemented
by a decrease in petroleum
revenue tax (PRT) payments of
£109 million and the acceleration
in 2002 of transportation
payments of £168 million.
In 2003 there was a 
considerable reduction 
in acquisition expenditure
compared to the prior year .
Receipts from disposals net of
acquisitions were £292 million
versus net expenditure in 2002
of £935 million. This was
primarily due to the net receipt
on the disposal of Goldfish
Bank, partially offset by both our
purchases of the Roosecote and
Barry power stations, and
deferred consideration on the
2002 acquisition of customers in
T exas. Operating cash outflow
on discontinued activities of
£301 million mainly reflected the
repayment of Goldfish Bank
deposit accounts.
Lower spend in respect of the
business transformation
programme within British Gas
was the main contributor to the
reduction in net capital
expenditure and financial
investment, down £120 million at
£282 million (2002: £402 million).
The group’ s net cash inflow
(before management of liquid
resources and financing) was
£652 million, against a net
outflow of £918 million in 2002.
Outlook
We believe that the fundamental
drivers of profitability within our
customer facing brand units will
continue to improve as we
broaden and deepen the
relationships we have with our
customers through innovative
product offerings and improved
service and targeting. This will
be underpinned by further
investment in our gas and power
asset base.
British Gas is now part way
through its transformation with
the heavy financial investment in
hardware and software having
taken place. We believe this root
and branch reform of systems and
processes will genuinely transform
the customer experience which
is at the heart of the profitability
of the business. We are now
allocating £40 million to the
programme for costs which were
previously in other British Gas
budgets; for example property
costs, post-commissioning
running costs and the cost of
staff back-filling. T ogether with
some additional home services
functionality now specified
(£10 million) we expect the
programme to cost around
£400 million. We have decided
to extend both the pilot and
deployment phase for the cross-
selling technology and are now
around nine months behind the
original timeline; this decision
was taken to ensure the integrity
of the system and to preserve our
customer service levels as we
roll-out to the wider user base.
The delay in implementation is
not expected to materially impact
either costs or benefits from the
programme. The next two years
will be challenging as we put the
remaining elements of the systems
infrastructure in place and the
investment continues in the
wider transformation programme.
The first material net financial
benefits are still expected in 2005
and we retain our 2005 margin
target for British Gas at 8%.
With churn rates within the
British retail energy industry
stabilising, we expect recent
levels of customer losses in gas
and gains in electricity to be
maintained throughout 2004. 
As yet it is too early to assess 
the precise effect of the price rise

in January 2004 aimed at restoring
gross margins to 2002 levels. A
key aim for us will be to build on
our success in 2003 in retaining
in gas, and gaining in electricity ,
a greater proportion of higher
value customers. T o assist the
expansion of the British Gas
brand, early in 2004 we will trial 
a wholesale line rental (WLR)
telecoms solution in the UK
which would allow us to provide
a single bill to customers for 
both line rental and call charges.
This will enhance the customer
experience and give us the
platform we require to 
accelerate the growth of 
British Gas Communications
and so further contribute to
strengthening the relationship
we have with our customers.
With Centrica Business Services
we will seek to consolidate our
position as the leading supplier
of energy products to the
commercial sector in Britain.
Having integrated the
businesses acquired over the
last two years, we are now
concentrating on investing 
to transform the customer
experience, on enhancing 
our ability to react to market
changes and on cross-selling.
We intend to add to our gas and
power asset portfolio in 2004.
We continue to target further
investment of around
£100 million per year in gas
reserves to support our UK
customer demand and we also
intend to increase our equity
hedge in electricity in the UK
with an investment of around
£250 million over the next three
years. 2004 may also bring 
the first material spend on our
renewable generation assets 
as, with successful surveys, we
begin construction of the 90MW
offshore wind farm at Barrow.
We are also actively seeking
further assets in North America,
particularly in T exas, where 
we aim to acquire electricity
generation plant to support 
our retail business.
We have taken measures over
recent years to increase the
deliverability from our gas fields.
While on average, over the
medium term, gas production
from Morecambe will decline by
around 10% per year , we expect
production levels in 2004 to be
similar to 2003.
We have an ongoing programme
of maintenance work on our
Rough storage asset which 
will further improve the
operational performance 
of the asset and reduce the 
risk of material outages. With
this, and the market-driven
movement in the summer/
winter gas price differential, we
expect Rough’ s profitability to
exceed our initial expectations
and to show a marked year-on-
year improvement.
The AA will continue to seek
revenue growth through value-
adding product developments
underpinned by further
improvements in operational
efficiency . We expect to see 
real benefits from the roll-out of
new technology to the roadside
patrols with improved service 
to our customers and reduced
cost-to-serve. An integrated
single customer services
organisation will help to further
deepen the customer relationship
and enhance the cross-selling
opportunities within the AA.
In order to maintain its competitive
position in the UK telecoms
market, One.T el is establishing 
a call centre in India. We expect
this to lower the cost base
significantly while maintaining
the current levels of customer
service. A successful trial in 2004
of a WLR solution will further
enhance the customer experience.
In North America we have
achieved a scale which allows 
us to move steadily forward. 
We will add organically to our
top-line with a concentration 
on value. Alongside this we will
use our new business services
organisation to support our
current retail positions and 
enter new markets, targeting
medium sized enterprises 
with a full range of energy and
related services. We continue to
pursue acquisition opportunities
but, in the current regulatory
environment and given our
concentration on value, these
are likely to be complex and
difficult to execute.
The competitive environment 
is likely to continue to develop 
at different speeds across
Europe in the short term.
However there is a clear 
timeline for deregulation and 
we are well positioned to enter
the available markets at the 
right time and when the right
opportunity appears.
Our progress in 2003 has only
been possible because of the
efforts of our employees. We
recognise that the further growth
of Centrica depends on having
people with appropriate skills
who are committed to the success
of the company . I am pleased
that in 2003 we achieved a very
high response rate to our
employee survey which allows
us to identify the issues and
areas for improvement as we
progress our people strategy .
In summary , our strategy has
always been and remains to
maximise long term value by
deepening our relationships with
customers assisted by sharing
knowledge and best practice
across the company . At the same
time we must achieve a cost of
goods advantage through optimal
upstream procurement. This
strategy and our clear focus on
value delivery , including value-
adding acquisitions when
identified, will enable us to grow
both top-line revenue and,
through improving operational
performance, bottom line earnings
in the medium term. We remain
committed to a financial structure,
including appropriate debt
levels, which best rewards our
shareholders. We expect this to
include, in 2004, another significant
step towards our targeted
dividend payout ratio of 40%.

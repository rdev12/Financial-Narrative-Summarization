 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report a successful first year’s implementation of
the three year plan that we set out in November 2001.
As you may recall from last year’s Report & Accounts, the
strategic review concluded that:
• Express (UK express business-to-business parcels) should 
remain the Group’s core activity;
• five existing or new businesses in related sectors - UK Pallet 
Express, International, HomeServe, UK Today and UK Mail - 
should be developed alongside the core activity, each led by 
an expert in that sector;
• strategic acquisitions should be selectively considered, either 
to achieve critical mass in a particular activity or to add a 
complementary service to the existing range of time-definite
deliveries;
• in all its businesses, Business Post should remain a premium 
rather than a volume player; and
• the franchise network, which Business Post regards as a 
competitive advantage, should be increased in number and 
strength.
Last year, I made the following remarks in my Chairman’s
Statement about short term prospects "The current year is the
first of a three year strategic plan during which we expect to
make substantial progress. It will be a year of investment for the
future, notably in the franchise network and the Group’s newer
and smaller businesses. Notwithstanding these cost increases,
further progress can be expected in the current year."
All of the above conclusions of the strategic review have been
put into effect:
• Express has grown substantially its turnover and increased its
market share, to approximately 7%, ranking it equal fourth;
• all the Group’s businesses, including UK Pallet Express (as part
of Express), have developed significantly under the guidance 
of their own managing director, except UK Mail, which has
been unable to commence trading for reasons outside its
control;
• Business Post has made its first acquisition since its flotation
in 1993, the technical courier BXT;
• Business Post is increasingly focused on achieving a 
substantial premium over the prices charged by the high 
volume/low price operators; and  
• the franchise network is not just larger but also considerably 
stronger.
Despite the planned cost increases, pre-tax profit was 6.6%
better at £16.1 million, in line with long standing market
expectations, whilst earnings per share were 6.0% higher at
21.2p.
As I concluded a year ago, "The Board remains very confident
about the Group’s long-term potential."

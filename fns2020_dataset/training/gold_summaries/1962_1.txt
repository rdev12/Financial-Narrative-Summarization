 Chief Executive’s Review

Ben Bailey Plc
Whilst successfully completing 450 new homes in
2003, your company has taken advantage of the
favourable housing market to enable it to report
increased turnover, enhanced margins and a
further year of record profits.  This structured
growth emanates from good local knowledge of
the land and housing markets, coupled with solid
management of the operational aspects of the
business – marketing, design, technical and
construction.
The Market
There is no doubt that the economic environment
of low inflation and low interest rates coupled
with good employment prospects, has enabled the
housing market to maintain its momentum
throughout the year, despite early concerns of the
Iraq War.  This conflict did have some effect, but a
prompt conclusion ensured customer confidence
was not damaged.
In our area of operations - east of the Pennines
between Leeds and Nottingham - house price
inflation continued throughout the year, whilst
planning delays frustrated the supply side of our
industry.  Demand for our range of house types
was strong as output increased to 450 plots (2002:
405 plots). This together with an increase of
14.8% in the average selling price to £139,500
enabled the Company to achieve record turnover
of £62.8 million (2002: £49.2m).  
Our new house types ranging from one bedroom
apartments through to five bedroom detached
executive homes are now firmly established and
proving popular with both home buyers and
investors seeking to buy to let.
Financial Review
T urnover
T urnover increased from £49.2m to £62.8m,
which represents an increase of 27.6%.  The
number of legal completions increased to 450
units, an increase of 11.1% over the 2002 level of
405 units.  The average selling price increased
from £121,500 to £139,500, an increase of 14.8%.   
Operating Profit
Operating Profit increased by 69.9% to £13.7m,
(2002: £8.1m).  Operating Margins increased to
21.9% (2002: 16.4%).  This significant increase
reflects the strength of the housing market within
our area of operations.
Profit before Tax
The Profit before tax increased by 71.5% to
£12.88m, (2002: £7.51m).  The effective tax rate
was 30.3% (2002: 29.4%).  Basic Earnings per
Share increased by 60.8% to 79.24p per share
(2002: 49.27p).
Capital Employed
The return on opening capital employed was
71.4% (2002: 47.4%).  The increase in capital
employed in the year of £20.65m arose as a result
of increased spending on development land of
£26.36m (2002: £10.05m).  This has resulted in
the Company’s land bank of owned plots with
planning permission increasing to 1458 plots
(2002: 945 plots).
Cash Flow and Gearing
The significant investment of £26.36m in 2003 in
development land referred to previously, has
resulted in an operating cash outflow of £8.05m
(2002: operating cash inflow £5.09m).  As a result
of this, Gearing expressed as a percentage of net
debt to shareholder funds has increased from
37.8% to 75.2%.

Chief Executive’s Review

T reasury 
It is the Company’s policy to finance itself
through a mixture of shareholders’ funds and
debt.  In March 2003 the company negotiated its
banking facilities to incorporate a three year
committed facility of £18 million with a further
£7 million borrowing facility to meet short-term
borrowing requirements.  The Company has an
interest rate risk management policy which allows
a proportion of the Company’s debt to be
protected against adverse interest rate movements,
by using simple interest rate risk management
products.  At 31 December 2003 the Company
had entered into an interest rate swap from
floating to a fixed base rate of 3.94% in respect of
£9 million of its borrowings.
Corporate Social Responsibility Review
This Company has always recognised its
responsibilities and commitment to the local
community.  Our operational area has seen
significant structural change with the demise of
the mining, steel and rail industries.  We have
always helped and must continue to help in areas
where we have carried out development.
The Company provides significant financial
assistance to local schools seeking approval as
‘Special Status’ schools.  We actively encourage all
of our employees, sub-contractors and suppliers
to contribute towards the community projects – a
notable example of this is the re-furbishment
work on classrooms at the Robert Ogden School
for Autistic Children based here in the Dearne
Valley.
Health and Safety
Health and Safety Management is an essential part
of our business.  The Company in the conduct of
its activities will ensure that it protects the Health
and Safety of its employees and other persons who
may be affected.  Procedural Review and Safety
Audits are carried out at all of our locations on a
regular basis with the aim of achieving further
improvements to create a safe and incident free
culture.
T raining
The Company firmly believes that well-trained
employees are vitally important for its future
success.  We encourage our employees to develop
their skills through both in-house training and
external courses.  The Company has always had an
apprentice scheme for joiners and bricklayers.  
T wenty four young people are currently employed
by the Company at various stages of their
apprenticeships, which combines site based
learning with attendance at local colleges.

ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF 
DIVERSE MARKETS ACROSS 
THE GLOBE.
As the world’s leading provider of strategy, data services 
and so�ware solutions to the fuel retail industry, our approach 
is continually informed by trends, large and small, in both the 
technology space and the fuel retail marketplace. The increased 
complexity of fuel retailing, coupled with expanding market 
deregulation around the globe, positions the Company 
as a critical, strategic partner for our clients. 
As such, the Company has created a Strategic Advisory Services 
division, charged with leading our clients through their most 
critical business deliberations. The Strategic Advisory Services 
group will leverage the Company’s market data and analytics, 
soware solutions and domain expertise to provide a 
di�erentiated service for our clients.
In addition, the Company has released the Kalibrate Cloud, 
a Soware as a Service (“SaaS”) o�ering that will allow the  
Company to reach new market segments and more e‚ciently  
deliver its solutions. Based on the Company’s 7 Elements  
for Fuel Retail Success (pricing, location, market, facility,  
brand, merchandising and operations), this new o�ering  
not only includes traditional soware products such as  
Pricing and Planning, but also the Company’s extensive,  
global market data and services as well as strategic 
recommendations that span each of the 7 Elements.

Kalibrate Pricing is a comprehensive,

to optimise wholesale and retail fuel 
pricing strategies. Underpinned by

proprietary technology and people 
enable our clients to succeed in today’s 
competitive fuel retail marketplace.

Kalibrate’s Location solutions allow our 
client’s to maximise capital investments 
across their store network through 
in-depth market and demand analysis,

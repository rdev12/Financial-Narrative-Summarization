 2012 Group highlights
2012 Financial summary
•	Building on a stable platform, the business transformation  
has begun and is focused on:
Building an effective organisation:
–  Changes in organisational structure and key management in order to break down 
historic silos, energise our people and implement cultural change; 
Addressing cost and cash management:
–  Driving efficiency through global procurement, centralised hotel purchasing and 
consolidation to reduce fixed and overhead costs and improve working capital:  
over £100m of annual cost benefits and £50m of incremental working capital 
improvements already identified and significant further opportunities to come; and 
 Creating profitable growth:
– Developing an online centre of excellence with powerful channels tailored to local 
markets by leveraging the latest technology to deliver true omni-channel distribution.
•	Net debt reduced through asset disposals and working  
capital management: 
– Net debt reduced by £103m (from £891m to £788m); and
–  Liquidity headroom at circa £1bn, £160m higher than prior year.
•	Gross profit of £2.1bn, with resilient gross margin despite input 
cost pressures; underlying profit from operations 49% lower  
at £156m, in line with expectations but significantly impacted  
by £110m in higher fuel costs.
•	Fourth quarter financial performance in line with the same 
period last year, reflecting a significant improvement on the  
first three quarters of the year. 
•	Loss for the year of £590m, including previously disclosed  
goodwill and other write-downs of £369m and business 
repositioning costs of £81m.
•	Good current trading, with summer 12 ending strongly and  
winter 12/13 trading off to a good start in our major markets,  
with bookings ahead of committed capacity and improvements  
in pricing; our capacity strategy will reduce operating risk in an 
uncertain consumer environment as the Group implements its 
business transformation.

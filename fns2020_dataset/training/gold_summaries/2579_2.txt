OUR BUSINESS
BTG acquires rights to early-stage
pharmaceuticals and other medical
technologies from a global network 
of corporations, universities and 
research institutions. 
We demonstrate proof of concept in
preclinical and clinical development
programmes. We then license the
technologies to pharmaceutical or
device companies, or create
companies to exploit them.

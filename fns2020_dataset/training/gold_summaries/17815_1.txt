 10 ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
I am delighted to present the Group’s results for 2015. 
The year was a strong one and culminated in the 
successful IPO of the Group shortly after the year end.
Track record of growth, high margins and 
good cash generation
We delivered a strong operating 
performance in 2015 with a 6% Organic 
growth in revenue to £319.1m and a 
14% Organic growth in Adjusted EBITDA 
to £90.9m, with an expansion in margin 
from 27.3% in 2014 to 28.5% in 2015. 
We continued to generate good cash 
flow with free cash flow of £79.9m 
(2014: £68.3m) representing free cash 
conversion of 88% (2014: 80%).
Focused portfolio of 
market-leading products
We operate a focused portfolio of just 32 
product lines, 23 of which hold the 
number one position in their respective 
markets. We believe that our focus of 
management time on market-leading 
products is a key driver of our growth. We 
also focus most of our resources and time 
on our top products. All five of 2014’s top 
products performed well in 2015 but 
Groundsure grew faster than our leading 
education technology event, Bett, and 
entered the top five product list in 2015. 
The top products in 2015 were:
• In Information Services: WGSN 
and Groundsure
• In Exhibitions & Festivals: Cannes 
Lions, Spring and Autumn Fair and 
Money20/20.
Our top five products represented 53% of 
the Group’s 2015 revenue (2014: 49%) 
and 64% of its Adjusted EBITDA (2014: 
58%). Further details on the performance 
of each of the top products are given in the 
segmental analysis on pages 24–27.

STRATEGIC REPORT | GOVERNANCE | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
Clear organic growth strategy
We have continued to deploy multiple 
initiatives for growth across our products 
with a clear aim of increasing both volumes 
of customers
1
 (up 3% in 2015) and average 
revenue per customer (up 5% in 2015).
The growth initiatives we deployed in 
2015 included the launch of new digital 
products (such as Retail Week Prospect), 
the embedding of auto-renewal across our 
subscriptions customers, geo-cloning of 
exhibitions (such as CWIEME Istanbul) 
and show extensions (such as Lions 
Innovation). These are each described in 
more detail on pages 1 and 26.
Diversified and recurring 
revenue streams
Revenue by type
The Group benefits from diverse revenue 
streams the majority of which have 
recurring characteristics. The most 
significant change over the last year has 
been an increase in events as a proportion 
of Group revenue, to 55% (2014: 53%), 
despite considerable currency headwinds 
for our largest event, Cannes Lions. Print 
advertising, by contrast, has reduced to 
just 4% (2014: 6%) of Group revenue. 
Revenue by geography
Continuing the theme of prior years, our 
share of revenue from overseas markets 
increased again in 2015 and now just 48% 
of revenues come from customers based 
in the UK (2014: 52%). The performance 
of Money20/20, WGSN and Cannes 
Lions has increased the revenues from 
the Americas to 21%, with Asia Pacific, 
Middle East and Africa, and other Europe 
contributing 9%, 6% and 15% respectively.
1 Customer volumes and average revenue per customer 
are measured for Exhibitions & Festivals and the 
subscription products within Information Services.
Disciplined operational approach
The foundation of our growth is, and will 
continue to be, our focus on customer 
retention – there is no better way to judge 
the quality of our products than to 
measure how many customers choose to 
renew their contracts with us each year, 
and we spend considerable time reviewing 
those customers who do churn. Retention 
rates have grown considerably across our 
top products and this key measure is also 
supplemented through the year by Net 
Promoter Scores and product usage 
statistics, both of which are growing well 
across the board.
We continued to adjust and optimise our 
portfolio of products. During 2015 we 
acquired RetailNet Group, a forecasting 
and analytics business in the retail space 
for a consideration of £5.1m (net of cash 
acquired). This acquisition strengthens our 
Planet Retail offering by adding dedicated 
US coverage, expansion of the combined 
products to provide further forecasting 
capabilities and new US clients. We 
also disposed of Media Business Insight 
(consisting of Screen International, 
Broadcast, shots and BRAD) to funds 
advised by Mobeus Equity Partners.
Outlook
The new financial year has started well. 
Since the year end, Spring Fair, Bett UK 
and Pure Spring have taken place and 
performed in line with our expectations. 
Preparations for Money20/20 Europe in 
April also continue to progress well. While 
still early in 2016, we are encouraged 
by the current level of forward bookings 
and are confident of another good 
year of growth for the Group.
Strategic priorities for 2016
Our strategy and priorities for 2016 are 
unchanged. Our growth plans will continue 
to be focused on customer retention and 
our top five product expansion plans. 
We are 100% focused on enabling further 
success for our customers so that we 
may continue ours. We will continue 
to find new ways to satisfy, retain and 
grow our customers through investment 
in product features and extensions, new 
product development, and initiatives such 
as auto-renewal, onsite rebooking and 
location-based pricing. We are excited 
about the opportunities for 2016.

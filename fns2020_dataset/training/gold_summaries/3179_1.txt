Since the start of the project we have 
exceeded annual production targets 
and our cash costs of production have 
remained in the lowest quartile on the 
industry cost curve.
Kounrad Operations –  
Record Production in 2014
During 2014, the Company’s production at the 
Kounrad project continued to be a success. We 
produced 11,136 tonnes of copper cathode and 
surpassed our production target of 11,000 tonnes 
whilst maintaining a low cash cost base. During 2014, 
our C1 cash cost of production was $0.71/lb (2013: 
$0.73/lb) and fully absorbed costs within Kazakhstan 
were $1.30/lb (2013: $1.13/lb). The increase in fully 
absorbed costs is due to increased depreciation and 
amortisation charges as a result of the accounting 
treatment of the acquisition of the additional 40% 
share in the Kounrad project in 2014.
A total of 11,163 tonnes of copper (2013: 10,689) 
were sold at an average copper price of $6,794 
per tonne (2013: $7,114) resulting in annual 2014 
gross revenue for CAML of $76.6 million (2013: 
$54.1 million) and $161.4 million cumulative gross 
revenues to 31 December 2014 since operations 
commenced. This revenue stream combined with 
the low costs of production helped to generate a 
Kounrad project EBITDA for the year ended  
31 December 2014 of $56.0 million.
During 2014, the utilisation rate of the plant was 
98.7%. The performance and efficiency of the SX-
EW plant continued to meet our expectations and is 
further evidence of the reliability of the plant design, 
equipment selection and construction methods 
employed from the outset.
Similarly, the quality of the copper cathodes 
produced continued to be of a high standard 
and met all contractual conditions and 
London Metal Exchange (LME) specifications.
Our commitments to the local community and 
environment continued to be a key focus during the 
year. Significant efforts have been made to ensure 
that we comply with all the local environmental and 
health and safety legislation.
Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Director, 
Nick Shirley, is based on site in Kazakhstan to 
lead these activities and is tasked with raising 
environmental and health and safety standards  
to ensure they meet industry best practice.
Whilst health and safety is key to the welfare 
of our employees, the Group did record its first 
lost time injury (LTI) since the commencement 
of construction four years ago. The injury to the 
employee was relatively minor and he made a quick 
and full recovery and has since returned to duties.

Kazakhstan economy and specifically in the local 
area. We currently employ approximately 330 
staff on site and paid $24.8 million in taxation 
to the Republic of Kazakhstan during 2014 whilst 
contributing $280,000 to local causes through our 
voluntary and regulated subsoil use contract (SUC) 
social contributions.
Kounrad Ownership and Expansion
During the year, and as part of the process of 
purchasing the remaining 40% ownership of 
the Kounrad project, the Group received all the 
necessary approvals from the State for the transfer 
of ownership. On completion of the transaction in 
May 2014, Mr Kenges Rakishev, a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company became a 20% 
shareholder of the Company.
Following the completion of the transaction, the 
expansion plans for the project commenced in 
May 2014. The Company plans to invest $35 
million into the project in two specific stages. 
Stage 1 is to increase copper production at the 
SX-EW plant to 15,000 tonnes per annum by 2016. 
The estimated cost for this stage is $15.5 million 
inclusive of the capital costs for constructing the 
boiler house extension. Stage 2, at an additional 
estimated capital cost of $19.5 million, will extend 
the life of the mine to enable the resource from the 
Western dumps to be leached and processed. The 
programme of works for Stage 1 will be completed 
in Q2 2015 using the same CAML construction 
personnel that worked on the construction of the 
current SX-EW plant.
Stage 1
An additional 5.6 MW of boiler capacity was 
commissioned on schedule in October 2014 to 
facilitate increased production throughout the 
winter months. The total capital cost of building 
and commissioning the boiler was $1.4 million. 
In June 2014, the Company commenced the 
construction programme for the expansion of the 
existing SX-EW plant. This involves the addition of a 
new mixer settler unit (SX), a new 5,000 tonne per 
annum capacity Electro-Winning (EW) facility and an 
upgrade to the existing electrical sub-station. As at 
31 December 2014, work was progressing well and 
we remain on target for commissioning in Q2 2015.
Stage 2
The Stage 2 expansion will only commence upon 
receipt of all the necessary approvals and mining 
permits required from the State to allow leaching 
operations on the Western dumps. All the required 
applications have been submitted and we hope to 
have obtained all approvals by Q2 2015.
The Stage 2 expansion programme’s focus is on the 
extraction of copper from the Western dump area. 
Exploitation of the Western Kounrad resource area 
will be f acilitated by the construction of two 12.6km 
pipelines from the expanded SX-EW plant in the 
East to the Western dumps. This will allow for the 
transportation of pregnant leach solution (PLS) and 
raffinate solution from the Western leaching areas to 
the plant for processing. The Stage 2 expansion plans 
also involve the construction of three additional boilers 
at the Western leaching area together with solution 
collection and pumping f acilities. The anticipated cost 
is approximately $19.5 million, phased from late 2015 
and completion is planned for 2017. 
Growth Opportunities
Copper Bay Project – Chile 
During 2014 we progressed the Copper Bay 
project having acquired a 50% shareholding 
in November 2013. As at 31 December 2014, 
significant progress had been made on the 
in-house developed preliminary feasibility study 
(PFS) although a number of technical aspects 
required additional work.
At the time of CAML’s investment there was no 
approved JORC resource despite several previous 
drilling campaigns and resource calculations 
prepared by former owners. Consequently, a 
drilling campaign was planned in consultation 
with Wardell Armstrong International (WAI) and 
conducted in August 2014 during which a total 
of 136 holes were drilled to an average depth of 
9.2m. The analysis of the data has enabled WAI 
to commence preparation of a JORC compliant 
resource statement.
During much of the year the focus of the PFS work 
has been on assessing the most efficient means 
of extracting the copper from the resource. The 
preferred process route is for the tailings to be 
reclaimed by dredging from the beach zone, with 
the reclaimed solids then pumped to the processing 
plant for copper recovery through an acid leaching 
process followed by froth flotation. The treated waste 
tailings from the plant will then be either returned to 
the beach zone as coarse backfill or sent to a tailings 
management facility (TMF) as fine tailings.
During this period emphasis was placed on 
metallurgical testing, using the WAI laboratory 
facilities in Cornwall. The results from the test 
programme have indicated that a copper recovery 
in the range of 70% to 73% can be achieved using 
the process mentioned above. Additional testing 
performed on a 7 tonne bulk sample taken from the 
2014 drilling programme is under consideration as 
part of the next stage of the project.
These additional aspects of the work remain 
ongoing, together with the environmental and 
social studies, and it is anticipated that the PFS will 
be completed in Q2 2015. A decision whether to 
then invest a further $3 million to increase CAML’s 
stake to 75%, in line with the Investment and 
Shareholder’s Agreement, will be made shortly 
thereafter.
Other Opportunities
Elsewhere, we continue to look for additional 
business opportunities to enhance the value of the 
CAML portfolio. Whilst the expansion at Kounrad 
and the 100% ownership of the project will increase 
the cash generation capabilities of the Company, 
the CAML Board is keen to further increase returns 
to shareholders by taking advantage of the Group’s 
balance sheet strength and technical skills.
During the year the Company established a formal 
business development function in its management 
structure to establish and execute an accretive 
growth strategy. Underlying these objectives is to 
ensure solid shareholder value by targeting only 
those opportunities that will deliver profitable 
production and be accretive to our shareholders.
CAML’s management has well-established expertise 
in project delivery, mining and processing operations, 
which together with the financial strength afforded 
by strong cash flow and a debt-free balance sheet, 
will allow the Company to assess a broad range of 
opportunities.
CAML will assess opportunities in Kazakhstan as 
well as Europe, Africa and the Americas. Although 
business development activities are constant, there 
are currently no transactions in process.
Outlook
During 2014 the copper price fell by 18% and a 
further reduction in prices was seen in January 
2015. Indeed, by the end of January 2015 copper 
prices had fallen to a five and a half year low of 
approximately $5,505 per tonne.
Whilst such price reductions are not ideal they are 
also outside of our control. Consequently, we will 
focus our efforts on what we can control and strive 
to maintain our low cash costs of production and 
meet our production target for 2015 of 13,000 
tonnes of copper. Delivery on time and within the 
capital budget of the expansion programme at 
Kounrad is a primary objective for the year. 
Alongside all of the above operational objectives 
we will continue to actively pursue additional 
business opportunities that may arise from the 
challenging nature of the commodities market as 
well as making some key decisions on the future of 
the Copper Bay project in Q2 2015.

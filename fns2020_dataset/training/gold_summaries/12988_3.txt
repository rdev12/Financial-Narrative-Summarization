RapidCloud International Plc  l  Annual Report 2014 2
I am particularly pleased with the Company’s performance in its
second year trading as a publicly listed entity. Both the financial
results are strong and the continued investment in the staff,
technology and products provides confidence for the coming
year.
Financial Review
During the year, the total number of customers increased 11%
to 42,000 whilst increasing our average revenue per customer.
In terms of financial performance, the results for the financial
year showed continued growth with revenues increasing 57%
to RM 17.82 million (2013: RM 11.34 million). Gross profit was
also up 14% to RM 9.67 million (2013: RM 8.46 million) with
gross margins decreasing to 54% (2013: 75%). Profit for the
financial period after tax and basic earnings attributable to
ordinary shareholders increased by 45% to RM 3.67 million
(approximately £0.66 million) (2013: RM 2.53 million).
Successful fund raising and Acquisition
We were delighted that new and existing shareholders
supported us in raising new funds of RM 3.24 million post our
admission to AIM. 
We completed the acquisition of Exxelnet during the year for a
total consideration of RM 4.59 million of which, half was paid
as an initial consideration in cash and the remainder being
contingent on future profits and to be settled by the issue of
new ordinary shares in RapidCloud. We acquired the business
with a solid customer base and remain confident that the
combined Group will benefit greatly from cross-selling and
up-selling opportunities.
The acquisition provided us with a profitable business in
Singapore, which is the world's fourth largest financial centre
and has recently become the preferred location for many
multi-national companies to position their global headquarters.
The acquisition also delivered a highly skilled workforce, which
we knew would integrate well with the existing business and
offer us increased scale and reach to deliver further growth.
Awarded Emerging Business Excellence Award
The Company was delighted to receive a Business Excellence
Award at the annual Sin Chew Business Excellence Awards
(“SCBEA”) 2014, sponsored exclusively by CIMB Bank. 
Launched in 2013, the SCBEA aims to set the benchmark for
corporate excellence in Malaysia. Every year, SCBEA honours
businesses for their efforts in exemplifying strategic
management approaches.
The award serves as one of the highest accolades for the
enterprises which have achieved utmost excellence in all key
business management disciplines which form the strategic parts
of organisational growth and sustainability.
This award is testament to RapidCloud’s ongoing progress and
development.
Investment in business
During the period, we continued to invest in personnel, product
and corporate development. The acquisition delivered
incremental skillsets and we continued to develop products and
successfully launched a suite of new products. These products
have already gained traction in their target markets and
provide significant confidence for the future.

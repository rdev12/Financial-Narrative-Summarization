 more important to combine
our services and, in this way,
offer excellent value. We win
most business not by taking
market share from our
competitors but by gaining
additional business through
existing customers. 
Q
What do you enjoy about
being CEO of Intertek?
A
Intertek is a very exciting
company. I like the fact that
we are creating so much value
for our customers and,
through that, for our investors
and employees. I also like the
variety – not many companies
cover so many different
industries. And of course as
Chief Executive, you can get
close to the customers and
industries we serve and gain a
very good understanding of
every market. I enjoy the fact
that we are involved in nearly
every technical area and all
areas in natural science –
that’ s very challenging and
interesting. Finally, as we are a
people business, I enjoy
nurturing the cultural identity
and passion of our employees
to succeed.

Q 
What does Intertek do?
A
We help our clients achieve
success in the global market
place. We do this by providing
testing, inspection and
certification services, but we
also go further. We add value
to our clients’ businesses and
their products – we become a
vital part of their success.
Q
How is Intertek helping
customers achieve
their goals?
A
Our clients face many global
challenges. Trading and
manufacturing is continually
shifting across borders.
Customer demands in both
developed and developing
nations change on a regular
basis. New legislation is
constantly being introduced
covering quality, safety,
environmental and social
compliance. At the same
time, new products must be
designed and introduced into
these markets as quickly as
possible. 
We provide the support that
keeps our clients ahead of the
game. We take care of all the
non-core activities related to
their products and commodities.
This frees them to focus on
running their business and
makes sure their brand image
is protected when it comes to
quality, safety and
environmental issues.
Q
How is Intertek structured?
A
Our business units are
focused on the broad range
of industries we serve:
Consumer Goods;
Commercial & Electrical
products; Oil, Chemical & Agri
Services; and Government
Services. In each industry we
have experts who live and
breathe the needs of our
clients. These experts
combine our different services
to provide solutions that meet
our clients’ needs. 
Q
What are Intertek’s main
strengths?
A
We are very strong on both a
global and local level. Our
local management are leaders
in their industries. We enjoy
solid relationships with our
customers, be they a multi-
national retailer or a local
manufacturer with a single
product line. And in many
industries we are in a leading
position. It’ s a position we’ve
gained through providing
quality, adding value and
building long-term
relationships.
Q
Are there any weaknesses
you are looking to address?
A
If we have a weakness, it’ s
that we are not always the
leader in our industry sectors.
I’d like to see Intertek being
first or second in all our core
service industries. And there
are still regions where we are
some way from being in the
top two – in Japan for
example. But I see this as an
opportunity for growth. 
Q
Where do you see the main
areas of expansion?
A
Intertek is supporting global
trade – which grows faster
than GDP – so our underlying
markets will continue to show
good growth. We will also
improve our competitive
position in these markets. But
the growth ultimately comes
from persuading our clients
that outsourcing their quality,
safety and environmental
services to us will make them
more successful. 
Q
Are you concerned about
the increasing competition?
A
It has always been a
competitive market and this
will continue. We have to
innovate and increase
productivity to keep ahead of
the competition – just like any
other business. But for us it’ s

• unrivalled global
resource
• key industry focus
• adding value
through synergy
Q
What’s your
management style?
A
In a business with over
15,000 employees you have
to be flexible and use a range
of different management
styles. For me, active listening
and leading by example is
very important. I always try to
put myself in the shoes of our
customers, managers and
employees. I expect everyone
at Intertek to follow this
service-led mindset. 
Q
What have Intertek’s
biggest achievements been
over the past year?
A
We’re now promoting
Intertek as a single company.
Our employees no longer see
just their traditional divisions –
they are proud of Intertek as a
whole. It’ s been very
important to develop this
single brand and it’ s not just
about a brand image, this
‘one company’ ethos has also
helped us work together
more effectively. One example
of this is the RoHS Directive.
This legislation, relating to the
restriction of hazardous
substances in electrical
products, is covering
numerous industries and our
labs are set up to address
that. We also made good
progress by making
acquisitions in the oil and
chemical industry and the
electro-technical industry.
Q
Any downsides?
A
The only downside has been
that we lost two contracts in
the Government Services
division. These contracts
provided excellent value for
our clients, but unfortunately
other considerations can play
a part. However, I think we’re
in a good position to win new
contracts, particularly in cargo
scanning services. 
Q
What’s your view on the
future and the year ahead
for Intertek?
A
We are very well prepared for
the year ahead. In Consumer
Goods, we have the capacity
to keep up with growth in
developing countries. We
have a very good approach to
all different industries in the
Commercial & Electrical sector
and the success we have seen
to date in executing our
strategy in this area will
continue. And in Oil,
Chemical & Agri, we will
continue to increase the
breadth and depth of our
analytical services and push to
do more upstream work
relating to the cargo side of
the business.
Crucially, we will continue to
offer our existing services but
we will also do more. We will
add more value, we will
combine our services, and
eventually become number
one in more industries.
Intertek is a business that
strives to add value for our
customers – and through that
approach, we’re adding value
for our investors and
shareholders.

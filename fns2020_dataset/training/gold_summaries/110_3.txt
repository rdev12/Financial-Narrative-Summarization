888 Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013
“Our goal is to deliver strong, sustainable, 
long-term earnings growth by maximising 
revenues and expanding margins.”
Richard Kilsby Chairman
2013 was a year of strategic development for 888 as we 
positioned ourselves to take advantage of significant 
opportunities as new markets became regulated and opened 
up to online gaming and high-growth mobile channels 
developed. This was underpinned by excellent momentum 
across our established business streams which delivered 
another record performance driven by our excellent customer 
offering and targeted marketing.
The global online gaming market has dynamic growth 
characteristics, providing 888 with multiple development 
opportunities given our ability to innovate, international reach 
and industry leading technology platform. These enable 
us to enter new markets quickly and effectively and focus 
our marketing initiatives highly efficiently. In particular we 
continued to innovate in mobile with significant increases in 
revenue and new depositors achieved through this rapidly 
growing channel. 
We have entered newly regulated markets in the US and 
continued to develop our successful operations in Spain 
and Italy. During 2013 we completed a number of strategic 
partnerships which position us strongly in the emerging US 
regulated market. Our distinct approach gives us significant 
financial firepower to take advantage of this opportunity and 
we are encouraged by progress to date in Nevada, New Jersey  
and Delaware.
Financial results and dividend
2013 was another record year for 888. We increased revenue 
to a record level of US$401 million, of which 88% was from 
our B2C operations. We continued to make significant 
investments in the future through product development and 
cost effective customer acquisition whilst increasing Adjusted 
EBITDA* by 13% to US$76 million (2012: US$67 million) and 
profit after tax by 41% to US$50 million (2012: US$35 million). 
888 was highly cash generative during the year holding 
US$116 million of cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 
2013 (2012: US$82 million) with US$55 million liabilities to 
customers (2012: US$49 million). At 31 December 2013,  
888 had 15.5 million Casino, Poker and Sport real money 
registered accounts, representing a 19% increase from 2012.
Given the strong financial performance of the Group, the 
Board is recommending a final dividend of 4.0¢ per share 
(which together with the interim dividend equals 7.0¢ per  
share in accordance with our dividend policy) and an 
additional one-off 7.0¢ per share, bringing the total for the  
year to 14.0¢ per share (2012: 9.0¢ per share). 
Winning team
888 has world class talent with a team of more than 1,600 
highly skilled and dedicated staff. They are the driving force 
behind our success including the strong performance in 2013. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all my colleagues 
for their excellent contribution and commitment to fulfilling 
the ambitions we have for the business.
Our values
Our values and a strong culture are key to our success with 
a responsible gaming environment for our customers at the 
centre of all our endeavors. We continuously create innovative 
ways (such as our sophisticated Observer System) to ensure 
that all those who visit our site can do so with confidence and 
safety, and that those for whom our games are not intended 
are not drawn into a gaming environment.
Outlook
888 has world class technology and products, a truly 
international breadth of operations, and a dedicated and 
expert team. These are our key strengths as we continue to 
grow and unlock new market opportunities. I am confident we 
have the right strategy to deliver a truly satisfying experience 
for our customers and strong, sustainable, long-term earnings 
growth for our shareholders.

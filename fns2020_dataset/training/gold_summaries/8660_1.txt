James Fisher and Sons plc 
Chief Executive’s review
Principal corporate objectives
• deliver progressive long-term growth in underlying earnings per share
• deliver progressive dividend growth
Underlying diluted earnings per share has grown 
over the last fi ve years by a compound rate of 
13% per annum largely through organic growth 
supplemented by a number of niche acquisitions.
The Group’s dividend policy is progressive by 
reference to underlying growth and dividend cover. 
Dividends have grown by a compound rate of 9% 
over the last fi ve years and this continues the trend 
of increasing dividends in each of the last 19 years.
The Group had a further year of strong growth with 
underlying diluted earnings per share increasing by 
19% on the previous year. Sustained organic growth 
represented 85% of the 13% increase in underlying 
operating profi t to £46.6m. All four divisions produced 
signifi cant contributions with underlying profi t growth in 
Marine Support (13% adjusted for prior year disposal), 
Specialist Technical (55%), Offshore Oil (15%) and 
Tankships (33%). Operating margins increased in 
Specialist Technical and Tankships and were in line with 
prior year in Offshore Oil and Marine Support (adjusted 
for The Railway Engineering Company (TRE) which was 
sold in 2012).
Since 2002, the Group has established and grown 
its Marine Services businesses (Marine Support, 
Specialist Technical and Offshore Oil) and revenues 
have increased by a compound rate of 19% over the 
last fi ve years to £352.4m in 2013. In continuation of 
this strategy, the Group divested the non-core TRE 
in December 2012 for £25.5m and reinvested the 
proceeds with the acquisition of Divex in March for an 
initial consideration of £20.8m.
Divex is a global leader in the design and supply 
of saturation diving systems and related diving 
equipment to the defence and oil and gas markets. It

Financial statements Governance Strategic report
is complementary to our submarine rescue business, 
JF Defence, and joins the Group at an interesting time 
with high activity levels in the subsea market and good 
prospects for new orders of saturation diving systems.
In August 2013, Osiris Marine Services Limited and 
Osiris Underwater Engineering Limited (together Osiris 
Marine) were acquired for an initial consideration of 
£3.3m. Osiris Marine provides diving and subsea 
services, principally to the renewables sector in the UK.
At the same time, we announced the sale of our 25% 
shareholding in Foreland Holdings Limited (Foreland). 
James Fisher and Sons plc was one of the four original 
investors in Foreland, a Private Finance Initiative to own 
and operate six roll-on, roll-off vessels for the Ministry 
of Defence. The disposal realised £11.4m of proceeds 
and resulted in a profit of £6.8m in the year. Further 
proceeds conditional on the sale of two vessels may be 
received in 2014. Whilst a successful investment for the 
Group, the Board decided that Foreland’s contract did 
not have significant growth prospects. The proceeds 
will be used to finance further bolt-on acquisitions and 
to drive further organic growth.
During the year, the Group opened several new bases 
and early in 2014 will commence operations from 
Labuan, Malaysia. Our Scantech Offshore business 
became established in Brazil and won two significant 
well testing orders from major multinational customers, 
one of which has contributed strongly to the 2013 result. 
The Group invested £24.7m (2012: £26.1m) in capital 
expenditure of which the majority was spent within 
our Offshore Oil division in new high specification 
equipment. Our JF Nuclear business created a new 
digital radiography facility at Deeside, UK and we 
recently invested in a new facility in Inchinnin, near 
Glasgow, UK where operations for JF Defence and 
Divex will be based. Our Nuclear business successfully 
implemented a new business information system across 
its six sites.
A recent strategic development has been to seek 
marine service contracts in the operations and 
maintenance sector of the European renewables 
market. In support of strategic bases and diving 
services within Fendercare and Strainstall Marine’s 
structural stress monitoring services, we acquired Osiris 
Marine which broadens our offering to this sector.
In providing solutions to our customers, an important 
part of our strategy is to develop new innovative 
products. Our safety product, the Weak Link Bail is 
being delivered to customers outside of the Norwegian 
market for the first time in 2014 and the award winning 
PyroSentry product proved successful in 2013. Our JF 
Nuclear business has largely completed development 
and testing of the robotic manipulator, Moduman, and 
within Offshore Oil, we launched the Switch which 
facilitates the operation of multiple down-hole devices 
from a single power source. 
CALM Buoy refurbishment 
In 2013, Fendercare completed a 
significant contract for Chevron Nigeria to 
refurbish and re-commission a catenary 
anchor leg mooring (CALM) buoy as part 
of the Escravos Gas to Liquids Project. 
A CALM consists of a floating buoy 
anchored to the seabed by catenary 
chain legs which are secured to anchors 
or piles. Fluid product is transferred via 
the CALM to or from a tanker by floating 
and subsea hose systems. 
Fendercare’s scope of work included 
inspection of all hydraulic and electrical 
systems, determining the buoy’s water 
tight integrity and the refurbishment of 
all lifting points and lifting equipment.  
Fendercare successfully re-commissioned 
the CALM Buoy following refurbishment. 8

Performance against KPI’s
Underlying operating profit (£m)
Cash conversion (%)
Operating margin (%)
Return on operating capital employed (%)
Gearing (%)
Underlying profit before tax (£m)
Underlying operating profit is after adjusting for 
separately disclosed items and is the profit from 
operations before interest. The Group has increased 
underlying profit by a compound rate of 9% over the 
last five years.
Cash conversion is defined as the ratio of operating 
cash flow to underlying operating profit. Operating cash 
flow is defined as underlying operating profit, adding 
back depreciation and amortisation and adjusting for 
net movements in working capital, pension payments 
and for the cash profits of associates. The Group’s 
cash conversion was 131% in 2013 (2012: 132%).
Operating margin is the ratio of underlying operating 
profit to revenue. The Group’s operating margin in 
2013 was 11.3% (2012: 11.3%). The Group’s margin 
has ranged between 11.3% and 12.1% over the last 
five years and is partly dependent on the amount of 
third party content or pass through revenue.
Return on operating capital employed is defined 
as underlying operating profit divided by average 
operating capital employed. Operating capital employed 
comprises tangible fixed assets, intangible fixed assets, 
operating debtors net of creditors, less provisions. The 
Group’s post tax return on operating capital employed 
was 16.9% (2012: 15.3%) at 31 December 2013.
Gearing is defined as the ratio of net borrowings 
to net assets. The gearing of the Group at 31 
December 2013 was 30% (2012: 39%) and 
compares to 93% at the end of 2009.
Underlying profit before taxation is after interest and 
before separately disclosed items and taxes. The 
compound annual growth rate in underlying profit 
before taxation over the last five years is 12%.

Business reviews
• Underlying revenue growth of 14%
•  Ship to ship transfer produced further organic 
growth
• First LNG ship to ship operations completed
•  West African contract for mooring buoy 
refurbishment completed
•  Acquisition of Subsea Vision and Osiris Marine for 
£5.8m
• Further contract wins in UK renewables
Marine Support produced a good financial performance 
with underlying revenue growth of 14% and operating profit 
increasing by 13% after adjusting for TRE, the business sold 
in 2012. Overall margins adjusted for TRE, were maintained 
in 2013 after reducing by around three percentage points 
in 2012, when we commenced a large contract in Angola 
which had a high proportion of third party content.
Ship to ship transfer services achieved further organic 
growth with South-East Asia performing well and we 
completed our first Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) transfer 
in 2013. Operations in the West African market increased 
profits through contracts to install and refurbish mooring 
equipment and Fendercare continued to expand its 
network of bases around the world, recently opening a 
new facility in Sharjah, Dubai.
The acquisition of Subsea Vision Limited for £2.5m was 
completed in January 2014. Subsea Vision is an operator 
of niche remotely operated vehicles (ROV) used in the 
support of floating production, storage and offloading 
(FPSO) in the oil and gas market. 
Osiris Marine was acquired in August 2013 for a 
consideration of £3.3m. Osiris Marine provides diving and 
subsea services both to the renewables and oil and gas 
sectors in the UK. This broadens the range of support 
services to the renewables market which is developing.
Structural monitoring services also produced organic 
growth both in the UK, South-East Asia and the Middle 
East, where the market is showing signs of recovery.

•  Divex completed a major saturation diving project and 
made strong contribution since acquisition in March
• Orders for two further saturation diving systems
•  Joint project assembly base established in 
Glasgow, UK
• Australia – integrating contracts with the navy 
• Exceptional profit of £6.8m on sale of Foreland 
• Healthy order book at JF Nuclear
The Specialist Technical division produced a strong 
set of results with revenue increasing by a third and 
after adjusting for Foreland, underlying operating profit 
nearly doubled. This reflects the contribution from Divex, 
the global market leader in the design and delivery of 
saturation diving systems. During 2013 it completed a 
system that will ultimately be used by the Russian Navy. 
It also received orders for two further systems which will 
be completed over the next two years. The introduction 
of Divex into the Group has gone smoothly and the 
integration of the operations in Australia, Singapore and 
Scotland is underway.
JF Defence, which had a shortage of project work in 
the first half after completing the refurbishment of the 
Swedish submarine rescue vehicle in 2012, produced an 
improved order book in the second half of 2013, including 
securing funding for the next stage of development of the 
Swimmer Delivery Vehicle. In December it also completed 
a large exercise off Sydney in Australia (Black Carillon) 
which boosted second half financial performance.  
Our Nuclear business produced another solid 
performance. Whilst there was no significant increase in 
profit, the prior year included the benefit of the one-off 
Olympics contract in 2012 and the financial performance 
in 2013 illustrates the underlying organic growth from 
the nuclear power sector. The customer base has been 
further extended during the year with contract wins from 
Dounreay and the Atomic Weapons Authority (AWE).

Chief Executive’s review
•  Steersman and Asperity vessels sold, reducing 
fl eet size
•  Milford Fisher chartered out to Mediterranean 
market
• King Fisher and Kestrel Fisher introduced
• MoD charters for 2 vessels
Tankships produced an improved result with underlying 
profi ts increasing by 33% to £3.2m whilst revenue declined 
marginally. This was in line with the policy to reduce 
capacity and improve the yield. During the year the fl eet 
was reduced by a further 2 vessels with m.v. Steersman 
sold on behalf of its owners in January, and m.v. Asperity 
sold in December. In addition a further vessel, m.v. Milford 
Fisher, was chartered out to the Mediterranean market. 
The results benefi ted from the charter of two vessels to the 
Ministry of Defence, which entailed replacement vessels 
being chartered in to cover our contract commitments.
The demand for clean petroleum products, whilst 
not recovering to 2007 levels, remains stable. The 
fl eet has now been reduced to refl ect the level of 
contract demand with the exposure to the spot market 
signifi cantly reduced.  
•  Strong organic growth – revenue up 19%, profi ts 
up 15%
•  Contract wins for Zone 2 equipment in Africa 
and South America
• One-off profi t on well testing order in Brazil
• New product developments coming to market
The Offshore Oil division had an excellent year with revenue 
increasing by 19% and underlying operating profi t by 15%. 
The market, both in the North Sea and in the developing 
markets off West Africa and South America, continued 
to be very active, particularly in the subsea sector. The 
strong performance was in part driven by the demand for 
our designs of Zone 2 and Norsok (Norwegian standard) 
equipment. This led to signifi cant contracts being won 
for major international oil and gas suppliers for well testing, 
both in Brazil and Africa, which were partially completed in 
2013.
Capital expenditure of £14.8m was invested into new 
equipment during the year and will drive further organic 
growth. The majority of this is targeted at long term rental 
contracts in Asia, Africa and South America.
We continued to invest in new product development 
which provides solutions to our customers or improved 
health and safety. The Switch was exhibited at a major 
industry workshop in Houston, US in May 2013. This 
facilitates operating a number of down-hole devices 
from a single power source from the surface. In addition, 
new products were developed at Scantech AS, our 
Norwegian business and at Scantech Offshore which 
provides well testing related services.

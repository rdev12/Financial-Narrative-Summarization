*   All references in this report to net earnings and underlying earnings relate to profit attributable to equity 
shareholders of Rio Tinto. Underlying earnings is defined below and is reconciled to net earnings on page 182.

Notes to pages 2 and 3
(a)  The accounting information in these charts is based on EU IFRS accounting information.
(b)  Underlying earnings is the key financial performance indicator which management uses internally to assess 
performance. It is presented here as an additional measure of earnings to provide greater understanding of 
the underlying business performance of the Group’s operations. Items excluded from net earnings to arrive at 
underlying earnings are explained in note 2 to the 2010 financial statements. Both net earnings and underlying 
earnings deal with amounts attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. However, EU IFRS requires that the profit for the 
year reported in the income statement should also include earnings attributable to non-controlling interests  
in subsidiaries.

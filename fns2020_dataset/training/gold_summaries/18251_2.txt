Dairy Crest has the leading cheese brand 
in the UK, Cathedral City, and a world-
class cheese supply chain. Cathedral City 
is made at our Davidstow creamery in 
Cornwall from milk supplied by local dairy 
farmers. The cheese is matured, cut and 
wrapped at our purpose-built facility in 
Nuneaton from where it is despatched to 
retailers. 
 We also have a smaller cheese 
packing facility at Frome, Somerset which 
provides the business with additional 
flexibility. We currently dry the whey that 
is produced as a by-product of cheese 
making at Davidstow. 
 We are developing a new facility that 
will manufacture demineralised whey 
powder and galacto-oligosaccharide, a 
lactose based prebiotic.

Dairy Crest produces some of the UK’s 
leading spreads and butter brands. We 
focus on two key brands Clover and 
Country Life.
 We also manufacture and sell Frylight 
one calorie cooking spray.
 During the year we have consolidated 
the production of spreads and packet 
butters at Kirkby, Merseyside.
We process and deliver fresh conventional, 
organic and flavoured milk to major 
retailers, ‘middle ground’ customers 
including smaller retailers, coffee shops 
and hospitals, and residential customers.
 We also manufacture and sell FRijj, the 
leading fresh flavoured milk brand, cream 
and milk powders. 
 Dairies also benefit from property profits 
arising from the sale of surplus depots. 
On 6 November 2014 Dairy Crest 
agreed to sell its Dairies operations 
to Muller UK and Ireland Group 
LLP for £80 million in cash on 
completion. The sale has been 
approved by shareholders 
but remains conditional on 
the approval of the relevant 
competition authorities.
 Details of the sale are included 
in the Financial review on page 29.

improved to

Ongoing investment in IT systems will

The average cost of borrowing was 
6.86% (2006: 6.79%) due to our proactive
hedging strategy that aims to provide
stable medium-term funding costs to
match the maturities of our liabilities.
Group year-end gearing improved to 
4.6 times shareholders’ funds (2006: 
5.1 times), and is well within our covenant
of 6.0 times.
The Group raised £533 million from a
share placing and bond issue, and agreed 
a further £150 million unsecured bilateral
bank facility in December.
Year-end funding headroom was 
£226.0 million (2006: £348.5 million), 
with the only facility maturing in 2008
being a US $40 million private placing
(2007: £125 million). The £150 million
bilateral facility we announced in
December 2007 has recently been
increased to £250 million. We are
confident that we will be able to raise 
debt funding to support our planned
growth while maintaining a highly
attractive net interest margin.

‘I am pleased to report another year of strong profit growth
for the Cattles Group. Our pre-tax profits have increased 
by 24.9% underpinned by strong income growth of 32.7%.
Critically, this has been achieved without compromising
credit quality: instalment arrears improved to 7.0% of
receivables.
Extensive experience in our markets enables us to continue
lending responsibly, taking full account of customers’
ability to repay . So, as many lenders withdraw from these
markets, we remain committed to meeting the needs of
customers, as evidenced by continuing investment in our
branch network, systems and people.’

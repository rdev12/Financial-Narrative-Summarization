Overview of performance
I am delighted to be able to report on a year of first class performance by the 
Group. In June we delivered, in 11 weeks from a standing start, the Admission of 
the Company to the Premium Listing segment of the Official List. Subsequent to 
the Group’s Admission to the London Stock Exchange, we have gone on to deliver 
all that was expected of the Group at the time of listing. 
The core of FDM’s business is its Mountie model and the growth in headcount and 
revenue has been excellent. For the year to 31 December 2014 we saw Mountie 
revenues of £88.9 million, an increase of 20% over the previous year (2013: £73.8 
million). Mounties placed on site at 31 December 2014 stood at 1,539, an increase 
of 377 on the prior year. Mountie utilisation, a key measure of efficiency, for the 
year to 31 December 2014 was 98.4%, an improvement on the 2013 utilisation rate 
of 97.6%.
Total revenues for the year to 31 December 2014 grew by 17% to £123.3 million (2013: £105.6 million) which in  
turn produced an operating profit before exceptional items of £24.9 million an increase of 10% on the previous year  
(2013: £22.6 million). The Group operating profit after exceptional items for the same period was £19.5 million  
(2013: £20.9 million). Exceptional administrative expenses, totalling £5.4 million, principally relating to costs of Admission, 
have been adjusted where appropriate to present the underlying trading of the business.
Basic and fully diluted earnings per share before exceptional items for the year to 31 December 2014 were 17.5 pence per 
share (2013: 15.4 pence). Basic and fully diluted earnings per share after exceptional items for the year to 31 December 
2014 were 12.7 pence per share (2013: 14.1 pence).
At 31 December 2014 the Group had net cash of £12.3 million (2013: net debt of £9.0 million) and during the year repaid 
£15.0 million of borrowings with £12.0 million from cash generated from operations and £3.0 million of cash raised from 
the Initial Public Offering. The Group had no borrowings at 31 December 2014.
People
I would like to thank all of our employees and other stakeholders for their hard work and dedication over the past year. 
FDM is a people business and the expertise and commitment of our people enables us to drive the business forward and 
helps to underpin our strong reputation with our customers.
The Board
Upon Admission the Group welcomed three new Non-Executive Directors to the Board. Peter Whiting, Jonathan Brooks 
and Robin Taylor bring many years of relevant and valuable experience to the team. Our Inflexion colleagues John Hartz 
and Richard Swann resigned just prior to Admission; we thank them for their contribution to the Group during their 
period of stewardship.
Dividend
The Board believes in a progressive dividend policy for the Company which will seek to maximise shareholder value 
and returns and reflect the strength of earnings and cash flows generated by the Group. It is the Directors’ intention to 
declare an interim dividend of 7.5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the period from Admission on 20 June 2014 
to 31 December 2014. The proposed interim dividend is subject to final Board approval at a meeting of the Board to be  
held on 30 April 2015.

Outlook
2014 was a year of significant progress from a corporate perspective for the Group with Admission in June and 
operationally on a number of fronts with new office openings, new service offerings, record numbers of Mounties on site 
and the launch of the UK’s ex-Forces initiative.
I am delighted that 2015 has started strongly for the Group with headcount growth in front of our expectations and good 
operating performances being recorded in each of our geographies. It is very encouraging to note that our UK business, 
by far the largest element of the Group, has seen strong and growing demand from late 2014 continue into 2015. Equally 
I am very pleased to note that our North American operations in New York and Toronto have seen an excellent start to 
2015 with Mountie headcount ahead of our expectations.
With the breadth and depth of our offering enhanced and good momentum from strong current trading, I am confident 
that the Group will deliver another year of good progress in 2015.

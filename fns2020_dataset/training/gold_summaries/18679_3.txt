Your company has produced record results with  
pre-tax profits of £101.7m, being the highest since  
it became a property company in 1984, 30 years  
ago. The total unleveraged return of its property  
portfolio, as measured by iPD, was 23.8%,  
compared to the iPD Universe of march valued  
funds of 13.4%.
Total property return increased by 290% to £140.1m (2013: £35.9m) and 
included continued growing rents of £29.8m (up 21.6% on 2013) and 
development profits of £65.0m (2013: £7 .0m), a remarkable increase of 
828%! Diluted EPRA net asset value per share increased by 18.6% to 313p 
(2013: 264p). Total Shareholder Return for the year to 31 March 2014 was 
61.1%, compared to returns of companies in the FTSE 350 Real Estate 
Super Sector Return Index of 27 .4% and for the wider UK Equity Market as 
a whole of 8.8%. These record results allow the Board to continue its 
progressive dividend policy and to recommend to shareholders a final 
dividend of 4.75p, an increase of 28% on 2013 (3.70p), taking the total for 
the year to 6.75p, an overall increase of 22% (2013: 5.55p).
This year’s results reflect the culmination of many years’ work on two very 
profitable schemes on which helical acted as development manager. Details 
of the projects at White City, London W12 and 200 Aldersgate, London EC1 
are set out later in this report but together they contributed £61.0m (2013: 
£1.0m) of the £65.0m development profit made by the Group during the 
year. Our decision to invest in the regions for income and in London for 
capital growth continues to create shareholder value with see-through net 
rents of £29.8m and gains on sale or revaluation of the investment portfolio 
of £45.0m, including an 18.6% valuation increase on our London assets. We 
now have an investment portfolio of over £600m of which 43% is in London 
and the remaining 57% in regional assets mainly, but not solely, held for 
income generation.

The expansion of the Company’s activities by investing in London and the 
regions was financed by the proceeds of an £80m Retail Bond issued in 
June 2013, and bank facilities provided by our banking partners. Our 
business model is predicated on the basis that we are able to read and 
understand the real estate cycle. We use gearing on a tactical basis, being 
raised to accentuate property performance when property returns are judged 
to outperform materially the cost of debt. however, we remain nimble enough 
to reduce our exposure to the cycle at the appropriate time. Our medium to 
long term target for our loan to value, the ratio of net borrowings to the value 
of property, is 50% and at 31 March 2014 this ratio was 46% (2013: 46%).
The Group is well positioned to face the future with a sound financial base, 
having increased its income stream by replacing low growth assets with 
higher yielding retail properties, refinancing maturing debt with longer term 
bank facilities and reducing its exposure to any future interest rate rises by 
entering into hedging instruments, taking advantage of low interest rates. In 
addition, and with the backing of the major property lending banks, the Group 
has access to a number of new bank facilities which, when added to its cash 
balances, provides a level of liquidity and resources that enable it to continue 
to rebalance its portfolio. We believe that there are further opportunities in 
today’s real estate market to add to the portfolio, boosting income returns 
and the potential for capital gains.
In my statement in May 2013 I noted that I believed we were on the cusp of 
returning to delivering outperformance. These results are the vindication of 
that belief. Looking forward, our London development schemes at The 
Bower, Old Street, Barts Square, Maple house, Clifton Street, Creechurch 
Place and hammersmith Town hall provide comfort that, in the absence of a 
major economic downturn, and with an investment portfolio providing 
growing income and capital surpluses, the Company is well placed to 
continue to deliver outperformance and ongoing value for shareholders.

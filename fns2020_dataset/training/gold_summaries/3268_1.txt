 Chief Executive’s Review
For the year ahead the
focus is to improve net
margins....
”
2004/05 was a year of strong
recovery, with turnover increasing
to £42.0m (2004: £27.3m). The
major factor was the acquisition 
of Russell Castings, although
improved demand and higher
prices in our existing foundry
businesses were also factors. The
benefits of this growth in sales
were, in part, mitigated by the
substantial price increases in new
production steel, ferrous scrap, pig
iron, energy and ferro-alloys and
the time lag in the recovery of these
increases through higher selling
prices. Not surprisingly many
customers have found this situation
equally difficult with protracted
negotiations and tough decisions
having to be faced. Without doubt,
the improvement in net operating
margins to 4.9% (2004: 3.7%)
would have been higher but for
these circumstances.
Foundries
Foundry turnover reached £34.0m
(2004: £19.0m) including turnover
at Russell Castings of £11.2m, and
foundry operating profits reached
£1.82m (2004: £0.83m), with
Russell Castings contributing
£0.78m, before exceptionals and
the release of negative goodwill.
Our decision not to move Russell
Castings immediately from its
Leicester site led to a restructuring
of our castings business. Walsall
and Bloxwich foundries were
merged to form the Light Castings
Division, while Russell combined
with Ductile Castings to form the
Heavy Castings Division.
Several factors influenced
performance levels within the
foundries in different ways:
Within the Light Castings Division,
at Walsall the integration of work
won following the closure of a
competitor, Henley Foundry, early
in 2004 raised output levels, which
after the initial learning curve
improved profitability. Walsall also
enjoyed increased demand from its
automotive customer base with
castings for hydraulic applications.
In particular the growth in demand
for turbo-charged diesel engines
has and will continue to provide
growth opportunities. The foundry
saw a significant recovery in
operating profit for the year as 
a result.
A rather different picture emerged
at Bloxwich following a decision 
by its largest customer, George
Fischer, to relocate production of
malleable fittings to Central Europe,
but the new integrated structure
enabled a rebalancing of capacity
within the Light Castings Division
so that while losses were incurred
at Bloxwich in the first half of the
year, the business was stabilised
and made a profit in the second.
Currently we are pursuing a
number of significant business

“ opportunities in this division led 
by Adam Vicary as divisional
Managing Director.
The Heavy Division saw an
excellent performance from Russell
Castings as turnover benefited from
increased demand and the closure
of other foundries. Turnover
recovered to levels not seen since
2000/2001. At Ductile Castings,
despite an increase in turnover,
margins fell a little as under-
recovery of material cost increases
took its toll, resulting in 
a standstill year. Chris Binmore,
Managing Director of Russell
Castings, is now Divisional MD
under whose leadership we are
integrating and developing these
two businesses.
For the year ahead the focus is 
to improve net margins and to
consolidate our preparations for
rationalisation as and when market
conditions are favourable. We 
will be seeking to maximise the
cross selling opportunities created
by the acquisition of Russell, the
potential of which is already 
being developed.
Engineering
Turnover in the engineering 
division fell slightly in the year 
to £8.0m (2004: £8.3m) as we
sought to grow attractive niches
while accepting the inevitable
decline in commodity products 
as customers moved to off-shore
sourcing. Despite this, higher
margins led to slightly increased
operating profits for the division
overall.
At PFP Electrical Products 
we concentrated on further
development of “EX” certified
lighting for use in hazardous areas
following an expansion in the
product range, and a new sales and
marketing director has been
appointed. Our objective now is 
to expand sales both for existing
products and through further
broadening of the range that we
offer within this specialised area.
PFP enjoyed increased operating
profit in the year and was ahead 
of its budget. 
A new operations director was
appointed at Fred Duncombe, our
door fittings and security company,
to reduce cost of manufacture and
to review sourcing opportunities.
The new product development
programme has been rigorous with
exciting extensions to the EXIDOR
Slimline and Security ranges of
emergency exit fittings. Further
new products in the Webb Lloyd
range of high quality door handles
will be launched in the summer.
Although 2004/05 has been a year
of high activity, overall sales and
operating profit both declined
slightly on the previous year as a
result of the continued expected
decline in the traditional hardware
element of the business. We seek a
reversal of the overall trend this
year as a result of the foundations
laid down.
The Future
The year just ended has been one
of consolidation following the
acquisition of Russell and of
planting seed corn for the future.
Our aim is to capitalise on these
actions by improving net margins,
while investment plans include the
provision of capacity for the longer
term integration of foundry
activities. We will also continue to
seek growth through manageable
and strategically driven business
acquisition opportunities. 
Our greatest investment remains in
our people. Combining with Russell
Castings has strengthened our
management capability and we will
continue to recruit the best possible
skills to add to an already excellent
team. I would like to thank all our
employees for their continued
support. We look forward together
to further progress in the year
ahead.

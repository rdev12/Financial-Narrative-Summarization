Chief Executive’s Report
government, moving Idox to a 46% market 
share in that vertical. Today, the Group offers a 
compelling case to local government to be more 
efficient by standardising around one integrated 
property based platform.
In the engineering document management and 
control sector, McLaren Software has undergone 
a year of change. The division’s focus on core 
markets and on delivering solutions and domain 
expertise have resulted in a 27% year on year 
increase in revenue. This includes significant big 
customer wins with blue chip companies like 
Chevron, Arcelor Mittal and Queensland Gas.
In addition, McLaren has concluded an OEM 
agreement with Documentum Inc., further 
supporting the platform as a strategically 
important partner. The business also continues 
to build stronger value added partnerships as 
the domain expert with IBM and Accenture.
The Solutions division was impacted by 
procurement delays and reductions in project 
work resulting in minimal revenue growth, but 
managed to maintain subscription revenues 
in the core grants business.  The acquisition 
of Interactive Dialogues, an e-learning and 
certification software business, has added rich 
content for the legal market, a blue chip private 
sector customer base and the capability to 
deliver on-line grants training solutions for the 
core business.  It has also provided a flexible 
platform for other divisions in the Group to meet 
the needs of both local and global customer 
bases.
The Public Sector software business market 
faced an unsettled start to the year, with 
the implementation of the new public sector 
spending round. This meant that decision 
cycles lengthened amid the prevailing economic 
uncertainty. This has now passed and there 
is greater clarity on the solutions required and 
budgets available. 
Independent market research company, Kable, 
is forecasting modest growth in the local 
government software & services market for the 
next three years. Idox’s Public Sector software 
business reported like-for-like growth in orders 
of 14% in the financial year as a result of the 
introduction of new services and an increased 
market share.
Idox has actively developed its management 
and technical capabilities in managed service 
or “zero infrastructure” provision for its public 
sector clients. By the end of 2011, Idox had 
consolidated its market leading position serving 
over 90% of UK local authorities. It also achieved 
a ten-fold increase in managed service sales 
over the previous year leading to a further 
strengthening of its local authority recurring 
revenues, which grew by 15% to £17.2m.
The introduction of a fully hosted resilient 
capability resulted in the business signing and 
delivering four fully-managed offsite solutions 
- with Westminster, Uttlesford, South Downs 
National Park and Buckinghamshire County 
Council – which have a total value of £3.5m.  
This shift towards managed services provision 
means that while the Public Sector software 
business has seen a double-digit increase in 
sales in the period, reported revenue growth 
has been marginal. However, with most of these 
deals running from three to five years, recurring 
revenues have increased to 66% from 62% the 
previous year.
In September 2011 the Group launched the 
Consultee Cloud, a product that allows all 
planning process stakeholders to complete both 
internal and external consultations online. In the 
three months since launch it has signed up in 
excess of 10% of all local authorities as well as 
the large consultee organisations. 
The acquisition of LalPac strengthened 
the Group’s position in the licensing and 
environmental health vertical of local

Divisional analysis: Revenue Mix Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 7
The Recruitment business saw strong growth 
in specialist permanent recruitment revenues. 
The market for contract recruitment remained 
soft, further hindered by changes in employment 
law which is moving more clients to direct 
engagement. The recruitment business overall 
showed a strong return to profitability, with 
revenues up 3% and gross profit rising 27%.
Outlook 
The Group has started the current financial 
year with a very strong order pipeline across all 
businesses. The shift in focus toward long term 
relationships and recurring revenues in its Public 
Sector software market may marginally impact 
top line revenues in this business with a move 
away from pure licence based sales. 
The acquisition of McLaren Software and 
CTSpace has enabled the Group to extend its 
core technology skills into the private sector 
on a global scale, providing access to verticals 
including pharmaceuticals and oil and gas.
In 2012, Idox will streamline its development 
activities to ensure that each initiative has broad 
applicability across all divisions. This strategic 
initiative in development may result in a small 
increase in capitalised development costs in the 
year. 
Whilst the economic climate remains 
challenging, the Group continues to reinforce its 
position as the centre of excellence in its chosen 
domains. The Board is confident that its strategy 
of diversification of revenue streams both 
operationally and geographically will enhance 
the Group’s resilience to current macroeconomic 
challenges and enable it to report good organic 
growth this year.  Trading in the current year has 
started in line with the Board’s expectations.

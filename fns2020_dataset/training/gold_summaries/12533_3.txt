Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT //
The quality of our producing assets, underpinned by our
financial position, secures our forward cash flows and
allows us to progress our exploration and development
programmes that could bring very significant upside.
Financial and operating performance
Strong oil and gas prices, notably in the first half of the year, generated sales revenues of
US$655.2 million in 2008 (2007: US$578.2 million) supported by high levels of demand from
our gas customers in Singapore and Pakistan. Average production for the year rose 2 per
cent to 36,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) (2007: 35,750 boepd) with good
production performance across our fields in the UK, Pakistan and Indonesia.
Operating cash flow after tax was US$352.3 million (2007: US$269.5 million), more than
sufficient to fund our investments in exploration and development projects during the year
and repay our bank borrowings. As a result our cash resources at 31 December 2008 were
US$323.7 million (2007: US$332.0 million) and our cash facilities undrawn at US$275.0 million
(2007: US$222.0 million). Operating profit rose for the fourth year running to US$261.7 million
(2007: US$219.4 million). Profit before tax for the year was US$277.6 million, an 89 per cent
increase on the previous year (2007: US$147.0 million), resulting in a 152 per cent increase
in profit after tax to US$98.3 million (2007: US$39.0 million).
Oil and gas proven and probable booked reserves increased to 228 million barrels of oil
equivalent (mmboe) (2007: 212 mmboe). Contingent resources, representing potential
reserves not yet booked, are 154 mmboe, so that total reserves and resources have
increased in the year by 3 per cent to 382 mmboe. Significant reserve additions included
the booking of reserves from the Chim Sáo oil and gas field in Vietnam and an increase in
our Indonesian Anoa field reserves of around 60 billion cubic feet (bcf), net to Premier,
following strong production performance.
Considerable progress was made in advancing our three major development project
approvals in the second half of 2008. Our project teams in Indonesia and Vietnam are now
intensively engaged in the execution phase of these development plans. Together these
three development projects are expected to add 25,000 boepd of production to Premier
over the next two to three years.

“Considerable progress was made in advancing
our three major development project approvals
in the second half of 2008. Together these three
development projects are expected to add
25,000 boepd of production to Premier over
the next two to three years.”
Our exploration programme in 2008 delivered seven successes from 14 exploration and appraisal
wells. Notable successes included appraisal wells on Chim Sáo in Vietnam and on the Banda gas
field in Mauritania. There have also been a series of successful wells on the NW Gemsa permit in
Egypt, where first production of oil commenced during February.
In 2009, we will return to our programmes in Vietnam and Indonesia, drill our first wells in Norway
and Congo and continue to exploit our existing acreage in Pakistan and Egypt.
Our efforts to maintain the highest levels of health, safety and environmental performance standards
have been successful and have seen us exceed expectations in several areas. Judged across a
range of industry accepted metrics, Premier’s 2008 operations recorded our best safety performance
to date, received an HSE Award from Petro Vietnam for operational excellence in Vietnam and had
our environmental compliance performance rating upgraded to ‘Green’ by the Ministry of the
Environment for its operations in Indonesia. We continue our drive for continuous performance
improvement in these areas.
Shareholder returns
In the face of falling stock markets and the sharp decline in the price of oil, Premier's share price
dropped by 25 per cent in 2008, nevertheless outperforming the price of Brent which fell 64 per
cent from US$97 per barrel (bbl) at the beginning of the year to end the year at US$35/bbl. We
continued with our policy of selectively utilising cash resources to buy-back shares where justified
on valuation grounds and where this has a favourable impact on market valuation. During the
second half of the year we acquired a total of 2.8 million shares at an average cost of £9.04 per
share. Over the five year period to 31 December 2008, Premier shares increased in value by
116 per cent.
Outlook
Despite volatile markets and the sharp downturn in economic activity, the group is in a strong
position to maintain its growth profile. Already in 2009 we have progressed a number of critical
contracts which are now at the centre of our development projects. We are about to embark on an
extensive exploration and appraisal campaign, which has the potential to have a material impact on
the group.
The quality of our producing assets, underpinned by our financial position, secures our forward
cash flows and allows us to progress our exploration and development programmes that could
bring very significant upside.

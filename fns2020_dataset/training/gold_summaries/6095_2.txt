 Floors 2 Go is the largest specialist, multi-site retailer of real
wood, engineered and laminate flooring, and related accessories
in the UK. The business sells direct to the public from 125 stores
located nationwide.
Floors 2 Go sells predominantly to the general public, but also
has a large base of trade customers. The Company has built its
reputation through a combination of their broad product range,
convenient store locations, and specialist staff knowledge. 
The product ranges of Floors 2 Go are mainly own label brands,
although they do stock selected branded products too, such as
Quick Step and Bruce flooring. Their laminate ranges are all easy
to fit click products, targeted at the home DIY market.
Floors 2 Go source the majority of their laminate products from
three of Europe’s leading manufacturers, and their real wood
flooring is primarily sourced from the Far East.
Floors 2 Go buy directly from manufacturers, rather than through
distributors, and the Company believes that this relationship with
their suppliers offers them a significant competitive advantage.
Two of their main suppliers hold Floors 2 Go labelled stock in
warehouses in the UK at no extra cost to the Company.

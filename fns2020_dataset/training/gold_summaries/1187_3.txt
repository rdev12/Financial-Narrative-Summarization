 04 Arena Leisure Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
In my rst year as Chairman, I am pleased to be able to report 
growth in the underlying performance of our racecourse 
operations. We have outperformed the market in growth in 
average attendances, opened a new hotel, made signi cant 
progress on our Folkestone Racecourse development plan, 
continued the success of our catering operation and At The 
Races ( ATR’) has taken a ma or step forward in its pro t 
contribution. From 2012, the new media rights agreement 
with Satellite Information Services Ltd (‘SIS’) will increase 
income from media rights by an estimated £10.0m per 
annum and remains the obvious focus of the Group’s growth 
story. In addition, recent major capital investments, further 
operational improvements and an increased return from the 
distribution of international media rights through ATR will 
provide further sustainable growth. Following the year-end 
we announced our rst major external catering contract as 
provider of catering services at both the Eton Dorney and 
the Greenwich Park venues for the Olympic and Paralympic 
Games in 2012.
As a backdrop to Arena’s performance and prospects, 
the horseracing industry has recently experienced a major 
reduction in the level of funding received from the Levy on 
bookmakers which, when coupled with conditions in the UK 
economy, has exerted considerable nancial pressures on  
all of racing. The yield from the Levy is estimated to fall to 
£64.8m in 2010/11 as a result of the movement of internet 
and telephone betting ‘offshore’, the impact of overseas 
betting operators and betting exchanges. The Levy is 
fundamental to the support of horse racing in the UK and 
it is our belief that all parties should seek to maintain it in a 
modernised and restructured form. The recent determination 
by Government of the basis of the 2011/12 scheme to deliver 
a yield of £73.7m to £80.8m is encouraging in that it provides 
stability for funding at least at the current level. In the longer 
term, it will be important for the sustainability of the Levy for 
a future solution to encompass offshore operators and 
betting exchanges and their customers. 
The Group’s seven racecourses staged a total of 352 
 xtures in the year to 31 December 2010 (2009: 370) with 
the average attendance increasing by an industry-leading 
4.2% to 1,800 (2009: 1,727). Total attendance was 634,000 
(2009: 639,000) including 60,000 people (2009: 53,000) 
attending the Ladbrokes St Leger festival at Doncaster 
Racecourse. Hospitality attendance in 2010 increased 
by 17.1% to 45,200 (2009: 38,600) which is encouraging. 
The UK racing industry reported total attendance across 
all racecourses of 5.8 million, up from 5.7 million in 2009, 
with average attendances up by 3.4% (2009: 0.0%).

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
In October, Arena submitted its masterplan proposal for the 
redevelopment of Folkestone Racecourse to Shepway District 
Council (‘SDC’) as part of SDC’s process for drawing up its 
new Local Development Framework. The proposal is designed 
to safeguard the long-term future of Folkestone Racecourse 
and entails a complete rebuild of the Racecourse and the 
introduction of approximately 800 residential units. SDC is 
likely to report in the middle of 2011, after which there will  
be an examination-in-public, which is likely to conclude in 
Spring 2012.
On 1 March 2010, Arena’s 45.85% af liate, ATR, commenced 
its joint venture, GBI Racing, which provides a uni ed service 
for the international distribution of media rights from all UK 
and Irish racecourses. Cost savings from this combined 
operation, together with associated income growth and 
improved performance in ATR’s website and TV channel 
businesses, resulted in Arena’s share of ATR’s earnings 
increasing by 163% to £1.4m (2009: £0.5m). The royalty 
payments made directly to the Group’s racecourses by ATR 
under the terms of the media rights agreement increased 
by over 40% to £2.0m (2009: £1.4m).
The Board is pleased to announce that it is proposing 
a maintained nal dividend for 2010 of 0.38p per share  
(2009: 0.38p per share). In line with our stated policy, 
no interim dividend was paid during the year (2009: none).
I was appointed to the Board as Chairman on 19 May 2010. 
My predecessor, Raymond Mould, had been Chairman of 
Arena for four years, during which time the Group initiated 
its exciting real estate strategy, established a successful 
in-house catering function and secured a transformational 
agreement with SIS for the supply of media rights post-2011. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Raymond for 
his outstanding contribution to the development of Arena. 
There were no other changes to the Board during the year.
Since my appointment, I have come to appreciate even more 
the exceptional dedication and professionalism of Arena’s 
employees. In my opinion, they are second to none in their 
commitment to delivering an excellent product and service 
and I would like to convey the thanks of the Board to each  
of them.
Looking forward, 2011 will be another challenging year 
primarily as a result of the impact of the already announced 
reductions in Levy funding. As a result, our expectation is that 
Group pro tability is unlikely to see a material uplift from 
2010. I have highlighted the strengths of the Arena business 
and my belief is that the Group is extremely well placed to 
capitalise on future growth through media rights, operational 
performance and further estate development opportunities; 
2012 will be an exciting year in this respect.

For the full year, Arena’s adjusted pro t before interest and 
tax was £5.4m, an increase of 10.4% from £4.9m in 2009 
(before a £0.4m gain on asset disposals). Arena’s total 
revenue for 2010 was £64.0m, down £1.2m (2009: £65.2m) 
following a £3.8m reduction in funding from the Levy which 
predominantly impacted prize money in the year. Income from 
media rights provided into licensed betting of ces (‘LBOs’) 
was consistent at £11.6m (2009: £11.6m), despite fewer 
 xtures being staged. Non-racing income has grown and more 
than half of the growth was generated by the Ling eld Park 
Marriott Hotel, bringing the share of revenue from activities 
not directly related to horseracing to 11.9% (2009: 8.7%).
Pro t before tax was £3.6m (2009: £4.1m, including a £0.4m 
gain on asset disposals). Within this, the net nance expense 
was £1.8m (2009: £1.2m), the increase of £0.6m being due 
predominantly to the funding costs of the Ling eld Park 
Marriott Hotel development no longer being capitalised as 
part of the cost of construction following its opening in May. 
Basic earnings per share were 1.02p (2009: 1.16p), down 
12.1%, principally as a result of this increased nance cost.
The rst customers of the newly constructed Ling eld Park 
Marriott Hotel and Country Club were welcomed in mid-May.  
The hotel is the centrepiece of the £30.0m redevelopment of 
Ling eld Park that creates the UK’s rst integrated hotel, golf, 
leisure and racing complex. We are delighted with the physical 
product, service levels and overall quality of this addition 
to our portfolio and are excited by the prospects of this 
complementary asset, which we expect to reach maturity 
through 2012 and into 2013. Pre-opening costs in the year 
were £0.5m (2009: £0.2m), in-line with our expectations.

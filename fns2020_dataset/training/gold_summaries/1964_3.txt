 Chairman’s Statement
addressed the market changes in order to have a
soundly based build and sales programme for
future years.
We offer a range of incentives available to attract
sales and importantly a comprehensive product
range to address the density requirements of
Planning Consents and the needs of the first time
buyer. The features of the current market and
planning requirements have impacted on the
average selling price of dwellings which fell to
£150,466 from £154,650 in 2004. However, the
price per square foot of units sold rose by 3.0% in
the year.
I believe that a very significant factor in the year’s
achievements has been the increase in the number
of plots held for future development, which has
risen to 2,030 (2004: 1,770) with a further 1000
plots under contract. Whilst borrowings have had
to increase in pursuing this policy, these are
satisfactorily matched against the value of the land
held for development.
We have recruited additional skilled personnel into
our management team and I wish to thank all our
employees for their assistance and efforts during
the year.
Future Prospects
Whilst economic factors and movement in interest
rates will always play a role in our industry, your
Board feels that the increased critical mass of the
Company in terms of sites under development and
future land bank, place it in a strong position to
continue the momentum of its growth programme.
The increased flexibility afforded by the enlarged
land bank and product range give the Board
confidence in delivering satisfactory returns to
shareholders whilst maintaining the resource for
future growth.
Dividend
The Board will recommend a final dividend for
2005 of 10p per share, which together with the
interim dividend of 5p per share paid in September
2005, will make an unchanged total of 15p based
on the 2005 results.
Ordinary Shareholders on the register at the close
of business on 7 April 2006 will receive the final
dividend of 10p per ordinary share on 5 May 2006.
Results
I am pleased to report continued growth in the level
of our activities in terms of volume output of new
homes, turnover and increases in our land bank.
Inevitably, profitability declined in our sector as
the price inflation experienced over recent years
levelled out and increased build costs were
experienced.
T urnover increased by 26.6% to £103.2m from
£81.5m from the sale of 686 plots as against 527
in 2004.
Profit before taxation was £12.7m compared to
£16.4m in 2004, this result being partly influenced
by additional interest charges of £1.6m, incurred in
financing the strengthening of our future land
bank. At the operating level, margins declined to
15.6% from 22.3% and Operating Profits to
£16.1m from £18.2m.
As a result of the above, Earnings per Share fell by
24.8% to 75.2p (2004: 100.0p).
Review of Operations
As reported in my last Statement, national monetary
policy began to have a dampening effect on house
prices in the latter half of 2004. Additionally, there
followed a period of considerable uncertainty as
to the future direction of prices and thereby in
customer confidence. I am pleased to say that
price levels in our area appear to have stabilised
and that we have been able to achieve our projected
volumes and continue a policy of enhancement to
the land bank.
Profitability has declined from the unsustainable
levels of recent years but I feel that we have

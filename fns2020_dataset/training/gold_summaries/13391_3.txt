Rethink Group  Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 
The results for the year to 31 December 2013 
reflect the progress we have made in refocussing 
the Group towards the Talent Management 
division supported by the Recruitment division, 
whilst restoring profitability. 
Chairman’s statement
Introduction
We are encouraged by the 7.6% improvement in Group Net 
Fee Income (‘NFI’) driven by a 28.1% improvement in NFI 
within the Talent Management division. The overall financial 
improvement has allowed the Group to recommence investment 
in continuing operations.
This growth demonstrates the rationale and initial success of the 
Group’s refocussed strategy. As we continue to implement and 
execute against the new strategy we are confident of achieving 
a more sustainable earnings stream that will build over time 
and enhance the quality and predictability of future earnings.
Financial performance
Revenue for the year grew by 28.0% to £111.7m (2012: £87.3m), 
driven by growth in contractor numbers. NFI, which is a more 
meaningful measure of growth, increased to £19.6m (2012: 
£18.2m), and EBITDA increased to £1.6m (2012: £0.07m) after 
accounting for one-off separately identifiable restructuring costs 
of £0.6m (2012: separable items of £0.4m related to a one-off 
impairment to goodwill for Berkley Singapore in the period). 
Profits from operations were £1.4m (2012: losses £0.5m).
People
Our staff numbers increased to 196 by the year end (2012: 182). 
Rethink has a high quality base of talented and enthusiastic 
people who are central to the success of the Group and I would 
like to thank them for their continued efforts.
Board changes
During the year the Group has significantly strengthened the 
executive team.
Jon Butterfield, the Group’s CEO, and John Sadiq, the Group’s 
Non-executive Chairman, left the Group during 2013. They were 
replaced by Steve Wright and John O’Sullivan respectively. 
Steve, who had joined the Board as our Chief Financial Officer in 
March 2012, was appointed to the role of interim CEO in January 
2013. The appointment was made permanent with effect from 25 
June 2013. John O’Sullivan, a non-executive director with 
significant experience in the Talent Management and 
Recruitment sectors was appointed interim Non-executive 
Chairman on the departure of John Sadiq. His appointment 
was made permanent with effect from 7 April 2014.
In addition, Andrew Lord, Managing Director of the 
Recruitment division, was appointed Chief Operating Officer 
in January 2013.
On 11 November 2013, the Group successfully divested of Aiimi 
Limited (‘Aiimi’), a non-core technology services division, to 
management. Accordingly, Stephen Salvin, Executive Director of 
Rethink and Managing Director of Aiimi resigned from the 
Board on the same day. 
Post period, on 7 April 2014, Rethink was delighted to 
welcome Ben Felton to the Board as Chief Financial Officer. 
Ben is a Chartered Accountant and prior to joining Rethink 
was CFO of Norman Broadbent plc, an AIM-listed human capital 
consulting group.  03

Dividend
The Board is not recommending a dividend until the Group’s 
cash resources are further strengthened.
Outlook
2013 was a year of change which we successfully navigated. 
Though there is much work to do to deliver our revised strategy, 
the progress made so far is promising. NFI for both contract and 
permanent recruitment, together with profitability, is in line with 
management expectations following the investment in both the 
Talent Management and Recruitment divisions. With a firmer 
financial footing, Rethink is now building momentum towards 
realising its growth objectives.
The impact of technology on all markets is well understood and 
highly skilled and motivated people are a vital ingredient in our 
clients’ ability to execute against their own business plans.
Rethink will continue to work closely with clients by not only 
sourcing the best qualified candidates in a timely and flexible 
manner, but also by providing added value services that 
maximise their investments in talent. This approach will 
enable the achievement of our strategic goals.
In addition, the improved economic backdrop in the territories in 
which Rethink operates is encouraging and it is expected that the 
‘war for talent’ will now start to accelerate as client organisations 
resume investment to compete in their markets.

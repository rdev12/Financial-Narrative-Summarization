Risk.Managed.
Operating in the non-standard
consumer ﬁnance market is not for
the inexperienced. The opportunities
are considerable. But so are the risks,
if you misjudge or mismanage them.
Over many years we’ve been 
building a unique understanding 
of this market. And a thorough,
methodical approach that we 
call ‘Risk.Managed.’ This is not
particularly complex, or high-tech. 
It simply requires unrelenting
awareness and control of risk, in
everything we do. Easy to prescribe,
rather harder to deliver. But we’ve
proved it delivers consistent,
sustainable results. 
It’s helped many thousands of 
people to build or repair their 
credit histories, enabled hundreds 
of companies to grow, and increased
earnings consistently for many years. 
Risk.Managed. For us, it’s a 
way of life.

 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
FOCUSED 0N  
FREE CASH FLOW
as our primary 
driver of value
10 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 “In light of the lower gold price 
environment we are redoubling  
our efforts to remove further costs 
from the business in order to return  
to free cash generation.”
Introduction
I am pleased with the progress we have made 
across the business over the past 12 months 
as we continued to transform Acacia into a 
leading company in Africa, although the speed 
of the turnaround is slower than I had hoped  
to achieve. While we did not realise our primary 
aim of generating free cash flow in 2015 as  
a result of the challenges we faced, primarily  
in the third quarter, we did see an increase  
in production over 2014. This production  
was, however, lower than planned, which  
had a knock-on effect on costs.
Clearly we are disappointed that we did  
not achieve some of our goals. However,  
to address the combined effects of Q3 
performance and the continuation of a lower 
gold price we decided to accelerate a wide-
ranging rightsizing of our workforce in Q4.  
This process has now largely been completed  
and means we have a leaner, more nimble 
organisation that is set up to deliver in 2016 
and beyond, as was evident in our improved  
Q4 performance.
Year in review
Much was accomplished in 2015 as we 
progressed the mechanisation of Bulyanhulu 
and successfully transitioned North Mara  
into a combined open pit and underground 
operation. As a result, production increased for 
the third consecutive year to 731,912 ounces, 
2% higher than 2014, but marginally below the 
initial guidance range for the year. Production 
increased by 5% at North Mara to 287,188 
ounces driven by the contribution of the newly 
commissioned Gokona Underground and by 
17% at Bulyanhulu to 273,552 ounces as we 
saw a full year of operations of the re-claimed 
tailings project. At Buzwagi, production fell  
by 19% as a result of operations being focused 
on low grade areas in the open pit. 
On the cost side, we continued to demonstrate 
discipline and began to show the full benefit  
of the changes we have made to the cost base 
over the year in the fourth quarter, with all-in 
sustaining costs (‘AISC’) of US$1,004 per 
ounce. This represents a US$700 per ounce 
reduction in our quarterly AISC since Q3 2012. 
Although we delivered strong cost performance 
in Q4, the impact of lower than expected 
annual production, together with continued 
investment into the development of Bulyanhulu, 
led to full year AISC of US$1,112 per ounce 
sold, broadly in line with 2014 and marginally 
above our initial guidance range. Encouragingly, 
we continued to show strong capital discipline 
whilst delivering increased production, with capital 
expenditure being down by 30% over 2014. 
We ended the year with net cash of US$105 
million and US$233 million of cash on our 
balance sheet, a reduction over the previous 
year of US$61 million. This included costs 
incurred of US$20 million on exploration, 
US$17 million on dividends, US$10 million  
We continue to look for ways to drive productivity 
and efficiencies within each of our operations.

STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
on restructuring our workforce and US$15 
million spent on the first repayment of our 
outstanding project debt for the CIL expansion 
at Bulyanhulu. In the fourth quarter we added 
US$7 million in cash to the balance sheet, at  
a time when the gold price hit a six-year low, 
and we believe that with the expected reduction 
in costs this year we will add cash to the balance 
sheet in 2016 at levels well below the current 
gold price. Given our planned production profile 
we expect this to occur primarily in the second 
half of the year. 
Total revenue for the year amounted to US$868 
million, which was 7% below 2014 as a result  
of the US$104 per ounce lower average realised 
gold price and despite the 2% increase in sales 
ounces. EBITDA was similarly affected by the 
gold price, at US$175 million, down from 
US$253 million in 2014. We had a loss for the 
year of US$197 million, primarily as a result of a 
US$189 million non-cash impairment at Buzwagi, 
with adjusted earnings of US$7 million.
Reserves and resources
The continuing weakness in the gold price 
throughout 2015 has led to a reduction in the 
gold price assumption we have incorporated 
into our reserve and resource calculations.  
Our reserve pricing is now US$1,100 per 
ounce, down from US$1,300 per ounce, and 
our resource pricing at our mines has been 
reduced by US$100 per ounce to US$1,400 
per ounce. This reduction in gold price, in 
tandem with updated operating assumptions  
at Bulyanhulu, following a detailed block by 
block re-appraisal of our reserves, has led to  
a total reduction of approximately 3.7 million 
ounces of gold reserves, with around 90%  
of the reduction being at Bulyanhulu. Whilst  
this is disappointing, Bulyanhulu continues  
to have a mine life in excess of 20 years and 
unchanged total reserves and resources of  
17 million ounces. Our planning will be focused 
on the continued optimisation of our operating 
performance and on ultimately bringing as 
many of these ounces as possible back into 
our reserve base. This will only be once we  
are fully satisfied that they meet our return 
criteria at current prices. At North Mara,  
we more than replaced reserves in the Gokona 
Underground as an improved understanding  
of the ore body allowed us to both extend  
and add stopes within the mine plan to bring  
in additional profitable ore tonnes. 
Carrying value review
As a result of the continued decrease in the 
gold price during 2015, the gold price used to 
assess the carrying value of our operating 
assets and exploration properties was reduced 
in line with market expectations to US$1,100 
per ounce for 2016, US$1,150 for 2017 and 
US$1,200 from 2018 onwards. This change 
required us to test the carrying value of each  
of our operating mines for potential impairment. 
The impairment review resulted in no change  
to the carrying value at either Bulyanhulu or 
North Mara, but due to the impact of the lower 
gold price on the short life of mine at Buzwagi, 
where we have assumed a flat US$1,100 per 
ounce gold price, we have incurred a non-cash 
post-tax impairment charge of US$188.7 
million at the mine. Following the impairment 
our total carrying value for the Company has 
decreased to US$1.7 billion, with Buzwagi  
now carried at US$81 million.
Expanding our footprint
We continue to look to enhance our portfolio of 
assets, and during 2015 expanded our exploration 
portfolio in Burkina Faso and made our first 
entry into Mali. We believe that exploration is  
a significant driver of value for the business 
over the long term and now is the time to invest, 
which is a contrarian view to many in the market. 
We also had a successful year within our 
existing exploration portfolio as the drilling 
programmes in West Kenya identified 
encouraging potential across the Liranda 
Corridor, and we announced in December 2015 
that we had intercepted multiple lenses of  
high grade mineralisation which will be followed  
up in 2016. In Burkina Faso, programmes on 
the South Houndé joint venture have expanded 
both the oxide and fresh rock resources and 
our joint venture partner Sarama Resources 
announced in February 2016 an increase of 
600,000 ounces of inferred resources at the 
project, giving a total resource of 2.1 million 
ounces at 1.5 grams per tonne (calculated  
and, where relevant, declared in accordance 
with JORC requirements). 
We have also formed an earn-in joint venture 
with OreCorp Limited to progress our Nyanzaga 
Project in Tanzania. The structure of the joint 
venture allows us to continue our focus of 
delivery from our existing mines whilst retaining 
the optionality to participate in the potential 
future development of a large-scale gold mine. 
We believe that the team at OreCorp, having 
previously run large-scale projects in Tanzania, 
are well placed to advance the project.
Safety
We are pleased to report that we saw an 
improvement in safety performance in 2015  
as the behavioural safety programme, “Tunajali”  
or “We Care”, began to take effect across all of 
our operations. As a result our total reportable 
incident frequency rate improved by 21% despite 
a toughening of the criteria we use to assess 
the measure. Whilst we experienced no fatal 
incidents in 2015, regrettably, in January 2016 
one of our contractors at North Mara passed 
away as a result of a haul truck accident. We 
continue to target zero injuries and having every 
person going home safely every day.
Cost saving initiatives
As we move into 2016, our focus continues to  
be the delivery of free cash flow. We successfully 
returned to free cash generation in Q4 2015, 
despite the costs associated with the significant 
reduction in workforce, and expect to generate 
free cash for the full year 2016. To strengthen 
our ability to generate free cash flow, we have 
taken further action to reduce costs across the 
business, including:
• US$25 million annual saving from the 
restructuring of the workforce announced 
in late 2015
• US$10 million further reduction in capital 
expenditure (based on the bottom of 2016 
guidance range)
• US$10 million reduction in corporate 
administration costs; spend reduced by 
50% since 2012
• US$10 million of annualised savings 
targeted through renegotiation of contracts 
across supply chain 
• The Board of Directors and the Executive 
Leadership Team have volunteered to take 
a 10% reduction in salary
Mitigation of gold price risk at Buzwagi
In February 2016, Acacia entered into zero cost 
collars in relation to 136,000 ounces of 2016 
production from Buzwagi in order to mitigate 
cash flow risk associated with a potential fall  
in the gold price. The agreements provide a 
guaranteed floor price of US$1,150 per ounce 
and also provide exposure to the gold price  
up to an average of US$1,290 per ounce.  
This was a prudent step in locking in a gold 
price in excess of our planning price at Buzwagi, 
where mining activities are due to complete  
in 2017 followed by approximately two years  
of stockpile retreatment. We are, and plan to 
remain, fully unhedged at our long-life assets, 
Bulyanhulu and North Mara.
12 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Acacia Kilimanjaro Challenge
In June 2015, a team of Acacia staff, led  
by CEO, Brad Gordon and CFO, Andrew Wray 
raised over US$420,000 for CanEducate,  
a charity that provides educational 
sponsorships to impoverished and at-risk 
children primarily in Tanzania, by completing  
the challenge of reaching Uhuru Peak;  
the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.
Mount Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania, is the highest 
freestanding mountain in the world and  
Uhuru Peak, at 5,895 metres, is the highest 
point in Africa. To get there the climbers spent  
seven days tackling a variety of climates and 
terrain, along with physical challenges such  
as altitude sickness.
Uhuru means freedom and we believe education 
brings freedom through choice, which is why 
CanEducate is the perfect recipient of funds 
raised through the climb. Acacia’s relationship 
with CanEducate began in 2010 when the 
initiative covered 158 students at Bulyanhulu 
and it has now grown to cover over 2,100 
students in 2015, and has supported over 
7,000 students since 2010.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Our operating environment
Currency depreciation
Over 2015, the US dollar strengthened 
against many of the global currencies  
as a result of stronger economic growth and 
expectations of an increasing interest rate 
environment. Emerging market currencies, 
including the Tanzanian shilling, performed 
particularly poorly as their growth outlook 
weakened due to their higher proportional 
exposure to the commodity markets. 
In Tanzania this led to a 25% fall in the 
value of the Tanzanian shilling over the year. 
This had a twin impact on Acacia. On the 
positive side, it provides a small operational 
benefit to Acacia as approximately 15% of  
our cash costs are denominated in Tanzanian 
shillings and the impact of the exchange  
rate differential is yet to be removed through 
inflation. However, on the negative side,  
we also have US$110 million of outstanding 
indirect tax receivables owed to Acacia  
by the Government of Tanzania which are 
denominated in TSH. As Acacia reports in 
dollars, these are re-valued each quarter and 
result in mark-to-market losses in proportion 
to the exchange rate changes. In 2015, these 
amounted to a loss of US$28 million.
General elections
Tanzania’s general election cycle runs  
every five years and under electoral law, the 
sitting President, having served two terms, 
was unable to stand again in 2015. Peaceful 
multi-party elections took place in October  
and were closely watched by international 
observers. The election was preceded by  
a closely fought campaign, primarily focused 
on reduction of corruption in the country, 
between the candidates of the ruling party, 
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (‘CCM’) and Chadema, 
the main opposition. Ultimately CCM 
prevailed and President John Magufuli  
has been inaugurated as Tanzania’s fifth 
President. During the electoral process 
Acacia continued to operate well.
Our commodity environment
Gold
The market price of gold has a significant 
impact on Acacia’s ability to generate cash 
flows. Gold price volatility continued to be 
elevated during 2015 with the gold price 
ranging from a high of US$1,302 per ounce  
to a low of US$1,051 per ounce and closing 
the year at US$1,061 per ounce. Market gold 
prices averaged US$1,160 per ounce in 2015, 
an 8% decline from the prior year average  
of US$1,266. The price of gold was negatively 
influenced during the year by US economic 
growth, which led to a strong dollar and 
exchange traded fund (‘ETF’) outflows.  
These were partially offset by strong physical 
demand in Asia, particularly China and India, 
and central bank buying. In December 2015, 
the US Federal Reserve increased its interest 
rates by 0.25% from its previous historical 
lows which led to further US dollar strength 
and gold weakness.
During 2015, Acacia did not undertake  
gold hedging, but in February 2016, in order  
to mitigate the cash flow risk associated  
with the potential fall in the gold price,  
Acacia has entered into zero cost collars that  
cover 136,000 ounces of production from  
Buzwagi at an average floor price of US$1,150 
per ounce and also provide exposure to  
the gold price up to an average of $1,290  
per ounce. We are, and will remain, unhedged  
at Bulyanhulu and North Mara.
Copper
Acacia also produces copper as a co-product 
which is recognised as a part of revenue. 
Copper traded between US$2.05 and  
US$2.92 per pound in 2015. The average 
market copper price for 2015 was US$2.49 
compared to US$3.11 per pound in 2014.  
The price of copper was negatively influenced 
during the year by weakening demand from 
China, the world’s largest consumer.
During 2015 we utilised an option collar 
strategy whereby 24% of our expected annual 
copper production was hedged at an average 
floor price of US$3.08 per pound and an 
average ceiling price of US$3.35 per pound, 
resulting in a realised gain of US$1.4 million 
for the year. In 2016, we currently have  
no copper collars in place but continue to 
monitor prices to target prices with floors 
above the current budget rates.
Fuel
At our operations we consume diesel within 
our mobile mining fleet and to self-generate 
power when required. Diesel is refined from 
crude oil and is therefore subject to the same  
price volatility affecting crude oil prices and  
has a significant impact on our production  
costs. We consumed approximately 455,000 
barrels of diesel in 2015 (2014: 496,000). 
During 2015, Brent Crude oil traded between  
US$36 and US$68 per barrel and averaged 
US$54 per barrel (2014: US$100 per barrel). 
Crude oil has been impacted by the strength 
of the US dollar and increased supplies from 
OPEC countries as sanctions were lifted, 
resulting in an oversupplied market. 
During 2015, we utilised an option collar 
strategy to hedge 75% of our estimated  
diesel consumption at an average floor  
price of US$97 per barrel and average  
ceiling price of US$110 per barrel, resulting  
in a realised loss of US$13.6 million. In 2015,  
we have continued this strategy and put  
in place protection on approximately 75%  
and 68% of our expected 2016 and 2017 
consumption respectively, with average floors 
of US$72 and US$50 and average ceilings  
of US$94 and US$81 per barrel respectively.
MARKET OVERVIEW
14 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Outlook
Whilst the Group delivered strong performance  
in the fourth quarter, full year delivery in 2015 
was below expectations despite a very successful 
year at North Mara. As a result, we have 
incorporated the learnings from this as well as 
our primary focus on free cash flow into our mine 
plans for 2016 and beyond. We expect production 
to increase to 750,000–780,000 ounces,  
a 5% increase over 2015 at the mid-point of  
the range. We also expect a reduction in AISC  
of approximately 15% to US$950–980 per ounce, 
with cash costs expected to fall to US$670–700 
per ounce. Due to the grade profile at Buzwagi  
in Q1, we expect a production ratio of 45:55  
in terms of the first half versus the second half  
of the year.
At Bulyanhulu we have fundamentally  
re-engineered the operation over the past two 
years and delivered a 40% production increase 
in that time. We have made significant progress 
in the mechanisation of the mine, increasing 
workforce productivities and improving 
underground operating metrics. 
Our focus is on free cash flow and accordingly 
we have reviewed reserves based on the lower 
gold price assumption and a more detailed 
mine design approach. Following this review, 
and our experience in 2015, it was determined 
that within the Upper East Zone, which was 
expected to ramp up significantly in 2016, 
further definition drilling on the Reef 2 series  
is required in order to define the geological 
complexity and as a result we have deferred 
the planned increase in mining rates. As a 
result, we expect production in 2016 to be 
broadly in line with 2015 and with our focus  
on cost reduction measures we expect AISC  
to fall by more than 15% year on year. 
We are still confident that Bulyanhulu will 
produce 350,000 ounces per annum over the 
medium term and are assessing the potential 
above this production rate through an ongoing 
three-year drilling programme, primarily on  
the Reef 2 series. 
North Mara is expected to continue to  
perform strongly as the Gokona Underground  
is fully ramped up and a second access portal 
is developed to provide additional flexibility.  
As a result of the increased proportion of  
mill feed being sourced from the underground 
we expect to see a 5% increase in production, 
with a similar reduction in AISC in 2016  
over 2015.
At Buzwagi, we expect the mine to generate 
solid cash flows over 2016, with production 
expected to be 10% higher than 2015 with 
AISC down by approximately 15%. As a result  
of delays in waste movement in 2015, there  
will be a focus on waste stripping in Q1 2016  
to reduce the backlog. This will result in the 
deferral of some of the high-grade material 
previously planned to be mined in the year  
into Q1 2017 and will mean that approximately  
35% of the mill feed in the first quarter will 
come from lower-grade stockpiles. 
We have continued to improve our capital 
discipline and expect a further 5% reduction  
in capital expenditure in 2016 to US$175–180 
million driven by a further reduction in sustaining 
capital to approximately US$60 million as we 
focus on production critical initiatives at each 
of the mines. Our investment in waste stripping 
and underground development is expected  
to be in line with 2015 as we continue to build 
flexibility in the underground operations at 
Bulyanhulu and North Mara. 
As previously indicated, we plan to maintain  
our exploration spend at approximately US$20 
million, as we progress projects in Kenya, 
Burkina Faso and Mali and look to further  
add prospective land packages to our portfolio. 
Corporate administration costs are expected  
to fall by over 25% to US$25 million as we  
see the impact of a reduction in headcount, 
travel and other central expenses.
Finally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues 
for their commitment, enthusiasm and hard 
work throughout what has been another year  
of transformation at Acacia. We have made 
good progress to date and believe we are  
on the cusp of making this Company a leader  
in Africa. I would also like to thank our Board  
for their support and guidance through the year 
and I am looking forward to 2016 and beyond.

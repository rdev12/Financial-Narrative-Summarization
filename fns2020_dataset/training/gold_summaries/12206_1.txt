“2010 has been a very successful year.” 
“We have delivered record results for the Group which has 
included a year of triple-digit growth in both turnover and 
gross profit.” 
 
Alan Bonner, Chief Executive Officer 
 
Introduction 
2010 has been a very successful year, as we have returned a maiden operating profit of £78,647 compared 
to a 2009 operating loss of £582,816. This result is measured before amortisation of intangibles, exceptional 
acquisition costs, share of results of associates and the embedded fair value adjustment in the convertible 
loan. After these adjustments, which are mainly non-cash based and a requirement of International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Group returned an operating loss of £236,572 (2009: loss 
£890,856). We continue to view IFRS adjustments as technical, and they have little bearing on cash. 
Accordingly, we believe that the best measure of operating profit or loss should be before striking these 
costs. 
 
Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation of intangibles, exceptional 
acquisition costs, share of results of associates and the embedded fair value adjustment in the convertible 
loan) is an important performance measurement, and we regard EBITDA as a key performance indicator in 
terms of our operating result. Although there is no requirement to disclose EBITDA, we believe that, 
because of its importance, it should be part of our disclosure. 
 
IFRS accounting requires us to carefully consider the carrying value of our intangible assets and forces 
amortisation of these assets. Acquisitions also require us to consider whether the goodwill that we have 
acquired (basically the difference between the net assets of the business acquired and the price paid) 
should be recognised and allocated in our financial statements as other intangible assets, such as a 
customer base, billing system and so on which would not necessarily be recognised in the financial 
statements of the acquired business. For the first time, we are required to expense the costs of acquisitions, 
and £18,216 has been expensed in the year and shown as an exceptional item in the income statement. 
Overall, the loss carried forward for the year was £261,239 compared to a loss of £897,063 in 2009. 
These are record results for the Group which has included a year of triple-digit growth in both turnover and 
gross profit. 2010 has also been a year of consolidation. For the second year running, turnover more than 
doubled, up 107% to £6,608,533. We have managed and enhanced our cash resources whilst remaining 
free of bank debt.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (CONTINUED) 
With a view to streamlining our operations, we have taken time to considerably reduce the number of operating subsidiaries and 
have successfully closed some of our office locations, which has enabled us to centralise a number of our core functions into new 
larger offices on the outskirts of Northampton. 
 
As we continue to move our business away from traditional telephony onto next generation IP telephony, the acquisition of 
Solwise Telephony Limited and its subsidiary Sipswitch Limited in January 2010 was of major importance to the group. Sipswitch 
has developed its own proprietary next generation VoIP system, which we have continued to develop in-house. Our balance sheet 
shows that the carrying value of our investment in this technology to 30 September 2010 amounted to £195,834. The Sipswitch 
acquisition was timely as it was fundamental to Pinnacle being awarded, and successfully delivering, voice and data services to a 
significant number of the UK’s biggest high-profile events, which included voice and data networks for the BBC’s coverage of the 
UK General Election and the BBC’s coverage of the Pope’s first ever State visit. We expect to be able to win high-profile events of 
this nature again in 2011.  As we focus our sales efforts on the roll out of cloud based IP solutions, we also look forward in 2011 to 
further deployments by leveraging the intellectual property that is embedded in our award winning VoIP platform. 
On 22 September 2010, I was pleased to welcome Dr Tom Black as a shareholder; as a result of an issue of new ordinary shares. 
The Company raised £450,000 through the issue of 128,571,429 new Ordinary Shares at 0.35p per share. Tom, the former CEO 
of Detica plc, a major provider of security, intelligence and analysis solutions and current Executive Chairman of AIM listed Digital 
Barriers plc, subscribed personally for 57,142,857 shares in the placing, representing 3.06% of the enlarged share capital of the 
Company. The Board and the senior management team also subscribed for new shares in the placing. The placing price 
represented a premium of approximately 18.64% over the mid-market closing price of 0.295p on 21 September 2010.  
The consolidation within our market is moving at a rapid pace and we aim to search out earning-enhancing bolt-on acquisitions, 
with a focus on delivering cloud based IP solutions. I believe our actions this year will provide us with a solid foundation on which 
we can build. 
Results 
Compared against our 2009 results, our 2010 performance shows a significant turnaround. 
• Turnover 
 
For the second year running, turnover more than doubled over the year, an increase of 107% from £3,192,222 in 2009 
to £6,608,533 in 2010. Approximately 81% (2009: 88%) of turnover is recurring income.  
• EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation of intangibles, exceptional acquisition 
costs, share of results of associates and the embedded fair value adjustment in the convertible loan) 
 
We regard EBITDA, as defined, as a key performance indicator and a figure that the Board considers on a regular basis. 
For 2010, we achieved positive annual EBITDA for the first time of £158,878 which compares very favourably with the 
2009 figure which stood at negative £499,429. Importantly, EBITDA has remained positive throughout the year, 
representing a significant turnaround and a milestone in the history of the group. 
• Gross Profit 
 
The overall gross profit for the full year was £2,089,457 (2009: £991,169) representing a gross profit to sales percentage 
of 31.6% (2009: 31.0%), a pleasing increase. Delivering a complex IP based solution, where we can add significant 
value to the customer, can deliver gross margins in excess of 50%. This complex area is now the focus of our business, 
as we see significant expansion opportunities, not just in the SME market but  also in multi-sited smaller corporates, 
where significant cost savings are achievable compared to traditional telecom deployments.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (CONTINUED) 
• Operating Profit (before amortisation of intangibles, exceptional acquisition costs, share of results of 
associates and the embedded fair value adjustment in the convertible loan) 
 
We have achieved a maiden operating profit, as defined, of £78,647 in the full year compared to an operating loss of 
£582,816 in 2009. This has been achieved through the results from acquisitions and from organic growth coupled with 
tight control of the operating costs of the business. 
• Loss for the year 
 
The overall loss for the year, after all costs, reduced by £635,824, down 71% to £261,239 compared to £897,063 in the 
previous year, a significant reduction. 
• Debt  
 
The group has no debt other than a loan note which is carried at fair value on the balance sheet of £133,467. 
 
• Cash 
 
At the year end the group had £697,189 (2009: £586,222) of cash available to fund working capital as the business 
continues to grow. The year-end figure has been helped by the share issue noted above and the micro management of 
cash during the year, and particularly at the year end. The cash balances remain a key performance indicator of the 
Board. 
 
• Administration Expenses 
 
Our administration expenses remain carefully controlled. Acquisitions, however, tend to mask the trend. For 2010 the 
administration expenses were £2,010,810 (2009: £1,573,985).  
• Balance Sheet 
 
At 30 September 2010, the group had net assets of £1,329,243 (2009: £921,645). Included in this figure are intangible 
assets, being the written down value of customer bases and maintenance contracts acquired, of £859,217 (2009: 
£864,123). Also included, as a result of the acquisition of Sipswitch Limited, are capitalised development costs of 
£195,834, being the costs less depreciation to 30 September 2010 of developing the VoIP platform now at the heart of 
the group’s strategy. This is being depreciated over a period of 5 years. 
The group keeps tight control over receivables and at the year end they represented 25 days of turnover (2009: 56 
days). Considering the current economic climate, we are very satisfied with this result. 65% of our customers pay by 
direct debit which helps the profile. 
Strategy 
The Group has continued its successful strategy to seek out well-priced and timely acquisitions, deliver organic growth and 
develop a wide range of next generation communications services, where the emphasis is on IP based cloud technologies. We 
will deliver to our customers, solutions that improve productivity, lower costs and save money, particularly for businesses that 
have more than one location. 
 
Future Developments 
We are undertaking a number of initiatives in 2011: 
 
• We continue the migration of all group customers onto a single billing system, which we expect to complete before the 
end of the first half of 2011.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (CONTINUED) 
• We plan to build an online customer-ordering portal that will allow customers to order and provision new services over 
the Internet. 
 
• We aim to roll out a remote on-line backup service for businesses, which will provide customers with an online system 
for backing up, storing and restoring computer files. 
 
• We expect to complete a major overhaul of our websites by the end of the 2011 half-year. 
 
Acquisitions 
On 13 January 2010, the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Solwise Telephony Limited, and its wholly owned 
subsidiary Sipswitch Limited. The initial consideration was £204,915, satisfied by the issue of 35,950,000 ordinary shares in 
Pinnacle Telecom Group plc at a price of 0.57 pence per share.  
 
The total consideration was apportioned to initial consideration, loan shares and contingent consideration as follows: 
 
• 31,746,843 of ordinary shares were issued as initial consideration. 
• A further 4,203,157 ordinary shares were issued in connection with loans owed by Solwise to certain vendors, 
amounting to £23,958 in aggregate. The loans were assigned from Solwise to the Company and were capitalised 
through the issue to the lenders of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. 
 
The acquisition agreement allows for contingent consideration with earn out provisions to be awarded, based on earnings before 
interest and taxation (“EBIT”) for the years ending 30 September 2010 and 30 September 2011. For the year ending 2010, 
additional consideration of £15,000 will be payable in ordinary shares for every £10,000 of EBIT above £40,000. For the year 
ending 2011, additional consideration of £15,000 will be payable in ordinary shares for every £10,000 of EBIT above £60,000. In 
accordance with IFRS3, we have accrued additional consideration of £80,000 in the financial statements, when calculating the 
intangible asset on acquisition. The total contingent consideration cannot exceed £295,085 in total over the two year end periods. 
 
At 30
 
September 2010, a provisional EBIT calculation was performed for Solwise which showed that potentially up to £30,000 of 
new ordinary shares may be issued to the vendors, represented by a price per share equal to the middle market closing price for 
an ordinary share in the Company on the day of the announcement of the preliminary results for the year ended 30
 
September 
2010. The final EBIT calculation for the year is subject to approval. 
Organic Growth 
Once again, we have successfully delivered organic growth during the year; one notable contract was 30 million voice call minutes 
per annum for Grass Roots plc, a marketing, research and HR services business, operating in 16 countries and employing over 
1,000 people. Won against much larger competitors, this deal demonstrates our capability to handle larger and more complex 
contracts. 
Contract Wins 
We were delighted to win contracts to deliver voice and data connectivity for many of the UK’s largest high-profile, short term 
events, which further demonstrates the group's ability in this specialist area, and shows good continuation of Pinnacle's skill to 
offer bespoke capability and build new sources of revenue growth.

Operations 
During the year, the group completed a reduction in the number of operating companies, which had expanded following a series of 
acquisitions over the years. There are now three main operating units. We expect to see some modest reductions in 
administration costs in the future as a result of the group structure consolidation 
 
We also managed to successfully close our office locations in Edinburgh, Hinckley, and central Northampton, which has allowed 
us to centralise a number of our core functions into new larger offices on the outskirts of Northampton. 
 
We have successfully migrated customers’ analogue fixed-lines and ISDN channels onto a new BT WLR3 service. Our systems 
connect to the BT WLR3 gateway, which gives us access to a wide range of products from BT Openreach, including resilience 
solutions and temporary lines. 
As a result of the acquisition of Solwise, we acquired a data centre in Brighton, which has allowed us to better utilise our 
connectivity between our data centre in Glasgow and our network located in Telehouse North in London. Our network now has 
resilience in Glasgow, London and Brighton. 
Summary 
We have made excellent progress this year, diligently managing our cash resources, strengthening our balance sheet and 
remaining free of bank debt. We assiduously centralised our operations into Northampton and successfully delivered voice and 
data networks for some of the UK’s largest high-profile events, including the UK General Election for the BBC. We have delivered 
triple-digit growth in turnover and gross margin, produced our maiden operating profit, and delivered positive EBITDA. 
Notwithstanding the difficulties of the economic climate, we aim to search out earning-enhancing bolt-on acquisitions, with a focus 
on delivering cloud based IP solutions, and we look forward to moving the business forward during 2011.

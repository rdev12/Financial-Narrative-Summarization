1 Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a useful comparison 
of business performance and reflect the way in which the business is controlled. 
Definitions are included in our accounting policies within the notes to the financial 
statements. Reconciliations between adjusted and reported measures are also 
included in the relevant notes.
2 Stick equivalents reflects our combined cigarette and fine cut tobacco volumes.
3 To aid understanding of our performance, change at constant currency removes 
the effects of exchange rate movements on the translation of the results of our 
overseas operations. References in this document to percentage growth and 
increases or decreases in our adjusted results are on a constant currency basis 
unless stated otherwise.
4 The definition of net revenue has been changed to exclude revenue from the sale of 
peripheral and non-tobacco related products, with comparatives restated accordingly.

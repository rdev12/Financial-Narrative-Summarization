 Chief Executive’s review
Jacques Vert Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 7
Group operating profit for the 53
weeks ended 30 April 2011 was
£5.4 million (2010: £5.3 million).
Profit before tax was £5.3 million
(2010: £5.1 million), an increase of
3.1%.
Against a backdrop of an
unpredictable retail climate the
business has performed well. T otal
sales for the year at £118.4 million
(2010: £115.3 million) were 2.6%
ahead of last year. Like for like sales
were 2.0% ahead of last year. 
At the end of the year the Group
operated from 874 outlets
compared with 960 outlets at the
beginning of the year.
One of the features of the
current retail market, which has
become increasingly apparent as the
year has progressed, is the level and
frequency of markdown activity
which has had a negative impact on
gross margins. In addition, as noted
at the time of the Interim statement,
gross margin is also being eroded by
supplier cost inflation. The
cumulative effect of these factors has
resulted in gross margin declining
slightly to 62.8% (2010: 63.7%). 
Distribution costs, which
comprise mainly of the costs of
operating stores, were £58.3 million
(2010: £56.9 million).
Administrative expenses at
£10.6 million (2010: £11.3 million)
have declined by 6% compared to
the prior year. The higher level of
administrative expenses in the prior
year was due to significant one off
costs and the level of expense in the
current year reflects a more normal
level of activity.
Cash and financing
Cash at the year end amounted to
£10.1 million (2010: £12.6 million).
The Group has embarked on a
significant investment programme to
replace its IT and ecommerce
systems and to invest in the retail
estate. As a result, capital
expenditure in the year amounted to
£2.9 million (2010: £1.1 million). In
addition there was a further outflow
of £2.3 million during the year
relating to the payment of a dividend
to shareholders (the first since 1995)
together with a purchase of shares
on behalf of the ESOP T rust of
£1.1 million.
Working capital requirements also
increased during the year to support
the increase in trading and in
particular the investment in stock for
ecommerce.
The Group has made an encouraging start
to the new financial year and sales in the
nine weeks since the year end have
increased by 1.7% on a like-for-like basis.   Chief Executive’s review continued

Current trading and prospects
Sales since the year end have
continued to be unpredictable and it
has been difficult to discern a
particular trend and, as a result, we
are cautious about the outlook for
this financial year. The Group has,
however, made an encouraging start
to the new financial year and sales in
the nine weeks since the year end
have increased by 1.7% on a like-
for-like basis. Gross margin is
marginally lower than last year,
primarily due to ongoing cost
pressures from suppliers. We
continue to re-evaluate our supply
base and the wider supply chain in
an effort to improve margins.
Despite the challenging market
conditions we are well placed for
the new financial year; the new
Jacques Vert Autumn/Winter 2011
collections have been well received
by customers, we have secured new
premium concession space in host
stores and believe there are further
opportunities to develop our
ecommerce business both in the UK
and internationally. In addition, when
the new systems implementation has
been completed it will open up
opportunities to improve
significantly the operating
effectiveness of the business,
although the benefits will not be
seen until the next financial year.

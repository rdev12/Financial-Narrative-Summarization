Chief Executive’s 
Review
Q How does the new organisational structure fit in 
with our vision?
A 
Our new organisational structure has created a cohesive, global 
organisation with a clear structure that unites the businesses and 
puts our customers firmly at the centre of everything we do.
 Our vision is to drive exceptional value through our performance 
materials and technical expertise, contributing to a more 
sustainable world. We will do this by developing a global portfolio 
of performance materials businesses, by leveraging our existing 
capabilities and leadership expertise, and through a focus on our 
technology excellence. This is encapsulated in our strapline ‘Progress 
through Performance’ and underpinned by our new corporate 
brand values.
 The new structure reflects our vision and is the blueprint to 
guide our growth and development. It is led by the Executive 
Leadership Team (ELT), which is responsible for strategy, direction 
and performance. We are organised into five Global Business 
Units, covering the Building & Industrial, Civil Engineering, Coated 
Technical Textiles, Interior & Transportation and Sports & Leisure 
sectors. Each manages a strong portfolio of brands and is focused 
on developing customer intimacy and improving commercial 
execution. The GBUs are supported and enabled by strong 
Group-wide functions, focused on improving processes, increasing 
efficiency and raising standards in their areas of expertise. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

Q How do our new brand values support  
our ambitions?
A 
Our values are a set of beliefs that will provide unity and focus, 
underpinning our new organisational structure. These Group-
wide values are the outcome of detailed consultations across the 
business. They are closely aligned to our strategy and will drive the 
culture and behaviours we need to deliver it.
 We believe we can…
• Be world class
• Empower and perform
• Embrace the new
• Collaborate to transform
Q How do we intend to deliver ‘Progress  
through Performance’?
A 
This encompasses not only our focus on delivering high 
performance materials that exceed our customers’ expectations 
but also on building a high performance organisation – investing in 
our global support functions to build best-in-class manufacturing 
and infrastructure and in our people to build a talented workforce. 
These are all intrinsically linked, and our new structure will ensure 
we harness the potential from across the Group to grow our 
revenues, profitability and earnings.
Q What does sustainability mean to Low & Bonar?
A 
We are focused on contributing to a more sustainable world by 
leading the development of smart performance materials. We are 
driven by the need to meet the challenges faced by our customers 
for more effective, durable products that save resources and 
improve performance by incorporating advances in technology to 
meet these challenges.

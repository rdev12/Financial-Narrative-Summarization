 Chairman’ s Statement
I am pleased to report that Carillion made
good progress in 2002, with an 11 per cent
increase in profit before tax, goodwill and
exceptional items. Earnings per share before
goodwill and exceptional items grew by 
19 per cent. 
Chairman, Sir Neville Simms
Carillion was appointed preferred bidder
for the John Radcliffe Hospital PPP
project in December 2002.
The delivery of substantial earnings
growth in 2002 is a significant
achievement, especially as the general
business climate became less certain
during the year. This success reflects 
not only the Group’s good overall
operating performance, but the progress
being made with implementation of 
the strategy we have developed and
pursued since Carillion was launched 
as an independent company in 1999,
namely to develop our Business 
Services and PPP Investment activities
alongside a well positioned Construction
Services business.
The Group has again delivered substantial
growth in its Business Services and PPP
Investment activities, both organically 
and through acquisitions, including Citex
Management Services in 2002 together
with the full year effect of the successful
acquisition of GT Railway Maintenance
and additional PPP project equity in the
second half of 2001. This growth has
more than offset a reduction in activity 
in Construction Services, resulting largely
from our strategy to focus on higher
added value contracts with long-term
customers. This has involved downsizing
in some markets and exiting others,
including the disposal of our social
housing business in the second half of
2001 and Maxxiom, our joint venture
plant hire business, in 2002.

In the same way, the Board looks to
adopt a balanced and forward thinking
approach to all other aspects of corporate
governance. We have carried out an 
initial review of compliance with the key
recommendations of the Higgs and Smith
reports and we believe that we are largely
in compliance with their major procedural
recommendations. Before these reports
were published, we conducted our own
detailed examination of the effectiveness
of our Board and changed our working
practices where it was judged appropriate
to do so. We now propose to repeat this
review annually.
At the time of writing, it seems that
many of the recommendations of the
Higgs review will be adopted into the
Combined Code and will apply to
Carillion from the 2004 financial year.
However, we are confident of being in 
a position to report in our Report and
Accounts for the year ending 2003 as if
the revisions to the Code were in place.
Carillion works hard to maintain its
position as an industry leader in health
and safety and in managing and
improving the environmental and social
aspects of our business. We believe that
the model we have developed to link 
our improvement programmes in each 
of these areas to the Group’s business
strategy and financial performance 
has further differentiated us from our
competitors and underlined our industry
leadership in the development of a
successful and sustainable business. 
This work is summarised later in this
report and described in more detail in 
our separate Sustainability Report, which
can be found on our website.
Carillion has made a good start to 
2003 by winning a number of significant
new contracts, particularly in our growth
segments, adding to our substantial year
end order book. We therefore believe
that our strategy remains sound and that
despite the global uncertainty the Group
will make further progress in 2003.

The Group’s Business Improvement
Programme is also playing a key part in
the successful delivery of our strategy. 
By helping all our people to live up to 
our core values and deliver continuous
improvement in the efficiency and 
quality of the services we provide for our
customers, we are creating a culture for
success. We owe our success therefore
not only to the skills and commitment 
of our people, but also to their ability to
embrace change and continually strive to
exceed the expectations of our customers.
The Board is recommending the payment
of a final dividend of 3.3 pence per share,
making the total for the year 4.8 pence
per share, an increase of 9 per cent on
2001. The final dividend will be paid on 
27 June 2003 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 
2 May 2003.
The year saw significant developments 
in corporate governance with the
publication of the Higgs Review of 
the role of non-executive directors and 
the Smith Report on audit committee
governance.
The lead Carillion has taken within 
its sector on Sustainability shows the 
Board’s commitment to taking a broadly
based view of the effects of our business
activities on society and the environment.

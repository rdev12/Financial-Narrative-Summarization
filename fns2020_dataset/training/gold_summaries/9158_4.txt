Our brands 
  
 
     
      
B&Q is the largest 
home improvement and 
garden centre retailer  
in the UK and Ireland 
offering around  
40,000 products for the 
homemaker, occasional 
to serious DIYers, and 
trade professionals. In 
China, the business is 
adapted to the local 
preference for a  
‘Do-it-for-Me’, model. It 
specialises in the fitting 
out and decoration of 
new apartments. 
 With up to 50,000 
products under one 
roof, Castorama France 
is one of the leading 
home improvement 
retailers in France.  
Like B&Q, Castorama 
targets retail customers 
and DIYers and has an 
emphasis on style  
and inspiration for 
homemakers. In Poland 
and Russia there is a 
bigger emphasis on 
projects, as the home 
improvement market  
is at an earlier stage of 
its development. 
 In both France and 
Spain, Brico Dépôt  
is primarily aimed at 
serious DIYers and 
professional builders. 
It operates a low-price 
format which offers 
customers a choice  
of 10,000 products 
available in larger 
product quantities.  
The same format is  
now being introduced 
into Romania. 
Screwfix is the UK’s 
largest omnichannel 
supplier of trade  
tools, accessories  
and hardware to trade 
professionals and 
serious DIY enthusiasts. 
In addition to its 
catalogue and website, 
Screwfix operates stores 
across the UK.  
 Koçtas ¸, Kingfisher’s 
joint venture in Turkey, 
is now the number one 
home improvement 
retailer in the country. 
Its stores are aimed  
at mainstream 
consumers, 
homemakers  
and occasional  
to serious DIYers.

Chairman’s Statement
Keith Butler-Wheelhouse
“Our strategy for the future will focus on growing 
both top and bottom line by oﬀering ﬁrst class 
technology which is valued by our customers.”
Introduction
Having been involved as Chairman for only the 
ﬁnal month of this ﬁnancial year, full credit must 
go to my predecessor Tom Brown, the Board and 
the Executive Team for the manner in which they 
have steered the Company through the recession 
with both proﬁts and revenues now exceeding 
pre-downturn levels.
I believe Chamberlin is well placed to achieve 
further improvement in results and look forward 
to leading the Board and supporting the Executive 
Team to deliver sustained proﬁtable growth in the 
years to come.
Results
Revenues for the year ended 31 March 2012 rose 
by 14% to £45.5m (2011: £39.8m). Previous reports 
have noted that increasing revenues included a 
strong contribution from new business and I am 
encouraged to see that this trend is continuing.
Underlying operating proﬁt increased by 92% to 
£1.7m (2011: £0.9m), with gross margins again 
increasing, to 19.5% (2011: 18.7%). The underlying 
proﬁt before tax was up 107% to £1.7m (2011: 
£0.8m) and underlying earnings per share rose 
2.7 times to 18.3p (2011: 6.7p).
The statutory results show statutory operating 
proﬁt increased to £1.6m (2011: £0.5m), statutory 
proﬁt before tax up to £1.4m (2011: £0.3m) and 
statutory earnings per share up to 16.1p (2011: 1.3p). 
Chamberlin continues to be strongly cash 
generative and we remain focused on working 
capital control. Cash generated from operations 
rose by 36% to £2.4m (2011: £1.8m). This was 
signiﬁcantly above underlying operating proﬁt 
and allowed us to reduce net borrowing by 46% 
to £1.6m (2011: £2.9m). Gearing reduced to 17% 
(2011: 37%) and Chamberlin continues to be 
ﬁnanced by a £5.0m overdraft facility from HSBC. 
In July 2011, a placing of shares with Diverse 
Income Trust plc, managed by MAM Funds plc, 
raised £0.5m (gross).
Dividend
With continued earnings growth and cash 
generation proceeding as expected, our balance 
sheet continues to strengthen. I am therefore 
pleased to announce that the Directors are 
recommending the payment of a ﬁnal dividend 
of 2.0p per share, to be paid on 13 July 2012 to 
shareholders on the register at 29 June 2012. This 
takes the total dividend for the year to 3.0p (2011: 
1.0p) and is in line with the progressive dividend 
policy we introduced last year when we restored 
the payment of dividends.
The Board
After nine years of service to the Company, Tom 
Brown retired from Chamberlin on 29 February 
2012, when he passed the role of Chairman of the 
Board to me. On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank Tom for his considerable contribution to 
Chamberlin over the years and to wish him well 
for the future.
Strategy and Outlook
In visiting Chamberlin’s operations, I have been 
impressed by the skills and competence of 
everyone I have met. Also, there is a feeling of 
openness to change, coupled with a determination 
to drive the business forward. I will enjoy adding 
my experience in support of Chamberlin’s eﬀorts 
to achieve growth in the coming years.
The Board has concentrated in recent years on 
the modernisation of the Group’s businesses 
and tightened their focus on the technically 
demanding areas of the markets we serve under 
the theme “diﬃcult things done well”. This 
approach has delivered a strong foundation on 
which to build and our strategy for the future will 
focus on growing both top and bottom line by 
oﬀering ﬁrst class technology which is valued by 
our customers. We anticipate that growth will be 
achieved both organically and by acquisition and 
we will continue to explore opportunities which 
would be a logical extension to the Group.

 H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 8
Chairman’s Statement
The directors and I are very pleased with H&T’s
performance in 2008. It was another year of record
financial results with profit before tax and exceptional
items reaching £10.9 million (2007: £7.2 million).
We opened 16 new stores in the year (2007: 12),
including our 100th store in Stockton, and had 105
stores trading at 31 December 2008 (2007: 89).
Financial Performance
H&T exceeded internal financial targets set by the
Board for the Group at the beginning of the year
and, in the process, achieved record gross profit
and earnings per share. 
Gross profit increased by 28.9 per cent. to £35.7
million (2007: £27.7 million) driven by new stores,
like-for-like growth and continued rise in the gold
price (contributing an estimated £1.8 million
additional profit when compared with FY07).
Earnings Before Interest Taxation Depreciation 
and Amortisation (“EBITDA”) before exceptional
items increased by 38.6 per cent. to £15.8 million
(2007: £11.4 million). Operating profit before
exceptional items increased by 41.0 per cent. 
to £14.1 million (2007: £10.0 million).
Basic earnings per share was up from 15.17 
pence in 2007 to 20.27 pence in 2008. 
Net cash generated by our operating activities
increased by £1.5 million to £4.1 million (2007:
£2.6 million) and the Group has bank funding in
place to May 2011.
Final Dividend
Subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend 
of 4.5 pence per ordinary share (2007: 3.4
pence) up 32 per cent. on 2007 will be paid on 
3 June 2009 to shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 8 May 2009. The shares will
be marked ex-dividend on 6 May 2009. This will
bring the full year dividend to 6.5 pence per share,
a 30 per cent. increase on 2007 (5.0 pence).
The growth in dividend reflects the good
performance of the Group in 2008 and the 
Board’s confidence in future prospects.
Prospects
We do not consider Pawnbroking to be a cyclical
business. We are benefiting from the price of gold
in our disposition activities and, unlike other
lending businesses, pawnbroking has resilient
collateral. The Group has so far seen an increase
in the number of new pawnbroking customers in
line with historical trends and the expansion in our
store estate. Our strong financial performance is
the result of a successful growth strategy which we
intend to continue in 2009. 
I would like to thank all our staff for their hard work
and contribution to these excellent results. I also
extend my personal thanks to Laurent Genthialon,
our Finance Director, who will be leaving H&T at
the end of March 2009 to return to continental
Europe, and welcome Alex Maby his successor.

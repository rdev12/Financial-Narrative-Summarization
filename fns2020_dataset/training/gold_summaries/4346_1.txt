 Our strong cash flow and
reducing debt places us in a
position to acquire attractive
and profitable businesses.
Even within recent weeks
we have seen a gradual
improvement in our markets.
Our focus this year has once
more been on organic growth
within all of our businesses.

Chief 
Executive’s 
Review
Charles Sinclair
Chief Executive Lord Rothermere has referred in his
statement to our improved profits, despite
difficult markets. The financial year started
well, but the expectation of war in Iraq
resulted in deteriorating conditions early
in 2003. Since the war ended, we have
seen a gradual improvement, with a
marked acceleration in recent weeks.
Our focus this year has once more been on
organic growth, with new exhibition launches,
extensions of Teletext on to new platforms,
the establishment of new radio stations
in Australia and the creation of a new
terrorism risk analysis model by RMS, to
name but a few. The best rewards to DMGT
shareholders have historically come from
internal developments, with Euromoney being
the ultimate example – an investment of some
£6,000 becoming an international business
with a market value in excess of £230 million.
We shall continue to seek opportunities
from within all our businesses.
We have continued to make selective
acquisitions where we could see good
returns and where this was the best way
into a market sector we wished to enter.
DMG Information acquired Property & Portfolio
Research, a Boston based company that
fits neatly alongside our existing property
information businesses, and Sitescope, a
competitor to DMGI’s UK property information
business, Landmark. Euromoney bought
HedgeFund Intelligence, the leading magazine
in this important sector of the financial markets.
It hopes to use its experience to take HFI
into related media forms.
However our total spend on acquisitions has
again fallen this year and, as a result, we have
been able to reduce our level of debt by almost
£50 million. We also took advantage of benign
market conditions in June 2003 to launch a
new long term Eurobond, raising £175 million
and substantially lengthening the maturity of our
debt. With our strong cash flow and reducing
debt, we are in a position to invest a quite
substantial amount in acquisitions, particularly
of profitable businesses, without stretching
unduly our own debt ratios. However this will
only happen if we find attractive opportunities.
We are also working on the cost side of
our businesses. One development over
the last two years has been the creation of a
centralised accounting centre for Northcliffe.
This operation is now beginning to perform
work, such as payroll services, for the
UK subsidiaries of other divisions. Similar
co-operation is happening in the United
States, where, for example, common medical
plans have been established. I hope that
this trend to shared services continues.
We continue to support our defined benefit
pension schemes for our UK newspaper
divisions. We still believe that these provide
the most appropriate pension provision for this
group of employees. Elsewhere in the Group,
we operate defined contribution plans, again
because we believe them most appropriate. 
Inevitably the financial position of our defined
benefit schemes has deteriorated over recent
years, but they remain in actuarial surplus and,
importantly, continue to have an excess of cash
inflows over cash outflows to finance benefit
commitments. The level of our contributions
to these schemes has risen with effect from
1st October, 2003, but remains a little below
the long term funding rate of the schemes. 
We have included this year an expanded
Corporate Social Responsibility review. DMGT
companies have always taken seriously their
social and environmental responsibilities, but
our divisional structure has meant that these
have not been centrally co-ordinated. We are
increasingly attempting to do this.
In the coming year, we will continue to look
for organic growth and for fill-in acquisitions,
using the strong cash flow from our businesses.
We will complete the expansion of our press
facilities, which should lead to increased profits
and a lower level of capital expenditure, thereby
allowing more rapid expansion by acquisition
or more rapid reduction of debt. 
I hope that you find the reviews interesting
and informative.

Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
Responding  
to changing client needs
This has been another good year for MITIE, with double-digit growth  
in revenues, operating proﬁt and EPS. 
But you probably know that already. The ﬁgures are well reported in the  
media and feature prominently throughout this report for all to see.
In this statement, I intend to focus on the story behind that success  
and how as an aspirational company, we achieve aspirational goals.

Overview
MITIE’s strength is that we never forget 
that we’re a service company – 
we deliver the everyday outsourced 
services that clients need in order to build 
their own businesses. Our broad scope 
and capabilities mean that we are the 
people responsible for everything from 
managing property estates and 
reducing energy consumption to 
providing engineers, cleaners and security 
officers, controlling pests, gritting roads 
and much more besides. 
We can do these things very efficiently, 
which is how we can save our clients 
money. Our approach starts with getting 
the speciﬁcation exactly right, and 
agreeing service levels with the client. 
Then, with contracts in place, we mobilise 
our teams very effectively. People transfer 
is complex and made even more so by 
legislation – but it is vital to get it absolutely 
spot on. Then we blend our experience 
and skills, innovative IT processes and 
industry-leading training and 
development to deliver exactly what 
we say we will deliver, exactly how we 
promised it. That’s why MITIE clients tend 
to stay MITIE clients, and why our business 
has grown for 23 consecutive years.
At all times, the markets are driven by 
our clients, as are we. The evolution of the 
outsourcing market is neatly encapsulated 
in the chart below – and what it shows, 
in a nutshell, is that the industry is on a long 
journey, from providing single services to 
bundled services and then, in some cases, 
more integrated services.
But what the chart doesn’t show is that 
each client is on a journey of their own. 
They are all at different stages, and they 
all  have dramatically different needs 
which are changing at their own 
individual pace. Life at MITIE is never dull 
because every day somebody asks us to 
do something different. It’s our job to meet 
those needs, as and when they change.

Social media gives our people a 
forum where they can discuss the 
things that matter most to them.

we go…
We’re there for our clients and 
support them with everything they 
need as they progress and develop.

The more things change…
The recession has been a major driver for 
change in our marketplace. Clients are 
restructuring and rethinking to reduce 
costs and they are turning to us for 
assistance. At the same time, they are 
looking to improve the way they manage 
energy, and taking advantage of our 
energy services offering, which helps cut 
carbon while also reducing costs. This is 
ensuring that in the UK, our core market, 
attractive opportunities for growth remain.
75% of our contract awards this year have 
come from the private sector and we 
are seeing a lot of activity at the moment. 
There is also a move towards more 
integrated facilities management – 
not only in the UK but also overseas. 
When clients tell us that they would like 
the MITIE services they enjoy in the UK to 
be available in other countries, we will 
do everything in our power to make it 
happen. Our relationship with Rolls-Royce 
is a case in point, where during 2010 we 
went from being a UK supplier to one 
who partners with them across Europe. 
The international opportunities for 
our business are growing fast and 
will continue to do so as we help more 
clients like Rolls-Royce be more efficient 
outside the UK. Around 40% of our top 
100 clients are multinationals, so the 
opportunity is clear, and we are actively 
looking at how we can support them. 
The acquisition of Dalkia FM in Ireland, 
which was ﬁnalised in June, is an 
important step along this pathway. 
Dalkia provides outsourcing solutions 
to clients in several different sectors and 
their experience has given us proven 
FM capability in a new territory.
In the public sector, budgetary pressures 
remain, which will create further 
opportunities for MITIE in the coming 
months and years. We are well-placed to 
support our public sector clients and have 
close working relationships with the 
Cabinet Office and other bodies. Local 
government, justice and health are just 
three of the sectors where we can see 
great opportunities. Indeed, several 
of these have already come to fruition, 
including the contract to provide a full 
custody and detention service at the 
Campsﬁeld House immigration centre. 
This is our ﬁrst contract in the prisons sector 
– and I am conﬁdent that we can go on to 
win many more.
The need for all organisations to use 
fewer natural resources is changing our 
marketplace, as our clients rethink the 
way they supply and consume energy. 
Energy management is, and should be, 
integral to facilities management and 
we have invested considerably in these 
capabilities – we are now one of the 
top two energy services companies in 
the UK. We believe energy services will, 
in time, be part of every contract we 
operate, and are well-positioned to 
take advantage of this opportunity.
…the more they stay the same
Entrepreneurial spirit has always been one 
of the qualities that makes MITIE different. 
It is part of our DNA and goes right back 
to the birth of the company. Examples 
of that entrepreneurship in action are 
everywhere – not only in the creative way 
we approach contracts, but also in the 
practical support we have given people 
to help them develop their careers and 
grow successful outsourcing businesses. 
Since 1988, we have consistently backed 
the idea of equity and opportunity with 
funds and support, and have helped 
over 80 successful start-ups in that time. 
In fact the acronym MITIE stands for 
‘Management Incentive Through 
Investment Equity’ .
During the year, we refreshed this idea 
by launching the ‘MITIE Entrepreneurial 
Programme’ , a £10m fund to back teams 
with innovative ideas for starting mutually-
owned businesses. The ‘MITIE model’ 
gives management teams an equity 
stake in a business, which they then grow 
over a ﬁve to ten-year period and which 
is eventually acquired by us in full.
Public sector 
opportunities
Budgetary pressures will create 
further opportunities for MITIE in the 
coming months and years.
Moving into  
new sectors 
We continue to identify 
opportunities in new markets, 
sectors and regions.

Our strategy
A strategy to deliver stakeholder 
value through a focus on sustainable, 
proﬁtable growth lies at the heart of our 
business and has done so for ﬁve years. 
The strategy has worked well and is largely 
unchanged, although each year the 
areas of focus can change. 
As we introduce new services and 
ways of delivering them in order to 
meet the changing needs of our clients, 
there will be an increased emphasis 
on entering new markets. In particular, 
we anticipate that energy-related 
services will be a growing focus for 
us over the next few years, as will our 
presence in overseas markets. Just as 
our clients are seeking to make their 
operations more efficient, so too are we, 
which is why we have added operational 
excellence as an element that underpins 
our strategy. We have made some 
changes to the KPIs we report to reﬂect 
these changes, and these can be found 
on pages 12–14. 
A strategy which underpins our customer proposition…  
Why MITIE?

We motivate our people by developing their careers and rewarding excellent 
performance

and broadest coverage across the UK, plus a growing European presence
We are experts at mobilising contracts 
We have sector specialists to tailor our services to speciﬁc industries
We use the best technology to provide the most efficient services 
We develop energy solutions that offer a secure and sustainable decentralised 
energy supply

We manage energy with our end-to-end CarbonCare offering

Focused on our people
Our new HR director, Katherine Thomas, 
is putting a spotlight on talent.
Giving our people a voice
We communicate with our 
people in the ways they are 
most comfortable with.
MiTec
Our new technology centre in 
Northern Ireland is a totally secure 
hub for remote monitoring.
Sustainability
MITIE has always been a responsible 
business and we focus our sustainability 
activities in seven areas which are aligned 
to our proﬁtable growth strategy. This is 
explained in detail on pages 36–38.
Investing in technology
We approach all our contracts from the 
perspective of partnership – we want to 
work with our clients, not just for our clients, 
and to win their trust in all that we do. 
Technology plays a key role here, 
because it enables us to show clients 
exactly what we are doing and when 
we are doing it, in real time.
For example, our MiWorld system allows 
a client to see everything from the 
temperature of a factory to the current 
status of an engineer visit or when the 
security guard last clocked on and off – 
it is all at the click of a mouse, on a 
dashboard on his or her PC. Such 
knowledge can highlight inefficiencies 
and duplications and create further 
opportunities to manage costs.
Handheld PDAs (personal digital assistants) 
are now used across our business, over a 
large number of sectors and service lines. 
The technology is designed to meet the 
diverse requirements of all our different 
contracts and is quick and easy to deploy. 
PDAs allow us to do operational tasks, 
including the scheduling of our mobile 
workforce, in a much more efficient way. 
For example, each month we use PDAs 
to conduct in excess of 1,400 audits and 
to schedule over 25,000 planned and 
reactive activities.
Supporting our people
The other way we build trust is through 
our people, all 61,906 of them. Most are 
based on-site and work at the sharp end 
of the business. Whether they are facing 
our clients each day, or working behind 
the scenes, we work hard to engage and 
develop all of our people.
Communication with so many people 
on so many different sites, many of them 
working shifts, can be a real challenge. 
Just as we deliver services in the way 
that our clients want them delivered, 
so we also communicate with our people 
in the ways that they’re most comfortable 
with. In addition to all of the traditional 
methods of communication, that 
means social media – and in particular 
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. 
Our view is that these sites give our 
people an important forum where they 
can discuss the things that matter most 
to them. We take on board what people 
are saying, and when issues are raised 
we always respond.
In October 2010, we appointed 
Katherine Thomas as our new group 
HR director. She brings a wealth of 
experience to the role, having previously 
worked at BT as group talent and 
leadership director, and has already 
begun to formalise our people agenda. 
We now have a more structured 
approach to HR issues, with a clear vision 
for where we want to be in 2014, with an 
emphasis on issues such as recruitment 
and retention, talent management, 
succession planning and leadership 
development.

In 2010 we launched the ﬁrst MITIE 
graduate programme. We also 
established a Diversity and Inclusion 
Steering Group with the purpose of 
strengthening our commitment to 
achieving equality, diversity and inclusion 
in the workplace and community.
The consistent hard work of our people 
was recognised in the form of a number 
of awards throughout the year. Our Real 
Apprentice scheme was the winner in the 
innovation category at the ﬁrst European 
Employee Volunteering Awards. The 
groundbreaking programme helps to 
break down barriers and get the long-
term unemployed and people with 
a physical or mental disability back into 
the world of work. At the other end of the 
spectrum, we were recently awarded 
Global Supplier of the Year by Rolls-Royce. 
These are just a sample of the enormous 
achievements of our people which 
regularly attract industry recognition.
.
Looking Forward
These are very good results and this 
year we have been awarded a number 
of transformational contracts. We have 
secured some signiﬁcant work in the 
private sector where we have excellent 
relationships with our clients and are 
differentiated by our energy services 
capabilities and use of technology. 
We have been appointed to several 
large public sector frameworks and 
have a strong pipeline of opportunities 
in local government, social housing, 
justice and health.
The opportunities in outsourcing and 
energy services in the UK and abroad 
are signiﬁcant. Our strong balance 
sheet and excellent cash conversion, 
as well as a record order book and sales 
pipeline, will enable us to achieve our 
growth aspirations. The business is well 
positioned for continued sustainable, 
proﬁtable growth.
Finally, I’d like to place on record my 
thanks to all the people who have 
made MITIE what it is today. It’s your drive, 
expertise, passion and, at times, great 
sense of humour that underpins what 
we do. It has been a real privilege to work 
alongside you all during the year.

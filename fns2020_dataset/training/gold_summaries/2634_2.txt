Burren at a glance
 Caspian
The Nebit Dag PSA area  
(1,050 km²) is located onshore  
in western Turkmenistan and 
contains five developed oil and 
gas fields. Burren has production 
rights to the Burun field, at the 
western end of the area, as 
operator with a 100% working 
interest. The other four fields within 
the PSA area (Kyzl Kum, Kum Dag, 
Kara Tepe and Nebit Dag) are 
operated by the state oil company 
Turkmenneft. Burren has 
exploration rights over the rest of 
PSA area under an exploration 
licence which expires in February 
2007. The PSA term runs until 2022, 
and may be extended for a further 
10 years by mutual agreement with 
the Turkmenistan government. 
Burren has been the operator of  
the PSA since 2000.
At the end of 2005, the Burun field 
was producing approximately 
19,000 bopd from 135 wells. 
Development to date has been 
primarily on the north flank of the 
field whilst the south flank remains 
to be appraised. Prior to 2004, well 
activity consisted of workovers to 
return shut-in wells to production. 
Development drilling commenced  
in 2004. Average working interest 
production during 2005 increased 
by 35% to 15,410 bopd (2004: 
11,430 bopd).
Gas-lift is now installed on most of 
the Burun field wells. Oil separation, 
treatment and storage facilities were 
upgraded during 2005. A pilot water 
injection scheme is expected to be 
implemented during 2006 which,  
if successful, will be rolled out 
across the field to provide reservoir 
pressure support and enhance oil 
recovery rates.
Burun crude is a light high quality 
low sulphur crude with an API 
gravity of 33º. Burren has 
unrestricted rights to the export of 
its share of crude, which is sold on 
an FOB basis from Turkmenistan 
Caspian Sea ports.
Exploration drilling outside Burun 
began in late 2005 and is expected  
to continue throughout 2006.
The Kouilou and Kouakouala 
licence areas, located onshore 
along the Atlantic coast of the 
Republic of Congo (Brazzaville), 
extend over an area of about 
2,600 km² and contain three 
producing fields: M’Boundi, 
Kouakouala and Pointe Indienne, 
of which M’Boundi is by far the 
largest. The operator in each case 
is Maurel & Prom, the French 
independent oil company. Burren 
has a 35% interest in the Kouilou 
licence that includes the M’Boundi 
field and a 25% interest in 
Kouakouala. In 2005 Burren entered 
into an agreement to sell a 3.5% 
interest in M’Boundi to the state oil 
company SNPC, this transaction is 
still  subject to ratification by the 
Congolese parliament. Burren has 
entered into an agreement for the 
sale of its interest in the insignificant 
Pointe Indienne field which was also 
sold to the operator Maurel & Prom 
subject to government approval.
Recent appraisal and development 
activity has centred on the M’Boundi 
field where production as at the end 
of 2005 was 57,340 bopd from 39 
wells. 24 wells were drilled in 2005, 
of which 20 were brought into 
production, with four rigs in 
operation. The capacity of the oil 
processing facilities at M’Boundi is 
being expanded to handle gross 
field production of 90,000 bopd  
and a 60,000 bwpd water injection 
scheme will be initiated during  
H2 2006. 
The Kouakouala field was producing 
1,100 bopd from four wells at the 
end of 2005. The Kouakouala 
development licence expires in 2008 
and may be extended by mutual 
consent for a further five years. Total 
Burren working interest production 
in Congo averaged 15,970 bopd  
in 2005, an increase of 135% 
compared with 2004.
The fields are connected by 
pipelines to the Total-operated 
export terminal at Djeno on the 
Atlantic coast, a distance from 
M’Boundi of about 40 km, where 
the crude is blended for export. The 
M’Boundi and Kouakouala crudes 
are very light low sulphur crudes 
with an API gravity of around 40º. 
An exploration programme over 
prospects within the Kouilou licence 
area commenced in Q1 2006 with 
up to six exploration wells planned 
during the year.
Parliamentary approval ratifying 
Burren’s 37% interest in the 2,830 
km² La Noumbi licence, which lies 
adjacent to and north of the Kouilou 
block, is expected during 2006. The 
first actions following approval will 
be to acquire 2D seismic data over 
leads and prospects.

06 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
In February 2005 Burren 
purchased a 26% stake in 
Hindustan Oil Exploration 
Company (‘HOEC’), an 
independent Indian E&P 
company listed on the Mumbai 
stock exchange. 
HOEC’s main focus of activity  
is in the Cauvery basin offshore 
Chennai where it holds interests  
of 100% in the undeveloped PY-1 
gas field, 80% in an adjacent 
exploration block (CY-OSN-97/1) 
and 21% in the producing PY-3 oil 
field. In addition, HOEC is operator 
of other onshore production and 
exploration licences in Assam and 
in the Cambay basin, Gujarat. 
Preparations for development and 
exploration drilling in Cauvery and 
negotiations with the Tamil Nadu 
Electricity Board (TNEB) for a long-
term gas contract for PY-1 gas  
are continuing.
Burren’s right to acquire the 
shareholding in HOEC is subject to 
legal challenge by Hardy Oil & Gas 
Limited which alleges that it has 
rights of pre-emption in relation to 
the sale of shares. The existence of 
such rights and the validity of the 
agreement purported to give rise to 
such rights are disputed by Burren.
Egypt: Burren has interests in three 
blocks, East Kanayis (4,300 km² 
onshore Western Desert), North 
Hurghada Marine (240 km² shallow 
water Gulf of Suez) and North Lagia 
(1,460 km² onshore northern Gulf  
of Suez basin). The award of the 
North Lagia block is still awaiting 
parliamentary ratification. Burren’s 
working interest is 100% in all blocks 
except North Lagia (90%).
The East Kanayis block is believed  
to contain both Cretaceous (oil) and 
Jurassic (gas and condensate) 
prospects. Immediately to the east  
lies a chain of producing Cretaceous 
oilfields, and other discoveries have 
been made in the surrounding areas, 
notably to the west where Apache  
has found significant quantities of gas. 
Exploration drilling commenced in 
March 2006, initially targeting small 
prospects in the Cretaceous horizons. 
3D seismic will be acquired in 2006 to 
delineate deeper Jurassic prospects.
The North Hurghada Marine block lies 
along a trend of oil and gas fields from 
Zeit Bay and Geisum to the north to 
the large Seabird field to the south-
east. Water depths are less than 50 
metres. Burren intends to acquire 3D 
seismic over part of this block.
The North Lagia block contains four 
producing fields (all excluded from  
the licence awarded to Burren). The 
existing dataset indicates the possible 
presence of several structures, but 
data acquisition will be necessary  
to delineate these.
Yemen: Burren has a 92% operated 
working interest in Block 6, an 
onshore area of 3,911 km², The  
PSA was signed in December 2005 
and is subject to parliamentary 
ratification. Block 6 is located in the 
prolific Shabwa basin and lies between 
the major oil and gas producing areas 
to the west, previously operated by 
Hunt, and Block S2 to the east 
operated by OMV.
Burren intends to acquire 3D seismic 
data over the southern part of the 
block during 2006 with a view to 
exploration drilling in 2007.
Oman: Burren has a 40% non-
operated interest in offshore  
Block 50 (16,690 km²), operated  
by Hunt Oil. The farm-in agreement 
was signed in January 2006 and is 
subject to government approval. 
Block 50 is located in the Masirah 
Basin, which demonstrates  
similarities to the prolific oil and gas 
basins onshore Oman, with water 
depths of up to 100 metres. A 2D 
seismic programme is intended in 
2006 to plan for a drilling programme  
in 2007.

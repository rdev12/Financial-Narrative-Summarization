CEO’s	Review
I am delighted to have joined Xtract 
Energy at such an exciting stage in 
its development. 
I very much look forward to getting to 
know our shareholders, the various 
management teams around the 
world, our partners and our people, 
and most importantly I look forward 
to delivering our shared aspirations.

Meo AustrAliA liMited (Meo)
Xtract Energy’s investment 
story in MEO is an example of 
successfully implementing the 
company’s strategy of identifying 
and supporting early stage energy 
sector projects with significant 
growth potential. With the benefit 
of Xtract Energy’s financial and 
strategic support, MEO has been 
able to further develop and progress 
its business plan over the last 
eighteen months.
During the quarter ended 
September 2006, Xtract Energy’s 
wholly owned subsidiary Cambrian 
Oil & Gas plc (COIL) acquired a 
substantial shareholding in MEO 
through on market trades and 
a share placement at A$0.225 
(Australian Dollars) per share. 
Subsequent to this placement, 
and the exercise of approximately 
28.6 million options at A$0.250 
per share in April 2007, COIL 
increased its shareholding in MEO 
and currently holds approximately 
21.3 per cent. 
The MEO business plan is centred 
on the development of gas-
to-liquids (GTL) projects in the 
Australian waters of the Timor Sea, 
approximately 275 km northwest 
of Darwin, in an area known as 
Tassie Shoal. The company has 
secured Australian Commonwealth 
Government environmental 
approvals for two large-scale 
methanol plants (1.8 mtpa) and an 
LNG plant (3 mtpa) that are valid 
until 2052. 
Tassie Shoal is an area of shallow 
water adjacent to the Evans Shoal 
gas field and is located around 25km 
east of MEO’s exploration permit, 
NT/P68. MEO has identified five 
large structures in NT/P68 and has 
estimated that the total potential gas 
in place of the permit’s prospects 
and leads could exceed 14 tcf. Two 
of these structures were intersected 
by the Heron-1 well drilled in 1972, 
confirming gas columns. The 
resources potentially contained in 
NT/P68 provide significant valuation 
upside by potentially providing a 
feedstock for the GTL projects as an 
alternative to existing third party gas 
supply from nearby resources.
tAssie shoAl Gtl ProJects MEO’s Tassie Shoal GTL projects 
which have been designed to share 
infrastructure, logistic support 
systems, provide significant process 
synergies and many operational 
advantages. Tassie Shoal provides 
an enviable offshore location, 
not only in terms of development 
economics, but also proximity to 
rapidly expanding markets and 
strong demand for GTL products 
such as methanol and LNG in North 
East Asia. 
The Tassie Shoal Methanol Project 
(TSMP) proposes the phased 
construction of two 1.8 mtpa 
methanol plants, and includes:
Natural gas supply pipelines from 
the sub sea gas production well 
heads to Tassie Shoal; 
Methanol production plant and 
utilities mounted on a concrete 
gravity base structure (GBS), 
which also contains methanol 
storage tanks; 
Accommodation and control 
platform adjacent to the 
production facilities connected 
by bridge-link; and
A single point mooring (SPM) 
system for loading methanol into 
export tankers.
MEO and Air Products and 
Chemicals, Inc. continue to develop 
the TSMP under the terms of the 
joint development agreement 
executed in 2004.
MEO’s proposed Tassie Shoal LNG 
Project is designed to have the 
capacity to produce 3 mtpa of LNG 
and includes:
Natural gas pipelines from 
the supply gasfield and the 
associated gas production 
facilities; 
Conventional nickel steel LNG 
tank constructed on a gravity 
base structure (GBS), sited in an 
approximate seawater depth of 
14 metres;
LNG process module constructed 
on a self installing platform;
Open sea jetty or Calm Buoy 
system for loading LNG into 
export tankers; and
Seawater cooling system for LNG 
production process.

Arrival into Darwin harbour of the West Atlas jack-up rig 07 Xtract	Energy			 Annual	Report	2007
Appraisal of gas resources  
in NT/P68
Heron-1 (drilled in 1972) 
encountered a 52 metre gas-
bearing zone within the Darwin 
Formation on the Epenarra 
structure, which is a broad, flat 
anticline with a mapped closure 
exceeding 1,200 km
2
. MEO has 
estimated a potential gas-in-
place Contingent Resource of 
5.6 tcf (P50) for Epenarra. MEO 
has successfully completed the 
acquisition of new 3D seismic data 
over Epenarra. MEO estimates 
a further 5.5 tcf (P50) gas in 
place Contingent Resource in the 
underlying Heron North and Heron 
South Elang/Plover Formation 
structures. The 3D seismic data 
displays a flat event in the Elang/
Plover Formation that MEO believes 
may be indicative of the gas-water 
contact. The maximum gas column 
height within these structures is 
estimated at over 300 metres. 
Heron-1 intersected a gas charged 
sand towards the base of the well 
in the deeper structures. MEO 
intends drilling up to three wells 
(Heron-2, Heron-3 and potentially 
Blackwood-1) in the permit area. A 
new jack-up rig (the West Atlas) has 
been contracted to undertake the 
appraisal drilling which commenced 
as expected in October 2007.
Note: MEO defines “P50” as a 
probabilistic indicator used to 
quantify contingent and prospective 
resources where the low risk 
estimate is assessed as P90, the 
mean estimate is assessed as 
P50 and the high risk estimate is 
assessed as P10 in the relevant 
category. MEO defines “Contingent 
Resource” as those resources 
which relate to quantities of 
petroleum (oil or gas) which are 
estimated, on a given date, to be 
potentially recoverable from a known 
accumulation but which are not 
currently considered to be proven or 
commercially recoverable. 
As an ASX listed company, MEO 
is not subject to the AIM Rules 
and the references to Contingent 
Resources and resources are not 
reported against a “Standard” nor 
reviewed by a “qualified person” as 
defined and required by the AIM 
Guidance Note for Mining Oil & 
Gas companies.
New farm-in partner
In addition to its equity raising 
activities during the year, MEO 
was able to secure a farm- in 
partner to provide additional 
funding and technical expertise 
for the current drilling programme. 
Petrofac Resources Limited 
(Petrofac) farmed into NT/P68 
by agreeing to meet 25 per cent. 
of the well programme appraisal 
drilling costs to earn a 10 per 
cent. interest, with an option to 
increase the interest to 15 per 
cent. by funding 37.5 per cent. of 
the well costs.
Petrofac has also been granted 
an option to participate in the 
proposed Tassie Shoal GTL 
projects at the same equity 
participation level as the NT/P68 
farm-in. Petrofac’s participating 
interest in the methanol project 
would reduce Air Product’s 50 
per cent. interest (MEO will retain 
its current 50 per cent. interest). 
Petrofac’s participating interest 
in the LNG project would reduce 
MEO’s current 100 per cent. 
interest. Petrofac would earn its 
interests in the GTL projects by 
contributing to the initial front-end 
engineering and design (FEED) 
costs and paying a net profit 
interest royalty to MEO from the 
Petrofac share of the project’s 
eventual operating profits.
Petrofac brings strong engineering, 
procurement, construction and 
operational expertise to the 
NT/P68 joint venture ahead of the 
drilling programme. Following the 
completion of the 2007 drilling 
campaign and approval of the 
2008 work program, Petrofac will 
assume the role of permit operator 
to manage the subsequent 
full appraisal of any resources 
confirmed in the permit and would 
operate the eventual upstream 
hydrocarbon production facilities.
MEO has been a very successful 
investment to date for shareholders 
in Xtract Energy. Clearly, the drilling 
programme currently underway 
will be critical to the future value of 
the MEO business and we will be 
watching developments eagerly.
ElkO ENErgy iNc. (ElkO)
As at the end of the reporting 
period, Xtract Energy had an 
interest in approximately  
32 per cent. of the issued capital 
of Elko (which is held through 
wholly owned subsidiary COIL), a 
Canadian oil and gas exploration 
company formed in 2005. Elko’s 
exploration and appraisal activities 
are guided by a management team 
with many years of technical and 
commercial experience in the oil 
and gas industry. Elko’s area of 
focus covers North West Europe, 
North Africa and the Middle East.
In October 2005, Elko acquired 
an 80 per cent. interest in a 
5,370 km

proximity to the prolific Central 
Graben in the Danish North Sea. 
The licence covers 26 Danish 
licence blocks with a 6 year 
exploration term and 30 years for 
exploitation. Elko is an approved 
offshore operator in Denmark and 
has set up a Danish subsidiary 
to hold the licence. The current 
partnership is Elko (80 per 
cent.) and Nordsoen – a Danish 
government entity (20 per cent.). 
Elko has undertaken a programme 
of technical work that has 
confirmed the presence of eight 
structures with substantial potential 
reserves. Drilling is expected to be 
carried out in 2008. 
In early 2007, Elko applied for 
two off-shore blocks in the Dutch 
sector of the North Sea, both 
of which contain a number of 
drilled and tested gas bearing 
structures. Block P1 has now 
been awarded to a consortium in 
which Elko will be the operator 
and will retain 33 per cent. 
interest. Award of adjacent Block 
P2 is pending and discussions 
continue to secure additional 
acreage. The known gas 
discoveries were not developed 
by the original licencees for 
reasons likely to include low gas 
prices, low per well productivity, 
the carbon dioxide content of 
gas and better projects available 
to license holders at the time. 
Gas prices are now significantly 
higher, per well productivity has 
been resolved in adjacent block 
K17 through the use of modern 
horizontal drilling techniques 
and carbon dioxide removal 
has become proven offshore 
technology. Elko’s Dutch license 
partner Horizon Energy Partners 
BV was involved in the K17 
development project.
The development of both the 
Danish and Netherlands interests 
will require significant funding over 
the coming years. We believe 
that Elko’s technical expertise 
and Xtract Energy’s experience 
in fund-raising will be a powerful 
combination that will help deliver 
the projects and secure superior 
returns to shareholders.
In addition to its exploration assets, 
Elko owns 51 per cent. of Dragon 
Energy Inc. (Dragon), a private 
Canadian company. Dragon’s 
principal assets are a 30 per cent. 
share of the producing Kotaneelee 
gas field in Canada and a joint 
venture agreement in respect of the 
Ma-Ling oilfield in Gansu province, 
China. Most of the effort to date has 
been spent in obtaining the necessary 
permits at regional and national 
level to commence with operations. 
This process has taken much longer 
than expected, but efforts are 
underway to move the permit 
process forward during next year.
Subsequent to the period end, 
Xtract Energy (through COIL) 
participated in a private equity 
placement in Elko, following which 
COIL increased its total holding to 
21.8 million shares, representing 
approximately 36.5 per cent. of 
the issued capital of Elko.
WAsAbi ENErgy liMitEd 
(WAsAbi)
Xtract Energy currently holds 
approximately 34.5 per cent. 
of Wasabi, an Australian listed 
company with interests in both 
traditional and clean energy 
technologies and businesses. In 
many ways Wasabi can be seen as a 
microcosm of Xtract Energy, and has 
been going through a similar period 
of restructuring. There are a number 
of developments that we consider to 
be particularly promising.
Global Geothermal Ltd (GGL)
In August 2007, Wasabi completed 
a number of agreements leading to 
the formation of GGL, a joint 
venture with AMP Capital Partners 
LLC (AMP), a U.S. based private 
equity fund. Under the terms of the 
agreements, GGL acquired from AMP 
a Delaware corporation, Recurrent 
Engineering LLC, that is focused on 
the delivery of highly efficient 
geothermal and waste heat power 
stations and technology and which 
was granted an option over Wasabi’s 
shareholding in Exergy Inc, owner of 
rights over the patented Kalina Cycle 
technology for which Recurrent 
Engineering is world wide licensee. 
Kalina Cycle technology has been 
developed since the 1980’s with 
numerous patents now in force 
worldwide. The Kalina Cycle is a 
process for converting heat to 
electrical power more efficiently and 
effectively than previous processes, 
using an ammonia/water mixture 
instead of water (Rankine Cycle) or 
organic fluids (Organic Rankine 
Cycle). It can be implemented using 
standard electrical power generation 
and refrigeration equipment  Xtract	Energy			 Annual	Report	2007 09
components as evidenced by the 
various Kalina power plants that have 
had operating experience to date.
These transactions bring together 
the necessary component parts 
to create a world-scale business 
and we look forward to its 
development during the next 
year. Wasabi’s current interest in 
GGL is 70 per cent..
Rum Jungle Uranium Ltd  
(Rum Jungle)
Wasabi’s subsidiary Rum Jungle 
is focused on exploration for 
economic uranium deposits in a 
variety of geological settings in the 
Northern Territory of Australia.  Rum 
Jungle’s approach to exploration 
is based on the known geological 
and geophysical characteristics of 
major uranium deposits like Ranger, 
Jabiluka and Rum Jungle and 
sedimentary style deposits, such as 
Angela.  Potential also exists for the 
presence of economic precious and 
base metal deposits associated 
with uranium mineralisation or, 
indeed, separate from uranium, 
providing further upside potential.
Rum Jungle’s exploration rights 
include Exploration Licenses 
24917 (Alice Springs) and 24939 
(Woolner Dome), acquired during 
the period. Due diligence was 
conducted on the Woolner Dome 
tenement, including reprocessing 
geophysical images obtained 
from data acquired after the most 
recent uranium exploration carried 
out in a joint venture between E.Z./
Peko and CRA in the late 1970’s. 
Rum Jungle completed a detailed 
airborne magnetic and radiometric 
survey around the Woolner Dome 
in early 2007 and plans to expand 
the survey area. Consultant 
geophysicists have identified 
several prospective structural 
targets and drilling is expected to 
commence in December 2007. 
Wasabi Energy announced the 
intention to list Rum Jungle on the 
Australian Stock Exchange, ASX, 
on 1 June 2007 and a prospectus 
has recently been issued to raise 
up to A$12 million (of which 
A$8 million is underwritten). 
Rum Jungle intends to use the 
funds raised from the offer to 
fund exploration projects and as 
working capital. The Northern 
Territory provides the dual 
opportunity of exploring in an 
area containing large uranium 
deposits as well as providing a 
stable environment offering secure 
development opportunity.
Aviva Corporation Ltd (Aviva)
Wasabi currently owns 
approximately 18 per cent. of 
Aviva, a company listed on the 
Australian Stock Exchange.
Following the deregulation 
of the Western Australian 
power industry in March 2006, 
prospects for Aviva have 
improved considerably. Aviva has 
positioned itself as an integrated 
energy company providing 
long-term certainty for the coal 
producers and power generators.
In February 2007, Aviva made its 
first international move, signing 
an agreement to enter into a joint 
venture over the Mmamantswe 
coal deposit in Botswana. A 
drilling programme targeting 600 
metres  began in June 2007. Aviva 
is confident that its integrated 
energy strategy can be translated 
successfully to Southern Africa. 
In addition to these three interests, 
Wasabi has an active pipeline of 
promising businesses in areas 
such as biodiesel and clean coal 
technologies. Whilst recognising 
that not all early stage businesses 
will ultimately succeed, we believe 
that Wasabi will continue to 
develop strongly, to the benefit of 
Xtract Energy shareholders.

A revised structural interpretation 
of the South Karagundai prospect 
and other exploration prospects 
and leads was completed after 
55 km of 2D seismic data and 
additional Gore Surveys were 
acquired in late 2006. Improved 
definition of the South Karagundai 
prospect has been achieved. This 
prospect remains the prime focus 
for COIL’s forward exploration 
programme and future drilling.
Several lines of 2D seismic were also 
run over the Pishkaran prospect to 
test the quality of seismic data that 
might be possible over the older rock 
sequence in this area and over a 
large positive Gore Survey anomaly 
over major parts of this prospect. 
In late 2006, a Gore Survey was 
completed over the Toktogul 
structure. A number of areas show 
positive indications of hydrocarbon 
presence at depth within the 
bounds of the large surface mapped 
Toktogul anticline.
A pilot water injection project 
commenced operations in  
May 2006. Water is injected into 
selected wells to displace oil in 
the reservoir towards adjoining oil 
production wells. Two oil wells have 
been converted to water injection

over twelve mining tenements in 
the Toolebuc-Julia Creek area of 
Queensland. (See ‘Julia Creek Oil 
Shale Project’ map on the right). 
The Julia Creek oil shale deposits 
are known to contain substantial 
quantities of kerogen which can 
be converted to oil. The oil shale 
deposits located within EPM’s 
14803 and 14806, at the location 
known as ‘The Pit’, were subject to 
detailed evaluation by CSR Limited 
(1968-1988) and more recently, in 
the early 1990’s, by CRA Exploration 
Limited. The investigations provided 
geological and analytical data to 
support in-situ resource calculations 
in an independent report by Nolan 
(Geology and Resources of Oil Shale 
within Intermin Farm-in Area, Julia 
Creek, North-western Queensland, 
Oct 2005) indicating up to 410 
million barrels of oil in situ extractable 
by conventional retorting methods 
and having an average Fischer 
Assay analysis of 74 litres /tonne.
GHD Pty Ltd in their report titled 
‘Julia Creek Independent Geological 
Assessment’ dated 9 January 2006, 
evaluated EPM 14806 beyond ‘The 
Pit’ area and identified a substantial 
area where the oil shale is close to 
the surface but below the oxidation 
zone and which is sufficiently well 
drilled to determine an additional 
inferred resource estimated as 415 
million barrels of shale oil in situ.  
Wide spaced drilling demonstrates 
that further extensive deposits of oil 
shale are present in the project area 
with Fischer Assay testing indicating 
in-situ oil levels ranging from 30 to 
110 litres per tonne as determined 
on dry oil shales.
The combined shale oil inferred 
resource in these two contiguous 
areas is estimated as 825 million 
barrels in situ. 
The oil shale at Julia Creek is a 
40-50 million year old sedimentary 
rock that contains kerogen, a 
solid hydrocarbon precursor. The 
hydrocarbon component can be 
extracted through a heating process 
(known as retorting), which results 
in the release of hydrocarbons as 
vapour. When the vapour cools, it 
becomes liquid oil and gas. 
Xtract Oil Ltd together with 
Monash University and the 
Commonwealth Scientific and 
Industrial Research Organisation 
of Australia (CSIRO) has designed 
and is operating an experimental 
programme to carry out 
extractions using representative 
oil shale samples and assess the 
key risks inherent in the process. 
Both Monash and CSIRO have 
the demonstrated capability to 
work on a project of this type and 
have an extensive track record 
of industry participation and in oil 
shale related research.
Initial validation tests have 
shown that the recovery of 
light crude oil products from 
the Julia Creek deposits may 
be much higher than could be 
achieved using conventional 
retort recovery techniques. The 
initial solvent extraction tests 
have demonstrated that recovery 
from Julia Creek shales could 
be approximately twice that as 
indicated by Fischer Assays.
This results in a doubling of the 
oil potential and an estimated in 
“Julia Creek oil shale deposits are known 
to contain substantial quantities of 
kerogen which can be converted to oil” 12 Xtract	Energy			 Annual	Report	2007
situ oil resource of over 1.6 billion 
barrels of oil (see table above).
Xtract Energy has also been granted 
an exploration permit encompassing 
the Nevis Valley oil shale deposits 
located in South Island, New 
Zealand. The permit, EP 40-805 
(10,450 ha), includes locations 
of known oil shale occurrences. 
The area will be investigated 
to determine the economic 
significance of the deposits.
The in-situ resources are the 
tonnage of oil shale, with a 40 l/t. 
cut-off and the theoretical quantity 
of shale oil which is within that 
tonnage of oil shale. The resources 
are categorised into:
Indicated Resources – comprise 
most of The Pit area because 
drill-hole spacing is usually one 
kilometre or between one and 
about 1.5 kilometres.  Correlation 
of the oil shales and main 
stratigraphic units is possible 
down-dip, from east to west 
across the area but trends are not 
uniform along a cross-section.  
The variation between bores 
is such that further information 
is required to increase the 
confidence of estimation of the 
quantity of oil shale present.   
The sub-crop of the oil shale 
units beneath the weathered 
zone require further delineation 
for accurate determination of 
oil shale resources.  Additional 
points of observation and/or more 
detailed assessment of variation 
°
of the oil shale units would be 
expected to raise the resources 
to Measured Resources category.
Inferred Resources - marginal 
to and down-dip from the 
Indicated Resources.  The 
present borehole spacing of two 
kilometres or more is sufficient 
only to prove the existence 
of oil shale at the localities 
and to infer the thickness 
and yield.  The continuation 
of those properties between 
the points of observation can 
only be inferred. Additional 
observation may be expected 
to increase the confidence level 
of the estimation of the in-situ 
resources and to raise at least 
portion of these resources to 
Indicated status.
Within those areas of oil shale 
resources, the density of oil shale is 
assumed to be 1.85 tonnes per cubic 
metre (t/m3) when dry; the same 
basis used for reporting oil yield.  The 
thicknesses and oil yields have been 
weighted over those areas to provide 
the averages quoted.  
The assessment conducted 
by Nolan & Associates Pty Ltd 
has verified the thickness and 
degree of continuity of the oil-
bearing strata and has allowed 
for categorization of Oil Shale and 
Shale Oil Resources according to 
the Australasian Code for Reporting 
of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves –  
The JORC Code – 2004 Edition.

Return of Capital
In July 2012 Booker Group plc issued £124m of shareholder equity to acquire Makro in the UK. Following the successful 
integration of Makro into the Group and a period of strong cash generation, the Board is proposing to implement a capital return 
to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of approximately £61m, based on the current issued share capital of 
the Company). It is proposed that this is achieved by the issue of a new class of “B” shares which shareholders will be able to 
redeem for cash. The return of capital requires the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the Annual General Meeting 
on 9 July 2014. Further details of the proposed return of capital will be set out in a circular to shareholders which will accompany 
the notice convening this year’s Annual General Meeting. We currently anticipate returning a similar amount to shareholders in July 
2015 and will provide an update on this at the 2015 Final Results announcement in May 2015, in light of circumstances prevailing 
at that time.

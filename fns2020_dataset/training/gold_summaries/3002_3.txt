 In the 52 weeks to 29 August 2009, the massive increase in commodity prices 
and the 40% uplift in the farm-gate milk price which had helped make the prior 
year a tremendously successful one for Carr’s were absent; indeed, both trends 
reversed. This particularly impacted the Group’s fertiliser business, the star 
performer in 2008, which swung into loss in 2009. Accordingly, Group pre-tax 
profit was substantially lower than in 2008, but it did remain comfortably ahead 
of that for 2007.

Financial Review 
In the year under review, revenue decreased by 6% to £350.0m (2008: 
£372.3m), pre-tax profit reduced by 45% to £7.0m (2008: £12.9m), and 
fully diluted earnings per share were 45% lower at 50.3p (2008: 91.2p). The 
great majority of the reduction in Group revenue and all the reduction in 
Group profit was attributable to fertiliser, which in 2008 had contributed 
£4.1m of pre-tax profit estimated to be of an exceptional trading nature 
due to the massive increases in raw material prices.
Assisted by a placing of ordinary shares to raise £2.6m (net) in September 
2008, total shareholders’ equity increased by 20% to £29.9m (2008: 
£25.0m), or 340p (2008: 298p) per share. 
Although net debt increased to £19.3m (2008: £17.4m), following payment of 
the £4.3m consideration for the acquisition of the Wälischmiller Engineering 
business, gearing reduced to 65% (2008: 70%). Net interest expense of £1.3m 
(2008: £1.6m) was covered 5.6 times (2008: 8.0 times) by Group operating 
profit of £7.3m (2008: £12.9m).
The result is stated after a retirement benefit 
charge of £1.6m (2008: £1.1m). Equity 
shareholders’ funds are stated after a retirement 
benefit obligation of £14.7m (2008: £16.6m), gross of tax, and £10.6m 
(2008: £11.9m), net of tax benefit. The reduction in retirement benefit 
obligation, computed in accordance with IAS 19, is due to contributions 
towards the past service deficit by the Company, better investment returns 
and lower inflation. 
Dividends
The Board is proposing an unchanged final dividend per share of 17.0p. 
If approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 January 
2010, the dividend will be paid on 15 January 2010 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 18 December 2009, with the shares 
going ex-dividend on 16 December 2009.
T ogether with the unchanged interim dividend per share of 6.0p, paid 
on 8 May 2009, the proposed dividends per share for the year total an 
unchanged 23.0p, covered 2.2 times (2008: 4.0 times) by basic earnings 
per share.

Outlook
The Agriculture Division will have to contend with the long-term declining 
trend in the number of UK milk producers, but it is anticipated that farm-
gate milk prices, which have fallen in the past year, will stabilise and therefore 
stimulate demand for agricultural products and in particular the Group’s 
branded feed products, Crystalyx and Aminomax. With fertiliser raw 
material prices stabilising and now much reduced from the peak in April 
2008 and with the lower sales in 2009, it is also anticipated that demand for 
fertiliser will improve, with a more favourable outlook on margins. 
The Food Division is expected to continue to suffer from market turbulence 
in the face of overcapacity and the impact of the recession on consumers of 
bread and biscuits, in particular. 
In the Engineering Division, the shortage of funding available to customers 
has delayed the placing of orders and, while the businesses have satisfactory 
order books, there will be gaps in the production programme in the first 
half of the year. The enquiry level remains buoyant across the nuclear, oil and 
gas sectors, which bodes well for the future. 
In the current year, in the context of extremely difficult markets, the Board 
expects trading in the Group’s principal activities to be broadly flat, other 
than for fertiliser, where a partial recovery is envisaged. Further out, the 
Board believes that Carr’s is well placed, having regard in particular to the 
long-term demand for agricultural products, the diversity of the Group’s 
activities and the Group’s well-invested facilities.

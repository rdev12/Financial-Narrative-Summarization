Building momentum
Innovation Group at a glance
We have been serving the worldwide insurance sector  
for over 20 years. Over that time we have come to believe  
that the business of insurance should be viewed and run  
as an end-to-end optimised, collaborative and integrated 
process, rather than a series of individual and unconnected 
actions. We apply this belief in all our work.
Our industry-leading business process and data services, our innovative and effective 
software products, our extensive repair networks, and our fixed price commercial models 
come together to give insurers market-leading cost efficiencies and the ability to provide 
a great customer experience.
Business process services
We offer an unrivalled and complete 
portfolio of software and services that can 
be deployed throughout a business, or on 
a service-by-service basis as required.
Our proven end-to-end solutions cover Policy 
& Fleet management; Claims, Incident & Risk 
management, as well as a full range of specialist 
services such as big data business analytics and 
fraud management.
Software
Our software business only develops software 
for the insurance market. We apply deep sector 
knowledge with an acute awareness of the 
challenges facing the industry, from changes 
in customer behaviour to the adoption of 
new technologies.
All of our software is designed to improve business 
agility, provide more flexible underwriting 
capabilities, enhance risk management and give 
customers a superior experience. 03

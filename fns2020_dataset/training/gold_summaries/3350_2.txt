“Charter’s results for 2008 show material growth compared with 2007 in terms of revenue, profit and earnings 
per share, and further demonstrate the progress which has been made in developing both ESAB and Howden. 
Since October 2008 there has been a marked deterioration in global economic and financial conditions which 
had led to reduced demand for ESAB welding consumables and equipment. Notwithstanding this slowdown, 
as we progress through 2009, we can take confidence from the global presence, market leadership positions, strong
technology and flexible cost bases of both ESAB and Howden, which are supported by Charter’s strengthened
balance sheet and positive long-term dynamics in the businesses’ key end-user segments. All of these we believe
will assist Charter to resume growth as and when economic and financial conditions improve.”

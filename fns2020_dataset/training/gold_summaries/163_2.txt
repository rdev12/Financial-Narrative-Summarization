HIGHLIGHTS

Bulyanhulu, Tanzania
234,786
Ounces of gold produced
A high-grade underground mine with a mine life  
in excess of 30 years 
We have moved to a mechanised mining method, with long 
hole stoping becoming the primary mining method. This will 
assist in the ramp up of the mine and is both safer and 
more cost effective than previous hand-held methods.
Buzwagi, Tanzania
210,063
Ounces of gold produced
A single open pit bulk tonnage operation with a mine  
life of five years
We have shortened the life of the mine so that we are 
mining only profitable ounces. Our five year plan now 
produces positive cash flow over each year of its 
remaining life.
Operational
North Mara, Tanzania
273,803
Ounces of gold produced
A high-grade open pit operation, transitioning to a  
dual open pit and underground operation with a mine  
life of nine years
We are moving forward with the creation of an underground 
operation at the Gokona pit. We believe that this will be 
more profitable than mining this deposit via an open pit 
and has a much lower impact on the community.

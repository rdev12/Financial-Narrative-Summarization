Statement
investment for future growth
We have made significant progress this year in developing the 
Group’s business through both investment and the effective 
execution of the Group’s consistent and proven strategy. The 
robust financial performance this year and the continuing 
strength of the balance sheet and cash flow provide 
confidence in the Group’s long term prospects.
After several years of strong underlying growth, the focus 
this year has been on the Group’s Investment for Growth 
programme, through which significant investments are 
being made across the Group’s businesses to establish a 
firm foundation for the next phase of future growth. The 
investment programme started last year and by 30 September 
2013 the Group had invested £4.4m in modern, enlarged 
facilities and new and efficient information systems. Additional 
senior management to strengthen the Group’s corporate 
development resources have added a further £1.1m to 
annual operating costs. This investment programme will be 
concluded during the next financial year and details of the key 
programme elements, together with an indication of the likely 
benefits that will flow to the Group over the coming years, 
are described later in this Report. 
Acquisitions remain an integral part of the Group’s growth 
strategy and we continue to see a promising pipeline of 
opportunities. Our strong track record for acquiring good 
quality businesses, investing in them and delivering value is 
founded on a disciplined approach to acquisitions. This year, 
uncertainties about future economic prospects have made 
vendors cautious and transaction processes have been 
lengthened. With an improving acquisition environment and 
additional corporate development resources in place, the 
Board remains confident that 2014 will be a successful year 
for converting opportunities into good value-enhancing 
acquisitions.
After the year end on 5 November 2013, contracts were 
signed for the acquisition of 80% of Kentek Oy, based in 
Finland, for a maximum consideration of £11.2m, extending 
the Seals businesses into new and emerging markets.
Results
Group revenue increased in 2013 by 10% to £285.5m (2012: 
£260.2m) driven by a strong performance from the Life 
Sciences businesses and benefiting from the contribution 
from acquisitions completed last year. The Seals businesses 
delivered modest underlying growth against strong prior 
year comparatives, while the Controls businesses reported 
a decline in underlying revenues given the difficult trading 
conditions in Europe, particularly in the first half of the year.

Strategic Report
Underlying Group revenues increased by 4%, after adjusting 
for the additional net contribution from acquisitions, the 
divestment last year of a small business in Switzerland and for 
currency movements on the translation of overseas results.
As anticipated, adjusted operating margins reduced to 19.0% 
(2012: 20.3%) from the record levels reported last year, largely 
reflecting the impact on operating costs of investing in the 
businesses. Adjusted operating profit increased by 3% to 
£54.3m (2012: £52.8m). 
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 3% to £54.3m (2012: 
£52.6m) and adjusted earnings per share, helped by a lower 
effective tax rate, increased by 5% to 34.8p (2012: 33.1p).
The Group continued to generate strong cash flow of £31.6m 
(2012: £32.7m), after both increasing capital investment in the 
businesses to £4.6m (2012: £3.5m) and making an exceptional 
cash contribution of £4.7m (2012: £Nil) to the Group’s 
Employee Benefit Trust. 
During the year, £17.4m (2012: £14.2m) was distributed to 
shareholders as dividends and with a much lower expenditure 
on acquisitions of £2.2m (2012: £22.3m), the Group’s net cash 
funds increased by £11.4m to £19.3m at 30 September 2013. 
Dividends
The strong balance sheet and free cash flow, supported by 
a solid set of results has led the Board to recommend an 
increase in the final dividend of 5% to 10.7p per share (2012: 
10.2p). Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, this dividend will be paid on 22 January 2014 to 
shareholders on the register at 29 November 2013. 
The total dividend per share for the year will be 15.7p which 
represents a 9% increase on 2012. The dividend is well covered 
by adjusted EPS at 2.2 times, in line with our objective of 
targeting towards a two times level of cover. 
Board development
I am very pleased with the progress we have made this year in 
developing and refreshing the Board and its Committees. This 
process started some 18 months ago following the Company’s 
admission to the FTSE 250 index. In November 2012, we 
welcomed Marie-Louise Clayton to the Board as a non-
Executive Director and I was delighted that John Nicholas and 
Charles Packshaw agreed to join the Board as non-Executive 
Directors in June 2013. These changes were in part brought 
about by the decision of John Matthews and Ian Grice to retire 
from the Board, having served as independent Directors for 
many years. During their tenure they have guided the 
Company through a period of significant growth and 
development and I am very grateful to both John and Ian for 
their wise counsel and for their substantial contribution to the 
success of the Group. 
I am confident that the refreshed Board has the right balance 
of skills, experience, capabilities, independence, diversity and 
knowledge required to lead the Company forward during its 
next stage of development. 
Employees
It is important to thank all our employees whose tremendous 
hard work has been a driving force behind our performance. 
Diploma is very much a people business and success is always 
a team effort. We continue to foster an entrepreneurial culture 
within our businesses which encourages all our staff to take 
responsibility for their own businesses. 
 
o utlook
The Group has a resilient business model with a good 
geographic spread of businesses, supported by a strong 
balance sheet and cash flow. We have made significant 
investments in the business this year, providing the resources 
and capacity to support our future growth in key markets and 
improve our ability to target and develop acquisitions.
Looking ahead, the investments we have made provide a 
strong platform for growth and the Board is confident that 
the Group will make further progress this year.

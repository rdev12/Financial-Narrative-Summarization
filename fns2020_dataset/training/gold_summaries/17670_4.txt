Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)
The EMEA region, by sales value, presently represents the 
largest	market	for	Zytronic	products	and	continues	to	exhibit	
good growth. sales into the UK still represent the largest single 
country entity within EMEA, but it is now closely followed by 
sales to Hungary. Direct product sales to EMEA countries are 
represented by a broad range of application uses, such as 
A TMs,	information	kiosks,	self -service	systems	and	jukeboxes.
Asia Pacific (“APAC”)
Sales	in	the	Asia	P acific	region	have	more	than	doubled	from	
those of 2007. A number of positive factors have driven this, 
including a growing deployment programme of ATMs in 
mainland China and an increase in Zypos sales to the digital 
signage and gaming market providers in both south Korea 
and T aiwan.

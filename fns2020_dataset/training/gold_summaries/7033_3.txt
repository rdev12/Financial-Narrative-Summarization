 10 Hamworthy plc Company overview
Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report on
another excellent set of trading
results for Hamworthy.
In the year to 31 March 2009
operating profit rose by 42.3%
to £23.0 million (2008 restated:
£16.1 million) with underlying
earnings per share
1
increasing
by 42.3% to 40.0p (2008
restated: 28.1p). Statutory
earnings per share increased
by 30.2% to 36.6p per share
(2008: 28.1p per share).
The closing order book was 16.5% lower at £260.4 million
(2008: £311.8 million) and order intake fell 22.1% to
£177.6 million (2008: £228.1 million). The Group remained
cash generative with closing net funds
2
of £55.5 million
(2008: £48.0 million).
We have made good progress on the strategy outlined in
last year’s annual report. Through a series of targeted efforts
Hamworthy’s progress towards sustainable double digit
operating margin remains on track. We have expanded
our presence in markets outside of new shipbuilding, such
as the offshore market, and we have continued to increase
the pace of investment in new technology particularly in
markets driven by environmental legislation. We have made
two acquisitions during the year and will continue to target
opportunities that will expand our technology base and
strengthen our market positions.
1 Calculated using earnings excluding loss on fair value movements in derivatives.
2 Calculated as the net of cash and cash equivalents less borrowings.

Company overview Business review Governance Accounts
Since the summer of 2008 we have experienced unprecedented
economic and financial conditions and we are seeing the
effects of this on our markets. The Group has been swift
to recognise these challenges and has carried out a detailed
planning exercise to identify and implement actions designed
to mitigate the effects of any potential reduction in demand.
As a result, the Group has already reduced its headcount
by 6%.
The Group maintains a healthy near-term order book and
has a strong balance sheet. We remain confident in the
long-term growth prospects of the markets that the Group
is targeting and are committed to strategies aimed at
delivering long-term shareholder value. Commensurately
we will continue to pursue a progressive dividend policy.
Your directors are therefore recommending a final ordinary
dividend of 5.68p per share, an increase of 7.4% on the
prior year of 5.29p. If approved, this would result in a 10%
increase in the total dividend declared in respect of the year
to 8.73p per share (2008: 7.94p). Subject to shareholders’
approval the final dividend will be paid on 23 July 2009
to all shareholders on the register on 26 June 2009.
On behalf of the board I thank all of our employees for their
contributions to another year of significant achievement.
Our employees play a critical role in the Group’s success
and we recognise that this will be particularly so in meeting
the challenges ahead. We remain committed to recruiting,
retaining and developing the best people.

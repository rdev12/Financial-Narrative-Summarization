cultivate deeper and wider commercial relationships across our clients’ organisations.  This approach enables us to collaborate more

in-depth knowledge of our clients’ businesses and the market challenges they face.

services to central government in areas such as error, fraud and debt. All these services are close to our existing capabilities and 
leverage our expertise in providing complex administration solutions in regulated or highly controlled environment to FTSE 350 
companies and Government. 
We have placed resources behind these growth plans and expect to make good progress over the medium term as we help clients 
respond to market and regulatory challenges. Our aim is to be the partner of choice in complex environments, creating lasting value for 
clients and improving service outcomes for end-users.
With continued market pressure to find efficiencies, 
companies and public sector institutions are increasingly 
looking for more effective solutions to non-core processes. 
Legislative changes are further increasing the administrative 
burden and complexity for organisations, particularly in the 
pensions, banking and financial services sectors.
We are focussed on unlocking the 
growth potential of the Group.
Building from a strong base, we have successfully expanded

The strong recurring contracted revenues which underpin our 
core operations have allowed us to invest in further service 
improvements, in new products and in value-added acquisitions. 
We will continue to actively extend our service range and market 
footprint organically and through strategic acquisitions. We also 
have a tight focus on cash conversion and on maintaining the 
quality of our recurring contract revenues.

I took up my position with Equiniti 
in January 2014 and am delighted to 
be joining the business at a time of 
accelerating investment and growth. I am 
grateful to my colleagues for the warm 
welcome I have received. I have been 
impressed with the energy and enthusiasm 
with which our teams serve their clients

Equiniti’s mission is the creation and 
implementation of intelligent solutions 
for complex administration tasks in the

Our 2013 performance evidences 
continuing revenue growth, with revenue 
of £274.7m (2012 in £266.5m) driven 
primarily by increased corporate action 
activity and demand for regulatory and 
compliance services, new sales and 
income from new revenue lines including 
international payments. New sales and contract renewals of

commercial solutions business has broadened its range of solutions 
provided to Government and our employee share dealing capability 
has been augmented through the acquisition and successful 
integration of the Killik Employee Services now renamed Equiniti 
Premier. Investment has continued in the creation of a common 
operational platform, with customer contact and bulk mail and print 
now co-ordinated by a single business-wide function. Further work

our IT operations and support functions in Chennai, India, where 
up to 450 specialist staff are now based in a new custom-built 
facility. This capability enables testing and development activities to 
progress over an extended time window and reduces product cycle 
times and development costs.
The outlook for 2014 is positive. Increased corporate activity is 
expected to accelerate growth in our core registration market, 
supported by a strong sales pipeline across the entire service 
portfolio. We are delighted to complete the acquisition of 
Pancredit in March 2014 which strengthens our capabilities in loan 
servicing. Additionally, work is underway to identify and integrate 
businesses with complementary capabilities and it is anticipated 
that acquisitions will further support our underlying growth.
A business succeeds through the strength of its people and I offer 
my thanks and heartfelt appreciation to our talented and dedicated 
teams who have worked tirelessly to make 2013 a success. Together 
we can look forward to 2014 with enthusiasm and with optimism.

W o r k i n g	o n	a	p r o j e c t	a s	h i g h	p r o fi l e

p r o j e c t	s t a r t e d ,	a	l o t	o f	t h e	fi n e r	d e t a i l s	
needed to be established, including 
around the Employee Priority Offer and 
exactly how Royal Mail employees would 
be awarded 10% of the business in shares. 
So we had to work simultaneously on 
four different scenarios, until our client, 
the Government, chose to use the Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP). Following this, I was 
the lead on the employee share plan 
dealing, so I worked closely with different 
Royal Mail work streams to coordinate 
the process. 
In addition to written communications, we 
participated in drop-in clinics over a three-
week period at 109 Royal Mail sites. To 
accommodate employees’ shift patterns, 
we worked with Royal Mail representatives 
to hold these clinics from early in the 
morning until late in the evening. In total 
we saw around 8,000 people.
This project went really well and we have 
had some great feedback from our client. 
This was the biggest IPO we have worked 
on in a very long time and the success of 
it is sure to open doors for us.
Claire Vaughan, Senior IT 
Project Manager 
The IT team was made up of a number 
of workstreams to deliver the systems 
supporting this project. It was vital that 
milestones were met in each area to 
provide an integrated system solution 
for each stage of the offer. This meant 
working closely with many internal 
and external workstreams, as well as 
multiple third-party suppliers to establish 
timelines, implement infrastructure, 
coordinate data exchanges and align 
delivery of various components.
We provided the marketing and 
application websites, which needed to 
cater to high volumes of users and surges 
in demand. As well as the websites that 
the public and Royal Mail employees 
used, there was also a great deal of work 
going on to provide back-end systems. 
We needed to deliver solutions to scan 
paper applications received and capture 
the PDF applications downloaded from 
the website. We also had to make sure 
our systems provided the functionality 
to reconcile the applications and online 
payments, apply the correct allocations

CASE STUDY: ROYAL MAIL GROUP
Equiniti did more than successfully handle 
the privatisation of Royal Mail. It also opened 
doors for the future.

initial public offerings (IPO) to come to 
market in recent years and was supported 
by services from Equiniti. 
Equiniti was selected by Royal Mail 
Group and the Department for Business, 
Innovation & Skills, following a competitive 
tender process, to provide services 
above and beyond share registration in 
support of the IPO. These covered acting

including the allocation of free shares and 
the Employee Priority Offer, the issue 
and allocation of shares following the IPO, 
associated dealing services and ongoing 
share registration.
Drop-in clinics were 
held at 109 Royal

Here are five different Equiniti perspectives on the project and 
what it meant for them to be involved.

140,000 calls in a single 
month – an increase 
of nearly 90% on the 
monthly call level
This was the biggest 
online share offer that 
we have ever done and 
great teamwork and 
dedication ensured  
its success.

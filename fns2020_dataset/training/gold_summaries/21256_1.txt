REFLECT THE ROBUST PERFORMANCE  
OF UNDERLYING BUSINESSES, BALANCE 
SHEET STRENGTH, EFFICIENCY GAINS 
AND STRONG PROFITABILITY IN SPITE  
OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH 
THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE YEAR. 
Economic growth in Georgia, which has for  
a number of years been a tailwind for us, was 
lower than expected and resulted in a slower 
start to the year. However, we witnessed a 
significant pick-up in business activity after the 
Presidential elections in October 2013, which 
saw the candidate of the ruling Georgian 
Dream Party win a landslide victory. GDP 
growth was estimated at 1.7% for the first 
nine months of 2013, but picked up after  
the elections to reach 7.1% in the fourth 
quarter. The future also seems optimistic  
as the IMF forecasts 5% GDP growth in 
2014. The state budget was run at a surplus 
for the first nine months of 2013. In Q4 2013, 
in order to reach the target level of deficit for  
the year, spending accelerated particularly  
on infrastructure projects, resulting in a large 
increase in the supply of Lari. This in turn 
caused a small correction in the GEL/US 
Dollar exchange rate. In February 2014, 
however, the Lari reversed some of its 
losses against the major currencies and 
started to appreciate. In 2013, the National 
Bank of Georgia (NBG) remained a net 
buyer of US Dollars, purchasing US$335 
million during the year.
In this letter, I would like to review 2013  
by highlighting certain key performance 
measures, analysing the drivers of the 
results and the underlying strategic 
initiatives that we believe are fundamental  
to our success. Our medium-term strategy 
continues to centre around the 3x20 story 
that aims at achieving a 20% growth rate  
in our loan book, 20% Return on Average 
Equity and a 20% Tier I Capital ratio.

Below, I will start with three strategic 
initiatives launched over the last several 
years, which are now driving the 
diversification of our revenue that  
shapes our performance.
Revenue Diversification
Payments business
We began implementing our Express 
Banking strategy in 2012 by rolling out 
small-format, Express branches offering 
predominantly transactional banking services 
to clients through ATMs and Express Pay 
Terminals. The aim was to make banking 
relationships simple, faster, cheaper and 
convenient for both our existing customers 
and for the emerging bankable population. 
A Self-Service Terminal can be described  
as a small bank by itself as it allows a wide 
array of payment services ranging from 
current account top-ups and loan 
repayments to utility bill payments and  
metro ticket purchases. In 2013, we installed 
764 new Express Pay Terminals throughout 
Tbilisi resulting in 985 total Express Pay 
Terminals as of the end of the year. We are 
now leaders in Georgia in the payment 
systems market. We have combined our 
travel card for the Tbilisi bus and metro (of 
which we are the sole provider) and our 
contactless card with a loyalty programme 
linked to the customer’s current account to 
create an “Express Card” and have issued 
over 240,000 such cards in 2013. At the end  
of the year we had more than 430,000 
Express cards outstanding. The effects  
of the successful execution of our Express 
Banking strategy are numerous and far 
reaching and are now expressed in our 
financial performance that I will be  
describing below.
Real Estate
Started in 2010 from bad loans, our real 
estate strategy was to transform those loans 
into a successful business, and the process 
has been a textbook case of turning a 
problem into an opportunity. Our m2 Real 
Estate operation, which develops real  
estate property previously repossessed  
by the Bank, had a 40% IRR in 2013  
and has become an integral part of the 
Bank’s mortgage strategy, supporting  
the mortgage loan book development. 
Healthcare
During the past few years, with a view  
to diversifying our revenue streams and 
growing our non-interest income, we have 
taken decisive steps to grow and vertically 
integrate our Insurance and Healthcare 
businesses. BGH and Aldagi are currently 
preparing to list Aldagi’s Healthcare-related 
business on an international stock exchange.
In 2013, Aldagi, our Insurance and Healthcare 
subsidiary, contributed 10.9% to our 
Company’s revenue and 12.0% to its profit. 
As a result mainly of these, but also of less 
visible strategic actions, we delivered another 
exceptional year in terms of profitability, 
despite the backdrop of a slower-growth 
economic environment. At 7.8%, NIM held 
up better than we expected, withstanding the 
downward pressure from excess liquidity 
throughout the year that was largely a function 
of the subdued loan demand prevailing for 
most of the year. We attribute the resilience 
of our NIM to a number of factors, including 
our established market leadership that 
translates into superior distribution capability 
and pricing power. The most important 
contributor to our strong NIM in 2013, 
however, was the markedly reduced Cost  
of Funding. In the first half of 2013, we 
substantially reduced deposit rates, which 
significantly drove down our overall Cost of 
Deposits from 7.3% to 5.6%. It is important 
to note, however, that these deposit rate 
cuts have not compromised the inflow of 
deposits as the client deposit balances 
increased by 18.5% year-on-year. In 
addition, despite the lower deposit rates 
offered by the Bank compared to the 
market, our market share in retail deposits 
declined by only 0.7%. We consider these 
developments to be a true testament to the 
strength of our franchise and the brand 
name of our company. The reduction of 
deposit costs, combined with the superior 
access to capital markets demonstrated  
by the issuance of the 2017 Eurobond tap  
of US$150 million, enabled us to price the 
oversubscribed placement with a low 
interest rate level of 6.125%. Last, but  
not least, the increase in current account 
balances was made possible by the roll-out 
of the Express Banking strategy. Compared 
to last year, Retail Banking current account 
balances grew by GEL 89.6 million, up by 
45.7%. We intend to continue decreasing 
our Cost of Funding, one of the main 
competitive advantages and central to our 
profitability. Our Express Banking strategy  
is expected to further increase our current 
account balances – the cheapest source of 
funding. In addition, our superior access to 
capital markets will enable us to maintain our 
flexibility in optimising our liability structure. 
Cost Control
2013 was the fourth straight year that we 
have combined business growth with 
improved efficiency as evidenced by a 
declining Cost to Income ratio. This year, 
our revenue growth of 9.5% compares to 
2.0% growth of our operating expenses, 
certainly a result of the overall vigilance with 
our costs across the board. More importantly, 
the improved efficiency is linked to our 
Express Banking strategy. We became  
a formidable player on the retail market 
through expansion by means of low-cost 
Express branches that has paved the way 
for transactional banking. The existing 
full-scale branches are now focusing on 
offering value-added products, while 
technology-intensive Express branches 
enable us to offer basic banking products 
and services at minimal cost. In addition, 
one of the strategic objectives of Express 
Banking, which is to bring the previously 
un-banked/emerging bankable population 
to Bank of Georgia, is now bearing fruit.  
The tailor-made products and services that 
became accessible for our new clients at 
our Express branches is a powerful and 
low-cost client acquisition method. In 2013, 
the number of new clients joining the Bank 
exceeded 190,000, up 18% from last year. 
Our improved cost efficiency is one of the 
main reasons our banking operation was 
able to service its substantially increased 
client base without growing its headcount, 
which focuses on IT and remote banking 
services. On a stand-alone basis, Bank of 
Georgia’s full-time employees decreased  
by 4.3%.
Going forward, cost discipline will remain  
a main focus. We are targeting to reduce 
our Cost to Income ratio to approximately 
37% in the next three years. We believe the 
Express Banking strategy will be the main 
contributor to the further improvement.  
The development of Express Technologies 
will allow us to scale up the business with 
minimum operating costs.

Loan Book Growth and Improving  
Asset Quality
The strength and the efficiency of this 
growing franchise is the cornerstone of our 
solid competitive position and is also linked 
to our ability to grow our loan book in the low 
loan demand cycle in 2013. As the largest 
bank in the country, Bank of Georgia is best 
positioned to benefit from the de-dollarisation 
trends that have translated into a pick-up of 
Lari denominated credit growth. In addition, 
our competitive strength on the liability side 
as evidenced in the ability to reduce funding 
costs without compromising deposit funding, 
allowed us to achieve 13.9% loan book growth 
that cost us 130 bps on the Loan Yield, 
which compares to the 170 bps reduction  
of our Cost of Deposits. The result was that 
we didn’t compromise our profitability as 
demonstrated by the continuing strength  
of our NIM. We are constantly keeping a 
watchful eye on asset quality by following 
prudent risk management policies. Strongly 
supported by our diversified loan book,  
our NPLs grew by only 14.7%, comparing 
favourably to the loan book growth rate.  
Our Cost of Risk for the year stayed at the 
top of our targeted range at 1.4%, while  
our Q4 2013 Cost of Risk of an annualised 
0.9% was a noteworthy improvement over 
the Q3 2013 Cost of Risk of 1.6%, also 
attributable to the slowdown of the  
economy in the first half of the year.
Strategic Initiatives Going Forward
Building upon our 3x20 strategy adopted  
in 2011, we are set to deliver on our key 
strategic priorities for the next three years. 
We are determined to maintain our market 
leadership, which gives us economies of  
scale as well as superior distribution and 
pricing power. Our market leadership is built 
on our strong Retail Banking and Corporate 
Banking businesses, which together are the 
backbone of the Bank of Georgia franchise. 
We see the strong growth potential of Solo 
Banking, our premier banking business, by 
means of increasing our currently relatively 
low penetration in the mass affluent segment. 
The expansion of our Solo Banking will be 
strongly supported by the offerings of our 
Investment Management products and 
services. The further development of our 
Express Banking business, which is at the 
heart of our retail strategy, is directly linked  
to Express Technologies, and we intend to 
continue investing in IT, which we consider 
pivotal for the future of the banking industry. 
We plan to build the growth on the back  
of further diversified revenue sources. 
Knowledge and understanding of the 
market, both Georgian and regional, and 
proven superior access to international 
capital will be the drivers of our Investment 
Management business growth. In 2013,  
we have combined our wealth management, 
research, advisory, and brokerage 
businesses under Investment Management. 
We intend to launch our first Investment 
Management products during 2014 and 
plan to continue to build upon them with the 
aim to create an important fee-generating 
business. Expansion through our payments 
business in Georgia has already started, 
and the newest addition is the Express 
Merchant business, which is an additional 
revenue source of income from small 
retailers that are not yet part of the card 
payment system. We will be focusing on 
turning payment systems into a significant 
base for our revenue generation and we are 
also preparing to leverage our knowledge  
of IT and payment business by beginning  
to export IT and payment business outside  
of Georgia.
Looking back, I am proud of how much has 
been achieved. Entrepreneurial spirit is at 
the heart of Bank of Georgia’s culture and is 
one of our strongest assets. It has resulted in 
the creation of a very strong franchise that 
will be very difficult to match and even 
harder to displace. Such success in turn 
has created a new important task for us.  
We now have to manage the size, which in 
our case means striking the right balance  
as we seek to maintain our entrepreneurial  
spirit as we further institutionalise our

achievements. In 2014, this will be one  
of our main tasks. Our first step to this  
end is the recently launched Bank of 
Georgia University that will help with the 
identification and development of talent 
within the Group.
2013 was a momentous year in terms of share 
price performance, which increased 113% 
since year-end 2012, outpacing most of our 
peers. In 2013, Bank of Georgia was the 
third largest growth stock in the FTSE 250. 
Average daily liquidity increased by more 
than 65% to 200,000 shares in 2013. Our 
long-term investors, namely East Capital 
and Firebird, significantly reduced their 
holdings, which led to the widening of our 
institutional shareholder base, contributing 
to the improvements in stock liquidity and 
free float. Our shareholder base is now  
far more diversified than a year ago: 
non-emerging market focused institutional 
shareholders make up c. 36% of our 
shareholder base compared to just 15%  
a year ago. 
At the 2014 AGM, the Board intends to 
recommend an annual dividend of GEL 2.0 
per share payable in British Pounds Sterling 
at the prevailing rate. This represents an 
increase of 33.3%, compared to the annual 
dividend of GEL 1.5 per share last year, a 
payout ratio of 33.7% and a dividend yield  
for shareholders of 2.9%, calculated on  
the basis of the year-end 2013 results and  
using the 31 December 2013 share price  
of £23.95. 
I would like to thank the members of our 
Board for their engagement and invaluable 
input and congratulate the management 
team and more than 11,000 employees of 
the Group for the strong performance this 
year. We are looking forward to a busy and 
exciting year ahead of us. The key strategic 
initiatives that we undertook a few years  
ago are gaining momentum and while we 
made considerable progress this past year, 
I believe we have much more work ahead  
of us to realise the great potential of the 
Bank of Georgia Group. We are confident  
in our competitive position and remain 
focused on delivering value to our 
shareholders, lenders, customers  
and employees.
As part of a number of significant changes 
in regulations in the UK, this Annual Report 
contains a Strategic Report, which is set out 
on pages 10 to 27. The Strategic Report has 
been reviewed and approved by the Board 
of Directors of BGH on 10 April 2014 and  
I hereby sign the Strategic Report on behalf 
of the Board of Directors of BGH.

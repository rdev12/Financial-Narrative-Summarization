The	 Group	 believes	 that	 these	 measures	 provide	 additional	 guidance	 to	 the	 statutory	 measures	 of	 performance	 of	 the	 business.	 These	 measures	 are	 not	 defined	 under	
adopted	IFRS	and	therefore	may	not	be	directly	comparable	with	other	companies’	adjusted	profit	measures.

statement	 caption	 to	 which	 they	 relate	 and	 are	 separately	 disclosed	 either	 in	 the	 notes	 to	 the	 consolidated	 financial	 statements	 or	 on	 the	 face	 of	 the	 consolidated	
income	statement.

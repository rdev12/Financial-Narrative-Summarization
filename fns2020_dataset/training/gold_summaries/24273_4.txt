Our Clients
We currently support over 6,000 clients across the 
world, in both the private and public sector.
The organisations we serve need identity data 
intelligence to protect themselves from financial 
crime or regulatory non-compliance and to  
improve the overall experience they offer 
customers – with the ultimate goal of improving 
their overall business.
Our technology spans employee screening, 
customer on-boarding and fraud management 
across all B2C sectors. We support customers 
globally in traditional banking, government, 
utilities, retail and transport as well as newly 
emerging industries such as eCommerce, online 
gaming, cryptocurrency and mobile payments.
As we have grown, our most successful clients have 
grown and many of our client relationships stretch 
back more than 20 years.
At a Glance
Data is the fuel of the digital economy. 
GBG enables clients to connect instantly 
to over 300 third-party datasets, helping 
our clients focus on improving their 
customers’ experience while adhering  
to their own internal risk management, 
fraud or compliance procedures.
 In the digital world where most of 
us live, our identities are continually 
defined by the billions of data bytes 
we share. 03

Identity can be defined as the characteristics 
by which an individual is known. Today, several 
elements build our identity and every individual has 
thousands of characteristics that can be gleaned 
from a wide range of data sources. The more 
identity data points analysed, the better informed 
business decisions will be and the better the 
customer experience.

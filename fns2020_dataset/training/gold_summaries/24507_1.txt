In November we 
launched our Moving 
up a Gear strategy 
aimed at driving 
sustainable long-term 
growth, with good  
progress to date.
Chief Executive’s Statement
Summary of Group Results 
Sales of £1,021.5m were up 1.7%, 
with like-for-like (“LFL”) revenue 
growth of 1.5%. Group gross 
margin was broadly unchanged at 
53.2%. T otal operating costs rose 
by 1.8% reflecting volume-driven 
cost increases and investments 
made in key areas of the business 
offset by targeted cost savings. 
Investment in the expansion of 
Autocentres continued as the 
business added eleven centres 
and in Retail we opened six Cycle 
Republic shops. 
Group earnings before non-
recurring items, finance costs, 
depreciation and amortisation 
(“Underlying EBITDA ”) were up 
4.3% to £114.6m. Group earnings 
before finance costs, tax and non-
recurring items (“Underlying EBIT”) 
were £84.5m, which compares 
with £84.6m in the prior year. Profit 
before tax and non-recurring items 
was £81.5m and earnings per 
share before non-recurring items 
was 33.2p, up 0.5% and 1.5% 
respectively .  
The cashflow performance 
remained robust with operating 
cashflows more than offsetting the 
impact of our capital expenditure 
programme. Net debt at the end 
of the year was down £13.9m at 
£47.9m, with a net debt to EBITDA 
ratio of 0.4:1 versus 0.6:1 in the 
prior year.
Car Maintenance LFL revenues 
increased by 3.4%, driven by 
good growth in sales of car parts, 
workshop products and the fitting 
and sale of bulbs, blades and 
batteries (“3Bs”). The Halfords own 
brand oil further consolidated its 
number one market position and 
some of our innovations, such as 
130% brighter bulbs, performed 
strongly . Car Enhancement LFL 
revenues increased by 1.0%, 
supported by exclusive products, 
innovation and expert service, and 
dash cams and in-car connectivity 
sales grew strongly . The growth in 
sales of this “new technology” for 
the first time offset the continued 
decline of sat nav sales; the latter 
continuing to decrease as a result 
of the structurally-declining market. 
Our We-Fit proposition drove 
an increase in sales of car audio 
products and services. T ravel 
Solutions LFL revenues increased 
2.8%, driven by growth in child car 
seats and camping equipment.
Cycling sales declined by 0.9% 
on a like-for-like basis. This was 
principally driven by the previously 
highlighted challenging July and 
August for mainstream bikes, due 
to a number of factors including 
particularly strong comparatives, 
poor weather and discounting 
across the market. Bike sales 
returned to growth in Q3 and Q4. 
Parts, Accessories and Clothing 
(“P ACs”) sales declined in the year 
and this is a focus area for us to 
improve over the medium-term. 
Service-related sales increased by 
8.5%, driven in particular by cycle 
repair and elements of motoring 
fitting, such as audio and roof 
boxes. We also introduced new 
services including “2Bs” (bulbs and 
batteries) fitting for motorbikes and 
windscreen chip repair for cars.
Online Retail revenues grew by 
1.4% and represented 12.1% of 
total Retail sales (FY15: 12.1%). The 
importance of our store network 
and service overlay continued to be 
highlighted by the strength of Click 
& Collect, with around 90% of online 
orders picked up in store.

Chief Executive Operational Review: 
Autocentres
T otal Autocentres revenues were 
up 4.1% and, on a LFL basis, up 
2.5%. Gross margin improved 
by 90 basis points in the year, 
reflecting a lower tyre mix and 
an increase in service, MOT and 
repair margins. Operating costs 
increased by 5.8%, with the 
majority of the increase coming 
from new centres opened in recent 
years and the balance due to 
pay rises, enhanced training and 
investments in support functions. 
Underlying EBITDA increased by 
13.2% to £8.6m. 
Eleven new Autocentres were 
opened and two were closed, 
taking the total number of 
Autocentre locations to 314 at the 
end of the year. 24 centres were 
refurbished during the year, taking 
the total new or refurbished to just 
over 10% of the estate. 10-15 new 
centres will be opened in the year 
ahead and any sub-optimal centres 
will continue to be closed.
Market Update
A full review and update of the 
markets in which we operate is set 
out on pages 8 to 9. 
The Board has recommended a 
final dividend of 11.3 pence per 
share (FY15: 11.0 pence) which, if 
approved, would take the full-year 
dividend to 17.0 pence per share, 
an increase of 3.0% on the prior 
year. If approved, the final dividend 
will be paid on 26 August 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 5 August 
2016. The Board continues to 
target to grow the dividend every 
year with an average cover of 
around 2 times over time. 
We have announced a target for 
debt of 1.0x EBITDA with a range 
up to 1.5x to allow for appropriate 
M&A. This is a prudent level for 
debt, taking account of our regular 
strong cashflow, no pension deficit 
and shorter, more flexible leases 
than many other UK retailers.  Our 
priorities for capital allocation are 
explained later in this report. 
Operational Review: Retail
Halfords Retail achieved a solid 
year of sales performance in the 
context of the trading conditions, 
with sales up 1.2% to £868.5m. LFL 
growth of 1.3% reflected Motoring 
LFL of +2.5% and Cycling LFL of 
-0.9%. The weather was not helpful, 
with both a wet summer and a 
mild winter, including the warmest 
December since records began. 
Despite this, the motoring side of 
our business, which contributes 
around 70% of Group sales, was 
resilient and reflected the healthy 
underlying market indicators and 
the service-led proposition.

Halfords Business Review
Our goal is to be customers’ first 
choice for their life on the move 
and we will achieve this by being 
Committed to Making Customers’ 
Journeys Better.
In November we set out the 
evolution in strategy from Getting 
Into Gear to Moving Up a Gear. In 
Retail this new strategy has five 
key pillars:
•	 Putting Customers in the 
Driving Seat — investing in 
customer data and insight 
capabilities to maximise the 
lifetime customer value 
•	 Service in our DNA — 
embedding the focus on 
customer service
•	 Building on our Uniqueness 
— exclusive products, relevant 
innovation and unique 
partnerships, such as our 
new collaboration with British 
Olympian and T our de France 
winner Sir Bradley Wiggins
•	 Better Shopping Experience 
— a seamless customer 
experience, online as well as 
in store
•	 Fit for the Future 
Infrastructure — moving from 
fixing the basics to improving 
efficiency and fulfillment 
On pages 14 to 15 we have set 
out a more detailed explanation 
of the Retail strategy and on 
pages 16 to 19 we have explained 
in more detail our progress on 
each of these pillars. On pages 
20 to 21 we have explained 
our Autocentres strategy and 
progress during FY16.
Financial Targets 
In November we set out four key 
financial targets, which we reaffirm 
and update below:
•	 Grow sales faster than the 
markets in which we operate. 
We anticipate that the motoring 
market will grow at an average 
rate of 2–3% per annum and the 
cycling market at an average 
rate of 3–5% per annum over 
the medium-term. We will aim 
to beat whatever those growth 
rates are.
• Maintain Group EBITDA % 
margin roughly flat over the 
next few years as we continue 
to invest for sustainable growth. 
• Grow the dividend per share 
every year with coverage of 
around 2 times underlying 
earnings on average over time.
• A debt target of 1.0 times 
EBITDA with a range up to 1.5 
times to allow for appropriate 
M&A. We have set out below 
some important principles in 
this regard. 
Capital Structure and 
Priorities
Our top priority will be to maintain 
a strong balance sheet. The 
debt target has been set at a 
prudent level, taking into account 
the strong, regular cash flow 
generation, no pension deficit and 
shorter, more flexible leases than 
many UK retailers.   
Our priorities for use of cash, 
based on the balance sheet 
described above, will be firstly 
capital investment to grow the 
business in line with previous 
guidance, secondly to pay and 
grow the ordinary dividend every 
year within a cover ratio of 2x on 
average over time, thirdly for any 
appropriate M&A opportunities 
which may arise and thereafter any 
excess cash would be available 
for additional distribution to 
shareholders.
The debt target and range is 
intended as guidance rather than 
a hard and fast rule. We anticipate 
moving towards the debt target 
over time. Our clear priority at 
present is investment to deliver the 
Moving Up A Gear strategy and for 
growth.  
Acquisition of Tredz and 
Wheelies
Subsequent to the year end, 
on 23 May 2016 the Group 
acquired T redz Limited (“T redz”) 
and Wheelies Direct Limited 
(“Wheelies”). T redz is a UK-wide 
online retailer of premium bikes 
and cycling parts, accessories 
and clothing. It also operates four 
stores in South Wales. Wheelies 
is the UK’s largest provider of 
bicycle replacement for insurance 
companies. 
Collectively, these businesses 
generated revenue of circa £32m 
for the year ended 29 February 
2016, up from circa £24m in the 
prior year, and EBITDA of £2.4m. 
The initial cash consideration is 
£18.4m and has been settled from 
the Group’s existing borrowing 
facilities. Dependent upon the 
financial performance of T redz 
in the year ending 28 February 
2017, there will be an element of 
deferred consideration payable in 
12 months. 
From a customer and supplier 
perspective the businesses will 
continue to trade on a standalone 
basis and will continue to be led by 
the existing management teams. 
The businesses have strong 
web development capability 
and are supported by office and 
warehousing premises in Swansea. 
The majority of sales are fulfilled 
from the warehouse operation 
where a team of highly skilled and 
experienced bike technicians build 
bikes which are then carefully 
boxed and delivered direct to 
customers’ homes.
This acquisition is a strong and 
complementary addition to the 
Group, extending our presence 
in the online market for premium 
bikes, parts, accessories and 
clothing. 
Current Activity
As we look ahead there is plenty to 
do as we implement Moving Up a 
Gear and we’ve already built good 
momentum. The year ahead will 
be a busy one, both for product 
developments and strategic 
progress.
In Motoring, we are embedding 
our new motorcycle product 
and service offer, building our 
new windscreen chip repair 
service, launching exclusive 
in-car technology products, 
further expanding our ranges 
and developing our trade offer. In 
Cycling we have just launched our 
Orla Kiely collaboration and there 
will be a refresh of our Apollo and 
Carrera bike ranges, the launch 
of the Wiggins and T rott ranges 
and extended online PACs range 
through Cycle Republic.
The key focuses under the Moving 
Up A Gear plan include building 
relationships with more of our 
customers, growing more service-
related revenue, continuing to 
improve our colleague training 
and retention, implementing 
transformational colleague and 
customer-facing distribution and 
IT development and improving 
on our successful store refresh 
programme with the Store of the 
Future concept.
In Autocentres we remain 
committed to new centre 
openings, along with the 
continuation of a roll-out across 
the wider estate of the refresh 
programme. We are also investing 
in a new electronic point of sale 
system, which will enable us to 
stock and sell Retail products in our 
centres, jointly source parts with 
Retail and implement an e-diary.
I would like to thank all colleagues 
for their fantastic contribution, 
support and commitment to the 
further progress and performance 
made in Halfords this year.

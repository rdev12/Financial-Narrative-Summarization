* Explanatory notes for reading the 2005 
annual report and accounts
1 The results for the year ended 31 December 2005
represent the group’s first preliminary financial
statements prepared in accordance with its accounting
policies under International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). The 2004 comparative results have
been restated.
2 Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance
measures. Adjusted figures are stated before
amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets,
goodwill charges, profits or losses on termination or
disposal of businesses or major fixed assets, unrealised
changes in the fair value of financial instruments,
related tax effects and other tax items which do not
form part of the underlying tax rate. The differences
between the adjusted and unadjusted measures are
reconciled in Note 3.
3 The narrative that follows is based on the adjusted
measures of operating profit, profit before tax and
earnings per share.

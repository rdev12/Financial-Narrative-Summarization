STRATEGIC REPORT  u
Cinema City operates in six Central and Eastern European 
territories, and is either the number one or two chain in each  
of the markets in which it operates. The cinemas are modern, 
well-designed multiplexes offering a high quality cinema 
experience, showing a variety of movies, and providing great 
customer service. In each of the markets, Cinema City work 
closely with the local communities to provide its customers with 
a great tailored viewing experience for both international and 
local productions. The cinemas have large screens (among the 
highest screen/hall ratio in the world), significant stadium 
seating and market leading technologies such as IMAX, 4DX 
and VIP auditoriums. In order to maintain Cinema City’s position 
as the leading chain, both in number of screens and the quality 
of the experience, constant renovation of the circuit takes place, 
and new sites are developed. While Cinema City opened new 
cinemas in a number of the territories, Romania was the most 
important market for expansion in 2016 with three new cinema 
sites opened. In 2017 there are two sites planned to be opened 
in Poland, one in Romania and one in Czech Republic. 
Yes Planet and Rav-Chen are the two brands which the Group 
operates in Israel. Yes Planet is the market leader, operating 
cinemas which, include IMAX, 4DX and VIP screens. The 
Rav-Chen cinemas are a smaller version of the multiplexes.  
As in the other territories, all the cinemas in Israel provide a  
high level of quality and service. The styles and designs of the 
cinemas are modern and all have stadium seating, large screens 
and the latest digital technology. The cinemas show a range  
of popular films from both international and local producers. 
During 2016 a state-of-the art 18 screen cinema was opened  
in Beer Sheva with IMAX, 4DX, and VIP screens, and another 
modern 12 screen multiplex site is due to be opened in Zichron 
during 2017.

Chief Executive’s review
Brian May, Chief Executive
The Group has made further progress in 
growing its Engineering Services business 
which focuses on supporting the maintenance 
and renewal of UK infrastructure increasing 
both revenue and operating proﬁt. Specialist 
Building has increased its operating margin 
in the year and is concentrated on 
sustainable markets in the South.
Engineering Services
Renew provides integrated engineering 
services nationwide focusing on the highly 
regulated markets of Energy, Environmental 
and Infrastructure. The Group concentrates 
on the renewal and maintenance of essential 
operational assets delivered through its 
multidisciplinary workforce employed 
by our strong local and independently 
branded businesses. 
Our strategy is delivering both strong 
ﬁnancial results and growth. Revenue 
in Engineering Services grew by 24% to 
£214.1m (2011: £172.8m) and now accounts 
for 63% of ongoing Group revenue and over 
90% of operating proﬁt. Operating margin 
increased to 4.5% (2011: 4.3%). 
The Engineering Services order book is 
growing strongly and is underpinned by 
62 frameworks, an increase of 22% in the 
year, of which 45 are for maintenance work. 
Non-discretionary orders account for 95% 
of the £235m (2011: £179m) order book 
which has grown by 31% in the year. 
Our order book in Energy grew by 51% to 
£124m (201 1: £82m), by 14% in Environmental 
to £33m (2011: £29m) and by 15% in 
Infrastructure to £78m (2011: £68m). 
It remains the Group's strategy to grow its 
Engineering Services both organically and by 
targeting earnings enhancing acquisitions in 
sustainable markets. The recent appointment 
of Paul Scott, Managing Director of our 
Nuclear business, as Engineering Services 
Director, will assist in developing our 
integrated offering to these markets. 
Our strategy is delivering both 
strong ﬁnancial results and growth.

Review of 
operations
Group 
overview
Energy
Renew operates nationally in the nuclear, 
renewable and traditional power generation 
sectors where work concentrates on the 
critical planned and reactive maintenance 
and asset renewal programmes. Much 
of the work is delivered through our 
24 framework agreements.
In Nuclear, Renew operates across 
the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority 
(“NDA”) estate in high hazard reduction 
programmes, decommissioning and in 
operational asset care. We are strongly 
positioned with engagements on 9 licenced 
nuclear sites that command around 70% of 
the NDA’s £3bn annual expenditure. Within 
that budget, over 55% of the spend is allocated 
to Sellaﬁeld, where we have been active for 
over 60 years and where we are the principal 
provider of mechanical and electrical services. 
Our revenue at Sellaﬁeld grew by 12% 
in the last twelve months and has grown 
by over 150% in the last 7 years. All of 
our 2012/13 revenue budget in Nuclear 
is already secured in an order book that 
has grown by 51% to £109m (2011: £72m).
Operational asset care is vital to Sellaﬁeld 
which derives substantial revenue from 
spent fuel management and reprocessing. 
For the last 15 years we have carried out 
production operations support under the 
Multi Discipline Site Works framework. 
Since the year end, we have again been 
appointed as one of three participants to 
deliver work packages worth up to £280m 
over 4 years commencing in April 2013. 
During the year, we were also appointed 
as the sole mechanical and electrical partner 
to Stobbarts on the £58m Site Wide Asset 
Care framework which runs until April 2016. 
“ We are committed to the 
safety of our employees and 
those who work with us 
evidenced in the record 
reduction in the Group’s 
Accident Incidence Rate 
during 2012, now at its lowest 
ﬁgure in 7 years, a reduction 
of 87% over that period.”

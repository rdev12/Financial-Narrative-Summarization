Chief Executive’s review
Leadership Through Strategic and
Market Focus
We enhanced our market leadership
positions in 2004 by demonstrating
further excellent progress in the
delivery of our strategy, which is set
out in the Chairman’s statement. The
successful disposal of Laird Plastics in
October 2004, following the disposal
of Fullarton Computer Industries in
August 2002, has focused the Group
on its two market-leading divisions,
Laird T echnologies and Laird Security
Systems. We have continued to
strengthen and develop these
businesses through investment and
value-adding acquisitions, in particular
the acquisition of Centurion Wireless
T echnologies in 2004 which
transformed Laird T echnologies in
terms of its product range, capabilities
and scale. Each division now has a
range of superior products together
with strong market positions,
particularly with the leading customers
in their industries. Each is also
increasingly focused toward the higher
growth markets in their industries, and
they both maintain a competitive edge
through innovation and technical
expertise, customer service and low
cost manufacturing.
The combination of the two divisions
provides balance and strength to, as
well as an attractive growth proﬁle for ,
the Group as a whole. The success of
each of the businesses’ own
strategies has been demonstrated by
the strong growth in turnover and
operating proﬁts that both have
delivered in recent years; the success
of the Group strategy has been
evidenced by both the consistent
strong growth in earnings and the
return to shareholders through share
price appreciation and dividends over
the same period.
Another Y ear of Proﬁtable Growth
Group turnover in 2004 was
£468 million, 9% up on the £429 million
in 2003 and 17% up at constant
exchange rates. This increase reﬂects
both our organic growth resulting from
stronger markets, new product
introductions and market share gains,
together with the beneﬁts arising from
acquisitions net of the disposal of
Laird Plastics. Organic turnover
growth for the Group, at constant
exchange rates, was a healthy 11%.
Group proﬁts for 2004 increased
strongly compared with 2003, despite
the adverse translation effects of
exchange rate movements. Both Laird
T echnologies and Laird Security
Systems again delivered strong proﬁts
growth as a result of the higher sales,
improved operating margins and an
increasing proportion of
manufacturing being sourced from
lower cost countries. Laird Plastics’
proﬁts up to the point of its disposal
were higher than in the corresponding
period in 2003, and there was a further
net beneﬁt from acquisitions made
during the year .
Proﬁts for the Group before
exceptional items, goodwill
amortisation and tax for 2004 were
£47.1 million, 26% up on the
£37.4 million in 2003 and up 37% at
constant exchange rates. There were
no operating exceptional costs
charged in the year (2003: £5.9 million).
Proﬁtability improved once again, with
the Group’s operating margin
increasing to 11.3% compared with
9.7% in 2003.
Earnings per share in 2004 before
exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation were 25.9 pence, 20%
up on 2003 earnings of 21.6 pence.
At constant exchange rates earnings
growth would have been 30%.
Focusing on Core Businesses
Both Laird T echnologies and Laird
Security Systems had another
excellent year , with each division
delivering top-line organic growth as
well as strong growth in operating
proﬁts. Laird T echnologies’ operating
proﬁts before exceptional items grew
by 67% to £21.0 million, compared
with £12.6 million in 2003, while
operating margins increased to 14.7%.
At constant exchange rates the
growth in operating proﬁts would have
been 84%. At Laird Security Systems,
operating proﬁts before exceptional
items grew by 15% to £28.5 million,
while operating margins increased to
12.2%. At constant exchange rates the
growth in operating proﬁts would have
been 24%.
Maintaining a Sound Financial Proﬁle
Laird has maintained a sound ﬁnancial
structure and strong cash generation.
Net borrowings at the year end were
£118.6 million, representing 49% of
shareholders’ funds, up from £60.1
million at the end of 2003. Interest
cover for the year was 9.4 times
before exceptional costs and goodwill
amortisation, compared with 10.4
times in 2003. Both interest costs and
our reported level of borrowings
beneﬁted from the translation of
US$ into Sterling. 
Cash generation remained healthy,
with a trading cash inﬂow for the year
of £24.3 million before the net effect of
exceptionals, acquisitions, disposals
and dividend payments, compared
with an inﬂow of £38.2 million in 2003.
The reduction was due largely to
higher capital expenditure on adding
new production capacity in both Laird
T echnologies and Laird Security
Systems and on completing Laird
T echnologies’ new plant in the Czech
Republic, as well as increased working
capital requirements as a result of
both the higher turnover and higher
commodity prices. There was a net
cash outﬂow on acquisitions and
disposals of £77.3 million compared
with £25.3 million in 2003.
The maintenance of a strong ﬁnancial
structure remains a key factor in our
strategy. $140 million of new US
Private Placement facilities were put in
place during the second half of the
year , of which $97 million expire in
2014 and $43 million in 2016. These
new facilities add to the Group’s
£155 million of bilateral facilities, which
expire in July 2008, and its existing US
Private Placement loan notes totalling
$61 million, which expire at various
dates up to 2014. These facilities give
Laird the ﬁnancial resources and
ﬂexibility to make further value
enhancing investments and
acquisitions.
Enhancing our Portfolio Strength
Through Acquisitions
We were active during the year in
repositioning our portfolio towards
higher growth segments, expanding
our core businesses and extending
our capabilities into new, related
markets. In October 2004 we
successfully completed the
divestment of Laird Plastics, our lower
growth North American plastics
distribution business, to a subsidiary
of the Blackfriars Corporation for a
headline consideration of $65 million in
cash, allowing us to focus on our two
core higher growth, global, design-led
businesses, Laird T echnologies and
Laird Security Systems. 07
2004 was a year of transformation for
Laird T echnologies, which signiﬁcantly
broadened its product range and
capabilities beyond its historical focus
on electromagnetic interference
shielding where it remains the global
market leader . In April we acquired
Thermagon, for a headline cash
consideration of $27.5 million plus
future conditional payments of up to
$16.5 million. This gave us critical
mass in the high-growth market for
thermal interface materials and
allowed us to integrate Thermagon’s
business with those of Orcus and
Warth, which were both acquired in
late 2003. 
In October we completed the
acquisition of Centurion Wireless
T echnologies, for a headline cash
consideration of $115 million together
with the issue of approximately 14
million new Laird shares. Centurion is
the global market leader in the design
and supply of cellular handset
antennae and has an increasing
presence in the emerging markets of
telematics and Wi-Fi. Its acquisition
transforms Laird T echnologies in
terms of its product range, capabilities
and scale, and makes it uniquely
placed to exploit the growing
convergence between EMI shielding,
antennae and thermal management
products. The integration of Centurion
is proceeding as planned, and we are
on track to achieve or exceed our
planned cost synergies.
In January 2005 we also acquired the
T aiwanese company Cateron
Corporation, the leading supplier of
EMI shielding products to the global
PC notebook market, for a cash
consideration of approximately
£13 million. This reinforced further
Laird T echnologies’ position in the EMI
shielding market, and provides
opportunities to increase our antennae
and thermal interface materials sales
to the PC notebook market. 
There were also acquisitions, costing
some £11 million, to strengthen the
core businesses of Laird Security
Systems, whilst simultaneously
expanding into new and higher growth
market sectors. In July we acquired
Lindman Limited, a supplier of high
speciﬁcation composite doors to the
social and private housing markets,
extending our position in this fast
growing UK market segment and
building on the acquisition of Intron in
2003. Laird Security Systems brings a
differentiated and fully integrated
solution to this market. In August we
acquired Advanced Metals
T echnologies Inc., a key supplier to
Laird Security Systems’ US window
Operationally, we focus on achieving
continuous improvement in our
manufacturing, supply chain and new
product introduction and development
processes. We remain close to our
customers in terms of both product
design and support, delivering high
levels of customer service and
satisfaction. We continue to develop
the breadth and capabilities of our
products, enhancing our technical
expertise and design skills and
pursuing patent protection wherever
justiﬁed.
A sound ﬁnancial structure is also
central to our strategy. The Group and
its businesses exhibit an attractive
cash generation proﬁle, while the
combination of our two businesses
yields ﬁnancial beneﬁts to the Group
as a whole. We have the ﬁnancial
strength to make further , value
enhancing investments and
acquisitions to ensure that we
maintain strong positions in our
markets.
Leadership for the Future
We have refocused the Group onto
our two high-quality, core businesses,
both of which have attractive growth
proﬁles, operating across a range of
specialist market sectors where they
generally hold leading positions.
However , we again expect to
experience in 2005 further adverse
translation effects from exchange rate
movements, as well as the effects of
higher commodity prices and higher
interest rates. Despite this, we remain
well positioned for the future, given the
strategy we have in place, the strength
of our businesses and the actions we
continue to take. We look forward to
making further progress in 2005.
Peter Hill
Chief Executive
balances business, marking a further
step in the vertical integration of our
supply chain there.
In September , we announced the
acquisition of Home Doors (GB) and
Houseproud which, when combined
with Laird Security Systems’ existing
businesses, created the UK market
leader in the supply of doors, windows
and affordable conservatories to the
growing DIY retail market. The
acquisition was in line with our
strategy of developing this retail
channel for integrated security and
building products.
Maintaining Proﬁtable Growth
Both of Laird’s divisions hold leading
market positions in their industries.
They are global, innovative and
design-led, customer focused
businesses with a high level of
technical expertise, underpinned by
efﬁcient and low cost manufacturing.
Both are high margin businesses with
attractive cash-ﬂow proﬁles, each
now operating in a number of higher
growth, specialist markets which
generally have high barriers to entry. 
We have made signiﬁcant advances in
recent years in positioning our
business portfolio towards these
specialist, higher growth markets and
this process continues. Our
acquisitions and divestments, and our
entry into new growth market
segments, reﬂect this and we are
leaders in many of these new areas,
and aim to take a leading position in
the remainder . We will continue to
develop both of our two divisions
through investment and acquisitions,
beneﬁting from the strength and
balance that both bring to the Group.
Our global reach is a critical success
factor , so we continued to expand our
Asian presence and capabilities in
2004. Excluding those employees
acquired with Centurion, the number
of our employees in Asia more than
doubled in 2004, on top of a 60%
increase in 2003. Including Centurion,
by the end of the year we had almost
4,000 employees in Asia. The region
represents an exciting and growing
market and our presence there keeps
us close to our local customers, while
also providing us with a lower cost
supply base. The bringing on stream
of our new plant in the Czech Republic
took us into Central Europe, further
extending our low cost manufacturing
base. At the end of 2004, nearly 50%
of the Group’s employees were in Asia
or Central Europe, compared with
17% at the end of 2003. 08
Leading through development
We enhanced our market leadership positions in 2004,
demonstrating further excellent progress in the delivery
of our strategy. The successful disposal of Laird
Plastics in 2004, following the disposal of Fullarton
Computer Industries in 2002, has focused the Group on
its two market-leading divisions, Laird T echnologies
and Laird Security Systems. We have continued to
strengthen and develop both of these divisions through
investment and value-adding acquisitions.

Beneﬁts of Wider Product Range and
Improved Markets
Laird T echnologies’ markets had
strengthened by the beginning of the
year , and 2004 saw improved demand
across all market sectors, particularly
in cellular handsets,
telecommunications and information
technology. Laird T echnologies also
beneﬁted from its entry through
acquisition into the antennae and
thermal interface materials markets,
while sales into the industrial, defence
and consumer markets all increased
compared with 2003. T urnover for
2004 was £142.8 million, up from
£95.8 million in 2003. Organic turnover
growth at constant exchange rates
was 15%.
Operating proﬁts before exceptional
items were £21.0 million for the year ,
67% up on the £12.6 million in 2003
and up 84% at constant exchange
rates. Operating margins continued to
improve, to 14.7%, as a result of a
further expansion of our low cost
manufacturing and additional
operational efﬁciencies, despite some
price declines in certain product
sectors.
Achieving Strategic Development
Through Acquisition
In 2004 Laird T echnologies took two
major strategic steps to expand its
product range and capabilities beyond
EMI shielding where it is already the
global market leader . In April Laird
T echnologies achieved critical mass in
the growing area of thermal interface
materials with the acquisition of
Thermagon. The thermal businesses
of Orcus and Warth, acquired in 2003,
have been integrated with that of
Thermagon, and Orcus’ Kansas City
facility was closed in the second half
of the year .
In October Laird T echnologies
completed the acquisition of
Centurion Wireless T echnologies, the
global market leader in the design and
supply of antennae for wireless
handsets and land mobile radios, and
which has a growing presence in the
emerging markets of telematics and
Wi-Fi. Centurion’s own turnover
increased organically by 24% in 2004
compared with 2003, as it supplied
almost 140 million cellular antennae to
the world’s major handset
manufacturers, a growth of 18%
compared with 2003. Centurion has
grown market share in 2004 with the
major global handset manufacturers,
and is also making steady progress in
penetrating the local China antennae
market. The acquisition of Centurion
further strengthens our presence in
Asia. As well as manufacturing
facilities in the USA and Sweden,
Centurion brings design and
manufacturing centres in Beijing and
Shanghai in China and also in
Malaysia, as well as sales ofﬁces in
Korea and T aiwan.
The integration of Centurion is
proceeding as planned, and the
projected cost synergies, announced
at the time of the acquisition, of
$5 million in 2006, are on track to be
achieved or exceeded. The closure of
antennae manufacturing in Sweden
has been announced, and its transfer
to other Laird T echnologies facilities
will be completed by early 2006.
Construction of a new and much
expanded design and manufacturing
plant will begin during 2005, in the
Nokia “campus” on the outskirts of
Beijing. Laird T echnologies is now
uniquely placed to beneﬁt from the
increasing convergence of EMI
shielding, antennae and thermal
products.
Continuing Expansion in EMI Shielding
Laird T echnologies’ EMI shielding
business continued to grow and
prosper in 2004, as a result of stronger
markets, new product introductions
and with an increasing proportion of
production being manufactured in
China and the Czech Republic. Our
new plant in the Czech Republic was
ofﬁcially opened in April, and by the
year end was producing a wide range
of EMI shielding products, including
board level shields, beryllium copper ,
fabric over foam, conductive
elastomers, form in place, and knitted
metal products.
Laird T echnologies is increasingly
focused on Asia, both as a low cost
supply base and as a market in its
own right. By the end of 2004 Laird
T echnologies employed some 3,600
people in Asia, nearly 70% of the total
workforce. In China, we expanded the
manufacturing capacity at our plants
in Shanghai and Tianjin during the
year , leased a third building at our
Shenzhen facility and moved into a
larger facility in Suzhou. In 2005 we will
begin construction of a new plant at a
greenﬁeld site in Shenzhen, which will
allow all of our existing operations in
the three buildings there to be
consolidated in 2006, as well as
providing additional design and tooling
capabilities and production capacity.
In 2004 we increased rapidly our
moulding and stamping capacity to
support design wins for Nokia and
Motorola, to be manufactured in
China. Our sales force in China
continues to grow, as does our design,
development and marketing
capabilities and we were successful in
winning new programmes with local
Chinese electronics manufacturers.
Laird T echnologies expanded its
operations in Korea and Japan during
the year , following the acquisition of
Magnes in Korea, and the acquisition
of a manufacturing presence in Japan
following the purchase of Warth, both
in late 2003. We have been particularly
successful in providing shielding
products into the new plasma and
liquid crystal display markets, with
new customer wins in 2004 including
Panasonic, Sony, Fujitsu,
LG Electronics and Samsung.
In January 2005 we acquired Cateron,
based in T aiwan and with a
manufacturing facility in Kunshan in
China. Cateron is the leading supplier
of EMI shielding fabric over foam
gaskets and tape to the global PC
notebook market.
Leadership Through T echnical
Expertise
During 2004 we made signiﬁcant
progress as innovators, by
strengthening and expanding our
technology capabilities and position.
We believe that Laird T echnologies
now possesses the industry’s largest
radio frequency and thermal design
and development team, employing
some 270 engineers and technologists
worldwide with an extensive range of
product and process development
skills. We have a strong intellectual
property portfolio supporting the
whole of Laird T echnologies’ product
range, with 215 patents issued and
some 200 pending. We are leaders in
metal stamping and ﬁnishing, in high
speed assembly, inspection and
packaging automation, in web
handling and metallisation technology
and also in high speed, automated
injection moulding. 
Examples of new product
developments in 2004 include new
combination EMI shielding products
utilising state-of-the-art elastomer and
silicone rubber moulding technology
combined with deep drawn metal
forming, with fully automated in line
inspection and packaging. Our
thermal business was successful in
2004 in designing and developing new,
high performance thermal pads and
greases. In antennae, we expanded
our integrated “antennae module”
products combining speakers and
cameras, developed the next
generation of internal antennae for
cellular handsets as well as a broad
array of solutions for current and
future wireless protocols, and released
the ﬁrst generation controllable
antennae to the handset market. 
Building on our Global Leadership
Position
Laird T echnologies had a very
successful year in 2004, beneﬁting
from improved markets as well as the
strategic development into new but
related product areas. Its strong global
customer relationships, the breadth of
its product offering and its highly
developed technical expertise, all
underpinned by its extensive and still
expanding low cost manufacturing
capabilities, provide a sound platform
for our leadership position and for our
future proﬁtable growth. 14 15
Laird Security Systems
Laird Security Systems is a leader in
the design, development, manufacture
and distribution of innovative solutions
to improve performance and enhance
protection and security for the
residential building and home
improvement markets. It provides a
wide range of products and solutions
including window and door hardware,
composite doors, conservatories and
specialist windows, uPVC proﬁles and
products and weather-stripping seals.
Laird Security Systems holds leading
positions in many of its market
sectors in the UK and the USA, and
sources an increasing proportion of its
hardware products from China, both
from its own manufacturing facilities
and from its partner suppliers. In
recent years Laird Security Systems
has both broadened its product range
and repositioned its businesses
towards the higher growth segments
of its markets.

Growth Through Product
Development and Improved
Customer Beneﬁts
Laird Security Systems had another
very successful year with strong
growth in turnover and proﬁts. This
was achieved despite the adverse
translation effects of exchange rate
movements on our US operations, and
against a backdrop of signiﬁcant price
increases in key raw materials, such
as uPVC, steel and zinc, as well as a
rising interest rate environment in both
the UK and the USA.
Laird Security Systems beneﬁted from
the breadth of its product range, its
positioning towards higher growth
segments of its overall markets, and
its maintenance of strong customer
relationships. T urnover in 2004 was
£233.3 million, up 14% compared with
£205.3 million in 2003 and up 18% at
constant exchange rates. Organic
turnover growth at constant exchange
rates was a healthy 8%. 
In North America the market for all of
our products remained strong in both
the new build and replacement
markets with the latter now
representing the largest segment of
the North American window market.
Underlying demographic trends, as
well as a movement towards those
product areas where we are strongest,
are all expected to remain favourable.
In the UK the window market suffered
in the year due to a slow-down in the
retail replacement market,
compounded by a backdrop of rising
interest rates and a reduction in
consumer conﬁdence, and this trend
is expected to continue through 2005.
However , this was mitigated by a
strong social housing market where
we now enjoy a position as a leading
supplier of composite doors. In
addition, the market for our door
hardware products remained buoyant.
Operating proﬁts before exceptional
items for the year were £28.5 million,
up 15% compared with the
£24.8 million in 2003, and up 24% at
constant exchange rates, a
continuation of the sound ﬁnancial
performance of recent years.
Global Markets, Local Products
2004 was a challenging year in terms
of both commodity prices and
availability. However , with the global
reach of our business we were able to
ensure continuity of supply to our
customers while our ability to ensure
competitive pricing of our products as
well as the beneﬁts in 2004 of
favourable supply contracts meant
that overall, we saw no adverse effect
on proﬁtability in the year .
The beneﬁts of integrating our global
capabilities with a strong local market
interface were also demonstrated by
the growth in our door hardware range
of locks, hinges and door furniture.
This growth was achieved in both the
UK and North America as a result of
close liaison between our US and
European design centres and Chinese
manufacturing units. These multi-
national, multi-functional teams are
considered to be a key component to
developing new high growth markets.
The level of manufacturing from low
cost economies, both through wholly
owned manufacturing units and
supplier alliances, grew signiﬁcantly in
2004. We commissioned a third
manufacturing facility in China in late
2004, and overall our sourcing from
Asia grew by over 40% compared with
2003. In 2005 we expect to see further
growth in the volumes of product
manufactured in Asia, both as a result
of continuing growth in our hardware
products in the US and with the further
transfer of production from one of our
UK facilities, where a signiﬁcant
down-sizing has recently been
announced.
Continued Development Through
Investment and Acquisition 
The geographic expansion of our
North American operations, with the
opening of a new branch in the
Western US, has been particularly
successful and this region has seen
signiﬁcant sales growth in 2004.
During the year we also completed an
expansion of our US seals facility, to
allow us to add new capacity to serve
this growth market and where we
beneﬁt from strong intellectual
property protection. In the second half
of the year we acquired Advanced
Metal T echnologies, a supplier critical
to our US window balances business,
allowing the business to beneﬁt from
vertical integration of its supply chain.
In the UK we continued to increase
our exposure to the social housing
market, which, due to a number of
Government initiatives together with
favourable demographic trends,
continues to exhibit high growth. The
acquisitions of Intron in late 2003, and
Lindman in July 2004, have made us
the leading supplier to this market,
while the increasing provision of
integrated solutions of doors, door
hardware and robust but easy-to-use
access controls is seen as an
important strategy for our future
success.
In September we acquired the
business and assets of Home Doors
(GB) and Houseproud, now renamed
Laird Lifestyle Products. This
acquisition brought a range of door ,
window and conservatory products
aimed predominantly at the DIY retail
and builders merchant markets, two
channels that are increasingly
important routes to market, as
consumers seek a 
well-respected alternative to the
traditional direct sell market.
The conservatory market has two very
distinct sectors; the high end,
expensive market and the more
affordable, predominantly uPVC
sector , where the product is viewed as
a low cost home extension. Whilst
both sectors, but particularly the high
end, have suffered in recent months
due to rising interest rates and a
reduction in consumer conﬁdence, the
market fundamentals of the affordable
sector , where Laird Lifestyle is
positioned, remain good as these
conservatories have low market
penetration and are a highly
aspirational product for homeowners.
The rationalisation of the business is
now complete with the closure of two
manufacturing facilities and a
reduction in overheads. The business
is now well placed for the normal
seasonal upturn in the market in the
Spring of 2005.
Leadership Through Innovation
Laird Security Systems has
established a reputation in its markets
for innovation in product design and
performance and for its industry-
leading levels of customer service,
making it the supplier of choice for its
customers. The integration of our
European and North American design
teams with our applications
engineering and manufacturing
capabilities in China is now bringing
considerable beneﬁts, with further
new, innovative product designs being
launched in our markets. Commercial
trials of our prototype electronic
access controls for doors and
windows continued during the year ,
and we continue to exploit the patent
protection which we enjoy in a
number of our main product areas.
Focusing on Market Leadership in
Higher Growth Sectors
As a result of the actions we have
taken in recent years, Laird Security
Systems now has a far broader
presence in a range of markets,
products and sales channels
compared with its traditional focus on
the UK window hardware market. The
majority of our businesses are now in
higher growth sectors within our
overall markets and ones in which we
hold leading market positions. We
expect to continue this repositioning,
reducing further our exposure to the
static or declining UK window market
while continuing to expand in the
higher growth sectors. This
broadening of our business together
with our successful business model is
expected to support the continuing
proﬁtable growth of Laird Security

 Abcam is successfully transitioning from a small high growth company to a 
substantial, sustainable growth business. This has been achieved by continuing 
to leverage our market leadership position in core primary antibody products, 
while increasing market share in non-antibody products. We have experienced 
a period of significant financial and operational growth as we deliver against 
our challenging goals. Our success gives us confidence in our strategy and in 
the long-term future of Abcam.

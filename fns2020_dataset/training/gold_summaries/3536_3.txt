Our focus on the customer experience  
remains as important as always.
I am pleased to report yet another successful year of trading for 
the Group. For the first time in its history, in 2011 Cineworld became 
the top cinema operator in the combined UK and Irish market for 
the year with a gross box office market share of 24.6%, according 
to Rentrak/EDI. It is a clear demonstration of the success of our 
efforts to increase the competitiveness of our film and retail offers, 
our pricing and the comfort and accessibility of our cinemas.
It is also a pleasure to report that the Board has proposed a 4.8% 
increase in the full year dividend for 2011 to 11.0p, which continues 
the year on year growth in dividends every year since we became  
a listed company. This proposal reflects the continued growth in 
revenues and profits and strong cash generation. Our sound financial 
position was further reinforced when a new £170 million, five year 
facility was put in place in March 2011.
The Group remains committed to expansion and investment and it 
was a busy year for the business in this respect. We successfully 
opened a new seven screen cinema in Leigh on 18 November on 
schedule in addition to the “The Screening Rooms” concept in 
Cheltenham in June. The expansion of our digital estate continues 
according to plan and it is anticipated that the final screen in our 
estate will be converted in the summer of 2012. Our efforts to 
purchase the Cinesur chain of cinemas in Spain were unsuccessful 
as the vendors were unable to meet the contractual conditions  
for completion. Despite this outcome we remain keen to grow  
our business and continue to look for suitable expansionary 
opportunities that are in the best interests of our shareholders.
Our focus on the customer experience remains as important as 
always. We pride ourselves on offering our customers the widest 
film range of any of the major exhibitors in the UK. We are committed 
to expanding our Unlimited subscription programme, a unique 
offering in UK and Ireland. Investment in technology plays an 
important part in our plans and we have a major IT systems upgrade 
in progress which is well advanced and will ensure that we have 
solid foundations for future growth. At the end of the year we also 
opened our first IMAX screen at our Edinburgh cinema which has 
initially performed above expectations. Two more screens are 
planned for other locations in 2012.
Maintaining and expanding the culture of strong governance 
throughout the whole organisation remains a key responsibility for 
the Board. We have followed the public debate on Board diversity 
with interest and continue to encourage the organisation to consider 
wider society matters, such as the environment, diversity and 
health and safety matters and constantly review our practices 
against perceived best practices.
There were some changes to the Board during the year. On 11 May 
2011, Matthew Tooth stepped down from the Board to concentrate 
on his Blackstone activities. On 10 June 2011, Richard Jones 
resigned from the Board and as Chief Financial Officer. I would like 
to thank both Matthew and Richard for their significant support and 
contributions over the years and for leaving Cineworld in a sound 
financial position. I would also like to welcome to the Board Philip 
Bowcock, who was appointed Chief Financial Officer on 1 December 
2011. Philip brings a wealth of experience and skills relevant to 
Cineworld’s activities and I look forward to working with him.
We all know that the economic and financial outlook will continue 
to be challenging and that we face a tough competitive landscape. 
We have made a sound start to the new financial year and whilst 
the forthcoming European Football Championship and London 
Olympics will present further challenges, there is a strong line up 
of films to support the rest of the year. I remain positive about the 
future prospects of the Group. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our management and 
our employees for their hard work and achievements. Our people 
are highly motivated and passionate about delivering success and 
the Group remains in a strong financial and competitive position 
– the result of a successful business model which continues to prove 
its resilience and which offers opportunities for growth. I look forward 
to working with management and staff to move the business 
forward and reporting continued growth to you, our shareholders.

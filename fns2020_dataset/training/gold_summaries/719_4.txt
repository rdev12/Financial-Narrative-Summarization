has an extended applications portfolio 
for the Healthcare sector which 
includes regulatory compliance 
corporate governance, risk and

Where we are
Headquartered in the UK, Allocate 
now has operations on four continents 
and supply customers in over 10 
countries. There was significant growth 
in Europe in 2010 – driven by the 
acquisition of Time Care in Sweden – 
and in Australia, following the signing 
of two substantial contracts with the 
New South Wales Department of 
Health and the Australian Army.
A presence has been established in 
the Middle East for Healthcare and in 
the US for Healthcare and Maritime, 
reducing Allocate’s dependence on 
the UK public sector and providing 
broader opportunities for growth.

 14 De La Rue Annual Report 2013
Chairman’s statement
Group results
Against a backdrop of a more challenging 
currency market, including delays in 
expected orders, the Group has reported 
an 8 per cent reduction in revenue to 
£483.7m (2011/12: £528.3m). 
Operating profit before exceptional items 
was in line with the prior year at £63.2m 
(2011/12: £63.1m). Profit before tax and 
exceptional items increased by 2 per cent 
to £59.1m (2011/12: £57.7m) reflecting 
lower finance costs. 
Exceptional charges in the year totalled 
£7.6m (2011/12: £24.8m) predominantly  
in relation to the ongoing implementation  
of the Improvement Plan.
Headline earnings per share, before 
exceptional items, increased by 2 per cent 
to 44.4p (2011/12: 43.5p). Basic earnings 
per share was 43.3p (2011/12: 31.8p).
De La Rue has continued its track  
record of good cash generation with 
net cash of £40.4m generated from 
operations. At the year end, the Group 
had a modest level of net debt of £76.7m 
(2011/12: £24.8m). Interest cover, before 
exceptional items, remained strong at  
18 times (2011/12: 15 times).
Dividend
The Board is recommending a  
final dividend of 28.2p per share  
(2011/12: 28.2p per share), reflecting  
its continuing confidence in both the 
strength of the business and in delivering 
the Improvement Plan. Together with the  
interim dividend paid in January 2013,  
this will give a total dividend for the year of  
42.3p per share (2011/12: 42.3p per share).  
Subject to approval by shareholders, the final  
dividend will be paid on 1 August 2013 to  
shareholders on the register on 5 July 2013.
Strategy
In May 2011 the Group announced the 
three year Improvement Plan, and focus on 
this will remain the priority for the business 
until the conclusion of the 2013/14 
financial year. In the year to March 2013 
we continued to build on De La Rue’s 
fundamental strengths and on addressing 
the opportunities for improvement in many 
parts of the business. As is reported below, 
significant progress, particularly on process 
improvement and cost reduction, has been 
delivered and will continue in the 2013/14 
financial year.
We enter the year with increased cost savings identified and  
a strong pipeline of order opportunities, which must of course  
be secured for delivery in the year. As a result, the Board remains 
confident of achieving the 2013/14 Improvement Plan target.

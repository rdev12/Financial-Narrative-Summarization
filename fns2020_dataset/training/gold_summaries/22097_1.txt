 Chief Executive’s report
I am pleased to present my second report as Chief Executive.
As set out in the Chairman’s statement, the only major structural change to the Group this year was the decision to
withdraw from our investment in Duncan Lawrie. A combination of lower interest rates, a weaker housing market
and the consequent need to inject significantly more capital than we had anticipated led to the decision to dispose
of this operation.
Now that the sale of the asset management division of Duncan Lawrie has received the relevant regulatory
approvals for the change of control, the transaction is expected to complete in May 2017 we will then be able to
finalise the process of formally winding down the bank and extract the capital that the Group has invested. This
capital will then be available for investment in the Group’s remaining operations, subject to ensuring that we are
able to meet our obligations as regards the pension fund deficit described more fully in the Chief Financial
Officer’s report on page 16.
I am pleased to report improved performance from all three remaining divisions, reflecting the increased focus on
these businesses arising from the managerial changes announced last year.
As a result of the decision to withdraw from Duncan Lawrie, the Group’s remaining assets in Banking and
Financial Services consist only of associate companies and therefore this is no longer reported as a separate
division.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
The overall Group strategy, which is set out on page 18, remains unchanged with each division expected to
perform against an agreed divisional strategy which sets out the goals and targets for the short and medium term
and are set out below.
Agriculture
The Agriculture division strategy remains the same with the focus on our core crops of tea, macadamia and
avocado where we have scale and geographic spread and therefore the opportunity to build a significant market
presence.
Agriculture is the largest division, accounting for c80% of Group turnover and is the area where we have the
greatest critical mass and see the best opportunities for the Group at the current time. It is therefore likely that this
will be a focus for future investment.
Engineering
Engineering North. AJT Engineering continues to be impacted by the low oil price and the sharply reduced
investment from the oil industry in the North Sea. Significant steps have been taken to reduce the size of the
workforce, cut costs and diversify the business into other industries. Good progress has been made in this direction
in both the rail and hydroelectric sectors, but the future for AJT Engineering will depend on a recovery of the oil
sector in the North Sea.
Engineering South. The principal driver of growth in Engineering South continues to be Abbey Metal Finishing
and its joint venture in Germany, Atfin which returned to profitability last year. Neither is yet at full capacity and
both companies will continue to grow their customer base in the aerospace industry.
We intend for the remaining businesses in Engineering South to continue to grow organically over the coming
years.
Food Service
UK. ACS&T operates as a niche high quality operator in the storage and distribution of frozen foods together
with some ambient food service provision as demand and space allows. The business will expand and invest where
appropriate to serve the needs of its customers.
Netherlands. Affish and Wylax, our fish trading and distribution businesses in the Netherlands, returned to
profitability last year following the change in management early in 2016. They continue to work on their medium
term strategy.

Chief Executive’s report
Investments
Investment Portfolio. The Group has a portfolio, principally of listed investments, the strategy for which remains to
invest for the long term in high quality companies where we believe that there is long term value. This portfolio
also enables us to balance our geographic risk exposure.
Investment Property. The strategy is to continue to invest in quality assets where an appropriate yield may be
realised. The process of developing some of our existing properties to enhance yield will continue.
Collections. The Group has collections of art, philately and manuscripts which are regularly reviewed and are added
to or sold as appropriate in order to enhance the collections.
Associates
The Group has three associate companies in the financial services sector of which BF&M, the listed Bermudian
insurance business is the most significant, our shares in this company having a market value of £52.2 million at
31 December 2016. With all our associates, we continually monitor our investment and may increase or decrease
our holding in the future.
PERFORMANCE
Agriculture
Tea Production
2016 was a record year for global tea production and within the Group we achieved record production levels in
India, Bangladesh and Kenya. However, whilst global consumption continues to rise, it is not at the rate of the
production increases experienced last year and therefore 2016 saw price pressure in all the major tea producing
countries. This, combined with an increasing production cost base, primarily through wage inflation, eroded
margins.

Tea pricing and operations
India
Our Indian tea operations saw a record production of 28.6 million kg, 10.9% higher than 2015 as a result of
excellent growing conditions, particularly in Assam. Average tea prices in 2016 were up 1.7% in Rupee terms
against 2015 levels. However, we believe that prices would have been higher had it not been for the problems with
the implementation of the Pan India Tea Auction and the well-publicised impact of Indian demonetisation. Costs
of labour continue to rise at a higher rate than prices and therefore we are investing in the mechanisation of field
operations and the automation of our factory processes to improve productivity and reduce costs. In 2016, all
spraying activities were mechanised along with some pruning and plucking.
Packet tea volumes were maintained at similar levels to last year and average selling prices were 3.1% higher than
those of 2015.
All Assam and Darjeeling estates are Rainforest Alliance certified and all factories are FSSC 22000 (Food Safety
System Certification) certified.
Camellia Plc Chief Executive’s report

Bangladesh
Production on our Bangladesh estates was also at record levels, being 36.9% higher than in 2015 due to benign
weather conditions and the significant investments made over the last few years to improve yields. Average prices
achieved were up 11.8% on 2015 reflecting the continuation of high duty tariffs on imported tea and strong local
demand. However, there was a notable decline in prices towards the end of the year as the Chittagong auction
became over supplied and this has continued during the first quarter of 2017.
During 2016 infilling was completed on the previous four years’ replanting. A multiyear project to develop
reservoir capacity for irrigation is underway.
Kenya
Kenya also achieved record production in 2016, but as a result of excellent growing conditions across Kenya (total
country production was 19% up on 2015), the average tea price was 21.4% lower than in 2015. 95% of Kenyan
teas are exported and prices are subject to significant volatility linked to production volumes. Fluctuations in the
Kenyan tea price have a major impact on Group profitability. During the year, the Labour Court awarded an
increase of 32% in wage rates spread over 2014 and 2015, but this remains subject to appeal and further
negotiations with the trade unions.
During 2016 we increased the area of production under mechanical harvesting as well as increasing the level of
automation in some of our factories. All factories are FSSC 22000 certified and all estates and outgrowers are
Rainforest Alliance certified.
To date in 2017 there has been a drought across the entire tea producing area of Kenya, resulting in reduced
volumes of crop and an increase in prices. 2017 will see a general election and continued discussions with trade
unions and the Labour Court to resolve the ongoing impasse on wages.
Malawi
Production in Malawi also increased in 2016 and consequently pricing was down 6.4% on 2015. Production costs
per kg were higher than those of 2015 despite the higher crop, reflecting inflationary pressure through substantial
currency devaluation and significant wage increases. With our backing and support, the tea industry in Malawi has
engaged in an industry revitalisation programme which looks to achieve, inter alia, a rise in wages and
improvement in production levels as well raising the quality and price of Malawi’s tea. To date there has been good
progress in engaging with the trade union resulting in the signing of the first ever collective bargaining agreement
in the industry’s history in Malawi.
All estates and outgrowers are Rainforest Alliance certified, two factories have UTZ certification and three factories
have FSSC 22000 certification.
2017 started with good growing conditions due to a normal wet season and prices have remained reasonably firm
on the back of reduced volumes from Kenya. In 2016 we started producing a green tea which has been well
received by the market, and we will be looking to increase volumes in 2017.

Macadamia production in 2016 was significantly reduced in Malawi and South Africa due to the drought that
affected both regions and the consequential reduction in nut size. In Kenya the estates are still predominantly
immature and production is increasing in line with the maturity of the trees. 9
Chief Executive’s report
Macadamia Pricing
Average prices for macadamia in 2016 were up 2.1% on 2015 levels, which reflected the reduced volumes across
the industry brought on by the droughts in South Africa and Malawi. The Group has created a brand ‘Maclands’,
to promote and market our macadamia nuts to wholesalers and food manufacturers.
Macadamia Operations
Malawi
Production of macadamia nuts was down 26.8% on the previous year due to the impact of dry weather
conditions. This has also impacted 2017 volumes which are significantly lower than those of 2016. The processing
factory has been FSSC 22000 certified.
South Africa
Volumes in 2016 were 53.8% below those of 2015, again reflecting the drought during 2015. Despite more
normal rainfall in the last few months, the drought conditions experienced in 2016 are also likely to have an
adverse effect on the crop for 2017. The ongoing development of the Mambedi Estate to macadamia orchards was
delayed due to the drought but is expected to resume in 2017. The processing factory successfully completed the
second phase of upgrading and has been FSSC 22000 certified.
Kenya
New plantings continued with 97 Ha being planted in the year. Construction of a macadamia processing factory,
which began in April 2015, was completed in time to process the 2016 harvest and has operated ahead of
expectations. The facility has been FSSC 22000 certified.
As with Malawi and South Africa 2017 yields are expected to suffer from the dry weather experienced in 2016
such that overall volumes in Kenya are expected to be similar to that of 2016.

Good rainfall supported a satisfactory crop for the year, being 2% down on 2015 volumes (including smallholders).
Average prices for Hass avocados in 2016 were at record levels (up 28.8% on 2015) as a result of demand from the
European market. New plantings totalling 39 Ha of orchard were established and this development will continue in
2017. The avocado operations are FSSC 22000, Tesco’s Natures Choice and GLOBALG.A.P. certified and
Rainforest Alliance will be added to this list in 2017. The smallholder initiative is gaining momentum with the
number of registered growers increasing each year.

Speciality Crops Pricing and Operations
Record soya production levels were recorded and the maize and soya crops in Brazil sold at significantly higher
average prices than in 2015.
Sales volumes for rubber were 20% below those of 2015, however prices in 2016 were 6.8% higher reflecting
increasing demand for natural latex.
Prices for California citrus were down 9.2% in the year and in common with other California based growers, our
volumes were also lower.
Average prices for pistachios in 2016 were 50% lower than 2015 levels due to record crops in California. 2017 is an
‘off’ year.
Wine grape production in South Africa was down 30% on last year due to the dry weather conditions and bottled
wine sale volumes were also lower. Results were in line with expectations although slightly down on the previous year.
Almond prices were reasonable despite the large crops in California and profits have been included in Group profit
in 2016 for the first time.
Prices for fresh pineapple production in Kenya were marginally up on 2015.
Forestry operations continued to produce satisfactory volumes for fuel wood and value addition products.
We continue to raise cattle on those areas of the Kakuzi estate in Kenya unsuitable for crop development.
In total, the Agriculture division made a trading profit of £29.9 million (2015: £26.7 million) on turnover of
£207.1 million (2015: £186.5 million).
Engineering
Engineering North
Engineering North had a difficult year with the low oil price continuing to affect North Sea investment and
impacting the order book for AJT Engineering in Aberdeen. T urnover at AJT Engineering fell from £9.6 million in
2015 to £6.9 million in 2016. With the oil price remaining low, the company is braced for another difficult year
although it is to be hoped that the investment made in diversification into other sectors referenced above will start
to show results this year. AJT Engineering achieved ISO 14001:2015 certification.
Engineering South
Abbey Metal Finishing returned to an operating profit in 2016 for the first time since the move to its new facility
in 2010. Demand for its services in the aerospace sector shows no sign of slowing down and the company is now
working on projects for Airbus, Rolls-Royce and SAFRAN. Its subsidiary, Atfin in Germany, has also now been
approved by a number of key customers including Rolls-Royce, MTU and Aubert & Duval, and moved into profit
in the last quarter of 2016. 11
Chief Executive’s report
XiMo
XiMo, our industrial catalyst research and development business, continues to develop products with the objective
of commercial use. In common with other research based businesses, it is expected to lose money pending the
outcome of commercial trials.
In total, the Engineering division made a trading loss of £2.6 million (2015: trading loss £5.5 million) on turnover
of £18.8 million (2015: £25.8 million).
Food Service
ACS&T saw turnover fall by 8.7% following a withdrawal from unprofitable business and as a result profits were
in line with those of 2015. Capacity utilisation to date in 2017 has been significantly higher than normal for the
time of year. ACS&T achieved ISO 14001:2015 certification.
In the Netherlands, both Affish and Wylax experienced challenging trading conditions, particularly as a result of
currency movements, the impact of which had to be partially absorbed, but they have both returned to
profitability.
In total the Food Service division made a trading profit of £0.8 million (2015: £0.7 million) on turnover of
£31.6 million (2015: £31.9 million).
Investments
Investment Portfolio. Despite the significant fluctuations in both global equity and currency markets the value of
the portfolio increased, assisted by the relative weakness of sterling. During the year we divested our long term
holding in Ascendant Group and a number of additions and disposals were made across the portfolio. The gains
on sale for the year were £1.5 million (2015: £0.4 million). The total value of the portfolio at 31 December 2016
was £37.2 million (2015: £30.6 million).
Investment Property. The site previously occupied by Loddon Engineering was transferred to investment property
and has been let this year.Improvements were also carried out on certain properties. Following refurbishment,
6 Hobart Place, London is now available for rent.
Collections. The collections are held at cost. A number of minor additions and disposals were made during the year.
Associates
BF&M experienced strong underlying trading in 2016. However, claims arising from the damage caused by
hurricanes Matthew in the Bahamas and Nicole in Bermuda reduced profits for the year by Bermudian Dollar
10.1 million and together with claims arising from a significant fire in Bermuda led BF&M to report a profit
before tax of Bermudian Dollar 17.9 million (2015: Bermudian Dollar 30.1 million). BF&M has been accounted
for as an associate since 1 July 2015.
Our two associate companies in Bangladesh, United Insurance and United Finance, saw profits lower than 2015
reflecting increased competition in the insurance industry and lower interest rates respectively.
In total, the share of the results of associates amounted to £5.1 million (2015: £4.2 million).
Discontinued Operation – Duncan Lawrie
During the year, the Board announced the discontinuation of Duncan Lawrie’s operations. The UK loan book has
been sold to Arbuthnot Latham and we also announced the sale of the UK asset management division to Brewin
Dolphin, subject to regulatory approval. Regulatory approval for the change of control has since been received.
In the Isle of Man, agreement has been reached with First Names Group to manage the trust business for a period
of 6 months. During this time, the clients will be asked to transfer their business to First Names Group. An
agreement has also been signed with Canaccord Genuity for the sale of the Isle of Man asset management business.
An orderly wind down of Duncan Lawrie’s deposit taking and other banking operations in the UK and Isle of
Man is underway. Duncan Lawrie is fully funded to return all cash balances to clients.

POLITICAL, LEGISLATIVE and LEGAL ISSUES
The Group is present in many jurisdictions, and is subject to local legislation. The following issues either have had,
or may have, a material impact on the Group:
• As stated last year, at the start of 2016 the Government of Malawi put forward new legislation which
proposed, inter alia, the conversion of all freehold property into 50 year leaseholds. There has been no update
on this proposed legislation and therefore the impact on the Group is hard to assess.
• The Board continues to monitor and assess the impact of the UK’s exit from the EU. To date the impact of
the decision has been broadly confined to currency movements but we remain concerned about the costs of
imports, particularly tea, on demand and the prices paid to producers.
• In India, a long running dispute between our local subsidiaries and the Government of West Bengal over the
payment of a land tax, locally called ‘Salami’, remains unresolved. Lawyers acting for the Group have advised
that payment of Salami does not apply, accordingly no provisions have been made.
• The general election in Kenya is due to take place on 8 August 2017. Historically these have been occasions of
significant and sometimes violent unrest and we continue to monitor the situation carefully.
DEVELOPMENT
We continued to invest in our assets during the year and £10.2 million was spent on property, plant and
equipment and investment property (2015: £19.4 million) including the following key projects:
• Completion of the macadamia cracking facility in Kenya
• Phase 2 of the upgrade to the macadamia cracking facility in South Africa
• Significant upgrades to the winery in South Africa
• Improvements at nine tea factories
• Additional irrigation facilities in India, Bangladesh, Kenya, Malawi and South Africa including the creation of
three new reservoirs in Bangladesh
• Improvements to our investment property portfolio.
In addition to our continuous programme of replanting our tea areas, a programme to extend our planted areas in
macadamia and avocado has been underway for a number of years and in 2016:
• 65 Ha (2015: 36 Ha) of new avocado plantings were completed in Kenya
• 97 Ha (2015: 158 Ha) of new macadamia plantings were carried out in Kenya, 47 Ha (2015: 81 Ha) in
South Africa and 12 Ha (2015: 5 Ha) in Malawi.
SUSTAINABILITY AND CSR
Responsibility
The Group’s businesses are fundamentally connected to the welfare of our communities and the environments in
which we operate. We proactively invest to ensure that the environments where we do business are continually
protected and improved. Our focus is on the long-term stability, security and continuity of our businesses and
those communities.
In order to achieve this, we invest in, monitor and report on both Environmental and Social sustainability
initiatives across all our divisions. In 2016, for the first time the Group compiled its global environmental
footprint beyond CO2 emissions. We measured and reviewed our impact in Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG),
Water and Waste, the results of which are summarised below. The Group is currently developing a range of long-
term reduction targets on which we will report in due course.
Whilst monitoring and reducing our environmental footprint is critical, so too is ensuring the well-being of the
communities in which we operate and on which we depend. We refer to this as ‘social sustainability’. The level of
health and educational facilities available from state governments varies widely across our operations, and
consequently so does the focus and scale of our social sustainability projects. The level of support provided to
many of these communities by the Group is substantial and is summarised below. We also need to ensure that all our operations can demonstrate that they meet the requirements of our customers
in terms of traceability and accreditation. 63% of our tea gardens are RFA certified and all our macadamia and
avocado operations are FSSC 22000 certified. Further details of these are included in the operational reports
above.
Environmental Sustainability
The key metrics for the Group include Greenhouse Gas emissions, water usage and waste produced. The table
below sets out those metrics and also how they have developed since 2013.

1. The significant increase in tea production in 2016 coupled with a lack of availability of other sources of power
has led to an increase in Greenhouse Gas emissions in 2016 of 6.0%. Power shortages and the reliance on
fossil fuels is a feature of developing countries and we are working to develop alternative, cleaner sources of
energy.
2. The continued drought in Malawi and South Africa has increased the irrigation requirements of our
Agricultural businesses.
3. Compost from agriculture accounts for over 80% of our waste impact. We are working to reduce waste and
improve our recycling rates across all business units.
Some of the initiatives we are undertaking include:
• Pursuing operational efficiency, we are sharing energy management knowledge and expertise across our
operations.
• Investment in renewable energy via solar projects in India and Africa, and environmental management
systems adopted by all EU businesses.
• Developing modern water management solutions in many of our operations, such as micro-sprinklers in
Africa and Regulated Deficit Irrigation. We build damns to collect water and support local wildlife and create
wetlands to improve waste water quality before release into the waterways. Our work in this area is recognized
by GLOBAL G.A.P . who awarded their International Award for Sustainable Water Use to our ‘Stretching the
Rains’ project at Kakuzi, Kenya.
Social Sustainability
The key areas of social sustainability that we consider important are access for our employees to a fair wage and for
them and their families to education, healthcare and housing. The table below shows the provision of schools and
healthcare by the Group in 2016. In addition, we provide housing for over 200,000 people.

*The funding and operation of schools and hospitals, provided for our workers and their communities, varies by location in accordance with
local culture, practice and requirement. Some facilities are owned and operated by us directly, whilst others are fully or partly funded by us
whilst being state and/or NGO managed and owned.
Chief Executive’s report

Camellia Plc Through a broad range of initiatives in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) across the group, we contribute to
improved health and nutrition, hygiene and sanitation of our communities. We seek to optimise local
infrastructure by supporting roads, access to water, local healthcare initiatives and education projects. This year, we
have actively supported Forum for the Future’s Tea 2030 and Ethical Tea Partnership’s Malawi 2020 tea
revitalisation projects. Our continued focus on developing sustainable housing for our working communities is
reflected in major housing renewal projects in Malawi, Kenya and India.
Health
On an ongoing basis, the majority of our tea estates in India and Bangladesh have a hospital or a clinic and in
India and Bangladesh we have central Group operated hospitals to which more serious cases can be referred. We
provide medical services including where appropriate antiretroviral drugs in those communities where HIV/AIDs
is prevalent. We also give medical support to schools that are either run locally or by our companies.
Pursuing our vision to contribute to greater health, every year we engage in projects which contribute to the health
of the local community. For example this year we helped fund a new paediatric wing in a local hospital in Malawi
and over 300 special needs children were educated at the Goodricke School for Special Education and Interlink
Calcutta (of which we fund 50% of the running costs).
Education
Central to our social initiatives is the ability to provide the opportunity for development for all. We provide
schools and crèches in areas where we operate, either by building and running the schools or by supporting state
educational projects in our communities. We support almost 32,000 children each year through education
initiatives.
Smallholders
Demonstrating our commitment to responsible sourcing, we developed the first, fully commercialised, smallholder
empowerment scheme in East Africa, SIREET. This and other smallholder programmes form an integral part of
our businesses in Kenya, Malawi and India.
Amongst other initiatives, we processed 86.3 million kg of green leaf tea and 1.6 million kg of avocados were
packed and exported for smallholders during the year, we also ran agricultural practice training days. These
initiatives enabled over 20,000 local farmers to improve their earnings by benefiting from our agricultural
expertise, infrastructure and access to market.
Wages
The remuneration of workers in the tea industry remains a serious challenge. Resolving the issue of low pay in this
industry is a complex task which has to involve growers, buyers, retailers, NGOs and governments but ultimately
will not be addressed until the price of a cup of tea adequately reflects the resources required to produce it. We
believe in taking an active role in this process and will continue to back up our principles with action.
As a Group we are committed to paying fair wages, benefits and allowances in accordance with local legislation
and trade union agreements and have received certifications from UTZ, Fairtrade and the Rainforest Alliance,
which require an audit of the Group’s employment practices as part of maintaining the accreditations. We are also
a key part of a number of other initiatives to address the issue of low pay in developing countries. All our UK
companies are Living Wage accredited employers.
SUMMARY
In summary, I am pleased with the performance of the Group this year, albeit there remains much to do. Clearly the
disposal of our interest in Duncan Lawrie was disappointing but the improved performance in all the continuing
divisions is encouraging. Furthermore the cash that will become available from the closure of Duncan Lawrie,
together with the substantial cash balances available elsewhere in the Group, will allow us to take advantage of the
opportunities that will come. Inevitably many of the markets that we are in will continue to face challenges but I
believe that we are well placed to face these and confident in our ability to continue to grow the business.

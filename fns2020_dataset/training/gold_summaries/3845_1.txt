Annual Report and Accounts 2007
>  Possession – personal use  
or supply?
      A UK police force arrested two men 
with substantial quantities of heroin 
and cocaine in their possession, but 
they claimed that the drugs were for 
their own personal use, for which 
the penalties are far less severe 
than if convicted of drug dealing. 
      The Senior Investigating Officer 
collected hair samples from each  
of the arrestees and requested a 
“TrichoTest”. Our analysis was able 
to prove there was a small amount 
of cocaine detected in one of the 
arrestees, but no heroin. No drugs 
were detected in the other arrestee. 
This evidence was used as part  
of the Crown Prosecution’s case 
that the two men were dealers  
and were not likely to have been  
in possession of the drugs for 
personal use.
Consolidation
In the space of a year Concateno has 
developed the leading European drug  
and alcohol testing business which had 
previously been differentiated through 
alternative testing methodologies in  
adjacent markets.
Concateno’s aim is to link these disparate 
practices and technologies to provide 
customers with a single-source solution  
to their drugs-of-abuse testing needs. This 
is achieved through offering a “chain” of 
services and giving clients the opportunity 
to fully outsource a legally defensible 
drugs-of-abuse programme with a  
global collection network and policy 
planning service.
Integration
At the time of the acquisition of Cozart plc 
the Group stated that it would seek to 
achieve annualised synergies of £3m by 
the end of 2008. Of this £1m was related  
to duplicate corporate costs, the savings 
for which were realised in October 2007.
The additional £2m is to be achieved 
through further operational, purchasing 
and revenue synergies and we are well 
progressed in realising these synergies. 
In November 2007, we appointed Nigel 
Withey as Chief Operating Officer to drive 
forward the integration process. Nigel’s 
career was spent managing, acquiring and 
integrating businesses within the standards 
certification and inspection industries. He 
has over 13 years of senior management 
experience with BSI Group and Inenco plc.
Over the past few months we have 
undertaken a thorough consultation 
process and as a result have taken the 
following steps:
Integration of the Warrington-based 
laboratory into our Abingdon site; 
completion is due in May 2008.
Closure of our Paddington office with 
the migration of operations to our 
Abingdon site; completion is due in 
June 2008.
Closure of our Liverpool office with the 
migration of the workstreams into our 
Cardiff and London operations; 
completion is due in May 2008.
Closure of our office in Gothenburg, 
Sweden with the migration of the 
workstreams into our London 
operations with support functions  
being continued through our office  
in Stockholm.

As previously reported the Board had 
considered moving the Canary Wharf 
operations to our Abingdon site but after a 
detailed review it was concluded that the 
£2m operational synergies were better 
achieved through the strategy outlined 
above and at less risk to the business.
At the end of the process we will have 
three state-of-the-art laboratories in  
the UK.
The London laboratory, at Canary 
Wharf, will specialise in high volume, 
rapid-turnaround urine testing.
The Abingdon laboratory will specialise 
in high volume, rapid-turnaround  
oral fluid testing, as well as being  
our main R&D and manufacturing  
centre in the UK.
The Cardiff site will be our lower  
volume hair testing and confirmation 
testing centre. Family law requires more 
detailed analysis of substance abuse 
over longer time periods and must be 
analysed in a more labour intensive 
process, often including the provision  
of written evidence reports for use  
in court.
We are negotiating further procurement 
synergies with our suppliers, many of 
whom supplied products to a number  
of the companies that we acquired in the 
year. These negotiations are ongoing and 
we expect to achieve material cost savings. 
Through our extensive sales, distribution 
and collection networks, we are able to 
offer a wider range of third-party solutions 
and products to customers and we are  
in active negotiations with a number  
of parties.
Through our in-house manufacturing of 
drug testing products we are investigating 
ways of replacing current third-party 
products to realise further margin 
improvements.
We are in the process of bringing together 
our UK and worldwide collections network 
so that we can offer one seamless service 
to all divisions of the Group and collections 
staff are being trained on all product 
offerings. The creation of this combined 
worldwide collection network allows us to 
provide a unique service to customers 
including the provision of an emergency 
response service.

Market sectors
Alongside these operational and 
procurement synergies we are re-aligning 
our sales and marketing and customer 
support service operations to better  
target and address the needs of various 
market sectors. Our sales, marketing  
and customer service teams have been 
integrated accordingly to meet the detailed 
requirements of each market sector.  
This is being executed through the 
Concateno brand name, with product 
offerings remaining associated with  
key acquired brands. 
Business units
The Group has three main business units.
Laboratory services
Our laboratories have the highest levels of 
Accreditation and Quality Assurance and 
work actively within the industry to improve 
upon existing best practice. This includes 
ISO 17025 (independently audited by 
UKAS), ISO9001:2000, Link-Up, 
ISO13485:2003 and CPA (Clinical 
Pathology Accredited). In addition, we are 
subject to a range of external and internal 
Quality Assurance programmes. We can 
test for all of the major types of drugs of 
abuse and have recently introduced 
Benzene testing for clients looking to meet 
Health and Safety policy requirements. 
Because Concateno is able to collect and 
test samples under a full chain of custody 
all the way from supervision of the initial 
sample collection, and despatch, through 
to the initial screening and any subsequent 
detailed confirmation work, we can ensure 
that there is a robust, unbroken and 
verifiable audit trail which allows the  
results to be used as evidence in court 
when required.
manufacturing arm in Abingdon creating  
a strong platform for margin improvement 
throughout the rest of the Concateno 
Group. 
Geographical reach
Concateno has offices in the UK, Sweden, 
Spain and Italy and distribution channels  
in over 80 countries throughout the world. 
Our aim is to focus the development of our 
laboratory services and POCT offerings in 
key markets, with initial focus in the UK, 
Scandinavia and Australia.
Our laboratory products offering has a 
wide spread of sales throughout the world 
including Europe and South America. 
China, India, Russia and Africa are seen  
as significant growth markets. 
New developments
Concateno continues to develop new 
technologies and applications. During the  11
Concateno plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
past year we have launched blood borne 
virus testing for diseases such as HIV and 
hepatitis. In March UKAS confirmed that 
TrichoTech at our Cardiff site had gained 
accreditation to ISO 17025 standards for 
testing hair for EtG (an alcohol metabolite 
which enables testing for chronic long term 
alcoholism) and for GHB (a drug that can 
potentially be used in drug assisted sexual 
assaults and which has, until now, been 
undetectable unless tested immediately 
after the incident occurs). We continue  
to invest in the development of new 
applications and hope to make further 
announcements during the year.
Following an extensive trial programme 
with HM Prisons in 2007 the Group will 
commence buprenorphine testing in UK 
prisons from April 2008. After opiates and 
cannabis, buprenorphine is the third most 
abused drug in HM Prisons.
We have developed applications and 
services that enable us to better serve  
our clients including “Retriever”, a software 
product that enables clients to retrieve their 
results remotely and “ROMA” (“Record of 
My Achievement”), a programme that 
enables drug-users on rehabilitation 
programmes to track their progress.
We are currently undergoing research and 
initial operations in a number of countries 
outside Europe, including Australia where 
the State of Victoria police are trialling the 
Cozart
®
 DDS product at the roadside, and 
New Zealand.
Through our collaboration with Philips we 
are developing the next generation point-
of-care handheld testing device. The 
Cozart-Philips branded device will be able 
to test up to 8 drugs within 90 seconds 
and will be up to 100 times more sensitive 
and accurate than any other point-of-care 
analysers. Aimed primarily at the roadside 
testing market and workplace applications 
the product is due to launch in mid 2009 
and we believe that the product will 
revolutionise the market.
Through scale, Concateno is able to offer  
a unique service to customers throughout 
the world, supported by a philosophy of 
high quality customer service and product 
and service innovation. During 2008 we  
will complete the integration programme 
and build on the sales and marketing 
developments that are already  
progressing well.

>  Detecting alcohol and GHB in hair
      In March 2008 Concateno’s Cardiff facility gained a 
double global first by gaining accreditation for two 
of its tests to the international standard, known as 
ISO 17025.
      Gammahydroxybutrate (GHB) is one of a number of 
drugs cited in drug-assisted assaults, often referred 
to as a “date rape”, and Ethylglucuronide (EtG) is a 
metabolite created when alcohol is consumed. 
      When ingested, drugs enter the bloodstream and 
because each hair follicle has its own blood supply, 
traces of drugs end up in the hair core. Hair grows 
at a rate of about a centimetre a month, so testing  
a 3 centimetre sample can profile drug use over 
approximately 3 months. As many drug assisted 
assaults are not reported until it is too late to 
conduct a test on a urine or blood sample, the 
ability to go back a few months testing a lock of  
hair could prove invaluable. 
      With alcohol, current blood tests provide either a 
snapshot view of liver damage or a two week profile 
of alcohol use. An elevated EtG result in hair will 
indicate a potential alcohol  concern over a longer 
period of about a month. Combining these alcohol 
tests help add to the picture that local authorities 
and children’s guardians need  to make critical 
decisions on children’s safety. The Department of 
Health estimates around one million children in the 
UK are raised in families where one or both parents 
misuse alcohol.

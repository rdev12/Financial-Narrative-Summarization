David Adams Chairman
This year has been a landmark for the 
business, the successful Initial Public Offering 
(IPO) in July 2013 providing a more strategic 
platform for the Group’s development, an 
appropriate capital structure and importantly 
aligning the Group and its Franchisees  
through the Franchisee incentive scheme.  
The response to the float has been positive, 
demonstrating confidence in the business 
model and the team’s ability to drive a 
sustainable and profitable future for all our 
stakeholders.
We believe that our results as a listed 
company reflect delivery of the strategy and 
actions we set out clearly in the admission 
document. Our trading performance has been 
in line with our expectations, we have made 
acquisitions and there exist strong 
opportunities for future growth.
We are pleased to announce that the Board  
is proposing a final dividend of 6 pence per 
share, making a full-year dividend of 8 pence 
per share.
I joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director 
for the float in July 2013 and was delighted to 
step up to become Chairman in January, to 
succeed Roger Pedder, who retired from the 
Board in January 2014. In January 2014, we 
welcomed two new Non-Executive Directors, 
Steve Wilson and Martin Newman, who bring 
a wealth of relevant experience, and who  
are actively contributing to the Board and to 
the business.
Following seven years in the business Keith 
Webb, Franchisee Director, resigned from the 
Board today for personal reasons. Keith will 
remain in the business until 29 August 2014. 
The Board would like to thank Keith for his 
contribution to Conviviality and wishes him 
well for the future.
The strength of our business is in its people 
and I would like to thank, on behalf of the 
Board, all of our Franchise partners and 
everyone working in the business for their 
passion and commitment that is driving our 
success.

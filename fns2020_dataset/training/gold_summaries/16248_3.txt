 “WITH A YEAR-END NET CASH POSITIVE POSITION OF £94M UBM’S BALANCE SHEET IS EVEN
STRONGER THAN BEFORE. THIS GIVES US THE CAPACITY TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE
BUSINESS, LAUNCHING NEW PRODUCTS AND EXPANDING GEOGRAPHICALLY TO BETTER
SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS. ALL INVESTMENT PROPOSALS ARE SUBJECTED TO RIGOROUS
FINANCIAL HURDLES.”

ANNUAL REPORT 2002
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
IN NOVEMBER 2002 – FOLLOWING SIX YEARS AS A NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR – I TOOK
OVER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE UBM BOARD FROM RONNIE HAMPEL. I HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN EXCITED BY THE POTENTIAL AND THE INTERACTION OF THE MEDIA AND
TECHNOLOGY BUSINESSES AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WAS ATTRACTED
TO UNITED IN THE FIRST PLACE. ANOTHER MAJOR REASON WHY I WAS SO ENTHUSIASTIC
IN TAKING ON THE CHAIRMANSHIP IS BECAUSE OF UBM’S LONG TRACK RECORD IN
AMBITIOUSLY AND INNOVATIVELY CREATING VALUE THROUGH ITS BUSINESSES.
We invest steadily and patiently, both organically and by judicious acquisition to create major value for shareholders.
The ITV assets, which have been sold, and the Garban (now ICAP) business, now demerged, were both built up – largely
organically – over many years. five was started from scratch, and in just six years has taken 7.5 per cent of the television
advertising market with a particularly strong financial performance in 2002. Today’s core information service businesses
of market research, news distribution and professional media have roots within United stretching back to the 1970’s and
in some cases well beyond – some of CMPi’s and UAP’s major titles were launched in the nineteenth century!
In 2002, a major priority was restructuring the cost base in order to protect profit against the severe market downturn.
The numbers speak for themselves: over the past two years we have identified actions to reduce our fixed cost base
by over 25 per cent, securing £180m in annualised cost reductions. This has not however distracted us from the
fundamental task of creating future revenue growth and all of the divisions, often working together, have continued
to develop and launch a wide range of new products – building on long-term creative relationships with customers.
With a year-end net cash positive position of £94m, UBM’s balance sheet is even stronger than before. This gives us
the capacity to continue to expand the business, launching new products and expanding geographically to better
serve our customers. All such investment proposals are subjected to rigorous financial hurdles.
For the financial year 2002, EPS was 16.5p, down from 17.9 pence in 2001 reflecting the difficult trading conditions.
Nonetheless, the operating margin of 7.2 per cent in the second half of the year represents a significant improvement
on the 5.0 per cent for the same period in 2001. The board is recommending a final dividend for the year of 4 pence
per share, making the total dividend payable 7 pence per share. This is in line with our revised progressive dividend
policy announced last year and, if approved by shareholders at the AGM, it will be paid on 29 May 2003 to
shareholders on the register on 14 March 2003.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ronnie Hampel for his outstanding stewardship as chairman over the last
three years. Ronnie led the board in an exemplary manner during a period of significant corporate activity in which the
company transformed itself from broad-based consumer and business media interests into a sharply focused
professional information services company. We will miss his wise counsel. On behalf of the board and employees of
UBM, I would like to thank him for his major contribution to UBM and to wish him well in his continuing pursuits.
I would also very much like to thank all our employees for their contribution and commitment during 2002. They are
the creative and operational talent of UBM and the customer relationships they have cemented during this
challenging year have done much to consolidate UBM’s long term growth prospects.

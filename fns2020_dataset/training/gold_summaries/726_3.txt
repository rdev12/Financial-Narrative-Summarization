 Chairman’s review
“In a challenging year for the aviation industry, both
businesses performed well despite the economic
conditions, with sales growth achieved in the
second half reflective of our underlying potential. ”
Review of the year
Hostilities in the Middle East and the SARS virus 
made this a challenging year for air travel. Our 
first half sales increased by only 1% above the same 
period last year, with adjusted pre-tax profit (from
continuing operations but before goodwill
amortisation and exceptionals) declining 7.8%.
Second half performance for the Group was
significantly better, with sales ahead 9% and adjusted
pre-tax profit up nearly 9%. Overall, we achieved an
increase in sales for the year of 5% to £440.9m and
adjusted pre-tax profit ahead nearly 2% to £21.7m,
in line with expectations. After goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items, pre-tax profit for the year was
£17.4m (2002/03: £20.7m).
The Flight Services business suffered most – with
sales down 0.6% to £244.0m and an 11.2% reduction 
in adjusted operating profit (from continuing
operations but before goodwill amortisation and
exceptionals) from £16.0m in 2002/03 to £14.2m in
2003/04, including profit from associates.
Our Retail business continued to return year on year
growth. Sales increased 13.2% to £196.9m with a 29.4%
improvement in adjusted operating profit to £8.8m
(2002/03: £6.8m).

Alpha Airports Group Plc
Annual Report 2003/04
Dividend
With last year’s industry uncertainty, we held our final
dividend. This year, we are delighted to announce a
proposed 7.7% increase in the final dividend to
2.8 pence per share (2002/03: 2.6p) giving a full year
dividend per share of 3.8 pence, up 5.6% from 2002/03.
Our people
Heightened security clearance at UK airports has 
set us recruitment challenges, yet our employees
everywhere have continued to maintain the highest
standards of service in what has been a difficult 
year . The Board is exceedingly grateful for all our
employees’ hard work. In January we were sad to bid
farewell to 90 staff, many with long service; we wish
them every success in the future.
The Board
In my second year as Chairman we have seen
changes in corporate governance. The Board takes 
its responsibilities for ensuring high standards 
very seriously and swiftly puts in place changes
necessary to comply with the revised Combined Code.
The only exception is we have no senior independent
director . This is because we have an adequate
representation of skills across the current Board 
and in my role as independent non-executive
Chairman I remain the principal point of contact for
shareholders – a situation we will review annually.
Both Mr Ennesser (non-executive director
representing Servair) and I will be standing for
re-election at this year’s AGM. 
Mr Stephenson resigned from the Board in January.
We thank him for his tremendous contribution to the
Group both as employee and, latterly, a director .
Outlook
The new financial year has started well with sales
ahead of last year by over 10%. With a clear focus 
on delivering strategic and operational progress, 
we anticipate a year of growth and improved
performance.

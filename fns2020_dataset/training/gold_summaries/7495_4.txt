Making it Happen for Business Partners
The key to the success of the Homeserve model is 
to simply ‘make it happen’ for its 100 plus business 
partners.  Whether it delivers quality and speedy repairs 
or affordable but effective policy membership cover; its 
business partners want a product that customers can 
rely on at times of crisis.
Homeserve’s infrastructure of skilled contractors and 
directly employed tradesmen means it can deliver 
emergency repair services anywhere in the UK for 
any home emergency.  Homeserve’s expertise and 
experience in utility, appliance manufacturing, retail and 
household insurance and furniture retailing markets 
grows as more and more business partners opt to 
work with the company on policy membership.   This 
gives Homeserve a great competitive advantage for 
partners who want the reassurance of an ally that 
understands its market and can assist in the marketing, 
telemarketing, IT, complaint management, regulation & 
compliance and ﬁ nance aspects of the relationship.
Policy Membership
In 2004 Cambridge Water made a strategic decision to 
increase its revenues from non-regulated earnings. 
It made sense to offer added value to its own customer 
base without having to reinvent the wheel and without 
having to invest signiﬁ cant amounts up front. 
An afﬁ nity partnership with Homeserve GB presented 
an innovative solution with the introduction of 
Homeserve’s plumbing and drainage cover branded 
as Cambridge Water.  For a small annual premium, 
Cambridge Water customers would have access to 
speedy service for emergency plumbing and drainage 
repairs from Homeserve for up to four call outs a year.  
Homeserve developed a product that had a natural 
synergy with Cambridge Water’s to give ‘permission’ to 
sell to its customers. 
It took the pressure off Cambridge Water and 
quickly established the systems and processes to the 
marketing, sale and management of the product on its 
behalf, resulting in little cost or resource disruption to 
Cambridge Water.
The risk to Cambridge Water was minimal as payments 
are made on a per sale basis requiring no cash 
investment.
Homeserve’s experience in the water market as a 
support service is unrivalled as most water companies 
already work with Homeserve.
Homeserve was able to make Cambridge Water’s 
objectives happen.
In just less than a year, Cambridge Water achieved 
around 3% penetration of its customer base and has 
subsequently extended its relationship with Homeserve, 
now also offering its customers cover on water supply 
pipe.

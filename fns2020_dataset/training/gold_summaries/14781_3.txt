 Introduction
I am pleased to report improved
results in the second half of the
year and satisfactory full year 
results for the year ended 
31 December 2006.
The business has delivered 
further sales growth, and margins
are recovering after a period of
turbulence arising from increasing
commodity prices. 
Management have successfully
completed the first acquisition since
the Strategic Review in 2001, and
the business is well placed to make
further progress in 2007 . 
Results
As anticipated, profit before 
taxation reduced by 11% to £2.35m
(2005: £2.64m), although it should
be noted that much of this reduction
is attributable to the translation 
of dollar earnings at a weaker
exchange rate.
Earnings before exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation of 6.3p
were slightly ahead of market
expectation, although down by 
17% compared with 2005 (7 .6p).
Reported earnings, which reflect the
exceptional gain on sale of freehold
property, were 7 .0p (2005: 7 .6p).
Net cash inflow from operating
activities increased by 42% to
£0.85m (2005: £0.60m). Net bank
borrowings increased during the
year from £2.06m to £4.38m
reflecting investment in the
relocation of our office premises in
Hong Kong and also the acquisition
of KRP Power Source (UK) Limited
in August. 
Dividends
The Board proposes a final 
dividend of 2.45 pence per share
(2005: 2.4 pence) to be paid on 
8 May 2007 to shareholders on the
register on 13 April 2007 . This brings
the total dividends for the year to
3.6 pence per share, an increase 
of 3% over the prior year (3.5 pence
per share), which is covered by
earnings 1.9 times (2005: 2.2 times).
Company Secretary
David Collins retired as Company
Secretary on 31 December 2006
after more than twenty years 
of service to the company. 
Colin Wilson ACA was appointed 
as Group Financial Controller in 
April 2006, and assumed
responsibility as Company Secretary
upon David Collins’ retirement.
Prospects 
Following four years of profit
growth, the company has
demonstrated some resilience in
recovering from the challenging
market conditions prevalent in 
the first half of 2006. During the
second half of the year a turning
point was reached, with sales,
margins and operating cash flow 
all showing improvement. We look
forward with confidence to further
organic growth, and will continue 
to seek to augment this with
suitable acquisitions when
appropriate opportunities arise.

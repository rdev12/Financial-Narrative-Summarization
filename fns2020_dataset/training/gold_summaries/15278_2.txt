Underlying performance
The Group’s management uses underlying performance to plan for, control and assess the performance of the Group. Underlying performance differs from the statutory 
IFRS performance as it excludes the effect of special items, which are defined in note 2. The Board’s view is that underlying performance provides more meaningful 
information for the Group’s investors and so it is the primary focus of the Group’s narrative reporting. Where appropriate, statutory performance inclusive of special items  
is also described.

CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Introduction
The Group is pleased to announce 
the results for the year ended 
31 March 2015. We have again seen 
significant improvement to the Group’s 
pre-tax profitability, adjusted net asset 
value per share and market capitalisation 
this year, leading to Sirius not only being 
included in the FTSE AIM 100 Index for 
the first time but, at the time of this 
report, ranking 38
th
 in that table.
On 5 December 2014, Sirius completed 
its secondary listing on the JSE and, at the 
same time, successfully raised €40 million to 
support the expansion of its portfolio 
through the acquisition of four business 
parks for €70.9 million. These assets were 
purchased with an European Public Real 
Estate Association (“EPRA”) net initial yield 
of 8.1% and three of them have been 
financed with a five year €36 million bank 
facility with a 2.85% fixed interest rate. 
With an initial yield spread of greater than 
5.2% and plenty of value-added opportunities 
within the sites, these acquisitions are 
expected to be very accretive to earnings 
going forward, initially delivering a 
cash-on-cash yield of 12.9%. The JSE 
listing also further diversifies the Company’s 
shareholder base, providing existing and 
new South African investors with an 
opportunity to participate in the Company’s 
income and value generation potential. 
This increased liquidity and tradeability 
of the Company’s shares will further help 
Sirius grow in the future.
The intensive capex investment programme 
aimed at delivering organic growth has seen 
some encouraging results in the period. 
The programme commenced in January 2014 
and is focused on around 100,000 sqm of 
previously unlettable or under-rented space 
that was either vacant or significantly 
under-rented at the time the initiative 
commenced. The space targeted represented 
approximately 50% of the vacant space 
of the core portfolio. As at 31 March 2015, 
we have fully transformed 37,860 sqm 
of this space, of which 74% is let and is 
already contributing €1.96 million of 
rental income to the Group.
The value of our property portfolio has 
grown to €550.0 million as at 31 March 2015 
(31 March 2014: €445.5 million*), with 
€76.2 million of the increase attributable 
to the acquisitions (cost plus revaluation) 
and €28.3 million coming from revaluation 
uplift on the pre-acquisitions portfolio. 
The uplift on the latter is largely due to rental 
growth and improvement in service charge 
irrecoverability and we have as yet only 
seen a small amount of yield compression. 
We report a €5.3 million revaluation uplift 
on the recently acquired properties, which 
is a direct result of our ability to find properties 
to acquire at a discount to valuation. We are 
confident that there is potential for further 
uplifts on the total portfolio in the coming 
years from our asset management initiatives, 
especially as a result of our ongoing capex 
investment programme.
* Adjusted for disposals.
Financial results
The Company has seen further 
improvement in profitability in the 
period; recurring profit before tax* 
including acquisitions was €12.6 million 
and excluding the impact of acquisitions 
was €11.8 million (2014: €9.4 million^). 
As the acquisitions were completed near the 
end of the financial year, the contribution to 
these results is limited, but they will materially 
increase earnings in the coming financial year. 
The improvement from the pre-acquisitions 
portfolio has largely come from increased 
rental income from our organic growth 
initiatives, as well as some further improvement 
from our recovery of service charge costs. 
Total income on the entire portfolio was 
€45.4 million of which €43.9 million was 
derived from the pre-acquisitions portfolio 
(2014: €42.8 million^), and profit before 
tax for the period was €32.7 million 
(2014: €31.0 million), which includes the 
property revaluations. Annualised gross 
rent roll of the 33 business parks increased 
by 21% to €50.0 million (31 March 2014: 
€41.3 million) in the twelve month period, 
of which €6.4 million (15.4%) has come from 
the addition of the four acquisitions and 
€2.3 million (5.6%) has come from organic 
growth of the pre-acquisitions portfolio.
Funds From Operations** FFO increased to 
€14.3 million (2014: €11.2 million) and FFO 
per share was 2.6c*** (2014: 2.8c). 
Adjusted EPS* was 2.10c as at 31 March 2015 
(31 March 2014: 2.26c^), whilst EPS was 
4.84c (31 March 2014: 6.83c^).
*  Excludes property revaluation, related deferred tax, 
non-controlling interests, profits on disposals, 
change in fair value of derivative financial 
instruments and non-recurring items.
**  See note 25 to the financial statements 
for explanation.
^  Adjusted for surrender premium and disposals 
to get a like-for-like comparison.
*** Based on average number of shares in issue 
throughout the period. This is lower than the 
prior year owing to more shares in issue through 
equity raises and acquisitions only completing 
towards the end of the year. DPS is calculated 
on actual shares in issue and not average 
shares in issue.
In summary:
 » We have again seen significant improvement to the Group’s  
pre-tax profitability, adjusted net asset value per share and 
market capitalisation this year
 » The value of our property portfolio has grown to €550.0 million 
as at 31 March 2015
 » Sirius has completed the refinancing of all banking facilities

CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Portfolio valuation and net asset value continued
The revaluation uplift on the pre-acquisitions portfolio as at 31 March 2015 was €28 million, representing a 6.4% increase in the twelve 
month period. The revaluation uplift on the acquisition portfolio of €5.3 million (€9.5 million offset with €4.2 million of acquisition costs) 
represents a 7.5% increase on what was paid for the assets. This is now the fourth valuation in succession where values have increased and, 
once again, most of the increases are due to rental income improvements rather than yield compression. The €33.6 million total valuation 
uplift translates to a €25.4 million gain in our books as shown in the table below and is driven largely from the returns experienced from the 
deployment of €3.1 million of our capex investment programme, our ability to purchase assets at discounted prices, as well as achieving 
further improvements in rent roll and service charge recovery during the period through properties and other asset management initiatives.

The core portfolio, which now comprises 29 of the 33 assets, is valued at €515.1 million, representing an average gross yield of 8.9% 
(31 March 2014: 9.2%) and a net yield of 8.2% (2014: 8.3%). The average capital value per sqm is €547.10 (31 March 2014: €479.10), 
which remains significantly below replacement cost.

Dividend
In September 2014, the Board resolved to 
increase the dividend payable to shareholders, 
due to stronger cash generation from 
operations as a result of the capex investment 
programme and growth in rental income. 
The dividend policy was enhanced to 65% 
of FFO, rather than the previously announced 
policy that referred to recurring profit 
after tax.
I am therefore pleased to confirm the Board 
has declared a final dividend of 0.84c per 
share making a total dividend for the year 
of 1.61c per share. The ex-dividend date 
will be 8 June 2015 for shareholders on the 
JSE register and 11 June 2015 for shareholders 
on the LSE register. The record date will be 
12 June 2015 and the dividend will be paid 
on 10 July 2015.
Sirius continues to offer shareholders the 
ability to receive dividends in scrip rather 
than as a cash alternative, for which there 
was a 29% scrip take-up on the dividend 
paid on 31 December 2014. Details of the 
scrip offer for the final dividend will be 
mailed to shareholders shortly. The latest 
date the scrip election form can be accepted 
is expected to be 26 June 2015. 
Funding
Sirius has completed the refinancing of 
all banking facilities and the Group has 
now secured borrowings of €255.3 million 
with four different lenders, representing an 
LTV ratio of 46.8% based on book value. 
As previously announced it is the Board’s 
intention to reduce the LTV ratio to 40% 
in the near term through a combination 
of debt amortisation as well as further 
improved valuations driven by our capex 
investment programme and other asset 
management initiatives. The bank debt 
expiry dates on the four outstanding 
facilities range between January 2017 
and July 2023 with an average unexpired 
term of 4.4 years. The first facilities due 
for renewal are the two Macquarie facilities, 
repayable in January 2017. These two 
facilities, with €56 million outstanding, 
bear interest at a blended rate of 
approximately 7% and are subject to a full 
cash sweep. Refinancing these two facilities 
at the currently available rates would result 
in a significant improvement to the Group’s 
profitability and cash flow and the Board 
is currently in discussions with a number 
of financial institutions on this.
German SME market
Market conditions in the German economy 
continue to improve and we believe that 
the SME sector in particular is in a strong 
position when compared to the previous 
twelve months. Gross domestic product, 
capital investment and exports have all 
increased in the three months from 
December 2014. The weaker euro exchange 
rate continues to lift German exports and, 
with the oil price declining, energy costs 
have fallen sharply. This has provided a 
significant boost to the German SME 
sector, which is a key market from which 
Sirius attracts its tenant base, particularly 
for our higher end SmartSpace products.
The European Central Bank recently 
launched an outright quantitative easing 
programme to stave off deflation, keep 
interest rates low and weaken the euro. 
As a consequence long-term Eurozone 
government bond yields, a proxy for the 
cost of capital, have declined significantly. 
Small to medium-sized German businesses 
now have more access to cheaper capital 
and so are more inclined to invest in 
expanding their businesses; Sirius offering 
of good quality, good value flexible workspace 
is proving to be very attractive.
Outlook
The Company continues to trade in line 
with expectations, and with the SME market 
in Germany continuing to improve, we are 
confident that demand for conventional 
and flexible workspace will remain strong 
across our core sites.
The capex investment programme, 
targeting 50% of our vacant space, is 
now nearing 40% completion and we are 
already seeing excellent rental returns from 
the previously unlettable or under-rented 
areas that have now been transformed. 
This, together with the recently acquired 
earnings enhancing sites, should impact 
positively on rental income, earnings 
and dividends going forward.

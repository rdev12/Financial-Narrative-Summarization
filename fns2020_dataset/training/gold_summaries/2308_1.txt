Booker Group plc
annual report & accounts 2009
Booker continues to make good progress. 
Back in autumn 2005, Booker was in a 
poor place with net debt of £361m, sales 
dropping at a rate of 6% per annum, a 
slump in profits and supplier and customer 
confidence in the business was very low. 
In november 2005 the senior management 
team was changed and we outlined our 
plan to focus, drive, and broaden the 
business. that plan is working. customer 
satisfaction is improving due to our better 
choice, lower prices and enhanced service. 
at March 2009 net debt was £25m and, 
on prior year, sales were up 3.3% and 
operating profit was up 25%. While we are 
happy with the progress we have made, 
we still have a lot to do to fulfil our ambition 
of becoming the uK’s best and biggest 
supplier to small business.
FOCUS
(commenced November 2005) 
although most of our ‘focus’ activity was 
completed between november 2005 and 
March 2006, we continue to improve 
business efficiency and cash management. 
throughout the business we are seeking 
to ‘stop, simplify and standardise’ work so 
that we enhance customer service whilst 
improving efficiency.
DRIVE
(commenced April 2006)
We survey more than 40,000 customers each 
year to see how each branch and product 
category is performing. the key question is; 
“Would you recommend Booker to a friend?” In 
January 2007, 78.2% of customers surveyed 
said they would. In January 2008 the score 
was 79.3% and in January 2009 it improved 
again to 83.9%. this reflects our efforts to 
improve choice, price and service.
Choice Up
In January 2008 we introduced the ‘First for •	
pubs’ range. We now sell more than 3,000 
kegs of beer per week. In January 2009 
we launched pub Favourite Meal Deals for 
£2.50 to help independent pubs compete 
in these cost-conscious times.
In July 2007 we launched euro shopper, •	
a range which allows the independent 
retailer to benefit from the growth of 
discount retailing. euro shopper sales 
are now above £0.6m per week, up from 
£0.3m per week last year.
In 2008 we launched lichfields luxury •	
portion packs which are ideal for hotels, bed 
and breakfasts and pubs. t otal l ichfields 
sales are now £0.2m per week.
Prices Down
During the year we have seen product •	
cost inflation in several sectors including 
cooking oil, rice, pasta and bread – but 
we have kept our prices competitive in the 
face of this challenge. We are now seeing 
deflation in some product sectors. 
In 2008 we launched a catering price •	
check service on our website which 
enables the comparison of Booker prices 
to those of other foodservice suppliers. 
More than 10,000 price comparisons 
have been made using this service.
Better Service
In December 2007 we removed charges •	
for handling credit and debit cards and in 
March 2008 we launched free delivery.
all branch staff have been trained on what •	
we call “prIDe”. this works to improve 
the parking, reception, Internal, Delivery 
and exit experience for customers.

We now have more than 2,200 •	
customers trading as premier. at the 
2008 convenience t racking programme 
awards, premier won ‘best in class’ for 
availability, customer service and value 
for money. Building on this success, 
in 2009 we are re-launching premier 
with consumer driven ranging, improved 
information systems and a new format 
called ‘premier express’.
BROADEN
(commenced April 2007)
We continue to ‘broaden’ Booker. t o achieve 
this we are:
Improving the cash and carry •	
experience
in January 2006 we converted our ﬁrst 
‘extra’ branch. By May 2009, 71 of the 
173 branches had been converted to 
the ‘extra’ format. the key features are a 
lighter, brighter branch environment and 
improved layout, signage and ranges. 
our Derby branch is typical of the new 
format. caterers, retailers and small 
business customers much prefer the 
environment.
Internet •	
in June 2007 we launched the improved 
booker.co.uk site. customer satisfaction 
with the new site is excellent. sales on 
the site have increased from £44m 
per annum in the year to March 2007 
to £250m this year. in 2008 we were 
awarded ‘online retailer of the Year’ at 
the retail industry a wards.
Booker Direct •	
We have become the largest supplier of 
food and drink to the uK’s cinema industry. 
in addition to our existing relationship with 
vue cinemas, we have now secured 
national supply agreements with odeon 
uci, apollo, empire, reel and showcase. 
in partnership with DHl we have been 
awarded a contract to supply the HM 
prisons in england and Wales. We were 
awarded preferred food supplier status 
to s &n pub enterprises, c harles Wells 
pub company and frederic robinson

also won supply contracts with Harrison

Booker India •	
in april 2009 we announced the launch 
of Booker india. in the uK we supply 
over three thousand indian restaurants 
and thousands of other indian owned 
businesses. a number of these 
customers have said that Booker would 
do well in india and we have responded 
to the challenge. a team from Booker 
reviewed the market for 12 months and 
we have now decided to open one store 
in Mumbai later this year. We look forward 
to serving the kirana stores, food stalls 
and restaurants of Mumbai.
the plan to focus, drive and broaden Booker 
is facilitated by developing our staff and by 
improving the sustainability of the business:
People •	
the Group is an equal opportunities  –
employer.
6,500 Branch colleagues have been  –
trained in priDe (parking, reception, 
internal, Delivery, and exit). 
the role of the Branch supervisor  –
has been clearly deﬁned with 805

would like to thank all our colleagues for their 
efforts over the past 12 months.
Sustainability •	
We have been awarded the carbon  –
t rust standard by the carbon t rust

taken place to improve our ‘carbon 
footprint’ including reducing our

miles per annum and, in the year, 
converting more than 500,000 litres 
of customers’ used cooking oil into 
bio-diesel.
the Group fulﬁls its duty to minimise  –
adverse environmental impacts by

and energy, recycling wherever 
possible, minimising waste  
and ensuring compliance with 
relevant legislation.
in summary, customer satisfaction has 
improved, our sales have increased, operating 
proﬁts are up 25% and our net debt is down 
47%. our plan to focus, drive and broaden 
the business is working and we are satisﬁed 
with the progress we have made.

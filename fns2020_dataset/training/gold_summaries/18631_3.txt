 halladale group plc annual report and accounts 2002 5
I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress
in our first full year as an AIM listed company. This was
achieved against a background of a global economic slowdown
and extremely volatile stock markets, all exacerbated by the
terrible events of September 11th.
The UK economy slowed rapidly in the final quarter of 2001
but appears to have avoided recession. The most recent CEBR
forecast indicates GDP growth of 1.5% in 2002 and 2.1% in
2003. The direct property market again performed well and for
the second year running was the top performing asset class in
the UK with total returns of 6.7% in the calendar year 2001.
For the year to 30th April 2002 the Company’s profit before
tax rose from £849,000 to £1,151,000, an increase of 36%.
Earnings per share were 5.34p, a reduction from last year’s
restated figure of 7.66, but this reflected the substantially
higher number of ordinary shares in issue compared with the
average number last year. Net asset value per ordinary share,
based on the pro forma unaudited balance sheet, rose by 13% 
from 68.9p to 77.6p. These results are fully analysed in the
Financial Review.
Following the interim dividend of 0.5p per share paid on
14th February 2002, the directors are proposing a final dividend
of 0.75p per share for the year ended 30th April 2002. Subject 
to approval at the Annual General Meeting this will be paid 
on 27th September 2002 to shareholders on the register on
30th August 2002. The Board’s stated intention is to pursue 
a progressive dividend policy. In an era of low inflation
investors are likely to be increasingly attracted to companies
offering sustained income growth in addition to capital growth
and that is precisely what we aim to deliver.
As you will see from the Chief Executive’s Review and 
the Operational Review the last twelve months have seen an
extremely high level of transactional activity. As Chairman I am
conscious that this has put a tremendous workload on my
executive colleagues and indeed on all of our staff. As I would
have expected they have coped with this in exemplary fashion.
Delivering value to shareholders in the coming years remains
your Board’s fundamental objective and I know that everyone 
at Halladale understands this and will strive hard to achieve it.
Our Annual General Meeting takes place in Glasgow on 
10th September 2002. Although there is always a certain
amount of formal business to be conducted I do regard the
AGM as an important opportunity for communication between
shareholders and the Board. I look forward therefore to
welcoming as many of you as possible at this year’s meeting.

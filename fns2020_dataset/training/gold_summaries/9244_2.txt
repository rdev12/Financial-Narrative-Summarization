Explanatory Notes
(i)  The results for the year ended 31 December 2005 represent the Group’s ﬁ rst full year ﬁ nancial statements prepared under  
International Financial Reporting Standards. As a consequence, the 2004 results have been amended accordingly. 
(ii)  Laird uses underlying results as key performance indicators. Underlying proﬁ t before tax and underlying earnings per share are stated before 
exceptional items, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the gain or loss on 
disposal of businesses and the impact arising from the fair valuing of ﬁ nancial instruments.
(iii)  The narrative that follows is based principally on underlying operating proﬁ t, proﬁ t before tax and earnings per share, as the directors believe 
that these provide a more consistent measure of operating performance.
(iv) The average number of shares in issue was 157.9 million in 2005 and 145.6 million in 2004.

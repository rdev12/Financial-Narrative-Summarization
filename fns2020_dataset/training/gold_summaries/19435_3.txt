 The Board of Raven Russia announces the Group’s results for
the year ended 31 December 2012.
The Group is making very good progress. Lettings have
continued in an undersupplied market, finance facility
maturities have been extended and important earnings
enhancing acquisitions made. It has been a busy and fulfilling
year.
Net rental and related income (“NOI”) for the year increased by
49% from $91.7 million to $136.5 million. Underlying operating
profit increased by 63% from $68.9 million to $112.1 million
and underlying earnings before taxation increased significantly
from $8.1 million to $34.7 million.
Operating cashflow increased 47.9% from $81.6 million to
$120.7 million.
Significant acquisitions added two fully let properties in
Moscow to the portfolio, with 259,000 square metres (“sqm”)
of space, increasing NOI in the period by $15.1 million. They
add $31.9 million to our annualised NOI. The acquisitions were
partly financed by an issue of 48.4 million preference shares at
134 pence. Even before taking account of acquisitions,
progress has been excellent.
After a revaluation surplus of $69.3 million (2011: $153 million),
IFRS operating profit was $148.8 million (2011: $200.3 million).
Underlying basic earnings per share increased from 0.18 cents
to 5.30 cents. Adjusted, fully diluted net asset value per share
increased from 119 cents to 125 cents.
Annualised NOI is $170.1 million today. With pre let
agreements (“PLAs”) and letters of intent (“LOIs”), including
those on additional phases of construction at our Noginsk and
Klimovsk projects, this increases to $179.7 million. Fully let,
annualised NOI will be $190.4 million.
We have maintained our balance sheet strength at the year
end. Following the acquisitions in the year, gearing has
increased to 44.1% (2011: 38.1%) as calculated in note 35 to
the financial statements. Our year end cash balance stood at
$191.7 million (2011: $181.8 million).
Our final distribution of 2.25 pence per share is a 29%
increase over the final distribution of 1.75 pence declared last
year and means a 25% increase in total distribution for the
year from 3 pence to 3.75 pence per share. This represents a
yield of 5.7% on the current share price.
As our shares continue to trade at a significant discount to
NAV we will be distributing in the form of a tender offer
buy-back of 1 in 33 ordinary shares at 75 pence. The tender
offer will be subject to the approval of shareholders and a
circular setting out full details will be posted shortly. It is
expected that the tender offer will be completed in May 2013.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders,
employees and advisers for their support during a very busy year.

Taking decisive action to improve performance
Michael Sharp has been 
Chief Executive of 
Debenhams since 2011. 
Here he discusses the 
issues that impacted our 
performance in 2014 and 
the decisive action being 
taken to address them.
truly multi-channel Christmas. Convenience 
had a much greater influence on customer 
behaviour and the winners were retailers 
who could offer services such as next day 
click and collect. We were not able to do 
this and, whilst our online sales continued 
to grow, in reality we fell further behind 
some of our competitors.
Q : W h a t a r e y o u d o i n g t o a d d r e s s 
t h ese i s su es ?
We have taken decisive action to address 
these issues. In April we set out five clear 
priorities under the pillars of our strategy to 
build a leading international, multi-channel 
brand. These priorities are underpinned by 
the setting of more prudent sales targets 
and buying a lower level of stock which 
will make us more resilient going forward. 
The first of these priorities, in terms of 
delivering a compelling customer 
proposition, is to refocus our approach to 
promotions. Second, for multi-channel, we 
are continuing to build a more competitive 
and economic business. Third, the priority 
for UK retail is to drive a better return from 
our stores. Next, in the international 
business, our aim is to accelerate growth 
across all channels. Finally, we are investing 
in operational effectiveness which I think 
of as the “glue” which connects the four 
pillars together.

Promotions are part of Debenhams’ DNA. 
Customers like them and recognise the 
great value they offer. But in the run-up to 
Christmas the increased intensity of our 
activity started to cause some confusion. 
Our emphasis is now on the important

2014 was a challenging year for 
Debenhams. I was extremely frustrated 
and disappointed by our performance in 
the first half of the year and its impact on 
the results for the year as a whole. But it is a 
mistake to think that the year was without 
positives, not least that we saw a much 
more encouraging performance in the 
second half. Our brand remains in good 
shape and customers continue to like our 
product ranges. The Oxford Street 
transformation project was completed on 
plan and the flagship store is meeting our 
expectations. We opened four new stores 
in the UK and a net six new international 
franchise stores. Our online sales continued 
to grow. We refinanced our borrowing 
facilities, taking advantage of highly 
attractive credit markets to secure 
longer-term and more diversified funding.
Q : W h a t w e n t w r o n g i n t h e f i r s t 
h alf o f t h e y e ar ?
Our performance in the first half was 
impacted by lower than expected sales in 
our UK clothing business before Christmas. 
This meant we had to clear significantly 
more stock during the post-Christmas sale, 
resulting in a 100 basis point (bps) decline 
in gross margin for the first half. I believe 
that three factors contributed to this 
disappointing performance. First, in 
hindsight we set our sales expectation 
too high and as a result bought too 
much stock. Weak market conditions in 
September and October exacerbated 
the problem. Second, the clothing market 
was extremely promotional in the run-up 
to Christmas, meaning that our own 
long-established promotional events were 
less successful than they had been in the 
past. Finally, Christmas 2013 was the first

promotional events such as spectaculars, 
sales and blue cross. We are removing from 
the calendar some of the smaller events 
which create promotional “noise” with only 
limited reward. Overall, we are reducing 
the number of days we are on promotion 
and the depth and breadth of product 
participation within promotions. This is a 
journey, predicated on the more prudent 
sales targets mentioned above, which will 
not be achieved in one season. We are 
making these changes at a pace which 
makes sense to our customers so they do 
not become disengaged. At the same time 
we are improving clarity around value on 
a more general basis, for example by 
tightening price points in categories such 
as childrenswear. We are measuring our 
success in a number of ways. Clearly gross 
margin is the key metric and it grew by 
10 bps in the second half compared with 
a decline of 100 bps in the first half. We also 
saw a 10.6% increase in own brand full price 
sell-through in the second half compared 
with the previous year and an improvement 
in the markdown to sales ratio of 3.9%.

We are confident in our online product 
offer, but we have not been as competitive 
as our best-in-class peers in the range of 
delivery options available to multi-channel 
customers. Many of these issues have now 
been addressed. The cut-off for next day 
delivery to home has been extended from 
2pm to 10pm. Customers can now elect 
for evening delivery or delivery on a 
nominated day including Saturday and 
Sunday. Next day click and collect is also 
available. We expect these new services to

We have a lot to do and

drive sales and to improve profitability. 
They will drive sales by appealing to 
customers for whom convenience is the 
most important reason why they choose 
to shop with a retailer. They will drive 
profitability by enabling us to recover a 
higher proportion of delivery costs.
We are aiming to improve online 
profitability further by reducing our 
fulfilment costs which we know are higher 
than our competitors’. We have made 
progress in the last two years, reducing UK 
online costs as a percentage of sales by 
some 500 bps. There is more to come over 
the medium term, particularly through the 
automation of our distribution centres, 
as detailed on the next page.
Q : H o w a r e y o u i m p r o v i n g t h e

Our UK stores will continue to be our 
largest single sales channel for the 
foreseeable future. However, the role of 
the store is changing in the multi-channel 
world. Store footfall has been impacted by 
the ongoing channel shift from store-based 
shopping to online. The ongoing 
modernisation programme and the work 
to improve store standards are providing 
a better shopping experience than five 
years ago. However, sales densities have 
declined due to the channel shift and the 
closure of a number of concession brands, 
particularly in larger stores. This has 
contributed to a fall in UK store like-for-like 
sales which we are seeking to address. 
I said last year that we were conducting 
an estate-wide space review to ensure all 
space is being used in the most profitable 
way. This has been completed and we have 
now moved into a phase of trials which aim 
to increase sales densities by offering a 
wider choice of product categories, brands 
and services. Trials have commenced with 
brands including Sports Direct, Monsoon, 
Mothercare and Costa. Early results have 
been encouraging. Decisions on future 
roll-out will be made after peak trading.

With an estimated size of more than 
£300 billion, the global department store 
market provides an opportunity for our 
International segment to become a 
substantial part of Debenhams over the 
next five years, accounting for some 30% 
of sales. In the past year international 
has become much more front of mind 
in our organisation. There is much closer 
integration between our international 
and buying/merchandising teams and 
we have improved the management of 
the international supply chain. Looking 
forward, we expect growth will come in 
the main from our franchise stores, where 
we are aiming to double the number of 
stores and countries. We are contracted 
to open 14 new stores over the next three 
years with another 12 in final negotiation. 
International online is growing quickly 
with sales up by 41.6% in 2014. It accounted 
for 4.3% of total international sales and 
we are aiming to increase this to c.15% 
in five years. In addition to our existing 
international models, we are looking at 
alternative routes to market for our own 
brands which will help us expand our reach 
into more markets and continue to grow the 
profitability of our international business.

W h a t a r e t he pr ior i t i e s f or t he 
m ediu m t er m ?
As Debenhams changes from a UK 
department store model to an international, 
multi-channel model, we are evolving the 
systems, supply chain and processes that 
support the business. We have a clear 
roadmap to achieve this which focuses 
on four areas of operational effectiveness. 
We are developing our buying and 
merchandising capabilities to facilitate 
a joined up approach to buying, range 
planning and merchandising across 
geographies and channels. The supply 
chain is being restructured to provide more 
flexible and scalable supply and logistics. 
The quality of our decision making is 
improving through enhanced data 
analytics and reporting capability for all 
channels. Finally, we are upgrading our 
systems infrastructure to provide the 
platform and tools to sustain us as we grow. 
One project which is worth dwelling on 
for a moment is the automation of our 
Peterborough and Sherburn distribution 
centres. This will not only give us the 
capacity for future growth but will enable 
us to achieve a significant reduction in 
the cost per unit of picking and packing, 
thereby contributing to a meaningful 
increase in the profitability of online sales. 
Q : W h a t i s y o u r a p p r o a c h t o s t o r e 
e x p a n s i o n i n t h e U K ?
Our store estate will continue to be our 
largest channel and plays a vital part in 
driving our multi-channel business. The 
vast majority of customers touch a store 
in some way. When we open a store in a 
new location we see an increase in online 
sales in the catchment area.
However, I believe it is useful to clarify our 
position on new UK stores. We have 160 
stores today. The contracted pipeline is 
comprised of 12 stores. Borehamwood and 
Scunthorpe will open during October 2014 
and ten stores are scheduled to open in 
the following three years. There are 
another ten priority markets where we 
would like to open a store if we can obtain 
the right space on the right deal. They 
include the shopping malls at Bluewater 
and Westfield Stratford City. Beyond this, 
we are not looking to open any more stores 
in the UK. 
Q : Y o u h a v e a l o t t o d o . D o y o u 
h a v e t h e t e am an d t h e re so u r c e s 
t o del i v er ?
We do have a lot to do and I do not 
underestimate the challenge ahead. 
I am confident that we can deliver. I am 
fortunate in having what I believe is one 
of the most talented retail management 
teams in the UK. We strengthened the 
Executive Committee during 2014 with 
the appointments of Peter Swann as 
Operations Director, adding responsibility 
for supply chain and logistics to his 
existing systems brief, and Ross Clemmow 
as E-Commerce Director. These 
appointments recognise the importance 
of these disciplines to our future success. 
I would also like to make special mention 
of Neil Kennedy who has fulfilled the role 
of Acting Chief Financial Officer admirably 
ahead of Matt Smith’s arrival. 
We also have the financial wherewithal 
to deliver. Debenhams remains a cash 
generative business with clear priorities 
for the uses of cash. The first priority is 
to invest in the four pillars of our strategy. 
Capital expenditure amounted to £128 
million in 2014 and is expected to be in the 
region of £130 million in 2015. We remain 
focused on return on capital employed.
Q : W h a t i s y o u r o u t l o o k f o r 2 0 1 5 ?
We expect the market to remain highly 
competitive because customers tell us 
that although they are encouraged by 
economic improvements, this has yet to 
translate into higher disposable income. 
We therefore remain cautious about the 
strength and timing of a UK consumer 
recovery and are planning prudently. 
Whilst this has been a challenging year for 
Debenhams, the brand is strong and our 
improved second half performance 
demonstrates that we have taken decisive 
action to address the issues we faced in the 
first half. The progress we have achieved so 
far gives me confidence that we are ready 
and prepared for the key Christmas period 
and that we have a clear strategy to deliver 
long-term sustainable growth and 
shareholder value. 
Our 2014 strategic report, from page 
10 to page 31, has been reviewed and 
approved by the board of directors on 
23 October 2014.

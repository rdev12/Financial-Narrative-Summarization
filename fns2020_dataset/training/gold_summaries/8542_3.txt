Group performance
ITE has continued to expand its 
business this year through a mixture 
of organic and acquisition led growth. 
The Group has now firmly established 
itself in the Asian exhibition markets 
through its investments in ABEC in 
India, Tradelink and ECMI in Malaysia 
and since the end of the financial year 
in Sinostar in China. Good organic 
growth across our core portfolios in 
Russia and the CIS together with a 
strong biennial performance from 
the Moscow International Oil and Gas 
Exhibition have combined with the 
newly acquired businesses in Asia to 
deliver record financial and operating 
results. In this, the stronger year of its 
biennial pattern, ITE’s revenues were 
£192.3 million (2012: £172.3 million) and 
have yielded headline profits before tax 
of £59.4 million (2012: £53.0 million) 
and headline diluted earnings per 
share of 19.3p (2012: 16.9p). Reported 
pre‑tax profit was £43.9 million 
(2012: £40.5 million) and fully diluted 
earnings per share was 14.0p (2012: 
12.8p). The Group finished the year 
with net cash of £23.5 million (2012: 
£13.0 million), after investing £26.1 
million on acquisitions during the year. 
board and management
Michael Hartley has served ITE as a 
Non‑executive Director since October 
2003. He has been Chairman of 
both the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees during his tenure and 
has made a significant contribution 
to ITE’s Board over the last ten years. 
In line with corporate governance 
best practice Mike is standing down 
at the next AGM of the Company. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to express our appreciation for his 
focus and dedication to the Group. 
Stephen Puckett joined ITE’s Board as 
a Non‑executive Director on 1 July 2013 
and will succeed Mike as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. Stephen 
brings a wealth of relevant experience 
in emerging markets gained in his 
previous role as Chief Financial Officer 
of Michael Page International PLC. The 
Board has taken positive steps this 
year to strengthen itself and the way 
in which the Non‑executives interface 
with the Executives. Following an 
external review of Board effectiveness, 
we are adopting a number of initiatives 
in line with the recommendations 
of the review. Notably we intend to 
appoint an additional Non‑executive 
Director and establish a separate 
sub‑committee of the Board to review 
risk and the Group’s mitigation of risk. 
ITE continues to prosper because 
of the efforts and loyalty of its staff 
worldwide. The Group now has 
30 operating offices in 17 different 
countries with a broad range of 
cultural backgrounds, all co‑operating 
with each other and participating 
in helping to grow ITE. Almost 50% 
of our staff have been employees 
of ITE for more than five years, and 
60% are participants in one of our 
equity schemes. I am proud to be 
Chairman of a Group with such a 
dedicated employee base, and I, 
on behalf of the Board, would like 
to thank and acknowledge the 
contribution of ITE’s management 
and employees to this year’s result. 
ITE’s Board recognises that good 
corporate governance is in the 
long‑term interests of the Group 
and we are conscious of our 
responsibilities for setting values 
which underpin the Group culture. As 
Chairman, I am mindful of my personal 
responsibility for leading the Board 
and ensuring it operates effectively. 
Dividend
ITE’s growth has supported a 
consistent increase in annual dividends. 
This year the interim dividend was 
increased from 2.1p to 2.3p and 
the proposed final dividend is 4.7p, 
making a full dividend for the year of 
7.0p (2012: 6.5p). This is an increase 
in dividend of circa 8%, in line with 
the underlying earnings growth in 
headline profits over the biennial 
cycle. The final dividend is proposed 
for payment on 10 February 2014.
Outlook
This year, the Group has again 
enjoyed good trading conditions in 
its major markets, producing a strong 
financial performance. Although 
large events have traded well, much 
of this year’s growth has come from 
our portfolio of medium sized events, 
often run from the smaller regional 
offices. This growth in smaller events 
looks set to continue into 2014, and 
forecasts are for economic growth 
in Russia to be maintained at current 
levels. Currency fluctuations were 
not a significant factor in this year’s 
results, but the Group’s results remain 
sensitive to sterling strength against 
the currencies of ITE’s markets. At 
30 November revenues booked 
for 2014 were £106 million, in line 
with the Board’s expectations and 
representing circa 55% of market 
expectations for 2014 revenues. 
On a like‑for‑like basis revenues 
are circa 7% ahead of last year.
The recent announcement of the 
Sinostar joint venture means ITE enters 
the new financial year with good 
business prospects in three of the 
major emerging market economies: 
Russia, India and China. Growth 
prospects remain positive in Russia 
and most of the CIS markets, and the 
Group’s portfolio of core events should 
continue to perform well. With a strong 
balance sheet and operating cashflows, 
the Group remains in an excellent 
position to expand its business 
through organic development and 
acquisitions. The Board is focused on 
the execution of ITE’s strategy, and has 
confidence in ITE’s future prospects.

 Chief Executive Officer’s review
Significantly less emotional
behaviour this year
For us this was a boring year.
As shown below our index hardly moved!
Whereas in 2008/9, moves of the order of
magnitude of over 20% in MXEF were
common (there were at least six), in
2009/10 there was one!
Our business was very stable as well.
Clients seem to be happy and the asset
class seems to be well supported at around
current levels. Looking out a few years, at
least at present, the Emerging asset class
seems likely to be one of the few listed
asset classes of choice potentially for many
years to come.
On the right I’ve shown a graph of CDS
Spreads which compares the Developed
with the Emerging countries. This has to
be one of the most remarkable turnarounds
in terms of reversal of roles within our
industry over the past twenty years. The
interesting thing is that where the CDS
relationship went over the past year, P/E’s
could easily follow next. Imagine that –
paying a higher P/E for exposure to a
basket of Emerging countries (say Brazil,
China, Korea and Taiwan) than for a
Developed basket (say US, UK, Germany
and France). We are not only fortunate to
be exposed to this asset class at this point
in its development but it is worth pointing
out that the Developed world is now
suffering from many of the same problems
that the Emerging countries had to deal
with a few years ago. Many of our
shareholders will recall the advice given out
at that time by the US: confront the
problem, reduce deficits, eliminate excess
capacity and pay down or renegotiate
leverage. Now that the boot is on the other
foot it seems likely that, as a result of this
advice being too painful to heed, the
adjustment process will be extended.
Diversification
We have continued to develop our
diversification plans over the past year.
The Business Diversification Product
Map opposite shows the extent of this
diversification.
Current areas of focus include Natural
Resources and the Developed CEF
Products. Both have performed well from

an investment perspective and there seems
to be significant appetite for our
Developed CEF expertise which effectively
does what we presently undertake within
the Emerging space. Since winning our
first mandate in September 2009 this
account has outperformed its benchmark
by around 300bps. Obviously shareholders
are not interested in the investment
performance of a specific fund but this
performance has afforded us the
opportunity to significantly short-circuit
the normal time required to create a
relevant record. We will start marketing
this product in November and I’ll provide
more information regarding progress in
the Interim Statement. In addition, in the
above Product Map you can see the
breakdown of the different businesses that
we are attempting to develop. In all cases
these are part of our diversification plans.
Apart from the Developed CEF Fund and
Natural Resources we are expecting these
products to take around two to three years
to build adequate track records. Each of
these areas of business is being developed
on a stand-alone basis with separate
staffing and the creation of a team
environment from their beginning.
North Bridge Capital
As referenced in earlier CEO’s statements,
and apart from one consultant where there
was a one year extension, as of 13th
October 2009 the agreement that we had
with North Bridge Capital with regard to
marketing came to an end. As of 13th
October 2010 we will be responsible for all
of our US Marketing, having internalised
this process. T odd Fawaz, who is in charge
of our US Marketing effort, having now
been with the firm for two years, has
effectively started again regarding our
attempts at diversification. One of the
issues that we have had to confront is that
while we consider that there is a significant
need to diversify our business for reasons
I’ll go into later, North Bridge in retrospect
seem to have been keener to focus on our
old business, that of Emerging Markets
CEF’s. This effectively has meant that
while we had assumed that the relevant
profile building was proceeding, it would
now appear that it was not. The bottom
line is that in our experience third party
marketing works very well when small and
having a single product to sell. It does not
work, or at least is unlikely to work, when
there is an established wish to grow and
market a number of products. Obviously
from our perspective it is not until a
contract of this type comes to an end that
it is possible to take a new direction.
Regarding our need to diversify our
business, in my opinion there are three
main reasons for this:
1) Staff. In my opinion employees thrive
in a growing business. In fact I would
suggest that it’s difficult to keep good
employees if you do not intend to grow a
business. Staff have needs, they are
ambitious and they have a need for
security. If they consider that they are in a
dead end job they will move on to another
business where there are plans for growth.
2) Clients. For similar reasons clients
should expect continuity of staffing.
Changing staff leads to risk. For example
the Investment Process would potentially
alter in the event that investment staff
were to change. In my opinion, while it
used to be argued that diversification was a
risk, I would suggest that recent experience
amongst our peer group would imply that
zero plans for growth leads to staff
departures which leads to insecurity in
terms of investment performance.
3) Competitive Pressure. In my opinion
there is going to be ongoing pressure on
margins, salaries and the costs associated
with the general infrastructure of doing
business. Not surprisingly the regulatory
responsibilities of doing business are
increasing too. In my opinion there is a
need to ensure that these costs are spread
over increased assets, otherwise there is
the potential appearance of reduced
profitability.
Thus while I would not accept that we are
on a treadmill, there is a very real need to
grow our business via diversification and at
the core of delivering in that regard is our
decision to internalise marketing.

10 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010
I have produced below the projected run
off payments to North Bridge Capital
over the next ten years, this being the
extent of their participation. These figures
are based upon two key assumptions: first
that the clients remain and second a
constant index level. Obviously there are
additional variables as well including
investment performance and currency
rates, but in terms of the big picture as
these ten year trails run out so we start to
receive those fees that otherwise would be
paid to North Bridge Capital. In all cases
this relates to an increase of 20% in our
fees received.
Migration to main market listing
There are many additional responsibilities
that we assume as a result of moving from
AIM to the main market. These not only
include a number of existing differences
that are well established, but in addition
from 1st June 2011 we will have to meet
the requirements of the new Corporate
Governance Code.
Rather than attempt to achieve all of the
relevant changes this year (within this
Annual Report and Accounts) we will
complete most of the other requirements
next year, leaving a few of our
responsibilities for the year after. The main
difference in this set of accounts is the new
Corporate Governance Report, which
I’m sure will be expanded over time.
Within this context, I would like to draw
particular attention to our Remuneration
Policy, as it is very different in many
respects from recently released guidelines,
and I think it is important for
shareholders to understand why we
believe that our way is better, at any
rate for us. What follows is some
background plus some core values:
From my experience of the City, when I
consider remuneration and remuneration
packages, I’m taken in the direction of
instability, greed and selfishness. I’m also
taken away from the creation and the
maintenance of a brand.
Picking up on these three points:
Instability, because the existing system seems
to be broken. T urnover of staff around the
City implies that employees do not get
job satisfaction and / or that existing
remuneration packages do not create loyalty.
Greed. The City is made up of many
selfish people who are encouraged by
management, and management’s approach
to remuneration, to develop egotistical
tendencies. This culture of greed, in my
opinion, manifests itself often via a lack of
risk awareness, poor team spirit and
significant key man risk.
Selfishness creates an attitude of negotiation
at the point of salary, bonus and option
notification. At City of London we do not
negotiate any aspect of remuneration.
Selfishness can also be observed when
analysing the extent to which colleagues
train the rest of their team. Again our
senior employees are encouraged to take
responsibility for the training of their team.

If we are genuine in wishing to create a
team culture then there is a need to treat
employees as a team. This in effect means
that we do no t pit them one against
another. Rather we attempt to instil in
them that the competition is outside the
firm, which actually is where it is.
The net result of this is that there is little
intrigue at the point of salary and general
compensation disclosures. Staff accept that
the way it is, is the way it is. If they do not
like it they can leave which sometimes
happens within a year of joining.
I would make the point that directors’
remuneration is disclosed via the Report
and Accounts.
In essence, we are not looking for freedom
fighters. Rather we would say it is better
to appoint decent people, who can
genuinely work in a team environment,
than appoint just no1’s.
We often say, better to appoint a good
no2 who is a decent person than a no1
who is greedy, political and does not
consider the maintenance and
development of the brand.
The net result of the above is that the
Group salary, bonus, and option pool to a
great extent reflects seniority and loyalty.
From time to time, usually quarterly, we
review these three but sometimes two
components. Our recommendations are
forwarded to the Remuneration
Committee which requests substantiation
for recommendations that involve salary
levels in excess of £100,000.
Most quarters we will make a change or
two to reflect changes to our perception
of seniority and loyalty, but I would
emphasise that these are gradualist
alterations and are relatively rare.
In conclusion, and as referenced earlier,
I would suggest that remuneration
packages and the system via which they
are arrived at in the City is broken.
Our system however is not broken.
Our approach has been developed by
management using many years of
experience in the UK and the US.
Like our Risk Controls, our Bonus
Formula and our Dividend and Bonus
relationship, I hope that elements of
what we undertake might one day be
considered best practice.
Recent recommendations regarding best
practice as it relates to Remuneration
include deferred bonus. Is this really the
way to go? Why not pay someone on
time for their work. Or, is this meant to
delay their departure, a sort of enforced
loyalty? Or is it that there is insecurity
regarding the profits that the individual
has created? If this is so then surely the
focus should be on the quantum,
measurement and the quality of the
corporation’s earnings. Either way I
would suggest that deferral of
remuneration is irrelevant in our case.
We are running a cash business where
clients pay us for work undertaken
calculated on a monthly basis.
The other structural weakness that I
would suggest needs to be confronted in
the City is the cult of the individual.
This seems to me to embody the very
volatility of earnings and the extreme risk
taking that was displayed by parts of our
industry over the past few years.
Unfortunately the passage of time does
not seem to have altered what seems to
have become considered best practice.
Staffing and outlook
Over the past year we have taken on
around a dozen additional staff. Staff have
been added primarily in the areas of
Compliance, Fund Management, Fund
Accounting and Performance and
Attribution. In most cases this has been
to accommodate further growth.
As a small boutique with a number of
conservative Core Values, as we grow it
would be very easy to not only
compromise but in some cases forget those
Values. We remain committed to our
brand. We are a small specialist fund
manager positioned at the Performance
end of our industry. We are not seeking
to grow fast, we do not want hot money
and we are as a result not only committed
to but are able to maintain our margins.
T o preserve a culture you have to recruit
and keep the right people, and that
applies at every level because if you get
recruitment right at the junior level you
build for the future. We remain
committed to our team approach and
more specifically, not employing greedy,
selfish people. The employees at City of
London have remained very loyal over a
significant period of time and at the end
of another testing year have much to be
proud of. On behalf of the shareholders
I would like to say that we would like
more of the same over the next few years.
Suffice it to say, the new financial year
has started very well and I would hope
that we will have further progress to
report in a few months time.
The past six months, running up to the
most recent month end of 31st August,
have been the most profitable period that
we have experienced. Operating profit,
measured before profit-share, share option
charges and tax, has averaged close to
£1.4 million per month.
I would like to reiterate my intentions
regarding any sale of shares which remain
unchanged, that is to say that I would
intend, subject to close periods and other
regulatory requirements to sell 375,000
shares at 310p, 500,000 at 350p and
500,000 at 400p. Should these intentions
alter, perhaps as a result of a material
change in market conditions, I will
inform the Board and an appropriate
announcement will be released.

Emerging markets
The first application of our expertise
Emerging Markets as a description of young high growth
economies first appeared in 1981 when only six such markets
(Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand) could be accessed by foreign investors. Today there
are almost 60, including the ‘frontier’ markets that are at
earlier stages of development, with the largest being the so-
called BRIC’s economies – those of Brazil, Russia, India and
China. City of London realised early on that institutional
investors were struggling to access these markets in a
professionally managed, risk-diversified way and that a
product focused on the closed-end funds run by specialist
managers could hold great appeal.
1980s
Investing in emerging markets
becomes an equity play rather than
debt as stock markets open up and
companies in developing economies,
particularly in Asia, begin to raise
equity capital on their local markets.
International investors, attracted by
high growth and increasing liquidity
build positions. Because successful
emerging market investment
requires specialist skills and
knowledge, collective investment
vehicles, including closed-end
funds start to become popular with
all classes of investor. 
1991
In response to growing demand
from institutional investors for
exposure to high growth emerging
markets and the number of closed-
end funds now available, City of
London Group launches the
Emerging Markets T rust, a UK unit
trust with a global remit. This was
one of the first products to access
emerging markets via closed-end
funds, the historic core expertise of
City of London.
1992 – 1996
Investment in emerging markets
booms as more and more countries
reduce controls on foreign direct
investment and growth in
manufacturing output together with
a surge in natural resource prices
significantly increases GDP for the
emerging markets. The high growth
forecast for many countries
encouraged them to borrow heavily
on international markets. During
this period, City of London launches
additional products and successfully
exports its conservative approach to
US institutional investors. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010 13
1997 – 1998
Asian currency devaluations, led by
Thailand, and severe financial and
structural issues in Russia leading to
default, prompt a collapse in
emerging market stock prices as
international investors attempt to
withdraw and liquidity shrinks. The
downturn, following the boom of
the early and mid 1990s, leads
many investors to question again
the potential volatility of emerging
markets and creates an opportunity
for specialist, risk-averse managers
such as City of London to gain
additional mandates.
2000 – 2007
Lessons were learned by both
companies and governments in
emerging markets. In a period of
cheap money, many reduce
borrowing – with some building
large financial surpluses – and the
boom in commodity prices
particularly benefits the exporters.
Stock prices increase substantially
in the period as emerging
economies’ growth rates
outperform those of developed
economies and investors seek to
add to their holdings.
Emerging markets become a core
asset class in the portfolios of
almost all institutional investors.
2008 to date
The worldwide financial crash saw
emerging markets initially falling
further and faster than many
developed markets as liquidity
shrank and panicked international
investors sought an exit. But the
economic fundamentals of
emerging countries and companies
soon reasserted themselves and
performance to date from the lows
post crash is significantly better
than developed markets. Higher
growth rates are forecast to
continue and transparency and
liquidity to improve further.
Emerging market investment has
become mainstream.

 02  Cohort plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Chairman’s Statement
Cohort	has	experienced	a	difficult	
year ,	with	accounting	problems	and	
a	significant	deterioration	in	trading	
performance	at	SCS.	SEA 	also	performed	
below	expectations.	On	the	positive	side	
MASS	performed	strongly	and	the	Group	
has	closed	the	year	with	a	record	order	
book,	which	provides	a	basis	for	a	
recovery	in	profitability .

Cohort	posted	revenue	of	£78.1m

S C S 	 s u f f e r e d 	 a 	 d e c l i n e 	 i n 	 s a l e s 	 f r o m 	 2 0 0 9	
as	a	result	of	more	difficult	market	
conditions	and	withdrawal	from	
unprofitable	areas	of	activity .
The	Group’ s	adjusted	operating	profit	
was	£4.1m	(2009:	£6.3m).	 This	included	
a d j u s t e d 	 o p e r a t i n g 	 p r o fi t 	 f r o m 	 S C S 	 o f

were	£1.1m	(2009:	£1.2m).	
The	Group	operating	profit	of	£2.9m	
(2009:	£5.0m)	was	after	charging	£0.7m	
in	respect	of	relocation	and	restructuring.
P rofit	before	tax	was	£2.7m	(2009:	£4.6m)	
and 	 profit 	 after 	 tax 	 was 	 £2.3m 	 (2009: 	 £3.8m).

(2009: 9.28 pence). Adjusted earnings per 
s h a r e 	 w e r e 	 8 . 1 0 	 p e n c e 	 ( 2 0 0 9 : 	 1 2 . 8 3 	 p e n c e ) .	
The	adjusted	earnings	per	share	were	
based	upon	profit	after	tax,	excluding	
amortisation	of	other	intangible	assets,	
exceptional	items	and	share	of	result	
of	joint	ventures.
The	net	funds	at	year-end	were	£3.0m

Dividends
The	Board	is	recommending	a	final	
dividend	of	1.4	pence	per	ordinary	share	
(2009:	1.2	pence),	making	the	full	year	
dividend	in	respect	of	the	year	ended	
30	 April	2010	of	2.05	pence	per	ordinary

This	will	be	payable	on	8	September	2010	
to shareholders on the register at 
6	 August 	2010	subject	to	approval	at	the	
Annual	General	Meeting	on	2	September	
2010.	 The	Board	continues	to	maintain	
a progressive dividend policy.
SCS
SCS	had	a	very	difficult	year ,	uncovering	
significant	accounting	errors	which	had	
disguised	a	deterioration	in	profitability	
caused	by	a	combination	of	overhead	
cost	increases,	under-utilisation	of	core	
consulting	staff,	pricing	pressure	and	
the	assumption	of	new	business	at	
inadequate margins. 
Stanley	Carter	led	a	major	restructuring	
of	SCS	in	the	final	quarter	of	the	financial	
y e a r 	 w h i c h 	 h a s 	 r e d u c e d 	 t h e 	 c o s t 	 b a s e	
significantly ,	reducing	the	annual	payroll

cost	by	£2.0m.	W e	expect	a	much	
improved	performance	from	SCS	in	
the current year.
SCS	has	moved	into	a	new	office	in	
Theale	which	provides	a	better	working	
environment	for	the	business	and	will	
facilitate	improved	working	practices.	
From	1	June	2010,	 Andy	 Thomis	took	over	
from	Stanley	as	acting	Managing	Director	
of	SCS.	 As	announced	28	June	2010,	
Bill	Bird	will	be	joining	SCS	as	full	time	
Managing	Director	from	6	September	
2010.	Bill	has	considerable	experience	
in	the	defence	and	consultancy	sectors.
SEA
SEA 	underperformed	against	its	financial	
targets	in	the	year ,	primarily	as	a	result	
of	cost	increases	on	a	 small	number	of	
fixed	price	contracts	and	slower	order	
intake	in	some	areas.	 A 	re-organisation	
has	been	effected	which	has	resulted	
in	closure	of	the	loss	making	Offshore	
division	and	a	restructuring	of	the	three	
defence	divisions	into	two.	 At	the	same	
time	management	systems	have	been	
m o d i fi e d 	 t o 	 e n s u r e 	 t i g h t e r 	 p r o j e c t 	 c o n t r o l .	
SEA 	has	had	a	record	year	for	order	intake	
of	£39.2m,	has	made	particularly	good	
progress	in	its	Space	division,	and	overall	
has	 a	 strong	 customer	 offering.	 W e	 expect	
its	financial	performance	to	improve	in	
the current year.
MASS
MASS	traded	strongly	in	the	year	and	
posted	record	figures	for	sales,	 profits,	
cash	generation	and	order	intake.	
The	company	will	move	into	its	new	
premises	in	the	near	future	and	is	well	
placed	to	build	further	on	its	good	
position.	Shortly	after	the	end	of	the	
financial	year	MASS	completed	the	
acquisition	of	 Abacus	EW ,	an	Electronic	
W arfare	training	company	based	near	
MASS	at	Lincoln.	 Abacus	EW	Consultancy	
Limited	(Abacus	EW)	brings	additional	
capability	and	export	customers	to	the	
MASS	presence	in	the	Electronic	W arfare	
support	market.
Board and personnel
There	were	no	changes	to	the	
Cohort	Board	in	the	course	of	the	year .	
The	Executive	team	responded	well	to	a	
d i f fi c u l t 	 s e r i e s 	 o f 	 p r o b l e m s . 	 S t a n l e y 	 C a r t e r	
stepped	in	as	Managing	Director	of	SCS	
in	December	and	the	Board	is	grateful	
to	him	for	his	work	in	overseeing	the	
necessary	restructuring.	On	behalf	of	
the	Board	I	would	like	to	thank	all	our	
employees	for	their	hard	work	and	
dedication during a none too easy 
period	for	Cohort.
Outlook
F o l l o w i n g 	 a 	 v e r y 	 g o o d 	 y e a r 	 f o r 	 o r d e r 	 i n t a k e	
w i t h 	 t o t a l 	 o r d e r s 	 o f 	 £ 1 4 3 . 6 m 	 ( 2 0 0 9 : 	 £ 6 5 . 7 m )	
the	Group	order	book	at	1	May	2010	stood	
at	£112.7m	(2009:	£47.2m).	 This	provides	
a	good	platform	for	the	future.
The	difficulties	encountered	at	SCS,	
and	to	a	lesser	extent	at	SEA,	are	a	
m a t t e r 	 o f 	 r e g r e t 	 t o 	 t h e 	 B o a r d . 	 A l l	
shareholders,	Board,	staff	and	external	
s t a k e h o l d e r s 	 h a v e 	 b e e n 	 a f f e c t e d .	
The 	 absolute 	 priority 	 is 	 to 	 return 	 the	
Group	to	a	satisfactory	level	of	operating	
performance,	which	will	in	turn	open	up	
wider	strategic	options	for	the	business.	
“ The Executive team 
responded well to a 
difficult series of problems.”
Cohort	obtains	approximately	70%	of	
its	business	from	the	UK	defence	market,	
directly	or	indirectly ,	and	there	are	
obvious	uncertainties	for	the	direction	
of	this	market	generated	by	the	overall	
climate	for	UK	public	expenditure	and	the	
Strategic	Defence	and	Security	R eview	
(SDSR)	currently	being	conducted	by	the	
UK	Government.	But	the	proportion	of	
Cohort’ s	business	being	derived	from	
o u t s i d e 	 t h e 	 U K 	 d e f e n c e 	 m a r k e t 	 ( p r i n c i p a l l y	
export	defence,	space	and	transport)	is	
increasing	and	the	Board’ s	view	is	that	
the	SDSR	can	provide	opportunities	for	
nimble,	cost	effective	companies	such	
as	Cohort.	W e	expect	to	be	able	to	 trade	
satisfactorily	through	the	review	period	
and	grow	our	business	when	the	
landscape	becomes	clear .

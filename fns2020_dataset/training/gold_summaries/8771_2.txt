NEW DOS GROWTH
In line with recent years, Jimmy Choo plans to open 10 to 15 new 
stores per year. This store opening programme is weighted towards 
China, where we have historically been underpenetrated relative to 
many of our larger luxury peers. This store opening rate allows us to 
capture the growth potential of the white space while ensuring the 
quality of execution maintains the luxury positioning and brand image 
of Jimmy Choo. 
NEW STORE CONCEPT
Jimmy Choo’s retail portfolio has had a similar store design approach 
and materials since 1996. Jimmy Choo debuted a new store concept 
in 2014, developed with David Collins Studio and inspired by haute 
couture salons and fantasy shoe closets. This refreshes the look and 
feel of our stores, emphasises our luxury positioning and presents 
the fashion driven products in more space, while retaining the higher 
product densities in the key Choo 24:7 collection. The new concept 
integrates the dual gender product portfolio, helping with penetration 
of the men’s collection globally. 
EXISTING DOS RENOVATION
In addition to the new store roll-out programme, Jimmy Choo plans 
to refurbish 10 to 15 existing stores each year in the new store 
concept. This renovation programme is weighted towards our earliest 
markets of the US and Europe. While we have only recently opened 
the small number of renovated stores, the initial results are very 
positive and indicate that renovated stores in the new store concept 
outperform existing stores by a noticeable margin.
FLAGSHIP PROGRAMME
In addition to our boutiques and concessions we are planning 10 
flagship stores which are designed to be a more full expression of the 
Jimmy Choo brand in key locations. The New Bond Street and Beverly 
Hills flagship stores have already reopened. Future flagship stores are 
envisaged for New York, Milan, London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo, 
Shanghai and Beijing, with the programme complete by the end of 
2017. The creation of these flagships will not entail increasing our 
number of DOS in any city, as it will be achieved by conversion and 
expansion of space in five existing stores and relocation to expanded 
space in five other locations.

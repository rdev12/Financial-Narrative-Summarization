 Chairman’s statement
for the year ended 31 May 2008
In the year ended 31 May 2011 the Company achieved a 7.3% increase in revenues to £863,439 (2010:
£804,800). These revenue levels although higher than last year were lower than expected or budgeted. Losses
before taxation for the period were higher at £973,888 (2010: £747,091). Losses after taxation for the period
were also higher at £870,961 (2010: £536,019).
Highlights for the 12 month period were:
● During October 2010, the Company signed a Development Agreement with a major US manufacturer of
wheels and brake systems for the aircraft industry. Over the past 24 months, the Company has undertaken a
series of brake disc trials with this client and this agreement formalises the business relationship between the
two companies. This is initially a development agreement and due to the nature of projects of this type, it is
difficult to predict timetables and success thresholds. Nevertheless, both parties are focused on completing
the development test programmes and, should the Company’s carbon ceramic product pass all test criteria,
the business will move to commercial supply.
● During March 2011 the Company entered into a new supply agreement with one of its main clients, Mov’IT
International. This contract expires on 31 December 2014 and provides for the sale of ceramic brake discs
with a minimum value of approximately £2.7 million (€3.1 million) over the contract term.
● Development costs were substantially higher than the previous year due to increased costs associated with
new testing work which was not funded by the customer, but which was necessary for automotive and
aircraft brake evaluation programmes. The Board anticipates that such costs will be considerably reduced in
the coming financial year.
● In March 2011 we commenced a new level of commercial partnership with Alcon Components Ltd, an
existing client, for the supply of carbon ceramic brake discs for selected ranges of high performance cars for
both road and track use. The first application is the supply of ceramic brake discs for the Nissan GTR for their
Asian markets and distributors. Alcon is one of the premier UK based brake systems suppliers to both the
automotive OEM and aftermarket.
● During November 2010, the Company raised £1.19 million, net of expenses, by way of a Placing and Open
Offer to shareholders. The new ordinary shares were issued at 17 pence per share. The additional funds have
and will be used to increase production capacity and tooling and reduce the direct cost of manufacturing
carbon ceramic discs as well as to support ongoing working capital.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
In the year ended 31 May 2011 revenues were £863,439 (2010: £804,800). This 7.3% increase in revenues,
although lower than expected, was achieved with no sales of discs to the US brake system supplier for the
development of a next generation military vehicle. Such sales, at approximately £250,000, were significant
during the financial year ended 31 May 2010. These revenues have been replaced by sales to commercial
automotive clients. The Board does not anticipate selling any further discs to the US military development project
until late 2012, by which time we hope that the brake trials will have been completed satisfactorily. It is our
understanding that our ceramic discs have performed well to date during testing; there have been no breakages
or failures, which is very encouraging but consequently there have been no replacement disc sales.
The order book and contracted sales for the year ending 31 May 2012 amounts to £568,000 (31 May 2010:
£521,996). The contracted sales, expected to be in excess of £280,000, relate to a three year, forward
contractual supply agreement the Company entered into in March 2011 with one of its main clients, Mov’IT
International.

Losses after taxation were £870,961 (2010: £536,019). There are two main reasons for the increased losses: 
(i) an increase in research and development costs which was not funded by clients. These were incurred to
evaluate brake discs for a number of new car platforms and for an aircraft brake and (ii) an unexpected reduction
in R&D tax credits of £108,000. Hitherto, annual tax credits of approximately £200,000 have been received by
the Company to cover R&D activity. 
Looking ahead our R&D tax credit advisers, Baker Tilly, expect tax credits to continue to be received by the
Company and within a range of £150,000 to £170,000. Research costs, not funded by customers, are expected
to fall back sharply to more historic levels in the financial year ending 31 May 2012. 
The Company has taken additional steps to reduce its cost base and savings of approximately £170,000 p.a for
the year commencing 1 June 2011 should be achieved.
Loss per share was 3.09 pence (2010: loss 2.33 pence).
The Company had a cash balance of £615,145 at 31 May 2011 (31 May 2010: £414,513).
Shareholders funds were £1,489,607 (31 May 2010: £1,079,133).
DIRECTORS AND STAFF
Professor David Clark, one of the four founders of the Company in 1992, will not be seeking re election as a non
executive director at the AGM in October this year. David is one of the UK’s leading and most respected scientists
in carbon fibre and carbon ceramic technology and he is an adviser to a number of institutions on this subject
including the Ministry of Defence. He co-founded the Company as a spin out from ICI where he had been a
director in charge of Development and New Technologies. We shall miss his regular counsel at the Board but
we shall continue to have access to his advice.
Dr. Geoff Gould has reached retirement age and has recently reduced his executive status from full time to part
time and he intends to retire fully this year. Geoff is responsible for sales to the aircraft brake and rocket motor
markets and joined in 2001 from Honeywell where he was a senior executive in the carbon fibre business. I am
pleased, however, that we shall continue to have access to his experience and counsel on a consultancy basis
whenever required going forward.
With the retirement of David and Geoff during 2011, the Company is very fortunate that David Bundred has
today agreed to join the Board as a Non Executive director. David is a chartered engineer and has had a senior
and very successful career at some of the UK’s leading industrial businesses. His commercial experience is highly
relevant to the aircraft and automotive brake markets that the Company addresses. During a 24 year career at
Lucas his appointments included General Manager of the Brake Controls and the Truck Brakes Divisions and
between 1993-1999 he was a Divisional Managing Director and latterly Chief Operating Officer of Lucas
Aerospace. Until he retired in 2005, he was CEO of TMD Friction Group GmbH in Germany, a large, global
supplier of brake pads to the automobile industry.
I would like to thank all my colleagues, management and staff alike, for their hard work and dedication over the
past year. It is a credit to all staff that the Company has again maintained its ISO 9001 accreditation.

OUTLOOK
The 2011 financial year was disappointing for management as we had expected revenues to be much higher
together with lower development costs. Nevertheless, the sales achievement should not be underestimated given
difficult market conditions generally, but also as the growth was achieved in spite of there being no sales to the
next generation military project in the USA. Surface Transforms is one of only two worldwide suppliers of
ceramic brake discs and, in light of broader demand for such brake systems, we expect further expansion of our
business despite the difficulties in forecasting.
We have consistently strived to reduce our sales break even levels with lower overheads, increased productivity
and programmes to reduce unit product costs. Current estimates indicate that cash breakeven occurs at
approximately £1.5 million of revenues given the current product mix.
I said last year that the challenges facing management had moved from technology based issues to operating
matters relating to the management of working capital, production and the investment in additional process
capacity to accommodate the expected growth in revenues. These challenges continue and we have
commenced on process capacity expansion as a priority with detailed discussions currently ongoing with
selected suppliers. 
Looking ahead to May 2012, although the euro-zone economy appears fraught with challenges we do not expect
that the banking and sovereign debt problems will materially affect our automotive clients in Sweden, Germany
and the European racing industry. The deficit reduction programmes of the main European economies have
slowed defence spending and so our rocket motor development revenues are expected to remain subdued.
We anticipate lower losses for both the first half and also for the full year compared to 2010/11. We are focussed
on the business achieving cash breakeven as soon as possible and believe that increasing revenues from our
existing customer base will take us to that target. The high performance and race automotive sector in Europe is
expected to dominate our revenue profile in 2012 and there is the possibility that the supply of ceramic brake
components to the aircraft sector in the USA may commence in late calendar year 2012.

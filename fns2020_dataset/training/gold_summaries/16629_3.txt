 I am pleased to present Vero
Software’s financial results for the 
year ended 31 December 2007. 
The Company has produced strong
growth in both revenues and profits
while significantly improving its
software development and subsidiary
distribution capabilities. 
Results
Group turnover increased by 15% 
to £12.7m (2006: £11.0m), a result 
of organic growth and the effect of
acquisitions made in both the current
and previous year. The growth was
achieved despite significant weakness
in the US Dollar and the Japanese Yen
exchange rates against Sterling which
constrained our reported earnings. 
In constant currency terms sales
growth would have been over 18%.
EBITDA (earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation)
increased by 40% to £1.9m (2006:
£1.3m), operating profit rose 30% 
to £1.3m (2006: £1.0m) and profit
before tax rose 15% to £1.1m 
(2006: £0.9m). Earnings per share
increased by 19% to 1.79p 
(2006: 1.51p).
The acquisition of the distributor
Camtek North America in June 
further cemented the relationship with
the Camtek organisation and gave
additional sales and technical 
support weight to our growing North
American operations. The acquisition
immediately made a positive
contribution to both the sales and
profitability of Vero Software.
In addition to the positive results 
from North America, Europe was
instrumental in providing growth with
Germany, France and Italy all providing
good revenue increases over 2006.
European mould and die sector
manufacturers continue to drive
efficiency in order to compete with
their Asian counterparts. This has 
led to a realisation of the need 
for investment in specific new
technologies and in which Vero
Software is a recognised leader.
2007 was also a significant year 
for the growth in managerial and
technically expert staff fuelling and
supporting our expansion in China,
Japan, France and North America. 
In addition the new marketing
department started their ambitious 
role by re-branding the Company
identity to a more inclusive and modern
style that has become associated 
with Vero Software. These changes,
implemented across all products,
subsidiaries and dealerships have
been widely applauded by end users,
dealers and investors alike.

Chairman’s statement
78155 PRE ACC  14/5/08  18:47  Page 2 Dividend Policy 
As cash generation within the
Company rises the Board has 
recently decided to initiate a capital 
re-structuring that will allow the
payment of future dividends. Going
forward we intend to maintain a
progressive dividend policy reflecting
the balance between the investment
needs of the business and the growth
in underlying cash and earnings 
per share. 
Summary and Outlook
2007 represented the start of a
number of product introductions
arising from four acquisitions made
within the last 20 months. Trading for
the first quarter of 2008 will exceed
that of 2007 and the first half of 2008
will also see some very exciting
product announcements backed by
phase two of our specific marketing
initiatives. These developments
together with our continuing interest 
in expanding the distribution channels
through acquisition means Vero
Software will have another exciting
and busy year in the execution of its
growth strategy.

1
City of London Investment Group PLC is a leading

• Admission to AIM on 12 April 2006 after placing 24.51% of the issued share capital in order
to provide existing institutional shareholders with liquidity and the ability to realise part of their
investment. These shares were placed with a deliberately small list of high quality institutions
The Company raised no new money.
• Funds under management were US$2.8 billion at the year end (2005: US$1.6 billion) and the
same at 31 August 2006.
• Profit before tax more than doubled to £4.8 million (2005: £2.1 million), reflecting the Group’s
growth in funds under management and the operational gearing inherent in the business.
The Board is not recommending a final dividend reflecting the fact that City of London was a
publicly traded company for less than two months of the period. It is the Board’s intention
going forward to pay dividends to shareholders twice a year, an interim and a final, with the
level of payout based on cover of two times.
“During the year under review, we were successful in winning new mandates
but also further diversified our asset management product portfolio with the
growth of our natural resources fund and the seeding of three new funds: a global
emerging market fund, a frontier fund and an emerging markets yield fund. In
addition, the Group commenced marketing its services and products in Europe.
It is our strategic objective to globalise our business, building on the very strong
base created in the North American market.” A Davison, Chairman

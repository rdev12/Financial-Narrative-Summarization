CHiEF ExECuTivE ’S r EviE w
I am pleased to announce another year of gas sales based on gas production capacity of 42 MMscfd 
(33.5 MMscfd net of CO
2
) achieving consolidated reported revenues of US$ 41.39 mn and adjusted 
revenues (including “ToP” receipts) of US$ 42.34 mn. We have continued to build scale in our production 
profile and our stated long term business plan remains on track. We continue to achieve this while 
maintaining compliance with the terms of our Production Sharing Contract, applicable laws and sound 
standards of health and safety. The approval of the DOC has opened the way to the establishment of an 
integrated Field Development Plan for the non SGL area of the Block. Our new CPR demonstrated our 
ability to convert resources into reserves and enhance the future revenues of the Block. We have also 
continued with our appraisal program and have completed significant drilling and testing, confirming 
and establishing further gas presence. 
DECLARATION OF COMMERCIALITY
The Declaration of Commerciality (DOC) for a circa 2000 km
2
 non SGL area of the Block (DOC Area) 
was approved by the Director-General Hydrocarbons (DGH) on the 18 September 2014 and by the full 
Block Management Committee on the 20 October 2014. The DOC is another important step in the 
history of the Block as it recognises the commercial feasibility of the development of a large acreage in 
the Block. The DOC area along with the 176 km² SGL Development Area are our chosen areas for future 
development work with the balance of block being relinquished.
The DOC has allowed work to begin on a Field Development Plan (FDP) for the area and this is expected 
to be completed under the usual process on or before February 2016 as required under the PSC. 
Approval of the FDP will pave the way for the grant of mining lease over the DOC area. 
COMPETENT PERSONS REPORT (CPR)
In December 2014 we announced the results of our latest CPR from Senergy The significant uplift in the 
Company’s reserves and growth in Contingent Resources (shown below) reflects the major operational 
progress made on Block RJ-ON/6 since the last CPR was conducted in 2012. This is the third CPR 
completed by Senergy with substantially the same team members thereby building a continuity of 
analysis.
CPR Highlights
•	
Gross ‘Proven plus Probable’ remaining reserves increased to 872 billion cubic feet (“bcf”) (Net of 
18 bcf already produced as of 30 September 2014)
52% increase from 573 bcf assigned in previous CPR by Senergy in 2012
Proven reserves increased to 423 bcf as against 118 bcf assigned in previous CPR by Senergy 
in 2012
New reserves largely attributed to new sands (lower P10) within SGL field and SSM fields
Discounted cash flows at 10% IRR (NPV10) in respect of “Proven plus Probable” reserves of 
872 bcf estimated to be US$ 2,309 mn (before capital expenses) and US$ 1,785 mn (Net of 
capital expenses). 
•	
2C gross contingent resources increased 19% from 2,699 bcf to 3,219 bcf - Current CPR utilizes 
only some of the recent data used in the approval of the Declaration of Commerciality in respect of 
contingent resources.
•	
Best estimate prospective resources of over 2 tcf attributable to the wells outside the SGL 
development area
•	
Pipeline connection to existing cross country pipeline and western gas grids emerging as a viable 
option for long term gas monetization. ANNUAL REPORT 2014–15

The Company has continued drilling a number of appraisal and development wells during the year. 
A summary of cumulative seismic/drilling as at 31 March 2015 is as follows:
•	
2019.05 Square km of 3D seismic data. This includes 106 square km of High Density 3D seismic 
acquired in SGL Field.
•	
1037.28 line km of 2D seismic data. 
•	
15 new wells drilled averaging 3,100 meters per well.
A summary of activities since April 2014 is provided below:
SGL Field Development
During the year, a total quantity of 12,902 MMscf of gas (2014: 8,085 mmscf) was produced from the 
field out of which 9,781 MMscf (net of CO
2
) was supplied to GAIL, which is a significant increase over  
the 6,691 MMscf supplied in the previous financial year. The operations at Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut 
Utpadan Nigam Limited (RRVUNL), the State Electricity Company in Rajasthan, have improved during 
the year resulting in increased gas off take in the second half of the year. The operations have now largely 
stabilized and GAIL expects to reach the gas offtake target as per signed GSPA on a long term basis, 
without needing to make “Take or Pay” payments. There were no major breakdowns during the year and 
GAIL met its obligations under the ‘Take or Pay (ToP)’ agreement. Invoiced revenues increased by 49%  ANNUAL REPORT 2014–15
6
from the previous year as the power plant progressed towards normalized operations. The contribution 
under the “ToP” obligation was for US$ 0.95 mn, a significant decrease over the previous year due to the 
enhanced installed sales capacity of 33.5 MMscf/d being available for the full financial year.
Activities to support additional sales to GAIL have made good progress. Additional successful production 
wells have been completed and tied into the gas gathering system. Treatment and processing plants are 
in place. 
Drilling, Seismic, Completion Operations
Operational activities over the last year have largely followed the Group’s various objectives:
a) appraisal drilling to support the DOC application and integrated field development plans;
b) drilling and completion of production wells for the SGL Field Development continued as planned to 
meet contracted and planned gas sale requirements;
c) testing various wells previously drilled, where gas shows were encountered to enable the Group to 
increase its reserve base; and
d) testing the tight gas recovery potential in addition to conventional gas discovered in the Pariwar 
formation.
During the year, Indus has been acquiring, in phases, new seismic data giving more clarity on the Block 
potential and providing additional drilling prospects. The current drilling programme is progressing on 
schedule and producing positive results. We continue to test concepts and obtain log and core data for 
analysis outside the SGL area. In the SGL area work continues to expand the knowledge of the producing 
intervals. Additional testing is part of a programme to enhance production and maximize recovery of 
gas through good asset management. Activities such as this will increase as we obtain and act on new 
data and production history. An important development in respect of SGL Field was discovery of a new 
sand system called P9 or lower P10 sands, located just below the existing producing upper P10 sands in 
Pariwar formation. This new sand system was successfully tested for production and going forward will 
likely add to the reserves and production from existing as well as new wells.
The details of the wells, which were drilled during the year, are as follows:
Development wells
New Development/production wells drilled during the year included the following:
SGL-SB1 – 3277m Gas Producer (Pariwar Formation)
The SGL-SB1 well was drilled to the base of the Pariwar P10 reservoir zone at 3277m on the southern 
flank of the main SGL Field structural closure area. The well was completed with a barefoot completion 
with an open hole interval of 207 metres (from 3070–3277m) covering the entire P10 and P20 Pariwar 
Reservoir Zones and is currently on production. Initial pressure transient and deliverability tests achieved 
flow rates of 1.03 MMscf/d on a 6mm choke to 5.07 MMscf/d on a 10mm choke for this well.
SGL-15 – 3286m Gas Producer (Pariwar Formation)
Well SGL-15 terminated at 3286 metres within the Pariwar Formation to allow full evaluation of the P10 
and P20 Reservoir zones. The well is situated to the east of the main SGL Field structural closure area 
within the same fault compartment previously targeted by wells SSF-3 and SGL-P2. The well is currently 
perforated and completed for production from the P20 reservoir zone over the interval 3023–3032m with 
flow rates ranging from 1.87 MMscf/d on an 8mm choke to 2.06 MMscf/d on a 12mm choke achieved 
during pressure transient and deliverability testing. ANNUAL REPORT 2014–15
7
SGL-16 (SGL SB-2) – 3196m Gas Producer (Pariwar Formation)
Well SGL-16 reached a total depth of 3196m which corresponded to the base of the Pariwar P10 
Reservoir Zone. It is located within a crestal position within the main SGL Field structural closure area. 
The well was cased with the interval 3111–3117m (Uppermost P10 Zone) perforated and completed for 
production with a flow rate of 4.48 MMscf/d recorded on an 8mm choke (and 6.51 MMscf/d on a 10mm 
choke) during pressure transient and deliverability testing.
SGL-SB3 – 3344m Gas Producer (Pariwar Formation)
Well SGL-SB3 was drilled as an SGL field development well within a discrete fault compartment on the 
western flank of the SGL Field structure, which had previously also been targeted by well SGL-D2. The 
SGL-SB3 well encountered key gas shows within sands in the upper part of the Pariwar P10 reservoir 
zone, which correlated directly with sands that were currently on production in the other nearby SGL 
Field wells. Crucially, SGL-SB3 also encountered gas-bearing sands in the lower part of the P10 reservoir 
zone interval that were not on production in any other well at that time in the SGL Field area. The well 
was cased and completed for production from a 10 metre perforation zone from the lower P10 reservoir 
sands (3282–3292m measured depth). This interval is currently on production from this new additional 
producing zone discovered in the well. Additional gas-bearing upper P10 sands are currently behind 
casing with future additional development potential.
SGL-18 – 3325m Gas Producer (Pariwar Formation)
The SGL-18 SGL Field development well was drilled on the western flank of the same structural fault 
compartment as the previous SGL-SB3 well. It was drilled in a down-dip position on the structure relative 
to SGL-SB3 in order to test the extent of the lower P10 gas bearing sands as encountered in that 
well. The SGL-18 well encountered key gas shows in the upper parts of the P10 reservoir zone. It also 
encountered key gas sands in the lower P10 zone as seen in SGL-SB3. The well was cased and completed 
for production from a 12 metre perforation within the lower P10 reservoir zone sand interval from 3258–
3270m (measured depth), with the upper P10 zone gas sands currently behind casing allowing future 
additional development potential. The well is currently on production from the lower P10 sand zone.
SGL-19 – 3299m Gas Producer (Pariwar Formation)
Well SGL-19 was drilled as an infill SGL Field development well on the main SGL Field structural 
compartment which was previously drilled by nearby wells SGL-1, SGL-6 and SGL-7. Production taken 
to date from this structural compartment had been from the upper P10 zone reservoir sands only at the 
time of drilling. The SGL-19 well encountered key gas shows in both the upper and lower P10 reservoir 
sand zones and was subsequently cased and completed for production from a 9 metre zone (3243.5–
3252.5m measured depth) in the lower P10 target sands. The well was placed on production from the 
lower P10 sands from the same zone as wells SGL-SB3 and SGL-18. Additional upper P10 reservoir sands 
are currently behind casing with potential for future additional development. 
SGL-20 – 3411m Development well (Pariwar Formation)
The SGL-20 development well was drilled on the southern flank of the SGL Field in a down-dip location. 
The well encountered gas shows in the Pariwar P20 reservoir sands and within the upper part of the P10 
Pariwar reservoir zone. The well has been cased but has not been completed for production to-date.
SGL-21 – 3357.6m Gas Producer (Pariwar Formation)
Well SGL-21 was drilled as a development well on the northern flank of the main SGL Field structural 
closure area. The well encountered key gas shows within the upper P10 Pariwar reservoir zone. It was 
cased and completed for production from a 3 metre perforation (3208–3211m measured depth) from the 
uppermost sands of the P10 reservoir zone. The well is currently on production from this zone. ANNUAL REPORT 2014–15
8
SGL-23 – 3409m Gas Producer (Pariwar Formation)
The SGL-23 development well is located on the crestal part of the western SGL Field structural closure 
area that was also drilled by SGL-SB3 and SGL-18. The well encountered key gas shows in the upper and 
lower target intervals of the Pariwar P10 reservoir zone. It was cased and completed for production from 
a 12 metre perforation zone (3318–3330m measured depth) from key lower P10 zone reservoir sands. 
The well is currently on production (since March 2015).
SGL-28 – 3270m Development well (Pariwar Formation)
The SGL-28 development well is located close to the crestal part of the western SGL Field structural 
closure area that was also drilled by SGL-SB3, SGL-18 and SGL-23. The well encountered key gas shows 
in the upper and lower target intervals of the Pariwar P10 reservoir zone. It was cased and completed 
for production testing from a 12 metre perforation zone (3250–3262m measured depth) from key lower 
P10 zone reservoir sands. The well is currently undergoing testing and preparation to be placed on 
production at the time of writing.
Appraisal Wells
During the year , the Company has completed the following appraisal wells and has encountered gas shows 
in the majority of these wells. Most of these wells are in testing stages and are critical in establishing our 
right to retain the maximum area in the Block in line with the DOC application and establishing additional 
reserves and resources. Since many of these wells have multi-zone gas shows, the Company is evaluating 
an optimum strategy for multi-zone testing and completion (having previously gathered favourable data 
sufficient for the DOC application). 
The description of some of the appraisal wells completed in the year is as follows:
A-11-7N – 3378.3m Appraisal well with gas shows (Pariwar Formation)
Well A-11-7N was drilled in order to appraise the same structural closure area as older well SSM-1, which 
encountered gas shows at the Pariwar reservoir levels but had to be abandoned prior to wireline logging 
and testing due to hole complications. A-11-7N encountered gas shows within Pariwar P20 and P10 zone 
sands at multiple levels. The well was cased and one zone selected for testing from the main P10 (upper) 
reservoir zone from a 4.5 metre perforation interval (3224–3228.5m). To-date this zone has failed to flow 
gas to surface at commercial rates and the well is suspended pending further review.
S-EPN-1 – 3489m Appraisal well with minor gas shows (Pariwar Formation)
Well S-EPN-1 was drilled in very close proximity to a major fault trend with the aim to assess whether 
natural fractures associated with faulting would enhance reservoir productivity. The well terminated 
within the upper parts of the Pariwar P10 reservoir zone and only minor elevated gas readings were 
observed whilst drilling. The well was subsequently abandoned and no further testing was carried out at 
this location. 
SX-7 – 4581m Appraisal well with gas (Pariwar and B&B Formations)
Well SX-7 targeted a discrete fault compartment in the western area of RJ-ON/6 for appraisal of Pariwar 
and B&B Formation reservoir targets in this area. The well encountered elevated gas shows within the 
Pariwar P20 and P10 reservoir zones and drilled on to the deeper B&B Formation targets. Gas shows 
were then encountered in upper B&B Formation target sands, with major shows encountered whilst 
drilling the main Lower B&B target zone. Core was taken from key reservoir target zones and the well is 
currently undergoing detailed petrophysical, geological and geomechanical analysis in order to assess 
how best to proceed with further testing of the key gas-bearing reservoir targets encountered in this 
well. ANNUAL REPORT 2014–15
9
S-97S – 132m Appraisal well with gas (Pariwar and B&B Formations)
The aim of the S-97S Appraisal well was to assess a major structural closure in the western part of  
RJ-ON/6 which had been previously drilled by well S-97. The S-97S well encountered significant gas 
shows in the Pariwar P20 and P10 reservoir zones and within target sands within the upper parts of the 
B&B Formation. The Lower B&B sands were not penetrated by this well. The well was cased and 4 upper 
B&B sand zones were selected for initial perforation and testing, covering the intervals 3937–3940m, 
3948–3951m, 3958–3961m and 3980–3989m. Testing and assessment of this well is ongoing at the time 
of writing.
EPN-2 – 1651m Gas Producer (Pariwar Formation)
Well EPN-2 was drilled in order to appraise the structural closure area in the western part of RJ-ON/6 
previously successfully tested for gas (from the Pariwar Formation) by well EPN-1. Furthermore, B&B 
Formation reservoir zones were also targeted by EPN-2 which were not penetrated by EPN-1. The well 
encountered key gas shows in the Pariwar P20 and P10 reservoir zones and within upper and lower B&B 
target zones. Cores were taken from key reservoir intervals and (at the time of writing) the well is currently 
undergoing detailed petrophysical, geological and geomechanical analysis in order to assess how best to 
proceed with further testing of the key gas-bearing reservoir targets encountered in this well.
Seismic
We have 3D seismic coverage of 2019.05 square km area as of 31 March 2015. This includes 106 square 
km of high density 3D seismic acquired in SGL Field area. We have 89% of 3D Seismic coverage of the 
2,000 Square km DOC area and currently work is ongoing to complete the seismic data set to cover the 
entire 2000 km
2
 DOC area.
Financials
During the financial year , the Company supplied 9781 MMscf of gas and invoiced revenues of US$  41.39  mn 
(2013/14 US$ 27.83 mn), resulting in reported operating profit of US$ 30.02 mn (2013/14 US$ 20.93 mn). 
The reported profit after tax was US$ 16.24 mn (2013/14 US$ 11.77 mn) after a foreign exchange loss of 
US$ 0.02 mn. Indus additionally received take or pay payments of US$ 0.95 mn for the period, which are 
considered as deferred revenues and shown as liabilities since these receipts can potentially be set off 
against future gas supplies to GAIL, provided such supplies are over and above 90% of the contracted 
quantities, subject to certain restrictions as to the period in which such offset can be made. An amount 
of US$ 5.08 mn is disclosed as current liabilities and the remaining US$ 25.56 mn is disclosed as non-
current liabilities. Current liabilities include the maximum amount for which the Company is obliged to 
supply gas against the “ToP” amount received, in the next twelve months. The Company is not obliged 
to supply gas over and above 100% of the contracted quantities in any given period. In the event, 
the set-off terms are not complied with, the Company has no further obligation to return back “ToP” 
amounts. Since the amount of “ToP” invoiced is non-refundable, the management considers this amount 
as a revenue and profit adjustment and accordingly adjusted consolidated revenues, operating profit and 
profit before tax for the year were respectively US$ 42.34 mn, US$ 30.97 mn and US$ 30.95 mn after 
including “ToP” amount of US$ 0.95 mn.
While the Company is not expected to pay any significant taxes on its income for many years in view 
of the 100% deduction allowed under Indian Income Tax Act on the capital expenses in the Block, the 
Company has accrued a non-cash deferred tax liability of US$ 13.76 mn as per IFRS requirements.
Post this deferred tax liability provision, the net profit for the year was US$ 16.24 mn.
The expenditure on exploration and evaluation assets during the year was US$ 34.02 mn. In addition 
during the year subsequent to the discovery of gas reported to regulatory authorities, an amount of 
US$ 34.02 mn has been transferred from exploration and appraisal assets to development assets. The 
value of development assets and production assets has increased to US$ 491.34 mn. The development 
assets amortised on the gas produced during the year was US$ 7.58 mn. ANNUAL REPORT 2014–15
10
The current assets (excluding cash) as of 31 March 2015 stood at US$ 11.88 mn, which includes 
US$ 5.23 mn of inventories and US$ 5.33 mn of trade receivables. The trade receivables are mainly on 
account of fortnightly receivables from GAIL billed on the last day of the year. The current liabilities of 
the Company, excluding the related party liability of US$ 23.49 mn and current portion of long term debt 
of US$ 18.39 mn, stood at US$ 5.24 mn. This comprised mainly of deferred revenue of US$ 5.08 mn and 
other liabilities of US$ 0.2 mn.
As of 31 March 2015, the outstanding term loan of the Company was US$ 218.68 mn, out of which 
US$ 18.39 mn was categorised as repayable within a year and the remaining US$ 200.29 mn has been 
categorised as a long term liability. During the year, the Company has received proceeds of US$  131.50  mn 
from incremental term loan facility net of expenses and repaid an amount of US$ 17.32 mm of the 
outstanding term loan facilities, as per the scheduled repayment plan. 
Outlook
During the next twelve months, we expect a further step change in the growth of the Company. Following 
DOC approval we shall look to develop the significant potential of the Block beyond our existing SGL 
Development Area. Strong progress has been made on the preparation of additional gas gathering 
and processing facilities. A cumulative gas processing capacity of 130 MMscf/d is being planned to 
be available by 2016 end to provide a strong platform from which to negotiate further new gas supply 
contracts. We look forward to continued drilling success in both Pariwar and B&B. Negotiations on 
the new gas sales contract with GAIL for offtake by the power plant in January 2017 are ongoing. The 
Company is also progressing the dialogue for the review of gas pricing under our existing sales contract.

 Chairman’s Statement
The year ended 31 May 2009 produced revenue from continuing operations of £28.8m and operating proﬁt before
exceptional items of £2.1m compared with the prior year revenue of £40.1m and £2.5m operating proﬁt. The group proﬁt
for the period was £11.7m compared with a £14.6m loss in the prior year. Cash at the year end was £16.2m compared
with £31.5m at 31 May 2008. A full breakdown of the year is shown in the ﬁnancial statements, notes and narrative which
follow.
The UK Defence business was sold to Teledyne on 15 August 2008 for proceeds of £12.2m (net of costs). The group also
received £1.9m before tax from the onward sale of its Australian wireless infrastructure business, originally disposed of
in 2005.
A second special dividend of 40p (£29.7m) was paid to shareholders on 24 November 2008. The Board has decided to
recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 1.00p payable on 30 November 2009, to shareholders on the register at 30 October 2009
subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Overhead and other cost reductions were implemented as a response to the lower levels of customer demand
experienced in the second half of the year. These prompt actions enabled the business to trade above breakeven on a
broadly cash neutral basis in the second half of the year. Expenditure on new product development and core technology
was maintained.
The underlying market drivers for Point to Point backhaul market growth remain intact, although the immediate outlook
is subdued. The group continues to invest in R&D in order to position the company with competitive products to
respond to market demand.
I should like to thank Stephen Mole, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, who will be leaving the group at the end of September. The
process of appointing a successor is well advanced. As previously announced, I will be stepping down as Chairman at
the Annual General Meeting on 18 September 2009 to be succeeded by Howard Ford who joined the Board in
December 2008 and has considerable experience in the telecommunications equipment and services market.
Finally, I should like to thank all staff in the business for their contribution over the past year.

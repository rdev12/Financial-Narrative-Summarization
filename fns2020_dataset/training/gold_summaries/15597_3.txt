 Overview
T esco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 1
Over the past decade T esco has transformed 
itself into a diverse international business – 
and by following our consistent strategy we 
are well positioned for long-term growth.
Thailand – and for the first time we 
now have more Clubcard holders 
internationally than in the UK. 
It has been another significant year 
for our work on the environment and 
within local communities. As we grow, 
our customers increasingly look to 
Tesco to take the lead in these areas 
– and we are. 
In January, we opened the world’s 
first zero-carbon store at Ramsey in 
Cambridgeshire – the latest step in 
our journey to reduce the carbon 
footprint of our business. Over the 
past year we have made significant 
progress towards our long-term goals 
by reducing our emissions by 7.8% 
on our baseline 2006/7 store and 
distribution portfolio.
This year we donated over £60m to 
charities – once again exceeding our 
target to give the equivalent of 1% 
of our profits to good causes. 
These good results are testament 
to the hard work of our people. The 
Tesco team is now 472,000 strong – 
and we remain united by our goal to 
improve the shopping trip for our 
customers. I would like to thank all 
our people for their hard work which 
I know will continue in the year ahead.
David Reid
Chairman
I am pleased to report that 
the Tesco team has once again 
delivered a good set of results 
– guided by experienced 
management who have steered 
the business through recessions 
before. As markets around the 
world are emerging from this 
recession each part of our business 
is well positioned to pursue our 
strategy for growth.
We have continued to grow sales, 
profits and market share over the 
past year. We’ve also significantly 
strengthened our balance sheet.
Our acquisition in South Korea 
is performing well and delivering 
excellent results, we’ve opened 
our first three Tesco Lifespace 
shopping malls in China and we 
have made good progress building 
the infrastructure and developing 
new products for Tesco Bank.
I am also pleased to announce that we 
again increased our dividend – for the 
26th consecutive year. This consistent 
track record of delivering dividend 
growth for shareholders is unrivalled 
in the FTSE 100.
The strong Group results over the last 
year have been achieved through a 
constant focus on what matters most 
to customers in challenging times 
around the world. A good example 
of this has been our renewed focus 
on rewarding loyalty – at home and 
abroad – which has been a great 
success with customers.
In the UK, we increased our Clubcard 
investment with Double Points – 
giving customers even greater reward 
for their loyalty. 
Internationally, we launched Clubcard 
in three more countries during the 
year – in Poland, Slovakia and

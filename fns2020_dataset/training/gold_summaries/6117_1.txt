 2003 was a year of progress, where the strategies and objectives for
the business were translated into action plans and then
implemented. On this basis alone the year has been a successful
one, with healthy increases in profit, matched by an enhanced
infrastructure and motivated personnel.
The increase in profit was achieved despite some substantial cost
increases in 2003, both in the cost of delivering our products and in
sending out promotional material, and indicates the improving
efficiency of our operations. We are now well placed to drive the
business forward and achieve growth, increasing profit and value for
our shareholders.
Our employees have not just embraced change, they have both
suggested and contributed to it. They can be proud of what they
have achieved, just as I am encouraged that we now have the
correct team in place to move the business forward quickly,
maximising opportunities and minimising risk. We are trying to
foster an entrepreneurial culture underpinned by supporting systems
and effective controls, to drive profitable growth in an expanding
Group. I am satisfied that robust foundations towards establishing
this were laid in 2003 and that we will build upon these in 2004
and beyond. Combined with our increasingly efficient operational
infrastructure, these will enable us to exploit the substantial
opportunities that are available across the Group’s business.
STRATEGIC FOCUS
We remain committed to developing our core home shopping 
skills to drive up sales, increase profit and generate cash, 
whilst maximising the efficiencies of our principal assets – 
our customer databases, our call centre, our production and
packing operations, our IT systems and, of course, our staff.
In 2003, we have focused more attention on our two leading
brands – Flying Flowers and Gardening Direct and much of 
the benefit of this will flow through in 2004; we firmly believe 
that both of these brands still have growth potential. With the
successful implementation of our new customer marketing
database software, we have been able to understand far more
about our customers and their ordering pattern dynamics. This
is playing a key part in determining to whom we market, at
what time and with what product offering. We are trying to
balance new customer recruitment investment against extracting
increasing value from our existing best customers.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT 05
FLYING BRANDS LIMITED  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED 2 JANUARY 2004
The barometer of our success and the basis of our optimism 
for the future lies in our second half performance, where our
enhanced customer targeting strategies have started to contribute
to positive results. 
However, despite the 10% increase in profit before tax and all
exceptional items, we are not complacent about our top line sales
decline, albeit against a particularly strong 2002.
In part this can be ascribed to the reorganisation of our operations
and smarter marketing, by reducing recruitment spend in those
areas that would not deliver a quick enough return, as well as
eliminating unprofitable mailings to the weaker segments of the
database. We have also reorganised our marketing department
along brand lines and have recruited a number of leading 
marketing professionals.
We recognise that there is a perceived maturity plateau in Flying
Flowers and the slow down in Gardening Direct’s previously rapid
growth pattern. We firmly believe that we can at least maintain
Flying Flowers’ turnover levels and that we will return Gardening
Direct to growth. Listen2Books has already reached critical mass
with a very loyal core of responsive customers, so that, although
growth will slow, profits will accelerate over the next three years.
With a careful new product expansion programme, Benham too will
grow and will continue to contribute profits and cash to the Group.
We have 3.8m customers across the databases of all our brands,
from which over 900,000 have ordered from us during 2003. We
recruited 335,000 new customers from advertising in national press
and in consumer magazines. We received over 100,000 orders from
our brand websites.

FLYING FLOWERS
Sales for Flying Flowers were £12.2m in 2003 (2002: £12.8m) with 
a contribution of £4.2m (2002: £4.3m) and a contribution margin 
of 35% (2002: 34%). Internet sales increased by 39% to £1.5m.
Flying Flowers is the UK’s biggest postal flower service. We market
to our best customers eight times a year, but the main promotional
effort concentrates on three ‘peaks’: Christmas (44% of all bouquets
shipped), Mother’s Day (15% of all bouquets) and Valentine’s Day
(2% of all bouquets). We are the market leader in postal despatched
bouquets and also have 11% of the overall mail order gift market
(source: Mintel).
Bottom line improvements have largely been driven by the
streamlining of our order processing and operations areas, and 
a more disciplined approach to buying and supplier control.
The October postal strike had a detrimental impact on new
customer recruitment, but proactive management action reduced 
any other downside. 
On line orders, stimulated both by the revision of our website and a
more targeted approach to e-mailings, increased by 39% in 2003,
with overall participation moving from 8% in 2002 to 12% in 2003.
Market research has shown that we continue to offer excellent service
and the quality of our products is getting better all the time.
We are developing the brand as follows:
• Reintroducing a sub £10 bouquet for off peak activity
• Continuing to introduce new bouquets and stem varieties
• Greater incentives for lapsed customers to retry our service
• Spelling out more clearly the reasons to buy flowers as a gift
• Introducing value add-ons at the point of sale
• Implementing a vigorous campaign to turn recipients into donors
• Testing additional gift concepts and new markets
Flying Flowers is a very successful brand and there is considerable
scope for further development.

GARDENING DIRECT
It is pleasing to report that Gardening Direct had a better Autumn
season after a disappointing Spring. Overall, sales for 2003 were
£14.8m (2002: £16.0m), with a contribution of £5.2m (2002: £4.8m)
and a contribution margin of 35% (up from 30% in 2002).
Internet sales grew by 35%.
Gardening Direct is the largest home delivery provider of
bedding plants in the UK. The Group grew over 120m bedding
plants last year at our two nurseries in Jersey. The brand has two
major campaigns – Spring (with mailings in November, January,
February, March and April) and Autumn (with mailings in June,
July and August). Nearly 1.8 million customers have ordered from
Gardening Direct, with over 450,000 ordering in 2003. We
estimate our customer market share of all home delivered
garden products to be about 16% (source: Mintel).
We believe that the slowdown in sales against a strong Spring
2002 was as a result of:
• Cutting out unprofitable recruitment
• Increasing our staple bedding plant prices above £10
• More aggressive external competition from multiple retailers
• Timing of some customer mailings
Some of the new initiatives to drive the brand forward include:
• Larger format of catalogue (now A4 from A5)
• 30% additional new products to be offered
• New product types to be trialled
• A more analytical approach to customer targeting
• Introduction of lower price points for key product lines
• Greater incentives for lapsed customers to retry our service
• Driving more sales on line
Our second half performance has given us confidence for the 
future. We are the market leader and intend to consolidate our
position as such.

LISTEN2BOOKS
Sales for Listen2Books in 2003 were £3.4m (2002: £2.6m), with 
a positive contribution of £0.2m (2002: a loss of £0.06m). Units
despatched increased from 150,000 (2002) to 250,000 (2003), and
on line sales grew by 45%.
In two years, Listen2Books has grown from a concept to a major
brand in the audio book retail marketplace. We market to our best
customers eight times a year, offering over 400 titles in each main
catalogue. Customer numbers have grown to just under 150,000,
with 85,000 having ordered from us during 2003. We believe that
our share of the adult audio book market by units is already 15%
(source: SWPA).
However, given that the audio books market is a relatively small 
one, Listen2Books rate of growth is likely to slow somewhat. New
customer recruitment (mainly from inserts in selected national
media) has seen a gradual increase in customer cost per order, but
the database of best, multi ordering customers remains extremely
robust and responsive. In the year ahead, we will therefore focus 
our attention on:
• Converting first time buyers to multi orderers as quickly as possible
• Increasing the mailings and product choices to our best customers
• Testing different opportunities to recruit new customers
• Using sales and special offers as incentives for lapsed customers
• Trialling CD’s alongside cassettes
Listen2Books is already a market leader, and from 2004, it will also
become a major profit contributor to the Group as a whole.

BENHAM INTRODUCES
NEW PRODUCTS THAT
CAPTURE THE PUBLIC’S
IMAGINATION
BENHAM
Sales were £4.8m in 2003 (2002: £4.9m), with contribution of
£0.24m (2002: £0.19m). This improved result was mainly due to 
our focusing on extracting more profit out of existing customers and
a move away from more speculative investment in external media
advertising, which explains the slight decline in sales.
Benham, our collectables brand, serves both the specialist collector
as well as those with a more general interest, with a wide range of
first day cover stamps (illustrated envelopes bearing postage stamps
franked on the day of their release) and also a worldwide new issue
stamp business. Benham has a trading database of more than
100,000 customers.
As Benham continues to provide products that exploits its customer
databases, as well as introducing new concepts that capture the
imagination of the public, we believe that this business will step up
a level going into 2004. 10
FLYING BRANDS LIMITED  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE 53 WEEKS ENDED 2 JANUARY 2004
INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS
The introduction of our customer marketing database software
during 2003 is enabling us to exploit previously unseen synergies
between our different brands. We have also completely “cleaned”
our database to eliminate duplication (and therefore promotional
waste and customer irritation) and we are building a much more
focused “customer view” of spending trends by season, price point
and product.
We introduced new websites for three of our brands and saw overall
internet sales increase by 38% over 2002 and, as a proportion of
total sales, from 5% to 7%. I firmly believe that we can continue to
improve both on line sales and participation rates, through rigorous
application of our direct marketing knowledge, targeted e-mailing,
regularly updated websites, and a greater understanding of site
driving opportunities.
Last year, we embarked upon a renovation project of Retreat Farm,
our headquarters in Jersey, with two principal objectives:
• Guarantee at least 10 further years of usage from our despatch
centre (this was constructed in the 1970’s with a thirty year 
safe life span)
• Utilise the space more effectively to improve work flow and
operational efficiency
We are well on track to completing this. Furthermore, we have
simplified our forecasting methods and enabled more direct
interface between departments. This has allowed us to reduce
headcount whilst generating collective accountability and means
that we can implement decisions more quickly and with more
confidence. Complaint levels have fallen in 2003 and market
research indicates that we deliver excellent customer service.
ACQUISITION STRATEGY
Given our database, infrastructure and levels of home shopping
expertise, the Group is more than capable of absorbing other home
shopping businesses while minimising costs. Indeed, by driving
increasing volumes of orders through our existing operations, we
will see economies of scale and substantially improved recovery of
fixed overheads.
Our strong positive cash position means that we can continue to pay
a progressive dividend while being able to review the market for
other growing and profitable brands to incorporate into the Group.
These will enable us to:
• Deliver solid sales growth whilst also increasing profits
• Consolidate our position as a leading direct marketing and home
shopping business with a rounded portfolio of brands serving a
large consumer market
• Invest more into the development of our existing brands
• Test more new concepts to bring new brands to life at the start of
their growth cycle
We have therefore been looking for home shopping businesses (or
the home shopping arm of both wholesale or store retail businesses)
in the Gifts, Hobbies and Entertainment arenas, matching the areas
in which our four existing brands trade.
We have identified several suitable businesses and are evaluating a
number of opportunities. We hope to be able to announce at least
one successful outcome during 2004, but we are focused on
making the right acquisitions at the right price that leverage our
operational assets and enhance our shareholder value, rather than
being committed to a specific time schedule.
OUTLOOK
Flying Brands remains a highly profitable, cash generative business,
where shareholders have enjoyed consistent dividends. It has four
brands that are well established, three of which (Flying Flowers,
Gardening Direct and Listen2Books) can now claim to be market
leaders in their particular fields. The Directors and management are
committed to taking the business forward to a new phase of
profitable growth, through:
• Increasing customer spend on existing brands
• Recruiting new customers to strict pay back parameters
• Reactivating lapsed customers through the right incentives
• Expanding the reach of our current brands with new products 
and categories
• Acquiring new businesses with appropriate synergies with our
current brands
• Developing the internet and on line sales
• Ensuring the correct infrastructure is in place to deliver growth
efficiently and that customer service is always put first
I remain pleased with what has been done but very excited by what
we can still achieve. I have confidence that we will deliver increasing
value to our shareholders as our strategy is implemented. You will
notice that we have changed the format of our Annual Report for
2003. We hope that it will better communicate who we are, what
we are currently doing, and our vision and aspirations for Flying
Brands in 2004 and beyond.

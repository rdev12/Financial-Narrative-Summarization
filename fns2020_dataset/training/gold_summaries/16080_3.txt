 During the year, we have strengthened our position
as a leading professional support services and
consultancy business, predominantly operating in
the UK public sector.
We are now well positioned in all of our core
markets. This year, we have also moved into the
direct delivery of healthcare services through
Mercury Health.
The Group is now managed as seven divisions:
consulting, education, technology, resourcing,
property, communications and healthcare delivery.
I am pleased to report on the results of Tribal Group
plc for the year ended 31 March 2005. During this
period, we strengthened our position as a leading
professional support services and consultancy
business, predominantly operating in the UK public
sector. The Group is now well positioned in its core
markets of education; local government, housing and
regeneration; health and social care; and central
government. The year also saw our successful
move into the direct delivery of healthcare
services through Mercury Health.

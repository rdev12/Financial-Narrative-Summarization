 RB Annual Report 2013 3
Strategic Report   Chief Executive’s Statement
At the end of the second year of our new strategy, it is 
appropriate to reflect on the progress we have made. 
The achievements have been many. Building on the successful 
traditions of the Company, we are creating something unique 
and powerful. We are creating a new force in consumer health 
across the globe. RB is building capabilities to provide innovative 
solutions for healthier lives. 
Global health trends are changing 
profoundly. People are living longer 
and are increasingly aware of the 
need to look after themselves as they 
seek to prolong and enjoy their lives. 
Families are better educated about 
health issues and are increasingly keen 
to take control of their own wellbeing. 
The emergent middle class has become 
far more health conscious as the links 
between health and prosperity become 
clearer. Governments also want citizens 
to take on responsibility for their  
every-day ailments as they strive to 
reduce the economic burden of rising 
health care costs and to focus limited 
resources on more complex diseases.
Our vision and our purpose are to 
support consumers as they make their 
choices for their own households and 
their own families; to put them in 
control and give them the power to  
do what is right for them.

HEALTH HYGIENE HOME 4 RB Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report   Chief Executive’s Statement
As the global leader in consumer health and 
hygiene, RB’s reputation for being ‘the health  
care brand for health care professionals’ (HCPs)  
is growing. Amongst many online schemes, we’re 
piloting an online consumer health care portal 
‘RBforHealth’ in the UK and Italy, giving HCPs 
access to interactive training modules, and a 
collection of essential resources. 
Our business model continues to 
develop to support this strategy. We 
remain focused on Powermarkets and 
Powerbrands where we believe the 
opportunities are greatest. Our new 
geographic structure has paid dividends 
as we have significantly expanded our 
presence in emerging markets. And our 
renewed focus on health and hygiene 
has seen us boost our presence in key 
consumer health segments that we 
believe will deliver benefits to all our 
stakeholders in the future. 
We have done this through focused 
investment in our people and financial 
resources, and through a series 
of strategic acquisitions that have 
demonstrated our intent to develop 
further in areas where we see the  
most potential.
Consumers are at the Centre of  
our Vision
RB owns brands that consumers love 
and trust. They know our products 
can make a difference and help 
them live healthier lives, but our 
strategy is different from traditional 
pharmaceutical consumer health 
companies. Our deep expertise as a 
consumer-centric company means we 
can continuously provide highly relevant 
products and benefits based on what 
consumers want, informed with robust 
science and medical support. 
We continue to invest in this strategy. 
We have increased our spending on key 
partnerships across the world so we can 
understand better where the emerging 
opportunities and needs lie; in whatever 
demographic or geography they exist.

Acquisitions Reinforce  
our Position 
Strengthening our Health Platform
In May 2013 we significantly 
strengthened our health platform in 
Latin America, where historically we 
have had less on-the-ground ability  
to execute than in other regions.  
Our collaboration with Bristol-Myers 
Squibb brought into our portfolio a 
number of important over-the-counter 
brands that have leading positions 
in key segments such as cold and flu 
and pain relief in the rapidly growing 
markets of Brazil and Mexico. In China, 
we acquired the leading traditional sore 
throat brand Manyanshuning, which 
has already shown strong growth in the 
first year of our ownership. Beyond this, 
it is helping to build a consumer health 
platform in one of the world’s largest 
consumer markets. 
Vitamins, Minerals and  
Supplements (VMS)
We have also broadened our category 
portfolio with the purchase of Schiff 
at the end of 2012. This provided us 
with a meaningful position in the fast-
growing area of vitamins, minerals and 
supplements. The category is worth 
£29bn globally and is growing at an 
annual rate of 4-5%.  
As more and more people become 
aware of the potential benefits of 
supplements as part of a holistic 
approach to health and wellbeing, 
this category goes from strength to 
strength. As an example, many people 
want to eat a balanced diet with the 
right nutrients but are unable to do so. 
Supplementing diet is one way VMS 
fulfils an important role.
In each of these cases we have used 
our operational expertise to integrate 
the acquisitions rapidly, and we are 
confident that each will deliver lasting 
value for Shareholders. Collectively 
these transactions will contribute to 
our strategy of creating a unique global 
health and hygiene focused company 
with broad category coverage across a 
host of fast growing segments, including 
analgesics, cold and flu, gastrointestinal 
maladies and VMS. They have also 
expanded our geographic capabilities, 
ensuring we are better positioned than 
ever to meet our targets.
STRATeGIC ACquISITIONS  
AND PARTNeRSHIPS
Guilong Medicine
Strategic acquisition of the traditional 
Chinese medicine brand Manyanshuning – 
the No.1 sore throat remedy in China.
Bristol-Myers Squibb
Boosting our strength in Latin America  
in over-the-counter brands.
Acquiring Schiff has given RB a leading 
position in the large and rapidly growing 
vitamins, minerals and supplements category; 
effectively doubling the value of the global 
health markets we are now in to £60bn.
A key brand in this category is MegaRed – 
made from krill oil instead of fish oil, this 
gives our consumers the same 
benefits for their heart and 
health, but with a much more 
palatable fish-free taste.
MegaRed launches into over  
20 new European and Asian 
markets in 2014.

Focus on the Right Categories and 
the Right Geographies
These acquisitions add to our 
considerable progress on the first 
pillar of our strategy, to focus on the 
faster growing, higher margin and 
better consumer loyalty of health and 
hygiene brands. Our KPI, which we 
had already accelerated to 2015, to 
achieve 72% of our core net revenue 
from these two categories has been 
achieved two years early. 
The second pillar of our strategy is a 
particular focus on 16 Powermarkets 
where the opportunity to grow and 
outperform is greatest, such as in Brazil, 
Russia, India and China. This is why we 
created two emerging market areas, 
our third pillar, LAPAC and RUMEA, 
to enhance our focus, capabilities and 
brand penetration programme. Our KPI 
is to make these emerging market areas  
50% of our core net revenue by 2015. 
We also made the unconventional 
but breakthrough step of combining 
Europe and North America as one 
organisation. This has enabled ENA to 
become a leaner, faster organisation 
with the ability to enhance the scale of 
our innovations across both sides of the 
Atlantic and deliver very good growth.
Our final pillar of margin 
improvement remains key and is 
a focus for every business, in every 
market, every day. It is what generates 
the fuel to invest in our brands and 
ultimately to generate excellent returns 
for our Shareholders.

An innovative collaboration saw Strepsils sponsoring 
the popular national talent TV show The Voice of 
Korea. The Strepsils brand was embedded into all 
aspects of the show; contestants even used Strepsils 
during the shows to keep their throats feeling great. 
This helped Strepsils’ distribution into 16 cities, 14,000 
pharmacies and 30,000 points of sale. Sales doubled!

Strategic Review of RB 
Pharmaceuticals 
As part of our constant commitment  
to drive shareholder value, during 
the year we announced a strategic 
review of RB Pharmaceuticals. We have 
consistently said that, once generic 
competition to RB Pharmaceuticals’ 
Suboxone had been on the market in 
the US for a number of months, we 
would examine all the options for what 
is a very valuable asset. That review 
is ongoing and we will update our 
Shareholders during 2014.
Our Responsibility
Our purpose to provide innovative 
solutions for healthier lives and happier 
homes inspires our business strategy 
but it is a determination that is also at 
the heart of our social purpose. We 
take the same innovative approach 
to our responsibility and sustainability 
initiatives as we do to our business  
and brands.
environmental Performance
We take our environmental 
performance equally seriously and 
are targeting a one-third reduction 
in carbon emissions across the entire 
lifecycle of our products by 2020. In the 
past five years we have already reduced 
carbon emissions per dose of product 
by 25%, leading to our recognition 
as a leader in this area by the Carbon 
Disclosure Project. 
We have adopted a similar approach 
to our use of water, which is becoming 
an increasingly scarce resource in many 
parts of the world, yet is critical to our 
business and to consumers.

Strategic Report   Chief Executive’s Statement
This illness is preventable 
through better hygiene 
and health and our 
goal together is to 
radically reduce the 
global death rate  
by 2020. 
We have set a one-third target for water 
reduction and are designing innovative 
new products that reduce both the 
volumes of water required for their 
manufacture, as well as in their use. For 
instance our new Dettol Touch of Foam 
requires far less water than conventional 
hand wash products as it does not 
require water to create a lather. In 
addition, we have a target to achieve 
one-third of our net revenue from more 
sustainable products by 2020.
Healthier Lives
We have launched a groundbreaking 
initiative with Save the Children to 
tackle the causes of diarrhoea, which 
kills 800,000 children under five every 
year – that’s more than a child a minute. 
Working with governmental, NGO  
and business partners, we aim to 
remove it as the No.2 cause of death  
in young children. 
Our People
The success of these initiatives, and  
of the business as a whole, lies with 
our employees. RB people are different. 
They have unmatched passion and 
commitment, and live for results. Once 
again I would like to thank them for all 
their efforts.

It will shock many people to learn that 
diarrhoea is the second biggest killer 
worldwide of children under five, claiming 
around 800,000 lives per year. That’s 90 
young lives every hour. RB is on a mission 
with Save the Children to change this!

There is little doubt that 2014 will be another challenging 
year. Our actions in 2013 mean that we believe we can 
still look forward to another period of outperformance.

Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 09
Chief executive  
officer’s review 
We continued to lay the foundations of 
further success by increasing both the 
volume and diversity of the assets we hold, 
while at the same time, increasing our 
servicing capabilities.
By focusing on doing the right thing  
for our customers, we have made significant 
strides towards achieving our vision of 
becoming Europe’s leading purchaser and 
manager of debt.
Our proven strategy continues to 
provide the roadmap for all our activities. 
We are already a leading player in the UK 
and Portuguese markets, and we have a 15% 
interest in the French market leader, MCS, 
and have increased our asset base in the 
Netherlands. We have also invested in our 
servicing capabilities, significantly enhancing 
our client and customer proposition.
In summary, we are a well diversified 
business that continues to pursue disciplined 
growth and remains confident in its  
ability to deliver growth in operating cash 
flow and EPS and a ROE percentage in the 
mid-twenties.
Transforming the customer journey
This year, we developed a new set of values, 
designed to better reflect the evolving 
culture of our growing business (see page 12). 
Importantly, they outline the behaviours 
we aspire to when striving to achieve our 
mission of helping our customers repay 
their debts in a timely and affordable way.
In 2015, we also implemented a number 
of new initiatives which will further  
enhance our customer journey. Our new 
integrated customer service platform went 
live, we enhanced our digital offering and  
we continued to rationalise our servicer panel 
to create a core group of highly capable 
and compliant specialist providers. 
Improving performance and profitability
During the year, our profit for the year 
attributable to equity shareholders increased 
by 73.8% to £31.7 million. 
We grew the Group’s underlying net 
income by 19.6% to £35.4 million, delivering 
an underlying return on equity (ROE)  
of 26.5%.
We also achieved a record level of organic 
portfolio investments of £176.3 million,  
with total portfolio purchases for the year 
totalling £180.3 million, well in excess of  
our 2015 replacement rate of £68 million.
2015 is a balanced vintage of portfolio 
purchases, and we are particularly pleased 
at investing at an expected average 
120-month cash-on-cash multiple of 2.0 
times (84-month 1.7 times) from date of 
purchase. Importantly, 32.3% of purchases 
by purchase price were in secured assets, 
more than in any previous year of our 
Group’s history. 
Enhancing our servicing and our portfolios 
Following the acquisitions of Capquest at 
the end of 2014 and Whitestar and Gesphone 
in the first half of 2015, we significantly 
enhanced our servicing capabilities and 
during the year our servicing businesses 
generated £14.7 million of revenue. This is up 
from £1.9 million in 2014 and we expect 
servicing revenues to be circa 15% of Group 
revenue in 2016.
Our new portfolio purchases increased 
our total purchased loan portfolios by 
22.8% to £586.3 million as at 31 December 
2015. Our 120-month Estimated Remaining 
Collection (ERC) increased by 12.8% to 
£1,224.5 million and our 84-month ERC 
increased by 14.6% to £1,028.6 million.
In 2015, we also successfully issued a 
€110 million bond, ensuring we continue to 
have the right capital structure in place to 
help us grow.
Strength in four core markets
We now operate and hold significant assets 
in four core markets, with each of them 
contributing to our strong results in 2015:
•  In the UK, as well as integrating the 
Capquest business, we successfully migrated 
the servicing of the Erudio Student Loans 
portfolio in-house, and continued to benefit 
from a number of forward-flow purchase 
agreements
•  In Portugal, in addition to the purchase  
of two servicing businesses, we made 
significant portfolio purchases, especially  
in secured assets. We also entered into  
a strategic origination and servicing 
partnership with one of our key fund partners, 
and secured a number of deals from the 
agreement throughout the year
•  In the Netherlands, we continued to  
build our presence with the purchase of  
two portfolios
•  In France, we saw our first full-year results 
from our 15% interest in market leader, 
MCS, and we saw our first positive results 
from this investment
Addressing regulation. Deepening 
understanding
We continue to use data and additional 
research to deepen our understanding of 
our customers and have completed a  
new piece of research called Debt Britain 
(see page 22 and 23 for more detail),  
which provides insight into the current debt 
landscape, as well as making predictions 
about what will happen as lending increases 
in line with improving economic conditions.
In 2014, we saw the change in regulator 
from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to  
the FCA, and as our new regulator gets to 
grips with the consumer credit sector, we 
have continued to see a wave of consolidation 
reflecting the high cost of meeting 
regulatory standards.
The year ahead
We will continue to evolve our business 
model to make sure we offer our customers 
and clients the service that best suits  
their needs.
We are a well diversified business with  
a strong origination pipeline – starting  
2016 with awarded purchases of £71 million.
We are confident in maintaining 
portfolio investments at approximately 
twice our average annual replacement  
rate of £78 million. This, combined with the 
continued delivery of the Capquest and 
Whitestar businesses, supports continued 
high earnings growth in 2016, and we  
remain confident of our ability to deliver  
a medium-term ROE percentage in the 
mid-twenties and a progressive  
dividend policy.

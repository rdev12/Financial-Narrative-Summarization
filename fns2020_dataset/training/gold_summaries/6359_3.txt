Dividend
In accordance with the board’s aim to reduce the company’s
target dividend cover from over three times to two and a half
times over the medium term, the directors recommend a final
dividend of 2.24p or DKK0.2435 per share, payable on 11 July
2006, which, taken with the interim dividend of 1.30p or
DKK0.143 per share paid on 16 December 2005, makes a total
dividend of 3.54p or DKK0.3865 per share for the year ended
31 December 2005.This compares with a total dividend of
2.71p per share for 2004 for those shareholders who formerly
held Securicor shares and 1.85p per share for those
shareholders who formerly held Group 4 Falck shares.

Annual Report & Accounts 2005
Board changes
I paid tribute in my statement last year to Lars Nørby Johansen
and Colin Sharman who left us, respectively, on 30 June and 
31 December 2005.
Grahame Gibson joined the board on 1 April 2005 and
became Chief Operating Officer in July.At the start of this year,
we welcomed Mark Seligman to the board as a non-executive
director. Mark has an impeccable City background and is already
proving a valuable addition to the board.
Last September,Waldemar Schmidt announced that he would
retire following the annual general meeting in June 2006.
I accepted his decision with regret as he is one of the most
experienced service sector industrialists in Europe.
As previously announced, I will retire following the Annual
General Meeting after 50 years of service in the industry.
It is service which I have thoroughly enjoyed. I am delighted
that Alf Duch-Pedersen will take over from me as chairman
of the board. I believe firmly that the board is well structured
to take on new challenges in the future. It has my full support
as a major shareholder.
Staff tributes
It gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to the four hundred
thousand group employees around the world.They uphold and
enhance Group 4 Securicor’s excellent reputation as the world
leader in the security industry. I thank all of them, for their
support both to the group and to me personally, and I send
them my very best wishes for the future.
Future prospects
The first full year of trading for Group 4 Securicor focused on
bringing together two organisations to create one company
which is stronger and able to maximise the opportunities
available across a wide range of markets.The integration of
the two companies has been a great success and is a credit
to everyone involved in the process.Whilst bringing the
organisation together and developing the strategy for the future,
we have also continued to drive growth, improve profits and
develop a platform from which the company can continue to
move forward.
Our decision to significantly increase the dividend for 2005 and
to aim to reduce dividend cover over the medium term reflects
the culmination of a successful merger and our confidence in
the strength of our business and the sustainability of its
performance into the future.

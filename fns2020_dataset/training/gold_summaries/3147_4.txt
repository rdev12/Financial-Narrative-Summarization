Centamin at a glance
Centamin has operations in Egypt and Ethiopia in north‑east 
Africa. Our flagship project, the Sukari Gold Mine, is located 
in the eastern desert of Egypt and production is rapidly 
increasing to 450,000‑500,000 ounces per annum from 
2015 onwards. Sukari Gold Mines is jointly controlled with 
EMRA. Centamin’s portfolio includes exploration in Ethiopia 
and since the year end now includes exploration ground in 
Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.
Sukari
The map shows the location of the Sukari Gold Mine on the 
exploitation lease in the eastern desert of Egypt. 
Sukari Hill – the focus exploration and mining to date 
has been on the Sukari porphyry. Surface drilling in 2013 
continued north through the Ra and Gazelle zones and into 
the northern Pharaoh Zone.
Beyond Sukari Hill – reverse circulation and diamond 
drilling programmes have been under way on the Quartz 
Ridge, V‑Shear and Kurdeman prospects to the east, 
north‑east and south of the Sukari Hill, respectively during 
2013. Ongoing drilling to the south at the Kurdeman 
prospect offers the potential to fast‑track near surface 
high grade ore to supplement the existing production. 
Further regional drilling of the exploitation lease is planned 
for 2014. 
Ethiopia 
During 2013, the licence areas developed throughout 
the year were in the northern Tigray region of Ethiopia, 
however, exploration drilling to date has confirmed the 
presence of only low grade mineralisation.
The licence areas to be developed in 2014 are towards 
the south and west of Ethiopia in the Oromiya region and 
Benishangul Gumuz region as part of the joint venture with 
Alecto Minerals plc.
The licences in Burkina Faso form part of the Batie West 
Gold Project which contains the Konkera resource and 
permits along the strike across the border in Côte d’Ivoire. 
These licences are held by Ampella Mining Ltd and 
Centamin gained control of Ampella on 24 February 2014.

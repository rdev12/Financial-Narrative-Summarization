Highlights
Our Renewal and Transformation plan is working and customers 
are experiencing better store environments, improved ranges and 
increased levels of service.
250 stores have been transformed so far, 31 of which are 
Megastores.
We launched KNOWHOW, our new face of service and product 
support which puts customers at the heart of everything we do. 
This features delivery and installation, set up of equipment and 
upgrades, help and support as well as repairs and protection. 
The multi-channel offering provides customers with the 
convenience of online shopping alongside the accessibility  
of our stores, particularly through the reserve&collect facility. 
Dixons Travel is expanding its brand overseas with operations 
now in Copenhagen, Rome, Milan and Dublin airports.
Highlights
Elkjøp continues to perform strongly in all of its markets and is 
expanding its business significantly as we grow market share 
across the Nordic region. Elkjøp operates an efficient operating 
model with centralised warehousing in Sweden serving all four 
principal markets in which it operates. With the lowest store-
based cost to sales ratio in the Group it provides the basis for the 
favoured operating model for the Group.
Elkjøp is increasing its footprint through Megastores by extending 
or refitting existing stores as well as refurbishing superstores to 
the new Group format. During the year Elkjøp delivered strong 
performance in Norway and delivered particularly strong 
improvement in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.

Highlights
The turnaround in Italy remains on track and the business 
delivered a positive EBITDA performance in the year, the first for 
several years. 
Trading conditions in Greece remain difficult, however, Kotsovolos 
continues to generate cash and as market leader is well 
positioned to gain further market share. 
Electro World in Central Europe is already a leading brand and is 
well positioned for the development of the Czech and Slovakian 
markets in the medium term. 
Electro World in Turkey remains a long term opportunity for the 
Group with our joint venture partner.
Highlights
Our pure play brands work together with our store based 
multi-channel brands to provide our customers with the shopping 
trip that suits their needs.
Overall the Group continues to see strong growth in the  
multi-channel operations.
The functionality of PIXmania’s e-merchant platform was

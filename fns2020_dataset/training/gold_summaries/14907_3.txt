As we all know, 2008 and so far 2009, have been exceptionally 
difficult times for the world economy and, not least, for smaller 
Exploration and Production companies like Sterling. 
We announced late last year that we had received possible bid 
approaches and had agreed a conditional sale of our USA 
assets. Major falls in energy prices since then, especially of 
USA gas, have had adverse ramifications, including for our debt 
facilities and cash flows. This, plus the impact of instability in 
the global banking sector, has made it a particularly complex 
position to resolve. I am nonetheless optimistic that, given the 
best endeavours of the management team and the support of 
our banks, for whose waiver in respect to the February 
Borrowing Base repayment until mid-August 2009 I am grateful, 
we shall prevail.
Since the start of 2008 we have repaid $41.4 million of debt and 
as at date of this report now owe $112.2 million. At the last 
Borrowing Base review, computed effective mid February 2009, 
we had a “debt gap”, being the debt repayment temporarily 
deferred as a result of the waiver, of $28.3 million after making 
an $8.0 million repayment. Further payments totalling $3.0 
million have subsequently been made. Under the terms of our 
waiver, we must repay not less than $1.0 million of debt per 
month, and have limitations and bank approval requirements  
on capital expenditures and other procedures. In addition to 
closing the remaining debt gap of $25.3 million, and meeting 
these monthly repayments, the next Borrowing Base review 
due in August 2009 is forecast to require a further debt 
repayment in September. In order to secure the future of 
Sterling, we are endeavouring to resolve this issue as soon  
as possible.
Chairman’s Statement 
Whilst our revenues for 2008 were up 7% at over $103.6 million, 
Group production from our fields in the USA and Mauritania 
was down 17% at 4,809 boe/d. EBITDA was up 15% at $65.1 
million, administrative costs were reduced by 9% and cash 
inflow from operating activities increased by 18% to $56.7 
million. An operating profit before tax and impairment charges 
in 2008 of $7.7 million was achieved, compared with $1.8 million 
in 2007. The statutory operating loss for the year was $175.2 
million (2007: profit $1.8 million).
From their peaks in 2008 oil prices fell by 75% and gas prices 
by 58%. We, along with the industry, have to assess the 
carrying value of our assets with year-end prices in mind. In 
common with many companies this review has resulted in a 
non-cash write-down, which is shown in the financial 
statements as an impairment charge to oil and gas assets of 
$180.1 million. Of this, approximately 44% was in the USA and 
56% was in Mauritania/West Africa. 
Sterling’s proved plus probable oil and gas reserves at the end 
of 2008 were 18.3 million boe, of which proved reserves were 
60% and probable reserves were 40%. There were an 
additional 9.3 million boe of possible reserves and 0.4 million 
boe of contingent resources. An independent review by RISC 
on two of our prospects in Kurdistan and Madagascar has 
indicated net unrisked best estimate prospective resources of 
460 million boe. For the Kurdistan prospect this review was 
conducted prior to the recent seismic survey and we expect the 
results of the seismic survey to increase the estimate of the 
prospective resources and decrease the exploration risk. 
Drilling was successful in Mauritania but mixed in the USA, 
although since year-end there has been a marked improvement 
in the success rate there. Page 5 Sterling Energy plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008

“ I am very excited about the 
carried well in Kurdistan that 
we plan to drill in the fourth 
quarter of 2009. This has the 
potential to transform the 
Group’s outlook”
On the exploration front, I am very excited about the carried 
well in Kurdistan that we plan to drill in the fourth quarter of 
2009. This has the potential to transform the Group’s outlook, 
as have our interests in Cameroon and Madagascar, where 
activity is expected to accelerate. We look to farm out both 
African licences.
I wish to record my thanks to the staff and my fellow directors 
for their unstinting efforts during a period of rapidly changing 
market conditions. Paul Griggs and Chris Callaway left the 
Board in April 2008 and May 2009 respectively. I would like to 
express my sincere thanks to them both. We have also reduced 
our staff by 4% despite commencing operations in Kurdistan, 
and our manpower costs by 22%, on a like-for-like basis since 
the start of 2008. 
Our near-term aims are clear. We must adapt to the new 
conditions, and difficult choices lie ahead. I am grateful for the 
support given by everyone over the last difficult year. You may 
rest assured that no effort will be spared to achieve our 
objectives in 2009.

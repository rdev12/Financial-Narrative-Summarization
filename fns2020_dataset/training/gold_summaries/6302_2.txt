Our first year as a listed company has 
proven to be a period of significant 
development for Fusionex; not only 
have we had a strong year financially, 
we have also taken the business 
through a period of significant 
development and expansion.
We have consistently delivered on 
our promises, serving as a strong 
testimony towards Fusionex’s ability 
to achieve strong double digit yet 
sustainable growth.

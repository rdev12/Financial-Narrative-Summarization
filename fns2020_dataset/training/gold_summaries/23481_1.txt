CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Delivering profitable growth
We are pleased to 
finish the year with 
a record profit level 
We are pleased to finish the year 
with a record profit level, an 
adjusted profit before tax of £9.2m 
(2015: £7.5m). We also grew the 
Group with two high quality 
brands joining during the year, 
helping to strengthen our 
presence in the IT, Digital & 
Design sector and entering into 
the new high growth Aviation 
sector. Both brands are already 
diversified by geography and we 
believe we can help them to grow 
further by being part of our Group.
Our strongest results were in Germany with 
Headway, Japan with Skillhouse and South 
East Asia with Monroe Consulting. We also 
saw solid performances in Finland, Australia, 
China, India, Chile and within the UK market 
the Technical & Industrial sector grew well. 
Group revenue increased by 44% to £270.4m 
(2015: £187.3m) and net fee income was up 
20% to £59.0m (2015: £49.2m). Our organic 
development was offset by weakness within 
the UK and Middle East markets. The UK was 
negatively impacted by market-wide lower 
confidence levels due to the EU referendum 
and in the Middle East, a permanent 
recruitment market, weak economic conditions 
persisted throughout the year. We have 
mitigated the effects of this with some 
restructuring and we believe this will help those 
businesses deliver improved results in 2017. As 
seen historically, the Group has demonstrated 
a good track record for quickly responding to 
issues within our business and returning those 
businesses to growth and as an active 
management team we continue to closely 
monitor results for all our brands and assist 
them with both challenges and opportunities 
alike. The level of diversification across the 
Group mitigates against any individual 
business, sector or market having an undue 
influence on the wider Group results.
The weakening of Sterling during the year 
helped the translation of our overseas results. 
On a constant currency basis we saw revenue 
growth of 33%, net fee income growth of 10% 
and adjusted profit before tax up 11%. The 
underlying growth in net fee income was 
effectively from the investments made in 
Rishworth Aviation and ConSol Partners in 2016 
and the full year impact from Pharmaceutical 
Strategies that joined the Group in October 
2015. Again, this demonstrates the benefit of 
our strategy to be diversified and balanced by 
geography and sector and to focus on both 
organic development as well as making 
selective external investments, with a slow 
down in one sector or region offset by 
stronger results elsewhere. 2014

Five-year plan
2014–2018
For 2016 we have more than two thirds of our 
net fee income generated from outside the 
UK, with Asia Pacific and UK both at 32%, 
Continental Europe at 28% and Americas  
at 8%. We analyse our regional performance 
based on the locations where key 
management and staff are situated, with  
the majority of our brands only working in  
their domestic market.
Pharmaceutical Strategies, the investment  
we made in 2015, has integrated well into the 
Group. We are pleased that it has grown its 
client base and seen an improved penetration 
across existing clients. Our decision to invest 
in the management team, bringing in 
additional staff to support the future 
development of the business and their largest 
client reducing its overall spend on staffing 
requirements has resulted in a short-term 
impact on profitability. The long-term drivers  
of growth in the US healthcare market of an 
ageing population, increasing levels of obesity 
and positive economic conditions remain in 
place and give us confidence in the prospects 
for this business.
The two investments made in 2016 were both 
clearly aligned to our strategic goals, being 
established brands in their sectors, focused 
on professional and specialist job roles in 
sectors with good long-term growth 
prospects. They are already diversified 
geographically but can also benefit from the 
Group’s coverage and global footprint. They 
both have a strong contractor bias and have 
delivered good profit growth and we see 
opportunities for further growth in the next  
few years. We are focused on integrating 
these businesses into the Group, to ensure 
they get the maximum benefit from being part 
of Empresaria. We continue to see external 
investment as an important avenue of growth 
and development for the Group and we will 
look to build up our portfolio of opportunities 
through the coming year, especially in areas 
where we feel we are under-represented as  
a Group. From a sector point of view that is 
Healthcare and Professional Services and 
regionally Latin America, but we keep an open 
mind to opportunities that present themselves.
As part of our vision to deliver sustainable 
growth in earnings per share, we are following 
a five-year growth plan to 2018. We have made 
further progress against this plan with growth 
in net fee income of 20% (10% in constant 
currency) and an increase in the conversion 
ratio to 16.6%, the fifth year of continued 
improvement. Our ‘debt to debtors’ ratio 
increased from 23% to 38%, when calculated 
after excluding the cash held for pilot bonds in 
Rishworth Aviation, so moves away from our 
25% target. This was following our decision to 
use debt finance to help fund the investments 
made in the year. We expect to achieve our 
25% ‘debt to debtors’ target by 2018.
Organic growth is a core part of our business 
model and we have specific plans with each 
brand to help them develop into leading 
brands in their sectors. We are confident that 
the plans we are following will help the Group 
deliver profitable growth across all of our 
regions in 2017. 25%

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW – REGIONAL PERFORMANCE
Our regions
The investment in ConSol Partners strengthened 
our presence in the IT, Digital & Design sector, 
with our existing brands operating within the 
creative niche of this sector. The contribution 
from ConSol Partners was positive at the net  
fee income level with a small profit contribution 
before amortisation charges, but this is offset  
by the legal and due diligence costs incurred  
in making the investment. We expect to see a 
significant profit contribution in 2017 , their first  
full year in the Group. Within the creative niche 
our brands saw a reduced result, following 
increased property costs and short-term 
impacts from changes in management. We  
are confident of an improved result from these 
businesses next year.
Our brands in Domestic services, Recruitment-
to-recruitment sales and Retail (new house 
sales) delivered broadly flat profits year-on-year. 
We saw the biggest impact from the EU 
referendum within the Professional Services 
sector, with net fee income and profit both down 
year-on-year. The market stabilised following the 
vote, but activity levels were lower and costs 
were higher in the year from both property and 
staff costs as they invested in building up a 
service offering in Finance and Accounting.

Revenue increased by 12% and net fee income 
was up 3%, due to the addition of ConSol 
Partners from October 2016 and an improved 
result in the Technical & Industrial sector 
following the move away from low value work  
in the last few years. This focus on higher value 
work also helped lessen the impact from the 
change in rules on travel and subsistence in April 
2016. At the beginning of 2017 we merged the 
operations of the FastTrack and Reflex brands. 
Both operate within the Technical & Industrial 
sector and are complementary in terms of niche 
focus and client base. We expect to see cost 
savings in the back office and a streamlined 
management structure, which we hope will  
also lead to improved top line performance.  
The combined business has a good coverage 
across the UK with offices in the North, 
Midlands, London and South and we have plans 
to grow their fee-earning staff numbers in 2017 .

The Logistics division in Germany also had 
strong results through increased penetration 
with key clients. In the temporary staffing 
division, investments have been made in 
training and sales staff to help drive future 
growth. The business confidence in Germany 
is positive as we move into 2017, however, we 
are cautious about the short-term prospects 
for the market. There are elections in Germany 
in September 2017 and new legislation will be 
implemented in April 2017 which will limit the 
time a worker can be on a temporary contract 
with a client to 18 months, as well as new 
equal pay regulations being introduced. We 
believe the new rules will be positive for the 
industry over the medium term but there may 
be a short-term dampening effect on demand 
as clients get to grips with the new rules. The 
first direct impact of this legislation will be in 
October 2018 and we are working with clients 
and advisers on plans to deal with the new 
rules where they have long-standing 
temporary workers.
Our Healthcare business continues to 
improve, with an increasing proportion of 
temporary workers from Finland and lower 
costs, having closed their Estonian presence 
at the end of 2015. We are pleased with the 
progress being made.

Revenue grew by 22% and net fee income

to £4.9m. There was a reduced temporary 
margin in Germany, due to changes in the 
client mix and pay rate tariffs. Currency 
movements were beneficial, with constant 
currency growth in net fee income of 2%.
The Headway business in Germany and 
Austria dominates the region and we saw a 
good result in Austria, following a key project 
win during the year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW – REGIONAL PERFORMANCE CONTINUED
Our regions
There were strong performances from 
Skillhouse in Japan (IT, Digital & Design sector) 
and Monroe Consulting in South East Asia 
and China (Executive Search sector). Also,  
we were pleased with the results in India and 
Australia. In India, we opened up a third office 
in November 2015 to accommodate growth 
and it is operating in line with expectations, 
but profit growth was curtailed due to 
currency impacts, as sales and receivables 
with the UK contributed less due to exchange 
rate movements. The Monroe Consulting 
brand saw particularly strong results from 
China and Malaysia, with China operating in  
its first full year under the Monroe brand and 
Malaysia profitable in its second full year.  
They are planning to open up in Vietnam 
during 2017. The restructuring of our training 
business in Indonesia has been successful, 
but we expect profit growth to be slow. 
Overall the region benefited from currency 
movements, with underlying results excluding 
currency and investments reducing year-on-
year, due to poor results in the Middle East. 
The market was negatively affected by the 
drop in oil price and the weak economic 
conditions continued into the second half of 
the year. This resulted in a loss of business 
confidence with delayed hiring decisions 
which quickly impacted this purely permanent 
staffing market. Our net fee income was down 
50% over the year. We have restructured the 
business, with a reduced headcount and 
lower costs and believe it is right-sized for the 
local market moving into 2017. A small team 
has also started operating in the UK market,  
to help ex-pat candidates returning from the 
Middle East.

Revenue grew from £29.2m in 2015 to £77.3m 
in 2016, helped from July 2016 by our 
investment in Rishworth Aviation. The growth 
in net fee income was 31%, as Rishworth 
Aviation has a low temporary margin of 6%, so 
there is a greater impact on revenue. Although 
the temporary margin is low, the quality of the 
business is high with contractors on long-term 
assignments and the Company operating with 
a good conversion ratio. This investment 
made a positive contribution to profit, despite 
the legal and due diligence costs associated 
with the investment. It provides the Group with 
an entry to the Aviation sector and is one of 
the leading staffing companies in this niche 
sector. We expect it to deliver improved profits 
in 2017 as it contributes for the full year.

impact on profits. The future structure and 
funding of the Affordable Care Act is uncertain 
following the recent change in the US 
Government. This has been one of the drivers 
of growth in the healthcare sector in recent 
years, but the key underlying factors of an 
ageing population, rising obesity levels and 
good economic conditions continue to exist 
and we believe they will drive growing demand 
for healthcare over the medium term.
We also benefited from three months of trading 
from the ConSol Partners USA business.
In Chile, we were pleased with the continued 
growth, with the developing areas of 
permanent and temporary staffing delivering 
the highest growth and the traditional 
outsourcing business remaining solid.
The Monroe Consulting (Executive Search 
sector) operations in Mexico and Chile are 
slowly gaining traction in those markets, but 
progress is not as quick as we would like to 
see. We are closely monitoring the economic 
situation, especially in Mexico, following the 
new US Government’s approach to regional 
trade.

progress in broadening their client base, with 
some new clients won and a better 
penetration across existing clients. However, 
net fee income was down year-on-year as 
their largest client reduced their agency 
spending. We also made investments in the

future growth, but this cost had a short-term

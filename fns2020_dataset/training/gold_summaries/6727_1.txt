GOLDPLAT Annual Report 2012
STATEMENT FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Goldplat CEO Russell Lamming said, “I am delighted to have joined Goldplat as
CEO at such an exciting time in the Company’s development. With record profits of
£5.24 million before tax and gold production reaching 31,354 ounces, 2012 has
been a truly exceptional year for Goldplat. In addition, the declaration of a maiden
dividend represents a key milestone for the Company and highlights the considerable
progress made by Goldplat to date. 
“Looking ahead, I plan to build on the success of former CEO Demetri Manolis and
continue to deliver on the Company’s key strategy of building a highly lucrative gold
recovery and mining company in Africa. To this end, we will maintain growth and seek
new opportunities for our highly lucrative gold recovery businesses in Ghana and South
Africa.  Furthermore, I look forward to reporting on developments at our latest gold
recovery venture in Burkina Faso, which we believe will be an excellent fit with our
existing recovery operations. 
“We remain committed to developing our gold mining projects in Kenya (Kilimapesa
Gold), Ghana (Amunso) and Burkina Faso (Nyieme). We aim to increase production at
our first gold mine, Kilimapesa Gold, towards the 10,000 ounce mark over the next two
years and delineate in excess of 1 million ounces of resources across our whole
development portfolio by the end of the year.  
“With a robust treasury to support growth at our existing operations and fund future
acquisitions, Goldplat looks set to hit its key targets and in turn realise value for shareholders.”

Chairman’s statement 
Dan Wagner, Co-Founder and Chairman, February 2015 
 
As a newly listed PLC, I am 
delighted with the performance 
of the Company and its 
management team. We have had 
a fantastic year signing 36 new 
clients and taking our client 
roster to 87 clients, with 110 live 
sites. 
 
The Group is experiencing 
growing demand from major 
retail players seeking to 
significantly improve their 
conversion rates, customer 
retention and increase the 
average value of orders. 
 
ATTRAQT’s powerful 
merchandising software delivers 
significant value to retailers as 
demonstrated by the recent 
success of Black Friday where 
the business saw client usage of 
its Freestyle Merchandising 
platform increase to over 6 times 
the normal rate. 
 
More significantly, the average 
conversion rate rose to 5%, 
which is a 50% increase over a 
normal Friday (3.3%) and the 
number of transactions was 
630% higher than normal. 
 
On Black Friday, the Platform 
served 2.8m unique users in a 
single day, an increase of 245% 
on a normal day, together with a 
107% increase in activity 
compared with the same period 
in 2013. Furthermore, Cyber 
Monday and Boxing Day, 
although not as busy as Black 
Friday but themselves key trading 
days, also saw very high levels of 
activity. 
 
The trends we are seeing across 
the Platform are very exciting. Not 
only have we significantly 
increased the number of 
customers on the Platform, but 
their reliance on our software is 
also increasing.  
 
Importantly, the return on 
investment delivered by our 
software to our customers 
continues to grow. Our two 
largest clients saw online revenue 
delivered through the Platform 
increase by 56% and 58% 
respectively in 2014. Beyond 
these two clients, the average 
increase in online revenue 
delivered through the Platform to 
the rest of the Group’s client base 
in 2014 was 23%. 
 
This has flowed through into a 
solid set of results for the year, 
demonstrating top line growth of 
32% to £2.09m with a modest 
increase in EBITDA loss, reflecting 
our investments in the Platform 
and operations of the business. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2015 has started 
well for ATTRAQT 
and the Board 
looks to the future 
with confidence.

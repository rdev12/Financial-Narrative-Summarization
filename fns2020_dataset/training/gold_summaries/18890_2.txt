ADJUSTED MEASURES
Throughout this document we report in US Dollars as the majority of our  
transactions are currently carried out in this currency. Where reported they are 
translated at $1.53/£ (2014, $1.65) – the average exchange rate throughout the year.
The business uses the adjusted measures of underlying operating profit,  
profit before tax and earnings per share, as the directors believe that these provide  
a more consistent measure of operating performance.

as the fundamental  
nature of our business  
is changing’ 07
STV Annual Report & Accounts 2013
If ever, enthuses Rob Woodward, 
there was a Year of Scotland then 
it will be 2014. The Commonwealth 
Games begins in Glasgow in  
July, the biennial Ryder Cup golf 
competition comes to Gleneagles 
in September and the same month 
the crucial referendum on 
Scottish independence is held. 
STV will extensively cover each 
event, further embedding itself 
into Scottish lives, not only on 
Channel 3 but through its recently 
launched mobile apps and new 
TV city stations in Glasgow  
and Edinburgh. However, as  
Rob explains, 2013 was also  
quite a year for STV…
Q: You won the licence to 
broadcast on Channel 3 in 
Scotland again. Was that just  
a formality?
A: If you look at the track record of 
STV and ITV and UTV in meeting  
and exceeding licence obligations it 
was not a surprise. Ofcom had shown 
that the commercial benefit of the 
licence versus the cost of meeting  
the licence obligations was in deficit. 
But we don’t see high quality public 
service as a duty. We see it as part  
of our relationship with the audience 
and celebrate it. We are nevertheless 
delighted that we now have certainty 
in continuing to provide high-quality 
public service through to the end of 
2024 across both our Scottish licences.
Q: The other cause for 
celebration is that you are 
paying a dividend this year. 
A: When I arrived at the company 
seven years ago, I set out a route for 
recovery, a blue-print for how STV 
was going to rejuvenate itself. One of 
the key issues was rebuilding financial 
stability and the financial health of the 
balance sheet. We have delivered 
that. We said to investors that when 
our EBITDA (debt to earnings before 
interest, tax and depreciation) ratio 
dipped down below 2 times that we 
would consider our dividend policy. 
We’re now at 1.8 times and  
I’m delighted to confirm that there  
will be 2.0 pence per share dividend 
in 2013 and, on top of that, we’ve 
confirmed the introduction of a 
progressive dividend policy in  
future years.
Q: So it’s been a long wait but it’s 
now coming good for investors? 
A: We’ve seen a very significant 
recovery in the valuation of the 
business as the investment 
community has realised the strength 
of the business that we’ve built.
Q: What about ratings? 
A: For the first time in ten years,  
our audience has increased over  
the course of a year. I think what 
you’re seeing is that the impact of  
the transition from an analogue world 
to a digital world has now finished. 
We expect to be able, certainly, to 
hold that audience stable, if not 
continue to show slight growth going 
forward. One of our key performance 
indicators (KPIs) is to out-perform  
the rest of the ITV network and I’m 
delighted that again we’ve managed 
to do that, our peak time share being 
1.5 share points higher than the rest 
of the network.
Q: How is on-screen  
advertising doing?
A: We’ve seen a recovery back to 
pre-recession levels. We had a 
particularly strong performance in  
the national market through 2013.  
The local Scottish market was flat but, 
as we head into 2014, we’re expecting 
to see modest growth in both the 
national market and the local Scottish 
market. Television has reclaimed its 
rightful position as the cornerstone of 
the advertising sector. I’ve always had 
a long term belief in its power and 
television has more than fought back. 
What we’re now seeing is a new 
relationship between online and 
mobile-based advertising versus 
commercial broadcast advertising. 
The two compete around the edges 
but they’re actually fundamentally 
complementary. One is very much 
about building awareness, and the 
other is much more around a call to 
action: where to go to get it, or where 
to sample it, special offers. 
Q: And this is the way forward?
A: We believe so. We’re launching  
a new set of KPIs this year and in  
our digital business we’re expecting 
our margin to reach 50% over the 
next three years. We believe that it  
will become an increasingly significant 
component of our business. Another 
of our KPIs is to generate a third of 
our earnings from non-broadcast 
activity between now and the end  
of 2015. 
Q: That aim has been around  
for a while, hasn’t it? 
A: Yes. But we’ve formalised it  
and we’ve enshrined it as one of  
our 11 KPIs.
Q: Isn’t that a hostage  
to fortune? 
A: We want to demonstrate to all 
stakeholders that the fundamental 
nature of our business is changing 
and we’re becoming less reliant on  
a single broadcast product. That’s why 
we set out the importance of diversifying 
our earnings. It is an organic strategy. 
We see strong growth opportunities 
remaining in the markets which we’re 
serving across Scotland.
Q: Yet STV is also becoming  
ever more local, isn’t it? 
A: Yes. We are a local brand. Our 
start point is that we are local to 
Scotland. We have Scotland flowing 
through our veins and our objective  
is to super serve Scottish consumers 
with content that they’re unable  
to get anywhere else, specifically 
tailored to them. It might be watching 
the flagship current affairs show  
Scotland Tonight. It might be  Directors’ Report – Strategic Report
08  Chief Executive’s Review – Q&A 
continued
watching a particular news bulletin for 
your area, be it Edinburgh, Glasgow, 
Aberdeen or Dundee. But equally, we’ll 
also be launching City TV in Glasgow in 
June and Edinburgh at the end of this 
year. These are 12-year licences that 
will give us another window to reach 
consumers right across the central 
belt of Scotland, representing half  
the population. 
Q: Are you confident people will 
find these stations at Channel 26 
on the EPG? In England the city 
stations are listed on the first 
page at number 8. 
A: We will use STV on Channel 3 as 
the main marketing platform to ensure 
that our audiences do find what they 
want. These will be channels driven 
by telling the stories of what is 
happening in the cities. We will be  
on air in time for the Commonwealth 
Games in Glasgow. So STV Glasgow 
will be the place where we’re able  
to give the people of Glasgow airtime, 
talking about the impact of the 
games, how they got involved, what  
it meant for them. At the end of this 
year, we’ll launch a similar channel  
in Edinburgh.
Q: Will the two new stations  
look and sound different from 
each other? 
A: Yes, because they have to represent 
and reflect their local communities but 
equally they will be very different to 
STV. They will enable us to speak with 
a different voice and reflect different 
voices. And, you know, it’s the first 
time in STV’s 50 plus year history,  
that we have the opportunity to be 
responsible for and run our own 
channels. Reaching our own audiences 
through these new services is a really 
exciting prospect and with much lighter 
regulation we’ll be able to experiment 
with new commercial models.
Q: Can you get even more local? 
A: We launched mobile apps for 
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and 
Dundee in October of last year. We’re 
delighted by the response. They’re 
also there to reflect the life and soul  
of a city: if you’re interested in dining 
out, if you’re interested in going out,  
if you’re interested in what’s happening 
on the news, what’s happening on the 
roads, on the rail. They are already 
developing their own personality and 
own editorial voice. We’re positioning 
them as the definitive home of what’s 
happening in Scotland’s main cities 
and they’ll be very complementary to 
the City TV services. You’ll also start 
to see them playing the role of a 
second screen in your hand, enabling 
our consumers to upload content 
directly on to STV Glasgow or STV 
Edinburgh. So if you’re out and about 
in the city and you see something that 
you think is of real interest then you’ll 
be able to be that citizen journalist, 
video it and upload on to our site.
Q: Will these apps make money? 
A: They’re free apps but they are  
ad supported. Our philosophy is  
that STV’s content, irrespective  
of platform, is free to consume.  
And there’s been a 50-plus year 
relationship between brands and our 
content, which consumers are very 
used to seeing on screen. We’re 
simply extending that relationship 
across all other platforms.
Q: The strategy is ‘mobile first’, 
which is what everybody says 
now, don’t they?
A: We’ve been putting mobile first  
for the last year. We said a year ago 
that all future development would be 
driven through mobile platforms and 
then we would develop accompanying 
desktop derivatives to support our 
mobile products.
Q: Will you also be on smart TVs 
besides Samsung? 
A: We’ll work with all the leading smart 
TV developers. This year we’ve launched 
apps with Samsung. We’ve launched 
on Windows 8. We’ve launched on 
Kindle. We have a healthy 
development pipeline and set of 
development priorities to ensure that 
our content is available across as 
many platforms as possible. We took 
a view on what our audiences would 
demand and consumers would want 
to consume. 
We’ve also changed the style of 
development so we’re now what’s 
referred to as an Agile developer. It’s a 
methodology which we employ which 
enables us to move very quickly 
incorporating many different 
disciplines from across the business. 
Q: I’m imagining a lot of young 
Scotsmen in Glasgow dressed in 
T-shirts and drinking Irn Bru – a 
Scottish Silicon-Valley start-up! 
A: They do drink Irn Bru and they  
do tend to wear T-shirts. It is like a 
start-up. We have, in my view, the 
best of both worlds. We have a 
fantastic heritage, a brand which has 
a ubiquitous reach and within that 
we’re fostering a start-up mentality. 
We’re doing things that no other 
media company has done. In particular, 
no other media company will have the 
same combination of assets as we have. 
Q: Because they don’t have a 
free TV presence?
A: Also our focus on reaching local 
audiences through digital and mobile 
products is unique.
Q: How will you be covering the 
referendum as it gets ever closer?
A: We started in 2013 by being the 
first broadcaster to broadcast live 
debates between the Yes Campaign 
and the Better Together Campaign. 
The audience reaction was extremely 
positive. We’ll continue those live studio 
debates. We also have plans to have 
live debates in front of audiences on 
location across Scotland. And we 
have comprehensive plans to cover 
the night of September 18. 09
STV Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Q: Is the referendum debate 
pushing audiences towards 
Scotland Tonight?
A: Scotland Tonight has established 
itself as by far and away the leading 
current affairs show in Scotland. We’re 
typically achieving an audience around 
about three times that of Newsnight 
Scotland. We’ll continue to use that as 
our flagship programme. We regularly 
extend that programme into a one-hour 
format where we take a deep dive into 
particular issues of the day and would 
expect to continue to do that through 
the run-up to the referendum.
Q: So STV Productions.  
Has it had a good year?
A: We’ve had a great year. We’ve had 
32% increase in revenues. We’ve 
transformed the business from when 
we had a single client five years ago, 
which was ITV. We had a single brand 
in Taggart. That was decommissioned 
and we basically rebuilt by focusing 
on two areas, one is daytime and 
we’ve had great success with the 
BBC in Antiques Road Trip and 
Celebrity Antiques Road Trip –  
and the other is entertainment. Just 
three years ago we didn’t have an 
entertainment format and as of now 
we have six returnable formats which 
we are producing. 
Q: I suppose if there’s a uniting 
theme to programmes, such as 
ITV’s Catchphrase and Fake 
Reaction on ITV2, it is that they 
are not tartan. They don’t look 
like Scottish programmes.
A: No. We are a producer of high-end 
content which happens to be produced 
by a Scottish based producer. Our 
strategy was to set out to become a 
multi-genre producer and that’s exactly 
what we are doing. From a standing 
start, we now have a business which 
is delivering over 30% increases in 
revenue growth and we have an 
ambition, as a KPI, to double the size 
of the business by the end of 2015 
from 2011 levels.
Q: What about documentaries? 
A: We produced two landmark 
documentaries last year, Piper Alpha 
and The Lockerbie Bombing. Piper 
Alpha was awarded a Scottish BAFTA 
and the audience award at the 
Edinburgh International Film Festival. 
With Lockerbie we worked with the 
US Smithsonian Channel as partners. 
We’ve also developed a new 
relationship with Red Arrow as our 
new international distribution partner 
to export either our formats or our 
finished products.
Q: What is STV doing in the 
charity business? 
A: It is about ensuring that we use  
the convening power of STV to 
highlight the horrendous situation  
of child poverty in Scotland where 
one in five children grows up below 
the recognised poverty line. Together 
we believe that we can do something 
about it. Our ambition is, over the 
years, to use that convening power; 
our fundraising power; our ability to 
tell stories and build awareness, to 
eradicate child poverty from our 
vocabulary in Scotland. It’s fantastic 
to have the generous support of  
Sir Tom Hunter, Sir Ian Wood and  
the Scottish Government in meeting 
our ambitions.
Q: It’s not a KPI? 
A: But it’s rapidly become a very 
important part of STV’s DNA and  
it’s forming a different component of 
our relationship with our consumers 
who have responded in their millions 
through the donations that have been 
given: £2.5million in the past year.
Q: That’s a very good example  
of consumer engagement, but 
consumer engagement seems  
to be at the core of your strategy. 
A: We see there’s an increasing trend 
to make TV an active experience as 
opposed to a passive occupation.  
It’s not for everybody all the time, but 
it is for some people some of the time. 
We consider ourselves at the forefront 
of offering the most engaging array of 
complementary services. Some 91% 
of Scots watch STV in a month but 
we’ve also got an audience of over  
3 million online and mobile viewers. 
Q: Given there are only  
5 million people in Scotland,  
I find that incredible. 
A: I think what is incredible is if you 
look back. Online, five years ago, we 
had something in the order of 50,000 
unique users. We’ve gone from that  
to over 3 million users. 
Q: Ten years ago Scotland 
seemed to have fallen out of  
love with STV. Does Scotland 
love STV again? 
A: I think it’s a work in progress.  
Our relationship with our consumers 
is evolving. We’re not harking back  
to what STV used to be. We’re forging 
new relationships with new consumers 
trying to position STV right at the 
heart of the highest quality 
entertainment, the highest quality 
news, the highest quality current 
affairs and then, sitting beneath  
that, forge a connection across 
communities, across the country.
Conclusion
As the world looks  
to Scotland in 2014, 
Scotland looks set to 
be following STV in 
ways old and new.  Earlier this year, it was confirmed 
that STV had secured renewal  
of its two Channel 3 broadcast 
licences for a further 10 year 
term. This provides long-term 
certainty for the business and 
allows us to concentrate on  
our strategy of diversification  
and growth. 
Progress towards achievement of  
the strategy is measured against  
our KPIs. The KPI metrics and targets  
for 2014 to 2016 have been reviewed 
and new measures introduced. 
Additionally, we have incorporated our 
strategic aims of one-third earnings 
from non-broadcast activities into the 
KPIs to ensure operational focus on 
achievement of this.
Super serving Scotland’s cities
We are committed to delivering 
relevant and engaging content to  
our consumers. This is underpinned 
by a strategic aim to launch two new 
market leading digital consumer 
propositions by 2015.

Scotland
Online
In October 2013, we launched the  
first of these as four brand new City 
Apps. The City Apps bring consumers 
in Scotland’s four largest cities all the 
latest news, social media updates, 
travel, weather and upcoming events.  
STV Glasgow, STV Edinburgh,  
STV Aberdeen and STV Dundee  
are available as Apps, free to 
download and use on iOS and 
Android devices, and accompanying 
desktop and mobile derivatives.  
The innovative development of the 
City Apps has led us to protect our 
Intellectual Property with several 
aspects of the Apps submitted for 
patents in the US and EU. The mobile 
first approach to delivering content 
reflects the growing trend in 
consumers accessing our material  
via mobile devices. 
The City Apps are designed to offer  
the user ‘your city in your hand’.  
We are delighted with the initial 
response from consumers and plan 
to build on the successful launch  
in 2014 with additional marketing 
activity. Furthermore, we are 
confident of achieving our new KPI  
of 1 million monthly users by 2016  
to help realise our ambition to be the 
most used digital service in Scotland.
The City Apps reinforce our commitment 
to serving Scottish consumers as we 
continue to deliver local news on air as 
well as online, allowing the news team 
to prioritise stories relevant to the 
regional audience.
On air
During ITV’s morning Daybreak 
programme, STV News broadcasts 
three bulletins for north and central 
Scotland. Two lunchtime bulletins  
are broadcast from Glasgow (for the 
east and west) and from Aberdeen 
(for the north). 
Our dedicated evening news 
programmes, STV News at Six, are 
broadcast from Glasgow, Aberdeen 
and Edinburgh, with a bulletin for the 
Dundee and Tayside area. Evening 
news bulletins are also broadcast 
from Glasgow, Edinburgh and 
Aberdeen during STV’s current affairs 
programme, Scotland Tonight, on air 
Monday to Thursday. We deliver in 
excess of our licence obligations for 
news and are committed to continuing 
this in the new licence period.

STV Annual Report & Accounts 2013
In early 2013, STV secured two local 
television licences to broadcast across 
Glasgow and Edinburgh. STV Glasgow 
will start broadcasting on Freeview, 
Virgin Media and Sky in June 2014 
with the launch of Edinburgh to follow. 
The new channels will reach a potential 
audience of almost 2 million in 
Glasgow and 1.5 million in the capital. 
Following launch, the new Local TV 
channels for Glasgow and Edinburgh 
will work in tandem with the City Apps.
At the end of the year a recruitment 
campaign was launched offering  
a wide range of opportunities to  
get involved in the launch of this 
exciting new service. A talented  
and enthusiastic, multi-skilled team 
are now in place and are preparing  
for launch.
The addition of the new city services 
and local TV channels offer a unique 
combination of platforms for audiences 
to consume our content. This gives 
STV an unrivalled service in Scotland 
and offers a wealth of targeted 
advertising opportunities  
to our commercial partners. 
Delivering relevant content 
We strive to offer our consumers  
the best Channel 3 network content 
complemented by original, Scottish 
programming. Public Service 
Broadcasting is at the heart of STV’s 
core channel and we continue to excel 
in the delivery of quality, engaging 
and accessible content. STV News at 
Six achieved an audience share of 
25.6% throughout the year with high 
profile stories including the Clutha 
helicopter crash, storm force gales 
and snow, and news on Rangers  
and Hearts football clubs. 
To commemorate the 25th 
anniversary of the Piper Alpha 
disaster in July, STV News at Six 
presenter for the North, Andrea 
Brymer, broadcast live from The 
Hummingbird Installation over  
100 miles north east of Aberdeen. 
In the run up to the referendum  
on Scottish independence in 2014 we 
have demonstrated our commitment 
to provide a platform for debate on  
all the big issues. Current affairs 
programme Scotland Tonight has 
hosted four debates with members of 
the Better Together and Yes Scotland 
campaigns. This will continue in the 
run up to the vote on 18th September 
2014 with live, leaders’ debates 
planned throughout the year. 
Scotland Tonight continues to be  
the most watched Scottish current 
affairs programme, airing each week, 
Monday to Thursday, reporting on  
all the topical issues of the day. The 
format of the programme provides  
the flexibility to deliver in-depth 
coverage of key news events. 
For example, the resignation of 
Cardinal Keith O’Brian in February 
resulted in an STV News at Six 
broadcast live from Edinburgh. The 
Scotland Tonight programme that 
followed the same evening on the 
resignation of Cardinal O’Brien was 
one of the best performing Scotland 
Tonight’s of the year, up 32% on the 
average programme performance 
with 8.4% share, demonstrating our 
news team’s ability to respond quickly 
to developing stories in a constantly 
moving editorial landscape.

STV continued to attract an audience share 
ahead of the ITV Network and average 
peak-time audience increased year-on-year
In June, STV aired a unique, three-
part series examining the history and 
development of the independence 
question in Scotland. Road to 
Referendum included exclusive 
interviews with the Prime Minister and 
First Minister along with a wide range 
of politicians, cultural commentators 
and well-known Scottish faces.
In 2013, we broadcast top commercial 
programmes, including The X Factor 
and Coronation Street.
The best watched programme of  
the year on STV was the England vs 
Scotland football match in August 
which delivered an average audience 
of 1.2 million and 63% share. Football 
continues to be a popular choice for 
STV viewers with positive ratings for 
our UEFA Champions League 
Specials. In February, STV sports 
presenter, Raman Bhardwaj, was 
joined by special guests Henrik 
Larsson and David Moyes at Celtic 
Park for Celtic’s match against 
Juventus. The special programme 
achieved an average audience of over 
850,000, winning its slot with a reach 
of nearly 1.4 million viewers. 
Our peak-time share across the  
year was the highest in three years.  
In 2013, the peak-time share grew  
by 1.3 share points year-on-year to 
22.12% meaning we tracked 1.5 share 
points ahead of the ITV network, a 
key KPI for the consumer business.
The growth in share makes STV the 
best performing channel in Scotland. 
From September to December we 
were the best watched peak time 
channel in Scotland, with a higher 
viewing share than BBC One Scotland.  
In December, with two major network 
shows on air, our peak time share 
was 29.2% – the highest of any 
channel in Scotland. Overall across 
2013, our peak time audience 
increased by 5,000 year-on-year to 
405,000 viewers while in Scotland  
the BBC, Channel 4 and Channel 5 
peak-time audiences dropped. 
We also broadcast original content 
such as the new series of Scottish 
Passport and Moviejuice, including  
a One Direction special which 
premiered on the STV Player  
ahead of transmission, hosted  
by Grant Lauchlan.
At the start of 2013, a one-hour 
documentary went In Search of 
Robert Burns with actor David 
Hayman exclusively unveiling what 
Scotland’s most famous poet really 
looked like. A life-size model of Robert 
Burns’ head was reconstructed using 
state-of-the-art forensic technology 
by Professor Caroline Wilkinson and  
a team at The University of Dundee.

innovative ways for commercial 
partners to reach their target markets. 
We also aired a number of acquired 
programmes, including Scottish 
charity Mary’s Meals’ Child 31  
and Silent Odyssey about the 
remarkable journey of Scot Gerry 
Hughes, the first Deaf person to sail 
single-handed around the world 
passing all five capes.
STV’s charity, the STV Appeal, also 
contributed to a number of hours of 
original content. In its third year, the 
Appeal raised £2.5 million for children 
and young people in Scotland living  
in poverty. The year-long campaign 
was supported with a series of 
fundraising programmes that 
culminated in a live, Friday night show 
hosted by Lorraine Kelly. The week  
of Appeal programming reached  
2.3 million Scots. That amounts  
to six in ten adults within the STV 
transmission area.
Providing free to consume 
content across all platforms
The launch of the City Apps cements 
our commitment to deliver free 
content for our audience on multi-
platforms as we continue to progress 
our ‘Anywhere, Anytime’ strategy.

on Windows 8, Samsung Smart TV 
and Kindle Fire. These new devices 
join a wide range of platforms already 
hosting the STV Player, including 
YouView, PS3, iOS tablets and 
smartphones, Android tablets, 
smartphones and the web. The STV

licence areas of Scotland to catch up 
on STV programmes and is achieving 
over one million long-form streams 
per month.

The KPI targets will continue to include 
measurement of digital revenues and margin and 
a new target measuring the key revenue source 
of long-form video streams is being introduced
The series, presented by Carol Smillie, 
paid tribute to people whose hard work, 
ingenuity, ambition and generosity has 
improved local communities across 
Scotland and their work was 
recognised at a star studded awards 
ceremony broadcast on STV. The 
series reached just under 1 million 
Scots across the series with an average 
audience of 218,000, and 11.4% share.
STV delivered extensive scale and  
cut through on multi-platforms for 
supermarket chain Lidl. ‘Lidl 
Surprises’ was one of the biggest on 
air campaigns of 2013 and included: 
Mystery Drama sponsorship including 
Law & Order; one minute programmes 
with a cooking theme produced by 
STV Creative; TV advertising; channel 
sponsorship; online digital takeovers, 
including wallpapers, display and 
themed features, for example an 
interview with the band that performed 
the song in the TV adverts.
The campaign was Lidl’s biggest 
marketing push with previous 
campaigns concentrated on  
in store leaflets, flyers and press. 
The commercial team strives to  
create multi-platform campaigns that 
deliver results for clients. The ability  
to regionalise campaigns depending 
on the geographical requirements of 
the client ensures they are responsive 
to market demands.

flexibility to showcase top shows.  
The new format also allows the screen 
view to adapt to any device, whether 
consumers are watching their favourite 
STV programme on a smartphone, 
tablet, desktop or television.
Our relationship with ITV ensures that 
the STV Player is geo-located within 
our licence areas to ensure STV 
viewers can access Channel 3 
content exclusively on the STV Player. 
This supports our commercial strategy 
to increase the number of long-form 
views. In 2013, the total number of 
long-form streams was 11.5 million, 
an increase of 125% from 2012. 
Deepening our consumer 
relationships 
We are continually looking for ways  
to develop our understanding of our 
consumers’ behaviour and are exploring 
a number of ways to generate data 
through transactional services, 
registration and loyalty awards. 
The number of consumer insights  
we hold on our database is nearly 
600,000, up by 25% year-on-year.
Through our partnership with Gigya, 
the deployment of their social 
infrastructure technology has 
provided further opportunities to 
garner consumer data and will be  
fully integrated in 2014. 
These initiatives form a pivotal 
component of our future strategy  
to build consumer insights and will 
ultimately enable us to provide 
personalised content services for  
our consumers and advertisers.

18 Chief Executive’s Review – Production
STV Productions has firmly 
established itself as a thriving content 
business, securing commissions 
across a number of genres and 
delivering new series for the majority 
of UK broadcasters. The strategy  
for growth is underpinned by the 
principles that wherever possible  
we retain the rights to programme 
formats, create returnable formats, 
and produce programmes that 
enhance the business’ reputation.  
In 2013, productions revenues were 
up to £13.5m showing a significant 
growth of 32% from the previous year. 
Building an international business 
In October we announced a new 
strategic international partnership  
with Red Arrow Entertainment  
Group. The deal incorporates 
co-investment, co-development  
and worldwide distribution. 
The partnership enables STV 
Productions and Red Arrow 
Entertainment Group to work closely 
together to develop brand new 
formats for the UK and international 
markets. Newly created formats will 
then be co-produced and piloted  
on STV’s core channel in Scotland 
before being launched internationally. 
In addition, from January 2014, 
Munich-based Red Arrow International 
became STV Productions’ worldwide 
distributor for completed programmes 
and formats outside the UK.
Delivering  
growth from  
a multi-genre 
strategy
Our strategy for growth is 
underpinned by three principles: 
retention of rights, returnable formats, 
and enhancement of reputation.

for repeat commissions.

also sold internationally with 
acquisitions from broadcasters in 
countries including Australia, New

In conjunction with this partnership, 
STV Productions will continue its 
innovative format deal with US 
production company, Kinetic Content, 
part of the Red Arrow Entertainment 
Group. In 2010, the businesses 
announced an exclusive agreement  
to license each other’s original 
formats in their respective countries.
STV’s relationship with key commercial 
partner GroupM Entertainment also 
continues with co-funding for a number 
of productions, such as Let Me Entertain 
You for ITV, The Lie for TV3 and STV, 
and Pothole Britain for Channel 5. 
The international sales of existing 
programmes continued in 2013  
with popular programmes, including 
Taggart, Antiques Road Trip and 
Rebus acquired by broadcasters in 
countries including Australia, New 
Zealand, Denmark and Sweden. 
In 2013, STV Productions secured  
a number of commissions from 
international broadcasters. The 
Smithsonian Channel in America 
co-commissioned The Lockerbie 
Bombing, along with STV, to mark the 
25th anniversary of the disaster, and 
TV3 in Ireland ordered ten episodes 
of The Lie. 
The increasing slate of specialist 
factual programmes includes two 
Egyptology documentaries, including 
a new theory on what killed 
Tutankhamen which starts filming in 
2014. These documentaries will see 
further international development and 
co-production opportunities in the 
year ahead with interest from two 
North American partners.
Creative force 
The productions business gained 
momentum throughout 2013 with 
over 20 commissions secured in  
the period. At this scale we engage 
approximately 700 freelancers on an 
annual basis creating opportunities 
within the creative industries across 
Scotland and London.
New creative formats were 
commissioned and will be aired in 
2014. These include The Lie, a 
general knowledge quiz with a 
difference – there are no questions. 
Instead, a team of two contestants 
compete to win a cash prize by 
identifying the one lie from a set  
of otherwise true statements.  
Eight episodes for STV are hosted  
by comedian Susan Calman and  
ten episodes for TV3 will be  
hosted by Jonathan McCrea.
ITV commissioned eight episodes  
of STV Productions innovative 
entertainment show Let Me Entertain 
You. The show combines the best 
online content with contributors’ 
funny, entertaining and ridiculous 
videos to create a programme filled 
with extraordinary user-generated 
content. These shows are in production 
and will be on screen in 2014. 
BBC One also commissioned 25 
episodes of The Link for daytime 
audiences. The brand new quiz show 
produced in association with LTV 
sees three teams compete to find the 
link between a series of questions to 
win money. The show will be produced 
and broadcast in Spring 2014. Warner 
Bros. International Television Distribution 
has been confirmed as the global 
distributor to bring the brand new 
format to the international market.
STV Productions’ programmes on  
air in 2013 included popular daytime 
cookery show Country Show Cook 
Off. Twenty episodes of the series 
followed Britain’s best loved celebrity 
chefs as they went head-to-head at 
cooking competitions at country 
shows and specialist food festivals 
across the country. 
Ratings success Antiques Road  
Trip and the celebrity version both 
returned in 2013 with a total of 80 
hours and 30 hours of re-versions 
delivered for BBC One and BBC Two. 
2013 was the most successful year  
so far for Antiques Road Trip with  
a move to BBC One and a place in 
the channel’s top-five daytime 
programme series. The January and 
February episodes achieved an 
average audience of 2.3 million while 
the series in November maintained its 
audience averaging 2.2 million viewers. 
The third series of Celebrity Antiques 
Road Trip returned to BBC Two 
delivering an average audience of  
1.8 million viewers per episode,  
a 25% increase on the previous series 
in 2012. 
Both represent a key success of the 
productions business to develop 
returnable series. Previous episodes 
of Antiques Road Trip and Celebrity 
Antiques Road Trip have been 
acquired by UKTV’s Yesterday 
channel with further episodes 
commissioned for 2014.
Diversification of genres 
The strategy to secure commissions 
across multiple genres contributed  
to a key growth metric in 2013 with  
an increase in the total number of 
production hours. The 2013 target  
of 150 hours was exceeded with  
157 hours delivered. This reflects  
an increase of 16 hours on the 
previous year.
Our new Production KPI targets, focused  
on revenue and margin, demonstrate the  
scale of our growth ambitions This includes STV Productions’  
first feature film, Fire in the Night.  
The film was made to commemorate 
the 25th anniversary of the Piper 
Alpha disaster and was aired on BBC 
Two following a cinematic release. 
Fire in the Night launched at the 
Edinburgh International Film Festival  
in June 2013 and was awarded  
the acclaimed Audience Award.  
The film was also recognised with  
a BAFTA Scotland award for Best 
Single Documentary.
Fire in the Night was produced by 
STV Productions and Berriff McGinty 
Films with funding from BBC Scotland 
and Creative Scotland and benefiting 
from the UK Feature Film tax break.
A further documentary was produced 
to commemorate the 25th anniversary 
of the Lockerbie disaster. The Lockerbie

STV’s news archives, including some 
material that had never previously 
been broadcast, with moving 
testimonies from local residents.  
The one-hour programme was 
acquired by ITV to broadcast on the 
network to mark the anniversary.
Two one-off documentaries were 
delivered for Channel 5. Fighters’ 
Wives: The World of MMA aired in 
January, revealing what it takes to  
be the partners of the men who  
earn their living in Britain’s toughest 
profession, mixed martial arts. 
Pothole Britain was broadcast on 
Channel 5 in December achieving an 
average audience of 1 million viewers.
The diverse work of the productions 
team included the delivery of  
three historical crime-drama 
documentaries for BBC ALBA. The 
Gaelic programmes examined the 
crimes of Edward Pritchard, Donald 
Merrett and Eugene Chantrelle. 
STV Productions remains committed 
to the development of drama formats 
and a pilot for Australian format Laid 
has been announced for ITV2.  
In addition to programmes for several 
of the main broadcasters, STV 
Productions is responsible for all the 
programming for the STV Appeal and 
branded content for STV, including 
the Young Scot Awards, RBS – Finding 
Scotland’s Real Heroes and 
Coached Off The Couch – Passing it

Government.
The productions team also made 
Road to Referendum, commissioned 
by STV, which was acquired as a 
one-hour special by ITV as part of 
their current affairs coverage on the 
Scottish referendum on independence.
Entertainment was a particularly strong 
growth genre with re-commissions for 
13 episodes of Catchphrase, including 
four celebrity specials, for ITV and ten 
episodes of Fake Reaction for ITV2. 
Catchphrase, hosted by Stephen 
Mulhern, reached 21.9 million viewers 
across 2013 with an average 
audience of 4.9 million per episode.  
It was the best watched ITV game 
show across 2012 and 2013 for  
the hard to reach 16-34 audience.
The Fake Reaction audience grew 
throughout the first series, increasing 
by 20% from the first transmission  
to the last episode. The average 
audience of the first-run episodes  
was 442,000 meaning the series 
reached over 2 million viewers across 
the series. The second series of each 
show is on air in 2014.

Comedy was broadcast on UKTV 
Gold. Five episodes of the chat show 
hosted by comedian Brand with Barry 
Cryer and Rebecca Front were 
commissioned for UKTV’s flagship 
comedy channel GOLD.

our strategic aim to double STV 
Productions revenues by 2015.

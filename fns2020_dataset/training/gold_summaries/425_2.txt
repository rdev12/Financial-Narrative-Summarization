Our Highlights
Making good progress
Our 201 1 results reflect the good progress we have made across the business, delivering 
against each of our core strategic objectives. During the period we significantly increased  
our production and resource base, expanded our portfolio of assets, strengthened our  
capital structure and posted financial results that are materially ahead of 2010.

Increasing production  
– first oil at Ebok
In 2011 we consolidated our position as 
a leading independent producer offshore 
Nigeria with the start-up and commissioning 
of all 14 wells associated with the initial 
phases of the Ebok field development, 
and at the Okoro field commissioned two 
new infill wells helping to further underpin 
the Company’s profitable and growing 
production base.
Acquisition of major 
portfolio onshore  
Nigeria completed
In 201 1 FHN, in which Afren is a 45% shareholder, 
completed the acquisition of a 45% interest in 
OML 26 and at the same time secured US$280 
million in new financing. The block includes two 
producing fields and three proved undeveloped 
assets with significant exploration upside.  
By year end the partners had almost doubled 
gross production at the Ogini and Isoko fields  
to 10,500 bopd, and are working towards  
ultimately delivering 50,000 bopd from a major 
redevelopment programme.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Overview
Responsibility highlights
Outlook
Operating safely  
and responsibly
We recorded a strong Environment, Health, 
Safety and Security (EHSS) performance 
with a year-on-year improvement during 
the period, when several complex and 
potentially hazardous operations were 
undertaken at our development projects. 
We have also continued to develop our 
Corporate Social Responsibility policies 
against best practice guidance by both the 
UN Global Compact and Equator Principles. 
•  Continued production growth with 
full year net working interest production 
of between 42,000 to 46,000 boepd
•  Ongoing development of our producing 
assets offshore and onshore Nigeria 
•  Early production at Okoro East
•  First oil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq  
at Barda Rash 
•  Up to 14 high-impact exploration and 
appraisal wells targeting in excess of 
800 mmbbls net to Afren across each  
of our core regions
•  Good financial management 
underpinning a well funded and  
agile business
Strategic entry  
into the Kurdistan 
region of Iraq
The acquisition of interests in  
the contiguous Barda Rash and 
Ain Sifni PSCs has increased our 
2P/2C reserves and resource base 
by over 633% at a cost of under 
US$1.0/bbl and offers line of sight 
on major long-term production 
growth. Strategically, we are now 
well positioned in two of the 
world’s top ten oil producing 
countries, Nigeria and Iraq.
Multi-well exploration 
campaign under way 
We have now entered the most active phase 
of exploration drilling in Afren’s history, 
and in doing so have completed our transition 
into a full-cycle business. We have made 
a successful start to our ongoing exploration 
campaign with the significant Okoro East 
discovery in Nigeria, and over the coming 
months will participate in several high-impact 
wells in each of our core areas, all of which 
have the potential to unlock sizeable volumes.

Annual Report & Accounts 2013
1
Overview
Highlights 2013
Operational highlights
• Continued primary focus, with ConocoPhillips, on our three western 
concessions in the Polish Baltic Basin, which we believe represent 
some of the most prospective shale acreage in Poland
• Further testing of the Lebien LE-2H lateral well on the Lebork 
concession for a 60-day natural flow test, following a 21-day natural 
flow test in 2012 and initial stimulation and testing in 2011
• Successful stimulation and testing of both target shales, the Piasnica 
and Sasino formations, in the Strzeszewo LE-1 vertical well on the 
Lebork concession, producing gas to surface from both zones
• 32 sq km 3D seismic survey on the Karwia concession, meeting 
licence commitments, plus 67 km 2D survey on the Lebork 
concession for future lateral well placement
• In order to reduce our expenditure elsewhere, we have allowed our 
two remaining southern Poland concessions to lapse, and we have 
sold our German concessions to Rose Petroleum plc in exchange for 
a €400,000 contribution to past costs and a 2% royalty interest
Financial highlights
• Group cash balances of £26.8 million at year end 2013, against  
£39.5 million at year end 2012, with no debt; fully funded for the current 
exploration and appraisal programme on our Baltic Basin concessions
• Net oil and gas assets of £25.9 million (2012: £17 .7 million), reflecting 
the continuing work programme on the Group’s western Baltic Basin 
concessions and consistent with our stated strategic plan
• Net loss for the year of £4.3 million (2012: £6.0 million), reflecting  
the Group’s share of JV losses in Poland, other non-capitalised 
exploration expenses and the (largely unrealised) net effects of 
exchange rate movements
Outlook
• The 2013/14 work programme agreed with ConocoPhillips is well 
under way, and proceeding on time and on budget; the two planned 
vertical pilot wells have now been drilled in the high-graded area within 
our concessions in order to further delineate the extent of the Piasnica 
and Sasino horizons and to determine the optimum placement for the 
planned lateral well 
• The programme will culminate in a long lateral well, to be drilled in the 
Sasino formation by way of a side-track from the vertical well at our 
Lublewo location, and then completed with a multi-stage stimulation 
and test, over the period Q2/Q3 2014
•  The significant learnings to date will help calibrate well and 
completion designs for the planned long lateral well, which is 
expected to provide a good indication of the commercial potential  
of our western Baltic Basin concessions
• The cost of the 2013/14 committed work programme is 
approximately US$63 million gross, or approximately US$19 million 
net to the Group; based on the budget agreed with ConocoPhillips, 
we currently anticipate a Group cash position of approximately £17 
million at end Q3 2014, equivalent to approximately 20 pence a share

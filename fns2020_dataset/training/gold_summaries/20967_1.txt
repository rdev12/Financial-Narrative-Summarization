Overview
Our business is performing well, thanks 
to our focus on rigorous underwriting 
discipline and the quality of our data. Arrow 
Global is a dynamic, agile and fast-growing 
business and we are working hard to 
achieve our vision of becoming Europe’s 
leading purchaser and manager of debt.
We have increased underlying net 
income by 17 .7% to £29 .6 million delivering 
an underlying return on equity (ROE)  
in 2014 of 26.1%. Our profit attributable  
to shareholders increased by 20.9% to  
£18.3 million.
During the year, we invested over 
£300 million, consolidating our position 
in the UK with the acquisition of Capquest, 
and further developing our mainland 
European footprint. Here, we acquired  
a 15% interest in a French market leader, 
MCS, and entered the Dutch market with 
a small portfolio purchase. We also 
significantly increased the value of the 
assets we hold in Portugal.
We continued to focus on portfolio 
purchases with attractive returns, with 
organic purchases for the year totalling 
£1,267 .5 million by face value for a purchase 
price of £137.7 million, and an average 
120-month cash-on-cash multiple of 2.2x 
(84-month 1.8x) from the date of purchase. 
The new portfolios, combined with  
the Capquest back book, increased our 
total purchased loan portfolios by 74.3%  
to £477.5 million as at 31 December 2014, 
increasing our 120-month Estimated 
Remaining Collections (ERC) by 66.9% to 
£1,085.4 million (our 84-month ERC 
increased by 59 .0% to £897 .3 million). This 
increase in the size of the portfolio  
assets drives the foundation for future 
earnings and collections growth. 
Migration to the FCA, on 1 April 2014, has 
led to significant industry consolidation 
and we expect this to continue with  
a smaller number of highly compliant 
providers emerging. The addition of 
Capquest has further strengthened our 
expertise by enhancing our customer 
servicing capabilities and providing access 
to new origination sources and markets, 
including, among others, motor finance 
and secured loans. Importantly, it has 
reinforced our established commitment 
to putting the customer at the heart of 
our business. 
Capquest’s substantial in-house 
servicing capability, underpinned by what 
we believe to be an industry leading  
IT customer service platform, enhances 
our business model. In addition, the 
continued rationalisation of our servicer 
panel will further increase the level of 
oversight we have as we work towards full 
FCA authorisation, with a Q3 2015 landing 
slot scheduled. 
We are well progressed in combining 
the two businesses – a new group-wide 
organisational structure came into effect 
from 1 December 2014 and servicer 
migration activity has also commenced. 
As a result, we remain confident of 
achieving the £6.5 million of pre-tax cost 
savings in 2016. Following completion  
of the acquisition at the end of November, 
one month of Capquest figures have 
been included in our results.
As we move into 2015, we have a strong 
investment pipeline and expect portfolio 
purchases for the year to be in line with our 
expectations, underpinned by a higher 
level of committed purchases of £36 million 
for 2015, with a further £25 million already

Growing organically and by acquisition, extending 
our reach, and increasing our customer focus. 
This past year has seen Arrow Global reinforce its 
position as one of the leading businesses in  
our industry.
in place for 2016. These committed 
purchases are important as they allow us 
to lock in future portfolio acquisitions  
at prices that meet our targeted return 
expectations. 
We will continue to evolve our business 
model in order to meet new regulatory 
standards and to further embed customers 
at the heart of our business. We believe 
that increased regulation of the industry 
will benefit the leading market players 
and, as such, feel we are well placed to 
deliver continued strong growth.
Our five strategic objectives
To help us achieve our vision, we have 
developed five strategic objectives. 
These are as follows:
1  To protect and enhance Arrow Global’s 
leading market position and build  
on the platform created by our public 
listing and track record to date.
2  To deliver attractive risk-adjusted 
investment returns alongside balance 
sheet optimisation.
3  To maintain Arrow Global’s leading 
position in data enhancement, analytical 
insight and supply chain excellence.
4  To deliver a best-in-class customer 
experience and to minimise regulatory 
risk through a cautious approach to 
product extension.
5  To pursue diversification through  
a disciplined approach to geographic 
expansion and new asset classes.

our strategic objectives, please see

Our key performance indicators 
monitor our progress and keep 
our focus on delivery. 
We monitor our performance by 
measuring and tracking key

KPIs is linked to the remuneration 
arrangements of our Executive 
Directors and senior executives.

Responsibility
The impact our business  
activities have on society and  
the environment. 
Our corporate responsibility ambition 
is to be the most trusted energy 
company. We need to be trusted  
by our customers, governments, 
regulators and investors by effectively 
managing our social and environmental 
impacts. In achieving a broad 
foundation of stakeholder trust, we 
can ensure long-term sustainable 
business success.

responsibility process in more detail.
Our principal risks
To achieve our priorities, we need 
to be aware of the principal risks 
that affect our business. 
The risks we face in a rapidly 
changing energy landscape continue 
to evolve over time. A number of 
measures helped to mitigate those 
factors in 2012 while 2013 presents 
our organisation with more 
challenges. Robust governance and 
a clear risk strategy prepare us for 
any uncertainties ahead.

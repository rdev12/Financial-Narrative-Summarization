 I am delighted to present an impressive set of results for the year
ended 31 December 2006. 2006 has been a transitional year for the
Company with growth generated by the Company’s wholly owned
brands following a period of investment in new programming.
Although the Group’s revenue declined marginally by 3% to £29.7
million (2005: £30.7 million), adjusted EBITDA
1
grew 13% to £15.5
million (2005: £13.7 million) and unadjusted EBITDA by 11% to
£14.8m (2005: £13.3m). Additionally, adjusted
1
earnings per share
increased by 19% to 1.70 pence per share (2005: 1.42 pence per
share) and earning per share increased by 15% to 1.50 pence per
share (2005: 1.30 pence per share). Importantly, there has been a
continued increase in the Company’s gross profit margin, an increase
from 46% in 2005 to 57% in 2006, as a result of a greater proportion
of the Group’s revenue being derived from wholly owned brands.
The quality of our portfolio and strategic decisions made on selective
acquisitions are reflected in our results for the full year.

In December 2006, ER announced its intention to acquire Classic
Media with the resolution passed by shareholders in January 2007.
Classic Media complements and strengthens the Company’s existing
operations and importantly, this acquisition will have a transforming
impact on the financial status of the enlarged Group.
2006 saw ER capitalise further on its commercial relationships with
premier broadcast partners following the launch of two significant
new brands and a record level of new programming delivered. A new
series of Rupert Bear
®
– Follow the Magic launched on Channel Five
and Five Life and Jim Jam & Sunny™ made its debut on ITV1 and
CiTV. The BBC commissioned further episodes of Postman Pat
®
,
The Basil Brush Show™ and a brand new series, Guess with Jess
®
.
Dividend
We believe that shareholders will be best served by the business
continuing to focus resources on investment in the ongoing
development of ER. Therefore, we do not intend to propose a
dividend for 2006. We will continue to keep this policy under review.
Staff
I would like to thank ER staff for their tremendous contribution
throughout 2006.
Future Prospects
The prospects for the Company continue to be excellent and we are
confident of our ability to grow the business and deliver continued
shareholder value.

 Chief Executive Officer’s report
Overview
The year ended 31 March 2004 has
seen InTechnology significantly
expand its Specialist Distribution
activities as well as enjoying
continued rapid growth in Managed
Services. Overall, we have grown
revenues, altered our business mix,
reduced losses and brought the
Managed Services division to the
point when we can now predict
when it should return a pre-tax
profit to shareholders.
Within our Specialist Distribution
division a significant proportion of
our revenues are now derived from
software products which have the
benefit of also generating a level of
maintenance and support sales. On
31 July 2003 we acquired Allasso to
extend our distribution capability into
security software and extend a
bridgehead into several European
territories. Throughout the year we
have signed agreements to distribute
additional specialist products from
existing suppliers (such as IBM’s
software products) and added new
vendors such as Network Appliance,
KVS and FalconStor.
Managed Services now has over 200
clients and over £60m (2003: £40m)
in cumulative contracts won. In
addition to our core storage services,
we have substantially expanded our
range of managed services to take
advantage of the potential inherent
in our nationwide network ring
(‘LANnet’) which acts as a platform
over which we can offer VPN, data
replication, dial-up and internet
services. 
Specialist Distribution
Our Specialist Distribution activities
now span storage, security and
enterprise software. In the UK, we are
engaged in all three activities; in
continental Europe, revenues are
almost exclusively derived from
security software and appliances.
The first half of the year was
characterised by extremely
challenging trading conditions with a
particular absence of large projects
as companies postponed purchasing
decisions and sought to optimise
existing assets. We continued to see
declines in our Sun volumes and the
post merger integration of HP and
Compaq presented some technical
challenges which hampered
shipments. In the second half of the
year however we saw a resumption
of larger orders and achieved a
record performance in the third
quarter followed by continued strong
momentum into the fourth quarter.
In September 2003 we signed with
Network Appliance as their exclusive
UK distributor and, during the
subsequent two quarters have begun
to grow these revenues. 
Higher margin enterprise software
sales have grown rapidly year-on-
year. We now offer a substantially
broader range of software including
not only the leading storage software
brands such as Veritas, Tivoli and CA
but also some of IBM’s enterprise
products like Websphere, Lotus and
DB2. In January 2004 we launched
the distribution of KVS software in
the UK and also, in March 2004 we
launched the first ever IBM Software
Business Partner Innovation Centre in
Europe where customers could view
examples of how IBM’s software
portfolio can be utilised.
The acquisition of Allasso has further
broadened our specialist distribution
offering into network security as well
as opening up new territories in
which to operate. InTechnology is
now Europe’s leading supplier of
firewall, intrusion detection,
authentication and network security
products from companies such as
Nokia, Check Point, Symantec,
NetScreen and Clearswift. 
On 31 July 2003 we acquired Allasso 
to extend our distribution capability into
security software and extend a bridgehead 
into several European territories.
6 7
Allasso’s operations in France,
Germany, Spain, Italy, the
Netherlands and latterly Switzerland
present a springboard for further
territorial growth as well as a
framework through which to
introduce storage as well as managed
services. Since the acquisition of
Allasso we have integrated the UK
operation into a single UK Specialist
Distribution business while retaining
the Allasso brand within the security
arena. The Allasso team will continue
to operate as a dedicated security
distributor, with no dilution of focus
and with additional Group
investment to support growth in
their sales and technical resource. 
The customer relationships that
InTechnology and Allasso have
developed over the years have
remarkably little overlap and present
an attractive opportunity for us to
offer our customers a one-stop shop
for some of IT’s more complex
network-centre products in storage,
security and software. 
Managed Services
The rate at which the Managed
Services division has been winning
new contracts increased quarter-on-
quarter. We have continued to focus
our efforts with considerable success
in the public sector, financial services
and professional services industries.
We now manage data and provide
offsite back-up or network services
for over 200 clients including a
number of central and local
government departments. We have
an NHS Code of Connection and
manage the back-up of clinical and
patient records. 
This year marks the first full year
when we have used our nationwide
network ring (‘LANnet’) which has
points of presence in 22 UK cities.
Using this as a multi-service
platform, our clients can now place
servers or storage devices in our data
centres as if they were an extension
of their own offices.
In the third quarter of the financial
year we launched our InPartnership
Programme through which we have
formalised many of our relationships
with consultants, integrators and
outsourcers that sell our services to
their clients. Sales of our managed
services through the channel have
proved to be extremely effective as
we enable our partners to capture
more of their clients’ recurring IT
spend without their needing to invest
in their own data centres and
network infrastructure or work with
a competing IT partner. 
The year ahead
In this next fiscal year we have a
number of initiatives which we will
be launching to introduce additional
products to the channel, expand the
range of products offered through
our continental European offices,
improve cross-selling to our
customers through more effective
sales co-ordination and increase the
utilisation of our professional
services and support teams across
the entire Group. 
I am confident that the year ahead
will be one of continued growth and
progress.

 18 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT
The Group has delivered another year of underlying growth in gross 
profit across all regions on a constant currency basis, returning to 
its pre-financial crisis level of operating profit.
The UK & Ireland delivered further progress during the year, with 
particular success in growing market share. Overall organic revenues 
and gross profit, including the UK offshore business, hit record 
highs despite the market for permanent recruitment being weaker 
at the end of the year, which held back operating profit.
The underlying results in our European operations were strong, 
despite foreign exchange headwinds, with the exception of the 
loss-making Nash Technologies GmbH (“NT Group”), which was 
sold in December 2015. Sweden recorded a year of strong growth 
but, as with the euro, the weak Swedish krona held back results.
Record results were delivered by the USA, reflecting progress in all 
three service lines: executive search, IT recruitment and offshore 
services. The business has focused its activities on the fast-
growing technology and digital sectors and has benefited from 
unprecedented levels of demand for IT skills, ranging from highly 
skilled software developers to senior leadership roles within global 
Fortune 500 companies.
Strong growth was achieved in Asia, an encouraging result in a 
relatively new region of growth for the Group. The best performers 
were the businesses in Vietnam and Japan, but Hong Kong also 
significantly improved its results in the second half. Australia was 
steady and a new office was opened in Singapore. 
More details about the performance of the business are set out 
below by region. All results are from continuing operations; details 
of the performance of discontinued operations in respect of the 
German outsourcing business are set out in the FD Report.
United Kingdom & Ireland 
The UK & Ireland represented 41.0% of the Group’s gross profit 
in 2016 and operated from 10 offices, employing 247 fee earners 
across the region. The Group has leveraged its unique portfolio of 
services to gain considerable market share over the last decade 
despite the market being mature and highly competitive. Harvey 
Nash and its subsidiary brands Impact Executives (interim), 
Mortimer Spinks (specialist digital technology talent) and Nash 
Tech (offshore software development) have strong market 
positions in executive and professional recruitment across the UK 
and Ireland and a growing presence in offshore services. Permanent 
placements accounted for 36.4%, contract placements 49.1% and 
offshore services 14.5% of gross profit.
 
The business is one of the market leaders in technology 
recruitment and a significant opportunity to integrate the broad 
service portfolio further exists across the business. In particular, 
its growing capability to augment client recruitment of specialist 
technology skills with offshore teams, where appropriate, can offer 
a more valuable and competitive cost proposition than contract 
recruitment.
 During the first half of the year particularly, the UK contingent 
recruitment business enjoyed strong growth and experienced 
robust demand especially for permanent hires. However, during 
the final two months of the year, client decision-making processes 
slowed and a swing from permanent recruitment to contract

reflected a more cautious “wait and see” approach. Trading 
conditions in the senior market for executive and leadership 
roles tightened up considerably compared with the prior year, 
impacted first by the UK general election in May and then by global 
uncertainty in relation to China and energy markets in the second 
half. The offshore business, however, appeared to benefit from 
these variable conditions and reported a record year in the UK. 
Revenue increased by 1.8% to £233.4m (2015: £229.3m) and gross 
profit increased by 3.6% to £37.0m (2015: £35.7m). Reported 
operating profit was down 2.8% at £3.5m compared with £3.6m 
the previous year. 
This was a solid performance, as the business capitalised on market 
share gains and continued to invest in capacity expansion. The 
main reasons for the small reduction in operating profit were a 
broad swing from permanent to temporary recruitment in the UK 
in the final quarter, a weaker market for senior executive search 
and a decline in contribution from Ireland.
Strong growth came from the UK regions and Scotland. This was 
driven by organic investment in headcount in existing offices and 
newly established satellite locations such as Glasgow and Bristol. 
New client wins and increased market share resulted in a 17.0% 
increase in gross profit for the year compared with the prior year. 
London was weaker, with exposure to the oil and gas slowdown 
affecting numbers of contractors on billing. The decline in the 
energy market also affected executive recruitment and the Group 
decided to close its Oil & Gas business based in Warrington, which 
focused on recruiting international engineering and technology 
candidates mainly for companies based in the Middle East. 
Mainland Europe
Mainland Europe is the Group’s largest geographic region. With 
operations in nine countries, the Group employs 300 staff in 18 
offices across Northern Europe, and the Group has many leading 
market positions across the continent. Harvey Nash Alumni is the 
clear market leader in executive and leadership services and the 
largest executive and senior professional recruitment business 
in the Nordics. In the Benelux, the Group is the largest specialist 
technology recruiter in the market. In Germany and Switzerland, 
the Group has been trading for over 20 years as a leading player 
in certain high-value niche markets. The brand is well recognised 
for quality and a professional approach to recruitment. The region, 
which includes Poland, comprises a number of large, mature 
markets, across which there is a broad range of global competition. 
This market offers attractive opportunities for the Group in two 
key areas. First, there are opportunities to expand in temporary 
and contract placement, as clients seek to outsource risks arising 
from directly employing IT staff. This includes outsourcing 
models, such as extended workforce services, where the Group 
flexibly employs IT consultants and hires them out to companies 
as employees. This is a growing trend in Germany particularly but 
also in the Benelux. Second, there are opportunities to develop 
further in board services and executive recruitment, such as in 
the Nordics where this market is growing and companies are 
undergoing significant change. 
 
 
In 2016, the region generally enjoyed improved market conditions 
but this was affected significantly by the weakness of the euro and 
other currencies. Revenue in Mainland Europe was £378.0m (2015: 
£395.0m) and gross profit was £32.6m (2015: £33.3m), declines of 
4.3% and 2.1% respectively. However, in constant currency, revenue 
increased by 5.1% and gross profit increased by 7.8%. Operating 
profit reduced by 7.1% from the prior year to £5.2m (2015: £5.6m) 
but again increased by 1.8% on a constant currency basis. Across 
the region, permanent executive and professional placements 
accounted for 38.0% and temporary and contract management 
placements 62.0% of gross profit. 
Results from the Benelux were solid with gross profit increasing 
3.1% on a constant currency basis, as clients continued to favour 
temporary contract recruitment over permanent recruitment. In 
the Netherlands, uncertainty over new legislation in relation to 
temporary recruitment affected demand and resulted in delays to 
clients hiring. In Belgium, the Group made further progress in its 
relatively new location in Ghent with a good business contribution 
for the year and the new service of providing teams of permanently 
employed technical apprentices reported an increase in gross 
margin of 10.0%. Deferred consideration of £2.1m relating to the 
acquisition in Antwerp acquired in 2012 was settled during the 
year. This business has delivered excellent results throughout its 
three-year earn-out period. 
The Nordic region comprises Norway, Sweden and Finland. The 
Group’s business in Sweden reported strong financial results with 
overall gross profit up 7.3% despite challenging trading conditions, 
and business contribution up 42.7%. The overall reported results 
were materially impacted by weak currencies, recession in Finland 
and uncertainty linked to the decline of the oil price in Norway. The 
business in Finland held up well with net fees only 13.9% below the 
prior year. The office was broadly breakeven as a result. In Norway, 
despite the challenges, the prior year’s loss was reduced by 9.4%. 
The results from Central & Eastern Europe, which includes 
Germany, Switzerland and Poland, were stronger: particularly in 
Germany, which was up 5.6% in gross profit and 53.8% in business 
contribution. In Switzerland, results were down 8.8% on the prior 
year mainly due to the decline of managed services revenues in the 
Financial Services sector. In Poland, the technology recruitment 
business reported a slightly higher loss than in the prior year, but 
this was mainly related to restructuring. The business will serve as 
a nearshore recruitment centre for the Swiss business with the 
benefits of lower costs and higher productivity. 
The Group disposed of its German telecommunications outsourcing 
business, the NT Group, and its two subsidiaries on 6 December 
2015. The NT Group was identified as non-core in a strategic review 
of the Group’s operations in 2014 and, following a full review of

Asia Pacific
The Group has six offices across the Asia Pacific region, employing 
48 fee earners and representing 6.5% of the Group’s gross profit 
during the year. Growth in gross profit was the fastest regional 
growth achieved across the Group, albeit from a lower base. 
Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong are well developed and offer 
good opportunities for professional recruitment, executive search 
and leadership consulting. Multinational companies base many 
of their senior staff in these locations and compensation levels 
are comparable with Europe. China also represents a growing 
opportunity, as large domestic Chinese companies seek to grow 
their international presence and are increasingly employing 
recruiters to search for business leaders. 
Our Vietnam business is located in the faster-growing South East 
Asian economic region, which is generally underdeveloped and 
offers strong growth opportunities for recruitment and offshoring. 
Australia is a mature, well-developed and highly competitive market 
but, with its technology sector rapidly adopting digital strategies 
and a fast-growing and healthy start-up sector, the Group’s leading 
IT recruitment brand and offshore capability has made a significant 
impact in the market. 
 
Revenue in Asia Pacific increased by 76.7% to £10.6m (2015: £6.0m) 
and gross profit increased by 47.5% to £5.9m (2015: £4.0m). The 
profit of £0.1m compares with an operating loss of £0.3m in the 
prior year. Permanent or executive placements accounted for 
65.6%, contract placements 2.3%, and offshore services 32.1% of 
gross profit.
Asia Pacific enjoyed strong growth particularly in the second half 
of the year, and benefited from demand in offshore services in 
the USA and UK. Executive search fees grew 72.0% in Hong 
Kong, Japan and the new office in Singapore resulting in an 
operating profit before the investment in Singapore. Professional 
recruitment fees in Vietnam were up 41.1% and delivered good 
business contribution growth. Gross profit from offshore services 
(software development, BPO and shared services) grew 48.2% and 
contribution 51.9% as results from the Japanese market improved. 
While Australia remained challenging throughout the year, revenues 
were up 56.3% and the loss reduced compared with the prior year.
the disposal options, the Board agreed the sale of the NT Group 
by way of a management buy-out. This transaction provided an 
exit from a non-core loss-making activity and lowered the Group’s 
financial risk profile, while retaining the upside potential of possible 
further consideration depending on the future performance of 
the NT Group. This resulted in a charge of £13.6m (2015: £0.6m) 
relating to the loss on disposal. The NT Group’s loss before tax on 
discontinued operations for the year was £0.4m (2015: £0.9m). 
United States
The USA represented 16.4% of the Group’s gross profit in 2016. 
The USA is the largest market for technology recruitment in the 
world but is fragmented and offers strong growth, particularly 
on the West Coast. The Group’s unique portfolio of technology 
recruitment is compelling in a market with severe skills shortages 
and limited competition of any scale. The Group has six offices, 
with 80 fee earners based in the USA and 45 offshore recruiters 
based in Vietnam supporting clients such as Apple and Microsoft. 
 
Permanent placements accounted for 35.6%, contract placements 
33.8%, and offshore and solutions 30.6% of gross profit. Revenue 
in the USA increased by 14.5% to £54.6m (2015: £47.7m) and 
gross profit increased by 25.4% to £14.8m (2015: £11.8m), while 
operating profit increased by 55.6% following the investment in 
fee-earning capacity in the prior year. 
The US economy was once again the strongest market across the 
Group during 2015. All services grew strongly, with demand for 
enterprise recruitment the strongest with gross profit up 79.0% in 
constant currency. Executive search also reported a record year 
with net fees up 19.0% to $3.0m mainly driven by US Fortune 
500 companies investing in digital transformation. Permanent IT 
recruitment was also strong with gross profit up 17.0% in a buoyant 
market for technology specialists. The swing from temp to perm 
affected contractor numbers but higher margins resulted in an 
overall increase in gross profit (+39.7%). Offshore and solutions 
also posted good growth of +11.3% in gross profit.

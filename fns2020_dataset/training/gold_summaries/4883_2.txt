The House Magazine, 
30
th 
anniversary This 
ﬂagship publication for 
Parliament celebrated its 
30
th 
anniversary in 2006 
with a commemorative 
edition and a reception 
held at 10 Downing Street. 
Contributors to this highly 
successful special edition 
included the Prime Minister, 
Tony Blair, and the former 
US President, Bill Clinton. 
The House Magazine 
continues to be the 
impartial forum for 
discussing issues of 
importance in policy 
and delivery. 
The Whitehall & 
Westminster World 
Awards Our leading 
newspaper for the senior 
civil service, Whitehall 
& Westminster World, 
launched its ﬁrst Awards 
event to identify and 
recognise best practice 
within the civil service. 
Working with the Cabinet 
Ofﬁce, and supported by 
Ernst & Young, the hugely 
successful Awards were 
introduced by the Cabinet 
Secretary, Sir Gus O’Donnell. 
Plans are already underway 
for our 2007 event. 
Online monitoring 
Dods has a formidable 
reputation for delivering a 
high quality, online political 
monitoring service that 
ensures people who work 
within the world of politics 
are kept informed of all 
that’s relevant. The 
acquisition and integration 
of Political Wizard has 
brought further beneﬁts 
to our customers with a 
new desktop intelligence 
service that tracks legislative 
progress and delivers 
bespoke information 
and brieﬁngs. 
The Regional Review 
During 2006, The 
Parliament Magazine 
strengthened its position 
as the primary publication 
and website for Brussels 
with the launch of The 
Regional Review. This 
new title provides an 
authoritative forum to 
examine the impact of EU 
investment in the Regions, 
enabling EU institutions 
and decision makers to 
read about regional policy 
developments and share 
best practice. 
Certifica te
 in Campaigning 
Certiﬁcate in 
Campaigning In line with 
the Government’s stated 
objective to empower and 
further train the voluntary 
sector, the Learning 
Division launched the 
Certiﬁcate in Campaigning 
for charities in partnership 
with the NCVO. This 
course was designed to 
improve the quality of 
lobbying and inﬂuencing 
in the non-proﬁt sector 
and has already received 
wide acclaim for the 
quality of its content 
and style of approach. 
Trainer Active online 
Building upon the 
extensive catalogue of 
training and development 
resources already available, 
we successfully launched 
TrainerActive.com in 2006. 
All the activities have been 
designed by professional 
trainers and are fully tried 
and tested, saving valuable 
preparation time for the 
signiﬁcant number of 
professional coaches and 
trainers that use our 
products. 
Quicker solutions 
During 2006, Epic 
designed and developed 
new software delivery 
tools in-house. These 
offer greater speed and 
efﬁciency and enable the 
Learning Division to 
respond more effectively 
to our customers’ changing 
needs and requirements. 
Amongst the many 
advantages is the capability 
to develop learning courses 
much quicker using 
predeﬁned navigation, 
screen frameworks and 
functionality. 
The Reform, Efﬁciency 
and Delivery Conference 
Following the Government’s 
announcement of several 
new initiatives to help 
drive forward reform, 
efﬁciency and delivery in 
the public sector, the 
Learning Division hosted 
a successful conference on 
the subject for senior civil 
servants and interested 
organisations. Supported 
by PWC, the conference 
offered an opportunity 
to examine how current 
reforms are working and 
discuss how improvements 
can be made going forward. 
Restructuring our business 
After three acquisitions 
in as many years (Le 
Trombinoscope, ATP-Egora 
and Les Editions Jean-
Baptiste Baillière Santé), 
we completed the merger 
and relocation of all the 
business units (originally 
more that ten) into one 
single entity, Huveaux 
France. We have delivered 
signiﬁcant synergies and 
cost savings along the way. 
Together with its 110 + 
employees, Huveaux 
France now operates out 
of one building in Paris. 
Successful magazine 
relaunches Our two 
leading titles, Panorama du 
Médecin and Le Concours 
Médical, were relaunched 
during 2006 as part of 
a promotion initiative to 
medical practitioners in 
France. Despite challenging 
conditions in the medical 
advertising market, these 
successful relaunches 
allowed us to maximise 
our revenue, increase 
market share and, most 
importantly, develop brand 
extensions that will enable 
further growth. 
Managing the evaluation 
of medical practice 
In 2006, Huveaux France 
won a contract from La 
Haute Autorité de Santé to 
develop a programme for 
managing the performance 
evaluation of medical 
practice. As a result, we 
became the ﬁrst publisher 
offering doctors the ability 
to analyse their medical 
practice in fulﬁlment of the 
new compulsory CME 
requirements. A ﬁrst such 
programme has just been 
launched with sponsorship 
from the French National 
Cancer Institute. 
www.Egora fr 
Egora.fr is the most 
important medical website 
dedicated to general 
practitioners and healthcare 
professionals in France. 
This all-in-one site provides 
online news, data, 
interactive case studies and 
a soon to be introduced 
extensive searchable 
archive. Further extensions 
into e-learning programs 
focused on the delivery 
and management of CME 
activities are also planned 
for 2007.  Huveaux PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006   03

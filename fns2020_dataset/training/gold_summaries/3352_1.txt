Chief Executive’s statement
“ Charter beneﬁted from its 
global presence, including 
its strong positions in the 
BRIC economies and 
emerging markets.”
Michael Foster
Charter’s results for 2010 were an improvement over 2009, 
with revenue, adjusted operating proﬁt and adjusted earnings 
per share all increasing. These results were achieved against  
an economic backdrop that was better than that experienced  
in 2009, but which remained varied with some regions and 
end-user segments continuing to be weak.
ESAB saw much improved revenue, adjusted operating  
proﬁt and adjusted operating margin, although its overall 
performance was held back as the welding segment  
recorded lower margins in the second half of the year and,  
as anticipated, the cutting & automation segment made an 
operating loss for the year as a whole and only returned to 
proﬁt in the second half. Howden’s performance was ahead  
of our previous expectations, with excellent contract execution 
and continued growth in its aftermarket business. It achieved 
an adjusted operating margin of 12.1 per cent, compared with 
11.4 per cent in 2009. 
In 2010, revenue was £1,719.6 million (2009: £1,659.2 million), an 
increase of 3.6 per cent and adjusted operating proﬁt was £145.9 
million (2009: £125.6 million), an increase of 16.2 per cent.
The Board considers that the best measure of the extent to 
which Charter is generating shareholder value is adjusted 
earnings per share, which excludes exceptional and other items 
considered by the Board to not directly relate to underlying 
performance. Adjusted earnings per share in the year were 
66.1 pence (2009: 55.0 pence), an increase of 20.2 per cent. 
The Board is also focused on the cash generated from 
operations which during the year amounted to £85.5 million 
(2009: £171.5 million), a reduction of 50.1 per cent, which 
reﬂects, in particular, the absorption of cash into ESAB’s 
working capital as volumes recovered. It is a strategic objective 
to tighten ESAB’s working capital whilst continuing to grow its 
revenue and proﬁt. During a period when Howden’s order book 
reduced in size, cash ﬂow from operations, at approximately  
80 per cent of operating proﬁt, continued to be excellent.
During 2010, Charter maintained investment in improving the 
effectiveness of its plants and systems. Capital expenditure was 
once again well ahead of depreciation, with the major project 
completed during the year being Howden’s new factory in 
Brazil. Investment in research and development continues to 
support future growth. ESAB made substantial improvements 
to its distribution network in Europe, completed the restructuring 
of its cutting business and more than restored the capacity 
closed during the recession. It also introduced new lines of 
consumables and equipment. Howden increased its presence 
in the important Indian power market, through entering into a 
joint venture with one of India’s leading boiler-makers, and also 
made an acquisition in Australia. 
Charter’s strategy
A key part of Charter’s strategy is to build upon the market 
leading positions both ESAB and Howden have achieved, 
which are based on brand, technology and customer service. 
ESAB and Howden are focused on serving their customers’ 
requirements, with emphasis being placed on continuing product 
development, increasing operational efﬁciency, improving 
customer service and maintaining effective cost management. 
Geographical coverage will continue to expand as strength is built 
in high growth regions. A crucial part of this will be to build upon 
our existing presence in the BRIC economies, and our approach 
will recognise the diverging requirements of different regions. 
Acquisitions are an important means of achieving our objectives, 
especially where they bring a presence in a region or technology 
that would take time and expense to build organically and 
provided they generate sufﬁcient risk-weighted return. Capital 
expenditure will be maintained at levels in excess of depreciation 
and investment in research and development and in development 
of our employees will continue. A strong balance sheet will help 
to ensure that the necessary ﬁnancial resources are available to 
achieve these goals.

Review of 2010
Economic and ﬁnancial conditions generally improved in 2010, 
as the global economy recovered from the depths of recession, 
although the recovery was uneven. 
The BRIC economies and emerging markets showed higher 
levels of growth and in some cases achieved record levels of 
output. However, across developed economies, conditions 
were patchy and more subdued. In Western Europe and North 
America, after a slow start to the year due to severe weather, 
economic conditions showed strong improvement in the ﬁrst 
half of the year, although the second half proved tougher. In 
Southern Europe, some countries continued to decline.
Within this economic environment, Charter beneﬁted from  
its global presence including its strong positions in the BRIC 
economies and emerging markets, which partly offset softer 
conditions in its markets in the developed world. Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 06
Chief Executive’s statement (continued)
The impact of the global recovery was more immediately seen in 
ESAB, which recorded higher volumes in its welding business 
despite some end-user segments such as construction, being 
ﬂat or declining. With its later cycle, Howden experienced lower 
sales of new equipment, but, partly assisted by continuing 
growth in its aftermarket business, was able to improve margins. 
ESAB
ESAB’ s results were up on 2009, as the business beneﬁted from 
an improved trading environment and the recent restructuring. 
Revenue for the year was £1,157.6 million (2009: £1,031.4 million), 
an increase of 12.2 per cent, and adjusted operating proﬁt was 
£89.3 million (2009: £66.0 million), an increase of 35.3 per cent. 
ESAB’s adjusted operating margin for the year increased to  
7.7 per cent (2009: 6.4 per cent), which reﬂected higher 
volumes. The improvement in operating margin in the ﬁrst  
half of the year was not maintained in the second half, due to 
usual seasonal factors, adverse changes in mix and, in certain 
instances mainly in Europe, increases in steel prices not being 
fully recovered through higher selling prices.
The total volumes of welding consumables sold during the year 
were 465k-tonnes (2009: 405k-tonnes), an increase of 15 per 
cent. Within this, volumes of solid welding wire increased by  
30 per cent as ESAB increased its market share in the 
recovering vehicle segment.
By comparison, the volume of electrodes, which are a higher 
margin product, only grew by 7 per cent. This was as a 
consequence of certain important users of electrodes, such as 
the general industrial and construction sectors, being less strong. 
In most European markets, electrode volumes were static or 
showed only modest growth. Those regions in which electrodes 
did show higher growth were generally emerging markets where 
selling prices and, in some cases margins, are lower. 
ESAB was able to deliver higher volumes of welding wire by 
re-commissioning certain equipment capacity that had been 
taken out of service during the recession, and by making 
selective additions to capacity where necessary to alleviate 
potential shortages. ESAB also out-sourced the production  
of certain types of welding wire. 
Revenue from sales of standard equipment increased by  
28 per cent as volumes beneﬁted from higher levels of steel 
consumption, and also from a new range of equipment 
introduced during the year. There was a particularly strong 
performance in South America, with other regions, including 
Europe and North America, starting to show improvement as 
the year progressed. 
ESAB’s overall proﬁtability was also constrained by the cutting 
& automation segment, which suffered from low new 
equipment sales during the year, as traditional customers, such 
as shipbuilding, remained depressed and as the wind energy 
industry, which had been an important customer of the 
automation business in 2009, faced increased uncertainty. 
Having recorded a loss in the ﬁrst half of the year the segment’s 
ﬁnancial performance improved during the second half, as the

“ In 2010, ESAB’s revenue 
and operating proﬁt  
were up on 2009, and  
the adjusted operating 
margin increased to  
7 .7 per cent. We expect 
higher consumables 
volumes in 2011 with 
strong growth in 
emerging markets.”
World Trade Center
ESAB has been chosen to supply the welding 
consumables for Tower 1 (107 stories) and Tower 4  
(65 stories) at the World Trade Center complex, which  
is under construction in New York. A wide range of 
ESAB’s welding consumables are being used including 
ESAB’s Seismic Certified products which were 
specifically developed for the construction of this  
type of building.
restructuring measures completed during the year delivered 
cost savings and as aftermarket revenues increased. As 
anticipated, by the year-end the segment had returned to 
proﬁtability and higher levels of enquiries and order intake 
suggest that this improvement will be sustained into 2011. 
Howden
As anticipated, Howden recorded reduced revenue and proﬁt as 
the impact of lower orders placed during 2009 came through. In 
2010, revenue was £562.0 million (2009: £627.8 million) and 
adjusted operating proﬁt was £67.8 million (2009: £71.5 million), 
representing decreases of 10.5 and 5.2 per cent respectively.
Howden’s adjusted operating margin was 12.1 per cent  
(2009: 11.4 per cent), an increase of 0.7 percentage points,  
as a result of increased higher-margin aftermarket revenues  
and strong contract execution. 
Revenue from the sale of new equipment was £358.0 million 
(2009: £438.6 million), a reduction of 18.4 per cent, which 
reﬂected lower sales of new equipment into the coal-ﬁred 
power generation industry of £137 million, which represented 
24 per cent of Howden’s revenue for the year. This proportion  
is much reduced from previous years, also reﬂecting Howden’s 
strategic success in diversifying its business. Slightly over half 
of sales of new equipment into the coal-ﬁred power generation 
industry arose in China and other emerging markets.
Howden’s aftermarket revenues continued to grow as planned 
and increased by 8 per cent to £204 million, representing  
36 per cent of Howden’s total revenues, with a particularly strong 
performance in China. The aftermarket business accounted for 
nearly one-half of the total gross proﬁt generated by Howden. 
Howden’s compressor business continued to make progress, 
and accounted for around 15 per cent of Howden’s total 
revenue, a proportion which has risen steadily in recent years.  
A signiﬁcant order was won to supply compressors to the 
coal-bed methane industry in Australia, and Howden is aiming 
to establish itself as the leader in this high-potential market. 
Also during the year, Howden continued its expansion in 
emerging and resource rich markets. A joint venture was formed 
with Larsen & Toubro, the major Indian engineering group with a 
view to taking about 30 per cent of the market in supplying fans 
and heaters to the rapidly growing coal-ﬁred power industry in 
India. Howden also commissioned its new manufacturing facility 
in Brazil during the year and acquired AustCold, a compressor 
packaging company located in Australia.
Order intake during the year was £533 million (2009: £503 
million), an increase of 6.0 per cent. Particular features were the 
recovery in orders from customers in the power industry in China 
and the much higher level of orders from India, reﬂecting 
Howden’s enhanced market presence. As anticipated, order  Charter International plc
Annual Report 2010 08
Chief Executive’s statement (continued)
intake from the power industry in Europe and North America 
remained at relatively subdued levels. During 2010, the order 
book again proved to be robust, with minimal order cancellations. 
The level of order intake increased towards the end of the year, 
positioning Howden well for 2011.
At 31 December 2010, Howden’s order book was £424 million, 
of which £331 million is scheduled for delivery in 2011 and  
£93 million thereafter. Customers in emerging markets  
account for 60 per cent of Howden’s order book.
Balance sheet and cash ﬂow
As at 31 December 2010, shareholders’ funds were £635.7 
million (2009: £549.9 million), an increase of 15.6 per cent. 
At that date, Charter had net cash balances of £1.8 million (2009: 
£50.9 million), representing a net outﬂow of £49.1 million during 
the year. Cash inﬂow from operations was £85.5 million (2009: 
£171.5 million), a reduction of 50 per cent, primarily reﬂecting  
the absorption of cash into ESAB’s working capital as turnover 
increased. Other major outﬂows of cash were capital expenditure 
and capitalised development costs (£62.1 million, representing 
173 per cent of associated depreciation and amortisation), 
taxation (£36.5 million) and dividends (£36.7 million). 
The Company will seek to maintain its strong ﬁnancial position 
as it continues to invest in both businesses and looks to grow 
through acquisitions. 
2011 outlook
Looking forwards into 2011, further recovery in the macro-
economic environment is expected, although, as in 2010, this  
is unlikely to be smooth or uniform across regions and end-user 
industries. For Europe, which remains Charter’s most important 
region in terms of proﬁt generation, economic growth is 
expected to average no more than 1 per cent across the 
region, with Germany and Central Europe performing above 
average but Southern Europe stagnating or declining further. 
The BRIC economies and emerging markets will generate 
stronger growth. Commodity price inﬂation and government 
deﬁcits are amongst the principal threats to economic recovery 
and ﬁnancial stability.
ESAB
Early indications suggest that the general trends seen in the 
second half of 2010 have continued into early 2011. 
For the year as a whole, we expect higher consumables 
volumes compared to 2010, with strong growth in emerging 
markets but with a subdued performance in ESAB’s important 
European markets where growth is likely to be lower than it  
was in 2010. Growth will be stronger in solid welding wire  
as the vehicle segment remains strong. Construction and 
infrastructure markets in Europe will be slower to recover 
“ In 2010, Howden’s 
performance was ahead 
of previous expectations 
with excellent contract 
execution and continued 
aftermarket growth. We 
expect to see progressive 
improvement in 201 1 and 
onwards.”
Coal bed methane
Howden has been awarded a contract to supply 72 of  
its largest rotary twin screw compressors for a major  
coal bed methane project in Queensland, Australia.  
The compressors will be used to gather and compress 
coal bed methane which will then be converted to LNG 
and exported. Howden believes that there will be 
significant further opportunities for it to supply its 
compressors into other coal bed methane projects  
in Australia and elsewhere. Charter International plc

against the background of government austerity measures 
leading to reduced infrastructure investment. Overall, we expect 
markets to continue to strengthen but in a two-speed world 
with higher growth rates in BRIC and emerging markets and 
slower growth in developed markets, particularly Europe. 
Assuming the world economy continues to strengthen, market 
growth should be stronger in the second half of the year. 
Against this background, ESAB will beneﬁt from the continuing 
measures undertaken to improve its business, including new 
ranges of welding consumables and standard equipment, a 
much improved distribution network in Europe and a 
rationalised manufacturing footprint. The continued expansion 
into new geographies will enhance ESAB’s presence in 
emerging markets.
The cutting & automation segment returned to proﬁt in the 
second half of 2010 and we are looking forward to an improved 
result in 2011. Cutting has started the year with a positive trend 
in orders. In automation, the prospects are very strong and it is 
expected that customers will start placing orders by mid-year.
As importantly, ESAB will continue to re-position itself to be 
more customer focused, with a number of projects underway 
throughout the business aimed at simplifying the ways in which 
ESAB deals with its customers. ESAB has established business 
teams focused on particular regions, industries or processes. 
ESAB’s LEAN initiatives form a crucial part of the process to 
deliver consistent operational excellence and ‘best in class’ cost. 
Investment will continue in ESAB’s future development, with 
capital expenditure expected to remain in excess of depreciation. 
Additions to capacity will be selective and will support clear 
market opportunities. New products and leading edge product 
service offering will continue to be brought to market.
Howden
Overall, the year should improve progressively, with stronger 
economic activity in the second half particularly in the BRIC 
economies. We believe that Howden’s trading bottomed out 
during 2010 and that, in 2011 and onwards, we will start to see 
progressive improvement. In January 2011, Howden booked 
orders in excess of £70 million, taking the order book at the 
end of the month to over £470 million.
Howden is now a genuinely global company, with over half its 
revenues in emerging markets. The proportion derived from 
emerging markets is expected to progressively increase. 
The coal-ﬁred power industry remains Howden’s largest 
customer, although as Howden continues its diversiﬁcation,  
its relative importance will continue to reduce. Signiﬁcant new 
build programmes are expected to continue well into the  
future in China, India and South Africa, where Howden is well 
positioned. Russia will develop in the next few years and we 
have agreed in principle to enter into a joint venture with a 
leading supplier of equipment to the Russian power industry. 
Whilst we expect little new build in developed economies, the 
prospects for further installations of emission control equipment 
in the USA are improving. 
Howden has successfully grown its compressor business and 
is expected to continue to do so in 2011, as the high oil price 
encourages more capital expenditure in the energy industry, 
and as Howden continues to develop further applications  
for its compressors, with coal-bed methane being the 
outstanding example. 
Aftermarket growth of around 10 per cent continues to be 
expected, beneﬁting in particular from the Howden equipment 
installed in China in recent years. The aftermarket business  
is expected to continue to contribute around one-half of 
Howden’s gross proﬁt in the next few years. 
Howden’s pursuit of these opportunities will be supported by  
it maintaining its commitment to technological leadership and 
engineering excellence. Product development programmes are 
actively focused to enable the available market, particularly in 
compressors, to increase signiﬁcantly.
Concluding comments
In 2010, there was a recovery from the effects of the global 
recession. Whilst a number of regions and segments rebounded 
quickly, others, including some which are important to ESAB or 
Howden, remained at levels of activity well below those seen 
before the on-set of the recession. Against this background,  
we believe that both ESAB and Howden performed well. 
Despite the continuing economic uncertainties in Europe, 
further progress in 2011 is expected as a result of the on-going 
investment and improvements made in both businesses, with  
a faster pace in emerging markets. 
For the longer term, our conﬁdence in Charter’s ability to 
generate additional shareholder value is high. ESAB and 
Howden both have established strong market positions, spread 
across developed and emerging economies, which will beneﬁt 
from the rising demand for energy and increasing steel usage 
foreseen over the coming years.

We use a variety of ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial measures to assess 
the performance of our business.
During the year under review, the Company focused on the adjusted operating  
margin of both ESAB and Howden rather than on revenue as a key ﬁnancial  
measure as it believes that this measure provides greater visibility of the Company’s  
overall performance.
Adjusted operating proﬁt
Adjusted operating proﬁt measures the 
success we are having at increasing 
revenues net of increases in the cost  
of employees, goods and other services 
which we are incurring. We adjust operating 
proﬁt to exclude the impact of unusual or 
non-recurring items, such as restructuring 
costs, which we believe is appropriate to give 
a truer picture of underlying performance.
Performance
In 2010, adjusted operating proﬁt increased 
compared with 2009, as ESAB recovered 
well from the generally difﬁcult trading 
conditions which it encountered in 2009, 
whilst Howden’s proﬁt fell slightly.
Adjusted operating margin – ESAB
Adjusted operating margin measures the rate 
at which revenue changed relative to the rate 
at which adjusted operating proﬁt changed. 
Movements in ESAB’s margins reﬂect the 
cyclical nature of its business, longer term 
trends and also action taken to eliminate 
costs in 2009 as volumes and revenue fell. 
Performance
In 2010, ESAB’s adjusted operating margin 
was 7.7 per cent, which compares with 6.4 
per cent in 2009 and a recent high of 13.1 
per cent in 2007. We believe that, through  
the business cycle, ESAB is capable of 
generating an adjusted operating margin  
in excess of 10 per cent.
Adjusted operating margin – Howden
In recent years, Howden’s margins have 
been comparatively stable, reﬂecting the 
less cyclical nature of its business and 
Howden’s success at diversifying its 
business.  
 
Performance
In 2010, Howden’s adjusted operating  
margin was 12.1 per cent. We envisage 
Howden’s adjusted operating margin  
being between 11 and 12 per cent for  
the foreseeable future.
 
 
Howden order book
Howden’s order book gives good visibility of 
new equipment sales and also gross margin 
for the following 12 to 18 months. Movements 
in the order book can be used as a leading 
indicator of Howden’s performance relative  
to the market, and also to manage changes 
in capacity levels. 
Performance
At 31 December 2010, Howden’s order  
book stood at £424 million, compared with  
£441 million at 31 December 2009. The 
impact of this modest fall on the outlook for 
Howden’s business in 2011 is reduced by the 
expectation of further growth in aftermarket 
revenues.
Cash ﬂow from operations
We monitor cash ﬂow from operations, but  
in doing so, we set targets which recognise 
that, as businesses grow, they tend to 
absorb cash into working capital. Our 
measure of cash ﬂow from operations takes 
into account certain non-recurring items 
including expenditure on restructuring. 
 
Performance
During 2010, the amount of cash generated 
from operations fell as the recovery in ESAB’s 
business led to absorption of cash into 
working capital. It is a strategic objective  
to tighten ESAB’s working capital whilst 
continuing to grow its revenue and proﬁt.
Howden’s cash generation was in line  
with its adjusted operating proﬁt.  Charter International plc

Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share shows the  
net proﬁt generated for shareholders in an 
accounting period, after taking into account 
ﬁnancing and tax. The measure is deﬁned so 
as to exclude exceptional charges or income 
and other items considered by the Board to 
be not directly related to the underlying 
performance of our businesses. 
Performance
In 2010, adjusted earnings per share were 
66.1 pence, an increase of 20 per cent 
compared with 2009. Adjusted earnings  
per share increased strongly between 2006 
and 2008 but fell in 2009.
 
Equity shareholders’ funds
Equity shareholders’ funds reﬂect the value  
of net assets available to shareholders, and 
an increase in this measure means that 
Charter’s balance sheet and ﬁnancial  
position are strengthening.
Performance
As at 31 December 2010, equity 
shareholders’ funds stood at £635.7 million. 
Charter’s balance sheet has strengthened 
considerably over the last ﬁve years, with 
equity shareholders’ funds having more  
than doubled without any signiﬁcant  
issues of new shares.
Capital expenditure
The absolute level of capital expenditure and 
its relationship to the depreciation charge are 
indications of the extent to which Charter is 
maintaining and increasing in the productive 
capacity of its businesses.
Performance
Capital expenditure in 2010 was £62.5 million, 
representing 174 per cent of associated 
depreciation. It is estimated that capital 
expenditure needs to be at least 110 per cent 
of depreciation in order to maintain a steady 
state. Capital expenditure has been higher in 
ESAB than in Howden, reﬂecting in part their 
respective business models and relative sizes.
Research and development expenditure
Charter recognises that its technology is an 
important factor in maintaining the leadership 
of its products in the competitive markets in 
which it operates. Research and development 
expenditure is written off as incurred, except 
that certain development expenditure is 
capitalised as required by IAS 38.
Performance
Research and development expenditure has 
increased throughout the period. The majority 
of this expenditure has been in ESAB. Howden 
engineers bespoke solutions for particular 
customers’ air and gas handling requirements 
but this expenditure is generally not classiﬁed 
as ‘research and development’.
Lost time injury frequency rate
Charter recognises that ﬁnancial performance 
is not a sufﬁcient measure on its own. We 
operate in heavy engineering environments 
where there is considerable inherent risk and 
the safety of our employees is a key priority. 
We use a variety of measures, including  
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’),  
to assess the effectiveness of our health  
and safety performance.
Performance
LTIFR fell by over one-half during the  
period from 2007 to 2010 in which data has 
been systematically collected and veriﬁed, 
underlining Charter’s commitment to 
employee welfare. Further information on  
our health and safety performance is set  
out in the Corporate responsibility report  
on pages 30 to 35.

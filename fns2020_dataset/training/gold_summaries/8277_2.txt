	 Financial calendar, Contacts and Forward-looking statements	 129
Both the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements 2011 and the Annual Review and 
Summary Financial Statement 2011 contain 
certain forward-looking statements as defined 
under US legislation (Section 21E of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect  
to the financial condition, results of operations 
and business of InterContinental Hotels Group 
and certain plans and objectives of the Board of 
Directors of InterContinental Hotels Group PLC 
with respect thereto. Such statements include, 
but are not limited to, statements made in the 
Chairman’s statement and in the Chief 
Executive’s review. These forward-looking 
statements can be identified by the fact that they 
do not relate only to historical or current facts. 
Forward-looking statements often use words 
such as ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, ‘expect’, ‘estimate’, 
‘intend’, ‘plan’, ‘goal’, ‘believe’, or other words of 
similar meaning. These statements are based  
on assumptions and assessments made by 
InterContinental Hotels Group’s management in 
light of their experience and their perception of 
historical trends, current conditions, expected 
future developments and other factors they 
believe to be appropriate. 
By their nature, forward-looking statements  
are inherently predictive, speculative and involve 
risk and uncertainty. There are a number of 
factors that could cause actual results and 
developments to differ materially from those 
expressed in, or implied by, such forward-
looking statements, including, but not limited to: 
the risks involved with the Group’s reliance on 
the reputation of its brands and the protection of 
its intellectual property rights; the risks related 
to identifying, securing and retaining franchise 
and management agreements; the risks of the 
effect of political and economic developments; 
the ability to acquire and retain the right people 
and skills and capability to manage growth and 
change; the risk of events that adversely impact 
domestic or international travel; the risks 
involved in the Group’s reliance upon its 
proprietary reservations system and increased 
competition in reservations infrastructure;  
the risks in relation to changing technology and 
systems; the risks of the hotel industry supply 
and demand cycle; the risks related to corporate 
responsibility; the risk of litigation; the risks 
associated with the Group’s ability to maintain 
adequate insurance; the risks associated with 
the Group’s financial stability and its ability to 
borrow and satisfy debt covenants; compliance 
with existing and changing regulations across 
numerous countries, territories and 
jurisdictions; the risks related to information 
security; and the risks associated with funding 
the defined benefits under its pension plans.
The main factors that could affect the business 
and financial results are described in the 
Business review of the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2011 and also in the 
Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F.

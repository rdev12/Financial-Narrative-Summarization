 	 2006 	was 	the 	end 	of 	one 	era 	and 	the 	beginning 	of 	another 	for 	AMEC. 	We 	said	 farewell	to 	one 	chief 	executive 	and 	welcomed 	another , 	sold 	a 	major 	business	 while	laying 	plans 	for 	future 	investment 	and 	decided 	to 	exit 	former 	important	 markets	in 	order 	to 	focus 	on 	our 	growing 	core 	businesses. 	As 	we 	start 	2007 ,	 AMEC	is 	making 	good 	progress 	as 	it 	executes 	its 	new 	strategy.
This	transition 	has 	taken 	place 	in 	a 	demanding 	time 	frame. 	In 	November	 2005,	we 	announced 	our 	plans 	to 	review 	strategy, 	in 	particular 	that 	we 	would	 dispose	of 	AMEC 	SPIE, 	which 	we 	successfully 	completed 	in 	July 	2006,	 producing	an 	excellent 	return 	on 	our 	investment.	 In	August 	2006, 	we 	announced 	the 	appointment 	of 	our 	new 	chief 	executive,	 Samir	Brikho, 	who 	took 	over 	from 	Sir 	Peter 	Mason 	in 	October . 	By 	the 	year 	end,	 Samir	had 	announced 	his 	strategy, 	begun 	to 	prepare 	for 	the 	sale 	of 	the 	Built	 Environment	businesses 	and 	put 	in 	place 	a 	major 	cost 	cutting 	programme	 to	make 	AMEC 	substantially 	leaner 	and 	fitter 	than 	it 	was 	previously. 	These	 announcements	received 	widespread 	investor 	support. 	At 	the 	same 	time,	 he	successfully 	defended 	the 	company 	against 	an 	approach 	from 	a 	private	 equity	consortium, 	which 	the 	board 	felt 	undervalued 	our 	business.
2006	marked 	the 	 beginning	 of	a 	 new era	for 	 AMEC

that	our	recruitment	exercise	identified	the	right	man	to	take	AMEC	forward.	
He	has	already	laid	the	foundations	for	the	group’s	future	growth	and	success	
and	we	can	expect	to	see	the	new	AMEC	well	established	by	the	end	of	the	
current	year .	
During	2006,	we	said	farewell	to	Sir	Peter	Mason,	who	left	the	company	in	
October	2006,	his	official	retirement	date.	Sir	Peter	played	a	pivotal	role	in	
AMEC’s	development	over	the	last	decade	and	indeed	instigated	the	reshaping	
of	the	group	away	from	its	traditional	construction	markets.	Jean	Monville,	
who	led	AMEC	SPIE	and	was	an	influential	and	much	valued	presence	on	
the	board,	and	Jean-Paul	Jacamon,	another	valued	director ,	left	the	board	
following	the	AMEC	SPIE	sale.	It	was	announced	with	our	2006	results,	
that	James	Dallas	would	retire	from	the	board	after	the	annual	general	
meeting	on	16	May	of	this	year .	James	originally	intended	to	serve	two	terms	
only,	but	he	agreed	to	stay	on	through	a	period	of	major	change	for	which	we	
are	grateful.	On	behalf	of	the	board,	I	would	like	to	thank	all	of	them	for	their	
important	contributions	to	AMEC.
Results	for	2006	were	very	much	as	expected	in	December	2006.	Adjusted	profit 	 from	continuing	operations	of	£64.7	million	was	below	both	2005	(£73.9	million)	
and	original	expectations	for	the	year .	The	loss	before		income	tax	was	
£108.8	million	(2005:	£17 .7	million).	However ,	there	was	a	profit	from	discontinued 	 operations	of	£319.1	million.	Strong	performance	in	Natural	Resources 	and	
Earth	and	Environmental,	together	with	a	substantial	profit	from	the	sale	
of	a	PPP	asset	during	the	year ,	was	not	sufficient	to	offset	reduced	profit	
in	Power 	and	Process	and	continued	Construction	losses.
We	are	confident	about	2007	and	the	future	given	the	strength	in	our	core	
markets	and	the	intense	efforts	being	directed	to	achieving	significant	
reductions	in	cost	and	improved	margin	in	each	of	our	businesses.	This	is	
reflected	in	proposed	dividends	for	the	year ,	which	are	increased	by	6	per	cent	
to	12.2	pence	(2005:	1 1.5	pence).
AMEC	has	a	clear	vision	and	new	strategy	focused	on	providing	value-added	
engineering	services	to	its	core	energy	and	process	clients	worldwide.	
We	have	put	in	place	plans	to	turn	around,	and	will	divest,	the	UK	Construction	
business,	putting	a	stop	to	the	losses	that	have	damaged	AMEC’s	performance	
in	recent	years.	This,	together	with	the	divestment	of	our	profitable	Investments	
and	Building	and	Facilities	Services	businesses,	will	refocus	the	group	
and	increase	resources	available	to	invest	in	the	core	businesses.
Looking	further	ahead,	our	core	markets	are	strong,	and	I	am	confident	
that	the	new	AMEC	will	achieve	its	margin	targets	of	6	per	cent	in	2008	and	
8	per	cent	in	2010,	delivering	performance	and	value.

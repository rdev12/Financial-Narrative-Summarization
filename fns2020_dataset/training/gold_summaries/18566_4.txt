 The secure solutions business covers a wide range of services, including:
Risk services and consultancy
Monitoring and response 
Secure facilities management services 
Manned and mobile security services
Security and facilities management 
(FM) services is by far the largest 
business segment in G4S, representing 
58% of group revenues. The 84 
markets in which we provide these 
services are usually highly fragmented. 
Our competitors are typically smaller 
local and regional companies, although 
we do compete with international 
companies in some countries and  
in some markets we compete with 
facilities management companies. 
Competition is intense in manned 
security and FM and customers  
can be extremely price sensitive.
We position G4S as a high quality, 
global security service provider  
with the skills, expertise and market 
coverage to offer our customers 
integrated, cost effective and 
innovative security solutions  
that protect or add value to  
their organisations. 
Security systems and technology 
represented around 8% of group 
revenue in 2015.
The global security systems market 
is a large and growing market, but 
regional markets vary widely in 
terms of competition, products  
and services sold and customer 
segments. Our technology strategy 
seeks to market core products  
and services that are increasingly 
developed globally and configured 
locally to meet each region’s  
unique requirements. 
In our security systems service line 
we compete against fire and alarm 
system manufacturers, installers  
and security systems integrators.
We promote outsourcing and 
enhance the value of traditional 
security services through greater  
use of technology (see page 23).

G4S AT A 
GLANCE
We differentiate the G4S brand  
by investing in service innovation, 
employee selection, training, 
supervision, service delivery and 
customer service and relationship 
management. 
Our manned security customer  
base is a valuable intangible asset. 
We have historically had little 
cross-selling in our secure solutions 
business segment and an important 
long-term element of our strategy  
is to offer our broad range of 
services on a stand-alone basis or  
in conjunction with other services  
to provide customers with an 
integrated and more valuable 
security solution – see the case 
study and chart on pages 30 and  
31. This offers the opportunity to 
increase customer longevity and 
grow our margins. We have begun 
to improve our cross-selling in the 
USA, UK, Middle East and Europe 
and will continue to focus on this  
in 2016 and into the future.
* Includes 44,000 employees in businesses to be sold or exited.

Cash management outsourcing
Cash consulting

Based mainly in the UK, G4S offers  
a range of outsourcing services, which 
together accounted for around 11%  
of group revenues in 2015. These 
services include back office support 
and custody suites to UK police forces 
and utility services (data collection  
and smart meter programmes). 
We also manage welfare to work 
programmes in the UK and to date 
have helped 58,000 people find 
employment. These are specialist 
services and there tend to be just a 
small number of private companies 
providing similar services in the UK. 
We aim to offer innovative  
and cost-effective solutions to 
customers, leveraging our scale  
and expertise.
Care and justice services 
represented around 9% of group 
revenue in 2015. The market 
structure is typically consolidated on 
the supply side with a small number 
of providers. Larger companies are 
usually better equipped to deliver 
such highly specialised services. G4S 
will only offer custody and detention 
services where we can maintain  
a qualified talent pool and where 
the political, legal, human rights and 
regulatory framework is consistent 
with our group values and results in 
acceptable operational, commercial 
and reputational risk.
G4S’s larger scale care and justice 
services are concentrated primarily  
in the UK and Australia, and on  
a smaller scale in a number of 
European markets. For more  
detail see page 34.

The cash solutions business accounted for around  
14% of group revenue in 2015. We are the market 
leader or number two in 43 of our 48 cash solutions 
markets. The main providers of similar services are  
a small number of international competitors in mainly 
developed markets. Wherever possible our cash 
solutions business shares facilities and back office 
processes with our secure solutions businesses. The 
market is highly regulated, often by central banks,  
and the business requires complex infrastructure and 
significant expertise. Our strategy assumes that digital 
payment technology will continue to grow in developed 
markets and gain traction in emerging markets in the 
medium term. For more information see page 32.
We aim to:
• position G4S as a reliable, innovative low cost 
operator that helps our customers to reduce  
their cash handling costs and increase the ease  
of use of cash for their customers
• play a key role in the management of the cash cycle 
on behalf of central banks, commercial banks and 
retailers, allowing them to focus on their core business
• use our developed market cash cycle expertise and 
track record to encourage central bank and financial 
institution outsourcing in emerging markets
• continue the expansion of innovative technology  
such as CASH360™/ Retail Solutions for retail 
customers (see page 32).

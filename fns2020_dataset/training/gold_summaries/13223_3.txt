 Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007_ 3
Chairman’s statement
We remain focused on growth
I am pleased to report that Regus has delivered another year of record results
this year, surpassing £100 million of post-tax earnings for the ﬁrst time.
The business model continues to work well
with proﬁtability growth from our mature sites
and recent expansions driving our ability to both
return cash to stakeholders as well as invest in
further capacity growth.
In the year to 31 December 2007 we grew
our average available workstations by 23.9%.
At the same time as increasing capacity we
have also returned £20.6 million to shareholders
and still increased our net cash balance from
£23.4 million to £101.4 million.
Financial performance
Group revenue has increased by 26.8% to
£862.4 million and gross proﬁt by 36.8% to
£251.9 million. Excluding the impact of new
centre growth the “like for like” improvement
was 7.0% and 20.9% respectively. This overall
result was driven by average occupancy
increasing to 82.7% from 81.8% in 2006 and
revenue per available workstation (“REVPAW”)
increasing 2.3% from £6,340 to £6,487.
Earnings (proﬁt after tax) grew by 25.9% to
£103.6 million and basic earnings per share
increased by 25.0% to 10.5p.
Sustaining growth
Our strategic expansion remains a controlled
blend of organic growth and carefully targeted
acquisitions. During the ﬁnancial year, we
opened 146 centres for a total investment
of £68.7 million.
Looking forward we expect to be able to
continue this balanced expansion programme.
Dividend
Given this strong performance the Board is
recommending a 67% increase in the total
dividend per share to 1.0p for the year.
Subject to the approval of shareholders at the
2008 AGM, this ﬁnal dividend will be paid on
30 May 2008 to shareholders on the register
at the close of business on 2 May 2008.
Our stakeholders
The Group recognises its economic, social
and environmental impacts on society through
its operations and interaction with all key
stakeholders, including our investors,
customers, landlords, suppliers and employees.
Accordingly, we continue to be focused on,
and committed to, managing our business in
a responsible and positive manner to address
these impacts. Critical to achieving this will
be our people, who continue to play a pivotal
role in delivering our goals and ensuring our
customers experience continually high
standards. I personally want to extend my
thanks to all of our staff for their continued
commitment and efforts throughout 2007.
Looking forward
While clearly aware of potential adverse market
conditions we believe our business model is
capable of delivering further proﬁtable growth
in 2008.

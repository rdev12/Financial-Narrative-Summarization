Rose Group is an established real estate developer focused on the premium economy 
residential market in Moscow.
We have been successfully creating new markets in Moscow real estate since 1993. The Company’s 
innovative drive played a key role in the transformation of Moscow’s Golden Mile in the 1990s, 
when new landmark buildings were constructed that set the benchmark for modern living and 
working spaces in the rapidly changing Russian capital. Today the Company is focused on serving 
Moscow’s growing middle class by building aspirational, design led, residential communities. Its 
pioneering Microgorod «V Lesu» project has set new standards for the Moscow residential sector by 
offering homebuyers a well configured development, with good facilities and apartments finished 
to a high quality. 
In addition to its distinctive residential properties, Rose Group developed, owns and operates 
Tsvetnoy Central Market, Moscow’s first iconic department store on Tsvetnoy Boulevard. The 
Company is listed on the LSE’s AIM market and has significant land holdings in central Moscow.

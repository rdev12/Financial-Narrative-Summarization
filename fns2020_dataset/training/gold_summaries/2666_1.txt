Co-CEO’s review
We have provided a detailed review of 
the operational performance in 2011 and 
our progress on integrating bwin and 
PartyGaming. In addition, we have set 
out our business strategy, achievements 
against that strategy to-date and our 
objectives for 2012.
We made excellent progress in 2011. 
The swift execution of a number of 
integration plans for our technology, 
people, products and brands has been 
rewarded with financial synergies 
coming through more quickly than 
expected, offsetting increased gaming 
duties payable as markets regulate. 
We remain on-track to deliver 
approximately €40m of synergies 
this year and €65m in 2013. 
2011 results
The Group’s robust operating 
performance in 2011 is confirmation of 
our progress. Despite the operational 
challenges of integrating two 
businesses in such a dynamic business 
environment, the Group delivered total 
pro forma revenue from Continuing 
operations of €816.0m (2010: €814.0m) 
and pro forma Clean EBITDA from 
Continuing operations of €199.3m 
(2010: €193.2m). However, the financial 
numbers do not tell the whole story: a 
simple comparison of the year-on-year 
financial performance appears to show 
modest growth on both metrics, but, 
as explained in our ‘Review of 2011’, 
this belies the transformation of our 
business, an increasing proportion 
of which is now licensed, regulated 
and taxed. 
As more governments embrace the 
regulation of online gaming markets, 
so the dynamics of our industry are 
shifting. Real money and social gaming 
together with other forms of digital 
entertainment are converging. 
At the same time mobile platforms 
are increasingly important channels of 
distribution – each of these developments 
is being driven by advances in technology, 
new regulations and changes in 
consumer demand.

Co-CEO’s review
Integration
The integration process touched 
upon each of our core assets in 2011: 
our people, technology, products 
and brands.
People 
Following completion, our first step 
was to appoint the members of the 
senior management team, each 
with responsibility for leading the 
integration of their respective 
disciplines and designing and 
implementing an organisation 
structure to deliver the business 
strategy and synergies already 
identified. We reorganised the business 
into four product verticals so that all 
personnel, so far as practicable, are 
allocated to one of the verticals. This 
structure should help us maintain our 
leadership position in each vertical 
which is now able to allocate its own 
development and financial resources 
to execute its plans. Following some 
initial adjustments, the target 
organisation structure was completed 
in the fourth quarter of 2011. Aligning 
business processes and controls is an 
ongoing task but just 12 months after 
completion, the majority of our internal 
procedures are already up and running. 
With employees located on three 
continents, differences of language and 
culture posed additional challenges as 
we executed the integration plan and 
continued to drive the business 
forward. Thanks to the direction and 
diligence of our dedicated Integration 
Management Office and the enormous 
efforts of our management and 
employees, we are delivering on 
our plans.
Technology
One advantage of the long lead-time 
between the merger announcement 
on 29 July 2010 and completion on 
31 March 2011 was that we had several 
months to plan the integration, 
including the assessment of our 
technology needs. Having two of 
everything it was clear that choosing 
one technology platform for each task 
would release resources and generate 
value. This was challenging for the 
senior team given the implications for 
our staff and key locations. Drafting the 
technology roadmap was relatively 
straightforward compared with the 
complexity of moving from two systems 
to a unified back-office platform, as well 
as having a single gaming platform for 
each of the product verticals. This was 
complicated further by the introduction 
of new regulated markets such as 
Denmark and Spain, that each have 
different technology requirements. 
Although these interruptions delayed 
the integration of our technology 
platforms, we expect to move to a single 
e-gaming platform by the end of 2012 
and deliver the €40m of synergies as 
previously announced. A further €25m 
of synergies are expected in 2013.

Products and brands
Choosing bwin as our lead brand for 
sports betting was obvious given its 
leading presence across Europe. 
Choosing PartyPoker as our lead poker 
brand was also straightforward given 
its brand strength not just in existing 
markets across Europe, but also 
potential new markets, such as the 
United States. Notwithstanding this, 
we will also continue to offer bwinPoker 
across all key markets and intend to 
continue to make full use of the World 
Poker Tour (‘WPT’). In Italy we will 
continue to use GD Poker. In casino, 
as a large proportion of our customers 
continue to come from poker and 
sports betting, we will continue to 
offer games through both bwin and 
PartyPoker, as well as the industry-
leading PartyCasino brand. We believe 
that the quality of the product offering 
in casino is key and so have continued 
to add new games to our suite using our 
in-house development team as well as 
through selective licensing deals with 
third parties. Bingo remains a localised 
product and Foxy Bingo and Cheeky 
Bingo will remain our core brands in 
the UK and Gioco Digitale in Italy. As we 
move into new markets we will launch 
additional bingo brands that will be 
tailored for local tastes.
Market environment
We believe that the underlying drivers 
of revenue growth in the online gaming 
sector remain strong: the increasing 
prevalence of broadband; growth in 
smartphone and tablet technology; 
an expanding population of online 
consumers with an increasing 
propensity to socialise, transact and 
play games online; and a growing 
acceptance that gaming online is 
a mainstream activity, one that can and 
should be regulated (see ‘Spotlight on: 
our business environment’ on pages 
6 to 7). While these long-term drivers 
remain, shifts in the regulatory, 
competitive as well as technological 
landscapes can and already have had a 
significant impact on the online gaming 
market in the short-term. 
Regulation
A number of national developments 
took place in 2011, most of which 
represented a further positive step 
in the transition from an embryonic 
unregulated activity just a few years 
ago into one that is increasingly 
becoming fully licensed and regulated. 
While this transition brings additional 
compliance costs and gaming taxes, 
it is also likely to prompt industry 
consolidation as consumers gravitate 
to the larger operators and brands. 
Germany (22% of pro forma net 
gaming revenue in 2011)
3
In April 2011, 15 out of the 16 German 
states or Länder, put forward a proposal 
for a new regulatory framework. While 
it proposed to regulate, license and tax 
online sports betting for the first time, 
it proposed to do so in a very restrictive 
way that was not compliant with EU 
law. Following criticism from the 
European Commission, the draft was 
amended in December 2011 but 
remains highly restrictive. Limited to 
sports betting only it includes a de facto 
ban on live betting, limits on the stakes 
wagered in any month and a maximum 
of 20 licensees. We believe this revised 
proposal also fails to meet the 
requirements of EU law. Having been 
asked by the Länder for a ‘green light’ 
to proceed with the proposals, the 
European Commission issued a 
response on 20 March 2012 stating that 
the Länder needed to provide detailed 
evidence in order for the Commission to 
assess whether or not the restrictions 
embodied within the draft State Treaty 
comply with EU law. The Commission 
was also unable to assess the 
consistency and coherence of the 
proposals due to a lack of notification 
of federal legislation amending the 
rules for slot machines and horse race 
betting. In the absence of such 
notifications and evidence, the 
Commission did not give the Länder the 
‘green light’ they required to proceed. 
Meanwhile, Schleswig-Holstein, 
Germany’s most northern Land has 
adopted its own licensing regime for 
online sports betting, poker and casino
4
 
with a 20% tax on gross gaming revenue 
and which has been approved by the 
European Commission. bwin.party 
along with many other reputable 
operators has applied for a licence 
in Schleswig-Holstein and intends 
to operate under that licence across 
Germany. While the position of the 
other 15 Länder remains unclear, 
we remain committed to securing a 
commercially viable regulatory regime, 
one that complies with EU law and 
meets the needs and desires of 
consumers, operators and regulators.
Italy (10% of pro forma net gaming 
revenue in 2011)

Italy expanded its online gaming 
regime to include cash game poker and 
certain casino table games in July 2011. 
The Group launched both products 
under its main brands including 
bwin, PartyPoker and Gioco Digitale 
and now has a strong market share 
in all products.

Co-CEO’s review
United Kingdom (10% of pro forma 
net gaming revenue in 2011)
5
The UK Government has announced 
that it intends to amend the existing 
Gambling Act and extend its licensing 
regime to include offshore online 
operators. It is unclear when the 
legislation to effect such a change 
will be considered. Meanwhile, the UK 
Treasury has announced a consultation 
on changing the taxation regime in 
line with the Department for Culture, 
Media and Sport’s proposals and 
taxing operators on the basis of 
customer location. The potential 
outcome of its conclusions remain 
unclear. The industry argued strongly 
that any changes to the basis of 
taxation should only be introduced 
if and when the requisite amendments 
to the UK Gambling Act have already 
been effected, if at all. Such proposals, 
if introduced, may be subject to legal 
challenge by online gaming operators.
France (7% of pro forma net gaming 
revenue in 2011)
5
Despite the calls for changes to the 
French regulatory model put forward 
by Monsieur Villotte, president of the 
French regulator, ARJEL, who argues 
that the regime is not working 
effectively, no change has yet been 
made. Other senior figures such as 
Senator Trucy and Jean-Francois 
Lamour MP have also expressed 
concerns that the regime is preventing 
regulated operators from making 
an economic return as they cannot 
compete with black market operators –
evidenced by the decline in the French 
regulated sports betting market in the 
fourth quarter 2011. There has been 
speculation in the media that some 
changes might be effected before the 
end of 2012 although any such changes 
are unlikely to take place until after 
the Presidential election in May 2012. 
Whether or not this will include any 
reduction in taxation or an expansion 
in the number of regulated products 
is unclear.
Greece (4% of pro forma net gaming 
revenue in 2011)
5
Greece has pressed ahead with its 
proposals for a new gaming law that 
was enacted in August 2011 despite 
the receipt of a detailed opinion from 
the European Commission that raised 
a number of concerns. The requirement 
to have a legal presence in Greece 
together with a proposal to impose 
taxes on operators retrospectively from 
1 January 2010 are just two aspects that 
we believe are in breach of EU law and 
which are the subject of a formal 
complaint submitted by the Remote 
Gambling Association. In the absence 
of any clarity we continue to keep the 
situation under review. 
Spain (5% of pro forma net gaming 
revenue in 2011)
5
It has been reported that over 290 
licence applications have been filed 
with the Spanish regulator by 59 
companies, including bwin.party 
ahead of the country’s new regulatory 
framework coming into force. Whilst 
the exact date upon which licences will 
be issued remains unclear, we expect 
that this will take place during the 
second quarter of 2012. The regulations 
cover all forms of online gaming, 
including live betting and bingo 
but excludes online slot games, with 
a 25% tax on gross gaming revenue. 
In accordance with the regulations we 
have been paying taxes on all Spanish 
revenue generated since 29 May 2011.

Denmark (2% of pro forma net gaming 
revenue in 2011)
5
The new regulatory framework that 
covers sports betting, casino and 
poker went live on 1 January 2012. 
We launched services in each licensed 
product category as well as on behalf 
of our local B2B customer, Danske 
Licens Spil, the leading Danish land-
based gaming operator. Gaming duty 
is payable at 20% of gross 
gaming revenue.
While several other countries are in 
the throes of discussing, drafting as 
well as legislating new laws to regulate, 
the trend is clear: online gaming is 
becoming increasingly recognised as a 
legitimate activity in most EU countries 
and is a branch of eCommerce that can 
and should be regulated. Following the 
adoption of a report by the European 
Parliament
6
 in 2011, there is also an 
acceptance that agreeing a common 
approach to the regulation of online 
gaming is in the interests of European 
stakeholders and consumers. 
United States (Nil share of pro forma 
net gaming revenue in 2011)
5
An opinion from the US Department 
of Justice on 23 December 2011 made 
clear that regulated intra-state online 
games of chance did not breach any 
federal laws. This prompted several 
initiatives in a number of states seeking 
to regulate license and tax online 
gaming activities including California, 
Iowa, Hawaii, New Jersey and 
Mississippi. The state of Nevada has 
already enacted the requisite legislation 
to allow intra-state online poker. With 
the prospect of a ‘patchwork quilt’ of 
regulation, compliance and tax rules, 
the federal government may yet decide 
that it needs to regulate this activity at 
a national level. Estimated to have been 
worth approximately $1.6 billion of 
gross gaming revenue (‘GGR’) in 2006, 
assuming a federal bill was introduced 
the US online poker market could be 
worth up to $4.2 billion in GGR
7
 in the 
first full year after regulation.
Through our joint venture agreements 
with MGM Resorts International and 
Boyd Gaming Corporation that were 
concluded during the year, we believe 
that we are well-placed to capitalise on 
any such opportunities as and when 
they arise.
Competition
The competitive landscape is also 
continuing to evolve rapidly, partly 
as a result of some of the regulatory 
changes outlined above and partly due 
to other factors. The indictment of the 
founders of PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker 
and Absolute Poker/Ultimate Bet on 15 
April 2011 represented the start of what 
we believe will prove to be a 
fundamental shift in the shape and 
structure of the global online poker 
market. With the exception of 
PokerStars, all of these sites have now 
closed. PokerStars’ relative size meant 
that it was able to capture the lion’s 
share of Full Tilt’s non-US players, 
consolidating its position as market 
leader in most territories. This makes for 
a challenging operating environment 
for our poker business but we believe 
that we can remain one of the largest 
networks in each market. Our position 
should be further enhanced when we 
pool our player liquidity across our 
poker brands in the dotcom as well as 
the ring-fenced markets in Italy and 
France later this year. 
Separately, the past 18 months have 
seen the emergence of a new gaming 
phenomenon on the internet: social 
gaming. Zynga, Playdom, Playfish and 
other social gaming platforms have all 
experienced spectacular growth with 
their virtual currency and virtual goods-
driven business models that have 
attracted millions of customers across 
the globe. Zynga’s CEO, Mark Pincus was 
quoted recently saying that online 
gambling is a “natural fit” with virtual 
goods and social games.
We believe it is only a matter of time 
before the worlds of real money gaming 
and social gaming converge. This 
represents a major opportunity for 
bwin.party and we have a number of 
initiatives already underway in this 
area that we expect to drive value for 
shareholders in the medium to long-term.

Technology developments
The continued evolution of smartphone, 
tablet and other mobile technology 
has driven strong growth in the 
consumption of gaming products 
through the mobile channel. Customers 
no longer have to be in front of their PC 
or laptop to enjoy playing online games. 
We expect this trend to continue as 
new devices emerge but also as 
network infrastructure continues to 
improve and as payment processing 
and personal identification 
technologies evolve.
In its recent filing with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, Facebook 
stated that 425 million or 50.2% of 
users accessed its services via a 
mobile device. The penetration of 
smartphones is continuing to expand 
and is already greater than PCs or 
laptops. In its recent fourth quarter 
results for 2011, Apple Inc. announced 
that it had sold 37 million iPhones and 
over 15 million iPad’s, a 128% and 
11% increase respectively over the 
previous year. 
Whilst transactional-based gambling 
such as sports betting is already 
flourishing over existing networks, 
the next generation of networks are 
emerging and can be expected to 
revolutionise the gaming experience 
on mobile platforms. With transmission 
speeds of up to 10 Mbps (Megabits per 
second) these networks will be over 
five times the speed of existing 3G 
networks, significantly improving the 
mobile gaming experience, particularly 
for games such as poker, casino and 
bingo that typically require greater 
volumes of data traffic. The other 
dynamic that is driving the accessibility 
of online games is the increasing 
prevalence of Wi-Fi that is available in 
public locations and that most mobile 
devices are now able to use. In its March 
2012 budget the UK Government 
announced funding for ultrafast 
broadband and Wi-Fi in ten of the UK’s 
biggest cities, with additional funding 
for smaller cities too.
Against this backdrop, our business 
is continuing to perform well and we 
remain on-track.
Summary, current trading 
and outlook
Since 31 December 2011, the Group 
has performed in-line with the Board’s 
expectations with growth in all 
verticals versus the previous quarter. 
A summary of the current trading 
performance relative to the fourth 
quarter of 2011 is shown below:
Pro forma and Actual
Gross average  
daily revenue (€)
Period 
ended  
24 March 
2012 Q4 11 Change
Sports betting 932,600 900,200 4%
Casino & games 923,800 902,700 2%
Poker 747,300 747,200 0%
Bingo 324,100 319,000 2%
Total 2,927,800 2,869,100 2%
The pace of regulatory, technological 
and competitive change is showing no 
sign of slowing down. But, the scale and 
breadth of our revenue base, coupled 
with our significant resources all mean 
that we are in a strong position to 
capture a bigger share of the expanding 
digital entertainment market. Current 
trading has been robust with gross 
average daily revenue in the 12 weeks 
to 24 March 2012 up 2% versus the 
fourth quarter of 2011 to €2,927,800 
(Q4 11: €2,869,100). While the current 
macroeconomic environment appears 
to be impacting performance in parts of 
southern Europe, this is being offset by 
stronger performances elsewhere. 
Active player days increased in all 
verticals versus the previous quarter 
and amounts wagered in both sports 
and casino were up strongly although  Overview 02

there was a small drop in gross win 
margin to 7.9% in sports (Q4 11: 8.5%) 
and 3.9% in casino (Q4 11: 4.1%).
Should the proposed regulatory 
framework in Schleswig-Holstein 
become effective and we are awarded 
a licence, we propose to offer sports 
betting, casino and poker products 
across Germany and pay the proposed 
tax of 20% of gross gaming revenue 
on all products. While this will impact 
Clean EBITDA in 2012, we have identified 
€10m – €15m of savings in 2012 and 
2013 that will partially mitigate the 
impact on our financial performance. 
While regulatory uncertainties 
continue, the prospect of the Euro 2012 
championship later this year, the 
opening of the regulated Spanish 
market and our delivery of additional 
synergies mean that we remain 
confident about the Group’s prospects.
2011 was the year of integration and 
regulation. 2012 will be the year of 
integration, regulation and innovation – 
we have made an excellent start.
“Even in such a 
challenging business 
environment we 
continue to deliver 
positive cashflow 
thanks to the 
strength of our 
business model.”

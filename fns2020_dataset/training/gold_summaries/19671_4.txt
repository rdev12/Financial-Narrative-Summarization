DESCRIPTION
Our employees are central to our 
strategy and success and we aim to:
• Find and attract highly qualified  
and skilled employees
• Engage our employees through 
exciting work and opportunities
• Retain the expertise and knowledge 
that we have built.
DESCRIPTION
A robust balance sheet and strong  
cash generation allows us to:
• Invest in organic growth
• Pursue strategic acquisitions
• Pay sustainable dividends 
to shareholders.
IMPORTANCE
In order to increase the level of revenue 
growth that we can achieve, it is key 
that we expand into both adjacent and 
new markets.
IMPORTANCE
We operate in highly competitive niche 
markets and if we fail to invest in the 
business at a sufficient level then we 
will see our market share decrease.
IMPORTANCE
If we work closely with our customers 
then we have the best chance of 
understanding both their current and 
future requirements. We want our 
customers to view Spirent as the 
expert that they turn to in order to 
solve their problems.
IMPORTANCE
In order to be technology leaders we  
have to be aware of other technologies  
we need which have been developed 
outside Spirent, which we either don’t 
have the skills or the necessary time  
to develop.
IMPORTANCE
Our employees are our business and 
without the best possible team, we will  
not be able to deliver on our strategy. 
Every element of our strategy is built 
around staff innovation and expertise.
IMPORTANCE
Having financial strength and flexibility 
means that we are able to act quickly 
when we see an opportunity in any of 
our strategic priorities.

COMMENTARY
We continue to target new markets in a 
very structured manner and ensure that 
we have a healthy balance between 
maintaining our existing core markets 
and customers, and expanding into new 
markets and winning new customers.
COMMENTARY
In our largest markets we currently 
believe that we have strong technology 
leadership positions after the investment 
in the business over the last two years. 
We have achieved significant product 
milestones in the year as a result of 
this investment.
COMMENTARY
In 2015 we have implemented the 
salesforce customer relationship 
management software to improve our 
interaction with customers and in 2016 
we expect to see the full benefits. 
COMMENTARY
After heavy investment in 2014 we 
bedded in those acquisitions in 2015. We 
added an acquisition and an investment 
in an associate during the year. Our 
business leaders have a strong input into 
any expansion of our portfolio.
COMMENTARY
During 2015, we evolved our employee 
skillbase to ensure we have the right 
people with the right skills for our 
2016 opportunities. 
COMMENTARY
We value strong financial diligence 
within the Group and ensuring that 
profit turns to cash is always a 
top priority.

 UK
Consumer spending remained 
challenging throughout the 
year, which resulted in the UK 
delivering an operating loss of 
£24.7 million for the ﬁnancial year 
ended 31 March 2012.
 Total UK sales were down 4.6 per cent at £560.0 million, with like-
for-like sales down 6.2 per cent. Gross margin erosion of circa 500 
basis points over the year put further pressure on UK proﬁtability. 
As a result the UK delivered an operating loss of £24.7 million for 
the year ended 31 March 2012
 The strategy for transforming the UK will, over the next three years, 
dispose of loss making stores, reduce the operating cost base by 
at least £20 million and invest in product, store environment and 
services, thereby returning the UK to proﬁtability

We ended the year with 311 stores in the 
UK having closed a net 62 stores (closed 
67 and opened ﬁve stores) during the 
year. Space in the UK was down 3.5 per 
cent, closing the year with 1,946k sq. ft. 
across the store portfolio. It is our 
intention to further reduce the store 
network to circa 200 stores, reducing 
space to circa 1,700k sq. ft. by March 2015.
Over the year store-based sales were 
down 8.7 per cent to £398.7 million. This 
was attributable to both the decline in 
like-for-like sales and the continued 
closure of stores.
Total direct sales were up 0.8 per cent 
at £130.0 million with Direct in Home 
sales of £91.7 million and Direct in Store 
sales of £38.3 million. The legacy 
platform, which contributed to the 
under performance of our sales in this 
segment, has now been replaced by 
a new platform. Our new website offers 
additional functionality making it 
easier for customers to navigate and 
complete orders more effectively, which 
is expected to restore this segment of 
our sales to growth.
Wholesale sales were up 44.9 per cent 
to £31.3 million. The mini club range, 
which is a strategic partnership with 
Boots UK, continues to perform well. 
We are exploring the opportunities for 
growing ELC’s wholesale sales and 
have conducted successful trials with 
several leading retailers over the 
Christmas period.

We have taken our ﬁrst steps towards 
a multi-channel strategy across our 
International markets. We now have 
operational internet sites for ELC in 
Russia and Australia and for 
Mothercare in Kuwait, Ireland and 
Australia. We work with our franchise 
partners to develop appropriate 
websites and believe all our major 
partners will have transactional 
websites by March 2015.
We have a small wholesale business 
for ELC that helps us extend our reach 
to markets where we do not have 
franchise stores. Over the year 
wholesale sales were down 26.6 per 
cent to £6.9 million. This was mainly 
the result of changing our wholesale 
operations in North America.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Since November 2005 Booker Group 
has been seeking to ‘Focus, Drive and 
Broaden’ the business. We continue to 
make good progress. 
Focus 
(commenced November 2005)
Booker seeks to become the most 
efficient operator in our sector. We 
continue to improve business efficiency. 
We ‘stop, simplify and standardise’ work 
and invest most of the resulting savings 
in customer service. 
Drive  
(commenced March 2006)
Booker Wholesale, our cash and carry 
business, served 523,000 customers 
this year up from 503,000 last year. We 
continue to ‘Drive’ choice, price and 
service for our customers. Each year 
we survey 40,000 customers to identify 
where improvements can be made. 
Customer satisfaction improved again 
this year. Customer satisfaction is a 
key measure within the business and 
we have made significant progress 
since 2006. 
Choice Up
• Booker seeks to grow brands and 
own brand volumes.
• In 2010 we launched Farm Fresh. 
Sales in the year to 27 March 
2015 were £65m. This is despite 
considerable deflation in the fresh 
markets. The quality and freshness 
of the produce is second to none and 
can be delivered to our customers 
within 48 hours of being harvested.
• We launched CleanPro last year. 
This range of professional cleaning 
products has been well received 
by customers. We have 50,000 
customers buying CleanPro each 
week with sales of £39m per annum.

Booker’s Pricing vs Cash & Carry Market
price deflation, particularly in 
the catering sector. Booker has 
consistently offered low prices on 
these core products and maintains 
its promise of helping the customer 
during challenging times.
Better Service
• Our people are doing an excellent 
job. Our customers rate Booker 
people highly. Business Centre 
teams across the Group have been 
trained in PRIDE to help improve 
the Parking, Reception, Internal, 
Delivery and Exit experience.
• We have continued to expand and 
improve our delivery service.
• We have more specialist butchers 
and greengrocers within the business 
than last year. We also have skilled 
fish mongers operating in our Makro 
business centres.
Catering
• Catering like-for-like sales grew by 
2.0%, as our choice, prices and 
service continued to improve. Our 
catering development sales force 
continues to serve our existing 
customers and to introduce new 
customers to Booker. 
Premier
• Premier, Booker’s symbol group, 
grew to 3,082 stores (2,902 
stores last year). Sales to these 
customers grew by 14%. The retail 
development team has put a lot 
of work into both compliance and 
building the sales and profits of 
existing Premier stores.
• For the first time we advertised 
Premier on the television this year. 
This was well received by Premier 
retailers and consumers.
• Premier still remains unique by 
operating a no cost model for 
members, and has the advantage 
for retailers of having deliveries and 
also the ability to top-up at their local 
Booker branch. We install the fascia 
and imagery free of charge and also 
provide a market leading promotion 
every four weeks. All goods are 
delivered at cash and carry prices.
• We are committed to Premier 
and continue to see attractive 
opportunities for independent 
retailers to prosper in the UK’s 
convenience market.
Customer Delivery
• Booker offers a seven days a 
week multi-temperature delivery 
service to both retail and catering 
customers (70% of the fleet has 
multi temperature capacity). All 
of our delivery customers pay the 
same price for goods as our collect 
customers. Our delivery business 
continues to grow (from £600m in 
2008/9 to £1.4bn in 2014/15).

Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015 / Strategic Report
Classic Drinks
• We are now operating Classic, 
our specialist on trade wholesale 
business, via the Booker and Makro 
business centres. This is working well.
Broaden  
(commenced April 2007)
In the UK, Booker seeks to offer the best 
choice, price and service to caterers, 
retailers and small business. We also 
seek to become the suppliers’ preferred 
route to market. In addition, we want 
to sell new products and services and 
reach new customers. In India we seek 
to become the best supplier to Kirana 
stores. To achieve these objectives, 
we are ‘Broadening’ the business. 
‘Broaden’ includes:
Makro
• Makro has had a good year. In eleven 
locations we have combined Makro 
and Booker. This has been tailored to 
the local market. Critically, Makro is 
helping increase our capacity to grow 
delivered sales. This should help the 
Group grow to an estimated £6bn of 
sales in the next few years.
Digital 
• Sales at booker.co.uk were £874m, 
up from £777m last year and £15m 
in 2005. All these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. We have 
408,000 customers registered on 
the website compared to 334,000 
last year. Customers can view their 
account details, use an iPhone app 
and order products. We have also 
doubled the number of stock keeping 
units available to a typical customer 
on the website through our special 
order system. This has generated 
sales of £5m. 
Booker Direct/Ritter-Courivaud 
and Chef Direct
• Booker Direct serves national 
accounts from our distribution 
centres, including the prison service 
in England and Wales, Marks & 
Spencer and most of the cinema 
chains in the UK.
• In 2010 we acquired Ritter-Courivaud, 
a leading speciality food supplier to 
restaurants. Through combining the 
logistics expertise we have in Booker 
Direct, with the catering knowledge 
from Ritter-Courivaud and the 
Groups’ buying scale, we launched 
Chef Direct in 2012. Chef Direct is 
based in Didcot and has won some 
important clients such as Aramark 
and Wagamama. Aramark serves 
250,000 meals a day and, through 
working with Booker Direct, their 
road miles have been halved and 
service has been improved.
Family Shopper
• We continue to develop Family 
Shopper, a local discount format. 
This is doing well. At May 2015, we 
have thirty stores and, although it 
is early days, the response to this 
format has been encouraging.
Booker India 
• In September 2009 we opened our 
first business centre in Mumbai. 
We now have 19,000 customers 
and have also launched 190 Happy 
Shopper symbol retailers which 
harness the lessons learned from 
Premier in the UK for the Kirana 
stores of Mumbai. We now have four 
branches in Mumbai, one in Surat and 
one joint venture branch in Pune. We 
continue to review growth options in 
India and look forward to developing 
the Booker offer to become the best 
choice, price and service supplier to 
Kirana stores and caterers.
Sustainability 
• Booker was the first UK wholesaler to 
achieve a third consecutive Carbon 
Trust Standard and the first in the 
UK to achieve the new Carbon Trust 
Waste Standard. Booker are also 
The Grocer Gold ‘Green Wholesaler 
of the Year’ 2014.
• Over 20,000 customers are now 
recycling with Booker through our 
packaging and used cooking oil 
recycling services. This helps our 
customers save money, increase 
recycling levels and support more 
sustainable communities throughout 
the UK.
• We installed our first sales floor LED 
lighting trial.
• We donated surplus food equivalent 
to over 288,000 meals to local 
charities in the last year.

• We are committed to helping our 
retail and catering customers serve 
communities throughout the United 
Kingdom.
Structure
• Rather than having the business 
structured as Booker Wholesale, 
Makro, Booker Direct, Chef Direct 
and Ritter-Courivaud, we have 
restructured to reflect our customers. 
Steve Fox will be responsible for all our 
retailers whether they are Premiers, 
Family Shoppers, independents, 
chains or multiple accounts. Stuart 
Hyslop has become responsible for 
all our caterers and small business 
customers. Andrew Muldoon runs 
all the business centres, whether 
they are Booker or Makro. Andrew 
Thompson with the Directors of 
Trading will be responsible for Group 
Buying. This team reports through to 
Guy Farrant and myself. This allows 
us to best deploy the strengths of 
Booker Group to all our customers.
People 
• Again our team have done a great 
job this year. We are committed to 
continuing to make Booker better 
and safer for colleagues. We are 
also developing talent. For example, 
there is a shortage of butchers in the 
trade, so we have partnered with the 
University of West London to develop 
a formal ‘butchery apprenticeship’. 
28 new butchers graduated this year. 
We developed a similar scheme for 
greengrocers with 50 colleagues 
graduating this year. We intend to run 
both schemes again in 2015/16.
• Investment in our people has 
continued to make progress
– All of our drivers and managers 
have had an annual refresher 
course of Safe, Secure and Legal 
training and our vocational drivers 
have now completed five years 
for the Certificate of Professional 
Competence (CPC), which is run 
by our team of in house trainers 
and delivery support managers.
– Further training has been 
developed this year. From 
2015 we are running a driver 
apprenticeship scheme, open to 
internal and external drivers who 
wish to develop their career with 
Booker. We are also launching 
two new annual training days 
for managers, to support them 
by improving their day to day 
operation to increase customer 
satisfaction and continue helping 
us to drive cash profit.
• For the tenth year running, the 
performance of the business means 
our people have shared in our 
success through our bonus system. 
With this great team of people, Booker 
will continue to make progress in the 
year ahead. 
• During the year Richard Rose, our 
Chairman, and Mark Aylwin, who 
ran Booker Direct / Chef Direct and 
Ritter-Courivaud, announced they 
would step down in April. They joined 
the Group in 2007 when Booker 
merged with Blueheath. Both have 
made a real contribution to the Group 
and we wish both of them the very 
best for the future.
Our plan to Focus, Drive and Broaden 
the business remains on track. Customer 
satisfaction continued to improve. We 
grew the Group to £4.8bn of sales. We 
strive to provide our customers with 
improved choice, prices and service via 
the internet, delivery and cash and carry. 
We have a great team and together we 
will help our customers prosper in the 
year ahead.

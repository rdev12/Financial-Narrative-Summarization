 I am pleased to present the results for the Group for 
the twelve months ended 30 June 2009. In arguably the
toughest environment for television production of the last
decade DCD has demonstrated extraordinary resilience
recording relatively flat operating result over the prior 
year at the adjusted Profit before Tax level. It is both the
breadth of production genres and our vertically integrated
model that underpins this performance. For example, 
a weak commissioning environment may offer greater
opportunities in the distribution of pre-produced content
owned or controlled by DCD Rights, pressure on production
margins may be offset by exploiting every aspect of
intellectual property such as DVD and ancillary rights, 
a reduction in broadcaster spend on drama may be offset
by an increase in higher volume, lower cost documentary
or factual entertainment series production and, perhaps
most characteristically of the year under review, a growing
footprint in the USA can mitigate a more hostile domestic
television market. 
Financial Review
Revenues to 30 June 2009 were £34.5m, up £0.5m on the
previous year’s £34.0m. With domestic UK sourced work
accounting for approximately 52%, international production
30%, and programme distribution and exploitation of
ancillary rights accounting for the remaining 18%.
The profit for the year has benefited from the continued
push into the ancillary rights areas such as merchandising
and publishing.  The re-organisation which occurred prior
in the first half of the year allowed significant overhead
savings to be made across occupancy and back office
areas. The Group’s statutory profit before tax was £0.5m
(2008: Loss £25.4m).   
The measure used by the Group to indicate operating
performance aims to reflect normalised trading before
exceptional, restructuring items, non cash impairment
charges, but after net finance costs. 
In normalising Profit Before Tax (“PBT”) and Earnings
Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation
(“EBITDA”), the Group does not add back all its
amortisation charges. There are various ways to 
reflect the non-cash amortisation charges, but the 
Group believes that where there is a direct cash cost
related to earnings this type of related amortisation 
charge should not be added back. This primarily refers 
to amortisation of long-term television drama production.
The Group continues to capitalize its intellectual property 
in line with the release of revenue from such investments.
A reconciliation of the Group’s Adjusted PBT and EBITDA 
is shown below:
£m £m
2009 2008
Operating profit/(loss) 
per statutory accounts 1.0 (24.4)
Add: Amortisation of intangibles 7.2 9.0
Add: Impairment of goodwill/related 
intangibles – 18.20
Add: Impairment of programme rights – 2.3
Add: Depreciation 0.1 0.2
EBITDA 8.3 5.3
Less: Amortisation relating to viewing 
rights of programmes commissioned 
by third parties (5.6) (3.3)
EBITDA 2.72.00
Add: Integration costs expensed – 0.5
Add: Restructuring costs 
(legal and statutory) 0.3 1.3
Adjusted EBITDA 3.0 3.8
Less: Net interest costs (0.5) (1.0)
Less: Depreciation (0.1) (0.2)
Adjusted PBT 2.4 2.6
The Group’s management believes the most appropriate
measure of performance after taking account of the 
non-cash and non-trading charges shown above is the
Adjusted PBT of £2.4m (2008:£2.6m). 
Balance sheet highlights
At the year end total convertible loan debt stood at £9.9m
(2008: £11.5m) however, the convertible debt liability was
substantially reduced on 30 November 2009 to £2.9m
following the agreement of our primary holder of
convertible loan notes, Highbridge Capital Management
LLC (“Highbridge), to cancel approximately £6.9m of
convertible loan notes in exchange for approximately 
£2.5m of cash and 7,631,048 new ordinary shares. The 
cash consideration was met from a new senior bank 
loan from Coutts & Co. of £3.0m, provided on normal
commercial terms, and repayable over three years in 
equal quarterly instalments. The balance of the loan 
is being used to increase working capital within DCD. 
The remainder of the convertible debt is £2.9m redeemable
in November 2012 if not previously converted at the fixed
price of 18p. 
The change in the company’s debt leverage since the year
end is significant. Before the re-finance described above,
net debt stood at a multiple of, approximately, 3.7 times
adjusted profit before tax. The multiple reflected in these
results is now, approximately, 2.5 following the recent
refinance. By the end of 2010, the Group is targeting a
further reduction.

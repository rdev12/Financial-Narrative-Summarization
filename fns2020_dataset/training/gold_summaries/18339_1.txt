Chief Executive’s Review
The past 12 months have been a 
productive time for DTZ. Although 
conditions remain challenging in 
many of our key markets, we restored 
profitability on an operating basis and 
the tangible benefits from our recent 
restructuring are now embedded in 
the business and have positioned 
us well for future growth.
Certain results of that restructuring such as 
lowered staff costs and improved operating 
margins were of course a priority at the time. 
However, of equal importance then, and what 
matters even more as we move forward, 
is how the restructuring has made the firm 
better positioned to deliver results for our 
clients. I am specifically referring to the fact 
that DTZ increasingly operates today with 
a ‘One Firm’ approach, working across our 
service lines to deliver responsive, creative 
solutions to clients’ real estate needs in all 
of our markets across the globe. This change 
is key and will make a real difference to the 
business in the years to come.
Performance
Revenues for the financial year ended 
30 April 2010 reduced slightly by 2.2 per 
cent to £356.0 million (2009: £364.1 million). 
However, after normalising for the effect 
of discontinued or disposed entities, 
the Group grew revenues by 1.5 per cent 
to £351.4 million (2009: £346.3 million) 
on a like-for-like basis.
As a result of the significant cost reduction 
programme undertaken we delivered a 
small profit before tax and exceptional items 
of £3.6 million (2009: loss £35.1 million). 
After exceptional items and before tax 
we reported a loss of £22.9 million 
(2009: loss £79.7 million). 
Despite the continuing uncertainty during 
the year in many of our markets, we benefited 
from our strong market positions across 
Asia Pacific and especially in China. 
Indeed, led by China, the Asia Pacific 
region delivered strong revenue growth 
and a robust performance. Interestingly, 
the growth trajectory in China is having 
a positive impact on one of its biggest 
regional trading partners, Japan, where 
we also enjoyed a good year in our 
Occupational & Development Markets 
and Investment Agency businesses.
In the UK & Ireland, we saw increasing 
activity in the investment and occupier 
markets, led by Central London.
CEMEA continued to face challenging 
conditions throughout the year, but Paris 
stood out as an exception and remained 
an investment alternative to London.
Strategic objectives
•  To be the best firm in the real estate services industry
•  To take a ‘One Firm’ approach in everything we do
•  To provide ‘best in class’ services to our clients 
wherever we choose to compete

In Canada, a country that has come through 
the financial crisis relatively unscathed, our 
business has remained in good shape. 
Strategic Review and Restructuring 
The strategic review and restructuring 
programme we started back in 2008 is 
now complete and I am pleased to report 
that we have managed to achieve cost 
savings of over £75 million. Of that amount, 
circa £55 million came from structural staff 
cost savings and over £20 million from 
savings in operating expenses. 
There are three important points to be 
made about the restructuring:
First, DTZ professionals never allowed the 
inherent demands of the initiative to distract 
from the continuing objective of being the 
‘best in class’ in delivering tangible results 
for our clients.
Second, we not only exceeded our initial 
cost reduction targets, we also delivered 
them ahead of schedule.
Finally, the restructuring should be seen 
as part of a deep‑rooted and enduring 
approach, not as a ‘one‑off’ exercise. 
As we look to achieve sustainable profitability 
we will be constantly reviewing the shape 
of the business to ensure that it is fit for our 
clients both geographically and by service 
line. This flexibility will allow us to meet our 
clients’ evolving requirements – a good 
example is our expansion into Vietnam.
Corporate Development
The Group has announced its intention to 
purchase the remaining 20 per cent of DTZ 
Asset Management Europe SAS which it 
does not already own. Asset management 
is a key business for DTZ and an area we 
have highlighted as a growth priority. If the 
proposed acquisition is approved by DTZ’s 
shareholders, DTZ Asset Management 
Europe SAS will become a wholly 
owned subsidiary of the Group. 
The Market and DTZ
In 2009, the two major markets which 
bucked the trend of continuing declines 
in real estate transaction volumes were 
the UK and Asia Pacific. These are DTZ’s 
two strongest markets.
In the UK, where investors were attracted 
by the depreciation in sterling as well as 
the depth and sophistication of the market, 
transaction volumes were flat compared 
to the previous year, according to DTZ 
Research. Quite remarkable, considering 
that transaction volumes globally were 
down 35 per cent year‑on‑year. 
The UK was also able to attract capital 
from international investors at a time when 
global cross border flows were down nearly 
60 per cent year‑on‑year. For a business 
such as ours, which thrives on transactional 
activity, the performance of the UK in tough 
economic conditions is heartening.
The picture becomes even brighter when 
you consider that Asia Pacific was the only 
region showing growth in cross‑ border flows 
into Europe. We hold strong market positions 
across the Asia Pacific region and continue 
to invest there. Our ability to facilitate the 
movement of that capital and then advise 
on the execution of a transaction is one 
of the many reasons why the ‘One Firm’ 
approach is so essential to the future of DTZ.
As we look to the future, we are seeing the early 
signs of those cross‑border flows spreading 
out further afield than just London. In 2009, the 
market saw activity from institutional investors in 
Asia targeting the UK, in particular London, but 
more recently there has been growing interest 
towards markets such as Paris and Berlin. While 
we expect European activity to slowly pick up in 
the coming year, it will in all likelihood be focused 
on those countries with higher credit ratings 
such as France and Germany, where we also 
have well established and strong businesses. 
Those Eurozone countries struggling under 
the weight of huge budget deficits will have 
a harder time attracting investment capital.
We also have grounds for optimism in 
the amount of new equity capital available

Global Market Environment
Global investment volumes totalled US$191bn in 2009, representing a 35 per cent decline 
compared with 2008, and more than a two third decline on the annual level reached at the 
peak of the cycle in 2007. However, with investment volumes having hit the bottom in Q1 
2009, quarterly volumes have been growing since then. The sustainability of this recovery 
however remains uncertain.

Forecasts indicate regional and global growth returning in 2010. While the EU is 
expected to lag somewhat the US and Asia, it will be heading towards trend growth 
by 2011/2012 – consequently we are now at the start of the new economic cycle.

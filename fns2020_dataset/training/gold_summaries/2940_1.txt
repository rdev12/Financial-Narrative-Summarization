Our performance
Group Chief Executive’s review
More specifically, in 2007 we said that going forward we will 
focus on
• growing revenue in support services at stable margins of
between four and five per cent
• using the strong positions we have established in our chosen
sectors of the Private Finance market in the UK and Canada 
to win projects in which equity investments will create
significant value for the Group
• more than doubling Carillion’s share of revenues from our 
Joint Venture businesses in the Middle East from £274 million 
in 2006 to over £600 million within the next three years, at 
margins of some 6 per cent
• improving the combined margins of our construction activities 
in the UK, Canada and the Caribbean and the Middle East
towards 3 per cent over the next three years.
We also set seven key performance indicators for 2007 in respect
of which Carillion has performed strongly, as we continued to
build on the step change in Carillion’s development that we
achieved in 2006 through the acquisition and successful
integration of Mowlem. 
Key performance indicators in 2007
1. Attract, develop and retain excellent people by 
becoming an employer of choice
Delighting our customers by meeting or exceeding their
expectations depends primarily on the quality of our people.
Therefore, our ability to attract, develop and retain excellent
people by becoming an employer of choice continues to be our
top priority. 
In 2007, we made further good progress towards this objective
through the leadership, personal development and employee
engagement programmes we have introduced across the 
Group to help all our people fulfil their potential and contribute 
to Carillion’s success. 
Creating a culture of trust and open communication is essential 
to the success of our people policies and programmes. Our
managers and supervisors seek to engage with all our people
through regular one-to-one meetings, individual performance 
and development reviews and monthly team talks, supported 
by newsletters and our Company newspaper, Spectrum that 
once again received the top national award in 2007 from
‘Communicators in Business’ as the best UK company newspaper.
Listening to what our people tell us and acting upon it is vital to
good communication. To that end and to help us monitor and
measure our progress, we conduct employee surveys. For example,
every year we hold ‘The Great Debate’, an interactive survey in
which our people, selected randomly from across the Group, 
share their views on a wide range of issues, which are important
to their development and satisfaction and to the success of
Carillion. In 2007, around 2,500 people took part in ‘The Great
Debate’, the results of which showed that we are making good
overall progress on these issues and that our average scores
compared favourably with those of other top UK companies.
Carillion’s success continues to be based
on implementing our consistent and
successful strategy for sustainable,
profitable growth of
> growing support services and Public
Private Partnership (PPP) projects
organically and by acquisition
> developing and marketing integrated
solutions tailored to the needs of
customers, including project finance,
design and construction, maintenance
and lifetime asset management, and
> maintaining a strong and selective
construction capability focused on
higher added-value contracts for long
term customers.

2. Be the recognised leader in the delivery of safety
and sustainability
The Health and Safety of our people and everyone who works
with us or is affected by our operations is paramount. In 2005, 
we set the demanding objective of eliminating reportable
accidents by 2010. 
Known as ‘Target Zero’, this objective is led by our Board and
requires the constant vigilance and commitment of everyone in
Carillion to ensure that safe working practices are consistently
adopted and supported by rigorous reviews, audits and training.
We are pleased to report that in 2007 we made further progress
towards ‘Target Zero’. The Group’s Accident Frequency Rate (AFR)
reduced by 22 per cent to 0.14 reportable accidents per 100,000
man hours worked (2006 AFR: 0.18), which ranks with the best 
in our sector. This follows year on year reductions in our AFR of 
25 per cent in 2006 and 35 per cent in 2005.
Despite a nine per cent increase in the total number of hours
worked in 2007 to over 210 million, the total number of
reportable accidents under RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, 
Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995) reduced
by 15 per cent to 295 (2006: 347) and also follows year on year
reductions of 24 per cent in 2006 and 27 per cent in 2005.
We deeply regret that one fatal traffic accident, involving a 
Joint Venture employee, occurred on one of our international
project sites in 2007. One prosecution of Carillion and one of 
its sub-contractors by the Health and Safety Executive, relating 
to incidents that occurred in 2004, was concluded in 2007. 
No other enforcement notices were received by Carillion or 
any of its sub-contractors in 2007 in respect of work being 
carried out by Carillion or on the Company’s behalf.
In 2007, Carillion once again submitted information on the 
Health and Safety performance of all its UK business units to 
the Corporate Health and Safety Performance Index, having 
been the first and only major construction company to do so in
2006. This Index, which is sponsored by the Health and Safety
Commission, covers all aspects of Health and Safety management
and performance. A wide range of industries participate in the
Index, which enables us to benchmark our performance beyond
our own industry sector. In 2007, we improved our Index score 
to 7.4 (2006: 6.4), which was well above the mean score of 6.7.
Our commitment to sustainability has made Carillion the
recognised leader in the development and adoption of responsible
business practices, as we demonstrated by topping our sector 
with a Gold performance ranking in Business in the Community’s
2006 Corporate Responsibility Index. We say more about our
programme for sustainable development on pages 33 to 35 of 
this report. 
More detailed information on Health and Safety and sustainability
will be published in our 2007 Sustainability Report on our website
at www.carillionplc.com/sustainability in April 2008. 
3. Deliver revenue growth of a minimum of five per cent
through exceeding our customers’ expectations 
In 2007, revenue increased by 13 per cent, which after allowing
for a full year contribution from the businesses acquired with
Mowlem in February 2006, means we achieved organic growth 
of eight per cent and ahead of our objective of five per cent.
Organic growth was driven mainly by a 20 per cent increase 
in UK support services revenue, particularly in the defence and
private sector facilities management sectors, and a 25 per cent
increase in Middle East construction services revenue, reflecting
our strong markets in both Dubai and Oman. 
4. Deliver Mowlem integration cost savings at a run 
rate of £26 million per annum by the end of 2007 
We delivered integration cost savings at a run rate of £26 million a
year, in line with our objective and significantly above the original
target run rate of £15 million a year, which we announced at 
the time of acquisition. These hard, measurable savings were
achieved in a number of areas, including eliminating management
duplication, the adoption of Carillion’s shared services model for
central and back office functions, property rationalisation and
more efficient and effective supply chain management.
5. Deliver materially enhanced earnings in 2007
Revenue and margin growth resulted in 23 and 22 per cent 
increases in underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings
per share, respectively. Increasing margins, particularly in the
businesses acquired with Mowlem, through applying Carillion’s
strict project selectivity criteria and risk management processes was
identified at the time of acquisition as an important opportunity
for earnings growth. Overall operating margins increased to 
2.6 per cent (2006: 2.3 per cent), with increases in group
construction services (excluding the Middle East) to 0.7 per cent
(2006: 0.6 per cent) and in Middle East construction services to
7.5 per cent (2006: 5.2 per cent). 
6. Generate cash-backed operating profit
Underlying cash flow from operations of £135.7 million
comfortably exceeded underlying profit from operations of 
£101.2 million. Strong cash management is fundamental to
delivering sustainable profitable growth and the consistent 
delivery of cash-backed profit remains a key performance 
indicator for the Group.
7. Achieve average net borrowing in the full-year of 
around £150 million
Average net borrowing was £130.3 million and well below 
our full-year target. Achieving this objective and reducing net
borrowing at 31 December to £44.9 million (2006: £108.0 million)
follows our success in delivering a strong cash flow from
operations, in line with our continuing focus on cash
management.  19 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Key performance indicators in 2008
In order to maintain the Group’s strong momentum we have 
set the following key performance indicators for 2008
• continue to attract, develop and retain excellent people 
by being an employer of choice
• be the recognised leader in the delivery of safety 
and sustainability
• deliver revenue growth of a minimum of five per cent 
• successfully integrate Alfred McAlpine and deliver 
integration cost savings that put us on track to achieve 
savings at a run rate of £30 million by the end of 2009
• achieve earnings per share growth that puts us on track 
to deliver materially enhanced earnings per share in 
2009 following the Alfred McAlpine acquisition
• generate cash-backed operating profit
• achieve year-end net borrowing in the region of £300 million.
Acquisition of Alfred McAlpine
In December 2007, we announced the terms of a recommended
shares and cash offer for the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine plc.
The acquisition, which received the overwhelming support 
of Carillion and Alfred McAlpine shareholders, was completed 
on 12 February 2008 and valued Alfred McAlpine’s share capital 
at £554.5 million. The acquisition was funded by the issue of 
112.9 million new Carillion shares, £171.7 million in cash and 
£1.3 million of loan notes. 
Alfred McAlpine is an excellent strategic fit and the acquisition is
expected to deliver significant value for shareholders by generating
substantial synergy cost savings and enhanced operational
performance. Combining the complementary skills and market
strengths of Carillion and Alfred McAlpine will create
• a leading UK support services business with annual support
services revenues of approximately £2.6 billion (based on 
2007 revenues) 
• an enhanced capability to provide integrated solutions, including
design, construction, maintenance, facilities management and
private finance
• a strong and selective construction business that will continue 
to target margin improvement through the application of
Carillion’s project selectivity and risk management processes
• synergy cost savings at a run rate of £30 million per annum 
by the end of 2009 for a one-off cost of £30 million
• financial returns well ahead of Carillion’s weighted average 
cost of capital
• materially enhanced earnings in 2009.
The integration of the Carillion and Alfred McAlpine businesses
has already commenced and is progressing very well. We look
forward to working with our 8,500 new colleagues during 2008
and beyond in order to create an even stronger business from
which all stakeholders can benefit.
Outlook and prospects 
Through the acquisition of Mowlem we have created a stronger,
more resilient business, with enhanced positions in a wide range
of growth markets. 
At 31 December 2007 we had a £16 billion order book, of which
£13.5 billion is for support services and Public Private Partnerships
projects, and a pipeline of probable new orders worth £3.6 billion. 
Key

Public Private Partnership projects
Middle East construction services
Construction services 
(excluding the Middle East)
The overall outlook in our principal market sectors in the UK 
and international regions, which are described in more detail 
on pages 4 to 11 of this report, is expected to remain positive. 
In summary
• the UK support services market is forecast to grow in real terms
by between two and three per cent per annum over the next
five years from £115 billion in 2007 to £130 billion by 2012
• we expect continuing opportunities for Public Private Partnership
projects in 2008 and over the medium term in both the 
UK and Canada and to continue to build a portfolio of good 
quality investments
• in the Middle East we expect our markets to remain very 
strong and we are confident of growing revenues from 
this region to over £600 million, from the 2007 level of 
£337 million, within the next two years, at margins of 
some six per cent
• the UK non-housing new-build construction market is 
forecast to grow in real terms by over two per cent per annum
over the next three years
• in Canada and the Caribbean we expect continuing healthy
growth driven by Public Private Partnership projects and roads
maintenance services. 
In view of the Group’s strengths and positive outlook, I believe 
we are well positioned to make further strong progress in 2008 
and deliver materially enhanced earnings in 2009.

Against a very challenging trading backdrop,
especially in the second half of the year, I am
pleased to report that Driver Group generated 
a pre-tax profit of £1.1m on sales of £20.5m.
While conditions in our core UK market were
generally very difficult, especially in the north 
of England, we saw continuing strong growth 
in our overseas business. In total, sales from
our Middle East business rose by 85% and
accounted for approximately 28% (2008: 17%) 
of the Group’s revenue for the year . In more
challenging markets, the Group benefited from
its breadth of service offering and an area of
focus for us was the growth of our expert
witness services both in the UK and Middle East.
In August, we were pleased to announce
significant changes to the Group’s operational
structure as well as changes to the Board.
These changes took effect after the year end, 
on 1 October 2009, and are part of our plans to
develop the business for growth over the next
three years. 
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenue over the twelve months to 
30 September 2009 increased by 13% to £20.5m
(2008: £18.2m). Underlying* profit before
taxation fell by £0.97m to £1.11m from £2.08m
in 2008. This is stated after the impact of a
charge of £0.3m for bad and doubtful debts
(2008: £0.1m) and one-off costs relating to 
cost base reductions amounting to £0.2m 
(2008: nil). After deducting the IFRS 2 charge 
for share-based payments which totalled
£59,000 (2008: £97,000), reported profit before
tax was £1.05m (2008: £1.98m).
Underlying* earnings per share were 3.4 pence
(2008: 6.3 pence). After deducting the share
based payments charge, reported earnings per
share were 3.2 pence (2008: 5.8 pence).
Cash generation remained healthy with net 
cash inflow from operating activities of £1.09m
(2008: £1.39m). The Group’s net borrowing
position at the end of the year stood at £0.2m,
largely unchanged from the prior year position
(30 September 2008: net borrowings of £0.2m)
and an improvement on the net borrowing
position on 31 March 2009 of £0.93m. 
DIVIDEND
The Board is pleased to recommend the
payment of a final dividend of 1.00p per share
(2008: 2.00p per share). This makes a total
dividend for the year of 2.00p (2008: 2.95p). 
The final dividend will be paid on 18 March to
shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 26 February. 
TRADING OVERVIEW
The trading environment during the financial
year has been very challenging reflecting the
wider economic conditions.
Trading by Driver Consult in the UK, which
accounted for approximately 53% of Group
revenues, was mixed. Our London office and 
the Southern regions performed in line with
management expectations, supported by 
growth in expert services work. By contrast, 
the performance of the northern region was
significantly below management projections 
due to the weakness of the regional
construction market, although we did see
growth in the provision of services to financial
institutions involved with distressed or 
insolvent businesses.
The Group is continuing to expand strongly
overseas, especially in the Middle East, which
was the main focus of our international push.
Revenues from the Middle East accounted for
28% of the Group’s total and showed year on
year growth of 85%, from £3.1m to £5.8m, with
segmental profits increasing by 80%. Although
the construction industry in Dubai has been
severely affected by the global recession, 
the expansion of our activities in Oman and 
Abu Dhabi more than offset the impact and 
we benefited, in particular, from increases in
expert witness services. While we experienced
some delays in the commencement of expected
contracts in the second half, prospects for

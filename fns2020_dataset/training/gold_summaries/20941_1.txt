 Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010
3
Introduction
I am pleased to report that the Group has had a satisfactory 
year in a challenging market.  The Group made an underlying 
profit of £1.3m before charging £1.8m for both share-based 
payments (IFRS 2) and one-off reorganisation costs giving 
rise to a loss before taxation of £0.5m (2009: profit £1.5m).  
The Group also generated cash from operations, before 
adjustment for movements in working capital, of £0.6m 
(2009: £2.3m).
Total revenues at £13.0m are on a par with the previous year 
(£13.1m) but based on a different mix with 53% derived from 
corporate finance fees and retainers (2009: 34%).  In the 
last few weeks of the financial year the Group secured two 
large corporate placings which raised some £98m for clients.  
Revenues generated by our Equities Division were down by 
29% to £6.1m from £8.6m.  This statistic was the result of a 
number of factors including reduced trading volumes in the 
London markets, lower returns from Institutions and increased 
competition from other exchange venues.
During the year the Group carried out a reorganisation which 
involved a number of staff leaving giving rise to costs for the 
Group of £0.7m.  We also revisited other overheads and some 
of these have also been rationalised.  This leaves the Group 
with a lower fixed overhead going forward and a refocused 
strategy at both Group and operating levels which is designed 
to deliver higher revenue per head. 
Financial Review
Revenue in the year ended 31 October 2010 was £13.0m 
compared to £13.1m in 2009.  The underlying profit before 
tax was £1.3m compared to £2.2m.  The loss before taxation, 
which is stated after charging share-based payments and 
reorganisation costs, was £0.5m and compares to a profit 
before taxation in 2009 of £1.5m.  Cash generation was 
strong with balances at the year end of £9.0m (2009: £10.5m) 
together with long market making positions of £3.0m (2009: 
£2.5m).  During the year the Company migrated settlement 
services from Pershing to BNP Paribas Securities Services and 
this necessitated a deposit of £0.6m to cover base collateral 
requirements.  Cash balances at the year end represented 
some 283% of our regulatory capital requirement.
The underlying earnings per share (before charging share 
based payments and reorganisation costs) was 2.4p compared 
to 8.0p in 2009.  The basic loss per share was 4.2p compared 
to earnings per share of 5.1p in 2009.
During the period between 5 November and 9 November 
2010 the Company purchased 1,933,521 ordinary shares of 
10p each at a price of 49p per share.  All of these shares will 
be held in Treasury.
Equities Division
Our Equities Division revenue decreased by 29% to £6.1m 
from £8.6m.  Whilst underlying commission levels fell by only 
4%, income from share placings and market making returns 
were lower than anticipated.
Corporate Finance
During the year we completed fifteen corporate finance 
transactions (2009: twelve) including ten M&A mandates, 
four secondary fundraisings and one IPO.  Including retainer 
income, total corporate finance revenues increased by some 
57% to £6.9m from £4.4m.
Outlook
The current year has started satisfactorily and Arden has 
completed one fundraising to date.  The Equities Division 
continues to see pressure on margins, as in the previous year, 
and the corporate finance pipeline whilst satisfactory, remains 
market dependent.  With tight cost control and a strong 
balance sheet a positive result for the full year is anticipated.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our staff 
for their commitment through challenging conditions.

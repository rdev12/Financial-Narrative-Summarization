Group Chief Executive’s overview
David Dutro
2008 was a year of significant accomplishments for Elementis, 
characterised by a strong financial performance and solid 
execution of our strategic initiatives. We continued to 
make good progress, with operating profit

 (‘EPS’), all 
demonstrating a positive trend. The Specialty Products 
business posted its best year ever in terms of financial 
performance. This record performance was even more 
notable given the recessionary pressure that became 
apparent in the second half, and particularly in the final 
quarter, of the year. At the core of Specialty Products’ 
ability to deliver these results is an unrelenting commitment 
to provide technically superior products and application 
support that helps our customers be more successful.
Our acquisition of Deuchem, an Asia Pacific based specialty 
additives company, is consistent with our strategic objective 
of growing the Specialty Products business. Deuchem has 
an excellent reputation in the market, driven by their superior 
technical service and product development capabilities. 
Deuchem’s complementary product portfolio, customer 
service culture and the opportunity to leverage combined 
technologies globally, make it an excellent fit. In addition 
we acquired the Yuhong organoclay business, which is 
located in China. The Yuhong acquisition provides valuable 
capacity and supply chain benefits and a competitive cost 
model, again making Yuhong a strong addition to the Specialty 
Products business. The combined resources and infrastructure 
of Elementis, Deuchem and Yuhong represent an enviable 
platform to support and drive our Asia Pacific growth.

business review
The Elementis Chromium business had a strong year, 
capitalising on the commodity boom and exceptional 
supply/ demand dynamics. The business also made excellent 
progress in 2008 relative to its strategic initiative of expanding 
the number of viable key raw material suppliers. One of the 
key strategic objectives for the Chromium business is to 
reduce its sensitivity to cyclical fluctuations, thereby improving 
the quality of the Group’s earnings. A significant percentage 
of the UK business earnings comes from supplying intermediate 
products to our US facilities. Over the last three years, 
incremental capacity expansions in our US business, through 
improvements in plant efficiencies and debottlenecking, have 
led to that business being less reliant on products from the 
UK, except in exceptional supply demand conditions such 
as those experienced in 2008. In addition, the evolution of 
the markets served by the UK business, which produces less 
differentiated products than our US business and is subject 
to growing competition from Asian producers, means that 
we are less confident of producing sustainable earnings 
and cash flow from this part of the business going forward. 
As a result, we have initiated a strategic review of the 
Chromium business which could lead to the closure of 
our Eaglescliffe, UK manufacturing facility, and we 
expect to make a final decision during the first half of 2009. 
Our desired outcome is a Chromium business that is better 
suited to deliver optimal performance, given the likely 
lower level of market demand going forward, with facilities 
capable of manufacturing products that deliver superior 
benefits to the customer base. 
I am proud of Elementis’ accomplishments in 2008 which 
are a direct reflection of the hard work and dedication 
of our global team and its performance driven culture. 
We expect the 2009 economic environment to be challenging 
and we are taking appropriate action on costs to mitigate 
the potential impact on earnings, particularly in the first half 
of the year. We will continue our pursuit of high performance 
and strive to take our Specialty Products business to the 
next level of market leadership. In an environment of 
economic uncertainty our market position is a distinct 
advantage and it is our goal to be positioned to fully exploit 
the eventual economic recovery. I would like to thank our 
shareholders and customers for their continued confidence 
and support.

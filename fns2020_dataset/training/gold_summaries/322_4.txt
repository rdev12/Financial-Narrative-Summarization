Business at a glance
The Group is structured as three complementary divisions, 
each with its own management team and portfolio of products 
and services. 
Health & Care is focussed on the provision of patient workflow 
management and case management solutions for out-of-hours 
and community care providers. Business Solutions supplies 
accounting and back office solutions to public sector 
organisations and the private sector. 365 Managed Services 
delivers services in support of the Group’s products and to a 
wide range of customers including financial services providers, 
local authorities and retail organisations.
The Group continues to look for opportunities to sell its core 
products in new markets and its mobile products for the 
healthcare sector – iNurse and iConnect, which are derived 
from the patient workflow management software, have been 
well received.
Cross-selling is an important revenue generator for the Group 
and a particular focus has been on the collaboration of the 
Business Solutions and 365 Managed Services divisions to offer 
integrated hosted solutions for local authorities allowing them 
to benefit from shared services arrangements.
The development of Cloud technology was a priority during 
the year and the Group has invested in new infrastructure  
and equipment for its datacentre to meet the anticipated 
demand for outsourcing as pressure mounts for businesses  
and organisations to reduce costs. Advanced Computer Software Group plc

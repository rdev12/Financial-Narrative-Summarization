ITE Group plc 
Annual Report 2006
Group performance
The Group has produced another impressive trading and
financial performance for the 2006 financial year . 
T urnover of £82.4 million was a 5% improvement on last year’ s
reported turnover of £78.5 million, and Headline profit before tax
of £26.0 million was ahead of the restated result for last year
(£25.3 million). This result was achieved despite lower interest
income following last year’ s share buyback and the £4.9 million
contribution in 2005 from non-annual events. Reported profit
before tax was £24.8 million (2005: £25.2 million) and fully
diluted earnings per share improved to 6.7p per share 
(2005: 6.6p).
Strategic progress
During the year the Group has continued to implement 
its strategy of pursuing organic growth and strengthening 
ITE’ s market leadership in key industry sectors supplemented
through selective earning enhancing acquisitions. In addition,
the excellent long-term relationships with our venues continue
to be of significance to our business. In Moscow the construction
event, MosBuild, grew into the newly constructed exhibition
space at Crocus, and in Almaty , Kazakhstan, the KazBuild
construction event was able to expand into the newly completed,
ITE supported, pavilion. In Kyiv the larger events, KievBuild 
and AgriHort, were both able to grow into the second phase
development at the IEC venue which was completed in 
January 2006. 
It is through the proven and established success of our 
sales and organising teams that ITE is now the independent
exhibition organiser of choice for venues in our markets.
Looking forward, I see another year of continued growth built
upon the relationships and contracts we have established. 
Board and management
There have been a number of changes to the Board during the
year . Marco Sodi stepped down in January following the sale 
by Veronis Suhler Stevenson of its remaining shareholding in
the Company . Malcolm Wall joined the Board as a non-executive
Director on 4 May 2006, and is a member of the Audit and
Remuneration Committees. Malcolm brings extensive
experience in the international B2B media and exhibitions
business. Since the year-end Ceyda Erem has tendered her
resignation as an ITE Board Director , although she will remain
Managing Director of our associate business in T urkey .
Ian T omkins has informed the Board that he wishes to relinquish
his role as Chief Executive at the end of 2007 for personal
reasons. The Nomination Committee will shortly be starting a
process to find his successor and will be meeting both internal
and external candidates. During his tenure Ian has made an
immense contribution to the remarkable success of the Group.
I would like to express my thanks to the management and staff
throughout the territories who have worked so hard to make
this result achievable. We employ 650 people of whom over
75% are local nationals, employed and working in Russia, 
the CIS and T urkey .
Chairman’ s statement
drive our business forward
Well placed to Dividend
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 2.5p per share,
making a total dividend for the year of 3.5p. This reflects an
increase of more than 25% over last year’ s total dividend and 
is in line with the Board’ s policy of increasing dividends in line
with the underlying earnings growth. 
Outlook
The continued expansion of the exhibition industry in Russia
and the CIS which has fuelled ITE’ s growth over the last few
years is set to continue. Strong economic conditions, ITE’ s
recognised international brands, our market leading position
and our dedicated and conscientious staff all place us in a 
very strong position to drive our business forward.

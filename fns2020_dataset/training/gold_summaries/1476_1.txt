tonnage due under legacy contracts and 
the reduction of debt, both of which will 
improve future shareholder value in the 
longer term. Given the increased costs of 
production, a review of both current and

undertaken with increased focus on 
mining lower ratio, higher quality coal 
reserves. Whilst several cost‑ saving 
initiatives targeted at reducing the Group’s 
operating cost structure are beginning to 
take effect, the major challenge for the 
Group remains the continued escalation 
in the price of gas oil at a time when 
income is constrained by the impact

in the international market price of coal 
but also from an improved mix. This policy 
has helped mitigate the impact of rising 
input costs and the unexpected geological 
conditions at Glenmuckloch and increased 
old workings at Muir Dean.
Alongside these operational challenges, 
the Group was faced with a rise of 28% 
in the price of gas oil, its single largest 
input cost. Prices have risen by a further 
5% since the year end, in part driven by 
adverse movements in the value of the 
US dollar. Furthermore, following an 
increase in international rubber prices, 
the cost of replacement tyres has increased 
by 15% in the second half of the year with 
further rises anticipated during 2012.
During the year the Group invested 
some £8.0 million in successfully opening 
its new operation at Netherton. Although 
quantities of heat affected coal in the 
initial areas impacted on both volume 
and quality, this site contributed nearly 
30% of the Group’s total production 
in 	 t h e 	 p a s t 	 fi n an c i a l 	 y e ar . 	 W i t h 	 t h e 	 s i te 	
now in full production and operations 
having advanced away from the heat 
affected areas, Netherton is expected 
to account for over 37% of the current 
year’s production.
In spite of these challenging conditions 
the Group was still able to report an 
o p e r at in g 	 p r o fi t 	 b e f o r e 	 e x c e p t i o n a l 	
charges of £3.0 million (2010: £7.0 million).
After making capital investments of 
£10.6 million, the Group has continued to 
reduce debt to £31.5 million, a reduction 
of £3.0 million in the year. This is the third 
consecutive year debt levels have reduced.
Legacy contracts
One of the features of the Group’s 
business is the supply of coal contracted 
to the Electricity Supply Industry (“ESI”) 
at 	 fi x e d 	 p r i c e s 	 w h i c h 	 ar e 	 b e l o w 	 c u r r e n t 	
market prices. Since the year end the 
Group has been able to successfully 
re‑ negotiate improved terms for one 
of these contracts which will increase 
average selling prices. 
This year around 32% of sales volumes 
were supplied to satisfy these contracts. 
It remains a key priority for ATH to meet 
these commitments as quickly as possible. 
Consequently the Group remains on track 
t o	c o m p l e te	t h e	fi r s t	o f	t h e s e	c o n t r a c t s	
in March 2012 with a second due to be 
completed the following year. Legacy 
volumes will then fall to around 15% 
of annual sales volumes.
“Greater emphasis has been placed on fulfilling the 
supply of tonnage due under legacy contracts and 
the reduction of debt, both of which will improve 
future shareholder value in the longer term.”

01–13
Coal reserves and mine development
Following the successful opening of 
Netherton, the Group commenced 
its initial site preparations to develop 
Duncanziemere, which is expected 
to become fully operational this year. 
In addition, the Group was successful 
in achieving planning permission for 
extensions at Glenmuckloch and Muir 
Dean for 505,000 tonnes and 350,000 
tonnes respectively, both of which 
form part of current production plans.
As at 2 October 2011 the Group had 
5.0 million tonnes proved reserves (2010: 
6.1 million tonnes) and probable reserves 
of 2.9 million tonnes (2010: 2.5 million 
tonnes). The table overleaf, relating to 
exploration results, mineral resources or 
mineral reserves is based upon information 
compiled by Peter Morgan, a full time 
employee of the Group who is a Fellow 
of the Institute of Materials, Minerals 
an d	M in in g .	M r	M o r g a n	h a s	s u f fi c i e n t

of mineralisation and type of deposit 
under consideration. He has reviewed 
and consents to the inclusion in this report 
of the matters based on his information 
in the form and context in which they 
appear. A glossary of terms is available 
on the Group’s website www.ath.co.uk.
In addition to the table overleaf, estimated 
resources in excess of 11 million tonnes 
have been secured through various licence 
agreements for sites where additional 
geological and planning work is required 
t o	c o n fi r m	w i t h	a	r e a s o n a b l e	l e v e l	o f	
certainty the tonnages available to mine.
The Group is anticipating bringing forward 
over 2 million tonnes into the planning 
process during the next twelve months.
Production this year exceeded new sites entering the planning 
system and therefore year end proved and probable reserves were 
lower at 7.9 million tonnes (2010: 8.6 million tonnes). During the 
next 12 months it is expected that new applications totalling 
around 2 million tonnes will enter the planning system.

Staff
The Board would like to join me in thanking 
all of our management and employees 
for their unstinting efforts and support 
throughout this challenging period.
Summary
The Group is expecting an improved 
performance in the current year, together 
with further reductions in bank debt. 
However, the trading environment remains 
a challenging one, with the high cost of 
gas oil expected to continue and, in the 
short term, coal prices easing from their 
earlier peak.
Alistair Black
Chief Executive
Coal prices
International coal prices rose sharply in 
t h e	fi r s t	h a l f	o f	l a s t	y e ar	t o	a	p e ak	o f	$ 1 3 0	
per tonne but have since fallen back by 
around 20%. The evident disconnect 
between coal and oil prices over the past 
few months will, if it persists, put further 
pressure on margins for the Group; 
however, the recent re‑ negotiation of the 
Group’s remaining legacy contracts will 
help alleviate the potential impact.
Health and safety
The Board understands the potential 
hazardous nature of the work undertaken 
in surface mining. The Group takes its 
responsibilities for health and safety 
levels very seriously and strives to 
continually improve the safety levels 
in all of its operations. 
ATH has been successful in maintaining 
its RoSPA Gold award and OHSAS 
accreditation from BSI for health and 
safety standards in 2011, recognising 
the Group’s continued commitment 
to creating the safest possible 
working environment. 
Each Mine Manager has the necessary 
qu a l i fi c at i o n s	an d	c o m p e te n c e	t o	m an a g e	
operations safely and has assistance from 
a dedicated Health and Safety Manager.
Regular training is provided to employees 
in respect of the Group’s procedures with 
85% of the Group’s workforce attaining 
grade NVQ level 2, delivered by our own 
accredited training centre.

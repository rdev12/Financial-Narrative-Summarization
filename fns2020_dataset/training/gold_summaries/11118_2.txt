Next Fifteen continues to look at the most  
effective way to communicate with its  
shareholders and other stakeholders. Following 
positive feedback, we have once again created 
an enhanced online annual report that can be 
found on our website, www.nextfifteen.com and 
would urge you to take a look at the case studies 
showing some of the work we do for our clients.
It would be great to hear feedback from shareholders 
on the Annual Report or any other aspect of the  
business. We would be happy to answer questions 
from shareholders at any time rather than waiting  
for the Annual General Meeting in January.
We look forward to hearing from you.

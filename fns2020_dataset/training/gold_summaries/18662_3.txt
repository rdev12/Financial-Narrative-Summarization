Chairman’s Statement
A particular feature of these results is 
the significant increase in year-end cash 
balances, demonstrating the ability of 
our business to benefit from previous 
capital expenditure and generate 
significant cash flow. As the current 
capital expenditure programme is now 
largely complete, it has been decided 
to return some of the group’s surplus 
cash to shareholders as a special 
dividend.
Overview
Group revenues in the year were up 
3.0% at £654.1 million. In the UK, which 
represented 88% of group sales in 
the year, revenues were up 4.9% at 
£575.3 million, reflecting organic and 
acquisitive growth. 
On a like for like basis, UK revenues 
were up 3.9% at £570.0 million. The 
growth in the second half was less than 
the first half increase of 5.4%, reflecting 
in part strong second half comparatives 
in 2014. The group has again delivered 
organic growth in excess of the UK 
floorcoverings market, which for 2015 
is forecast to be 3.4% (Source: AMA 
Research Limited).
Revenues from the Continental 
European businesses were down 3.8% 
in constant currency at £83.6 million. 
The second half decrease of 2.7% 
was less than the first half decrease 
of 4.8%, indicating that trading had 
begun to stabilise and improve. On 
translation to sterling, Continental 
European revenues were down 9.3% at 
£78.7 million. Whilst European markets 
remain challenging for the group, they 
represent a decreasing proportion of 
group revenues, at just 12.0% during 
2015 (2014: 13.7%).
 
Since the year end, 
the aggregate revenue performance 
from the three Continental territories, 
France, Switzerland and the 
Netherlands, in constant currency, has 
improved by 1.5%.
One bolt-on acquisition was completed 
during the year, Matty’s Wholesale 
Carpets, a Midlands-based distributor 
of residential floorcoverings to 
independent flooring retailers. The 
acquisition, completed on 30 January 
2015, has been earnings enhancing. 
The group continues to evaluate 
potential bolt-on acquisitions in line 
with its growth strategy.
 
The group also 
continued to invest in the development 
of its operations, including the opening 
of a showroom in Clerkenwell, London, 
as a marketing base for Headlam 
Corporate, a new business unit 
targeting specifiers of commercial 
flooring. The group also added to its 
network of service centres, opening 
a new service centre in Cheltenham 
in July 2015. During March 2016, two 
additional service centres are expected 
to open in Croydon and Hull which 
would bring the total to 31.
Earnings and dividend
Basic earnings per share for the year 
increased by 18.2% to 33.8 pence (2014: 
28.6 pence), reflecting an increase of 
17.6% in the group’s profit before tax to 
£35.6 million. 
The board is proposing to increase the 
final ordinary dividend by 19.5% from 
12.30 pence to 14.70 pence resulting 
in a total ordinary dividend for the 
year of 20.70p, which represents an 
increase on 2014 of 18.3%.
 
The final 
dividend, if approved by shareholders 
at the group’s Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”), will be paid on 1 July 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 3 June 2016.
Special dividend
Throughout the downturn in the UK 
floorcoverings market between 2008 
and 2011, the group continued to 
invest in its infrastructure, particularly 
in its distribution centre network. This 
capital expenditure programme, which 
has positioned the group to benefit 
from operational gearing as markets 
improve, is now largely complete. The 
final significant investment currently 
intended as previously announced, is 
a major distribution centre in Ipswich 
with an estimated project cost of £13.5 
million. Construction of this project 
has been delayed as a result of the 
planning process but work is now 
expected to begin in the latter half of 
this year.
The revised timing for the construction 
of the Ipswich facility, and its effect 
on the amount of capital expenditure 
this year, has created the opportunity 
to pay a special dividend, which the 
board believes is the best way to return 
surplus capital to shareholders. The 
board has therefore declared that 
a special dividend of 6.0 pence per 
ordinary share shall be paid on 25 April 
2016 to shareholders on the register at 
8 April 2016. 
I am pleased to report that 2015 was another year of good 
progress at Headlam. It was a year that delivered good 
growth in revenues and profitability, reflecting positive trends 
in the group’s marketplace in the UK along with further 
progress in the delivery of the group’s strategy.

We continue to promote a culture

The board recognises the 
value derived from good governance

employees, suppliers and customers.
On 31 May 2015, after serving over 
nine years as a non-executive director, 
Mike O’Leary resigned from the board.
 
On behalf of the board, I would like 
to thank Mike for his commitment 
and participation and we wish him 
well for the future.
 
Philip Lawrence 
was appointed to the board with 
effect from 1 June 2015, at which time 
he was appointed as a member of 
the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees and Chairman of the 
Audit Committee.
 
Also, with effect 
from 1 June 2015, Andrew Eastgate 
stepped down as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee and was appointed

Independent Director. 
Following a competitive tender process 
and a recommendation from the Audit 
Committee, the board has invited 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) 
to accept appointment as auditor in 
respect of the group’s accounts for the 
year ended 31 December 2016.
 
The 
appointment is in line with guidance in 
the 2014 Corporate Governance Code.
 
The board would like to thank KPMG 
for their services to the group since 
1992 and look forward to working with 
PwC in the future.
Employees and shareholders
Once again, our employees’ 
commitment and determination 
has been pivotal to the continued 
success of the group. Thank you to all 
our employees across the group for 
their dedication and hard work and

support.

% of total Group 
(excluding associates and other revenue)
Dairy Crest has the leading cheese 
brand in the UK, Cathedral City, 
and a world-class cheese supply 
chain. Cathedral City is made at our 
Davidstow creamery in Cornwall from 
milk supplied by local dairy farmers. 
The cheese is matured, cut and 
wrapped at our purpose-built facility  
in Nuneaton from where it is 
despatched to retailers. We also have 
a smaller cheese packing facility at 
Frome, Somerset which provides the 
business with additional flexibility.
We process and deliver fresh 
conventional, organic and flavoured 
milk to major retailers, ‘middle ground’ 
customers including smaller retailers, 
coffee shops and hospitals and 
residential customers.
 We also manufacture and sell FRijj, 
the leading fresh flavoured milk brand, 
cream and milk powders.

ATH at a glance
From exploration to restoration, ATH Resources 
develops, operates and restores surface coal mines.
One of the largest producers of coal in the UK, producing close to 2 million 
tonnes per annum. 
Coal was used to generate around a third of the UK’s electricity in 2010 and the 
Company holds coal supply contracts with nearly all of the UK’s main electricity 
generating companies.

quality coal for economic extraction. Formal planning 
applications are prepared and submitted to replace the 
Group’s current coal production with new reserves, 
securing the long term sustainability of the business.

How do we produce?
The Group utilises modern plant and equipment to extract coal 
deposits from surface mines. The majority of coal is used in the 
power generation industry, whilst premium coals are supplied 
to the industrial and domestic markets, making the Group 
one of the largest producers of household coal in the UK.
How do we restore?
The Group, working closely with third parties including Local 
Authorities and Environmental Agencies, utilises innovative 
techniques to minimise its impact on the environment. 
Surface mines undergo progressive restoration during coal 
extraction and, following the completion of mining activities, 
l a n d	is	r e t u r n e d	t o	an	a g r e e d	c o n d i t i o n	an d	p r o fi l e .	
Efficient production and distribution 
of coal to our customers.
We are committed to the restoration 
of our sites once production is complete.

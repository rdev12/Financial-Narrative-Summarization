Chairman’s Statement
This is our first year-end report since listing in June 2015 
and I am pleased to be able to report good progress against 
the Group’s strategic priorities, and that this has resulted in 
increased sales and improving profitability.
On behalf of the Board I would like to 
begin by thanking the shareholders who 
supported the Group on its Initial Public 
Offering on AIM in June 2015 raising 
£10.3m, and also to welcome new 
shareholders who have subsequently 
acquired shares. Like myself, you will 
have recognised Gear4music’s potential 
to become a leading online retailer in a 
large but fragmented market.
I am very pleased to report that during 
our first year as a public company, we 
achieved many of the objectives we set 
ourselves, and in many ways performed 
ahead of our expectations. Overall sales 
growth was 46% including 73% growth 
in our European markets, and we 
delivered a £519,000 improvement in 
underlying operating profit whilst 
gearing up for continued expansion. 
This was a particularly impressive 
achievement given the efforts required 
to complete a successful IPO, and is a 
reflection of the commitment, drive and 
ambition of our Board and Senior 
Management team. 05

During the year we recruited new talent 
into our team, in HR, marketing, 
purchasing, and multilingual customer 
services, and we have further new 
members starting soon to help us  
focus our drive into European markets. 
A number of these recruits have been 
Senior Management appointments to 
support the Executive team.
We remain committed to improving our 
customer proposition, through 
investment in software development to 
accelerate the release of new website 
systems and functionality, and 
expanding our product ranges to provide 
more choice for our customers, as well 
as incorporating new delivery options.
We are confident we have laid the 
foundations for long-term, sustainable, 
profitable growth, and in light of our 
anticipated strengthening position, the 
Board commits to review its dividend 
policy in the financial year ending  
28th February 2017.
On behalf of the whole Board, I would 
like to take this opportunity to extend my 
thanks and appreciation to all 
Gear4music’s employees for their 
commitment and hard work which has 
made our first year as a public company 
such a success.

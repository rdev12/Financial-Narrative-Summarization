 Chairman’s Statement
Alan Burns
Non-Executive Chairman and Founder
2010 was a busy year for Bahamas 
Petroleum Company and this success  
has continued into 2011 with our  
successful equity placing in March  
raising £45.6 million before expenses.
Dear Shareholder,
The oil business is one of the largest 
industries in the world and nations  
are divided into those that have oil 
and those that do not. Whilst there 
are strong geophysical indications  
of oil in our licence areas the only 
proof that there are deposits is to drill 
to find out. Noting that, The Bahamas 
has been drilled in the past and there 
is considerable drilling scheduled for 
this year in Cuban waters next to four 
of our licence areas, which gives us 
great encouragement. As we would 
expect, following the BP Macondo oil 
spill in April 2010, there has been a 
drive to update laws and regulations. 
We welcome this and understand the 
process is underway. We would only 
consider a drilling campaign under 
accepted international standards and 
procedures. In order to prepare, we 
have already taken the initiative and 
are undertaking an environmental 
impact assessment of our southern 
awarded licence and Cay Sal licence 
application areas.
We believe there is great incentive  
for drilling, both in terms of the 
requirement for oil products locally 
and for the oil revenues that the 
successful development of any oil  
find would bring for The Bahamas. 
For instance, The Bahamas 
government has recently revealed  
that the half-year Budget recurrent 
revenue estimates were down by  
a sum greater than 1% of gross 
domestic product (GDP). The 
Commonwealth of The Bahamas  
is particularly susceptible to oil 
pricing and imported supply  
as it is an archipelago with a 
dispersed population all relying on  
oil to provide their connection to the 
wider world. The islands are also 
highly dependent on tourism as a 
source of employment, which itself 
would not be possible without the 
supply of oil and gas for powering 
hotels, restaurants and other key 
tourist-related infrastructure. 
Furthermore, The Bahamas has been 
directly engaged in the oil trade for 
decades, with the major storage 
terminals on Grand Bahama providing 
significant revenues for the country  
so exploration activity can be viewed  
as an extension of its participation  
in the oil industry.
Bahamas Petroleum Company plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 6 We are pleased that we have found 
very promising structures in southern 
Bahamas waters remote from any 
Bahamian population and near the 
maritime border with Cuba. Cuba has 
announced that it will be drilling a 
number of wells in its waters adjacent 
to our licences and we are planning  
to drill our first well in 2012. While we 
have the right, we also have an 
obligation to drill our first well and are 
fortunate that the Commonwealth of 
The Bahamas is a nation with a well 
respected legal system, with our 
licences having been approved by 
two successive governments and 
signed into existence by both the 
Minister and the Governor General.  
Of course, post the Macondo blowout 
we would expect some improved 
drilling and environmental regulations 
to be in place prior to drilling 
commencing next year. 
Although the probable target is as 
good as I have ever seen in 40 years 
in the oil business we cannot be 
certain of anything until it is drilled.  
If it becomes a discovery, The 
Bahamas’ economy will be changed 
rapidly, bringing enormous benefits  
to every Bahamian. We are very 
enthusiastic about drilling and  
I thank you all for your support over 
the years with the many delays this 
extraordinary project has suffered. 
On 17 January 2011, we announced 
that Paul Crevello would take over  
my role as Chief Executive and that  
I would move to the role of Non-
Executive Chairman. This has been 
planned for some time but was 
brought forward due to my having 
been diagnosed with a medical 
condition which required surgery 
followed by a period of rehabilitation.  
I am pleased to note that we already 
had a succession plan in place.  
Paul had already been enlarging  
his team in The Bahamas and I had 
been enlarging the engineering team, 
readying the Company for the  
drilling programme. Accordingly  
the Company has not suffered from 
my illness. In addition, Mike Proffitt  
is taking a more active role as  
Finance Director.
We have been extremely fortunate in 
recruiting some fine young Bahamians 
and I feel certain they will greatly help 
to take the Company forwards into 
the future.
2011 is set to be a strong year for  
the Company and we look forward  
to updating you on our progress  
in due course.
In closing, I would like to thank 
shareholders for their support during 
the year and for the many best wishes 
I have received. I also appreciate the 
cooperation of the government of  
The Bahamas over the years and  
wish all Bahamians the very best  
for the future.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Burns

The three businesses, Explore 
(UK), Djoser (the Netherlands) and 
RegalDive (UK) are market leaders 
in ‘soft adventure’ and scuba diving 
holidays. 
Explore provides small group escorted tours to 
approximately  30 countries worldwide. Djoser 
offers escorted tours in 85 countries and is one of  
the largest adventure holiday operators in 
mainland Europe. Bookings come direct, through 
specialist and overseas agents and increasingly 
via the internet. The cost base is flexible and cash 
generation and margins are attractive. 
The division provides self-catering 
holidays in mobile-homes and tents 
pre-sited on high quality European 
camp-sites. 
Customers, predominantly families, come from the 
UK, the Netherlands, Germany and seven other 
European countries. Sales are mainly direct, via 
the internet or through high street travel agents. 
Eurocamp and Keycamp are the market leading 
brands in the sector. Customer satisfaction and 
repeat booking levels are strong, with high margins 
and healthy returns on capital.
The division provides domestic and 
overseas short-break holidays primarily 
for UK and Dutch consumers. 
Superbreak provides leisure hotel stays for UK 
customers. Bookings come through UK high street 
travel agents, direct by phone and via the internet. 
Bookit is the market leading online intermediary for

very strong cash flows.

 Strengthening our Leading Position
The year under review has seen a step change  
in the progress and development of our Group. 
This has been a year of significant investment, 
with £24.4 million spent on building and 
acquiring nine new centres and maintaining  
the premium facilities in our existing estate.  
This investment consolidates our leading  
position in this sector and provides the basis  
for growth in the new financial year and beyond. 
Acquisition of Soccer Domes
On 26 February 2008, we completed the 
acquisition of JJB Soccer Domes from  
JJB Sports plc. JJB Soccer Domes was the  
third largest 5-a-side football operator in the 
United Kingdom. We paid £17.4 million in cash,  
derived from existing resources and increased 
banking facilities.
The acquisition comprised five purpose-built 
indoor soccer centres with a total of 70 pitches. 
The centres are located in Manchester, Wigan, 
Derby, Blackburn and North Shields and are 
highly complementary to Powerleague’s existing 
portfolio and pipeline of sites. The Manchester 
centre is the largest 5-a-side football centre in  
the world with 19 indoor and four outdoor pitches. 
We are very satisfied with the progress we have 
made to date. Powerleague’s management 
techniques and bespoke booking systems 
have been successfully implemented and we 
are beginning to see efficiency and synergistic 
benefits flowing through. These new centres not 
only extend our reach, but now make us unique 
in providing both outdoor and indoor purpose-
built 5-a-side facilities to our customers.
£23.1 million investment by Patron 
Capital Partners (‘Patron’)
In March 2008, we announced that Patron 
Capital, a leading private equity and property 
investment fund, had acquired a 29% stake in 
Powerleague.
I believe that our strategic alliance with Patron 
will bring significant benefits, given its wealth of 
experience in the property sector, coupled with 
its wide network of global relationships which 
will help us unlock further growth opportunities 
for our business in the UK and our potential 
expansion of 5-a-side into Europe.
Dividends 
The Board recommends a final dividend of  
1.1 pence per share, which is in line with that 
paid in 2007. We believe that this strikes the right 
balance between dividends and retaining cash 
in the business until there is greater clarity on 
the direction of the UK economy. The dividends, 
if approved, will be paid on 1 December 2008 to 
shareholders on the register at close of business 
on 7 November 2008.
Development Programme
In addition to the acquisition of the Soccer 
Domes, we have opened four new centres, 
thereby adding a further thirty 5-a-side pitches 
and three 7-a-side pitches to our portfolio, all 
with ‘next generation’ playing surfaces.

centre with four pitches in the heart of the 
City of London.

January 2008 and added six 5-a-side 
pitches and one 7-a-side pitch.
 
Board Changes
As a result of the Patron investment, we have 
strengthened our Board with the appointment  
of two non-executive directors with effect from  
14 March 2008:
Paul Orchard-Lisle – Paul has a wealth of 
experience in the property sector, having 
previously been Senior Partner of Healey & Baker, 
President of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors and Chairman of Slough Estates plc. 
He is currently Chairman of Falcon Property Trust, 
a director of Standard Life Property Income Trust, 
Director of Trinity Capital PLC and Chairman of 
Crown Golf UK, the largest operator of golf clubs 
in Europe.
Keith M Breslauer – Keith is the founder and 
Managing Director of Patron Capital Limited and 
related Patron entities. He has over 20 years’ 
experience in Corporate and Property Investment 
and has held senior investment banking 
positions in New York and London.
At the end of June 2008, Jeremy Hall, our 
Development Director, resigned as a director  
of the Company. We would like to thank Jeremy 
for his contribution to the development of 
Powerleague over the years.
I am once again delighted to be able to report  
another year of significant revenue and EBITDA  
growth for Powerleague.

04 Post Balance Sheet Event
In August 2008, we announced that we 
had acquired Soccer Sensations Limited, an 
established 5-a-side football centre located 
in Stockton-on-Tees. This centre has excellent 
facilities with ten ‘next generation’ 5-a-side 
pitches and its geographic location complements 
Powerleague’s portfolio of 43 centres around 
the UK.
Prospects and Outlook 
Whilst the economic outlook in the UK is 
uncertain, we believe that the Group has 
developed a resilient market and financial 
position. Trading during the first three months of 
the new financial year has continued to be in line 
with our expectations. Pitch revenues, our core 
business and key income driver, remain strong 
while the sector-wide reduction in bar revenues 
continues to impact the Group. 
We have enjoyed a healthy growth in 
sponsorship and events over the past few years 
and I anticipate that the Group will deliver further 
progress in this area in the new financial year.
For the current financial year, our focus is to grow 
revenue in the four centres we opened in the 
financial year and complete the integration and 
maximise the potential of the Soccer Domes and 
Soccer Sensations acquisitions, whilst ensuring 
that our established centres continue to prosper. 
I am confident we have the management team 
and wherewithal to achieve these objectives.
In addition, we continue to increase our pipeline 
of potential new sites and move them along 
the development process. These initiatives will 
enable us to maintain or accelerate our roll out 
programme. We have a number of strategically 
located high quality sites with no commercial 
competition under agreement to lease. In time 
these will come to fruition and add significant 
value to the Group.
 
I would like to take the opportunity to thank our 
staff for their hard work, dedication and loyalty, 
and I want to thank our bankers HBOS, who have 
been so supportive of our growth strategy over 
many years and with whom we have developed 
an excellent working relationship.

Chief Executive’s Review
This has been a “watershed” year for Inland 
Homes. The Group has made significant 
progress on all fronts including the land bank, 
housebuilding, profitability and financing.
Our operational focus is in the south of England 
with an emphasis on creating well designed 
homes in sustainable communities. The land 
portfolio meets the needs of a wide range of 
purchasers, from first time buyers to investors, 
with a product range that includes houses, 
apartments, commercial units and the sale of 
selected building plots to other developers.
Not only have we delivered a strong set of 
results but have put in place the foundations for 
further growth. We have implemented a clear 
strategy alongside a substantially improved 
housing market in the areas of our operations.
As stated in the Chairman’s Statement, we 
have dramatically increased the scale of our 
housebuilding activities, with 348 homes being 
constructed by Inland Homes and a further 138 
homes by DGVL with forward sales of in the 
order of £46.3 million. Our homes range from 
£160,000 to £400,000 making them ideal for first 
time buyers and investors alike. This price band 
is ideal for demand from purchasers using the 
Government’s “Help to Buy” funding initiative.
Whilst the planning system remains difficult, we 
secured our goals on the following key sites 
where valuable planning permissions were 
achieved:
Carter’s Quay, Poole, Dorset
268 homes with no affordable housing as well 
as 100,000 sq ft of commercial space.
St John’s Hospital, Chelmsford
101 homes including 12 substantial detached 
houses backing on to the golf course.
Drayton Garden Village, West Drayton 
(managed by Inland Homes)
A 4,000 sq ft neighbourhood store pre-let to 
Sainsbury’s.
Despite the considerable management time 
taken up in increasing the housebuilding 
programme to these new levels, I am pleased 
to say that our land acquisition programme has 
continued unabated. Notable sites secured in 
the course of the year were:
Markyate, St Albans, Hertfordshire
Consent for 40 residential units.
High Street, Amersham, Buckinghamshire
Strategic land with an option over 4.8 acres.
Callis Yard, Woolwich, London
Acquired with a lapsed resolution to grant 
planning consent for 177 units — acquired from 
receivers.
Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire
Consent for 26 residential units.
Europa Way, Ipswich
Acquired with an expired consent for 218 units 
 — acquired from receivers. 
Vale Road, Bushey, Hertfordshire
Option land assembly — planning application 
submitted for 41 units.
Swallow Street, Iver, Buckinghamshire
Option over former garden centre with potential 
for 18 houses.
Station Road, Gerrards Cross, 
Buckinghamshire
Two existing vacant office blocks to be 
converted into 33 units under the Government’s 
“prior approval notification” procedure. Read more online

“Inland Homes is a leading developer of 
sustainable mixed use communities with a 
strong focus on brownfield regeneration on 
complex sites. Our strategic move to increase 
the Group’s housebuilding activities has 
proved to be particularly well timed.”

Chief Executive’s Review continued
The Winter Gardens, Bournemouth
Acquisition of two key office buildings forming 
part of a major mixed use proposal in the  
town centre.
Former pub, Farnborough, Hampshire
Option over a site suitable for 60 units.
Reading Road, Henley on Thames
Acquisition of a 1.3 acre brownfield site with 
scope for up to 50 units.
Chessmount Rise, Chesham, 
Buckinghamshire
A 0.9 acre site secured under an option. Site 
allocated for development with a scheme for  
14 units already submitted.
The growth in activity during the year has 
resulted in an increase in the number of staff 
(including Directors) to 22. The increase is 
primarily due to new project managers and  
sales staff.
During the course of the year a decision was 
made by management to terminate discussions 
regarding a joint venture to develop 152 units 
with a major housebuilder on our Ashford 
Hospital project (now branded as “West Plaza”). 
We are now building this scheme as principals 
and have already achieved a good level of 
forward sales prior to the opening of a sales 
centre. The construction is fully funded by a 
senior debt bank facility.
Another major project taking up considerable 
amounts of management time was our 
“flagship” development proposal at Wilton 
Park, Beaconsfield. As shareholders will recall, 
Inland Homes acquired the only viable access 
supported by the Local Authority and achieved 
“special purchaser status” with the Ministry of 
Defence, being the owners of the development 
land (the former Defence School of Languages). 
This site is allocated in the local plan for up 
to 300 homes and a substantial amount of 
commercial space. Work is now advanced 
on the production of a planning brief for the 
development of the land in conjunction with the 
Local Authority, South Bucks District Council.
It is envisaged a planning permission will be 
achieved by the spring of 2015.
Drayton Garden Village (managed by  
Inland Homes)
During the course of the year, the installation 
of major infrastructure and landscaping works 
continued at Drayton Garden Village and the 
Garden Village concept that was envisaged is 
becoming a reality.
Notable events were the sale of 76 plots to 
Bellway Homes, a pre-let of commercial space 
to a leading food retailer and a forward sale of 
107 units to Paradigm Housing Association.
Inland Homes is also managing the 
development of 32 residential units for private 
sale, of which 80% are sold. DGVL is planning 
to keep development continuity by starting a 
further phase of 41 units for sale in this  
calendar year.
Shareholders will be aware that we decided 
to sell our stake in Howarth Homes plc 
(“Howarth”) which was achieved at a profit of 
£292,000. We successfully completed our joint 
venture with Howarth at Croxley Green, Herts 
with the last unit being sold in October 2013. 
The Group has also achieved the repayment 
of all loans to Howarth. Howarth will continue 
as one of our main contractors as part of our 
housebuilding programme.
Summary and prospects
2013 has laid the foundations to deliver a 
successful set of results for the new financial 
year. There is a strong pipeline of new land 
opportunities being investigated by our team, 
although we are extremely discerning as to 
which projects fit our criteria for purchase. We 
are confident that a number of high quality new 
sites will be secured in the current financial year 
and will continue to add value to our projects by 
navigating them through the intricate planning 
system. Inland Homes will also capture the 
development margin on some of its sites by 
delivering successful housing schemes.
In summary, I am confident that our strategy 
will increase the value of our asset base in the 
medium term and deliver sound prospects for 
our shareholders.

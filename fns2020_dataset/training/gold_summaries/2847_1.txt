Martin K May – Chief Executive
Introduction
Cape delivered on its promises in 2009 
with another solid year of progress, 
winning high quality contracts right 
across our footprint and delivering real 
value for our customers. This focus on 
operational excellence has been 
achieved at the same time as exceeding 
our targets for both cost savings and 
debt reduction. 
Adjusted profi t before tax
(1)
 increased 
by 25.7% to £60.7 million (2008: 
£48.3 million) refl ecting a £5.7 million 
reduction in fi nance costs to £12.3 million 
(2008: £18.0 million) and £8.1 million 
benefi t from favourable foreign exchange 
movements.
Cape has again continued to deliver 
margin progression, demonstrating the 
resilience of our business model. The 
Group’s revenues are largely derived 
from maintenance works and large 
scale Engineering and Construction 
(E&C) projects in the Oil Field Services 
(OFS) and mining services sectors. 
Maintenance spending is an essential 
operating expense of plant operators and 
therefore impacted less by short-term 
changes in the macro environment. 
Developing people and 
organisational capability
Strong progress was made in 2009 in 
driving through initiatives to strengthen 
senior operational and functional 
management across the Group.
We have strengthened the Key 
Management Group with the 
appointment of a number of Regional 
Operations Directors, CFOs and HR 
professionals during the year. Cape’s 
Key Management Group now comprises 
36 executives across the business. In 
addition, the rolling out of structured 
Performance Development Review 
processes and other HR process 
improvements have greatly added to 
the assessment and development of 
the Cape management pool.
During the course of 2009, we continued 
to review and make changes to the 
Group’s operating business unit structure 
to ensure all business units remained 
appropriately sized and resourced to 
achieve success in the current market 
conditions.
Also throughout 2009 steps were taken 
to create stronger linkage between the 
Group’s commercial and fi nancial 
processes and improve the internal 
control and reporting environment. 
Greater rigour has been introduced to 
fi nancial review processes across the 
Group under the direct control of the 
Group CFO. In Australia, we have 
carried out a major Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) systems implementation 
creating a common platform across the 
acquired businesses. 
Finally, we have made progress with 
building a more structured Business 
Development capability within the 
Group and I expect further developments 
in this area in 2010.

Regional overview
The Group continues to manage its 
business on a geographical basis with 
12 business units reporting into four 
geographic regions. See fi gure 1.
As reported at the half year, the 
proportion of Group profi ts generated 
from outside the UK continued to grow 
and now represents 68% of adjusted 
EBITA
(11)
 before central costs (2008: 
63%). The Gulf/Middle East was the key 
growth region in the year, driven by 
signifi cant maintenance shutdown and 
project E&C activity particularly in Qatar.
Our results in the Far East/Pacifi c Rim, 
principally Australia, were adversely 
impacted by the Group’s exposure to the 
weak commercial and residential scaffold 
hire markets, the deferral of projects in 
the mining services sector and delays to 
Pluto LNG, the one large scale oil and 
gas project currently in progress.
The performance of each of the four 
regions is discussed further in the 
Operating Review.
Safety fi rst and last
Safety is a way of life at Cape. No matter 
how hazardous the environments in 
which we work, we believe that every 
accident is preventable. We have 
in place a world-class sustainable 
safety framework which governs every 
managed operation and project. Total 
recordable lost time injury frequency 
rates have been reduced by 35% since 
2007 or an average reduction of around 
18% each year, including dramatic 
improvements at acquired operations. 
This is very pleasing and an indication 
of our businesses’ success in prioritising 
safety resources at the site level and in 
encouraging a strong safety culture.
Outlook and prospects
Our clients have sought to reduce costs 
whilst maintaining productivity and safety 
performance. Cape will continue to assist 
them to achieve these objectives by 
specifi cally tailoring the scope of the 
services provided and adopting more 
fl exible pricing mechanisms.
Looking ahead, we do not expect to 
see a signifi cant change in the Group’s 
overall activity levels this year. We will aim 
to continue to improve customer service 
and lay the foundations for a return to 
higher growth levels in 2011 and beyond.

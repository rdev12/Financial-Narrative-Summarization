Chief Executive’s Review
Operational overview
The Group has performed well in
what remains a competitive
market and this has enabled top
line growth to be achieved.  The
market is almost flat in terms of
unit growth and the 3%
improvement in volumes indicates
that Alexandra continues to grow
its market share. Price deflation
has declined as the major one-off
reductions driven by the
significant shifts in garment
sourcing to lower cost
manufacturing environments
largely occurred in prior years.
Notwithstanding the market
conditions, all the core market
sectors for workplace clothing
have shown good sales growth in
the year.   
The performance of the
Corporate Sales Division in the
second half of the year has been
particularly encouraging, with
sales up 21% on the first half.
Significant major account
renewals have been signed and
new customer wins include the
prestigious names of McDonalds,
the National Grid, Shell and
Swissport.  The last two are
examples of the growing
portfolio of Pan European
accounts, whose total sales have
increased by over 50% year-on-
year.
The overseas subsidiaries in
Ireland, Holland and France have
all benefited from the
introduction of new, focused,
local management. Each have
posted year on year growth, with
Ireland growing over 35%. The
corporate account wins after the
year end of Metro in France and
Vomar in Holland bode well for
continued good performance. 
Gross margins and overhead
spend have been carefully
controlled through supplier

we move forward with
an excellent portfolio of
customers, an enhanced
reputation in the
corporate clothing
market, a strong balance
sheet and a first class
management team.

Chief Executive Improvement Plan and a
disciplined approach to the
tender process to avoid
unprofitable business. The Profit
Improvement Plan was a cross-
functional focus on ways to
increase productivity and
efficiency and the gains achieved
were sufficient to allow additional
investment in marketing
campaigns in the autumn. 
With regard to property, the plan
to rationalise the Group’s retail
outlets to a small core based in
each of the major UK regions
continued during the year with
the assignment of a further two
leases. Ten regional centres now
remain and these have been re-
vitalised recently through the
hiring of a new retail manager. 
Discussions are still ongoing with
local stakeholders to gain
planning permission for the last
remaining factory site near
Glasgow prior to its disposal. This
could potentially enhance its
value but the process is likely to
take several years. In the
meantime the site continues to
be used as a distribution hub for
Scotland and as a centre for the
Group’s technical and quality
departments. 
Acquisition
On 26 April 2005, Alexandra
purchased 100% of the share
capital of Prima Corporate Wear
Limited, on a cash and debt free
basis, for a consideration of
£3.99 million. The consideration
was satisfied in cash and funded 
from our existing facilities.
Prima is a corporate clothing
company, specialising in the
security and transport sectors,
based in Docklands, London.
Sales for the year ended 30
September 2004 were £6.2
million, generating profit before
tax of £0.6 million. The net assets
acquired were approximately £1.0
million in value.
The purchase is in line with our
strategy to grow profitably both
organically and through carefully
selected acquisitions. The Prima
business is a very good fit with
our own customer base and
product offering. Prima offers its
customers excellent service and
maintaining these relationships is
of paramount importance to us.  
The integration savings through
combining the buying power of
both organisations are attractive
and the size and financial
strength of Alexandra will allow
Prima to grow faster than it could
alone.

Chief Executive’s Review - continued
Staff
In addition to the changes made
at the executive level described in
the Chairman’s report, I am very
pleased with the increased
strength in depth of the Group’s
management team.
This is exemplified by the
appointment of Rebecca Coutts,
a former Director with Simon
Jersey who became Head of
Design and Product Development
in February 2005. Rebecca brings
a wealth of experience from over
20 years in the textile business.  
Elsewhere in the organisation,
we have seen improvement in
our retail business, driven by
Simon Elkins who joined us in
November 2004. Our purchasing
capabilities were also
strengthened particularly in the
growing area of personal
protective equipment (PPE). 
The team is further strengthened
by the acquisition of Prima
Corporate Wear which will
continue to be led by its current
Managing Director, Nick
Atkinson. Nick has over 15 years
experience in the corporate
clothing business and will provide
additional depth to the
management talent within the
Group. 
Strategy
The strategic objective of the
Group remains profitable growth,
both organically and by
acquisition. The Board believes
Alexandra is well placed to
achieve this through its leading
market position, global
procurement expertise, customer
centric approach and financial
strength. 
It’s important to our customers that we help
them project their brand values. Personalising
their garments with embroidery enables them
to create a unique look.
Emblem Manager
The enhanced portfolio of 
corporate accounts provides a
good platform for organic
growth and will continue to be a
key area of focus. Investment will
also be made in product and
market sectors where we believe
we can gain market share.
More broadly, the predicted
industry consolidation continues,
as exemplified by Alexandra’s
purchase of Prima.  The Group’s
improved gearing allows further
acquisition opportunities to be
sought and evaluated against
strict criteria to assess their
potential value.
Conclusion
The last year has seen Alexandra
complete the lengthy and
difficult transformation of its
business model and begin to
deliver against its objective of
profitable growth. The future is
exciting as we move forward
with an excellent portfolio of
customers, an enhanced
reputation in the corporate
clothing market, a strong balance
sheet and a first class
management team.

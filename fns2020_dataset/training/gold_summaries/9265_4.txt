Since our IPO in 2006, we have constructed 
15 new build jackup drilling rigs, and 
converted, upgraded or refurbished more 
than 150 jackup and land rigs and built 
modules for nine FPSOs. In other key sectors, 
we have fabricated modules for land and 
offshore energy projects and delivered 
liftboats and wind farm installation vessels  
to the renewables market. Lamprell has come 
a long way since first opening its doors as  
a family business in 1976 and the business is 
well placed to remain a competitive force in 
the industry capable of delivering sustainable 
growth over the long term.

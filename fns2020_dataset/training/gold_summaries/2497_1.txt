Chief Executive’s review 
Strong growth in
revenue and profit 
Our proven strategy 
continues to deliver 
The strength of our brands, our 
consumer-centric innovative products 
and the quality of our people have 
delivered another year of very good 
earnings growth. The Group increased 
overall market share in 2010 and this 
continued in 2011 despite challenging 
economic conditions in some markets. 
There are signs that the industry volume 
decline seen in recent years is moderating 
but substantial excise-driven price 
increases in a few markets continue to 
affect overall volumes. While industry 
volume declined again in 2011, our  
share improvement ensured that Group 
volumes were virtually unchanged,  
down just 0.4 per cent year on year. 
Our Global Drive Brands and other 
international brands once again achieved 
good growth in 2011. Group revenue 
grew by 7 per cent on an organic basis 
and at constant rates of exchange, driven 
by continued good pricing. The resulting 
increase in adjusted profit from operations 
of 11 per cent has helped us to deliver 
superior returns to shareholders once 
again, with adjusted diluted earnings per 
share up by 11 per cent on last year. 
Strong brands driving 
growth
Our brands, both international and local, 
performed well in 2011. Collectively, our 
four Global Drive Brands (GDBs) – 
Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall – 
achieved volume growth of 9 per cent. 
Kent was up 10 per cent, growing in all 
of its top ten markets; Dunhill volumes 
were slightly higher; Pall Mall continued 
its recent success story with an 11 per 
cent increase in volumes; and Lucky 
Strike grew strongly by 14 per cent. 
We continued to grow market share in 
2011. This growth was driven by the 
launch of product innovations such  
as Click & Roll, Reloc and Convertibles  
in key markets, improved retailer 
relationships and by improving our  
speed to market.  
Productivity
Our productivity continued to improve  
in 2011 as we further addressed our cost 
base through factory rationalisation, 
systems standardisation and productivity 
savings. This helped us achieve a 
substantial increase in operating margin 
from 33.5 to 35.8 per cent. This is well 
ahead of our target of improving overall 
margin by 50-100 basis points per annum. 
Strengthening our business 
In 2011 we grew market share, grew  
our leading international brands in our 
most important markets and achieved 
significant productivity savings. Our 
results demonstrate the strength of our 
companies worldwide but we know we 
can do better. Our tried and tested 
strategy has not changed but we will 
continue to improve how we execute it 
as we seek to grow market share.  
Challenging ourselves to keep improving  
is critical to our continuing success, as we 
seek to grow market share by promoting 
our key brands and bringing market-
leading innovations to market. 
The last year has seen 
considerable success 
for the Group and I 
am excited when I 
look to our strengths. 
We have some great 
brands and our 
marketing is based on 
powerful consumer 
insights, supported  
by superior products 
and market-leading 
innovations.  06

Chief Executive’s review continued 
Sustainable business 
Of course, much of what we do today is 
about preparing for our future. We are 
proud of our record of sustainability 
across our Group operations and 
throughout our supply chain. In 
particular, we are proud of our extensive 
scientific research programme looking at 
modified cigarettes and low-toxicant 
smokeless tobacco products. 
Sustainability for us is about creating 
shared value, which means creating 
economic value for shareholders while 
ensuring our business is run responsibly 
in the interests of all our stakeholders. 
We continue to make progress on our 
sustainability agenda, not just reducing our 
impact on the environment and investing in 
our people but also the way we conduct 
our operations in the marketplace and 
throughout our supply chain. 
Our key challenge for many decades  
to come will be to provide tobacco 
consumers with exciting high quality 
products, taking into account their 
changing preferences and expectations. 
This means continuing to deliver the 
most innovative cigarette products, as we 
do today. It also means developing other 
nicotine products consumers may choose 
in the future. In 2011, we set up 
Nicoventures as a stand-alone company 
to develop and test alternative nicotine 
products. We believe that the debates 
around our product categories should be 
founded on fact-based science and  
we have made a significant commitment  
to this at our Group research and 
development facilities, where the work 
we are doing trying to develop lower 
toxicant products has been recognised  
by several key stakeholders. 
Global outlook 
For the foreseeable future, the world 
market is likely to remain fairly stable at 
around five and a half trillion cigarettes, 
more than 40 per cent of which are sold 
in China. We expect overall market values 
to grow due to changes in the product 
mix and we believe the value of emerging 
markets will grow more quickly. Because 
of this, our geographic diversity and 
strong positions in emerging markets 
remain a key strength. 
Managing risks 
We have identified a core list of potential 
threats that we believe could represent 
significant risks to our business. As can be 
seen from our review of the key Group 
risk factors in this report, we regularly 
monitor their potential impact and 
likelihood and controls are in place to 
ensure that they are carefully managed. 
Tackling illicit trade 
The expansion of illicit trade remains a 
threat globally, driven by sharp excise 
increases and pressure on consumers’ 
disposable income. We support the 
development of the World Health 
Organisation’s Framework Convention 
on Tobacco Control (FCTC) protocol 
aimed at creating an international 
regulatory framework for addressing illicit 
trade. However, we remain critical of 
other measures proposed by the FCTC 
that may drive significant excise 
increases, retail display bans and plain 
packaging – all of these measures could 
play into the hands of organised crime  
by creating ideal conditions for further 
increases in illicit trade. 
Acquisitions and 
competitive landscape 
The tobacco industry remained fairly  
stable during 2011, with little M&A activity 
among the leading industry players. On  
26 May 2011, the Group announced that it 
had agreed to acquire 100 per cent of 
privately-owned Protabaco, the second 
largest cigarette company in Colombia. The 
transaction was completed on 11 October 
2011 and the deal was financed from 
internal resources. 
We continue to monitor acquisition 
opportunities around the world and will 
participate where it makes financial and 
strategic sense to do so.  07

Management Board changes 
2011 saw the retirement of my 
predecessor, Paul Adams, as well as that 
of our long-standing Group Operations 
Director, Peter Taylor. Des Naughton 
replaced Peter, while Giovanni Giordano 
succeeded Rudi Kindts as Group Human 
Resources Director. 
In November 2011, I announced that 
Michael Prideaux, Director, Corporate & 
Regulatory Affairs (CORA), had informed 
the Board of his intention to retire with 
effect from 30 June 2012. At the same 
time, I was pleased to announce the 
appointments of Kingsley Wheaton,  
Dr David O’Reilly and Naresh Sethi to  
the Management Board. Kingsley became 
Deputy CORA Director with effect from  
1 January 2012 and will take the role of 
CORA Director when Michael retires. Also 
from 1 January 2012, David and Naresh 
took on the newly created roles of Group 
Scientific Director and Director, Group 
Business Development, respectively. 
I would like to extend my personal thanks 
to our retiring directors for their excellent 
contributions to our business over many 
years and welcome our new directors. 
Substantial opportunities 
The last year has seen considerable 
success for the Group and I am excited 
when I look to our strengths. 
We have some great brands and our 
marketing is based on powerful 
consumer insights, supported by 
differentiated and superior products. We 
have market-leading innovations – and 
we are getting better at deploying them. 
We have a great business mix, with a 
strong presence in emerging markets and 
a balanced product portfolio across all 
segments. We have a fully integrated 
supply chain and our systems are 
becoming more efficient. We have an 
industry-leading approach to science  
and harm reduction and, importantly,  
we have the people capable of tackling 
the challenges ahead. 
I am confident that we are well placed  
to take advantage of the substantial 
opportunities ahead for our business and 
that we can continue to deliver superior 
shareholder returns.

Strategy and performance
Viridor’s stated company purpose is to give resources new 
life. Its strategy remains focused on transforming waste into 
high quality recyclables, raw materials and energy. 
The company continues to build its business through 
a combination of securing long-term contracts, driving 
quality in recycling and growing capacity in waste-derived 
renewable energy.
Long-term profit growth is expected to be driven by its ERF 
projects, public private partnership (PPP) contracts and 
focused recycling opportunities.

• 246 MW of capacity at fully operational facilities  
(ERFs, landfill gas, anaerobic digestion and solar)
• £33.7 million EBITDA generated by ERFs
• Landfill energy continues to provide good cash generation
• Consistent performance from joint ventures.
Performance – recycling and resources
• Recycling contribution down reflecting commodity pricing
• ITOO programme yielding productivity and quality benefits
• Strong and growing drivers and demand for recycling 
services; Viridor well placed to grow market share
• Focus on growth in collections and contracts.

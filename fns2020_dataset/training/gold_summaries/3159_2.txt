 It is particularly pleasing that during a period of 
substantial change we have successfully launched new, 
innovative products and refreshed some of our existing 
iconic publications. I am delighted that the focus on our 
brands has been recognised through a number of industry 
awards, including several from the PPA.
These awards reflect the commitment and energy of each 
and every member of the Centaur Media team. The quality 
of this team is crucial to the future growth and success of 
the group and we have collectively responded well to the 
challenges and changes across the business over the last 
18 months. We want to become an employer of choice and 
we are committed to attracting and retaining the  
best talent. 
In November, we set out the key financial metrics against 
which we will measure the business’s performance; 
you will find these set out in more detail in the strategic 
report. We are now seeing growth in underlying revenues, 
with improvements in paid-for-content and live events 
more than compensating for declines in advertising 
revenues, and momentum is continuing to build. The 
group is increasingly well positioned for future growth. 
The restructure of the business, coupled with our clear 
vision for the group, has enabled the management team 
to prioritise and lead with focus. This process has led to 
procurement and efficiency savings in excess of £1 million, 
as well as more effective management of our capital 
expenditure investment.  These efficiencies have provided 
us with the capacity to make the necessary investments in 
data and training.
Revenues for the 18 months to 31 December 2014 were 
£105.6m. Adjusted operating profits for the same period 
were £11.7m, an adjusted operating margin of 11%. For 
the purposes of comparison only, revenues for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 of £72.8m compare to revenues 
of £74.4m in the previous twelve months. Adjusted for the 
disposal of Perfect Information in June 2014, underlying 
revenues in the year ended 31 December 2014 increased 
by 3%. Adjusted operating profits over the same period 
of £10.2m compared to £10.0m in 2013, representing 
an adjusted operating margin of 14% (year ended 31 
December 2013: 13%).
Underlying revenues in the period July to December 
2014 grew by 7% and momentum across the business 
is encouraging as we head into 2015. The structure and 
mix of the business has improved considerably; net debt 
has been reduced to £14.7m, which in part reflects the 
disposal of Perfect Information in June 2014, as well as an 
ongoing focus on cash flow across the business.
Centaur Media is now focused on four core segments: 
Marketing, Financial Services, Home Interest and the four 
portfolios aggregated into the Professional segment. 
Each portfolio is now supported by centralised expert 
teams, working across commercial, digital product 
development, marketing and research, production and 
live events. These disciplines are deployed centrally and 
strategically to add maximum value across the business.
This new market-led structure is a marked contrast to 
the previous format-based structure and enables Centaur 
Media to provide its customers with multi-platform, 
integrated content that utilises insight, live events and 
digital paid-for content as appropriate.

Across all our portfolios, there has been substantial progress 
for Centaur Media’s brands. Case studies on selected brands 
across each portfolio are included in the operating review. 
The headlines include a re-launch for Money Marketing, 
Marketing Week and Celebrity Intelligence, a new format 
for The Festival of Marketing, the launch of The Lawyer 
Research Service and the repositioning of the London 
Homebuilding Show. We are strengthening our brands and 
building clear competitor differentiation.
Alongside the focus on four core markets, the leadership 
team has developed four strategic priorities:
To be the most 
knowledgeable, connected 
and authoritative experts  
in our markets
To generate sustainable 
growth in profits and cash 
flow with high quality, 
recurring revenue streams 
and an efficient and scalable 
operating model
To create products and 
services that are both 
innovative and market-
leading, backed by strong 
digital and events expertise
To be a united team of 
entrepreneurial, multi-
skilled professionals.

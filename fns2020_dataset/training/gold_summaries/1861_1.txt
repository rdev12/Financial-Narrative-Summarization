6. BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2005
  7.
BBA Group enters 2006 with two
strong businesses, Aviation Services
and Fiberweb, each with market
leading positions and strong 
growth potential. 
In November 2005, the Board decided
to separate the businesses by the sale
of Fiberweb or via demerger, a
strategy which will allow them the
freedom to pursue their own separate
strategies in their separate markets.

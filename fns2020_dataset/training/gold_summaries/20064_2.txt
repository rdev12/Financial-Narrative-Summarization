  HOW WE HELPED
BOOSTING 
PRODUCTIVITY  
AT BMW
BMW, renowned for innovation and ultra-efficiency, 
implemented Ubisense Smart Factory in its 
Regensburg car manufacturing plant to automate 
tool control and eliminate manual barcode 
scanning, driving widespread efficiency gains. 
UBISENSE 
SMART 
FACTORY
Challenge
BMW urgently needed to gain  
better visibility of its operations and 
eliminate inefficiencies.
Every day, more than 1,000 cars are 
manufactured at BMW Regensburg with 
multiple models produced on the same 
assembly line, each to an exact customer 
specification. Achieving this level of 
productivity and customisation involves 
many thousands of complex processes. 
With so many interactions happening 
simultaneously, errors, delays and waste 
were proving impossible to monitor  
and avoid. 
Solution
Using its best-in-class real-time location 
system (RTLS) to track thousands of 
interactions along the BMW assembly 
line and instantly adapt tool settings, 
Ubisense Smart Factory enabled BMW 
factory workers to seamlessly complete 
their processes and meet their objectives, 
without delaying operations.
Ubisense Smart Factory completely 
eliminated manual barcode scanning  
at the plant, saving time and helping 
factory workers avoid costly mistakes. 
The Smart Factory automatic 
identification capabilities allowed 
the BMW team to easily rebalance 
operations to maintain optimal 
production flow.
Results
By implementing Ubisense Smart 
Factory at the Regensburg plant,  
BMW was able to completely  
eliminate costs related to manual  
tool control, minimise line stoppages 
and significantly reduce cycle time.  
It has saved hundreds of unproductive 
hours a day, cut the risk of errors and 
minimised the amount of rework. 
Empowered with unprecedented levels 
of visibility into their manufacturing 
processes, BMW can now make better 
informed, data-driven decisions to 
continually streamline and enhance 
operations at the plant.
In terms of value creation, the project 
has been a complete success.

ENABLING RAPID 
RECOVERY FROM 
HURRICANE SANDY
Ubisense myWorld gave a major cable operator 
unprecedented operational visibility to pinpoint 
widespread damage to infrastructure, prioritise 
response efforts and restore service to customers.
UBISENSE 
MYWORLD
Challenge
The devastation caused by Hurricane 
Sandy left nearly 8 million businesses  
and households without power in  
15 states and the District of Columbia.  
The largest Atlantic hurricane on record,  
it caused widespread flooding and  
power failures that wiped out cable 
service in the Northeast. 
Sixty-five percent of one cable operator’s 
customer base was without service,  
and the company quickly realised it 
needed to gain much greater operational 
visibility to fully comprehend the extent 
of the storm damage. Without this critical 
insight the cable company would be 
unable to effectively manage its disaster 
response teams.
Solution
Ubisense had just begun working  
with this major cable provider to 
deploy Ubisense myWorld, and was 
able to accelerate the deployment 
to just 36 hours so that the cable 
operator could respond to Hurricane 
Sandy’s destruction.
Ubisense myWorld delivered an 
unprecedented degree of operational 
awareness, and allowed the cable 
operator to quickly assess the 
450 miles of cable that had been 
damaged across 16,000 locations, 
and prioritise and streamline 
restoration efforts accordingly. 
Results
The cable operator was the first  
of those impacted by the storm  
to restore service to its customers.  
It was able to respond more quickly 
and effectively than the other network 
operators impacted by the storm’s 
devastation, and provided accurate 
and timely information to utility 
partners – helping them with their 
critical restoration efforts.
The largest Atlantic hurricane on record, 
and the second most costly hurricane in 
United States history, caused widespread 
flooding and power failures that wiped  
out cable service in the Northeast.

 08 —— Kier Group plc 
Overview 
Kier has delivered a solid set of results 
for the year ended 30 June 2013, 
with underlying profit before tax* and 
earnings per share* in line with our 
expectations. This has been supported 
by a resilient cash performance, with 
a year-end net cash balance of £60m 
(2012: £129m) after significant 
investment across the Group. This has 
been achieved in a very competitive 
trading environment and is testament to 
our effective project selection and risk 
management processes. 
We have also had a number of 
significant project wins, enabling us to 
maintain strong order books. These 
include the Mersey Gateway Bridge, 
Broadmoor Hospital redevelopment, 
securing the redevelopment rights 
to the Swan Hunter shipyards on 
Tyneside and over £200m of housing 
maintenance awards.
During the year, we strengthened 
our capital structure, securing 
£92m of new funding via US private 
placements (USPP) with seven and 
ten-year durations and a loan under 
the Government’s Funding for Lending 
Scheme, over four years. These 
replaced the previous £30m USPP, 
which expired in February, and are in 
addition to the renegotiations of our 
revolving credit facilities in 2012, which 
run to September 2016.
The acquisition of May Gurney is a key 
milestone in the ongoing development 
and growth of the Group. We now have 
a combined order book of almost £6bn 
across our Construction and Services 
divisions, providing us with a strong 
platform for 2014 and beyond.

*  Underlying operating profits and margins, pre-tax profits and EPS are stated before amortisation of 
intangible assets relating to contract rights of £3.4m (2012: £3.4m) and exceptional items totalling 
£17.0m (2012: £3.6m). Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 09   
Revenue for the year at £1,983m was 
slightly lower than last year (2012: 
£2,069m), primarily because of the 
reduction in our Construction revenues. 
Poor weather in the first quarter of this 
calendar year caused delays, pushing 
revenues into the 2014 financial year. 
As predicted, we have also seen a 
change in the mix of activities, with 
more infrastructure and overseas work.
The Group’s operating profit* was 
£69.7m (2012: £74.4m), in line with 
our expectations and comprised 
operating margins* of 2.3% in 
Construction, 4.4% in Services and 
a sustained contribution (£20.5m) 
from Property as we continue with 
our investment strategy. The strength 
of the underlying divisional operating 
margins reflects the quality of the work 
we completed during the year.
Exceptional items before tax amounted 
to a charge of £17.0m for the year 
(2012: charge of £3.6m), as follows:
>  £12.0m relating to the 
comprehensive restructuring 
programme mainly in the 
Construction division, which is 
substantially complete. These 
included costs related to the closure 
of the scaffolding, joinery and 
temporary electrical businesses, 
office closures and associated staff 
reductions;
>  £3.2m relating to the disposal of 
the tower crane business, which 
comprised the loss on disposal of 
some of the fixed assets together 
with transaction and redundancy 
costs; and
>  £1.8m of acquisition and integration 
costs relating to the May Gurney 
transaction.
The cash outflow during the year in 
respect of the above was approximately 
£11.0m.
Profit before tax* for the year of 
£63.4m (2012: £70.0m) and earnings 
per share of 136.2p (2012: 156.8p) 
were both in line with our expectations. 
The new station we are constructing in joint venture 
for the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) 
integrates the existing Tseun Wan and Island Lines 
with the new South Island Line and the Shatin 
Central Link in Hong Kong.

greenest buildings in London. The photo shows the

Operational review
Chief

review
Continued
The management of working capital 
remains very important to us. We 
continue to operate in a challenging 
payment environment, where the 
introduction of project bank accounts 
and specific payment terms, particularly 
across public sector contracts and 
framework arrangements, place 
greater pressure on the working 
capital position of the Group. This is 
coupled with the changing nature of our 
construction contracts to a target cost, 
reimbursable type, as we continue to 
grow our infrastructure and overseas 
businesses. 
It is therefore pleasing that the Group 
achieved an average month-end net 
debt balance of £4m (2012: average 
month-end net cash of £95m) after 
investment of approximately £77m 
during the year and the completion of  
a number of our property transactions 
in the last quarter of the financial year. 
May Gurney 
The acquisition of May Gurney has 
created a combined support services 
business with revenues in excess of 
£1bn. The enlarged Group is now more 
evenly balanced with an increased 
proportion of profits being derived from 
the Services division, which has an 
order book stretching over ten years. 
The strategic rationale for the 
acquisition was to enable us to  
deliver more services to more 
customers over a wider geography. 
Our capability now extends to 
highways maintenance where we 
maintain approximately 35,000km of 
roads and 500,000 street lights and 
signs. Our environmental portfolio 
has substantially increased and we 
now provide services to over three 
million households. In utility services, 
we now have a presence in the 
telecommunications sector and an 
increased operational capability in 
many of the water authority regions on 
AMP5 schemes, which will position us 
well for the forthcoming AMP6 tenders 
in 2014.
Since the acquisition, we have not lost 
any contracts and our combined set of 
capabilities has enabled us to bid on a 
range of new projects covering water, 
rail and highways with a total value in 
excess of £500m. 
Restructuring
In order to improve the efficiency of the 
Group, we have undertaken a significant 
restructuring programme during the 
year, closing some non-core operations 
and adjusting the scale of our regional 
building operations to better suit 
anticipated demand. 
The programme is designed to ensure 
that we operate as efficiently as 
possible and maintain our operating 
margins at good levels. We will 
continue to invest appropriately in our 
IT infrastructure, which will help us to 
deliver further operational efficiencies. 
The cost of this programme, reported 
as an exceptional charge, was £12.0m.
Outlook
With our entire forecast Construction 
revenue and 95% of our Services 
revenue secure and probable for 2014, 
we are in a strong position to achieve 
organic growth, which coupled with the 
strength of the forward bidding pipeline 
gives us comfort that this trend is likely 
to continue. The £1.5bn pipeline in our 
Property division has grown significantly 
over the last three years and there are 
many opportunities, which will provide 
good visibility of future earnings. We 
have the cash resources to continue to 
invest in non-speculative schemes that 
will generate our targeted 15% return 
on capital.
Following the acquisition of May Gurney 
we have received very strong customer 
support for the combination and we 
are already seeing the benefits of the 
greater breadth of services we can offer 
new and existing customers across  
the country. 
The bidding for AMP6, across the water 
sector, will commence later this year 
and we are well placed to capitalise on 
the combined capabilities of the two 
businesses, while our combined rail 
offering will be of great benefit as we 
tender for a range of new framework 
agreements with Network Rail. Similarly, 
the scale of services we can deliver to 
local authorities providing innovative 
and cost effective solutions will be well 
received at a time when they are still 
looking to make operational savings. Annual Report and Accounts 2013 —— 11

£120m environmental services contract in East

Safety, Health and Environment (SHE)
Through visible leadership, worker 
engagement and effective risk 
management, our goal remains the 
elimination of workplace injuries, better 
protection to our environment and an 
increase in our people’s awareness 
of occupational health and well-being. 
Our Accident Incident Rate (AIR) of 333 
remains well below the Health & Safety 
Executive’s benchmark figure of 589. 
Our Positive Safety Leadership (PSL) 
programme has delivered over 50,000 
conversations recognising both positive 
and challenging aspects of SHE 
performance. These are a powerful 
means of engaging with our staff and 
developing a positive safety leadership 
culture throughout the Group. Over 60% 
of the delegates attending the Safe 
and Unsafe Acts (SUSA) workshops 
came from our supply chain, indicating 
the importance of collaborative 
working in delivering top-quartile SHE 
performance. 
Our occupational health department 
supports the business in its aim to 
raise the awareness of well-being and 
the elimination of workplace injuries 
and incidents. Several health focus 
events were held throughout the 
country which were supported equally 
well by both Kier employees and our 
supply chain. 
During the year, Kier received 22 
RoSPA awards, 13 BSC awards, 44 
Considerate Constructors Scheme 
national awards, six Green Apple 
awards, winner of the National 
Recycling award and the National 
House Building Council (NHBC) Health 
& Safety awards for the second 
consecutive year. We also achieved 
95% (Platinum Big Tick status) in our 
2013 Business in the Community 
(BITC) Corporate Responsibility Index 
(2012: 90% Gold status). 
People
The acquisition of May Gurney involved 
a team of people from both businesses 
who have worked tirelessly to make  
the integration as smooth as possible 
with the least disruption to our 
respective customers. 
We have welcomed our new colleagues 
to Kier with particular focus on health 
and safety, personnel, training and 
development to reinforce our objective 
of providing a seamless expansion 
of our services with a motivated 
and quality-driven management and 
workforce.
It is through the effort and commitment 
of our staff, now totalling approximately 
16,000 people, that we remain a strong 
business and can continue to report 
such a solid set of results in the current 
economic environment.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
express my gratitude to everyone who 
makes all of this possible.

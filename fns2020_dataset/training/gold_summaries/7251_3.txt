 CHAIRMANâ€™S STATEMENT
During the last 12 months the financial markets worldwide and the shipping market in particular, 
had to cope with extremely challenging conditions due to the global economic turmoil.
However I am pleased to report that Hellenic Carriers has succeeded in steering through these 
difficult market conditions by continuing to implement our prudent and proactive business 
strategy.
As a result we are now able to report healthy Final Results for the year ended 31 December 2009 
despite the uncertainty in the markets and the dry bulk shipping sector in particular.  
Our Company's strategy continues to be to focus upon cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity. 
Over the last 12 months, we have taken appropriate measures, including the arrangement of time charters for our vessels, 
in order to generate long term visible cash flows and the rescheduling of our bank debt which optimizes the use of our 
cash flow, preserves the Company's liquidity and enables us to look for attractive growth opportunities.
The dry bulk shipping market has seen an improvement during the reporting period and we continue to remain optimistic 
about the long term outlook of the sector. However, in the short term, given the uncertainty on the order book, we believe 
that volatility will remain and this necessitates continued vigilance.
With a modern fleet, visible cash flows, moderate debt, strong liquidity and an experienced management, we believe that 
the Company is well positioned to deal with any further uncertainty, take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities 
and build long term shareholder value.

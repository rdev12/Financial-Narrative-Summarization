Business Review – Chief Executive’s Review
World gas markets are 
evolving and we have  
to evolve with them
Securing our customers’ energy needs, 
sustainably and affordably, is at the core 
of what we do. But the energy world is 
changing. By 2020:
•  almost three quarters of the UK’s gas  
will be imported;
•  more of the UK’s electricity will be 
generated from capital intensive, low 
carbon technologies;
•  every home in the UK will have a  
smart meter; and
•  in the US, shale will provide well  
over a third of natural gas production,  
having already transformed the US 
energy market.

Review of Operations
I am delighted to be reporting record results for the
sixth year in succession against the backdrop of a
challenging economic environment. Over the last six
years the group’s operating income has more than
doubled and pretax profits have risen almost fourfold.
This is a testament to our diversified strategy both
geographically and by marketing discipline. We have
invested in those sectors where there is above
average growth. We now have 24 offices overseas
and have developed in new areas such as sports
marketing which now represents 20% of group
operating income. International income has increased
from 30% of group operating income in 2005 to over
50%. Our focus on costs throughout that period has
improved margins by five basis points in five years.
In 2010 all of our divisions grew revenue; our Public
Relations Division maintained its position as the No 1
agency within the UK and is a leading global player
and our Sports Marketing business was No 1 in the
Sponsorship league table. VCCP , our advertising
business, won several awards on the back of its
comparethemarket.com and O2 campaigns and our
Research Division returned to profit.
The Group acted for 1,494 clients in 2010 compared
to 1,389 in 2009. 277 of these clients used more than
one of our businesses (230 in 2009) which represented
66% of total operating income (2009: 70%).
205 clients paid us over £100,000 in 2010, compared
to 150 in 2009. Our top 30 clients represented 49% of
total operating income (2009: 57%). 
Our two largest clients represented 21.0% of our
operating income (2009: 22.3%). Both clients have
been retained since 2003, are high margin and have
normal renewal terms. 
Average fee income per client in 2010 was £100,000
compared to £89,000 in 2009. Average income per
employee was £120,000 in 2010 compared to
£118,000 in 2009. In 2010, 51% of our income came
from overseas work compared to 46% in 2009. 
Chairman’s Statement
Notes:
1. Organic growth is calculated excluding all acquisitions in 2009 and 2010. 
2. Before taking account of amortisation of acquired intangible assets and
impairment of goodwill (£3.0 million, 2009: £0.3 million) and costs relating
to acquisitions and restructuring (£2.2 million, 2009: £0.2 million). In the
Income Statement this is referred to as Headline Operating Profit. Divisional Performance
In 2010 all four divisions showed growth in operating
profit (in total and organic). The performance of the
Public Relations Division was particularly strong. 
Public Relations continues to be our largest division
being 49% of operating income (2009: 55%),
Advertising and Marketing Services was 26% (2009:
26%), Sports Marketing was 20% (2009: 14%) and
Research 5% (2009: 5%).

Overall the division showed growth and very good
cost control which resulted in both improved profits
and margin. In 2010 nearly all businesses in the Group
performed ahead of the previous year and there were
particularly strong performances from Pelham Bell
Pottinger; Public Affairs; our geopolitical business;
Corporate Citizenship; property and international. 
2011 has started well for city and financial, corporate,
technology, the Middle East and corporate and social
responsibility.
Advertising and Marketing Services – VCCP

Operating profit margin  10.6% 12.3%
Very strong growth in operating income was offset 
by investment in talent and new business pitches
resulting in a lower margin. In 2011 the focus will be
on improving the margin.
There was a strong performance from VCCP in the 
UK, Germany and the Czech Republic, as well as 
our search business. Teamspirit, our financial 
services marketing business, performed ahead 
of our expectations and well ahead of 2009. 
The first quarter has started well and we are already
ahead of 2010.
Sports Marketing – Fast Track and Essentially

Operating profit margin  18.9% 20.6%
2010 included a full year of the Essentially acquisition
(two months in 2009) and Essentially performed well
with good growth.
The Fast Track business had good revenue growth,
invested in new people and a start up in Hong Kong.
The margin therefore declined. It is expected that in 2011
the margin can return to the levels achieved in 2009.
This division has had a very strong start to 2011,
particularly in rights sales and the margin is already
improving.

Following the appointment of new management and
the acquisition of Tree in February 2010 this division
has returned to growth. The marketplace appears to
be growing once again and we believe the prospects
are improving for the division. 
Facts International performed particularly well in 2010.
Opinion Leader has been completely restructured
during the year.
The 2011 new business pipeline is stronger than this
time last year.
Corporate Activity
Our strategy is to expand the range of services 
and geographical reach of the services we can offer 
to clients. 
During 2010 we have:
� Acquired pmplegacy, a company specialising 
in countries’ and federations’ bids for major 
sporting events.
� Acquired the business of Presky Maves, a direct
marketing business.
� Completed the acquisitions and integration of
Essentially (sports marketing), Tree (data analytics)
and Pelham (financial public relations).
� Started ‘Open Health’ with David Rowley, the
former Chief Executive Officer of Huntsworth Health.
� Opened a sports marketing business in Hong Kong
which is already profitable.
We will continue to look at earnings enhancing
acquisitions.
Corporate and Social Responsibility
Our biggest CSR achievement in 2010 was becoming
the first marcoms group in the UK to be awarded the
Carbon Trust Standard. The Standard recognises year
on year carbon emissions reductions and in 2009 our
carbon footprint was reduced by 5%. This is further
progress since our programme began in 2007. We are
currently calculating our 2010 footprint and will publish
the results in our CSR report later this year. We expect
to make another reduction. The remaining emissions
we offset with qualified carbon offsets working with
the Carbon Neutral Company as our external
specialist advisor. In 2010 we were re-accredited with
a ‘Big Tick’ by Business in the Community for our
continuing efforts on environmental performance. 
Operational Highlights of the Year
� Bell Pottinger retained its position as No. 1 in the ‘PR Week’
League Table.
� Fast Track remains No.1 in ‘Marketing’ Sponsorship 
League Table.

� Richemont acquisition of Net-a-Porter.
� Korea National Oil Corporation successful hostile takeover

Note:
3. Research: Before taking account of amortisation of acquired intangible
assets (£0.1 million, 2009: £nil) and costs relating to acquisitions and
restructuring (£0.8 million, 2009: £nil). In the Income Statement this is
referred to as Headline Operating Profit. We are also making progress with our wider CSR
programme by requiring our Group companies to
evaluate themselves against a number of benchmarks
each year relating to the environment, suppliers,
clients, people and the community. This is driving
improved performance across the Group and embeds
our processes within each business. Our wider
performance on CSR issues has resulted in our
continued listing in the FTSE4Good Index.
Outlook
The outlook for 2011 continues to be very challenging
as it has for the last three or four years. The UK
continues its austerity programme and the global
economy continues to be buffeted by oil price and
commodity price fluctuations, but one thing is certain,
the need to communicate change and the growth in
impact of social media and internet campaigning
appears to be never ending. 
Reputation management and the communication of
real facts is more than ever essential. This is what we
do and our market is more vibrant than ever. 
Our strategy is to expand both organically and
through earnings enhancing acquisitions. 
� We have started a new healthcare business, 
a market that is more active than ever.
� Our sports business continues to grow as sport
becomes more and more of our daily lives and we
will expand our presence by sport and geography
as the year continues. 
� We have Sports Marketing offices in 11 countries,
the most recent being Hong Kong. 
� Our financial public relations business is growing
fast and our Singapore and Middle East branches
are doing well. 
� Our Advertising and Marketing Services businesses
continue to develop market leading campaigns, be
it for O2, comparethemarket.com and most recently
with More Th>n Freeman.
� Our Middle Eastern business has not been affected
by recent turbulence in the region. 
� Our research business is back in profit and 
growing again.
� Our costs are tightly controlled and our cash
position is strong. 
We are cautious about the future, but confident of
continued growth.

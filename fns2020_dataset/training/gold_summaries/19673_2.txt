KEY HIGHLIGHTS

ANNUAL REPORT 2015  “The Group has delivered another solid set of results in spite of challenging trading 
conditions including the adverse impact on performance during the period of 
England’s early departure from the FIFA World Cup in Brazil and unseasonably 
mild weather during autumn, reducing footfall.
“However, with our ongoing focus on providing customers with exceptional quality 
and unbeatable value, we have continued to grow Group revenues and EBITDA 
and have succeeded in surpassing our fourth and final EBITDA target under the 
2011 Share Scheme. The first of these awards will vest with participants in 
September 2015 and the second in September 2017. We owe our continued 
success to the commitment and hard work of those participants and we are 
delighted that we are able to reward them in this way.
“Trading since the period end has been in line with management expectations 
and will continue to be driven by improvements in product range and availability, 
optimisation of both our in-store and web offerings, the introduction of Click and 
Collect in the UK and further investment in our store portfolio.”

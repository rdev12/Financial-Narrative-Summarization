a change in culture, allying broader retail
expertise to our strong understanding
of the gaming market and its
regulatory framework.
Since 2008, Rank has appointed new
managing directors in its three largest
businesses. Each has an operational
background in either leisure retail or
online retail.
In June 2009, Mark V Jones, an
experienced operator of pubs and
restaurants, joined us as managing
director of Mecca Bingo to lead the
transformation of that business.
Reflecting this cultural shift, Rank
has started to build a reputation for
innovation in the development,
refinement and deployment of new
concepts and new customer experiences
in leisure, based around gaming.
In 2009, the Group stepped up the
pace of expansion for its proven G Casino
format. By the end of the year, the
G Casino brand had grown from six to
ten casinos, with each delivering levels of
customer visits and revenue significantly
higher than the average across the
remainder of the estate.
The year also saw the launch of
the Mecca ‘Full House’ club concepts.
The first Mecca ‘Full House Destination’
opened in Nottingham in May 2009,
offering a new style of gaming-based
social entertainment, aimed principally
at women. The early performance of the
club has been encouraging and we have

substantial reductions in net debt and
financial leverage.

Shares in Rank have under-performed the FTSE 350 in
recent years as the effect of negative legislative changes
to the taxation and operation of land-based gaming
businesses in Britain caused the market to reduce
forecast earnings for the Group.
Between 2007 and 2009, Rank grew adjusted earnings
per share by 20.3% as the Group stabilised its operating
performance and achieved substantial reductions in
net debt.
As part of management’s response to the difficult trading
conditions, Rank suspended payment of dividends in 2007.
Following a review of the Group’s capital structure, the
board has recommended the resumption of dividend
payments from May 2010.

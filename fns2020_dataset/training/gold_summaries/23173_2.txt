FREIGHT
DX 1-MAN
Our ‘closed network’ operation 
handles a wide variety of 
consignments, including pallets, 
parcels and items up to 6 metres and 
ensures that the integrity of each 
delivery is maintained. We specialise 
in the delivery of irregular-shaped 
freight items, carrying consignments 
such as lamp posts and canoes, 
which are often unsuitable for 
the majority of parcel carriers. 
For the UK, DX offers next-day 
deliveries including pre-9.30am, 
pre-12pm and end-of-day delivery 
options. The DX 1-Man service 
also offers an international 
service for both outbound 
and inbound deliveries. 
Approximately two-thirds of the 
items we deliver are to business 
locations, with the remainder 
delivered to residential addresses. 
DX COURIER 
This is our fully tracked next-day 
delivery service, transporting packets, 
parcels and pouches mostly for the 
business-to-business (“B2B”) market. 
Our couriers are primarily collecting 
and delivering to branch networks, 
high streets, industrial areas and 
government premises. We offer 
pre-9am, pre-12pm and end-of-
day delivery options as well as 
specialist services for companies 
in the pharmaceutical, healthcare, 
optical and retail sectors, and 
organisations in the public sector. 
DX 2-MAN 
DX 2-Man specialises in delivering 
larger and heavier consumer 
products such as sofas, beds, 
bathrooms, kitchens and garden 
furniture. Our service includes 
delivery to a customer’s ‘room 
of choice’, whether that is 
upstairs in their home or to 
their garage or garden.
Customers can choose which day 
is most convenient to receive their 
delivery at the point of order and 
we offer a further text booking 
service for added flexibility. We 
keep customers updated with the 
progress of their delivery through 
a text or email and, on the day 
of delivery, customers receive 
a call from one of our 2-Man 
crew ahead of final delivery.

and GPS evidence of delivery, 
with signature capture. Our online 
system tracks items and enables 
the rescheduling of deliveries. DX 
Secure is ideal for high volume 
despatches of sensitive or valuable

extra oversight of their deliveries.

deregulation (Downstream access)

mile’ delivery to the UK’s national 
mail operator.
Our service can offer significant cost 
savings to customers’ postal budgets 
and provides an extended time 
window along with reduced mail 
preparation time and online ordering.

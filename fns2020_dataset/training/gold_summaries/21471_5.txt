OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS
Executing our strategy
The Group has delivered another strong year of strategic progress and excellent earnings growth, in what remains a challenging and uncertain 
macroeconomic backdrop, both globally and in the Caucasus region. We are confident however in our ability to continue to deliver high returns 
and strong performances in both the Banking Business and the Investment Businesses during 2017 and beyond.

During 2016, BGEO Group delivered a strong earnings performance against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop in a number of Georgia’s 
regional trading partner countries which resulted in a year of lower economic growth than expected and a 10.5% depreciation of the Georgian Lari 
compared to the Dollar. The Lari was particularly weak in the last quarter of the year when it devalued by over 13% against the Dollar. Despite these 
challenges, Group revenue in 2016 increased by 17.8% to GEL 1.01 billion, profit increased by 37.8% to GEL 428.6 million, and earnings per share 
increased by 31.3% to GEL 10.41. Book value per share at the end of 2016 was GEL 57.52, up 18.0% y-o-y. The Return on Average Equity in the 
banking business increased from 21.7% in 2015, to 22.1% in 2016.  54 Annual Report 2016 BGEO Group PLC
RESILIENT GROWTH MOMENTUM 
SUSTAINED ACROSS MAJOR  
BUSINESS LINES
Retail Banking (RB) continues to deliver 
strong franchise growth. Retail Banking 
revenue reached GEL 494.1 million in 2016,  
up 15.6% y-o-y. 
The Retail Banking net loan book reached  
GEL 3,902.3 million as at 31 December 2016, 
up 39.5% y-o-y. The growth on a constant-
currency basis was 31.5% y-o-y, well above our 
strategic target of 20%+. Consequently, our 
share of retail loan book accounted for 60.9% 
of our total gross loan book at the end of 2016, 
5.9ppts up compared to last year.
Retail Banking client deposits increased to  
GEL 2,413.6 million as at 31 December 2016, 
up 28.4% y-o-y. The growth on a constant-
currency basis was 19.2% y-o-y.
The number of Retail Banking clients reached 
2.1 million at the end of 2016, up 7.1% from 
2.0 million a year ago.
Solo – our premium banking brand – 
continues its strong growth. Solo, which 
offers a fundamentally different approach to 
premium banking and targets the mass affluent 
client segment, more than doubled its client 
base since April 2015, when we launched Solo 
in its current format. As of 31 December 2016, 
the number of Solo clients reached 19,267. Our 
goal is to significantly increase our market share 
in the mass affluent segment, which stood 
below 13% at the beginning of 2015.
Our Retail Banking product to client ratio 
reached 2.0 in 2016, up from 1.9 at the end 
of 2015. The start of the transformation of our 
retail banking operations from product-based 
into a client-centric one is expected to positively 
affect the Retail Banking product to client ratio 
in the future. We completed the change in 15 
branches in 2016 and are currently in process 
of converting nine additional branches into  
the new client-centric model. We have seen 
outstanding sales growth in transformed 
branches, with the number of products sold to 
our clients increasing by over 100% compared 
to the base-line figures.
Corporate Investment Banking (CIB) is 
successfully delivering its risk 
deconcentration strategy, having reduced 
the concentration of our top ten CIB clients 
to 11.8% by the end of 2016, down from 
12.7% a year ago. The CIB net loan book 
totalled GEL 2,394.9 million, up 8.3% y-o-y. 
On a constant-currency basis, the loan  
portfolio was largely flat y-o-y. CIB net fee and 
commission income was GEL 28.0 million or 
12.0% of total CIB revenue in 2016 compared 
to GEL 34.3 million or 14.2% a year ago. The 
decline was mainly driven by the decrease in 
commission fee income from guarantees (net 
income from guarantees was GEL 12.6 million 
in 2016, down by GEL 6.2 million or 33.0% 
y-o-y) as we reduced our large guarantee 
exposures (more detailed review on this is 
presented in the Banking business discussion 
below). CIB ROAE was 14.5% in 2016, down 
from 18.5% in 2015, which was primarily a 
result of 1) negative operating leverage, and 2) 
higher cost of risk, largely related to the impact 
of the recent GEL devaluation. We expect to 
further reduce concentration risk in the 
corporate loan portfolio, grow our fee income 
and improve the Bank’s ROAE in this segment.
Investment Management’s Assets Under 
Management (AUM) increased to GEL 
1,592.0 million
1
, up 15.9% y-o-y, reflecting 
higher bond issuance activity by our brokerage 
arm Galt & Taggart, as our clients increasingly 
access these new products.

Our Investment Business contributed GEL 
119.1 million, or 27.8% to the Group’s profit  
in 2016, up from GEL 36.7 million a year ago. 
Of this, GEL 91.6 million is attributed to 
shareholders of BGEO and the rest mainly 
belongs to the non-controlling shareholders  
of GHG. 
2016 profit includes material one-offs from 
deferred tax adjustments, gain from the 
purchase of GGU and other net non-recurring 
items. Excluding these one-offs, profit from our 
Investment Business was GEL 60.8 million, or 
16.5% of the Group’s profit. Furthermore, if we 
exclude our publicly listed subsidiary, GHG, 
from this figure, then our Investment Business 
profit was GEL 26.0 million or 7.8% of the 
Group’s profit.
Our healthcare business, Georgia 
Healthcare Group PLC (GHG) continued to 
deliver strong revenue performance across 
all business lines. GHG recorded revenue of 
GEL 426.4 million (up 73.4% y-o-y) in 2016. 
During 2016, GHG achieved further 
diversification of the revenues. The healthcare 
services business revenue accounted for 
around 55%, the pharmacy business revenue 
accounted for c.31% and the medical 
insurance business revenue accounted for 
c.14% of its gross revenues in 4Q16. GHG 
delivered quarterly EBITDA of GEL 24.3 million, 
up 47.0% y-o-y. This growth was primarily 
driven by the healthcare services business 
EBITDA growth of 30.2% y-o-y. Consequently, 
for 2016 EBITDA was GEL 78.0 million (up 
39.0% y-o-y) and profit was GEL 61.3 million 
(up 159.7% y-o-y) (including a tax benefit  
of GEL 24.0 million relating to the deferred  
tax adjustments).
In January 2017, GHG received final approval 
for and completed the purchase of JSC ABC 
Pharmacia (ABC), owner of the Pharmadepot 
chain of pharmacies. This acquisition followed the 
acquisition in mid-2016 of the GPC chain of 
pharmacies, which was GHG’ s entry into the retail 
pharmacy business. These acquisitions have 
resulted in GHG becoming a key player in the 
pharmacy market, as it is in the healthcare 
services and medical insurance markets. Details 
of ABC acquisition are in GHG’s separate press 
release, which is available at www.ghg.com.ge. 
GHG will be consolidating the ABC pharmacy 
business from 1 January 2017.
Our real estate business, m
2
 Real Estate (m
2
) 
continued its strong project execution and 
sales performance in 2016. In 2016, m
2
 
achieved sales of US$ 34.4 million, selling a 
total of 407 apartments, compared to US$ 30.0 
million sales and 346 apartments sold in 2015. 
As a result, m
2
 recognised revenue of GEL 20.9 
million (down 3.2% y-o-y) and net profit of GEL 
12.5 million (up 16.1% y-o-y).
1 Wealth Management client deposits, Galt & Taggart client assets, Aldagi Pension Fund and Wealth Management client assets at Bank of Georgia Custody.
2 Capital adequacy ratios include GEL 99.5mln distributed as dividend from the Bank to the holding level on 29 December 2016. These funds are earmarked for regular dividends to 
be paid from BGEO Group in respect of the 2016 financial year and will be payable in 2017, subject to shareholder approval. Including this payment, NBG (Basel 2/3) Tier I and 
Total CAR is 9.1% and 14.4%, respectively.

 followed revenue 
recognition guidance under International 
Accounting Standard (IAS) 18 and recognised 
revenues from sales of residential units upon 
completion and handover of the units to 
customers. Effective 1 January 2017, the 
Group, inclusive of m
2
, is early adopting the 
new revenue recognition standard, IFRS 15, 
which allows revenue recognition according to 
the percentage of completion method. As a 
result, m

 Real Estate expects that out of its 
total deferred revenue of US$ 30.6 million (net 
of US$ 5.5 million VAT) at 31 December 2016, 
US$ 17.1 million will be recognised as revenue 
gradually in the upcoming years, while  
US$ 13.5 million will be recognised through 
equity on 1 January 2017.
Our utility and energy business, Georgia 
Global Utilities (GGU), delivered strong 
revenue and cost-efficiency performance  
in 2016 and achieved revenue of GEL 127.4 
million (up 7.7% y-o-y), EBITDA of GEL 
68.1million (up 10.3% y-o-y) and profit of 
GEL 35.7million (up 134.5% y-o-y) for 2016. 
As BGEO owned 25% of GGU until July 2016, 
we reported our share of GGU’s profits in the 
line item “profit from associates”. In July 2016, 
we completed the acquisition of the remaining 
75% equity stake in GGU and we started 
consolidating GGU financial results from 21 July 
2016 as part of our Investment Business and 
included it in the segment results discussion as 
a separate business.
Our beverages business, Teliani, reached  
a major milestone in 2016 and finished the 
construction of the beer brewery. Teliani will 
brew Heineken under the ten-year exclusive 
licence agreement to sell Heineken in 
Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
In May 2016, the Parliament of Georgia 
approved a change in the current corporate 
taxation model, with changes applicable from 
1 January 2017 for all entities apart from certain 
financial institutions, including banks and 
insurance businesses (changes are applicable 
to financial institutions, including banks and 
insurance businesses from 1 January 2019). 
The changed model implies a zero corporate 
tax rate on retained earnings and a 15% 
corporate tax rate on distributed earnings, 
compared to the previous model of a 15% tax 
rate charged to the company’s profit before tax, 
regardless of the retention or distribution status. 
The change has had an immediate impact on 
deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability 
balances (“deferred taxes”) attributable to 
previously recognised temporary differences 
arising from prior periods. The Group 
considered the new regime as substantively 
enacted effective June 2016 and thus has 
re-measured its deferred tax assets and 
liabilities as at 30 June 2016. Subsequently, 
deferred tax assets and liabilities were 
re-measured again at 31 December 2016. The 
Group has calculated the portion of deferred 
taxes that it utilised before 1 January 2017 for 
our non-financial businesses and the portion  
of deferred taxes it expects to utilise before 
1 January 2019 for financial businesses and 
has fully released the un-utilisable portion of 
deferred tax assets and liabilities (“Deferred  
tax adjustments”) as of 31 December 2016. 
The deferred tax liabilities that were reversed 
significantly exceeded the deferred tax assets 
written off. The net amount was recognised  
as an income tax benefit for the Group and 
amounted to GEL 63.8 million for full-year 
2016, of which GEL 39.4 million and GEL 24.4 
million impacts the Group’s Banking Business 
and Investment Business profit after tax, 
respectively. The amounts are reflected in the 
“income tax (expense) benefit” line of the 
income statement.
The Group has also incurred a GEL 43.9 million 
charge for accounting losses arising from the 
buyback of the Bank’s Eurobond, which took 
place in July 2016. 
During July 2016, the Group completed the 
acquisition of the remaining equity interests  
in Georgia Global Utilities Limited (“GGU”),  
its utility and energy business and gained full 
control of GGU. As a result of this acquisition, 
the Group recorded a GEL 31.8 million gain 
from negative goodwill. The gain resulted from 
the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
acquired (totalling GEL 255.9 million) which 
exceeded the fair value of the total 
consideration paid by the Group (totalling  
GEL 224.1 million). This gain is reflected in the 
“net non-recurring items” line of the income 
statement. The Group started consolidating 
GGU results on 21 July 2016. Prior to this, the 
Group reported the results of GGU’s operations 
under “profit from associates”.
Full-year 2016 profit was also positively affected 
by a GEL 16.4 million one-off gain from the sale 
of Class C shares and Class B shares of Visa 
Inc. and MasterCard, respectively. This gain 
was partially offset by one-off employee costs 
related to termination benefits, inclusive of the 
Bank’s former CEO. These items are also 
reflected in the “net non-recurring items” line  
of the income statement.
3 Significant deferred tax liabilities that were reversed arose from the recognition timing differences between the IFRS and the tax accounting rules and were related to accumulated 
depreciation, allowance for impairment of loans, property and equipment, investment properties, intangible assets, accruals of certain provisions, and various other items.

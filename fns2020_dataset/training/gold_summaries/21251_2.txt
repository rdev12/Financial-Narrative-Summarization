Infrastructure is the backbone 
of the economy and society. 
Everyone relies on energy, 
water, communications, 
transport and buildings.
Building the essentials of everyday life
Balfour Beatty finances, develops, builds and 
maintains the infrastructure that underpins 
daily life, supports communities and enables 
economic growth.
Together with our partners and supply chain 
of small and large firms, we know how 
to deliver innovative, efficient and highly 
complex infrastructure projects with the 
highest levels of quality, safety and technical 
expertise. We integrate with customers 
and local supply chains, and work with 
local communities.
Throughout this report, the Group has 
presented performance measures which 
are considered most relevant to the Group 
and are used to measure the Group’s 
performance on a day-to-day basis. 
These measures are chosen to provide a 
balanced view of the Group’s operations and

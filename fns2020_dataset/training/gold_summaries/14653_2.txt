Operational and 
strategic highlights
Significant strategic progress was made in 2012, through the introduction of 
new test solutions and the acquisition of Mu Dynamics, Inc. (“Mu”) and Metrico 
Wireless, Inc. (“Metrico”), taking Spirent into adjacent growth markets. 
•	 Demand was driven by:
 – Expansion in data center scale for cloud computing and mobile broadband; 
 – Migration of Ethernet technologies to higher speeds;
 – Application security needs resulting from mobility and growth in applications;
 – 4G/LTE technology and services such as video and Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”);
 – Need for integrated infrastructure test automation to address time to 
market pressures.
•	 Acquired Mu for cash of $39.8 million in April 2012. Mu offers market leading 
expertise in cyber security. Mu’s software has been integrated within Spirent 
TestCenter
TM
, resulting in the most comprehensive solution available to test 
application‑aware networks and security.
•	 Acquired Metrico for cash of $52.2 million in September 2012. Combining 
Metrico’s live network with Spirent’s lab‑based mobile device test expertise 
has resulted in an unparalleled end‑to‑end test portfolio.
•	 Expanded our wireless test capabilities for the deployment of 4G/LTE networks, 
devices and services into the mobile device R&D market. 
•	 Further test capabilities developed to serve growth in location based services 
and global navigation satellite systems beyond GPS.

for enterprises to rapidly deploy network services.

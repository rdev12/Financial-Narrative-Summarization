 I am very pleased with the results of the Group in 2006. Although
each of the six divisions operates in different market sectors and
faced varying opportunities and challenges in the year, the overall
performance was very good.
I set out on the following pages reports on the six operating divisions.
Since my report last year a lot of work has been done and a great
deal of progress has been made in improving the quality of our six
divisions.
▪
At Dynacast the investment in and the expansion of the operations in
the Far East have continued apace in order to benefit from the
exciting market opportunities and customers transferring production
to lower cost countries. In order to maintain operational efficiency
this has necessitated an ongoing programme of plant closures in
higher cost economies. In addition management have been highly
successful in managing the impact of the increased price of zinc
on the business during the year.
▪
At Aerospace OEM, although assisted by favourable conditions in
the industry, management have focused on delivering significant
operational improvements to the businesses by targeted capital
expenditure and good management discipline. A continuing
programme of close collaboration with customers on new product
development has brought about notable successes in terms of
winning business on new platforms.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
“A great deal of progress has been made in
improving the quality of our six divisions.”
David Roper Chief Executive
6 MELROSE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 TYEE, A LEADER IN THE DESIGN, TEST AND
MANUFACTURE OF RODS, STRUTS AND
ENGINEERED TUBULAR COMPONENTS FOR
THE AIRCRAFT AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES,
IS THE EXCLUSIVE SUPPLIER OF INTERIOR
SUPPORT TIE RODS FOR THE BOEING 787.
OVER 60% OF THE 787’S INTERIOR RODS WILL
BE MADE FROM CARBON FIBRE TUBING AND
TITANIUM END FITTINGS, REDUCING THE
WEIGHT BY APPROXIMATELY 34% OVER
TRADITIONAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS.
▪
At the four smaller businesses good progress has been made.
The most difficult of these was MVC where progress has been
disguised in 2006 principally by poor market conditions in the US
automotive industry and commodity prices.
OUTLOOK
We have owned these businesses for almost two years and
although much has been done in this time to improve them, there
are significant opportunities to develop them further.
As Chris Miller says in his Chairman’s Statement, if we do not
receive a price for Aerospace OEM that reflects its inherent quality
and future prospects, we would be more than happy to continue
owning this high quality business. Its outlook for this year in very
good market conditions is excellent.
Dynacast is nearing the end of the restructuring programme that we
formulated upon acquisition. It will continue to focus on the growth
opportunities in the Far East and to build upon its strong international
market share by seeking synergistic add-on acquisitions. This is a high
quality engineering business with exciting prospects ahead.
Together with the four smaller divisions, where there remains
significant overall scope for further development, our businesses are
positioned to perform well in the year ahead.

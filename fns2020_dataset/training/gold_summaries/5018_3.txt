Geoff Cooper Chairman
In my interim report to shareholders, I 
commented on the excellent performance 
delivered by Dunelm over the 26 weeks to 
2 January 2010. I am delighted to say that 
the business has remained very strong in 
the second half and we have delivered not 
only impressive sales growth for the full 
financial year, but also an outstanding 
43.5% increase in profit before tax.
The business has continued to generate 
very strong cash flows. As a result, we 
were able to return £43.2m of surplus 
capital to shareholders in the course of 
the year – in addition to our normal 
dividends whilst continuing to invest in 
the business to support our future 
growth. The proposed final dividend of 
5.0p (2009: 4.0p) brings the full year 
dividend to 8.0p (2009: 6.0p) – an 
increase of 33%.
Looking ahead, we remain cautious about 
the outlook for UK consumer spending 
and in turn the impact on the homewares 
market. However, we are very confident 
that Dunelm will continue to grow its 
share and become an even more 
significant player over the coming period.
I am excited about forthcoming changes 
in Board composition.
After almost 15 years as Dunelm’s Chief 
Executive, Will Adderley has decided to 
relinquish that role from February 2011, 
when he will assume the new role of 
Executive Deputy Chairman, a full-time 
Board position. In this new role, he will be 
able to focus on specific aspects of the 
Group where he has unique expertise and 
experience, under the direction of the 
newly appointed Chief Executive.
Nick Wharton will assume the role of Chief 
Executive Designate with effect from 1 
December 2010, and will take over as 
Chief Executive after the announcement 
of the Group’s interim results in February 
2011. Nick has been a Non-Executive 
Director of Dunelm since August 2009.
This change is a reflection of the Board’s 
desire to enhance and expand the 
executive management of the Group as it 
embarks on the next important phase of 
its development. 
The change represents the culmination of 
a detailed review by the Board, over many 
months, of the executive management 
resources required to maintain the pace of 
development through the next phase of 
our exciting growth plan. This review was 
instigated at Will’s request and has 
involved a thorough and formal 
recruitment process, including 
benchmarking of external candidates by 
an executive search firm. 
In his new role as Executive Deputy 
Chairman, he will be able to dedicate all 
his time and energy to aspects of the 
business which he is passionate about and 
where he has a unique level of insight and 
experience. At the same time, we are 
bringing increased strength in depth to 
the executive management team through 
the appointment of a new Chief Executive.
Nick will be a worthy successor to Will. As 
well as being a hugely experienced retailer 
he already has a good understanding of 
Dunelm’s business and, most importantly, 
of our business philosophy and values. He 
will maintain the drive and sense of 
purpose which Dunelm has been used to 
under Will’s leadership. Through his time 
as a Non-Executive Director, he has built 
strong relationships with both Will and 
David Stead, our Finance Director, and we 
are absolutely confident that the new 
team will combine to take Dunelm 
forward to further success.
The whole process typifies the foresight 
and objectivity shown both by Will, and by 
Bill and Jean Adderley before him, in 
considering the long-term interests of 
Dunelm and all its shareholders.

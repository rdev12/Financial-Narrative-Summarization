 Over the past four years, George Wimpey’s
pre-tax proﬁts have grown more than three
times, with our core UK operating margins up
from 11.4% to 18.5% and those in Morrison
Homes up from 8.6% to 14.6%. Although
helped by strong market conditions in both
the UK and US, this remarkable improvement
has been achieved by clear and effective
management actions that have put us in 
a good position to address the changing
markets we face today.
OUR UK STRATEGY 
In the UK whilst driving short term ﬁnancial
improvement, we also took the actions to
ensure George Wimpey and Laing Homes
were well prepared to enter the more
challenging markets that were bound to
arrive eventually. And, as our markets do 
get harder, we are preparing our plans for
growth so that we can respond quickly 
as conﬁdence returns.
The long period of rapidly rising UK house
prices came to an end during the summer.
Since then the market has been subdued,
with customers slow to commit against a
background of ﬁve interest rate rises and press
speculation about house prices. However, the
longer term outlook remains healthy as long 
as general economic conditions are stable.The
market remains undersupplied and

create not just housing but Sustainable
Communities if the extra housing required 
is to enhance and not damage our society.
We wholeheartedly endorse this view and
have embraced it wherever we have been
able to. In both the Operating and Financial
Review and our separate Corporate Social
Responsibility Report, we report on some 
of the actions we have taken to address 
this agenda and demonstrate some of 
our achievements.
DELIVERING CUSTOMER EXCELLENCE
We are proud that we continue to excel
amongst major housebuilders in our standards
of customer satisfaction.We achieve these
results by investing in our people, equipping
them with the right skills and giving them the
right levels of support and resource. All who
work with us know the priority we place on
health and safety and product quality. Of
course, we still make mistakes. But we use 
them to learn and to improve.
MODERN METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION
Continuous improvement is the focus of our
business and our culture. We have the scale
and experience to employ a wide variety of
traditional and innovative approaches to
construction and aim always to employ that
which is most appropriate, taking into
account our needs for safe working practices,
historically low interest rates ensure affordability
remains satisfactory. In the shorter term,
however, any price increases in the market 
are likely to be modest.
This means our focus must remain on
performance improvement. During 2004, we
prioritised sustaining our operating margins
over volume. We raised our land purchase
hurdle rates and ensured our assumptions
about future selling prices and costs were
cautious. We were particularly selective about
which deals to do during the last quarter.
Business focus continues to be on attacking
costs which have risen in recent years, driven
by increasing regulations and taxes. Plans are
in place to achieve cost savings of £20 million
during 2005. We have made sure the
presentation of our new homes to our
customers is as good as we can make it.
We will keep to the same priorities and
disciplines in 2005.
During 2004 we have seen further changes 
in our business environment, many driven 
by Government. Whilst these will have a
signiﬁcant impact on our business, we are
conﬁdent that we are well placed to respond
to them.
MEETING THE DEMAND CRISIS
During recent years housing output has not
responded to the strong demand we have
seen. In 2003 the Government commissioned
a report from Kate Barker to ﬁnd out why. In
her report published in March 2004 Ms Barker
conﬁrmed that the UK’s sclerotic planning
system was to blame.The Government has
still to resolve how it will implement her
proposals but in the meantime the planning
environment has deteriorated further.
George Wimpey alone could have built 
some additional 2,500 homes in 2004 had
applications recommended for approval 
by planning ofﬁcers not been rejected by
planning committees. If implemented,
Ms Barker’s report offers the potential of
sustained volume growth. However, today 
the whole industry faces the challenge of
sustaining volume in a slower market with
lengthening planning delays.
CREATING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES
Both Ms Barker in her report and the
Government in its various proposals have
stressed the need to improve design and

ANNUAL ‘SUPPLY GAP’ in Central Florida and will establish a new
Division in Sarasota in 2005. In Central Florida
we have successfully developed a range of
‘townhomes’ , affordable attached products
suitable for higher density developments.
We are introducing these in other regions.
We beneﬁt greatly from having the ability 
to balance investment between our UK and
US businesses and will continue to do so
depending on their ability to sustain long 
term returns in excess of our cost of capital.
MANAGING FOR THE FUTURE
Management succession has proceeded
smoothly and successfully in the UK and 
the US. Both Peter Redfern in the UK and 
Steve Parker in the US have a strong team 
of experienced senior managers to support
them, whilst Stu Cline continues to give Steve
wise leadership.The George Wimpey UK Board
has a total of over 150 years and the Morrison
Homes Leadership Team over 50 years of
company experience between them.
It is that experience mirrored across our 
38 regional companies in the UK and US 
that has created the strong business we have
today. I would like to end by thanking all my
colleagues again for their tireless support 
and the commitment that has delivered the
progress we have made over the past four years.

customer satisfaction, good design and build
efﬁciency. We share this experience across the
Group and transfer good practice wherever
possible. We are major users of prefabricated
components. However, we do not have the
skills of a building component manufacturer
and do not intend to produce such
components ourselves.
US BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
The US offers us a far more positive business
environment.The outlook in our markets is
good and, whilst development controls are
increasing, the political environment is pro-
development. As housing supply responds
more easily to demand, price inﬂation in the
US has been lower than in the UK. Morrison’s
markets beneﬁt from positive demographic
trends, internal migration and some of the
highest rates of employment growth in 
the US.
OUR US STRATEGY
Because of this, we have maximised Morrison
Homes’ growth. In three years completions
have grown over 30% to 4,422 and proﬁts
have more than doubled. However, we have
scaled back our activities in Atlanta, where
industry returns are below our own targets,
and will exit that market during 2005.
Our detailed plans to achieve growth are set
out in the Operating and Financial Review. We
have broadened our Northern Californian
business with a new Division in the lower
priced Central Valley, south of Sacramento,
and will develop this position further. We
continue to strengthen our powerful position

QUEEN ELIZABETH PARK, GUILDFORD Queen Elizabeth Park, Guildford is a large
mixed use site which has been designed 
to include areas of woodland preservation

Borough of Guildford. The 23 hectare site
provides 525 new homes, 183 (35%) of
which will be affordable and will provide
25% of the Borough’s housing requirements
through to 2006.
BUILDING FOR THE COMMUNITY 
Community involvement is vital if our new
developments are to respond to local need
and we are to create sustainable communities.
At Queen Elizabeth Park the local community

At Queen Elizabeth Park we have been
working with the community to make new

to inform and involve them. A surgery, a
health and ﬁtness centre, food stores, cafes,

facilities all form part of the development 
to help meet residents’ needs.

Approximately 6.8 hectares of the development
have been laid out as public open spaces
including a new ‘village green’ .The preservation
of existing woodlands maximises the natural

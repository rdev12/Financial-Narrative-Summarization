Chief Executive’s Review
We believe we will see growth in StatPro Revolution 
sales from direct efforts, growing our network of 
partners and from the viral effect of people sharing 
portfolio access with others.
We are pleased with the excellent 
progress made in 2012 towards our 
strategy of becoming a purely cloud-
based analytics service provider. The 
existing business has continued to provide 
us with a strong, profitable platform 
from which we can drive StatPro forward, 
capitalising on cloud computing to enter 
new regions and market tiers, as well as 
revitalise our existing customer base. 
By the end of the year, StatPro Revolution, 
our cloud-based portfolio analysis 
service, was being used by over 156 
organisations, in 22 countries (2011: 
9). We have successfully completed the 
switchover of development work from 
StatPro Seven to StatPro Revolution and 
begun development of R+, to be launched 
in mid-2013 as a beta, allowing upgrades 
over the next three to five years.
The cloud-based nature of StatPro 
Revolution means it can be shared 
between colleagues, businesses and 
customers. We are confident that, with 
the 21 fund administrators signed up as 
partners by the year end, we are now 
on the verge of seeing the start of a 
‘network effect’, with each new customer 
of the service potentially driving uptake 
by others. We therefore believe the 
outlook for StatPro to be positive.
Financial highlights
We are pleased to report that revenue 
for 2012 increased to £32.00 million 
(2011: £31.72 million) and adjusted 
EBITDA increased by 10% to £6.73 
million (2011: £6.12 million). Taking 
into account exceptional costs of £0.98 
million (2011: nil) due to the restructuring 
in January 2012, profit before tax was 
down 2% at £3.78 million (2011: £3.86 
million). Cash flow from operations 
(before exceptional items) was also 
strong at £10.18 million (2011: £10.37 
million) and, following a successful 
placing in November 2012, net cash was 
£3.67 million at the end of December 
2012 (2011: net debt £3.40 million). 
Adjusted earnings per share was up 4% 
to 5.9p (2011: 5.7p) and the Board has 
recommended an increase in the dividend 
of 4% for the year to 2.7p (2011: 2.6p).
Other KPIs that improved in 2012 include 
the contract renewal rate, increasing to 
93% (2011: 92%) and annualised recurring 
contract revenue, up 4% (on a constant 
currency basis) to £29.52 million. As 
the Group is going through a complex 
transformation of technology platforms 
this is a pleasing result. In early 2012, we 
took the decision to focus all active sales 
efforts on our new cloud-based service 
StatPro Revolution rather than StatPro 
Seven. The result has been a marked 
increase in sales of StatPro Revolution in 
2012 with annualised recurring revenues 
rising over 200% at constant currency 
to £1.51 million (2011: £0.45 million) 
and the number of clients of StatPro 
Revolution increasing to 156 (2011: 50).
Strategic focus
The strategic focus for StatPro is to 
work with partners both for distribution 
channels and for up-selling additional 
products. Our secondary focus is to 
migrate our existing clients of StatPro 
Seven to StatPro Revolution and R+ over 
the next three to five years. In the short 
term, progress towards that goal will be 
manifest by the proportion of our existing 
clients of StatPro Seven who have also 
subscribed for StatPro Revolution.
Partnerships
Our strategy is to leverage the clients, 
relationships and expertise of other 
companies. StatPro offers its own 
unique expertise in the form of StatPro 
Revolution and this is something that 
many companies desire but would be 
hard pressed to achieve themselves 
due to the complexity of the underlying 
technology and the access to data. 
The design of StatPro Revolution also 
makes this a practical proposition and 
results in mutual benefits. At the end 
of 2012, we had 21 companies acting 
as distributors for StatPro Revolution 
including six major operators.
The key objective for many of our clients 
is to source as much as possible from one 
supplier. It is, however, impossible for 
any single company to offer everything, 
since mastering the required expertise in 
numerous fields becomes too complex. 
This is where product partners play a

crucial role. We have already partnered 
with IDC to offer their data through the 
StatPro Revolution platform. Now, with a 
simple click of the mouse, a user can buy 
coverage of his portfolio from over 3.2 
million assets. We have also entered into 
an agreement with Russell Investments 
to provide their widely popular indexes 
through StatPro Revolution’s App store, 
uniquely charging on a per portfolio 
basis. This is a significant step for an 
index vendor to take, embracing StatPro 
Revolution’s disruptive business model 
and we are delighted to have secured 
the partnership. We intend to expand 
these services further with other data 
offerings, especially in the area of 
compliance and to work with a number 
of software suppliers using our new web 
application programming interface (‘API’).
Existing clients
For StatPro’s larger clients, the move to 
the cloud represents an opportunity to 
improve productivity and the quality of 
the service they provide to their clients. 
We have kept up a constant dialogue 
with our clients to explain our strategy 
and objectives and this transparency 
has reaped rewards. We now have a 
significant number of existing clients 
using StatPro Revolution and many 
more testing it. Clients can see that 
StatPro Revolution is a quantum step 
up in sophistication and a quantum 
step down in complexity. We have also 
shared our plans for R+, which promises 
to simplify their operations even more.
As StatPro Revolution is a platform for 
distributing analytics and StatPro Seven 
is a system to produce performance 
calculations this means that StatPro 
Revolution cannot replace StatPro Seven, 
but it can certainly enhance it. Only when

we have all R+ modules in full production 
(expected to be by the end of 2014), 
will we be able to replace StatPro Seven 
fully with a cloud-based version. In the 
meantime therefore we are focused 
on maximising the uptake of StatPro 
Revolution by clients of StatPro Seven.
Spreading the service
Sharing is the key functionality that 
will drive StatPro Revolution sales. The 
uniquely simple way of allowing a fund 
manager to share access to a portfolio 
with other people and organisations, sets 
StatPro Revolution apart from anything 
else in the market. As more and more 
people have a portfolio shared with them, 
so they will become aware of StatPro 
Revolution. The depth of analysis available 
in StatPro Revolution and its speed is also 
unique in its sophistication and with each 
release it is getting more sophisticated.
As we emphasise the core benefits of 
the service, so we hope that the product 
will become more and more desirable 
to fund managers and thus also to fund 
administrators. Many fund administrators 
lack specific knowledge of performance or 
risk, but their larger competitors have this 
edge. For them to get all that expertise 
packaged in such a simple way is a real 
benefit. In addition, they can generate 
additional revenues via data services 
for their clients. For clients of fund 
administrators the small fee they would 
pay is well worthwhile to gain access to 
StatPro Revolution without having to do 
any data management. Several of our 
smaller fund administrator partners are 
making great use of StatPro Revolution 
to help sell their overall services.
Training and support
In order to help our many new 
distributors (largely fund administrators), 
we are producing a handbook that 
sets out the key methods of selling 
and supporting analytics. We will be 
offering training courses for their sales 
teams to get familiar with our services 
and help them avoid potential pitfalls. 
Equally, we will offer training courses 
for their support teams to familiarise 
them with common client queries. 
We will also assist in actual sales 
processes in order to promote StatPro 
Revolution as much as possible.
Development
In 2013, we will be focusing on improving 
the sophistication of the sharing function 
and also of our compliance products. 
We will launch a UCITS IV module 
shortly which will target the many 
UCITS funds that exist. The offer greatly 
simplifies the compliance process as 
well as significantly reducing the cost. 
Towards the end of 2013 we plan to 
release an enhanced cloud-based risk 
module, which will effectively replace 
all the current functions available in the 
risk module of StatPro Seven. Clients 
that only have the Risk module of 
StatPro Seven, will be able to upgrade 
to StatPro Revolution at that point.
R+ will have its beta release in the 
middle of 2013 and we will initially target 
clients with significant numbers of small 
portfolios. R+ is designed to handle 
massive amounts of data in an efficient 
manner. It is less the brute force of 
calculation that is often the problem with 
large datasets and more the manner in 
which the user interface enables efficient 
interaction with so much data. Our unique 
graphical interface is specifically designed 
to allow performance teams to handle 
vastly more data, far more efficiently 
than has ever been possible before.
Marketing
We aim to continue to promote StatPro 
Revolution’s strongly differentiated brand 
to increase awareness and generate 
interest in StatPro Revolution. The new 
improved StatPro Store will be launched 
mid-year and it will soon have additional 
modules available for purchase. As the 
number of clients and products grows, 
so marketing will become an increasingly 
important part of our business. The 
barrier to purchase for an existing client 
of StatPro Revolution is significantly lower 
when it comes to an extra module, than 
it is to win the client initially. Whilst these 
things take time to put in place, 2013 
will be a year when we expect significant 
strides to be made towards building the 
underlying foundations for future success.
People
I remain constantly impressed at the 
expertise and resourcefulness of the 
people that work at StatPro. In 2012 I have 
seen even higher levels of motivation and 
pride in working on such an ambitious 
solution like StatPro Revolution. I would 
like to thank each employee for their 
hard work in 2012 and I look forward 
to an even more successful 2013.
Dividend
In line with our policy of paying a 
progressive dividend, which aims 
to balance return to investors 
with our investment needs, we are 
pleased to announce an increase 
in our full year dividend to 2.7p 
per share in 2012 (2011: 2.6p).
Outlook
Transforming the business from one 
technology platform to another is no 
simple task, but it is one that is largely 
done from a product and organisational 
perspective. We believe that over the next 
two to three years we will see continued 
growth in our StatPro Revolution sales. 
In part this will come from our direct 
efforts, but increasingly it will come 
from our growing network of partners 
and also from the viral effect of people 
sharing portfolio access with each 
other. As a result we remain confident 
of a successful outcome for the year.

 ƒ Kalibrate Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2014
I am delighted to issue my …rst statement as the Group’s Chairman. 
This past …nancial year ended 30 June 2014 was a transformational 
period for Kalibrate and marked a signi…cant step forward in the 
Company’s development as a growing business with its successful 
admission to the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange on 
29 November 2013, in which the Company also raised $9 million. 
The admission to AIM and the successful fundraising have placed 
the Company in a strong position to deliver future growth in line 
with its stated strategy, substantially widened its shareholder 
base with the introduction of several high quality institutional 
shareholders and has also raised Kalibrate’s pro…le in the sector. 
I am pleased to report that the Company has made strong progress 
in its …rst year as a quoted company, consistently delivering on 
its commitments and aspirations, which were outlined at the time 
of admission, and we remain excited about the prospects 
for sustained long-term growth.
Results
Alongside this major milestone of admission to AIM, the Group has 
continued to perform strongly. Group revenues have increased by 
18.8% to $28.8 million (2013: $24.2 million), and underlying EBITDA 
also grew to $3.6 million (2013: $3.1 million), an increase of 15.2%, 
despite additional investment as part of the Group’s commitment 
at Initial Public O�ering (“IPO”) to funding future growth. Statutory 
pro¤t aer tax was $0.2 million (2013: $3.2 million) taking account 
of the signi¤cant exceptional expenditure arising from the Group’s 
IPO. Net cash at the year-end was $9.6 million (2013: net debt of 
$0.5 million), as a result of the equity fundraising and the Group’s 
continued pro¤tability.
Strategy
As set out in our Admission Document, the Group has committed to 
strategic development in a number of areas including: new geographical 
expansion, growth in core markets and cross sales to our clients, 
acceleration of the product roadmap and driving Soware as a Service 
(“SaaS”) and managed services conversion. I am pleased to report 
that we have made solid progress across all of these strategic 
initiatives and look forward to continued progress against these 
objectives to drive the Group’s growth in the coming years. 
In addition, as we seek to capitalise on our strategy, on 4 September 2014, 
we announced the launch of Kalibrate Cloud, which is a single-platform, 
cloud-based technology solution. This new service, which will incorporate 
all of our existing products and services in a cloud environment, enhances 
Kalibrate’s o�ering to the global fuel retail industry. We have also 
formed a new division called Strategic Advisory Services to provide 
consultative advice to our clients.

New Directorate appointments 
Following my appointment upon our admission to AIM alongside 
Richard Grogan, the Group has recently announced the appointment 
of Neville Davis as a Non-Executive Director, e�ective from 31 July 2014, 
satisfying its commitment upon admission to AIM of expanding the 
Board with an additional independent Non-Executive Director. Neville 
has a strong track record in general management and ¤nance within 
the technology sector and signi¤cant experience of working with 
growing technology companies looking to achieve growth via 
both organic and acquisitive means. 
We have further strengthened the Board with the appointment of 
Nick Habgood, e�ective from 9 September 2014. Nick is a founder and 
partner of Azini Capital Partners LLP, a UK private equity ¤rm and one 
of our major shareholders, and his experience in the development of 
growth companies will be bene¤cial to Kalibrate’s ongoing trajectory.
Our staƒ
None of the success that Kalibrate has achieved would be possible 
without having established a strong team throughout the business. 
Our ability to recruit, retain and develop our people is an important 
part of our strategy, and on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all employees for their continued dedication to the success of our 
business and look forward to their involvement in our future growth.
Outlook
The Company is continuing to lay solid foundations to support its 
growth. With the global economic outlook continuing to cautiously 
improve, we are moving into a new ¤nancial year with con¤dence 
that we will be able to successfully deliver against the Group’s 
objectives in the year ahead and beyond.

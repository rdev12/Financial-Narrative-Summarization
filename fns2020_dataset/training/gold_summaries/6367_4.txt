CONTRACTS AND RELA TIONSHIPS
G4S has a very diverse contract portfolio. The duration of contracts 
varies from annual sporting events to 25-year private prison contracts. 
In cash solutions, most contracts are annual, with those contracts 
requiring a higher capital intensity being usually fi ve years in duration 
or longer. 
In practice many relationships become long-term and result in contracts 
being renewed year after year.

MARKET AND STRA TEGY
Care & justice services delivers more than 
10% of secure solutions revenue. While the 
care & justice services market is concentrated 
primarily in the UK, US, Australia and 
New Zealand, we see a number of countries 
exploring the possibility of outsourcing these 
services to the private sector.
The market structure is typically 
consolidated on the supply side with 
a small number of providers. Larger 
companies are usually better equipped 
to deliver such highly specialised 
services.

are Loomis and Brink’s in most developed 
markets and local companies in emerging

coverage to differentiate our business 
to customers
 – Drive outsourcing and enhance the value 
of traditional security services through 
greater use of technology (see page 25)

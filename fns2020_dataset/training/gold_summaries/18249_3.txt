 Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 8
chairman’s statement
I am delighted to report a year of significant progress together with a number of positive changes within the Group.
We have had a strong year of growth with revenue increasing by 66.9%. As a result I am able to report our maiden adjusted 
EBITDA profit of £411,000 whilst also reducing our statutory bottom line losses to £84,000, down 87.7% on last year’s loss 
of £676,000.
The increase in revenues largely came from the Managed Hosting division where revenues grew 174% in addition to the 
23.2% increase in the SME Hosting division.
We also completed two acquisitions during the year, acquiring Evohosting, whose tightly knit team effortlessly integrated 
with their Daily counterparts and Q4Ex based in Liverpool. The combination of Netplan’s highly qualified staff and the very 
experienced Q4Ex team was of enormous and immediate benefit to both parties.
We are currently working to integrate the Group further and to make best use of the excellent and highly qualified resource 
our team possess.
Our new CEO Chris Evans has instigated and overseen this change and has made an immediate impact through his 
energy, work ethic and ideas. I extend my thanks to all our dedicated staff who have worked tirelessly to help put us into, 
what we believe, is an increasingly strong position to capitalise on future revenue opportunities.

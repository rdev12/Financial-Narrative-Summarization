Fleet Director
It’s not easy controlling costs when your employees 
are out on the road. You’re often not sure where they 
are, where they’re going, or even if they’re getting the 
job done. 
Fleet Director provides real-time tracking of your 
vehicles from your desktop, to make better use of your 
ﬂ eet and cut costs. While detailed reporting helps you 
monitor vehicle use and improve productivity, time-
saving advanced navigation with live trafﬁ c information 
helps your drivers beat the jams, providing complete 
operational efﬁ ciency.
Delivered via our existing in-vehicle technology, which 
already supports Smartnav navigation and Trackstar 
stolen vehicle tracking, it offers ﬂ eets full integration 
of navigation, ﬂ eet tracking, stolen vehicle tracking and 
live trafﬁ c information.
Already tried and trusted by over 4,000 ﬂ eets operating 
over 85,000 vehicles, Fleet Director can save you time, 
money and even reduce your carbon footprint when on 
the road.

1740 T rafﬁ c Alarms
Setting up a Trafﬁ c Alarm ensures you receive 
personalised SMS alerts warning you of trafﬁ c 
congestion on regular journeys and effectively 
guards your route. You just dial 1740, speak to a 
Trafﬁ cmaster Personal Assistant and simply tell 
them which roads you want to be kept up to date 
about. They will set up your alarm based on your 
preferences, such as the time of day you would 
like to receive alarms and the length of delays 
you want to be told about. Once you have set up 
a Trafﬁ c Alarm for your speciﬁ ed route, you will 
start to receive text messages at the speciﬁ ed 
times to keep you one step ahead of the trafﬁ c.

Stolen V ehicle T racking Systems
Vehicle theft is an unfortunate fact of modern living. 
Alarms, immobilisers and other security devices offer 
a degree of protection, but as thieves get ever more 
resourceful the chances of your vehicle being stolen are 
still high. Vehicle theft is distressing and inconvenient and it 
is most likely that your vehicle will never be recovered.
Some tracking devices rely on Police cars ﬁ tted with 
detection systems to track vehicles. At Trafﬁ cmaster, 
we track the vehicle ourselves and liaise with the Police 
which means not only are you more likely to get your 
vehicle back but there is a much greater chance it won’t 
have been damaged in a high speed chase!
The key to successful recovery is rapid detection. 
Trackstar can instantly pinpoint the exact location of 
a stolen vehicle, which means if your vehicle is taken, 
Trackstar will help get it back! 
Due to its proven success Trackstar is:
— Endorsed by all Police Authorities 
— Insurance approved — may reduce premiums
— Meets The British Insurance Industry’s Quality 
Standards

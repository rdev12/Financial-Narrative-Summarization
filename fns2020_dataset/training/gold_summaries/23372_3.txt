Chairman’s statement 05 Egg plc Annual Report 2002
2002 was an important and
successful year for Egg. In last
year’s report, we made three
important commitments to you,
our shareholders, which I am
delighted to report that we have
achieved. Firstly, we committed
to developing a sustainably
profitable UK business; you will
see in the Financial review that
the UK has reported a profit
before tax of some £35 million
(compared to a £76 million loss
in 2001). Secondly, we committed
to developing an international
business; during the year, we
completed our acquisition of
French online bank Zebank, 
and in November, launched 
our first Egg product in France.
Early data suggests we have
successfully established a
presence in France with Egg
brand awareness already having
reached 55%. Thirdly, we
committed to innovation. 
We have provided enhanced
technology to both improve our
service and relationship with 
our customers, for example 
by helping them understand 
and manage their money 
more effectively through Egg
Money Manager.
Egg is now a company of 
scale. Independent audience
measurement data from Nielsen
Net Ratings has ranked Egg
recently as the largest pure online
bank in the world. We take our
privileged position as market
leader seriously and are aware 
that this means we have even
more reason to set an example 
in our field. This applies to all
aspects of our business – from 
our stand on responsible lending
to customers, to our policies 
in the workplace. 
Egg people have worked 
hard and enthusiastically this 
year, and on behalf of the Board 
I thank them sincerely for their
commitment and energy. It is 
also appropriate for me to thank
the Board for their contribution 
to the Company’s strategic
development and resulting
success. During the year, we 
said good bye to non-executive
director, David Smilow. David
made a very positive contribution
to Egg, for which we thank him,
but he felt he should step down
from his responsibilities at Egg
due to increased business
interests in the United States. 
I am delighted to announce that
during the year, the Board was
further strengthened by the
appointment of Dr. Juan Rada,
whose knowledge and
international experience will be 
of great value to our Board as 
we continue to lead the digital
financial services industry and
develop the business
internationally. We also appointed
Pascal Cagni to the Board of 
Egg Banking plc as non-executive
director, and as you will see from
the enclosed voting cards, we are
proposing at our AGM in April for
him to join the Egg plc Board of
Directors. I heartily recommend
this appointment to you, on the
basis that I believe his wide
experience in international
business and technology will
complement well the existing skills
of your Board.
We have much to do in 
2003, in what is proving to be 
an uncertain and challenging
environment. However, Egg
remains intent on its mission 
to deliver long-term shareholder
value, through building a profitable
international business of scale.
dous” 06 Egg plc Annual Report 2002 Revolutionising customer service We know it is important to invest time
and money in giving customers not only great value products, but also
the best possible service and relationship. We don’t always get it right –
but we try hard to resolve problems quickly and efficiently and to learn
from our mistakes. And we will keep on trying and improving.

broaden horizons
We’ve launched in France From the outset, the intention has been 
for Egg to become an international business of scale. We launched 
our first product, la Carte Egg, in France in November and are 
pleased with its success to date.

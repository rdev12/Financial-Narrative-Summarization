 ‘In the last six months we have 
made good headway executing our 
plan: 136 pitches re-laid resulting in 
a much more attractive proposition 
for customers; development of the 
new Clubhouse format which will 
be trialled later this year; and 
progress on the food and beverage 
proposition. Additionally, we have 
had a successful launch of our 
second club in the USA and are 
due to commence construction of 
our third club in H1 2017. We are 
delivering a better product which 
is already showing in the numbers 
and are confident that we can 
realise our ambitions.’

Chie F exe CUtive o FFiCer’ S review
I’m pleased to confirm that, after a 
strong recovery in H2, the Group has 
returned to like-for-like growth with 
Group like-for-like sales
1
 for the year 
increasing by 0.5% and total sales 
increasing by 1.6% to £33.5m 
(2015: £33.0m).
Since I joined in July 2016, I have 
focused on implementing and 
delivering the key outputs of the 
strategic review. 
A key element of our strategy is to 
reinvest in our business through our 
Arena modernisation programme. In 
2016 we completed the modernisation 
of 136 pitches, with the upgrades 
including ProTurf
TM
, shock absorbers 
and enhanced lighting improving the 
playing characteristics of the pitch. 
We have now invested £5.1m on pitch 
refurbishment, more than has been 
spent cumulatively over the past ten 
years. Importantly this has reduced 
the average pitch age from 7.0 years 
to 4.3 years with this becoming a key 
performance indicator for the 
business. The feedback from our 
customers has been extremely 
positive and we continue to view the 
Arena investment as a driver for 
greater player attraction and retention. 
In 2016 we developed our new brand 
vision and values in association with 
leading creative agency McCann. In 
Q4 we also took the opportunity to 
launch our new team values to our 
frontline teams which has been well 
received and aligns our team 
members with the new strategy for 
the business going forward. Goals has 
also established its ‘Future Leaders’ 
training programme which will ensure 
that the business has the best ‘bench’ 
of talented people who are identified 
to progress onto more senior roles 
when they are ready.

w e look forward to the 
future with growing 
confidence
The brand work with McCann has 
ensured that we have a robust 
customer-led brand story where we 
aim to give customers the chance to 
feel like the pro they dream they 
could be. Our efforts as a brand are 
to ensure that ‘The game means 
more’. Our new brand logo will be 
launched in April 2017 at our Ruislip 
club and will be supported by an 
updated consumer website with 
improvements in speed, ease of 
navigation, better payment methods 
and bespoke marketing.
We will bring to life our brand vision 
through the development of our 
Clubhouse 2020 concept where we 
partnered with Harrison Fraser, one of 
the UK’s leading destination design 
agencies. After extensive work and 
research initial designs are now 
complete. Our goal is to create a 
welcoming environment for our 
customers to increase dwell time and 
ancillary spend but also to create a 
welcoming clubhouse feel. Our vision 
is to create and develop Goals into a 
leisure destination brand rather than 
solely a football business. We have 
also made and are in the process of 
making significant improvements to 
our food and beverage offering with 
an emphasis on better products, 
better value pricing and better 
service. Many of our clubhouses 
require modernisation to provide an 
attractive pre- and post-game 
environment for our customers to 
enjoy the additional products on 
offer. We envisage that Clubhouse 
2020 will do this for the benefit of 
customers and shareholders alike.
Subject to planning and licensing 
permissions, the concept will be 
trialled at our Ruislip, Beckenham, 
Glasgow South and Leeds clubs in 
H1 2017. Thereafter we anticipate that 
after customer feedback and cost 
value engineering it will be rolled out 
across the estate over the following 
18 months at appropriate clubs at a 
cost of around £8.0m, financed from 
existing cash resources. 
We also undertook a full review of each 
of our revenue streams and we now 
have plans in place to enhance each of 
these streams through deeper digital 
connectivity, product innovations and 
improved staff training. We have 
improved products from leagues to 
children’s parties and have taken steps 
to improve, differentiate and enhance 
the experience for customers at all 
stages of their interaction with the 
Goals brand.
The USA remains a key growth market 
for the Company. After a number of 
years of strong performance in the 
USA sales declined by 4.3% in 
constant currency last year. We have 
identified the issues and taken steps 
to strengthen the US business with 
the appointment of a new senior level 
operations executive and we are 
now planning additional support 
from the UK business to help 
improve performance.
Construction of our second US club, 
in Pomona, Los Angeles, completed in 
early February 2017 at a cost of $4.2m 
(£3.3m) significantly less than our 
original South Gate site. It is an 
excellent location. Whilst it is still very 
early days, initial signs are encouraging 
and the first few weeks have surpassed 
the trend seen during the South Gate 
opening phase.
Looking forward, our international 
expansion plans will initially be 
focused on the USA and we have a 
pipeline of options for future openings 
as we seek to grow our US business in 
a controlled and measured manner, 
based on our experiences at Pomona. 
Work has already begun on 
a programme to significantly reduce 
the construction costs of the next 
generation of clubs.
In the UK, we also took steps to 
realign our support office teams to 
reduce costs and better support our 
club teams, but we were also able to 
strengthen our operations, marketing 
and catering team as we ensure we 
have the right support for the 
Clubhouse 2020 project.
In addition to financial measures we 
have implemented a number of 
important non-financial key 
performance indicators that we 
continue to closely monitor and are 
pleased that our Net Promotor Score 
(NPS) for the year stood at 46% 
which compares well with leisure 
industry averages. 
These actions and areas of focus, 
together with other operational 
changes, have been instrumental in 
the improvement in our underlying 
performance, however our task has 
only just begun to put the business 
in a position where it can achieve the 
returns we believe it is capable of. 
I would like to thank all of the Goals 
team for the strong welcome they 
have given me as Chief Executive 
Officer and for their continued hard 
work and dedication in driving 
through the significant changes that 
we have made. 
Our strategic plan outlined in June 
2016 is still in the early stages of 
implementation, however we are 
pleased that Group sales for the 
first 10 weeks of 2017 are above the 
revenue levels achieved during the 
strong start of last year and are in 
line with management expectations.
We look forward to delivering 
continued progress in 2017, 
investing to drive returns for 
shareholders, as we move our 
focus to upgrading our clubhouses 
to the Clubhouse 2020 format in 
the UK and growing our business 
in the US. We look forward to the 
future with growing confidence.

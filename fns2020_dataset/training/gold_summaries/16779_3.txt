Financial highlights
Revenue was £309.6 million (2009:  
£315.1 million). Revenue at organic 
constant currency** was 4.3% higher  
as our core markets recovered from  
the depressed levels of 2009. This, 
coupled with the full-year benefit of  
cost savings implemented in 2009, 
delivered profit before tax of £26.7 million 
(2009: £22.7 million) and basic earnings 
per share before significant items of  
41.9p (2009: 36.5p).
Once again, there has been a strong  
focus on cash management across  
the Group, with free cash generation  
of £18.0 million (2009: £22.7 million)  
and further strengthening of the  
Group’s balance sheet with net debt at  
31 December 2010 totalling £28.1 million 
(2009: £40.6 million). This result has been 
achieved against the background of 
investment in the three market strategy.
The disposal of Clear-Com during the  
year resulted in cash consideration of  
£8.8 million and a profit on disposal  
of £2.2 million before tax.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 11.4p per share (2009: 10.9p). 
Subject to approval by the shareholders  
at the Annual General Meeting, the 
dividend will be paid on 20 May 2011  
to shareholders on the register at the  
close of business on 26 April 2011.  
The full-year dividend of 19.0p  
(2009: 18.3p), equates to a dividend  
cover of 2.2 times (2009: 2.0 times)  
based on basic earnings per share  
before significant items* .
Board changes and employees  
Richard Cotton left the Group as Group 
Finance Director on 4 February 2011  
and has been succeeded by Nick Humby 
as Interim Chief Financial Officer. The 
Board would like to thank Richard for 
his contribution towards the successful 
development of Vitec over the last  
two years.
The Board would also like to thank our 
employees for their commitment to and 
passion for the Company, particularly 
enabling excellent progress to be made on 
the three market strategy and delivering a 
good result for our shareholders in 2010. 
The Vitec Mindset remains central to our 
employees, notably product excellence, 
creative solutions, integrity, customer  
focus and collaboration.
Outlook
In 2010, we laid further foundations for 
future growth with major product launches 
for Manfrotto, key contract wins in MAG, 
the opening of facilities in Brazil and China 
and the consolidation of our Imaging 
operations in Italy and MAG operations  
in New Jersey, USA into new offices.
We will continue to invest in 2011 to 
develop our products and services to 
support the three market strategy of 
Broadcast and Video, Photographic and 
MAG. In particular, we will invest further in 
the Manfrotto Powerbrand. We continue 
to seek value adding acquisitions that are 
consistent with our three market focus.
We are confident that the successful 
execution of our strategy will enable us to 
capitalise on the market opportunities that 
we have identified and deliver increased 
shareholder value over the coming years.

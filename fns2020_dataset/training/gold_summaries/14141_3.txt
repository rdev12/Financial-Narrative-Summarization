Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Chairman’s Statement
Stephen Oke
Chairman
2013 was another challenging year for the global 
mining industry and for your Company in particular. 
Declining commodity prices, a continued focus on 
cost control by incoming management teams, political 
uncertainty in some countries and concerns over poor 
economic growth in China all significantly impacted 
levels of capital expenditure in the sector, which are 
estimated to have fallen by 20% during the year. 
As a result of these factors a 
number of Shaft Sinkers’ contracts 
were delayed, reworked or 
cancelled during the year and this 
has negatively impacted the 
Group’s financial performance in 
2013. Despite significant efforts by 
management to deliver on targets, 
disappointing operational 
performance on key contracts has 
exacerbated the decline in financial 
performance. I can assure you the 
focus of the management team is 
concentrated fully on the 
improvement of our operational 
performance and the negative 
impact on cash flow that has been 
felt as a result.
In addition, the arduous operating 
environment in South Africa 
continues to impact our business 
and industry generally. The 
renewed strike action after the end 
of the year which, at the time of 
writing, has not been resolved 
despite recent further offers being 
made, is debilitating and crippling 
the platinum industry in particular 
and is clearly affecting levels of 
investment. Nevertheless, South 
Africa remains a core market for 
Shaft Sinkers and we hope that the 
business environment will improve 
following elections later in 2014 and 
a sensible resolution to the 
protracted strike action will be 
reached.
As a result of these conditions we 
have had to take a number of 
difficult decisions to reshape the 
business and reduce our cost base 
significantly. I believe, however, that 
the significant resizing of our 
corporate structure that has been 
undertaken to improve our 
profitability levels will not damage 
our ability to service current clients 
or dilute our expertise. We also 
continue to focus on adjusting our 
contracting model to reduce risks 
and improve operational visibility. I 
am delighted that despite these 
difficult conditions Shaft Sinkers 
delivered a creditable health and 
safety performance in 2013 with 
zero fatalities and 2.4 million 
fatality free shifts in the year.
Despite the current uncertain 
environment our strategy remains 
valid: to diversify by building on our 
reputation as a trusted and 
professional operator in order to 
enter new markets around the 
world and to support projects 
beyond just the mining sector.
Shaft Sinkers’ strong heritage and 
successful track record is unique in 
the industry and extremely 
attractive for clients seeking a 
reliable partner to construct the 
type of critical infrastructure in 
which we specialise. The significant 
skills and experience we have built 
over many years are part of our 
core strengths and enable us to 
complete technically complex 
projects safely and reliably. 
In addition to the sector headwinds 
outlined above, during the year we 
have continued to deal with the 
legal action by EuroChem relating 
to the Volga-Kaliy project. We 
reject EuroChem’s allegations in 
the strongest possible manner and 
are defending them vigorously. We 
believe the principal claims are 
entirely without foundation.  Order book by commodity

pleased to report that despite the 
very difficult conditions resulting 
from strike action in South Africa all 
of our teams in the country remain 
ready to assist our clients in line 
with our contractual obligations. 
The outlook for the remainder of 
2014 remains difficult. There is no 
clear sign of when sentiment in our 
core mining markets will improve 
and the added uncertainty over 
how the growing stalemate 
between the major South African 
platinum producers and the 
Association of Mineworkers and 
Construction Union (“AMCU”) will 
be resolved is also of great 
concern. Nevertheless, as a result 
of the measures we have taken, I 
believe that the Group is well 
positioned to weather the current 
market environment. In the longer 
term the outlook remains positive 
for your Company. In an 
environment where brownfield 
developments require mining at 
greater depths, and open cut 
operations make the transition to 
underground, demand for our 
services is likely to grow. In 
addition, in an industry which is 
capital constrained, mining 
companies are likely to focus on 
extending the lives of existing 
operations where significant costs 
have already been sunk rather than 
investing in new projects that may 
have greater risk.

Furthermore, we continue to 
pursue EuroChem to recover the 
amounts it owes us. 
Dealing with these damaging 
allegations continues to take up a 
significant amount of board and 
management time as well as 
financial resources. We have made 
a number of submissions to the 
arbitrators, and expect the hearing 
to occur in mid 2014 with final 
determinations expected early in 
2015.
Given the range of challenges that 
the Group is currently facing and 
the resulting short-term cash 
pressures especially in South 
Africa, the Board has elected to 
pay no final dividend.
I would like to thank our employees 
for their considerable efforts in 
what is an extremely difficult time 
for our sector and the Group. The 
business is dependent upon the 
hard work, dedication and skills of 
all of our employees wherever they 
are based. In particular I am 
pleased to report that despite the 
very difficult conditions resulting 
from strike action in South Africa 
all of our teams in the country

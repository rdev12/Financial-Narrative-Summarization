One million man-hours 
injury-free
The Costain Carillion JV reached another 
major safety milestone on the M1 
Junctions 10-13 project. The project, 
which has an inducted workforce of over 
4,000 people, has again achieved one 
million man-hours injury free. It is the 
fourth time the project has reached this 
milestone since work began on the 
project in 2009, and to celebrate the 
team decided to donate £500 to 
Leagrave Primary School in Luton.
The new managed motorway scheme, 
which aims to relieve congestion by 
using technology to vary the speed limit, 
went live between Junctions 10 and 11 
in July 2012.

Major milestones 
reached at London 
Power Tunnels
Costain has reached a number of 
significant milestones in the construction 
of three deep level tunnels as part of the 
London Power Tunnels contract for 
National Grid.
Evelyn dug its way to its first destination, 
a pre-prepared shaft deep below 
National Grid’s Channel Gate Road 
offices, after beginning its journey from 
Willesden Substation earlier this year.
Cleopatra is digging the other 13km  
of the route and is approximately a 
kilometre away from her launch site in 
Har inge y . 	 T unne lling 	 w or k 	 is 	 scheduled	
for completion in 2014.
David Luetchford, National Grid’s  
He ad 	 o f 	 Cable 	 T unne ls , 	 said : 	 “ T he	
breakthrough represents another major 
step towards the completion of this vital 
project. Our breakthrough at Channel 
Gate Road is just one part of a much 
bigger story which involves us deploying 
the best talent and technology available 
to help ensure the lights stay on.”
A8 Belfast to Larne 
underway
The Northern Ireland Minister for 
Regional Development, Danny Kennedy 
MLA, has signalled the start of the  
A8 Belfast to Larne Dualling (a Costain 
joint venture project) by cutting the first 
sod of the £102 million scheme.
T he 	 Minist e r 	 said : 	 “ T he se 	 w ork s , 	 which	
will take 34 months to complete, are of 
significant importance to the economic 
development of Northern Ireland.”
Started in August 2012, the works are 
expected to be completed in spring 2015.
Costain appointed to 
£288 million Magnox 
framework contract
Magnox has awarded a framework 
contract worth around £288 million  
for the delivery of construction, 
infrastructure and maintenance projects 
across all ten sites which are operated  
by Magnox on behalf of the Nuclear 
Decommissioning Authority.
It is estimated that 55,000 tonnes  
of concrete, 1,300 tonnes of steel 
reinforcement and 310,000 tonnes of 
bituminous material will be used for the 
scheme, which will lead to an increase  
in demand for local suppliers of 
construction material.

 04 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
Revenues grew 45.2% in 2008 to £622.7 million (2007: 
£428.8 million) with Group operating proﬁ t before other items
(1)
 
growing by 68.0% to £65.0 million (2007: £38.7 million). Group 
operating proﬁ t increased by 46.6% to £52.5 million (2007: 
£35.8 million).
The Group is ﬁ rmly positioned in the downstream energy 
infrastructure sector with some 70% of Cape’s 2008 revenues 
generated from capital and maintenance expenditures by 
customers in the power generation, oil and gas and 
petrochemical industries. Cape’s customers principally comprise 
a diverse set of the world’s largest integrated and independent 
energy companies and major international engineering 
contractors engaged in multi-year projects in the sector. Through 
its Australian acquisitions, Cape now also provides its services to 
the mineral resources sector. Cape’s speciality multi-disciplinary 
services such as the provision of common user access systems, 
insulation, ﬁ re protection, abrasive blasting, refractory, cleaning 
and other essential services are required on an ongoing basis 
throughout the lifecycle of large industrial assets. 
Despite the reported growth, 2008 was a year of consolidation for 
the Group with the completion of the regional structure and the 
repositioning, restructuring and integration of the three Australian 
acquisitions. The Group is now well on the path to having a fully 
integrated industrial services business in Australia providing the 
full range of Cape services.
Debt reduction
The Group’s net debt (excluding Scheme cash) reduced by 
12.5% to £165.5 million in the year (2007: £189.2 million) only 
£0.5 million outside of the guidance range of £160.0 million to 
£165.0 million signalled at the half year. The Group’s net 
debt to adjusted EBITDA
(3)
 of 2.1 times (2007: 4.0 times) 
provides adequate headroom compared with the Group’s 
covenanted level. 
Private equity interest
The Board received approaches from a number of interested 
parties and entered into discussions with a view to generating 
further shareholder value through an offer for the Company. 
The Board concluded that the likelihood of an acceptable offer 
being received in a reasonable timeframe, avoiding a prolonged 
and distracting period of uncertainty, was low. As announced 
on 16 February 2009, all these discussions were therefore 
terminated.
Move to the Main Market
The Company is no longer considering a move to the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange as a short-term objective.
People
Cape continues to invest in the recruitment, development and 
retention of high quality management teams. In 2008, we 
welcomed several new senior executives to the Group all of 
whom bring with them proven track records, technical expertise 
and the depth of specialist knowledge necessary to deliver 
Cape’s increasing range of services across its enlarged 
geographic span. 
This has been another milestone year for Cape and 
the fourth consecutive year of signiﬁ cant growth. 
It reﬂ ects a full year contribution from the acquisitions 
in 2007 as well as continued organic growth from 
the underlying business.
Chairman’s statement 05 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
The Group’s investment in ensuring the safety of our people in 
2008 increased signiﬁ cantly with the launch of the Golden Rules 
and CapeSafe programmes throughout the business combined 
with speciﬁ c investment in the acquisitions to bring them into line 
with Cape standards. Cape is committed to providing the safest 
work environment for our people. 
Cape delivered over 41 million man hours in 2008 (2007: 
33 million). On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our 
employees for their continuing dedication and commitment, and 
the Executive Board and regional management teams, under 
whose leadership the business is evolving and again delivering 
a record ﬁ nancial performance.
Board
I replaced David McManus as Chairman at the Company’s 
AGM in June 2008. David remains on the Board of Cape and is 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. Richard Bingham 
joined the Board in June 2008 as Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer.
Outlook
With 70% of our revenues from the downstream energy, power 
generation and later cycle production markets our business is 
only partially impacted by lower energy prices. The higher levels 
of activity seen in the second half of 2008 have continued into 
2009. We believe that demand for energy over the medium term 
across our enlarged and now established footprint will present 
good opportunities for further growth.
In this environment the Group’s focus will continue to be on 
optimising the efﬁ ciency of Cape’s bundled services model, 
maximising free cash ﬂ ow generation and continued net debt 
reduction. With scheduled debt repayments for 2009 of 
£15.0 million the Board remains conﬁ dent that the Group’ s 
debt servicing obligations can be more than met from operating 
cash ﬂ ow.
I am conﬁ dent that our strategy will continue to deliver positive 
results in the current market conditions.

The Archipelago Board of Directors
Chairman’s statement
Stephen K Sulistyo
Non-Executive Chairman
26 April 2012
Overview
T o our shareholders, 2011 was an 
exciting year for Archipelago, as the 
Company successfully transitioned 
from developer to full production 
status. There are few other companies 
in the region which have achieved 
such a move in recent times and, on 
behalf of my fellow Directors, I am 
pleased to provide shareholders with 
this update.
Progressing into 2012, Archipelago 
remains fully funded and is set to 
become a strong cash generator.  
Our robust production profile, 
comparatively low cost base and 
strong social licence are core 
strengths for the Company.
Archipelago continues to increase  
its operational scale and output; 
supporting growth initiatives 
organically and by leveraging off our 
high quality T oka Tindung asset base. 
This foundation mine, a strong balance 
sheet and exploration upside, support 
Archipelago’s growing profile in the 
region and more broadly. With South 
East Asian collaboration being of 
particular interest, Archipelago is well 
placed to take a leading role in gold 
sector consolidation.
Moving forward, Archipelago is also 
committed to expanding our 
exploration and near site drilling 
programme, with potential reserve 
increases providing the impetus to 
examine throughput expansion 
options. In this regard, Archipelago  
is setting the foundation to 
exponentially grow our production 
base at Toka Tindung. Conceptually, 
greater reserves and incremental 
infrastructure changes are likely to 
provide a basis for material increases 
in low cost ounce production.
We are now building a team that can 
leverage the quality of the T oka Tindung 
asset, to grow the business and create 
significant shareholder returns. 05 Archipelago Resources plc  
Annual Report 2011
Business review Governance Financial statements
The Indonesian economy is the 
largest in South East Asia. Since 2004, 
it has enjoyed a significant rise in 
economic growth resulting in the 
credit rating agencies upgrading 
Indonesia’s sovereign debt. In this 
regard, the strength of the Indonesia 
economy provides a robust local 
business environment; which is to the 
benefit of Archipelago. I am also 
pleased to report that during the year 
our work within the communities 
around the mine continued and the 
Company maintains its excellent 
relations with the local community 
leaders and the regional government. 
With 11 villages and over 11,000 
people surrounding the operations, it 
is worth remembering the significant 
contribution that the Company makes 
to local communities from an 
employment, procurement, 
investment and cultural perspective. 
During the year, the Company 
continued to invest in schools, 
infrastructure, medical services and 
treatments, as well as community 
centres and fresh water supply 
systems. Archipelago also continues 
to adhere to the highest 
environmental standards.
Archipelago closely observes policy 
and legislative developments in 
Indonesia. For example, the 
Government recently issued a law 
requiring foreign owned IUP* holders 
to divest some of their interests in 
Indonesian mineral projects after five 
years of commercial production. The 
new divestment regime will not apply 
to Archipelago’s mining concessions, 
which are based on two binding and 
pre-existing Contract of Work 
arrangements. Notwithstanding, 
Archipelago continues to monitor 
political and regulatory changes in 
Indonesia.
On behalf of the Board of Directors,  
I would like to thank our shareholders 
for their ongoing support and we look 
forward to further growth and 
progress throughout 2012.
* IUP refers to “Izin Usaha Pertambangan” which 
translates as mining business licence.

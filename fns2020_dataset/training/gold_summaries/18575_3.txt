2015 has been an excellent year  
for Gamma, with revenue and profit 
continuing to increase.
Introduction
I am very pleased to present the 
full year report on the results of 
Gamma Communications plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2015, my first 
following its successful IPO and listing 
on the AIM on 10 October 2014.
Gamma operates in the very dynamic 
UK communications market; a market 
that is increasingly hard to define as the 
boundary between communications 
and IT blurs. This presents many new 
opportunities.
Overview of results
Group turnover for the year ended 
31 December 2015 increased by £18.6m 
to £191.8m (2014: £173.2m), an increase 
of 10.7% on the prior year. Of this increase 
£15.1m came from the indirect channels 
business where turnover increased to 
£152.0m (2014: £136.9m), while £3.5m 
came from the direct business which 
saw turnover increase to £39.8m 
(2014: £36.3m). Gross profit for the year 
to 31 December 2015 rose to £82.3m an 
increase of 21.7% compared to the £67.6m 
achieved in 2014, whilst the gross margin 
increased to 42.9% (2014: 39.0%). 
Adjusted EBITDA, (being before 
exceptional items and share based 
payments) for the Group increased 
by 22.5% to £28.3m (2014: £23.1m).
Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 
increased by 19.3% to 17.9p (2014: 15.0p) 
(EPS is adjusted for share based 
payments, exceptional items and 
the tax effect thereon).
The net operating cash inflow (pre-tax 
and non-recurring income from the ladder 
pricing settlement) for the year was £25.3m 
compared to £19.4m in 2014. 
This represents a cash to adjusted EBITDA 
conversion ratio in respect of 2015 of 89%, 
compared to 84% for 2014. Net cash 
as at 31 December 2015 amounted to 
£24.8m, which is significantly up from 
£13.4m as at 31 December 2014. 
Dividend 
As stated at the time of the IPO, Gamma is 
committed to a progressive dividend policy. 
The Board is therefore pleased to propose 
a final dividend, in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2015, of 4.4p per 
share (2014: 3.95p) which, subject to the 
necessary shareholder approval at the 
forthcoming AGM, will be payable on 
23 June 2016 to shareholders on the 
register on Friday 3 June 2016. When 
added to the 2.2p interim dividend this 
makes a total dividend of 6.6p for the 
year as a whole.
Exceptional gain
Gamma had previously reported a 
contingent asset which related to ladder 
pricing. Ladder pricing was a mechanism 
which was used by fixed line operators 
to bill other operators for calls to certain 08 
numbers. Gamma had been in commercial 
negotiations for a settlement in regard to 
its ladder pricing policy with the affected 
operators and these have now concluded, 
resulting in an exceptional gain to 
Gamma of £5.7m for the year ending 
31 December 2015.
Business development 
I am pleased that the business has grown 
across a range of fronts, the number of 
channel partners has grown as has the 
average volume of trading with each 
partner. The shift to more strategic products 
continues and the direct business has 
grown successfully, winning larger 
accounts, such as Taylor Wimpey in the 
Enterprise market and Peabody Housing  
in the charity sector.

Gamma Communications plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Gaining a strong position on the new 
Government Crown Commercial Services 
framework (RM1045) opens up new 
markets in the public sector, both directly 
and through our channel partners, and 
we have strengthened our sales team 
in this area.
In December 2014 Gamma purchased 
the control equipment that provides the 
core of a mobile network. The Board is very 
pleased with the progress that was made 
during 2015 in building this capability into  
a “full MVNO” ready for a planned service 
launch in June 2016. 
Given BT’s acquisition of EE, the 
timing of that launch is very opportune. 
Business customers are increasingly 
looking to buy all their communications 
services from a single supplier and this 
new mobile capability positions Gamma 
as one of only a small number of operators 
that have full technical capability across 
fixed telephony, mobile telephony and 
data services.
Board and employees 
On 1 December 2015 I was delighted  
to welcome Richard Bligh onto the Board 
as Chief Operating Officer reporting to 
Bob Falconer, Chief Executive Officer. 
Richard had previously been the 
Company’s Group Marketing Director 
and Managing Director of Gamma’s Direct 
Mid-Market Channel. Richard has been 
with Gamma since 2004 and has over 
20 years’ experience in telecoms 
in a variety of marketing and business 
development roles. 
The senior executives, managers and 
employees are the bedrock of Gamma  
and they have significantly contributed  
to the creation of the successful company 
we have today. I should like to thank them 
for their consistent hard work and 
continued support.
Gamma is fully supportive of apprenticeship 
schemes and employee volunteering 
within the local community and has a 
policy of matched funding for charitable 
activities by staff. Employee motivation 
and development are fundamental 
principles of Gamma and lead to a 
stronger and more successful business.
Outlook 
The Board looks forward enthusiastically  
to 2016 and beyond. The emerging market 
for converged fixed and mobile services 
presents many opportunities, and Gamma 
is well placed to exploit these with its clear 
focus on the UK business market and its 
commitment to new product development. 
We believe that Gamma has the 
experience, resources and capabilities  
to continue to achieve its objectives.

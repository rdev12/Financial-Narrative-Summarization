This has been an excellent year for Biofusion 
in which we have continued to expand both our 
university base and our portfolio of companies.
THE CARDIFF PIPELINE
The Cardiff agreement gives Biofusion exclusive 
rights, over ten years, to all Cardiff’s rights to IP 
generated by Cardiff research and to commercialise 
this IP through the formation of portfolio companies. 
The Directors estimate that the research spend 
available to Cardiff over the life of the Cardiff 
agreement will be well in excess of £1 billion. 
Biofusion will initially hold 100% of the equity 
in each new Cardiff portfolio company and will 
then allocate an appropriate proportion to the 
academics involved in these companies.
TRANSFERRED PORTFOLIO COMPANIES
As part of the agreement Cardiff’s shareholding 
in seven existing companies (see table below) 
were transferred to Biofusion, in return for loan 
notes of £1.4m (£1.65m including the post year 
end transfer of Cardiff Biologicals).

OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES
We now have 24 companies in our portfolio:
Portfolio companies as at 31 July 2006 12
New companies started/acquired in the year 13
Companies exited during the year 1
Portfolio companies as at 31 July 2007 24
New companies added post year end 1
Companies exited post year end 2
Successes in our portfolio during the period include:
ASTERION
Biofusion shareholding 
34% 
Asterion is developing next-generation therapeutic 
proteins with superior pharmacological proﬁles 
that will improve the current treatment options 
for patients with chronic diseases. It owns a 
novel, patented therapeutic platform technology, 
ProFuse
TM
, which has tremendous utility and 
versatility and can be applied to a huge number 
of cytokine families and targets to generate 
novel, IP-protected, next-generation 
biopharmaceutical products. 
Asterion’s most advanced product is a long-acting 
growth hormone (GH) agonist product for the 
treatment of growth disorders, which is being 
developed in a strategic alliance with Ipsen. 
The company has internal programmes for other 
cytokine targets which include erythropoietin 
(AFT™-EPO), G-CSF (AFT™ – GCSF), interferons 
(AFT™ – Inteferon α and AFT™ – Inteferon ß) and 
leptin (AFT™ – Leptin).
Post year end Asterion’s technology, exempliﬁed 
with GH, was published in the world renowned 
scientiﬁc journal ‘Nature Medicine’. The current 
therapeutic procedure for GH replacement in 
adults and children requires once daily injections 
of GH which are inconvenient, expensive and can 
be painful. The Nature paper reports that tests 
with the Asterion version of GH showed that a 
single injection promoted growth for ten days, 
which is far superior when compared with 
conventional GH. The ability to apply this 
technology to create a wide variety of therapeutic 
proteins lead the Directors to believe that this 
technology can lead to a next generation of 
recombinant protein therapeutics. 
During the year we strengthened Asterion’s 
management team with the appointment of 
Dr Kevin Bryett as Chairman, Dr Raymond 
Barlow as CEO and Dr David Lawrence as 
a Non-executive Director.
During the year we committed to invest 
a further £265,000 in Asterion.
SIMCYP
Biofusion shareholding 
25%
 Simcyp’s informatics platform and consultancy 
services enable pharmaceutical companies 
to simulate drug behaviour in humans prior 
to running clinical trials. The software uses virtual 
population data, rather than data from just one 
‘average’ individual. This allows patients at 
extreme risk from adverse reaction to be 
identiﬁed at an early stage. In addition, potential 
drug-drug interactions can also be predicted, 
thus enabling Pharmaceutical companies to 
tailor their testing programmes on humans in 
an informed way. Simcyp continues to expand 
its operations with turnover up 34% year on year 
at £1.99m (2006: £1.48m) and proﬁts up 39% 
to £0.53m (2006: £0.38m).
DIURNAL
Biofusion shareholding 
60%
During the year Diurnal, which owns the 
patent rights to Chronocort™, a modiﬁed 
release formulation of hydrocortisone to 
treat adrenal insufﬁciency, announced that 
Phoqus Pharmaceuticals Ltd, the speciality 
pharmaceutical company with whom it is 
developing Chronocort™, had raised £6.5m, 
gross of expenses, to progress Chronocort™ into 
Phase III clinical trials. The product is designed 
to release hormone at concentrations that mimic 
the natural level of hormone in the body. This is 
considered very important in controlling disease 
symptoms and reducing unwanted side effects. 
Chronocort™, which has European Orphan 
Medicinal Product designation, is expected to 
be ready for market within two years generating 
signiﬁcant royalty revenues for Diurmal in a 
market worth in excess of £100m.
During the year we invested £126,000 and 
committed to a further investment of £99,000 to 
expand its product pipeline and fund development 
work on three additional patented products.
Cardiff University, established in 1883, has an international reputation for the quality of its teaching and research. 
In August 2004 Cardiff merged with the renowned University of Wales College of Medicine, one of the UK’s leading 
medical schools, and now has more than 5,000 staff and 22,000 students.
A member of the exclusive Russell Group of research-led universities, Cardiff is:
  ranked 7th in the latest RAE (2001) based on average weighted RAE grade;
  ranked joint 8th in the latest RAE (2001) for the number of schools rated “5” and “5*” (being the highest ratings) 
in areas which the Directors consider to be the most likely to generate IP with commercialisation potential; and
  ranked 5th in the Times Higher Education Supplement 2006 review of university income generated from IP .
In the year to 31 July 2006 Cardiff had a research income of £77m representing a 51% increase over the last 
two years and has invested over £100m in its infrastructure over the last ﬁve years. In July 2007 Cardiff announced 
that it was on course for a record breaking research income year and had already secured research contract awards 
in excess of £100m.

OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES CONTINUED
PHASE FOCUS
Biofusion shareholding 
56%
Phase Focus is developing an alternative approach 
to microscopy and imaging that does not require 
sophisticated lenses and has applications in 
optical, x-ray and electron microscopy, amongst 
others. Phase Focus, owns the rights to patents 
for a process that can generate high deﬁnition 
images of an object without the need for the high 
quality lenses that account for a signiﬁcant element 
of the cost of high-performance microscopes. 
The Directors believe that Phase Focus’ 
breakthrough technology has the potential 
to create a new generation of ‘lensless’ 
microscopes, which will produce better images 
at a lower cost in a market which is forecast 
to grow to $1.6 billion by 2009.
During the year we invested £314,000 in Phase 
Focus and committed to invest a further £86,000.
ABSYNTH BIOLOGICS
Biofusion shareholding 
60%
During the year we created Absynth Biologics, 
which is developing vaccines and antibodies 
to treat infections caused by the bacterium 
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), including 
its more difﬁcult-to-treat drug-resistant form, 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Hospital 
acquired infections are an increasing public 
health concern and are responsible for a rise 
in the number of hospital deaths. Absynth’s 
unique patented technology has been developed 
at the University of Shefﬁeld and initially is being 
used to develop an MSRA vaccine and antibodies 
to treat signiﬁcant MRSA related infections as 
well as other applications.
During the year we invested £140,000 in 
Absynth Biologics and committed to invest 
a further £185,000.
AXORDIA
Biofusion shareholding 
45% 
Axordia, one of the UK’s leading stem cell 
companies, announced it had received 
signiﬁcant support for its research programme, 
in collaboration with Shefﬁeld and Lombard 
Medical Technologies, through a £0.9m grant 
from the DTI and MRC, for the development, 
through to clinical trials, of a regenerative stent – 
a new generation treatment for cardiovascular 
disease. Axordia also announced its participation 
in the European Commission “ESTOOLS” 
programme. ESTOOLS is a world leading €12m 
stem cell research initiative that will advance the 
fundamental understanding and biomedical 
applications of human embryonic stem cells. 
Axordia is a major partner in the London Project 
to Cure Blindness, to which Axordia will be 
supplying all the RPE cell lines. This project has 
funding of £4m and plans to complete human 
trials to cure Age Related Macular Degeneration 
(AMD) within four years.
During the year we invested £378,000 in Axordia 
taking our shareholding to 45%.
Q-CHIP
Biofusion shareholding 
10%
Q-Chip develops advanced life science and 
therapeutic products using its proprietary 
MicroPlant platform for the production 
of precision loaded polymer microspheres. 
In July 2007 Q-Chip secured £2m of equity 
investment from groups including CPF, 
E-Synergy, Finance Wales, Jon Moulton 
and Biofusion. This investment should enable 
Q-Chip to develop and exploit three core 
precision microsphere products: 
  ReaX – for advanced bead based molecular 
reagents and cell assays. 
  BiologiX – benign and efﬁcient encapsulation 
system for the delivery and sustained release 
of biopharmaceutical drugs. 
  IonX – microsphere system for delivery 
and controlled release of small 
molecule therapies. 
During the year we invested £47,000 in Q-Chip 
and committed to invest a further £78,000.
MAGNOMATICS
Biofusion shareholding 
54%
In April 2007 we announced that we had taken 
over the University of Shefﬁeld’s 55% shareholding 
in one of their non-life science spin out companies, 
Magnomatics Ltd (Magnomatics). Magnomatics 
specialises in the development of novel high-torque 
magnetic gearboxes, motors and generators 
for use within wind turbine power generation, 
transportation and domestic energy products.
High-torque mechanical gearboxes, such as 
those used in the expanding domestic and 
industrial wind power generation market, can 
suffer expensive permanent damage if a gusting 
wind applies too great a load to their mechanical 
drive systems. Magnomatics patented ‘pseudo’ 
direct drive motor/generator systems removes 
the risk of expensive damage from high winds 
with the added beneﬁt of being lighter, lubrication 
free and more efﬁcient than a conventional high 
torque gearbox. The technology has additional 
applications in the aerospace and hybrid 
vehicle markets.
Magnomatics trades proﬁtably.
BIOHYDROGEN
Biofusion shareholding 
60%
In April 2007 we announced the creation of 
Biohydrogen Limited (Biohydrogen), which is 
developing a metabolically engineered microbial 
production method for producing hydrogen from 
fermentable sugars and water. Initial results 
indicate that this unique method of production 
has the potential to be at the forefront of new 
low carbon fuel technology developments.
There is signiﬁcant interest in all forms 
of renewable ‘clean’ energy technologies 
to combat global warming, in response to 
the depletion of and increasing price of fossil 
fuels and to address energy security problems.

Biohydrogen aims to develop a unique 
microbiological method of producing hydrogen 
for the industrial hydrogen market and any future 
hydrogen energy related market. 
The company’s ofﬁces and laboratories 
are based in Shefﬁeld’s Bioincubator.
During the year we invested £54,000 in Biohydrogen 
and committed to invest a further £146,000.
ABCELLUTE
Biofusion shareholding 
34%
Abcellute’s patent protected cell stabilising 
platform technology enables the non-frozen 
preservation and transport of live organ-derived 
cells without the loss of viability or function. 
The Abcellute product is currently being sold 
to pharmaceutical companies in the UK, Europe 
and Japan for pre-clinical drug testing and the 
company is actively expanding these sales to 
Asia and the USA. In the long-term, the company 
plans to develop the preservation technology to 
provide products for cell-based therapeutics. 
During the year we invested £56,000 in Abcellute 
and then subsequent to the year end, Abcellute 
raised £400,000 from Biofusion (£200,000) and 
Finance Wales (£200,000), increasing Biofusion’s 
shareholding to 34%.
PLASSO TECHNOLOGY
Biofusion shareholding 
9%
During the year as part of the sale of Plasso 
Technology (UK) Limited (Plasso) to Becton, 
Dickinson and Company, Biofusion disposed 
of its 9% shareholding in Plasso. Financial 
terms of the deal were not disclosed.
LIFESTYLE CHOICES
Biofusion shareholding 
60%
Lifestyle Choices sells the Plan Ahead test which 
is a patented triple hormone ovarian reserve test 
that helps a woman to make a more informed 
decision about whether to try for a baby sooner 
rather than later.
In October 2007 Lifestyle Choices announced 
it had signed a licence agreement with an 
undisclosed leading US reproductive diagnostics 
company (the Partner), for the exclusive rights to 
sell the Lifestyle Choices’ Plan Ahead test, which 
helps measure a woman’s egg reserves, in North 
America and Canada. Under the terms of the 
agreement, the Partner will be given exclusive 
rights to market, sell and distribute Plan Ahead in 
North America and Canada through its extensive 
network of speciality physicians. Lifestyle Choices 
will receive an agreed fee, on a sliding scale, per 
test that is sold with a commitment by the Partner 
Asterion is developing a range of third-generation therapeutic proteins that will 
improve the current treatment options for patients with chronic diseases. Using 
its novel, patented ProFuse
TM
 therapeutic platform Asterion is generating and 
developing long-acting biopharmaceutical products that can be administered at a 
lower dose, less frequently and with fewer side effects than existing marketed drugs.
Asterion is adopting a lower risk development strategy by developing third-generation 
Asterion Fusion T echnology (AFT™) therapeutic proteins that address unmet clinical 
and commercial needs in large markets where the targets are validated, the clinical 
development path is known and the commercial opportunity is clear. 
These proprietary, best-in-class, third-generation, therapeutic products are being 
developed and commercialised through a combination of internal programmes 
and external collaborations.
Asterion’s most advanced product is a long-acting Growth Hormone agonist

to selling an agreed minimum number of tests 
per year. The Partner expects to commence sales 
of the Plan Ahead test at the end of 2007. 
Subsequent to the year end we announced the 
addition of one more company to our portfolio, 
an investment in two companies and the sale 
of two companies to Morvus:
CARDIFF BIOLOGICALS
Biofusion shareholding 
50%
In September, as part of the Cardiff agreement, 
we took over Cardiff’s 25% share holding 
in Cardiff Biologicals. Cardiff Biological’s 
technology is based on Professor Wen Jiang’s 
research specialising in anti-angiogenesis 
products for the treatment of cancer. Their lead 
compound is KVE702, a novel, hybrid molecule 
combining anti-angiogenic activity and endothelial 
cell regulatory activity. KVE702 has completed 
its research phase and is now ready to enter 
full development. This protein comprises two 
functional sequences each with a different mode 
of action and so has the potential for dual action 
giving rise to a greater anti-angiogenic activity. 
Subsequent to taking over the University’s 25% 
shareholding, Biofusion invested £200,000, 
increasing our shareholding to 50%.
CARDIFF PROTIDES
Biofusion shareholding 
50%
Cardiff Protide’s technology is based 
on Professor Christopher McGuigan’s research 
which enables the discovery of new and 
improved nucleoside based drugs. This 
approach has been successfully utilised with a 
number of major pharmaceutical companies in 
the anti-viral ﬁeld and has more recently been 
applied in the anti-cancer ﬁeld. Cardiff Protide’s 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
CONTINUED
Based on the work of Professor John Rodenburg, Phase Focus is developing 
microscope and imaging devices that do without the need for traditional 
focussing devices such as lenses or zone plates. This reduces instrument 
cost and banishes the distortions and aberrations that are inherent in even 
the most sophisticated of today’s microscopes. Moreover, it provides images 
showing not only how much illumination is absorbed by the specimen, but also 
how much the specimen changes the “phase” of the illumination. 
Potentially applicable to a wide variety of imaging applications and, most particularly, 
to microscopy, the application to electron microscopy is expected to create a 
revolution in visualisation at the nano-scale. Indeed, if the same gain in resolution 
already achieved for x-rays is achieved at electron wavelengths, it will be possible 
to resolve every atom in an extended object with unprecedented resolution.
Phase Focus’s truly disruptive technology solves a fundamental challenge 
in imaging science and promises users, in industries as diverse as bioscience 
and semiconductor manufacturing, the possibility of observing and analysing 
their materials, processes and products in new ways and with unprecedented 
clarity and ease.

vision is to become a leading developer of 
cutting edge nucleoside based pharmaceuticals 
targeted at areas of unmet medical need, initially 
for the treatment of cancer. 
Subsequent to the year end Biofusion invested 
£200,000, increasing our shareholding to 50%.
SALE OF CARDIFF PROTIDES AND 
CARDIFF BIOLOGICALS TO MORVUS
On 10 October 2007 Morvus, a privately owned 
pharmaceutical company specialising in the 
discovery and development of novel oncology 
therapies, acquired Biofusion’s shareholdings 
in Cardiff Protides and Cardiff Biologicals. 
Morvus’ facilities at their new laboratories in Wales, 
combined with their expertise in pharmaceutical 
development, convinced the board of Biofusion 
that the new combined company could be a 
world leader in the provision of specialist oncology 
drugs and provided the best opportunity for 
bringing Cardiff Protides and Cardiff Biologicals 
exciting lead compounds to market. 
Morvus has raised over £3.4m in equity ﬁnance 
to date and its most recent funding, largely 
concluded in July 2007, valued Morvus at 
approximately £12m, based on a price of 30p per 
share. As a result of the sale Biofusion now owns 
13,698,630 shares in Morvus, giving it a 20% 
shareholding in the enlarged company.
However, the valuation of the transaction is 
based on Morvus’ last funding round and given 
that these shares were privately held, the Directors 
of Biofusion will take a conservative view to 
recognising this value in Biofusion’s accounts. 
Our intention will be to re-evaluate this value at 
Morvus’ next third party funding round.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
RESULTS
The group’s reported loss for the year increased 
by 53% to £2.9m (2006: £1.9m), but was broadly in 
line with budget. The losses reﬂect the incremental 
costs of the Cardiff operations for the last six 
months of the ﬁnancial year and an increase in 
the number of portfolio companies classiﬁed as 
subsidiaries, for which overheads and losses are 
consolidated into the group’s results.
Turnover has increased by 26% to £351,000 
(2006: £279,000) and represents the amounts 
charged to associated companies for management 
services provided and the turnover of consolidated 
portfolio companies. The gross proﬁt margin of 
91% is consistent with 2006.
Administrative expenses for the year, before 
exceptional items, were £3.0m (2006: £1.4m). 
This increase was due to the following:
  incremental costs associated with operations 
established alongside Cardiff University, 
within the Fusion Cardiff subsidiary £170,000;
  increased expenditure incurred 
in newly acquired/created portfolio 
subsidiaries £208,000;
  increased expenditure in existing portfolio 
subsidiaries £584,000 (2006: £285,000) 
as they continue through their research 
and development phases; and
  impairment of ﬁxed asset 
investments £652,000.
As a result of the Cardiff University pipeline 
agreement, an intangible asset of £15.9m was 
recognised in accordance with FRS 10 “Goodwill 
and intangible assets”. The asset is being amortised 
on a straight line basis through the proﬁt and 
loss account over the length of the agreement. 
The charge of £0.9m has been represented 
within exceptional items by virtue of its size in 
comparison to normal administrative expenses.
The Company’s adoption of FRS 20 “Share-based 
payments” has resulted in a prior year restatement 
and exceptional charge of £1.3m. This principally 
relates to the warrants granted to NPI Ventures 
on 23 March 2006. This charge has no impact 
on net assets and will not be recurring. Also 
included in the prior year was a £0.2m net credit 
following the impairment of goodwill relating to the 
acquisition of Bioacta Limited and the release of 
related loan notes and accrued interest.
Interest income increased 53% to £535,000 
(2006: £349,000) as a result of the increase in 
the group’s cash holdings and interest relating 
to loans made to the group’s portfolio companies. 
Interest payable of £195,000 (2006: £102,000) 
relates to interest accrued on the loan notes 
used to purchase the group’s shareholding 
in portfolio companies acquired as part of the 
Shefﬁeld and Cardiff agreements. These amounts 
are only payable in the event of an exit, and are 
not considered to be a current liability.
During the year investments on the balance 
sheet increased to £4.5m (2006: £3.4m). 
The increase in the year was made up of both 
equity investments and convertible loan investments, 
plus accrued interest, in a number of our portfolio 
companies. The principal increase was the £1.4m 
acquisition of the interests in seven companies 
associated with the Cardiff agreement.
Amounts falling due greater than one year rose 
to £3.3m (2006: £2.0m). The increase is the net 
impact of loan notes of £1.4m issued as part of 
the Cardiff agreement from the acquisition of the 
seven companies plus accrued interest arising in 
the year and a £0.4m repayment of a loan note to 
the University of Shefﬁeld following the disposal 
of the holding in Plasso Technology Limited.
Net cash outﬂow before ﬁnancing was consistent 
with the prior year at £2.3m. Fund raising net of 
share issue costs raised £7.0m leaving a closing 
cash balance of £10.6m (2006: £5.9m) which is 
sufﬁcient to support the current portfolio of 
companies, planned creation of new portfolio 
companies and central overheads beyond the 
next twelve months.
FUNDRAISING
The key fundraising event of the year was 
a placing of 5.3m shares at a share price 
of £1.45 which raised £7.8m. The costs of 
this fund raising were £0.8m, all of which 
were taken to the share premium account, 
leaving net funds raised of £7.0m.
As part of the consideration for the Cardiff 
agreement 11.0m shares were issued at a price 
of £1.45 giving a total value of £15.9m. Following 
the completion of this agreement Cardiff University 
owns 30% of the issued share capital of the 
company. The University of Shefﬁeld now owns 
25%, management own 11% and institutional 
investors, the remaining 34%.
POST YEAR END
Trading has continued in line with expectations 
since the year end.

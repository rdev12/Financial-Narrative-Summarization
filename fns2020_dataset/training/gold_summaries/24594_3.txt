 Chairman’s statement
We are using the proceeds of our IPO to pursue our proven strategy. 
Our increased scale enhances our ability to grow, both organically 
and through our successful, acquisition-led model.
Strategy
This is my first full year statement 
following our listing on AIM in March 
2016. I am delighted to report on a 
year of achievements for the Group, 
not least of which was the IPO.  
We are using the net proceeds of this 
judiciously to build shareholder value 
by furthering our clear, consistent  
and well-managed strategy namely  
to grow our business by acquiring 
likeminded firms, integrate them 
successfully and provide innovative 
investment solutions for clients. 
Network Direct Limited (NDL) is a 
good example of this and with c.100 
advisers is a larger acquisition than  
we would have been able to make 
historically. We have received consent 
from the FCA to acquire NDL and 
anticipate the acquisition will be 
complete by March 2017.
We have also enjoyed organic growth. 
Our registered individuals are not only 
growing in number, but their per 
capita production is increasing as a 
result of organic opportunities that 
have presented themselves in the 
market, notably pension freedoms 
legislation. This has been a great boost 
to the advisory industry as larger 
numbers of investors are considering 
their retirement more seriously, both  
in terms of asset accumulation and 
also taking advice close to the point  
of decumulation.
We believe that our rigorous, vertically 
integrated process, coupled with our 
high quality investment management, 
delivers good quality client outcomes 
in an efficient manner. Prospective 
vendors feel confident selling to us, 
because they know their clients will  
be treated fairly.
The confidence we have seen  
from shareholders and the market 
underlines our view that our model – 
and sticking to our model – works, 
which is in line with what we told the 
market at the time of the IPO. We are 
excited to be taking the business to 
the next stage of its development.
Performance
2016 was a successful year for the 
Group. We added 17 acquisitions,  
and delivered an adjusted EBITDA of 
£2.7 million (2015: £1.9 million). Assets 
under influence (“AUI”) increased to 
£2.1bn (2015: £1.2bn) and we estimate 
that about two thirds of this increase 
is attributable to acquisitions and one 
third is from organic growth. The net 
cash generated by operating activities 
was £2.4m (2015: £1.8m) closely 
matching EBITDA. 
Performance has been delivered 
against a favourable market backdrop. 
Post the Retail Distribution Review 
(RDR) we see a continued appetite for 
small and medium sized enterprises in 
the financial services sector to seek 
buyers – and if anything, we have  
seen an acceleration in the interest  
of people wishing to sell. We have 
stuck rigidly to our model, with the 
businesses we choose not to acquire 
almost as notable as those that we do!
In addition to the higher demand  
for advisory services from pension 
reforms mentioned above, the market 
itself has been very buoyant. The 
quality of our investment processes 
has delivered good performance 
through uncertain times.

Chairman
We believe that 
our simple, clear 
strategy, combined 
with the proven 
capabilities of the 
Company, will 
enable Harwood 
Wealth Management 
Group to continue to 
deliver value to our 
stakeholders in the 
current year  
and beyond.

Our team has worked hard to deliver 
this robust financial performance, 
which is very much underpinned  
by our strong corporate culture  
and commitment to great client 
outcomes. Testament to the quality  
of the management team is that they 
were not distracted by the IPO process,  
with the financial results through  
that period largely uninterrupted.  
On your behalf and that of the Board,  
I wish to formally record our thanks.
Board changes
The Board was strengthened at  
IPO by the appointment of two new 
Non-executive Directors, Christopher 
Mills and Paul Tuson, both of whom 
bring a wealth of relevant experience. 
Nick Bravery was also appointed to  
the role of Chief Financial Officer in 
October 2016. The strength of our 
Board has been praised by the market 
as one of the most experienced and 
industry recognised in our arena. This 
is particularly notable for a business  
of our size.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 2.00 pence per share 
subject to shareholder approval at  
the Company Annual General meeting 
on 19 April 2017. The final dividend will 
be paid on 12 May 2017 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business 
on 28 April 2017.
Outlook
We believe that our simple, clear 
strategy, combined with the proven 
capabilities of the Company, will enable 
Harwood Wealth Management Group 
to continue to deliver value to our 
stakeholders in the current year  
and beyond. The value from recent 
acquisitions will contribute to our 
results in our 2017 financial year,  
and we will continue to seek to add 
further client books to our stable. As 
for external factors, we await greater 
clarity on Brexit and its implications  
for the regulatory imperatives the 
financial services sector will face  
but are confident that whatever the 
outcomes our clients will still require 
good quality financial advice.
We go into the year with a good 
degree of confidence, a very sound 
business, and look forward to 
capitalising on further opportunities  
for growth.

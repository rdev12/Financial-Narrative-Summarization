Five-year summary
The five year financial summary below includes selected information on a calendar year basis, which has been subject to audit except for the years 
ended 31 December 2001 and 2002. Information relating to 2001 and 2002 is on an unaudited proforma basis for Logica and CMG, which merged 
on 30 December 2002.
The amounts disclosed for the year ended 31 December 2003 and earlier periods are presented under UK generally accepted accounting principles 
(‘UK GAAP’) because it is not practicable to restate amounts for prior periods to the group’s date of transition to International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRS’) on 1 January 2004. The principal differences between UK GAAP and IFRS for LogicaCMG are explained in note 38 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

1
Under UK GAAP , the results of the discontinued operation are presented as a component of each line item in the profit and loss account. Under IFRS, the post-tax loss of the discontinued operation is shown as a single
line item entitled ‘Loss from discontinued operation’. Revenue from the discontinued operation in 2003 was £11.5 million (2002: £12.3 million, 2001: £12.2 million).
2
Under UK GAAP , the adjusted operating margin is from continuing operations before goodwill amortisation, restructuring and other exceptional items. Under IFRS, the adjusted operating margin is from continuing
operations and before exceptional items and amortisation of those intangible assets initially recognised at fair value in a business combination. In 2005, adjusted operating profit was £121.7 million, which was before
amortisation of £1.0 million (2004: £nil) relating to excluded intangible assets.
3
Earnings per share and dividends per share have been restated for the bonus element of the rights issue that took place in November 2005.
4
Adjusted basic earnings per share under UK GAAP represents basic earnings per share from continuing operations before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. Adjusted basic earnings per share under IFRS is
defined in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
5
Dividends per share are presented according to the financial year to which they relate rather than the basis of recognition for accounting purposes. Dividends prior to the year ended 31 December 2003 are not presented
because, due to the merger of Logica and CMG and the two group’s differing financial year ends, it is not possible to present dividends per share for the combined LogicaCMG group.

RESULTS
I am very pleased to be able to report another good set of results for Bunzl 
despite the continuing difﬁcult macroeconomic conditions which have 
persisted for the last few years across many of the international markets 
in which we compete. 
Group revenue increased to £5,359.2 million (2011: £5,109.5 million), an 
increase of 6% at constant exchange rates, due to organic growth of 2.6% 
combined with the impact of recent acquisitions, net of the disposal of the 
UK vending business in August 2011.
Operating proﬁt before intangible amortisation and acquisition related 
costs was £352.4 million (2011: £335.7 million), up 7% at constant 
exchange rates, with the improvement in the Group operating margin on 
the same basis being driven by the impact of acquisitions and the sale of 
the UK vending business. Adjusted earnings per share before intangible 
amortisation, acquisition related costs and the vending disposal were 
71.8p (2011: 68.5p), an increase of 7% at constant exchange rates. 
Adverse currency translation movements, principally the euro, reduced 
the growth rates marginally by between 1% and 2%.
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 19.4p. This brings the total 
dividend for the year to 28.2p, up 7% compared to 2011. Shareholders 
will again have the opportunity to participate in our dividend reinvestment 
plan.
STRATEGY
We continue to pursue our proven strategy of developing the business 
through organic growth, consolidating the markets in which we compete 
through focused acquisitions in both existing and new geographies and 
continuously improving the efﬁciency of our operations. 
We achieve our organic growth by applying our resources and expertise 
to enable customers to outsource to Bunzl the purchasing, consolidation 
and distribution of a broad range of goods not for resale. By doing so our 
customers are able to focus on their core business more cost effectively 
by achieving purchasing efﬁciencies and savings, freeing up working 
capital, improving their distribution capabilities and simplifying their 
internal administration. 
Acquisition activity increased signiﬁcantly in 2012, particularly towards  
the end of the year, with 13 acquisitions announced and a total investment 
of approximately £270 million adding annualised revenue of over £500 
million. A key highlight this year was our ﬁrst acquisition in South America 
outside Brazil which has provided Bunzl with a ﬁrst entry into four new 
countries in the region. Having pursued our strategy consistently over 
many years, we have built leading positions in a variety of market sectors 
across the Americas, Europe and Australasia.

INVESTMENT
While Bunzl does not have high levels of capital expenditure for a 
company of its size, both organic growth and acquisitions require 
investment in the business to expand and enhance its asset base. 
Our IT systems and warehouse facilities are critical to our ability to serve 
our customers in the most efﬁcient and appropriate manner. We have 
therefore continued to invest in order to support our growth strategy and 
ensure that we retain our competitive advantage. By doing so we maintain 
our leadership in the marketplace, as we integrate new businesses into 
the Group and look to improve our existing infrastructure.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Efﬁcient and ethical management of our business and long term 
relationships with all our stakeholders, whether customers, employees 
or suppliers, remain key to our sustained business success. During 2012 
our managers and sales and procurement staff completed tailored training 
covering our Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) policies which included our 
Business Standards/Code of Ethics and our stance on gifts and 
entertainment, facilitation payments and information on our whistle 
blowing process. Our employee survey again provided useful feedback 
and resulted in a variety of actions. We have also continued to assist our 
customers in meeting their CR objectives by providing them with product 
choices, including some innovative environmentally friendly products 
made from materials such as bamboo and sugar cane as well as, in some 
cases, offering them a closed loop recycling facility. Our Quality Assurance 
and Quality Control department based in Shanghai continues to work with 
our Asian suppliers to ensure that high quality and ethical standards of 
operation are maintained. 
EMPLOYEES
Our employees’ experience, dedication, commitment and approach to 
their work remain key strengths of Bunzl. Across the world we depend 
on them to continue to provide high quality care to our customers, adding 
value to our service provision. The relationships formed by our employees 
with all our stakeholders shape the reputation of Bunzl and build our 
culture of a positive ‘can-do’ company. As ever, we are genuinely grateful 
for the loyalty and hard work of all our employees and we are delighted 
that 2012 has been a year in which many new employees have joined  
the Group through acquisition, providing new ideas and challenges to 
continue the development of Bunzl internationally. 
CREDIT FACILITIES
The Group remains highly cash generative and we continue to have 
access to diverse sources of funding to achieve our strategic objectives. 
In October 2012 we reﬁnanced some of our debt facilities by raising 
US$350.0 million of ﬁxed interest rate borrowings in the US private 
placement market with maturities ranging from seven to 11 years at an 
average interest rate of 3.4%. US$110.0 million was drawn in December 
with the balance due to be drawn in April 2013. During the year we also 
reﬁnanced or agreed new banking facilities totalling £150.7 million. Our 
undrawn committed facilities at the end of the year were £589.3 million. 
BOARD
Ulrich Wolters, who has served as a non-executive director since 2004, 
will be retiring after the Company’s Annual General Meeting in April 2013. 
We thank Ulrich for his signiﬁcant contribution over many years and he 
will leave the Board with our gratitude and best wishes for the future.
Jean-Charles Pauze was appointed as a non-executive director in January 
2013 and Meinie Oldersma will join the Board in the same capacity in 
April. Based in Paris, Jean-Charles is presently Chairman of Europcar and 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board of CFAO Group and was Chairman 
and Chief Executive of Rexel for 10 years until 2012. Prior to that he held 
a number of senior positions with PPR Group, Strafor Facom Group and 
Alfa Laval Group in France and Germany. A Dutch national, Meinie is 
currently based in the UK and has been Chief Executive of 20:20 Mobile 
Group since 2008 and previously held a variety of senior positions with 
Ingram Micro, most recently as Chief Executive and President of their 
China Group and Managing Director of their business in Northern Europe. 
Both Jean-Charles and Meinie have extensive international experience 
across a range of distribution and service sectors, particularly in Europe 
and Asia, which will be of great value to Bunzl as we continue to expand 
and develop. I am delighted to welcome them to the Board.

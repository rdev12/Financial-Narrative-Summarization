Whitbread
Whitbread has built some of the  
UKâ€™s most successful hospitality 
brands including Premier Inn and 
Costa. We employ over 43,000  
people in the UK and serve  
22 million customers every month. 
Our strategy is to grow  our  
leading brands with a clear focus  
on returns to deliver substantial 
shareholder value.
Hotels & Restaurants
Premier Inn is the UKâ€™s leading hotel 
business, with over 670 hotels and more 
than 55,000 rooms across the UK. 
We have more rooms in more locations than our competitors, 
which allows our customers to stay closer to where they  
want to be.
We offer our customers a 100% moneyâ€“back guarantee  
of a good nightâ€™s sleep with a quality room, comfortable 
surroundings and friendly service. We call it our Good  
Night Guarantee.
All Premier Inn UK bedrooms have an ensuite bathroom,  
TV with Freeview and Wiâ€“Fi internet access. All our hotels  
have a bar and restaurant, either inside the building or next  
to it, offering a wide range of dishes. Whitbreadâ€™s unique  
joint site model means that 377 of these hotels are located 
alongside our own restaurant brands: Beefeater; Brewers  
Fayre; Table Table; and Taybarns. A further 149 hotels  
include one of our Thyme restaurants.
Internationally, we have five hotels in the Middle East and  
three in India with more in the pipeline.

Weâ€™ve set our sights on ambitious and fastâ€“paced profitable 
growth and last year announced new growth milestones.  
By 2018 we plan to increase the size of Premier Inn to around 
75,000 UK rooms and the system sales of Costa to around  
Â£2 billion. 
Our businesses share common values and a clear vision  
on responsibility. We have demonstrated our ability to  
build strong brands through the consistent delivery of 
operational excellence and a great customer experience  
in peopleâ€“intensive businesses.
Listed on the London Stock Exchange, Whitbread PLC  
is a member of the FTSE 100 and the FTSE4Good indices.

Costa
Costa, voted the UKâ€™s favourite coffee 
shop, has grown significantly over  
the past five years and now has 1,755  
coffee shops in the UK and 1,106 
overseas. 
Only 1% of the worldâ€™s coffee beans are good enough  
to create the unique taste and aroma of our Costa Mocha 
Italia blend. Almost all the coffee we serve in the UK,  
and most of that served in the rest of the world, is roasted  
at our Lambeth roastery.
Costa is an international brand represented in 30 countries.  
It has a multiâ€“channel strategy, with equity stores, franchise 
stores and stores operated by joint ventures, as well as a 
wholesale operation. Costa Express now has over 3,500 
selfâ€“service machines.

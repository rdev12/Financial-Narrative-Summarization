Notes
1.  A member en � tled to a � end and vote at the above mee � ng is en � tled to appoint a proxy to a � end and to speak and vote instead of him/her. A 
proxy need not be a member of the Company. A member may appoint more than one proxy in rela � on to a mee � ng, provided that each proxy is 
appointed to exercise the rights a � ached to a di ﬀ erent share or shares held by that member.
2.  A proxy form which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy direc � ons accompanies this no � ce. If you do not receive a proxy 
form and believe that you should have received one, or if you require addi � onal proxy forms in order to appoint more than one proxy, please 
contact Equini �  on the telephone number(s) given in note 16 below.
3.  To be valid, a form of proxy and, if applicable, any power of a � orney or other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially cer �  ed copy of 
such power or authority, must be received by Equini � , Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA by 9:00 a.m. on Monday 
11 July 2016.
4.  Members returning a form of proxy or a CREST Proxy Instruc � on (as described in paragraph 15 below) will also be able to a � end the mee � ng 
and vote in person should they wish to do so. If a member has appointed a proxy and a � ends the Annual General Mee � ng in person, the proxy 
appointment will automa � cally be terminated.
5.  Any person to whom this no � ce is sent who is a person nominated under sec � on 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy informa � on rights 
(a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him or her and the member by whom he or she was nominated, have a right 
to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Mee � ng. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy 
appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he or she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instruc � ons to the member as 
to the exercise of vo � ng rights.
6.  The statement of the rights of members in rela � on to the appointment of proxies in notes 1, 2 and 3 above does not apply to Nominated 
Persons. The rights described in those notes can only be exercised by members of the Company.
7.  For the purposes of determining who is en � tled to a � end and vote (whether on a poll or otherwise) at the mee � ng, a person must be entered 
on the register of members by 6.00 p.m. on 11 July 2016 (or, in the event of any adjournment, by 6:00 p.m. on the date which is two days before 
the date of the adjourned mee � ng) and shall be able to vote only on those Ordinary Shares registered in that person’s name at that � me. 
Any changes to entries made a � er the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to a � end or vote at the 
mee � ng.
8.  As at 13 May 2016, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 218,382,156 Ordinary Shares (excluding treasury shares). Each Ordinary Share 
carries the right to vote on a poll at a general mee � ng of the Company and, therefore, the total vo � ng rights in the Company as at that date 
were 218,382,156. As at 13 May 2016, the Company held 1,851,091 Ordinary Shares as treasury shares.
9 .  A ny c o r p o r a � on which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representa � ves who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a 
member, provided that they do not do so in rela � on to the same shares.
1 0 .  Un d e r s e c � on 527 of the Companies Act 2006, members mee � ng the threshold requirements set out in that sec � on have the right to require 
the Company to publish on a website a statement se �  ng out any ma � er rela � ng to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the 
auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Mee � ng; or (ii) any circumstance connected with 
an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold o ﬃ  ce since the previous mee � ng at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance 
with sec � on 437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the members reques � ng any such website publica � on to pay its 
expenses in complying with sec � ons 527 or 528 Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under 
sec � on 527 Companies Act 2006, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor no later than the � me when it makes the statement 
available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Mee � ng includes any statement that the Company has 
been required under sec � on 527 Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
11.  A copy of this no � ce, and other informa � on required by sec � on 311A Companies Act 2006, can be found on the Company’s website at www.e2v.com.
12.  Any member a � ending the mee � ng has the right to ask ques � ons. The Company must cause to be answered any such ques � on rela � ng to the 
business being dealt with at the mee � ng but no such answer need be given if (i) to do so would interfere unduly with the prepara � on for the 
mee � ng or involve the disclosure of con  den � al informa � on, (ii) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a 
ques � on, or (iii) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the mee � ng that the ques � on be answered.
13.  There will be available for inspec � on at the Company’s registered o ﬃ  ce (106 Waterhouse Lane, Chelmsford, Essex, CM1 2QU) during normal

No � ce of Annual General Mee � ng (AGM) (con � nued)
  In order for a CREST proxy appointment or instruc � on made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy 
Instruc � on”) must be properly authen � cated in compliance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s speci  ca � ons and must contain the necessary 
informa � on, as described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com). The message, regardless of whether it cons � tutes the 
appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruc � on given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmi � ed 
so as to be received by Equini �  (ID RA19) no later than 9:00 a.m. on Monday 11 July 2016. For this purpose, the � me of receipt will be taken to 
be the � me (as determined by the � mestamp applied to the message by CREST Applica � ons Host) from which Equini �  is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner required by CREST. A � er that � me any change of instruc � ons to proxies appointed through CREST 
should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or vo � ng service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does 
not make available special procedures in CREST for any par � cular messages. Normal system � mings and limita � ons will, therefore, apply in 
rela � on to the input of CREST Proxy Instruc � ons. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a 
CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a vo � ng service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or vo � ng service 
provider(s) take(s)) such ac � on as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmi � ed by means of the CREST system by any par � cular 
� me. In this connec � on, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or vo � ng service providers are referred, in par � cular, to 
those sec � ons of the CREST Manual concerning prac � cal limita � ons of the CREST system and � mings.
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruc � on in the circumstances set out in Regula � on 35(5)(a) Uncer �  cated Securi � es 
Regula � ons 2001.
16.  If you have any ques � ons rela � ng to this no � ce of Annual General Mee � ng or the comple � on and return of the form of proxy, you can 
contact Equini � ’s helpline on 0371 384 2689. Lines are open 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday to Friday. Callers from outside the UK should dial 
+44 (0)121 415 7047.
17.   Under sec � on 338 and sec � on 338A of the Act, members mee � ng the threshold requirements in those sec � ons have the right to require 
the Company (i) to give, to members of the Company en � tled to receive no � ce of the mee � ng, no � ce of a resolu � on which may properly be 
moved and is intended to be moved at the mee � ng and / or (ii) to include in the business to be dealt with at the mee � ng any ma � er (other 
than a proposed resolu � on) which may be properly included in the business. A resolu � on may properly be moved, or a ma � er may properly be 
included in the business, unless (a) (in the case of a resolu � on only) it would, if passed, be ine ﬀ ec � ve (whether by reason of inconsistency with 
any enactment or the Company’s cons � tu � on or otherwise), (b) it is defamatory of any person or (c) it is frivolous or vexa � ous, Such a request 
may be in hard copy or in electronic form, must iden � fy the resolu � on of which no � ce is to be given or the ma � er to be included in the business, 
must be authorised by the person or persons making it, must be received by the Company not later than 1 June 2016, being the date 6 clear 
weeks before the mee � ng, and (in the case of a ma � er to be included in the business only) must be accompanied by a statement se �  ng out the 
grounds for the request.

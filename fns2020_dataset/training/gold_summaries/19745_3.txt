 Keeping  
your wooden  
floor looking good
Using natural materials such as wood 
and stone in our homes continues to 
be a strong trend. As a result, there is 
an increasing demand to ensure the 
products are protected against wear 
and tear. 
Our latest water-borne, environmentally 
friendly binders for speciality wood 
coatings offer excellent scratch 
resistance and protection against 
the daily challenges of normal life. Improved

for logistic providers. Synthomer’s low 
noise tape adhesive is used to coat 
packaging tapes. It is environmentally 
friendly, provides a good bonding 
strength and low noise.

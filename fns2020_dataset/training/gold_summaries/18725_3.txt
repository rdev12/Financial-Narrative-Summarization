CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
We have completed a thorough review 
of all of our businesses during 2015 and 
have undertaken a number of appropriate 
actions. The Group ended 2015 in far better 
operational shape than it began the year.
Derek Mapp Chairman
STRONG LEADERSHIP
2015 was my first full year as Chairman 
of the Board of Huntsworth, a year 
that saw significant change with new 
leadership and a full strategic review.
I believe that we now have an Executive 
team with the balance of skills and 
qualities to take the Group forward. 
As noted in my report last year, Paul 
Taaffe joined the Group in April 2015 to 
succeed the retiring Lord Chadlington. 
The appointment of Neil Jones as 
the Group’s CFO, with effect from 
1 February 2016, was also announced 
in 2015. Neil, who joined us from ITE 
Group plc, brings a wealth of experience, 
and his financial and commercial 
expertise will be extremely valuable as 
we implement our strategy. We have 
also welcomed Pat Billingham to the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director.
We have completed a thorough review 
of all of our businesses during 2015 
and have undertaken a number of 
appropriate actions. The Group ended 
2015 in far better operational shape 
than it began the year. I am delighted 
that Huntsworth Health has continued 
its record of delivering strong growth, 
and is now the largest division in the 
Group by both revenues and profits. 
Red has also returned to revenue growth 
and has good momentum moving into 
2016. Citigate has performed strongly 
in some regions but needs to return to 
growth in others during the coming year.  Strategic

We have also implemented a number 
of cost reduction initiatives, particularly 
in Grayling, and we are confident that 
the work we have undertaken has 
positioned this division to return to 
growth. Grayling has been successful 
in securing some large contracts, 
especially in Africa and the Middle East.
The Executive leadership, the Board 
and its Committees are now at full 
strength. The key operational objective 
of 2016 is returning the Group to 
sustainable revenue and profit growth. 
A lot of hard work has gone into 
establishing a strong base for 
fulfilling this, and we begin 2016 
with cause for optimism.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank the management team and 
staff for their hard work in getting to 
this stage. I look forward to reporting 
on our progress in delivering these 
improvements during 2016.
“ THE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP, THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES 
ARE NOW AT FULL STRENGTH. THE KEY OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVE 
OF 2016 IS RETURNING THE GROUP TO SUSTAINABLE REVENUE 
AND PROFIT GROWTH.”

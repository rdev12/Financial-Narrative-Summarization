Overview
Our strategic priorities 
The Group’s long-term strategy, to 
enhance its market-leading position 
across its chosen markets and use the 
cash generated from its construction 
activities to invest in and grow its 
regeneration activities, remains 
unchanged.
Our performance in 2014
Confidence in the strategy has been 
reinforced by a strong performance  
from Urban Regeneration in 201 4.
Looking forward
The Group will continue to be managed  
in line with its strategic priorities and  
to deploy its capital structure and 
management expertise to generate 
sustainable returns without taking  
undue risks. 
Target markets  
that offer the best  
potential for growth 
Significant appointments have been secured 
in the Group’s key markets of social housing, 
education, transport and commercial.
Further investment in regeneration 
opportunities supported by improvement in 
the Group’s order book provides confidence 
that the Group is well positioned to deliver 
future growth.
Maximise returns by  
focusing on relationships  
with key customers 
New work has been secured on existing 
long-term frameworks and appointments 
secured on significant new frameworks.
The Group is committed to developing 
long-term relationships, creating strategic 
partnerships and securing positions on  
major frameworks.
Utilise the Group’s  
complementary range  
of skills to provide  
an integrated offering
Sister divisions have collaborated on 
long-term, complex schemes around the 
UK involving investment, development and 
construction, for example the Towcester 
regeneration scheme (see page 21 ). 
Investments continues its strategy to unlock 
prime long-term construction opportunities 
for sister divisions.
Use the cash generated  
through construction  
activity to invest  
in regeneration 
Urban Regeneration has performed strongly, 
with a significant increase in operating profit 
and 1 3% growth in its regeneration and 
development pipeline. 
Firm financial discipline will be applied  
to overheads, cash and working capital  
to ensure the Group has sufficient cash  
to invest from its construction activities  
into quality regeneration opportunities.

Business model 
The Group’s business model comprises  
five distinct but complementary drivers  
of growth that help the Group to deliver  
its strategy.
201 4 key performance  
indicators (‘KPIs’)
The Group uses financial and non-financial 
KPIs to measure its progress in delivering  
its strategy priorities.
Risk awareness 
The Group has a long established culture  
of mature risk and control processes  
to manage both material and day-to-day 
circumstances.
People
• Highest standards maintained in health  
and safety 
• Morgan Sindall Group People Promise 
(‘People Promise’) launched to position  
the Group as employer of choice.
Accident Incident Rate
306
Number of graduates recruited
67
Average number of training  
days per employee 
2.2 days
The Group’s performance and business 
conduct affects employees, subcontractors 
and the public and in turn can affect its 
reputation and commercial performance.
Winning in our markets
• Close collaboration with clients and partners
• Driving continuous improvement through 
Perfect Delivery 
• Targeting markets with highest 
opportunities for growth.
Regeneration and development pipeline
£3.2bn
Perfect delivery
81% 
Committed order book
£2.7bn
The Group undertakes several hundred 
contracts each year and needs to ensure  
that contractual terms relate to the risks 
arising from the nature and complexity  
of the works.
Maximising efficiency
• Long-term relationships with trusted 
suppliers and subcontractors
• Optimising business processes and  
support functions
• Reducing energy consumption and  
carbon emissions.
Gross margin 
8.2%
Overhead as a proportion of revenue
7 .2%
Carbon intensity (Scopes 1, 2 and 3)
16.95
If employees are not properly engaged with 
the culture of the business, clients are less 
likely to receive exceptional levels of service.
Disciplined use of capital
• Rigorous cash management
• Long-term joint ventures and  
strategic alliances
• Forward selling schemes with leading 
financial institutions.
Working capital as a proportion  
of revenue
(2.5%)
Adjusted operating cash flow  
as a percentage of adjusted  
operating profit*
8%
Without sufficient liquidity, the Group’s ability 
to meet its liabilities as they fall due would  
be compromised which could ultimately lead 
to its failure to operate as a going concern.
Pursuing innovation
• Empowering employees to think differently
• Identifying innovative routes to market
• Pioneering commercial structuring and 
funding solutions
• Creating new design and construction 
techniques.
Group revenue generated from 
Investments funding solutions
£68.4m
If the Group fails to encourage an innovative 
approach across its divisions it could lose  
its competitive edge and suffer reputational 
damage.

02 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Global audience 
creation and 
monetisation
With the latest digital acquisition 
methods, we concentrate on delivering 
a lower cost per acquisition by leveraging 
the mass appeal of branded content 
coupled with CRM specific to the 
individual user. This has expanded our 
audience well beyond the traditional 
gaming market gaining particular 
traction with both a younger and 
more female demographic.
Advanced mobile 
gaming platform
We have invested significantly in our 
mobile based gambling and social 
platforms powered by algorithmic 
CRM and personalised content. Our real 
money gambling business is operated 
from Guernsey and fully licensed by 
the UK Gambling Commission for both 
development and operation.

 02 Persimmon Plc Annual Report 2005 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
2005 was another record year for Persimmon, with net pre-tax
profits of £495.4 million (2004: £468.0 million). Basic earnings
per share increased to 118.4p (2004: 113.5p).
These figures are the first full year results which have
been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), which were effective at 
31 December 2005.
When we published our restatement of financial 
information for 2004 under IFRSs on 24 May 2005 we
demonstrated that the transition from UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (“UK GAAP”) did not have 
a material effect on our financial results. This remains the 
case for 2005; for example, profit before tax and goodwill
amortisation on a UK GAAP basis for 2005 was 
£499.5 million (2004: £470.4 million).
The year was hugely significant for the Group, with the
announcement in November 2005 of our £643 million
successful offer for Westbury plc. This acquisition was
completed on 17 January 2006. Since then we have been
implementing our integration plans for that business.
I am pleased to report that this process has proceeded
extremely well and the initial stages of integration have been
completed to plan. The acquisition is an ideal fit for
Persimmon with an excellent geographic overlap which creates
an enlarged business building c. 16,700 homes per annum.
We also purchased the net assets of Senator Homes, a small
business in Cumbria, for £25 million (including borrowings) 
on 13 December 2005. This has enlarged our Lancashire
operation and has already been fully integrated into Persimmon.
As a result of the progress the Group has made, Persimmon
entered the FTSE 100 in December, being the first pure
housebuilder ever to do so.
In 2005 we completed the sale of 12,636 (2004: 12,360) 
homes at an average selling price of £180,892 (2004: £172,431)
an increase of 5%, giving a turnover of £2.29 billion 
(2004: £2.13 billion). Despite more challenging conditions
throughout 2005, we were able to maintain operating 
margins at similar levels to the prior year at 23.1% 
(2004: 23.4%). We increased operating profits to 
£527.8 million (2004: £498.0 million).

Turning to our cash position, net borrowings at 31 December
2005 were £266 million, giving gearing of 16%. This was 
after paying £25 million for Senator Homes, and £169 million
for the 26.1% of Westbury plc which we bought in the
stockmarket on 24 November 2005, the day of the
announcement of the recommended offer.
In my Interim Statement on 23 August 2005 we committed 
to pay total dividends for 2005 of not less than 30.4 pence 
per share (2004: 27.5 pence). We are in fact now proposing
total dividends for 2005 of 31 pence per share, representing an
increase of 12.7% over dividends paid in 2004. We paid an
interim dividend of 12 pence per share in October 2005,
and will recommend a final dividend of 19 pence per share,
which will be payable on 21 April 2006 to shareholders on 
the Register on 10 March 2006. As before, we are offering a
scrip dividend alternative.
We continued to be very selective about our land purchases
throughout the year. Our landbank of consented plots owned
and under control at the year end was 63,336 plots. Since the
acquisition of Westbury this has increased to c. 78,000 plots
providing a land supply of over 4
1
/ 2 years. This length of
landbank is essential for a business of our scale given the
continuing difficulties and challenges to be addressed in
achieving satisfactory detailed planning consents throughout
the UK.
We have seen a good start to 2006 with good forward sales 
in most areas. On 26 February our total sales to date for 
the current year are over 7,000 units at c. £1.25 billion sales
revenue. This includes an initial contribution from Westbury.
Current visitor levels to our developments across the UK 
are encouraging.
On 20 April 2006 John Millar, Sir Chips Keswick and myself
will all retire from the Board. I am honoured to have been
invited to become Life President of Persimmon. I would like to
thank John and Chips very sincerely for the incredible
contribution which they have both made to Persimmon’s
success over the last 20 years.
As announced last year, John White will take over my 
position as Group Chairman, and Mike Farley will become
Chief Executive. Both John and Mike have been exceedingly
successful in their long careers with Persimmon. I know that
they will both continue that success in their new roles.
I am also delighted to welcome to the Board of Persimmon
Adam Applegarth, Chief Executive of Northern Rock plc, and
Nicholas Wrigley, a Managing Director of N.M. Rothschild,
as non-executive Directors. The wealth of experience which
they both have will bring added strength to our Board for 
the future.
I am proud to have led Persimmon for 34 years, and our
success over all those years has been achieved by the fantastic
efforts of every member of our Staff at all levels. In the period
since April 1985, when Persimmon became a listed company,
we have built c. 120,000 homes. During this time we have
achieved growth in total shareholder return of over 25% on a
compound annual basis and have increased the Group’s market
capitalisation from £14 million to over £4 billion. I know that
the growth and success of Persimmon will continue unabated,
thanks to their efforts. I thank them all and wish every one of
them all the very best for the future.

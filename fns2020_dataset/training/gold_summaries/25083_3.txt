Keith Falconer
Chairman
Over the past 12 months, the prospects 
for equity investors have remained 
uncertain as growth in the global 
economy has been elusive and problems 
in the Eurozone intractable. In spite of 
these headwinds, Impax has delivered  
a robust performance and has continued 
to invest in order to position the business 
for further growth.
During the Company’s ﬁnancial year from 
1 October 2011 to 30 September 2012 
(the “Period”), assets under discretionary 
and advisory management (“AUM”) 
initially rose from £1.90 billion to £2.03 
billion at the end of the ﬁrst half, before 
falling back to £1.83 billion. Since the  
end of the Period, equity markets have 
weakened further and AUM declined 
slightly, reaching £1.80 billion on  
31 October 2012.
Notwithstanding sustained equity market 
volatility, the drivers behind resource 
efﬁciency and environmental markets 
have once again strengthened, further 
underpinning the attractiveness of the 
investment areas in which Impax 
operates. For example, acute drought in 
the United States and the recent impact 
of Hurricane Sandy have raised the 
likelihood that a re-elected President 
Obama will promote additional investment 
in clean energy and water infrastructure, 
while across the planet there has been a 
notable increase in evidence pointing to 
faster than expected climate change, for 
example the steep decline in the summer 
coverage of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean 
compared to previous years. 
Institutional investors are increasingly 
interested in analysing the risks and 
opportunities arising from these changes, 
providing us with further opportunity for 
dialogue and, we believe, the potential for 
increased commitment of capital to our 
funds and accounts. Accordingly, we 
have continued to invest incrementally in 
our capabilities, particularly in the areas  
of client service in the United States  
and the development of investment 
management expertise across the food 
and agriculture sectors.
Results for the year and  
proposed dividend
Revenue to 30 September 2012 was 
£18.6 million (2011: £20.9 million). 
Operating earnings
1
 for the year were 
£4.6 million (2011: £6.2 million) and the 
associated operating margin was 24 per 
cent (2011: 30 per cent). The decrease in 
revenue and proﬁts compared to the 
corresponding 2011 ﬁnancial year reﬂect 
a combination of lower average AUM for 
the year and a moderately higher ﬁxed 
cost base arising from the investment we 
have made in further strengthening the 
Company’s platform to prepare for further 
growth. Proﬁt before tax (“PBT”) for the 
Period was a loss of £4.7 million (2011: 
proﬁt of £1.7 million). PBT was impacted 
by £8.7 million (2011: £5.4 million) of 
charges associated with the Company’s 
historical share-based incentive schemes. 
£1.0 million of this charge is directly offset 
by a corresponding tax gain. PBT also 
included fair value losses of £0.7 million 
arising primarily from the Company’s 
investments into the Impax Green 
Markets Fund which we have set up in 
the United States for domestic investors, 
and our ﬁrst private equity fund, in part 
due to the strengthening of Sterling 
against the Euro and the Dollar.
The Board regards the most relevant 
measure of the year’s earnings to be 
diluted earnings per share (“EPS”). On 
this basis diluted EPS for the year was 
2.57 pence (adjusted
2
), including  Impax Asset Management Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

For 2011, diluted EPS was 3.74 pence 
(adjusted
2
). Diluted EPS before adjustment 
was (4.32) pence in 2012 and 0.93 pence 
in 2011. 
The Group’s balance sheet strengthened 
during the year with continued cash 
generation from operating activities. At 
the end of the ﬁnancial year, shareholders’ 
equity had increased to £22.6 million 
(2011: £21.5 million) and cash reserves 
held by operating entities of the Group 
were £19.3 million (2011: £20.0 million). 
The slight decrease in cash included the 
impact of the Company’s US$5 million 
seed investment into the Impax Green 
Markets Fund. Current asset investments 
held at the year-end were £8.7 million 
(2011: £3.9 million). The Group remained 
debt-free throughout the Period.
In light of the Company’s sustained strong 
cash ﬂow and progressive dividend policy, 
the Board recommends an increased 
dividend of 0.75 pence per share (2011: 
0.70 pence per share). The dividend 
proposal will be submitted for formal 
approval by shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting  
on 13 February 2013. If approved,  
the dividend will be paid on or around  
20 February 2013. The record date for  
the payment of the proposed dividend will 
be 25 January 2013 and the ex-dividend 
date will be 23 January 2013. In line with 
the Company’s stated policy, the Board 
does not currently intend to recommend 
the payment of interim dividends.
Remuneration 
In accordance with the Company’s 
updated remuneration policy (which was 
described in the 2011 Annual Report), 
during the Period the Board conﬁrmed the 
grant of ﬁve million Employee Share Option 
Plan (“ESOP”) options to management  
and staff in respect of their performance 
for the ﬁnancial year ended 30 September 
2011. The strike price was set at 49.6 
pence and the options will vest on  
31 December 2014. 
Share Buy-backs and Share Issuance
During the Period the Board commenced 
the buy-back of the Company’s shares 
into Treasury, with the aim of reducing the 
requirement to issue new shares to 
satisfy the exercise of options awarded 
under the ESOP . To date, 3.5 million 
shares have been purchased since the 
start of the buy-back programme, and  
the Company expects further purchases 
to be made from time to time while 
continuing to evaluate attractive alternative 
uses of the Company’s cash resources. 
Separately, in accordance with the 
approval given by Shareholders in January 
2008, the Company plans shortly to issue 
12.2 million shares which will be available 
to satisfy exercises of vested option 
schemes, taking the total shares in issue 
to 127.7 million. 
Prospects
Since the end of the Period we have  
seen a clear outcome in the US elections 
and evidence of a smooth leadership 
transition in China, but on-going macro-
economic problems in the Eurozone. 
Against this complex backdrop, equity 
markets appear once again to be 
factoring in a signiﬁcant risk of 
disappointment in corporate earnings  
and outlook statements, and the potential 
for increased allocations to equities by 
institutional investors is unclear.
Nevertheless, as the case for active 
investment in resource efﬁciency and 
environmental markets becomes  
more compelling and better understood 
by investors, demand for specialist 
investment management expertise should 
continue to broaden and deepen. The 
Impax team has been successfully 
managing investment portfolios targeting 
these markets for more than 14 years  
and has a track record of planning for  
and delivering growth across a range  
of market circumstances. I am therefore 
conﬁdent that the Company is well 
positioned for further increase in 
shareholder value as conditions improve.

Proﬁt from operations, proﬁt before tax, attributable earnings, basic and diluted earnings per share are impacted, where applicable, by amortisation of acquired intangibles,
restructuring costs, certain fair value gains and losses on derivative ﬁnancial instruments, an exceptional gain on brand divestments, charges for one-off acquisition
accounting adjustments, retirement beneﬁt net ﬁnancing income and related taxation effects. Further detail of these items is included in the Financial Review.
Earnings per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average shares in issue of 846.5 million (2007: 775.5 million). Dividend per share has been determined 
using the current shares eligible for the ﬁnal dividend of 1,011.3 million (2007: 672.8 million), applying our policy of distributing around 50 per cent of adjusted 
attributable earnings.
Management believes that reporting adjusted measures provides a useful comparison of business performance and reﬂects the way in which the business is controlled.
Accordingly, as outlined in our accounting policy note, adjusted measures of proﬁt from operations, net ﬁnance costs, proﬁt before tax, attributable earnings, taxation and
earnings per share exclude, where applicable, amortisation of acquired intangibles, restructuring costs, retirement beneﬁts net ﬁnancing income, fair value gains and losses
on derivative ﬁnancial instruments in respect of commercially effective hedges, one-off acquisition accounting adjustments, brand divestment gains and related taxation
effects. Reconciliations between adjusted and reported proﬁt from operations are included within note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements, adjusted and reported ﬁnance costs in
note 5, adjusted and reported taxation in note 6, and adjusted and reported earnings per share in note 8. The adjusted measures in this report are not deﬁned terms under
International Financial Reporting Standards and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

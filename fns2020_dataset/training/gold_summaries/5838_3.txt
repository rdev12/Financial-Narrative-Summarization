 Faroe is a high impact explorer.  
We balance our frontier activities 
with near-field exploration. 
Overview
08 Faroe Petroleum plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Sustainable growth
We have managed our finances such that we  
are able to sustain what we consider to be one  
of the most active and attractive drilling programmes 
of any small cap independent oil company. 
Balanced portfolio
The Company continues to build a balanced  
portfolio of exploration, appraisal, development  
and production assets with significant emphasis 
on the delivery of a high impact exploration and 
appraisal drilling programme.
Mitigating risk
Pursuing a portfolio exploration business model 
mitigates exploration risk while the monetisation 
of discoveries mitigates financial risk – two key 
characteristics of Faroe’ s disciplined approach  
to value creation.

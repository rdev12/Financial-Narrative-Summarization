share, bringing the total cumulative

The charts on page 12 of these financial
statements show in greater detail the
movement in total return, net asset value
and dividends paid over time.
The investments held at 31 December
2015, amounting to £36.65 million, have
over the year increased by £1.04 million to
£37.69 million at 31 December 2016.  This
return comprises a gain over the opening
value from the realisation of investments
and deferred proceeds of £0.34 million,
and a gain on the revaluation of the
portfolio of £0.70 million.  There were
strong performances from ACC Aviation,
Business Collaborator Limited, GTK
(Holdco) Limited and Mangar Health
Limited, which in part were offset by the
poorer performances of Ness (Holdings)
Limited, Cambrian Lodges Holdings
Limited, Seven Technologies Holdings
Limited and Intamac Systems Limited.

Dividends
The Board remains committed to
achieving the objective of a consistent
dividend stream over time.  Dividends paid
in the year comprise a final dividend of 2.5
pence per ordinary share in respect of the
year ended 31 December 2015, and an
interim dividend of 2.0 pence per ordinary
share in respect of the financial year just
ended, totalling 4.5 pence per ordinary
share.  This brings the cumulative
dividends paid to 52.5 pence per ordinary
share. 
Following the modifications to the VCT
rules there has been a change in the
nature of  new investments with a
requirement to invest in earlier stage
businesses which generally require a
higher proportion of equity investment
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Total shareholder return for the year was
1.3 pence per ordinary share, which was
2.1 per cent of the net asset value at 31
December 2015 and your Company’s
portfolio generated a return of 1.5 pence
per ordinary share, which was  2.8 per
cent over its opening value.
The impact of the new VCT rules on the
investment rate over the past two years
has been quite marked.  Investments in
new unquoted trading companies totalled
£4.3 million in 2016 and £3.0 million in
2015, compared to £12.3 million in 2014,
the last year under the previous rules.
In light of this it is pleasing that there was
an increase in the investment rate
following HMRC’s issuance of its revised
guidance on the new VCT rules in May
2016, with 75 per cent of the year’s
investments being completed in the final
quarter of the year.  There remains a good
pipeline of potential investments which
your Board is looking to convert to add to
the portfolio during 2017. BRITISH SMALLER COMPANIES VCT2 PLC

than in the past. As the existing portfolio
matures it is anticipated that the resultant
future dividend stream and net asset value
could as a consequence become more
volatile than in the past.
With this in mind and to maintain a
sustainable level of future dividends the
Board is proposing a final dividend of 1.5
pence per share for the year ended 31
December 2016.  This final dividend is
subject to approval by the shareholders at
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting
and if approved will then be paid on 12
May 2017 to shareholders on the register
at 31 March 2017.  The ex-dividend date is
30 March 2017.
Dividend Re-investment Scheme
(“DRIS”)
Your Company operates a DRIS, which
gives shareholders the opportunity to re-
invest any cash dividends and is open to all
shareholders, including those who
invested under the recent offers.  For the
financial year ending 31 December 2016
dividends totalling £0.8 million were
invested in your Company by way of the
DRIS.
Fundraising
During the first half of the financial year
your Company raised net proceeds of £3.5
million through a ”top-up” offer.  Your
Company launched a further top-up
fundraising on 3 January 2017 and it is
pleasing that the offer closed in less than
a week.  The Company allotted 6,787,231
ordinary shares on 10 February 2017
raising net proceeds of £4.1 million and
following this allotment there were
100,761,545 ordinary shares in issue.
Shareholder relations
As part of the Board’s continuing dialogue
with shareholders, the 21st shareholder
workshop was held in conjunction with
British Smaller Companies VCT plc at the
British Library on 17 May 2016, with over
200 attendees. There were presentations
from the managing directors of two of our
newest investments, Ness (Holdings)
Limited and KeTech Enterprises Limited,
David Hall and David Bell from the
Investment Adviser, as well as Wyndham
North of HM Treasury.
Your Company’s electronic communications
policy, whereby documents such as the
annual report are disseminated via the
website www.bscfunds.com rather than by
post, has saved on printing costs as well as
being more environmentally friendly. I am
pleased to report that this policy continues
to be well received, with 84 per cent of
shareholders receiving communications in
this way.
The website www.bscfunds.com is
refreshed on a regular basis, with the
emphasis on providing a comprehensive
level of information in a user friendly
format.
The next Investor Workshop will take place
on 3 May 2017 and is being held at The
Grand Connaught Rooms, 61-65 Great
Queen Street, Covent Garden, London.

Stockbrokers
I am pleased to inform you that your Board
has appointed Panmure Gordon (UK)
Limited as corporate broker with effect

Gordon team has a wealth of experience

forward to working with them in the
future.  The Board would like to thank
Nplus1 Singer for the work they have done
as the Company’s broker over many years.
Auditors
The Board has carried out a competitive
tender process for the provision of audit
services and, as a result, Grant Thornton
LLP resigned as the Company’s auditor .
The Board has appointed BDO LLP to fill
the casual vacancy and a resolution to
appoint BDO LLP as auditor is included in
the notice of the Company’s Annual
General Meeting to be held on 10 May 2017. Strategic Report

Outlook
New investments will continue to be made
in earlier stage businesses which have
less ability to finance debt instruments as
they invest for growth. The majority of new
investments are therefore likely to
comprise a significantly higher proportion
of equity.  This is likely to have the impact
of reducing the portfolio’s income stream
with returns more reliant on equity
realisations.
Investment will continue to focus on high
quality businesses with good growth
potential and attractive realisation
prospects.

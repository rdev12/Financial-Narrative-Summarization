 The Group has made good progress during
2012, with results for the year at the top
end of the Board’s expectations.
Strong revenue growth from our French and
Middle East businesses, together with the
disciplined delivery of our business plan,
which targets improvements in both
operational and capital efficiency, have
enhanced the performance of the Group
and strengthened its resilience to the
economic headwinds prevailing in our
European markets.
This strategic focus has improved our
return on capital employed (“ROCE”) for
the year , delivered revenue growth and
margin improvement, as well as supported
increased fleet investment, funded an
enhanced dividend and enabled further
debt reduction.
As our business plan gathers momentum,
the Board believes that a firm operational
base is being established with an
increasingly differentiated service offering.
This firm foundation together with our
strong cash flows and healthy capital
structure, will underpin the future
development of the Group, provide
enhanced financial returns and continue to
create increased shareholder value over
the medium term.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s ROCE, our key performance
metric, increased to 10.7% for the year; a
marked improvement over the return of
9.0% in 2011. The calculation of ROCE has
been based on the Group’s operating profit
before exceptional items for 2012, and the
average of the opening and closing capital
employed for the year of £292.5 million
(2011: £306.1 million). Further
improvements are targeted in 2013 as we
look to move the Group’s ROCE above our
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of
11% across the business cycle.
Dividend
Given the continued improvement in the
Group’s financial performance, the Board is
proposing a final dividend of 2.00 pence
per share, making a total dividend for the
year of 2.75 pence; an increase of 57% over
the previous year (2011: total dividend of
1.75 pence). The final dividend, if
approved, will be paid on 30 April 2013 to
shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 8 March 2013.
The proposed increase in the dividend for
the year reflects the Board’s confidence in
the future and our continued recognition
that dividends are an important means of
delivering shareholder value. As previously
stated, we intend, over time, to increase
dividend distributions to a level that is
covered three to four times by earnings.
Dividend cover in 2012, based on
underlying earnings per share, has been
reduced to 4.7 times (2011: 5.7 times): the
pace of further progress towards our aim
will reflect the Group’s investment needs
and funding requirements as we move
through the business cycle.
Operational and capital
efficiency programmes
The expected efficiency gains from our
three year plan are being delivered through
a range of enhanced operational
procedures and processes. By the end of
2012, we had secured operational
efficiency gains of £3.7 million per annum;
slightly ahead of our schedule to achieve
our previously stated target of annualised
savings of £5.0 million by the end of 2013.
These gains have been derived over the
past two years, principally in France,
Germany and the UK, from a combination
of better pricing, improved transport
efficiency, sales resource realignment and
procurement of goods and services. 
Our capital efficiency programmes remain
focussed on realigning the level of capital
employed in our European businesses,
while looking to allocate additional capital
through fleet expansion to our Middle East
operation to meet growing demand. We
continue to dispose of surplus under-
utilised fleet, mainly from Germany, but
more recently from Belgium, as well as re-
distributing fleet to improve overall
utilisation levels. Benefits from
Chairman’s statement
2    Lavendon Group plc 2012 improvements to our maintenance
processes, originally expected as a
reduction to our cost base, are now being
delivered through improved availability of
fleet, providing increased revenue
generation capacity without additional
capital investment – an important factor
that can amplify our financial returns
when market conditions improve.
The operational and capital efficiency
programmes remain a core focus for the
Board, and they have played a key part in
the overall improvement in the Group’s
ROCE, particularly in Germany where its
ROCE performance has improved by 210
bps in the year , thereby increasing its
relative contribution towards the Group’s
overall performance.
Financial results
The Group’s total revenue for the year
increased by 4% to £234.6 million (2011:
£225.4 million), with rental revenues
increasing by 2% to £220.7 million (2011:
£216.9 million) and revenues from the sale
of new and ex-rental fleet equipment
increasing by £5.4 million.
This increased revenue, together with the
additional operational efficiency gains
secured in the period, increased underlying
operating profits by 17% to £35.0 million
(2011: £30.0 million), with margins
improving to 14.9% (2011: 13.3%).
With underlying net interest costs reducing
to £7.4 million during the year (2011: £8.1
million), the Group’s underlying profit
before tax increased by 26% to £27.6
million (2011: £21.9 million). This increase
in profitability, combined with a reduced
effective tax rate of 23% (2011: 25%),
generated an underlying profit after tax of
£21.2 million (2011: £16.5 million) and a
28% increase in underlying earnings per
share to 12.83 pence (2011: 10.03 pence).
Amortisation charges in the year increased to
£3.8 million (2011: £2.3 million), reflecting
the full year amortisation of the intangible
assets acquired as part of the acquisition of
BlueSky Access Limited in October 2011.
During the year , the Group incurred an
exceptional charge of £3.6 million (2011:
£6.3 million). This charge relates to
ongoing restructuring, principally within
our German business, and the fees
associated with the Group’s bank
refinancing in February 2012. In addition to
this charge, there was a credit of £0.7
million relating to the net fair value
movement in financial derivatives arising in
the year (2011: credit of £0.8 million).
After amortisation charges, exceptional
items and fair value movements in financial
derivatives, the Group’s operating profit
was £29.7 million (2011: £22.9 million).
The Group’s profit before tax was £20.8
million (2011: £14.2 million) and the
Group’s profit after tax was £16.2 million
(2011: £15.2 million), with earnings per
share of 9.80 pence (2011: 9.22 pence).
Using exchange rates consistent with 2011,
the Group’s total revenues for the year
increased by 6% to £239.5 million (2011:
£225.4 million), with underlying operating
profits increasing by 18% to £35.4 million
(2011: £30.0 million). Underlying profits
before tax increased by 28% to £28.0
million (2011: £21.9 million), while
underlying profits after tax increased by
30% to £21.5 million (2011: £16.5 million),
with earnings per share also increasing by
30% to 13.06 pence (2011: 10.03 pence). 
As previously reported, the Group’s Spanish
business was closed in 2011 and its results
for the comparative period have been
reported as a discontinued operation.
Cash flow
Underlying earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
increased by 5% to £75.6 million (2011:
£71.7 million), with margins improving to
32.2% (2011: 31.8%). Whilst the planned
increase in the purchase and sale of rental
fleet assets during the year resulted in net
cash outflows rising to £25.4 million (2011:
£4.4 million), the Group still generated a
healthy level of cash from operations of
£39.7 million (2011: £56.9 million). Net
cash generated from operating activities,
after payment of interest and tax, reduced
to £21.2 million (2011: £41.2 million).
Investment
As planned, the Group increased its level of
capital expenditure for 2012 with a total of
£47.9 million being invested in the Group’s
rental fleet and operational infrastructure
(2011: £16.9 million). This was partly
funded by the disposal of surplus or retired
assets which generated £11.1 million
(2011: £6.2 million). After reflecting
movements in amounts owing to equipment
suppliers at the beginning and end of the
year , this activity resulted in a net cash
outflow relating to capital expenditure of
£29.8 million (2011: £8.8 million), which
was funded from annual operating cash
flows. In 2013, it is planned to undertake
an investment programme of similar size to
2012, again funded through annual
operating cash flows.
The investment programme undertaken in
the year has replaced approximately 10% of
the Group’s rental fleet, expanded the
Middle East fleet to meet growing demand,
increased the availability of our BlueSky
range of machine attachments and
improved our operational infrastructure.
The overall impact of our fleet investment
and disposal programme has been a net
reduction in the Group’s total fleet size of
around 150 units to 19,800 machines by the
year end, but with an improved mix of
fleet and revenue-generating capability.
Net debt
Although the Group’s capital expenditure
programme increased in 2012, the strength
of the Group’s cash flows, combined with a
favourable foreign exchange movement of
£1.8 million, enabled the Group to reduce
its net debt levels at the year end to £97.3
million (2011: £106.6 million). Adjusting for
the un-amortised costs of £0.8 million
relating to the Group’s US Private
Placement in February 2012, the Group’s
reported net debt position at 31 December
2012 was £96.5 million. The corresponding
debt to equity ratio was 49% (2011: 58%),
with an improved net debt to pre-
exceptional EBITDA ratio (calculated on a 
“The Group’s ROCE, our key performance
metric, increased to 10.7% for the year;
a marked improvement over the return
of 9.0% in 2011 .”

rolling 12 month basis) of 1.28 times (2011:
1.49 times). The Group is operating well
within its banking covenants and has
significant liquidity available from its
combined finance facilities.
Refinancing
In February 2012, the Group replaced its
previous bank facilities with new debt
facilities of £150 million, comprising 
a £100 million revolving bank facility
expiring in July 2016 and a €60 million 
US Private Placement expiring in July
2019. These new facilities provide the
Group with a robust diversified financing
package, with significant liquidity that 
will support the development of the Group
in the coming years. The costs associated
with the new bank facility have been
written off as an exceptional item in 2012,
whilst the costs relating to the US Private
Placement are being amortised over the
term of that facility.
Summary and outlook
We are encouraged by the progress we
made during 2012, with our operational
and capital efficiency improvements
delivering the expected benefits, and
increasing demand continuing to drive our
Middle Eastern revenues and margins.
As a Board, the further improvement in
the Group’s ROCE continues to be our 
key priority, as we seek to move this
ahead of our weighted average cost of
capital in the coming year. Our focus
remains on the timely delivery of our
targeted operational efficiency gains, 
to enhance margins, and to allocate
capital in support of growth opportunities
and underpin our strong market positions.
In particular, further investment in our
Middle East business is planned, as we
believe the growth opportunities in that
region are considerable over the coming
years and the returns available warrant
the deployment of additional capital.
The planned increase in our investment
programme in 2012 was funded from
annual operating cash flows, enabling an
extensive replacement programme to be
undertaken in our European fleet as well
as facilitating an expansion of our Middle
East fleet to meet growing demand. 
The strength of the Group’s cash flows 
not only supported this increased level 
of investment during the year and funded
an enhanced dividend, but also facilitated
a further modest reduction in net 
debt levels. With strong cash flows, a
comfortable level of borrowings, a healthy
capital structure and enhanced liquidity
following the refinancing of the Group in
the year, we are well placed to fund our
future development and exploit growth
opportunities over the medium term.
While trading since the year end has been
disrupted by the adverse weather seen in
the UK and Continental Europe, and being
ever mindful of the continuing economic
uncertainty, the Board remains confident of
its expectations for the year as a whole and
believes the Group is well positioned to
deliver another year of financial progress
and continue to create increased
shareholder value over the medium term.

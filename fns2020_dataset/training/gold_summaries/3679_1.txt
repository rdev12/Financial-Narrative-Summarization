West Virgina Operations
The Company’s West Virginia properties are owned and
operated through its wholly-owned subsidiary Atlantic
Development and Capital LLC (“ADC”) and ADC’s wholly-owned
subsidiaries Maple Coal Co (which owns the Maple property)
and Atlantic Leaseco LLC (which owns the Gauley Eagle and
other properties).
The combined Measured and Indicated Reserves of the West
Virginia properties are as follows:

Coal International has achieved its first full
year of production at its West Virginia
operations and has continued to establish
itself as a reliable new producer of Central
Appalachian coals, with a solid
management team and growth potential.
Energybuild, in which the Company also holds an interest,
continued to make progress in advancing the redevelopment of
anthracite mining operations in South Wales and was admitted
to trading on AIM in August 2007. The Company also advanced
efforts to build value in its investment (20.1 per cent.) in NEMI.

As the business has expanded, we have worked hard to build
a solid operating team, starting with a small head office and
building a workforce for each of its operations. At the end of
June 2007 ADC had a total of 118 employees, which increased
to 151 employees as at the end of October 2007.
The average operating cost margins for thermal coal sales for
the period was negative and ADC was also carrying the cost
of keeping the Pageton property in care and maintenance as
well as Maple property overheads. Going forward,
strengthening coal prices and production at the Maple
property are expected to increase the sales price and
decrease the operating cost per ton. The negative margins
experienced during the reporting period were, in part,
attributable to higher unit costs associated with the ramp-up of
production during a period of weak prices for thermal coal. As
production has increased unit production costs have improved
and thermal coal prices have also rebounded. The
commencement of operations at Maple Coal, which produces
metallurgical grade coals which sell at significantly higher
prices than thermal coals, will continue to enhance operating
margins. Going forward, further strengthening of thermal coal
prices and commencement of metallurgical production at the
Maple property are expected to increase the sales revenue
per ton and improve the margin per ton. 
Atlantic Leaseco
Upon completion of refurbishment of a shuttered preparation
plant, we commenced mining operations at the Atlantic
Leaseco properties in March 2006 by opening the Silo Mains
underground mine and the Crooked Run surface mining
operation. Initial mining was carried out with third party mining
contractors at both the surface and underground operations.
By the end of July 2006, contract miners were replaced by
Group personnel and direct operating control was achieved for
all coal mining and washing operations. This move allowed
management to substantially improve mine planning,
productivity and equipment utilisation and has resulted in a
continuous improvement in operational performance at all
levels throughout the reporting period. Management believes
it has normalised current operations at Atlantic Leaseco at
a sustainable production rate of approximately 750,000
marketable tons per annum from captive operations, in
addition to third party coal which is purchased, washed,
marketed and sold by the Group. 
Atlantic Leaseco added significantly to its 14,970 acre
leaseholdings at the Gauley Eagle property during the period
by signing new leases covering 2,760 acres adjacent to or
with the potential to provide synergies with current holdings.
We are currently in negotiations for additional leases
covering over 2,500 acres of contiguous coal lands. These
acquisitions will facilitate long term surface and underground
mining operations at Atlantic Leaseco properties and also
provide the Group access to a reserve of Peerless seam coal,
a seam with high quality characteristics which is expected
to command a premium price in the industrial market. 
To date, substantially all of the production from Atlantic Leaseco
has been sold in the thermal coal market. Start up of the Maple
operations in June 2007 has created marketing synergies for
the Group based on coal blending from the two properties and
will enable Atlantic Leaseco to sell a portion of its production
into the metallurgical coal market, by blending Atlantic
Leaseco’s Kittanning seam coal together with Maple’s Eagle
seam coal. We are developing our marketing strategy for the
recently acquired Peerless seam reserves. 
To advance market opportunities, as well as to plan for
continued growth, we have continued to follow an aggressive
permitting strategy by working with State and Federal
authorities to enable the expansion of both surface and
underground operations at Atlantic Leaseco properties. 
Maple Coal
Building on our success at the Atlantic Leaseco properties, the
Group began the recommissioning of operations at the Maple
property. The Group controls approximately 21,214 acres
located in Fayette and Kanawha Counties, West Virginia that
had previously been mined but shuttered since the early 1990s.
The property contains substantial resources which can be
accessed via surface mining operations as well as significant
underground resources and has excellent potential for further

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
WE ARE PLEASED TO REPORT
ANOTHER YEAR OF STRONG
RESULTS WITH RECORD
REVENUE, SIGNIFICANTLY
IMPROVED OPERATIONAL CASH
FLOW AND REDUCED NET DEBT.
This is an excellent performance,
especially in Brazil that has been
achieved against challenging trading
conditions.
2009 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
Delivery of the TUPI Extended Well Test
(EWT) project
The award of the TUPI qualification
programme
Completion of a 39% increase in
capacity with minimal disruption
Leased additional land adjacent to the
Niterói facility
Manufacture of the 15,000psi high
pressure risers for Anadarko’s Caesar
Tonga project
Successful divestment of our onshore
FlexSteel operations for £19.6m to
Prime Natural Resources Inc
Substantial completion of the Group’s
first major installation project
We have delivered a Lost Time Incident
(LTI) free year in Newcastle and achieved
our best ever safety performance in
Niterói. This is a tremendous achievement
and complements our objective to be a
worldwide leader in QHSE performance.
We look forward with optimism as the
oil and gas industry continues to explore
ever deeper and more remote oil and gas
fields where the production facilities are
dependent upon flexible pipe. The Group
has performed very well in a buoyant
Brazilian market and exceeded its
operational targets. The long term future
is bright and the restructuring steps taken
during the year will maintain the Group’s
ability and skills to take advantage of the
long term growth within our sector.
SERVICE
“We commit, we deliver, no excuses”
is our mantra. We have a long tradition
of excellent customer service and
responsiveness which is one of our
key differentiators over our competitors.
We are very proud of our quality record
where our design specifications and
attention to detail have resulted in an
excellent record of delivering flexible
pipe that has performed beyond
customer expectations. This is a tribute
to our organisation and to our people
who continue to demonstrate a
dedication to meeting customer needs
and I record my thanks to them.
STRATEGY
DEVELOPING SERVICES WITHIN
THE WATER COLUMN THAT
COMPLEMENT OUR EXISTING
PRODUCTS.
Wellstream’s strategy continues to be
one of building a leadership position as a
supplier of bespoke engineered flexible
pipeline products for the hydrocarbon
industry around the world. This leadership
position is being built through superior
customer relationships, innovation,
technology, engineering, manufacturing
and project delivery excellence. The
business will continue to deliver growth
organically and through alliances and
acquisitions as opportunities arise.
Currently we are focussing on:-
Qualification of new materials for “sour
service” and deepwater applications
Research and development of high
pressure technologies
Enhancing local R&D capabilities
Offering an Integrity Management
Service in order to monitor in-service
performance of installed products
Developing and acquiring installation
equipment to provide a differentiated
technology for installation services
whilst optimising our timing according
to market conditions.

MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS
DURING THE YEAR
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS DURING
THE YEAR INCLUDE SECURING
ADDITIONAL LEASED LAND
ADJACENT TO THE NITERÓI
PLANT OF APPROXIMATELY
55,000M
2
.
This gives us the capacity to further
expand the Brazil factory as the market
dictates and to offer logistics support and
other services. The site is particularly well
located in relation to the new Pre-Salt
TUPI discovery and we are pleased to
have secured the flexibility that this facility
offers. This will also place us in a stronger
position to access the wider South
Atlantic basin including the target
market of West Africa.
Earlier in the year we increased capacity
in the Niterói facility by 80% to 270nKms
pa, which together with an increase of
15% in Newcastle to 300nKms pa,
gives a total capacity Group wide of
570nKms pa. Total throughput for the
plants increased by 19% to 436nKms
in 2009 (2008: 367nKms).
We were awarded the contract to supply
flowlines and risers for the TUPI Pre-Salt
Extended Well Test (EWT) project.
Subsequently we were pleased to be
awarded the contract to supply flexible
pipelines for further phases of the project.
This, along with the Caesar Tonga
contract for 15,000psi high pressure
risers, demonstrates our customers’
confidence in Wellstream’s cutting edge
technology expertise.
We divested our FlexSteel onshore
business for £19.6m in September to
Prime Natural Resources Inc. This has
enabled us to concentrate more fully
on our core offshore business.
During the year we also undertook a cost
restructuring exercise to position the
Group for the downturn. During this
process we have been careful to retain
the knowledge and skills critical to
remaining a world class manufacturer
and to be able to rapidly respond to a
recovery in the market.
We substantially completed our first major
installation contract offshore North
Western Australia under the Seastream
joint venture. A total of 54Kms of flexible
pipe product was installed using
Wellstream equipment. The completion
of this project represents a significant
milestone for the business and the
experience gained allows us to look
forward with confidence to delivery
of future installation projects. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

OFFSHORE MARKET OVERVIEW
AND FUTURE TRENDS
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THE
FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE
DRAMATIC FALL IN OIL PRICES
AT THE END OF 2008 WERE FELT
THROUGHOUT THE OIL AND
GAS INDUSTRY DURING 2009.
These two factors combined to cause
delays in project awards throughout the
year. However, a recovery in the second
half of 2009 has seen oil prices stabilise
around $60/bbl to $70/bbl. Long term,
the fundamentals of the sector in which
Wellstream operates remain very positive,
and current oil prices are substantially
above the level required to ensure floating
production projects are economic and
this should set the stage for a recovery.
Despite the slow down in contract
awards, the number of FPSO projects in
the bidding phase has remained constant
and the number of FPSOs being planned
has increased from last year. Between
2009 and 2013, expenditure on FPSO
systems is expected to increase by
40% from $4.4bn to $6.2bn
(c)
.
Oil and gas remains the world’s dominant
energy source, and accessible resources
onshore and in shallow water areas
offshore are diminishing. Oil companies
are therefore continuing to focus on
exploring and developing offshore in
deepwater utilising subsea and floating
production technologies. Flexible
pipelines are a critical element of
the majority of these developments;
connecting the wellheads to the surface
via flexible flowlines and risers. Thus,
the increased use of these facilities in
combination with subsea completions
has been one of the drivers for rapid
growth in Wellstream’s business.
National Oil Companies, and in particular
Petrobras, continued to invest significantly
during 2009 in order to sustain their long
term growth plans. Petrobras has stated
that they require 4,000Km of flexible
pipe products between 2009 and 2013;
primarily to develop their recent Pre-Salt
discoveries. This demand, combined
with increasing activity levels driven by
other International and Independent
Oil companies in Brazil, will underpin
production in our Brazilian facility
going forward.
Elsewhere, long term demand growth
is evident in both Asia and West Africa
and this potential is further supplemented
by the recent increase in interest around
FLNG (Floating Liquefied Natural Gas)
developments; all of which will require
significant volumes of flexible pipeline
products.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
The market for flexible pipelines and
risers is a subset of a larger “deepwater
pipeline” market which includes alternative
rigid pipeline solutions. These compete
with flexible solutions and converting
these developments into projects that
utilise flexible pipeline products provides
the potential for growth. Conversion of
these projects has the potential to grow
the market by over 50%. Enabling this
growth and increasing the adoption rate
of flexible pipeline technology is central
to Wellstream’s strategy.
In addition to project development driven
demand, 2009 has seen an increase in
the number of enquires regarding integrity
management for either ageing installed
infrastructure, or complex new
developments. This therefore, is seen
as an emerging market segment which
presents Wellstream with significant
opportunities for further growth.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
16/17
THE 2008 ANNUAL REPORT
HIGHLIGHTED THE 1,034BAR
(15,000PSI) PRESSURE RATING
PROGRAMME UNDERTAKEN WITH
ANADARKO PETROLEUM AND
DESCRIBED SOME OF THE WORK
THAT WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN. 
As with all developments that significantly
enhance the performance envelope, it has
successfully employed cross-functional
teams, utilising specialists from R&D,
engineering, analysis, materials, testing
and manufacturing. This has ensured that
we have met the stringent industry safety
standards and also the performance
criteria for the high pressure market.
The programme through 2009 has
continued to produce results which
showcase the capability of the proposed
high pressure riser design. Static tests,
including burst, tension and hydrostatic
collapse results, continue to prove how
our design methodologies predict
product performance. For the hydrostatic
collapse, there was the added benefit
that the results demonstrated capability
beyond 3,000m, far exceeding current
market requirements. 
Moving into 2010, the dynamic fatigue
tests continue to progress well and the
milestones for in-service lifetime have
already been met, and the programmes
now continue as validation data for our
in-house software that is used to predict
service life. 
Building on the success of the 
TUPI EWT, we are participating in the
TUPI qualification programme, which
encompasses gas lift, water injection, gas
injection and production structures, and 
is planned to be concluded in 2010. This
programme is enhancing our database for
materials exposed to super-critical carbon
dioxide and for full product tests at the
extremes of the Pre-Salt design envelope.
Our commitment to the Pre-Salt began
ahead of the main TUPI qualification
contract, resulting in significant progress
on our materials tests with more than
3,000 samples. This programme is
therefore already supplying valuable 
data to our design teams to meet the
challenges on the Pre-Salt. Likewise, 
the full-scale tests are already underway
with an extensive programme of almost
100 tests for the TUPI structures and
again, some structures are presenting
successful results far exceeding the 
field requirements of 2,500m. 
We will continue to build our local R&D
capability in Brazil where we will focus on
the demands of the deepwater Pre-Salt
but also to enhance our global provision.
We are developing our relationship with
the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro -
COPPE, where a number of research
programmes have already been identified,
as well as the Petrobras research centre
CENPES. We also work with five other
Universities in Brazil. In both the UK 
and US, our focus will be to continue to
support global operations and enhance
focus on product innovation and
monitoring technology.
THE PROGRAMME THROUGH
2009 HAS CONTINUED TO
PRODUCE RESULTS WHICH
SHOWCASE THE CAPABILITY
OF THE PROPOSED HIGH
PRESSURE RISER DESIGN.  WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
BRAZIL
During the year 36 projects were worked
on for Petrobras ranging in value from
£0.3million up to £55million. Most notable
were the Cachalote, Petrobras P51,
Marlim Leste Module 2 and Barracuda
Caratinga projects. Also completed
during the year was the Peregrino project
for Statoil’s South Atlantic Holdings.
REST OF THE WORLD
A diverse range of projects were
undertaken, generally smaller in scale
than in Brazil. Projects were undertaken
for Maersk, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil,
Chevron, Anadarko Petroleum, BHP
Billiton, Total, BP , Statoil, Mariner Energy,
Halliburton, CNR and PetroSA. 
INSTALLATION
Seastream largely completed the base
scope of its first major project in North
Western Australia. Seastream performed
the offshore works over a nine month
period utilising the new build Sea Trucks’
construction vessel “Jascon 25”. 
SUPPL Y CHAIN
During 2009 the supply chain risks arising
from the global economic recession were
successfully managed. We experienced
some disruption in the first half due to a
one-off material processing challenge.
While this impacted the business in H1
we were able to mitigate its effects and
supplies for the remainder of the year
were unaffected.
Increased localisation of supplies into
Brazil was a key feature of the year. This
helped to offset the risks arising from the
global recession by reducing logistics
costs and lead times and the widening 
of the pool of available suppliers.
Renewal of key long term agreements 
will provide for continuity of competitive
supply and the development of new
products to support the Group’s product
development objectives. To achieve
economies of scale the key raw materials
of carbon steels, stainless steels and
polymers continue to be sourced 
globally with local supply prioritised 
where applicable.
The Group continues to reinforce ethical
trading within the supply chain working
closely with the QHSE function to monitor
key competencies in this field. We
conduct regular visits to suppliers to
monitor their performance, facilities 
and systems including environmental
management systems.
The supply chain is an integral part of 
the Group’s corporate risk monitoring
process to ensure that all potential risks
and sustainability are fully assessed and
managed.

KEY PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS (KPIs)
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
WELLSTREAM IMPLEMENTS A
PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE
BUSINESS.
At the start of every year the critical
success factors are reviewed and key
performance indicators are set. As 
the business environment changes so
may the critical success factors and
associated KPIs. The Board monitors
these KPI targets and assesses
performance against these targets
throughout the year. These KPIs are
cascaded throughout the business and
more detailed KPIs are also created that
align with geographical centres and
business functions. 
KPI targets exist throughout the business.
Their significance changes as the
business develops. Increased focus 
on cash as a whole has been reflected in
a change to the key supply chain metric.
(1) EBITDA defined as operating profit before interest,
taxation, depreciation and amortisation is a measure 
of profitability within the business.
(2) Offshore margin measures the profit generated 
on offshore projects in the year. It is calculated by
deducting materials, transportation and other project
costs from revenue on a contract by contract basis.
(3) Working capital measured as a percentage of 
trailing revenue (Last 12 months of rolling revenue) 
is a measure of cash used within the supply chain 
as a whole.
(4) Throughput is measured in normalised kilometres
(nKms) as a measure of capacity utilisation. 
(5) The KPI for technology reflects return on research 
effort. The target is six times return. The measure is 
new 2009 work revenues or cost savings arising from
development work in the period 2004-2008 divided 
by 2009 projected internal/external non-staff spend.
(6) Offshore orders are the value of future revenue added to
backlog on receipt of a customer order. It is a measure
of the rate at which we win new business.
(7) The QHSE measure is a leading indicator, “Percent
Safe”. It is based on audits that are carried out over 
200 days in the year which specifically measure
adherence to job risk evaluation.

assessment of operational, financial,
strategic, compliance and environmental
risks and mitigating actions. Key risks
highlighted at the 2009 year-end include:
PETROBRAS IS A KEY
CUSTOMER OF WELLSTREAM
Petrobras commanded over 59% of
Wellstream’s business in 2009 and we
continue to focus on diversifying our
client base.
SUPPL Y CHAIN 
Wellstream’s supply chain is critical to the
operation and for certain material types
there are sole source vendors for which
the risk is elevated. Through 2009 we
have worked closely with the suppliers
and have maintained good levels of quality
and delivery after some initial disruption
and attendant materials processing issues
experienced in the first quarter. There
have been no major interruptions to the
supply base during the remainder of the
year. The establishment of effective long
term vendor framework agreements
remains an integral part of the supply
chain strategy.
CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION
Wellstream’s business is founded on a
relatively small number of high value
customers including Petrobras. If
requested project lead times from these
customers change significantly, revenue
and margin performance could be put at
risk. In order to mitigate this, Wellstream
continues to broaden its customer base,
develop new relationships in selected
regions and apply the principle of
focussed account management to its
strategically targeted customer base.
RISK AND 
UNCERTAINTIES
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW: 24/25
VOLATILITY OF THE 
OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY
The price of oil and gas and levels of
business confidence across oil and gas
markets are key drivers for Wellstream’s
business. The trends towards the use 
of deepwater, floating production and
subsea technologies are also important.
A sustained and significant reduction in 
oil and gas prices and/or a reduction 
in business confidence or continued
volatility as seen over recent months
could have an adverse impact on the
level of customer spending. To mitigate
this exposure Wellstream strives to
maintain in-depth market intelligence, 
to gather and use client feedback and
to plan capacity, throughput and its
cost base so that any downturn can
be weathered effectively.
MARGIN PRESSURE AND
COMPETITION RISK
The current downturn has inevitably 
put pressure on margin as we react to
industry drivers to cut cost and remain
competitive. These pressures are likely 
to persist. By aggressively challenging 
our cost base we have retained our
competitiveness. We are beginning 
to see some signs of the pressures
easing with increasing FPSO deliveries.
Reduced backlog worldwide has led to
increased competitive pressure and
competitor expansion may increase 
these pressures further however 
barriers to entry remain high.
INSTALLATION
Where it is a customer preference, 
we can offer flexible pipe on an installed
basis utilising EPCI (Engineering,
Procurement, Construction, and
Installation) style contracting, managing
all the services necessary to install flexible
pipe and other water column ancillaries.
Risks of offering our flexible pipe on an
installed basis can differ from those
associated with flexible pipe supply; in
particular possible project delays, broader
competition impacting project margin and
potential execution risk. We manage this
by closely monitoring project execution
and by negotiating appropriate
contractual terms.

CULTURE
Wellstream believes that significant
competitive advantage can be derived
from our people in terms of their know-
how, experience and how they go about
their work. We strive to create a culture of
enabling people to perform and operate
to the best of their ability, and in providing
the right structure, processes and
support for them to do their job. 
VALUES & OPPORTUNITY 
Wellstream has a flat style organisation
which makes us more responsive to
customers’ needs and business
opportunities. A key strength is our ability
to build partnerships with customers,
suppliers, employees and with the local
communities in which we operate.
Wellstream’s core values underpin the
way we work with these stakeholders. 
POLICY AND PRACTICE 
Wellstream has a range of established
employment polices and practices
applying local variation where necessary
including a strong emphasis on health
and safety policies. Policies are agreed
with trade union representatives, in 
both Brazil and the UK, where formal
negotiation frameworks exist. Overall
accountability for employment policies
lies with our Acting Chief Executive
Officer who reports on employment
issues to the Board. 
EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY
The Group commits to policies against
discrimination on the grounds of gender,
race, ethnicity, disability, age, nationality,
sexuality, religion or belief, or marital
status. In doing so, we strive to create
an equality culture where all our people
are treated fairly and equally.
TALENT DEVELOPMENT
In 2009 we continued to place emphasis
on building capability throughout the
business to ensure that employees are
fully equipped to do their job and to
provide the future talent pool for 
the Group. 
Graduates – we continued to invest 
in graduate recruitment in 2009. 
To supplement our technology and
engineering graduate intake of the
previous two years, this year we
targeted commercial graduates in 
our sales, procurement and finance
functions. 
Interns – our Brazil facility supported
some 25 internship students in 2009,
across the full range of workplace
disciplines. Interns are university
students who combine academic 
study with workplace training and, in
Wellstream, carry out specific jobs
rather than work shadow.
Apprentices – in the UK, we increased
our intake of young apprentices 
during the year, with nine joining our
manufacturing facility in April 2009 in
both engineering and operations roles.
As part of their four year programme,
apprentices combine practical on the
job training with day release at college.
The Group sponsored 17 degree
programmes in 2009 relevant to the
subsea industry.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT
AND TRAINING 
During 2009, we developed a
competency framework for our
Manufacturing, Technology and Projects
and Engineering functions. In support 
of our Continuous Improvement and lean
manufacturing philosophy, this framework
will enable manufacturing operators to
become fully competent at all stages 
of the production line.
All of our UK managers completed a five
day IOSH training course during 2009 to
equip them with a deeper understanding
of their team safety management
responsibility. 75% of our manufacturing
operators and lead operators have
undertaken accredited business
improvement training, qualifying them 
in NVQ and BTEC. 
In Brazil, we exceeded performance
measures set by the Brazil Association 
for Training, with 92% of our employees
having participated in training and
development during 2009, averaging 
60 hours per employee. This compares
favourably with Brazilian labour averages
when compared with data from the
Brazilian Association for Training and
Development.
UNIVERSITY LINKS
Collaboration with Newcastle University
and local industry resulted in the
development of an MSc in Subsea
Engineering and Management which 
was launched in October 2009 together 
with a subsea college foundation degree,
broadening and strengthening the profile
of subsea engineering in the North East
of England.
INVESTORS IN PEOPLE
RETENTION AND HEADCOUNT
Our investment in training and
development is recognised by retaining
our Investors in People standard for the
11th consecutive year. This confirms the
strength and quality of our training and
development provision, leadership,
performance management and
communication within the Company.
Delivering our business objectives
depends upon our ability to identify,
attract, retain and manage skills
effectively. We deploy suitable reward
systems and strive to be the employer of
choice. Our Company wide turnover rate
continues to be low, with an annualised
turnover figure under 3.5%, exclusive of
the restructuring undertaken during 2009.
COMMUNICATION AND
ENGAGEMENT
During times of change, it has been very
important for us to remain focussed on
engaging with our employees. As part of
our internal communication plan, we have
applied increased rigour to our employee
briefing processes, including employee
‘town hall’ forums with management. 
We engage regularly and formally with
union representatives in both Brazil and
the UK in respect of negotiating employee
terms and conditions. In the UK, our
relationship is with the GMB via a joint
consultative committee. This is
supplemented by employee forums 
with management.

CHANGE PROGRAMME
BRANDED ‘JOURNEY TO ZERO’. 
At the time of launch this programme had
a stated aim of achieving Zero injuries
and ill health, outstanding quality with
Zero re-work and Zero harm to the
environment. Over the last three years the
Company has focused on delivering HSE
improvements by developing the HSE
culture with considerable success.
HEALTH & SAFETY
During 2009, the Company continued on
its ‘Journey to Zero’ by consolidating and
developing the 2008 HSE improvement
programmes with significant success. The
Company has worked hard to ingrain its
fundamental belief that “nothing we do is
so urgent or important that we cannot
take the time to do it safely”. The ‘Journey
to Zero’ programme includes the percent
safe programme which is a behavioural
safety programme which includes
enhanced near miss and observational
reporting. HSE Management Systems –
provide the framework for controlling 
risks and include the following elements;
HSE Resource – provide competent
support and advice
IOSH training – for line managers
and operators
% Safe Auditing – daily behavioural audit
Take 2 – pre-job assessment checklist
Deal with it – near miss reporting system
Just Culture – performance
management tool
The Wellstream Way – continuous
improvement
Tool Box Talks – pre-job briefings.
NEWCASTLE FACILITY
At the Newcastle site the Lost Time
Incident Rate (LTIR) reached Zero for
the first time since 2000 and the Total
OSHA Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR),
reached its lowest point in the Group’s
history. This change in the TRIR
represents an 81% improvement since
the commencement of the Journey 
to Zero programme in January 2007. 
We are delighted to have consolidated
the real improvement in key metrics 
on which we reported last year.
NITERÓI FACILITY
In Niterói, the trends for H1 were initially
adverse however our reporting systems
identified the trends and as a result,
stronger management focus was
implemented on leading metrics. The
trend is now reversed and is on target
to match Newcastle’s excellent record.
These improvements in performance
have been instrumental in allowing the
Group to retain once again ROSPA 
Gold Awards across both sites.  WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

SAFETY INITIATIVES
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW:
The Group HSE programme ‘Journey 
to Zero’ has continued, in addition
the following HSE initiatives have further
contributed to the Health and Safety
performance improvements over the
last year.
Revitalisation of our near miss
reporting system – Implementation 
of a weekly review meeting has
significantly improved workforce
engagement and closeout rates which
has in turn ensured the credibility of 
the processes. This resulted in a 
10% improvement in closure rates.
Embedding the ‘Percent Safe’ 
auditing programme – Building on the
programme which was implemented 
in 2008 to increase the focus on
behavioural rather than workplace
elements. This has ensured all
personnel maintain their focus on the
critical element of health and safety
management.
The Wellstream Way – This is the 
brand name for the Group’s Continuous
Improvement Programme which was
implemented in 2008. Following the
successful launch of the programme
many benefits are being realised through
the application of lean philosophies. 
A significant exercise commenced in
2009 reviewing all existing business
processes in support of the
development of our Enterprise 
Resource Planning processes.
5c auditing process – In addition 
to our ‘Journey to Zero’ programme
Wellstream adopted the continuous
improvement process based on the
Japanese 5S principles.
Hazard Boards – Each Work Centre
Team summarised the areas’ Hazards
and Control Measures on a Hazard
Board which is clearly displayed on
the Work Centre. This is used as an
induction tool for visitors to the area
and has increased risk awareness 
of the Work Centre Teams.
IOSH Managing Safely – This was
critical in developing the safety
knowledge of Wellstream Supervisory
personnel. This programme built on the
successes achieved through the
implementation of the IOSH Working
Safely training that was rolled out to
non-supervisory employees throughout
2007 and 2008.
ENVIRONMENT
Wellstream Newcastle has been certified
to ISO 14001 since 2001. Our Brazil
facility has implemented the requirements
of the Environmental Management system
which is certified to ISO 14001. Full
accreditation is expected in H1 this year.
As part of our ISO 14001 management
system the Group implemented a number
of environmental improvements in 2009.
CASE STUDY:
Wellstream’s Newcastle site is situated 
on the banks of the River Tyne. This 
was recognised as an area of potential
environmental risk. In 2009, the Group
reviewed chemical storage and “bunding”
arrangements on site which resulted in
the installation of a drain bladder in the
main discharge point to the River Tyne 
to ensure that drains can be isolated to
prevent any spillages reaching the river 
in an emergency. WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009

SAFETY INITIATIVES
ENERGY MANAGEMENT
Wellstream undertook its first carbon
footprint survey in 2008. This exercise
was repeated in 2009. We have reduced
our carbon footprint during 2009 by in
excess of 10% and have targeted a
further 10% reduction on our 2008
baseline for 2010. 
2009 has also seen the introduction 
of carbon management processes in
preparation for the introduction of the
Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy
Efficiency Scheme in 2010. This will be 
a key challenge for the Group in 2010.
A number of other improvement
opportunities have been identified within
our manufacturing facilities. These 
will release further energy reduction
opportunities once implemented.
ETHICAL TRADING POLICIES
Wellstream has a robust business conduct
policy that ensures the Group trades
legally, fairly, openly, honestly and with
transparency in all dealings. The policy
is highly visible and governs the actions
of all employees in the conduct of
Wellstream’s business and in respect
of the Group’s dealings with customers,
suppliers, clients, contractors and
intermediaries. The Group’s business
conduct policy covers gifts and hospitality,
international business relationships,
conflicts of interest, confidential information
and the reporting of misconduct.
The Group completed additional training
to enhance the above with a view also to
providing adequate procedures in relation
to both the forthcoming UK Bribery Act
and the USA Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act. The Group is committed to following
a stringent fraud and anti-corruption
policy to ensure all business is conducted
in a legal, fair and honest manner. This
policy governs the actions of all employees
and is accessible to all. The Group will
not tolerate fraud, corrupt, dishonest 
or illegal activity amongst employees,
customers, suppliers or intermediaries. 
Wellstream also operates under the
guidance of a whistle blowing policy. The
whistle blowing policy states the course of
action an employee should take if they
have concerns. All policies are available to
view on the website www.wellstream.com.

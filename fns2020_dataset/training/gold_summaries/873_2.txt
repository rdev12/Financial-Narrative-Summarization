Review of our year: the Amino opportunity
Review of ou R yea R: 
the Amino opportunity The saying; “May you live in interesting 
times” is meant to be a curse. Well, the 
world of digital entertainment has never 
seen more interesting times and, for 
many traditional players, it may well be 
a curse. But for disruptors, challengers 
and innovators, there has never been 
more opportunity.
For the IPTV players and for a new 
generation of challengers that Amino 
enables, the field is wide open.
This is my first annual report as the CEO 
of Amino and, after delivering a solid year 
of results and making two strategically 
important acquisitions, I’m very excited about 
the opportunities ahead and the assets Amino 
has assembled to maximise them.
At last we’re entering the commercial phase 
of IPTV market development. Major operators 
and content players all over the world have now 
committed to the business, deployed the 
infrastructure and attracted serious customer 
numbers with innovative new services.
Now it’s time to step up a gear; to deliver 
better quality (with HD and MPEG-4 
compression); to deliver new services 
that combine traditional broadcast with 
Video-on-Demand (VoD) and Internet video 
Over-The-Top (OTT); and to start using the 
techniques of the best Internet retailers to 
actively promote relevant content rather than 
passively stacking it on a virtual TV shelf.
Amino is in the ideal position to exploit these 
trends and help power the next generation of 
IPTV. In a market characterised by a complex 
ecosystem, we are creating a compelling 
IPTV offering that is complete, open and 
sustainable. Our acquisition of AssetHouse 
in June 2008 marked a significant step in our 
transformation from a pure-play hardware 
company to a solutions business that offers 
more value to a wider range of players.
AssetHouse is a true leader in digital content 
merchandising software. In a previous role 
while launching the BT Vision service, I chose 
them to help us actively promote content to 
users. It’s an incredibly powerful solution 
and perfectly placed for the needs of the 
market today.
The recent acquisition of Tilgin’s IPTV division 
not only drives greater scale through new 
customer and partner relationships, but 
also gives us innovative new features like 
picture-in-picture and whole-home Personal 
Video Recorder (PVR) – features that help our 
operators acquire more customers, reduce 
churn and compete more effectively.
Bringing Amino, Tilgin IPTV and AssetHouse 
together gives us a bigger slice of the value 
chain and a more compelling offering for Tier 1 
operators. It also brings us a significant step 
closer to our vision of “full-circle content 
merchandising” – a combination of hardware 
and software that helps operators deliver 
a compelling, personalised experience 
to the consumer.
These are indeed interesting times.

Review of our year: the Amino opportunity
The IPTV market continues to grow, creating 
more and more opportunities for Amino. 
In both established and emerging markets, 
operators have continued to add significant 
customer numbers and deliver innovative 
new services. Highlights include:
•  Informa Telecoms & Media forecasts strong 
growth, resulting in 57.0m IPTV homes 
by 2013 – triple the 2008 figure;
•  In the short term, Informa projects 18.6m 
IPTV households by the end of 2008 – 
up 8m in the year; 
•  Asia Pacific and Western Europe are each 
responsible for nearly 3m of the additional 
households, with North America adding 1.7m;
•  Eastern Europe is experiencing strong growth 
with an 85% increase in IPTV take-up over 
the last twelve months to 1.48m households 
– a number forecast to increase four-fold 
by 2012;
•  By 2013, Asia Pacific will contribute 22.2m of 
the 57.0m global total. China alone will have 
crossed the 10m mark.

As subscriber bases reach critical mass for 
many operators, the opportunities for selling 
new services continue to grow. 
Beyond the operator-driven IPTV market, 
a growing adoption of OTT services – 
including Internet delivered video portals 
such as YouTube and TV 2.0 services such 
as Sezmi Corporation – opens up new 
revenue opportunities for our products.
Amino now makes money in five ways:
STB product sales – still the bulk of 
our revenue;
Licencing – our core technology ‘stack’ 
to partners in emerging markets;
Support fees – from our global installed base;
Systems integration fees – leveraging 
our expertise in IPTV delivery and 
infrastructure; and
Software and solutions – with our new 
AssetHouse platform and related solutions.

growing opportunity Our revenue streams

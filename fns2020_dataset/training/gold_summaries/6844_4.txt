 Results
I am pleased to report another record
performance in the 53 weeks ended 4
May 2002, with all areas of the business
contributing to the progress of the
company. Turnover for the year was up
15 per cent at £494.5 million and profit
before tax, goodwill and exceptional
items was ahead by 10 per cent to £69.2 million.
We are recommending a final net dividend of 19.45 pence per
share, producing a total dividend for the year of 27.3 pence
per share - up 10 per cent - on the back of a 10 per cent rise
in adjusted earnings per share to 64.2 pence. The dividend
will be paid on 6 September 2002 to those shareholders on
the register at the close of business on 2 August 2002.
These record results are evidence that our strategy of
improving the quality of our people and assets, focusing on the
quality pub and traditional beer markets, and making strategic
moves which strengthen the long-term prospects of the core
business, is creating sustainable value for our shareholders.
Finance
A combination of strong operational cash flows and proceeds
from further non-strategic asset disposals allowed us to fund
£165.7 million of acquisition and capital expenditure from cash,
resulting in only a moderate increase in our debt to equity ratio
from 67 per cent at the start of the year to 86 per cent at its end.
We also took the opportunity to buy back and cancel 
£4.1 million of our own equity during the year in order to
improve shareholder returns. Interest cover improved to a
healthy 3.9 times, despite the increase in debt, and the
recommended dividend is covered 2.4 times. We have an
efficient balance sheet which retains significant potential to
finance the company’s future growth aspirations.
Investment
Our strategy of investing prudently in the core business
continued to produce good results. This organic investment
programme is designed to improve the quality of our pub
estate at a sustainable rate and to achieve levels of return in
excess of our cost of finance. It also has the merit of ensuring
that a significant number of investment opportunities remain
within the business to provide future profit growth.
Capital expenditure rose 88 per cent to £60.9 million
compared with the previous year, although £17.1 million of
this investment related to individual site acquisitions, of
which £12.1 million was for the purchase of 8 Hungry Horse
sites in Scotland in April 2002.
Asset disposals
We continued our programme of rationalising those assets
which do not fit our long-term strategic criteria, albeit at a
lower rate than in the previous year. Total disposal proceeds
were £8.1 million, achieving a profit on book value of 
£1.5 million, with 29 non-core pubs being sold.
Acquisition of Old English Inns
On 7 September 2001 we announced a recommended offer
of £104.8 million for Old English Inns, which passed into our
management control on 13 September. Old English Inns
owned and managed 136 premium inns spread across the
south of the country, offering high quality food, drink and
accommodation.
We have been rationalising and integrating the business, and
are retaining 77 of the properties under management,
transferring 32 to lease agreements and marketing the non-
core remainder for sale. We are confident that the integrated
business will benefit significantly from much needed
investment and greater management focus, and that Old
English represents an excellent long-term opportunity to
create sustainable value for shareholders.
Post balance sheet acquisition of Morrells
We completed the acquisition of Morrells of Oxford Limited
on 17 June 2002 for a consideration of £67 million, including
the assumption of £30.4 million of debt. Morrells owns 
57 managed and 50 tenanted pubs, which are primarily
traditional freeholds located within 30 miles of Oxford.
The purchase is consistent with our strategy of developing
the scale and quality of our pub estate across the south, and
will be integrated speedily within our business.

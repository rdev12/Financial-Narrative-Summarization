Kounrad – Kazakhstan
Operation
CAML was awarded the contract to develop the 
Kounrad project in 2007. The agreement was 
structured as a 60/40 joint venture and in May 
2014 the Company completed the transaction to 
acquire 100% ownership of the project. 
Having raised $60 million at the IPO in September 
2010, CAML built its Kounrad SX-EW copper 
plant in central Kazakhstan. The construction was 
completed early in 2012 at a cost of $39 million – 
approximately 15% below the budget. Built in just 
21 months, the 10,000 tonnes per annum plant, 
started production in late April 2012. Since that 
time a total of 28,232 tonnes of copper has been 
produced up to 31 December 2014.
Resource
The resources at Kounrad were classified as JORC 
compliant during 2013 and it is estimated that 
the dumps contain over 650 million tonnes of 
material containing copper in excess of 600,000 
tonnes.
The leaching process to extract the copper will 
recover between 35% and 51% of the contained 
copper depending on the mineralogy of the 
material. In parallel to the JORC classification the 
resources were also placed onto the approved 
‘State Balance’ of geological resources during 
2013. The Eastern and Western dumps cover a 
combined area of 22km

In 2014, CAML delivered record production at 
the Kounrad copper project in Kazakhstan and 
maintained it’s low cost position.

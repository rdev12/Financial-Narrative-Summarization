 ANT PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008  5
Chairman’s Statement
for the year ended 31 December 2008
2008 was a strong year for ANT. We saw a significant
increase in our licensing business, with our licensees
continuing to ship in increasing volumes. As a result, the
Group reported results ahead of expectations and, despite
difficult market conditions, is working to achieve another
good year. The operational management team continues to
exercise tight control over key business drivers which is
underlined by the Group’s cash position of £5.6m at the
year end. 
ANT is a high margin business servicing the long term
growth of the television market. The Group’s software,
which has been designed specifically for television, has
already achieved significant market share. The business is
well positioned to take advantage of this growth, which is
evident in the increase in units shipped, 56% up on 2007.
ANT is also seeing its product portfolio growing in
relevance to other digital television markets broadening the
Group’s future opportunities.
With operators facing increasing pressures to maximise
revenue potential and offset falling advertising streams and
consumers being driven by changes in technology (digital
switch over and high definition upgrades) our products’
ability to drive increased services and value into the
consumers’ relationship with their television is key.
Looking ahead, the Board is confident that ANT’s business
model is robust and we look forward to delivering another
successful year.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our
employees for their commitment and contribution to the
continued development of the business in the last year.

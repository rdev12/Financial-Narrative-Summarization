Dairy Crest has the leading 
cheese brand in the UK, Cathedral 
City, and a world-class cheese supply 
chain. Cathedral City is made at our 
Davidstow creamery in Cornwall from 
milk supplied by local dairy farmers. 
The cheese is matured, cut and 
wrapped at our purpose-built facility in 
n uneaton from where it is despatched 
to retailers. We also have a smaller 
cheese packing facility at Frome, 
Somerset which provides the business 
with additional flexibility. Whey, a 
by-product of cheese-making, is also 
produced at Davidstow and is currently 
dried and sold as whey powder.
We process and deliver fresh 
conventional, organic and flavoured 
milk to major retailers, ‘middle ground’ 
customers including smaller retailers, 
coffee shops and hospitals, and 
residential customers.
 We also manufacture and sell FRijj, 
the leading fresh flavoured milk brand, 
cream and milk powders.
Vision
Dairy Crest is the largest UK-owned dairy food company, processing 
and selling fresh milk and branded dairy products in the UK
•	
To build market-leading 
positions in branded and 
added value markets
•	
To focus on cost 
reduction and efficiency 
improvements
•	
To improve quality of 
earnings and reduce risk
•	
To generate organic 
growth and to make 
acquisitions and 
disposals where they 
will generate value
Strategy
•	
Cathedral City continues to grow market 
share and is now Britain’s 18th largest 
grocery brand (Source: The Grocer)
•	
Cathedral City brand extended outside of 
cheese for the first time with Baked Bites 
– Cathedral City biscuits
•	
On track to commence demineralised 
whey powder (a base ingredient for infant 
formula) production in 2015
•	
Increased profits from Dairies arising 
from strong property sales
•	
Cost savings delivered ahead of target
•	
FRijj capacity extended and new flavours 
and pack sizes successfully introduced
•	
In a difficult butter and spreads market 
Clover grew volume but lost a little market 
share, Country Life spreadable grew and 
outperformed the market but sales of 
Country Life block butter declined 
•	
The rationalisation of our spreads and butter 
manufacturing onto one well-invested site is 
nearing completion
•	
Frylight sales have grown strongly in the year

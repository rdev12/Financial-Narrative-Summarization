Trafficmaster made very good progress in 2004, increasing revenues by 19.7% to
£36.6 million and significantly increased pre-tax profits from £0.5 million to £4.8
million. This strong financial performance was spread across the group, with over
125,000 customers now subscribing to our broad range of telematics services.
Each of our four operating divisions made good progress during 2004 with the
group achieving significant new contracts during the year . Specifically, we have
important new deals with Honda Motor Europe Limited and Transport for London
(TFL) in our traffic division, standard fit deals with Mitsubishi and Peugeot for
Smartnav and two large National account deals for our USA fleet-tracking
business, Teletrac.
Trafficmaster’s key markets have developed well in 2004. In particular, the in-car
navigation market has accelerated its growth with various new products stimulating
the development of the market. We believe that the outlook looks encouraging as
both motorists and motor manufacturers seek to make satellite navigation systems
commonplace within the car . 
2005 has brought new challenges and new prospects, however, I believe the
existing management team is well positioned to exploit the opportunities now
emerging in the various business divisions.

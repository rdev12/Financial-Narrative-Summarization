 Abcam has made outstanding progress in  
the last financial year. Sales increased by  
60% to £ 9.4m (from £ 2. m in 2005) and 
profit before tax increased by 65% to £4.9m  
(from £3.0m in 2005). It is satisfying to see  
that operating profit at 23.7% of sales is  
only slightly below the 24.0% achieved in 
2005. This is despite the additional costs  
of being a publicly listed company and 
reflects the ability of the Company to scale  
its operations efficiently.
CEO’s Review
Cash balances and short term investments over the year rose 
by £10.4 million to £11.9 million. £9.3 million came from the net 
proceeds of the AiM listing in November 2005, but the business 
itself continues to be very cash generative.
Our 60% growth in sales has been driven in part by the number 
of products published on the website. This grew by 41%, up 
from 16,500 at the end of June 2005 to 23,200 at the end of 
June 2006.
Products that we have published tend to sell more per month or 
per year the longer they have been available. We are therefore 
continuing not only to publish more products but also to provide 
more information about the antibodies, so as to exploit this 
dynamic. Growth in sales has also been the result of better 
market penetration, brand recognition and improved distribution. 
The Company pays considerable attention to gross margins.  
A high priority is to increase significantly the number of products 
that are owned or exclusively distributed by Abcam in the 
medium term. Profitability is also affected by cost and we 
continue to strive for greater operational efficiency. 
Abcam is fortunate to have such enthusiastic, high-quality staff. 
Through our recruitment programme, we have attracted some 
very able and experienced individuals and we have 28 biochemist 
PhD staff, many with valuable years of post-doctoral research 
experience. We are committed to further enhancing the team 
through a new programme of staff training and development.

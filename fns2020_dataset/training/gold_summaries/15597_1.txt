8 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Chief Executive’s
review
business by 2050; to reduce the 
carbon impact of the products in our 
supply chain by 30% by 2020; and to 
help our customers halve their own 
carbon footprint by 2020. And we’re 
making good progress already.
We’re delivering for all stakeholders: 
an improved shopping trip for 
customers; training and good careers 
for our staff; growth and innovation 
with our suppliers; in local communities 
we’re supporting causes that matter 
to customers; and we’re delivering 
good returns to shareholders.
Looking forward
The outlook for shareholder returns 
is encouraging: we have a strong 
core UK business growing well; our 
international businesses offer significant 
upside from recovery in the short 
term and maturity in the longer term; 
our balance sheet is strengthening; 
and we’re creating value through 
good property development.
Our positions in high-growth 
international economies and non-food 
meant we were always likely to face 
strong headwinds during the recession 
but it will be these parts of our business 
which will grow fastest in the recovery 
and beyond.
I am confident that with the prospect 
of an improving global economy and 
recent investments in acquisitions and 
new selling space making a greater 
contribution going forward, returns 
will improve significantly – starting 
this year.
Sir Terry Leahy
Chief Executive
Each element of our strategy – UK, 
International, Non-food, Retailing 
Services and Community – is stronger 
now than this time last year. 
In International, our businesses have 
made good progress in a challenging 
global economic environment. Our 
strategy is working – we’ve grown 
sales, profits and market shares and 
we’ve continued to invest in the drivers 
of future growth. Our performance 
in Asia was particularly pleasing, 
our business in Europe held up 
well despite the obvious economic 
challenges and I believe the start-up 
losses in our US business will now 
begin to reduce as Fresh & Easy 
establishes itself.
Our UK business had a good year. 
By remaining focused on helping 
customers spend less and encouraging 
loyalty with an increased investment 
in Clubcard, our UK business has 
delivered a solid performance. In our 
core grocery operations, we’re growing 
ahead of the industry as a whole and 
we have been less affected by falling 
inflation than the market at large.
In Non-food we have made good 
progress. In the UK we achieved a 
particularly strong performance in 
electricals, entertainment and toys. 
Our clothing range is becoming an 
international success, led by our F&F 
range which is growing rapidly in our 
European markets and this year was 
launched in four countries in Asia. 
Our Retailing Services have grown 
sales and profits once again. We’ve 
also been building the platforms for 
future growth, particularly in Tesco 
Bank, which is making good progress 
in developing its own systems and 
people capabilities as well as working 
on a broader product range as it 
moves towards becoming a full-
service retail bank.
In the same way that we’ve stuck 
to our strategy in other parts of 
the business, we’ve also remained 
committed to our work on Community 
and the environment. In October, we 
set ourselves three challenging long-
term targets: to become a zero-carbon 
This year’s results show another 
solid performance from across 
the Group. By staying focused 
on doing the right thing for 
customers we have weathered 
the economic storm well. And by 
remaining committed to our long-
term strategy we are emerging 
from recession stronger – with 
good building blocks in place 
for future growth.

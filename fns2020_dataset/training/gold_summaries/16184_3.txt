During the year we increased progress on the 
delivery of our synergy target of £200m and 
delivered £75m of incremental benefit in the full 
year.  This has given us a total delivered benefit  
of £195m since the merger in September 2007.  
Progress on turning around some of our 
underperforming businesses in Mainstream is 
taking longer than originally anticipated but we 
remain confident that the drivers we have in place 
will deliver the targeted outcome.  Overall growth 
in our Specialist Sectors remains strong and our 
joint venture in Russia and Ukraine has performed 
in line with our expectations.
Results
The Group has achieved an 11% increase in 
underlying operating profit of £447m (2009 restated: 
£401m) on revenue of £13,525m (2009 restated: 
£13,851m).  Underlying profit before tax is up 4% to 
£337m (2009 restated: £324m).  Underlying earnings 
per share increased 10% to 22.0p (2009 restated: 
20.0p).  The Group statutory loss before taxation 
was £36m (2009 restated: £94m).
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend  
of 7.8p per share.  On 11 May 2010, the Board 
recommended an interim dividend of 3.2p per 
share, thereby resulting in a full year dividend of 
11.0p per share (2009: 10.7p).  The Group has a 
progressive dividend policy and will look to maintain 
underlying dividend cover at just over two times.
Board
Post year end, on 21 October 2010, the Group 
announced that Paul Bowtell, Chief Financial 
Officer will leave the Board on 31 December 2010.  
08 TUI Travel PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010
Strategic overview
Chairman’s statement
We have delivered results in line with our expectations after experiencing another year of challenges.  
Not least, the closure of much of Northern Europe’s airspace in April when the Icelandic volcano, 
located below the Eyjafjallajoekull Glacier, erupted and created an enormous ash cloud in the 
atmosphere.  This closure cost our Group £104m and affected some 400,000 of our customers.   
At a macro level, economic uncertainty and concern about how Governments are seeking to tackle 
deficits were also factors that we faced during the year.  
On 30 November 2010, the appointment of Will 
Waggott as Chief Financial Officer of the Group 
was announced with immediate effect.  Will is 
already a TUI Travel PLC Board member and was 
the Group’s Commercial Director.  
Sustainable development
For TUI Travel, sustainability is an important 
business issue and opportunity.  Our vision for 
sustainable development is to ‘make travel 
experiences special’ whilst minimising our 
environmental impact, respecting the culture  
and people in our destinations and offering real 
economic benefit to local communities.  As a 
leading tour operator, our challenge is to prepare 
for a low-carbon society by further reducing our 
environmental impacts and as a business we are 
monitoring and preparing for regulatory proposals 
on climate change that could have a fiscal impact 
on our Group.
Colleagues
As a Group we have circa 49,000 colleagues located 
across the world.  Their hard work and dedication  
is much appreciated and, this year, our value of 
‘customer obsessed’ was well and truly 
demonstrated by their actions throughout the 
closure of airspace in April.  We received many 
communications from our customers about their 
outstanding efforts and, on behalf of the Board,  
I would like to thank them for their valued 
contribution to making our customers’ holiday 
experiences special.

“ WITH OUR FIRST FRANCHISE 
ABOUT TO ENTER ITS  
SECOND SEASON, AND THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF OUR 
SECOND, PLANET COASTER, 
FRONTIER IS IN A VERY 
STRONG POSITION, AND  
VERY WELL PLACED FOR  
AN EXCITING FUTURE AND 
FURTHER REVENUE GROWTH.”
Just over half of our developers are 
working on Elite Dangerous, and the  
rest are now working on Planet Coaster. 
The second stage of our transition will  
be complete in late 2016 when Planet 
Coaster is planned to ship.
Sales of our first major franchise,  
Elite Dangerous, are tracking well. Sales 
figures of Elite Dangerous have already 
been made public over the year, and  
as of the end of August 2015 stood at 
approximately 825,000 unit sales. A 
summary of the cumulative paid-for units 
and the gross revenue each month up to 
the end of August 2015 are plotted below.
We are delighted to have returned to  
profit this early in our transition. We 
raised funds during the Kickstarter 
crowd-funding at pre-IPO and IPO in 
order to fund the transition but, with 
hindsight, the process has been more 
successful and more cash generative 
than anticipated.
We successfully launched Elite Dangerous 
via our own web-based store and have 
continued to support it with regular 
significant expansions. We reached new 
audiences for the game by supporting new 
distribution channels and platforms with 
Steam, Mac and Xbox One.
As we completed our obligations to third 
party publishers, the success of Elite 
Dangerous allowed us to start investing  
in a second self-published franchise in 
anticipation of higher future returns. 
Planet Coaster is a game in the ‘Tycoon’ 
genre; a teaser trailer was launched 
during the E3 trade show in June.  
Planet Coaster will launch in 2016 and  
will allow the Group to make use of its 
proven expertise in the ‘Tycoon’ genre,  
as Elite Dangerous has in its genre. 
The significantly higher net receipts from 
self-publishing Elite Dangerous compared 
to our previous work-for-hire business 
model enabled Frontier to more than 
double headline revenue for the year to 
£22.8 million, and the net cash balance 
increased by £2.1 million to £10.5 million 
at 31 May 2015. This allowed us to 
generate a pre tax profit of £1.6 million 
(EBITDA of £6.1 million) whilst still in  
a planned transition.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
STRATEGIC REPORT
08  FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Following the successful completion of the first stage of our transition the Board 
expects the Group to be well placed as it develops its IP into world class franchises. 
Frontier is on course to launch the Xbox One version of Elite Dangerous in September 
2015 and the follow up season of expansions, Elite Dangerous: Horizons, in the 
calendar Q4 of 2015. Elite Dangerous: Horizons is a season of major gameplay 
expansions for Elite Dangerous, beginning with Planetary Landings on 1:1 scale 
worlds across the Elite Dangerous galaxy. Elite Dangerous: Horizons will continue  
to introduce major new features and gameplay as the season continues into 2016, 
enriching the Elite Dangerous experience with new activities and new ways to play.
The Board expects further strong revenue growth in the current financial year.  
The timing of the release of Elite Dangerous: Horizons, expected to be around our 
half year end, will likely have a significant impact on the half-on-half phasing of  
the current year’s revenues. 
As planned, Frontier has started development on Planet Coaster, set for release  
in the calendar Q4 of 2016 as a second franchise.
The launch of Planet Coaster will represent the end of the next stage of our transition, 
delivering a fully self-published revenue pipeline that maximises returns from the 
use of our established expertise and pool of IP.
We will also continue to identify further franchises that would make full use of our 
established expertise and IP in order to further build our revenue pipeline for the 
longer term.
Up to 31 August 2015 the Group had sold approximately 825,000 units of Elite 
Dangerous. At the Gamescom show we announced Elite Dangerous: Horizons,  
a new paid-for season of expansions for the game, to a positive critical reception. 
Net cash balance at 31 August was approximately £10.7 million. An early video  
of Frontier’s second franchise Planet Coaster was shown for the first time at E3’s 
inaugural PC Gaming Show. The game is set to be publicly released in Q4 of 2016 
and is available now on a pre-order basis.
In addition to our major self-published 
franchises, we released a port of our 
classic PC game RollerCoaster Tycoon 3  
for iOS (Apple) devices on 13 August 2015.
Our work for external publishing partners 
in the financial year included Amazon 
Game Studios’ release of Tales from  
Deep Space for Kindle Fire devices, and 
subsequently on iOS. We also worked  
for Microsoft Game Studios on the 
release of Screamride for Xbox One, 
digitally available via Xbox Live in March.
Overall we have had a great year. This  
is down to the hard work of our staff,  
and the great support from our many  
fans around the world.

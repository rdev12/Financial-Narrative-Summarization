 24 DFS Annual report and accounts 2015
The Group delivered a good overall performance in FY15, 
outperforming furniture market growth rates, and achieving 
record sales and operating profits. Furthermore we  
have made continuing progress across all our strategic 
initiatives, giving me confidence that we will continue to 
deliver on our targets for growth. The dividend we have 
recommended is a clear expression of our belief that we 
are able to deliver both attractive earnings growth and 
cash returns for shareholders in future.
Chief Executive’s report
Ian Filby
Chief Executive Officer
Overview
I am pleased to report a further successful 
period of operational success and 
strategic progress. Leveraging the 
strength of our business model, we have 
successfully met our targets for near-term 
growth while maintaining very strong cash 
flows and also making the investments 
necessary to achieve long-term success.
The results for the last twelve months 
represent a record level of gross sales 
and adjusted EBITDA, and our cash 
conversion has remained outstanding. 
Reflecting this strong cash generation,  
we are pleased to be able to recommend 
payment of both an interim and final 
dividend, and can confirm that we have 
reduced our net debt below the level 
expected for year-end at the time of our 
IPO. We look forward to continuing to 
deliver both earnings growth and free 
cash flow for our shareholders.
Our strategic progress has also been 
exciting. Our branded ranges have 
continued to be positively received by 
consumers. We have been encouraged 
by our progress in the Netherlands and 
the positive results that we have seen to 
date from our small-store UK format.  
Our UK and ROI new store opening 
programme has continued to deliver 
incremental EBITDA, with six stores 
opened during the financial year, with 
each already now operationally profitable. 
We have also been able to continue to 
make more of our core store footprint 
through conversion of in-store 
warehouses into incremental retail space 
and establishing three further Customer 
Distribution Centres (‘CDCs’). We 
continue to see the benefits of our 
sector-leading investment in online,  
with exceptional growth in visitor traffic.

Growth strategy update
Broadening our appeal to customers
Our stated mission is “creating and 
making sofas that every home loves 
and can afford”. While we already have 
the leading competitive share in all 
consumer segments that we identify, 
our research suggests that we achieve 
different degrees of success in various 
consumer demographic segments.  
We have a clear focus on strengthening 
our share of the “aspirational 
consumer” segment of the furniture 
market, where we believe our 
handmade-to-order product and British 
manufacturing base should appeal 
strongly. To deliver on this strategy we 
are evolving aspects of our customer 
proposition, while seeking to maintain 
our core appeal to all customers. 
We have continued to develop our 
range of exclusive branded products, 
including new luxury leather ranges 
under the Iconica brand, and have 
started the sale of selected collections 
of sofas and sofabeds from Sofa 
Workshop and Dwell through our DFS 
stores and website. This is an exciting 
development alongside the growth of 
our Country Living, House Beautiful  
and French Connection brands. We 
have also continued to evolve our 
marketing approach, complementing 
our significant investment in advertising 
with an increased use of PR, direct 
marketing and sponsored advertising. 
Reflecting our continued progress  
and investment, orders for our  
Exclusive Branded ranges grew by 
75%. Furthermore, independent 
surveys conducted on our behalf 
suggest that we have now grown   Governance

our presence with the aspirational 
customer segment we are targeting 
from 18% to 23% (including Sofa 
Workshop and Dwell sales) and we 
continue to believe that we are on  
track to reach our 2018 target of  
25% segment share.
UK and ROI store roll-out
We have a strong track record of 
opening new DFS stores in the UK and 
ROI at a rate of three to five per annum, 
and this trend has continued over the 
last 12 months with five successful new 
openings of 10-15,000 sq. ft. stores. 
Using our established customer 
catchment area model, which leverages 
our comprehensive delivery postcode 
data, we are able to assess accurately 
the opportunity that exists for a new 
store and ensure that substantial 
incremental EBITDA is delivered. 
In order to establish how we can better 
access urban areas, we also opened a 
trial format 2,500 sq. ft. store in the 
Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, 
London in March 2015. Based on the 
success that we have seen to date we 
have taken the decision to open a 
further two trial small format stores.
Our Sofa Workshop business also 
opened standalone stores in Newbury 
and Westfield Stratford, and in August 
2015 opened shops in converted DFS 
warehouse space in Glasgow and 
Gateshead. Also in August 2015,  
Dwell opened stores in converted  
DFS warehouse space in Glasgow  
and New Malden.
International expansion
Building on the experience we gained  
in our successful entry into the Republic 
of Ireland, in November 2014 we 
opened our first trial store in Cruquius, 
near Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. 
This move has been challenging, 
requiring us to operate with a different 
local language and under a new 
regulatory regime, while simultaneously 
establishing and growing our brand 
awareness with consumers. We have 
been encouraged by our progress to 
date. Our strong product range, 
in-house manufacturing expertise and 
service culture has proved to appeal to 
Dutch consumers despite the challenge 
of adverse currency movements. On 
the back of the positive results that we 
have seen to date we have taken the 
decision to open two further stores 
during the current financial year, one of 
which opened in September 2015 in the 
Alexandrium shopping mall/retail park in 
Rotterdam (10,000 sq. ft).
As discussed in our July trading update, 
our investment in future growth in the 
Netherlands is expected to lead to an 
increase in operating costs net of 
incremental revenue of £2–3 million 
in FY16.
A somewhat different, but likewise 
potentially exciting growth initiative  
has also commenced in Spain. On 
1 October 2015 we acquired a locally 
well-regarded business, branded “DFS 
Spain”, which has served the expatriate 
community from a single c. 5,000 sq. ft. 
store on the south coast of Spain for 
over a decade. In addition to securing 
the registered DFS trademark in Spain, 
which will now allow us to target DFS 
advertising to the expatriate market in 
Spain, we will benefit from a physical 
showroom presence, giving customers 
a local point to experience our range 
and allowing us to benefit from 
increased logistical efficiencies in Spain. 
Although we have no plans at present 
to grow our Spain showroom base, we 
see this acquisition as a positive step to 
unlock the potential of our strong brand 
recognition and online web offer on dfs.
co.uk with up to 800,000 expatriates 
from the UK currently living in Spain.
Retail space conversion
During the year we continued to pursue 
our CDC conversion programme, 
converting in-store warehouses into 
additional retail space and consolidating 
those warehouse operations into larger 
purpose-built off-site facilities. In August 
2015 we opened our sixth CDC in 
Bristol, and we have now released 
approximately 70,000 square feet of 
retail space across 12 stores. We 
currently plan to use this released 
space to sell dining and bedroom 
furniture, where we have had proven 
success; and we are also trialling the 
use of the space alternatively for Sofa 
Workshop or Dwell shop within shops 
or an extended DFS upholstery range.
Online
Our website dfs.co.uk maintained its 
sector leading presence, continuing to 
attract over 40% of upholstery sector 
web traffic over the course of the year. 
We have seen continued double-digit 
growth in online sales with the 
proportion of Group orders placed 
contributing materially to our sales. 26 DFS Annual report and accounts 2015

Strategic report Financial statements
During the year we have also sought  
to increase the integration of our  
online technology with our store  
estate. We rolled out our online store 
appointment booking service nationwide, 
and are trialling the display of “virtual 
reality” representations of customer 
orders on in-store display screens. 
We have also launched the DFS Live 
app, allowing our customers to 
interact from their home using video 
functionality with our Live Chat team. 
Our online advisers are available 24x7 
and our customers now have the 
choice to interact using either in-store, 
video or telephone channels.
Customer service
We continue to strive to deliver the 
highest standards of customer service. 
Our approach relies both on proactive 
training and Net Promoter Score 
(“NPS”) linked incentivisation of our 
employees, combined with a feedback 
system that allows us accurately to 
measure and track the satisfaction of 
customers throughout their purchase 
down to the product, store, factory  
and employee level.
During the last 12 months we revised 
the pay structure for all sales teams to 
increase the importance of customer 
satisfaction scores. We have also 
commenced an incremental training 
programme to ensure all our front-line 
customer-facing colleagues possess 
at least a level 2 customer service 
NVQ award.
I am grateful for the positive way in 
which all our people have taken on, 
owned and driven forward our 
customer service approach over recent 
years and I would like to express my 
thanks for their efforts. 
Reflecting our service approach  
I am pleased to report that our  
post-purchase NPS is now over 80%. 
Because of this success in achieving 
exceptional rates of post-purchase 
customer satisfaction, we will broaden 
our focus to emphasise established 
customer satisfaction – the willingness 
of customers that purchased our 
products six months previously to 
recommend our products to their 
friends or family.
Management
I would like to thank Jon Massey for  
his distinguished service to the Group 
over the last 27 years. Jon informed  
the Group that he wished to retire from 
full-time executive employment and 
therefore it has been agreed with our 
IPO joint global coordinators that he will 
be released with immediate effect from 
the lock-up arrangements that currently 
apply to our senior managers.
I would also like to welcome Nick 
Collard to DFS, who has been 
appointed to the new role of Chief 
Commercial Officer as part of our 
executive committee. Nick has 
extensive retail knowledge and 
expertise from a distinguished career 
with Morrisons and Boots. He will 
strengthen the senior management 
team, focusing on product and range 
management and further enhancing  
our growth initiatives.
Corporate responsibility
At DFS we continue to work hard to put 
corporate responsibility at the heart of 
everything we do. The Group formulated 
an Energy Management Policy to support 
the reduction of our energy use, and we 
have continued to reduce vehicle 
emissions from our company car fleet, 
despite increases in store numbers and 
headcount. We also maintained our focus 
on the efficiency of our delivery fleet,  
and made further progress in working 
towards our long term goal of sending 
zero waste to landfill.
In the community, we have continued 
our partnership with the British Heart 
Foundation both in fundraising through 
the successful sofa recycling scheme 
and by training new and existing 
employees in CPR skills and defibrillator 
awareness. We also continued our 
support for BBC Children in Need for 
the second year.
Team GB partnership
We were delighted to announce in 
December that DFS was Team GB’s 
chosen official homeware partner for 
the Rio 2016 Olympic games. While we 
are of course proud to support our 
nation’s athletes as they seek to build 
on the success they saw in London 
2012, we believe that we will derive  
real operational benefits from this 
investment. First, we see significant 
potential to promote our brand with 
consumers, leveraging the strong 
consumer appeal of Team GB. 
Secondly, we are fortunate to be able 
to work with a number of athletes and 
Team GB ambassadors to develop our 
organisation operationally, using their 
marginal gains philosophy and also 
their one team approach to improve 
our employee engagement levels. 
We are excited at the potential that  
the partnership offers and how strongly 
it fits with a number of the strategic 
growth initiatives that we are pursuing.
Outlook
We have been reassured to see positive 
trends in UK disposable income and 
consumer confidence continuing, and  
we expect this to provide a supportive 
market environment for the furniture 
sector over the coming months. 
We further believe that the Group 
is well-positioned relative to its 
competitors and we thus have 
confidence that the business is in a 
strong position to sustain its track record 
of gross sales growth and furniture 
market share capture in 2015/16, albeit 
our performance will now be measured 
against the strong comparators of the 
financial year under review.
Overall the business enjoys excellent 
prospects to deliver long-term profitable 
growth, strong cash generation and a 
progressive dividend policy as one of 
the UK’s best-known brands, a major 
British manufacturer and the country’s 
leading retailer of upholstered furniture.

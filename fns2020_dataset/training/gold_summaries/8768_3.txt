 Jessops plc Report & Accounts 2006
03
I am pleased to report that
Jessops has responded well
to the challenges facing all
retailers in 2006. Consumer
spending, and our markets
in particular, remained
volatile throughout the 
year, yet despite this we
have delivered results in 
line with expectations.
This achievement
demonstrates the positive
way colleagues in our stores
and at our head office have
responded to these testing
trading conditions. The 
team has focused on 
driving through margin
improvements, capitalising
on Jessops’ unique market
position and strong supplier
relationships. On behalf of
the Board and shareholders,
I thank them all for their
continued commitment 
and professionalism.
Sales in 2006 were 6.9% ahead of
the previous year at £350 million and
operating profit increased 12.3% to
£20.0 million, a creditable performance
given the volatile retail climate in 2006.
The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 1.50p per share, representing
a total of 2.25p for the year, an increase
of 7.1%. If approved, the dividend
will be paid on 9 February 2007 to
shareholders on the register on 12
January 2007.
The year also saw the orderly transition
of the executive management from the
team that had brought the company
from private to public ownership. Chris
Langley, our Chief Operating Officer
since February 2005 succeeded Derek
Hine as Chief Executive in May this year.
The Board was further strengthened
in July with the appointment of Robin
Whitbread as Commercial Director.
Robin, formerly a Non-executive
Director, assumed responsibility for
the day to day commercial operations,
including stores, buying, marketing
and developing and printing (D&P). 
Following Robin’s appointment as an
Executive Director, the Board will appoint
another Non-executive Director in the
near term. Ian Harris, formerly Finance
Director of the RAC and Welcome
Break, succeeds John Crabtree as
Group Finance Director with effect
from 30 November. 
Despite the considerable volatility 
in sales over the past year, decisive
action has helped us achieve our
goals in 2006. As we head towards
2007, due to the recent softness we
are experiencing, we remain cautious
about the near term outlook for our
markets. We have a strong team in
place and are determined to seize 
the opportunities that are open to us.

BUSINESS PROGRESS
I am pleased to report that 
despite challenging trading 
conditions the Group 
delivered an excellent set of 
results whilst making strong 
progress in terms of 
operational, financial, and 
strategic developments. 
This performance resulted in 
a 5.6% increase in revenue 
to £28.53m for the year to 
30 June 2015 (2014: 
£27.02m) with the UK and 
European revenues 
increasing by 49.2%; a 5.7% 
increase in EBITDA to 
£9.53m (2014: £9.02m); a 
10.5% increase in profit 
before tax to £5.94m (2014: 
£5.38m); and a 18.8% 
increase in profit after tax 
to £5.43m (2014: £4.57m) 
helped by a lower effective 
tax rate, delivering a 17.5% 
increase in basic earnings 
per share of 6.40p (2014: 
5.44p). Such key financial 
performance indicators are 
of course only part of the 
progress made during the 
financial year and I am also 
delighted to say that this 
period and post period end 
were the most active since 
we were admitted to the 
London AIM market, and 
have laid firm foundations 
for our future expansion 
both geographically and in 
terms of new product 
development. It is clear to 
me that industry interest in 
our proprietary POS-GRIP 
friction-grip method of 
engineering is increasing in 
tangible ways beyond our 
traditional organic jack-up 
exploration rental wellhead 
business. Examples of such 
exciting initiatives which I 
will expand on include BG 
joining our Python subsea 
wellhead JIP; first contract 
for our new POS-SET 
Connector product to 
facilitate decommissioning 
and abandonment; securing 
of a major licensee in China 
(Jereh); a collaboration with 
COSL for the development 
and supply of a shallow 
subsea wellhead for China; 
the securing of a Petronas 
licence to enable the supply 
of equipment in Malaysia; 
entering into a collaboration 
with Aquaterra for the 
supply of HP/HT marine 
risers; and importantly the 
official launch of our new 
Python subsea wellhead at 
OE2015 last month in 
Aberdeen.
OVERVIEW
The 2015 financial year 
has seen Plexus achieve a 
number of significant 
milestones, not least, in 
terms of establishing 
strategic partnerships and 
investing time and resources 
into research and 
development for new 
product innovation, which 
we believe will help us 
further cement our position 
as the best in class supplier 
of wellhead equipment to 
the oil and gas industry, not 
just for jack-up exploration 
but  also in due course for 
surface production and

subsea. This progress 
however cannot be 
considered in isolation, and 
it is important to note that 
the various macro and 
geopolitical negatives that 
we identified this time last 
year persist, not only in 
terms of the much reduced 
oil price but also in terms of 
reduced operators capex 
spend and consumer demand 
levels.
Since our admission to AIM 
at the end of 2005, Plexus 
has grown in terms of 
revenues and profitability 
through our POS-GRIP 
surface exploration jack-up 
wellhead rental business 
model. This growth has been 
supported by necessary on-
going investment in R&D, 
personnel, rental wellhead 
inventory, and infrastructure 
both in the UK and 
increasingly worldwide 
where we are looking to 
grow sales beyond our 
traditional North Sea 
market. Our surface 
exploration offshore 
wellhead customer base 
continues to grow, and 
includes many of the world’s 
largest global oil and gas 
companies to which we 
added new customers Total 
and Cardon IV (a 50:50 JV 
between Repsol and eni) 
during the year. Of these oil 
and gas companies we have 
serviced over 400 wells 
globally offering our 
customers standard pressure 
wellheads and HP/HT 
wellheads, and we estimate 
that we hold a c.10% market 
share of the c.USD$400m 
global jack-up exploration 
market, as compared to the 
vast majority of the markets 
in the North Sea which 
underlines the significant 
growth opportunity within 
this arena. Our recognition 
of the importance of 
investment, and in particular 
R&D, and the willingness to 
commit to it clearly 
demonstrates our confidence 
in the superior nature of our 
POS-GRIP technology and its 
ability to become a new 
global standard.
In terms of rental sales and 
revenues for the financial 
year, we have been focussed 
on expanding beyond our 
traditional UK North Sea 
market, winning more 
contracts in Europe and 
pursuing new business 
opportunities in Africa, 
Australia, North America and 
Asia. Our sales mix 
illustrates the continued 
importance of both the UKCS 
and the European 
Continental Shelf (‘ECS’) in 
the North Sea where sales to 
offshore Norway, the 
Netherlands and Denmark 
were particularly strong and 
increased by 53.1%, 89.3% 
and 1,217% respectively 
compared to the same period 
in the prior year. We believe 
that the tax structures for 
example in Norway 
encourage exploration 
drilling as a result of 
allowances available where 
‘dry’ wells are concerned. 
With Brent Crude trading at 
circa USD$50 per barrel , 
following publication of the 
Wood Review, we hope that 
the latest tax incentive 
changes in the UKCS, as 
announced in the UK 
Government’s 2015 Budget 
which outlined measures 
worth £1.3bn over five years 
aimed at boosting flagging 
North Sea oil production by 
15% by the end of the 
decade, will have a similar 
positive impact which Plexus 
will benefit from. HP/HT 
equipment revenues 
continued to account for 
over 85% of all sales and, as 
such field conditions are the 
most technically challenging,

demonstrates the technical 
advantages offered by our 
proprietary POS-GRIP 
friction-grip method of 
engineering and wellhead 
equipment design.
As well as the significant 
contract wins for our POS-
GRIP surface exploration 
jack-up over the period, the 
two other areas where we 
have invested significant 
time and resources over the 
past year is our continued 
expansion into Asia, and on-
going product innovation 
which saw us enter a new 
lucrative market 
post period end 
following the 
launch of our 
uniquely superior 
Python Subsea 
Wellhead which 
addresses a 
number of issues 
identified following 
the Gulf of Mexico 
incident in 2010. 
Our Asian 
expansion has 
been demonstrated 
over three 
significant news events 
which have been explained 
by our CEO Ben Van 
Bilderbeek in his CEO 
commentary. Most notably 
was the post period end 
signing of our first licencing 
agreement with a major 
Chinese oil and gas field 
services company Jereh in 
July 2015. Licencing has 
been central to Plexus’ 
growth strategy as a way to 
penetrate the global market 
whist maintaining our best in 
class service, brand 
reputation and indeed strong 
patent protection where we 
have a growing patent suite 
in place to protect our POS-
GRIP friction-grip 
technology.
Plexus and Jereh, a world-
class supplier of oil and gas 
field equipment and services 
with a market cap of c.
USD$4bn, operating in more 
than 60 countries, share the 
ambition of delivering oil 
and gas drilling equipment 
and services, which are best 
in class in terms of safety, 
performance and reliability. 
By incorporating our 
patented POS-GRIP 
technology, the licencing 
agreement will push the 
boundaries in terms of 
wellhead performance and 
safety standards to facilitate 
the rental, sale, and 
manufacture of Plexus’ 
wellhead equipment into the 
major Chinese, wider Asian, 
Brazilian, Indian and Middle 
Eastern oil and gas markets. 
This relationship will be 
focused not just on rental 
wellhead exploration 
activities, but also on surface 
production and shallow 
water subsea, and 
connectors. In terms of 
positive market growth 
opportunities, according to 
Infield, the energy analysts, 
China and wider Asia is in 
the process of implementing 
the largest regional offshore 
capital expenditure 
programme for oil and gas 
activities which, from 2012 
to 2018, has been estimated 
to amount to USD$146bn. 
Indeed not so long ago 
Infield indicated that 
operations in Asia are 
increasingly moving 
exploration and production 
into deeper waters in a bid 
to boost oil and gas 
production, and that as a 
result Malaysia, Indonesia, 
India, and China are 
becoming major subsea 
industry hotspots attracting 
a range of operators from 
national oil companies such 
as CNOOC and ONGC, to 
international oil 
companies such as 
Shell and Chevron. 
As such whilst we 
will continue to 
expand our global 
presence we believe 
this licence 
agreement can over 
time generate 
substantial revenues 
from the partnership 
with Jereh, who 
have an exceptional 
track record as 
licensees for major 
partners around the world.
In line with our Asian 
expansion we were also 
delighted to report the 
formation of a new Malaysian 
company PPA in conjunction 
with a local Malaysian oil 
and gas partner, IPS. PPA 
was formed to create a fully 
operational Plexus Asian 
business hub with the aim of 
supplying POS-GRIP 
wellhead equipment and 
services to the Australian, 
Brunei, Indonesian, 
Malaysian, Thai, and 
Singaporean oil and gas 
exploration and production 
markets. This was signed in 
August 2014 and as further 
progress have since been

granted a local Petronas 
licence post period end to 
manufacture and supply 
Plexus’ POS-GRIP wellhead 
equipment. The securing of 
such a licence has been 
viewed as a major milestone 
for our company and we 
believe this will position us 
well to secure additional 
business and contract wins 
in this region.
In addition to our 
international expansion 
plans a defining moment of 
Plexus’ year was the launch 
of the Python Subsea 
Wellhead during Europe’s 
biggest Oil and Gas trade 
show, OE2015, in September 
2015. The Python launch 
was attended by Fergus 
Ewing, the Scottish Minister 
for Business, Energy and 
Tourism where he stated, 
 “this new technology will 
allow oil and gas companies 
around the world to increase 
the safety and reliability of 
their operations and it is a 
great testament to the skills 
and knowledge of Ben Van 
Bilderbeek and his team ”. 
The Python Subsea launch 
had been supported by 
Plexus’ joint industry 
partners which include BG, 
eni, Maersk, Royal Dutch 
Shell, Total, Wintershall, 
Senergy and Tullow Oil. 
Interestingly it was the 
industry that came to Plexus 
post the 2010 Macondo 
disaster to ask us to help 
design a safer, new best in 
class standard for subsea 
wellheads. The patented 
POS-GRIP friction-grip 
method of engineering 
offers ‘instant casing hanger 
lockdown’ and is used to 
secure hangers with HG 
Seals which provide direct, 
metal-to-metal, weld-
quality, high integrity 
sealing. Many components 
used in competing 
conventional subsea 
wellhead designs such as 
lock rings and wear bushings 
are eliminated, resulting in 
enhanced reliability and 
fewer installation trips to 
the sea bed by seven to ten 
trips on a complex well 
which will likely save 
operators using the Python 
Subsea wellhead between 
USD$2-10m per wellhead. 
Python’s formal launch 
marked the first commercial 
availability of our POS-GRIP 
enabled subsea wellhead 
system, and Plexus is

confident that Python will be 
ready for offshore prototype 
deployment in a trial well 
during 2016, where the next 
steps will be finding an 
operator to secure this first 
deployment.
Further to the launch of our 
Python Subsea Wellhead and 
expansion into new target 
markets, we have also been 
working on the extension of 
POS-GRIP friction technology 
and other new product areas. 
These products include: a 
low cost wellhead system for 
the volume production 
market - WellTree™ which we 
are currently working on with 
Jereh; this is in addition to 
products such as the HP/HT 
Tie-Back connector where we 
previously signed a joint 
industry project with Maersk, 
which for the first time allows 
the reconnection of 
production casing to HP/HT 
exploration and production 
wells which is now being 
marketed; the new POS-SET 
Connector which is designed 
to enable operators to re-
establish a connection onto 
rough conductor casing for 
the abandonment market, 
where the market for 
permanent plugging and 
abandonment of wells is 
increasing in the North Sea 
and beyond and could be an 
important new revenue 
stream for the Company; and 
the recent agreement with 
Aquaterra to jointly supply 
HP/HT dual barrier marine 
risers utilising Plexus’ POS-
GRIP technology to provide a 
safer, technically superior 
and cost efficient solution for 
the use on jack-up rigs. All of 
these product innovations 
are in line with Plexus’ 
strategy to extend our POS-
GRIP product reach into new 
and commercially attractive 
markets. 
In tandem with securing 
strategic partnerships for 
future international growth 
and new product 
development, the continuing 
communication of our unique 
offering is equally as 
important to Plexus’ future 
success. The Board, 
management team and 
dedicated engineers invest 
significant time into 
communicating and educatin g 
the wider oil and gas industry. 
Such activities included 
attending and presenting at 
the ‘World Oil HP/HT Drilling 
and Completions Conference’ 
in Houston, Texas, and in 
London at the ‘Oil and Gas iQ 
“HP/HT Wells Summit 2014 
and 2015’, as well as 
important events such as the 
St Petersburg International 
Economic Forum in June, and 
the Beijing China 
International Offshore Oil & 
Gas Exhibition in March.

On behalf of the Board, I 
would like to thank all our

delivered another set of 
record financial results, but 
has importantly taken us into 
the subsea market with the 
launch of our new Python 
subsea wellhead at OE2015 
in September 2015, and will 
in the near future accelerate 
our goal of also becoming a 
major supplier to the surface 
production wellhead market.

Case Study
MOVING INTO 
SUBSEA
In September 2015, we 
launched our simple 
and technologically 
superior POS-GRIP 
Python Subsea 
Wellhead.  The 
patented technology 
was engineered to 
achieve best in class 
and safest standard 
for subsea wellheads 
with features 
that also reduce 
costs and deliver 
operational efficiency 
for operators.  The 
patented technology 
was in development 
for four years prior to 
its launch, in response 
to the Gulf of Mexico 
incident that occurred 
in 2011 and developed 
as a joint industry 
project supported 
by international oil 
majors including BG, 
eni, Maersk, Oil States 
Industries, Royal 
Dutch Shell, Senergy, 
TOTAL, Tullow Oil 
and Wintershall and 
Plexus anticipates 
that Python will be 
ready for offshore 
deployment in a trial 
well during the second 
half of calendar year 
2016.

globally recognised OPITO 
approval for our Competency 
Management System (‘CMS’) 
known as Competency@
Plexus. This is a qualification 
that our customers request 
during the tender and 
contract review process, 
especially in response to the 
findings from the Deepwater 
Horizon incident in 2010. 
Furthermore in September 
2014 I was delighted to see 
that our team’s efforts led 
to Plexus winning the 
“Commitment to Innovative 
Use of Research and 
Development” award at the 
Northern Star Business 
Awards 2014. Such work 
underpins the on-going 
development and application 
of our proprietary friction-
grip method of engineering. 
I would also like to welcome 
as a non-executive director 
Charles Jones who joined 
the Board in September 
2014 and who will be 
advising Plexus in respect of 
interacting with US oil and 
gas operators and service 
companies, industry bodies, 
and regulators, particularly 
in relation to the subsea 
arena.
OUTLOOK
I remain confident about 
the major growth 
opportunities available to 
Plexus and our on-going 
ability to market our 
proprietary POS-GRIP based 
wellhead equipment as a 
new and superior standard 
for the industry. We are in 
no doubt that we can 
ultimately penetrate all 
wellhead markets from 
surface to subsea, both 
organically and in 
conjunction with partners 
and licensees around the 
world. Notwithstanding our 
year on year growth and 
indeed record FY 2015 
financial results, FY 2016 
trading conditions are more 
challenging given the 
significant reduction in the 
oil price and related on-
going economic pressures 
which surround the oil and 
gas industry and the support 
services underpinning it, 
and this cannot be ignored. 
This is especially the case in 
the UK North Sea which 
traditionally has been an 
important market for us, 
and as recently as September 
2015 Oil and Gas UK 
reported that “exploration 
for new resources has fallen 
to its lowest level since the 
1970s” and that capital 
expenditure will probably 
decline by £2bn to £4bn 
annually to 2017. Looking 
forwards, the UK North Sea 
should not be written off 
just yet. Last year’s Wood 
Review of the North Sea 
estimated that there were 
still between 12bn and 24bn 
barrels of oil that could still 
be pumped in UK territorial 
waters compared to 45bn

barrels of crude extracted to 
date – logic dictates there is 
much drilling activity to 
come.
More encouragingly in recent 
weeks there has been a 
more positive sentiment with 
regards to oil price forecasts 
from a number of sources 
including UBS Wealth 
Management and Barclays. 
Only this month a Barclays 
analyst report argued that 
with prices at their current 
historic low levels, energy 
companies will not be 
sufficiently encouraged to 
continue to produce oil, and 
with “capex expected to fall 
20% globally in 2015 and a 
further 5-10% in 2016, the 
stage is set for a supply 
crunch”, meaning that after 
“some excess stocks are 
used up in 2016 and 2017, 
we believe the price 
appreciation seen thereafter 
is likely to be permanent”. 
Such sentiment is further 
endorsed by the industry 
itself, with Shell CEO Ben 
van Beurden declaring 
recently that the world faces 
an energy crisis unless 
investment in fossil fuels 
production is maintained 
because of the dramatic 
increase in demand that will 
come from 3bn people 
emerging from poverty over 
the next few decades.

Speaking to shareholders in 
The Hague Mr van Beurden 
said we “will need sustained 
and substantial (oil) 
investment to support 
economic growth” and that 
the world could face a 
catastrophic 70m barrel per 
day shortfall in crude by 
2040. According to the 
International Energy Agency 
who said global energy 
demand will increase by 
40% through to 2040, and 
an influential Exxon report 
further estimates that world 
population will increase 
by  30% from 2010 to 
2040, with global GDP rising 
by circa 140%. The 
achievement of higher oil 
prices, alongside our 
international growth and 
new product development 
strategies would certainly 
be favourable in terms of 
the growth outlook for 
Plexus, and indeed the wider 
oil and gas sector as a whole 
as exploration drilling 
activity would inevitably 
increase.
Our vision is to become a 
leading international oil and 
gas wellhead and related 
equipment engineering 
company, supplying the best 
in class and safest POS-
GRIP wellhead equipment 
for exploration, production 
and subsea applications 
around the world. In a 
global market dominated by 
a few large multi-national 
oil service and wellhead 
supply companies, Plexus 
reputation is growing, and 
the awareness of our ability 
to meet the demand for and 
provide critical innovative 
solutions required from 
wellhead technology, 
particularly for HP/HT 
applications is evidenced by 
a number of important 
collaborations that we 
entered into over the last 
twelve months. As extracting 
hard-to-reach oil and gas 
goes deeper and becomes 
more complex, innovative,

safe and effective wellhead 
technology is ever more 
important, and indeed 
essential, particularly for 
locations such as the Arctic 
where safety is paramount, 
and where wellheads cannot 
afford to be the weak link in 
the system.
With this vision in mind, the 
expansion of the organic 
jack-up rental business is 
now being focused on Asia, 
Russia and potentially North 
America, including fostering 
licensing agreements with 
the likes of Jereh. Whilst 
our rental sales showed an 
increase during the last 
financial year in terms of 
European and Asian sales, 
our next areas of geographic 
focus will be Russia and the 
CIS countries where I 
believe significant 
opportunities exist for 
Plexus’ equipment and 
technology, particularly in 
the Arctic where the 
selection of new, enabling 
and safer technology will be 
paramount. The scale of the 
Arctic opportunity is 
enormous, and this was 
clear to see from a recent 
report for the Secretary of 
Energy in Washington by the 
US National Petroleum 
Council in March 2015 titled 
“Arctic Potential – Realizing 
the Promise of U.S. Arctic 
Oil and Gas Resources” 
which highlighted two 
important statistics. Firstly 
that most of the Arctic 
offshore oil and gas 
potential lies in water 
depths of less than 100 
metres, and that the Russian 
Arctic shelf is even 
shallower. Secondly, that 
when analysing the global 
arctic conventional oil and 
gas resource potential by 
country in terms of “billion 
barrels of oil  equivalent”, 
Russia towers above the 
other major players. In 
terms of ranked estimated 
billions of barrels Russia 
was estimated at a massive 
287, USA 94, Greenland 39, 
Canada 34, and Norway 25. 
I believe the opportunity is 
additionally compelling 
given the high profile import 
replacement programme 
that is currently underway 
in Russia, and where last 
November Vladimir Markov, 
the head of gas giant 
Gazprom was quoted as 
saying that within the next 
two to three years “we can 
substitute up to 90% of all 
imports, considering the 
government has begun 
developing production of its 
own complex equipment”.
In addition to setting our 
sights on Asian, Russian and 
CIS expansion in the near-
term, we are also looking to 
the North American and 
GOM markets as part of our 
longer-term strategy for 
growth across exploration, 
production and subsea. This 
longer-term strategy will be 
boosted by our active 
presence in Houston where 
we have appointed a new 
USA non-executive director 
to the Board, Charles Jones, 
who has over 30 years of 
senior management and

energy sector, and have also 
recently engaged the 
services of Mr Lawrence 
Rucinski, who previously 
held the position of Director, 
Sales and Marketing for the 
Global Subsea business of 
FMC Technologies Inc., and 
will actively promote our 
technology to American 
operators. Both Charles and 
Lawrence will be advising 
and assisting the Plexus 
team in relation to potential 
US commercial and licencing 
partners.
As well as expanding Plexus 
through new regional 
opportunities, as already 
stated new product 
innovation is just as central 
to our growth strategy. We 
therefore look forward to 
updating shareholders on 
these new product 
developments and marketing 
initiatives which include the 
launch of the new and 
superior Python subsea 
wellhead; our surface 
production wellhead 
WellTree; HP/HT Tie-Back 
JIP connector; and the new 
POS-SET Connector. To 
support such future 
initiatives, and as an 
indication of our confidence 
in the future we doubled the 
size of our Aberdeen 
operational headquarters 
with the acquisition in 
September 2014 of a circa 
36,000 sq.ft work shop and 
facility from Baker Hughes 
for £2.4m.
For the reasons outlined in 
my statement, despite 
widely reported on-going 
challenges for the industry I 
am confident of Plexus’ long 
term future prospects and 
our ability to deliver 
significant shareholder 
value from our patented 
POS-GRIP technology. I 
would like to extend my 
gratitude to my fellow Board 
members, Plexus 
management team, office 
support and our excellent 
engineers, without whom, 
our significant progress to 
date would not be possible.

“At the surface and subsea, POS-GRIP

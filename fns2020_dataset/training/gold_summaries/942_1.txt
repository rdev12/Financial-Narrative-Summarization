 Chief Executive’s
Statement
Page 10 ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The year ended 30 April 2008 has been a year of successful restructuring
for ANGLE and we have established a strong platform for the future.
Costs have been reduced, revenues increased and a tight focus
maintained on the existing portfolio. Taking these actions has placed the
Company in a better position to weather the increasingly tight financial
markets and to successfully achieve our aim of delivering shareholder
value from our combined revenue and capital based business model. 
Both the Management services business and the Investment Portfolio
have moved into profit during the year with the result that the Group
generated a profit before controlled investments and tax of £3.4 million.
This compares to a £6.1 million loss in the year ended 30 April 2007.
During the year, controlled investments into majority owned portfolio
companies amounted to £2.3 million (2007: £3.1 million). After these
investments, which are expensed, profit before tax was £1.1 million,
compared to a loss of £9.3 million in the previous financial year.
Reflecting the maturing portfolio, the level of ongoing expenditure on
controlled investments is now substantially reduced.
Cash generated by the business in the second half of the year met all
the operating costs and investment in the portfolio during that period. 
As a result the cash balance at 30 April 2008 of £1.0 million was materially
unchanged from the cash balance at 31 October 2007 of £1.1 million. ANGLE’s Management services business is a key feature of the
Company’s business model. Its value to ANGLE goes beyond 
its financial contribution to the business.
Management services
ANGLE’s Management services business is a key feature of the
Company’s business model. Its value to ANGLE goes beyond its financial
contribution to the business. The division also provides the Company with
a high quality pool of in-house expertise and talent as well as access to
leading academic, research and science organisations internationally,
raising the profile of the whole Group and providing access to high
quality IP commercialisation opportunities.
The three key aims for this division during the year were to:
� generate a profit and strong cashflow; 
� focus on larger, longer term contracts with a high degree of financial 
visibility; and 
� increase the overall number of contracts.
I am very pleased to report that in the last twelve months the
Management services business has achieved all three of these aims.
Financial performance was strong with turnover rising 14% to £3.8 million
(2007: £3.4 million). As importantly, the quality of earnings from this
business materially improved leading to profit for the year from the
Management services division of £1.1 million (2007: loss £0.4 million).
During the year ANGLE continued to win new management services
contracts. These included significant wins with Innovation Lincolnshire, 
a contract worth £0.9 million over 21 months and with the London
Development Agency’s (LDA) Knowledge Connect Programme now,
subject to contract, increased in value from £3.7 million to £5.4 million
over three years. 
In addition to new UK contracts, the pipeline of potential opportunities
includes further major contracts in the Middle East. As at 30 April 2008,
ANGLE’s sold order book for the next three years (including the expected
LDA extension) was £8.2 million (2007: £5.1 million) and the management
remains extremely active in implementing initiatives to extend this order
book further. 
The improvement in ANGLE’s profile in the market and the increasing
recognition of the added value that the Management services business
delivers is demonstrated in the order book itself. In the last four years the
scale of individual contracts has grown five-fold, with the average value
size per contract now being in excess of £450,000 per annum. Accessing
larger and more significant contracts not only improves profitability but
also enables management time to be used more effectively. 
ANGLE’s reputation in the industry as a high quality provider of
management services is growing. Even discounting the important
benefits that are generated for the venture portfolio, the Board believes
that as a stand alone business the Management services division is an
important and valuable business in its own right. Further, in more
challenging economic conditions, this division provides ANGLE with a
core strength and robustness not seen elsewhere in the IP
commercialisation space. 
Investment Portfolio
In the last twelve months ANGLE has continued to manage its portfolio of
investment companies effectively. The benefits of this focused approach
are also being seen in both the operational and financial performance
of this division. 
A coherent strategy has been deployed across the portfolio with the
intention of maximising ANGLE’s investment return, whilst controlling the
investment risk and cash requirements of the individual companies.
Where additional capital has been required to continue the
development of high quality IP commercialisation opportunities, this has
been made available. We have also continued to work closely with each
of the underlying investment portfolio companies providing expertise
and management support as required. 
A key feature of ANGLE’s portfolio, and indeed a key differentiator for the
business model, is that ANGLE looks to maintain significant stakes in each
portfolio company. This ensures that ANGLE retains a high level of
influence on the development of each opportunity. This is becoming
increasingly important as our portfolio of companies reaches maturity
and exit strategies are being developed. Many of our companies have
developed well beyond the start up phase, with our average portfolio
company now having been in existence for over four years.
As with the Management services division, ANGLE’s strategy for its
investment portfolio is being reflected in strong financial performance.
During the year, a fair value gain in the portfolio was achieved of £3.9
million (2007: loss £2.0 million) and the fair value of the portfolio on the
Balance Sheet doubled to £7.3 million (30 April 2007 £3.7 million). 
It is important to highlight that this Balance Sheet figure does not include
the fair value of the Company’s controlled investments, which to date
have received direct investment of £3.7 million from ANGLE.
During the year, cash of £0.5 million was realised from mature investments
(2007: £1.1 million).

Portfolio progress highlights 
ANGLE’s investment portfolio now contains ten companies. Whilst
progress continues to be made across the portfolio, the most significant
developments during the year have occurred in three of our “High
Potential Return” investments. 
1 Aguru Images
Rapid capture & recreation of photo-realistic images – 75% holding
The company has completed both its product development and also
the successful first commercial sale to a major film maker in Los Angeles.
The contract utilised Aguru’s proprietary devices to measure faces,
materials and objects for visual effects shots on a major feature film. 
Aguru’s advanced capture technologies reduce the time, cost and
complexity of pre-production, production and post-production rendering
for simulations and interactive computer graphics. Aguru has exclusive
rights to highly innovative technologies developed at the University of
Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies and New York
University’s Courant Institute as well as other rights. The company’s target
markets include visual effects in motion pictures, computer and video
games, animation, and design – for improved renderings by interior,
fashion, architectural and industrial designers.
Aguru is building the world’s largest online library of stock shapes and
textures, comparable to photographic image libraries. Aguru is also
generating revenue and brand awareness by offering products and
services that enable the capture, editing and application of real-world
textured surfaces for use in 3D computer-generated imagery.
Aguru’s first target market is the visual effects industry of over 500 films
produced each year, where Aguru’s facial image capture provides a
photo-realistic result currently unattainable by other methods. Thereafter
Aguru intends to expand into the computer games market and then sell
products to over 50,000 architecture, interior design, fashion, industrial,
online catalogue and advertising companies.
The company is supported by a world class Advisory Board comprising
executives from Industrial Light & Magic, Digital Domain, Pixar,
DreamWorks, RFX, Adobe, Autodesk, Electronic Arts, University of Southern
California and New York University. 2 Geomerics
Enhanced computer game graphics – 47% holding
In the last twelve months, this company has seen the successful
development and launch of its “Enlighten” product, which dramatically
improves the lighting effect capabilities for computer games. In addition,
£2.0 million of investment was raised from new investors during the period
under review. A number of major customers are evaluating the product
and significant sales are expected in the current year. 
ANGLE founded Geomerics in 2005 to commercialise technology
developed by the University of Cambridge’s Astrophysics Department.
With the assistance of ANGLE’s proven management capabilities,
Geomerics has developed a unique patent protected technology
platform for the computer games industry. Its first commercial product,
“Enlighten”, delivers dramatically improved lighting effect capabilities 
for computer game programmers. 
Rapid computation of light reflection and refraction in computer
animation is a key factor in the creation of greater realism in computer
games.  The computer gaming market is forecast to grow at an average
11.4% compound annual rate to $46.5 billion by 2010, with strong
demand anticipated from Asia Pacific and EMEA regions. Geomerics is
well positioned to benefit from the growth in this market. 
3 Parsortix
Prenatal diagnostics – 68% holding
Parsortix has achieved a world technology break-through by isolating
foetal cells in maternal blood and this has been independently verified
by a leading independent expert in the field. For the first time this allows
completely non-invasive testing of the unborn baby. 
Pregnant women have a very small number of their baby’s cells
circulating in their blood, thought to be at most one foetal cell in every
500 million maternal cells. Parsortix has developed a patent protected
micro fluidic device which, when 1.5 ml of the mother’s blood is flowed
through the device, can for the first time capture these foetal cells for
analysis. 
Early definitive diagnosis for chromosomal abnormalities associated with
Down’s, Turner, and Klinefelter syndromes, as well as other disorders due
to genetic abnormalities such as spina bifida, can help physicians better
care for both the mother and the foetus during pregnancy. It also gives
families earlier information with respect to the health of the unborn child
and is increasingly important as the mother’s average age increases.
At present, diagnosis is only possible through invasive procedures such as
amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). These carry a risk to
both the baby and the mother and as a result are limited only to high risk
pregnancies. Parsortix’s new device allows completely non-invasive
testing of the unborn baby removing the risk and allowing diagnosis to
be extended as a matter of course to all babies not just those known to
be at high risk. The physical separation process used is simple and cost-
effective. It requires no pre-treatment of the sample and no reagents.
Commercially, Parsortix’s unique patented separation technique will
reduce overall medical costs. In the high risk category, there are currently
375,000 tests per annum in the US market alone. With a non-invasive test,
the market is likely to expand to cover lower risk patients with a
theoretical maximum in the US market alone of 2.6 million tests per
annum. Parsortix has the potential to secure a dominant position in this
separation market. The current cost of the amniocentesis procedure in
the US is around $1,200. The Parsortix technique is expected to reduce
this cost by at least 60%. 
A number of multinationals have already expressed interest in Parsortix
and ANGLE is now focused on completing development of the product
and securing regulatory approval. 
Outlook
ANGLE has reduced its operating costs, met its investment objectives 
and moved to profitability.
ANGLE is now structured so that cash generated by the Management
services business, which is already secured through existing long term
management contracts, is expected to more than cover all the
operating costs of the business over the next 12 months. Investment will
continue at a reduced level during the first half. Cash balances are
expected to decline in the first half but to recover in the second half.
ANGLE has built a strong position in the field of IP commercialisation, not
only in the UK, but also Internationally. The Board looks forward to
continuing to leverage the significant opportunities that are present
throughout the business to generate substantial cash returns for
shareholders.

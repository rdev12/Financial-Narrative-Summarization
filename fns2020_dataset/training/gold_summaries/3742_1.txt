This	left	us	with	three	immediate	issues:	
identifying	the	cause	and	extent	of	the	
error ,	putting	corrective	measures	in	
place	and	dealing	with	the	operating	
problems	that	had	been	obscured	by	the	
overstatement.	W e	reported	on	progress	
in	addressing	these	issues	both	in	our	
Interim	R esults	on	9	December	2009	and	
in	our	Business	and	 T rading	Update	on	
18	March	2010.	 Although	there	is	still	
work	to	do,	 the	restructured	SCS	with	
a	new	Managing	Director	appointed	and	
its	cost	base	significantly	reduced,	is	
now	on	a	much	firmer	footing.
Despite	a	promising	start	to	the	year	
SEA 	too	has	also	experienced	operating	
p r o b l e m s , 	 a s 	 a 	 r e s u l t 	 o f 	 p r o j e c t 	 d i f fi c u l t i e s	
and	slower	than	anticipated	order	intake	
in	some	areas.	W e	have	responded	by	
withdrawing	from	loss-making	activities	
and rationalising our activities in the 
marine sector into a single division. 
As	a	result,	SEA 	too	goes	into	the	new	
financial	year	on	a	more	solid	basis.
The year has also seen some major 
successes.	MASS	has	once	again	had	a	
record	year ,	with	some	significant	orders,	
notably	the	£55m	contract	to	provide	
technical	support	to	the	MOD.	SEA ’ s	
Space	business	 continued	its	rapid	and	
profitable	growth,	and	the	company	won	
a strategically important order to provide 
the	External	Communication	System	for	
Astute	submarines.	SCS	has	seen	strong	
performance	in	its	Logistics	activities.	
The	record	order	book	at	the	year-end	
provides	a	good	base	for	the	2010/11	
financial	year .
Group overview
Cohort	is	an	independent	group	whose	
constituent	companies	provide	a	wide	
range	of	technical	advice,	support,	
managed services and certain niche 
products,	the	latter	characterised	
by	high-tech	design	and	low	volume	
manufacture.	Our	approach	has	been	
to	maximise	the	autonomy	afforded	to	
our	subsidiary	companies,	allowing	them	
the	space	to	be	innovative,	responsive	to	
customer	needs,	and	agile	in	their	market	
positioning.	 At	the	same	time	we	have	
sought	to	provide	advice,	mentoring	and	
business	development	support	from	the	
strong	Cohort	central	team,	and	give	
customers	the	confidence	to	place	large	
orders	with	us	that	they	might	have	been	
reluctant	to	award	to	smaller	privately	
owned	businesses.	
W e	have	looked	hard	at	this	basic	concept	
as	a	result	of	the	operating	problems	that	
have arisen and have concluded that it 
remains	fundamentally	sound.	
Nevertheless	we	have	significantly	
e n h a n c e d 	 o u r 	 c e n t r a l 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 c o n t r o l s 	 a n d	
monitoring procedures to ensure there is no 
repetition	of	the	events	of	last	December .	
W e	have	also	appointed	a	new	auditor ,	
K P M G , 	 w i t h 	 t h e 	 a i m 	 o f 	 p r o v i d i n g 	 a d d i t i o n a l	
confidence	 to	 shareholders	 and	 the	 Board.	
W ork	 continues	to	improve	SCS’ s	internal	
processes and controls under close 
supervision	from	Cohort.	 This	supervision	
will	be	sustained	until	we	are	certain	
that	the	issue	has	been	fully	resolved.
Summary of Chief Executive’s Review
A	 	 Our	businesses	are	leaner	and	b etter	
equipped	for	the	challenges	ahead.	
A	 	 The	restructured	SCS	is	now	on 	a	much	
firmer	footing.
A  SEA ’ s	submarine	and	space	busi ne sses	
grew	significantly .
A	 	 MASS	has	once	again	had	a	reco rd	year ,	
with	some	significant	orders,	notably	
the £55m contract to provide technical 
support	to	the	MOD.

Review of the Year Corporate Governance Financial Statements
In	 August,	Cohort’ s	executive	team	will	
relocate	from	its	Henley-on-Thames	office	
to	make	use	of	spare	capacity	at	SCS’ s	
new	leased	facility	in	 Theale.
Trading subsidiaries
SCS
As	reported	extensively	elsewhere	in	
this	R eport,	SCS	has	had	a	difficult	year	
but	has	nevertheless	seen	continuing	
profitable	growth	in	some	areas	of	its	
activity ,	including	support	engineering	
a n d 	 l o g i s t i c 	 i n f o r m a t i o n 	 s y s t e m s .	
It	was	a	pleasing	indication	of	customer	
c o n fi d e n c e 	 t o 	 b e 	 a w a r d e d 	 a 	 f u r t h e r 	 y e a r ’ s	
extension	to	the	long	running	training	
support	contract	at	the	UK’ s	P ermanent	
Joint	Headquarters	valued	at	£2.2m.	
The company has recently moved 
from	its	offices	in	Henley-on-Thames	
to	 Theale,	south	of	R eading.	W ith	a	
significantly	 reduced	cost	base	and	a	
new	and	experienced	Managing	Director	
appointed,	SCS	is	well	placed	to	face	
the	challenges	and	uncertainties	of	the	
current	defence	market.
SEA
SEA 	grew	its	revenue	again	after	a	
record	year	in	2008/9,	achieving	turnover	
of	£30.2m,	up	12%.	One	major	contributor	
to	this	was	its	space	business,	which	won	
a	number	of	orders	for	European	Space	
Agency programmes and achieved sales 
well	in	excess	of	expectations.	SEA ’ s	
submarine 	 business 	 also 	 grew 	 significantly , 	
thanks	to	a	large	and	strategically	
important	order	for	a	communications	
system.	SEA ’ s	profitability	was	affected	
by	problems	on	some	of	its	projects,	
in	particular	a	loss-making	contract	for	
a 	customer	in	the	offshore	sector ,	as	well	
a s 	 s l o w e r 	 t h a n 	 e x p e c t e d 	 o r d e r 	 i n t a k e 	 i n 	 i t s	
t r a n s p o r t 	 b u s i n e s s . 	 P r o fi t 	 w a s 	 £ 1 . 6 m , 	 d o w n	
from	its	record	level	of	£3.1m	in	2008/9.	
T owards	the	end	of	the	year ,	SEA 	carried	
out	a	restructuring	exercise,	rationalising	
several	of	its	divisions	to	reduce	cost	and	
refocus	its	activities	in	the	defence	sector	
a n d 	 w i t h d r a w 	 f r o m 	 u n p r o fi t a b l e 	 a c t i v i t i e s .	
W ith	a	strong	order	book	it	is	positioned	
t o 	 d e l i v e r 	 a n 	 i m p r o v e m e n t 	 i n 	 p e r f o r m a n c e	
in	2010/11.
MASS
MASS	has	had	another	record	year ,	
with	revenue	of	£21.5m	and	a	trading	
profit	of	£3.5m.	Good	performance	was	
achieved	in	all	 three	of	its	divisions.	
W ith	support	from	Cohort,	in	May	MASS	
acquired	 Abacus	EW	Consultancy	Limited,	
a	Lincoln-based	EW	training	business.	
Abacus	EW	is	an	excellent	match	for	
MASS’ s	existing	business	in	this	area	
and	brings	with	it	new	capabilities,	
customers and opportunities.

b e c o m e 	 i n c r e a s i n g l y 	 c o m p r e s s e d 	 w i t h i n 	 i t s	
St	Neots	headquarters.	 The	company	has	
now	acquired	a	new	and	larger	facility	
adjacent	to	its	existing	building	that	will	
provide	it	with	a	long-term	home,	with	
options	for	expansion	if	needed.	
Outlook
W e	have	taken	action	to	deal	with	the	
problems	that	have	emerged	over	the	last	
year .	 As	a	result	our	businesses	are	leaner	
and	better	equipped	for	the	challenges	
ahead.	Nevertheless,	UK	defence,	and	
public	sector	spending	more	widely ,	
face	a	turbulent	time	under	the	new	
Government,	with	a	Strategic	Defence	
and	Security	R eview	underway	and	
a	tough	new	approach	to	spending	
commitments.	 There	will	certainly	be	
risks	for	Cohort.	It	is	possible	that	crude	
spending	curbs	might	be	introduced	
that	could	affect	all	defence	suppliers,	
though historically these have never 
been	long-lasting.	Our	operational	
model,	which	focuses	on	customer-
friendly ,	strategically	nimble	businesses	
with	high-tech	capabilities	and	fast	
decision-making,	is	better	suited	to	
this	new	environment	than	any	of	the	
alternatives.	 Although	we	have	some	
exposure	to	defence	programmes	that	
may	be	subject	to	delay ,	cancellation	
or	cutbacks,	much	of	our	work	tends	to	
focus	on	short-term	operational	needs	
which	have	a	high	priority	and	are	
unlikely	to	go	away .	 The	international	
situation	remains	tense	and	unstable	
in	many	regions	of	the	world,	and	our	
export	activities	are	growing.	 There	
will	be	domestic	opportunities	too:	as	
government	seeks	to	rationalise	its	areas	
of	activity ,	opportunities	will	emerge	for	
businesses	like	ours	which	can	carry	out	
the	same	activities	with	greater	flexibility	
and	cost-effectiveness.	Not	least,	we	go	
into	the	 new	financial	year	with	a	record	
order	backlog	of	well	over	£100m.	Overall	
I	am	confident	that	we	will	emerge	
strongly	from	the	uncertainties	of	the	
coming	months,	ready	to	take	swift	
advantage	of	opportunities,	and	to	thrive	
when	the	new	landscape	becomes	clear .

Chairman’s review
Shire leveraged its proven business
model throughout the year, achieving
remarkable results.
Those of us monitoring the global economy throughout
2011 saw many forces at play.
On the one hand, recessionary headwinds, aging
populations, the growing prevalence of chronic disease,
and the resultant cost of funding new medicines and
technologies pressured already strained healthcare
budgets and payors. 
On the other, the healthcare expectations of people
grew, and the extraordinary innovation of scientists 
and researchers brought new treatments to the market,
continuing to change the way disease is both
diagnosed and treated.
Against this backdrop, those who develop and market
medicines had important decisions to make. What
pipeline projects should be advanced? What products
will be reimbursed? How should resources be
distributed within a rapidly changing world? What could
pharmaceutical companies do for patients whose 
wellbeing—and, indeed, sometimes their lives—often
depend on effective treatment?
As Shire’ s Chairman, I was reassured by the many 
ways this specialty biopharmaceutical company both
recognized and addressed the global pressures.

Review of our business
c Annual Report 2011
201 1 highlights 
Another strong year for Shire:
� Revenues exceed $4 billion for the ﬁrst time
� Non GAAP diluted earnings per ADS up 26% to $5.34
Shire leveraged its proven business model throughout
the year, achieving remarkable results. It reinforced 
its commitment to specialist physicians and specialty
medicines, expanded key manufacturing capabilities,
gained approvals for proven medications in new
countries, and maintained its focus on responsibility. 
It maintained its track record as a strategic organization
that doesn’t just react to the challenges of the day, 
but also anticipates them.
During the year Shire took risks—moved into new
therapeutic areas, launched innovative development
projects, diversified its team, and required more of 
itself in essential ways. Shire’ s ability to rise above the
noise of the year and to make steady progress on
behalf of patients, physicians, payors, and policymakers
profoundly accelerated its position as a company 
willing to ask hard questions, make significant changes,
and lead by example.
My association with Shire began in 2003. I continue 
to be grateful for the depth of the Leadership T eam 
and the dedication, innovation, and energy that all Shire
people bring to work each day. I am grateful as well 
for the considerable wisdom that Jeffrey Leiden and
Patrick Langlois brought to our Board in their final year
with Shire. I now look forward to working with Susan
Kilsby, an investment banker with global expertise 
who recently joined our Board and the other members
of the Shire Board in the year ahead.
No one is expecting the dynamics playing out across
the global economy to ease soon. Certainly there will
be more questions than answers. But Shire’ s strategy
and delivery of meaningful solutions will continue 
to differentiate the company as the future unfolds.

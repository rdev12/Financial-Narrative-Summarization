Ladbrokes is a familiar 
name on British high 
streets. Revenue is driven 
by traditional Over the 
Counter (OTC) betting  
on football, horse and 
greyhound racing as  
well as other sports  
and by machines.
Our Digital business is 
aimed at giving 
customers a great user 
experience whenever 
and however they choose 
to bet. With Mobile now 
accounting for circa 60% 
of our Sportsbook 
our  focus has been to 
evolve our product in line 
with the ever changing 
customer preferences.
We operate successful 
retail businesses in 
Ireland, Belgium and 
Spain where our joint 
venture enjoys increasing 
brand recognition and 
is  growing strongly .
Despite a growing 
customer preference  
for betting online, 
traditional telephone 
betting remains popular 
with a number of 
customers. We also 
operate a telephone 
service for our High  
Roller customers.

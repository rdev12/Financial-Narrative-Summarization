 I am pleased to announce our results for the financial 
year, which show further improvement in performance.
Turnover for 2004 has increased by 36% to £2.67 million
(2003: £1.97 million) and profit after tax has been
improved to £278,163 (2003: £135,313).  
Our strategy of providing claims handling, consultancy and
website facilities to the insurance industry continues to be
well received, combined with our use of leading edge
technology with a unique web-based claims notification
and monitoring system.
Overall, we had a very busy year with a particularly
buoyant summer period when claims volumes were 
significantly higher than the corresponding period in 2003.
We continued to add to our client list and most significantly secured a two year primary-
adjuster contract with Rubicon Insurance Services. In addition to this, 2004 saw our first
consultancy income stream for providing client support services and we are confident
that this could well become a more regular contributor to our operating revenues.  
Costs and cashflow continue to be monitored very carefully and additional margin gains
are achievable as our level of activity increases.  
The current financial year, commencing 1st January has seen increased volumes from
the flood conditions in that month and the receipt of a number of large commercial
claims that will enhance 2005 income.
Chairman’s Statement
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 2 We continue to invest in our IT infrastructure and since the year end completed the
latest phase of our claims system enhancement which was funded by a issue of shares
to The Innovation Group plc.
2004 was a year which saw a concentration on organic growth but we are seeking to
achieve further earnings enhancing acquisitions in 2005 and we are actively pursuing
opportunities in this regard.
Finally I wish to thank our loyal employees and our shareholders for their support.

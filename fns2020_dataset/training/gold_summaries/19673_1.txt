 The Group has achieved another year of revenue and profit growth in a challenging retail 
environment, driven by continued expansion both in the UK and across Europe. During 
the year we have increased our store portfolio in the UK by 23 stores and have added 
a further nine stores to our European store portfolio. We have also continued to develop 
large city centre format stores.
We have also established a Fitness division in the year, Sportsdirect Fitness.com, 
comprising 27 gyms including two combined gym and retail sites.
I am delighted to announce that the Group has now met the final target under the 2011 
Share Scheme. The first award under this Scheme is due to vest later in 2015 and will 
reward c.2,000 participating employees for their hard work and dedication. The Group’s 
continued success truly reiterates how important the Share Schemes have been in 
motivating participants to work towards a shared goal.
GROUP 
Group revenue increased by 4.7% to £2,832.6m in the year. This was primarily due to 
the Sports Retail division, where we grew revenues by 5.5%. Premium Lifestyle revenue 
fell by 3.0%, largely due to the closure of loss-making stores in the period.
Group gross margin in the year increased by 110 basis points from 42.7% to 43.8%. 
Sports Retail division gross margin increased by 170 basis points to 44.6% (FY14: 
42.9%), while Brands division gross margin decreased to 40.3% (FY14: 43.1%).
Group operating costs increased 4.2% to £860.5m (FY14: £826.1m). We continue to 
balance revenues and gross margin, while maintaining a tight focus on operating costs 
and as a result grew Group underlying EBITDA (pre-scheme costs) for the year by 15.7% 
to £383.2m (FY14: £331.1m). Within this underlying EBITDA, we increased the Retail 
division EBITDA by 16.0% to £349.1m (FY14: £300.9m) while the Brands division 
EBITDA increased by 12.9% to £34.1m (FY14: £30.2m).
Excluded from underlying EBITDA is a £10.1m (FY14: £11.9m) charge in respect of the 
2009 and 2011 Share Schemes. This charge has been taken centrally and, except in note 
4 to the Annual Report, is not reflected in the divisional (Retail and Brands) numbers in 
this report. 
For the year, Group underlying profit before tax increased 20.5% to £300.3m, primarily 
as a result of the £52.1m increase in EBITDA (pre-scheme costs). Underlying EPS for the 
year increased by 21.2% to 38.9p (FY14: 32.1p). 
Net debt at 26 April 2015 was £59.7m (27 April 2014: £212.0m), which is 0.16 times 
reported EBITDA (27 April 2014: 0.66 times). Reported EBITDA includes realised foreign 
exchange gains/losses in selling and administration costs and the Share Scheme charges.

SPORTS RETAIL 
Sports Retail revenue has grown in the period as we continue to invest in product range 
and availability, increasing the proportion of ‘better’ and ‘best’ Group branded products, 
optimise both our in-store and web offerings and further invest in our store portfolio. 
Sports Retail sales grew 5.5% to £2,398.6m (FY14: £2,274.4m), driven largely by 
growth in the UK, offset by a weak winter sports season across Europe and adverse 
foreign currency movements. Sports Retail gross margin for the year increased by 170 
basis points to 44.6% (FY14: 42.9%). This increase is primarily attributable to on-going 
investment in our ‘better and best’ product ranges, further enhanced by efficiencies gained 
by our strong supply chain disciplines. 
Sales in the second half of the year were up 2.6% to £1,167.6m (FY14 H2: 
£1,138.3m). Gross margins for the second half of the year improved to 44.6% (FY14 
H2: 42.5%). 
Sports Retail like-for-like gross contribution, which excludes online, increased by 7.4% 
(1)
 
marking the sixth consecutive year of growth in this KPI (FY14: +10.5% / FY13: 
+10.6% / FY12: +0.7% / FY11: +6.8% / FY10: +3.7%). Sports Retail like-for-like 
contribution is defined as the percentage change in gross contribution in the successive 
12-month period. A like-for-like store is one that has been trading for the full 12 months 
in both periods and has not been affected by a significant change, such as a major 
refurbishment. The number of stores included in this year’s KPI is 432 (FY14: 339).
(1) Excluding EAG and SIG as the prior year comparative is not a full year.
OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
I am pleased to report that, despite the adverse impact on performance of England’s early departure from last year’s FIFA World Cup in 
Brazil and the unseasonably mild weather during autumn reducing footfall, the Group has, yet again, succeeded in delivering another solid 
set of results.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT & BUSINESS REVIEW
21
EVERYTHING IS CHANGING... Sports Retail operating costs increased by 9.0% in the year to £715.2m (FY14: 
£656.3m) compared to a 5.5% increase in sales and a 9.7% increase in gross profit due 
to the full year impact of proportionally higher costs in our recently acquired European 
businesses. Operating costs in H2 increased by 4.6% to £361.4m (FY14 H2: £345.5m) 
compared to a 2.6% increase in sales and a 7.7% increase in gross profit.
Store wages were up 13.1% in the year to £239.2m (FY14: £211.4m) but as a 
percentage of sales increased only to 10.0% (FY14: 9.3%) due to the annualised 
effect of new store openings combined with the full year impact of proportionally higher 
costs in our recently acquired European businesses and reduced sales due to a difficult 
winter sports season in Europe. Sports Retail store premises costs increased by 9.5% to 
£211.0m (FY14: £192.7m), due to investment in new stores and the full year effect of 
comparatively higher costs in our new European businesses. Other operating costs were 
up 13.9% to £280.8m (FY14: £246.6m), increasing as a percentage of sales to 11.7% 
(FY14: 10.8%) due to costs in our recently established Fitness division.
The currency impact on operating costs of the change in the Euro: Sterling exchange in our 
European businesses rate was a gain of £15.7m (FY14: a loss of £5.6m).
Underlying EBITDA for Sports Retail was £356.8m (FY14: £321.3m), an increase of 
11.0% for the year. This increase was driven by a £94.2m increase in gross profit due 
to the growth in store contribution and online sales, offset by the £59.0m increase in 
operating costs.
The Group’s retail businesses performed strongly in a difficult economic environment. Our 
retail model, offering outstanding value to our customers, remains resilient, both in the UK 
and internationally. Throughout the year, we continued to focus on offering our customers 
the most comprehensive product range, the best availability and value while minimising 
operating costs as a percentage of gross sales.
Online revenue has increased by 14.4% from £335.4m to £383.8m in the year, driven 
largely by the successful launch of Click and Collect in the UK during the second half of 
the year, which now accounts for over 20% of all UK online orders. This performance is 
exceptional considering we charge £4.99 for this service. Online sales represented 16.5% 
of Sports Retail sales (FY14: 15.1%), excluding wholesale sales. 
Our mobile site continues to drive sales and the Group was recently ranked in the top four 
retailers in the FTSE 100 in terms of mobile website performance, according to a recent 
study released by The Search Agency*. Mobile traffic now accounts for over 50% of all 
online visits. We have also re-designed our checkout, introducing a guest checkout option 
and streamlining the checkout process.
We have worked hard to improve the customer experience in Europe, widening the 
language and currency conversion options on our sites for non-English speaking countries, 
and going forward, plan to introduce dedicated websites for our European businesses and 
additional payment methods including Ideal, Giro and Sofort. 
Following successful trials during the year, customers are now able to purchase and redeem 
gift cards online. We are also working towards the introduction of a “fast pay” checkout 
system, allowing customers to purchase a large number of products in a small number of 
clicks.
The division has continued to expand, with the development of Sportsdirect Fitness.
com, comprising 25 standalone former LA Fitness gyms and an additional two new build 
combined retail and gym spaces. A further two gyms in St Helens and Dundee are planned 
for early autumn 2015. Membership continues to grow and we have already surpassed our 
full year targets.

We have continued to invest in staff training, with a key focus this year on our “Home 
Grown” Talent Management programme, Customer Service Training and Management 
Induction. During the year over 58,000 hours were invested into training and developing 
our workforce. A great deal of this training took place at our Training Academy on our 
Shirebrook campus, which is the only training centre in the world supported by both 
Nike and Puma. We are committed to the continued development of our staff, always 
aiming to promote internally wherever possible and during the year ran our first Graduate 
Recruitment Programme, ‘Talent Bank’, where graduates were placed in our Finance and 
Ecommerce teams for eight-week summer placements and offered the opportunity to 
compete for a permanent role, with the best being rewarded.
Phase Three of the development of our National Distribution Centre in Shirebrook, the 
construction of an additional c.700,000 sq. ft. footprint warehouse and office facility, is 
now well underway, with completion scheduled for late 2015.
We have worked hard to enhance and invest in our store portfolio during the year, with a 
particular focus on larger city centre stores. During the year we relocated our Oxford Street 
store to the c.50,000 sq. ft. former HMV store and have completed a c.28,000 sq. ft. 
extension of our Glasgow store which includes a store in store concept area with Under 
Armour. We have recently also acquired the freehold of the former Primark store in Leeds. 
Works are currently underway on this four floor, c.50,000 sq. ft. store which is due to 
open this summer.
During the year we opened 39 stores in the UK, closing 16, and have opened an additional 
16 stores in Europe, closing seven. 12 out of the 16 UK closures were relocations 
into larger and better configured space. 428 of the UK store fascia are now branded 
SPORTSDIRECT.com, an increase of 27 from last year (FY14: 401).
Period end square-footage increased to c.4.75m sq. ft.
(1)
 (FY14: c.4.5m) in the UK and 
remained at c.3.0m sq. ft. 
(2)
 (FY14: c.3.0m sq. ft.) across the rest of Europe. 
(1) Due to differing methodologies, this implies a range between 4.5m sq. ft. - 5.0m sq. ft. 
(2) Due to differing methodologies, this implies a range between 2.5m sq. ft. - 3.5m sq. ft.

In the 52 weeks to 26 April 2015, rent reviews have been agreed on 33 stores, of which 
26 stores were agreed at nil increase. Of the remaining seven stores the average increase 
in rent was 13.87%, giving a total average increase over the 33 stores of 2.88% (0.57% 
annual equivalent). There are currently 52 rent reviews outstanding with a further 42 
falling due in FY16. Our lease expiry profile over all leasehold stores (excluding Lillywhites 
Piccadilly) is now 4.6 years, including 37 stores with contractual expiries or break dates 
within the next 12 months. This significant amount of flexibility within our portfolio  
allows us to continue to monitor and adapt our format to the rapidly changing multi-
channel environment.
In the current financial year, we are targeting to open between 30 and 40 stores, c.30% 
of which are expected to be relocations. We are also targeting to re-fit c.300,000 sq. ft. of 
retail space across the UK.

(1) Excluding Republic of Ireland & Iceland 
(2) Includes only stores with SPORTSDIRECT.com and Sportland fascias
All of the above stores are operated by companies wholly owned by the Group, except 
Portugal, where the Group owns 50.1% and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania where the Group 
owns 60.0%. During the year we have expanded our European store portfolio by nine 
stores and have entered one new country. As a result we are now active in 20 countries 
across Europe including the Republic of Ireland and Iceland. 
In Austria, we have continued to relocate and upgrade the former Sports Experts stores 
which had been previously re-branded to the SPORTSDIRECT.com fascia. Over the coming 
year we will re-brand key Megastores to the Lillywhites fascia, replicating our UK city 
centre store format across the re-branded stores in collaboration with key international 
brands such as Salomon. 
In the Baltic states we have already opened two stores in Estonia under the 
SPORTSDIRECT.com fascia and plan to open two further stores in Lithuania and one store in 
Latvia under the SPORTSDIRECT.com fascia. We have also continued to invest in relocating 
and re-fitting the stores trading under the SPORTLAND fascia.
Our strategy remains to identify partners in new territories while continuing to expand our 
operations in the countries where we currently trade. For FY16, we are targeting to open 
between 20 and 30 new stores across seven countries.
The Group has a 50% shareholding in the Heatons chain which operates 15 Sports Direct 
stores in Northern Ireland and 27 sports stores in the Republic of Ireland. We also own a 
40% shareholding in the Sports Direct business in Iceland.
Local management continue to work hard to ensure that all new and existing stores in 
Europe are committed to striving towards the operational efficiencies and standards that 
exist across our UK sports stores.
PREMIUM LIFESTYLE 
Premium Lifestyle sales decreased 3.0% to £207.6m (FY14: £214.1m), due to the 
closure of loss-making stores in the year. Premium Lifestyle gross margin for the year 
decreased by 150 basis points to 38.8% (FY14: 40.3%) due to online clearance of legacy 
stock in the year.
Premium Lifestyle operating costs decreased by 17.3% to £88.2m (FY14: £106.7m) due 
to the continued rationalisation of the USC and Republic businesses and synergies gained 
by the consolidation of key head office functions in Flannels, Cruise and Van Mildert and 
the integration of the distribution function.
The Underlying EBITDA loss for Premium Lifestyle decreased to £7.7m (FY14: £20.4m 
loss) as we began to see the benefit of the re-structuring of Republic in the prior year  
and rationalisation of the other businesses. We will see further benefits of this in the 
coming year. 
Online revenue in the division increased in the year, driven largely by improvements in 
stock availability and system improvements. We saw the benefit of the integration of 
the division’s eCommerce platforms with the Group’s IT systems and the launch of the 
Flannels.com and USC mobile platforms in the prior year. We also successfully launched  
UK Click and Collect in USC during the year and over 15% of all USC online orders are  
now delivered via Click and Collect. 
We continue to strengthen our relationships with key third party suppliers.
At the year end, the Premium Lifestyle division traded from 103 stores under four  
main fascias:
26 April 2015 27 April 2014
USC 66 90
Cruise 10 10
Van Mildert 10 9

Total 103 126
 
BRANDS  
The Group’s brand portfolio includes a wide variety of world-famous sport, fashion and 
lifestyle brands. The Group’s Retail division sells products under these Group brands in  
its stores, and the Brands division exploits the brands through its wholesale and licensing 
activities. The Brands division continues to sponsor a variety of prestigious events and 
retains a variety of globally-recognised, high-profile sportsmen and women as  
brand ambassadors.
Brands division total revenue increased by 4.1% to £226.4m (FY14: £217.5m). 
Wholesale revenues were up 4.4% to £193.3m (FY14: £185.2m), including growth in 
the challenging UK market. Trading in the US market was in line with expectations and 
continues to represent c.40% of total wholesale sales.
Brands gross margin decreased by 280 basis points to 40.3% (FY14: 43.1%). Wholesale 
gross margins fell 310 basis points to 30.1% (FY14: 33.2%) largely due to a shift in the 
sales mix towards lower margin lines. 
Licensing revenues in the year were up 2.5% to £33.1m (FY14: £32.3m).  
During the year we signed 58 new licence agreements, covering multiple brands, product 
categories and geographies, with minimum contracted values of $25m over the life of  
the agreements. At 26 April 2015, the Group has 401 license agreements worldwide
(1)
, 
across 264 licensees, with contracted minimums of $305m over the remaining life of  
the agreements.
(1) Includes consolidation of agreements signed in prior years.

EVERYTHING IS CHANGING... Longer term, we still regard licensing as the key driver of Brands division profitability and 
central to the overall growth of the Brands business. The key growth areas are expected 
to include Australasia and Asia Pacific with the acquisition of the Dunlop and Slazenger 
brands in the region during the year. This combined with growth in the Americas should 
compensate for a more challenging licensing landscape in the UK and Europe, as Sports 
Retail continues to expand in these territories. 
Operating costs decreased by 9.7% to £57.0m (FY14: £63.1m) benefiting from the 
consolidation of our back office functions in the prior year. As a result of cost savings, 
underlying EBITDA increased by 12.9% to £34.1m (FY14: £30.2m).
We continue to focus on developing world-class products that are endorsed by leading 
athletes on the field of play. We expect to spend between £10 and £20m on advertising 
and promotional costs in the coming year.
WORKFORCE 
The success of the Group has largely been created by our c.27,000 strong workforce, 
whose dedication and commitment has been sustained over many years. Their enthusiasm 
and ‘one team’ attitude has assisted the Group to succeed where many other retailers 
have failed. The Board is extremely grateful for the time that our workforce has taken to 
develop their skills and expertise. We promote staff training wherever possible to enable 
them to be the best that they can be. 
The 2009 and 2011 Share Schemes have been fundamental tools in the motivation and 
incentivisation of participating employees. Under the 2009 Share Scheme, c.27m shares 
vested with those participants. Subject to satisfactory personal performance, a further 
c.21m shares are expected to vest under the 2011 Share Scheme.
The 2011 Share Scheme Adjusted Underlying EBITDA targets (before scheme costs), 
relate to performance between FY12 and FY15. All four targets have now been met, and 
subject to the individual employee’s satisfactory personal performance, the shares are 
due to vest in 2015 and 2017. Under the 2011 Share Scheme participating employees 
are eligible for awards on a pro-rata basis depending on their length of service with the 
Group. Awards under the scheme are granted at either 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% of the 
participant’s annual base pay. Subject to the performance criteria being fulfilled, c.5m 
shares are due to vest in 2015 and c.16m shares are due to vest in 2017.
An additional three million shares are due to vest with an Executive Director and two 
members of senior management in 2017 under the Executive Share Scheme, subject 
to performance criteria being fulfilled. The Executive Share Scheme performance targets 
mirror those to be applied to awards under the 2011 Share Scheme.
As a result of the successes of previous schemes, the 2015 Share Scheme has been 
devised to encourage further outstanding employee performance for those who are 
invited to participate. The Scheme will provide for the grant of nil-cost options over up 
to 25m shares. The vestings are dependent on stretching performance criteria spanning 
between FY16 and FY19. With original EBITDA targets (before scheme costs) of £480m 
for FY16, £570m for FY17, £650m for FY18 and £750m for FY19 when the Scheme 
was approved, the Scheme has the potential to not only motivate participants, but also to 
create a further substantial increase in shareholder value.
The Group intends to propose an amendment to the FY16 Adjusted Underlying EBITDA 
target under the 2015 Share Scheme, which will be reduced from £480m to £420m.  
All other targets for the further three years of the Scheme currently remain the same.  
This change will be put to shareholders as an ordinary resolution at the Company’s AGM  
in September 2015.
CONTRACTS ESSENTIAL TO THE BUSINESS 
OF THE GROUP 
The Group has long-established relationships with Nike and adidas, the major suppliers 
of third-party branded sporting goods, and considers that continued supplies from these 
companies are critical to the business of the Group.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  
The Corporate Responsibility Report is on pages 28 to 32 and a review of the assessment 
of the Group’s impact on the environment is included in this report.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
The Group designs clothing and some footwear for sale in stores and has arrangements 
with suppliers for the research and development of goods for the Brands division.
OUTLOOK 
Trading since the year end has been in line with management’s expectations, and 
underpins the 2015 Share Scheme’s proposed revised FY16 Underlying EBITDA target of 
£420m. The Group’s performance continues to benefit from a number of factors including 
investment in product range and availability, with an increased emphasis on ‘better’ 
and ‘best’ Group branded products and the optimisation of our in-store and web offer, 
enhanced by the introduction of Click and Collect in the UK. We also continue to invest in 
our store portfolio, with the roll-out of further large format city centre stores.

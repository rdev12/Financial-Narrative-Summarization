Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Chairman’s statement
“The strategic targets set in 2009 
have been successfully achieved 
a year ahead of schedule.”
R J Harrison OBE, Chairman
Summary
  2011 saw a decisive shift of the balance 
of the Group’s activities into the 
Engineering Services sector in line 
with our established strategy. 
  Amco has integrated very well into 
the Group and has performed in line 
with expectations.
  The Engineering Services order book 
was £179m (2010: £82m), an increase 
of 118%.
  Looking ahead, the Board has an 
ambition that the Group will have 
turnover of over £500m by 2014, 
achieved by acquisition and organic 
growth, with a target that Engineering 
Services will account for at least 70% 
of Group revenue and with Group 
operating margin of more than 3%.
Introduction
2011 saw a decisive shift of the balance of the 
Group’s activities into the Engineering Services 
sector in line with our established strategy.
The acquisition of Amco Group Holdings 
Limited (“ Amco”) in February 2011, together 
with continued organic growth and the decision 
to withdraw from non‑specialist public sector 
building markets, has accelerated the Board’s 
repositioning of Renew as an Engineering 
Services Group supporting UK infrastructure.
In 2009, the Board set out its strategy to 
deliver at least 50% of Group revenue from 
its Engineering Services activities with Group 
operating	profit	of	over	2%	by	2012.	These	
targets have been achieved one year ahead 
of 	 plan 	 with 	 Group 	 operating 	 profit 	 margin 	 for 	
the year of 2.2% and Engineering Services 
accounting for 52% of Group revenue in the 
second half of the year. 
Results
The Group has recorded results for the year 
ended 30 September 2011 which are in line 
with market expectations.
Group revenue was £356.7m (2010: £290.4m). 
Profit 	 before 	 income 	 tax 	 prior 	 to 	 exceptional 	
items and amortisation charges was £8.1m 
(2010: £4.6m). Adjusted earnings per share, 
calculated prior to exceptional items and 
amortisation charges, was 9.6p (2010: 5.3p).
Engineering Services revenue was £176.7m 
(2010: £127.4m), an increase of 39%, with 
operating	profit	prior	to	exceptional	items	
increasing by 78% to £7.4m (2010: £4.2m). 
These results include seven months of Amco’s 
trading. Amco has integrated very well into 
the Group and has performed in line 
with expectations. 
Specialist Building revenue increased to 
£178.9m (2010: £163.1m), with operating 
profit 	 prior 	 to 	 exceptional 	 items 	 of 	 £1.9m 	
(2010: £1.8m). 
The Group’s contracted order book 
at 30 September 2011 stood at £285m 
(2010: £304m). This reduction is entirely 
due to our planned lower levels of activity in 
Specialist Building. The Engineering Services 
order book was £179m (2010: £82m), 
an increase of 118%. 
At 30 September 2011, the Group’s net debt 
was £6.8m comprising a loan of £12.5m and 
cash of £5.7m (2010: net cash £16.2m). The 
loan	and	the	decrease	in	cash	reflect	the	
Amco acquisition.
Dividend
The	Board	is	proposing	a	final	dividend	
at 2.0p per share, maintaining the full year 
dividend at 3.0p (2010: 3.0p). The dividend will 
be paid on 23 February 2012 to shareholders 
on the register as at 27 January 2012. 
Strategy
The strategic targets set in 2009 have 
been successfully achieved a year ahead 
of schedule. Looking ahead, the Board 
has an ambition that the Group will have 
turnover of over £500m by 2014, achieved 
by acquisition and organic growth, with a 
target that Engineering Services will account 
for at least 70% of Group revenue and with 
Group operating margin of more than 3%. 
Our emphasis is to secure sustainable 
positions on framework agreements, 
focusing on areas of non‑discretionary 
spend and selective capital projects. 05

Group overview 05
In Specialist Building, our retained businesses 
operate in stable markets. With reduced levels 
of activity and greater focus on our target 
markets, the Board expects this business to 
deliver an improvement in operating margin. 
We will continue to manage risk carefully, 
maintaining selectivity of opportunities in 
markets where the Group has expertise 
and experience. 
Board
The Board welcomes David Forbes, who joined 
on 1 June 2011 as a non‑executive director. 
David’s extensive experience in corporate 
advisory services with NM Rothschild & Son 
Limited will assist the Board in its ambition 
to secure further suitable acquisitions 
in the Engineering Services sector. 
Outlook
Although the overall economic outlook remains 
uncertain, the Board believes that spending 
in infrastructure markets is likely to continue 
to offer opportunities. The decision to focus 
on key markets which are mainly governed 
by regulation enables the Group to take 
advantage of growth anticipated in the Energy, 
Environmental and Infrastructure market 
sectors. This is evidenced by the Group’s 
strong 	 confirmed 	 order 	 book 	 which 	 underpins 	
our expectation of further progress in 2012.

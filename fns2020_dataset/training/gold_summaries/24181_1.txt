CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S Q&A
The video games 
industry is changing 
rapidly, driven by the 
continued evolution of 
customer and gaming 
behaviours. 
This Q&A with Martyn

Officer, explains how 
these changes continue 
to provide challenges 
and opportunities for

GAME Digital plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2016
11 Our industry is changing rapidly, 
driven by the continued evolution 
of customer and gaming behaviours. 
Consumers have never had more 
choice in the way they are able to 
access and engage in gaming and 
this is reflected in the development 
and diversity within our markets. 
The global video games industry is 
set to surpass $100 billion this year, 
with growth driven by the continued 
rise of digital content, whilst sales 
of physical software are expected to 
decline. At the same time, the number 
of people engaged in esports is now 
estimated to total over 250 million 
people globally, with that figure set 
to grow by another 100 million over 
the next three years.
As evidenced by the tough UK market 
environment, these changes continue 
to provide challenges to our business, 
but they also provide significant 
opportunities, and as our markets 
are developing, so is our business. 
We are on a journey to build a 
company which, through a unique 
combination of multichannel retail, 
live gaming and digital services, 
delivers a compelling proposition – 
providing gamers with the opportunity 
to discover, buy, socialise, watch, 
compete and play in both physical 
locations and virtually. Today, no 
other business does this for the 
gamer. We plan to be the first.
At the same time we are focused 
on leveraging our core capabilities 
to drive the development of new 
business opportunities both within, 
and outside, of retail. Through this 
we aim to broaden and deepen our 
customer and business relationships, 
generate incremental revenue streams 
and effect the transition to consistent, 
sustainable earnings growth.
We are positioning our business 
in this changing world to ensure 
that what we do is relevant for 
our customers and our suppliers. 
We, like many other companies, 
have to constantly adapt and 
change in order to grow and we 
have developed plans to achieve this.
 Q.
What caused the 
material decline in 
profitability this year, 
and how has the 
Group responded?
 Q.
What do those market 
dynamics mean for 
the business going 
forwards? Is this the 
beginning of the end 
of the current console 
hardware cycle?
 Q.
What caused the 
material decline in 
profitability this year, 
and how has the 
Group responded?
A.
Both our UK and Spanish retail 
businesses outperformed their 
respective markets this year. 
However, the positive market growth 
we benefited from in Spain was more 
than offset by challenging conditions in 
our larger UK market, which declined 
by 12.7% over the year, to £1.8 billion.
Against this backdrop, our UK GTV 
fell by 11.0%, predominantly driven 
by a reduction in console hardware 
sales versus a year ago and a faster 
drop-off in software sales for older 
console formats, notably the Xbox 360 
and PlayStation 3. 
As a result, Group GTV fell 5.2% 
and when combined with the Group’s 
operational leverage and the planned 
strategic investment made during the 
year, this decline in sales drove the 
consequential impact on our profits.
In response to these market dynamics, 
in January, we rapidly implemented 
a comprehensive programme of 
actions to drive improved business 
performance in our core UK business 
and across the Group. The programme 
covered a wide range of areas designed 
to realise commercial opportunities, 
cost savings, and drive business 
optimisation. There has been 
considerable progress achieved on 
improving supplier arrangements that 
have and will improve future margins; 
reducing property costs through 
landlord discussions and realising 
other cost savings through an 
organisation re-design, cost review 
activities and other efficiency initiatives. 
This programme of work is ongoing 
and remains a key focus and priority 
for the senior management team and 
we expect to deliver future benefits.
 Q.
What do those market 
dynamics mean for 
the business going 
forwards? Is this the 
beginning of the end 
of the current console 
hardware cycle?
A.
First, I think it’s important to stress 
that managing cycles is a fact of life for 
our business. What I am focused on is 
how we best manage the business and 
our finances through those cycles, to 
ensure we are best positioned to grow 
and maximise our market potential.
Though we remain cautious in our 
outlook given prevailing conditions, 
we are entering an exciting time with 
a number of new significant consoles 
launches expected over the next 
12 months and other gaming hardware 
developments across the industry.
As well as the customary ‘mid-cycle’ 
console upgrades, there are signs 
the long-established 5-8 year console 
lifecycle appears to be changing, 
with both Sony and Microsoft 
announcing plans to launch more 
powerful consoles in the next year.

12  Q.
Two years ago you 
said the rise of digital 
content presented 
both opportunities and 
risks to the Company. 
Do you maintain that 
view given direct 
digital distribution 
would appear to be 
diminishing a core 
revenue stream? 
 Q.
Given these market 
developments, 
how is the business 
changing to ensure 
it delivers sustainable 
growth over the 
longer term?
 Q.
What would you 
highlight as the 
most important 
accomplishments 
against these 
plans within  
the year?
In addition, the third of the ‘big 3’ console 
manufacturers, Nintendo, are due to 
launch their latest console in 2017. 
Finally, Virtual Reality represents a 
new and exciting market opportunity 
for us, with the PlayStation VR, Oculus 
Rift and HTC Vive launching in 2016. 
Whilst it remains difficult to accurately 
predict the potential of each of these 
new products, as the leading specialist 
in our markets we are well positioned 
to both support, and benefit from, 
the success of these new products.

 Q.
Two years ago you 
said the rise of digital 
content presented 
both opportunities and 
risks to the Company. 
Do you maintain that 
view given direct 
digital distribution 
would appear to be 
diminishing a core 
revenue stream? 
A.
Without a doubt digital content will 
continue to grow as a proportion of the 
overall market and as a proportion of 
our business. 
In fact, our digital business surpassed 
£100 million of GTV for the first time 
this year, a significant milestone for 
the Group. We also continued to grow 
our digital market share by leveraging 
our store base, where a significant 
proportion of our digital sales occur. 
The expertise of our knowledgeable 
teams is a key strength in driving 
discovery and sales of digital products.
We expect the proportion of full-games 
purchased digitally to continue to 
increase, however, we believe this 
market will remain a predominantly 
physical one for major titles for the 
foreseeable future. At the same time 
we see downloadable ‘add-on’ content 
becoming a bigger part of the total 
content market.
As our digital performance this year 
demonstrates, this doesn’t mean there 
aren’t opportunities. Across our teams 
and with the support of our partners 
we are working on innovative solutions 
to unlock future opportunities by 
improving the digital customer journey.

 Q.
Given these market 
developments, 
how is the business 
changing to ensure 
it delivers sustainable 
growth over the 
longer term?
A.
We have set out our strategic pillars 
and priorities which I believe will 
ensure we continue to effectively 
compete in our core markets, 
and provide a roadmap to the 
transformation of our business and 
the transition to sustainable earnings 
growth. Our market opportunities are 
great enough, the value of the brand is 
strong enough and the things we do for 
customers have value. We will continue 
to focus our efforts on the contributions 
we can make to creating shareholder 
value and target our investments in 
the areas that will make a difference.
Across the Group our teams are 
working relentlessly to drive progress 
against our four key pillars: improving 
our core multichannel retail businesses 
to maximise existing and new market 
potential based around the needs of our 
customers; rapidly expanding our live 
and online gaming services for gamers 
and publishers; developing our digital 
enterprise businesses; and optimising 
the Group’s efficiency to drive 
shareholder returns.

 Q.
What would you 
highlight as the 
most important 
accomplishments 
against these 
plans within  
the year?
A.
First, across our core retail businesses, 
we maintained our leading market 
positions in both the UK and Spain, 
and in Spain we achieved our highest 
market share ever, at 40%. This 
provides us with a strong foundation 
from which to drive forward our plans.
Our retail diversification efforts are 
developing rapidly, with sales from 
digital products and product ranges 
outside of our core console gaming 
markets up 30%, and contributing 
over a fifth of our total sales. 
Across our growing gaming services 
division, we have made considerable 
progress developing and executing 
detailed plans for esports and 
competitive gaming activities in 
both the UK and Spain. In Spain this 
included the acquisition of SocialNAT. 
Implementation of these plans 
continues to accelerate, with the 
trial of our first 12 ‘gaming arenas’ 
underway and the first two arenas 
opened and successfully trading. 
In addition, footfall for our annual 
series of Insomnia Gaming Festivals 
was up over 50% in the year, to more 
than 100,000 people, and we have plans to 
grow this significantly in the coming year.
We made two significant strategic 
developments within our digital 
business during the year. First, the 
signing of a major global server hosting 
contract for an upcoming ‘AAA’ title. 
Second, we completed the acquisition 
of Ads Reality, a software company 
focused on visual recognition and 
augmented reality. We believe this 
acquisition has the potential to both 
support our core business and open 
up significant, adjacent markets for us.

The scale of your 
new businesses are 
currently dwarfed by 
your retail operations. 
What gives you 
confidence these

success of the business 
still down to retail?

 Q.
The scale of your 
new businesses are 
currently dwarfed by 
your retail operations. 
What gives you 
confidence these 
areas can be material 
contributors to the 
Group in a reasonable 
timeframe? Isn’t the 
success of the business 
still down to retail?
A.
Retail absolutely remains critical to 
our business and we have strong plans 
in place to develop and strengthen 
each of our core retail businesses 
to maximise their profitability.
Though the revenue from each of our 
new, non-retail, businesses is small 
today relative to the Group, each is 
positioned within existing, adjacent 
or, in the case of local competitive 
gaming, new markets that we believe 
hold significant revenue potential. 
We believe these businesses will also 
deliver attractive margins, particularly 
as they reach scale, supporting an 
improvement to the Group’s overall 
financial profile.
Whilst these businesses are being 
reported separately within the 
Group, our events, esports and local 
competitive gaming activities are 
highly complementary to retail and 
can be combined to create unique and 
sustainable competitive advantages 
in our core retail markets. 
 Q.
What are the risks to 
delivering your vision?
A.
As with any opportunity in business 
there are associated risks. However, we 
operate an organisation-wide risk 
management process which ensures 
the Group is positioned to assess and 
react to these accordingly.
The Group actively monitors and 
manages risks and uncertainties. 
These include continued changes to 
our markets – both structural changes 
and changes from the competitive 
landscape – IT disruption and ensuring 
we have the right people with the right 
skills to execute our plans.
We are entering new markets and this 
brings additional complexity and risk 
– we have established clear plans to 
ensure we deliver value-added services 
and solutions in those markets that 
meet the needs of our customers.
Looking to the year ahead, our key 
strategic execution risks include 
delivering the targeted progress against 
our retail diversification plans and 
successfully realising our plans for our 
gaming services and digital divisions.

 Q.
Does the business 
have sufficient 
financial resources 
to deliver the 
transformational 
plans you have 
set out?
A.
The Group ended the year with a 
substantial cash balance (net of 
overdrafts) of over £43 million and 
with new and enlarged facilities in 
both the UK and Spain of an aggregate 
of c.£128 million. In addition, following 
the recent sale and leaseback of our UK 
head office and distribution centre we 
have strengthened our cash reserves 
with the cash consideration received 
of £13.5 million.
In 2016, we invested almost £15 million 
across the Group (including capital 
expenditure and acquisitions) to 
support further business development 
and our growth strategy. I believe 
that by concentrating our efforts on 
implementing our strategy with a 
clear focus on cash generation; making 
carefully selected and well timed 
investment decisions and maintaining 
a sensibly balanced approach and 
commitment to controlling costs, 
we will be able to adequately finance 
our plans to achieve our goals.
 Q.
What are your key 
priorities for the next 
12 months?
A.
The management team remains 
fully engaged and focused on ensuring 
that we continue to drive forward 
operational improvements, we 
execute on our strategy and we 
deliver a compelling proposition for 
our customers that earns their loyalty. 
By doing this we will ensure that we 
fully realise the market opportunities 
available to us.
Most importantly, in the coming year we 
plan to progress a number of key strategic 
initiatives across the business that will 
positively impact our Group. We see it as 
a critical year because the successful 
execution of these plans will not only 
ensure we maximise market potential, 
it will further establish and validate 
the roadmap for the transformation 
of our business and ensure we are well 
positioned for the future.
Finally, I am focused on ensuring that 
the business continues to support and 
strengthen the core foundations on 
which it is built: our people and culture; 
our supplier relationships; our brand; 
our insight; and our infrastructure 
and technology.

We recognise we are operating in 
a rapidly changing and challenging 
environment and we have a lot to do 
and a long way to go if we want to truly 
transform the business. Our strategy 
is designed to do just that and our 
talented and dedicated teams are 
focused on delivering it. 
I am confident that by organising 
ourselves effectively and building 
ever stronger and more collaborative 
partnerships with our key suppliers, 
we are putting the business in the 
right place to execute on its plans 
and transition to long-term sustainable 
earnings growth, ultimately delivering 
the strongest returns to our stakeholders.
Our future success relies on the unfailing 
commitment of our teams and the 
support of our partners. I’d therefore 
like to finish by thanking these key 
stakeholders, our people and our 
partners, for their contribution, 
dedication and support in 2016.

Chairman’s statement 
 
I am pleased to announce the 2009 full year results for Weatherly International and to provide an overview of the 
company‟s activities. 
 
Results 
 
Revenue increased to US$108.5 million from US$105.4 million in the prior year as a result of new agreements to process 
third party concentrates. These agreements which have subsequently been replaced by new agreements, left the group 
exposed to the drop in copper prices in the first half of the year, which played a large part in the gross loss for the year of 
US$16.2 million. The group also shut all its mining operations with subsequent redundancy costs and ongoing care and 
maintenance costs, and wrote off all development costs. The smelter, under Namibia Custom Smelters, has reverted to 
operating on a toll basis on its 2009 contracts and is no longer exposed to copper price variation. 
 
Developments during the year 
 
The year under review continued to represent a challenging commercial environment for Weatherly, and I am very 
grateful to my fellow directors for the way in which they have worked closely and effectively together to lead the company 
through the severe global downturn. Alan Stephens joined the board at the beginning of the year as a non-executive 
director, and both he and John Bryant have made invaluable contributions based on their extensive experience and 
excellent judgment. As part of our cost-cutting measures, Paul Craven, Chief Financial Officer, left the company in 
February 2009. 
 
The year started with our mining operations reporting record production during the quarter ending September 2008, but 
this achievement was quickly overshadowed by the dramatic decline in copper prices to well below our cost of 
production. Although we had copper hedges in place, these only provided protection until the end of the calendar year. 
 
Against this background of exceptionally low prices and few signs of significant recovery in the near-term, we conducted 
a detailed strategic review of our operations which led us to the decision to close all our mines at the end of 2008. 
 
At the same time, we entered into an agreement with Chelopech Mining EAD (Chelopech), a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Dundee Precious Metals Inc (DPM), and Louis Dreyfus Commodities Metals Suisse SA (Louis Dreyfus) that provided us 
with US$11.3 million of new funds, underpinning the continued operation and expansion of the Tsumeb smelter. Under 
the terms of these loans, the existing three year supply agreements to process imported concentrates from Chelopech 
and Louis Dreyfus were extended to five years, thus ensuring the future of the smelter operations. 
 
These funds, together with money raised from the sale of non-core mining equipment and real estate in Namibia, 
enabled us to close the mines in a proper and orderly manner, with all staff receiving redundancy payments, and to meet 
the ongoing cost of care and maintenance. 
 
In the overall restructuring of the company's debt profile, we also renegotiated the terms of the US$12 million convertible 
loan notes agreed with significant shareholders in May 2008, with repayment now due to be phased over three years. 
 
Namibia Custom Smelters (Pty) Ltd (NCS), our wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates the Tsumeb smelter, is 
now a stand-alone tolling business. During the year, we carried out a number of improvements to the smelter, ensured 
that the business is properly funded and entered into long-term contracts for the throughput of third party concentrates. 
This positions the smelter well for the future. 
 
In November 2008, Weatherly announced that it had been made aware of a potential claim that was material in the 
context of its cash resources at that time. The company consequently requested that trading of its shares on AIM be 
temporarily suspended. Following a thorough investigation of the claim and the publication of our audited accounts, our 
shares were readmitted to trading on 27 February 2009. 
 
Post year end 
 
In August 2009, we completed a placement of 40,468,000 shares to DPM to raise US$2 million, which will be applied to 
NCS for improvements at the Tsumeb smelter and to provide additional working capital. Weatherly also has the right 
within the 12 months following the allotment of the shares to call on DPM for additional shares up to a value of  
US$5 million at the higher of prevailing market price but not less than 3 pence per share. 
 
On 15 September 2009, Weatherly signed a Letter of Intent whereby a wholly owned subsidiary of East China Mineral 
Exploration and Development Bureau (ECE) will subscribe for 446,851,840 new shares in the company at a price of  
3.6 pence per share, for total proceeds of £16.087 million. Provided the transaction is completed as set out in the Letter 
of Intent, ECE would own 50.1% of the enlarged issued share capital of the company.

As a result of gradually improving copper prices, there has been an increasing interest from third parties in our mines. 
We have completed plans for the reopening of two of the mines and are also examining the development of an open pit 
mine at Tschudi. 
 
Overview 
 
While this has been an extremely difficult year for Weatherly, the board has taken decisive and strategic measures to 
mitigate the impact of the global downturn. Although our mines remain closed at this time, we have continued to improve 
the smelter, expanding its capacity with the aim of forming a profitable stand-alone business. We are preparing 
provisional plans to reopen our mines and to develop the open pit at Tschudi, as well as evaluating other potential growth 
opportunities. 
 
We also now have the exciting prospect of joining forces with a strong and dynamic Chinese mining group. I believe the 
proposed relationship with ECE will enable Weatherly to realise the full value of its existing assets, to acquire and 
develop additional mineral assets, and to generate significant value for our shareholders in the future.

 Chief Executive’s Statement
15 YEARS OF PIONEERING
The 15th of January 2015 marked BrainJuicer’s 15th birthday and a good moment to take stock of the past and 
explore what the future may hold. 
Since 2000, the research industry has changed more than anyone thought likely and BrainJuicer has been  
at the heart of many of those changes. In 2015, the industry finds itself in a genuine state of flux, from overly- 
rational approaches to more emotional measures and models – a change which BrainJuicer is extremely 
well positioned to take advantage of. And perhaps the biggest change is yet to come. A change from market 
research being merely an insurance policy (preventing marketing follies) to finally becoming an enabling policy 
(driving famous marketing) – a model that BrainJuicer has championed for many years. This change in industry 
purpose, from prevention to promotion, is something BrainJuicer intends to be a major beneficiary of, as  
helping marketers do famous things becomes the norm in years to come. 
Fifteen years ago, BrainJuicer was one of the first online research agencies, at a time when many heads of 
research at major multinationals refused to accept that online would become mainstream. Online now accounts 
for over 60% of all quantitative research worldwide. BrainJuicer was also the first agency to invent, trademark 
and patent a method of capturing qualitative open-ended answers and self-structuring them to show what large 
numbers of people think-and-feel about any subject. The MindReader® is still a vital component in BrainJuicer 
research projects and much loved by our clients.
In 2005, BrainJuicer was the first agency for decades to introduce a wholly new method for predicting the 
success of new product concepts. ‘Predictive Markets’ broke every golden rule of concept testing by utilising 
the wisdom of crowds to better identify winners from losers. It turns out, we’re better at predicting what  
other people will do than we are at predicting our own behaviour. That controversial truth has now successfully 
been applied to over 40,000 new product concepts for many of the world’s largest companies. These compa -
nies have enthusiastically adopted its predictive power and made it BrainJuicer’s biggest selling and Juiciest 
product.
In 2006, BrainJuicer invented, validated and trademarked the first quantitative measure of emotion. 
FaceTrace® is now the world’s most deployed measure of emotion, having been used over 5 million times with 
over 3 million respondents and has joined the MindReader® as a vital component in BrainJuicer research 
projects. Since 2009, it has also been the key measure in BrainJuicer’s emotional advertising testing product, 
ComMotion®. As controversial now as Predictive Markets was when launched, ComMotion® is rapidly gaining a 
reputation for helping clients and agencies produce famous advertising campaigns. In just the last three years, 
ComMotion® has been instrumental in the success of some of the most famous advertising on both sides of

the Atlantic; the John Lewis Christmas adverts, including the most recent blockbuster, Monty the Penguin, 3 
Mobile’s Moonwalking Pony and Singing Kitty and Guinness’ Wheelchair Basketball advert. To highlight our abil-
ity to measure and predict famous advertising, we have launched the Global FeelMore50™ – an annual league 
table of the best adverts from around the world. 
For the last few years, BrainJuicer has been a pioneering and vocal advocate of applying behavioural science 
to marketing and switching clients from over-rational research to our more emotional, intuitive research, that 
better predicts famous marketing. The changes to the way marketing should be practiced and measured are 
profound. Here are just three examples of how it changes current marketing practice: 
  Seduction – not persuasion – is the swiftest route to fame and fortune;
  Penetration – not loyalty – drives growth;
  Universal human truths [UHT’s] not unique selling propositions [USP’s] are the basis of great advertising.
The more poetic versions can be found in the illustrated Birthday booklet we published: The 15 Things Every 
Modern Marketer Should Know About Famous Brand Building.
Our staff are dedicated and bright, our geographic footprint is global, we continue to win mandates from the 
world’s largest companies and we have established a reputation as the ‘Most Innovative’ agency – as voted by 
clients and peers, for the last three years running in the GreenBook GRIT Report.
Our revenue growth in 2014 was disappointing, but changing habits and beliefs takes time. With vision, skill, 
patience and creativity, it’s possible and it’s happening at some of the world’s largest companies. Where they 
lead, others will follow. 
The more we help clients achieve famous marketing and accelerate their brand growth, the faster research 
habits will change and the more we’ll find our services in demand around the world.

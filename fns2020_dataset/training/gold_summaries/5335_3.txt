 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 2
Chairman’s Statement
Sir Michael Heller
Turnover for the year to 30 September 2013 
remained steady at £5.83 million compared 
with £5.81 million the previous year. Sales 
of our core software and services increased 
by 3%.
Adjusted operating profit was £835,000 
(2012: £820,000) representing an operating 
margin of 14.3% (2012: 14.1%). This 
underlying cash-based measure of our 
performance excludes non-cash IFRS 
charges and credits. 
Pre-tax profit for the year on a statutory 
basis was £794,000. This compares with a 
loss in the previous year of £83,000 after the 
write-down of property values of £849,000.
We have seen some recent improvement in 
business confidence. However, this remains 
fragile and businesses in the sectors we 
address continue to face a mixed picture. 
Our hosting revenues have continued to 
grow and now represent almost half of our 
total revenues. Contracted recurring revenues, 
which include annual software licence fees 
and hosting charges, amounted to 77% 
of total revenue compared with 76% in the 
previous year. Total R&D expenditure was 
£940,000 (2012: £914,000) which is principally 
focused on the continued enhancement 
of our latest software products Quantum VS 
and Vecta.
We reported last year that we had 
accepted offers on two of our freehold 
properties which were surplus to requirements. 
We completed the sale of one of these 
properties in December 2012 for £440,000 
cash net of disposal costs. The carrying value 
of the property had been adjusted to reflect the 
expected net proceeds at 30 September 2012 
and accordingly the sale resulted in neither 
a profit nor a loss. 
The agreed sale of the other property is 
still proceeding, albeit more slowly than we 
would like, whilst the purchaser is engaged 
in a detailed planning process. This property 
is included in the Group balance sheet at 
£1.42 million which represents the expected 
net sale proceeds. We will report any further 
progress in due course.
We have one further surplus freehold 
property which is currently being marketed 
for sale and which is included in the Group 
balance sheet at £307,000.
Year end cash balances were £5.67 million 
(2012: £5.65 million). In view of our relatively 
large cash balances, we paid a special 
interim dividend of 5p per share in August 
in lieu of the usual interim dividend of 0.713p. 
We continue to look at opportunities to 
acquire similar software producing businesses. 
However, we will review future dividends 
according to the opportunities that arise 
and our overall cash position at the time.
Net assets at 30 September 2013 reduced 
marginally to £6.1 million from £6.3 million 
reflecting the impact of the special interim 
dividend discussed above.
The Board is proposing to maintain the final 
dividend at 2.0p per share giving a total for 
the year of 7.0p (2012: 2.713p). If approved 
by shareholders, the final dividend will be 
paid on 7 April 2014 to those shareholders 
on the register at 7 March 2014. The shares 
will be ex-dividend on 5 March 2014.
As always I would like to thank all our 
members of staff and my colleagues on the 
Board for their contribution during the year.
Whilst there are signs of increased confidence 
in the markets we address, this remains 
patchy and many businesses still retain a 
degree of caution when assessing significant 
IT expenditure decisions. However, with 
our attractive product offering and financial 
strength we are well placed for the future.

Annual Report 2014
Chief Executive’s Review
“ The IT services market 
in the UK is a very 
interesting space at this 
time. It is fragmented in 
nature, which presents 
the type of opportunities 
we, as the Board of 
Castleton, are looking for . 
The Group’ s new strategy, 
to become a leading 
IT managed services 
business, is evidenced 
with the acquisition of 
Montal Holdings Limited 
and my role in leading 
the Group, is to identify 
and deliver the next 
phase of the strategy 
with further acquisitions 
and their integration.” Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

Castleton Technology plc 
Annual Report 2014
Overview
I am pleased to report the progress the 
Group has made during the financial 
year to 31 March 2014. The Group 
has undergone a strategic review 
following the demerger, and the Board 
is now confident that it can deliver its 
stated strategy of a ‘buy and build’ in 
the IT managed service space, with a 
focus on the public and not-for-profit 
sectors. The first building block has 
been put in place with the Montal 
acquisition in June 2014; the Board is 
committed to following this with further 
acquisitions, if the right opportunities 
present themselves.
Montal
Since the year-end the Group has made 
the important first step on its new 
journey, with the acquisition of Montal. 
Montal is a specialist outsourced IT 
managed service provider, with good 
penetration in the public and not-for-
profit sectors, particularly within social 
housing and care providers. I have good 
knowledge of the Montal operation, 
having had the benefit of closely 
monitoring its performance over the 
past 18 months. I firmly believe that 
Montal is a quality asset and a great 
platform from which the Group can 
grow, both organically and through 
further acquisitions. Montal has a 
mature and successful management 
team, which further supports my belief 
that Castleton has made a good start to 
executing its strategy.
Current Year Trading
Whilst the Group results for the year to 
March 2014 reflect a period of change, 
they also demonstrate the progress the 
Group has made from this time last year. 
The Group has sold the infrastructure 
business division, Comunica, for 
£9.5 million in cash followed by the 
disposal of QAD, a proprietary software 
consulting business, for £0.2 million in 
cash. With the post year-end disposal 
of ABS, this paves the way to building a 
‘pure play’ IT managed services group 
of scale, without the distractions of a 
diverse strategy.
Outlook
The IT services market in the UK is 
a very interesting space at this time. 
It is very fragmented in nature, which 
presents the type of opportunities we, 
as the Board of Castleton, are looking 
for. The visible nature of recurring 
annuity revenues supported by scalable 
infrastructure platforms highlights the 
compelling value that scale adds in this 
business model, which underpins the 
Board’ s strategy.
The next phase of the strategy will be to 
find complementary businesses to put 
alongside Montal. My role in leading 
the Group is to identify and realise these 
opportunities. I hope to be in a position 
to share with you progress in this area 
over the coming months. Integrating the 
acquisitions as we make them will play a 
huge role in shaping the success of the 
Group during this period. The Board is 
fully aware that it needs to support the 
divisional management, providing the 
necessary tools and resource to deliver 
the value from this strategy.

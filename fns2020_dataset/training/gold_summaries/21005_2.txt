Key highlights
2016 was another year of strong growth in revenue, profits 
and cash flows. Key highlights were:
• our listing on the London Stock Exchange;
• the launch of Money20/20 Europe, Lions Entertainment,
Bett Middle East, WGSN Insight and the WGSN single
platform contributing to organic growth on continuing
operations of 9.5%;
• the acquisition of One Click Retail;
• the decision to sell 13 Heritage Brands to refine focus to
scalable market-leading events and information services
brands with no material print advertising revenue; and
• the acquisition, after the year end, of MediaLink.
We have retained our focus on customer retention and 
engagement. Our goal throughout the year has been to 
further increase the number of customers we serve and 
simplify how we work so that we may deliver sustainable 
organic revenue growth, strong cash flow and increased 
margins.

1 “Organic” growth is calculated to provide a more meaningful analysis of underlying performance. The following adjustments are made: (a) constant currency (restating FY15 
at FY16 exchange rates); (b) event timing differences between periods (if any); and (c) excluding the part-year impact of acquisitions (of RNG and OCR) and disposals (of MBI). 
There were no event timing differences in 2015 or 2016. See the reconciliation on page 26. 
2 Adjusted EBITDA is IFRS operating profit before expensing: (a) depreciation of tangible fixed assets and amortisation of software; (b) exceptional items; (c) amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets; (d) impairment of tangible fixed assets and software intangibles; and (e) share-based payments. 
3 Adjusted operating profit is IFRS operating profit before expensing: (a) exceptional items; (b) amortisation of acquired intangible assets; (c) impairment of tangible fixed assets 
and software intangibles; and (d) share-based payments.
4 Free cash flow is cash generated from operations before exceptional items, less capital expenditure and tax paid. Free cash flow conversion is this measure of free cash flow 
divided by Adjusted EBITDA from both Continuing and Discontinued Operations. See the reconciliation on page 25.
5  Leverage is net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA from both Continuing and Discontinued Operations.

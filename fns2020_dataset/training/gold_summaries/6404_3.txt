 Dear Owner
Results
Group turnover increased by 8.3% to £606.7 million 
(£560.1 million). Like for like sales increased by 2%. Gross 
profit margin increased from 28.1% to 28.8%, as a result of 
greater efficiency within the business as well as a greater share 
of higher-margin software sales within the mix.
Profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and exceptional charges also
increased, by 4.5% to £34.7 million (£33.2 million). Earnings per
share (EPS) before goodwill amortisation and exceptional charges are
6.63p (6.00p). The compound annual growth of this adjusted EPS
over the past 4 years is 46%. Profit before tax was £18.3 million
(£27.2 million). Basic earnings per share were 2.95p (4.40p).
Exceptional charges of £10.4 million (£0.1 million) in the year
related to the EBI settlement, closure of the loss making on-line
gaming business and the relocation costs associated with the new
Head Office and Distribution Centre in Basingstoke. The principal
element of this charge related to the settlement with a one off
payment of £8.3 million for the services agreement with EBI
which was due to continue until January 2006 and under which
£25.4 million had already been paid by GAME. The Group will
benefit from an annual cost saving of around £5 million per 
annum and the Board consider that the termination is earnings
enhancing.
Your Board is proposing a substantial increase in the final 
dividend of 173% to 1.5p (0.55p) making a total for the year of 
2p (1p). The Board anticipates a progressive policy and subject to
investment requirements future dividend cover (excluding goodwill
amortisation) will be in the range of 3.0 times to 4.0 times. 
Share buyback programme
The share buyback programme which commenced on 28 January
2003 was continued and during the year 30.2 million shares were
purchased for cancellation at an average price of 54.75p per share.
In total the Group has returned £16.84 million to shareholders since
the commencement of this buyback programme.
Directors
On 31 January 2004, John Steinbrecher, formerly group chief
executive, retired from the Board. As previously announced
Martin Long, 37, was promoted to group chief executive with
Lisa Morgan, 33, promoted to deputy chief executive.
In addition, David Thomas, 41, joined the Board as group finance
director on 15 March 2004. He was finance director for Millennium
& Copthorne Hotels Group plc and prior to that held senior financial
positions with House of Fraser plc and Forte plc.
On 14 November 2003, Jean-Paul Giraud, 58, was appointed 
a non-executive director. Until the summer of 2003 he was
Chairman and chief executive of FNAC, the largest specialist
retailer of its kind in Europe with sales of £3.5 billion in six European
countries, South America and the Far East. We welcome to our
counsels a notable international business leader who will add
invaluable experience to our drive to grow our international activities.

Current & future trading
In line with the wider video games market, our plans anticipate a
reduction in sales in the early part of the year, given the strong
comparable period last year which saw events such as the launch 
of Gameboy Advance SP. In the first 11 weeks to 17 April total 
group sales are down by 4% and like for like sales are down by 9%.
The sales mix has resulted in a slight improvement in the achieved
gross margin percentage. This performance is consistent with our
expectations and we remain on plan for the year. 
We do not expect the market to be easy in 2004. However, the
combination of our inherent operational expertise, market leading
position, and store opening programme (21 new stores have
opened already this year) will produce another successful year 
where we aim to outperform the market again.
The Group prospects in the medium term when new generation
products come to market, are particularly exciting.

Chairman’s Statement
Dear Shareholder,
Spectris saw strong trading in 2011, with sales and 
operating profit at record levels, building on the 
momentum generated over the past few years, as 
investment in new products, acquisitions and regional 
expansion has continued to drive our business 
growth. Our acquisition initiatives also continued, 
with the addition of the Omega Engineering business 
being a particular highlight. This adds a significant 
strategic growth platform for our Industrial Controls 
segment. 
Reported sales increased by 23% to £1,106.2 million 
(2010: £901.9 million) and adjusted operating profit* 
grew by 42% to £201.5 million (2010: £142.1 
million). Acquisitions contributed 7% to sales and 
currency had a positive impact of 1%. Thus, on a 
constant currency organic (like-for-like) basis, sales 
grew by 15%. On a pro-forma basis, had each of the 
four acquisitions taken place on the first day of the 
year, sales would have been £1,218.2 million.
Operating margins increased by 2.4 percentage 
points to 18.2%. Profit before tax increased by 45% 
to £191.6 million (2010: £132.3 million) and earnings 
per share increased by 43% from 86.6 pence to 
124.1 pence. 
During the year, the group invested £372.1 million in 
acquisitions and net debt increased by £270.0 million 
to £356.2 million at the end of December 2011.  
At 31 December 2011, the group had cash of  
£41.6 million and undrawn committed facilities 
of £104.2 million. 
The Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 25.4 
pence (2010: 20.9 pence), which, combined with the 
 
 
interim dividend of 8.2 pence, gives a total for the 
year of 33.6 pence (2010: 28.0 pence), an increase 
of 20%. The dividend is covered 3.7 times. This is 
consistent with our policy of making progressive 
dividend payments based upon affordability and 
sustainability. The dividend will be paid on 26 June 
2012 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 1 June 2012.
Corporate governance 
As a board, we are responsible to the company’s 
shareholders for delivering shareholder value 
sustainably over the long term through effective 
management and good governance. We believe 
that a robust discussion focused on the critical 
strategic issues and risks is key to achieving these 
aims and we are fortunate to have non-executive 
directors with extensive industry and international 
experience who can actively contribute to this 
debate. The Board also seeks to develop and 
maintain a good understanding of the company’s 
operations by conducting site visits to two 
locations each year in addition to inviting our 
presidents and managing directors to present at 
other meetings. We plan to recruit a further 
non-executive director during 2012. We recognise 
the benefits that diversity can bring to our business 
and this will be a key element of the selection 
process.
I am pleased to confirm that Spectris is in full 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. An evaluation of our Board in 2010 by 
external consultants confirmed the effectiveness of 
our governance processes in most dimensions, 
John Hughes
Chairman

with some recommendations for expanding the 
terms of reference for Board committees. These 
have now been updated, most notably in the case 
of the audit and risk committee which now more 
formally includes a review of the group’s risk 
management processes and controls. The Board 
committees are described more fully in the 
Corporate Governance section of our annual report 
and their terms of reference are available on our 
website. In 2011, an internal assessment of the 
Board by all members confirmed support for the 
Board’s role, culture and policies. 
Outlook
We are very pleased with our performance in 2011. 
The progress we made on all aspects of our strategy 
was fundamental to delivering these results. Whilst the 
current macro-economic outlook remains uncertain, 
the Board is confident that, as a result of continued 
investment in new products and applications, together 
with the growth opportunities and resilience which 
our recent acquisitions provide, Spectris is strategically 
well positioned for the year ahead.

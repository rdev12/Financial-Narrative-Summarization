POST-OPERATIVE PAIN
Post-operative pain is an acute condition 
directly caused by a surgical procedure. 
The pain typically lasts for a few days and 
can range in intensity from mild to severe 
depending on the type and duration of the 
operation. There are over 90 million operations 
in the US and Europe each year and patients 
are treated with a variety of drugs to manage 
post-operative pain. 
Morphine remains the ‘gold standard’ for the 
management of severe pain despite well known 
undesirable side effects.
The most potent class of known analgesic 
(pain-relieving) drugs are the opiates, 
derived from the opium poppy. Opiates act 
in the brain where they ‘switch off’ the sensation 
of pain. Morphine is an opiate and is one 
of the most effective analgesics known, 
remaining the standard treatment used for 
the management of moderate to severe pain. 
However, like many drugs it can be associated 
with undesirable side effects. These side effects 
can be distressing for patients, may lead to 
medical complications and can impose an 
economic burden on healthcare providers. 
Nausea and vomiting are amongst the 
most common side effects of morphine 
and up to 50% of patients receiving morphine 
experience these distressing side effects. 
Patients have been reported to be willing to 
suffer a degree of pain rather than experience 
post-operative nausea and vomiting. 
“ Acute post-operative pain and PONV are 
the negative outcomes commonly associated 
with surgery that patients are most anxious 
to avoid” (Macario, A and Pergolizzi, J Pain 
and Nausea Management after Surgery, 
The International Journal of Pain Medicine 
and Palliative Care vol3 no3 2004).
Sedation is another common side effect of 
morphine treatment and in the post-operative 
period it is complicated by the sleepiness 
caused by the anaesthetic. If patients are 
excessively sedated, it may be difﬁcult for 
doctors to accurately assess their well-being. 
Respiratory depression (a reduction in breathing 
rate) is a rarer, but potentially dangerous side 
effect, of morphine treatment. The body’s 
normal response to lack of oxygen or the build 
up of excessive carbon dioxide is to increase 
the breathing rate to compensate. This response 
is inhibited by morphine. This can be particularly 
dangerous in the post-operative period since 
anaesthetic drugs often reduce the patient’s 
breathing rate.
MORPHINE METABOLISM 
When morphine is taken into the body 
it is broken down in the liver to two main 
metabolites, M6G and morphine-3-glucuronide 
(“M3G”). M6G is a potent active metabolite 
of morphine and is an effective analgesic, 
whereas M3G is ineffective.
M6G CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT 
CeNeS is developing M6G for the 
management of moderate to severe 
post-operative pain and has reached the 
advanced stages of clinical development 
(Phase III). 
SUMMARY OF M6G FOR POST-OPERATIVE PAIN
 M6G is CeNeS lead clinical candidate.
 Phase III studies conﬁrm superior side effect proﬁle to morphine and equivalent analgesia.
 CeNeS seeks partner(s) for M6G to ﬁnalise date packages.
 M6G programme risk signiﬁcantly reduced with Phase III data.
 Peak sales potential of £200m.
M6G FOR THE TREATMENT 
OF POST-OPERATIVE PAIN

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
PHASE III STUDIES 
COMPLETED PHASE III STUDY (M6G015)
The ﬁrst Phase III trial of M6G was completed 
in 2005. This initial Phase III trial (designated 
M6G Study M6G015) was carried out in three 
European countries, recruiting 168 hospitalised 
patients suffering from post-operative pain 
following knee replacement surgery carried 
out under spinal anaesthesia. The prime 
objective of the study was to compare the 
analgesic efﬁcacy and duration of action of 
a range of doses of M6G compared with 
placebo. M6G015 conﬁrmed that a single 
dose of M6G administered intravenously 
at 30mg/70kg body weight is an effective 
analgesic agent for the treatment of post-operative 
pain. The study also showed a clear dose 
response relationship with a decrease in the 
amount of morphine consumed as the dose of 
M6G increased. The study results also showed 
that M6G is safe and well tolerated.
M6G015 was not designed to produce 
deﬁnitive evidence on the side effect proﬁle 
of M6G. However, the incidence of nausea 
and vomiting over early time periods after 
M6G was low and similar to placebo, 
indicating that a single dose of M6G that 
can provide pain relief does not appear 
to induce nausea or vomiting. 
COMPLETED PHASE III STUDY (M6G022) 
The study involved 24 centres in six 
European countries and recruited 517 
patients. The study was designed primarily 
to provide key information on a comparison 
of effective IV pain management regimens of 
M6G or morphine treatment for a minimum of 
24 hours (and up to 48 hours) following major 
abdominal surgery. Morphine is generally 
accepted as the ‘gold standard’ drug for use 
in these circumstances. Initial pain management 
was achieved by administration of a loading 
dose and titration of either M6G or morphine 
to achieve acceptably low levels of pain for the 
patient to go onto the ward. In the ward, pain 
management treatment was achieved by 
patient controlled analgesia (“PCA”), whereby 
the patient was allowed to self administer 
a dose of M6G or morphine as required to 
control their pain. The study was randomised 
and double blind so that neither patient nor 
carer was aware of which treatment was being 
administered. The main purpose of the study 
was to demonstrate statistically that:
  treatment with either M6G or morphine, 
particularly during PCA, results in similar 
levels of pain management; and
  effective analgesic treatment during 
PCA results in lower levels of nausea 
and vomiting in patients receiving M6G 
compared to those receiving morphine. 
In addition, other important side effects, 
efﬁcacy and safety features were determined 
throughout the study. 
1. M6G matches morphine for analgesic effect
Importantly for a novel pain product, the trial 
results unequivocally show that M6G is as good 
as morphine in terms of analgesia achieved 
in patients up to 48 hours post-operatively 
(ﬁgure 4). Successful achievement of this ﬁrst 
primary endpoint supports data from previous 
clinical trials of M6G and is an essential 
component in the product proﬁle of M6G. 
2. M6G shows signiﬁcant reduction in 
post-operative nausea and vomiting 
compared to morphine
The trial results conﬁrm the excellent potential 
of M6G as an analgesic with a clinically 
signiﬁcant improved side effect proﬁle compared 
to morphine. The study results show that 
patients receiving M6G experienced a 28% 
reduction in the severity of PONV in the key  
6 – 24 hours after treatment (statistically 
signiﬁcant, p=0.018) (ﬁgure 6).

PHASE III STUDIES CONTINUED
COMPLETED PHASE III STUDY (M6G022) 
CONTINUED
2. M6G shows signiﬁcant reduction in 
post-operative nausea and vomiting 
compared to morphine continued
In addition, the incidence of dry retching/
vomiting in the M6G arm compared to the 
morphine arm in the 24 hour period after 
treatment was reduced by 32% (statistically 
signiﬁcant, p=0.044) (ﬁgure 7). The incidence 
and severity of post-operative nausea in the 
M6G arm was 27% less than that observed 
in the morphine arm in the period 6–24 hours 
after treatment. This was the second primary 
endpoint and approached statistical 
signiﬁcance (p=0.052) (ﬁgure 5).
3. Patients receiving M6G used 
less anti-emetic drugs
In addition to the clear nausea and vomiting 
reductions of over 25%, secondary data 
revealed that patients receiving M6G required 
over 20% less anti-emetic medication over the 
0–24 hour period than those in the morphine 
group (ﬁgure 9). This shows that not only 
does M6G induce signiﬁcantly less nausea 
and vomiting than morphine, but also that the 
post-operative anti-emetic treatment required 
is considerably reduced. 
The potential for reduced anti-emetic drug 
costs combined with the reduction in medical 
assistance and the improved patient comfort 
due to lower PONV supports CeNeS justiﬁcation 
of a substantial price premium for M6G 
compared to morphine.
4. The Drug consumption proﬁle of M6G 
indicates a long duration of action
It has been shown in previous studies that 
the dose of M6G required to provide analgesia 
immediately after surgery is three times that of 
morphine. In accordance with this, the M6G022 
trial was designed such that M6G was available 
in a 3:1 ratio to morphine during the titration 
to comfort phase. Thereafter pain relief was 
provided using patient controlled analgesia 
(PCA) in a dose ratio of 2:1 (M6G: morphine). 
In the initial phase after surgery the dose 
of M6G required to titrate patients to comfort 
was three times that required for morphine on 
a weight basis. However, during the prolonged 
PCA phase, the ratio was lower (0–24 hours 
1.7:1; 24–48 hours 1.3:1). This shows that 
patients in the M6G group made less 
demands for pain relief after titration to 
comfort, as assessed by presses on the 
PCA button. This data supports the hypothesis 
that M6G has a longer duration of analgesic 
action than morphine. 
5. Patients receiving M6G were less sedated
The M6G022 data show that M6G patients 
experience lower levels of sedation compared 
to those on morphine for up to 48 hours 
(see ﬁgure 8). This reduction is particularly 
noticeable in the severe sedation scores of 
M6G patients in the clinically relevant ﬁrst 
twelve hours after surgery.
6. Safety proﬁle/adverse events
The trial conﬁrmed that M6G’s safety proﬁle 
is similar to morphine. Aside from reduced 
nausea and vomiting, the adverse events 
reported were at levels similar to those 
experienced by patients receiving morphine 
in a post-operative setting.
ADDITIONAL PHASE I STUDIES (M6G023, 
M6G024 AND M6G029)
To provide the relevant Regulatory Authorities 
with additional clinical safety information for 
a Marketing Authorisation Application, three 
further small studies are being carried out:

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
  M6G023 is a mass balance study and is 
designed to show the metabolic rate of an 
IV injection of M6G. To carry out this study, 
low doses of radio-labelled (14c) M6G will 
be administered to six healthy volunteers. 
The disappearance of radio-labelled 
material from the blood and its 
appearance in urine and faeces 
will be determined; 
  M6G024 is a pharmacokinetic study 
in mild and moderate renally impaired 
patients. M6G is excreted from the body 
by the kidney. Deterioration of kidney 
function, therefore, may cause accumulation 
of M6G in that organ. Volunteers with 
normal, mild or moderate renal impairment 
will receive an IV injection of M6G and the 
relative plasma and urine levels of M6G 
will be determined and compared between 
these groups; and 
  M6G029 is the US IND-opening study. 
It is a pharmacokinetic study examining 
dose proportionally and accumulation 
of M6G in volunteers.
THE MARKETS FOR M6G
The global market for opiate use in managing 
post-operative pain was estimated at $1 billion 
in 2000 and growing at a rate of 6–7%. M6G 
represents an attractive alternative for patients 
and healthcare providers with potentially 
signiﬁcant pharmaco-economic beneﬁts 
including a reduction in the use of anti-emetics, 
nursing time and length of hospital stay. 
CeNeS has commissioned two independent 
studies researching the market for M6G in Europe 
and the US. These studies have conﬁrmed 
CeNeS understanding that there is a signiﬁcant 
global market for M6G of around £200 million 
and that the planned price premium is likely to 
be acceptable to physicians and pharmacists 
in hospitals and also the various Government 
reimbursement authorities. These assumptions 
are based on the successful delivery of M6G’s 
potential clinical and health economic beneﬁts. 
PARTNERING STRATEGY
CeNeS has appointed Rodman & Renshaw, 
the US based healthcare specialist investment 
bank, to assist in the partnering of M6G. 
The appointment of Rodman & Renshaw 
strengthens CeNeS ability to manage the 
international partnering process and is in 
keeping with the outsourcing business 
model. The quality of the recently announced 
Phase III data on M6G means that there is a 
comprehensive data package for potential 
partners to review. 
There is a clear need for new drugs that 
can improve the quality of pain management 
currently given to patients by standard morphine 
regimens across the world and M6G is well 
positioned to address that market. CeNeS is 
conﬁdent that agreements can be ﬁnalised 
with partner(s) based on the existing set of 
clinical trial data. Concluding these deals 
will generate short term income and recurring 
revenue streams from a successful product 
launch in the future.

INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF 
POST-OPERATIVE NAUSEA
SEVERITY OF PONV INCIDENCE OF DRY RETCHING/VOMITING
Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7
_02_CEN_ar06_front.indd   11 29/06/2007   10:17:40 REGULATORY STRATEGY
The considerable total numbers of studies 
that have been carried out with M6G have 
also produced an extensive safety database 
for the compound.
Patients who have been administered morphine 
will have been exposed normally to M6G as a 
result of the metabolic processes; approximately 
10% of morphine is converted to M6G in the 
human. This is particularly relevant when there 
has been prolonged treatment with high doses 
of morphine, e.g. to manage cancer related 
pain. When morphine is given over a short 
period of time (e.g. 24 hours) to control 
post-operative pain, M6G is not believed to 
contribute to the analgesia obtained with 
morphine treatment.
CeNeS, therefore, is working towards 
compiling the efﬁcacy and safety data that 
are required by the Regulatory Authorities for 
Market Authorisation Application in Europe. 
CeNeS has also successfully completed the 
additional pre-clinical work that was required 
by the FDA for the US market and had an IND 
application accepted by the FDA in April 2007.
CeNeS preferred strategy is for a partner 
to be involved in the key decisions regarding 
regulatory ﬁling strategies both in Europe 
and in the US. The strong data obtained 
from the most recent Phase III study validates 
the proposed product profile of M6G and 
strengthens CeNeS position with potential 
North American partners. Registration 
could be achieved in the US in 2010 
after conducting two Phase III studies to 
the requirements of the FDA. It is important 
to note that the quality and robustness of 
the clinical data produced by the M6G022 
study signiﬁcantly reduces the risk for the 
development of M6G by enabling optimal 
trial design and the selection of endpoints 
in the remaining Phase III studies. 
In Europe the narrow failure to achieve statistical 
signiﬁcance with the second chosen primary 
endpoint of incidence and severity of nausea 
(p=0.052 not p<0.050) offers three options:
  pursue a filing application in certain 
European countries with the comprehensive 
clinical data package that CeNeS 
has assembled; 
  further strengthen the European package 
by conducting an additional European 
Phase III study which would complete 
in 2008 with product ﬁling in 2009; and
  use the US Phase III trials to support 
the European application, potentially with 
a global partner. 
In March, CeNeS announced the ﬁling of 
its ﬁrst IND application with the US FDA to 
commence clinical studies in the US with 
M6G.  This ﬁling is a key milestone in CeNeS 
history and represents a major step forward 
in the clinical development of M6G. 
The opening trial under this IND will be a 
Phase I pharmacokinetic study in volunteers 
(M6G029). This study was required by the 
FDA as was an additional pre-clinical 
toxicology study. In parallel to conducting 
these two small studies, CeNeS will complete 
the protocol design of the ﬁrst US Phase III 
trial. CeNeS is actively seeking a partner to 
collaborate and fund the Phase III US trials. 
The ﬁling of the IND enhances the package 
of data already available to potential US 
partners for review. 
M6G FOR THE TREATMENT 
OF POST-OPERATIVE PAIN
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
“ THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR NEW DRUGS THAT 
CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PAIN MANAGEMENT 
CURRENTLY GIVEN TO PATIENTS BY STANDARD MORPHINE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (“IP”)
CeNeS has established a signiﬁcant IP portfolio 
comprising patents covering novel synthetic 
routes for the manufacture of M6G, as well as 
key intermediates, novel salts and know-how. 
The Company has two cGMP compliant 
manufacturing contractors in place and the 
primary manufacturer has produced validation 
batches of M6G at the multi-kilogram scale. 
The synthetic process currently used 
by CeNeS is expected to be the least-cost 
manufacturing route for M6G. In addition, 
CeNeS acquired rights to another proprietary 
synthetic method for the manufacture of M6G 
from Innovata plc in March 2006. 
This agreement further strengthened 
CeNeS IP position around M6G. CeNeS also 
expects to beneﬁt from data and marketing 
exclusivity provisions accorded to companies 
that undertake clinical trials, representing a 
period of ten years following ﬁrst approval in 
Europe, and at least ﬁve years following 
approval in the US. In 2006, CeNeS was 
granted a new composition of matter patent 
on a novel salt form of M6G by the European 
Patent Ofﬁce. 
The invention relates to a salt of M6G with 
improved stability and to the therapeutic use 
of the salt. The granted patent is registered 
in 21 European countries. The new patent 
expires in 2022 and has the potential to extend 
and strengthen the protection provided by the 
existing process patents. 
ADDITIONAL FORMULATIONS 
AND MARKETS
If M6G is successful in treating post-operative 
pain using the current IV formulation there 
will be potential for use in other pain indications 
such as chronic pain and also by other routes 
of administration such as epidural and oral 
delivery. Such expansion would signiﬁcantly 
increase the potential peak market sales 
of M6G. An oral formulation could potentially 
be used to treat many of the 2.7 million 
patients who develop cancer each year in 
the US and Europe. The market for oral 
morphine formulations is currently estimated 
at £600 million annually.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
Neuropathic pain represents a signiﬁcant unmet 
medical need and a large, growing market 
opportunity currently worth over $2 billion 
globally. It arises from a range of primary 
diseases or conditions (including cancer, 
diabetes, shingles and HIV/AIDS) that can result 
in nerve damage and subsequently chronic pain. 
Neuropathic pain is difﬁcult to treat and current 
analgesics do not provide adequate relief for 
many patients. This neuropathic pain can be 
described by patients as burning, stinging, 
shooting, aching or electric-shock-like sensations, 
and it can last for many months or years. 
Common features of these abnormal conditions 
include increased temporal summation of pain 
in response to repeated stimulation (“wind-up” 
pain), hyperalgesia (reduced pain threshold and 
exaggerated response to mild noxious stimuli), 
and allodynia (painful response to non-noxious 
stimuli). Drug treatments for neuropathic pain 
represent a signiﬁcant area of unmet medical 
need and a growing market opportunity.
One of the most common forms of neuropathic 
pain is associated with diabetes. It is estimated 
that there are over 13 million patients in the US 
and Europe with diabetes and that over 30% of 
these experience neuropathic pain, which can 
last for many years. In addition, herpes zoster 
infections can lead to shingles and up to 20% 
of the 1.5 to 2.0 million patients in the US and 
Europe with shingles experience neuropathic 
pain, which is often resistant to current 
treatments and can last for many months. 
CURRENT DRUG TREATMENT 
OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Some patients with mild to moderate 
neuropathic pain may respond to simple 
analgesics or non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory 
drugs (“NSAIDs”) but most patients will require 
more specialist drug therapy. Due to the 
difﬁculty in treating neuropathic pain, it can 
account for up to 40% of patients referred to 
specialist pain clinics. The more common 
treatments include tricyclic anti-depressant 
drugs and anti-convulsant drugs, though their 
side effects can be problematic. Additionally, 
many of these drugs are not licensed for the 
treatment of neuropathic pain.
The anti-convulsant gabapentin is currently 
the only oral drug licensed for the treatment 
of neuropathic pain in the UK and had worldwide 
sales of $2.7 billion in 2003, of which a signiﬁcant 
proportion is believed to be for neuropathic 
pain. Gabapentin has a more favourable side 
effect proﬁle than some other anti-convulsants 
but does not work in the majority of neuropathic 
pain patients. Capsaicin cream, commercially 
prepared from dried chilli peppers, is also 
licensed for some types of neuropathic pain 
and may be applied topically. However, it can 
cause initial stinging and this deters some 
patients. Local anaesthetic drugs can also be 
used to provide short term soothing relief from 
neuropathic pain. Opioid analgesics are 
effective for some patients, especially when 
combined with other drugs. 
In extreme cases nerve blocks, nerve 
ablation and spinal analgesia may be 
required to ease this distressing condition. 
There remains a clear need for an effective 
agent with a favourable side effect proﬁle for 
the treatment of neuropathic pain.
GLUTAMATE AND NEUROPATHIC PAIN
Glutamate is a major excitatory transmitter in 
the brain and binds to N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(“NMDA”) receptors on nerves in the spinal 
cord. This mechanism has been implicated in 
the sensitisation of long term pain responses.
Drugs that block the NMDA receptor have 
been shown to be effective in models 
of persistent pain and some of the older 
non-speciﬁc NMDA antagonists have shown 
promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain. 
However, they are often associated with 
unacceptable side effects.
CNS 5161 
CNS 5161 is a novel and selective non-competitive 
NMDA receptor antagonist. It acts by binding 
to a site within the ion-channel associated 
with the NMDA receptor, rather than competing 
with glutamate at the agonist recognition site.

ERGOMED AGREEMENT
In July 2006, CeNeS and ERGOMED entered 
into a revenue sharing and co-development 
agreement whereby the parties intend to 
collaborate on a comprehensive development 
programme for CNS 5161. A detailed product 
plan has been prepared by CeNeS and 
ERGOMED which sets out how the parties will 
collaborate to assemble Phase II data packages.
Under the agreement, CeNeS and ERGOMED 
will work together to assemble a comprehensive 
Phase II data package with the goal of 
demonstrating that CNS 5161 can provide 
sustained pain relief to improve treatment in 
certain pain conditions. Both parties will invest 
their respective expert internal resources and 
contribute funding into the programme to 
cover the external clinical trial costs. Under the 
terms of the agreement, ERGOMED is entitled 
to a share of commercial revenues generated 
from CNS 5161 in a ratio of ERGOMED’s 
investment compared to the total development 
costs. Their share of any revenues generated 
can be increased in the future if ERGOMED, 
in agreement with CeNeS, takes responsibility 
for a further percentage of the investment 
required in the planned Phase II programme.
CNS 5161 CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT 
Following a successful small initial study in 
patients with neuropathic pain (CNS 5161 003), 
CeNeS carried out a further similar proof of 
concept study (CNS 5161 003A) which reported 
positive results in June 2005. In the study, which 
was designed to establish the therapeutic window 
of CNS 5161, the product was associated with 
a clear trend to improvement in pain levels and 
was well tolerated with no instances of the 
psychotomimetic side effects associated with 
some NMDA antagonists. This latter ﬁnding 
conﬁrms CeNeS understanding that CNS 5161 
occupies a unique position in its class.
In partnership with ERGOMED CeNeS plans to 
pursue two development routes for CNS 5161 
in parallel; an IV/subcutaneous infusion 
presentation for the treatment of refractory pain 
in patients with cancer and an adhesive patch 
presentation that can be applied to the skin and 
so provide pain relief over a number of days. 
Initial studies have conﬁrmed the feasibility of 
administering CNS 5161 by the patch route. 
The Company has also completed the 
manufacture of supplies of CNS 5161 material 
sufﬁcient for the next set of clinical trials.
THE MARKETS FOR CNS 5161
CNS 5161 is being developed for a poorly 
treated population of around eight million 
patients suffering from neuropathic pain in the 
major pharmaceutical markets. The neuropathic 
pain market is currently estimated to exceed 
$2 billion worldwide but existing drugs are 
believed to work in only about 30% of patients 
with neuropathic pain. The total available 
market should therefore be signiﬁcantly larger. 
If CeNeS is able to conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of 
CNS 5161 in the treatment of neuropathic pain 
and is able to establish that it is well tolerated 
by patients this could prove to be a valuable 
commercial opportunity. 
Although neuropathic pain is the lead 
therapeutic indication for CNS 5161, clinical 
observations and pre-clinical ﬁndings with 
NMDA antagonists suggest that this drug 
candidate has the potential to prevent or treat 
a wide range of neurological disorders that 
involve neuronal degeneration, altered 
neuronal activity or neuro-inflammation. 
These diseases include Parkinson’s disease, 
Huntington’s disease, epilepsy, addiction, 
multiple sclerosis, AIDS, dementia and the 
neurological complications of certain central 
nervous system injuries and infections.

SEDATION AND ANAESTHESIA
Sedation is required for a wide range of surgical 
and non-surgical procedures. The high cost of 
overnight hospital stays means that there is a 
trend towards day-case procedures. This creates 
a requirement for IV sedative agents that permit 
a rapid and predictable recovery. CNS 7056 has 
the potential to ﬁt this proﬁle. 
CNS 7056 works via a clinically validated 
mechanism as an agonist at the benzodiazepine 
site of the GABA A receptor. Agents with a 
similar mechanism of action have been used 
for many years as sedatives (e.g. midazolam) 
but suffer from relatively long and variable 
durations of action, primarily due to active 
metabolites. CNS 7056 was developed by 
GlaxoSmithKline (“GSK”) to have equivalent 
sedative effects to agents such as midazolam 
but, uniquely, the compound is designed to be 
rapidly broken down in the body to an inactive 
metabolite and consequently to have a very 
short duration of action. 
CNS 7056 is the lead compound of a series 
that was assigned to CeNeS from GSK in 
November 2003. The compound ﬁts very 
well with the CeNeS focus on precedented 
mechanisms and builds on the expertise 
established in the peri-operative area with 
the development of M6G. The design of CNS 
7056 was based on the experience gained at 
GSK with the short acting opiate, remifentanil. 
CNS 7056 is an ester-based drug that is rapidly 
hydrolysed in the body by esterases to an 
inactive metabolite. An attractive potential 
advantage offered by this mechanism of 
deactivation is a predictable onset and offset 
proﬁle, in contrast to midazolam. Pre-clinical 
studies reveal that this compound has a 
signiﬁcantly shorter duration of action than 
midazolam. The lack of reliance on a cytochrome 
P450 for metabolism means less scope for 
drug-drug interactions compared to midazolam 
and should permit its use in patients with 
reduced liver function. This is frequently 
important in the intensive care setting.
SEDATION FOR NON-SURGICAL 
AND SURGICAL PROCEDURES
Sedation is important in a number of settings, 
both non-surgical and surgical. Non-surgical 
procedures where sedation is required include 
endoscopies, bronchoscopies, manipulations 
(such as the re-setting of dislocated limbs) and 
wound dressing. Surgical procedures include 
those performed under local and general 
anaesthesia. Long term treatment with 
sedatives is also employed in the intensive 
care unit. Agents acting as agonists at the 
benzodiazepine site of the GABA A receptor 
such as lorazepam, diazepam and especially 
midazolam are the most commonly used 
sedative agents.
CURRENT SHORT ACTING 
SEDATIVE AGENTS
As the ﬁrst water-soluble benzodiazepine, 
midazolam was seen as a major breakthrough 
when introduced to the market in the early 
1980s. As with other benzodiazepines and 
unlike anaesthetics such as propofol, midazolam 
induces a controlled sedation and has amnesic 
properties. However, midazolam has a number 
of notable drawbacks. These include respiratory 
depression and a prolonged and variable 
duration of action. The latter is due to the 
existence of an active metabolite. Prolonged 
sedation can result in extended hospital 
conﬁnement with resultant increases in costs. 
Another drawback of midazolam is that it is 
mainly metabolised in the liver by a major 
drug-metabolising enzyme (cytochrome 
P450 3A4). This means that drug-drug 
interactions can be problematic as is its 
administration to patients with compromised 
liver function. 
ANAESTHESIA AS AN ADDITIONAL 
INDICATION
On the basis of new and very encouraging 
pre-clinical data, revealing a rapid onset and 
offset of sedative action and rapid metabolism 
by human liver samples, CeNeS is now 
evaluating the potential of CNS 7056 for the 
additional indications of the induction and 
maintenance of anaesthesia. Pre-clinical 
studies to evaluate the potential of CNS 7056 
in these additional indications are being

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
SUMMARY OF 7056 FOR SEDATION
 Pre-clinical studies reveal shorter duration of action than midazolam.
 Trend is towards day case procedures.

undertaken at the University of Strasbourg, 
the University of Adelaide and at an international 
pharmaceutical company. Propofol is used 
widely for the induction and maintenance of 
anaesthesia. Whilst propofol is an extremely 
successful IV anaesthetic, its limitations include 
pain on injection and cardiovascular depression 
(lowering of heart rate and blood pressure). 
The pre-clinical proﬁle of CNS 7056 suggests that 
it may overcome some of these limitations and 
could offer a new paradigm for IV anaesthesia.
THE MARKETS FOR CNS 7056
A large and growing number of surgical 
and non-surgical procedures are conducted 
in hospitals and surgeries worldwide. Many of 
these procedures are conducted under sedation 
rather than general anaesthesia. The worldwide 
sedative/hypnotic market for anaesthesia is 
greater than $1 billion and the US holds a 60% 
share of the value. Midazolam sales reveal that 
this agent is used in a large proportion of 
procedures. Midazolam became generic in 
mid-2000 (US). Prior to becoming generic, sales 
in 1999 were US$450 million. The additional use 
of CNS 7056 as an agent for the induction and 
maintenance of anaesthesia could double the 
potential market opportunity. Propofol is used 
widely for the induction and maintenance of 
anaesthesia in the US, Europe and Japan, 
and its sales during 2002 were approximately 
$500 million. 
CNS 7056 DEVELOPMENT STATUS
The IP position around CNS 7056 was recently 
strengthened when the European, Hong Kong 
and Japanese Patent Ofﬁces granted the 
patent for a series of sedative compounds, 
including CNS 7056. CNS 7056 is progressing 
through pre-clinical development. CeNeS is 
undertaking the pre-clinical development work 
with the intention of ﬁling an IND in the US 
in 2007. CeNeS is planning to conduct the 
ﬁrst proof of concept Phase I in the US study 
because the Company has identiﬁed the US 
as a major potential market for short acting 
sedatives. Unlike many CNS indications, 
it is planned that the clinical proof of concept 
for this compound will be evaluated in the 
Phase I trials, where the onset and offset of 
sedation for CNS 7056 will be examined and 
compared with that of midazolam. Sedative 
effects can readily be monitored in volunteers 
by measuring parameters such as reduction 
of awareness and movement or changes in 
the electrical activity of the brain.

PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative 
disease affecting approximately 2% of the 
population over the age of 65. The symptoms 
of Parkinson’s disease such as tremor, rigidity 
and slowness of movement result from the 
loss of neurones containing the neurotransmitter 
dopamine in parts of the brain responsible for 
controlling movement. 
In line with our stated lower risk approach, 
CeNeS has examined the continuing use of 
L-DOPA as the main treatment of Parkinson’s 
disease and selected a discovery opportunity 
that could signiﬁcantly enhance its effectiveness.
COMT inhibitors are used to ‘smooth’ the 
pharmacokinetics of L-DOPA, the ‘gold 
standard’ therapy for Parkinson’s disease.
Replacement therapy using the precursor 
of dopamine, L-DOPA combined with a 
Dopa-decarboxylase (“DDC”) inhibitor (carbidopa 
or benserazide) is the mainstay of therapy in 
Parkinson’s disease. Catechol-O-methyltransferase 
(“COMT”) is an enzyme that metabolises 
catecholamines such as L-DOPA and 
dopamine and causes a signiﬁcant depletion 
of L-DOPA in the brain and periphery, limiting 
its efficacy. COMT inhibitors essentially 
smooth out the pharmacokinetics of L-DOPA, 
giving patients a longer ‘on’ or functional time 
each day. They also have a sparing effect on 
the dose of L-DOPA required and thus may 
delay the development of motor ﬂuctuations 
and dyskinesias.
CURRENT COMT INHIBITORS
In the mid-to-late 1990s two COMT inhibitors 
were introduced to the market: tolcapone and 
entacapone. However, tolcapone was withdrawn 
from the EU market in late 1998 due to liver 
toxicity, which is unrelated to COMT inhibition. 
Tolcapone has recently been re-introduced to 
the market in Europe but, as in the US, its use 
is severely restricted. As such, entacapone 
(co-marketed by Orion and Novartis) is the 
only unrestricted COMT inhibitor available 
in the major markets. However, entacapone 
has a number of drawbacks, namely a short 
half-life, low oral bioavailability and minimal 
brain penetration. 
COMT INHIBITOR DISCOVERY 
PROGRAMME
Tolcapone and entacapone, in common with 
the majority of known potent COMT inhibitors, 
contain the undesirable 3-nitrocatechol unit 
that is associated with poor oral absorption, 
short plasma half-life and extensive metabolism 
issues. The goal of breaking away from this 
nitrocatechol series has been achieved by 
CeNeS scientists and a number of discrete 
chemical series without the nitrocatechol 
group have been identiﬁed. The COMT 
inhibitor programme was carefully chosen 
by CeNeS in line with our strategy to have 
a low-risk proﬁle and to address a clear 
commercial opportunity. A number of potent 
compounds are now being evaluated in the 
lead optimisation process, prior to selection 
of a development candidate. 
THE POTENTIAL USE OF COMT 
INHIBITORS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
In addition to Parkinson’s disease, a number 
of recent academic publications point to the 
potential use of a COMT inhibitor that acts in 
the brain to improve the profound cognitive 
deﬁcits of schizophrenia. Cognitive disturbances 
often prevent schizophrenics from readjusting 
to society and require patients to be under 
medical care for their entire lives. Despite the 
availability of a variety of current anti-psychotic 
drugs, cognitive disturbances are poorly 
addressed by existing therapies. CeNeS novel 
COMT inhibitors have the potential to address 
this signiﬁcant unmet need. The worldwide 
sales of drugs used to treat schizophrenia 
are US$12 billion. 
THE MARKET FOR COMT INHIBITORS
The global market of drugs for Parkinson’s 
disease was US$1.7 billion in 2003 and is 
predicted to grow to US$3 billion by 2012. 
The growth will arise largely due to the 
increased prevalence of the disease, as a 
result of the ageing population. The use of 
COMT inhibitors is currently growing rapidly. 
COMT inhibitors currently have more than a 
10% share of the Parkinson’s disease market.

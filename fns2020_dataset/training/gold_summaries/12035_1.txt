 07 Persimmon Plc Annual Report 2005 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
OVERVIEW
It gives me great pleasure in my final Chief Executive’s 
Review before I become Chairman to be able to report on
another record set of results for Persimmon. This is especially
so, because as commented upon widely, 2005 was a most
challenging year for the industry.
During the year the market was characterised by uncertainty
and a general lack of confidence amongst potential purchasers
due to concerns over house price stability.
At Persimmon, we were able to respond to these more
demanding conditions in a number of ways. We started 2005
with a good forward order book despite a relatively quiet
autumn period in 2004. We had ensured that we had increased
outlets for marketing during the early months of 2005 and
continued to focus on forward selling ahead of construction 
on all our sites during this important sales period.
We also ensured that, through our local teams, we remained
flexible with the type, specification and price range of homes
we were offering to the market. Through this process we
experienced a greater demand in some areas for lower priced
properties in preference to some of our mid price range homes,
which in some regions, resulted in an increase in volumes at a
reduced average selling price.
Core housing completions were 11,350 (2004: 11,273) 
and Charles Church completions for the year were 1,286 
(2004: 1,087) giving total completions for the Group of
12,636 (2004: 12,360). The Group’s average selling price
increase of 5% reflects these changes of mix as well as some
real price growth. In summary, we believe we demonstrated
our resilience in tougher market conditions.
NORTH
This division completed 4,962 units, slightly down on 
2004, offset by a 5% increase in average selling price to
£162,737 from £154,287. Whilst the strongest region during
2005 was Scotland, the performance of all regions in the 
North division was satisfactory.
Our focus on maintaining a good spread of product across the
mid to lower end of the range has once again stood us in good
stead. Whilst the market was undoubtedly tougher in the north
the relatively low level of average selling price has ensured that
we have performed well.
SOUTH
The South division performed well once again increasing the
number of completions to 6,388 from 6,187 in 2004. Average
selling price increased by only 1% during 2005. This was partly
due to a shift to more smaller homes as we responded to local
market requirements. Our Western region for example, which
covers South Wales and the South West of England, performed
particularly well with increased completions of 15% to 2,503
(2004: 2,183) at a reduced average selling price of £178,988
(2004: £183,768). This was achieved by ensuring that the
appropriate product mix was available to the market.
CHARLES CHURCH
This brand continued to increase its coverage of the UK.
The investments we have made both in management time 
and financial commitment have established a strong platform
for growth. During 2005 we increased volumes by 18% to
1,286 homes (2004: 1,087). Average selling price also increased
by 11% to £283,260 (2004: £254,810). There are many sites in
the Westbury portfolio that are particularly well suited to the
Charles Church product, which will result in a step change in
the volumes achieved in this business over the next few years.

BUILD
Once again we experienced an increase in our build costs in 
all areas of our business. Whilst we originally expected
significant pressure on material costs, in the event we were 
able to keep these increases to a minimum. Pressure on labour
price increases were also resisted reasonably well. Undoubtedly
our scale of business and the continuity we are able to offer 
to our preferred suppliers and contractors is an advantage in
this respect. As a result total build cost increases were similar 
to the previous year at c. 4%.
LANDBANK
Whilst we continued to exercise discipline and caution
regarding the replacement of our landbank, we were able 
to increase the number of plots owned and under control 
to 63,336 plots (2004: 59,947 plots) including c. 800 plots 
from the Senator Homes purchase. Our plot cost to selling
price ratio is 19.3% (2004: 19.1%).
Additionally we had c. 19,000 acres of strategic land owned 
or under option. This portfolio continues to successfully
deliver c. 25% of the new plots we acquire each year. This year
was no exception with specific successes in Yorkshire (1,200
plots), at Bracknell (750 plots), Bridgwater (750 plots) and
Peterborough (1,150 plots). We continue to invest in this 
aspect of our business and are confident that it will be a 
source of further significant successes in the short, medium
and long term.
Following the acquisition of Westbury we now have over
78,000 plots owned and under control in the enlarged 
Group, representing c. 4
1
/ 2 years supply, in addition to a total 
of c. 25,000 acres in our strategic land portfolio. The Westbury
strategic land portfolio of c. 6,000 acres has many interesting
and exciting opportunities to develop over future years.
WESTBURY INTEGRATION
As referred to in the Chairman’s Statement, we have
successfully completed the initial stages of the integration 
of Westbury.
All acquired sites were rebranded immediately to either
Persimmon or Charles Church. This was an important factor
in establishing the appropriate background for the enlarged
Group which will ensure the ongoing successful integration 
of the acquired business.
In the five weeks we have owned the business we have closed
eight of the ten Westbury offices. We have also consulted fully
with all affected office based staff resulting in c. 500 leaving the
Company. We have retained the appropriate number of high
quality senior managers and office staff, whilst at site level there
have been no significant staffing changes. We are currently
reviewing site layouts, designs, mix of product and
specifications in order to maximise the development potential
on all the acquired developments.
Our task is also to ensure that build costs are improved on 
the Westbury sites by capturing improved procurement and
sub-contractor costs. This process is at an early stage due to 
the phasing of construction works, but is already producing
success.
All these efforts will ensure we maximise the synergy benefits
on integrating Westbury into the enlarged Group which we
believe will be c. £25 million in 2006 and c. £40 million in each
year from 2007 onwards. We estimate that we will incur one-off
costs of integration of c. £12 million in achieving our plans at
this stage.
We have maintained the Westbury Partnerships brand to
provide a focus on working with the Government in its 
efforts to increase the supply of affordable homes. We have set
up a small specialist and dedicated team at the Westbury
Partnerships office in Gloucester to drive this business 
forward over future years.
The Space4 manufacturing business represents a good
opportunity to work more closely with Westbury Partnerships
and the Government’s agenda regarding Modern Methods of
Construction. We believe that given the volume of homes
produced by the enlarged Persimmon Group and by working
closely with specialist Westbury Partnerships we can begin to
make good progress with Space4.
The only other ex-Westbury office to remain open is in 
South Wales which becomes the new Charles Church Wales
office. This brings the total number of Charles Church
businesses to ten.
In order to ensure the successful management of the enlarged
business, which we expect to deliver c. 17,000 units per annum
after 2006, we have restructured our Divisional Management 
to create an additional “Central” region. We have increased our
divisions from two to three, namely Central, North and South.
We now have the management in place to deliver further
growth as and when the market conditions are supportive.

David Thornton aged 48, who until recently was Deputy 
Chief Executive for the South Division working closely with
Mike Farley, is now Divisional Chief Executive for the Central
Division. David has had a number of roles with Persimmon in
his 14 years with the Group. The North is led by Jeff Fairburn
aged 39, previously Managing Director and Regional Chairman
of the North East with 16 years experience with Persimmon.
The new South Division will be under the leadership of Nigel
Greenaway aged 45. Nigel has recently been a Managing
Director and Regional Chairman for Persimmon in South
Midlands and has 19 years experience with the Group.
This management structure will ensure that we continue to
drive the enlarged business forward, whilst maintaining our
ability and focus on quick decision making at local levels.
CURRENT TRADING OUTLOOK
In the eight weeks since the beginning of this year we have
detected an increase in purchasers’ confidence and the ability
and desire to buy a new home.
Visitor levels have been good and new reservations have been
encouraging. Whilst it is too early in the New Year to predict
the market, it is nevertheless a good start to the year.
We are continuing to be realistic about price expectations to
ensure satisfactory levels of sales are achieved. Our part-
exchange scheme continues to support sales whilst we have
seen a reduction in the use of incentives in some areas.
Our current total sales at over 7,000 homes with a value of c.
£1.25 billion at an average selling price of £178,500 are at a
level we would expect and gives us confidence for the year as
we enter the start of the most important sales period for new
homes. We expect to open over 300 new developments during
2006 which will provide good support to our sales activity
throughout the year.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
We have made good progress with regard to matters
concerning our corporate responsibility. Improvements have
been made in all areas, especially in training of our staff,
environmental issues and health and safety.
The Group continues to support the development of new
talent in the industry and this year we were awarded “Best
Training and Staff Initiative” at the HouseBuilding Innovation
Awards, recognising our commitment to training at apprentice,
school leaver and graduate level.
Our Corporate Responsibility Report, which gives more details
on all these issues within our business, can be viewed on our
website, www.persimmonhomes.com.
SUMMARY
We are pleased to have achieved such a strong result for the
Group for 2005. However, our efforts and focus are now very
much concentrated on looking forward, successfully
integrating the Westbury acquisition and continuing to 
achieve further success.
We have an experienced team, great landbank, proven track
record and a commitment to succeed. We also have a strong
sales position, the appropriate level of investment in land and
work in progress in all parts of the UK and great benefits of
scale which we can utilise to support our margins. We are
therefore in an excellent position for the future.
I am certain that the commitment we have amongst our staff
at all levels, both new and long-serving, will ensure that we
continue to achieve the best possible results whatever market
conditions we encounter over future years.
I know that Mike Farley, who becomes Group Chief Executive
following the AGM on 20 April 2006, and our team will
continue to grow the business with great success.

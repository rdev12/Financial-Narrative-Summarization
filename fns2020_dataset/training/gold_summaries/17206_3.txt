 4 Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 
Chairman’s statement
The strength of our customer relationships and the quality of our
services have been, and will continue to be, key to our success.
David Malpas, Chairman
On behalf of the Board I thank all 
the Group’s employees, whose
enthusiasm, commitment and
professionalism have produced
another year of strong operational
and financial performance. The
strength of our customer
relationships and the quality of our
services have been, and will continue
to be, key to our success and are a
direct consequence of the quality of
our people.
Wincanton has reported another
period of financial and strategic
progress for the year to 31 March
2006. Group operating profit of
£42.0m (2005 : £39.3m) grew by 
6.9 per cent, profit before tax by 9.5
per cent and earnings per share by
17.8 per cent (in each case stated 
on an underlying basis which excludes
amortisation of acquired intangibles
and exceptionals). Group operating
profit, including these items was
£41.0m (2005 : £37.4m). Cash flow
performance was again strong, with
only a marginal increase in year-end
net debt to £60.6m, in spite of a 
near £38m outflow as a result of an
acquisition and a cash injection into
the Group’s pension fund.
The underlying strength of
Wincanton’s trading performance
and another year of good cash flow
generation have given the Board the
confidence to propose a full year
dividend of 12.54p per share. This
represents a 10.0 per cent increase
on the dividend paid last year.
Including this dividend the Group’s
annualised rate of dividend increase
since its demerger in May 2001 now
stands at 7.9 per cent per annum. These
dividend increases, combined with a
good share price performance, have
generated a T otal Shareholder Return
of 90.8 per cent since demerger. This
represents, as at 31 March 2006, an
out-performance relative to the FTSE-
250 of 26.4 per cent. 
In the five years since demerger,
Wincanton has strengthened its
position in the UK & Ireland and
established a platform for growth
across Continental Europe. The
Group’s full growth potential is yet 
to be realised, but solid progress is
being made towards our goal of
leadership in European supply 
chain services.
Our markets are fragmented, and
there are opportunities for further
consolidation through acquisition. 
In October 2005 we announced 
the purchase of the principal French
logistics activities of Premium
Logistics (‘Premium’). Premium
significantly strengthens our
operational capabilities in the important
French market. Our enlarged French
business now offers national
coverage from some 30 sites, giving
a substantially stronger and broader
business base from which we will be
able to serve both the French and
cross-border requirements of our
blue-chip customer base. Other
potential acquisitions are under
review as a means of accelerating
either the expansion of our service
offering or the further strengthening
of our European presence.
I take this opportunity of welcoming
Graeme McFaull to his new role as
Chief Executive. Graeme, who took
over from Paul Bateman in
December 2005, previously led our
operations in the UK & Ireland
through a period of very significant
growth and development. He has the
support of a highly experienced and
committed senior team and I am sure
that Wincanton will enjoy continuing
success under his leadership.
The Board also welcomes Jonson Cox
who has joined us as a non-executive
Director during the year and whose
contribution is much appreciated.
Peter Brown left the Board in
February 2006, and I thank him for 
his contribution to the Group over
many years.
Our markets remained challenging
and competitive in the year under
review. High levels of new business
activity nonetheless again enabled 
us to take market pressures and
contract losses in our stride and 
still show good net profit progress.
Annualised turnover from contract
wins and renewals totalled
approximately £385m compared 
to last year’s £250m.
Our operations in the UK & Ireland
reported underlying operating profit
of £37.8m, up 3.6 per cent on the
previous year. Fee pressure is evident
in certain of the more mature areas of
our activities but we continue to see
opportunities for growth across our
retail, manufacturing and industrial
“” Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 5
customer bases. The market for
supply chain services in the UK &
Ireland has become more polarised in
recent years, and Wincanton, as one
of the two leading operators, has
benefited from its greater scale and
the loss of market share by smaller
operators. This trend is expected to
continue to be of benefit to the Group
in the future. We also continue to
have confidence in the growth
potential of our portfolio of ancillary
services, which includes consultancy,
data records management, waste
recycling and fleet maintenance. 
Underlying operating profit in
Continental Europe grew by 7.1 per
cent, excluding our French acquisition,
and by 50.0 per cent, to £4.2m,
including our French acquisition. 
The progress in underlying profit 
was achieved in spite of the early
termination in February 2005 of the
key customer contract managed by
PGN, a jointly owned entity. This
contract, which remains subject to
arbitration proceedings, was an
important contributor to Continental
European profitability in 2004/05.
A more rapid and substantial
improvement in the profit
performance of Continental Europe
remains a key objective for us. There
is a high degree of operational
leverage in our asset base which, if
volume growth can be accelerated,
will have a positive effect upon
reported profit. Management teams
have been strengthened in a number
of countries, including the
recruitment of a new managing
Director in Germany, and the new
teams will be supported by higher
levels of investment in marketing and
business development. Raising the
brand awareness of Wincanton
across Continental Europe, improving
the performance of certain loss-
making activities and ensuring the
delivery of consistent service
excellence across borders will be key
to further performance improvement.
The Continental European businesses
remain fundamental to our strategy
and we are confident that, over time,
they will generate significant profit
and cash flow for the Group.
Our strategy of offering our customers
national, regional and Pan-European
services is generating enhanced
opportunities for growth. As a
consequence of successful acquisition
and the continuing organic growth of
existing operations, Wincanton 
has positioned itself as one of the
leading supply chain management
companies in Europe. We continue 
to see attractive potential, both
organically and through acquisition,
for Wincanton to consolidate and
develop this position as a European
industry leader. We have confidence
in the Group’s ability to build further
on the achievements of recent years.
Sustaining growth momentum in the
UK & Ireland and delivering more
satisfactory levels of profitability in
Continental Europe will bring many
challenges in 2006/07. Our objective
is nonetheless for the new year to be
another period of progress towards
realising our operational, financial and
strategic goals. We expect 2006/07 
to again confirm Wincanton’s ability
to generate value for shareholders
by adding value for customers.

Chief Executive’s Review
I am delighted to present my first review as Chief Executive of o2o. Against the
background of a challenging marketplace, o2o has delivered its seventh
consecutive year of revenue growth. I believe that the Group has the ability to
take full advantage of market opportunities and I am privileged to be leading
the business at this exciting time in its development. 
In my role as Chief Executive I have
visited every part of the Group and
met with customers, employees and
investors. This process has confirmed
that o2o is more than a contract
stationer. In fact, it offers a wide
range of business products and
related services, supported by its
capability in managing complex
supply chains.
Prior to my arrival, the Board had
commissioned a review of our
strategies, processes and operational
practices in order to take stock of the
business. The review identified the
necessity for a fundamental
restructuring of the business and, as
a result of this, coupled with the
opportunity afforded by withdrawing
from MoD supply, we have taken
action to improve operational
efficiency and reduce the cost base
of the business to more closely
reflect its needs. 
A changing market
The office and related products
supply market has undergone major
changes over the last few years.
These include the emergence of 
e-auctions, erosion of profit margins
due to product cost increases, public
sector account consolidation and a
succession of competitor mergers
which have contributed substantially
to changing many working practices. 
o2o needs to adapt and innovate
within a market that is highly
competitive and growing steadily.
The market for office products
remains relatively stable and the
opportunities to extend the range of
products and services are significant.
Strategy
Over the last six months we have
built a simplified structure focused
on how we add value as a business,
which will enable us to be quick to
react, flexible in operation and
focused on doing fewer things better.
The Board is confident that there is
scope to drive further improvements
in the coming year. We remain
consistent in our aim to grow the
business by enlarging and
diversifying our customer base. The
key objective for 2008 is to continue
the expansion of our routes to
market beyond our traditional large
contracted office supplies base and
extend our service and product
ranges. It is intended that this will be
achieved both through organic
growth and by taking advantage of
suitable acquisition opportunities
when they arise. 
Organisation structure
Our new organisation is based on:
•
simplicity, clarity and focus to
create value for our customers;
•
sourcing products to optimise
total product cost; and
•
flexible distribution facilities to
deliver on our promises to
customers.
The combination of these elements
firmly positions us as a major player
in the provision of business products
and services to the UK and Irish
markets.  o2o plc Annual Report 2007 5
We have now structured the Group’s
trading operations to reflect our
three complementary core services.
• Banner Business Supplies Limited
(Banner)
Banner is a market leader in the
provision of medium and long-term
contract management and the
procurement of office and business
products for large private and public
sector customers. Banner excels in
the management of complex, 
multi-level business relationships.    
• Supply chain
The Group’s integrated supply chain
activity procures, manages, picks and
nationally distributes over 15,000
office and other business products. It
consolidates our warehousing,
distribution and procurement
activities to drive operating efficiency.
Acquisition of smaller, locally
branded office and other business
product supply companies will create
additional revenue streams to build
critical sales volume to which we will
add o2o supply chain support.    
• Business services 
Although our service offering is still
in its infancy, we believe through our
existing customer base, we can
create a significant presence in the
business services sector, by offering
our customers added-value services
including print management,
document management and storage,
technology and business furniture.       
This revised organisation structure
recognises that o2o is more than a
stationer and promotes its
development as a leading business
supplies, integrated supply chain and
managed services group committed
to delivering on our promises and
adding value at every stage of the
process. 
Expanding our customer base
A core element of our strategy is to
win new customers through organic
sales growth. We already supply
office products and solutions to
businesses and organisations of all
sizes across the UK and Ireland in
what is a relatively fragmented
market and we have teams dedicated
to winning new customers.
Broadening our range of
products and services
The availability of a wide range of
products and services from a single
supplier is important to many of our
customers and we aim to offer just
that. Experience has proved that we
can deliver significant customer
benefits through a rationalised
supplier base and by consolidating
the management of large volumes of
low-value transactions.  
Developing innovative solutions
to meet the changing needs of
customers 
Central to the Group’s performance is
meeting the ever-changing needs of
its customers. Changes in
technology, purchasing patterns,
customer priorities and service
requirements are a feature of our
business. We encourage innovation
and remain flexible to the adoption
of new ideas at all levels.   6
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Growth by acquisition
We continue to monitor and evaluate
potential acquisition opportunities.
Our criteria include the ability to
extract cost or revenue synergies and
the potential for the target to grow
profitability.
Management structure
We have reconfigured our senior
management better to reflect the
growth opportunities identified as
part of the strategic review. 
The senior management comprises a
streamlined team with clearly defined
responsibilities to deliver our growth
plans. They will oversee specific
business functions and teams. 
Mark Cunningham, in addition to the
responsibilities of the Finance
Director role, is currently charged
with the reorganisation of the
logistics, warehousing and operations
functions. It is envisaged that this will
be complete by the end of 2008.
Mark Goddard, Chief Financial Officer,
leads the Group’s finance team and is
providing additional support to the
Finance Director whilst the
reorganisation is implemented. Geoff
Streetley, who leads Banner and is
responsible for growing the contract
office products customer base,
became Chief Commercial Officer.
Steve McKeever, who joined us in
December as Chief Information
Officer, is responsible for delivering
best in class e-commerce and
business processes. 
The Board remains unchanged,
however members of the senior
management team attend meetings
on a regular basis to update on
progress and developments in their
business areas. 
Employees 
We recognise that the success of o2o
is a reflection of the success of our
people and I would personally like to
thank our management and all our
employees for their contribution and
for their patience and perseverance
through a difficult period. 
We aim to recruit and retain the best
people in the business supplies
industry. At o2o, our people have a
broad range of talents and
backgrounds. Our customers rely on
the combined efforts of around 800
people to manage relationships and to
deliver the right products and services
when and where they are needed. 
The Group operates a variety of
schemes to allow employees to
participate directly in the success of
the business. These include a Save-
As-You-Earn share option scheme
with a broad participation in
addition to more targeted schemes
for senior employees. 
I would like to express my thanks to
the Chairman, David Callear, who
stepped in and assumed executive
responsibility after my predecessor
left the business in February 2007.
Many of the initiatives and actions
taken during the ensuing period
strengthened the business for the
challenges faced during the
remainder of 2007.
Future prospects
o2o is a solid business with real
prospects for longer-term growth
both organically and by acquisition.
The strategic review has delivered
clarity of vision and purpose and we
expect future acquisitions to deliver
growth. We believe in getting the
basics right - delivering on our
promises, achieving demonstrable
and consistent growth, a
commitment to sustainable
performance and enhancing
shareholder value. 
We have a growing customer base, a
strong management team, a
passionate and motivated workforce
and a flexible business model proven
to react quickly to market changes.
Our market will remain competitive
but our commitment to contain
operating costs and drive efficiencies
should enable us to deliver our
growth plans.

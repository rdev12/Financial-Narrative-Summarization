Group Directory IBC
The year saw strong turnover growth as a result of a
number of new products being introduced into growing
markets.  Photographic continues to benefit from an
increase in demand for digital SLR cameras, whilst the
Broadcast market is slowly improving.
We start 2005 in a much stronger position than at the
same time last year, with higher order books and rising
volumes. Going forward, Vitec remains exposed to
fluctuations in the US dollar, but, as a result of
restructuring actions taken in recent years, the Group
is now in better shape. Overall the Board views the
outlook for 2005 with cautious optimism.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIALS
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
This strong performance was underpinned 
by growth across both emerging and 
established recruitment markets, permanent, 
interim and contract recruitment and 
recruitment process outsourcing, reflecting 
the Group’s strategic objectives of building 
a truly global and diversified specialist 
professional recruitment business.
Revenue was up 20% (24%*) to £812.7m 
(2014: £679.6m) and gross profit (net fee 
income) increased by 9% (12%*) to £234.4m 
(2014: £215.3m). Operating profit was up 27% 
(29%*) to £23.1m (2014: £18.2m) and earnings 
per share increased by 35% to 20.6p per 
share (2014: 15.3p per share). The Group 
has further strengthened its balance sheet 
with net cash of £17.8m as at 31 December 
2015 (31 December 2014: £14.3m). 
Permanent recruitment represents 69% 
(2014: 69%) of recruitment net fee income.
In line with the growth we have seen 
across the business, headcount has 
increased by 11% to 2,916 (2014: 2,631). 
A significant proportion of the headcount 
increase has been within our recruitment 
process outsourcing business, Resource 
Solutions, as a result of increased service 
penetration into existing clients and a 
number of international client wins.
The Board will be recommending an 18% 
increase in the final dividend to 5.13p per 
share which combined with the interim 
dividend of 1.95p per share would result in a 
total dividend of 7.08p per share (2014: 6.0p). 
In 2015, 0.2m shares were purchased at an 
average price of £3.63 for £0.8m through the 
Group’s Employee Benefit Trust. A further 
1.1m shares have been purchased at an 
average price of £3.31 for £3.6m since 
31 December 2015. The Board is authorised 
to re-purchase up to 10% of the Group’s 
issued share capital and will be seeking 
approval for the renewal of this authority at 
the Annual General Meeting on 9 June 2016.
In January 2016, Giles Daubeney was 
promoted to the role of Deputy CEO.  
The appointment was made as part of the 
Group’s planning for the future, to ensure 
appropriate succession. In his new role, 
Giles is working more closely with myself 
and the rest of the Board, taking a more 
active role in the Group’s strategy and its 
engagement with the City and Investor 
Relations. Giles has maintained the 
responsibilities of his previous role of Chief 
Operating Officer. There are no plans for 
Robert Walters, CEO, to leave the business. 
Last but certainly not least, I would like 
to express my sincere thanks to all of the 
Group’s staff across the globe for their 
ongoing drive, hard work and commitment 
to delivering a premium, high-quality 
service to our candidates and clients.

 Chairman’s Statement 02
With nearly half our sales in North
America and over 94% to countries
other than the UK, movements in
foreign currency are important. In 
this respect, the weakness of the US
Dollar throughout the period had a
signiﬁcant adverse impact on our
overall performance when viewed in
Sterling terms, although this was
mitigated, to a limited extent, by
slightly stronger Euro and Yen rates.
Translated at the exchange rates
prevailing in the prior year, turnover
would have been higher by £4.9
million and proﬁt before tax would
have been higher by £1.3 million,
only marginally below the prior year
reported ﬁgure. Headline earnings per
share would have been 1.4 pence per
share higher, equivalent to growth of
more than 5%.
Dividends
Given our overall performance and
the strong cash generation over the
period your Board has decided to
recommend an increase in the ﬁnal
dividend to 6.4 pence per share
(2003: 6.1 pence) bringing the total
dividend for the year to 9.9 pence per
share (2003: 9.5 pence), an increase of
4%. The dividend is covered 2.8 times
(2003: 2.9 times) by headline earnings.
Results
It gives me great pleasure to report
that the Group performed well over
the year despite little improvement in
market conditions and continued
adverse currency movements. In
addition, a number of acquisitions
were made which bring signiﬁcant
added depth to the business and are
an important step in the development
of our established strategic plan,
which I mention below.
Proﬁt before tax, goodwill and
exceptional items was a little lower
than last year at £23.9 million (2003:
£25.5 million), but headline earnings
1
per share were slightly up at 27.3
pence per share (2003: 27.2 pence).
Basic earnings per share more than
doubled to 15.4 pence per share
(2003: 7.6 pence). Turnover for the
year was £118.8 million (2003:
£127.6 million). Our ongoing efforts
to reduce the cost base of the business
and constantly to seek efﬁciency gains
enabled us to maintain an operating
margin
2
in excess of 20%. The cash
generative qualities of our businesses
continue to be excellent and free cash
ﬂow
3
increased to £22.0 million
(2003: £19.7 million).

Board Changes
On 28th January 2004, the Group
announced two Board changes. 
The ﬁrst was that Michael Firth had
joined the Board and the second was
that John Salmon had decided to 
step down.
Michael, aged 61, is currently a Non-
Executive Director of Somerﬁeld plc,
where he is Chairman of the Audit
Committee, and a Non-Executive
Director of communisis plc, where he
is the Senior Independent Director
and Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee. Previously, Michael was
Head of Corporate Banking within
HSBC Bank plc until his retirement
on 30th September 2002.
John was appointed in January 2002,
and was formerly Chairman and
Chief Executive of Druck Holdings
plc. The Board was sad to see John go
as he brought strategic insight, a real
understanding of our market place
and that rare commodity, common
sense, to our deliberations. I would
like to thank John for his most
valuable contribution to the business
and wish him well in the future.
Acquisitions
In the second half of the ﬁnancial 
year the Group completed two small
acquisitions; shortly after the year end,
another acquisition was completed
and a tender offer was launched to
purchase BW Technologies Limited
(BWT), a Canadian public company
listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The offer was successful and BWT
became a member of the Group
effective 15th June 2004. You will
ﬁnd more details on each of these
businesses in the accompanying Chief
Executive’s Review. Considerable effort
went into ﬁnding and evaluating 
each of these acquisitions and the
important task of integrating them
within the Group is well underway.
Taken together, these acquisitions
represent an important step in the
future development of our strategic
plan and especially the Gas Sensing
division. They bring a number of
immediate beneﬁts including greater
geographic reach, the opening of new
market sectors for our established
businesses and a signiﬁcant
strengthening of our product
development activities. Two of the
recently acquired businesses are based
in Germany, which we regard as the
technology hub of Europe, and it has
been our ambition to strengthen our
presence in this important market 
for some time. As a result of these
acquisitions, we are in a better
position to exploit all our markets and
we expect our brand recognition to
grow faster in the longer term.
Prospects
Our strategic focus continues to be
aimed at building a global sensing
business in the areas of safety and the
environment. These are markets which
are developing and which your Board
believes have good future prospects.
Ongoing efforts to improve efﬁciency
through increased levels of activity in
the Dominican Republic and growing
component sourcing in the Far East
are both meeting with success. 
Whilst markets remain difﬁcult it 
is encouraging to report that the
North American economy is moving
forward, if somewhat slowly. This is
most encouraging for the Group given
that almost half of our sales are made
into that market.
The business continues to enjoy
healthy proﬁt margins and strong cash
generation.
Your Board remains convinced that
our established strategy, which is
driving both organic development and
acquisitions, means we are in a strong
position to leverage our core skills and
our talented employees to improve in
all markets.

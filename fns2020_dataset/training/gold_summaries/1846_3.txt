CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
T
his has been a year 
of rapid progress and 
we have again delivered 
on our key objectives 
of increasing profitability and 
reducing overall indebtedness. 
Profit before tax and exceptional 
items increased by 159.3% to 
£110.7m and net debt reduced 
by nearly 50% to £167 .7m. This 
has been achieved against 
a challenging backdrop of 
economic and consumer 
uncertainty, coupled with 
continuing restrictions on the 
availability of adequate mortgage 
finance, particularly with higher 
loan to value (‘LTV’) products.
The market
The UK housing market has 
remained broadly stable, although 
there were regional variations in 
demand and pricing. Whilst the 
country’s housing needs continue 
to grow, the number of new 
homes being built will only see a 
sustainable increase with a step 
change in mortgage lending.
Some progress was made 
during the year in terms of the 
availability of finance for our 
customers, with higher LTV in the 
new build sector seeing a gradual 
improvement. The launch in July 
2011 of the Government-backed 
FirstBuy shared equity scheme 
has helped to stimulate improved 
demand from first-time buyers. 
The launch, in March 2012, of the 
Government-backed NewBuy 
mortgage indemnity scheme 
should ensure that this progress 
continues by effectively increasing 
to 95% the LTV available to buyers 
of new homes.
Our performance
During the year we made 
significant financial and operational 
improvements across every 
aspect of our business. We have 
further increased our capability 
and our efficiency. We are 
financially stronger and the quality 
of our land bank has improved. 
The objectives of rebuilding 
profitability and reducing overall 
indebtedness, independent 
This has been a year of significantly 
improved financial performance for the 
Group, and we continue to lead the industry 
in levels of quality and customer service.

of further market improvement, 
are progressing well.
Ensuring that we achieve 
the best price for the homes that 
we build remains a priority and is 
dependent on getting the location, 
product mix, design, branding, 
quality, marketing of our homes 
and customer service absolutely 
right. We have continued to invest 
in all of these areas and our 
industry leadership in the way 
our sites are managed and the 
customer ratings we achieve have 
been externally acknowledged. 
For the third consecutive year 
the Group has been awarded 
Home Builder Federation (‘HBF’) 
5-Star status. This is the highest 
achievable level in terms of 
customer satisfaction and 
recommendation. In addition, 
under the National House-Building 
Council (‘NHBC’) ‘Pride in the Job’ 
scheme our site managers have 
won more quality awards than any 
other housebuilder for the eighth 
consecutive year.
Our new house types are 
even more in tune with customer 
preference and our sales teams 
are supported by an enhanced 
online sales and marketing 
capability. We remain committed 
to the principles of getting it right 
first time, enhancing the customer 
experience and reducing the cost 
of doing business.
Investing in land 
for higher returns
The primary driver of the Group’s 
profit growth was the increased 
proportion of completions from 
newer, higher margin land. During 
the period 4,381 completions 
(35%) were on newer, higher 
margin land and in 2012/13 we 
expect this to increase to just over 
50% of completions. The land we 
have bought since re-entering the 
land market in 2009 currently 
meets or exceeds the minimum 
hurdle rates set on acquisition – 
namely, a 20% gross margin and 
a 25% return on capital based on 
operating profit.
Dividend policy
No dividend will be paid in respect 
of the 2011/12 financial year. 
However, the Board recognises 
the importance of both capital 
growth and dividend income 
to our existing and potential 
shareholders and is committed 
to re-introducing the payment of 
dividends. Assuming a continuing 
stable housing market, the Board 
expects to recommence dividend 
payments, with a conservative 
dividend cover, by proposing 
a final dividend in respect of the 
financial year to 30 June 2013, 
payable in the final quarter of 
2013. The Board intends to 
adopt a progressive dividend 
policy as profitability grows, with 
the aim, over time, of achieving a 
target dividend cover of around 
three times.
In addition, we remain 
committed to operating with 
an appropriate land bank and 
continuing to reduce overall 
indebtedness.
The Board
In April 2012, Richard Akers joined 
us as a Non-Executive Director. 
He has broad business experience 
and a deep knowledge of the 
property market from a 
commercial and retail perspective, 
complementing the existing 
skills of the Board. 
In July 2012, Clive Fenton 
resigned as a Director of the 
Company and we appointed 
Steven Boyes to a new role 
of Chief Operating Officer 
responsible for housebuilding 
operations. Steven, who joined 
the Board in 2001, is one of the 
most experienced housebuilding 
executives in the UK.
In July 2012, we also announced 
that Bob Davies, after eight years 
of service, will step down as a 
Non-Executive Director at the 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) 
in November this year. Subject 
to their election and re-election at 
the AGM, Mark Rolfe will take over 
as Senior Independent Director 
and Richard Akers will take over 
as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee. I would like to thank 
Bob for the outstanding 
contribution that he has made 
to the Group during a period 
of immense change.
Our employees
The rapid progress we have made 
this year, in a market that remains 
challenging, is a great credit  
to the management of the 
Group and its employees. There 
is a wealth of experience within 
the leadership team, ably 
supported by our employees 
across the country. On behalf 
of the Board I would like to thank 
them for their commitment and 
outstanding contribution to the 
Group’s performance. 
The future
Inevitably there is ongoing 
economic uncertainty in the UK 
market and as such we do not 
expect to see significant growth 
in customer demand over the 
next year. However, the strategy 
we are pursuing is capable of 
delivering significantly enhanced 
returns without an improvement 
in market conditions. 
We operate throughout 
Great Britain and across a broad 
spectrum of the market. We are 
able to deliver a wide range of 
housing projects from traditional 
housing to complex high-rise 
apartment buildings, such as those 
we build in London. We believe 
that this capability, coupled with 
our focus on improving the 
efficiency of everything we do and 
having the best people to deal with 
an increasingly complex regulatory 
and planning environment, offer us 
a significant competitive advantage.

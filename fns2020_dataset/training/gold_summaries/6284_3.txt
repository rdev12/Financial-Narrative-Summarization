 In the continuing difficult market conditions of low demand and severe price pressure prevailing in
commercial print, the group’s performance, achieving an increase in pre-tax profit before exceptionals for
the year ended 31 December 2002, is particularly creditable.
The figures in this paragraph disregard the exceptional items referred to below. Turnover for the year
increased by 4.6% to £41.58m from £39.74m. Operating profit increased by 2.9% to £3.85m (2001:
£3.74m), representing an operating margin of 9.3% (2001: 9.4%). Pre-tax profit was up 4.6% at £3.01m
(2001: £2.88m), representing a pre-tax margin of 7.2% (2001: 7.2%). Earnings per share increased to 
7.3p from 6.6p (restated for the implementation of FRS19 relating to deferred taxation). 
The £1.07m exceptional charge relates to the relocation and rationalisation during May 2002 of W E Baxter
and to the closure in June 2002 of Lasercraft. The £2.98m exceptional charge in 2001 related to the
disposal of The Box Room business and comprised a £0.73m provision for loss on disposal and £2.25m
goodwill previously written off to reserves.
After exceptionals, the pre-tax result was a profit of £1.95m (2001: loss of £0.10m) and earnings per 
share were 4.6p (2001: loss per share of 3.0p).
Year end equity shareholders’ funds were £23.75m (2001: £23.90m, as restated), giving net assets per
share of 85.7p (2001: 86.3p). Year end net indebtedness increased to £16.7m (2001: £13.3m), with
resultant gearing of 70% (2001: 56%), reflecting capital expenditure of £4.1m (2001: £1.2m), and 
financing of the Quadracolor acquisition. Net interest payable of £0.84m (2001: £0.86m) was covered 
4.6 times (2001: 4.4 times) by operating profit before exceptionals.
Our commercial printing businesses overall increased sales by 6% in the year. However, this increase
results solely from the acquisition of Quadracolor on 31 January 2002, without which sales of commercial 
print would have declined by 15%, reflecting the intense price pressures and weak demand in the industry.
The excellent quality of the work produced by our group has once again been recognised in the 
PrintWeek magazine awards with Fulmar Colour winning the Fine Art category.
The group’s book printing businesses have continued to prosper, increasing turnover by 29%.
Prolonged periods of intense competition only serve to increase the pressures on our staff. I am pleased to
take this opportunity to thank them for their commitment and congratulate them on their awards success.
The directors are recommending an unchanged final dividend of 3.4p per share, giving unchanged total
dividends for the year of 5.2p per share, which, if approved at the AGM on 12 May 2003, will be paid on
19 May 2003 to those shareholders on the register at the close of business on 11 April 2003.
While our commercial operations continue to suffer the effects of weak demand, our book-related
businesses are performing well. We anticipate that these circumstances will continue for the year ahead
and, given the group’s ability to perform in difficult markets, we remain cautiously optimistic, with the
company well positioned to benefit from any upturn in demand for commercial print.

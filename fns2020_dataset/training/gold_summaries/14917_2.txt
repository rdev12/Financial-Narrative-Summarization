Financial Highlights 
Year ended 30 November 2008
“2008 was, by any standards, an extraordinary year. In particular, the second half 
of the year was influenced by the enormous upheavals in global financial markets 
and the inevitable uncertainty that such events bring to the recruitment market 
place.
Given these exceptional circumstances, it is pleasing to be once again in a position 
to report on another year of growth and significant further progress towards 
the Group’s strategic objectives. SThree ends the 2008 financial year a more 
international and more diversified business than at any time in its twenty-two year 
history.
We enter 2009 with our eyes open, mindful of the risks and challenges ahead. 
Nonetheless, we are confident that as a business we are particularly well suited to 
emerge from the current difficult period in excellent shape to take advantage of the 
inevitable market recovery, whenever it may materialise.”

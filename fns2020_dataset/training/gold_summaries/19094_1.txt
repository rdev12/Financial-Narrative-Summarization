 8 Moneysupermarket Group Annual Report & Accounts 2015
TravelSupermarket being fully live on our new platform with  
no disruption to customers. This was a major achievement by  
all involved. 
Our growth strategy is simple and therein lies its benefit to  
our Group:
• Best site: Be the easiest way for people to find the right products 
for their needs 
• Earn customer loyalty: Trusted destination brands
• Preferred partner: Be the best way for providers to  
acquire customers
I am pleased to report that we have continued to make good 
progress during the year against our strategy through investment in 
our technology platform, brands and commercial teams.
As price comparison becomes the normal way for millions of people 
to research and shop for their financial products, as would be 
expected, our services have attracted greater attention from the 
regulators. During the year, Ofgem started an investigation in 
connection with energy price comparison sites and the Competition 
and Markets Authority announced they would look at price 
comparison websites during 2016. I am encouraged that the 
overarching theme of our engagement with regulators so far has 
been that we continue to make it easier for new providers to enter 
the markets in which we operate and that this has been, and will 
continue to be, good for consumers as we help them save and grow 
their money.
During 2015 we continued to develop our internal governance, 
launching our ‘Customer First’ programme across the organisation, 
helping our employees make sure we do the right thing for our 
customers and users.
As a Group, we are transparent on both our business model and 
how we make money to users and customers. For example, at 
MoneySuperMarket, we cannot guarantee listing all products and 
Overview
We saved our customers an estimated £1.6bn in 2015, more than 
ever before, and thanks to our broad range of services and the 
power of our three trusted brands, we did it slightly differently than 
planned, delivering revenue of £281.7m up 14% compared to 2014.
For customers, it was the year of taking action against expensive 
standard energy tariffs and sorting out their personal finances with 
both attractive credit card deals and innovative current accounts as 
referred to later in my review. 
Our focus on making it easier for customers to save money was 
reflected in the Group’s net promoter score of 48%, up 10% 
compared to 2014.
Whilst our three brands thrived, our new Group structure was 
focused on delivering the second year of the three-year technology 
re-engineering programme. Our ambition is to transition our 
services onto a single market leading platform, allowing data 
centres to be closed, innovation cycles to accelerate and 
smartphone experience to be better than desktop whilst leveraging 
costs and skills across the Group.
By the close of 2015, the team achieved the major milestone of both 
MoneySuperMarket (motor and home insurance channels) and 
More customers are choosing to share 
their data with us, allowing us to 
develop personalised tools and 
services to better meet their  
individual needs.

providers, however we do try and have a wide range of providers on 
our site to help the majority of our customers make a significant 
saving to that of their current provider.
Our Group
We estimate that our three brands of MoneySuperMarket, 
MoneySavingExpert and TravelSupermarket together have an 
average of 23.6m monthly unique visitors, with many people using 
either two or all three of them during a year.
I reported last year that to deliver our growth strategy, I intended  
to restructure our organisation. This has been successfully 
implemented forming a Group structure united by the common 
purpose of ‘helping every household make the most of their money’.
Each brand is now led by a Managing Director, supported by shared 
Group services of technology, finance, people, user experience and 
data. This allows the business to leverage costs and skills across our 
brands whilst learning more about customer behaviour than would 
ever be possible as standalone businesses. With relevance being 
one key to customer engagement, this is a vital ingredient for our 
future growth.
MoneySuperMarket
MoneySuperMarket had a good year delivering revenue of £250.1m, 
up 14% compared to 2014. 
Insurance had a mixed year with strong growth during the first half 
but declining revenues during the final quarter. Several factors 
contributed to this including increased competitor activity, limited 
ability to innovate our site during its re-platforming and a strategy 
to maintain margin during the final quarter.
Money, on the other hand, had a very successful year.  
Customers were particularly active in switching both credit cards 
and current accounts. Thanks to our technology investment,  
more people used our innovative ‘smart search’ functionality, 
allowing them to search for loans and credit cards that they were 
most likely to be accepted for, not just market leading deals for 
which they might not be eligible. 
Home Services also had a very successful year, demonstrating the 
power of our Group structure and culture. By working together, 
MoneySuperMarket and MoneySavingExpert helped over 500,000 
people switch their energy tariff during the year and make 
significant savings, chiefly through our collective switch initiatives. 
As I outlined earlier, 2016 will see the rollout of our new technology 
platform to our money and energy channels, completing both  
our single platform and single customer view ambition for 
MoneySuperMarket core channels, whilst delivering a single joined 
up experience for our customers no matter what device they 
choose to use, desktop, tablet or smartphone.
MoneySavingExpert
MoneySavingExpert had a great year delivering revenue of £30.7m, 
up 35% compared to 2014, of which £23.7m (2014: £16.8m) related 
to intercompany revenue.
More users signed up to receive the MoneySavingExpert weekly tip 
email, breaking through the 10m subscribers milestone. This is a 
huge endorsement of the great work the editorial team do at 
MoneySavingExpert and confirms that we are truly living the values 
of the editorial code so carefully put in place during the acquisition 
of the business. 
In 2015, MoneySavingExpert’s Cheap Energy Club was particularly 
helpful when combined with the power of the collective switch deals 
negotiated by the Group. The team have been a powerful voice in 
helping encourage people who have never switched before to take 
the initiative and save themselves money by joining others in 
changing energy supplier. 
In September we reached the end of the three-year earn-out period 
following the Group’s acquisition of MoneySavingExpert in 2012, 
paying deferred consideration and employee bonuses of £20.6m. 
The Founder and Editor-in-Chief, Martin Lewis, has stepped up into 
the role of Executive Chairman at MoneySavingExpert.
TravelSupermarket
TravelSupermarket had a good year delivering revenue of  
£24.5m, up 8% compared to 2014. 
We have rebuilt the TravelSupermarket site for customers on our 
new technology platform. The site has a very different look and feel, 
designed for mobile first and packed with great search and filtering 
capability. However, its pioneering feature is ‘My Suitcase’, designed 
to allow people to share flights, holidays and hotels with friends  
and family before clicking through and booking. We believe that  
‘My Suitcase’ will be a valuable tool for holiday planners, increasing 
their engagement with our services whilst allowing us to get to know 
them better. With new additional features planned for 2016 the 
team is focused on creating the best tools for customers to plan and 
book their holidays.
Travel is a very competitive market and therefore we have started 
2016 with a new TV campaign to tell people about our new service 
whilst testing how the new ‘My Suitcase’ tool performs with different 
groups of customers. It should be an exciting year ahead for the 
TravelSupermarket team.
Summary
Whilst delivering good financial results in 2015, we also invested 
£19.6m of capital expenditure to power future growth in the  
years ahead.
Our Insurance and Travel markets appear to be getting tougher 
whilst our Money and Energy markets continue to grow. Providers 
are launching ever more attractive products due to the continued 
environment of low interest rates and falling energy prices. This can 
only be great news for UK households and demonstrates the power 
of our diversified service.
Our new technology platform and Group structure means that we 
can share learnings and insights across our three brands, helping to 
pioneer a better mobile experience for our growing number of 
customers on smartphones. 
More customers are choosing to share their data with us, allowing 
us to develop personalised tools and services to better meet their 
individual needs. As we look to the future, personalised, relevant, 
mobile first services will start becoming reality thanks to our 
investments started back in 2014.
As we head into 2016, the Group is well placed to help more people 
save more money in the year ahead.

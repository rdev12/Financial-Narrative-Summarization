 I am pleased to be able to report another
successful year for Alliance & Leicester plc. 
Financial Results
Pre-tax proﬁt in 2003 was a record
£525m, up 12% on 2002. Basic earnings
per share were up 16% to 79.0p. The
Board has proposed a ﬁnal dividend of
29.6p, making a total dividend of 43.9p,
a 10% increase on the equivalent ﬁgure
for 2002.
Shareholder Returns
The Group’s strategy is working, and 
this is reﬂected in the returns we have
generated for our shareholders. Since 
July 2000, when we launched our
strategy, we have generated a Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) of 114%. 
This compares to a TSR of minus 23% 
for the FTSE 100 Index, and a TSR
of 28% for the banking sector index 
over the same period.
During 2003 Alliance & Leicester
shareholders received a TSR of 25%. 
This compares to a TSR of 18% for the
FTSE 100 Index, and a TSR of 24% for 
the banking sector index.
Strategy
Our strategy is reﬂected by our 
brand values of rewarding customers
who buy more from us, offering 
better value products, developing
straightforward processes, and 
providing friendly, approachable
customer service. By delivering 
these brand values we are ideally
positioned for continued success. 
The market is evolving in a way that 
will give us competitive advantage. Both
personal and commercial customers 
are increasingly using “direct” channels
for their basic banking transactions, 
but they also wish to use branches or
other face-to-face contact for more
complex enquiries and purchases. 
We have proven skills in these “direct”
channels – telephone, internet and ATM
banking – together with a compact 
and professional branch network. By
continuing to build a direct bank with 
a high street presence, we are well
placed for the future.
Board and Management
We continue to add to the existing
strengths of our Board and on 1 October
2003 announced the appointment of
Chris Rhodes as Managing Director,
Retail Banking. Chris has demonstrated
considerable leadership skills since 
he joined the Board in June 2002 
as Operations Director, and we are
conﬁdent in his ability to successfully
grow our Retail Banking business. 
We have also appointed two additional
non-executive directors. Peter Stone and
Jane Barker both have broad commercial
experience, and they also have speciﬁc
skills which will be of great overall beneﬁt
to our Board. In particular, Peter Stone
has extensive experience in the ﬁeld of
commercial banking, and will make a
valuable contribution to the Group’s
Wholesale Banking strategy. Jane Barker
has extensive experience in ﬁnancial
services, and will add further valuable
ﬁnancial expertise to the Board.

The Future
The ﬁnancial success shown in our 2003
results demonstrates the value of our
strategy for our shareholders, a strategy
we believe represents the future for
banking in the UK, and which we believe
will continue to deliver real value for 
our customers and shareholders going
forward. I am confident that 2004 will 
be another successful year for the Group.

Business Performance
Each of the Group’s business sectors 
had a successful 2003, as is highlighted
elsewhere in this Report. These results
reﬂect the continuing excellent work of
the executive team, under Richard Pym’s
leadership, as well as the dedication and
ability of our staff. 
Alliance & Leicester is widely regarded 
as being a low-risk bank and a responsible
lender that pays considerable attention
to being fair to customers. We have
worked hard to gain and maintain this
reputation, and we will continue to
pursue responsible lending in each of 
our markets.
Corporate Governance
The Board recognises the value of 
good corporate governance, not only 
in the areas of accountability and risk
management, but also as a positive
contribution to business prosperity. 
The Board has reviewed the main and
supporting principles and provisions set
out in the revised Combined Code on
Corporate Governance issued by the
Financial Reporting Council in July 2003,
and is satisﬁed that it complies with
those provisions in all material respects.
Corporate Social Responsibility
We believe that we have an important
role to play in our local communities,

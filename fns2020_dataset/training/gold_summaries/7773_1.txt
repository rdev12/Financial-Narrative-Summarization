strengthening of management and 
continuing improvements in processes and 
quality. The impact has been that major 
projects have been delivered on time but 
to an even higher quality.  
Our Glasgow office delivered the first part 
of a new planning and appeals portal for 
the Scottish Executive. This was IDOX’s 
largest contract to date, worth £2.3m over 
three years.
In addition, IDOX gained notable contract 
wins at authorities including Eastleigh, 
Sheffield, South Gloucester, Shropshire, 
West Lindsey and Westminster, with 
further development work completed 
for the Northern Ireland Planning 
Department. 
Our software development team has made 
considerable progress in improving quality 
control and resource planning, successfully 
delivering on schedule significant 
upgrades to all our product lines. Other 
achievements include the completion of 
a two year development of a new public 
access system, and a significant upgrade 
to our revenues & benefits document 
management and workflow solution that 
The market for software and services for 
local government has remained robust 
against a backdrop of difficult conditions 
in the wider economy. Driven by the need 
to improve services and become more 
accessible to their communities, local 
authorities are continuing to invest in 
software and services that deliver tangible 
benefits and a rapid return on investment. 
However, the consolidation of suppliers 
and IT platforms has changed the local 
government market significantly over 
the past year, reducing both choice and 
competition and leaving IDOX as the only 
quoted company in the sector.
With the addition of Plantech we now 
supply more than 71% of the UK’s local 
authorities with leading products that are 
fully integrated from public-access web 
pages through to back-end databases 
and case-management systems. From 
our leading position in segments such as 
land & property and revenues & benefits, 
we will build the IDOX business through 
product innovation, higher levels of cross 
selling and strategic acquisitions.

On a like-for-like basis revenues grew 9% 
year on year with a higher percentage 
of revenues coming from product 
and services and less from low margin 
contracted out backscanning or hardware 
purchases.

Enterprise Management tool, to deliver 
improvements to the delivery process. 
After the roll out of this in the final 
quarter of the 2008 financial year, it is now 
being linked to a market leading software-

end-to-end paperless processing.

Demand for the Solutions business, which 
accounts for just 8% of Group revenues, 
has suffered from the economic downturn 
with key private-sector projects being 
delayed or postponed indefinitely. Because 
our consultancy business is involved in the 
early-stage design and architecture phases 
of major IT projects, it is therefore among 
the first to be affected.  In the public 
sector a number of managed content-rich 
web sites have been withdrawn due to 
changes in government policy. Overall 
revenues declined year on year by 22%.
However, we continue to see a steady 
flow of opportunities for consultancy, 
recruitment and training particularly from 
non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) 
and are addressing this by focusing on 
services connected with efficient and 
integrates with market-leading back-office 
systems from other vendors. The Group’s 
product portfolio has been further 
enhanced with the launch of Plantech’s 
Enterprise Management tool, which is 
being made available to our wider Uniform 
customer base.
We have merged the operations and 
customer support areas of the three 
software businesses and strengthened 
the business with management from 
across the Group. We have introduced

The Recruitment business, which 
accounts for 12% of Group revenues, 
increased turnover by 7% year on year 
through a growth in contract and interim 
staff services to the banking, legal 
and government sectors. Permanent 
placements have also held up despite 
the economic outlook. The recruitment 
market in the specialist area of knowledge 
and information management remains 
stable with continued demand for interim 
managers and senior appointments.

Through a strategy of acquisition and 
reorganisation, IDOX has transformed 
itself into a leading force in local 
government software, with a reputation 
for delivering innovative products 
and services backed by high-quality 
implementation and support. At the 
same time, this transformation has 
delivered substantial cost savings and 
strong growth in revenues, profitability 
and cash generation, all underpinned 
by a high level of recurring licence and 
maintenance revenues. Though vigilant to 
the challenges ahead, we are cautious but 
confident about our future.

Technical fabrics are used widely in many industrial 
markets. Fiberweb has a strong position in filtration, 
the construction industry, drier sheet and graphic arts 
markets amongst others.
In filtration, Fiberweb manufactures the well known 
Reemay
®
 brand of high-precision polyester fabrics as 
well as meltblown polypropylene filtration layers for 
facemasks and high-strength Typar
®
 polypropylene 
fabrics as support scrims. 
In the construction industry, Fiberweb manufactures 
fabrics for roofing applications.
In North America, consumers typically apply fabric 
softener to their clothes through the use of an 
impregnated drier sheet in a tumble dryer. This is a 
technically demanding application and Fiberweb is a 
leading supplier of the necessary substrate.
In the graphic arts industry, there is a demand for 
specialised wipes and roller covers used in the set-up 
of off-set lithographic printing processes and in more 
modern digital printing equipment.

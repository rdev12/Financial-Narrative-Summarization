 2   |   Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2013
Chairman’s Statement
Having only recently been appointed as 
the Chairman of Advanced Medical 
Solutions Group plc, I am delighted to 
report that 2013 was another good year 
of growth for the Group and that the 
progress that was reported in the Interim 
Statement has continued. We are 
pleased to report a 13% increase in 
revenue to £59.5 million (2012: £52.6 
million), representing growth of 11% on a 
constant currency basis, and an increase 
in adjusted
1
 profit before tax of 12% to 
£13.5 million (2012: £12.1 million).
The Group ended the year with net cash 
of £5.3 million (2012: net debt £5.5 
million), with the €25 million of debt 
taken on by the Group in December 2011 
to finance the acquisition of RESORBA® 
having been fully repaid within 2 years.
Our brands continue to perform well and 
good progress has been made against 
the Group’s vision and strategy.
Operationally, we continue to generate 
efficiencies and have delivered a further 
improvement in gross margin across the 
Group from streamlining processes as 
well as working with partners to improve 
our service and supply.
The Group is in the enviable position of 
having several significant opportunities 
from its existing products and 
geographic markets as well as from the 
new developments it is currently working 
on. In addition to this, our balance sheet 
strength enables us to consider further 
acquisitions should they be in line with 
the Group’s vision and strategy and meet 
our required financial metrics.
Dividend
We are proposing a final dividend of 
0.41p per share, making a total dividend 
for the year of 0.60p per share, a 15.4% 
increase compared with prior year. If 
approved at the Annual General Meeting 
on 20 May 2014, this will be paid on 28 
May 2014 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 2 May 2014.
Board Changes
Peter Steinmann was appointed as 
Non-Executive Director on 1 July 2013. 
His extensive knowledge of the global 
medical devices market and commercial 
experience will assist the Group with its 
market expansion strategy. Don Evans 
retired from the Board and as Chairman 
of the Group on 31 December 2013.  
All our thanks go to Don who has 
contributed so much to the growth and 
success of AMS over the last 17 years.  
I joined the Board as Non-Executive 
Director on 4 December 2013 and 
became Chairman on 1 January 2014, 
following Don’s retirement. I look forward 
to leading the Group to achieve its 
strategy and meet its objectives in  
the next stage of its development.
People
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank all our employees, 
customers, suppliers, business partners 
and shareholders for their continued 
support over the last year.

I am pleased to report another year of strong ﬁnancial and strategic performance for 
Croda. This achievement in tough economic conditions demonstrates the resilience of our 
Consumer Care and Performance Technologies businesses, with both sectors reporting 
higher proﬁts and a further improvement in margins. Our progress reﬂects our strategic 
focus on sustainable growth through continued product innovation in niche markets and 
increasing investment in new technologies and emerging markets, particularly in Asia and 
Latin America. In 2012, small acquisitions have added exciting new technologies which will 
enhance our existing capabilities in key areas.
Full Year Results 
Croda again achieved record sales, margins and profits in 2012. 
T urnover from continuing operations increased by 2.3% to £1,051.9m 
(2011: £1,028.0m) and operating profit grew by 7.4% to £255.4m 
(2011: £237.7m), a return on sales of 24.3% (2011: 23.1%). This was driven 
by strong underlying progress in the two principal business sectors of 
Consumer Care and Performance T echnologies. 
Pre-tax profit from continuing operations rose by 6.6% to £253.2m 
(2011: £237.5m), and earnings per share on the same basis increased 
by 8.2% to 130.0p (2011: 120.1p). 
Sector Performance 
Consumer Care sales increased by 2.6% over the year to £586.4m 
(2011: £571.4m), despite some weakness in the third quarter, while 
operating profit rose by 8.3% to £185.4m (2011: £171.2m). The return on 
sales of 31.6% (2011: 30.0%) was a new record for the Group, driven by 
exciting new product launches. We achieved profit growth in all three 
business areas, with Crop Care making the strongest progress. Personal 
Care and Health Care made modest progress despite the tough market 
conditions for consumer products in Europe.
In our new Performance T echnologies reporting segment, sales rose 
by 2.5% to £382.8m (2011: £373.6m) and operating profit increased 
by 8.0% to £59.7m (2011: £55.3m). Return on sales improved to 15.6% 
(2011: 14.8%), representing good progress towards our medium term 
target of 20%. All business areas achieved underlying sales growth and 
Polymer Additives, Geo T echnologies and Home Care also made strong 
profit progress, partially offset by slight declines in Lubricants and Coatings 
& Polymers due to the weakness of their European markets, particularly 
in the automotive sector.
Industrial Chemicals sales were 0.4% lower at £82.7m (2011: £83.0m) 
and operating profit declined by 8.0% to £10.3m (2011: £11.2m), a return 
on sales of 12.5% (2011: 13.5%). This reflected high raw material prices 
and competitive commodity and textile markets, though we did see an 
improving trend in the second half of the year.
Acquisitions
While the main driver of Croda’s future growth is expected to be innovation 
generated from within the Group, an important part of our strategy is to 
enhance our progress through the acquisition of complementary new 
technologies. 
In July 2012, we acquired Istituto di Ricerche Biotecnologiche (IRB) in Italy, 
the global leader in plant stem cell technology, for a total consideration of 
€7.7m. The acquisition has been successfully integrated within our Sederma 
skin care actives business and we have received a very encouraging 
response to its unique capabilities from our existing customers, with one 
major multinational client already incorporating an IRB product into a new 
global product formulation.
In December 2012, we acquired the trade and assets of Innovachem 
LLC in the US for a total consideration of US$2.8m. This acquisition is an 
excellent strategic fit for our Personal Care business, adding a number 
of exciting new patented product lines and technologies to our existing 
portfolio and enhancing its ability to service customers around the world.
Disposals  
In November 2012, we sold our Cremona business in Italy, completing 
the disposal of the last remaining fatty acid and glycerine plant that we 
acquired with Uniqema in 2006. These undifferentiated technologies are 
not Croda’s core competence, but our employees had worked tirelessly to 
deliver value from the site and we were delighted to conclude its sale to 
an Italian business.
Dividend
Croda is a highly cash generative business, allowing us to maintain a 
strong dividend policy while also funding significant capital investment in 
the business and making appropriate bolt-on acquisitions, and at the 
same time reducing net debt.  03
Economic uncertainty continues, 
particularly in Europe, but we have 
made an encouraging start to the 
year and the Board is conﬁdent that 
Croda will make further progress 
in 2013. 
BUSINESS REVIEW
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OTHER INFORMATION
In 2011, we announced our intention to increase our dividend payout to 
between 40% and 50% of sustainable earnings, resulting in a 57.1% 
increase in our total dividend for 2011. Building on this new base, the 
Board is now recommending an increased final dividend of 32.75p 
(2011: 30.25p). T ogether with the interim dividend of 26.75p (2011: 24.75p) 
paid in October 2012, this makes a total dividend of 59.5p (2011: 55.0p), 
an increase of 8.2% for the year. This maintains the payout ratio around 
the middle of our target range at 46%.
Subject to future trading and the maintenance of a prudent approach 
to cash and balance sheet management, Croda expects to maintain 
its progressive dividend policy in the years ahead.
Outlook
Economic uncertainty continues, particularly in Europe, but we have made 
an encouraging start to the year and the Board is confident that Croda 
will make further progress in 2013.

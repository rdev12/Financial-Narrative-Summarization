Performance
An external market research specialist
undertakes regular customer satisfaction
surveys across the Group, resulting in a
Customer Net Promoter Score being
calculated. This score measures how many
of our customers would make a positive
recommendation about us. Our score has risen
consistently from 32 in 2010, to 52 in 2013.
During 2013 we launched Project X-Sell. This
will be the umbrella project under which we
drive though our new sales initiatives:
• A new Customer Relationship Management
(“CRM”) platform has been developed and is
currently being piloted in our German
operation
• Web channel and social media capability is
to be established in all business units
2014 will see the roll-out of our Customer
Experience (“CX”) strategy. The strategy
involves establishing best practices when
dealing with customers and making them
a routine part of doing business.
The safety value proposition “Your safety,
our priority” was successfully launched in all
our territories during 2013. Its message
helps to position Lavendon as THE safe
access solutions provider.
Challenges
All our markets continue to be
competitive, with many competitors
focusing on price alone. We
consistently win quality customers
through our differentiated and
more complete service offering,
rather than through price alone.
Regular communication with both
current and prospective customers
is essential. We will standardise and
reinforce our existing communication
mediums as well as introducing new
media such as social networking, digital
marketing and upgraded websites.
Customer focus 
Strategic priorities
• Our customers consistently rank reliability and punctuality as their first and
second most important buying factors. We have set targets for all business units
for annual improvements in these measures.
• Adopting a sales-led culture placing customers at the heart of our business.
• Driving the Safe Access Solutions value proposition, “Your safety, our priority”.
Differentiating through our service offering
Strategic priorities
• Become THE Safety Solution provider for our customers working 
at height requirements.
• Promote the BlueSky Solutions safety enhancing and efficiency product
ranges across the Group.
• Achieve higher levels of machine reliability through the Tech-X and
Preventative Part Maintenance (“PPM”) programmes.
• Expand in markets that offer attractive margins and/or growth potential.
Performance
We have a fleet of over 2,000 safety
enhancing attachments available for fitting
to our equipment to meet increasingly
safety focused customer needs.
Further leading blue chip construction
businesses, including leading European
construction groups, have now mandated
the use of certain BlueSky type safety
devices on their sites. 
As an example, at the St Bartholomew’s
Hospital redevelopment site in the UK, over
140 SkySentry units were fitted to our powered
access platforms. The system facilitates physical
tracking of a machine location, its usage and
limits access to authorised users only.
The SkySiren product continues to lead
the market in the provision of a robust
anti-entrapment attachments that
can easily be fitted to many types of
equipment. The SkySiren product
achieved over 100,000 hire days
during 2013.
The Tech-X programme, started in 2008,
continues to give the Group a clear
differentiation in the quality of servicing
and maintenance. By the end of 2015 we
aim to have 75% of out depots at the
Tech-X Gold standard. 
Challenges
The cultural demand for safe working
practices still needs to mature in some of our
areas of operation and potential new markets.
Although the need for more efficient methods
of working still created a level demand for
powered access in these territories.

Customer focus
There are signs that a
cyclical recovery in our key
UK market is emerging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2013   13
Performance
A total of 2,440 machines were added to the
Group’s rental fleet during 2013, at a cost of
£50m. The majority of the units were for
fleet renewal but some 500 were to facilitate
the expansion of the Group’s French and
Middle Eastern businesses. 
A total of 2,050 ex-rental fleet assets were
disposed of during the year, raising sale
proceeds of £10.2m. Where possible, our
practice continues to be to dispose of these
units into markets outside of the markets in
which we operate.
The Group continues to move machines
between business units in order to optimise
fleet mix and maximise revenue generation
across the Group.
During 2013, the average age of the fleet
across the Group reduced from 7.3 years
to 7.1 years.
Challenges
Growth in the Middle East absorbs working
capital at rates above the Group’s average
trend levels, due to payment practices within
the region.
Lead time on new fleet is extending as
global demand increases.
Capital efficiency programme
Strategic priorities
• Minimise working capital.
• Optimise utilisation and hire rates across business operating units.
• Expand fleet in growing markets where attractive returns are available.
• Achieve optimal disposal proceeds for life-expired fleet assets.
Performance
Each business now has a dedicated
health and safety (“H&S”) representative
responsible for local H&S matters.
The representatives meet collectively to
form our H&S Centre of Excellence.
This centre is responsible for monitoring
H&S performance, ensuring best practices
are adopted across the Group, and to
provide guidance to manufacturers on
equipment improvements that would
further increase safe product usage.
Our Lavendon Academy training team
delivered over 5,500 delegate training
sessions during 2013, helping in the
development of our workforce across
the Group. Voluntary labour turnover
for the year fell to 10%. 
The operational efficiency programme
has delivered a total of £5.2m over the last
three years, ahead of the target of £5.0m.
A new target of £1.5m has been agreed for
delivery over the next three years.
A Performance Improvement team will work
with management across the Group from
2014 onwards to transform and then
standardise good business practice,
particularly around customer order taking,
engineering and logistics. 
The new IT platform is being implemented
across the Group, and by the end of 2013
covered almost 85% of the Group’s revenues
and rental fleet holding. The French business
will go live in 2014.
Challenges
Employment restrictions in some Middle
Eastern territories have presented
increasing challenges to our Human
Resources team in 2013. These have been
closely managed during the year, and will
continue to be during 2014.
Initial teething issues with the new IT platform
in Germany impacted revenues in the
second half of the year. The issues were
resolved towards the end of 2013.
A safety first culture, that is also efficient
Strategic priorities
• Embed a “Safety First” culture among the workforce.
• Deliver operational efficiency programme.
• Roll out the new IT platform, standardising ‘best in class’ business processes
throughout the Group.

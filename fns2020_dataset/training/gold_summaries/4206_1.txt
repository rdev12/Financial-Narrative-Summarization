Chief Executive’s review
Performance and Prospects
Consumer Care
There are three main business areas 
within the Consumer Care segment: 
Personal Care, Health Care and Crop Care. 
In 2010, sales increased by 14.0% to 
£516.4m (2009: £453.1m) and operating 
profits increased 31.8% to £136.5m 
(2009: £103.6m) with the underlying 
margin from the extra sales boosted by 
the benefits of last year’s restructuring 
and tight cost control. Return on sales 
increased to 26.4% (2009: 22.9%).
Personal Care is the largest of the 
business areas and sales grew faster than 
the Consumer Care average, with the 
strongest growth in prestige and high end 
salon products to our largest customers. 
Sales were particularly strong in North 
America and Europe. Our innovation and 
new product pipeline remains very strong 
and this is fuelling demand.
Health Care saw double digit growth 
despite capacity constraints in the first 
half of the year. New high purity Omega 
3 capacity will be operational in the first 
half of 2011.
After a quiet first quarter, Crop Care 
achieved very strong sales with North 
American and European markets again 
seeing the highest growth.
Industrial Specialities
There are five main business areas in 
our Industrial Specialities segment: 
Polymer Additives, Lubricant Additives, 
Home Care, Coatings & Polymers and 
Geo Technologies. 2010 sales were up 
29.7% to £485.5m (2009: £374.4m) and 
continuing operating profit increased by 
246.9% to £62.1m (2009: £17.9m) for 
the same reasons as those behind the 
Consumer Care profit uplift. In addition,  
the comparatives in the first half of 2009 
were very weak as a result of the global 
recession. Return on sales increased to 
12.8% (2009: 4.8%), beating our previous 
target of 10% and the 2010 result 
showed good progress towards our new 
15% target.
In Polymer Additives, good sales growth 
was achieved throughout the year despite 
some capacity issues, with sales doubling 
in China versus 2009.
Lubricant Additives were also capacity 
constrained in the early part of the year, 
following the Wilton closure, with strong 
demand for “green” high performance 
products.
In Home Care, sales were again strong. 
The quality of the portfolio that remains 
after the sale of Emmerich is high and we 
have been particularly successful in selling 
new biodegradable products in North 
America.
Coatings & Polymers saw strong growth 
with sales to the electronics industry in 
Asia performing well.
Geo Technologies saw a windfall in 
North America as a result of the Gulf of 
Mexico cleanup. This was, however, again 
countered by capacity issues early in the 
year following the closure of Wilton.
Mike Humphrey  
Group Chief Executive
Sales were very strong in 2010 in both reporting 
sectors. Industrial Specialities had the highest growth, 
particularly in the first half, with weak comparatives 
in 2009 due to the recession.

Directors’ report | Business review We can only achieve  
our goals through  
excellent and constant 
communication,  
creativity and setting  
clear objectives at  
every level
MixXIN ME™, Versflex™ 
and NatraGems™ are Croda’s 
Blue Technology range of 
ingredients for facial skin, body 
and hair care formulations. These 
ingredients allow our customers 
to process their formulations 
at ambient temperatures and 
reduce the energy consumption 
of the process by up to 80%.
6 A new office building for 
Croda’s European commercial 
functions at Cowick Hall, 
UK, was completed in 2010. 
Considerations were made to 
reduce the environmental impact 
of the building at all stages. The 
offices are warmed by geothermal 
heat from water around 100 
metres below the ground.
We will remain a  
‘fun’, lively,  
stimulating and exciting 
place to work, where 
all employees have the 
courage to question, 
and all functions and 
individuals are valued

Chief Executive’s review
Strategy
This section of the Chief Executive’s 
review is largely unchanged from last 
year. This is indicative of the robustness of 
Croda’s core principles and of the Group’s 
success in implementing its strategy.
The core principles of Croda’s strategy 
have remained valid since 1999. We test 
them every year and every year we have 
found them to be a solid framework for 
successful growth. Our aim is to be a 
leading, independent, global speciality 
chemical company. We will only invest in 
businesses, current and future, that can:
n	 be truly global
n	 create profitable innovation
n	 operate in end markets that have long  
 term growth well above global GDP
n	 realistically sustain high operating  
 margins.
Our focus on markets and market drivers 
means we are well aligned with the 
mega trends which will shape the future 
consumer and industrial markets. Trends 
like an ageing population, health and 
well-being, sustainability and the correct 
use of renewable resources present 
great challenges and even greater 
opportunities. 
Croda’s culture of pragmatic innovation 
in every aspect of the business, not just 
in product development, means we are 
well-placed to be a truly leading speciality 
chemicals company. We have offices and 
technical facilities in 36 countries and 
operate 17 state of the art factories across 
Europe, Asia and the Americas. Through 
this network we are able to match and, 
in many instances, exceed our customers’ 
rapid globalisation.
Our operating companies are set sales, 
profit growth and operating margin 
targets that form the basis of our budgets 
and strategic plans. We report annually 
on our progress against five key financial 
key performance indicators and these are 
assessed on page 10:
n	 Return on sales
n	 EPS growth
n	 Post tax ROIC
n	 Net debt to EBITDA
n	 EBITDA interest cover.
Summary
Croda is a truly global company with only 
5% of its sales in the UK. Our customer 
focused business model has been the 
basis of our success for many years. We 
will continue to increase this focus to 
create our future success.
In a number of areas we were short of 
capacity in 2010 following the Wilton 
closure. We have addressed this issue 
during 2010 and will install further 
capacity in the current year.
Our new product pipeline is strong and 
global demand in our chosen markets 
remains robust.
2011 has started well and we expect to 
report further progress in the current year.

In 2010, four of our 
manufacturing sites have 
been accredited to the 
European Federation for Cosmetic 
Ingredients (EFfCI) quality standard. 
The standard is designed to ensure 
the consistency, quality and purity 
of cosmetic ingredients above the 
standards of ISO 9001. A further 
five of our sites are working 
towards accreditation in 2011.

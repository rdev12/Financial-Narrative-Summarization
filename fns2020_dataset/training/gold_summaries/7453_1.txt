 Chief Executive’s statement
As the breadth of the
Group’s services has
widened in recent
years, our clients have
remained at the centre
of our attention.
OVERVIEW
I am pleased to report another year of
good financial and operational
performance. We made excellent progress,
continuing the positive momentum that
we achieved in the last financial year and
since the onset of the financial crisis in 
late 2008. During the first six months, we
delivered very good growth despite the
continuing macroeconomic uncertainty. As
expected, the second half was essentially
flat when measured against more
demanding year-on-year comparatives
following our strong performance in the
second half of last year. For the year ended
31 March 2012, client travel activity
increased by 2% and travel spend by 5%.
Our own revenue rose by 5% and
underlying operating profit by 13%.
Given the obvious macroeconomic
uncertainty, it is not surprising that our
clients continue to show a cautious
approach to their travel. Most recognise
the need to travel as they pursue their
growth objectives. However, a majority had
two common objectives this year: to gain
tighter control of their travel activity and to
maximise the value of their travel-related
expenditure. The result was a growing
trend towards consolidation of service and
the delivery of incremental cost savings.
As we have noted before, our proprietary
technology is playing an increasingly
important role by providing accurate and
relevant data to both our clients and our
own business managers as they help our
clients make decisions. Technology also
helps provide efficient and cost-effective
tools applicable to other areas of the travel
and expense management process.
Our strategy is centred on delivering value
through excellent service that is tailored
to the specific needs of each client.
As the breadth of the Group’s services
has widened in recent years, to include
travel, expense and data management
underpinned by proprietary technology,
our clients have remained at the centre of
our attention. This approach supports our
reputation as one of the world’s leading
international corporate services companies
helping us sustain a business which
delivers value to all stakeholders in the
toughest of trading climates.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenue of £374m was up 5% as reported,
or up 2% at constant exchange rates.
Underlying operating profit, which is
before the amortisation of acquired
intangibles, was up by 13% to £47.2m, and
represented a margin improvement from
11.7% to 12.6%. Underlying profit before
tax was up by 16% to £38.2m, and
underlying EPS increased by 14% from
7.3p to 8.3p. Once again, this performance
underscores the fact that our model does
not rely on large revenue growth to enable
margin progression.
After including the amortisation of
acquired intangibles, reported operating
profit was up by 14%, profit before tax was
up by 18% and EPS increased by 17%.
Reported revenue per employee
increased by 2.7% from £67.5k to £69.3k.
At constant exchange rates this was an
increase of 0.6%.
At the end of the year, we purchased the
remaining 42% of Spendvision for £13.4m,
which valued 100% of Spendvision at
£32.0m. The consideration was funded by
£8.4m of cash and the issue of £5.0m of
new HRG shares. There was also a deferred
consideration payment of £2.0m in cash.
Spendvision is a leading innovator in the
development and support of transaction
management solutions, including expenses
management and payable automation.
Full ownership brings a number of benefits
to the Group. The acquisition is expected 
to be earnings neutral in the year ending 
31 March 2013 and marginally earnings
enhancing in the year ending 31 March
2014, excluding the benefit of any cost or
revenue synergies.
Cash flow generation remained strong.
Year-end net debt was held flat at £61m,
after paying cash consideration of £10.4m
for the acquisition of Spendvision and
without any change to our active working
capital programme. Year-end net debt
represented 1.1x EBITDA (2011: 1.2x).
Reducing net debt has been a key focus 
of the Group over the last four years and
our consistently strong free cash flow,
coupled with active working capital
management, means that the latest net
debt figure is now almost half of the
£110m in 2008.
PENSIONS
On an accounting basis, the Group-wide
pension deficits amounted to £146m
before tax, or £113m after tax (2011: £89m),
reflecting the impact of continuing low
interest rates on the net present value of
liabilities. As already announced, the April
2011 triennial valuation of the principal 
UK scheme was agreed with only a small
increase in current cash contributions. 
Since then, we have sought to reduce
future volatility by offering enhanced terms

Strategy
Core activity
Provision of travel, expense and data management services to
multinational corporations or large national organisations
Market
Take advantage of the global growth in corporate travel and the
accelerating trend to outsource on a global basis
Clients
Grow market share through new and existing clients
Partnerships
Nurture long-term partnerships with suppliers who recognise
our value
Geography
Leverage our global footprint
Technology
Continue to develop our proprietary technology
Acquisition
Seek opportunities for strategic, low-risk M&A – either geographic
infill or additional product/service
to deferred members who transfer their
accrued benefits to alternative pension
providers. This offer has reduced the
March 2012 assets and liabilities by £33m.
The cost of implementing the offer
amounted to £1.4m and is included in
operating expenses for the period.
DIVIDEND
We operate a progressive dividend policy
that remains unchanged. In recognition of
the continued strong performance and
improved financial position, the Board is
recommending a final dividend of 1.4p per
share resulting in a full-year dividend of
2.0p per share. This represents an increase
of 33% on the prior year and is ahead of
the minimum figure of 1.8p per share that
we indicated in our half-year results
statement last November. Our dividend is
covered 4.2x (2011: 4.9x) by underlying EPS.
The final dividend will be paid on 30 July
2012 to shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 29 June 2012.
THE BOARD
Earlier this month we announced that
Philip Harrison would be joining us on
11 June as our new Group Finance Director,
taking over from Julian Steadman when he
retires at our AGM in July. We look forward
to welcoming Philip to HRG. On behalf of
the Board, the executive management
team and all the staff at HRG, I would like to
place on record our sincere thanks to Julian
for the positive contribution he made to
the Group during his time with us, and to
wish him the very best for the future.
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOK
Given the difficult macroeconomic outlook,
we expect trading conditions to remain
challenging during the current financial
year. However, since the year end, the
Group has continued to trade in line with
our expectations and we are confident that
our proven strategy and business model,
our robust financial position and strong
pipeline of new business opportunities will
enable HRG to continue to make good
progress in the year ahead.

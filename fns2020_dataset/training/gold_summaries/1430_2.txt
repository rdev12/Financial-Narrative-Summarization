 Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
VALUE TOGETHER
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Associated British Foods is a diversified international food, ingredients and 
retail group with sales of £12.9bn, 118,000 employees and operations in 47 
countries across Europe, southern Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australia. 
At the heart of the way we operate is a principle of ‘value together’ – the 
benefit that the group gains from each of the businesses being part of the 
larger organisation. This is manifest in how the corporate centre provides 
support to its operations and in the advantages that individual businesses 
gain from collaboration with each other.
Our businesses benefit from working alongside other group operations in 
related markets – allowing them to share knowledge, skills and best practice. 
The model also allows them, for example, to make joint investments, which 
would otherwise deliver insufficient returns. The businesses also work with 
each other to provide practical support such as making introductions in new 
countries and markets, hiring and developing people, providing back-office 
services and sharing office space, to name but a few.

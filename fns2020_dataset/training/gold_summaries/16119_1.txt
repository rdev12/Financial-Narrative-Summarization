 Launch of industry forum
In June 2013 TR was invited to speak at 
the inaugural CEO Global Fastener Industry 
Summit held in Jin Mao Tower, Shanghai, 
China. 
The key aim of the Summit has been to 
launch an industry high-end communication 
platform and establish a dialogue forum for 
the global fastener industry; an important 
sector seen as ‘traditional’ but operating in a 
rapidly changing era where, as we all witness, 
24/7 worldwide virtual communications are 
influencing the way we all lead our lives. 
Our CEO, Jim Barker was one of seven 
business leaders invited to address the 
150-strong Summit attended by decision 
makers from manufacturing companies, 
importers, exporters, distributors and 
wholesalers from across the world including 
Europe, mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
Japan, South Korea, Russia, Turkey and India.
Jim delivered his key speech on 
‘Customers need a solution not 
just product itself’. 
He discussed how, in today’s world of 
advancing, ever-changing communication 
tools, customers look for more requirements 
on service – it is no longer about being just 
being able to deliver a pallet of goods – 
customers need a complete supply solution, 
which is a strong USP for TR.
Others focused on branding (with 
differentiation, authenticity, consistency and 
sustainability being the essences of brand 
value); the importance of new technologies 
and social media in promoting fastener 
products; China’s auto fastener market status; 
and supply chain analysis and the need for 
modern equipment and technology being key 
to ensure high quality fastener production.
The Summit which is to become an annual 
event, provided a significant opportunity 
for global business leaders to meet and 
discuss the current industrial hot issues, 
share different ideas, and strengthen 
communication and co-operation. 
“To be invited to speak 
on behalf of TR at such 
a high profile event 
in Asia, truly reflects 
our Company’s global 
standing”

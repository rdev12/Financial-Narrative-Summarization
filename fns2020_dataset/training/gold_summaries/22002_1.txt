 It has been a very busy year for N Brown as 
we continue to transform the way we operate 
as a fashion retailer – from a direct mail led 
model to a digital led model. We are midway 
through this journey and are delighted to see 
the benefits coming through, importantly 
delivering 11%
1
 profit growth in the second 
half of the year.
Introduction 
The transformation of our business 
model continues at pace. We have a clear 
focus on our three fashion Power Brands  
–  JD Williams, Simply Be and Jacamo,  
and I am pleased to report that revenue 
here was up 10% year-on-year. I am  
also pleased with the strong online 
metrics we are delivering, with online 
penetration at a new record 65%. We  
are taking decisive actions to improve  
the performance of our Traditional 
Segment which remains an important, 
profitable part of the Group. 
Our performance in FY16 was in line with 
expectations, with strong 11%
1
 profit 
growth achieved in H2, as we annualised a 
number of changes made to the business 
in FY15. We had a good Christmas period 
and for the first time were able to be truly 
agile in our trading approach, particularly 
for our digital brands. 
We continue to roll-out our systems 
investment programme, ‘Fit 4 the Future’ , 
and all areas of the business are focused 
on ensuring this lands on time and with 
minimal disruption. So far progress is  
on track and within budget. 
Looking forward, whilst we face 
challenging market conditions for  
the fashion sector overall, we remain 
confident in our ability to make further 
progress this year.  
This is based on the strong appeal of 
our specialist fit proposition, continuous 
improvement in the customer experience 
and changes in customer shopping 
behaviour, driven by targeted marketing.
Strategic progress
Our vision is to be the universally loved 
experts in fashion that fits, helping our 
customers look and feel amazing through 
our trusted family of fashion brands.  
We operate in attractive market niches  
– plus-size and age 50-plus – which we 
believe to be under-served by the fashion 
industry overall, providing our customers 
with high quality and competitive 
product offerings, fit-specialism and  
a strong delivery proposition. 
Foundations  
for future growth
We are really pleased with  
our performance to date in  
the USA. We have been building  
a sustainable, profitable business 
model, built upon customer 
loyalty, and this will serve us  
well when we accelerate our 
growth in this country. 
Beyond the USA, our future 
capability enabled by global  
ship anywhere will allow us to 
unlock the international potential 
of our brands. 
We are excited about the growth 
potential that our new Financial 
Services systems will give us. 
We will be able to charge 
variable APRs, allowing us to 
offer our customers a far more 
personalised choice of Financial 
Services products, broadening 
our appeal.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
SEIZING FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES
18
N Brown Group plc  
Annual Report & Accounts 2016 We are mid-way through a significant 
transformation which will allow us to 
deliver sustainable, profitable growth 
over the long term, driven by our four 
strategic foundations:
• Product 
• Price 
• People 
• Place 
Our systems transformation project,  
Fit 4 the Future, is progressing well. 
During the second half we launched our 
Simply Be Euro website (the first phase  
of our Global Multi-channel release) and 
Powercurve (the foundation of our Credit 
release). Both launches were on-time  
and results continue to be encouraging.
Fit 4 the Future is the largest project  
ever undertaken by the Group, and as 
such there are inevitably risks, but we 
continue to do everything possible to 
ensure that risks and business disruption 
are minimised and that the future benefits 
of the investment are maximised. The 
benefits case is unchanged and we 
expect these to start to ramp up from 
FY18 onwards. As previously disclosed, 
some of these benefits will be reinvested 
back into the business. 
The timetable for Fit 4 the Future is also 
unchanged. This August we plan to start 
the roll-out of our new web platform and 
new financial services systems, initially  
to the USA, and then to a number of our 
smaller UK brands in September. Our 
main brands will move onto the new 
systems in early 2017 , after peak trading. 
In May we completed the roll-out  
of the first phase of our Planning 
transformation, giving us improved 
tools for assortment and range 
planning. This will allow us greater 
visibility, control and consistency.  
The second phase of the Planning 
release, which will give us item-level 
forecasting tools, improving markdown 
efficiency, will go live in early 2017.
I am also happy to report that the 
warehouse extension at our main 
warehouse facility, in Shaw, is now 
complete and in the process of coming  
on stream. The project was completed  
on time and to budget. The new facility 
has doubled our through-put capacity, 
ensuring we continue to operate 
efficiently. Importantly it will also 
materially improve our next day 
availability, allow us to further extend  
our cut-off for next day delivery, and 
underpin our international expansion 
plans for the future. 
Outlook 
Trading since the year end has been 
subdued, with sales lower year on  
year. This is mainly the result of the 
industry backdrop which has been  
more challenging since January.  
We also have a headwind from our 
Traditional Segment which we believe  
we can address through improved 
targeted marketing. We expect to  
see performance strengthen over  
the first half. 
From a non-trading perspective, FX  
rates represent a significant challenge 
year on year and we have also decided  
to undertake a one-off exercise to more 
aggressively clear some one to two year 
old inventory, enabled by our new online 
clearance tools.
Overall, we remain confident in our  
ability to make further progress this year. 
This is based on the strong appeal of  
our specialist fit proposition, continuous 
improvement in the customer experience 
and changes in customer shopping 
behaviour, driven by targeted marketing.

Economic trends
The global economic backdrop  
is uncertain, with recent volatility, 
particularly in foreign exchange  
rates, as a result of the upcoming EU 
referendum, unhelpful particularly 
from a sourcing standpoint. 
Consumer confidence in the UK  
is currently relatively fragile. The 
introduction of the National Living 
Wage is a net positive for the Group, 
as it should result in higher disposable 
income for our customers, although 
cuts to benefits would likely be a 
negative. Overall, when forecasting 
we assume a generally benign 
economic environment. 
Retail trends
Shopping globally is increasingly 
online; the BRC estimates that over 
20% of all non-food retail spending 
now takes place online. We are 
well-placed to benefit from this trend, 
given our digital-first approach. 
Customers increasingly shop through 
their mobiles; again we are ahead of 
this trend, with 66% of traffic coming 
from mobile devices. From a delivery 
standpoint customers increasingly 
demand convenience; we now offer 
over 5,000 collection points and have 
a 9pm cut-off for next day delivery. 
Market trends
Customers are increasingly driven  
by product newness, with shopping 
‘just in time’ during the season having 
replaced traditional purchase trends of 
buying at the start of seasons. We are 
accordingly increasing the frequency 
of new products being offered to our 
customers, and to facilitate this are 
increasing our sourcing from countries 
closer to the UK. Competition in the 
UK retail sector remains as tough as 
ever; we believe our niche positions  
of plus-sizes and older customers are 
important against this backdrop.

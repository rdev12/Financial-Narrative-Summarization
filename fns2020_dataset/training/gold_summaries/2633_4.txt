Nebit Dag PSA
Burren’s operations in
Turkmenistan comprise the 
Nebit Dag PSA concession in
the west of the country. All of
Burren’s current production in
Turkmenistan comes from one
ﬁeld, Burun, which has been
producing since 1971 and
which Burren has operated
since 2000. Burren has
exploration rights over the 
rest of the Nebit Dag PSA
area which contains four other
developed ﬁelds operated 
by the state oil company.
India
Hindustan Oil Exploration Company
In February 2005 Burren purchased a 26% interest in HOEC, India’s
only publicly quoted E&P company outside the state-controlled
sector. Burren intends to increase its stake to as much as 51% 
via an open offer and the exercise of options, and to provide further
ﬁnancing at a later date as necessary to ﬁnance its major projects. 
HOEC has interests in the Cauvery basin, offshore Tamil Nadu; in the
Cambay basin, onshore Gujarat; and in Assam. Its major development
assets are in the Cauvery Basin, being a 100% operated interest in the
PY-1 block and a 21% non-operated interest in the PY-3 block.
Burren considers that HOEC represents an attractive opportunity 
to enter the Indian E&P sector.

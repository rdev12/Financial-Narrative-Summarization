In this my first full year as Group 
Chairman I am pleased to report that 
the last twelve months has been a busy 
period for the Haynes Group. Over 
the last couple of years the focus of 
management has been on the financial 
management of the business, ensuring 
the Group is well placed to meet the 
challenges associated 
with the global economic 
downturn. However, with a 
stable underlying business 
and a strong balance  
sheet, management can 
now once again re-focus 
their attention on to the 
operational aspects of our 
business.
During the year we 
have been working on 
the development of 
an electronic Haynes 
product utilising the 
technical automotive, 
IT and product 
design skills we 
have within the 
Group. In the US, 
we have also been 
working closely 
with our key 
retail customers 
to implement 
new marketing 
initiatives to help improve the 
in-store display of our products. While in 
the UK, recognising the increasing cost 
of final salary pension schemes, we have 
put in place a benefit restructuring plan 
for the employee pension scheme with 
the intention to help place the scheme on 
a more affordable basis going forward. 
Whilst these projects do not directly 
impact on the results of the reportable 
year they have, nevertheless, been 
important projects during the year.
results summary
Turning to the results, like-for-like Group 
revenue ended the year 1% ahead of the 
prior year at £33.76 million. The like-for-
like revenue reflects the change in terms 
with a significant US customer, which 
reduced US revenue by £1.02 million. 
This was matched by a corresponding 
reduction in advertising allowances.
During the year, the Group’s development

The Board
I was delighted to announce the 
appointment of Alex Kwarts (Managing 
Director of Vivid Holding BV) to the 
Group Board. Alex is an IT professional 
with considerable experience in the 
development of IT and web based 
products. The Vivid team have an important 
role to play in the development of a multi-
media electronic platform for Haynes 
products. 
On 9 September 2010, Andrew Garner 
stood down as a Non-Executive Director 
from the Group Board after five years 
of service to pursue his other business 
interests. Andrew made a valuable 
contribution to the 
Group during his time 
on the Board and we 
wish him well for the 
future.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 9.5 pence per share (2010: 9.3 pence), 
which together with the interim dividend 
paid in April gives a total dividend for the 
year of 15.7 pence per share (2010:  
15.5 pence). Subject to the final approval 
by shareholders, the final dividend will be 
paid on 26 October 2011 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business 
on 7 October 2011. The shares will be 
declared ex-dividend on 5 October 2011. 
When considering the amount of dividend 
to distribute annually the Board takes into 
account the movement in Group earnings 
as well as the existing and future cash 
requirements of the Haynes businesses.
People
On behalf of the Group Board I would 
like to acknowledge the contribution of 
all our employees for their hard work and 
dedication in helping to drive the business 
forward during the year. With operations 
in eight countries and covering three 
continents Haynes is very much a global 
business and we are cognisant of the part 
played by our employees around the World 
in helping the Group achieve its targets. 
Future prospects
I am very encouraged by the Group’s long 
term growth prospects. The development of 
an electronic multi-media product presents 
the Group with an exciting opportunity, not 
only to work with our existing customer 
base but also to target new customers 
and open up new geographical markets 
in the coming years. At the same time 
our strong cash generation provides the 
Group with the financial strength to pursue 
complimentary acquisition opportunities 
which will augment our own internal growth 
plans and help to drive further growth in the 
business.

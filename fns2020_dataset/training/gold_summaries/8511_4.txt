 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT ASIA & EUROPE
Asia
ISG Asia has had a record year contributing 
an operating profit of £1.8m (2007 - £0.8m).  
ISG Asia volumes increased by 4% to £52m 
(2007 - £50m), whilst fee income increased 
by 94% to £14.9m (2007 - £7.7m) due to a 
full year contribution from ISG Asia (2007 
- eight months) and from Commtech (2007 - 
one month), our commissioning and testing 
business, and an increase in the proportion 
of project management activity in North Asia. 
As a result operating margin on fee income 
has increased to 11.9% (2007 - 10.2%). The 
business continues to benefit from significant 
projects for our international banking clients, 
including projects undertaken in the year for 
Standard Chartered Bank, Morgan Stanley, JP 
Morgan, Merrill Lynch and UBS.  
In China, from our three offices in Beijing, 
Tianjin and Shanghai, activity levels increased 
by 79% to £5.3m, with projects undertaken 
for Apple, Nokia, Armani and Bohai Bank. In 
Hong Kong, activity levels increased 12% to 
£13.3m with the level of project management 
fee work increasing 76% to £8.5m. As at 30 
June 2008, the forward order book is £34m 
(2007 - £32m), with 24% being fee based 
project management work (2007 - 14%).  
Whilst the Asian economies are not immune 
to global economic trends, the most recent 
IMF and Data Monitor forecasts continue to 
project high single figure percentage GDP 
growth in our key markets of China, Hong 
Kong, Singapore and the Middle East. 
 
Our existing Dubai operations made a small 
contribution of £0.1m in the year to June 
2008. With the imminent completion of our fit 
out joint venture with the Al Habtoor Leighton 
Group, we would anticipate this to grow 
substantially in the next 18 months.
Europe 
With our acquisition of the remaining 80% 
of IASA in September 2007, the contribution 
from our European activities increased 
substantially, with volumes increasing to 
£31m (2007 - £5m) and fee income to £6.2m 
(2007 - £1.2m). On a like for like basis the 
business showed a growth in volumes in 
the year of 43%. The business contributed 
an operating profit of £3.1m (2007 - £0.7m) 
resulting in an operating margin on fee 
income of 49.8% (2007 - 56.2%).  
The business delivered projects for 
ExxonMobil, Iron Mountain, RBS and 
Signature in Paris, Vodafone and Fidelity  
in Luxembourg, Cardinal Health in Geneva 
and several projects for Google, Adobe and 
Right Management across a number of 
European cities, with an average contract 
value of £0.9m.
 
As at June 2008, the business has an order 
book of £8m, a level consistent with June 
2007, which is a typical level given the desire 
of European clients to complete projects 
before the summer period and initiate new 
projects after the summer period. The 
pipeline is strong and since year end  
secured work has increased to £17m. 1. Client: Google

Prospects
At the year end, our total order book was 
£1,051m (2007 - £843m), with our in year 
order book at a record level of £739m (2007 - 
£696m). The recent large project wins of the 
Velodrome for the 2012 London Olympics, 
the new UK headquarters for KPMG, the large 
data centre in the North East of England and 
the five education projects totalling £130m 
have increased our confidence levels for the 
current and subsequent financial years.
  
We expect that continued growth in Asia, our 
new joint venture in the Middle East and our 
expanding European operations will all enable 
the group to lessen its dependence on the  
UK market.
In the UK the greatest impact so far from the 
deteriorating economic climate has been in 
the private residential market where we have 
little exposure. In anticipation of tightening 
commercial demand, we have reduced our 
dependence in London on the office market 
whilst increasing our regional involvement 
in education and affordable housing.  
Our banking and food retail framework 
relationships are also expected to deliver 
more activity in the current year. 
 
Our strategy is to continue to spread our 
risk by identifying joint venture opportunities 
or bolt-on acquisitions overseas in growing 
markets across different geographies. Whilst 
we are not immune to macro economic 
pressures, our expansion over the last three 
years into the regions, retail and overseas has 
made us more robust and resilient, particularly 
to the downturn in the office market in the 
City of London.

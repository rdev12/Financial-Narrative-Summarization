Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
04
2010 was a year of significant 
progress for the Company, with 
Lamprell starting to feel the 
commercial benefits of the 
expansion both of its physical 
presence and its service offering. 
The Company reported revenues of 
USD 503.8 million for the year, an 
increase of 18.4 per cent on 2009, 
and net profit of USD 65.2 million, 
129.6 per cent higher than the prior 
year. At the close of the year the 
Company’s order book stood at a 
record high of USD 850 million.
The Company’s careful management 
of capital expenditure during the 
economic crisis, coupled with a 
carefully phased expansion of its 
Hamriyah facility, provided a strong 
foundation from which to meet the 
opportunities of an improving 
market.
It was particularly pleasing, in that 
context, to see a number of sizeable 
new build contracts awarded in 
2010 for both jackup rigs and 
offshore wind turbine installation 
vessels. These included the award 
in July, of the USD 317 million 
contract by National Drilling 
Company, Abu Dhabi, for the 
construction and delivery of two 
jackup rigs. This contract supported 
our view that there were (and 
continue to be) a growing number of 
opportunities in the new build rig 
market. This view was reinforced by 
the award, in November, of a USD 
210 million contract by Eurasia 
Drilling Company Limited for a 
jackup rig (the largest contract in 
Lamprell’s history for the 
construction of a single unit), and by 
the award, in February of this year, 
by Greatship Global Energy 
Services Pte. Ltd. of a contract for 
the construction of a new build 
jackup rig.
These wins came on top of 
important awards earlier in the year 
in one of the Company’s newer 
markets. In February 2010, the 
Company won a significant contract

amounting to USD 320.4 million 
from Fred Olsen Windcarrier AS for 
the construction of two offshore 
wind turbine installation vessels. 
In June 2010, the Company was 
awarded a USD 129.0 million 
contract by Seajacks for the design, 
construction and delivery of an 
offshore wind turbine installation 
vessel. Both these contracts 
reinforce Lamprell’s strong position 
in a market with significant medium 
to long-term potential.
The Company experienced a slow 
down in rig refurbishment in 2010, 
with jackup rig upgrade and 
refurbishment activity at a lower level 
of average expenditure than in 2009, 
however there are now signs of 
recovery in this segment, and the 
Company has continued to see 
evidence of improvements in most 
of its other operating markets. 
Lamprell’s bid activity is at a  
record high.
I am pleased to announce that, 
having considered the current 
market conditions, profit earned 
and cash generated during the 
year ended 31 December 2010, 
the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 9.50 cents per share. If 
approved, the final dividend will 
be paid on 17 June 2011 to 
shareholders who were on the 
register on 13 May 2011.
Having been appointed Chief 
Operating Officer in March 2010, 
I was delighted to welcome Chris 
Hand to the Board in January 2011.
I am confident that Lamprell’s 
reputation for quality, its technical 
capabilities and expertise and 
timely project execution and 
delivery, will enable the Company 
to continue to deliver value for all its 
stakeholders.
I am particularly grateful, once again, 
for the dedication and hard work of 
all Lamprell’s management and staff.

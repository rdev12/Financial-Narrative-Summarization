EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc
EKF Diagnostics is a global medical diagnostics 
business with a long history in point-of-care 
testing and manufacturing reagents for use in 
central laboratories.
Our point-of-care (POC) products, most of which 
are designed and manufactured in Germany, have 
a hard earned reputation for ease of use, reliability 
and accuracy from professionals working in 
diabetes, blood banking and sports medicine.
The POC business is built around a large installed 
based of analysers each of which generates a 
regular demand for tests, often for the entire life 
cycle of the analyser. This approach – sometimes 
known as the ‘razor/razorblade’ model – permits 
a percentage of organic growth each year.

1.0 Strategic Review
The hematology product range within EKF 
Diagnostics, is the largest in terms of revenues 
and the size of the installed base.
The acquisition of DiaSpect and Separation 
Technology in 2014 allowed EKF to offer an 
unparalleled range of hemoglobin and hematocrit 
point-of-care blood analysers manufactured in 
Germany and the USA.
Point of Care: Hematology
The EKF Diagnostics portfolio of hemoglobin 
and hematocrit analysers is unique within the  
point-of-care diagnostics sector. 
Sales are primarily focused around two markets 
– public health initiatives such as anaemia 
screening programmes, and private practices 
where the cost of testing is paid for by an 
insurance company or the patient.
To approach these markets EKF has two 
distinct strategies: firstly, OEM partnerships with 
international distributor/manufacturers such as 
Fresenius Kabi; and secondly agreements with 
smaller distributors who are focused on the public 
health opportunities within their own countries.
Sports medicine and veterinary medicine provide 
two additional niche sources of customer for EKF 
distributors. 
EKF believes that this portfolio can provide it with 
a competitive advantage to grow its market share.
 
Strategy
• Handheld analyser utilising 
reagentless methodology
• Benefits of speed to result 
(one second), and shelf-life of 
microcuvettes
• Successor to DiaSpect 
Hemoglobin T
• Tests serum, plasma, aqueous 
solutions or stored erythrocytes
• Estimates the degree of 
hemolysis
• Results in less than two seconds
• Reagent-free microcuvettes
• Laboratory hematocrit 
centrifuge and analyser
• Processes multiple samples
DiaSpect Tm DiaSpect Hemoglobin T Low
HemataStat II
TM
• Uses ‘gold standard’ 
methodology (reagent filled 
microcuvettes)
• Data management capability; 
provides a hematocrit 
calculation
• Proven, robust analyser sold 
worldwide
• Hematocrit analyser using 
unique ultrasound technology
• Strong presence in US blood 
banking sector
• International version also 
provides hemoglobin calculation

1.0 Strategic Review
EKF’s diabetes range aims to provide affordable, 
easy-to-use technology that reduce the costs of 
long-term healthcare of the diabetic and pre-
diabetic population.
Diabetes has been at the core of EKF’s strategy 
for well over 10 years starting with the early 
models of the Biosen C-Line and Biosen S-Line 
glucose analysers. More recently HbA1c analysers 
have been launched that address the diabetes 
screening market.
Although they do not strictly belong within 
a point-of-care framework, clinical chemistry 
reagents such as Glycated Serum Protein and 
Beta-Hydroxybutyrate add further provenance 
to EKF’s claim to be a significant contributor to 
diabetes care worldwide.
Point of Care: Diabetes Care
Although glucose testing is the most commonly 
used method of determining glycaemic control 
within diabetics, HbA1c is the accepted long 
term barometer of patient well being and their 
compliance with the treatment regimes.
The growth in popularity of HbA1c measurement 
has seen an increasing number of entrants to 
the point-of-care HbA1c market focused on GP 
surgeries and diabetes clinics.
2016 saw the formal transfer of Quo-Test and 
Quo-Lab to EKF’s Barleben site completed.
 
The switch began in 2015 with the transfer of 
plant and knowledge-transfer to the German 
engineering team, and continued into 2016 with the 
hand-over of regulatory control for the products. 
These changes have allowed EKF Diagnostics to 
make significant operational savings through the 
centralisation of manufacturing, warehousing, 
logistics and customer service.
Strategy
Product portfolio
• HbA1c testing (Glycated 
Hemoglobin)
• Same methodology as Quo-Lab 
but fully automated
• Simple operation requires 
minimal training
Quo-Test® A1c
• HbA1c testing (Glycated 
Hemoglobin)
• Results in four minutes using a 
unique methodology
• Targeted at developing world 
markets
Quo-Lab® A1c
• Glucose and/or lactate 
measurement
• Three models, each aimed at 
different settings
• Used as the benchmark for 
blood glucose monitors in China

1.0 Strategic Review
Maternal and Women’s Health focuses primarily 
on diagnostics used to address conditions and 
complications associated with pregnancy and 
child birth.
Sales include revenues from Creamatocrit 
centrifuges and hemoglobin meters used in 
Women and Infant Clinics, pregnancy test kits 
and HbA1c analysers used to diagnose gestational 
diabetes in pregnant women.
Point of Care: Maternal & Women’s Health
EKF’s Maternal and Women’s Health business 
unit has seen steady growth since it was created.
SensPoint is awaiting CE marking whilst the 
product team continue to work with key opinion 
leaders to educate the future target market on 
the need for a protocol in the use of lactate in 
obstetric medicine.
In parallel there is a slowly building commercial 
interest in this market in Europe. Some medical 
professionals are using the Lactate Scout+ to 
provide accurate lactate readings within ten 
seconds.
Lactate Scout+ uses the same strip system as 
SensPoint but does not include SensPoint’s data 
management functionality.
Lactate Scout+ has historically been sold into 
sports medicine, specifically endurance activities 
such as cross-country skiing, cycling and rowing. 
This market also contributes significantly to 
Biosen revenues who use the lactate testing 
function in the preparation of elite squads of 
athletes such as Premier League football teams 
and Olympians.

1.0 Strategic Review
EKF, through its wholly owned subsidiary Stanbio 
Laboratory, has had a presence within central 
laboratory dating back over 50 years. During this 
time it has built a global customer base for its 
clinical chemistry reagents that can be used on 
most open-channel analyser platforms.
The Central Laboratory business also includes the 
manufacture of enzymes, manufactured at EKF 
Life Sciences in Elkhart, Indiana. 
From this facility EKF Life Sciences sells enzymes 
used in Stanbio’s clinical chemistry portfolio as 
well as providing contract manufacturing services 
for third parties.
The acquisition of Separation Technology Inc. 
provided EKF with a third element to its 
central laboratory offering. As well as being a 
manufacturer of hematology products STI has a 
heritage in manufacturing high quality, US-built, 
mini-centrifuges.
Central Laboratory
The central laboratory market continues to 
experience relatively low levels of growth. This 
is in part because sales of chemistry reagents 
are inextricably linked to the provision of the 
analysers on which the tests are performed. EKF 
Diagnostics’ approach to the clinical chemistry 
market changed in late 2015 with the launch of 
the Altair 240, a benchtop analyser calibrated to 
run the Stanbio Chemistry range of reagents.
Further opportunities continue to exist in 
niche markets. Sales of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate 
Liquicolor® reagent continue to be healthy with 
a strong performance from US distributors who 
have developed a market capitalising on the 
withdrawl of a previous method of testing for 
ketosis.
More than 1,000 US hospitals now use EKF’s Beta- 
Hydroxybutyrate reagent. A similar approach 
is being used for Procalcitonin (PCT) in Europe 
where EKF has undertaken awareness activity 
using key opinion leaders in target markets.
Strategy

• Liquid reagent for the early 
detection of ketosis
• Primarily sold in USA through 
national distribution networks

Highlights
“These record results demonstrate the strength and cash generation
characteristics of the Group. Together with the strong ungeared balance sheet,
they provide us with a secure platform from which to grow our traditional
business lines and to diversify carefully and cautiously into new ones.”
Andrew Davison, Chairman
“Since its inception, we have run our business in a manner that is both
conservative and relatively unfashionable. We don’t manage hedge funds.
We don’t manage any money from an absolute return perspective, preferring
to manage money relative to a benchmark. We manage money using a team
approach. We do not encourage the cult of the individual.
“Due to the outperformance of the emerging market asset class we have
experienced significant rebalancing. These rebalancings totalled approximately
US$269 million. Fortunately, as a result of ongoing good investment
performance, these lost assets were replaced. In my opinion this puts us in 
a good position for a bear market because this will mean that clients are, to
a significant extent, presently adjusting their exposure to emerging markets,
reducing the need for this to occur when markets are falling.”
Barry Olliff, Chief Executive

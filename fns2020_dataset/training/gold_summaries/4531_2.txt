ProdUCts
—WhatW e Do Best
own bought products fall into three
main categories.
the ﬁrst is debenhams’ own label which
includes Collection, mantaray, maine
new england, bluezoo and Le Vrai
gourmet.these brands represent our
core customer offer.
the second is designers at debenhams,
the portfolio of exclusive brands listed
above, which is an important point of
difference in an increasingly crowded
high street.
the third is international brands such
as Levi strauss, nike, ben sherman,
Chanel and estée Lauder. international
brands extend our product range and give
customers the well-known brands that
they love.
ConCessions
—Increasing Choice
Concession brands offer customers
a further level of choice.they have
historically been strong in areas where
debenhams’ own bought brands have
been under-represented, such as young
fashion and footwear in womenswear
and suiting in menswear.
Key concessions include wallis,warehouse,
miss selfridge, Jacques Vert, Kurt geiger
and tripp.

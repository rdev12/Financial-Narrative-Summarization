• 	 AMERICAS INDUSTRIAL 2008 was a year of 
strong recovery, with an excellent performance 
in terms of operating margin growth and 
working capital reduction.
• 		 EUROPE INDUSTRIAL Significant cost 
reductions in manufacturing at our plants in 
Berlin and Königswinter in germany. Successful 
development of new products with enhanced 
insulating properties and longevity, which are 
beginning to renew the product range.
• 	 TERRAM Responding to recessionary trends in 
the British and French construction industries, 
through improved productivity, greater sales 
efforts in higher-margin segments such as 
laminates, rail and drainage composites and 
innovation in the defence sector.
• 	 AIRLAID A strong recovery year in Asia, 
with line 1 running at record levels and the 
construction of line 2 completed, but a most 
disappointing year in Europe, with the failure 
to achieve cost targets on the new airlaid 
line in Italy leading to its closure.
• 	 CONSUMER FABRICS A strong recovery 
year in North America, with a marked 
improvement in margins following the 
restructuring actions taken in 2006 and 
2007. A difficult year in Europe, as over-
capacity in the industry led to significant 
price and volume pressure.

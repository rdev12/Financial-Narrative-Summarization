Results 
The Group has achieved record results 
for the year ended 30 September 2012 
ahead of market expectations and has 
strengthened its position as a provider of 
Engineering Services to UK infrastructure.
Proﬁt before income tax was up 22% to 
£10.0m (2011: £8.2m) on Group revenue of 
£337.4m (2011: £352.8m). Adjusted earnings 
per share increased by 43% to 13.9p (2011: 
9.7p). Basic earnings per share increased 
by 259% to 7.9p (2011: 2.2p).
Results for the year are stated after charging 
exceptional costs of £1.1m (2011: £5.2m) 
and a loss of £2.4m from the discontinued 
operation, C&A Pumps Ltd, which was 
sold in November 2012 for a nominal 
consideration. These amounts have been 
excluded from the adjusted ﬁnancial results 
to show the underlying performance of the 
business. The exceptional costs in the 
period relate to the planned scale down 
of Specialist Building and the integration 
of our rail business following the acquisition 
of Amco.
It is particularly pleasing that Engineering 
Services revenue grew by 24% to £214.1m 
(201 1: £172.8m), with operating proﬁt prior to 
exceptional items and amortisation up 28% 
to £9.6m (201 1: £7 .5m), an increase in margin 
to 4.5% from 4.3%. Both our Nuclear and Rail 
businesses, which represent over 60% of 
our Engineering Services activity, performed 
strongly and have growing order books for 
both the new ﬁnancial year and beyond.
In Specialist Building, our focus on selective 
niche markets in the South, has delivered 
increased operating proﬁt of £2.1m (2011: 
£1.9m) prior to exceptional items and an 
improvement in margin to 1.7% from 1.1% 
on revenue of £123.1m (2011: £178.9m).
The Group has achieved record results 
for the year ended 30 September 2012 
ahead of market expectations.

Review of 
operations
Group 
overview
The Group's contracted order book at 
30 September 2012 stood at £331m (2011: 
£286m), a 16% increase from one year ago, 
with the Engineering Services order book 
up 31% to £235m (2011: £179m). 
The Group has reduced net debt to 
£5.5m (2011: £6.8m) comprising a loan 
of £7.5m (2011: £12.5m) and cash of 
£2.0m (2011: £5.7m). 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend 
at 2.10p per share, increasing the full year 
dividend by 5% to 3.15p (2011: 3.00p). 
The dividend will be paid on 4 March 2013 
to shareholders on the register as at 
1 February 2013. The dividend is 4.4x 
(2011: 3.2x) covered by adjusted 
earnings per share. 
Outlook
The Group is successfully positioned as 
a provider of engineering services to key 
clients in the UK’s Energy, Environmental 
and Infrastructure markets, and has been 
reclassiﬁed on the London Stock Exchange 
as a Business Support Services company. 
Last year, the Board declared its ambition 
to grow turnover to over £500m by 2014, 
through both organic growth and selective 
acquisitions, with targets that Engineering 
Services will account for at least 70% of 
Group revenue and that the Group operating 
margin will exceed 3%. These results and 
our strong forward order book demonstrate 
that the Group is well placed to achieve 
these targets. 
Our acquisition of Amco in February 2011 
has proved highly successful, delivering 
results ahead of our expectations and 
generating cash such that we have now 
repaid 50% of the £15m term loan taken out 
for the acquisition. Our reducing net debt 
and gearing of 61% (2011: 76%) together 
with our interest cover of over 16x provides 
the Group with funding ﬂexibility should 
further suitable acquisition opportunities 
be identiﬁed. 
Our Engineering Services operations continue 
to focus on securing further sustainable 
framework positions, concentrating on areas 
of non-discretionary spend. In Specialist 
Building, our businesses are delivering 
improved operating margins as they target 
the stable markets of High Quality Residential, 
New Build Affordable Housing and Retail in 
the South where the Group has particular 
expertise and experience. 
The Board believes our key markets 
and framework positions provide good and 
continuing opportunities through 2013 and 
beyond and that the Group is well positioned 
to deliver further proﬁtable growth.

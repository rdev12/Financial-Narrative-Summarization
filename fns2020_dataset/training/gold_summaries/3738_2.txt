Cohort plc was established early in 2006 to take 
advantage of opportunities to grow a business in the 
international defence technical services market. 
The business ﬂ oated on AIM (the London Stock 
Exchange’s specialist market for growth companies) 
in March 2006 following the merger with Systems 
Consultants Services Limited (SCS). 
SCS is a leading independent defence technical 
services business based in Henley-on-Thames and is 
Cohort’s current sole trading subsidiary. Further 
targeted acquisitions of complementary businesses 
will follow, with the aim of building shareholder value 
over the medium term.

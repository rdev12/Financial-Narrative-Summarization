“2004/05 was a year of significant investment to
support our future growth. We are working on an
unprecedented number and scale of opportunities 
to build and grow the business, both organically 
and by acquisition. ”

Alpha Airports Group Plc
Annual Report 2004/05
Review of the year
Group sales for the twelve months
ended 31 January 2005, including
turnover from joint ventures, were up
12.8% on the previous year at £497.2m
(2003/04: £440.9m). Turnover,
excluding joint ventures, was 10.6%
above last year at £487.8m. This
increase arose from continuing strong
growth of short-haul passengers and
flights at the UK’s regional airports,
and recovery on long-haul traffic –
particularly at London Heathrow and 
in Jordan. We made a strong start in
the first half, which weakened slightly
in the second half with the loss of the
Air Canada business at Heathrow. 
The pre-tax profit (before exceptional
items and goodwill amortisation) of
£18.9m was 12.9% below the previous
year (2003/04: £21.7m) and can be
attributed to a number of specific
Flight Services development issues.
Profit before taxation was down 32.8%
at £11.7m (2003/04: £17.4m).
The start-up of Australian flight 
service contracts for Cathay Pacific
and Royal Brunei at Sydney, Brisbane
and Melbourne resulted in start-up
costs as these flight kitchens became
operational. These kitchens are
operating at very low capacity
utilisation and will continue to incur
small operating losses until further
long-haul airline customers are 
won. Losses on the inflight retailing
contract with Qantas, which
commenced in May, continued 
into the second half and this contract
has now been renegotiated and
extended for six further years.
Following the loss of the Air Canada
contract from September, we decided
to hold onto our highly qualified
London Heathrow staff which ensured
a successful start-up for American
Airlines in February 2005. Further,
small losses were incurred in our UK
Flight Services bond network, due to
implementation of new IT systems,
which will provide future central stock
control and procurement capability.
There were losses in Amsterdam Flight
Services as this kitchen went through a
transition from a previous focus on
short-haul, charter logistics to a high
quality, full services long-haul
catering offer .
Dividend
The Board has recommended an
increase in the final dividend of 7.1% 
to 3.0 pence per share, giving a full 
year dividend per share of 4.0 pence
(2003/04: 3.8 pence). The dividend 
is payable on 8 June to shareholders 
on the register as at 6 May 2005.
Outlook
2005/06 has started as planned, 
and trading remains in line with
expectations. Within Asia, passenger
figures are down 15.7% year on year 
as a result of the tsunami. We
anticipate this trend will continue
throughout the first half of this year,
with a recovery in the second half. 
Over the past four years we have
transformed our business models to
adapt to a larger, faster-growing, more
competitive aviation market, investing
significantly in people, innovation 
and infrastructure. We continue to
concentrate on enhancing our core
business offerings and, with a healthy
balance sheet, excellent customer
relationships and a strong team in
place, are well positioned to take the
business forward and capitalise on 
our investments.

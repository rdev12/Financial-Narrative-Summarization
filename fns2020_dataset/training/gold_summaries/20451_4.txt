Transformation, 2016  
We expect to be able to explore, share and 
transact online at work, at home, on the 
move, with a laptop, tablet, or mobile device. 
We pay bills using secure online banking, 
we browse and purchase from trusted 
retailers, and watch videos on demand. 
When these products and services work we 
think nothing of it. When they don’t work 
we quickly get frustrated: the shopping 
basket that freezes on checkout, the 
picking order that gets ‘held up’ between 
the retailer and the warehouse, the 
returned package that can’t be traced. 
AT A GLANCE
In our professional lives, the delays with 
systems not only frustrate us but cost 
the business in productivity. Timesheets, 
booking systems, inventories, databases 
that don’t load, or take an age to process. 
All while we tap our fingers, do something 
else, come back to it, or grumble at the 
screen. Those of us on the customer 
frontline are charged with pacifying 
the customer: “I’m sorry, it’s taking a 
while to load today. Bear with me.”
As consumers we try to diagnose the 
problem ourselves: is it the wifi, the 
application, the website, the device we’re 
using? We wonder why some products 
and services seem always to work while  Notice of AGM Glossary of terms Sources Governance

stakes are high and unpredictable digital 
experience quality threatens all of this.
A consistent digital experience is possible 
for digital products and services. This is  
the problem we at Actual Experience solve.
At Actual Experience, we are focused 
on service providers as channels to take 
our product to market. Our product, 
Actual Work, enables service providers 
to significantly reduce the time it takes 
to pinpoint digital experience issues. 
Being built into the service providers’ 
offering for their own customers 
provides Actual Experience with an 
opportunity to address a vast market.

of the brands providing those services. 
Poor digital experiences can translate to 
loss of customer loyalty and advocacy, 
two key metrics which impact revenue. 
This inconsistent digital experience 
threatens the ambitions of today’s 
businesses. Ecommerce revenues 
worldwide are already generating 
$22.1 trillion

HOW IT WORKS IN PRACTICE
HOW WE DO IT
Digital Users (DUs) are lightweight 
software, deployed as close to the point of 
use as possible to represent user types for 
digital services. They receive instructions, 
make standard measurements to invoke 
different components of a digital service 
architecture, and send the results to the 
Analytics Cloud for processing. DUs are 
free and unlimited.
The Actual Experience Analytics Cloud, 
based on decades of academic research 
and patented technology, receives data 
from the Digital Users to provide an objective 
score of digital experience quality. The 
analytics show how well digital products 
and services are working right now and 
across time, and why services are behaving 
that way. We charge by analytic capacity.
Actual Work delivers the real-time analysis 
to dashboards on desktops, laptops, 
smartphones and tablets. The data is 
clearly and intuitively presented at the level 
required. Our analytics provide high level 
scores, full quality history and supplier 
behaviour, with all the detail from the 
supporting rich data.
As part of their digital 
transformation, businesses 
around the world spent 
more than $2.6 trillion on 
their IT infrastructure last 
year, according to Gartner
2
. 
However, even the world’s most recognised 
digital products and services still offer an 
inconsistent experience to customers and 
end users. This variability at the heart of 
the world’s digital economy is frustrating 
customers and eroding business revenue.
We used Actual Work to monitor variability 
on the digital supply chains of some of the 
world’s largest brands in the US and UK. 
In February and March 2016 we analysed 
108 brands from a variety of industries 
including banking, video streaming, 
gambling, retail, ecommerce and travel.
Our analytics showed a small handful of those 
brands managed to deliver a consistent 
experience even across the internet. Perfect 
experience looks like this on the Actual Work 
dashboard: an almost flat line, with little 
variability. A perfect quality score of between 
77 and 81 means your digital products are fit 
for purpose. Your digital supply chain is lean. 
Your investments in customer experience  
are effective.

A score above 80 means you are over-
invested in your supply chain and your 
customers or staff will not benefit. 
A score below 60 means customers 
and staff start to give up, yet other 
diagnostic tools will not see this.
A consistent experience is uncommon. 
The analytics show that the digital 
customer journey is highly variable 
falling below ‘perfect’ for all but a few 
of the brands we looked at. Here is 
an example of a more typical poor 
experience which is high in variability. 
This inconsistency can leave customers 
with an unreliable digital service. At 
its worst, it can result in customers 
not being able to properly access 
digital products and services.
Business leaders acknowledge that digital 
experience quality is critical to business 
success. Yet customers and employees 
experience variability. Leaders

 globally 
are confident they are focusing on the 
right things to reduce the variability of 
the experience people are having. Some 
however believe they cannot affect the 
quality because the product or service 
is delivered over the internet, which 
they cannot control end-to-end.

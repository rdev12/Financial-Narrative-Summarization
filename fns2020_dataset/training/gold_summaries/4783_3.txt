Chairman’s Statement
The acquisition of FCP Internet (FCP) 
in July 2013 has once again proven 
our ability to acquire and integrate 
businesses successfully. The FCP team is 
now settled into our wider Group, client 
retention has been good and the evolve™ 
SaaS product is continuing to perform 
well in the market. FCP contributed 
£472,000 to revenue and £55,000 
to profit before taxation in 2013.
It is the view of the Board that product 
development is fundamental to the 
long term success of the business and 
as a result 2014 will see us continue 
to invest in the development of 
software within both of our divisions.
Dividends
The Board was pleased to increase the 
interim dividend payment in September 
2013 to 1.25p (2012: 1.2p). The Board 
has recommended a final dividend of 
2.6p per share (2012: 2.5p), subject to 
shareholder approval, payable on 25 
June 2014 to holders on the register 
on 16 May 2014. Shares will trade 
ex-dividend from 14 May 2014. This 
takes the total dividend based on the 
2013 results to 3.85p, and gives a yield 
of 3.5% on a share price of 111p. 
This represents another year on 
year increase in the dividend, in 
line with our progressive dividend 
policy, which illustrates the Board’s 
confidence in the future prospects of 
the Group. The business is committed 
to maintaining its policy of investing 
in its products and services whilst 
rewarding its shareholders.
Staff
Our staff are fundamentally important 
to the success of the business. It is 
through their efforts, commitment 
and determination that we continue 
to be a leading technology provider 
in the sectors we serve. On behalf 
of the Board I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all of them.
Outlook
The Board retains a confident outlook 
on prospects for the Group. 
At this stage, while first half revenues 
are expected to be ahead of the 
equivalent period for 2013, it is 
anticipated that first half pre-tax profit 
will be below that delivered in 2013. We 
announced in summer 2013 that we 
were strengthening our management 
team and this, along with the 
increased amortisation of our product 
development, are two of the key reasons 
behind the increase in expected costs. 
However, taking the year as a whole, 
the Group expects to make positive 
progress in 2014, the scale of which will 
become clearer as the year evolves. 
Within our Dillistone Systems division, 
we have sold more new systems in 
the first quarter of 2014 than we did 
in the same period of 2013, however, 
income from new systems sales in 2014 
is lagging that seen in 2013, in part 
due to an increase in the proportion 
of purchases delivered on the cloud 
subscription model, which has an 
impact on near term revenues. 
Our Voyager division delivers products 
into a range of recruiting markets. 
Performance has varied across 
these, with a number of products 
delivering a strong performance. 
With a strong profile of recurrent 
revenues, the Group continues 
to generate cash allowing us to 
continue to invest in improving 
our products and services whilst 
maintaining our dividend policy.
Both the Dillistone Systems and 
Voyager Software divisions anticipate 
making significant product related 
announcements later in the year.

Non-Executive Chairman
28 April 2014
The Group has again enjoyed another 
successful year in 2013, delivering its best 
ever performance in terms of both revenue 
and operating profit. Revenue was up 15 % 
to £8.1m and adjusted operating profits up 
7% to £1.8m. We have two divisions – 
Dillistone Systems and Voyager Software 
– and both delivered top line and bottom  
line growth.

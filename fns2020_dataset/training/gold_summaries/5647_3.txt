 Core values and behaviours
I strongly believe that good governance is founded on the core values and 
behaviours established by the Board and communicated down through  
the Group. The Group has a strong culture of high standards of business 
ethics based on clear principles. The Board’s participation in the Company’s 
compliance training programmes, and its commitment to the development 
of new policies and practices in response to the increasing level of regulation 
impacting on its global operations, serves to ensure that the “tone from 
the top” is clearly understood and reinforced.
 
As the Company continues to grow in size and complexity, one of the 
greatest challenges facing the Board is to ensure that we have in place  
the right people, culture and processes to exploit fully the opportunities  
for further balanced growth and to effectively manage the risks to which 
the Company is exposed. 
Board evaluation
It is essential that the Company has a fully engaged and committed Board 
with an appropriate mix of skills, experience and knowledge, which is 
capable of engaging in positive and constructive debate to meet such 
challenges. In order to assess how the Board is performing, during the year 
an external facilitator, Lintstock, was engaged to carry out a full evaluation 
of the Board and its Committees. The process consisted of a questionnaire, 
and with one-to-one structured interviews with each Director and 
members of the GMC. The Board discussed the conclusions and 
recommendations of the report.
 
The Lintstock report concluded that the Board continued to fulﬁl its 
responsibilities effectively, although there are certain areas where  
further improvements in Board processes could be made.
In particular, there was an evaluation of Board meeting timing and agendas 
to focus sufﬁcient time on the critical issues, and greater and better 
interaction between the Board and management teams so that all 
understood their respective responsibilities and roles. 
I will be working with my Board colleagues to address these issues over  
the forthcoming months, and the intention is to continue the work with 
Lintstock so that we can track the progress being made by the Board in 
responding to these initiatives. 
Employee engagement
Independent of the Lintstock review, a Group-wide employee engagement 
survey was undertaken by Employee Feedback. A very high response rate 
from three quarters of our worldwide colleagues indicated strong levels of 
satisfaction with Filtrona as an employer and real support for Vision 2015, 
with 85% of respondents optimistic about the future of Filtrona. Detailed 
follow up of comments and recommendations on a site-by-site basis is 
being undertaken, and I am very grateful to all of my colleagues who 
participated in the survey.
I visited a number of Filtrona facilities during the year and intend continuing 
to tour a number of other sites during 2013. I am always impressed by the 
commitment and enthusiasm of my colleagues wherever I travel in the 
world. In particular, visits to Malaysia and Indonesia reminded me of the 
importance of Asia to the Group’s future. The Board visited the Company’s 
facility at Kidlington, UK in October following its approval of a substantial 
investment at the site, and it is anticipated that Board meetings will be held 
at least at two operational sites during 2013 to further enhance the Board’s 
visibility and provide the opportunity for better communication with the 
local teams.

Succession and diversity
The Nomination Committee will continue its work, having proper regard  
to the beneﬁts of diversity, to ensure that the Board composition continues 
to be appropriate for the Company as it makes further progress towards  
its strategic objectives. The Board’s commitment remains to ensure that  
it employs the best people to do the best job for the beneﬁt of the Group 
and its shareholders, in line with its diversity policy.
During the year there were a number of senior management changes as 
the Group seeks to secure a talent base capable of delivering its strategic 
objectives. Matthew Gregory’s promotion to Group Finance Director  
in September 2012 reﬂects the quality available within the experienced 
management team and the beneﬁts of continuity at a time of substantial 
change in our business. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Steve 
Crummett for his support and contribution in driving forward Filtrona at the 
inception of Vision 2015 as Group Finance Director, and to wish him well  
in his future career. 
As previously announced, Lars Emilson tendered his resignation as  
a Non-Executive Director for reasons of ill-health on 5 February 2013.  
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Lars for his wise counsel  
and valued contribution to the development and success of the Company 
during the past six years and wish him a rapid return to full health.
While the Nomination Committee primarily devotes its attention to Board 
succession, the Board has increased its focus on reviewing the quality of 
executive management and the processes for ﬁnding and developing a 
diverse, mobile and international capability. Additional resources have been 
made available to pursue this objective, with the implementation of an 
improved global talent management system to identify and manage the 
talent pipeline. In 2012, I was encouraged by the record intake for the 
Filtrona Graduate Development Programme, which included participants  
from countries such as Indonesia for the ﬁrst time.
Governance agenda
In summary, as the Company continues its strong growth, I think we have 
made excellent progress during the year in response to the increasing 
demands of the governance agenda, both internally and externally. 
However, just as the Group continually looks to new ways to improve its 
ﬁnancial and operational performance, I and the rest of the Board will 
continue to be receptive to ways in which we can continue to develop our 
practices, to ensure our governance performance delivers additional value 
for the beneﬁt of shareholders and reﬂects the highest standards.

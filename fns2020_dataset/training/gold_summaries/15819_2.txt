The Group reports its results in sterling under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and in US dollars under US GAAP. Unless
otherwise stated, the commentary in this Annual Report refers to the IFRS ﬁnancial information for the year.
Commentary on the results compares audited results for the 364-day period from 2 January 2005 to 31 December 2005 (“2005”) with audited
results for the 364-day period from 4 January 2004 to 1 January 2005 (“2004”).
Approximately 69 per cent of the Group’s revenues arise in the USA. Financial information has been translated at an average rate of £1=$1.82

2005 was £1=$1.92).
In this Annual Report, the term “underlying” indicates that the amount has been adjusted for the effects of currency translation, and
acquisitions and disposals; and in the case of proﬁt from operations, the amount is also stated net of restructuring initiatives. Some ﬁgures
and ratios mentioned are not readily available from the ﬁnancial information and details of how these ﬁgures and ratios have been arrived at
are set out in the Operating and Financial Review.

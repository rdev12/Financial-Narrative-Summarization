 2 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
(2002: non operating exceptional income 
of £4.1 million) including a £72.9 million
charge in relation to our exit from the
valves, taps and mixers businesses.
The net interest charge was £8.4 million
(2002: net interest income of £0.6 million)
and proﬁt before taxation was £132.4
million (2002: £237.0 million).
A tax credit for the year of £47.5 million
arose due to an exceptional release 
of £90.7 million from the other tax
provisions following a comprehensive
review of potential tax exposures of the
Group. For 2004 we estimate the effective
tax rate will return to around 30 per cent. 
Basic earnings per share were 18.5
pence (2002: 18.9 pence). 
Dividend 
The Board has recommended a ﬁnal
dividend of 7.4 pence per share, which,
together with the interim dividend of 4.6
pence per share paid on 10 November
2003, brings the total dividends for the
year to 12.0 pence per share. This is the
same as the total dividends paid in respect
of our last twelve-month accounting 
period ending on 30 April 2002.
Our good cash ﬂow enables us to
maintain our dividend and we anticipate
reviewing the level of our dividend
payments this year as and when the 
hoped for improvement in operating
earnings comes through.
The ﬁnal dividend, if approved at the
Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 
1 June 2004 to shareholders on the register
at 30 April 2004. The Board has decided 
to offer the Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
in respect of this ﬁnal dividend.
In 2003, we achieved a creditable ﬁnancial
performance at the same time as we
prepared the Group for what, we hope,
will be better times ahead in some of 
our markets. All our people have shown
tremendous enthusiasm and commitment
towards achieving the strategic initiatives
set out in our last Report and Accounts 
and expanded upon by our Chief
Executive, Jim Nicol, in his review. 
In particular, we have been focusing 
upon the ﬁve elements that will most
impact growth in the economic value 
of the Group, namely the building of an
entrepreneurial culture, the development
of new technologies and products,
achieving manufacturing excellence,
expanding internationally and making
value-creating acquisitions.
Overview of 2003 results 
In 2003, reported sales were £3,150.4
million (2002: £3,245.4 million) and
operating proﬁt (before operating
exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation) was £271.8 million (2002:
£288.8 million). Operating proﬁt from
continuing operations, before goodwill
amortisation in 2003 was £246.0 million
(2002: £237.3 million).
The signiﬁcant weakness of the US
dollar adversely affected our reported
sterling sales and operating proﬁt (before
operating exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation) by £208.9 million and 
£20.2 million respectively.
Operating exceptional items before
taxation were £35.9 million (2002: £46.1
million). Non operating exceptional
charges before taxation were £83.2 million
Corporate governance
We place great importance in ensuring 
that we have the checks and balances to
provide shareholders with comfort about
our long-term future. The structure of your
Board ensures that we have the highest
standards of corporate governance, which
has been acknowledged during the year by
third party commentators such as the NAPF
and Euromoney. The transparency of our
reporting provides shareholders with a
clear understanding of the Group’s results
and prospects. We have a conservative
financial culture that ensures our businesses
operate within a structure of strong
internal ﬁnancial controls. Our strong
balance sheet makes us resilient but also
ﬂexible to take advantage of opportunities
to make value-creating acquisitions. 
The Board
Tony Reading, who was a Director of the
Company from 1992, stood down from 
the Board on 31 December 2003. Tony,
aged 60, was based in the USA and was
responsible for Engineered & Construction
Products, Automotive Fluid Systems, Wiper
Systems and the automotive aftermarket
manufacturing companies. On behalf of
the Board, I would like to thank Tony for
his contribution to the Group and wish 
him well in his future endeavours.
People 
Tomkins people across all our operations
have responded with great enthusiasm and
commitment to the challenges placed upon
them by the level of change taking place
within their businesses. Their hard work has
been crucial in achieving the progress that
we have made this year and I thank them
for their considerable efforts.
Outlook 
The measures that we have taken during
the past three years to reduce costs and
improve efﬁciency will increasingly beneﬁt
the Group during 2004. There are signs 
of recovery in several of our markets,
particularly in the USA where the weaker
dollar is expected to stimulate further the
economy. Whilst this continued weakness
of the US dollar will affect our reported
sterling earnings, we expect a good
improvement in the underlying
performance of the Group during 2004.

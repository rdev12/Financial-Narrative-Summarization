 In May 2005, BTG announced its strategy to focus
on developing and commercialising medical
innovations, reduce operating costs and
monetise non-core assets. Significant advances
have been made in all these areas.
> chairman’s statement
BTG’s results for the year to 31 March
2006 show a major improvement over
the prior year with the net result
being a profit before tax for the year
of £1.5m (04/05: loss of £34.8m).
Cash at the year end was £51.0m
(04/05: £34.5m net of overdraft) of
which some £44m is “free” cash.
Revenues of £50.2m (04/05: £38.3m)
generated net revenues after revenue
sharing 31% higher at £29.5m 
(04/05: £22.6m). Underlying royalty
revenues from marketed products
including BeneFIX
®
and the two-part
hip-cup grew strongly and the Group
generated non-recurring revenues of
£10.7m gross (04/05: £9.1m) including
the settlement with Zimmer over the
two-part hip cup patents. The sale of
investments and patents resulted in
net profits of £11.6m (04/05: £2.2m),
although disappointing progress in
two investee companies has resulted
in write-offs of £4.2m.
Investment in the development 
of Varisolve
®
reduced as expected 
to £4.5m (04/05: £9.2m). Investment
in the rest of BTG’s drug development
pipeline reduced to £3.6m 
(04/05: £6.6m) reflecting the clearer
focus on key products.
The significant restructuring costs
incurred last year set the scene 
for a 23% reduction in operating 
and administrative expenses to
£24.3m (04/05: £31.6m). Further
restructuring costs of £3.7m were
incurred to align operations with 
the new strategy and maintain 
cost control.
The directors do not recommend
payment of a dividend for the year.
Outlook
We have started the new financial
year with a much lower cost base, 
a strong cash position and a clear
focus. We expect that revenues from
royalties on marketed products will
cover operating and administrative
costs. The anticipated revenues from
future licensing deals, milestones and
the ongoing commercialisation of
non-core assets, together with strong
cash reserves, mean the Company is
well placed to continue to build value
by further developing our pipeline.
Discussions are progressing with
potential partners for Varisolve
®
, and
the Board continues to believe this
product is capable of achieving
significant sales and generating
future returns for BTG.
We thank our shareholders, employees
and business partners for their
continued support. The Board is
grateful to Malcolm Coster, who retires
at this year’s AGM after more than 
10 years as a non-executive director .
Sir Brian Fender
Chairman
Underlying
revenue growth,
reduced
operating costs
and a healthy
cash balance
mean we can
move forward
with confidence.

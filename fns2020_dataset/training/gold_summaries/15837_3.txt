CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
MILESTONES
THIS YEAR MARKED THE 10TH
ANNIVERSARY OF OUR LISTING ON THE
LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE. I AM 
DELIGHTED TO REPORT THAT ONCE AGAIN
WE HAVE DELIVERED ANOTHER STRONG
SET OF RESULTS PROVING THE 
SUCCESS OF OUR STRATEGY AND THE 
STRENGTH OF OUR BRAND.
The past decade has been an exciting time in the 
Company’s history. We have transformed the business
from a modest 54 store outfit with 301 staff to a
European operation with over 321 stores and 1,722 
employees in the UK and Holland.
Total Shareholder return since listing has been excellent,
£100 invested in 1997 would have grown to £2,822, 
outperforming the FTSE250 by over 800%. In the past 10
years we have returned over £200 million to shareholders
by way of dividends and share buybacks.
Financial Results
Total Group revenue increased 15.4% to £207.9 million
(2006: £180.2 million) with like-for-like revenue for the
period up 4.7% on last year, which we have achieved
despite the continuing challenging retail market.
Operating profit for the period was £44.3 million (2006:
£38.9 million) giving a profit before tax of £37.8 million

(2006: £39.1 million), impacted by a higher interest charge
as a result of the refinancing for the share buy back.
Basic earnings per share increased to 15.09 pence (2006:
12.80 pence).
Dividend
In line with our progressive dividend policy, the Board is
recommending a final dividend of 6.95 pence per share.
This, once approved by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting, is payable on 31 January 2008 to all
shareholders on the register as at 4 January 2008. This
brings the total dividend to 10.70 pence per share an
increase of 2.9% on 2006.
Board Changes
In March this year we announced the appointment of
Robert Parker as Finance Director, succeeding Andrew
Liggett who left the Company in April. On behalf of the
entire Board, I extend a warm welcome to Rob.

We also announced in September that Nick Ounstead, who
has been Chief Executive Officer for the last five years,
would be taking on a new executive Board role of
Business Development Director with responsibility for
buying, Holland and Group business development. I would
like to thank Nick for his leadership and contribution to
Topps throughout his tenure as Chief Executive.
Matt Williams succeeded Nick as Chief Executive Officer
from 1st November 2007. Matt joined Topps in 1998 in 
the property department. He was promoted to Chief
Operating Officer in 2004 and joined the Board in 2006.
Matt is already demonstrating his ability and drive and I
am confident that with this first class executive team we
have the best management in place to take the business
forward.
People 
Exceptional customer service is the core of our business
and critical to our continued success. It is our people and
not our products that achieve this.
I would like to extend the Board’s thanks and gratitude to
everyone in the Company for their constant efforts in
helping us to realise value for our shareholders.
Outlook
As the business continues to grow in size, revenue and
market share we maintain our investment in the future of
the business and our people. 
The business is in excellent shape and in very capable
hands and I am confident that we will continue to achieve 
sustainable growth and deliver value for our shareholders
in 2008 and beyond.

OUR 
CORE BRANDS
THE GROUP TRADES
UNDER THREE CORE
BRAND NAMES:
TOPPS TILES
Operating from 246 stores nationwide,
Topps Tiles still maintain their No. 1 
position as the UK’s largest supplier of
Ceramic Wall & Floor tiles – Natural Stone
– Laminate & Real Wood for Domestic and
commercial use.
Since 1963 it’s been at the forefront of the Company’s policy to
offer the very best customer service that is honest, helpful and 
knowledgeable but NEVER pushy, this is backed up by offering
value for money with a host of unique consumer benefits like
the Topps free ‘How to’ DVD, a 45 day return & buy back service,
a lifetime guarantee on all BAL adhesives & grouts, and many
more.
With the Company’s continuous drive and focus on customer
service, we are confident that the business will maintain its 
competitive position.
TOPPS 
HOLLAND
Trading since 2002 
Topps Floorstore with its 20 stores across Holland
is the leading specialist of wood flooring in Holland. 
We continue to develop the business and with 
an increasing focus on the ceramic tile offer we
believe the brand will go from strength to strength.
We believe that there is an opportunity for in
excess of 60 stores.
TILE CLEARING
HOUSE
Tile Clearing house has become a
brand of its own operating from 55
stores in the UK, which to date
makes it the second largest tile
Group in the UK behind Topps Tiles. 
This brand is aimed at a slightly different consumer 
sector which in the main are jobbing builders, small 
contractors and bulk purchases, with the addition of end
of line and discontinued products, but offering greater
stock levels of these products. The Tile Clearing house
brand is in prominent positions in towns where Topps
Tiles are sited.

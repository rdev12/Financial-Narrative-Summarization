CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Introduction
I am pleased to present the first Chief Executive’s Review since 
my appointment.
Before presenting a review of operations in the year I think it 
would be useful to make some observations on my initial findings:
@ @UK has a well perceived product which works;
@  that product can deliver substantial savings and hence 
return on investment to purchasing organisations;
@  the sales cycle has been slower than anticipated. This 
is particularly the case in our traditional core market 
– Local Government;
@  there has been a tendency for projects to stall due to 
lack of internal resources available within our client base;
@ the Group’s sales effort needed refocusing; and
@  costs had increased rapidly in anticipation of a level of sales 
growth which had not occurred, and needed to be reduced.
I believe we have made substantial progress in addressing 
these issues which I will move on to explain.
@UK’s eCommerce offering
The Company has developed a unique approach to allow 
transactions via eCommerce between buyers such as Public 
Sector Bodies – Local Authorities, schools and hospitals, and 
corporate enterprises, and sellers such as small to medium 
enterprises (SMEs) as well as larger companies. Our solution 
has significant Local Economic Development benefits as well 
as allowing Local Authorities to purchase via the @UK 
Marketplace in a cost-effective, paperless way. 
What sets @UK apart from other eProcurement suppliers in 
the market is that we have a solution which is used by both 
sides of a transaction. Buyers such as a Public Sector Body or 
a large private enterprise (our “buy-side” customers), interact 
electronically with their suppliers (our “supply-side” customers), 
providing seamless, user friendly eCommerce for all sizes of 
supplier. As the process is electronic from despatch of order 
through to receipt of an electronic invoice this enables process 
cost savings from eProcurement to be achieved.
Our strategy is to target buyers in the public sector, signing them 
up as customers before turning our attention to their suppliers. 
Once set-up work and training has been completed, we then 
work with the buy-side customer to adopt their suppliers onto 
the @UK eCommerce platform. This means that buyers can

use our network to purchase from their suppliers. One of 
the attractive features of the system for the suppliers is that 
they are then also immediately available to be accessed by 
any other buyer on the network at no extra charge.
In order to achieve the cost savings and for @UK to get 
good rates of sign-up with suppliers, the buying organisation 
must commit to the change to paperless procurement. Typically, 
the suppliers who individually have few purchases per year 
but are large in number can be a block to going 100% electronic. 
To help with this we have introduced our “100% Model”, 
which provides the functionality to allow the organisation 
to trade with ease electronically even with those suppliers.
Operational overview
eProcurement 
Since we reported in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts 
it has become clear that the public sector was taking longer 
to initiate and implement eProcurement than @UK had 
anticipated at the time of the IPO in December 2005. This 
was particularly true in the Local Authority market where 
few signed up to an eProcurement solution during 2006. 
In response to this we have:
@  refocused our Local Authority sales effort on better 
quality prospects;
@  allocated resource to progressing projects with existing 
prospects which had stalled;
@  increased sales effort in the NHS sector where cost 
reduction is a priority;
@  initiated test selling of our solution in the private sector; and
@  started to work in partnership with major FMS 
(Financial Management Systems) vendors to broaden 
our sales effort.
We are currently working with 66 Public Sector Organisations 
and one private sector buy-side client.

THE BACKGROUND
LTH is the largest trust of its kind in Europe, 
employing thousands of people across 
several sites. An existing eProcurement 
network linked to their Oracle back-office was 
unsatisfactory. Users required one system to 
requisition for all their needs across all 
different types of suppliers, with minimal set 
up and maintenance for LTH.
THE SOLUTION
Authorised LTH staff enter their own online, 
secure marketplace hosted by @UK. Staff 
view the agreed range and prices from 
authorised suppliers. Once a requisition 
basket has been completed, this is returned 
to the LTH Oracle system for authorisation, 
and then orders are routed out to suppliers. 
Following delivery eInvoices are returned 
from suppliers via the @UK network. The 
order is reconciled via an automatic 3-way 
matching process.
THE BENEFITS
The system is now in use and reductions in 
administration costs are being realised. 
These are anticipated to achieve a return on 
investment within a matter of months once 
the system is fully implemented. The ability 
to negotiate and apply attractive contracts 
across the entire range of needs will offer 
substantial savings for years to come.

Many of these organisations have moved slowly from letter 
of intent through to a fully functioning system. In many 
cases the delay is due to the customer not having sufficient 
resources available. To address this, in March 2007 we 
launched our Rapid Deployment service, which aims to get 
the purchasing organisation fully operational within as little 
as five days. To date six of our customers have signed up for 
this service and two have already gone live as a result.
Local Authorities – We now have a total of 59 Authorities 
who have adopted the @UK eProcurement solution as their 
chosen approach. We are pleased to announce that since 
the year end the London Borough of Hillingdon and 
Somerset County Council have become customers.
Central Government – As part of our focus on deploying our 
resources where we can maximise revenues, we withdrew from 
the Zanzibar consortium in September 2006. The demand for 
value added services from suppliers proved to be very low and 
the Board took the decision to redeploy resource where it will 
be more effective. This enabled us to sell direct into Central 
Government, which we commenced in November 2006 having 
recruited an experienced salesman to focus on this area.
National Health Service – 2006 saw @UK move successfully 
into the NHS, winning the mandate for the Leeds Teaching 
Hospitals Trust, while continuing to work at University Hospital 
Birmingham. With Leeds as a major reference site we have 
made sales in the NHS a key priority in 2007.
Education – We are currently working with four Local 
Education Authorities, three of which now have live sites. 
This is a net reduction of eight since we last reported. 
The project with the nine Greater Manchester Boroughs 
for an electronically based schools purchasing information 
service was cancelled at an early stage, by mutual agreement, 
after they received funding from the Department for Education 
and Skills to take part in a national pilot for another solution.
Other Public Sector – In 2006 we were pleased to have gained 
our first customer in the Emergency Services – Thames 
Valley Police.
Suppliers – We have attracted an impressive range of large 
suppliers to our marketplace. During 2006 we changed our 
approach to signing up suppliers from using on site supplier 
adoption officers to the use of supplier advisers working 
from a call centre environment at our offices in Aldermaston. 
These advisers follow up mailings sent out by buying 
organisations to their suppliers. The volume of sign-ups 
is critically dependent on the buy-side providing those 
mailings, and on the letters containing a call to action from 
the buying organisation as they change the way they procure. 
This inter-dependency between the buy-side and supply-side 
makes the push to get buy-side projects moving, referred 
to above, doubly important.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Company Formations – Our company formation services 
business grew by 13% in the year. In 2006 approximately 10% 
of companies formed in Great Britain were completed using 
our system, either directly by @UK or by other agents 
paying a royalty for use of our service (2005: 8%). During 
the year we tested the marketing of our eCommerce 
services and third party accounting software for business 
start-ups directly to all newly incorporated companies. 
However, the take-up was not sufficient to warrant continuing 
with this relatively expensive, directly marketing approach. 
We have, therefore, reverted to making additional services 
available on the company formations area of our website. 
These are provided by third parties, on which we make a 
margin or commission.
Marketing – During 2006 marketing spend (including pay per 
click advertising) increased to £0.7m from £0.4m in the previous 
year. The increase was attributable to increased attendance at 
industry exhibitions and advertising via trade press. We consider 
that the aim of increasing awareness of @UK in the market 
has now been achieved, so spend is being reduced this year. 
Marketing activity will now be more focused on events such 
as the seminar we organised for Local Authorities.
Acquisition of Coding International Limited
The acquisition of Coding International Limited (“CIL ”) at the end 
of April 2006 was an important enhancement to our business as 
we believe proper coding of products is essential to gain the full 
benefits from eProcurement. CIL is seen as expert in this area.
The North West London Health Trusts contract was announced 
in July, and is progressing well. The trusts will soon be able to 
show savings based on the solution and it is already being 
showcased to other NHS bodies. The first sale of coding 
services into one of our Local Authority clients has just taken 
place, and we are confident that many more will follow.
Financial results
Turnover for the year was £2.16m an increase of 49% over the 
previous year (2005: £1.45m). Web and eCommerce sales rose 
by 152% to £0.94m, assisted by a maiden contribution of 
£0.15m from CIL. Gross margin fell from 67% to 59% reflecting 
the costs of staff carrying out implementation work for 
supply-side customers increasing ahead of sales.
Operating expenses before exceptional items increased from 
£1.88m to £4.84m. The rise reflects the increase in the cost base 
in preparation for the roll-out of our products and services across 
the UK public sector.
£0.05m was charged as the cost calculated under FRS 20 
of share options granted to employees (2005: £Nil). Following 
the strategic review carried out in November staff numbers 
were reduced and have fallen from a peak of 115 to 85, 
including eleven at CIL. An exceptional cost of £0.2m was 
incurred in making this reduction.
After taking account of exceptional items, the loss before tax 
for the year was £3.51m compared to £1.68m in the previous year .

THE BACKGROUND
Lewisham is the first London Borough aiming 
for true eProcurement between itself and its 
key suppliers, where suppliers can send 
back electronic invoices against electronic 
orders to facilitate automatic 3-way matching. 
From its £210m procurement spend Lewisham 
expect significant savings can be achieved. 
The majority of this administrative benefit 
will be achieved quickly by e-enabling identified 
third party suppliers, responsible for around 
100,000 of manual invoices processed.
THE SOLUTION
Staff log on to their existing (Oracle) financial 
system, which links to the @UK PLC 
eMarketplace. This accesses suppliers 
and special prices approved by the central 
purchasing department to ensure best value. 
Lewisham is working with @UK informing 
suppliers of their eProcurement programme 
and its benefits, including accurate orders, 
fewer returns costs, elimination of manual 
order processing and facilitating on-time 
payment. At the same time suppliers gain 
the ability to trade 24/7 with consumers 
and other businesses.
THE BENEFITS
Of the 4,700 suppliers contacted, over 
1,900 are registered with @UK PLC so far. 
486 suppliers are already developing their 
websites or linking existing websites to 
trade with Lewisham. Over 100 suppliers 
are already receiving orders.

As anticipated, cash outflow before financing increased 
substantially in 2006 to £4.51m (2005: £1.58m). The larger 
part of the outflow went on operating costs, but capital 
expenditure increased significantly to £792,000 from £121,000 
in 2005, with the expenditure on the new data centre in London 
and office refurbishment as well as equipment for the 
additional staff. Following the reduction in operating expenses 
as a result of the strategic review in November, our cash burn 
has been reduced to a rate of £0.2m per month.
At 31 December 2006 the Group had net funds of £4.04m 
available, which we are confident is sufficient to take us 
through to profitability. 
Dividend policy
The Board is not recommending the payment of a dividend 
for 2006. In the immediate future, the Board is committed to 
building the Group’s business and accordingly all the Group’s 
financial resources are being applied to this end. In the longer 
term, the Directors intend to adopt a progressive dividend policy 
appropriate to the Group’s financial performance.
Transition to International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS)
As an AIM listed company @UK will adopt IFRS for our 
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2007 
and the interim results to 30 June 2007 will be prepared 
under the new standards. 
The Audit Committee has been regularly briefed on the 
development of IFRS and the associated International 
Accounting Standards (IAS) so that it can understand 
their impact and oversee the transition to IFRS.
As well as the different presentation formats, the most 
notable changes for our results are likely to be related to:
@  acquisitions and goodwill – Under IAS 38 (‘Intangible 
Assets’) there will be no amortisation of goodwill. 
Instead it will be carried as a permanent item and be 
subject to an annual impairment review of the carrying 
value. Future acquisitions will involve the identification 
and evaluation of separate intangible assets;
@  research and development expenditure – IAS 38 requires 
expenditure meeting certain recognition criteria to be 
capitalised, amortised over its useful economic life and 
subject to impairment review; and

@  increased disclosure generally, but in particular in 
relation to IAS 14 ‘Segmental Reporting’ and IAS 24 
‘Related Party Transactions’.
Overall the change to IAS is not expected to have a material 
impact on the results. 
Outlook
The beginning of this year has been satisfactory as a result 
of the benefits of the action plan put in place following the 
strategic review. Our financial performance has stabilised 
as a result of the reduction in our cash burn and we aim 
to sustain this improvement. At the year end we had £4.0m 
of cash available to take the Group through to profitability.
There are still significant opportunities to substantially grow 
our business and I am looking forward to the challenges of 
the next year as we take advantage of these.

The 100% Model
The 100% Model has been designed to help significantly reduce costs associated with 
‘manual’ processing of purchase orders and invoices over the whole supplier base in a 
Buying Organisation. The aim is to recruit all of a Buying Organisation’s suppliers, including 
those suppliers who do very low volumes of trade with that Buying Organisation. 
The analysis of data from several Buying Organisations that are currently using the @UK 
eProcurement System would suggest that the typical 20/80 rule applies. This means that the 
top 20% of suppliers generate 80% of the value and 80% of the transactions. It is the 70%-80% 
of suppliers who do low volumes of trade with the Buying Organisation that @UK aims to 
get on Board with eProcurement.
The 100% Model aims to increase the ROI by engaging with all suppliers electronically, 
where the savings would be significantly higher than engaging only the top 20% of suppliers.

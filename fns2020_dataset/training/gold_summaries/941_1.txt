  ANGLE plc  Annu Al Repo Rt And Accounts 2007
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
During the year, ANGLE has significantly 
increased its level of investment in order 
to expand and develop the controlled 
investments portfolio. Due to these 
investments being made in companies 
in which we have a majority stake, 
accounting standards determine that 
the expenditure on these investments is 
charged to the income statement with no 
value recognised on the Balance Sheet. A 
profit is reported and the fair value of the 
investments is recognised on the Balance 
Sheet when the holdings are reduced and 
the companies are no longer controlled. 
Largely as a result of the above, the loss 
before tax for the year was £9.3 million. 
Some £6.1 million of this loss represents 
expenditure of £3.1 million direct 
investment in the controlled investment 
portfolio companies and £3.0 million 
operating costs to establish, develop and 
create value in Progeny
®
 companies. The 
remaining £3.2 million reflects a decrease 
in fair value of quoted investments, share 
based payments, a loss on the consulting 
and management business and 
restructuring costs. Since the year end, 
the value of ANGLE’s holding in Provexis 
has recovered by some £1.2 million. 
Progress across the business was 
generally slower than expected and plans 
to complete external funding into two of 
the controlled investments were delayed. 
Profits relating to fair value gains which 
may arise from these events are now 
expected to occur in the new financial 
year. One of the year’s delayed events, 
the securing of external funding for 
Geomerics, has since been concluded 
and has delivered an initial fair value gain 
of £4.0 million. Following this external 
investment, we retain a 48% holding in 
Geomerics. 
Management services business
Performance in the Consulting division 
was disappointing during the year. As a 
result, the decision was taken to focus 
on the profitable Management services 
business, which has long term contracts 
already in place, rather than short term 
consulting work. Since the year end, 
necessary restructuring has been 
completed and the Management services 
business is now performing profitably and 
showing good signs for future growth.
Portfolio summary 
Controlled investments are Progeny
®
 
companies where the Group has control, 
typically through owning more than 50% 
of the equity. 
During the year ANGLE exited two 
investments and discontinued a third.  
The movement in number of Progeny
®
 
companies is set out on page 5.
ANGLE’s portfolio currently comprises 
eight Progeny
®
 companies. With the 
exception of NeuroTargets and Provexis,  
at the year end these companies were all 
controlled investments being majority 
owned by ANGLE. After evaluation costs 
of £0.2 million, investment in InnoMatica  
was ceased as it failed to meet our

 investment criteria.  
The majority of ANGLE’s residual holding 
in AIM-listed Corpora plc, acquired as a 
result of the trade sale of our portfolio 
company Exago to Corpora in 2004, was 
also sold in the second half for £0.3 million. 
At the year end, ANGLE had directly 
invested £5.2 million in its controlled 
investments and incurred operating costs 
to establish, develop and create value 
in these Progeny
®
 companies during 
the timeframe of their development 
of a further £7.3 million. None of this 
investment is shown on ANGLE’s Balance 
Sheet. The Board believes that this 
represents significant unrealised value in 
the business as is demonstrated by the 
fair value of £4.0 million attributed to just 
one of the six companies, following third 
party investment into Geomerics. 
Acolyte Biomedica exit
During the second half, ANGLE’s 
Progeny
®
 company Acolyte Biomedica 
was sold to 3M Corporation. ANGLE’s 
share of the proceeds was up to  
£5.6 million comprising an initial £0.9 
million in cash and an earn-out of up to 
£4.7 million receivable early in 2010. The 
initial payment delivered a 1.3X cash 
multiple on ANGLE’s investment, which 
will increase to an 8X cash multiple should 
the maximum earn-out be achieved. Only 
£1.9 million of this potential £4.7 million is 
entered on ANGLE’s Balance Sheet. 
ANGLE founded and developed 
Acolyte using its Progeny
®
 process. Key 
development work took place prior to 
ANGLE’s own listing and ANGLE did not 
have the ability to invest in the Company 
during its development. As a result, our 
equity holding in Acolyte at exit was 
11.6%, which is far less than the expected 
position with our key portfolio companies 
established since 2004 where we 
currently hold more than 4X as much 
equity in each company. 
Portfolio company status
The status of the portfolio companies, all of 
which have been founded and developed 
by ANGLE, is summarised below:
Aberro (65% holding) provides 
automated software testing products 
that enable customers to increase the 
overall reliability of their software while 
reducing both time to market and 
development costs. The Company 
expects to make its first significant sales 
in the second half positioning the 
Company to secure third party funding. 
See www.aberrosoftware.com for 
product details.
Aguru Images (formerly Kaloptics) 
(100% holding) is commercialising 
technology from New York University 
and the University of Southern 
California that enables the rapid 
capture and recreation of photo-
realistic surface images. The 
technology has a wide range of 
commercial applications in high value 
industries, including special effects, 
animation, computer gaming and 
medical devices.

Geomerics (56% holding) has 
developed its radiosity product during 
the year. This provides rapid 
computation of light reflection and 
refraction in computer animation. The 
result is greater realism and 
dramatically improved visual quality of 
computer games. A demonstration can 
be seen on www.geomerics.com. The 
radiosity product was launched at the 
Game Developers Conference in San 
Francisco in March and the Company 
is now in discussions with a range of 
potential customers, who are focused 
on the Sony, Microsoft and other major 
games platforms. The holding in 
Geomerics has subsequently reduced 
to 48% as a result of third party 
investment.
NeuroTargets (25% holding) is 
developing therapeutics for pain and 
nerve injury in the areas of neuropathic 
and inflammatory pain. The Company 
is operating on a low cost basis whilst 
options for its development are 
evaluated. 
Novocellus (63% holding) has 
developed a diagnostic technology 
that enables the selection of the most 
‡
‡
‡
viable pre-implantation human 
embryos for use in IVF treatment. 
This has the potential to improve the 
success of IVF rates by at least a third 
and facilitate the move to routine single 
embryo transfer, which is an objective 
of regulatory authorities and subject to 
considerable press comment at 
present. Novocellus is in discussions 
with a number of potential partners for 
completion of its clinical trials and 
launch of its product in the market.
Parsortix (68% holding) is developing 
its prenatal diagnostic device based 
on the isolation of foetal cells within 
maternal blood eliminating the need 
for invasive procedures such as 
amniocentesis. Large scale validation 
of the product is expected by the 
end of the calendar year and thereafter 
it is believed that FDA approval can be 
secured so as to enable product launch 
by mid 2008. 
Provexis (AIM:PXS) (20% holding) 
develops scientifically-proven 
functional and medical foods. During 
the year Provexis completed a 
£2.1 million fundraising, in which 
ANGLE invested £0.3 million, and 
‡
‡
announced a long term collaboration 
agreement with Unilever plc to develop 
a new format of its patented Fruitflow
®
 
heart-health technology. Following the 
Company’s recent announcement of 
its move to licensing Fruitflow
®
 and 
discussions with two major global 
beverage brand owners, its share 
price has risen strongly.  
See www.provexis.com for more 
information. 
Synature (55% holding) launched its 
internet personalisation products 
during the year. The first commercial 
sale of product was made to a leading 
player in the package holidays market, 
who is using the product to make 
holiday recommendations to customers 
using their website. The product is 
being expanded into the fast growing 
social networking market, which offers 
substantial growth at low investment. 
See www.synature.com for more 
information.

on issued share capital as at 30 April 2007 .

The portfolio companies have strong 
proprietary positions offering the 
potential for highly profitable products 
addressing major markets. ANGLE is 
working closely with the respective 
management teams that have been put 
in place in each Progeny
®
 company to 
manage the investments and minimise 
any failures. ANGLE’s investment in the 
portfolio is being directed to maximise 
returns from individual companies and 
third party investors are being brought 
into portfolio companies as appropriate 
to manage risk and maximise ANGLE 
shareholder value.
ANGLE’s overhead in managing its 
investments has been streamlined 
ensuring that senior management are 
directly responsible for all portfolio 
companies. Costs have been reduced 
and performance strengthened.
Outlook 
The Management services business has 
established contracts in place, which are 
expected to deliver significant 
profitability for the year.
We expect strong developments in the 
Progeny
®
 company portfolio during the 
year as the existing Progeny
®
 companies 
mature and we are delighted to have 
announced the third party funding into 
Geomerics. 
Overall, we expect to move ANGLE into 
profitability during the year even after 
continued investment into the portfolio. 
Although Hance Fullerton will remain as 
Chairman until the Annual General 
Meeting, I would like to take this 
opportunity to join the rest of the ANGLE 
Board in thanking Hance for all his hard 
work and dedication to ANGLE over the 
years. Under his stewardship, the Group 
has developed from a start-up business 
to an established leader in IP 
commercialisation. Hance has chaired 
ANGLE through its flotation on AIM of 
the London Stock Exchange and his 
efforts have been instrumental in providing 
ANGLE the strong management platform 
needed to deliver Progeny
® 
companies 
that address areas of major market need. 
We wish Hance all the best as he plans  
for a long and enjoyable retirement and 
sincerely thank him for his outstanding 
contribution to ANGLE.

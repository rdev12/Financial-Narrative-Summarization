Premier Inn is the UK’s leading, and award–winning, hotel

the Middle East and two in India.
We offer our customers a 100% money–back guarantee of

Guarantee.
All Premier Inn UK bedrooms have an ensuite bathroom, TV  
with Freeview and Wi–Fi internet access. All our hotels have  
a bar and restaurant, either inside the building, or next to  
it offering a wide range of dishes. 372 of these restaurants  
are our own brands: Beefeater; Brewers Fayre; Table Table; 
and Taybarns. We also have Thyme restaurants within a

Whitbread Annual Report and Accounts 2012/13 2 Costa
Costa, voted the UK’s favourite coffee shop, has grown 
significantly over the past five years and now has 1,578  
stores in the UK and 949 overseas. 
Only the very best coffee available goes into creating the 
unique taste and aroma of our Costa Mocha Italia blend —  
in fact, just 1% of the world’s production is good enough  
for us to choose from. All the coffee we serve in the UK,  
and most of that served in the rest of the world, is roasted  
at our Lambeth roastery.
Costa is an international brand represented in 29 countries.  
It employs a multi–channel strategy, with equity stores, 
franchise stores and joint ventures as well as a wholesale 
operation and Costa Express, which now has 2,560 machines. 
A recently added channel is ‘Costa at home’, with Costa  
coffee being sold for use in domestic coffee machines for  
the first time.

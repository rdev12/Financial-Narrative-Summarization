In 2010 the Company 
produced lower but 
creditable profits in an 
extremely harsh business 
environment for the 
structural steel sector in 
the UK. The Company 
continues to extend its 
leading position in the 
market, reflected by its 
financial performance and 
market share gains.
OvervieW
In 2010 the Company produced lower but 
creditable profits in an extremely harsh 
business environment for the structural steel 
sector in the UK. The Company continues 
to extend its leading position in the market, 
reflected by its financial performance and 
market share gains.
The Company anticipates that trading 
conditions will only improve marginally 
towards the end of 2011, before a richer 
vein of project opportunities materialises in 
2012.
r esul ts
The Group made an underlying operating 
profit of £16.2 million (2009: £51.8 million) 
on revenue of £266.7 million (2009: 
£349.4 million). Group profit after tax is 
£7.6 million (2009: £31.3 million), with 
basic earnings per share of 8.58p (2009: 
35.34p), both reflecting the impact of 
non-underlying items.
Divi Den D
The Company, while optimistic for 2012 
and beyond, feels that trading in the UK 
market in 2011 will remain very tough. In 
remaining prudent against this outlook, it 
will recommend a final dividend payment  
of 2.50p, giving 7.50p for the full year 
(2009: 15.00p).
BOarD cHan Ges
The Board is pleased to announce that 
Derek Randall, currently Executive 
Director with responsibility for Business 
Development and International, including 
JSW Severfield Structures Ltd in India, 
joined the Company’s main Board in 
February 2011.
The Company is also pleased to welcome 
John Dodds to its Plc Board as a non-
executive director in October 2010. John 
retired from Kier Group last year, after 
working for the company for 40 years. 
John became CEO of Kier Group in 2003 
and, with his wealth of experience in the 
construction industry, will be a valuable 
asset to our Board.
peOple
Our employees continue to be our 
key competitive advantage, with their 
experience and commitment contributing to 
our relative success and development.
Outl OOk
2011 will be a tough trading year. The 
macro-economic situation in the UK has 
been and remains difficult to interpret and 
predict. Clearer consensus is emerging that 
recovery will be apparent in GDP growth in 
2012. Privately led investment in a few key 
sectors will provide improved prospects for 
us in 2012. The Company expects that the 
remainder of 2011 will be notable for the 
absence of large, major project starts with 
an improvement being seen in our pipeline 
for 2012.
In our overseas target markets, we are 
demonstrating that our experience, 
methods and capability can be transferred 
successfully as we attempt to offset the 
impact of tough trading conditions in the 
UK. Progress in India is extremely good 
where exciting prospects are in the pipeline 
and growth potential is strong. 15 OUR BUSINESS 15

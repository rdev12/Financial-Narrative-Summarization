 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
FIRST ARTIST ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
02
It gives me great pleasure to introduce our results 
and operating review for 2005, a year which has had a
transforming effect on First Artist Corporation’s business.
The past 12 months have seen us reap the benefits of a
successful repositioning of the Group to function as a truly
integrated service for all aspects of sports and celebrity
representation and event management. The figures for all
four of our divisions reflect the mutual benefits that they
are gaining from this strategy.

In summary, I recommend our results to you as
evidence that our year of significant change and
growth has created a company with a broader
income base, strongly positioned for expansion, and
with a uniquely integrated, exciting offer in the
marketplace.We expect all four divisions to continue
their success in 2006, whilst we look to expand our
successful model to new markets overseas.
I would like to thank all those involved in the
restructuring of this Group and thank the Board for
its commitment in turning around a group in what
remains a difficult environment.
Jarvis Astaire, OBE
Chairman
27 January 2006 
I wish to thank my predecessor as Chairman,
Tim Chadwick, whom I look forward to working
with in his new capacity as Vice-Chairman, for his
excellent work on the ABG Financial Management
Limited (“ABGFM”) and The Finishing T ouch
(Corporate Events) Limited acquisitions.
Both these acquisitions, together with the similarly
acquired T eam Sports Management have now been
successfully integrated into the Group and, with their
highly respected management teams continuing on
board, are already delivering significant revenue.
BROADER INCOME: FULLER SERVICE
Our broad-based business, organised across four
divisions, gives us a strong position for growth
through international expansion, and the cross 
referral of income and new business opportunities.
Whilst building on the reputation that First Artist
Management enjoys as one of the world’s leading
football management groups, we have successfully
reduced the dependence of the Group on this one
sport by two-thirds whilst broadening both our
income base and the range of services that we 
offer to clients.
There are considerable opportunities for cross referral
of business and substantial new business opportunities
within our new structure.The wealth management
division created through the ABGFM acquisition
allows us to form deeper and more valuable
relationships with the players and media figures
served through First Artist Management and 
First Artist Entertainment; the event management
business of Finishing T ouch gives us exposure to
Public Sector contracts and the opportunity to
leverage our position as a FIFA and UEFA licensee,
as well as a further outlet for our growing roster of
entertainment clients.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
We believe in good corporate governance, and a 
clear division of roles and responsibilities on the
Group Board. Due to the Group now having two
Non-Executive directors, our finance director,
Richard Hughes, is now free to step down from 
our committees.Tim Chadwick will continue as 
Non-Executive Vice-Chairman of the First Artist
Corporation, focusing on relations with the financial
and investor community.
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A BUSINESS
Integrity and credibility are vital commodities in our
business.We pride ourselves on the transparency of
our relationships with players, clubs and media
personalities, and First Artist Management has been 
a prime mover in the creation of the Football Agents
Federation, which establishes guidelines for the
conduct of agents. We make efforts in this area
because of our commitment to sport.

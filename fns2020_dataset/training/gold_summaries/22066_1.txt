 4   Annual report 2012 Caledonia Investments plc  
Chief Executive’s report
“ Markets remain only fairly valued and 
are likely to show volatile movement 
for some time to come. We will 
continue to invest Caledonia’s balance 
sheet with great care and allocate our 
most precious commodity, our capital, 
only to well run and attractively 
priced companies.”
Will Wyatt Chief Executive
year underperformance is due to Caledonia’s dividend 
pay-out being below that of the market. We are addressing 
this strategically through our increased emphasis on 
income from the portfolio, which should be relected in 
increased dividends to shareholders.
Discount
The discount at which our shares trade compared with 
our underlying NAV has widened, ending the year at 25%. 
This is approaching the level at which many private equity 
investment trusts trade and is considerably wider than 
the average of the Global Growth sector in which we are 
categorised. We purchased £12.6m of shares during the 
year and we continue to believe that investing in the 
existing portfolio through share buy-backs at such a  
wide discount is both accretive and good value for all 
shareholders. We will once again ask for the necessary 
permissions to buy in shares at the AGM, though our 
ability to conduct such a strategy for a sustained period is 
constrained by the holding of the Cayzer Concert Party. 
However, the real driver of the discount is the underlying 
performance of the portfolio which, in recent years, has 
been weak. The strategic initiatives to address this were 
outlined a year ago and are well underway. We are 
particularly pleased with the strong performance of  
some of the newer investments, which outperformed the 
benchmark by 5%. I am conident that this trend will 
continue and that shareholders will beneit from an 
overall improvement in performance.
Strategy
I laid out our strategy in my report a year ago. The core 
message was that Caledonia’s excellent model of long term 
supportive capital was as relevant and it for purpose as 
ever, but was in need of certain adjustments.
Our strategy review identiied four key areas where we 
would focus our attention:
 The yield derived from the portfolio was too low. We have 
addressed this both by creating an internally managed 
Income & Growth pool and through a more stringent 
yield requirement. I am pleased to report good progress 
with underlying income rising as the portfolio is 
realigned. We envisage further progress over the next 
two years without detracting from Caledonia’s core 
approach, which seeks to invest in growth, rather than 
dedicated income, companies. This supports our stated 
intention to pay a higher dividend to shareholders, as 
outlined by the Chairman.
 We had too many subscale investments. Since the strategy 
was adopted, we have sold, or are in the process of 
selling, eight subscale investments and have identiied a 
further seven for disposal. In addition, management of 
three subscale businesses has been transferred to a 
private equity irm. This will leave us with a core 
portfolio of 40-50 investments, which is optimal for our 
current management resource and will allow us to keep 
our ongoing charges ratio to around 1%. We have 
implemented a minimum size threshold for new 
Results
The economic backdrop of recession in Europe – in 
particular, artiicially low interest rates combined with 
the unprecedented iscal problems of many EU countries – 
has caused investors rightly to be nervous. This was 
demonstrated by a light to the relative safety of cash and 
bonds in the autumn of last year, which has left several of 
our investments trading at signiicantly lower valuations 
as investors have been cautious in respect of equities. 
More positively, this has allowed us to deploy capital into 
our new Income & Growth pool at reasonable prices.
Caledonia’s long term investment approach of taking large 
stakes in companies has often resulted in uneven 
performance, especially when compared with an index 
whose composition is less concentrated than our portfolio. 
Short term swings in valuation within the portfolio are to 
be expected and are acceptable, provided there is not an 
underlying diminution in intrinsic valuation of the 
respective investment. However, a decrease in the net 
asset value per share total return (‘NAV TR’) of 7.0% over 
the past year has had a large proportional effect on our 
ive year NAV TR, which has underperformed our 
benchmark, the FTSE All-Share TR, by 14.1% over the 
same period. We have continued, however, to outperform 
this index over the past ten years. The majority of the ive  Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2012    5

expect that value will accrue to investors in due course.

Pool commentary
Quoted pool. Our solid, bottom-up analysis, married to  
a value oriented style, is tailored to the identiication of 
long term equity growth stories. Four new investments  
in Spirax-Sarco, The Weir Group, Hill & Smith and Greggs 
were made during the year.
Unquoted pool. The portfolio holdings have shown a 
healthy 16% growth in underlying proits overall in the 
year, though valuation metrics have reduced. We have 
witnessed excellent deal low with over 200 opportunities 
assessed and have made one new investment – in Bowers & 
Wilkins, an audio equipment manufacturer. We have been 
granted exclusivity in a further deal and have a healthy 
pipeline of opportunities.
Asia pool. In the quoted arena, we made investments in 
Jardine Matheson and one of its associated companies.  
In India, our shareholding in First Blue Home Finance  
will be merged with another of our holdings, Dewan 
Housing Finance, during the next year. We made a new 
commitment to an Asian fund of private equity funds.
Property pool. We sold several Edinmore Investments 
property companies and assets during the year, whilst 
Brookshire, the specialist industrial property team,  
made several new acquisitions. We added to our holding  
in London & Stamford.
Funds pool. We will select managers with top quartile 
performance records for both private equity and  
quoted funds to give us targeted geographical and  
sector exposure with a controlled risk/reward proile.  
We have made further commitments to private equity 
funds in the UK and US.
Income & Growth pool. This pool has produced an 
impressive irst year outperformance, laying solid 
foundations for future yield and capital appreciation  
as well as enhancing our global exposure.
investments of £10m overall, though listed stakes 
may be built up over time, and £20m for unquoted 
companies. This does not apply to purchases by the 
Income & Growth pool, for which the portfolio criteria 
are by their nature different.
 A change in the way we manage our portfolio.  
The portfolio has been reorganised into six distinct 
pools of capital managed by investment executives  
with relevant experience and skill. There is necessarily 
an element of matrix management as several of the 
pools contain both unquoted and quoted investments. 
There is clearer accountability and responsibility as  
a result of these changes.
 ur investment and divestment process required re ining.
 –  Our new management structure has strengthened  
our decision making process.
 –  The pool structure has added focus and responsibility.
 –  The investment size limits have helped reine our 
research and investment towards fewer but more 
suitable opportunities.
 –  Our deal low has been enhanced through increased 
marketing and specialist resource.
The yield requirement has seen a subtle shift in our ideal 
target portfolio company, resulting in less early stage 
investments and a move towards a more mature proile 
than in the recent past. Our investment criteria are now 
focused on a strong market position, strong margins and 
cash lows, and high barriers to entry, combined with an 
established and proven management team. Companies that 
possess such qualities are an excellent it with our style of 
investing and will result in less risk with equally attractive 
return characteristics, if bought at reasonable valuations.
We have moved away from an absolute requirement for a 
board seat, particularly through the Quoted pool. This will 
result in an increased level of liquidity as well as holdings 
in companies with larger market capitalisations.
The board has signalled its conidence in this strategy  
by substantially increasing the inal dividend and its 
intention is to continue Caledonia’s progressive dividend 
policy, but from a higher level, in the future.
Investment activity
During the year, we invested £248m and realised £130m 
of assets. The Income & Growth pool was the principal 
recipient of funds during the course of the year, investing 
£111m at opportune moments in what was a volatile year 
for markets. Our strategic aim is to increase the size of 
this pool to 15-20% of the portfolio, representing up to a 
little over £200m, over the next two years. Excluding the 
Income & Growth pool, we made eight new and eleven 
follow-on investments and fully or partially sold twelve 
holdings during the year. Over the year, the returns from 
all but the Income & Growth pool were disappointing 
though, in a volatile market, a concentrated portfolio such 
as ours will inevitably experience a greater degree of  6   Annual report 2012 Caledonia Investments plc  
complement our investment in Capital Today China and 
have made initial investments in Jardine Matheson and 
Hongkong Land. We have also deliberately increased 
exposure to North America during the year.
We have followed closely the disturbing announcements 
by the Indian government regarding potential 
retrospective taxation charges. This rhetoric is making 
India a less attractive country in which to invest and 
foreign investment lows have slowed considerably.  
We will continue to monitor events closely, though we 
view India as a strong long term structural growth story, 
albeit with many of the normal attributes of an emerging 
economy, both good and bad.

Outlook
The corporate sector continues to produce strong results 
and to nurture healthy balance sheets. This is in direct 
contrast to many Western economies, which are over 
indebted, underperforming and being kept alive with 
artiicially created money. Markets remain only fairly 
valued and are likely to show volatile movement for some 
time to come. We will continue to invest Caledonia’s 
balance sheet with great care and allocate our most 
precious commodity, our capital, only to well run and 
attractively priced companies.
I would like to end by expressing, on behalf of the board, 
our sincerest thanks to James Loudon for his hugely 
signiicant contribution to the company over a long period 
of time and, particularly, for stepping up to Chairman on 
the untimely death of Peter Buckley three and a half years 
ago. We wish him a long and fulilling retirement.

Asset class
We retain an approximate 60:40 split between listed and 
unlisted companies, which is a slightly higher exposure to 
listed companies than last year, but not dissimilar to our 
long term average.

 o ive investments
Our largest ive investments are shown in the table  
below. Caledonia has always taken substantial stakes  
in companies, often built up over a period of time. 
Retaining our successful investment for the longer term 
has been a key plank of our investment style, so usually 
there is relatively little change in the composition of the 
top ive or ten holdings from year to year. We did however 
sell down some of our holding in British Empire Securities 
during the year and transferred the funds to the Income  
& Growth pool. Cobehold is a privately held Belgian 
investment vehicle with net assets of approximately 
€1.2bn in which Caledonia owns a 10% holding. It has 
invested in a high quality portfolio of about 15 growth 
orientated companies, mostly in continental Europe.  
It has grown to be our second largest investment and we 
continue to see substantial underlying growth from its 
portfolio, which bodes well for the future.

In previous years, we have set out our desire to increase

exposure to the rest of South East Asia. We have therefore

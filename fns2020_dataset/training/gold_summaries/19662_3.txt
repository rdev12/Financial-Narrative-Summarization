Overview
I am delighted to report on a year of significant progress  
at Speedy.
Shortly after he was appointed CEO, Mark Rogerson set out a 
clear three-point ‘FIT’ plan to return the Group to health and 
build sustainable profit growth. Despite some very challenging 
historical issues, Mark and his leadership team have made 
significant progress.
It is particularly pleasing that despite the many challenges  
the Company has had to face, particularly with regard to 
the Middle East, we have reported a 50% increase in PBT
1
. 
Underpinned by a further good performance in the UK & 
Ireland, Group revenues
1
 increased by 7.2% to £375 million 
(2014: £349.7 million) and Group EBITA
2
 increased by 19.5% 
to £26.4 million (2014: £22.1 million). Earnings per share
1
 
increased by 57.6% to 3.23 pence (2014: 2.05 pence). As at  
31 March 2015, net debt was £105.3 million giving a net debt  
to EBITDA
1
 ratio of 1.45x (2014: 1.23x).
PBT
1
 increased by 50%, but was significantly affected by the 
losses in our International Division. We are therefore pleased  
to have exited fully from the general and spot hire market in the 
Middle East ahead of our 2016 deadline and are in discussions 
regarding the disposal of our oil and gas services operations 
which have returned to a break even position in March 2015. 
This is a very significant achievement. After de-risking the 
Middle East, completing the upgrade to the backbone of our 
network and having embedded our new IT and MI system, we 
are now in a position to concentrate our resources on the UK 
where we enjoy a market leading position and where there is 
considerable scope for sustainable profit growth. We will now 
increase our efforts to deliver further improvements in asset 
utilisation and cost management as well as professionalising 
the sales and marketing activities; all of which will contribute 
to an improvement in profits and ROCE.
On 18 September 2014 we announced the re-financing of the 
Group and secured a new £180 million five-year asset-based 
revolving facility at an improved margin and with agreements 
in place to support additional funding, if required. Alongside 
our focus on cash generation, the new facility will provide  
us with the flexibility to support our strategy for sustainable  
profit growth.   Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 05
Strategic report
“It is particularly pleasing that despite the many 
challenges the Company has had to face, particularly 
with regard to the Middle East, we have reported a 
50% increase in PBT.”
Dividend
Our improved performance this year, and confidence in the 
future prospects for the Group, has resulted in the Board 
recommending a final dividend of 0.40 pence per share  
(2014: 0.35 pence). If approved at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting the total dividend for the year would be  
0.70 pence per share (2014: 0.61 pence).
Board and people
I was appointed Chairman on 11 November 2014 following 
Ishbel Macpherson’s decision to step down from the Board  
on the same date. Russell Down joined the Board as Group 
Finance Director on 6 April 2015 succeeding Lynn Krige who 
stepped down from the Board on 16 October 2014. Michael 
Averill, a non-executive Director since 1 May 2008, stepped 
down from the Board with effect from 26 February 2015.  
Dr Chris Masters, who was appointed a Non-Executive Director 
on 13 July 2011, succeeded Michael as Senior Independent 
Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, also 
with effect from 26 February 2015. I would like to thank all our 
people for their professionalism, commitment and dedication 
over the past year. These have been challenging times and 
there is still a great deal to do but, thanks to some outstanding 
contributions and no little personal sacrifice, we can all look 
forward to a successful future for Speedy.
Outlook
In the UK we have a market leading position and see major 
opportunities ahead. Our initiatives to harness these 
opportunities are already well underway. We are, once again, 
in a position to deliver sustainable profit growth and our 
confidence for the future is underpinned by an increase in the 
recommended final dividend. I look forward to reporting on 
further progress.

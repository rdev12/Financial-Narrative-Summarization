Chief Executive’s Statement
Over the past twelve months, my priority as
Chief Executive has been to ensure the
effective implementation of Cluff Gold’s
strategy focused on the successful
development of the Company’s mining assets.
At an operational and corporate level we have
had significant success in progressing our full
asset portfolio, with a number of key
milestones achieved. Additionally Cluff Gold
has delivered a strong set of financial results
for the period, which has strengthened our
financial position and which will contribute to
our development plans looking forward as we
look to take Cluff Gold through to the next
phase of growth. The work undertaken to
implement and strengthen the management
systems, such as the improvement of the
supply chain and inventory management, has
enabled Kalsaka to achieve strong operational
performance over the twelve month period. 
I am also pleased to report that we have
exceeded production guidance for the second
year running. The combination of constrained
cash costs and a robust gold price has
generated a healthy cash margin for the
Company and this is a testament to both the
management team and the work force at all
the operations. 
The acquisition of Sega in January of this year
has assisted us in achieving our objective of
significantly increasing the oxide life at Kalsaka
to deliver and maintain near term production.
The final approval from the government which
completes the Sega transaction is due shortly.
Continuing to deliver significant operational
cashflow at Kalsaka is fundamental as we
further our exploration programme across 
all of our mining operations. 
Our flagship project, Baomahun, continues to
progress well, and is now at a pivotal time in its
development. Indicated resources increased by
46% in September and we look forward to the
updated resource statement due for
completion later this month. Following the
receipt of the environmental permit, we are now
well positioned to complete the environmental
impact assessmentand the feasibility study
remains on track for completion in June 2012.
The work undertaken for the run-of-river hydro-
electric power project has demonstrated that it
could provide substantial savings in operating
costs, in addition to de-coupling the project
economics from the long term oil price.
In Côte d’Ivoire, we have delivered on our
strategy to focus on the sulphide potential at
the Yaoure mine, with extremely encouraging
drilling results. This is a new and exciting
opportunity for the Company and it seems
fitting to distinguish this new project from the
previous small heap leach oxide property,
which is the reason why we have re-named
the project.
Peter Spivey
Chief Executive
I am pleased to report that we have exceeded production
guidance for the second year running. The combination of
constrained cash costs and a robust gold price has generated 
a healthy cash margin for the Company and this is a testament
to both the management team and the work force at all 
the operations.  Going forward, the Company’s focus of
concentrating on assets capable of sustaining
over 100,000 ounces of annual gold
production, rather than smaller heap leach
plants, re-iterates our stated aim for becoming
a mid-tier producer.
In March 2012, the Company successfully
completed a £23 million fundraising. It was
encouraging to see the investor support, which
was oversubscribed, from both existing and
new shareholders. The Company has further
strengthened its balance sheet, which will
assist Cluff Gold in bringing Sega into
production and fully capitalising on the
significant growth opportunities that exist
across our asset portfolio. 
Good assets can only be realised by the right
people. This year we have continued to
strengthen the management team both in
London and in West Africa. Of critical
importance has been the strengthening of our
exploration team. The appointment of Peter
Brown as Group Exploration Manager has
already delivered in terms of the progress we
are seeing in Côte d’Ivoire. We have also
appointed a new country manager for Côte
d’Ivoire, Mr Moussa Serifou, to re-inforce our
commitment to that country. On the project
development side, Mr Richard Quarmby has
joined the Executive Committee as Group
Project Manager. Not only is he taking a
leading role in the Baomahun feasibility study,
we have also relied heavily on his expertise to
complete our understanding of the Sega
project, and have entrusted him to manage 
the plans to bring Sega into production. 
Additionally, we warmly welcome John
McGloin to the Cluff Gold team. 
The appointment of John is a necessary step
for Cluff Gold. The Company has now reached
a stage in its development where it needs an
Executive Chairman who can spend significant
time liaising with shareholders and the wider
financial community in both London and North
America. His role will also be to help to define
the future corporate strategy of the business,
as I continue to focus on building the
operations and identify other business
opportunities in Africa. His technical and
financial experience will be of significant value
to the Board, as we look to maximise returns
for our shareholders and emerge as one of the
leading gold producers in West Africa.
Finally, on behalf of the Board and all our
employees, I would like to thank Algy Cluff, 
as the founder of Cluff Gold, for his invaluable
contribution to the Company. He has secured 
a strong portfolio of assets and built a leading
management team that has enabled the
Company to achieve a strong and stable
platform for significant future growth. We wish
Algy every success for the future, and look
forward to his continued support in his new
role as a consultant.

The Company’s cash generating asset,
Kalsaka, delivered excellent results in 2011,
exceeding production guidance for the second
consecutive year by pouring over 71,500
ounces of fine gold. This generated EBITDA 
of US$51.9m, an increase of 78% from the
previous year, to fund the Company’s activities.
This significant EBITDA generation was
assisted by the robust gold price, with an
average price of US$1,586 per ounce realised
in 2011, representing a 30% increase on the
previous year. Cash costs were well contained,
at US$823 per ounce, a 4% increase
compared to the prior year. Cash margins were
therefore very strong, at US$763 per ounce for
the year, representing a 78% increase
compared to 2010.
This EBITDA performance reflects a strong
operational performance for the mine during
the year. The mining team delivered a total of
1.90Mt of ore in 2011, a 23% increase
compared to the prior year, at a strip ratio of
6.67. The strip ratio represented an 8%
reduction compared to 2010 reflecting a
natural reduction at depth in the primary mining
zones. A total of 1.65Mt of ore was stacked in
2011, a 6% increase on 2010, reflecting good
ore availability and utilisation of the plant
throughout the year to reduce plant downtime. 
The average reported head grade of 1.45g/t
was slightly lower than achieved in 2010,
reflecting lower grade areas of the mine which
were processed in H1. This variation in grade is
reflected in the comparative performance in H1
and H2, with 56% of production generated in
the second half at a time of higher gold prices.
2012 Expectations
Kalsaka is forecast to produce between 60,000
and 70,000 ounces of gold in 2012, slightly
below the performance in 2011. This is based
on 1.6Mt of ore being processed at an average
head grade of approximately 1.4g/t.
The forecast production range takes into
account the nature of the ore the Company is
expecting to process in 2012. During Q4 2011,
a crushing circuit was successfully installed at
the Kalsaka mine, allowing previously
stockpiled quartz material to be processed
alongside more quartz rich material being
encountered in one of the pits. This quartz
material has a longer leach cycle than the
softer ore with which it is being blended.
Accordingly, we have set out a production
range which will allow for a larger gold lock-up
in working capital at 31 December 2012 than
previously experienced and we expect 2012
production to be stronger in the second half 
of the year.
Sega
The existing known reserves and stockpiles at
Kalsaka are expected to be stacked until Q1
2013. Some mine life extension is expected
from near term exploration targets currently
under evaluation, together with the processing
of transitional ore. However, the Board is
keenly aware of the importance of on-going
operational cash flow during the construction
phase at Baomahun. Accordingly, on 3
February 2012, the Company announced the
legally binding, conditional acquisition of the
Sega project from Orezone Gold Corporation
(“Orezone”). Completion of the acquisition
remains conditional on the approval of the
Government of Burkina Faso, which the
Company expects to receive shortly. The
acquisition will provide an immediate mine life
extension at Kalsaka to ensure that production
continues past 2013. The Sega project has an
area of 313k sq. km across two adjacent
licences, which host an indicated mineral
resource of 450,366 ounces (8.3Mt at 1.7g/t)
and an inferred mineral resource of 147,344
ounces (2.9Mt at 1.6g/t) with additional
exploration potential.
T o optimise the exploitation of the Sega 
ore body, it is intended that the oxide and
transitional resources will be processed
through the existing Kalsaka heap leach 
plant. This will keep capital expenditure to a
minimum, reduce the environmental footprint
and ensure a rapid start to production. Whilst
the total resources at Sega have a similar
grade to the existing Kalsaka operation at
1.7g/t, the deposit actually contains a higher
grade core of mineralisation averaging over
2g/t that is expected to have positive operating
cost implications once production
commences. Detailed metallurgical test work
completed by Orezone has indicated average
heap leach recoveries of 85% for oxide and
transitional ore with favourable agglomeration
properties. Therefore, the cash cost per ounce
from the processing of the Sega ore, including
the costs of haulage, is expected to be lower
than currently incurred at Kalsaka.
Work has commenced on a Preliminary
Economic Assessment to confirm the technical
plans to mine and process the Sega resources,
which is expected to be completed in May
2012. Work is currently underway in respect 
of an environmental and social impact
assessment, under the guidance of Digby
Wells, to ensure that the licencing of the Sega
property can be concluded in good time to
allow a smooth transition for processing from
Kalsaka to Sega ore sources.
Exploration
The Company believes there is a strong
potential to further increase oxide resources
across its combined current and recently
Kalsaka delivered excellent results in 2011, exceeding
production guidance for the second consecutive year by
pouring over 71,505 ounces of fine gold and generating
US$51.9m in EBITDA.
Sega: High grade mineralised core acquired licences, thereby extending the life of
the existing heap leach operations at Kalsaka.
The acquisition of the Sega project does not
diminish the focus on exploration, with the
recent acceleration of activity to be maintained.
Exploration targets will be generated and
prioritised systematically across the various
licences in the vicinity. 
In 2011, a total of 36,546m of RAB and
39,859m of RC drilling was completed across
the Kalsaka and Yako licences. Promising
results were received at the Zoungwa and
Rondo prospects, which are expected to add
to the oxide mine life at Kalsaka. In 2012,
drilling has continued within both the Kalsaka
and Yako licence areas. In addition, Orezone
has completed 10,000m of RC drilling at the
Sega property focusing on a number of new
targets for which results are expected soon.
The Company’s near term strategy at Kalsaka
is to maintain the heap leach operation, which
does not require significant high cost power
consumption usually associated with milling. 
In the longer term, the exploration team are
tasked with demonstrating the sulphide
potential across the region, with a view to
developing a CIL plant once grid power is
available in the region.

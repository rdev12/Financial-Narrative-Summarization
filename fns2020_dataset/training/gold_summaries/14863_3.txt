Progress
I am pleased to report that the Group 
increased total annualised recurring 
revenue by 1% to £28.7 million (2012: £28.5 
million at constant currency) including 
a 114% increased contribution from 
StatPro Revolution of £3.2 million (2012: 
£1.5 million). Total revenue increased by 
2% to £32.5 million (2012: £32.0 million). 
Owing to increased investment primarily 
in sales, client services and infrastructure 
related to StatPro Revolution, adjusted 
profit before tax decreased by 20% to 
£4.1 million (2012: £5.0 million). StatPro 
Revolution related recurring revenue 
now amounts to £9.2 million (2012: 
£3.9 million), representing 37% of total 
software recurring revenue (2012: 16%).
Dividend
Your Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 1.95p per share for 2013 payable on 
21 May 2014 to all shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 25 
April 2014, taking the total dividend to 
2.8p per share (2012: 2.7p per share) an 
increase of 4%. We intend to maintain 
a progressive dividend policy.
Products
In 2013, total research and development 
expenditure increased by 6% to £4.4 million 
(2012: £4.2 million) representing 14% of 
Group revenue. The total cash expenditure 
on StatPro Revolution including marketing 
and other costs incurred in 2013 amounted 
to £4.9 million (2012: £3.7 million).
During the year, we launched the beta 
version of StatPro R+, the cloud replacement 
for StatPro Seven. Simplification will be our 
motto for 2014; we will continue to develop 
valuable features to help our clients tackle 
increased regulation, the refocusing of 
the performance analytics function and, 
uniquely, our clients will be able to share 
their analysis with all the stakeholders 
in the investment decision process. 
People
As your Company is transformed to a 
pure, cloud-based analytics provider, 
our employees have continued to 
excel and again I take this opportunity 
to thank them for their enthusiasm, 
resourcefulness and sheer determination 
to meet your Company’s objectives.
Prospects
Whilst markets remain volatile, the 
prospects for the asset management 
industry look brighter than last year. Asset 
managers are reviewing their investment in 
technology with regulation, reducing costs 
and communication remaining key drivers: 
your Company is well placed as asset 
managers seek to eliminate complexity and 
update their processes.

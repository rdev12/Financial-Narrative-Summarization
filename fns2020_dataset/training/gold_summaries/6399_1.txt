PERFORMANCE
The main risk arising from our ﬁnancial 
instruments is interest rate risk, which the 
board reviews regularly. Our policy is to 
accept a degree of interest rate risk, as long 
as the effect of rate changes remains within 
prescribed ranges. During the year the Group 
entered into a swap agreement which has the 
 replaced a previous swap, which expired in 
February 2012.
All of our material activities take place in the 
United Kingdom, so we face little direct 
exchange risk other than payments to 
overseas suppliers who require settlement in 
their currency. If there is any material foreign 
exchange exposure, the Group’s policy is to 
enter into forward foreign currency contracts. 
The Group had no material currency 
 Critical accounting policies and 
assumptions
Goodwill and intangibles
The Group’s carrying values for goodwill and 



intangibles during the year reﬂects the 

management systems, less amortisation.
Our ﬁnance team tests these carrying  
values for impairment on an annual basis. 
The calculations use pre-tax cash ﬂow 
 budgets approved by our divisional 
management teams.
The key assumptions within these budgets 
relate to the discount rate, revenue growth 
and proﬁt margins. The calculations were 
carried out following the year end and found 
no need to record any impairment of these 
assets. Further information about impairment 
testing is provided in note 10.
Shared equity
The Group’s carrying value for shared equity 
receivables, shown within available for sale 
 
 The shared equity receivables largely have 
non-ﬁxed repayment dates and variable 
repayment amounts, and are secured by a 
second legal charge on the related property. 
They are stated at fair value as described in 
note 14.
In determining the fair value, the key 
assumptions we use are the date of ﬁnal 
repayment of the receivable, house price 
inﬂation and the discount rate. These 
variables are largely outside our control  
and we monitor them on a regular basis,  
to ensure that we change the assumptions  
if required.
There were no signiﬁcant changes to  
the Group’s critical accounting policies  
or assumptions, which are set out in note 1 
to the ﬁnancial statements on page 66.
Going concern
The Group’s statement of going concern, 
together with further related information,  
can be found in the directors’ report on  
 
that could affect the Group’s future ﬁnancial 
performance are detailed on pages 34 to 35.

 taking account of land creditor debt, and 
minimum consolidated tangible assets.  
We continue to operate well within these 
covenants. The facility takes security  
against certain of the Group’s housebuilding 
development sites. Interest is calculated  
by aggregating margin, LIBOR and relevant 
costs.
Although the Group continued to have  
year end net cash, as noted above, overall 
debt levels ﬂuctuate throughout the year. 
Average debt during 2012 was approximately 
 We continue to forecast that Group gearing 
will remain at acceptable levels and within the 
parameters that the board has established.
Treasury management and risks
The Group operates under treasury policies 
and procedures approved by the board.  
Our ﬁnancial instruments principally comprise 
bank borrowings, together with cash and 
liquid resources that arise directly from our 
operations. We do not trade in ﬁnancial 
instruments.
The Group ﬁnances its operations through  
a mixture of retained proﬁts and bank 
borrowings. We have rigorous controls in 
place to ensure we maintain borrowings  
at an acceptable level. On a daily basis, we 
aggregate the bank balances or borrowings 
in all the Group’s operating companies into  
a total cash or borrowing ﬁgure, so we can 
obtain the most advantageous offset 
arrangements and interest rate.

Pub restaurants 
Frankie & Benny’s brings together 
the best of classic American and 
Italian style and cuisine, offering 
traditional home-style dishes from 
Little Italy combined with popular 
American dishes that always 
provide great value for money. 
The kitchen buzzes with bustling 
activity as the chefs prepare 
dishes from our broad menu 
– pizza, pastas, burgers, grills 
and other favourites while, in 
typical stateside fashion, service 
at Frankie & Benny’s is second  
to none! 
Settle into a cosy booth to enjoy 
delicious, perfectly cooked and 
filling food while enjoying a casual 
family meal or a catch up with 
friends and observe the clatter 
and chatter of the open kitchen 
and the familiar classic 50’s and 
60’s soundtrack playing in the 
background. The restaurant walls 
are filled with family snapshots 
and memorabilia showing life  
on the lower east side of the  
Big Apple, helping you into a  
“New York state-of-mind”.
Frankie & Benny’s provides a fun 
and friendly atmosphere for all to 
enjoy delivering fantastic value, 
great food and brilliant service.
First opened in 1995 in Leicester, 
Frankie & Benny’s has become 
one of the best known casual 
dining brands in the United 
Kingdom, and trades successfully 
in leisure and retail locations, 
stand-alone sites and at five 
airports. The estate comprises 
almost 200 restaurants spread 
across the country from 
Aberdeen to St Austell. 
Mexican for fun, for fantastic food, 
for an amazing atmosphere –  
for a good time, guaranteed.
Chiquito offers great value, 
authentic Mexican food in a fun 
and lively venue, with fantastic 
Latin American music. What more 
do you need for a great night out?
The décor draws inspiration from 
Mexican architecture and Latin 
style. Some sites have a rustic 
and relaxed feel while others 
demonstrate the buzz and 
graphic energy of contemporary 
Mexico City.
The menu offers traditional 
Mexican, including nachos, 
burritos, enchiladas and our 
signature sizzling fajitas, as well 
as favourites from “North of  
the Border” – burgers, salads  
and steaks from the grill. We 
specialise in Mexican beer and 
fantastic cocktails to ensure  
every meal is a fiesta.
Chiquito is open seven days a 
week for lunch, lazy afternoons 
and lively evenings, so whether 
you’re out shopping, meeting 
friends after work or planning  
a party it’s the only place to be!
Trading in the UK for over 20 
years, Chiquito continues to 
attract a broad mix of young 
adults, couples, teenagers, 
families and large parties.  
More than 60 leisure, retail  
and stand-alone sites cover  
the United Kingdom with more 
development planned for the 
years ahead. 
 
Garfunkel’s – a truly great name  
in British and world cuisine. 
Founded in London’s West End  
in 1979, Garfunkel’s has become 
legendary! It embraces the 
concept of being all things to all 
people and epitomises all that is 
great in world food. But don’t take 
our word for it, relax and enjoy....
Offering something for everyone, 
the menu is a fantastic mix of the 
best of British and international 
cuisine. From the tempting  
Thai Green Curry to the Giant 
Enchilada everything has been 
chosen because we just love  
the taste. Our favourites are the 
classic Fish & Chips and Cottage 
Pie – true British classics.
Our salad bar has become 
famous. With a delicious range of 
fresh salads and prepared dishes 
and dressings available all day, 
you can choose from a single visit 
or opt for the Unlimited Salad Bar 
and make as many visits to the 
salad bar as you wish.
Principally located across  
Central London, each Garfunkel’s 
restaurant offers a place to relax 
and take a break from the  
hustle and bustle outside. Each 
restaurant has a loyal following  
of visitors, local residents and 
workers who have been eating at 
Garfunkel’s for years. It’s as much 
about the experience as the  
tasty food, and you won’t be 
disappointed in either! 
Garfunkel’s continuing popularity 
means expansion is still on the 
menu after over 30 years of 
trading. Our latest restaurant 
opened on Tottenham Court 
Road, Central London, in 2009, 
and offers the same friendly 
welcome and broad menu in a 
warm contemporary setting, just 
what you need after a hectic 
shopping trip in the West End or 
the perfect way to complement a 
theatre visit. Continued success 
means a healthy appetite  
for growth with more sites 
earmarked to open in  
Central London.
Really great pubs are timeless, 
familiar and very British. 
Everybody knows what their 
perfect pub looks like. For us it’s 
an ideal place for people who like 
to get together, eat, drink and talk 
in a relaxed friendly atmosphere. 
Each of our pubs has its own 
style and personality, and you’ll 
always find a warm welcome, 
ageless interiors, fine British  
pub food, a large variety of  
great real ales and fine wine  
and great coffee.
Mostly set in beautiful rural or 
semi-rural locations, each pub 
has a ‘local’ feel and many are  
set in intriguing buildings with 
fascinating histories. We don’t 
want all our pubs to look and feel 
the same – instead we preserve 
the character of the building, 
which after all was what attracted 
us to the pub in the first place. 
We open all day, and you can pop 
in for a fresh coffee, a pint of real 
ale, glass of wine or some honest 
home cooking at any time. The 
range of beers available changes 
frequently and seasonal and local 
specials mean the menu also 
offers new choices alongside 
trusted favourites each time  
you visit.
There’s friendly, engaging service 
from the moment you arrive, 
ensuring that all your needs are 
taken care of. We hire people who 
genuinely like people and enjoy 
“being there” for our customers, 
and have the flair to operate their 
own business within our Group.
We believe that really great pubs 
will never go out of fashion, and 
that opportunities to expand in 
the sector are available for 
experienced operators with the 
right offer for customers. In 2007 
The Restaurant Group bought 
Brunning & Price, an award-
winning pub business. By 
blending the expertise that 
Brunning & Price brings with  
our own resources, ideas and 
experience, we will develop our 
pubs business and aim to open 
three or four new sites a year 
going forward.  Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements

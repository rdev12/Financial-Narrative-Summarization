CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
WELL POSITIONED FOR GROWTH
John Hirst
Group Chief Executive
Market Dynamics
Although less volatile than the semi-conductor
market, our trading environment is determined in
part by the cyclical nature of the global electronic
components market. Regionally, the timing of the
cycle creates different impacts. Whilst Asia has
been growing for over 18 months, fuelled by the
rapid growth in China, and there have been the
first signs of improvement in North America since
the middle of last year, there are still no notable
signs of growth in Europe.
This pattern has undoubtedly been influenced
by the continued migration of production to low
cost economies – from Western Europe and
North America to Mexico, Eastern Europe and,
in particular, China.
The shift towards greater volumes of business
being conducted on the web and through
eProcurement is gaining momentum. Our
customers are continually driving to reduce
the costs of procuring consumables and
looking for productivity improvements and
waste elimination, including supplier base
rationalisation. Increasingly, they are focussing
on their key skills and out sourcing non-strategic
skills, relying on companies like ours to provide
efficient sourcing.
In Europe and several US States, legislation is
pending which restricts the use of heavy metals
like lead and cadmium in electrical and
electronic equipment. Further laws are designed
to govern the disposal of waste electronic and
electrical goods. We estimate this will affect
between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the
products we sell. As manufacturers determine
their individual responses, customers are
looking for information and guidance. We are
establishing a leadership position by using
our knowledge and expertise to help
customers and suppliers prepare for this
change through web sites and an active
communications programme.
Our Proposition
For some years, we have defined our market
proposition as one of providing economic
benefit and peace of mind to our customers
and suppliers. Our customers come to us for
three main reasons – a broad product range,
available on demand, and quick and effective
delivery. From this, our customers can be more
efficient and have greater reassurance than if
they had to search less reliable sources for
product. The range of additional services we
have developed to strengthen this basic
proposition enables us to build much stronger
and more permanent customer relationships.
These services include vendor managed
inventory systems, which reduce our customers’
need to hold stock, and tailored eProcurement
and web site solutions, which help save time
and reduce administration costs.
Over recent years, we have built upon our
relationship with suppliers, adding value by
providing marketing services. With two million
customer contacts on our database, our
suppliers understand and appreciate the
unparalleled reach that we now have in the
market place.
Progress against our strategy
Our strategy is to drive for sales and profits
growth, by increasing spend from existing
customers, recruiting new customers,
developing new markets and acquisitions.
A key element in winning business with existing
and new customers is adding products to our
range to satisfy more needs for more customers.
We have made significant progress this year in
expanding our product range, particularly to
strengthen our offer to design engineers and we
will continue to push these product expansions.
From our North American inventories, we are
now able to ship direct to customers in Europe
and Asia Pacific in three days. This has added
70,000 products to our offer in these markets.
Rebranding four of our businesses under the
InOne label has enabled us to communicate
more effectively the full range of products and
services we offer across our businesses to both
our customers and suppliers.
As the shift to eCommerce continues,
reaching 11% of total sales of the Marketing
and Distribution Division this year, the level of
business we transact with our customers
through eProcurement channels continues to
grow, delivering cost efficiencies. We have also
seen progress with our global and major
customers, where our ability to provide a
customised eProcurement solution has
delivered significant sales growth rates.
Our suite of customer relationship management
systems is now fully implemented in Newark
InOne in the US and Farnell InOne in the UK
and we are seeing some real benefits in our
service to customers, our own productivity and
the intelligence we have readily available to
enhance our customer offer.
Our global product database and publication
management systems are delivering
genuine improvements in our productivity,
significantly reducing the time and resources
required to prepare product catalogues and
promotional materials.
We are well positioned to respond to our
customers’ drive to reduce the overall costs of
procuring indirect materials, taking our inventory
management and procurement skills into the
heart of our customers’ businesses.
We have made good progress identifying and
penetrating new markets. We have expanded
our operations in China, with the opening of a
sales office and distribution centre in Shanghai,
and sales in Mexico are building satisfactorily as
our new office and distribution centre becomes
established. Each time we identify a new
customer group or segment and focus our skills
upon it, we make particularly good progress.
Looking ahead
As momentum builds in our markets, we are
well positioned to benefit. Our new systems are
fully operational, with the right people in place
to exploit the opportunities they present. By
gaining market share through the downturn, we
have demonstrated our successful strategy of
focussing on specific groups of customers –
understanding their needs and deploying our
resources to respond to them.
There are still uncertainties around the duration
and scale of the market upturn in North
America, so we will continue to manage our
costs carefully. Then, as we grow, a significant
proportion of sales growth, from our efforts and
the improved market, falls to the bottom line.
This year has seen solid results in a tough
market and good progress against our
objectives. We have the capacity in both
infrastructure and people to continue to build
on the market share gains we have seen in
Europe and to take advantage of the market
upturn we are beginning to see in North
America. We have continued to upgrade our
management team and have some outstanding
people working in our business.
Notwithstanding the considerable organic
growth potential, we will continue to review good
quality acquisition opportunities as they arise. 08 PREMIER FARNELL PLC CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW BROADENING OUR OFFER

Business issue
Specialising in industrial electronics, Trifix
Electronics Services Ltd. based in the North of
England provides hi-tech repairs to items such
as sophisticated pressing machinery, test and
measurement and robotics equipment. 
Trifix started business in 2003 and is rapidly
building a reputation for the speed and
professionalism of its service – crucial factors
for its customer base.
Late one Monday afternoon, Trifix had a call
from an automotive component manufacturing
company that had an urgent repair need for
part of its manufacturing equipment. The speed
of repair to this equipment was of the essence,
as potential production downtime penalties,
running at thousands of pounds per minute,
could be levied on the automotive component
manufacturer.
Typically, this type of expensive capital
equipment comes from outside the UK and
replacement component lead times from the
manufacturers can be 12-14 weeks.
Trifix needed to identify and source the repair
components rapidly.
The solution
As part of the InOne family of businesses,
Farnell InOne has access to millions of products
from around the world. 
More specifically, its Newark InOne Direct Ship
service gives customers easy access to an
additional 70,000 products from Newark InOne
in the US.
The sales team from Farnell InOne was able to
locate the specific components required, which
were not available anywhere in the UK, from
Newark InOne. Trifix placed the order at
6.30 pm on Monday and received delivery by
9.30 am on Wednesday. By mid afternoon, Trifix
had completed the repair and had the
equipment back on site with its customer.

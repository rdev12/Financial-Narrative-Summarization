Bernard Burns, Chief Executive:
“Previous management action to
reduce the Company’s cost base and
improve the productivity of the
business ensured the Company has
been able to endure recent extreme
market conditions. In particular the
early and cold Easter, the poor
harvest due to heavy rains and the
rising costs of raw materials.
“With inflationary pressures subsiding, fuel and
haulage costs returning to more realistic levels the
Company is starting to restore its margins as price
increases begin to flow through.
“Traditionally sales of garden products are relatively
resilient during economic downturns. With a low
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, strong peat
reserves, a 100 per cent increase in the use of recycled
materials in our products and a reputation in the
industry for strong customer service, we are well placed
to withstand the current economic downturn.”

“The Group’s core businesses performed well during the year and provided improved earnings
per share and substantial cash flows. Investment in the Group’s core businesses also gained
pace with one acquisition completed and several investments in additional capacity now
under way.
The EMD market remained most difficult and the closure of Delta EMD’s Australia plant
should prevent future losses, provide an opportunity to realise value from these assets, and
assure Delta EMD’s South Africa plant more attractive market conditions.
Whilst the IAS 19 valuation of the Delta Pension Plan remains favourable, the plan remains
disproportionately large, and reducing the scale of the plan cost-effectively remains a priority
if possible in present market conditions.”

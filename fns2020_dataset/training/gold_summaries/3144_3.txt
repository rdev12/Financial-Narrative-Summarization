CeNeS	has	continued	to	make	significant	progress	with	its	product	
pipeline 	 in 	 2007. 	 In 	 F ebruary 	 2007 	 the 	 Company 	 announced 	 good	
Phase	III	data	from	the	largest	ever	Phase	III	trial	of	its	lead	drug	M6G	
and	in	August	announced	the	out ‑licensing	agreement	with	Ono	for	
Japanese	rights	to	the	short	acting	sedative/anaesthetic	CNS	7056.	
This	deal	alone	underpins	the	current	valuation	of	the	Company .
Also 	 in 	 August 	 we 	 completed 	 an 	 institutional 	 placing 	 of 	 shares 	 raising

CeNeS	has	met	with	the	FD A	to	clarify	the	clinical	trials	programme	
required	for	the	development	of	M6G	in	the	US.	T wo	Phase	III	studies	
will	be	required:
1)		 A	comparison	of	the	analgesic	efficacy	and	safety	of	three	dose	
levels	of	M6G,	morphine	and	placebo	in	patients	with	acute	pain	
following 	 bunionectomy 	 – 	 CeNeS 	 has 	 completed 	 the 	 draft 	 protocol	
for	this	study .

Three	further	Phase	I	safety	studies	are	now	completed:

rate	of	an	IV	injection	of	M6G	in	healthy	volunteers;

impaired	patients;	and
	 M6G029,	the	U S	IND	opening	study	in	volunteers.
CeNeS	currently	anticipates	that	MAA	and	ND A	( “ Marketing	
Authorisation	Approval	and	New	Drug	Application ” )	submissions	
for 	 M6G 	 could 	 be 	 made 	 in 	 2011 	 although 	 this 	 is 	 dependent	
o n 	 the	signing	of	p artnership	deals	 to	enable	the	partners	
to	fund	the	required	additional	Phase	III	trials.

CeNes	second	clinical	candidate	is	CNS	5161	for	the	treatment	
of	neuropathic	pain,	a	poorly	treated	condition	with	an	estimated	
26	million	patients	worldwide.	Phase	II	studies	completed	to	date

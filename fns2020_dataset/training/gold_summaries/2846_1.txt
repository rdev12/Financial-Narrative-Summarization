 12 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
A strong ﬁ nancial performance in 2008
Revenues were up 45.2% (24.1% from organic growth) at 
£622.7 million (2007: £428.8 million) with revenues from 
outside the UK now exceeding 50% of total Group revenues. 
Cape is now a recognised international industrial services 
provider with a presence in the large majority of the 
world’s major hydrocarbon processing and power 
generation markets.
Operating proﬁ ts before other items were up 68.0% (39.8% 
from organic growth) at £65.0 million (2007: £38.7 million), 
with the operating margin before other items increasing to 
10.4% (2007: 9.0%).
Progress with Australian acquisitions
Notable progress has been made with the integration, 
restructuring and repositioning of the three Australian 
acquisitions completed towards the end of 2007, into a single 
multi-disciplinary industrial services business trading under 
the Cape brand. We are now bidding and winning major 
contracts under the Cape name and have continued to 
invest in the key areas of health, safety, environment and 
quality, business development and information systems. 
Over the full year the combined revenues of the three 
businesses have been broadly ﬂ at. However margins in 
the second half recovered strongly under Cape’s newly 
appointed Australian management team.
Cape now has a presence in what is recognised as the 
second largest growth market for LNG exports in the 
world behind only Sub-Saharan Africa. The planned and 
announced construction of between nine and eleven new 
LNG liquefaction trains makes Australia a key market for 
Cape. Recent investments in coal seam gas projects by 
ConocoPhillips, BG, Petronas and others provide an excellent 
medium-term opportunity for Cape’s Australian business.
Cash generation and debt reduction
The Group’s operating cash ﬂ ow
(2)
 of £74.7 million (2007: 
£19.4 million) reﬂ ects a strong operating cash conversion
(2) 
of 115.3% (2007: 51.1%). Net cash inﬂ ow from operating 
activities was £48.2 million (2007: £6.9 million). 
At 31 December 2008, Cape had net debt excluding Scheme 
Funds of £165.5 million (2007: £189.2 million) including cash 
balances of £33.3 million (2007: £20.1 million). The Group’s 
balance sheet gearing has reduced to 67.2% (2007: 104.7%) 
and the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA
(3) 
has fallen from 
4.0 times to 2.1 times.
Strategy continues to deliver
With a clear focus on the downstream energy and mineral 
resources infrastructure markets, Cape’s broadened 
geographical and sector spread have provided a platform 
across which to sell both its core and additional services. 
Whilst we have seen low commodity prices impacting on some 
of our customers’ investment decisions, our strategy continues 
to be underpinned by the following key market drivers:
–  increasing levels of maintenance and capital spending 
to maintain, extend the life and decommission an ageing 
energy infrastructure in the UK;
–  an increasing trend on the part of Cape’s major 
customers to outsource non-core services and to 
look for cost effective bundled service proposals. 
These customers increasingly seek to outsource 
multi-disciplinary services for both maintenance and 
capital projects to a smaller number of professional 
suppliers with larger scale operations that can provide 
a single source solution;
–  a strong position in higher growth international markets 
such as the Gulf/Middle East and Far East/Paciﬁ c Rim 
following the Australian acquisitions;
Chief Executive’s review
Cape made signiﬁ cant progress in 2008 building on 
the reorganisation and acquisition activity undertaken 
in 2007. This progress is reﬂ ected in the year on year 
growth in both revenues and operating proﬁ ts.  13 Cape plc Annual Report 2008
 –  a strong reputation in growing market segments such 
as the LNG producing/exporting market where there 
is a long list of projects announced in all Cape’s key 
overseas regions and in particular Australia; and
–  a demand on the part of blue chip clients to work with 
safe suppliers who have a proven track record and 
access to local workforces, with the ability to train their 
employees to exacting standards.
Safety
Cape’s accident frequency rate performance of 0.08 per 
100,000 hours worked has exceeded management’s target 
and is world class within the sector. The primary international 
benchmark measure of safety performance is Lost Time 
Incidents (LTI) per 100,000 hours worked, and this has shown 
a further 20% improvement against the excellent performance 
achieved last year. Once again Cape’s safety record was 
recognised with a number of industry awards in 2008, all of 
which are detailed in the Health, safety and the environment 
report on page 24.
Key Performance Indicators
The Group monitors the performance of the business using a 
range of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) on a monthly and 
annual basis. These include adjusted Group operating proﬁ t 
margin, return on managed assets, operating cash conversion 
and LTI frequency rate. Deﬁ nitions and analysis of the KPIs 
are shown on page 90.
Outlook
Current activity levels remain high with strong demand for 
our broadening range of essential industrial services. Recent 
contract wins in the UK have reinforced our market leading 
position in the region. In the medium term we expect demand 
in the UK to continue to increase as our clients’ maintenance 
and decommissioning requirements for their ageing assets 
becomes more evident.
Cape’s overseas markets are more project dependent; our 
strategy is to offer services throughout asset lifecycles, 
and I am pleased that year on year revenue from repeat 
maintenance contracts has increased. In the majority of our 
overseas businesses we remain a small player in very large 
markets. Activity levels have remained high into the ﬁ rst 
quarter of this year, particularly in the UK and Gulf/Middle 
East, and again highlight the beneﬁ t of Cape’s downstream 
and production asset focus. We are conﬁ dent that with 
Cape’s ability to offer cost effective bundled solutions, 
throughout asset lifecycles, across our enlarged footprint, 
means that the Company is well positioned to continue to 
deliver positive growth.

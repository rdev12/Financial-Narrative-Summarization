 Chairman’s statement
for the year ended 31 May 2008
In the 12 months to 31 May 2009 the Company achieved a number of strategic and operating milestones
although this was against the background of a severe global recession and a sustained reduction of output within
the automotive industry. The key milestones were:
● The award of a multi-year contract with Mov’it GmbH, a leading supplier of high performance brake systems
within the European aftermarket, which is forecast to yield revenues of £300,000 to £400,000 per annum in
future years.
● ISO 9001 qualification. 
● Completion of the CVIST manufacturing project which provides the capability of the carbon infiltration of
discs in house and contributes to the reduction in manufacturing costs of approximately 20% for an
automotive brake disc.
● A further £100,000 contract from MBDA the European leader in missile and rocket technology.
There were disappointments as well and these resulted from the very sharp decline in business confidence during
the final months of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. In February 2009, we signalled that the Company’s
revenues for the full year would fall short of the market expectations that were set in August 2008 and that the
principal cause of the revenue reduction was a prospective fall in orders from our automotive customers. The
Company has now met its revised expectations for revenues and operating losses for the full year. Business in
the year was considerably higher than budget from the aerospace and defence market sectors and this provides
the Company with a platform for growth despite the continued low levels of business expected from the
automotive sector during the remainder of 2009 and most of 2010.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
In the 12 months to 31 May 2009, revenue was £679,284 (2008: £508,111). This represents an increase of 34%
over the prior year.
At 31 May the Order Book, representing confirmed orders, was £166,370 (2008: £302,124). The reduction in
the order book level over the period is mainly due to the reduction in business from the automotive sector,
however, the Order Book had grown to £308,108 by 5 August 2009. The Order Book does not reflect orders not
yet placed with regards to the annual, multi-year supply contracts the Company has signed during 2008 with
MBDA for rocket components; for carbon-ceramic brake automotive discs with Mov’it or for the supply of carbon
brake discs with a leading European brake systems group.
Losses after taxation for the 12 month period were £840,740 (2008: £594,065). These include a non cash charge
of £94,424 (2008: £56,609) relating to share based payments under IFRS 20.
Earnings per share for the year was a loss of 4.42p (2008: 3.33p).
Capital Expenditure in the period was £71,428 (2008: £142,599).
The Company had a Cash balance of £404,275 (2008: £1,112,719) at 31 May 2009 and it has no borrowings.
Shareholder Funds at 31 May 2009 were £1,026,523 (2008: £1,722,839).

DEVELOPMENTS
The Company has progressed sufficiently far in the application of its technology that it now has a number of
global based customers operating in each of its main end user markets: Aerospace & Defence; High Performance
Automotive and the Automotive Race Market.
A number of these clients are either evaluating the Company’s technology for license or are purchasing brake
discs or rocket components for their development programmes or for commercial use. 
To facilitate the management of the operations and to ensure its core Intellectual Property (IP) is fully protected,
the Company has created four wholly owned operating subsidiaries. The IP and the management is held within
the Group plc company and the technology is licensed down to each subsidiary. This means that Licensing 
and Commercial supply agreements within each subsidiary are kept separate and the Group can now consider
the sale of one or more of its subsidiaries should the opportunity arise. The new Group structure commenced 
1 June 2009.
PEOPLE
Mr. Julio Faria, one of the founder directors, left the board during December 2008 and now has sold the majority
of his shareholding in the Company. We wish him well for the future.
OUTLOOK
The Group is focussed on achieving new business wins in the aerospace and defence markets whilst it recognises
that business from the automotive brake sector will remain subdued until well into the second half of 2010. The
Chief Executive’s report describes the opportunities in each of the main user markets and there is good reason
to be confident that we shall report improved results in the 2010 financial year.
Management has reduced the overhead base by an estimated £200,000 p.a going forward and the Company has
received initial notice from the DTI that it has been awarded another multi year development grant which will
reduce overheads further and improve cash flows.
The Company secured a fundraising of £410,000 net of expenses during July 2009. The issue of 4,516,580 new
ordinary shares at 10 pence per share will take place on 13 August 2009. This will be used to assist with working
capital needs over the next 24 months.
Whilst forecasting accurately can be difficult in these economic conditions, the board is cautiously optimistic
that it can increase business revenues and reduce losses in the 2010 financial year ending 31 May 2010 and
work towards breaking even in cash terms.

GROUP REVENUE
DMGT’s strategy emphasises 
growth for each of its businesses. 
Management targets sustained 
growth in Group revenue.
GROUP ADJUSTED PROFIT  
BEFORE TAX
As a portfolio-based Group, 
DMGT periodically buys and sells 
businesses. This KPI monitors the 
Group’s adjusted operating 
profitability.
OPERATING MARGIN %
DMGT’s investment criteria 
emphasise profitable, high 
growth sectors. In the long term, 
increasing adjusted operating 
margin indicates an 
improvement in the quality  
of its business assets.
NET DEBT
Management aims to regain 
DMGT’s investment grade status 
by reducing debt. Keeping net 
debt:EBITDA between 1.5 and 2 
times improves M&A flexibility. 
DIVIDEND PER SHARE
The Board’s policy is to maintain 
dividend growth in real terms 
every year.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Management seeks above 
average growth in adjusted 
earnings per share to maximise 
overall returns for its owners. 23

B2B SHARE OF OPERATING PROFIT
The growth and profitability of its 
business divisions are key 
components of DMGT’s strategy. 
This KPI tracks the proportion of 
operating profit attributable to 
B2B activities.
NORTH AMERICA SHARE OF 
OPERATING PROFIT
DMGT is committed to 
maintaining a significant, 
sustainable presence in North 
America markets. This KPI allows 
management to monitor the 
relative profitability of its North 
American units. 
DIGITAL SHARE OF REVENUES
We expect digital activities  
to account for the majority of 
DMGT’s future growth. This KPI 
tracks the rate at which the 
Group is monetising its digital 
content.
INTERNATIONAL SHARE  
OF REVENUES
This measures the proportion of 
revenue generated outside the 
UK. DMGT’s long-term strategic 
objective is to develop into a 
global growth company. The  
KPI measures DMGT’s success in 
internationalising the business.
SUBSCRIPTION SHARE OF B2B 
REVENUES
Subscription-based B2B revenue  
is a more stable and less cyclical 
revenue source than advertising. It 
is also a good proxy for monitoring 
growth in B2B digital revenues.  
This KPI tracks the Group’s ability to 
generate high-quality, digital B2B 
earnings.
SHARE PRICE VS FTSE ALL SHARE 
INDEX 
Management monitors the DMGT 
share price against the FTSE All 
Share Index to assess the Group’s 
relative performance against 
other UK companies.
The Group uses adjusted measures  
of profit for its KPIs, as defined on 
page 21.

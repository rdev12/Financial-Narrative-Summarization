Annual Report 2005
In my first communication with you as Chairman, I am
delighted to report, for the year to 30 April 2005, a 
record year in terms of turnover, pre-tax profit and
earnings per share. 
The adjusted pre-tax profit, which totals £34.5m, 
has again exceeded market expectations. 
Prospects for further progress remain good.
Financial overview
On turnover up 7.3% at £236.0m, adjusted pre-tax profit
increased by 62.0% to £34.5m – a record by a wide
margin. Adjusted basic earnings per share were 54.7%
higher at 6.28p, reflecting an increased effective tax rate.
“ Adjusted” excludes an exceptional charge (in connection
with restructuring in Japan) of £0.8m (2004: exceptional
credit of £0.4m) and a goodwill amortisation charge of
£0.7m (2004: £0.5m). The reported figures are a pre-tax
profit of £33.0m (2004: £21.1m), up 56.4%, and EPS of
5.96p (2004: 4.01p), up 48.6%.
After £34.5m of capital expenditure and financial
investment, net cash balances increased to £4.1m 
from £2.9m.
Dividends
A final dividend per share of 1.2p (2004: 1.0p) 
is proposed. T ogether with the interim dividend of 
0.8p (2004: nil), dividends per share are doubled at
2.0p (2004: 1.0p) and are three times (2004: four 
times) covered.
If approved at the AGM on 28 September 2005, the 
final dividend will be paid on 2 November 2005 to
shareholders on the register at close of business on 
7 October 2005. The ex-dividend date is 5 October 2005. 
Business overview
In the Vending Division (which has an unrivalled network
of 28,000 sites worldwide), operating profit improved
although turnover decreased by 2.4%.
Manufacturing turnover increased by 24.8% to 
£98.0m, representing 42% (2004: 36%) of total 
turnover. Manufacturing contributed the bulk of the 
pre-tax profit and its increase, benefiting from increased
volumes and higher margins following the transfer of
minilab manufacture to a sub-contractor in Poland in
January 2004.
Board
On 1 February 2005, Dan David retired as Chairman,
having fulfilled that role for the past 12 years. Mr David
continues as a non-executive director and has been
appointed Life President. 
Subsequent to the year end, on 1 June 2005, David
Scotland resigned as a non-executive director, having
made a valuable contribution during his four years in that
role. He is succeeded by Hugo Swire who brings to the
Board wide-ranging experience in business development
in international markets. 
Employees
On behalf of my fellow Directors, I would like to thank
PMI's employees, who number more than 1,600
worldwide, for their tremendous efforts in helping to
achieve another hugely successful year.
Prospects
In the current year, in Vending, both photobooths and
Digital Media Kiosks should continue to make a positive
contribution. In Manufacturing, another good
performance is expected. Overall, the Directors are
confident of further progress.
Further out, in Vending, photobooths will benefit from
changes in ID regulations in France and Japan, two of
PMI’s principal markets. Additionally, the roll-out of
Digital Media Kiosks is expected to contribute
significantly to Group performance. In Manufacturing, 
the DKS 3 minilab (which is the first digital minilab of 
the third generation) enhances the product range, whilst
the North American market represents a significant
opportunity. Overall, prospects for sustained profitable
growth remain good.

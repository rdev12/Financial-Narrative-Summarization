Who we are 
We are security and surveillance experts 
who create solutions for security and 
surveillance experts. Everything we do 
comes from a deep understanding of our 
customers and their needs. They know they 
can rely on us to listen to them and ensure 
that every solution is adapted exactly to 
meet their own set of challenges. 
What makes us tick 
We want our customers to have complete 
peace of mind, knowing that the people, 
assets and livelihoods that they are 
responsible for protecting are safe. 
We understand the pressures our 
customers face and we develop solutions 
they can absolutely depend on.
Where we operate
We work across four core sectors:
» Oil & Gas
» Gaming
» Transport & Infrastructure
» High Security & Public Space
Across three continents: 
» Europe
» Asia
» North America
Our global reach and expertise in different 
(yet highly compatible) core sectors has 
equipped us with a rich seam of transferable 
knowledge. This helps us to keep innovating 
in existing areas of expertise and gives us 
scope to move into new sectors where 
security and surveillance are also critical.
Our structure
Our business is split into two focussed 
divisions: Systems and Integration & 
Managed Services (‘IMS’).
Systems provides specialist electronic 
surveillance systems, based on its own 
proprietary technology, globally to end 
customers with large-scale and highly 
complex security requirements.
IMS focusses on delivering end-to-end, 
high integrity security and surveillance 
solutions, specialist mobile systems for 
transport operators, as well as service-led 
solutions for the management of facilities 
and security services.

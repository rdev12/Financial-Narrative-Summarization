Chairman’s statement
Positive results
Summary
Your Board is pleased to report another set 
of encouraging results for 2014. The profit 
after tax for the year of £1,043,000 shows a 
significant improvement on 2013 of £731,000 
and represents our best year to date. Net assets 
have increased to £10.5m from £9.8m at 
31 December 2013, a growth of 6.71%. 
The results were helped by an excellent result 
from the 2012 underwriting account of 13.01% 
on our net underwriting capacity of £21.1m 
compared to the 2011 account, which produced 
7.58% on underwriting capacity of £15.9m. 
Shareholders will note that the profit after 
tax is considerably greater than the previous 
year, but the operating profit was down by 
some 4%. This is largely due to negative 
goodwill emanating from our program of 
acquisitions which had a beneficial effect 
combined with increased operating costs 
(reduced for 2015). The Board recognises 
that it is important to grow and continues 
to explore various options. T o do so does 
inevitably increase costs, such as professional 
and advisers fees, which accounts for much 
of the reduced operating profit.
Following the precedent set last year we are 
once again reporting the Parent Company's 
adjusted net assets, plus the independent 
valuation of the Group's Limited Liability Vehicles 
as produced by Humphrey & Co, which is the 
market's primary provider of vendor valuations. 
This has increased to £1.72 per share from 
£1.64 per share (restated) in 2013, or total 
net assets of £14.7m (2013: £14.0m).
During 2014 we acquired four vehicles at 
acceptable prices and have made a further 
three purchases already this year with one 
more still to complete. These all should show 
satisfactory results on the open years of 
2013 and 2014.
Including the three new acquisitions in 2015, 
our gross premium income limit underwritten for 
the 2015 year of account is £23.0m compared 
to £25.6m for 2014, £23.9m for 2013 and 
£23.7m for 2012. The reduction is explained by 
the continuing programme of “quality control”, 
compulsory de-emptions and syndicate 
cessations. We continue with our strategy of 
reinsuring a significant portion of the youngest, 
least mature year, such that reinsurance has 
now risen to 70% from 50%. The gross 
premium figure nets down, after reinsurance, 
to £6.9m for 2015, £10.7m for 2014, £17.5m for 
2013 and £23.7m for 2012. However, we have 
a significant war chest which can be utilised to 
purchase more vehicles if they become available 
at reasonable prices. Should such purchases 
be achieved, the net underwriting figure will rise 
considerably on all accounts between now and 
the time they come to close.
The Board considers that the risks attaching 
to the open accounts of 2014 and prior are 
sufficiently well developed that no further 
protection is required. However, the market 
remains very competitive and we continue to 
take advantage of the availability of reasonably 
priced stop loss reinsurance to mitigate any 
losses that may arise on the 2015 account.
Following a successful year the Board is pleased 
to recommend a final dividend of 1.5p per share 
together with a special dividend of 3.6p per 
share payable to all shareholders on the register 
at 5 June 2015. In aggregate these amount 
to a total of £457,000, compared to £384,000 
in 2014. Furthermore the Board also intends to 
put in place a Scrip Dividend Scheme to give 
shareholders the opportunity to elect to receive 
dividends in the form of new ordinary shares 
instead of cash and an appropriate resolution 
will be proposed at the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting to give the Board the requisite authority. 
The terms and conditions of the proposed Scrip 
Dividend Scheme will be set out in a circular 
to be sent to shareholders shortly.
If approved the dividend will be made in a single 
payment or share issue on 3 July 2015.

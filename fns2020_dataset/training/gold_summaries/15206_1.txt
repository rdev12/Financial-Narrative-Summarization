Chief Executive’s review
I am pleased to report that in the year under review we 
successfully achieved many important changes for the 
business, in several fundamental areas. 
Our long-term business strategy is 
working, and the foundations established 
for a more rapid and stronger 
performance going forward. 
The business has continued to diversify 
into synergistic products, technical 
services and applications. For d
2
w our 
main revenue generating brand, a robust 
investment programme has been 
maintained which is helping to drive  
the business forward with expanding 
opportunities, markets and sales.  
Overall, product cost reduced and 
volumes increased.
Our d
2
p and d
2
t technologies are still  
in their infancy albeit some sales have 
resulted for d
2
p. We have maintained our 
investment programme which is based 
on several J/V projects with prospective  
end user customers. SEL has absorbed 
the cost for creating new IP formulations 
as well for work with independent 
laboratories and universities. These two 
technologies are synergistic with d
2
w  
as they can be supplied to the same 
customer base through the same 
distribution network, and therefore 
commercialisation is expected to be 
more rapid. 
The results for 2013 show an improved 
financial performance, with increasing 
revenues, higher margins and a lower 
overhead cost base. In addition, the main 
business drivers continued to improve, 
such as legislation, distributor-
performance and product expansion and 
improvement. A growing number of 
important opportunities, negotiations 
and product trials have commenced or 
continued in the period under review.
These opportunities extend across 
much of our global distribution  
network, and include the d
2
p, d
2
t  
and d
2
w product ranges.
Investment continued into the tyre 
recycling division, and opportunities for 
the commercial development phase 
moved further forward.
Our business model has been about 
investing for the future, and aiming for 
more than ordinary performance.

Trading results
Total Group revenues were higher at 
£7.19 million (2012: £4.94 million), and 
Group gross profit margins increased 
from 44% to 49%. These factors resulted 
in a 65% increase in the contribution from 
gross profit from £2.15 million in 2012 to 
£3.55 million in 2013. Gross margins were 
increased due to efficiencies and cost 
reductions in the supply chain.
Sales to the Americas increased from 
£2.11 million in 2012 to £3.41 million in 
2013 and represented 47% of 2013 
revenues (2012: 43%). Sales to UK and 
Europe increased from £1.38 million in 
2012 to £1.50 million in 2013 and 
represented 21% of 2013 revenues (2012: 
28%). Sales to the Rest of the World 
increased from £1.45 million in 2012 to 
£2.29 million in 2013 and represented 
32% of 2013 revenues (2012: 29%). 
Overheads before non-recurring items 
decreased by 16% to £3.53 million (2012: 
£4.21 million) which included a net 
write-back of provisions against 
receivables of £0.05 million (2012: 
provision of £0.39 million). Total staff 
costs were marginally lower at £2.01 
million (2012: £2.16 million).
In addition to these expenses, the Group 
incurred non-recurring costs of £570,000 
(2012: £nil). Of these costs £76,000 relate 
to expenditure to obtain ongoing cost 
efficiencies. This included closing down 
one of its UK facilities with the operation 
being transferred to Head Office. As 
mentioned above, £494,000 is an 
impairment provision against capitalised 
development costs for SRT and is 
detailed later in my review. 
Including the non-recurring items, the 
Group made an operating loss of £0.73 
million in 2013 compared to an operating 
loss of £2.18 million in 2012. This resulted 
in loss before tax of £0.78 million in 2013 
compared with a loss before tax of £2.20 
million in 2012. 
Excluding the non-recurring items, the 
Group made an EBITDA loss of £10,000 
(2012: loss £2.02 million) and an operating 
loss of £159,000 (2012: loss £2.18 million).
The Group reports a loss for the year  
of £0.71 million (2012: loss £2.22 million) 
with basic loss per share of 0.55 pence 
(2012: loss per share 1.74 pence). 
The business invests in scientific and 
technical excellence, and I believe that 
Symphony is now not only the market-
leader but also the technical leader of the 
industry. Development costs of £0.12 
million were capitalised in 2013 (2012: 
£0.36 million), and the net book value of 
capitalised development costs at the end 
of the year amounted to £0.91 million. 
Further development expenditure of 
£0.38 million (2012: £0.32 million) was 
charged directly to profit and loss. 
Capitalised development costs represent 
4% of expenses as detailed above.  
Within the total amount of £0.91 million 
capitalised to date, and less amortisation 
and impairment, are: £0.19 million relating 
to d
2
w products which have been 
developed and are being sold; and the 
balance of £0.72 million, relating to 
further environmental plastic applications 
still in development and where we believe 
significant revenues will be generated in 
the foreseeable future. As stated earlier, 
£0.49 million of capitalised development 
costs relating to SRT was impaired.
The Group’s primary selling currency is 
the US Dollar. The Group self-hedges 
where possible by purchasing in US 
Dollars and has banking facilities in place 
in order to secure rates going forward. As 
at 31 December 2013 the Group had a net 
balance of US Dollar assets totalling 
$0.56 million (2012: $0.32 million). 
Segmental analysis
The Group operates two business 
divisions which are classified as 
segments in the financial report, being 
the Plastics Division (Symphony 
Environmental Limited or “SEL ”) and  
the Recycling Technologies division 
(Symphony Recycling Limited or “SRT”). 
SEL includes d
2
w, d
2
p, d
2
t, and the 
d
2
Detector, be they additives or finished 
products. SEL, which currently generates 
all the Group revenues, saw sales 
increase by 46% during the year with 
total revenues increasing to £7.19 million 
(2012: £4.94 million) due to growth in new 
and established markets. This, together 
with the rise in gross margins and the 
reduction in overheads, resulted in an 
EBITDA profit of £0.22 million in 2013 
compared to a loss of £1.75 million in 2012. 
Within SEL no sales were made for d
2
t,  
but there were small initial sales for d
2
p.
SRT has no revenues to date and incurred 
expenditure of £0.81 million for the year, 
resulting in an EBITDA loss of the same 
amount (2012 expenditure and EBITDA 
loss: £0.27 million). 10 Symphony Environmental T echnologies plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Cashflow
The Group consumed £0.81 million  
from operations (2012: cash generated 
£0.45 million). This was due to higher 
receivables at the 2013 year-end 
resulting from increased sales, and a 
reduction in payables. The Group has a  
£1 million trade finance facility with HSBC 
Bank plc of which £0.58 million was drawn 
down as at 31 December 2013 (£0.22 
million as at 31 December 2012). The 
invoice-finance facility increased in line 
with receivables. In addition to these 
facilities, the Group borrowed a further 
£650,000 through unsecured loans.
The Group had cash in the bank of 
£130,000 at the year-end (2012: 
£336,000), plus trade receivables of £1.16 
million (2012: £545,000) and continues to 
work comfortably within its facilities.
Symphony Recycling Technologies
As previously stated, the Board’s 
strategy is to commercialise SRT. Having 
carefully considered the options, the 
initial steps will be to establish a newly 
incorporated company with a third-party 
into which the Group will inject the 
business of SRT through a licence 
agreement. The newly incorporated 
company will seek additional third-party 
financing and operate autonomously 
from the Group. As SRT will no longer 
form an integral part of the Group, a full 
impairment charge of £494,000 has been 
made which reflects the costs incurred  
to develop the recycling business to this 
stage. The Group will retain an interest as 
a minority shareholder in the new entity 
and as IP Licensor, from which it is 
expected that the Group will benefit 
going forward.
Outlook
In particular we have been notified of  
a new contract award through one of  
our distributors for d
2
w from a major 
supermarket group. The volumes 
indicated, but not yet verified, are 
significant. The delivery programme 
starts from April, with full roll-out before 
the 2014 year-end. This follows more than 
two years of development work which 
demonstrates the length of time it can 
take to close a major sale opportunity. 
In addition to the above, several other 
trials for d
2
w are in their final phase, and 
further updates will be communicated to 
the market in due course.
Positive changes in legislation are driving 
momentum for d
2
w in several markets, 
albeit timing and volumes are still 
unknown, but what is known is that our 
sales outlets continue to expand in 
number and volume.
Trials and negotiations for d
2
p and d
2
t are 
showing favourable results on several 
fronts and we have high expectations of 
seeing initial revenues commence over 
the next year. d
2
t is a suite of tagging and 
tracing technologies which will assist 
brand-owners and governments to 
reduce counterfeiting of products.
We believe that 2014 will show a further 
strengthening of our operating 
performance, and we look forward  
to the year ahead with confidence.

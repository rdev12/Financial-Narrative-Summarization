Health, Safety and Environmental Policies

expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue

reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders will find on pages 91 to 96 the notice of the
forthcoming annual general meeting of the company to be 
held on 10 May 2006. 
In addition to the ordinary business of the meeting, three
resolutions (numbered 6 to 8) are proposed as special business. 20 Directors’ Report
Authority of Directors to Allot Shares
Resolutions 6 and 7 are similar to the authorities given to the
directors at the last annual general meeting of the company.
By law, directors are not permitted to allot new shares (or to
grant rights over shares) unless authorised to do so by
shareholders. In addition, directors require specific authority
from shareholders before allotting new shares (or rights in respect
of shares) for cash without first offering them to existing
shareholders in proportion to their holdings.
Resolution 6 gives the directors the necessary authority for the
period of five years from the date of the passing of such resolution
to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £449,234
(being equal to approximately one-third of the issued share capital
of the company). 
Resolution 7 empowers the directors, for the period of five
years from the date of the passing of such resolution, to 
allot shares for cash otherwise than to existing shareholders on a
pro-rata basis, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £67,385,
which is the equivalent of 5% of the issued share capital of the
company. It also enables the directors, in the case of an issue by
way of rights, to deal with fractional entitlements and to make
such exclusions or other arrangements as may be appropriate to
resolve legal, regulatory or practical problems which might arise,
particularly with regard to overseas shareholders.
It is intended that these authorities and powers are renewed at
successive annual general meetings.
There is no present intention of issuing any ordinary shares,
except perhaps in connection with the company’s share 
option scheme. As at 23 March 2006 the company holds no equity
securities in treasury.
Purchase of Own Shares
Resolution 8 renews the authority for the company to make
market purchases (within the meaning of section 163 of 
the Companies Act 1985) on the London Stock Exchange up to an
aggregate of 2,695,405 ordinary shares (equivalent to 10% of the
issued share capital of the company) at a minimum price per
ordinary share of 5p and a maximum of 105% of the average of
the middle market quotations of the ordinary shares as derived

Annual Report & Accounts 2005 21
from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five
business days immediately preceding the day on which that
ordinary share is contracted to be purchased. This proposal
should not be taken as an indication that the company will
purchase shares at any particular price or indeed at all, and the
directors will only consider making purchases if they believe that
such purchases would result in an increase in earnings per share
and are in the best interests of the shareholders.
The authority will expire at the conclusion of the next annual
general meeting of the company, or, if earlier, the expiry 
of 15 months from the date of the passing of such resolution.
It is intended to renew this authority and power at successive
annual general meetings.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the company’s
auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general
meeting.
Approved by the board of directors and signed on behalf of the
board.

Corporate Governance
THE DIRECTORS SUPPORT The Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued in July 2003 (the ‘Combined Code’). 
The board sets out its report on how the Group has applied the
principles and whether it has complied with the Combined Code
during the year.
Application of the Principles 
Directors
The board is responsible for the Group’s strategic direction, and its
operating and financial performance. The board comprised three
executive and two independent non-executive directors, all of
whom met on eight occasions in 2005, following a formal agenda. 
Directors’ biographies are given on page 4.
The separate roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are clearly
defined. The Chairman conducts board and shareholder meetings
and ensures that all directors are properly briefed. The Chief
Executive is responsible for developing and co-ordinating the
business and implementing Group strategy.
There is an agreed procedure for the directors to take
independent professional advice at the company’s expense, 
to have access to the Company Secretary and receive appropriate
training where necessary, including an induction on appointment.
All directors are required to retire by rotation at least every
three years when they can offer themselves for re-election if
eligible.
All members of the remuneration and nominations committee
met once during 2005. They monitor, review and make
recommendations to the board on all elements of the
remuneration and performance of the directors of the company.
They also consider the award of options under the company share
option plan and make recommendations to the board in respect of

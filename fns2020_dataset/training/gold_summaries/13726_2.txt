Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 01   
Operational highlights 
Oil production in 2014 averaged 3,523 barrels per day (bpd), a 14% decrease 
compared with 2013. In January 2014, suspended production of gas and condensate 
in the Palyanovo field primarily to conserve gas while we engage in discussions to 
commercialise these gas reserves.
The production performance of the Group’s first two horizontal wells was 
encouraging (10-day flow tests averaged 1,350 and 900 bpd for wells 214 and 251, 
respectively) 
• Spudded our first multiple fractured horizontal well (214) (MFHW) in April 2014. 
• In our second well (251), introduced for the first time in Russia innovative 
completion technology customised to our geological environment.
Successful focus on safety in our operations including implementation of the EMEX 
system to manage HSE performance. One minor lost-time injury in 2014.
Extended the subsoil licence for the Vostochno-Inginsky (“VI”) block until 2034.
 
Financial highlights 
Successful completion of financial restructuring in December 2014 (“the 
Restructuring”). As a result, US$52.3 million of new equity was raised, US$358.1 
million of existing debt and put option obligations were refinanced through a 
US$150 million loan with Bank Otkritie Financial Corporation (“Otkritie”), with the 
remaining US$208.1 million converted into a 25% equity position held by Mastin 
Holdings Limited (“Mastin”).
Revenues of US$55.1 million (down 31% Y-o-Y) due primarily to a 26% decline in 
liquids production, and a 9% decline in the realized oil price Y-o-Y.
Full year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)  
of US$9.5 million vs. US$13.0 million in 2013, driven mostly by the decline in 
production, and oil price, partially offset by Mineral extraction tax (“MET”)  
relief from September 2013. EBITDA per barrel of liquids was US$7.4 in both 2013 
and 2014.
Strengthened our partnership with Glencore by extending our export prepayment 
facility in March 2014 and entering into two domestic facilities in May 2014 and 
October 2014.
Net debt decreased by US$152.3 million from US$387.4 million at the beginning of 
the year to US$235.1 million at the end of 2014.
Net loss of US$262.9 million vs. net loss of US$74.2 million in 2013, driven mostly by 
the foreign exchange loss on US dollar denominated loans to the Group’s Russian 
subsidiaries (US$202.4 million).

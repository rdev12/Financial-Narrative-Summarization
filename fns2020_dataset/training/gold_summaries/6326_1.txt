Chief Executive 7 Future: Annual Report 2004
Introduction
This has been an important period 
of growth for Future – but not nearly 
as important as the growth we are
planning for the next four years. We
are focused on growing the business 
to enhance shareholder value. Our
target is to double the sales and profits
of the business. We have the strategy,
financial capability, management
strength and corporate desire 
to achieve that end.
Growth plan
Since 2001, Future’ s business has
grown from £143m revenues and £10m
of adjusted operating profit to £190.4m
and £23.6m for the year to September
2004. In less than four years, Future’ s
revenues have thus grown 33% and
profits 136%. This profit growth has
been achieved largely organically. 
The cumulative spend on acquisitions
during this period has been £22.4m,
with revenues of £20.8m and profits 
of £2.4m coming in the year to
September 2004. These acquisitions
have been funded entirely through
cash flow. The sum total of net launch
spend within each of the years 2001
to date is just £1.4m.
This strong growth places Future
amongst the fastest-growing UK media
companies during the period – and
without spending any ‘new’ money.
Given this track record, our strategic
focus and our stated intention to use
debt to help drive growth in our
business, we are confident that our
four-year growth target is achievable.
In making this commitment,
we would also draw attention to the
great strength, quality and discipline
of our Board. Future has generated 
a reputation in recent years for its
ability to judge risk carefully, and we
stress that this will continue to underpin
how we evaluate opportunities.
The only caveat is that a strategy
which is in part based on acquisition
is also inherently based on opportunity
and availability of assets at sensible
prices. Attractive assets are available
and we believe will continue to be.
2004 performance
The year to September 2004 
saw Future continuing to grow both 
in terms of magazine sectors and
internationally. In constant currency,
revenues grew 11%, adjusted
operating profits 6% and adjusted
earnings per share by 17%. 
That growth has come through a
combination of organic development,
launches and acquisitions. Though 
we break out the figures for clarity,
we stress that operationally each
route to growth is important to 
us, whether driven by our creative 
ability with launches, redesigns 
and existing magazines; or by 
our financial firepower for portfolio
development, new magazines 
and acquisitions.
We continue to diversify Future. 
By subject matter and by revenue,
our business is now split: games 44%
(2003: 47%); computing 30% (32%)
and the 15-sector entertainment 26%
(21%). Geographically by revenue,
Future’ s shape is: UK 52% (2003:
56%); US 27% (24%) and Mainland
Europe 21% (20%).
This gives increasing evidence of the
great flexibility of our Company. We
have sector-leading titles in an array 
of subject areas and countries,
whether that’s the biggest-selling
guitar magazines in the US, or the
leaders in French Internet titles,
or the best-selling mountain bike
magazine in the UK, or the leader 
in Italian PC games magazines.

3 Chief Executive’s review 
continued
Almost uniquely among UK consumer
magazine companies, over 50% of 
our revenues come from overseas
(including UK exports). Future has
demonstrated its ability to succeed 
in different countries. Future is the
UK’s leading magazine content
licensor; we now have 107 licensed
editions in 30 countries.
In terms of expansion, the shape 
of our business underpins Future’s 
ability to seek out new opportunities –
whether by country (such as the US,
in recent times for us) or by sector
(such as in games – revenues up 56%
in three years). We see growth drivers
and growth opportunities across 
the business.
Future’s businesses
Future’ s four operations in the 
UK, US, France and Italy are run 
by experienced managers. Our four
Managing Directors collectively have
32 years working at Future.
This continuity has shown benefit. 
We have experienced, knowledgeable,
driven leaders of our businesses. They
know their companies and markets,
and have clear growth plans.
In the UK, Robert Price was appointed
as MD in March, having previously
been Publishing Director of our largest
division, Entertainment. Robert’ s brief
was to galvanise the UK business,
which has been strong in terms 
of margin but sluggish on growth. 
He is being encouragingly vigorous. 
We have a largely-new and highly
effective operating Board in the 
UK; the existing portfolio is being
overhauled and reinvigorated; active
launching has recommenced; a new
magazine distributor, Marketforce,
is now handling our portfolio, and there
have been four acquisitions since
Robert’ s appointment. 
The impact of all these initiatives 
has already begun to have some effect
and Future UK is well placed to deliver
double-digit growth in the coming year.
The US has continued to thrive under
Jonathan Simpson-Bint’ s leadership.
Through organic growth, launches 
and the full-year effect of our guitar
acquisitions, in dollar terms revenue
has been driven up 34% in the year – 
a very significant rise in an otherwise
quiet year in US media. Profit has
been impacted by the launch costs 
of Mobile PC ($2.9m) and also
establishing a publishing base for 
our music-making titles in New Y ork.

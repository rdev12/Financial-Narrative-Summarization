 Chairman’s letter 
Dear shareholders, 
In 2013 your company was focused on improving the performance of the  
business, strengthening capital allocation processes and reducing our level of 
indebtedness – all with a view to ensuring a greater commitment to creating 
real value for shareholders.  
I am pleased to report that substantial progress had been made on meeting 
these priorities. We achieved underlying earnings of US$10.2 billion and 
significantly improved cash flow by 22 per cent over 2012. We exceeded  
our cost reduction targets and set production records. Our net earnings 
performance of US$3.7 billion takes account of non-cash exchange rate losses 
and impairments.  
We are deeply saddened by the deaths of three of our employees at our 
managed sites last year and improving safety at all of our operations during  
the year ahead is of paramount importance. 
Our overall performance gave the board the confidence to raise the 2013 full 
year dividend by 15 per cent. This increased dividend represents an important 
milestone on the road to improved shareholder value. 
Stronger business, creating options  
During 2013 greater discipline and accountability was restored throughout  
the business, particularly in the allocation and management of capital.  
We simplified and strengthened our systems in this area and improved  
decision-making capability across the organisation.  
Your board regularly evaluates opportunities put forward by the business 
against all competing uses for cash, striving to achieve the right balance 
between disciplined investment, strengthening our balance sheet and  
returning cash to investors. 
The reduction in our net debt during 2013 is an indication of our commitment 
to a stronger balance sheet and provides flexibility in terms of returns and 
investment. We are building more resilience in our business, which gives  
your board greater flexibility to respond to macroeconomic developments  
as they arise. 
Strategy development and disciplined delivery 
During the year your board supported Sam Walsh on the implementation of his 
plan to improve performance, strengthen the balance sheet and deliver results. 
We worked with him on reviewing the company’s strategy and reaffirmed our 
commitment to invest in and operate long-life, low-cost, expandable mines  
and businesses. The board also took the time to visit our world-class iron ore 
operations in the Pilbara in Western Australia to get a deeper understanding  
of the strategic and operational issues at play. 
Sam, his executive team, and all of our 66,000 employees across the world have 
worked hard during a challenging year and made a large contribution to restore 
the company to a position of strength. I thank all of our people for their efforts 
and commend Sam for this leadership during a tough time. But there is more 
we must do. 
Amidst continued market uncertainty, impacts of quantitative easing  
and austerity programmes still washing through markets around the world, 
your board has tasked the executive team with ensuring they successfully 
execute our strategy and make sure the gains delivered are sustained. The 
discipline of 2013 must be carried forward into the year ahead and beyond,  
with a specific focus on delivering our growth projects and producing further 
productivity improvements at all of our sites. 
As geopolitical and social risk increase, we remain convinced that businesses 
which form effective relationships and partnerships around the world will 
prosper over the longer term. Rio Tinto has always taken its role as a 
responsible business very seriously and throughout the year ahead we will 
continue to build our capabilities in stakeholder engagement and sustainable 
development. We believe earning the trust of our host communities and 
governments is vital in creating sustainable shareholder value.  
Maintaining good governance 
Good governance is essential for the long-term success of the Group. In 2013, 
we have seen a greater level of focus, discipline and accountability throughout 
the organisation. This continues to be underpinned by your board’s oversight  
of a robust corporate governance framework to support our business and 
strategic delivery.  
My role as chairman is to lead the board and to ensure it is focused on its 
oversight of management and the delivery of our strategy. Sam Walsh’s role  
as chief executive is to focus on sustained operational excellence and growth  
of the business – and to do so with safety top of mind. Our roles are 
complementary but distinct. The separation of executive and non-executive 
accountabilities is essential to good governance: the executives have an 
operational role, whereas the non-executives have an oversight role, ensuring 
accountability and exercising strong and deliberate challenge through the 
board decision-making process to ensure appropriate control mechanisms  
are in place to safely implement our strategy and plans.  
Your board devotes much of its time to reviewing, debating and challenging 
proposals for investment from management, as well as dealing with a wide 
range of other issues including safety and the Group’s strategic direction, 
monitoring business performance, optimising capital allocation and expenditure 
whilst carefully evaluating the wide range of risks facing the business.  
Leadership 
Leadership is critical at all levels – at board level, at executive level, and 
throughout the business. We are committed to effective succession planning  
at both the board and executive level. My goal is to make sure your board 
combines the diverse blend of skills and international experience that is 
available to it now and to enhance it further for the future. Rio Tinto’s board 
should have the best blend of appropriately skilled and experienced people 
from our industry, but also outside of it.  
2013 saw a number of changes to the executive team, starting with the 
appointment of Sam Walsh as chief executive. Following Guy Elliott’s decision 
to retire at the end of 2013, your board appointed Chris Lynch as chief financial 
officer with effect from April 2013. The board announced the promotion of  
Jean-Sébastien Jacques as chief executive, Copper, following Andrew Harding’s 
move to become chief executive, Iron Ore and appointed Greg Lilleyman as 
Group executive, Technology & Innovation with effect from 1 January 2014, 
following the retirement of Preston Chiaro from the Executive Committee  
at the end of 2013. 
Preston retires as an executive on 1 April 2014. I would like to thank  
Guy and Preston for their significant contributions to Rio Tinto over their many 
years with the Group and we wish them well in their retirement as executives. 
Moving forward, I am very pleased to announce today the appointment of  
two new non-executive directors. Anne Lauvergeon and Simon Thompson will 
bring a wealth of experience to your board given their combined experience  
in a number of leading international businesses. We also announced today  
that Vivienne Cox will stand down at the end of the annual general meeting  
in London in April, after nine years on the board. I would like to thank Vivienne 
for her significant contribution to Rio Tinto over this time and wish her well  
for the future. 
We are a balanced and diverse board, comprising myself as chairman, two 
executive directors and eight (soon to be nine after the new appointments and 
Vivienne Cox’s retirement) independent non-executive directors, all of whom 
are rigorously assessed to ensure they continue to meet strict independence 
criteria. The directors bring with them truly international experience from a  
wide range of professional, business and public office backgrounds.

demand-led businesses, which include mining, refining and marketing 
operations across four sectors. Rio Tinto Diamonds is one of the world’s leading 
diamond producers, active in mining, manufacturing, selling, and marketing 
diamonds. Rio Tinto Minerals is a world leader in borates, with mines, 
processing plants, and commercial and research facilities. Dampier Salt is one 
of the world’s largest producers of seaborne salt. Rio Tinto Iron & Titanium is  
an industry leader in high-grade titanium dioxide feedstocks. The Diamonds & 
Minerals group also includes the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, one of 
the largest known undeveloped high-grade iron ore resources in the world. 
Products 
Diamonds 
Diamonds are an important component in both affordable and higher-end 
jewellery. We are able to service both established and emerging markets  
as we produce the full range of diamonds in terms of size, quality and  
colour distribution. 
Titanium dioxide 
The minerals ilmenite and rutile, together with titanium dioxide slag, can  
be transformed into a white titanium dioxide pigment or titanium metal.  
The white pigment is a key component in paints, plastics, paper, inks, textiles, 
food, sunscreen and cosmetics. Titanium metal’s key properties of light  
weight, chemical inertness and high strength make it ideal for use in medical 
applications and in the aerospace industry. 
Borates 
Refined borates are used in hundreds of products and processes. They are  
a vital ingredient of many home and automotive applications, and are  
essential nutrients for crops. They are commonly used in glass and ceramic  
applications including fibreglass, television screens, floor and wall tiles,  
and heat-resistant glass. 
Salt 
Salt is one of the basic raw materials for the chemicals industry and is 
indispensable to a wide array of automotive, construction and electronic 
products, as well as for water treatment, food and healthcare. 
Other products include high purity iron, metal powders and zircon.

Rio Tinto’s Energy product group is a leading seaborne supplier of thermal  
and coking coal to Asian customers and the uranium we produce is used  
by electricity providers worldwide. We have operations, exploration and 
development projects in Australia, Namibia, Mozambique and Canada. 
Products 
Coal 
Coal is abundant, relatively inexpensive, and safe and easy to transport. We are 
a large supplier to the seaborne thermal coal market. Thermal coal is used for 
electricity generation in power stations. We also produce higher-value coking or 
metallurgical coal which, when mixed in furnaces with iron ore, produces steel. 
Uranium 
Uranium is one of the most powerful known natural energy sources, and is  
used in the production of clean, stable, base-load electricity. After uranium  
ore is mined, it is milled into uranium oxide – the mine product that is sold  
for processing into fuel rods for use in nuclear power stations. 
Strategic advantages 
Strong customer relationships and high-quality assets located in close 
proximity to growing Asian markets. 
Successfully transforming the business by reducing costs, increasing 
productivity and improving our position on the cost curve. 
A large and unique resource base of premium quality thermal and  
coking coal in Australia, located close to existing infrastructure, which  
would be difficult to replicate.

Proximity of the expanded Pilbara operations in Australia to the world’s 
largest and fastest-growing customer base. 
Success in increasing operational efficiency and controlling costs. 
Vast potential for brownfield developments near existing infrastructure. 
Proven success in implementing large-scale and complex, value-generating 
major projects on time and budget without significant impact on  
operational efficiency.

“… we have achieved our objectives to reduce
costs and improve operational gearing, and continue
to gain market share that will consolidate our 
pan-European strategic position”.
The year under review has seen the longest
and most severe downturn in the history
of the electronic component business.
Consequently, the industry has seen
much downsizing and retrenchment.
However, I am very pleased that we have
made substantial progress in reshaping
and developing the Group in these
challenging times.We have achieved our
objectives to reduce costs, improve
operational gearing, and continue to gain
market share that will consolidate our
pan-European strategic position. We are
now in a good position to maximise the
benefits, both in terms of sales and
profitability, as and when the market
improves. 
The strategy to achieve these objectives
has four elements - to improve both our
customer and supplier relationship,
driving operational excellence, and most
importantly retaining, developing, and
attracting talented people.
Customer Relationships
Our aim to become closer to our chosen
customers continues to be successful.
Third party analysis* shows that in
calendar year 2001 Eurodis gained
market share against calendar 2000.
Pleasingly, indications are that this trend
has accelerated in 2002.
Customer segmentation is central to both
our customer service philosophy and our
sales programmes. The split of sales
between the various customer segments
was similar to last year. We anticipate that
local key and OEM (Original Equipment
Manufacturer) customers will continue 
to represent over 50% of our business 
in future. However, we will focus on
delivering further growth in large pan-
European EMS (Electronic Manufacturing
Services) customers and pan-European
OEM customers. 
They gain real benefit from our ability 
to offer a co-ordinated single point of
contact with our Global Alliance and 
our ability to ship products throughout
Europe, via a common European system.
In terms of geographical sales split, 
we have higher market shares in most 
of the smaller and medium sized
countries. In future, we expect much of
our market share gains to come from the
three largest markets; Germany, the UK
and France. We have put in place new
management, new sales teams and
incentives to achieve this.
A part of the cost reduction programme
has been to create locally focused sales
and marketing organisations in each
country, delivering all non-customer
facing services through regional or central
structures. I see this as vital in driving
more sales and continuing our trend of
gaining market share.
Demand creation is a key differentiator 
to Eurodis. T o develop this further we
have created the Advanced T echnology
Centre concept. These have been
brought on line in the last two years 
and cover display technology, wireless
communication and, most recently,
embedded solutions.
The Wireless T echnology Centre has 
been in place for over a year. It is 
working well with over 400 identified
design-in projects across Europe,
covering RF-ID, Bluetooth, Short
Distance Radio and GSM applications.
An increasing number of these projects
address the security market.

Supplier Relationships
The suppliers that form our key franchises
have a very strong influence on the
customer base we serve and the industry
in general. 
Going forward we have rationalised our
supplier focus to 27 key franchises
covering all technologies; Semiconductors,
Passives, Electro-Mechanical, Crystals,
Power Supplies and LCDs. Coupled
with this we have approximately 100
complementary suppliers that either fill in
technology gaps or offer the potential of
becoming pan-European lines in future.
This provides us with a portfolio that is
sufficiently narrow for us to focus and
drive efficiency but broad enough to be
attractive to our customers. 
As a result of this supplier rationalisation
during the current year we will assess and
possibly terminate some 200 suppliers
which no longer fit this strategy. This is a
more radical approach than we previously
anticipated. However, their turnover,
which is not significant, will be largely
transferred to our key lines.
Forming close, mutually profitable and
long-term relationships with a selected
number of suppliers is essential to the
Group’ s drive for efficiency and gains 
in market share. During the year we
increased our share of the total
distribution sales of our key lines thereby
strengthening those relationships.
This was demonstrated by the 
granting of several key franchises to 
our Iberian business which we launched
in January of this year. They include 
ST , Philips, T oshiba, AVX, Bourns and 
BC Components. T aken in conjunction 
with the new franchises obtained for 
our recently acquired Nordic business,
this is a good illustration of one of the
advantages of our pan-European strategy .
Our unique concept of franchise 
centres that handle purchasing, supplier
management and administration has
been very popular with our suppliers.
They are located throughout Europe so
that they can benefit from cultural and
regional variations. Solutions are tailored
to a particular supplier, whilst operating
cost effectively through our integrated
purchasing infrastructure. 
Operational Excellence
Achieving operational excellence means
creating an integrated infrastructure that
consistently delivers world class service 
at a low fixed cost. 
A key initiative has been the acceleration
of our central purchasing programme. 
In November 2001 we purchased
approximately 50% of all inventory
centrally. We now purchase all products
centrally. This has helped in expense
reduction and has had an immediately
positive impact on inventory turns. We
expect that consolidation of purchasing
will also bring margin improvements in 
the future.
The commissioning of our new logistics
and warehouse facility in the Netherlands
has been completed. It came on line in
July this year as expected and is working
well. After the closure of eight other
European warehouses by March 2003, 
it will become our single logistics facility.
The 17,000 square metre facility employs
the latest Goods to Man warehousing
concept, with three kilometres of
mechanical conveyors, 100,000 bin
storage locations, 16 robotic cranes, all
managed by state of the art specialist
warehousing IT . It will deliver significant
improvements in efficiency. For example,
in May 2001 our warehouses employed
226 staff, by May 2003 this will have
dropped to approximately 90.
The new centre will also provide a higher 
and more flexible level of service to 
our customers.
On 1 April 2002 we successfully
integrated our Nordic business onto 
our common IT platform, bringing all
companies onto the one system.
Coupled with this we have implemented
our OneWay programme of standard
business processes into the Nordic
business. This drives operational
efficiency through all end to end
processes. It also means we can 
provide a common interface to
customers who purchase in Europe 
from multiple locations.
Eurodis has established a solid
foundation for eCommerce related
trading with both key franchise suppliers
and customers, and also with Deutsche
Post leading to effective delivery track 
and trace capability. The Rossettanet™
standard has been adopted as the
technology cornerstone for this activity
and in March 2002 Eurodis was the first
distributor to sign a Rossettanet™
agreement with STMicroelectronics. In
essence, eCommerce represents the
‘golden thread’ for service and efficiency
running through our demand and supply
chain and is the basis for many of the
Eurodis value added service offerings 
going forward.
Eurodis can supply and technically support 
at least 75% of the component value of this
product. We sell the components to our
customers who then manufacture the end
product and sell it on to the end user. 
Everyone uses components every day! Our
customers manufacture air conditioning,
satellite boxes, alarm systems, stereos,
PDA’s, bar coding equipment, vending
machines and many other items. 10

Our aim to become closer to our chosen customers
continues to be successful.
Cost Reduction
Over 70% of costs in distribution are
people. Unfortunately this has meant 
we have had to reduce the workforce 
in response to market conditions. In our
components business, employees have
reduced from 1,278 in May 2001 to
1,074 in May 2002. In the first half of
2003 that workforce will fall further to 
a level below 1,000. This will represent 
a reduction of nearly a quarter of our
workforce in two years. 
Over two thirds of the reductions have
come from non customer facing staff
resulting from our restructuring of
purchasing, marketing, warehousing 
and finance functions. We have also
worked hard to improve the quality and
productivity of our sales organisations 
to minimise reductions in that area.
Following the warehouse closures, we
believe that we will have an organisation
that is appropriately sized for the current
conditions, and that is able to take
advantage of opportunities as the 
market improves.
People 
Despite the restructuring, we have 
been able to attract and retain high 
quality personnel who are enthused by
the significant opportunity Eurodis
presents. We will continue to invest in 
the development of our people, to
achieve our aim of developing a culture
that is determined, customer orientated, 
cohesive and passionate about the 
Eurodis message. Jeremy Webster, our 
VP of Human Resources, who started 
a year ago, came into a newly created
function. Since that time we have
launched an improved communication
programme with our employees and put
in place a standard appraisal system.
Also, we have started a programme 
of training in each country (called 
Regional Eurodis Colleges) that will
provide employees at all levels a clear
understanding of the Eurodis 
philosophy, and the value we provide 
to our customers and suppliers. 
Further developments are planned in 
the training of our sales teams and
development of our key managers. 
We will only achieve our marketing and
financial goals by developing, retaining
and inspiring our best people. The
teamwork and individual efforts I have
witnessed recently makes me believe 
that we are on our way to creating a 
truly world class team. I would like to
thank them for their outstanding efforts 
in a difficult market. I am very proud to
work with them all.
Summary
Over the last few years, the Eurodis
management has focused on taking
a group of different companies and
integrating them into a pan-European 
unit with shared practices and a 
cohesive customer and supplier strategy
in all countries. Our focus for the future 
will shift.
Having completed the final stages of
restructuring, we will move onto
developing and delivering improved value
and services to our customers. By doing
this we will continue to grow our market
share and consolidate our position as 
the number three electronic component
distributor in Europe. 
Although we have recently experienced 
a severe downturn, I remain confident of
the long-term demand for technology, 
the increasingly important role that
distribution will play in the supply chain
and that the market will return to its
previous growth rates. This, coupled 
with the progress we have made on the
cost base over the last year, and the
talent we have both retained and gained,
creates a more profitable business 
model for the future.

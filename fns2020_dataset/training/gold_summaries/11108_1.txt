CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
OVERVIEW
NEXT has had a good year, achieving 3.1% growth in sales and 9.0% growth in underlying profit before tax.  Strong 
cash generation allowed us to buy back 4.5% of shares outstanding which, along with a lower tax rate, resulted in 
EPS growing much faster than profits.  
In the year to January 2013 post-tax EPS grew by 16.6%.  Our full year dividend has been increased in line with EPS 
to 105p.

Five straightforward profit drivers
The table below sets out the five main drivers of the Group’s Profit and Loss account.  It shows how the profit from 
(1) new Retail space and (2) Online sales, more than offset the profit lost as a result of (3) declining sales in the 
existing store base.  It also shows how (4) cost inflation has been more than offset by (5) cost savings.

Five straightforward objectives
The Company has five core operational objectives, as set out below.  Underlying these operational goals is the 
ever present and overriding financial objective of delivering long term, sustainable growth in earnings per share.
Develop the NEXT 
Brand
Develop, improve and expand our product ranges, focusing on being better by design.
Rigorously control 
costs
Control costs through constantly developing more efficient ways of operating.  This must be 
done without detracting from the quality of our products and services.  
Invest in profitable 
new space
Open profitable new retail space, maintaining the Company’s strict payback and 
profitability hurdles of 15% net store profit (before central overheads) and payback on net 
capital invested in 24 months.  
Invest in online 
growth
Invest in growth from our online business, through improving UK services and new overseas 
markets.  
Generate and return 
cash 
Focus on cash generation.  Return funds that are not needed to develop the business 
to shareholders through share buybacks.  This must be earnings enhancing and in the 
interests of shareholders generally.  
PRODUCT AND THE NEXT BRAND
Without great product, all our other activities are in vain.  We believe there is the opportunity to further improve and 
expand our product ranges, particularly at the more aspirational end of our collections.
NEXT has always maintained that, if we are to succeed, our products must be better by design.  Additional time and 
money has been invested in the design process for Autumn Winter 2013.  We hope to see continuing improvements 
in the fashion content and quality of our ranges as the year progresses.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW
COST INFLATION AND COST CONTROL
We are very clear that we must not compromise service or quality to save money, nor should we stop taking on 
new costs that improve our service offer.  So we must control costs through operational innovation and improved 
purchasing.  The tables below outline the main contributors to cost increases and cost savings over the last year.
Cost Increases £m
Cost of living awards and other wage related inflation 17
Costs of Directory delivery service improvements 15
Rent, rates & other occupancy inflation 7

Cost Savings £m
Gross margin improvements 22
Retail manpower efficiencies and other cost savings 19
Directory operating efficiencies 10
Lower freight costs 3

Other 7
Total 64
Looking at the year ahead we expect cost inflation to be less challenging at around £35m.  Once again, we 
believe that we can offset all these increased costs through saving initiatives.
RETAIL
Retail sales were level with last year.  New space added 3.2% to Retail sales and 2.1% to total Brand sales.  Retail 
profit of £331m was 2.3% higher than last year, representing a 0.3% improvement in the Retail net margin.
RETAIL SPACE
Retail Expansion in 2012/13
During the year we added 250,000 square feet to our store portfolio.  This was less than the 300,000 we had 
budgeted at the start of the year.  The shortfall was because it has taken longer than expected to get planning 
permission for new projects and because a fire delayed one of our new large sites.

Space Expansion in the Year Ahead
There continue to be good opportunities to profitably increase UK retail selling space.  Our expansion programme 
is built bottom-up, on a location by location basis, and there remain many towns and cities where we believe there 
is the potential to offer wider ranges in larger stores.  
Planning remains a problem, though often more of a delay than a brick wall.  We are actively working with planning 
officers, councillors and local communities to deliver new shops, investment and jobs.  We continue to make a 
greater investment in the external architecture of our new stores, particularly on Retail Parks.  Our aim is to transform 
the quality of construction associated with out-of-town retail and create the sort of buildings that communities will 
see as an asset, not an eyesore.
In our dealing with local councils it is noticeable that some are much more pro-growth and pro-jobs than others.  
Many local councils are enthusiastic and efficient; but a few remain an unhealthy mix of Luddite intransigence 
and incompetence.  Going forward, in areas where councils traditionally have got away with just saying “no”, we 
will be more active in harnessing the law and the full weight of public opinion to campaign for growth.
Next year we expect to add at least 250,000 sq. ft. of trading space (net of closures).  
Store Portfolio Profitability
We continue to closely monitor the profitability of our store portfolio.  Underperforming stores are actively managed 
with a view to possible closure before they become uneconomic.  On average our store leases have 7 years to run 
before expiry or a break clause.  
Our portfolio remains extremely profitable, with 89% of our sales coming from stores delivering more than 15% profit 
contribution on sales.

Over the last five years the steady process of opening new space and refitting existing stores has transformed our 
portfolio.  Of the 6.7 million square feet of trading space we have today, 3.7 million (54%) is in stores that are either 
brand new or enlarged.  Of the remaining 3 million square feet, 2.2 million has been refitted, leaving just 800,000 
(13%) square feet of the portfolio unchanged from 2007. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW
RETAIL PROFIT ANALYSIS
Operating margin improved slightly on last year.  The table below details the margin movement by the major 
heads of costs.
Net operating margin last year 14.8%
Increase in bought-in 
gross margin
The improvement in bought-in gross margin was driven by an improved USD 
exchange rate.  This improvement was partly offset by selling a higher 
proportion of Home and Childrenswear; these product categories have a 
lower gross margin than the average.
+0.3%
Reduction in freight 
and faulty
The cost of freight fell and in addition we used less unplanned air freight.  
Faulty stock rates also reduced.
+0.3%
Increase in store 
payroll
The annual cost-of-living pay award and staff bonus would have pushed 
wage costs up by 0.5%, however this cost was almost completely offset by 
in-store efficiency initiatives.
- 0.1%
Increase in store 
occupancy
Rents and rates increased as a percentage of sales mainly as a result of 
negative like for like sales.  Rental inflation was minimal and continued to 
decline.  Business rates inflation, which is linked to September RPI, was very 
high at 5.6%.  
Electricity costs also increased significantly in the first half.

Central overheads Central overheads reduced as a percentage of sales. +0.2%
Net operating margin this year 15.1%
DIRECTORY
NEXT Directory sales were up 9.5% and profit increased by 15.1%.
UK SERVICE
NEXT Directory continues to provide good opportunities for growth.  In the UK, growth is driven by the wider online 
market and by improving delivery services.  Last year we added Same-Day, Evening, Sunday and Next-Day to Store 
delivery services, all at a £2.99 premium to the standard service.
In 2013 we have already improved our delivery services further:
 ❚ The cut off for standard next day delivery to home has been moved back to 10pm.  
 ❚ Next-Day delivery to stores has been improved to allow collection after 12.30pm (as opposed to 4.00pm) and 
the price of this service has been reduced from £2.99 to 50p.  
INTERNATIONAL ONLINE
International sales grew from £33m to £54m.  We now sell direct to 60 international territories, and also through 6 
partners in 14 of those countries.  Our international online business contributed £10m to profit.  In the year ahead 
we expect our overseas online business to grow to at least £70m, adding a further £4m to profit. Additional information Parent Company accounts Governance Consolidated accounts Business reports

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW
INTERNATIONAL RETAIL
We have a profitable franchise business, with partners operating 170 stores in 33 countries.  Our 19 directly owned 
stores (in 7 countries) made a small loss.  We do not intend to open any new directly owned international stores 
going forward.  Revenue and income for our international business is set out below.

Franchise income 61.5 58.7
Owned store sales 16.2 17.6
Total revenue 77.7 76.3 +1.8%
Operating profit 8.4 7.9 +6.2%
We are budgeting for International Retail to make a profit of £10m in the year ahead, the improvement coming 
mainly from the closure of loss making stores.
NEXT SOURCING
NEXT Sourcing profit recovered from the previous year, when a significant provision was required against unshipped 
faulty stock.  That issue has been resolved and £1m of excess provision has been released this year.  NEXT Sourcing 
competes for business against the many other suppliers to NEXT Retail and NEXT Directory, it provides around 40% 
of NEXT Brand stock.

LIPSY
The full year sales of £58m and profit of £4m, before amortisation and profit share of £2m, was the best performance 
under the four years of our ownership.  Internet sales, through Lipsy’s own site and the NEXT Directory, doubled to 
£17m and are now ahead of wholesale sales.  Lipsy’s retail sales were £22m, taken from 51 stores trading 60,000 sq.  ft.
PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
Underlying profit was down by £2m to £3.5m.  We now own very few retail freeholds.  At the end of the year we 
sold a development property occupied by Ventura (a business we divested in 2011): the £9m profit is shown as 
exceptional.  We do not anticipate any property management profit in the year ahead.   Additional information Parent Company accounts Governance Consolidated accounts Business reports

CENTRAL COSTS
The charge has increased by £5m mainly due to performance-related pay and Company wide share-based 
incentives.  We expect central costs to decrease by £1m in the year ahead.
PENSION SCHEME
The actuarial pension credit fell from £7m to £4m.  We expect this credit to be around £3m in the coming year.  
During the year we made changes to our final salary pension scheme (which has been closed to new entrants 
since 2000).  This change gave a credit adjustment which was partially offset by the cost of hedging out a tranche 
of pension liabilities.  The net effect of these two changes was an exceptional post-tax credit of £28m.
INTEREST AND TAXATION
The interest charge was £28m.  For the year ahead we expect net debt to range between £400m and £600m, 
resulting in a similar interest charge.
Our tax rate reduced as expected to 23.9%, following the reduction in headline UK corporation tax rates.  On the 
assumption that tax rates continue to reduce as announced, we expect our effective rate to be no higher than 
23% in each of the next two years.
BALANCE SHEET
The balance sheet remains strong with year end net debt of £493m and forecast peak borrowing requirements 
being very adequately financed by our bonds and bank facilities of £923m, as set out in the table below.
 
£m
2013 bonds – repayment due September 85
2016 bonds 213
2021 bonds 325
Total bonds nominal value 623
2016 committed bank facility 300
Total debt facilities available 923
We believe NEXT will generate around £250m of cash in the year ahead after capital expenditure, interest, tax and 
dividends, but before share buybacks.
CASH GENERATION, NET DEBT AND SHARE BUYBACKS
STRONGER THAN EXPECTED CASH FLOW 
Cash generation was significantly ahead of our expectations.  Operational cash flow, before buybacks and before 
additional cover in the ESOT, was £376m.  This was a long way ahead of our original £240m forecast, the variance 
has been driven by higher profits, lower capital expenditure and year end stock levels, higher Directory customer 
payments and a number of other one off factors.
During the year we used surplus cash to buy 7.5 million shares (4.5% of shares outstanding as at Jan 2012) at an 
average price of £32.13 and a cost of £241m.  In addition we used £52m to increase the share option cover in our 
Employee Share Ownership Trust: this had the effect of reducing net shares in issue by a further 0.7%. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013

DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW
BUYBACKS, EPS AND SHARE PRICE
Despite their increasing popularity, share buybacks are still widely misunderstood.  There are still those who wrongly 
believe that they are some sort of share support scheme.  This, of course, would be futile as any attempt to support 
a share price would evaporate as soon as the money ran out.
The only reason share buybacks can deliver long term value is because they permanently reduce the number 
of shares in issue and so increase the amount of profit attributable to each share (EPS).  An important part of the 
logic of share buybacks is the implied link between growth in EPS and growth in share price.  Whilst, in the short 
term there might appear to be no link, in the long run share prices tend to reflect the fundamental value of the 
earnings and dividend stream.  If the share price did not rise with EPS, the buyback programme would eventually 
leave a single share owning all the profits and dividends!
The graph below illustrates the long term correlation of share price to EPS for NEXT plc over the period we have 
been buying back shares.  The blue boxes indicate earnings per share and the black line shows the share price.  
The boxes at the top of the chart show the historic price/earnings (PE) ratio.

THE LONG GAME – THE NEXT PLC RULES OF BUYBACKS
Over the long term, we have been following these rules when considering buybacks:
1.  Share buybacks must be earnings enhancing and make a healthy Equivalent Rate of Return (see below).
2.  Only use the cash the business does not need.  NEXT has always prioritised investment in the business over 
share buybacks.
3.  Use surplus cash flow, not ever-increasing amounts of debt.  We have never allowed our share buyback 
programme to threaten our investment grade credit status and will not do so going forward.
4.  Maintain the dividend at a reasonable level through growing dividends in line with EPS.  NEXT will continue to 
increase dividends in line with EPS.
5.  Be consistent.  NEXT has been buying shares every year for more than 10 years, reducing the shares in issue by 
more than 50%.
6.  For share buybacks to be an effective use of shareholder cash, the core business must have the prospect of 
long term growth.

EFFECT ON BUYBACKS OF A RISING SHARE PRICE 
The graph above demonstrates that the relationship between our EPS and share price has recently returned to its 
near historical average.  It is important to recognise that this relative rise in the PE ratio reduces the benefit of share 
buybacks.  The more expensive the shares become, the smaller the share of the business can be bought with the 
same amount of surplus cash.  
For example, two years ago when our share price was £21, our operational free cash flow of £200m enabled us 
to buy 5.2% of the Company.  Today with the shares around £40 our expected surplus cash flow of £250m will only 
buy 3.9%.
The overall effect is simple: as the PE ratio rises the earnings enhancement of buybacks falls.  So, given our current 
PE ratio, how should NEXT assess the desirability of share buybacks? 
Essentially there are two measures we look at.  The first is the earnings enhancement of a buyback when compared 
to the enhancement to earnings from keeping the cash in the bank and earning interest.  The second is the 
comparison between the earnings enhancement of a buyback compared to the return that would have to be 
achieved from investing the cash in an alternative investment, the equivalent rate of return (ERR).
With long term borrowing rates for NEXT at around 4%, a share buyback of £250m at £40 would be 2.5% earnings 
enhancing.  The problem with this method of assessing buybacks is that at low interest rates buybacks remain 
earnings enhancing beyond £60, so we consider the equivalent rate of return measure to be more helpful.
EQUIVALENT RATE OF RETURN (ERR)
The tables below set out the maths used to calculate ERR.  The top table shows the enhancement achieved from 
acquiring £250m of shares at £40, which is 4%.  The second table shows that if we were to increase our profits by 4% 
we would have to invest in an asset yielding 10%.  Given that share buybacks carry no additional operational risk, 
the returns at 10% remain very attractive.
 
Enhancement £250m Buyback (pre interest costs) 
Share price £40.00
Market capitalisation £6,400m
Cash used for buyback £250m
% Acquired (250/6400) 3.9%
EPS Enhancement 1/(1–3.9%) 4.1%
Calculating ERR
Company profits £622m
Additional profit required for 4% growth in EPS £25.3m
Additional profit as a percentage of £250m invested in buyback (ERR) 10.1%
(These workings are shown as an explanation of Equivalent Rate of Return.  Of course, a simpler way of calculating 
ERR is to divide profit before tax into market capitalisation!) ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2013
14
The graph below shows how ERR falls as the share price rises.  As the yield approaches the Market’s expected 
return on equity (say 8%), the buyback becomes less attractive.  If the returns dropped much below 9% we would 
become less enthusiastic, so to a certain extent the share price provides a natural moderator of a disciplined 
buyback programme.

OUTLOOK FOR 2013
THE CONSUMER ECONOMY
The consumer environment looks set to remain subdued.  The inevitable deleveraging of public and private 
finances means that the nation must slowly work its way back to affording the lifestyle it was already enjoying 
before the financial crisis.  
This process of retrenchment is manifesting itself in earnings growth running below the rate of inflation.  This decline 
in real earnings looks set to continue for at least one, if not several more years to come.  Indeed the outlook for 2013 
inflation has worsened since this time last year.  
The graph below shows the difference in CPI and wages.  The black dotted line is the Bank of England central 
inflation forecast as at January 2013, the grey dotted lines are the equivalent estimates in January and November 
2012.  Estimates for inflation steadily rose last year, leaving the outlook for real earnings as difficult as 2012, if 
not slightly worse.  So we are planning on there being very little if any improvement in the underlying consumer 
economy.

OUTLOOK FOR NEXT BRAND SALES 2013
In this environment we will continue to budget for our existing stores to take moderately less than the previous year.  
Any growth in sales must come from investment in profitable new space and the continuing growth in the online 
market, both in the UK and overseas.  In the year ahead we expect these avenues of growth to continue to exceed 
underlying declines.  
We are budgeting for total NEXT Brand sales for the full year to rise within a range of +1% to +4%.
The first few weeks of the year have been quiet and serve to reinforce a more cautious approach.  At present, 
sales are at the bottom of our target range, though we expect this situation to improve.  We will get a better 
understanding of the underlying consumer environment once temperatures return to seasonal levels.  We will issue 
further guidance with our May trading statement.
OUTLOOK FOR GROUP PROFITS AND EPS
Assuming sales fall within our budgeted range, we expect Group profits before tax, for the full year, to be in a 
range of £615m to £665m, which would represent a year on year movement of between -1% to +7%.  Assuming we 
achieve our buyback plan, EPS would rise by between +4% and +13%.  The table below sets out our guidance for

OUTLOOK FOR RETAIL SELLING PRICE INFLATION 2013 AND BEYOND
Overall factory gate prices are stable.  Any increases in Far Eastern wages have generally been offset by 
manufacturing productivity improvements or the development of new Far Eastern sources of supply, in particular 
Bangladesh and Cambodia.
The recent sharp fall in the value of sterling will have very little impact on this year’s pricing as we have bought 
forward most of our foreign currency requirement for the current year.  If the pound remains at its current rate of 
exchange against the dollar, we would expect our prices to rise in 2014.
INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT
Our next statement will cover the first fourteen weeks of the year, to 4 May 2013, and is provisionally scheduled for 
Wednesday 8 May 2013.
IN SUMMARY
NEXT has performed well in a difficult year, delivering good growth in sales and profits along with exceptional 
advances in earnings per share and dividends.  The year ahead looks no less challenging but the Group is well 
prepared and has further opportunities for growth.  We remain strongly cash generative and have every chance 
of delivering another year of increased sales and earnings per share.

Galaz
On the positive side, we recently 
completed the much anticipated 
farm-out of part of our interest at 
Galaz to LGI, the Korean multi-
national corporation. The funds 
released both to develop the Galaz 
asset and for Roxi day to day use 
were well timed.
Development work is expected to 
commence in earnest at Galaz in 
the second quarter of 2011 
following the receipt of a final 
clearance under the new Kazakh 
environmental law. We believe that 
this should allow production to 
commence by October 2011.
BNG Seismic evaluation
Also on the positive side we have 
almost completed the interpretation of 
the seismic data collected at the BNG 
Contract Area (“BNG”) over the past 
couple of years. This is being 
evaluated by our external consultants, 
Gaffney, Cline and Associates Ltd, the 
results of which should be announced 
during the second quarter 2011.
Drilling results at BNG
Our drilling activity on South Yelemes 
has resulted in some positive oil 
shows from the first three wells drilled 
there in 2010, for which we received 
notification of our pilot production 
license in December 2010. 
On the negative side in February 
2011 on the North Yelemes, one of 
our smaller prospects on BNG, we 
announced that, based on wire 
logging, there were no zones of 
commercial interest at Well 135 and 
that it would be plugged and 
abandoned. This was clearly a 
disappointment having drilled to a 
depth of almost 3,000 metres but the 
exercise provided a considerable 
amount of information which we 
believe will assist in our further 
development of this area.
Canamens
In March 2011 we announced that 
Canamens BNG BV (“Canamens”), 
our farm-out partner at BNG and 
before that at Ravninnoe, had 
informed us that they would not be 
making the final payments due 
under the farm-out arrangements 
approved by Roxi shareholders in 
November 2009. These amount to 
some $12 million. 
We had been aware for some  
time that the principal shareholders 
 in Canamens were conducting a 
strategic review of Canamen’s 
investments and future commitments. 
While we thought that Canamens’s 
shareholders may not wish 
Canamens to fund the development 
of the BNG asset following the end of 
the arrangements entered into in 
November 2009, we were surprised

amounts set out in the agreement 
signed at that time.
Under the terms of the farm-out 
agreement the failure by Canamens 
to make these payments results in 
the forfeiture of 6.23 percent of BNG 
LLP, the entity owning the rights to 
BNG.  Accordingly Roxi’s interest in 
BNG LLP would have increased from 
23.41 per cent to 29.64 percent and 
Canamens would have fallen from 35 
percent to 28.77 percent.  
In the short-term Canamens’ decision 
not to advance the funds for the 
development of BNG has had little 
operational impact as much of the 
seismic acquisition and processing 
work has been completed and as 
mentioned above the publication of 
an audited portfolio of BNG 
prospectivity is expected in the 
second quarter of 2011.
On 10 May 2011, we announced that 
we had agreed with Canamens to 
cancel the original BNG farm-out. 
Accordingly Roxi will own 58.41 
percent at the BNG Contract Area. 
Additionally Canamens have agreed 
to novate its loans from BNG Ltd LLP 
to Roxi, other than US$ 2.5 million 
which will be repaid by BNG Ltd LLP, 
in return for Roxi granting a 1.5 
percent royalty on its gross value of 
future production from the BNG 
Contract Area. I am delighted to 
report that as well as regaining 
majority control of this asset Roxi has 
resumed operational and financial 
control of all development operations 
at the BNG Contract Area.
The significance of this for Roxi, is 
that BNG Energy BV can now seek a 
new farm out partner by farming out 
an interest in BNG LLP in exchange 
for the new partner providing 
additional funding into the operating 
asset. This will allow for the BNG to 
explore some of the deeper horizons 
identified from recently performed 3D 
seismic work carried out across the 
license area. Roxi will also now be 
entitled to US$23.6 million of loans 
that were previously due to 
Canamens, representing their share 
of historical funding provided to the 
BNG asset, which have now been 
novated to Roxi as part of the deal.
Management
As previously reported during the year 
under review we strengthened the 
Board by the appointment in February 
2010 of Edmund Limerick, as a non 
Executive Director and in June 2010  
of Hyunsik Jang, as Chief Operating 
Officer. I am pleased to report that 
they are making a strong contribution 
to the running of the Company and 
that in David Wilkes we have a very 
competent Chief Executive well 
equipped to lead us through some 
potentially challenging times.
Kazakhstan
During the period under review there 
have been important changes to both 
the subsoil and taxation legislation. In 
addition there have been changes in 
the senior personnel at some of the 
regulatory authorities with which we 
deal. Inevitably, such a scale of 
change has resulted in delays in 
receiving regulatory approvals and 
consequently, our operations.
What has been pleasing is the way in 
which our team has responded to 
these challenges. I believe this is a 
direct result of our policy of employing 
principally Kazakh nationals and of 
working with our Kazakh partners to 
develop our assets. We continue to 
maintain good relations with both our 
local partners and the local 
authorities; this remains core 
strength of our business.
Employees
Once again I would like to thank all  
of our employees for their continued 
hard work. It is never easy working 
for a Company such as ours in 
difficult times. The progress that 
has been made is principally the 
result of their sustained efforts in 
uncertain times.
Outlook
Now we have concluded an 
acceptable exit from the current 
arrangements with Canamens on 
BNG, we look forward to developing 
our principal assets to move both into 
production later in 2011.

GMS AT A GLANCE
A WORLD LEADER  
IN SESVs
Gulf Marine Services is the operator  
of the world’s largest fleet of advanced  
self-propelled Self-Elevating Support  
Vessels (SESVs). 
About Us
GMS’ assets provide a stable platform 
for the delivery of a wide range of  
services performed by the Group’s clients 
throughout the total lifecycle of offshore 
oil, gas and renewable energy activities.  
The vessels are capable of operations in  
the Middle East, South East Asia, West 
Africa and Europe. 
The Group constructs and maintains  
its vessels at its yard in Abu Dhabi; its 
extensive new build programme makes  
the GMS fleet the most sophisticated in  
the industry. The current fleet of SESVs 
comprises 14 vessels; GMS will increase  
this to 15 vessels by the end of 2016.
Our Offering 
The Group’s SESV fleet is technically 
advanced and amongst the youngest  
in the industry, with an average age of  
seven years. The SESVs are four-legged 
vessels that move independently, with no 
requirement for anchor handling or tug 
support. They have a large deck space, 
crane capacity and accommodation facilities 
that can be adapted to the requirements  
of the Group’s clients. 
 
These vessels support GMS’ clients in  
a broad range of offshore oil and gas 
platform refurbishment and maintenance 
activities, well intervention work and 
offshore wind turbine maintenance  
work (which are opex-led activities) and 
offshore oil and gas platform installation  
and offshore wind turbine installation  
(which are capex-led activities).

History 
GMS was established in Abu Dhabi, UAE  
in 1977. In 2007 the Group was acquired  
by a consortium of investors, led by private 
equity firm Gulf Capital, and a new senior 
management team was appointed, headed  
by the current CEO Duncan Anderson.  
At this time, the Group was operating  
three self-propelled SESVs (with a fourth 
undergoing refurbishment) and had another 
under construction. Within just eight years, 
GMS has successfully expanded its fleet  
and geographical coverage, from a local 
operation in Abu Dhabi to become the  
number one player in the Middle East, and  
is now the largest operator of self-propelled 
SESVs in the world. The Group listed on the 
London Stock Exchange in March 2014.
The current SESV fleet stands at 14  
vessels (as at March 2016); it also has an 
accommodation barge and two anchor-
handling tug support (AHTS) vessels.
The first Large Class vessel, which opened 
up a market sector where vessels can 
operate in harsh weather and deeper water 
environments, was constructed in 2010, with 
a second delivered in 2011. In 2010 when GMS 
Endurance was completed it was initially 
deployed in Saudi Arabia, whilst the second, 
GMS Endeavour, was mobilised to the North 
Sea; both markets were a first for GMS and 
allowed the Group to continue its growth 
strategy and to expand its geographic and 
client footprint beyond the UAE where it had 
predominantly been working up to that time. 
GMS operated entirely in the oil and gas 
sector until 2011 when it entered the offshore 
wind power installation market in North West 
Europe with one of its Large Class vessels, 
GMS Endeavour. 
In 2014 GMS embarked on a programme  
to expand the fleet by a further six SESVs. 
Five of these vessels have been successfully 
delivered on time and within budget and the 
sixth one, GMS Evolution, is scheduled for 
completion at the end of 2016.
The information in this section is as of 1 March 2016.

 02 Lombard Risk Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
CHaiRmanâ€™s 
statement
I joined Lombard Risk as Chairman 
on 1 May 2010 with the result 
that my own direct experience 
of the Company covers only the 
current financial year. The year to 
date has been a period in which 
the company has been able to 
reap the benefit of the efforts and 
investment made in the previous 
financial year. This has resulted in 
revenue growth of more than 30% 
in the first four months of the 
current financial year, and a return 
to profitability during that time. 
The board and executive team are 
focused on continued operational 
improvements and efficiency to 
accompany the revenue growth 
being achieved. Costs have 
been cut but have also been 
accompanied by investment 
in those areas which we believe 
will drive future growth.
I will report in greater detail 
at the time of the interim 
financial statements but my first 
impressions are of a company 
with considerable potential. I am 
grateful to the Board, investors 
and advisors alike for making me 
feel welcome at Lombard Risk.

 Morse plc Annual Report 2007 8
Chief Executive Officer’ s review
Forward thinking
Kevin Alcock
Chief Executive Officer
Morse has transformed itself into a fully integrated
professional services company operating under one brand
and, as a result, has made significant progress in improving
the quality and mix of our business. By combining the
strengths of our three business units into a single portfolio
of services, we are now providing our clients with
specialist advisory and execution services in support of
their business strategies and operating models including
business processes, IT applications and IT infrastructure.
What differentiates us from other companies in the market
is our specialist knowledge, our ability to respond quickly
to our clients’ business and IT needs, and our company
culture. The new Morse brand is developing an outstanding
reputation in the business and IT services market in our
chosen sectors and we have the right strategy, investment
capability and management skills in place to exploit our
key strengths and to build on the strong position we have
already established in our chosen markets.
The Morse transformation programme has focused on
improving the quality and shape of the business in terms
of client relationships, mix of advisory and execution
services and balance between product services and
consultancy-led engagements. This strategy has provided
the foundation for the progress we are making towards 
our medium-term strategic goals to:
� Double the operating margin to 7.2% 
(from 30 June 2006) by growing it between 0.5% 
and 1.0% per annum 
� Deliver absolute operating profit of £20.0 million
� Improve gross margins to between 27% and 30%
� Enhance recurring revenue streams from 24% to 30%
� Increase chargeable headcount aligned to our revenue 
and profit targets
� Develop the balance of One Morse clients to greater 
than 50% of our core relationships
Achievements in the year
Having completed our transformation during the past year,
we are now in the process of implementing our strategies
and delivering the tangible results we sought:
� Successful demerger of Monitise with no further funding
obligations, giving Morse the strategic focus and 
financial strength to fulfil its potential as a professional 
services firm
� Fully integrated business operating under a single Morse
brand, with strong differentiation in the business and IT 
consulting services market
� We have enhanced and strengthened the senior 
management team and have implemented a structured 
and very active talent management programme
� Progress against our clearly defined growth strategy and
medium term performance objectives:
– Operating profit from continuing operations before 
exceptional items up 16% to £12.2 million 
(2006: £10.6 million), having significantly improved 
in the last two years (2005: £7.6 million)
– Operating margin percentage from continuing 
operations before exceptional items up 1.2% points 
to 4.8% (2006: 3.6%) Morse plc Annual Report 2007 9

Strategic objectives
The Morse business now represents a balanced portfolio
of business and IT consulting services and capabilities that
we will continue to enhance by focusing on increasing
client value and exceeding industry standard benchmark
metrics. To drive the business forward we are focusing 
on seven strategic objectives, each with detailed key
performance indicators. These are reviewed, developed
and cascaded throughout the organisation.
� Making the most of the breadth and depth of Morse 
resources and capabilities through a strategic client 
management programme designed to enhance our 
client relationships
� Increasing our focused industry proposition capabilities 
through the development, recruitment and acquisition of
specialist skills
� Developing a culture and values framework that, together
with a structured people development programme, 
creates an inspiring environment for all stakeholders
� Optimising our core business process management to 
maximise the quality of client engagement and align 
resources directly to providing client value
� Growing the balance of our business profitably so that 
we can support our investment programme for 
enhancing our specialist consulting skills
� Delivering, in all aspects of the Morse business, the One
Morse brand promise to offer better value to our clients
� Enhancing our capabilities as an international consulting
business with selected investment in increasing local 
operational resources and skills base
Shape of the business going forward 
There are three key dimensions to the Morse business that
will shape the way that we develop and grow:
� The range of our advisory and execution consultancy 
services
� The breadth and depth of our infrastructure, applications
and management consulting capabilities
� The level of focused industry segment specialisation 
within the financial services, media and 
communications, commercial and public sector 
vertical markets
We plan to significantly increase the advisory services
within our applications and infrastructure consultancy
business units. At the same time, we will develop and
grow our execution services within our management
consulting business unit from the strong base of advisory
services that exist already.
We will also drive a more comprehensive balance of
services across our business units as we develop Morse’s
specialist capabilities and vertical market expertise. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 11
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Industry verticals – Morse will continue to build on its
significant position within the financial services market
where we are a top five player and has revenues of 
£116.1 million. We are developing the specialist media 
and communications business with a well-articulated client
focus and market offering including defined propositions
and solutions coverage that draws on a full range of
Morse’s consulting capabilities, and we continue to
develop clients across the large operators, network
providers, equipment manufacturers and media and
content companies. Media and communications now
represent £50.4 million of revenue. We will also continue 
to develop the breadth and depth of our proposition in the
commercial sector, which already delivers £73.1 million in
revenue, with emphasis on the retail and consumer goods
segments. In the public sector, a relatively small segment
for Morse with revenues of £16.9 million, our focus will be
on opportunities arising from the Government’s
transformation agenda and back office transformation 
in local government.
Plans are in place to move forward with all these areas
from within our own resources. We continue to invest
organically and during the current year examples include;
the development of our business in France and our focus
on the Government’s Building Schools for the Future (BSF)
initiative which is already yielding opportunities for which
we are short listed. In addition, the Company will make
acquisitions where these offer the opportunity to add
specialist capabilities or accelerate the overall
development effort.

Working with our clients
F&C Asset Management
F&C Asset Management
F&C Asset Management (F&C) is a leading investment specialist
managing over £101 billion in assets for a range of investors,
including private investors, financial advisors and institutional clients.
Towards the end of 2006 F&C faced some operational challenges
with their front office applications. Managing multiple inherited
applications was leading to difficulties in providing new functionality
to their fund managers. 
To overcome these challenges, F&C engaged our services to advise
and help them to redesign the front office architecture and to
improve their efficiency in delivering functionality to the fund managers.
Drawing on our extensive experience in the financial services sector,
Morse was in a position to meet the client’s business needs as well
as provide specialist industry expertise. Our ability to offer the full
spectrum of consultancy, from operational advice through to
implementing the solution architected, was central to our
engagement on this assignment. Morse consultants worked with the
client to understand how their existing systems were supporting their
business before designing a revised architecture and associated
delivery processes. F&C are now implementing their new applications
architecture and are confident that they are now well placed to
incorporate new developments in their front office as they arise.
Luc Leclercq, Director of Operations, F&C Asset Management says,
“Very pleased with timely and professional advice given by Morse”. 
Outlook
We have made a good start to the current financial year
across all business units and remain on track to achieve
our performance targets of a 7.2% operating margin
producing an absolute operating profit of £20.0 million
over the medium term. The business continues to identify
and execute on opportunities to accelerate our strategy,
we are moving forward with increasing confidence.

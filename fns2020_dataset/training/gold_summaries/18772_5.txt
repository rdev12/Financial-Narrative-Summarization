I am delighted to report on a record year for Inland with the 
business achieving 48% growth in net assets per share to 43.92p 
(2014 restated: 29.63p per share) and a profit before tax of £34.0m 
(2014 restated: £9.6m).
As set out in the Chairman’s Statement, this has been a significant 
year for our Group, with record sales of 440 building plots, together 
with the sale of 248 private homes and 39 for housing associations. 
our average selling price of £264,000 for our private units 
means that we are at the end of the market where our product is 
affordable and where demand from buyers is strongest.
This outstanding set of results has been helped by a revaluation 
surplus of £14.5m on the existing housing portfolio at w ilton 
Park, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire where 76 houses are being 
held as investment properties. This revaluation should help give 
shareholders an indication of some of the underlying value behind 
Inland’s stated NAv per share. These properties are being rented 
out on assured shorthold tenancy agreements with 31 properties 
going under offer to tenants in the first few months. once all the 
houses at w ilton Park are let, we expect gross residential rental 
income on this project to exceed £1m per annum.
Despite the utilisation of 727 plots through sale of land and 
construction of homes, our land bank has continued to rise and 
now stands at a record 5,176 plots. This is testament to our small 
land team led by Paul Brett, the Group Land Director. 
The status of the land portfolio is as follows:
Plots
owned or contracted with planning consent or 
resolution to grant planning consent 1,086
owned or contracted without consent 1,344
Held within joint ventures without consent 1,329
Plots controlled or terms agreed with consent or 
resolution to grant planning consent 114
Plots controlled or terms agreed without consent 1,303
t otal 5,176
w hilst our primary business is residentially led brownfield 
regeneration, wherever possible we ensure that our assets 
generate an income stream that contributes significantly towards 
the running costs of the business. our short term target is to 
achieve a rental income in excess of £2m per annum.
The substantial increase in work in progress within our 
housebuilding operations and the continuing investment into good 
land opportunities, particularly into major projects such as w ilton 
Park, has led to an increase in our borrowings after the year end 
and the Board is comfortable with the position as the underlying 
asset value of the business has also grown substantially. The 
increased borrowings are also supported by a strong forward sales 
position and growing recurring rental income.
The Group has in the order of 50 projects at various stages of the 
development cycle and I set out below further details on a number 
of the more significant ones.

we achieved adoption of the planning brief for the development of 
this site during the course of the year. This confirms the capacity 
for at least 300 new homes, together with commercial space and 
the retention of a substantial number of existing former MoD 
houses.
we now intend to apply for planning permission based on the 
principles set out in the brief and, in the meantime, expect to 
commence the construction of the first section of the new access 
road into the site from the Pyebush roundabout. This will also 
serve as the first section of the long awaited Beaconsfield relief 
road which will connect to Amersham Road (A355) in due course. 
In the short term, and until consent is granted, our focus will 
be on generating short term income and preparing the site for 
development.
This site is our ‘jewel in the crown’ and is geographically situated 
in one of the most affluent parts of the country outside Central 
London. we estimate the gross development value to be in the 
order of £250m. Shareholders can rest assured that we are 
managing and nurturing this asset very carefully.

we are very proud of what has been achieved on this project. we 
have turned what was a derelict wasteland of rundown buildings 
into a superb community of new homes in a highly landscaped 
environment with a number of beautifully laid out village greens 
and children’s play areas.
A combined heat and power system was installed with a 
new energy centre that delivers hot water and heating to the 
development in an extremely efficient manner, with estimated 
carbon savings of 40% when compared to a more conventional 
system.
The sale of 205 building plots to a major housebuilder in June 2015 
means that our work is now nearly finished. The development of 43 
new homes by Inland, which are all pre-sold, will also conclude in 
this financial year.
The development has been extremely profitable and has 
demonstrated the ability of Inland to manage a large-scale complex 
development from inception through to completion, creating an 
excellent living environment in the process. The development is also 
experiencing additional value brought about by the new Cross Rail 
station at west Drayton which will be an easy walking distance away.

The development of 152 apartments on a complex, brownfield 
former hospital site was completed during the year. The 
apartments proved to be very attractive to a substantial number 
of first time buyers and investors. A block of 59 units was sold to 
an investor prior to commencement of the development and this 
underpinned the financing for the project. The demand for the 
homes was very strong with all units sold well ahead of completion 
of the building works.

This site is a former builder’s merchant yard, located in a prime 
location on a one acre plot. The property was acquired during the 
year and leased back to the former owner whilst it is being taken 
through the planning process. 
we have now made a planning application for 95 apartments, 
including some affordable housing, and commercial space. 
we expect to receive planning consent during the current 
financial year for a scheme that is expected to generate a gross 
development value of approximately £35m.

This seven acre brownfield site is the former home of ITv Meridian 
Studios fronting the River Itchen. A resolution to grant planning 
consent for 351 units plus some commercial space was secured 
during the year, with no affordable housing provision. Site 
clearance has commenced and construction of the first phase of 54 
homes will start in the current financial year. we expect the entire 
development to achieve a gross development value of £65m.

our development of a small part of the former Pilkington’s Tiles 
factory, where we have consent for 268 homes, is now well under 
way with 41 homes now completed. 
we are currently selling on average over four homes per month 
on this project, where 3 bedroom houses are achieving an 
average price of £320,000. This site has undergone a dramatic 
transformation from what was a derelict industrial estate.

During the course of the year we obtained consent for 152

completed a very profitable sale of the site to another

This former gasworks site is in the town centre opposite the 
Eden Shopping Centre and is subject to significant remediation to 
prepare for development. 
Detailed plans are due to be submitted shortly to the local 
authority for approximately 240 homes and circa 16,000 ft² of 
commercial space. 
BR O OKLANDS 	 C OLLEGE , 	 CHUR CH 	 R O AD , 	 ASHF ORD , 	 MIDDLESEX 	
This is a ten acre site in the town centre where a scheme is 
being prepared for approximately 300 residential units and some 
commercial space. A planning application is expected to be 
submitted in spring 2016.
During the nine months since the inception of the Jv, a total of 
£13.3m has been committed on the above two projects, of which 
Inland’s share is £2.6m.
we continue to maintain our success rate in securing planning 
permissions on our brownfield sites and are pleased to see a 
growing recognition of our regeneration skills by landowners, 
particularly local authorities where we are working in partnership 
with a number of councils to bring forward regeneration and much 
needed homes in Southern England. of particular note on this 
front is our joint venture with Southampton City Council where 
we have signed heads of terms on a site, ‘Chapel Riverside’. This 
opportunity is for approximately 350 homes and a new commercial 
centre and will regenerate ten acres of land owned by the Council. 
we expect the Development Agreement with the Council to be 
signed within the next few months. 
* Due to the introduction of IFRS 10 the Group has 
consolidated the results of DGvL for the years ending

under IAS 27 and SIC 12 and these standards did not 
require the consolidation of DGvL.

The UK housing market slowed down in the early part of 2015, 
in all likelihood due to the uncertainty caused by the May 2015 
general election. Due to the continual undersupply of new housing 
and the expectation of low interest rates for the foreseeable 
future, it is more likely that house prices in Southern England 
will continue to rise. The market has recovered since the general 
election and the changes to stamp duty and the ‘Help to Buy’ 
scheme have been of significant assistance. The introduction 
of the National Planning Policy Framework has led to a much 
needed increase in residential consents; however, this increase 
is insufficient to meet the country’s demand especially in areas of 
greatest need.
out Look
w ith purchasers’ confidence high, supported by a removal of any 
political uncertainty and continuing strong demand for homes 
and building land, we have every confidence in delivering further 
significant progress in the current financial year.

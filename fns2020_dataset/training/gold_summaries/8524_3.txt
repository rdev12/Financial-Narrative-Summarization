 Isotron plc annual report and accounts 2002 4.0
Results
The results for the full year were in line with
our expectations at the time of making the
Gammaster acquisition.
Group turnover rose to £22.2m (2001:
£15.0m) with £5.4m coming from the
acquisition of Gammaster in January 2002.
Sales from existing operations rose 12%
with most of the gain coming from the
medical sector.  Operating profits rose by
21% to £5.0m (2001: £4.1m) after charging
£0.2m of integration costs and £0.5m of
goodwill amortisation.   Gammaster was
consolidated into the Isotron accounts for
24 weeks of the year (period since
acquisition on 16 January).
The interest payable reflects the borrowings
taken out at mid-year to fund the
acquisition of Gammaster.  Earnings per
share after amortisation and exceptional
expenses were 18.7p (2001: 25.3p) and
before amortisation and exceptional
expenses were 22.4p (2001: 25.3p).
Your board is recommending an
unchanged final dividend of 5.00p giving a
total of 7.94p for the full year (2001: 7.94p).
Board of Directors
We were pleased to welcome Paul
Santing, ex President of Gammaster, to
the Board in January 2002.  He is based
in Holland and is responsible primarily for
our interests in Holland, France and
Germany.  We were also pleased to
welcome George Kennedy, a former main
board Director of Smiths Industries and a
former Chairman of their medical division.
He joined the Board as a non-executive
Director in April 2002.  Charles Fitzherbert
retired from the Board in June 2002.  
I would like to thank Charles for his
invaluable contributions to the Board over
many years.  We are seeking to make a
further non-executive appointment in the
coming months.  
Outlook
In the new financial year Isotron is focused
on driving additional volume through its
recently expanded capacity, and
maximising the benefits from acquiring the
businesses of Gammaster.  The main
market of medical sterilisation remains
strong,  and we are planning for significant
growth from our Asian investments.

 4 Patsystems plc
I think I should start this year’s 
statement by commending David, 
on behalf of the whole board, on 
his first year as Chief Executive of 
Patsystems. In 2006, we have delivered 
full-year results in line with market 
expectations, while also reshaping  
the business to provide a stronger  
base going forward.
Pre-tax profit, under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), for 
the full year ended 31 December 2006 
was £1.63 million compared to £0.36 
million in 2005. Cash flows from 
operating activities also grew to £2.69 
million from £0.84 million in 2005.
This growth in profit has justified the 
Board’s confidence for 2006 that we 
expressed within the last annual report 
and accounts.
I am particularly pleased that in 
2006 we achieved 12 trading system 
software installations globally, some 
for new customers and some for 
existing ones, compared to none in 
2005. This indicates the solid base that 
management has built for Patsystems 
going forward into 2007 and beyond.
As described in greater detail within 
the Chief Executive’s Review, we have 
achieved the goals we set at the start 
of 2006 for establishing new user 
communities for both the Pro-Mark 
professional trading screen and the Risk 
Informer real-time risk margining product. 
We anticipate further growth from both 
Pro-Mark and Risk Informer in 2007. 
We have also completed the 
development of our new back-end 
platform. The new platform supports 
global 24-hour trading and provides 
our customers with a single global 
view of the status of their order book. 
Currently two of our tier-one 
customers have signed contracts and 
scheduled their upgrades to the new 
platform for 2007. A further three 
customers are currently discussing the 
timing of their own implementations.
At the start of 2006, we believed that 
we had a strong product suite and are 
even more confident now. The successful 
integration of Tamesis within Patsystems 
also bodes well for the future.

Non-Executive 
Director 
I think I should start this year’s 
statement by commending 
David on his first year as Chief 
Executive of Patsystems.
Chairman’s Statement Turning to customers, I am delighted 
that we have strengthened our 
presence in Asia with new and existing 
customers. More particularly, we have 
extended our geographical presence 
in the region by being the first 
Independent Software Vendor (ISV) 
to sell a trading and risk system into 
mainland China through our contract 
with China Foreign Exchange Trade 
System (CFETS), a subsidiary of China’s 
Central Bank: People’s Bank of China.
DIVIDEND
As a tangible way to demonstrate its 
confidence in Patsystems’ commercial 
and financial strength, the Board is 
pleased to recommend the payment of 
an inaugural dividend to shareholders, 
based on the results for 2006. The 
Board proposes the payment of a 
dividend of 0.3p per ordinary share, 
subject to confirmation at the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM), to be paid on 
the 25 May 2007 to shareholders on 
the register as at 27 April 2007. The 
shares are expected to be quoted ex 
dividend on 25 April 2007.
MANAGEMENT  
Under David Webber and Martin 
Thorneycroft’s leadership as the two 
Executive Directors, the achievements 
in 2006 have been accomplished with 
minimal turnover in senior personnel 
and no major changes in strategy. 
Only one member of the Executive 
Management Committee (EMC) has 
changed, with Kieron O’Toole joining 
at the start of 2007, replacing Martin 
Coen. The Chief Executive’s report 
details the EMC and their respective 
responsibilities.
The stability in the senior team is 
mirrored in the rest of Patsystems. This 
is pleasing in itself and enables us to 
provide our customers with continuity 
in both technical know-how and our 
day-to-day relationships.
BOARD
It is with sadness and gratitude, that 
we announced on 25 September 
the planned retirement of Stewart 
Douglas-Mann from the Board after 
the 2007 AGM. Stewart has been a 
Director with Patsystems for seven

our ever-changing

years through some of the most 
challenging periods of its history. I 
often think that without his resilience 
Patsystems might not have been 
able to achieve its present status and 
strength. As he can now observe the 
positive fruits of his efforts, I thank 
him warmly on behalf of everyone 
involved with the Company.
Arun Aggarwal also decided to 
stand down from our Board at the 
end of 2006, due to increasing time 
commitments following his promotion 
to Head of Consultancy, EMEA at Tata 
Consultancy Services. His input has 
been valuable and much appreciated.
To replace such accomplished Non-
executive Directors, we have been 
fortunate to add two new Board 
colleagues, from whose experience we  
are already benefiting.
Steve Sparke joined our Board on 
25 September 2006 bringing with him 
a wealth of business and technology 
knowledge of the futures industry 
from an 18 year career with UBS, 
most recently as their Global Head of 
Futures & Options.
John Priestley joined the Board on 
1 January 2007. John has built a long 
and successful career in the IT and 
software industry, most recently 
with British Telecommunications 
plc, including the role of Director of 
Business Development for Syntegra.
FUTURE
Trading since 31 December 2006 has 
continued in line with business plans 
and the Board remains comfortable 
with current market expectations for 
2007 and, early though it is, 2008.
Despite continuing consolidation 
within our market place, with Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) proposed 
acquisition of Chicago Board of Trade 
(CBOT), and Calyon Financial’s and 
Société Générale’s planned merger of 
The Board remains comfortable  
with current market expectations  
for 2007, and early though it is, 2008.
Chairman’s Statement continued their futures brokerage activities as two 
examples, we believe that opportunities 
remain good for the business.
As well as continued success 
promoting our existing products,  
we expect further opportunities to 
arise for us in new derivative asset 
classes; in cash based products and  
in foreign exchange.
CUSTOMERS, STAFF AND 
SHAREHOLDERS
I would like to thank all of our 
customers, and our partners, for their 
continued support during the year. An 
important factor behind our success 
this year has been our customers’ 
willingness to trust us to help create 
further business success for them. We 
take that responsibility very seriously 
and I hope and believe we have 
discharged it well.
I would also like to thank all the 
management and employees of 
Patsystems for their focus and 
energy. We started the year with 
the inevitable upheaval of a 
change in Chief Executive and they 
have responded to that change 
with the utmost commitment and 
professionalism. The positive results 
are there for all to see.
Finally, on behalf of Patsystems, I 
would like to thank our shareholders 
for their continued support. We look 
forward to their continued association 
with us as the company and business 
continue to develop.

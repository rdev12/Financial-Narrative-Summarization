 Results
Despite the difficult times experienced by the UK
economy in 2009, Dignity has delivered its fifth
consecutive period of growth as a public company.
Underlying operating profits have increased 8 per cent to
£56.4 million (2008: £52.1 million). Underlying earnings
per share have increased 6 per cent to 40.5 pence per
share (2008: 38.2 pence per share). The rate of earnings
per share growth is lower than operating profit growth
because of the dilutive effect of the reduced bank interest
receivable in 2009.
This performance is attributable to progress in each 
aspect of the Group’s strategy, which is explained further
throughout this report. 
Dividends
The Board has proposed that a final dividend of 8.07
pence per Ordinary Share should be paid from profits
generated in 2009. This will be paid on 25 June 2010 to
members on the register at close of business on 28 May
2010 provided shareholder consent is obtained at the
Annual General Meeting on 4 June 2010.
This will result in a total dividend of 12.1 pence per
Ordinary Share (2008: 11.0 pence per Ordinary Share) in
respect of profits generated in 2009. This represents an
increase of 10 per cent and is consistent with the rate 
of increase made in each year since flotation.
The Board
I am delighted that James Newman and Bill Forrester have
agreed to remain as Non-Executive Directors for a further
two years following the expiration of their contracts on 
31 March 2010. Consequently, there are no changes to 
the Board and I thank each of my fellow Directors for their
commitment and support during the year.
Our people
This is a business dedicated to providing each family 
we serve with excellent client service. Whilst this requires
continued investment in our properties and our fleet, at 
its core is our staff. 
I would like to thank all members of staff for their individual
contributions during the year which help to make Dignity
such a successful Group.
Outlook for 2010
The current year has started well and the Group’s
performance is in line with the Board’s expectations. 
The first quarter of 2010 is expected to be more consistent
with the average of the last five years than was the case
last year when there was an unusually high number of
deaths in the first quarter.
The outlook for the full year remains positive.

 6 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 2007
Introduction by the Chairman
Record revenue growth
Results 
I am delighted to report that Intertek
performed strongly in 2007, demonstrating
the effectiveness of our business model and
strategy. Revenue increased to £775.4m, up
a record 16.7% over last year. This was
achieved despite the average exchange rate
for the US dollar being nearly 9% weaker
against sterling, which reduced reported
revenue when translated into sterling. 
Operating profit was £116.1m, up 18.3%
over last year. Operating profit before the
amortisation of intangible assets arising on
acquisitions and impairment of goodwill
(‘adjusted operating profit’) increased to
£121.6m, up 19.0%. Our adjusted
operating margin increased by 30 basis
points to 15.7%.
At constant exchange rates, revenue and
adjusted operating profit grew 22.5% and
27.2% respectively, and on a like-for-like
basis, organic revenue and adjusted
operating profit increased by 13.0% and
15.2% respectively, reflecting the strong
growth in our underlying businesses. 
Acquisitions
We completed 16 acquisitions in 2007 for
total consideration of £100.0m (2006: £36.9m).
Details of the acquisitions are given in the
business review by division. We continue 
to see many opportunities to acquire
businesses in our chosen industry sectors
and so far in 2008 we have completed 
for total consideration of £17.5m, five
acquisitions which further widen the 
scope and range of the services we offer.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 46.7p, up 14.2%
over last year. Diluted adjusted earnings 
per share, before amortisation of intangibles
arising on acquisitions and impairment of
goodwill were 49.7p, up 15.0%. 
Dividends
An interim dividend of 5.8p per share 
(2006: 4.6p) was paid to shareholders on 
13 November 2007. The Directors will propose
a final dividend of 12.2p per share at the
Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2008, 
to be paid on 19 June 2008 to shareholders
on the register at close of business on 
6 June 2008. If approved, this will make 
a full year dividend of 18.0p per share
(2006: 14.8p), an increase of 21.6%. 
This is in line with our dividend policy and
reflects the good performance of the Group.
As announced in our last Annual Report, 
our intention is to pay an annual dividend
that is covered at least two and a half times
by earnings. 
Board changes
As previously announced, after 34 years
with the Group, Raymond Kong retired on
11 May 2007. I would like to express my
deep gratitude to him, on behalf of his
fellow Directors, employees and customers,
for his outstanding contribution towards
building the Consumer Goods division into
the successful business it is today and for 
his excellent contribution to the Board, on
which he served for the past three years. 
We wish him a happy and healthy retirement.
On 1 January 2008, Mark Loughead joined
the Intertek Board as Executive Director 
and Chief Operating Officer for the Group.
Mark was previously Executive Vice President
of our Oil, Chemical & Agri division and 
has 30 years experience in the industry, 
19 of which have been with Intertek. 
I congratulate and welcome Mark and 
look forward to his pursuit of opportunities
to increase our growth and value for our
customers and shareholders.

Employees 
The growth reflected in this strong set of
results has been delivered by the dedication
and expertise of the Group’s employees 
in providing value to our customers. At the
end of 2007, the Group employed over
21,300 people in 110 countries, an increase
of 3,100 people over last year. Almost 900
new employees joined the Group in the
businesses that we acquired in the year. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to
welcome all new employees to Intertek 
and to thank all our employees around the
world for their commitment to making 2007
such a successful year.
Climate change
Intertek is committed to play an important
and positive role with respect to climate
change. We advise our clients as an integral
part of our business, on many issues which
have an impact on the environment, such as
the chemical content of their products and
packaging, the energy efficiency of their
equipment, CO
2
emissions and the disposal
of harmful substances and waste electrical
products. We also provide advisory and
consultancy services to help retailers and
manufacturers design their products and
services to comply with current and future
environmental regulations around the world.
Through our services we help our clients 
to minimise the environmental impact of
their products for the benefit of society 
as a whole. We are also mindful of our own
impact on the environment and are working
on various initiatives to reduce this. This is
discussed further in the Corporate Social
Responsibility Report on pages 25 to 29. 
Organisation changes
In 2008, we are dividing our four operating
divisions into seven. This reflects the growth
and change in composition of our business,
particularly in the Oil, Chemical & Agri
division which will be split into three to
better support the needs of our customers.
Each division will build on the strong
foundations already in place to grow both
organically and through strategic
acquisitions. This new structure and the
dedication of our management and
employees will enable us to concentrate on
developing our business sectors to create
value for our customers and shareholders.
Outlook
Demand for Intertek’s services is driven by
product variety and innovation, growth in
regulatory requirements and standards, and
increasing environmental awareness, as well
as global trade and the drive to increase
quality and safety. Therefore, our growth
drivers are not directly correlated to total
consumer or business expenditure, which
means we are well placed to withstand a
global economic slowdown. Indeed, our
services can help our customers remain
competitive in more challenging market
conditions. Furthermore, we are also very
well diversified, both geographically and
across industry sectors, which would help
mitigate any impact in the event of an
economic downturn.
We expect 2008 to be another good year
for Intertek.

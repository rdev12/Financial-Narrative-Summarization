We LOVE food at Premier Foods. We’re one of Britain’s biggest food companies with a broad 
stable of leading brands; brands that you can find in around 96% of British households and 
which we are starting to bring to new international markets. Many of our brands have been part of 
daily life for more than a century. But we don’t let them stand still — we’re constantly innovating 
with fresh ideas, giving our consumers great tasting food for modern life.

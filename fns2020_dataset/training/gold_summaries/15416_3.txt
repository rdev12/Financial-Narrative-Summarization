global divisions: Speciality Food 
Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients.
These two divisions are supported by our

and other global functions.
We have operations in over 30 locations, including 
our manufacturing facilities, such as our two scale 
SPLENDA

 Sucralose facilities in Singapore and 
the US, and our network of corn wet mills in 
Europe and the US, which are shared by the two 
divisions to make our corn-based products. We 
have also built a global network of customer-facing 
facilities allowing us to collaborate with customers 
wherever they are located, including our global 
innovation hub, the Commercial and Food

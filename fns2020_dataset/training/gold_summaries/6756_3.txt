 I am pleased to have been asked to join the 
board of Gooch & Housego PLC, a long
established and successful Group with exciting
prospects for the future.  I believe that I can make
a positive contribution and look forward to helping
the Group to achieve its considerable potential.
Although I joined the board after the end of the 2006 financial year I
am pleased to note the encouraging results that follow on from
similar growth in revenues and profits in the previous two years.
The excellent performances by NEOS and CCI are particularly
noteworthy.  Most of the growth has come from core activities and
reflects the strengths the Group has in these areas.  Sustaining this
level of growth in the longer term will require the Group to diversify
its products and markets.  A first step has been made with the
acquisition of CDI and further investment is planned in 2007 to
evaluate the potential of its technology. 
The Group is making a substantial investment in people, facilities and infrastructure in the coming
year to underpin future growth.  I would like to thank all of our employees for their contribution to
an excellent set of results. We clearly have an excellent workforce and top quality products and I
look forward to the continuing success of the Group.

 At the beginning of 2004 I set out an
important new phase in our strategy, as
we began to reach the scale of
operations envisaged at the time we ﬁrst
came to the public market. This new
phase, designed to build on our position
as the UK’s largest provider of student
accommodation, focused on three core
themes: enhancing the quality of our
investment portfolio whilst maintaining an
annual programme of steady but
signiﬁcant portfolio growth; enhancing
our customer service through the
development and training of our people
and market research; and restructuring
our capital base whilst continuing the
strong operating performance of the
business and improving margins. 
With this in mind, I am delighted to report
on a year of strong performance.
net asset value per share grew by 
10.0% to 332p (2003: 5.6% growth, 
302p);
our asset disposals and joint ventures,
involving in total some £173 million of
assets (based on estimated values at
completion), have helped ﬁrmly
establish our asset class in the broader
investment community and have
provided much needed transactional
evidence for the market;
full year pre tax losses (before 
goodwill amortisation) reduced sharply 
to £1.1 million from £5.2 million in 2003.
Financial results
Net asset value remains the key indicator
to the value of our business. At 332p per
share as at 31 December 2004 (2003:
302p), this has grown by 10% during the
year, driven predominantly by our
continued development activity. 
Staying true to our clear strategy
Chairman’s statement
As the UK's largest provider of student
accommodation services we are committed to
delivering continued growth within our
development portfolio whilst ensuring we
continually seek to improve our understanding
of, and services to, our customers.
Annual Report 2004 05
Geoffrey Maddrell
Chairman
During the year the business successfully
delivered 5,104 new bed spaces into our
investment portfolio and also increased
the number of conﬁrmed deliveries for
2005 to 4,677 beds (including assets held
in joint ventures) with another 5,759 beds
also secured and fully funded for delivery
in 2006 and beyond. Pipeline visibility
remains a key strength of the business.
Taking into account the new beds
delivered during the year, our completed
and managed portfolio grew by 24% to
26,319 bed spaces, and was valued at
£991 million as at 31 December 2004,
excluding 1,246 beds sold to Morley
during the year and now managed on
their behalf. Rental income for the year
was up 39% to £66.8 million, again due
mainly to the larger portfolio, but also
reﬂecting strong like-for-like revenue
growth (6.8% between academic years
2003/04 and 2004/05).

8126 UNITE A\R 64pp Interior  18/4/05  11:26  Page 5 Operating proﬁts from the completed
portfolio were up 41% to £41 million,
growth at this level outpacing turnover
growth as a result of continued scale
beneﬁts and asset stabilisation. This is
reﬂected in our operating margin which,
adjusted for the lease cost element of the
sale and leaseback transaction with
Morley, again increased, to 62.1% up
from 60.5% for 2003. 
New borrowing associated with our
continued development activity
contributed to an increase in net debt 
to £731 million and an increase in 
our balance sheet gearing to 198% 
(31 December 2003: 182%). Importantly,
however, this level of gearing has not
increased when compared to that as at
30 June 2004 (199%); the Group has
begun to demonstrate its ability to
manage its gearing through asset
disposals and joint ventures whilst
continuing to grow its portfolio. 
This higher level of borrowing resulted in
an increase in the Group’s interest costs.
Although average gearing during the year
increased by 40%, portfolio interest cover
was largely maintained at 1.11 times
(2003: 1.15 times). Taking the
aforementioned items into account,
portfolio proﬁt increased marginally to
£4.0 million from £3.9 million in 2003. 
Finally, the introduction of joint ventures,
coupled with the sale of certain non core
parts of larger development sites, has
introduced a new element to the Group’s
proﬁt and loss account. These activities
contributed £1.2 million to the Group’s
proﬁt before interest and tax in 2004 a
contribution to proﬁts from this source
stream is expected to continue in 
the future.
Dividend
In accordance with our stated policy, the
Board is pleased to recommend a ﬁnal
dividend of 1.67 pence per share, making
a total dividend of 2.5 pence per share for
the year (2003: 2.5 pence). The dividend
will be paid on 13 May 2005 to
shareholders on the register as at 15
April 2005. 
Business performance
Our 26,319 bed portfolio of completed
accommodation (2003: 21,215 beds)
remains in demand, as evidenced by our
average occupancy rate of 95% of
available rooms entering the 2004/05
academic year (2003: 96%) and the
strong like-for-like revenue growth of 6.8%
achieved in the current academic year. 
UNITE is committed to growing its
portfolio through continued development
and has built up a wealth of expertise and
a strong reputation with both land owners
and local planning authorities in this area
over the past 12 years. As a result,
despite a challenging development
market, site availability remains generally
good; we continue to work well in
partnership with planning authorities to
deliver new high quality schemes, whilst
our overall target development margins
have been achieved.
Set against this background is our
development pipeline of some 10,436
beds. All of these beds are fully funded
and will contribute greatly to the overall
quality of our future investment portfolio.
We have remained successful in
combating build cost inﬂation through our
investment in modular construction and
through contractor partnering. Inﬂationary
pressures in this area continue but,
despite this, we expect to be able to
contain any future reduction in
development margins to a small and
manageable level.
The performance of our modular
construction division during 2004 has
been encouraging. It exceeded its
production volume target for the year,
achieving overall output of some 2,530
modules together with the associated
componentry. At these levels of
production the facility is fully competitive
with traditional construction. In the more
benign inﬂationary environment of the
manufacturing sector, and with production
volumes expected to increase further in
2005, this division is well positioned for
further improvements in performance. 
Market conditions
Market conditions in 2004 were, and
remain, positive for UNITE both in terms of
student occupier demand and our evolving
asset class. In the UK higher education
sector, student numbers continue to grow,
with increased demand both from UK
domiciled students and from international
students seeking to beneﬁt from the strong
reputation of our University system. As
importantly, the strong commercial property
market and the resulting yield compression
across the more traditional asset classes
has brought alternative investment options,
such as student accommodation, into
sharper relief for investors. Against a back-
drop which now sees the reference
Investment Property Databank (‘IPD’) initial
yield substantially below 6%, the average
initial yield across our portfolio of 6.56%
looks increasingly attractive. 
Customers
As the UK’s largest student landlord, 
UNITE has a responsibility to all its
stakeholders to ensure that it continually
seeks to improve its understanding of, and
services to, its customers.
We fully recognise the fact that our success
is reliant on continuing to provide a high
quality, affordable accommodation
experience and we have introduced a
number of important initiatives during the
course of the year to this effect. This
includes the introduction of broadband
technology across the estate and increased
stafﬁng resource at the property level. Some
of these initiatives have impacted slightly on
margins for 2004 but will start to deliver
positive improvements in the short term.
People
During 2004 we continued our focus on
personal and professional development and
the strengthening and deepening of
UNITE’s management team. We were able
to make internal promotions, supported by
succession planning and intensive
management development. This included
promoting two internal candidates to lead
two of our operating divisions. 
Our investment in training for the business
as a whole has had a signiﬁcant impact
on improving customer service and
motivating staff.

 Chief Executive’s Review
CML continued the strong momentum
built up in previous years with another
excellent performance producing an
operating profit at £1.8 million (2007:
£1.6 million). With a book to bill ratio of
1.14:1, the 12 month order book at 
31 March 2008 is healthy, standing at
£10.5 million (2007: £8.6 million).
Intelek had a strong year in 2007/08
advancing on all fronts. Improved
margins at Paradise Datacom, a return
to profitability at Labtech Microwave
and a further increase in operational
efficiency at CML were the main factors
behind a 41% growth in underlying
profit before tax of £3.3 million. The
increase in earnings enabled the Group
to reduce net debt by £1.3 million to
£3.9 million. 
2007/08 was an excellent year for
Paradise Datacom with operating
profit up 7% at £3.2 million (2007:
£3.0 million). As the business operates in
the global satellite communications
market where the US dollar is the
prevailing currency, the operating profit
would have increased by a further 10% or
£0.3 million but for the weakening of the
US dollar against sterling. While dollar
sales of solid state power amplifiers
(SSPAs) increased, modem sales were
down on the previous year which had
benefited from some one off contracts
such as a $1.5 million project for China.
Labtech Microwave produced an
operating profit in 2007/08 of £0.2
million which was a turnaround of 
£0.7 million on the previous year’s
operating loss of £0.5 million. This
recovery was largely as a result of the
combination of an increased focus on
specialist microwave components and
circuit board packaged solutions and
the restructuring of the business which
was implemented at the beginning of
the financial year.

Paradise Datacom, with facilities in
Essex, UK and Pennsylvania, USA,
produces an extensive line of solid
state power amplifiers and modem
products used in the Satellite
Communications Industry. The
worldwide satellite communications
equipment market is estimated to be
currently $28 billion, of which our
current addressable sector is $400
million. Paradise Datacom is now
becoming recognised as a significant
player worldwide. 
Satellite communications equipment is
used extensively on a global basis to
provide internet, video, voice and data
services for corporations, governments
and the general population. Paradise
Datacom’s products are incorporated in
all facets of Satcoms from credit card
authorisation services to ruggedised
military applications. Solid State Power
Amplifiers (SSPAs) are used in the
majority of satellite ground station
terminals and Paradise Datacom
produces a wide range of products to
service this market segment. In
addition, the business produces
satellite modems which are designed to
provide high capacity connections from
multiple locations to centralised hub
stations. GSM back haul services,
internet trunking services, military
communications, HDTV broadcast,
disaster monitoring and weather
forecasting services are some of the
market segments in which Paradise
Datacom products are applied.
Satellite communications is unique
compared with cable, microwave and
other technologies in that global
coverage can be initiated almost
instantaneously by just installing small
but powerful earth station terminals.
These types of terminals which
incorporate Paradise Datacom
products are used where rapid
deployment of video, voice and data
services are essential in remote
locations with weak or no
communications infrastructure.
In an increasingly global economy,
satellite communications will continue
to grow to meet the
telecommunications needs of
corporations and governments.
Paradise Datacom’s Evolution modems
are designed to transmit duplex data
signals at rates up to 55 mega-bits per
second. These modems utilise the
latest firmware device technology and
are rich with features currently in
demand by government and
commercial markets worldwide. These
features include their proprietary
MultiMux enabling service providers to
combine multiple signal formats, which
provide unprecedented support of
hybrid networks and migration to
newer technologies such as IP.
Customers are able to minimise capital
expenditure with Paradise Datacom's
built-in network diagnostics features
that eliminate the need for expensive
test instruments. Further savings are
realised by utilising the Quad E-1
option which allows one modem to
function as four. 
Paradise Datacom’s RF product range
is one of the most extensive available
in the industry. It consists of Solid
State Power Amplifiers (SSPAs) with
output power levels from 8 watts to
1,100 watts, Block Up Converter
modules (BUCs) and Low-Noise
Amplifiers (LNAs).
The new Vision 80 modem for high definition TV broadcast
Chief Executive’s Review continued

Intelek 
Report and Accounts 2008 Paradise Datacom ended 2007/08 with an
impressive financial performance on
slightly lower US dollar turnover. Year on
year turnover in sterling terms reduced by
9.8%, while trading profit and operational
cash flow improved by 7.4% and 17.4%
respectively. Trading profit benefited from
improved margins due to cost-reduced
product designs and tight control of
overheads. 
In US dollar terms, the amplifier business
remained robust with turnover improving
by 1.8% year on year. However, on a
similar basis, our modem sales reduced by
9.4% on the previous year which had
benefited from some one-off contracts. In
addition, the cost of space segment was
substantially increased by the various
satellite operators, slowing the
procurement of satellite modems while
technology trade-offs were investigated by
potential customers.
During the year under review, Paradise
Datacom continued the implementation of
several key initiatives designed to increase
its market share. On the sales and
marketing front, key sales personnel were
recruited in the USA and plans to establish
permanent facilities in Asia were
advanced, leading to the opening of a
Bangkok office in April 2008. The business
will continue to focus sales and
promotional efforts on emerging markets
such as China, India and Russia. 
Paradise Datacom continues to invest in
research and development with
expenditure in 2007/08 at 11.7% of sales.
As a consequence of one of these
programmes, Paradise Datacom has
entered the video broadcast market with
the development of the Vision 80 modem
designed around the global digital video
broadcasting transmission standard (DVB
S-2). This development is an overlay to the
existing Evolution modem platform. The
Vision 80 offers features and performance
far beyond any competing product in its
price range. It is anticipated that the Vision
80, which is targeted at the emerging High
Definition TV (HDTV) market, will
contribute to sales in the first half of the
current financial year. In parallel with the
new Vision 80 modem, a military version of
the Evolution modem has been developed
to enable participation in US government
programmes that require product
compliant to military specification.
Increasing market demand for high-power
SSPA system architectures based on
modularity and switch-less redundancy
drove the launch of our most ambitious RF
product development to date. This
product, branded PowerMax, incorporates
cutting-edge technologies to deliver the
highest levels of RF power available in the
industry. PowerMax is scheduled for
release in the first half of the 2008/09
financial year. In addition to the PowerMax
product, Paradise Datacom has started
delivering its much-anticipated vBUC
range of medium power amplifiers. Both
these new RF products are developed for
substantial sectors of the market not
previously addressed by Paradise
Datacom.

Key Performance Indicators
Three key ratios for each of the operating
companies have been selected to highlight
performance movement in the last three years with
brief explanatory comments where necessary.
(a) The sales per head ratio declined slightly due
to the weaker US dollar and volume changes 
to sales, as noted.
(b) Stock turns and ROCE improved through
production efficiencies and higher average
margins, with Paradise Datacom generating
near 100% return on assets invested.
% Growth in the satellite communications
market is partly predicated upon the
availability and cost of space segment
(transponder bandwidth) to support new
services and expansion of existing
networks. Transponder prices have
increased as a result of consolidation
among the large satellite operators and
launch failures that prevented a number of
new commercial satellites from entering
service. As space segment is the highest
single operational expense for any satellite
based service provider, de mand for
spectrum-saving technologies is at an all-
time high. In response, Paradise Datacom
is working on an enhancement, scheduled
for release in mid-2009, which will increase
the spectral efficiency of an Evolution
modem by up to 50%.
This decade so far has seen
unprecedented spending by Western
governments to provide state-of-the-art
communications capabilities to their
military forces in the field, notably in
Afghanistan and Iraq. One key award in
2007/08 was for the supply of Paradise
Datacom’s Evolution modems as part of a
communications project in Afghanistan.
We anticipate continued spending in these
areas, with increasing emphasis on the
refurbishment of ageing, legacy networks.
A potentially large US government
programme involving the supply of
medium-power SSPAs was awarded to
Paradise Datacom in 2005 but was placed
on hold in 2006. This programme was
reinstated in 2007, contributing $680,000
of sales in the financial year to 31 March
2008, and expanded from the original C
and Ku-band fixed earth station
requirement to include multi-band flyaway
terminals. Also, following a period of
rigorous testing of our SSPA products, a
branch of the US military began the
purchase of Paradise amplifiers replacing
old Travelling Wave Tube Amplifiers
(TWTAs). Replacement of TWTAs with
solid state power amplifiers is a growing
trend as they are more compact and
robust.
The successful deployment of the first of a
series of Gapfiller satellites by the US
government guarantees significant
demand for X and Ka-band RF products.
Extensive work by the RF engineering
team at Paradise Datacom has resulted in
feature and performance refinements to
the X-band product line and the initial
launch of a line of Ka-band products.
Paradise Datacom has also begun
supplying compact outdoor SSPAs to a
US maritime systems integrator for
shipboard IP terminals to support the
cruise line industry. The first dozen units
have already been shipped as part of a
total requirement of 100 amplifiers to be
delivered by the end of September 2008.
In addition, a major telecoms service
provider in Alaska has selected Paradise
Datacom to supply SSPAs for their rural
telephone network expansion. 
Environmental protection is and will
continue to be a focus area for Paradise
Datacom. As an example, Paradise
Datacom was one of the first companies
within the industry to convert to lead-free
components. The business is conscious of
the need to ensure safe working
conditions for all staff and to minimise its
impact on the environment. 
Paradise Datacom continues to
aggressively look forward and target key
markets and customers by developing
differentiating products and by expanding
its international reach. Even in the midst of
uncertain global economic conditions we
continue to push forward and are
confident of market share gains.

Intelek 
Report and Accounts 2007
Focusing Labtech Microwave on the
defence market and the specialist
higher margin areas of the
telecommunications market enabled a
substantial improvement in operating
profit compared with the previous
financial year. Although, as anticipated,
overall sales reduced by £0.4 million,
the margin improvement and cost
benefits from restructuring the printed
circuit board activity early in the year
enabled an operating profit
improvement of £0.7 million. As
expected, sales activity was subdued in
the first half of the financial year, but the
predicted break even result was
obtained. During the second half,
activity levels picked up and Labtech
Microwave returned to profit.
Important contract wins in the European
AESA (active electronically scanned
array) radar market increased the
activity levels of both sites progressively
through the year. AESA radars are
becoming the preferred alternative for
commercial and military use as a result
of AESA radar technology offering
significant weight and cost reductions
together with increases in capability
when compared with mechanically
steered radars. The total annual market
is estimated at £2 billion, and is
expected to grow at approximately 20%
p.a. Labtech Microwave’s addressable
portion of this market is estimated at
£80 million. The multilayer printed circuit
boards are manufactured at the
Presteigne site and then assembled and
tested at the Milton Keynes location.
This overall capability has proved to
have significant market appeal with
Labtech Microwave now becoming
involved in several key European AESA
programmes. 
Labtech Microwave has also been very
active in other areas of the defence
market. Following the receipt of a
significant order for various detector log
video amplifiers (DLVAs) from a major
European defence OEM at the end of last
year, the business has now demonstrated
an enhanced capability making it a
leading European supplier of high
specification DLVAs. These components
are used as part of an electronic
surveillance system to detect incoming
threats, requiring nano-second response
times to trigger defensive solutions.

High precision, nickel-gold 
plated microwave circuit
Following a steep decline in Labtech
Microwave’s telecommunication market
activities in the previous year, 2007/08
proved to be more stable as the focus
was primarily on the higher margin
digital radio link circuits. Labtech
Microwave’s capabilities remain in
demand for the very high-end products
and the smaller radio link suppliers who
value the business’s more complete
service offering.
Labtech Microwave also continues to
develop and promote its monolithic
microwave integrated circuits (MMIC)
packaging and assembly capability. High
performance packages and circuits
utilising liquid crystal polymer substrates
are growing in demand as they perform
particularly well at the high millimetre-
wave frequencies (e.g. 60GHz and
94GHz) which are used for broadband
high capacity radio links and the rapidly
growing security detection market.
The business continues to pursue other
microwave markets as it moves away
from the commodity driven telecom
business. As already indicated, defence
is now a major market area for Labtech
Microwave. Other areas of activity
include satellite communications, space,
air traffic control radar and marine radar.
The growing high frequency Ka-Band
satcom market utilises Labtech
Microwave’s high precision circuit board
processing capability and this proved to
be consistently in demand throughout
the year. Labtech Microwave has also
used its comprehensive manufacturing
capabilities to produce high
performance microwave circuits
incorporating thermal heat sinks for the
high power solid state amplifier market
where Paradise Datacom is a key
customer.
During the year further investment was
made in high precision drilling and
profiling machines which are essential
for the new generations of products
being developed by Labtech
Microwave.
Going forward, Labtech Microwave
continues to develop its business model
to enable it to become an integrated
supplier of specialist microwave circuits,
assembled circuits and fully designed,
manufactured and tested microwave
components. Although the phasing of
current production programmes means
trading in the first half of the new
financial year will be subdued, it is
anticipated that activity will increase
during the second half of the year and
beyond as further defence production
programmes commence.
Labtech Microwave remains committed
to the highest levels of husbandry of the
local environment and care of
employees. The company takes
considerable care to minimise waste,
use valuable resources efficiently and
prevent damage to the environment.
Both sites at Labtech Microwave are
approved to the International
Environmental Standard ISO 14001. Chief Executive’s Review continued

CML manufactures precision-
machined aluminium and titanium,
composite and sheet metal
components and assemblies for
aerostructures and aircraft systems. Its
customers include Airbus UK, BAe
Systems, GKN Aerospace, Hawker
Beechcraft, GE Aviation and Westland
Helicopters.
The group has four divisions located
on two sites in Birkenhead in the North
West of England.
The Precision Machining Division is
focused on 4 and 5-axis machining of
aluminium and hard metals. Principal
products, covering almost the full
range of Airbus commercial and
military aircraft, include interspar ribs
and ancillary components; landing
gear rib supports, sidestay fittings and
links; underwing access panels; engine
thrust fittings; and aft mounting
brackets. Components for military and
rotary wing aircraft are also supplied to
other customers.
The Composites Division specialises in
the manufacture and repair of glass
and carbon fibre components and
assemblies. Products include various
wing and fuselage fairings, covers, and
panels, nose and tail cone assemblies,
air conditioning ducts, flooring, etc.
The largest new build programme is
the Hawker 800-series business jet,
whilst spares and other new build
requirements are supplied for a variety
of civil, business and military aircraft
programmes.
The Fabrications Division’s two main
revenue streams are from the
manufacture of extruded fuselage and
wing stringers for the Hawker 800-
series build programme and from its
position as a key supplier of sheet
metal spare parts for the Airbus in-
service fleet. 
The Treatments Division provides a
comprehensive in-house surface

CML performed well in 2007/08 with an
improvement in operating profit of 12%
over the previous financial year on an
increase in sales of 10%. Despite
pricing pressures from both customers
and suppliers, through a programme of
continuous improvement and tight
control of overheads, CML has
increased the return on sales to 13.8%
(2007: 13.5%) maintaining a very
respectable return on capital employed
of 43% (2007: 46%).
Build rates for our major programme
(Airbus A320) continued to increase with
the consequence that investment in
additional capacity for the Precision
Machining Division will be required in
the first half of the new financial year.
Turnover for the Fabrications Division
grew by a further 16% this year on the
back of strong demand for current
programmes and the additional
requirements for in-service spares which
accounted for 30% of Fabrications
sales. The Treatments Division
continues to provide excellent service in
support of the other three divisions
whilst increasing third party sales by
some 21%.
A strong performance was achieved in
the Composites Division with sales up
by 28% on the previous financial year.
Throughout the year, this division has
seen build rates increase from key
customers such as Airbus and Hawker
Beechcraft with demand forecasted to
continue at a high level. CML has a firm
base from which to develop further its
composites capacity and capability. To
this end, the management team has
been strengthened with the
appointment of a dedicated Composites

As part of the strategy going forward,
CML is looking to diversify further into
military programmes. This will create a
greater balance to complement the high
levels of sales to the commercial and
business jet sectors. CML has invested
in an upgrade of their Autoclave and
Clean Room facilities to meet the
exacting standards required by BAe
Systems for the supply of composite
components for the F35 Joint Strike

now been received. 
In September 2007, CML achieved
accreditation to the ISO 14001
environmental standard and, with
support from the Carbon Trust, CML is
committed to reduce its carbon footprint
over the coming year through the
implementation of energy saving
projects. 
Looking forward, the company is
focusing on training and developing
staff to support continuous
improvement activities throughout the
business. In addition, CML will invest
selectively in equipment to increase
capacity and to support the aerospace
industry’s migration towards the
increased use of lightweight carbon
structures and titanium (hard metal).
These actions will stand the company in
good stead for the future. 
Notwithstanding the current economic
situation, build rates going forward are
showing strong growth, particularly for
CML’s largest customers such as
Airbus, Hawker Beechcraft and GKN.  www.intelek.plc.uk 17
The Board can take considerable
comfort and confidence for the future
from the encouraging progress and
achievements in the year under review.
However, we must undoubtedly be wary
of the current weakness in the US
commercial market and the knock-on
effect of the problems of the financial
sector.
 Paradise Datacom is undoubtedly
becoming a dynamic and
innovative force in the ground
equipment market for satellite
communications. Our technical
capability is now recognised not
only by our major competitors but
also by the global integrators and
their ultimate customers,
principally major government
departments. The release of our
new products significantly enlarges
our addressable markets, and our
investment in increased sales
resource, particularly in the West
Coast of America and in the Far
East, add a further significant
dimension to our product and
service offering.
 Although Labtech Microwave
carried out a successful
restructuring at the beginning of
2007/08, it is more their success
with the AESA radar circuits and
the DLVA product groups which
will ensure a return to growth in the
future. However, a move from
telecommunications to the defence
sector necessarily exposes
Labtech to the arena of larger
contract awards, the timing of
which are, by their nature, difficult
to predict. 2007/08 was an
encouraging step forward for
Labtech Microwave on a journey
which will result in that company
emerging as a niche microwave
component supplier for the
defence, commercial radar, satcom
and security markets.
 CML’s core Airbus A320 and
Hawker 800-series corporate jet
programmes have strong
production schedules for the next
few years. In addition, CML has
recently won approval to supply
Outlook
composite parts for the JSF
programme and is an existing
supplier of parts into the Airbus
A330 airframe used on the military
tanker aircraft. Therefore, CML
should be able to look forward with
confidence to a continuing period
of sustained and steady growth.
While there are some concerns over
Western economies, the initiatives
undertaken across the Group — to
enhance our product range, expand our
offering on key governmental
programmes and increase our
geographic coverage — will continue to
stand us in good stead and help us to
underpin our continued growth.

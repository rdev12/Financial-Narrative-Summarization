 Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic report: Executive Chairman’s statement 4
FUTURE 
GROWTH 
THROUGH 
RESILIENCE 
Challenging market backdrop 
Contrary to the predictions of many  
market participants, oil prices continued 
to slide throughout 2015. Oil & gas 
companies around the world reacted by 
gradual, and in some cases drastic, cuts  
to their capital expenditure. 
Lamprell is not immune to the oil sector 
headwinds but we are pleased to report 
on our demonstrated ability to withstand 
these challenges. Along with other energy 
industry contractors, we have seen delays 
in contract awards but we have taken steps 
to adapt by changing our approach to new 
business development. 
Maintaining a competitive position
In difficult times, companies often make  
the mistake of losing focus on their long-
term goals. Lamprell’s strong position 
allowed us to withstand the storm without 
compromising our future growth plans. 
We managed to remain competitive and 
continue to implement our strategy .
Similar to most of our peers, our pipeline 
conversion  page 8 was affected 
by project delays and cancellations. 
Nevertheless our bid-to-win ratio remained 
healthy by industry standards and this is 
an important factor indicating Lamprell’s 
strong competitive position. It gives comfort 
about our ability to recover from the difficult 
contracting environment. 
We also judge our strength by our  
ability to compete without undermining 
Lamprell’s financial performance or 
commercial position  page 20. In the 
context of increased pricing pressure, 
where numerous market players saw 
gradual margin erosion, we have been  
able to remain profitable. The gains 
delivered through Project Evolution  
 page 12 allowed us to protect our 
normalised margins whilst enabling  
us to offer attractive propositions in  
a tough market. 
This business flexibility and our strong 
client relationships have helped us maintain 
leadership in the jackup market, with a 
win of the ninth rig from National Drilling 
Company (“NDC”), one of only three 
jackup rig orders placed worldwide  
in 2015  page 25. 
Focus on the future
Whilst we are taking steps to ensure we 
successfully weather the current storm 
in the sector , we anticipate a recovery in 
the energy markets, as do most industry 
experts, and so we are also continuing 
to focus on our future. We have reviewed 
our strategy  page 14 for robustness, 
redirecting our marketing efforts from 
slower international regions around the 
world to the Middle East where we can 
leverage our position of strength. 
All 2015  
Board  
priorities  
achieved
2015 was an undeniably 
challenging year for our 
industry . We are proud  
that Lamprell was able to 
show resilience in a tough 
market environment and  
lay the groundwork for  
long-term growth.  Strategic report: Executive Chairman’s statement 5
As a Board, we have also spent 
considerable time assessing our  
medium-term positioning in the market  
and potential sources of growth for 
Lamprell. With this in mind, we have 
identified strategic partnerships as a 
potential route to a step-change in the 
scale of projects to target. In line with 
this plan, in January 2016 we announced 
a Memorandum of Understanding with 
Saudi Aramco, Bahri and Hyundai Heavy 
Industries regarding a potential partnership 
for collaboration on the Maritime Complex 
in Saudi Arabia. The discussions are still  
at an early stage, but this could become  
a sizeable business opportunity for 
Lamprell. I took on the responsibility 
of Executive Chairman to identify 
opportunities for strategic initiatives and 
other means to grow the business in an 
outward facing role. Our work on potential 
alliances continues, and we will update our 
shareholders on progress as appropriate. 
Strong Board 
In this endeavour , I have benefited from 
the support of a strong Board  page 36. 
Following the departure of Michael Press 
and the passing of Peter Whitbread  
during 2015, Lamprell has enhanced the 
Board’s independence and composition 
with the addition of two Directors with 
impressive experience and with Ellis 
Armstrong’s appointment as Senior 
Independent Director . Debra Valentine 
brings significant industry knowledge 
coupled with expertise in corporate 
transactions. Mel Fitzgerald is  
a seasoned executive with 30 years  
of industry experience. It was also  
pleasing to promote from within, with  
the appointment of Tony Wright to the 
Board in the role of Chief Financial  
Officer  page 20.
Lamprell’s Board will be completed with  
the recruitment of a new CEO following  
Jim Moffat’s announced retirement from the 
full-time CEO position in 2016. Lamprell will 
continue to benefit from Jim’s expertise for 
a year following his retirement but I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank him 
and the wider senior management team  
for their dedication and drive to secure  
a strong future for the Group.
I would also like to thank our shareholders 
for their support through these challenging 
times. The Board will continue to work 
tirelessly to deliver the strategy  page 14, 
firm in our belief in Lamprell’s future.

*Underlying is defined as excluding the impact of
goodwill amortisation and, for 2003, the disposal of
Westwind and integration costs. Your directors have recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 21.8p per share 
(2003 - 19.8p). Together with the interim dividend of 9.2p per share (2003
- 8.36p) which was paid in December 2004, this represents an increase of
10.1% compared to 2003. Subject to shareholders’ approval, the ﬁnal
dividend will be paid on 4 July 2005 to all shareholders on the register at 
3 June 2005. For a decade Cobham has been one of the few UK quoted
companies to offer increased annual dividends at 10% or more.
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT
During the year the Group successfully pursued its strategy of sustained
development through organic growth and acquisition. Six acquisitions were
completed for a total consideration of £61m. In addition, in December,
agreement was reached to acquire H Koch and Sons (Koch) for a cash
consideration of US$63m and Remec Defense & Space Inc. (Remec) for 
a cash consideration of US$260m. Both of these acquisitions are expected
to complete in the second quarter of 2005, subject to certain approvals.
Remec, in particular, positions the Group well in the network enabling
capability market. Three further small acquisitions for the Chelton group
were announced in February of 2005.
As always, the strength of the Group is based on the skill and dedication of
all of its employees and, on behalf of the Board, I thank them sincerely.

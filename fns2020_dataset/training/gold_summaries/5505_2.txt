How does your team
ma e a di erence While many companies take a 
sequential approach to project 
execution, we often progress 
projects in parallel – and can do 
so because of our nimbleness and 
speed of reaction.
One of the distinctive features of 
EnQuest is that we don’t have to 
work through many layers of the 
business to reach decision makers. 
Things can be made to happen 
quickly and ef ciently.
From a career perspective, our 
prospective growth means team 
members can remain in a post 
or working discipline they enjoy, 
but nevertheless develop their 
responsibilities and capabilities 
as the business grows.

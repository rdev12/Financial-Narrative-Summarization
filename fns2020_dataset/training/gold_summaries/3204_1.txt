 Chief executive’s review
We have a strong business with leading market positions
and I am confident that our strategy will continue
to deliver value for our shareholders.
Centrica plc report 2002 05
In 2002 the group continued
its strong overall financial
performance, in particular from 
our leading UK energy operations,
where improvement in margins 
and growth were accompanied 
by new momentum in our services
to business customers and
expansion of our upstream
energy asset portfolio.
Our AA roadside and personal
finance operations continue
to deliver solid underlying profit
growth. Despite slow regulatory
progress in our UK telecoms and
North American energy markets,
we are expanding in both
businesses. Goldfish brand
development continues with
a more focused product line.
Our reinvestment in growth
areas is proceeding selectively,
with a constant focus on
economic value creation.
Global energy markets were 
hit in 2002 by turbulence and 
the retrenchment or exit of 
certain market participants, 
and the UK was no exception.
Positive underlying progress 
in the transparency and
competitiveness of the UK
wholesale electricity market
resulted in financial pressure
on some asset owners, and
poor performance for those
market participants that had
not anticipated the fundamental 
impact on wholesale pricing.
However, the wholesale gas and
electricity markets are resilient,
with ample commodity supply
enabling British Gas to benefit
from both retail brand leadership
and the hedging effect of our
energy asset management.
The value strategies that we are
pursuing in both the upstream
and downstream markets within
the UK continue to afford the
group a competitive advantage.
Turnover and profitability
Group turnover (excluding Accord
trading revenue) was £10 billion
in 2002, up 11% from the prior-
year period. Higher sales to our
business customers – through
Centrica Business Services –
were complemented by an
increase in residential electricity
sales as well as growth in North
America, the AA’s roadside and
personal finance units, home
services and One. T el. UK gas sales
volumes were lower, largely due to
unusually warm weather in the first
and fourth quarters of the year.
Group operating profit (including
joint ventures and associates,
before exceptionals and goodwill
amortisation) of £932 million was
up 37% from £679 million in 2001,
with improved performance across
most brand units, particularly
British Gas. Aggregate group
gross and operating margins
(excluding Accord) were 30%
and 9%, up from 26% and 7%
respectively in 2001 .
Customer service
We maintained our focus on
improving customer service
levels across all of our brands.
We are now placing greater
importance on qualitative
and value-based measures
of customer service which are
built into a scorecard evaluation
and reflected in the remuneration
of staff at all levels.
As testament to our focus on
these areas, we continue to be
highly rated by external agencies. 
In particular, the AA won the 
JD Power & Associates 2002
UK Roadside Assistance Study
award for customer satisfaction
for the third time in five years.
Further accolades include Which?
magazine naming the AA as the
UK’s best motoring organisation,
and www.house.co.uk winning 
the 2002 Customer Management
National E-commerce Customer
Service Award.
Outlook
Whilst the economic outlook
remains uncertain, we are moving
from a period of considerable
investment in growth opportunities
and strategic market entries,
to a period of delivery from
these investments, underpinned
by new customer relationship
management (CRM) platforms 
and common competencies
in securing value from deeper
customer relationships.
For British Gas, we expect
continuing recovery in residential
gas gross margins and further
electricity growth to generate
further profit improvement,
partially offset by the higher
costs of the government’s Energy
Efficiency Commitment and peak
CRM system implementation
expenses through to 2004.
Annual CRM cost synergies will
drive further medium term growth
in British Gas operating margins.
In the UK retail energy sector
competition remains tough,
although we believe that the
transaction prices paid recently
by acquirers should result in
retail pricing consistent with
positive supply margins. In
addition, reduced doorstep
selling in the industry appears
to be leading to lower churn

Chief executive’s review continued
rates. While we expect the result
of this reduced industry churn to
be slower growth in our residential
electricity customer base than
we had previously anticipated,
reduced customer acquisition
expenses should contribute
to better electricity profits.
We expect to increase market
share and profitability in the
UK commercial energy sector.
The launch of Centrica Business
Services has resulted in increased
management focus and growing
product portfolios in this unit.
It is anticipated that output volumes
from our Morecambe Bay gas
production facilities will decrease
by around 10% per year, offset
over time by greater output from
other currently held gas assets and
future acquisitions. We expect our
cash petroleum revenue tax (PRT)
payments to decline significantly
over the next few years.
Profitability of the AA is expected
to continue to improve, and
expenditure in information
technology will peak in 2003.
For One. T el, we expect that
regulatory improvements will
warrant renewed organic
investment in brand and product
marketing at the same time as
developing our growing mobile and
internet businesses. For Goldfish,
significant improvement to credit
card and loans contributions are
expected in 2003 and with a more
focused rollout of new products,
breakeven will occur towards the
end of the year. 
North America continues to
offer a significant value creation
opportunity, given our focus on
the marketing and service elements
of deregulated energy supply.
We continue to lobby regulators 
to maintain legal frameworks and
incumbent pricing levels which
allow sufficient and stable gross
margin headroom to attract new
market entrants. Without this
regulatory commitment to proper
competitive markets, current
organic growth prospects and
customer renewals are being
negatively affected. In this
environment, we expect to focus
in 2003 primarily on the integration
of our existing customer bases and
on profitability. We will maintain
a flexible approach to customer
acquisition, seeking to acquire
incumbent supplier customer
bases and playing a key role
in markets at early stages of
deregulation. Our organic growth
will be focused in a few larger state
and provincial markets which offer
sufficient scale for successfully
marketing our energy and related
services. As a result of this industry
environment and our strategic
focus, the timing for achievement
of our broader ambition in North
America will depend upon the
availability and pace of key
acquisition opportunities.
Our strategy in continental Europe
is to build a significant customer
base in the medium term. Although
the pace of deregulation varies
across the individual markets
there are now clear timetables
for commercial and residential
market openings. The whole of the
European Union household energy
market is expected to be liberalised
by mid 2007 . We are focusing on
those countries where the speed
of market opening and legal and
political conditions, including
unbundling and independent
regulation, are more advanced.
Employees
Our employees are central to the
delivery of our strategy and we
need to continue to attract and
retain high quality, highly motivated
people. I am pleased that we have
recruited some excellent people
over the last year to complement
our existing team. We are also
developing programmes
to ensure that we have the
leadership capability to
drive our strategy forward.
I am committed to making
Centrica an employer of choice
and the recent accreditation of
our AA brand unit as ‘Investors
in People’ is one indication that
we are developing the highest
standards of employment policies
and practices. Increased scores
in our satisfaction survey in 2002
demonstrate that our employees
share our vision and are committed
to delivering our strategy. I would
like to join the chairman in thanking
them all for their ongoing and
valued commitment.
Conclusion
T o sum up, we have a strong
business with leading market
positions. Our core businesses
are growing and are strongly cash
generative and our investment
in new businesses is proceeding
as market opportunities emerge. 
I am therefore confident that our
strategy will continue to deliver
value for shareholders.

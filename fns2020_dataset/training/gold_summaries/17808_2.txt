Non-ﬁnancial highlights
ARM technology was in around 32% of the chips  
used in all the smart electronic devices sold in 2015

Our goal is to create 
a world of smart 
connected devices 
and services, all based 
on energy-efficient 
technology, making life 
better for everyone.
* In 2015,  ARM restated the available market for our technology, 
as the opportunity is now larger than that described in the 2014 
annual report. By making the market size larger, this has reduced 
our market share in 2015. Details of the restatement can be 
found in the presentation of our full year 2015 results, available 
at www.arm.com/ir.

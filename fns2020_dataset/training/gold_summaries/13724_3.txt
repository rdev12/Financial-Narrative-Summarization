 Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Chairman’s statement
“ We take considerable encouragement 
from the reserves upgrade, the second 
since our otation. 2012 was a profoundly challenging 
year for Ruspetro. The outturn, in 
terms of production, and consequently 
returns for our shareholders, was 
disappointing. But to assess the 
Company’s performance fully, one 
must also look deeper into all levels 
of the Company’s operations. Here, I 
have been encouraged by a number of 
positive developments and above all by 
the tenacity of my executive colleagues 
in getting to grips with the challenges 
in the business.
While in private ownership, Ruspetro 
had existed on the lightest footprint 
possible to conserve resources before 
the commencement of substantial cash 
 ows. As a result, post IPO, the senior 
executive team has had not only to carry 
forward the eld development program 
but also to build the Company. I am 
particularly impressed by the speed 
and thoroughness with which Don, 
Tom, Alexander and their colleagues 
have completed this exercise. We have 
recruited a strong international team 
with experience from a variety of 
operating environments around the 
world. At a time of human resource 
shortage in our industry, I am 
encouraged by the caliber of recruits, 
and take this as an endorsement of the 
quality and potential of our business. 
We now have all the necessary human, 
technical and engineering resource 
in our three centers: the London plc 
of ce, the Moscow operational center 
and the Siberian eld of ces to handle 
the anticipated growth in the business.

“ In what has been a challenging 
year for the business I should 
like to thank all our employees 
who have worked with great 
dedication to carry us through 
this period.”
Securing further nancing is essential 
for the continued development of the 
 eld. In this regard, we are discussing 
our nancial requirements with our 
major lender and we aim to secure this 
 nancing in the near future.
In what has been a challenging year 
for the business I should like to thank 
all our employees who have worked 
with great dedication to carry us 
through this period. My thanks 
should also go to my fellow Board 
members who have been engaged in 
the business, giving vital, sometimes 
critical, but always supportive 
advice. Our commitment to the best 
governance remains absolute and 
we continue with our comprehensive 
monitoring and vigorous pursuit 
of any possible improvements to 
the Company’s Health, Safety and 
Environmental performance.
Christopher Clark
Chairman
Turning to our assets, despite the 
challenges of production, we take 
considerable encouragement from the 
further increases to our proved and 
probable hydrocarbon reserves, the 
second since otation announced post 
year end. At these levels, the scale and 
quality of our reserves provide a basis 
of full con dence for our medium and 
long-term production plans. However, 
in the short term, we have to recognize 
that technical issues of recovery have 
frustrated our ambition in 2012. 
Varying permeability and lower than 
expected ow rates in the rst half and 
much higher associated gas production 
in the second, both presented technical 
challenges for the management team. 
Here too, I have been impressed by the 
adaptability and energy that the senior 
executive team have shown. For 
example, the emergence of a gas and 
condensate play in the north east of 
our eld, while creating a technical 
challenge, has markedly bene ted 
cash ows. 
The construction of pipelines, the 
structuring and signing of contractual 
supply relationships for fracturing, 
the completion of processing facilities, 
and nally the development of the 
condensate processing plant in the 
depths of the Siberian winter are all 
real proof of the team’s resourcefulness 
and drive. It is on this basis that I am 
con dent we are equal to the tasks 
ahead, and that stakeholders can expect 
the operational picture to improve.

Croda International Plc Annual Report 2011
Full Year Results 
Croda again set new records for both 
sales and profits in 2011, with turnover 
increasing by 6.6% to £1,068.4m 
(2010: £1,001.9m) and operating 
profit advancing 22.1% to £242.4m 
(2010: £198.6m). We achieved strong 
performances in both Consumer Care 
and Industrial Specialities during the 
year. 
Pre-tax profits grew by 25.9% to 
£242.2m (2010: £192.3m), with the 
increase at the operating profit level 
further boosted by lower borrowing 
costs and higher pension funding 
credits.
Earnings per share for continuing 
operations grew by 28.4% to 122.5p 
(2010: 95.4p), reflecting the rise in pre-
tax profit, a reduced tax rate and the 
£50m share buyback undertaken during 
the year.
All three business areas in Consumer 
Care delivered good sales and profit 
growth in every quarter of 2011. Sales 
increased 11.2% to £574.3m (2010: 
£516.4m) and operating profit rose 
27.0% to £173.4m (2010: £136.5m). 
Health Care and Crop Care saw the 
highest sales and profit growth, 
and Personal Care also performed 
very strongly. Return on sales (ROS) 
increased to 30.2% (2010: 26.4%).
In Industrial Specialities, sales were up 
1.8% to £494.1m (2010: £485.5m) and 
operating profit increased by 11.1% to 
£69.0m (2010: £62.1m). Lubricants, 
Coatings & Polymers and Home Care 
performed extremely well and Geo 
Technologies made good underlying 
progress, excluding the windfall gain in 
2010 from the clean-up following the 
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Sales and 
profits declined in Polymer Additives 
and Process Additives, but overall sector 
ROS increased to 14.0% (2010: 12.8%), 
as we recovered raw material cost 
inflation and continued to improve our 
portfolio of products.
In both reporting segments we saw 
strong demand for innovative, high 
performance products, partially offset 
by lower growth and volume losses 
in older, less differentiated lines and 
commodity business.
Acquisitions and Disposals
In January 2011, the Group completed 
the sale of its 60% holding in its Korean 
joint venture, Croda Woobang, for 
a consideration of £2.2m. The profit 
on sale of £0.6m has been disclosed 
as exceptional within discontinued 
activities. 
Dividend 
The Board announced its new dividend 
policy when it reported interim results 
on 28 July 2011. In the light of Croda’s 
strong balance sheet position and 
the highly cash generative nature of 
our business, we stated our intention 
to increase the annual dividend to 
between 40% and 50% of sustainable 
earnings. In line with this new policy, 
the interim dividend was increased 
by 153.8% to 24.75p (2010: 9.75p), 
comprising 40% of first half earnings.
Chairman’s statement 
In the longer term, our focus on innovation 
and technology, and our increasing exposure 
to the growing economies of Asia and Latin 
America, give me great confidence in the 
future prospects of the Group
I am delighted 
to report another 
outstanding set of 
results. This continued 
success is testimony 
to the effectiveness 
of our strategic 
focus on market led 
innovation in fast 
growing sectors and 
economies worldwide, 
and an unrivalled 
understanding of our 
customers.

The Board proposes to increase the final 
dividend by 19.8% to 30.25p (2010: 
25.25p), making a total dividend for 
the year of 55.0p (2010: 35.0p), an 
increase of 57.1%. This represents a 
payout ratio of 45%, in the middle of 
our target range.
Subject to future trading and the 
maintenance of a prudent approach to 
cash and balance sheet management, 
Croda expects to maintain this dividend 
policy in the years ahead.
Capital Structure 
In 2011, we repaid £50m to 
shareholders by means of a share 
buyback, purchasing 2.8m shares at an 
average price of £17.82.
We are again likely to generate surplus 
cash from trading in 2012. We intend 
to invest this in acquisitions and 
further organic investment if suitable 
opportunities arise. Any future buybacks 
will be reviewed in the light of the 
above.
The Board 
There have been a number of 
significant changes to the Board during 
the year.
Mike Humphrey retired from the Board 
at the end of 2011 after 42 years with 
the Company, including 13 years as 
Group Chief Executive. Mike led the 
transformation of Croda into the unique 
and exceptionally successful business 
that it is today and on behalf of all our 
shareholders and staff, I thank him for 
his outstanding achievements and offer 
him our very best wishes for the future.
Steve Foots succeeded Mike as Group 
Chief Executive on 1 January 2012. 
Steve has worked for Croda since 
1990, beginning his career with us 
as a graduate trainee, and has been 
a member of the Board as President 
of Croda Europe since July 2010. I am 
confident that Steve is ideally qualified 
to build on Mike’s success and lead 
Croda in the next phase of its growth 
and development.
Keith Layden was appointed to the 
Board as an executive director in the 
new role of Chief Technology Officer 
in February 2012. Keith joined Croda 
in 1984 and has extensive experience 
of the chemical industry and related 
technologies. The creation of his new 
role will help us to accelerate the 
development of innovative technologies 
and underlines the critical importance 
of this area to the future development 
of the Group.
Alan Ferguson joined the Board as an 
independent non-executive director in 
July 2011 and was appointed Chairman 
of the Audit Committee in August 2011. 
Alan is a Chartered Accountant who 
has previously served as Chief Financial 
Officer of Lonmin Plc, Group Finance 
Director of The BOC Group and Group 
Finance Director of Inchcape plc. 
Mike Buzzacott retired from the Board 
in August 2011 after seven years 
of service as an independent non-
executive director, including four years 
as Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
We thank him for his contribution to 
Croda and wish him well. Mike has 
been succeeded as Senior Independent 
non-executive director by Nigel Turner, 
a member of the Board since 2009.
Outlook 
Trading in January was encouraging 
and this positive trend has continued, 
despite the obvious economic 
uncertainties in Europe. While it is still 
early in the year and our visibility is 
limited, we expect 2012 to be another 
year of progress for Croda. 
In the longer term, our focus on 
innovation and technology, and our 
increasing exposure to the growing 
economies of Asia and Latin America, 
give me great confidence in the future 
prospects of the Group.
Martin Flower 
Non-executive Chairman
Our Home Care division launched a new additive for hard surface cleaners called 
ModiSurf™ Clarity during 2011. ModiSurf Clarity forms a protective layer on surfaces 
such as glass, which repels limescale and reduces the tendency of surfaces to mist up.
Unlike most alternative products, ModiSurf Clarity has a high content of renewable 
raw materials, over 60%, and is biodegradable. As ModiSurf Clarity remains effective 
for longer than conventional products, the consumer uses less of the cleaning 
product. The result is a reduction in the quantity of chemicals washed down the drain. 
ModiSurf Clarity, therefore, provides both performance and environmental benefits for 
the consumer.

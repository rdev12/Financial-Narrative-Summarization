 Chief Investment Officer’s Report
Last year I reported that 
given the prevailing 
economic climate we were 
going to need to support 
our existing portfolio 
companies with more 
capital than perhaps we 
might previously have 
expected and that we 
anticipated that it would be 
more challenging to raise 
new money for unquoted 
companies. This has indeed 
proven to be the case. 
 
During the year under review we have  
made further sums available to half of the 
companies in the portfolio. An update on 
the investment activity follows and we  
have featured four of our companies on 
pages 11 to 14.
Investment Activity
We added one new company to the Group’s 
portfolio, Im-Sense, and made follow-on 
equity investments into six companies: 
Cascade Technologies, Spiral Gateway, 
EctoPharma, Biopta, Pufferfish and Traak 
Systems. We also provided short term 
funding in the form of convertible loans, 
alongside other existing shareholders, to 
seven companies: Alivox, Tayside Flow 
Technologies (TFT) (subsequently converted 
to equity), NXVision, PSI Electronics, NiTech 
Solutions, Quantum Filament Technologies 
and Hydrosense. Finally, two other existing 
portfolio companies, Atlas Genetics and 
Conjunct, received second tranches of funds 
after meeting certain conditions throughout 
the year. 
The aggregate investment made into our 
portfolio companies during the year was 
£7.25m, being £2.77m from the Group  
and its clients leveraging £4.48m from  
other sources. 
Portfolio Divestments
I reported last year that Pentland Systems,  
a Caledonia Portfolio Realisations (CPR) 
portfolio company, was acquired on a 
deferred consideration basis; we still await  
the final determination and receipt of the 
proceeds of this sale, although we do not 
expect the proceeds to be material to the 
Group. Staying with the CPR portfolio, we 
have seen the loss of Orkell, and Intrallect was 
acquired by an IT services company, Leading 
Software, in a share-for-share exchange. 
On the remainder of the Group’s portfolio, 
Alivox has ceased to trade, and companies 
that instigated insolvency proceedings were 
Edinburgh Robotics, MicroEmissive Displays 
Group and Virtual Well Engineer.
Some of our companies have had tentative 
approaches by potential acquirers but 
current market conditions would suggest 
that more time is needed to maximise the 
potential outcome and any near-term exits 
will be opportunistic at best.

BRAVEHEART INVESTMENT GROUP   ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 Progress in our Portfolio Companies
At the end of our financial year we had  
28 companies in the Group’s portfolio,  
as outlined in the table on page 10.  
Our portfolio is diversified both by sector  
and stage of company and our focus is on 
investing in companies where there is  
the potential for significant growth. 
A number of our early stage companies  
have been working towards the completion 
of various innovative products or services, 
with a number of market launches planned 
for the coming year. There have also been 
some notable achievements by some of our 
companies since the date of my last report: 
examples include TFT which achieved  
a CE mark and FDA 510k approval for its 
peripheral artery graft based on its 
proprietary Spiral Laminar Flow™ design –  
the TFT graft is now being distributed on  
a world-wide basis; Bloxx, with its web 
filtering software ‘Tru-View’, continues to 
demonstrate promising growth on a global 
scale, and in addition to other awards was 
included in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 
(UK) and the Fast 500 (EMEA) indices of 
fastest growing technology companies, and 
secured a place in Red Herring’s ‘Global 200’ 
technology firms to watch; EctoPharma 
completed its phase 3 clinical trial into the 
use of its non-toxic headlice product, 
KindaPed, with compelling results; and in its 
best year yet, Pufferfish’s 360° spherical 
display systems captivated audiences at 
Coldplay’s Viva La Vida world tour. 
In the majority of our companies we 
maintain an active interest and provide 
management support where necessary 
through the various stages in the company 
lifecycle. We are encouraged by the calibre 
of the executive teams, in support of which 
we often introduce experienced individuals 
from our client base to chair the companies 
or to act in a non-executive capacity. Our 
client base is a valuable resource and we are 
immensely grateful for their contribution. 
Portfolio Returns
At the end of the year under review, our 
rebased client exit portfolio (being a portfolio 
where all exited investment returns are 
modelled since Braveheart’s inception in 1997) 
showed an internal rate of return of 33.40%. 
The overall client portfolio (modelling both 
exited and unexited investment returns) is 
showing a return of 24.48%. 
Forward Strategy
In summation, we continue to nurture our 
portfolio of companies by providing cash  
and management support where necessary. 
Investing in and managing our portfolio 
remains a key activity in building on the 
success of Braveheart and whilst a number  
of our companies will continue to need to 
show resilience under quite trying market 
circumstances we remain confident of the 
intrinsic value in the portfolio and will 
continue to drive these companies to achieve 
the goal of delivering a return for their 
respective shareholders.

combinations,	share	based	payments,	discontinued	operations	and	non-trading	items	and	related	tax.	
The	Group	believes	that	these	measures	provide	additional	guidance	to	the	statutory	measures	of	performance	
of	the	business.	These	measures	are 	not	defined	under	adopted	IFRS	and	therefore	may	not	be	directly	
comparable	with	other	companies’	adjusted	profit	measures.
Non-trading	items	are 	items	which,	in	management’s	judgement,	need	to	be	disclosed	by	virtue	of	size,	
incidence	or	nature.	Such	items	are 	 included	within	the	income	statement	caption	to	which	they	relate	and	
are	separately	disclosed	either	in	the	notes	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements	or	on	the	face	of	the	
consolidated	income	statement.

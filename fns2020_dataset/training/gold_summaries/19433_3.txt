 The Board of Raven Russia Limited (“Raven Russia”)
announces the Group’s results for the year ended
31st December 2010.
The key operational focus last year was letting. We have made
continued progress in an improving market. 
Reported net operating income (“NOI”) increased by
$11 million in the year to $61 million (2009: $50 million).
With a stable overhead base, this gives a straight contribution
to operating profit which increased to $25 million (2009:
$13 million) and is also reflected in strong operating cash
inflows for the year which more than doubled to $33 million
(2009: $15 million).
Following the sale of our Baltia project, generating a profit
of $12 million after costs, and a revaluation surplus on our
property portfolio of $79 million (2009: loss of $108 million),
we have recorded a healthy profit before tax of $56 million
(2009: loss of $148 million).
Today, of our total finished portfolio of 975,000 sqm,
321,000 sqm (33%) stands vacant, 94,000 sqm (10%)
of which is subject to pre-let agreements (“PLAs”) and letters
of intent (“LOIs”) and we are in active discussions on 157,000
sqm (16%) of the remaining space. On average, we suffer a
cost of $40 per sqm servicing vacant space whilst continuing
with our letting programme. 
We have maintained our strong balance sheet with gearing of
35.6% as calculated in note 35 to the financial statements and
a cash position today of $132 million.
We completed the sale of our Baltia project at an equivalent
yield of 10% in the year, recording a profit on sale of
$12 million and generating cash of $21 million after costs.
Adjusted fully diluted NAV per share was 105c at the year end,
compared to 99c at 31 December 2009. 
We remain bemused by the valuation of our portfolio. Whilst
accepting the sparsity of comparable transactions, we are still
roughly at replacement cost and on an overall ERV yield of
12.8% (2009: 14.3%).
There must come a time when valuers don’t simply discount
Polish/Czech Republic/Hungarian yields by 2% points to
UK/French/German yields; and then discount by a further 3%
points for Russia! Someone will wake up to the growth and
dynamism of the Russian economy when compared to the
declining nature of those Western European economies and
value well let Grade A Russian buildings accordingly. The old
paradigm must shift and we must all begin to accept the
“new normal”.
As promised, we moved our ordinary shares and warrants
onto the Official List in August 2010. All of our listed
instruments have performed well in the year, ordinary shares
with a year end price of 62.5p (2009:45p), warrants at 37.5p
(2009:24p) and preference shares at 129.25p (2009:93p).
Due to the continuing progress in NOI and our strong balance
sheet we intend to declare a final dividend of 1p per share.
This is in addition to the tender offer made during the year,
where we purchased and cancelled ordinary shares, with a
cost equivalent to 1p per share.
We are continuing our progress with letting and financing and
maintaining a strong liquid balance sheet. Both ordinary and
preference shareholders have received good returns and we
are well placed for this to continue. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders,
employees and advisors for their support during the year.

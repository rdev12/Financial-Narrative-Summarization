CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT I joined the Board in April 2014 conscious 
of the challenges the Group faced and 
aware that a significant number of 
key stakeholders believed that our full 
potential was not yet being realised. 
My objective has been to take on board 
the views of shareholders, industry 
specialists and colleagues, and then 
draw on my prior experience to work 
actively with the Board and the broader 
management team to address each of our 
key challenges. These include external 
pressures such as the ever-shifting 
regulatory and technological landscape, 
and closer to home, the challenges, 
some self-inflicted, that have arisen 
from the 2011 merger which created the 
current Group.
Operational focus
The reorganisation of the business into a 
label-led structure, the separation of our 
technology into a stand-alone unit and 
the simplification of our management 
structure have together addressed the 
organisational weaknesses of our previous 
approach by speeding-up decision-making, 
r ed u c i n g co sts an d r et u rn i n g th e o pe ra tio n al 
focus to our customers. I am pleased to 
confirm that the targeted cost savings are 
on track, and will contribute €1 5m during 
the 201 5 financial year . The renewed focus 
within our business and the continued 
divestment of non-core operations have 
allowed a simplified restatement of our 
strategy under just three headings being: 
to focus our B2C operations on nationally 
regulated and/or taxed markets, to secure 
long-term strategic partners for our B2B 
business driven by sports betting, and to 
act responsibly . Management have 
accelerated their efforts to deliver these 
and in particular to put innovative product 
and customer insight as the key priorities 
for their teams.
Board composition
It is important that shareholders have 
full confidence in the Board at any 
time, but particularly during such a 
challenging period. My early review of the 
composition and structure of the Board 
identified the benefits of change that 
were announced prior to the 2014 AGM 
in May . Rod Perry , who steps down at the 
201 5 AGM, has been a valued member 
of the Board, serving latterly as Deputy 
Chairman, SID and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. His experience, 
counsel and constructive challenge will be 
missed. Likewise in Helmut Kern, who also 
steps down, we will be losing an energetic, 
inquisitive and experienced Chair of Audit 
& Risk Committee. I should like to thank 
them both for their contribution to the 
Group over an extended period and their 
support during my first year as Chairman. 
In Barry Gibson and Liz Catchpole I am 
sure we have recruited strong successors 
who will be valuable contributors to 
key Board decisions as well as effective 
committee chairs.
As part of my review it was also agreed 
that Manfred Bodner , a co-founder of 
bwin, could best contribute to the Group’s 
development through a consultancy 
arrangement, and as a consequence 
he stepped down as a Non-Executive 
Director at the conclusion of the 2014 
AGM. The strength and global awareness 
of the bwin brand are testimony to his 
efforts over many years on shareholders’ 
behalf. I should like to record our thanks 
for this legacy . Following the 2014 AGM, in 
accordance with the rights attaching to 
the shares acquired by SpringOwl, Daniel 
Silvers was nominated to the Board. 
Since his appointment in June, he has 
brought new insights to our deliberations 
and has been a valued and engaged 
member of the Board. 
Industry consolidation
Since May 2014 the external environment 
has continued to present the Group with 
a challenging backdrop. Although it was 
clear that industry pressures meant 
that consolidation was a likely feature 
of industry dynamics, the acquisition of 
the PokerStars business by Amaya Inc. 
announced in June 2014 was unexpected 
and raised concerns over both the likely 
trajectory of our nascent US business 
as well as the future competitiveness of 
our European offering. A new regulatory 
regime and gaming tax in the United 
Kingdom together with changes in 
VA T legislation within the EU present 
additional headwinds for the industry 
in 2015.
Additional value will attach to firms with 
scale, a diverse customer footprint and 
access to winning technology . Whilst as a 
Group we already possess each of these 
attributes, the wave of recent corporate 
activity has shown that consolidation 
may be an effective route forward, where 
it delivers strategic benefits supported 
by significant operational and financial 
synergies. Whilst we remain committed to 
and are accelerating the execution of our 
operating plans, the Board also continues 
to explore whether certain business 
combinations might deliver superior 
outcomes for our stakeholders.

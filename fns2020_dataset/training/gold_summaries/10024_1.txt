Chief Executive’s report
William Higgs
Chief Executive
The Company has a broad asset base 
across the exploration, development 
and production phases of the 
business. These assets have significant 
upside potential and we now have the 
financial strength to de-risk and 
mature these assets over the coming 
years, while also looking for valuable 
opportunities for asset acquisition.
Gas Production and Prices
All gas production of the Group 
currently occurs in Italy.
In 2012, total gas production was  
1.8 Bcf, which represented a 200% 
increase relative to the prior year  
(2011: 0.6 Bcf). This was largely due  
to a full year of gas production at the 
Guendalina gas field, which 
accounted for 84% of total production 
for the Group.
During 2012, the Brent oil price has 
fluctuated around $111/bbl, while the 
Euro vs US Dollar exchange rate has 
experienced significant volatility  
which has influenced gas prices. The 
average gas sales price achieved by 
the Group during the period, excluding 
production from discontinued 
operations, was €0.33/scm ($12.0 per 
thousand cubic feet).
The year 2012 has set the foundation 
for growth as we achieved strong 
financial, commercial and 
operational performance.
A full year of production from 
Guendalina combined with 
continued production onshore Italy 
delivered total sales revenue for the 
Group of €16.3 million and a cash 
and cash equivalent position of €8.7 
million at 31 December 2012.
The two critical commercial 
objectives for the year were 
achieved. Firstly, our Ombrina Mare 
field was included in an exemption 
from the offshore drilling ban 
introduced in 2010 in Italy. Secondly, 
we were able to secure a new partner 
to fund exploration drilling activities at 
Malta offshore Area 4. The Group is 
now in a strong financial and 
operational position, which will 
enable MOG to actively seek 
strategic growth opportunities while 
progressing its portfolio of production, 
development and exploration assets.
Building 
a resources 
factory
‘ For the first time in our 
history we achieved a 
profit from operations 
and set the foundation 
for growth’
The Company’s forecasts for future gas 
prices indicate that the positive trend 
seen in the last two years is not 
expected to continue in 2013 and 2014 
and the Italian gas price is expected to 
progressively decline by approximately 
2 to 4 Euro cents per scm, due to the 
excess of gas supply relative to gas 
demand.
Oil & Gas Reserves and Resources
The Group’s reserves and resources 
are reviewed on an annual basis  
by independent certifiers (Proven, 
Probable and Possible Reserves)  
and/or by the Company (Contingent 
and Prospective Resources). As at  
31 December 2012, the Company 
recorded 2P reserves of 40 MMbbls oil 
(net) and 15.3 Bcf (net) of gas. Best 
estimate contingent resources were  
17 MMbbls oil (net) and 22.3 Bcf (net) 
of gas. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements

Asset Overview
Exploration, Development and 
Production
Italy – Offshore Northern Adriatic 
The Company’s efforts during the 
period under review were mostly 
focused on maximising the revenues 
from the Guendalina gas field offshore 
Italy in the northern Adriatic.
Guendalina Gas Field (MOG WI 20%, 
ENI WI 80% and Operator)
 > Guendalina produced 1.5 Bcf net to 
MOG for the full year under review 
at an average of 4.1 million scf/d 
(116,000 scm/d) 
 > An independent certification of the 
field gas reserves issued by RPS post 
the reporting date: 
 > revised 2P recoverable reserves to 
23.5 Bcf (4.7 Bcf net to MOG), 
representing no change to the 
prior year estimate when 
accounting for the full year 
production; 
 > estimated P3 reserves of 33 Bcf 
(6.6 Bcf net to MOG).
 > A gas sales contract was completed 
with Repower Italia SpA to cover all 
the Company’s net gas produced 
from the field from 1 April 2012 to  
30 September 2013. Post the 
reporting period this contract was 
extended for an additional year to 
September 2014. 
 > Guendalina generated revenues of 
€13.8 million for the reporting period 
The Guendalina gas field is located 
47km offshore of the north-east coast 
of Italy, in 42m of water. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2012 10
Chief Executive’s report continued
Development activity for these fields 
was frozen from 2001, initially pending 
the resolution of environmental 
concerns about subsidence caused 
by developing the offshore region.  
The Italian Government indicated in 
2009 that it is in favour of a positive 
resolution of these issues in this area of 
the Northern Adriatic. As a portion of 
the Company’s AC19 PI concession lies 
within 12 miles of nature reserves it was 
impacted by the 2010 offshore 
restrictions introduced by the Italian 
Government for the offshore E&P 
activities. On 7 August 2012 the Italian 
Parliament issued the Law 134/2012 
containing Article 35, which relates to 
offshore exploration and production 
activities. The Article states that the 
restrictions introduced under Decree 
DLGS 128/2010 would no longer be 
applicable for the pre-existing offshore 
E&P activities such as concession AC19 
PI. The Company can now work with 
ENI to increase the priority of the 
development of the Northern Adriatic 
discoveries within AC19 PI.
Italy – Onshore Foredeep Gas
In Italy, the Company has a large 
number of onshore production and 
exploration gas assets that target  
gas traps in the Pliocene aged sand 
deposits of the Apennines foredeep.  
In this E&P acreage the existing 
production is not the only value. In fact, 
several interesting development and 
exploration projects are also present, 
mainly within existing production 
Guendalina has produced in line 
with management expectations for 
the year under review. Recertification 
of the reserves demonstrates that the 
asset has the capability to provide 
revenues for at least the next 3 to 5 
years. Additional opportunities to 
add production at Guendalina 
come from our ability to open up an 
additional completed production 
zone in well Gue 3 and a side track 
of one of the producing wells into a 
deeper target once Gue-2 reaches 
its economic limit.
Other North Adriatic Gas Discoveries 
(MOG WI 15%, ENI WI 85% and 
Operator)
The Guendalina project is located in 
one of the most important gas 
exploration and production areas in 
Italy and is situated 70km to the south 
of four other discovered, but still 
undeveloped, offshore gas fields in 
which the Group has a 15% interest.
These four gas discoveries amount  
to between 19 to 48 Bcf net 
contingent gas resources to the 
Group and represent an important 
growth opportunity for the Company. 
Their reclassification from 2C 
(Contingent Resources) to 2P 
reserves is expected to take place 
following authorisation of the 
development plans for the fields.

unlock approximately 12 to 14 Bcf net

Under the terms of the Sale and 
Purchase Agreement, on Completion:
 > CIL will pay to MOG the sum of €100 
as consideration for the acquisition 
of the Company’s working interests 
held in the Assets; 
 > CIL agrees to assume the liability for 
all future plug, abandonment and 
site remediation costs associated 
with the Assets; 
 > MOG will pay €1,250,000 to CIL as  
a partial contribution towards the 
future plug, abandonment and site 
remediation costs for the Assets; 
 > MOG will credit CIL the revenue 
MOG received from the Assets 
during the period between the 
Effective Date of 24 August 2012 and 
the Completion Date (the ‘Interim 
Period’), net of allowable operating 
costs and agreed capital 
expenditure associated with the 
Assets and incurred by MOG during 
the Interim Period. 
During the coming year we will 
continue to progress our exploration 
activities with the drilling of one well 
and final preparations and approvals 
of two additional wells planned for 
drilling in 2014.
In December 2012, we received the 
award of the Aglavizza Production 
Concession onshore central Italy 
where we have a 100% interest in the 
7km
2
 concession that includes the 
Civita 1 discovery with estimated 
proved and probable reserves of more 
than 1 Bcf. Post the award, we safely 
conducted a production test of Civita 
1 that confirmed excellent 
permeability and no near-well bore 
formation damage. We estimate that 
the Aglavizza field can be profitably 
developed, with first gas due in  
early 2015.
Italy – Ombrina Mare
Oil & Gas Discovery (MOG WI 100%)
The Ombrina Mare discovery is an 
important asset for the Company that 
represents an important future growth 
opportunity.
Following the successful drilling of two 
exploration/appraisal wells in 2008, the 
completion of a well as an oil producer 
and the set- up of a tripod platform in 
preparation for the development 
phase, the Company applied for a 
production Concession (d 30 B.C-MD) 
in December 2008. The Company 
obtained in early 2010, an 
independent certification of 40 
MMbbls 2P oil reserves, of which 
proven (P1) oil reserves were just over 
12 MMbbls. These oil reserves establish 
the Ombrina Mare field as a significant 
European oil project.
During the period:
 > Law 35/2012, regarding 
‘simplifications and economic 
growth’ was ratified on 6 April 2012 
clarifying that the limitations 
provided by Decree 128 do not 
apply to either existing mining titles 
or ‘relevant extensions’. 
 > We received a three year extension 
to our exploration permit BR269 GC, 
where the Ombrina Mare field is 
located, in May.
 > Law number 134/2012 was 
published on 11 August 2012 
confirming that restrictions under 
decree DLGS 128/2010 will no longer 
apply to: 
i) applications for production 
concessions that were under 
review at the time DLGS 128/2010 
came into force, and any 
connected or subsequent 
proceedings; 
ii) any titles, including exploration 
licences, that had already been 
issued prior to DLGS 128/2010 
coming into force; and 
iii) any proceedings connected with 
or subsequent to such titles, 
including possible extensions of 
the same.

Malta – Offshore Area 4
The Group operates Offshore Area 4, 
which comprises 5,700km
2
 of deep 
water acreage north of the 
internationally recognised border 
between Malta and Libya.
During the period:
 > We acquired a 10% interest in the 
Licence from Leni Gas and Oil 
Investments Ltd. 
 > ERC Equipoise (‘ERCE’) completed a 
Competent Persons Report on Malta 
offshore Area 4, validating the 
economic potential of Eocene 
Prospects within the Licence. 
 > We received approval from the 
Maltese Government of a one year 
extension to the first exploration 
period to 18 January 2014. 
 > We completed key documents for 
the sale of a 75% interest in Malta 
offshore Area 4 to Genel for a 
consideration of: 
 > US$10 million cash payment 
(received in February 2013); 
 > 100% carry on the first exploration 
well, and a 100% carry on the 
second exploration well up to 
US$30 million gross expenditure; 
 > At MOG’s option, should the costs 
of the second well exceed US$30 
million, Genel will provide a 
financing arrangement to fund 
MOG’s 25% share of any 
additional expenditure, at an 
interest rate equivalent to 3 
Month Libor plus 400 bps. 
 > MOG will remain operator adviser 
to PECL until completion of the 
first exploration well, at which 
time Genel can elect to become 
the operator, or at such later date 
as the parties may agree.
The Company is continuing its active 
dialogue with the Italian Government, 
with a view to securing approval of 
the EIA for Ombrina Mare and the 
award of the associated Production 
Concession. We currently expect the 
Production Concession will be 
awarded during the third quarter of 
2013. Post award, we will progress the 
drilling of a pilot appraisal well to 
evaluate additional potential in the 
deeper Cretaceous reservoir and to 
set a second production well. This 
activity should enable the most 
flexibility in funding the future 
development of Ombrina Mare.
Wildcat Exploration
Italy – Southern Apennines
In the Southern Apennines, the Group 
operates the Monte Grosso project, 
holding a 22.89% interest. The project 
is a high quality near field exploration 
opportunity close to one of the 
largest onshore oil producing areas 
in Western Europe. The Monte Grosso 
exploration project presently remains 
on hold, pending resolution of 
residual permitting issues, which the 
Group presently believes should be 
positively resolved and allow a 
project start-up in late 2015 (subject 
to rig availability). The Monte Grosso 2 
well is targeting 280 MMbbls of 
unrisked prospective resources (64 
MMbbls net to the Group) at a depth 
of 6,500m. Permitting and existing 
well site maintenance works were the 
main activities conducted during the 
period.
The area is frontier exploration where 
no drilling activity has occurred and it 
is one of the rare areas that still 
remains to be explored in the 
Mediterranean basin. The transaction 
with Genel means that a minimum of 
two exploration wells are now fully 
funded. We expect that the first well will 
be drilled in late 2013 with the second 
to follow within 18 months.
Offshore Area 4 is a high risk, but 
potentially a high reward, geological 
environment where nine prospects 
and leads have been certified by ERCE 
and RPS with a total of 325 million bbls 
of unrisked prospective oil resources 
net to MOG.
France – St Laurent
The St Laurent permit is located in 
southern France in a known gas and 
oil prone province. The Company has 
an 11% WI in this asset. There has been 
little activity on the permit in 2012. The 
joint venture partners have undergone 
some changes with Nautical Petroleum 
plc being acquired by Cairn Energy 
plc and Aquitaine Exploration Ltd 
acquiring an 18.2% interest in the 
licence from Egdon Resources. The 
strategy for the licence is currently 
being finalised by the joint venture 
partners.
Health, Safety and the Environment 
The Company continues to be 
committed to maintaining the highest 
standards in HSE management. No 
environmental incidents have been 
reported for the period under review. 
However, we had one lost time injury 
when one of our employees sustained 
a head injury while inspecting the 
Ombrina Mare tripod. A full route 
cause analysis was conducted and 
the inspection SOP updated. Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements

financial position going forward.
Over the next 12 months, MOG intends 
to progress its key assets and pursue 
attractive and material strategic 
growth opportunities that we expect to 
identify.
One of the strengths of the Company is 
the wide international experience of its 
senior managers, in particular in the 
Mediterranean area and the 
operational capability of its staff and 
organisation. We have added some 
key members of staff in 2012 and we 
believe that the capability of our

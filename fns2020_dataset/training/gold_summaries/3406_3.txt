Review of Operations
Overall the Group performed extremely well in 2009.
The Group acted for 1,389 clients in 2009 compared
to 1,381 in 2008. 230 of these clients used more than
one of our businesses (256 in 2008) which represented
70% of total operating income (2008 – 66%).
150 clients paid us over £100,000 in 2009, compared
to 170 in 2008. Our top 30 clients represented 57% of
total operating income (2008 – 48%).
Our two largest clients represented 22.3% of our
operating income (2008 – 18.4%). Both clients have
been retained since 2003, are high margin and have
normal renewal terms. They are both covered by more
than one contract covering the various different
services provided to the client so that the ending of
one contract would be unlikely to lead to all contracts
for the same client coming to an end.
Average fee income per client in 2009 was £89,000
compared to £81,000 in 2008. Average income per
employee was £118,000 in 2009 compared to
£111,000 in 2008. In 2009, 46% of our income came
from overseas work compared to 37% in 2008.
Divisional Performance
2009 was a good year for the Public Relations Division,
the Advertising and Marketing Services and the Sports
Marketing Divisions, but a disappointing one for our
Research Division.
Public Relations continues to be our largest division
being 54% of operating income (2008 – 55%),
Advertising and Marketing Services was 27% 
(2008 – 27%), Sports Marketing was 14% 
(2008 – 12%) and Research 5% (2008 – 6%). The full
year impact of the Essentially acquisition should mean
that Sports Marketing should be about 20% of Group
operating income in 2010.

Overall the division showed good revenue growth with
strong cost control which resulted in an improved
margin. Some businesses were affected by the
downturn but this was more than offset by other
businesses performing beyond our expectations,
notably our geopolitical business, Corporate
Citizenship and Good Relations.

Operating Profit Margin       12.0%       11.6%
Operating income continued to grow whilst costs have
grown at a slower rate leading to an improvement in
operating profit margin. We believe this trend can continue.
There was a strong performance from VCCP both in
the UK and Germany, as well as our digital and search
businesses. Teamspirit, our financial services
marketing business, performed ahead of our
expectations and well ahead of 2008.
Sports Marketing – Fast Track 
and Essentially

The 2009 results include two months of the
acquisition of Essentially and a full year of Fast Track.
2008 relates only to Fast Track. The integration of Fast
Track and Essentially is going well and both
businesses have continued to grow. The Fast Track
business in the Middle East has done particularly well.
These are high margin businesses in a marketplace
that we believe will continue to grow despite the
economic uncertainty.

The Research Division remains very disappointing. 
The marketplace has been affected by the economic
downturn but our businesses have also underperformed.
Within the division Facts International has performed
very well and we are using that business and its
management as a basis for restructuring the whole division.
The acquisition of Tree will provide additional
opportunities for growth and we expect the division as
a whole to show a profit in the first six months of the
year and continue to grow thereafter.
“We outperformed the market and our competitors in
2008 and we have done so again in 2009. These are
our best results ever and we are very pleased and
delighted. We have made three acquisitions, controlled
costs and strengthened our existing business. 2010 has
started well and we are cautiously optimistic for the
outcome of the full year.”

Chairman’s Statement
(continued)
Corporate activity
We have completed the acquisition of Tree (London)
Limited (Tree) following the announcement that we
had entered into the Heads of Terms on 15th January
2010. Tree is a research and data analytics company
which we have acquired from Cagney plc for 
£2 million in cash. The transaction has been funded
from the proceeds of a cash placing made on 
15th January 2010.
During 2009 we acquired the sports marketing
business, Essentially, and we merged Pelham Public
Relations, a financial public relations business, with
our existing Bell Pottinger Corporate and Financial
business.
These three businesses will enhance the range of
services we can offer to our clients and will give us
additional opportunities for growth in 2010 and
beyond.
Corporate and Social Responsibility
The Group continues to be carbon neutral and
reduced its carbon footprint by 42% in 2007 and
2008. We are expecting to have reduced it by a
further 5% during 2009. We continue to consider and
enhance the environmental impact of our businesses
and are working closely with our major suppliers to
ensure best practice is embedded in our wider
operations. We continue to be included in the
FTSE4Good and have been re-accredited with a 
Big Tick by Business in the Community for our work
on climate change.

Part of our 2009 strategy was to strengthen our
existing business ready for any upturn in the 2010
market. We believe this strategy will be beneficial for
2010. Highlights are:
� We have considerably improved our financial public
relations offering through the merger with Pelham.
In the first quarter this business has increased its
income and its new business conversion has been
very good.
� Our public affairs business has had a record start to
the year following the appointment of Tim Collins as
Managing Director to work alongside Peter Bingle,
the Chairman.
� The whole Public Relations Group has been
strengthened by the promotion of Paul Bell to Chief
Executive alongside Kevin Murray, the Chairman.
Paul previously ran our most successful public
relations business, Bell Pottinger Sans Frontieres.
� We acquired Essentially which is now being
integrated with Fast Track. This year’s results show
the Sports Marketing Division separate from the
Advertising and Marketing Service Division in order
to highlight its growth potential for 2010.
� The management of our Research Division has
been changed. We have appointed Crispin Beale as
Chief Executive. Crispin, together with his Chairman
Nick Lamb, more than doubled the profits of Facts
International in 2009. We are confident the Division
will return to profitability and will once again become
an important part of our total business.
� We have completed the acquisition of Tree which
will become part of the Research Division and will
supply our clients with a service not previously
available within the Group.
� Following winning Marketing Magazine’s agency 
of the year and Campaign magazine’s ‘campaign’
of the year, VCCP is receiving a record number of
new business opportunities. VCCP has won TCP ,
Jungle Formula and Gatwick Express already this
year and has opened an office in the Czech
Republic to service both the Czech Republic and
Slovakia for O2.
� We will continue our policy of controlling our costs,
increasing the proportion of our costs that are
variable and we are targeting an improvement in 
our margin.
� We will continue our policy of considering earnings
enhancing acquisitions that expand our range of
services and starting up new businesses to service
our existing client list.
� We are well funded and continue to be very cash
generative.
All in all we are cautiously optimistic for the outcome
of 2010.

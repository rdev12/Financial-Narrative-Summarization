Highlights by business sectors
New Build Jackup Drilling Rigs
Lamprell consolidated its position as a 
leading international builder of jackup 
drilling rigs in the sub-350ft class with 
a total of 12 new build rigs completed 
since the Group entered this segment 
ﬁve years ago. Lamprell is currently 
constructing eight more LeTourneau 
Super 116E class design jackup rigs, 
for a number of its existing customers.
Wind Farm Installation Vessels
Despite the challenges faced on the 
Fred Olsen Windcarrier vessels, the 
projects remain worthy of mention 
given their prototype design and their 
scale. Each weighed more than 
15,000 tonnes at delivery and they 
were the ﬁrst wind farm installation 
vessels of their size to be built in the 
region, and the largest vessels ever to 
be built by the Group. At load out, the 
“Brave Tern” and its sister vessel the 
“Bold Tern” represented the largest 
transport moves on wheels ever to 
take place in the Middle East.
The Group’s award of a fourth vessel by 
Seajacks, the “Hydra” , further reinforced  
its strong position in the wind turbine 
installation segment. The “Hydra” is  
a repeat design of the ﬁrst generation  
of smaller vessels that the Company 
successfully delivered on time and budget 
(Seajacks “Kraken” and “Leviathan”).
New Build Offshore Facilities
With the capability to build large-scale 
complex process decks (more than 
10,000 tonnes), Lamprell’s expertise 
in the new build offshore segment 
covers a wide range of offshore ﬁxed 
and ﬂoating facilities. Progress on the 
construction of an offshore topside 
structure comprising a two level utility 
deck and a ﬁve level accommodation 
module for a leading integrated 
energy provider continued on 
schedule as did construction on the 
Nexen Petroleum project (wellhead 
and a Production, Utilities and 
Quarters (“PUQ”) deck). Both projects 
are currently proceeding on schedule 
and on budget.

Operational Highlights
Upgrade and refurbishment of 
offshore jackup rigs
Lamprell maintained its reputation  
as the region’s leading rig upgrade 
and refurbishment facility with the 
completion of over 300 upgrade and 
refurbishment projects representing  
a regional market share in excess  
of 60%. Recent notable projects 
included the “Noble George McLeod” 
and the “Noble Jimmy Puckett” for 
Noble Drilling; Rig “657” for Nabors 
and the “Rowan Gilbert Rowe”  
for Rowan Drilling along with the 
Hercules 266 among others. The 
combined work scope on these 
projects included, but was not limited  
to, living quarter upgrades and 
refurbishment, as well as high 
volumes of class driven work such  
as structural steel renewal, piping 
replacement, machinery upgrades, 
recertiﬁcation and painting. In addition, 
many customers approach Lamprell  
for its expertise in the stringent “Saudi 
Aramco Schedule G” compliance 
which allows rigs to operate offshore 
Saudi Arabia. In recent months, similar 
projects have been awarded to 
Lamprell on a repeat basis by these 
same, existing customers.
Land Rig Services
In addition to the two new build land 
drilling rigs delivered to Weatherford, 
the Land Rig Services business unit 
focused its activities on land rig 
upgrade and refurbishment and the 
inspection and overhaul of mechanical 
and rotary equipment. A major 
milestone was the successful 
completion of NDC’s rig “ND 32”, the 
“walking rig”. The Group has recently 
expanded its Land Rig Services 
business into Saudi Arabia through 
the establishment of the “Lamprell 
Arabia” joint venture. This will be a  
key focus for this business unit over 
the coming few years because of  
the anticipated levels of land rig 
refurbishment work which will be 
required in Saudi Arabia.
Service businesses
The Group continued to see demand 
for its service business offerings across 
a range of complementary markets. 
The Group has a strong regional market 
presence through O&M, INSPEC  
and Sunbelt services, which offer  
a substantially different proﬁle to the 
core new build operations. 15 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012

HSES performance
Lamprell has always held itself to  
the highest HSES standards. In 2012, 
the Group achieved some signiﬁcant 
HSES milestones across some of the 
more complex projects, including the 
achievement of 1 million manhours 
without lost time incident (“LTI”) on  
the “Jindal Star” jackup drilling rig, the 
completion of the “Greatdrill Chaaya” 
with 3.9 million manhours without a 
single LTI, the completion of NDC 
“Makasib” and “Muhaiyimat” with 3.4 
and 4.1 million manhours without LTI 
respectively, among others. Even in 
relation to the underperforming key 
contracts, Lamprell’s commitment  
to safety was paramount and self-
evident as can be seen by the fact 
that the Windcarrier “Brave Tern” 
windfarm vessel was delivered after 
4.9 million manhours without a single 
LTI. This strong HSES performance is 
reﬂected in the Group’s overall results 
with the achievement of a combined 
LTI Frequency Rate of 0.22.
To build on this safety track record 
and to ensure consistency across  
all divisions and branches, the  
Group further expanded its Safety 
Observation Audit Programme 
(“SOAP”) by adding the Work Area 
Safety Hazard system (“WASH”) to 
assist workers to identify potential 
hazards at an early stage. Both 
systems will eventually lead to the 
launch of a new internal HSES identity 
programme entitled “Nothing to 
Chance” which will encompass  
all aspects of internal HSES 
management, training, processes  
and communication in order to further 
engage the workforce with HSES.
Quality
Lamprell’s reputation is founded  
upon its ability to deliver high quality 
projects to its customers on time and 
on budget and is focused on ensuring 
delivery of its existing contracts. 
Lamprell aims to achieve maximum 
customer satisfaction and quality of 
product and service. The Company 
achieves this objective through 
compliance with all national  
and international standards and 
requirements with respect to quality 
assurance and through ensuring 
cost-effective jobs and services, and 
delivery on time. Lamprell achieves 
this by understanding customer 
requirements, working together  
with our customers to meet those 
requirements, understanding our 
processes well and monitoring and 
measuring our activities.
To address some of the challenges 
faced in 2012, the Group continued to 
take measures to improve its systems 
and processes. The Group has 
reorganised the project management 
team to allow further control by the 
respective project manager on the 
landmark long-term projects. This key 
change will make project managers 
more accountable for their respective 
projects while enabling senior 
management to have greater  
visibility of individual projects,  
thereby improving project controls 
and reporting. The Company also 
strengthened the systems controlling 
key vendor deliveries and, under the 
leadership of a new Vice President  
for Procurement and Supply Chain,  
is working to ensure that new 
contracts and orders are currently 
being received in accordance with 
agreed delivery schedules. The 
restructuring of the Group’s core 
engineering function headed by a new 
Vice President for Engineering, has 
also helped to address some of the 
engineering-related challenges faced 
in 2012.

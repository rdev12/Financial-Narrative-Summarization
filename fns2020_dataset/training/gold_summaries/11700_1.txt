Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Mike Pulli
Chief Executive Officer
We have delivered a strong 
set of financial results, 
made good progress 
on our strategic plan, and 
created a platform for 
continued improvement.
2013 has been a year of further recovery 
and expansion for Pace. We have delivered 
a strong set of financial results, made good 
progress on our Strategic Plan, and created 
a platform for continued improvement in 
operating performance over the next 
few years.
Key highlights of the year
The Strategic Review we undertook in 2011 
highlighted that we operate in sustainable 
and profitable markets where we have 
differentiated capabilities; however, the 
Group must execute on its three primary 
objectives to take advantage of the 
opportunities for improving both the level 
and quality of its earnings. We remain 
focused on these objectives and have 
made good progress both in delivering 
strong results in 2013, building on the 
recovery made in 2012 and paving the 
way for improvement in 2014 and beyond.
This progress is reflected in 2013 revenues 
of $2,469.2 million, up 2.7% on 2012, and 
adjusted EBITA of $193.6 million, up 22.5% 
on 2012, equivalent to 7.8% of revenues, 
up 1.2ppt on 2012.
In addition to the various organic 
developments Pace has undertaken 
over the past two years, the acquisition of 
Aurora is a key step in the evolution of Pace 
and enhances our strategy to grow a broader 
platform across Hardware, Software 
& Services.
Strategic Plan
Transform core economics
Continued focus on efficiency has delivered 
further sustainable overhead savings and 
the transformation and rationalisation of our 
supply chain was completed, delivering 
significant benefits in 2013 and beyond.
 — Underlying operating expenses, 
excluding the impact of IAS 38 
accounting, reduced by $16.2 million 
(5.8%) in 2013. This was due to further 
efficiency programmes across the 
business and the impact of a full year’s 
run-rate of the changes implemented 
in 2012. Whilst reducing the overall 
operating expenses, Pace has continued 
to invest further in Software & Services 
and other growth opportunities. 
 — The transition to a consolidated 
Electronics Manufacturing Services 
(EMS) partner footprint was completed 
in the year. All new products are being 
developed through this model and the 
financial and operational benefits are 
now being realised and will drive 2014 
profitability. Further supply chain 
transformation activities are underway 
that will deliver value in 2014 and beyond.
Summary 
 — Increased operating 
profits through top-line 
growth, improved gross 
margins and increased 
operational efficiency.
 — Strong cash flow generation; 
$209.0 million free cash flow 
(108% of adjusted EBITA) and 
sustainable cash flow business 
model in place.
 — Announced highly 
accretive acquisition of 
Aurora Networks, Inc., a leading 
provider of optical transport and 
access network solutions.
 — The Board is confident that 
the Company will make 
further progress in 2014:
 — Revenues expected 
to be c. $2.7 billion
 — Operating margin expected 
to be c. 8.5%
 — Strong cash flow will 
continue and Pace expects 
to generate at least 
$185 million of free  
cash flow.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Strategic Plan continued
Transform core economics continued
 — Cash generation was strong 
throughout the year; free cash flow was 
$209.0 million (2012: $182.7 million), 
due to further re-alignment of working 
capital and tight management of capital 
expenditure. This enabled Pace to repay 
its debt in full prior to the end of the 
financial year
8
 and achieve a net 
cash position of $33.0 million at 
31 December 2013 (net debt at 
31 December 2012: $163.3 million).
The various components of the 
Transform Core Economics stream of the 
Strategic Plan are now well embedded 
across the Company and are delivering 
significant financial and operational benefits. 
However, the Company believes significant 
opportunities remain for further improvement 
and will pursue areas of inefficiency and 
relentlessly strive to continually improve 
operating effectiveness across all areas 
of the business.
PayTV hardware leadership
Pace was reconfirmed as the market 
leader in PayTV hardware; global number 
one in set-top boxes

, Media Servers
10
 
and Telco
11
 Gateways:
 — STB and Media Server revenues 
were up 8.4% to $1,979.6 million in 
2013 (2012: $1,826.0 million), driven 
largely by the high demand for media 
servers in H1 2013 in North America 
and a number of new deployments 
in H2 2013.
 — The move to media servers and 
whole home solutions is continuing 
at speed across the globe. Demand 
from customers in North America 
was strong with media servers now 
comprising over 28% of shipments 
in that market (2012: 14%). In the year, 
Pace announced a large number 
of media server wins beyond North 
America, with the first international 
deployment at Get TV in Norway and 
a number of deployments planned in 
2014 including Liberty Global, Foxtel 
and Telenet. We have a strong media 
server pipeline and anticipate increased 
demand across the globe in 2014 
and beyond.
 — IPTV is a segment in which Pace has 
previously been under-represented. 
In 2013, Pace began shipping 
Mediaroom enabled Digital Video 
Recorders (DVRs) and STBs to AT&T 
and CenturyLink, two of the largest 
telecommunications providers 
in North America, and Telefonica 
in Brazil and Chile.
 — Demand for traditional STBs remains 
strong; in the year, Pace achieved next 
generation hardware wins at a number 
of long-standing tier one customers 
and announced a multi-product deal 
with Charter Communications, a major 
cable operator in North America that 
Pace had not previously supplied 
product to.
 — Gateway revenues were down 
19.9% to $375.8 million in 2013 
(2012: $469.4 million) as the impact 
of expected dual sourcing at a major 
customer was only partially offset 
by new wins at customers such 
as GVT and MTS.
Pace was confirmed as the market leader 
in PayTV hardware and global number 
one in set-top boxes, media servers 
and telco gateways.
8 A new five year $150 million revolving credit facility plus a five year term loan of $310 million to finance the acquisition of Aurora Networks, Inc. was put in place on 6 January 2014.

Widen out in software, services 
and integrated solutions
Pace achieved a number of key wins 
and deployments across all areas of our 
Software & Services offerings and has 
a strong pipeline into 2014. Revenues in 
this area increased 5.4% to $113.8 million 
in 2013 (2012: $108.0 million). 
 — The Pace Elements software platform 
continues to gain significant traction as 
part of an advanced integrated solution 
with a number of wins in the year, 
deliveries underway for wins achieved 
in 2013 at Foxtel and other customers, 
and deployments at customers such 
as Telefonica Vivo, Sky New Zealand, 
Altibox and Elisa. The Elements platform 
is currently being used by 3.3 million 
subscribers which are expected 
to increase in 2014. 
 — Pace Elements is also a key part of 
our integrated solutions for emerging 
markets; we have a number of operators 
deployed with this solution (Pace 
hardware, software and Latens 
Conditional Access System) in India 
and have an encouraging pipeline 
in Southern Asia, Central and Eastern 
Europe and CIS.
 — The Pace ECO Service Management 
Suite continues to evolve with a number 
of new modules launched in the year 
to provide increased functionality and 
wins at customers such as Telstra, 
Telmex and Bell Aliant. These wins 
build on a strong global customer 
footprint that includes AT&T and BSkyB. 
The ECO platform is currently supporting 
our customers to manage over 30 million 
devices across the world.
 — The Latens software-based 
Conditional Access and Digital Rights 
Management (DRM) business made 
good headway, with a 52% growth in 
the number of subscribers the product 
is deployed to in 2013, on both Pace 
and other vendors’ hardware and 
wins at a number of customers 
including Telenet.

Aurora acquisition
The acquisition of Aurora Networks, Inc. for a headline consideration 
of $310 million (on a debt and cash free basis), plus a further 
$13 million relating to tax benefits to be recovered over the three 
years post acquisition, was announced on 23 October 2013 and 
completed on 6 January 2014. The headline consideration represents 
a historic EV/EBITDA
12
 multiple of 10.5x before synergies and 8.2x after 
expected annual run-rate synergies, based on the results of Aurora 
for the twelve months to 31 March 2013.
What does Aurora do?
Aurora is a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced, 
next-generation optical transport and access network solutions for 
broadband networks that support the convergence of video, data 
and voice applications. With a leading presence in products that are 
increasingly important for cable operators as they fulfil consumers’ 
constant demand for ever-increasing bandwidth, the acquisition 
further strengthens Pace’s relationships with its customers. 
What does Aurora bring to Pace?
 — Positions Pace to support operators’ and consumers’ constant 
demand for cost-effective delivery of ever-increasing bandwidth.
 — Highly profitable and growing business with blue-chip customer 
base and market-leading positions, serving over 200 customers in 
50 countries, including all of the top ten cable operators in the US.
 — Strong management team that has delivered 30 straight quarters 
of profitability.
 — Creates deeper and more embedded relationships with key customers.
 — Cross-sell opportunity across customer footprints.
 — Further widens Pace out beyond PayTV Customer Premise 
Equipment (CPE).
How is the integration going?
Aurora is now operating as a standalone Strategic Business Unit (SBU) 
retaining the Aurora brand and managing a separate P&L to retain 
focus and accountability for business performance, whilst leveraging 
Pace Group common services. As such, revenue and adjusted EBITA 
contribution for Aurora Networks will be broken out as a separate 
SBU in subsequent statutory reports. The integration of Aurora into 
the Pace structure is progressing well. Based on current progress, 
the Company is confident that the integration of Aurora will be complete 
by the end of Q2 2014, and is highly confident that the expected 
synergies stated at the point of the acquisition will be achieved; 
$4 million realised in 2014 at a cost of $4 million and $8 million 
run-rate saving realised in 2015 at no additional cost.
A further update on integration and Aurora trading will be provided in 
the Q1 2014 Interim Management Statement on Thursday 24 April 2014.

Strategic Report
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Business performance
Pace has a broad global footprint within 
which individual markets are at varying 
stages of development. Overall, the markets 
in which Pace operates have remained 
strong during the year, with PayTV 
continuing to show varying levels of 
subscriber and Average Revenue Per 
User (ARPU) growth despite perceived 
disruptive threats from new over-the-top 
(OTT) market entrants and economic 
uncertainty in emerging markets. On a 
global basis, digital PayTV subscribers 
are expected to grow at c.2.8% compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2014 
and 2017
13
.
North America
North America is the largest, most 
advanced and most profitable market for 
digital PayTV and broadband technology 
in the world, with over 112 million PayTV 
subscribers and close to 104 million 
broadband connections
14
. We believe 
the digital PayTV market in North America 
will remain flat in terms of the number 
of subscribers for the foreseeable future, 
with gross subscriber acquisition being 
offset by customer churn between the 
various PayTV offerings.
Pace is the only vendor to all of the 
largest operators in each of the cable, 
satellite and telco markets; serving 
Comcast, DirecTV and AT&T respectively. 
In each case Pace supplies its most 
advanced in-home technology. In addition, 
Pace also serves a large number of other 
cable and telco operators in both 
the USA and Canada.
Total revenues in North America 
increased by 16.9% to $1,540.5 million 
in 2013 (2012: $1,317.6 million), driven 
largely by strong demand from DirecTV 
and Comcast for Media Server products 
in H1 2013, and new wins in H2 2013. 
These confirmed Pace’s continued position 
of technological leadership in our sector 
and we remain confident about the long-term 
strength of the market for our products 
in North America.
Gateway revenues decreased by 
22.3% to $348.6 million, reflecting a 
strong comparative period in 2012 and 
the dual sourcing of supply by a major 
customer. The Company believes overall 
market demand remains strong for high 
performance residential gateways from 
telcos and internet service providers (ISPs) 
to effectively deliver high quality 
triple-play services.
Software & Services revenues in 
North America decreased by 18.9% to 
$68.1 million reflecting a decreased call 
volume in the customer care business. 
The Software & Services revenue in 
North America is primarily comprised of 
customer care, ECO Service Management 
software and professional services.
Latin America
The Latam market is a large, diverse and 
fast growing market, within which Pace 
serves satellite, cable, IPTV and hybrid 
operators across the region, with Brazil, 
Mexico and Argentina the key markets.
The overall market has expanded 
significantly over the last few years and 
continues to display strong subscriber 
growth with a predicted 10% CAGR from 
2014 to 2017
15
. This growth is led by a 
number of factors including greenfield 
markets, deregulation in Brazil, the 2014 
World Cup and 2016 Olympics in Brazil 
and a number of growing PayTV operators 
in the region. Demand for PayTV is strong 
at all levels of technology: standard 
definition (SD) to support analogue to 
digital transition, high definition (HD) 
continues to grow to meet growing 
consumer expectations and operators 
are starting to develop high-end personal 
The markets in which Pace operates 
have remained strong during the 
year with PayTV continuing to show 
subscriber and ARPU growth.

video recorders (PVRs) and media 
servers for rollout in 2014 and beyond.
Pace revenue in Latam decreased by 4.3% 
to $358.4 million (2012: $374.4 million) 
due to a reduction in demand from a key 
customer. Pace continues to have a diverse 
business in Latam; Pace provides product 
to eight of the ten largest PayTV providers 
in the region and has made good progress 
in widening out the solutions provided in 
this market. In 2013 Pace achieved its first 
deployments of the following products: 
Gateway solutions at GVT, integrated 
solution of Pace Elements and Pace 
hardware with Vivo Telefonica and ECO 
Service Management at OnDigital in Brazil. 
The Company expects to make further 
progress with these solutions and remains 
confident that Latam offers strong revenues 
and profitability and is strategically well 
positioned in key markets and customers 
in the region.
Europe
Europe remains a fragmented and highly 
customer specific territory for Pace. 
Revenues in Europe were down by 19.5% 
to $323.9 million (2012: $402.4 million), 
however, sustainable improvements in 
product mix ensured that the Company 
generated the same profit on the lower 
revenue base. The decrease in revenue 
was mainly due to a reduced win rate of 
new products in 2011, which adversely 
affected revenue in 2012 and 2013. Sales 
performance is improving and we have 
achieved key wins in new and existing 
customers which we expect will lead 
to growth in H2 2014. 
Single-digit growth is predicted in the 
underlying European market
16
; however, 
we expect significant growth in the media 
server segment of the market as operators 
in Europe follow the innovation of North 
American operators. Pace launched its first 
media server outside of North America at 
Get TV in Norway and has been awarded 
media server contracts with a number 
of operators including Liberty Global.
In addition, the Group is seeing 
increasing demand from operators for 
integrated solutions, incorporating Pace 
hardware and software assets, that can 
be quickly deployed and that enable 
the operator to innovate and differentiate 
in highly competitive markets. Pace is 
focused on developing opportunities 
in this area of the market, and has 
a number of projects underway.
Rest of World
Rest of World covers a diverse range of 
markets which are developing at different 
rates: the highly developed markets in 
Australia, New Zealand and South East 
Asia, the “fast following” markets in the 
Middle East and Africa, and the fast 
growing Indian market. Revenues in Rest 
of World are down 20.3% to $246.4 million 
(2012: $309.0 million). This decrease was 
due to reduced demand from a number 
of large customers as they prepared for 
new product launches in H2 2013 and 
2014. However, despite the reduced 
revenue, profitability increased in the 
year reflecting improved product mix.
India is a key growth market for Pace 
as the country experiences large PayTV 
subscriber growth and the transition from 
analogue to digital progresses in the cable 
sector. During the year, Pace secured 
deals with a number of operators for 
its integrated solution for cable which 
combines STB hardware, Elements 
software platform and Latens 
Conditional Access System.
The Company remains confident that 
these markets will provide significant 
growth opportunities both at the high end 
of the market with HD, PVR and media 
server products, and also as the uptake 
of PayTV and digitisation continues in 
emerging greenfield markets allowing 
Pace to increase its footprint with new 
customers through software and 
integrated solutions.
Board changes
Mike Inglis retired from his role as a 
Non-executive Director at the Annual 
General Meeting on 24 April 2013.
2014 outlook
Considerable progress has been made 
in delivering on our strategy in 2013 but 
there remains further opportunity in 2014 
to develop and improve the performance 
of the Company.
The Board is confident that the Group 
(including Aurora) will make further 
progress in 2014:
 — revenues for 2014 expected 
to be c. $2.7 billion;
 — operating margin for 2014 is expected 
to be c. 8.5%; and
 — strong cash flow will continue, and 
Pace expects to generate at least 
$185 million of free cash flow.

CHAIRMAN’S
REPORT
Overview
In our fifth successive year as a  
public listed company, NCC Group 
plc has delivered its strongest ever 
performance, but this time against a 
backdrop of economic and worldwide 
financial downturn and uncertainty. 
Without doubt the global economy in 
which the Group operates is the worst 
ever encountered. However, the Group 
developed and continued to grow in 
the face of this adversity. As well as 
delivering strong financial growth, two 
acquisitions were made in the financial 
year to complement our Escrow and 
Assurance divisions.
Overall Group revenues for the  
year grew by 31% to £46.8m (2008: 
£35.7m). Excluding the acquisitions, 
the Group showed very strong organic 
growth of 19%. Adjusted operating 
profits increased by 19% to £12.7m 
(2008: £10.7m). Adjusted pre-tax profits 
were up 17% to £12.3m (2008: £10.5m) 
and fully diluted adjusted earnings  
per share increased 17% to 26.1p 
(2008: 22.4p). 
Group margins remained strong.  
Our adjusted operating profit margin  
was 27% (2008: 30%) changing  
as expected as a result of acquiring  
non escrow businesses whose margins  
are closer to 15%.
The Group continues to be highly cash 
generative and has only £5.6m net 
debt at the year end after meeting the 
initial payments on two acquisitions and 
completing the cash payments of two 
earn outs. Operating cash conversion 
represented 140% of operating profits 
(2008: 122%).
NCC Group has further enhanced 
its reputation as a consistent, strong 
deliverer of reliable growth and 
has maintained its commitment to 
shareholders by further improving the 
dividend for the year to 9.25p, up 32%.
Operations
Our worldwide Escrow businesses 
are the cornerstone of the Group’s 
profitability and provide a notably high 
degree of recurring revenue due to the 
high contracts renewals base. Organic  
revenue growth in the year was 13%,  
with strong performances from the 
overseas operations.
For Escrow UK, growth in the first half 
of the year was slower than the Board 
would have liked, as our clients were 
affected by the severity and speed of the 
economic downturn which curtailed their 
investment in IT software and services. 
The Group also experienced a fall off in 
demand for our verification services. In 
the first six months, overall growth was 
1%. In the second six months, due to 
swift action taken to refocus the sales 
message, new contract and verifications 
growth was once again 10%.
At an operating profit level the Escrow 
businesses overall grew by 15% 
to £11.7m (2008: £10.2m) with all 
geographies seeing double digit growth.
In Assurance Testing, revenues grew 
by 49% and profitability by 67% as the 
benefits of our acquisitions over the 
last few years continued to be realised. 
Secure Test saw another year of solid 
growth, growing organically by 31%  
and Site Confidence saw a 9% growth  
in sales.
The acquisition of NGS broadened our 
appeal in the ethical security market by 
further increasing our technical expertise 
and adding forensics skills and research 
to our already strong set of propositions.
Assurance Testing continues to  
benefit from the integration of the  
various units acquired to date and is 
focusing on improving its operating 
margins, which grew to 15% from  
13% in the previous year.
Consultancy continues to focus on  
being a key provider in the information 
security standards arena and the 
business saw a 36% growth in 
revenues. Operating profits grew by  
4% as the general IT consultancy 
market, which we have been moving 
away from during the last two years,  
has continued to be very competitive. 
 
People
NCC Group remains committed  
to being a first class employer and 
we recognise our dedicated and 
hardworking team is the major reason  
for the Group’s continued success. 
We have always worked hard to  
recruit only the best and we continue  
to ensure all employee bonus plans 
motivate towards the Group’s long  
term success. On behalf of the  
Board, I would like to congratulate  
and thank all employees of NCC Group 
who have made this year such a  
success during this very demanding  
and uncertain time.
Board Changes
As the Group has grown and developed 
so the Board has evolved. We were 
delighted to welcome Debbie Hewitt  
on 18 September 2008, as a Non 
Executive Director. She brings with  
her a first class business acumen and 
strong background of people skills.
I would also like to welcome David 
McKeith who will join us on 29 July 
2009. David brings strong professional 
financial skills to further complement  
the Board and will replace Eurfyl  
ap Gwilym who retires at the AGM  
after five years with the Group.  
I would like to put on record mine 
and the Group’s sincere thanks for  
his time with us, joining as he did at  
the time of flotation and helping us 
become an established and well 
respected PLC. Debbie Hewitt will  
chair the Remuneration Committee 
following Eurfyl’s departure.

Overview  13_NCC Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 NCC Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009_14 
NCC Group has a very strong market 
leading position in all of the niches in 
which it operates and the services and 
advice it provides is as far away from 
discretionary expenditure as it can be. 
The Group also continues to evolve its 
range of offerings to ensure it maintains 
its market leading positions.
The start to the year sees Group Escrow 
renewals at £14.9m, up from £13.6m 
achieved in the financial year to 31 May 
2009 and a verification order book of 
£2.0m, of which £0.6m relates to Escrow 
Europe and Escrow US. 
The Assurance Testing businesses’ order 
books have improved to £9.4m (2008: 
£7.1m), included in this is £2.9m (2008: 
£2.5m) from the Consultancy division. 
The division also has £4.1m of monitoring 
renewals forecast for the coming financial 
year (2008: £3.8m). 
The outlook for NCC Group is good 
and the Board remains very confident 
in the Group’s ability to deliver further 
sustainable growth.

CHAIRMAN’S
REPORT
CONTINUED
THE START TO THE 
YEAR SEES OUR 
GROUP ESCROW 
RENEWALS AT 
£14.9M
The Operational Board, which runs the 
day to day affairs of the Group, has 
been revised to reflect the enlarged 
Group. It now predominately operates 
as two business strands, Escrow and 
Assurance Testing. Roger Rawlinson has 
been promoted to Managing Director of 
Assurance Testing and we are currently 
in the process of recruiting a Managing 
Director to lead our global Group of 
Escrow businesses. 
Corporate Governance
NCC Group has always maintained 
that for a business such as ours, which 
acts as an independent trusted advisor 
to its clients, the highest standards of 
corporate governance and application of 
the most prudent accounting standards 
are essential. 
NCC Group will continue to take every 
practical step to adhere to the revised 
Combined Code, with which we comply 
fully and will continue using FTSE 250 
companies as our benchmark.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 6.25p per share which  
makes a total for the year of 9.25p 
(2008: 7.00p). If approved at the  
Annual General Meeting, the dividend  
will be paid on 25 September 2009 
to shareholders on the register at  
28 August 2009. The ex-dividend date 
will be 26 August 2009.
I WOULD 
LIKE TO 
CONGRATULATE 
AND THANK ALL 
EMPLOYEES OF 
NCC GROUP 
WHO HAVE 
MADE THIS 
YEAR SUCH 
A SUCCESS
WE HAVE ALWAYS 
WORKED HARD 
TO RECRUIT ONLY  
THE BEST
Outlook
NCC Group continues to make 
a virtue of acting independently 
and operating as trusted, 
equitable advisors. To date it 
has successfully acquired and 
integrated seven businesses that 
have complemented its service 
and delivery offerings. The Group 
has an outstanding track record 
of organic growth and a sound 
business model that it will continue 
to evolve and develop to grow the 
business further.
The economic landscape has 
fundamentally shifted over the last 
year and for many businesses  
this is causing considerable 
hardship and has led to a period  
of uncertainty. 
For NCC Group, that is not the 
case. The decisive action taken 
over the last three years has 
ensured the Group has and will 
continue to weather this economic 
storm and the Board is confident 
the business will go from strength 
to strength.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REVIEW
Corporate Overview
The Group delivered 31% growth in 
revenues and growth of 17% in adjusted 
pre tax profits, emphasising the strength 
of the Group’s proposition despite the 
global economic uncertainty faced by all 
businesses over the last year. 
Overall the Group delivered £46.8m 
revenue, up from £35.7m in 2008 and 
adjusted operating profits of £12.7m,  
up 19% from £10.7m in 2008. 
The last five years of solid growth, 
revenue CAGR of 25% and 22% for 
adjusted operating profit, demonstrate 
the success of our strategy of focused 
sustainable organic growth, allied to 
carefully targeted acquisitions.
Market and Positioning
It is without doubt a difficult and 
uncertain global and domestic  
economic environment in which to 
operate, with the financial world 
continuing to change shape rapidly  
and the future still only being measured  
in months rather than years.
 
The Board believes that the basic 
underpinning of demand for its products 
and services has remained unchanged. 
However, it is very aware that business 
investment in new infrastructure and 
software continues to be considerably 
less than it has seen over the last few 
years, as corporations defer decisions  
and as a consequence, implementations 
and upgrades.
The IT software and services market 
is also under attack from cost cutters. 
Decision making ability is being removed 
and authority levels are being reduced. 
Discretionary expenditure has been 
culled. However, selling is still very much 
possible, providing it is in the right area 
with the right products. 
Although NCC Group was not  
immune from the downturn, its 
positioning helped to avoid the worst 
effects of the downturn in the domestic 
economy as its products and services  
fall into the non-discretionary  
expenditure category.
NCC Group remains the largest 
provider of escrow services in the world. 
Furthermore, it is the only provider 
that mandates quality ahead of price 
and does not intend to change that 
philosophy. There are no signs that the 
very small virtual providers who offer 
a low cost, low value proposition are 
gaining traction in the market. The Board 
believes their future is in jeopardy as 
the market shows no sign of wanting to 
make false economy by trusting part of 
their disaster recovery and risk mitigation 
plans to unknown organisations.
The dynamics of the escrow market have 
not materially changed since the Group 
floated in 2004 and the same market 
assumptions, as detailed by Gartner at 
the time, remain. As was confirmed then, 
many companies were significantly less 
protected than they should be and apart 
from those the Group has worked closely 
with, the Board still believes that to be  
the case. 
Both the public and private sector still 
typically believe that they have several 
times more cover than they actually do 
have. They are still unaware that they 
should have considerably more. The 
UK escrow market without verification 
testing is still very niche and the 
Group estimates that the market size 
is approximately £100m, which still 
provides NCC Group with considerable 
headroom for growth.
Within Assurance Testing, the market 
for Secure Test and NGS, the ethical 
security testing and forensics service 
providers, continues to see strong 
growth. Media headlines continue to 
highlight embarrassing and avoidable 
examples of poor security that have 
resulted in real data and financial loss.
Within Assurance Testing, the Group 
has the largest team of CESG CHECK 
accredited ethical security testers in 
the UK, with currently over 100 testers. 
NCC Group is committed to investing in 
the number of employees who have the 
CHECK or equivalent Crest qualification 
to ensure that as the Group and the 
industry grows, the highest ethical and 
technical standards are maintained.
The information security side of the 
Consultancy division now fits well into 
Assurance Testing. NCC Group is fast 
becoming the name of choice for major 
companies wanting to ensure that they 
are best placed to protect themselves 
and their business assets from attack. 
The Group provides information security 
advice from every perspective, especially 
for those organisations that are covered 
by the PCI Data Security Standards. 
NCC Group’s position in the information 
security market is further enhanced by 
being accredited PCI Auditors and by 
having more CLAS consultants in the  
UK than anybody else.
The Group is managed through two 
distinct business units, Group Escrow 
and Assurance Testing. Each is run 
independently by an autonomous 
management team responsible for setting 
and, after Board approval, delivering its 
own plans, with each area being tasked 
with generating organic growth. 
This change from three to two divisions 
reflects the very substantial shift in 
consulting activity, as it becomes even 
closer to Assurance Testing and as 
the Group withdraws further from the 
low margin commoditised areas of 
consulting. All future reporting will follow 
this structure, with non-information 
security consulting being disclosed 
separately in the Assurance Division.
Business Performance
The Group grew revenue by 31% to 
£46.8m and adjusted operating profits  
by 19% to £12.7m. More importantly, 
we saw our recurring income levels 
consolidate. In Escrow UK nearly  
89% of all contracts renewed, whilst  
in Assurance Testing, 79% of prior  
year testing revenue was retained,  
with those customers spending on 
average 24% more with us at nearly 
£22,000 per renewal. In addition, 90%  
of our performance monitoring and  
load testing revenues were renewed 
and are recurring.
As a Group, we continue to generate 
strong margins, with our adjusted 
operating profit margin remaining  
strong at 27% (2008: 30%) in line  
with expectations. The change in  
margin is, as always, the effect of 
acquiring non-escrow businesses  
whose margins are closer to 15%.
As has always been the case, the Group 
had no reliance on one customer or 
sector for its revenue. The analysis is as 
follows and shows a consistent trend.

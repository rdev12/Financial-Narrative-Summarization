 Introduction
In this section, we summarise the purpose of our Remuneration Policy and its linkage to our corporate strategic objectives. We 
highlight the performance and remuneration outcomes for the 2014/15 financial year. More detail can be found in the Remuneration 
Policy Report and Annual Report on Remuneration.
Our remuneration policy and its link to our Group strategy
The Group’s strategy is laid out on pages 14-17. The key elements of the Company’s strategy and how its successful 
implementation is linked to the Company’s remuneration are set out in the following table.

performance underpinned 
by balanced and profitable 
growth measured  
by PBT and EPS
 – Remain a cash generative 
business which will support 
a progressive dividend 
policy and ensure long-term 
value for shareholders
 – Continue to put 
innovation at the centre of 
our business to meet

Annual bonus metrics
Maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 150% of salary.
 – two thirds of the total 
bonus to be paid 
immediately in cash
 – one third deferred into 
shares subject to a three 
year vesting period
Profit before tax growth
An incentive to grow in 
the core markets is 
provided in the short term 
through the profit before 
tax (‘PBT’) growth and 
cashflow targets in the 
Annual Bonus Plan.
Group cash flow
The success in 
maximising operational 
excellence will be 
reflected through 
increased profitability  
and cash flow.
Encouraged through bonus 
deferral and shareholding 
requirements.
LTIP metrics
Maximum annual award is 
200% of salary.
Awards will vest at the end of 
three years subject to the 
achievement of:
 – stretching EPS conditions 
which provide alignment to 
our core strategic priorities
 – relative TSR performance of 
the Company which provides 
alignment to the success  
of our business in delivering 
value to our shareholders 
compared with relevant 
comparator companies
An incentive to grow this 
market in the longer term 
is provided through EPS 
growth targeted by  
the LTIP.
The success in 
maximising operational 
excellence will be 
measured through the 
long term through EPS 
growth targeted by the 
LTIP . In addition, sustained 
value generation will be 
reflected in the share 
price of the Company 
which will be measured 
through the Company’s 
TSR performance under 
the LTIP.
TSR and EPS
The generation of cash and 
PBT growth targeted by the 
annual bonus will help 
enhance the value  
of the Company which will 
be measured through the 
success of the Company’s 
TSR performance against  
its comparators (a 
performance condition 
under the LTIP).
Minimum shareholding

Notes:

 Executive Directors were provided a one-off award on IPO (‘IPO Award’). For the Executive Chairman and the Group Chief Financial Officer, share awards fully 
vested on IPO (with the sale restrictions on the shares to be lifted on 29 May 2015 in accordance with the lock-up arrangements outlined in the IPO prospectus). 
2
 The Group Chief Executive Officer was provided a cash award and a share award on IPO. 
a. Cash award of £4m awarded based on continued employment. 25% immediately on the IPO, 25% on the first anniversary of the award and 50% on the 
second anniversary; this was part of the buy-out on the recruitment of the Group Chief Executive Officer to compensate for awards lapsing on his ceasing 
employment with his former employer.
b. Share award consisted of a one-off award on IPO of share options calculated by reference to £4m divided by Saga’s share price on Admission of £1.85. 
25% will vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of the award, 25% on the fourth anniversary and 50% on the fifth anniversary. The exercise 
price associated with the options is £1.85 and therefore the value on grant date was £nil. This was part of the buy-out on the recruitment of the Group Chief 
Executive Officer to compensate for awards lapsing on his ceasing employment with his former employer.

The Policy remuneration that could be payable to each of the Executive Directors is based on salaries at the start of 2014/15, 
under three different performance scenarios: (i) Minimum; (ii) Target; and (iii) Maximum. The elements of remuneration have 
been categorised into three components: (i) Fixed; (ii) Annual Bonus (Deferred Bonus); and (iii) LTIP. In addition, for the 
purposes of comparison we have included the actual single figure remuneration paid in 2014/15 (excluding one-off entitlements 
set out in the ‘Other’ column of the single total figure table on page 76).

Annual report and accounts  
for the year ending 31 January 2015 Shareholding requirements in operation at the company are currently 200% of base salary for the Executive Chairman and 
Group Chief Executive Officer and 150% for the Group Chief Financial Officer.
Executive Directors are required to build up their shareholdings over a reasonable amount of time which would normally 
be five years and then subsequently hold a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of base salary. 
The number of shares of the Company in which current Directors had a beneficial interest and details of long-term incentive

Notes
 – The closing share price of £1.833 as at 30 January 2015 has been taken for the purpose of calculating the current shareholding (i.e. value of beneficially 
owned shares and value of/gain on interests over shares) as a percentage of salary.
 – Value of/gain on interests over shares comprises unvested 2014 LTIP awards. The one-off IPO share option award for the Group Chief Executive Officer  
has an exercise price of £1.85, hence there was no gain on these awards as at 30 January 2015.
 – Unvested LTIP shares and options do not count towards satisfaction of the shareholding guidelines.
 – In addition, Andrew Goodsell and Stuart Howard have an interest via Acromas Holdings Limited, which has a 100% shareholding in Acromas Bid Co Limited.

Maximum bonus opportunity as a percentage of salary:

The annual bonus will be paid in cash and deferred shares.

The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that given the 
commercial sensitivity arising in relation to the detailed financial 
targets used for the annual bonus, disclosing precise targets for the 
bonus plan in advance would not be in shareholder interests. Actual 
targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published 
at the end of the performance periods so shareholders can fully 
assess the basis for any payouts under the annual bonus.

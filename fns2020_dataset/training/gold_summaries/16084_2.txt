Commentary
“The Group made further good progress during 2008. Profits and earnings 
increased significantly and we successfully implemented a number of key 
initiatives that will provide us with a stronger platform from which to grow 
and develop.
  “Despite the challenges in the wider economy, our clients remain   
                           committed to transforming public services and working with   
                              partners to improve performance, reduce costs and effect  
                               change. Whilst the pressures on public sector spending are  
                               likely to increase, we are encouraged by our current levels  
                               of committed income and the strength of the sales pipeline  
                              and we believe that Tribal is well-positioned to make further  
                                  progress in 2009.”

Demolition of the former silos at the
Gainsborough site is underway for Pelham Homes.
We propose to build between 80 and 110 new

detached houses on the initial phase. Some
homes will be on the riverside, overlooking the
River Trent. 
This 5.5 acre site will take about 2 years to
complete with total sales in the region of £5
million. The silos have been on the site for at
least 50 years.

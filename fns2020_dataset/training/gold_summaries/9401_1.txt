 Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
The installed base increased in all regions by
between 17% and 63%. The strongest growth
was in the USA where monitors sold/placed and
revenue were up 349% and 121% respectively
including distributor stocking sales.
06 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Overview
This was another productive year during
which the Group maintained growth,
repaid its borrowings and reduced
distribution costs whilst significantly
expanding its route to market. Sales
increased by 18% to £5.4m, split between
42% capital (including licence fees) and
58% recurring revenue. We are in a strong
position to generate continued growth,
with the right products, a strengthened
balance sheet and increasing sales
resources.
The worldwide recession and the
requirement for universal healthcare
coverage in the USA means that hospital
finances are under increasing stress.
Reducing complications, wound and
central line infections and length of stay
in high-risk surgery patients has become
a prime objective. During the year we
accumulated new clinical data and
improved customer awareness of the
potential savings from using LiDCO’s
products. Abstracts and papers on the
use of our technology in: organ
transplantation, major and bariatric
surgery, intensive care and cardiology
were published by investigators in Europe,
the USA and Asia. Customers have an
increasingly strong evidence-based
business case for the adoption of
advanced hemodynamic monitoring.
The use of LiDCO technology on high-risk
surgery patients can reduce complications
by more than a third, costs by £4,800 per
patient and hospital stay by up to 12
days¹. The LiDCOrapid monitor can be
used to optimise fluids and blood flow
both in or outside of surgery and in
conscious or ventilated patients. Other
products that are incrementally invasive
and/or that can only be easily used in
ventilated patients, are often less practical
for the management of the whole surgical
pathway.
In the USA, new legislation will extend
healthcare cover to an additional 32
million people. This programme is also
trying to lower costs through a series of
public policy mechanisms within Medicare
and Medicaid and is likely over time to
fundamentally change the way doctors
are reimbursed and will encourage the
adoption of the safest, cheapest and most
effective medical procedures. The USA is
currently spending 15.3% of GDP on
healthcare – about double that of the UK.
Medicare has decided not to reimburse
healthcare providers for treatment of
hospital-acquired infections. We believe
this will encourage use of LiDCO products
to implement fluid optimisation strategies
in high-risk patients.
Worldwide, there looks to be a general
need to improve the efficiency of
treatments for high-risk patients, and
ultimately there is likely to be convergence
on what is “best practice”. Companies
that are proven to provide the best, most
cost-effective and most widely adoptable
technology will prosper. Hospitals will also
require training in the adoption of new
technology and “best practice”; this is
why we are developing further training
materials and a hemodynamic workshop
in conjunction with St George’s Hospital,
London.
Outlook and prospects
The global market for hemodynamic
monitoring products will continue to
grow. We estimate worldwide sales
revenues for minimally invasive
hemodynamic monitoring products grew
by less than the average 30% seen in the
previous two years. We believe this was
a consequence of global economic
disruption coupled with what proved
to be reduced, or in some cases entirely
absent capital and disposable revenue
budgets. However, market drivers remain
and have become more relevant.
Customers will continue to move away
from the use of the older, invasive catheter
products. Medicare in the USA is no
longer prepared to pay hospitals for
treatment of catheter and surgery related
complications and infections.
The focus is shifting from hospitals
increasing the number of surgeries
undertaken towards improving the quality
of care. In the UK, NHS expenditure at
7.7% of GDP is forecast to be ring fenced
to the extent possible given the deficit
and economy. So it is likely that the NHS
will need to make annual efficiency
savings of more than £4bn by 2012-13.
Expectations regarding hospital efficiency
savings are outlined in a new national
programme: QIPP – Quality, Innovation,
Productivity and Prevention. A key
element of this programme is pathway
redesign. In particular, the increasing
adoption of ‘enhanced’ surgical pathways
is encouraged. Elements of the pathways
include better pre-operative assessment
and planning; the goal being to reduce
the stress of the operation with post-
operative care structured around
achieving the earliest recovery. Better
intra-operative fluid management and,
if necessary, continued hemodynamic
monitoring and targeted post-operative
oxygen delivery are necessary to achieve
the best results. 07 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Markets
In April 2009 an exclusive sales and
marketing licence for the LiDCOrapid was
granted to BD in Japan. In July, Aspect
Medical was appointed as distributor for
the LiDCOrapid for the USA. BD and
Covidien, – who acquired Aspect in
October – are major global medical
technology groups. The combined up-
front licence fees from these distribution
agreements amounted to £940,000.
The Group had a record year in terms of
the number of monitors sold and placed
in hospitals; the lower priced LiDCOrapid
was the key driver behind this. Capital
sales, excluding Med One sales, are
reflective of the increased numbers sold
and were up by £210,000 (13%).
LiDCO’s strategy is to sell directly to
hospitals in the UK and work with
existing third party distributors in export
territories. The new US arrangements
materially improved sales force
representation while significantly reducing
our US distribution costs by about
£650,000 per annum. The integration
of Covidien’s Nellcor critical care and
Aspect’s surgery sales teams took place
this February. The enlarged team, which
we believe to be the largest monitoring
equipment sales force in the USA gives us
a far greater reach into the USA than was
originally envisaged with Aspect.
Sales in the USA doubled across the
period through the above changes in
the distribution channel. All sales staff
have now had at least their initial training
and are incentivised through a sales
commission plan. Further training is an
on-going process. New accounts have
already been secured and we expect
the sales pipeline to grow substantially
during 2010.

We anticipate that BD’s sales in Japan will
start in 2011.
In the UK we expect the hemodynamic
monitoring market to continue to grow,
and we have a developing pipeline of new
accounts. There is a growing expectation
that hospitals will adopt hemodynamic
monitoring as part of their plans to re-
engineer surgical pathways. We have
recruited a new UK sales manager and
are looking to add to our sales and nurse
educator team in the year. We are also
excited about our collaboration with the
St George’s Hospital simulation centre in
London, where we will be running regular
courses that deal with the practical
implementation of our technology.
The staff there who have used our
technology for many years and have
experience of saving up to 12 bed days
per high-risk surgery patient undergoing
LiDCO-directed therapies.
A study was conducted using LiDCO’s
products that assessed the value of
simultaneous brain and hemodynamic
monitoring during major peripheral
vascular surgery in high-risk patients.
The technical synergies between
Covidien’s depth of anesthesia monitoring
(BIS) and LiDCO’s technology have great
potential to deliver the market’s most
evolved fluid and hemodynamic
monitoring product. Combining these
technologies into a monitor on the
LiDCOrapid platform is an exciting and
commercially valuable project that is now
underway. Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
continued
We are optimistic about sales in 2010,
although still concerned about the economy
and the return to economic growth. We expect
good disposables sales revenue growth in all
territories, as monitors installed in the latter
part of 2009 begin to contribute to disposables
revenues, augmented by additional income
generated by our expanded sales force.
08 LiDCO Annual Report 2009/10
Sales and trading
Revenues were up 18% to £5.37m
(2008: £4.53m), with a 73% increase in
the number of LiDCO monitors sold /
placed in the year (565 up vs 326).
Disposables numbers were up 26% at
37,918 and associated income was also
up, by 21% at £3.13m. Export sales now
represent 66% of income – up from 52%.
Disposable revenue growth and the
higher numbers of monitors placed have
been driven by demand for the
LiDCOrapid through our expanded
distribution network. Monitor sales,
excluding Med One sales, are more
reflective of the increased numbers sold
and were in fact up by £210,000 (13%).
Paradoxically, total capital income
(including Med One income) was down
£104,000. This was a consequence of the
higher number of lower priced
LiDCOrapid monitors sold coupled to prior
period capital revenues being improved
by the sales of monitors placed in the UK
(£314,000) to Med One. Although sales
of placed monitors to Med One have been
useful in the past to improve cash flow
and to reduce risk, our stronger capital
base means that we are now in a position
to finance this ourselves – hence there
were no such sales in the period.
The installed base at the year end stands
at 2075 units, an increase of 37% in the
year. The LiDCOrapid portion of this grew
by 514 units, an increase of 84% over the
previous year and now represents 38% of
the installed base. This has been achieved
within 21 months of launch and across a
turbulent economic period. As previously
reported, the focus necessary to launch
and promote the LiDCOrapid had a knock-
on effect on the growth and capital
revenues from sales of our calibrated
product – the LiDCOplus monitor.
The lack of capital budgets in hospitals
delayed product sales for most of the year.
The disposables revenues almost certainly
underplay the full impact the increase in
installed base is likely to have on future
disposables sales. As monitors are
transferred from distributors into hospitals,
LiDCOrapid smart card sales should
produce further growth in this income
stream.
Geographic segmental sales reporting
The installed base increased in all regions
by between 17% and 63%. The strongest
growth was in the USA where monitors
sold/placed and revenue were up 349%
and 121% respectively including
distributor stocking sales. In the UK,
despite a severe slowdown in activity by
the NHS, particularly in the first half of the
year, the number of monitors sold/placed
increased modestly 47 vs 43. However,
overall revenues were affected negatively
by hospitals moving to the placing model
of acquisition, rather than capital purchase
(16 vs 8), and greater numbers of lower
priced LiDCOrapid monitors in the mix of
monitors sold. In continental Europe,
distributor stocks moved more slowly than
expected to their respective customers,
resulting in a general destocking of
monitors occurring during the period.
We expect sales of monitors to European
distributors to improve in 2010. However,
there are continuing issues for some
territories as distributors have to fund cash
flow issues stemming from increasingly
delayed payment times.

Disposables units sold increased in all
regions with income up in UK, USA and
ROW cumulatively up by £0.6m (29%).
Although disposables unit numbers in the
EU rose by 4%, income was down
£40,000 due to a mix shift towards the
lower transfer price of the LiDCOrapid
smart card. Some cannibalisation of
higher priced LiDCOplus sensor sales
by lower price LiDCOrapid disposables,
at both hospital and distributor levels,
has clearly occurred in the year. Whilst this
may continue, it should be increasingly
diluted by the growing LiDCOrapid sales
into new accounts where LiDCOplus
monitors have not been purchased.
We are optimistic about sales in 2010, although still concerned about the
economy and the return to economic growth. We expect good disposables
sales revenue growth in all territories, as monitors installed in the latter part
of 2009 begin to contribute to disposables revenues, augmented by

 Report of the Directors
Chief Executive Officer’s review
Taking this role is an honour and privilege, but equally a huge 
responsibility. These are tough times; and tough times demand 
the very best of all of us. That is the spirit in which I intend to 
take the business forward.
Despite the fact that I have joined the Group at a time of 
unprecedented economic turmoil, my first message to you is a 
positive and reassuring one: your company is in good shape. The 
scale and the extent of the changes over the last four years have 
been a positive surprise to me. They have made Unilever stronger 
and more confident, well placed to weather the storms currently 
blowing through all sectors of the economy.
I want first, therefore, to acknowledge the hard work and 
dedication of Unilever employees all around the world. Thanks 
to their efforts, Unilever is a leaner, more focused business with  
a strong portfolio of leading brands. All this is vital given the 
intense nature of the competitive and economic environment.
The transformation was led with a mixture of skill and 
determination by my predecessor, Patrick Cescau, and I want to  
take this opportunity to recognise Patrick’s accomplishments as 
C h i e f 	 E x e c u t i v e . 	 He 	 l e a v e s 	 a 	 r e m a r k a b l e 	 l e g a c y : 	 a 	 w i d e - r a n g i n g	
change programme combined with steadily improving results.  
In short, the engine was replaced while the car kept running. 
Quite an achievement and I am grateful to Patrick for what he 
hands over.
Last year saw an acceleration of Unilever’s transformation agenda.

across all regions. During the last year we closed or sold a 
further 14 sites, bringing the total to 30 over the last two 
years. We are now on course to exceed our target – set in 
2007 – of closing or streamlining 50 to 60 sites by 2010. All 
these projects are being handled with great sensitivity to the 
workforce. Together they are helping to provide Unilever with 
a modern, cost competitive supply chain, capable of meeting 
the demands of competing in the 21
st
 century. To further aid 
speed and efficiency, we have brought all our logistical and 
supply chain operations in Europe together in one regional 
structure based in Switzerland. And we are currently embarked 
on a similar move in Asia by centralising our supply chain 
management for the region in Singapore.

This included the sale of the North American laundry business. 
We also divested some smaller, non-strategic parts of our 
portfolio, including Boursin cheese, Lawry’s seasonings and 
the Bertolli olive oil businesses. These deals were all done at 
good prices, achieving significant value for the company. At 
the same time, the acquisition in 2008 of the leading Russian 
ice cream maker, Inmarko, filled an important gap in a critical 
market for us. And we are in the process of obtaining a vital 
entry into the fast-growing salon sector of the hair care market 
with our planned acquisition of the TIGI hair product business. 
We are also alive to similar value-creating opportunities that 
may present themselves during the year.
It is a great pleasure to report  
to you for the first time as 
Unilever’s Chief Executive  
Officer. I am delighted to be  
a part of the team and to have 
the opportunity of leading  
this great company.

Chief Executive Officer Underpinning these strengths, Unilever exhibits a set of deeply 
ingrained values – based on trust and integrity – which date 
back to the days of its founders and which are so well captured 
in the concept of ‘doing well by doing good’. These values will 
never be compromised, no matter how difficult the economic 
conditions become, and nor will the Group’s commitment to 
help tackle deep-seated global issues in such areas as nutrition 
and hygiene. In pursuit of these objectives we continue to work 
closely alongside agencies like the World Food Programme (WFP) 
and UNICEF. In 2008, our partnership with the WFP extended 
its scope to six countries and delivered 16 million meals to  
76 000 schoolchildren. 
Given the increasing problems of resource scarcity around  
the world, it is also vital that we take a lead on the issue of 
sustainable consumption. That is why we have made a clear 
commitment to move to sustainable palm oil sourcing by 2015 
and are working with Greenpeace and others to achieve this 
challenging objective.
It was heartening to see the Group’s commitment to these 
issues publicly recognised and rewarded in 2008. For the tenth 
year running Unilever was named foods sector leader in the 
Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes – the only company ever to 
achieve such an accolade. And the award of Platinum standard 
in the UK’s Business in the Community Corporate Responsibility 
Index was further recognition of the Group’s willingness to act 
as an agent for social and environmental improvement.
All these attributes, I believe, will not only help to sustain  
the Group during a period of economic difficulty, but are also  
the pillars of long-term competitive advantage and a high 
performing business.

underestimate the challenges ahead. If we are to prosper, we 
will need to continue the programme of organisational change, 
further increasing our ability to move quickly and decisively in 
response to shifting market dynamics. But internal change must 
be accompanied by greater external focus: we have to put the 
consumer and the customer at the heart of everything we do. 
This external focus, coupled with speed and discipline, will be 
the key to success.
These will be our guiding principles as we manage the business 
through a period of continuing turbulence and prepare for the 
future. We are also taking a number of additional steps:

to a new level. The move to a ‘One Unilever’ R&D structure 
under the Group’s Chief R&D Officer, Professor Geneviève Berger, 
will help us to win in the marketplace by focusing on fewer, 
bigger innovations – and rolling them out more swiftly around 
the world.

Through the appointment of a Global Supply Chain Officer, we 
are looking for even better ways to leverage our scale in global 
buying and thereby reduce the overall cost of raw materials.

greater than the previous year. To drive the process even 
further we have appointed our first Chief Procurement 
Officer. We expect a continued strong programme in  
2009 and beyond.

units are integrated into a single operating structure – became  
a reality across most of the Group’s key markets, bringing 
greater speed and simplicity to all our operations.
These changes contributed to a good set of business results  
in 2008. We achieved strong underlying sales growth of 7.4%, 
broadly based across all our major product categories. Growth 
was driven by increased pricing as the Group moved quickly and 
decisively to offset the unprecedented rise in commodity costs.

of investment behind our brands, while at the same time 
delivering an underlying improvement in operating margin.
By any standards, this represents solid progress and a good  
set of results. 
Ho w e v e r , 	 d e s p i t e 	 t h e 	 po si t i v e 	 c h a ng e s 	 t o 	 t h e 	 b u si n e ss , 	 t h e r e 	 a r e	
still a number of areas in which we need to improve. Our market 
share positions suggest we are not yet winning in enough of the

has been made but again there is still work to do. In order to 
invest behind our brands and win the battles for the hearts and 
minds of an increasingly value conscious consumer, we must 
eliminate all the costs that consumers are unwilling to pay for. 
Growing our volume base, while keeping closely focused on 
protecting our margins and cash flow, will be our priority in 2009. 
The economic environment is unprecedented and will require 
flexibility and fast action. But Unilever has long experience of 
operating in difficult markets and at times of great economic 
stress. It should be remembered that the Group was born in the 
era of the Great Depression of the 1930s. On each occasion 
since, it has learnt from the experience and emerged stronger 
and more resilient as a business. There are good reasons to  
believe we can do so again.
For one thing, we possess a highly relevant and inspiring mission. 
Vitality – with its emphasis on helping people to feel good, look 
good and get more out of life – resonates with the hopes and 
aspirations of consumers the world over. Vitality is even more valid 
today as consumers face increasingly tough economic challenges. 
That is why we have made it the theme of this year’s report and 
why we want to extend the concept of vitality right the way 
through our products, our organisation and our engagement 
with societies at large.
We have an excellent, balanced portfolio of strong brands

more and we are not overly exposed to the premium sector at  
a time when this segment of the market is under increasing 
pressure. We have strong, well-established businesses in many  
of the world’s fastest growing markets and our global presence  
is building all the time. Add to this the Group’s simplified 
organisation and a sound and healthy financial structure and 
you can see why, we believe, Unilever is so well placed to win.

 RB Annual Report 2013 1
Strategic Report   Chairman’s Statement
will update Shareholders on the review’s 
progress during 2014. 
Cash and Dividend
The strong growth produced strong 
cash flow, allowing the Company to pay 
down more of its debt. The Company is 
in strong financial health and your Board 
is proposing a final dividend of 77p per 
share. This brings the dividend for the 
year to 137p per share, an increase of 
2% over 2012. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
In addition to being a financial 
contributor to society, the Company  
is also a contributor to environmental 
and humanitarian needs of society.  
The Company was proud to announce 
a major new global initiative with Save 
the Children, a longstanding partner, to 
address the scourge of child deaths from 
diarrhoea, which is highly preventable 
through better health and hygiene. 
Corporate Governance
The detailed Corporate Governance 
Statement and Report on pages 24 
to 32 reflects the Board’s recognition 
of the importance of our governance 
responsibilities. 
The Board conducted regular reviews 
of the performance of the business, 
its strategy, brands, human resources, 
corporate responsibility and reputation 
and business risks. It was decided 
to change the trading name of the 
Company to ‘RB’, moving away from  
the harder to say, spell and search 
‘Reckitt Benckiser’. There are no  
changes to legal entity names.
Board of Directors
It was with great regret that I accepted 
in June the resignation due to ill health 
of Graham Mackay, our then Senior 
Independent Director. Graham sadly 
passed away in December. He delivered 
great service to your Company over 
his eight years on the Board and will 
be missed. André Lacroix has been 
appointed Senior Independent Director.
On behalf of the Board I have 
pleasure in reporting that your 
Company delivered strong  
results ahead of targets for  
2013. Net revenue excluding  
RB Pharmaceuticals grew 7%, 
operating profit (adjusted)

 excluding 
RB Pharmaceuticals grew 7%, and

 net income grew at 2%,  
all at constant exchange rates. 
The Company’s twin strategy is to  
focus on growing the health and 
hygiene brands of its core portfolio and 
to achieve a stronger emerging market 
penetration to better balance its historic 
developed market strength. 
At the end of 2013, health and hygiene 
brands represented 72% of the core 
portfolio and the emerging market  
areas represented 43%. This progress  
is pleasing but equally so were the  
results in Europe and North America 
which achieved growth in every  
quarter of the year. Our acquisitions,  
more fully reported elsewhere in  
this report, contributed materially to 
these achievements. 
RB Pharmaceuticals
After the entry of generic US  
competition to RB Pharmaceuticals’ 
Suboxone and the stable performance  
of the Film alternative, your Board 
announced a strategic review of this  
part of the Company. The review will 
recommend the optimal future for  
RB Pharmaceuticals and the Company 
New Purpose-inspired Strategy 
Delivers Strong Performance
In December, we appointed  
Nicandro Durante as an independent 
Non-Executive Director. Nicandro, an 
Italian/Brazilian and CEO of BAT, brings 
significant consumer goods industry and 
emerging markets experience. Also in 
December Richard Cousins advised me 
that he would not be available to stand 
for re-election to the Board. I thank 
Richard for his contributions to our 
Company. Judith Sprieser and Kenneth 
Hydon will step down as Chairs of the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees 
respectively in 2014. They have both 
been extraordinarily effective Chairs of 
the Committees.
Your Nominations Committee is 
actively involved in a project to appoint 
additional Non-Executive Directors. 
Annual General Meeting Resolutions
The resolutions to be voted on at our 
AGM on 7 May 2014, are explained in 
the Notice of Meeting, including the 
new requirement to offer Shareholders 
a binding vote on our Remuneration 
Policy, the details of which are set out in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 34 to 46. We believe this policy 
has served the Company well and hope 
Shareholders will endorse it. 
Thanks 
On behalf of the Board, I thank our 
CEO, Rakesh Kapoor, his executive 
management team and our employees 
globally for their commitment to 
delivering strong performance. The Board 
is often reminded that an enduring 
differentiator of the Company is its 
people and their positive performance-
minded culture. My thanks go also to 
my Board colleagues for their continued 
support and guidance. 
The Board thanks you, our Shareholders, 
for your on-going confidence in the 
Company.

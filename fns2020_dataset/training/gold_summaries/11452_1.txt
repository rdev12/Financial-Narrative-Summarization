Chief Executive’s Review 
Our latest acquisition of the Allergy IVD business of Allergopharma 
in December 2010 provides us access to the high value allergy 
testing market. We believe that this acquisition, together with 
two high profile instrument development programmes, will  
be transformational for the Group going forward which will 
significantly enhance the Group’s growth prospects.
I am pleased to report that the Group has 
seen an increase in revenue for the year  
to £7.90 million, some 27.4% ahead of last 
year’s figures (2010: £6.20 million) with 
like-for-like sales increasing by 12%. 
Strategy
While increasing revenue and profits through 
organic growth, significant progress was 
made in the year by acquiring the business 
and certain assets of the Allergy IVD business 
of Allergopharma. The allergy tests acquired 
complement the Group’s core Food Intolerance 
product offering. As well as the acquisition,  
it was recognised that to add more value we 
would need to enhance the future product 
offering by developing two new instrument 
systems which would allow us to access higher 
volume testing laboratories. (See Research 
and development).
Food Intolerance
Food Intolerance testing has seen growth  
of 21% in the year resulting in sales of  
£3.56 million (2010: £2.95 million).
For the Genarrayt
®
 laboratory system and 
on-going reagent sales we have seen good 
growth in sales to £1.68 million (2010: £1.04 
million). This growth has been achieved by  
the installation of 38 new systems as well as 
increasing the number of countries active with 
Genarrayt
® 
by six. This now brings the total 
number of installed systems to 95 since launch. 
Sales of Genarrayt
®
 systems fell slightly to 
£192k (2010: £212k) but sales of reagent kits 
increased dramatically to £1.49 million (2010: 
£828k). This shows the pull through effect of 
promoting Food Intolerance testing by placing 
new instruments and promoting test usage in 
partnership with our distributors.
The Food Detective
®
 test for Food Intolerance 
has seen sales fall marginally to £772k (2010: 
£790k). The number of countries where we 
have now sold product has continued to 
increase to 54 (2010: 46) with an increase in 
volumes to 41,665 kits (2010: 34,241). These 
volumes included bulk components supplied 
to a Chinese customer who assembles the 
kits locally with the effect that revenue  
has fallen marginally. The process of product 
registration in China is still proceeding but  
we are still managing to secure small sales  
for market seeding and evaluation purposes. 
Product registration has recently been 
achieved in India for an Indian specific test 
panel and the product was launched in 
February 2011 by our partner in India,  
Thermo Fisher Scientific. 
The UK market for Food Detective
®
 has seen 
a reduction in sales to £127k (2010: £216k) 
following a move to using professional 
re-sellers with lower transfer pricing in return 
for higher volume sales. In response to this 
result we have taken steps to return to  
direct selling ourselves by using web-based 
“ We fully expect that our 
anticipated growth in  
the BRIC countries will  
yield major growth.”

Overview
Business  
Review Governance
Financial  
Statements
marketing activities and targeted marketing  
to key customer groups. The testing services 
for Food Intolerance and other related tests 
have shown an increase in business to £452k 
(2010: £371k) which has mainly been due  
to increased sales to offshore accounts  
who send samples into the CNS laboratory 
for testing.
After the year end we signed an agreement 
with Toyota Tsusho America Inc for distribution 
of Food Detective
®
 in the United States. There 
is an anticipated timeline of approximately  
one to two years to gain clearance by the US 
Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) before 
we can start selling the product but we believe 
the potential market to be substantial.
Allergy/Autoimmune Disease
Allergy
Since acquiring the Allergy range in 
December 2010 sales of £955k have been 
achieved which has been dominated by sales 
to the German domestic market. Export sales 
to Russia and Poland have commenced and  
it is the growth of export sales through the 
Omega distribution network that is a priority 
for the Financial Year ahead.
Autoimmune Disease
Sales of autoimmune tests decreased  
by 11% to £584k (2010: £658k) as a direct 
result of not being able to supply a dedicated 
instrument platform in an increasingly 
automated market. We see further reductions 
in this business likely unless we can offer  
an instrument platform or technology to 
compete in this market. The application  
of the Genarrayt
®
 microarray technology  
to autoimmune disease testing still remains  
a possibility but other options are also being 
explored.
Infectious Disease/Other tests
Sales of Infectious Disease and Other tests 
increased to £2.80 million (2010: £2.59 million) 
for the year representing an increase of 8% 
which reversed the trend over recent years. 
This was in part due to increased sales of the 
Micropath
®
 stained bacterial suspensions 
produced by our Co-Tek subsidiary which  
we acquired in September 2009. Other 
growth came from regaining previously lost 
business and new OEM contract wins with 
our Immutrep
®
 Syphilis product range.
Distribution network
Growth has been recorded in most 
geographic regions of the world with the 
exception of North America which reduced  
by 13% to £267k (2010: £307k) due to lost 
tenders in several markets. The Asia/Far East 
region dropped marginally by 1% to £1.35 
million (2010: £1.36 million). These reductions 
were more than offset by good growth in 
Africa/Middle East with sales rising by 24%  
to £1.47 million (2010: £1.19 million) and  
in the UK/European market by sales rising 
48% to £4.45 million (2010: £3.01 million)  
as a result of the new additional allergy tests 
from our German subsidiary and strong 
performance with key users of the Genarrayt
®
 
Food Intolerance products. Sales to South/
Central America rose by just over 10% to 
£361k (2010: £328k).
In last year’s Report I mentioned the good 
growth rates being experienced in the IVD 
sector in Brazil, India and China. In the year, 
we have made efforts to concentrate on and 
expand our business in the BRIC group of 
countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China)  
and we have achieved some success in three 
out of the four target countries. In Brazil we 
increased sales by 50% across the Group, 
achieving total sales of £220k (2010: £147k),  
in Russia we increased sales by over 500%  
to £89k (2010: £13k) and in China we increased 
sales by 49% to £97k (2010: £65k). Only India 
showed marginal growth at 4% with sales 
rising to £499k (2010: £480k). However,  
with the signing of the Food Detective
®
 
distribution agreement with Thermo Fisher 
Scientific in the latter part of the year, we 
expect this to provide a positive impact in  
the year ahead. Several other initiatives are 
being explored to enhance our growth in 
these key countries.
Research and development
Our move into the allergy testing market now 
drives our R&D activity with the development 
of two new allergy instrument platforms,  
both of which are being funded by the 
Allergopharma acquisition fund-raising.
1. IDS-iSYS – in March 2011 we signed  
an exclusive Licence Agreement with 
Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings plc 
(IDS) for the worldwide rights to develop 
and distribute allergy tests on its successful 
and US FDA-cleared IDS-iSYS automated 
instrument. IDS will supply the instruments 
and other consumables necessary to 
enable us to develop and distribute allergy 
tests through our worldwide distribution 
network. Although the development will 
take around one year to complete, the early 
signs are encouraging.
2. Genarrayt
®
 – we are aiming to apply  
the expertise used to develop and produce 
the IgG Food Intolerance microarray 
technology to routine IgE allergy testing. 
This requires development and adaptation 
of the existing technology so that it can be 
used on an automated testing instrument 
which will allow the test to be used in 
higher test volume laboratories. Initial 
feasibility studies have proven successful 
but a substantial effort is still required 
before a product and new instrument  
can be launched.
Work was also completed on an Indian variant 
of the Food Detective
®
 macroarray test which 
completed its registration formalities during 
the year and was formally launched in India  
in February 2011.
Outlook
The outlook for the new financial year is very 
encouraging with the addition of the allergy 
test range and with other organic growth 
opportunities being actively pursued. There are 
still difficulties with some Eurozone countries 
but we fully expect that our anticipated growth 
in the BRIC countries will yield major growth 
going forward and counter any negative effects 
experienced elsewhere in the world.
The recent announcement of 19 May 2011  
regarding Cinven’s intended disposal of 
Phadia to Thermo Fisher Scientific on a 6.7x 
multiple of revenue and 16.6x EBITDA only 
goes to show the high valuations possible in 
the world of allergy testing. With our recent 
acquisition and the new development 
programmes which we have commenced in 
this year, it is our ambition to add significant 
value to the Group. Going forward we expect 
to see this reflected in a share price which 
more accurately reflects the true value of  
the Group.

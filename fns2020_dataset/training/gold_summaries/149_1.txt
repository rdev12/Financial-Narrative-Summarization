 Abcam plc Annual report and accounts 30 June 2007 06
Abcam has enjoyed another impressive 
year with sales increasing by 26.6% to 
£24.5m. This growth came despite the 
weakening dollar, without which sales 
would have grown by 33.8%. (Average 
exchange rate applied to US Sales  
2007 £1: $1.92, 2006 £1: $1.77.)
This success is due to the introduction  
of new products and the performance of 
the existing catalogue. Taken across the 
catalogue, average unit sales continue  
to increase the longer a product is listed – 
a trend we attribute in part to the sheer 
quantity of product information we are 
able to gather and publish over time. 
We should also not underestimate the 
contribution made by our highly skilled 
and committed staff, who make Abcam 
such a dynamic and motivating 
organisation.
We now have almost 34,000 products in 
our online catalogue, up from 23,200 at 
the end of June 2006. As well as listing 
over 25,000 antibodies, we sell more than 
8,000 related products, including proteins, 
peptides and kits. The rapid expansion of 
our product portfolio has been fuelled by  
a growing number of partnerships with 
leading OEM suppliers worldwide and by 
our acquisition of the exclusive rights to 
distribute antibodies developed by some 
leading international manufacturers over 
the last financial year.
Major contributions to revenue have come 
from our US operation, where longer 
opening hours and a push on sales and 
marketing activities have helped us to 
achieve a high rate of growth.
In Europe a similar focus on marketing in 
the second half of the year has propelled a 
58.8% year-on-year increase in the volume 
of business over the corresponding period 
last year. Our virtual European offices are 
promoting the use of French and German 
so that many European customers can now 
contact us directly in their own language.
Despite significant investments for the 
future, profit before taxation increased to 
£5.7m from £4.8m in 2006. While margins 
remain strong, overall profitability has 
been affected by the investment in the 
new Japanese office, the impact of the 
weaker US$, increased research and 
development costs, early-stage costs for 
the exclusive distribution deals and the 
full-year effect of the costs of operating  
as a listed company.
Work on the HTP facility meanwhile was 
finished in June 2007. The antibodies we 
develop ourselves have typically been 
among our best sellers. Whilst only 6% of 
the products sold under the Abcam brand 
are produced in-house, these represent 
16% of our sales by value and generate 
proportionately higher margins. We expect 
that the new facility will allow us to 
dramatically increase our range of 
in-house products over the next few years 
and will lead to increased sales as well  
as improved gross margins.
Abcam is expert at identifying the areas  
of research with the most promise and 
offering products specifically tailored  
to meet associated demands. These 
products fall within our Core Focus Areas

(CFAs). Externally we have presented at 
conferences and run marketing activities 
around these CFAs, while internally we 
have vertically integrated our technical 
service, marketing, business development 
and sales departments to take full 
advantage of them. We have found this  
to be a highly successful strategy for 
capturing market share by segment, and 
plan to develop more CFAs in the future.
We are now becoming a leading player  
in an important and exciting market. We 
have a scaleable business based around 
our state-of-the-art website. By offering 
customers access to detailed and 
up-to-date technical information on our 
products, much of which is derived from 
customers’ own reviews, we have built a 
strong reputation for trust and reliability. 
In addition, with our large and growing 
database of users, we can now tailor our 
marketing activities according to customer 
interest. The investment we have made  
in systems to link the website to product 
ordering and accounting has improved  
our efficiency, and gives us the 
confidence that we will continue to 
manage our growth effectively.

Abcam has almost 34,000 
products in its catalogue and 
the number is still growing.
Our team not only adds new 
products to our catalogue 
every day but also regularly 
modifies the datasheets for 
our existing products. These 
modifications are based 
on our own testing and 
research in addition to the 
feedback of our suppliers 
and customers.
For our customers,  
all of this means:
more antibody targets
more product types
more choice
Around 6% of products sold under the 
Abcam brand are manufactured in-house, 
but these products generate 16% of our 
revenue and typically generate 
proportionately higher margins.

Following the construction of a new 
production facility in Cambridge, UK,  
we plan to devote substantially more 
resources to in-house product 
development. By 2012, we expect  
50% of Abcam-branded products to  
be produced at our sites. This will 
significantly boost our revenue and  
gross margins.
Products sold by Abcam but not 
manufactured on our premises are 
supplied by more than 200 leading  
OEM partners around the world.

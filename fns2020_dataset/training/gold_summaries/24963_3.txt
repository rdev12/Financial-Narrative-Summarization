In last year’s annual report I stated that 
the key operational objective for 2016 
was to return the Group to revenue 
and profit growth. I’m pleased to say 
that we have achieved that with like-
for-like revenue growth of 1% and 
strong growth in headline profit of 
21%. This progress represents a good 
start to Huntsworth’s recovery.
After several changes in the previous 
two years, the Board has enjoyed 
some welcome stability this year, with 
all members now fully embedded into 
the business. The Board did see the 
departure of Terry Graunke, a Non-
Executive Director, in May 2016, and I 
would like to thank Terry for his support 
and help in guiding the Group over the 
critical restructuring period from 2014 to 
2016. CEO, Paul Taaffe, and Neil Jones, 
who joined as CFO on 1 February 2016, 
now form a very experienced and strong 
executive management team.
This team has continued to refine and 
execute the Group’s strategy during 2016, 
with a focus on reducing the cost base 
and removing loss making agencies. 
Huntsworth Health, which is now firmly 
established as the largest division in the 
Group by both revenues and profits, 
has continued to deliver strong growth 
and is the primary focus of the Group’s 
future development. Red continues to 
prove its credentials as a leading PR 
business in the UK with good growth 
in a highly competitive environment 
and has momentum moving into 2017. 
Citigate Dewe Rogerson has again 
performed strongly in some regions and 
less so in others, which are the target 
for improvement in the coming year. 
Grayling’s performance has been the 
major disappointment this year with the 
loss of key contracts in Africa and the 
Middle East and the restructuring in the 
US weighing heavily on its profitability. 
However, the actions taken in late 2015 
plus further restructuring undertaken 
this year are starting to produce results. 
Grayling is now smaller, more nimble 
and more focused, and we remain 
confident that the work we have done 
has positioned this division to return to 
improved profitability.
With the restructuring complete 
and Group profits growing, the 
key operational objective of 2017 
is to accelerate that growth, with 
improved contributions expected 
from all divisions. The hard work that 
has gone into establishing a stronger 
business is now being seen in the 
Group’s results, and we enter 2017 
with confidence for the year ahead.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank the management team and 
staff for their hard work in getting to 
this stage. I look forward to reporting 
on our progress in delivering these 
improvements during 2017.

Business overview
Our overall performance in 2005 was
strong. Key drivers were the growing
trend towards public sector
outsourcing in the UK together with
an increased level of activity in our
Middle Eastern businesses enabled
by timely investment in people,
systems and business infrastructure. 
The highlights of our 2005
performance were:
• A strong set of results driven by
the performance of Facilities,
Project and Equipment Services
• Continued focus on driving
through strategic change in
Industrial Services
• Headline profit

grew by 21.7 per
cent to £47.7 million (2004: £39.2

• 77 per cent of revenue was
generated from long-term client
relationships (2004: 75 per cent) 
• UK future workload remains very
strong, standing at £4.8 billion at
the year end (2004: £4.9 billion)
• Growing contribution from our PFI
portfolio

Operations
A segmental analysis of results is
shown on page 64 of this report.
The Group reports under six
headings: we have five market-
facing divisions and 
a sixth, Group Services, which
principally represents our PFI
bidding activity, a range of
centrally-provided services and the
costs of the Board. Group Services’
overall cost was £14.8 million (2004:
£12.0 million). This net increase was
substantially due to a greater level
of investment in PFI bidding costs as
we pursue growth in this long-term
market, with some incremental
impact from share-based payments.
Facilities Services drives structural,
cultural and performance change
into the processes that support the
occupancy of the built environment.
Increasingly our clients and
prospective clients are seeking to
consolidate their supply chain
solutions into larger, broader-based
contracts as the UK outsourcing
market continues to become more
sophisticated. By combining an
anticipation of these trends with our
integration, management and
delivery capabilities, we believe we
are well positioned to deliver on
growing client expectation and to
maintain our competitive
advantage.
Our 2005 performance was
excellent, resulting in a 39 per cent
increase in operating profit to £17.8
million (2004: £12.8 million). The
majority of this increase came from
volume growth in existing contracts
in the defence, health and
education sectors, together with the
ramp-up of activity on new MoD
Prime contracts mobilised during
the year. Margins on revenue (net of
works bills) further improved to 4.6
per cent (2004: 3.9 per cent).

Proportions of Group revenues
Significant developments during
the year included:
• Financial close on three
significant new contracts:
• South East Regional Prime, 
worth some £400 million
• Newcastle Hospitals PFI project, 
worth over £130 million
• Telford & Wrekin Schools PFI 
project, worth over £40 million 
to the division
• Five major contract mobilisations:
• University College London
Hospital PFI project –
concentration of facilities
management (FM) activities 
in a new 595-bed acute 
health and teaching facility 
in central London
• Dudley Group of Hospitals PFI
project – migration from four
existing facilities in the West
Midlands to a new 757-bed
acute centre
• South Atlantic Prime –
operational and logistics
support for the MoD on
Ascension Island and the
Falklands
• Project Armada – delivery 
of FM services for the Fleet
Accommodation Centre in
Devonport naval base
• Defence Sixth Form College –
migration of FM and bursarial
services to a new purpose-built
residential teaching facility in
Loughborough
Through focusing on complex
outsourcing projects, typically
involving the supply of a broad
range of services with an integrated
management and direct delivery
role, we develop durable and
committed relationships with our
clients. This, together with our
ability to deliver continuous
performance improvement, was a
significant factor in again achieving 
a client retention rate in excess of
90 per cent.
Industrial Services delivers a range
of maintenance-led services, co-
ordinated through a single-point
relationship with our clients. Much
of our work is undertaken in safety-
critical environments, where our
ability to combine continuous
improvement and the breadth of our
service offering set us apart from
our competitors. 
Our strategy is to develop a broad-
based presence in the UK industrial
facilities management market,
generating revenue dominated by
maintenance-led services, the aim
of which is to enhance visibility and
reduce risk by diluting our historic
reliance on cyclical markets and
‘one-off’ projects. Whilst we
continue to make progress in
developing new revenue streams
and customers in line with this
strategy, its implementation has
been more protracted than at first
anticipated and we have faced a
number of issues relating to the
conclusion of legacy contracts. This,
together with the cost of further
investment in management
resources and improved control
systems, has impacted operating
profit, which was £6.3 million
(2004: £10.1 million) on 
revenue of £163.5 million
(2004: £164.5 million). 
During the year we made further
progress towards our strategic goals,
achieving a more evenly balanced
segmentation of revenue within which
the oil and gas sector accounted for
around 15 per cent of activity
(2004: 28 per cent) and increasing
the proportion of revenue from 
long-term relationships to above 
60 per cent (2004: 55 per cent).
Other developments included:
• an initial five-year contract with
BAA for building fabric, mechanical
and electrical maintenance at
Heathrow Airport Terminals 1-4,
worth around £50 million
• an initial three-year agreement
with British Energy to provide a
range of maintenance services at
Hartlepool, Hunterston, Sizewell
and Torness nuclear power
stations, worth in aggregate 
some £30 million
• a number of further contracts in
the high voltage power
transmission market, including a
framework agreement with
National Grid, contributing to
over 20 per cent growth in this
part of our business
• strong growth in our
environmental services business
(formed in 2004), providing
asbestos surveying, testing and
remediation services to clients
such as Thomas Cook, British Gas,

Longer-term relationships Projects
and shorter-term
relationships Our client retention rate was again
over 90 per cent, reflecting the
durability of the relationships we
form. Our ability to deliver
productivity improvements through
outsourcing in a range of complex,
safety-critical operations, together
with the breadth of service range in
both process and the built
environments, provides our clients
with a highly differentiated
offering. We see a trend amongst
our industrial clients to ‘bundle’
their procurement of services
through integrated contracts and,
increasingly, believe we have a
range of opportunities to extend our
role further, through leveraging the
capabilities of other parts of the
Group, and offering a ‘total’ FM
product to the industrial market.
Project Services provides a
comprehensive service covering all
stages of the design and
construction process in the UK and
certain overseas markets. Whilst the
time, cost and quality of on-site
delivery are vitally important in our
risk management, increasingly,
critical differentiators for our
clients are derived from our early
involvement in feasibility, pre-
design, procurement and just-in-
time production/fabrication
processes as well as in after-care
and maintenance activities. 
Our strategy is to work with clients
who look for this increased level of
involvement and partnering with
their supply chain and who
recognise the advantages of
procuring services from a ‘one-stop-
shop’ provider. In the UK this
approach is manifested in our focus

on framework and other partnering
agreements and on other forms of
sustainable work such as PFI. The
proportion of revenue coming from
long-term relationships remained at
around 80 per cent. In our overseas
businesses we operate a parallel
approach of being highly selective 
in the clients for whom we work,
tending to focus on sectors with
high levels of repeat business.
Our overall 2005 performance was
very strong. Operating profit was
£18.3 million, an increase of 21.2 
per cent over last year (2004: £15.1
million). In the UK we completed a
number of large contracts including
Peterborough Prison, Liberty
Stadium in Swansea, the Defence
Sixth Form College near
Loughborough and the HM Revenue
& Customs’ Newcastle Estate
development, which contributed to
strengthened margins of 2.4 per
cent (2004: 2.1 per cent) and
growth in UK operating profit to
£12.2 million (2004: £11.2 million). 
Developments in the UK during the
year included:
• further progress with framework
agreements:
• a five-year, £400 million, 
agreement (in joint venture) 
for United Utilities 
• a seven-year, £175 million, 
agreement for HM Prison

• cumulative orders to date of 
over £275 million in NHS

• growing relationships with BT , 
Barclays, Mapeley and the

• a new agreement with the

• further PFI/PPP successes:
• financial close on the Telford & 
Wrekin Schools PFI project, 
worth some £60 million to 
the division
• preferred bidder on the 
Addiewell Prison PFI project
Our international operations are an
important element in Project
Services’ strategy. They delivered an
outstanding performance, increasing
their aggregate contribution to total
operating profit by 56 per cent to
£6.1 million (2004: £3.9 million).
Our businesses, in Dubai, Qatar and
Oman, focus on being their clients’
contractor of choice, building
reputational strength for performing
on technically and logistically
complex projects. Market conditions
have been buoyant in the Middle
East, fuelled by oil price movements
and further expansion in tourism
and real estate, backed increasingly
by government policies to encourage
development. 
Notable successes in the year
included:
• completion of the Mall of the
Emirates, Dubai, reported to be
the third largest shopping centre 
in the world, comprising over
240,000 square metres of retail
space for 440 tenants
• new contracts for the Wafi Raffles

Equipment Services provides
temporary structural equipment
solutions for complex infrastructure
projects. The business operates in
many major construction economies
and we differentiate ourselves on
the basis of our design and
engineering expertise, client
relationship management and the
breadth of our integrated product
range. 
Our strategy is to operate across a
wide range of geographies and
market sectors to mitigate the
effects of inherent country-specific
cyclicality, whilst focusing on
boosting efficiency through
enhancing the composition,
procurement and deployment of our
centrally-coordinated fleet. Our
design services are delivered from
three centres of excellence in the
UK, UAE and Australia. We rank
fourth by revenue in terms of global
competitors and aim to be the
leading player in our chosen
geographies and niche markets.
Our 2005 performance was excellent
and benefited from the significant
fleet investment made in 2004,
which enabled growth in most
markets, particularly in the Middle
East. Operating profit grew by some
40 per cent to £20.5 million (2004:
£14.6 million) on revenue of £107.2
million (2004: £87.7 million), an
increase of 22 per cent. 
The business generates revenue
through both hire contracts and
equipment sales (of both new and
used components). Hire income,
which typically accounts for about
half of our revenue, increased by 18
per cent. Revenue from equipment
sales grew by 31 per cent, fuelled in
particular by a number of unusually
large orders in the Middle East.
Overall the significant volume
growth led to an improvement in
operating margin to 19.1 per cent
(2004: 16.6 per cent).
Regionally:
Middle East – Our performance was
outstanding. Through early
investment and excellent market
conditions, our operations in the
region have more than trebled in
size in the last few years. Having
already invested significantly in
design capabilities in the region, we
see further opportunity and are now
focusing on the expansion of our
materials storage and handling
infrastructure, management
development and management
information systems. 
Australasia – Having experienced
softer market conditions in later
2004 and early 2005, our Australian
business showed improving
performance throughout the second-
half, with recovery being led by
infrastructure investment in
Queensland and through the

introduction of new products, such
as Alshor Plus, to the fleet. Market
conditions in New Zealand were less
favourable, with increasing
competition; however, our operation
is lean on cost and the introduction
of a number of new products should
enable a niche-based approach
going forward.
Europe – The UK infrastructure
market was quiet in 2005 with a
number of high-profile projects
suffering delayed starts, particularly
in the roads sector. We took the
opportunity to improve cost-
efficiencies through a branch
rationalisation programme and
through a reorganisation of our sales
force into a sector-based structure.
Albeit there are some encouraging
signs in terms of project start-ups in
roads, any material upturn in the UK
market is expected only in the
medium term. Our Spanish operation
had a strong year, benefiting from a
significant investment in a new
depot and the associated fleet
expansion this enabled.
Far East – We had a strong year in
Hong Kong but were frustrated in
Korea, where progress was hindered
by the prolonged delay of a major
project. Whilst this specific issue
has now been resolved, our priority
in Korea is to make good progress
with market entry into new sectors,
such as high-rise residential
building. We have significantly
retrenched our position in Taiwan,
with any future business being
operated on an export basis from
other locations. 
PFI Investments is a growing
element of our overall business mix.
Whilst our core strategic interest in
PFI/PPP projects is as a significant
channel to market for our Facilities
Services and Project Services
businesses, the investment
opportunities associated with the
project financial structures are
attractive to the Group and we 
are an active primary investor in
projects where we have a direct
involvement in the downstream
facilities management and/or
construction services. 
We manage our investment
activities through a centrally-run
team, which is responsible for co-
ordinating Group-wide business
development activities, particularly
in the PPP market. This involves
leading the bidding process for PFI
opportunities, managing our
investment portfolio and, in many
cases, delivering management
services to Special Purpose
Companies.
2005 performance from our PFI
investments was good. Operating
profit was £0.6 million (2004: £0.6
million). However, the pre-tax
contribution (including net interest
receivable on subordinated debt
investments) grew by 23 per cent to
£3.2 million (2004: £2.6 million),
reflecting an increase both in the
number of investments and their
overall maturity: 18 out of our 23
projects have reached the
operational stage in their life cycle
(2004: 13 out of 21 projects). There
were no disposals during the year. 
We achieved financial close on two
projects, those being for Telford &
Wrekin Borough Council and for the
Newcastle Hospitals NHS Trust, with
a combined equity commitment of
£8.7 million. In both cases
Interserve will deliver facilities
management services over the life
of the concession, and at Telford &
Wrekin we are well advanced in the
design and build stage of the
project. This takes the total
committed value of our PFI
investment portfolio to £49.5
million (2004: £42.4 million).
We were appointed preferred bidder
on two further projects, for Holy
Cross School in Northern Ireland,
where we will deliver facilities
management services, and for the
Scottish Prison Service at Addiewell
Prison, where we will deliver the
design and build stage of the
project. The combined equity
requirement of these projects will
be around £4.5 million.
Health and safety remains a key
priority for all our operations,
wherein our objective is to achieve
an accident-free environment. To
this end we continue to invest in
ensuring that we provide a safe and
healthy environment for our
employees, the contractors working
with us and for the clients to whom
we deliver our services. We operate
under established safety
management arrangements that are
actively monitored through audit by
safety professionals and inspection
by senior management, including

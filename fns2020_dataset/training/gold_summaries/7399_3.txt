concentration on our core business areas. We have a strong  
track record based on continued product development and the 
redevelopment of the Group through targeted acquisitions and 
disposal of non-core businesses. In 2009 we will continue the 
strategy of selectively investing resources to further improve both 
our market position and geographic spread, and in product 
innovation to deliver value added solutions to our customers.
The Group is led by an experienced and entrepreneurial 
management team that has extensive knowledge of our chosen 
markets. The team’s entrepreneurial focus and enthusiasm has 
been, and will continue to be, an important element of our strategy 
as it drives the individual businesses to innovate and respond quickly 
to opportunities they identify.
Finance
Cash generated from operations was strong at £54.2m  
(2007: £26.9m) reflecting in part the Group’s increased focus  
on day to day cash management. The Group invested £22.5m 
(2007: £19.6m) in capital expenditure in furtherance of its organic 
growth objectives and we are confident that this investment will 
contribute to growth in the coming years. 
Group net debt at 31 December 2008 was £146.2m (2007: £117.8m). 
The Group’s net debt is principally denominated in Euros and US 
Dollars which act as a hedge against the net asset investments in 
overseas businesses. The material depreciation of Sterling towards 
the end of 2008 significantly increased the Sterling reported amounts 
of the foreign currency net debt. Net debt increased year on year by 
£32.6m due to exchange rate movements.
At year end exchange rates, the Group now has a total of over 
£218m of facilities at its disposal, with the principal facility being a 
£150m multi currency facility signed in June 2007 and which runs to 
June 2012. These facilities afford the Group significant headroom 
against its expected requirements.
Acquisitions and disposals 
During the year we acquired the remaining 31.8% of Zinkinvent 
GmbH and at the same time divested the galvanizing operations in 
Benelux and Germany, thereby achieving our long term goal of 
100% ownership of the galvanizing and fabrication businesses in 
France (France Galva SA) and the USA (Voigt & Schweitzer, Inc.). We 
also acquired Creative Pultrusions, Inc., a company based in 
Pennsylvania, USA, manufacturing glass reinforced plastic products 
for the infrastructure and construction markets. Both of these 
acquisitions contributed to our 2008 earnings in line with 
expectations, and significantly strengthen our market positions 
going forward.
Introduction
This time last year I said that I looked forward to reporting another 
year of progress in 2008. I am therefore delighted to report that the 
Group has again produced a set of exceptional results for the year 
ended 31 December 2008, delivering another year of increased 
earnings and growth. 
During 2008 we continued to develop the Group in line with our 
strategy of increasing our concentration on our core business areas, 
of driving growth through product innovation in both existing and 
new geographic markets, and through selective acquisitions.  
A major strength of the Group is the ability to identify growth 
potential in developed and developing markets and this has played 
a significant part in strengthening our market positions, particularly 
in the resilient infrastructure sector. 
The Group is now of a different scale and composition to what  
it was five years ago with 35% of revenues and 50% of profits 
coming from our international operations.
Results from continuing businesses
Group revenue increased by 27.4% to £419.8m (2007: £329.6m). 
Profit before taxation in the period increased by 14.0% to £35.1m 
(2007: £30.8m) and underlying profit before taxation
(†)
 increased  
by 25.5% to £38.9m (2007: £31.0m). Basic earnings per share 
increased by 1.7% to 30.0p (2007: 29.5p) whereas underlying 
earnings per share
(†)
, a more consistent and meaningful measure of 
performance, was 23.4% ahead of last year at 32.2p (2007: 26.1p). 
The underlying earnings per share
(†)
 has now grown by a compound 
average growth rate of 29% over the past five years.
Dividends
These results, together with the Board’s confidence in the Group’s 
prospects, enable the Directors to recommend to shareholders  
a final dividend of 5.7p (2007: 5.1p), making a total dividend for the 
year of 10.0p (2007: 8.7p), an increase of 14.9%. Our progressive 
dividend policy has increased dividend payments by an average of 
22% in each of the last three years. The dividend for the year is 
covered 3.2 times by underlying earnings per share
(†)
. The final 
dividend, if approved, will be paid on 10 July 2009 to those 
shareholders on the register at close of business on 5 June 2009.
Group strategy 
Our strategic objective is to deliver a consistent growth in  
earnings, dividend and shareholder value, through an increasing

Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Our key strengths During 2008 we continued the strategic review of our non-core 
businesses and successfully disposed of Express Reinforcements 
Limited and D&J (Steels) Limited.
Board of Directors
In the announcement of the Company’s interim results made  
on 18 August 2008 I stated that I would be retiring at the end  
of 2009 and in accordance with this intention I have agreed with 
the Board that, with effect from the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 12 May 2009, I will become 
Non-executive Chairman.
 
Our succession planning has continued throughout the year  
and we are in the process of recruiting a suitable replacement  
for Dick Richardson, following his decision to retire from the 
Board at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 12 May 2009. The Board will report to shareholders as 
soon as a decision is made. Dick has contributed significantly to 
the development and operation of the Board over the last twelve 
years and along with my Board colleagues I thank him for all that 
he has done for the Company.
Outlook
The Board are adopting a cautious outlook for the current  
year in view of the uncertainty over the scale and impact  
of the global economic downturn and on the timing of the 
infrastructure spending for the various government fiscal stimulus 
packages. Overall we are strongly positioned in broadly resilient 
markets, have strong positions in those markets and improved 
geographical balance, all of which will help us to deal with the 
current economic conditions.

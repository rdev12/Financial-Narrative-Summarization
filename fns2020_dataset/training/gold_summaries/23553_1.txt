 CASE STUDY: LAND AND PROPERTY 
SERVICES 
Growing efficiencies
Equiniti’s solutions addressed the need 
to update the rating software which was 
outdated, heavily customised and unable to 
meet requirements for regulatory reform. 
Our solution included assessment and 
collection software, a sophisticated accounts 
p ac k ag e, 	 wor k flow , 	 business 	 int el l i g enc e 	
software, security administration, disaster 
recovery and on-going technical and 
application support. As part of the system, 
Equiniti also provided a solution to help LPS 
deal with the task of tracing unpaid debtors.
Equiniti’s managed service includes the 
provision of 400,000 documents per 
annum with rate bills, reminders and 
enforcements printed through a  
secure facility.
Generating new revenues
As part of the project, LPS needed to 
trace a large number of records on its 
database for which it had incomplete or 
missing personal information. Equiniti 
v e r i fi e d	a n d	t r a c e d	8 4 . 5 %	o f	a c c o u n t s	
with outstanding debt, helping LPS to 
generate new rate demands to 27,478 
properties equating to £13.5 million in 
additional cash for them.
The project enabled LPS to meet its debt 
reduction targets.
A satisfied customer with 
a market leading service
This project brought together the 
capabilities from across the Group  
– data management, software and 
managed services to deliver a fantastic 
s o l u t i o n	t o	a	c l i e n t ,	w h i c h	i s	fi t	f o r	t h e	
future and supports revenue generation 
and cost savings.
Addressing legacy issues
As part of the contract, Equiniti took 
over the operation and administration 
o f	l e g a c y	D e fi n e d	C o n t r i b u t i o n	( D C )	
closed book pension schemes, upgrading 
the outmoded administration system to 
achieve operational resilience. This was in 
addition to providing continuous servicing 
a n d	s e t t l e m e n t	o f	b e n e fi t s	f o r	a r o u n d	
35,000 account holders.
The transition was achieved by ‘lifting 
and shifting’ the supporting systems from 
the legacy platform to Equiniti’s modern 
technology and by introducing a new, 
highly motivated team of administrators. 
Equiniti administers the portfolio of closed 
book pension schemes using experienced 
a nd 	 quali fi ed 	 s t a f f. 	 T his 	 is 	 su ppor ted 	 b y 	 t he 	
Compendia platform, which provides the 
complete range of pensions administration, 
reporting and communication services to 
meet the needs of trustees, employers  
and members.
Equiniti has introduced a technically 
resilient system capable of supporting 
change in the future. The switch to a 
new, modern fund series has helped 
reduce operating costs and enhances 
member choice and engagement. 
This may lead to future business for 
Prudential as scheme members embark 
on their retirement journey. By providing 
great service during the accumulation 
period, Prudential will be viewed in a 
positive light by those members seeking 
to purchase an annuity.
Land and Property Services (LPS) collects rates on 785,000 
properties in Northern Ireland and collects cash totalling 
around £1 billion per annum. It also administers many benefits 
and reliefs. Equiniti provides rate collection and managed 
services to LPS.
Equiniti announced a 10 year renewal to its contract  
with Prudential for the administration of pension schemes. 
Prudential has a longstanding relationship with the Group  
and is a trusted partner. This partnership cultivates deeper 
commercial relationships and delivers greater value to  
both Prudential and Equiniti.
CASE STUDY:  THE PRUDENTIAL 
Excellence in delivery 
for our customers has 
to be as important to 
our partners as it is to 
us. Everything we do 
well builds on the trust 
our customers place 
in us so our extension 
of this partnership 
is a recognition of 
Equiniti’s technical 
and administrative 
expertise.

at Prudential
Equiniti has provided 
LPS with a solution 
that has proved to be 
flexible during a time 
of radical change 
for the organisation. 
The fully integrated 
system replaces several 
disparate systems 
allowing LPS to handle 
the additional business 
complexity resulting 
from a substantial 
programme of rating 
reforms and significant 
organisational change. 
The solution from 
Equiniti has ensured 
that we have continued 
to maintain an 
operational service in 
very challenging times.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Results
In the year, total revenue was £1,315.3m, up 3.0%
1
 and another record 
figure for the company. The operating profit before exceptional items 
was down 1.7% to £256.2m and profit before tax and exceptional items 
(PBTE) was down 0.8%, each being affected by lower LFL sales growth 
and the impact of the disposal of 275 pubs to Hawthorn Leisure. 
Our adjusted earnings per share were up 1.3% to 61.0p. After making 
allowance for the disposal of the pubs, the retained business grew 
PBTE by 6.9% and adjusted earnings per share by 9.2%. 
Dividend
Following a year of strong underlying growth for the company, the 
board has recommended a final dividend of 21.8p per share, up 4.8% 
on last year. This takes the total dividend for the year to 29.75p per share, 
up 4.8%, continuing our long track record of dividend growth. 
The final dividend is expected to be paid on 14 September 2015 to those 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 14 August 2015.
Acquisitions
On 23 June, after the year end, we completed the acquisition of 
Spirit Pub Company plc, the largest acquisition in the company’s 
history. This added 791 retail sites and 416 tenanted and leased sites 
to our pub estate. During the year, we added 32 sites to our retail estate 
at a total cost of £75.9m, leaving us with 1,060 sites at the year end.
Disposals
During the year, we sold 314 non-core sites for a total of £94.1m, 
including the sale to Hawthorn Leisure. The 39 disposals outside 
of the Hawthorn Leisure transaction realised a sale value of £18.5m. 
Board
Sadly, Matthew Fearn, our chief financial officer, had to leave us in 
September 2014 because of his ill health. In his place, we appointed 
Kirk Davis, who was formerly the finance director at JD Wetherspoon plc. 
We welcomed him onto our board as chief financial officer on 
3 November 2014. 
In July 2014, Rob Rowley joined our board as a non-executive 
director. He was formerly at Reuters Group plc, where he held 
various roles including that of finance director, and will be taking 
the chairmanship of the audit committee from Ian Durant next year.
People
I would like to thank everyone who has worked for Greene King 
over the course of the year, whether it be those who work in our 
managed pub business, our tenanted and leased pub business or our 
beer business. Wherever you are in the company, or in the country, 
your efforts and your achievements are, as always, highly valued 
and appreciated. 
On the most recent note of all, I would like to welcome all of the Spirit 
employees. We look forward to working with you, sharing ideas and 
making the most of our joint opportunity to forge a successful 
future together.

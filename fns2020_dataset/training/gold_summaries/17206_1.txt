improvement which underpins our service delivery.
Graeme McFaull, Chief Executive
Q.
How do you see
Wincanton today?
A.
Wincanton is an excellent
business with a successful
past and an exciting future. It has
increased tremendously in scale,
geographic presence and service
complexity in recent years, without
losing sight of its core people values
and customer-focused culture.
We now have the scale and
geographic presence to serve our
customers across Europe but we
never put scale before customer
service. There are bigger, but not
better, companies in our sector.
Q.
What are Wincanton’s
strengths?
A.
Our people and our customers
are our greatest strengths.
Our people are the best in the industry.
Their commitment to operational
excellence drives the search for
continuous improvement which
underpins our service delivery. Their
creativity and talent for innovation
ensure the constant renewal and
development of our service offering.
Our people recognise that we are
only as good as today’s performance
and tomorrow’s new idea, and key to
everything is the customer.
These customers include Europe’ s
largest retailers and manufacturers.
We are growing our share of business
with these customers, working both
within and across country borders.
We work very hard to build and develop
these relationships. They have
become, in many cases, long-standing
partnerships which have been critical
to our past successes and they are
also the key to our future growth.
Q.
Will Wincanton’s 
strategy change?
A.
Our vision remains clear 
and unchanged. We will be
recognised as the premium operator,
the European leader in our sector.
Since becoming Chief Executive, 
I have visited all the countries in
which we operate, spent time with all
our management teams and met our
largest customers. I am now even
more firmly convinced that this goal 
is achievable. Stretching targets are
being set, across the business, as we
focus on the implementation of the
strategy that will deliver our vision.
We have achieved a lot in recent
years, and are already well-established
throughout much of Europe, but we
can and must make more rapid
progress. The pace of change is
accelerating in our industry and 
we must accelerate with it.
Q.
What changes will 
you make?
A.
T o succeed, we must combine
strength in national markets
with a regional and Pan-European
service offering. Our customers must
have confidence that Wincanton can
deliver industry-leading solutions 
and operational quality, consistently,
both nationally and across Europe.
The changes I have made since
becoming Chief Executive have been
made with this goal in mind.
In recent months I have re-organised
our internal management structures,
making them flatter, more flexible
and more responsive. A new
Operating Board has been created,
joining together our country and Wincanton plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 7
sector managing Directors, ensuring
that we work as one business across
Europe. Our management teams 
in a number of national markets 
have been strengthened through
external recruitment.
Key value-driving functions, such 
as business development, human
resources and IT have been re-
oriented to give Group-wide focus 
in addition to support in national
markets. Customer and key account
planning processes are being
reinforced across the business and 
a series of new marketing initiatives
have been launched to continue to
raise awareness throughout Europe
of the Wincanton brand, our
capabilities and core values.
Research tells us that our customers
look to Wincanton for operational
excellence, an in-depth understanding
of their business, innovation and value.
These are the ‘Four Pillars’ of our
service offering. We must be ready to
continue to be flexible and anticipate
the changes that ensure that we will
meet, and exceed, the expectations 
of our customers in all these areas.
Q.
Do you see Wincanton
entering new geographic
markets?
A.
Our clear priority is to continue
to strengthen and expand our
current European presence. There is
great potential to build further on this
existing presence, which already
gives a highly-competitive platform in
what remains a fragmented market.
We see significant opportunity in
many of the existing EU member
states and are also looking actively,
often with existing customers, at
new opportunities in the countries
expected to join the EU in due course.
We monitor possible opportunities
beyond the EU but expect, at this
stage of Wincanton’s development,
to focus our efforts and resources 
on achieving our goal of European
leadership.
Q.
Is Wincanton considering
new sectors or services?
A.
Wincanton’s business
incorporates a large number 
of customer solutions, providing a
wide range of services across many
sectors of the economy. This
diversity is an important strength,
giving us balance and mix and the
opportunity to manage our
operations on a portfolio basis.
The portfolio today is very different
from the Wincanton of 10 years ago. 
I fully expect Wincanton’s portfolio in
10 years time to have evolved
significantly compared to the
Wincanton of today.
This means that we are constantly
reviewing new sectors, new
services, new technologies to
refresh and develop the portfolio,
based on our core business
competences of outsourcing and
supply chain management services.
Q.
Do you expect Wincanton 
to make further acquisitions?
A.
We have built a good track
record for making acquisitions
at sensible prices and integrating
them well. These acquisitions have
complemented our organic growth
and allowed us to accelerate our
strategic development.
There are many opportunities for
further consolidation in our market. 
At any one time we are likely to be
reviewing half a dozen potential
targets but we are very selective. We
do our homework on these potential
targets in detail and we do it well.
Acquisitions are not a strategic
imperative for Wincanton. There are
very attractive opportunities for good
organic growth in our existing
business. We will therefore only
make further acquisitions when we
have a high degree of confidence that
significant value can be added to
Wincanton relative to the entry price
for our investment.
Q.
Any final comments?
A.
Our success to date has been
based on adding value for
shareholders by adding value for
customers. We are very conscious of
our responsibilities to our stakeholders.
We take great pride in Wincanton’s
progress to date. I am personally
proud and excited to be leading
Wincanton into the next stage 
of its development.

Change to Shareholder Base
During the ﬁ nal quarter of the year 
our largest shareholder, MBE Mineral 
Technologies Pte Limited (“MBE”), sold 
its entire shareholding in the Company. 
This shareholding, which represented 
approximately 42% of the Company’s 
share capital, was placed with a range 
of institutional and other investors. 
Results Overview
The Group continued to make strong progress 
in the year with revenue rising to £43.2 million 
(15 months to 31 March 2013: £40.5 million). 
This generated an underlying trading* operating 
proﬁ t of £4.7 million (2013: £3.3 million), which 
represented a return on revenue of 10.8% 
(2013: 8.1%). Underlying trading* earnings 
per share were 6.51 pence (2013: 3.68 pence). 
After non-trading ﬁ nance and tax charges the 
statutory proﬁ t after tax was signiﬁ cantly higher 
at £2.3 million (2013: £0.1 million).

Inaugural Dividend
Previously we have stated that we would start 
to pay dividends once we had achieved a much 
stronger ﬁ nancial footing. Having reduced our 
net debt to EBITDA to below our target of 2:1 
and in recognition of the progress made, we 
paid our inaugural interim dividend of 0.5 pence 
per ordinary share in February 2014. The Board 
will adopt a progressive dividend policy and, 
subject to shareholder approval, will pay a ﬁ nal 
dividend of 0.75 pence per share on 29 August 
2014 to shareholders on the register on 15 
August 2014 (ex-dividend date: 13 August 2014).

New Banking Arrangements
The Group arranged new UK banking 
and borrowing facilities in March 2014 of 
£14.2 million, which replaced facilities of 
£12.9 million that had been supported by MBE. 
These new UK facilities place the Group in a 
much stronger position and we view the de-
coupling of the loan from MBE as an important 
stepping stone in the Group’s development.
 
 Further details of the new facilities are setout 
in the Financial Review on page 12.

Outlook
The year to 31 March 2014 has seen 
some signiﬁ cant positive developments for 
Hayward Tyler. The continuing improvement 
in performance, built on greater operational 
and ﬁ nancial robustness, is allowing the Group 
to focus on other key areas such as technical 
development, people development and 
marketing and sales.  
With Hayward Tyler’s bicentenary arising in 
2015, the Board continues to look to the future 
with increasing conﬁ dence.

for the support provided by Deepak, 
Subir and Prabir together with MBE both 
operationally and ﬁ nancially during the 
20 months or so that they were directly 
involved with the Company. We are 
delighted to welcome Maurice, a long 
time shareholder in the Company, on to 
the Board given his extensive experience 
in manufacturing and knowledge of the 
offshore oil and gas markets.

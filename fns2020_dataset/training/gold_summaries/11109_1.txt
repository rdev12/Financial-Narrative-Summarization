CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
OVERVIEW
NEXT has had another good year, achieving 5.4% growth in sales and 11.8% growth in underlying profit before tax.  
Strong cash generation enabled us to buy back 3.8% of shares outstanding without increasing financial leverage 
which, along with a lower tax rate, resulted in earnings per share (EPS) growing much faster than profits.
In the year to January 2014, underlying post-tax EPS grew by 23%.  Our full year dividend is being increased in 
line with EPS, to 129p in total.  We have announced two special dividends, each of 50p per share.  The first was  
paid on 3 February and the second is payable on 1 May.

STRAIGHTFORWARD OBJECTIVES
NEXT’s Operating Objectives
The Company has five operational objectives, as set out in the table below.  These aims remain broadly  
unchanged from those given in this report last year.  The only significant change is the addition of  
improving customer service as a goal for the year ahead.
Develop the NEXT 
Brand
Develop, improve and expand our product ranges, with particular emphasis on 
improving design across all our ranges.
Invest in online 
growth
Invest in growth from our online business, through improving UK delivery services, 
developing new overseas markets and expanding our online product offer.   
Invest in profitable 
new space
Open profitable new retail space, maintaining the Company’s strict payback and 
profitability hurdles of 15% net store profit (before central overheads) and payback on 
net capital invested in 24 months.   
Improve service Improve the quality of our service to customers provided by staff, both in stores and in 
our call centres.
Control costs Control costs through constantly developing more efficient ways of operating.  This must 
be done without detracting from the quality of our products and services.

NEXT’S Financial Objective
For the last ten years NEXT has had one clear financial objective: to deliver long term, sustainable growth in 
earnings per share (EPS).  This objective is grounded in the belief that, over time, share price growth will follow 
growth in EPS.  The graph below shows how our share price has indeed tracked EPS over the last 15 years,  
albeit that some patience has been required.

The graph also demonstrates the historically high rating the shares currently enjoy.  In our Annual Report last 
year we set out the criteria by which we would decide the maximum price we would pay to buy back shares.  
We introduced the concept of Equivalent Rate of Return (ERR).  ERR is the return required from an alternative  
investment, if that investment were to produce the same level of earnings enhancement as the proposed buyback.
We set the minimum ERR at 8%, which we consider a reasonable target for a return on equity investments.  In 
November last year, as our shares continued to rise, the ERR on share buybacks fell below the 8% threshold.  
As a result, we introduced rolling special dividends in place of buybacks.  We intend to continue distributing  
surplus cash through special dividends, paid on a quarterly basis, until such time as the ERR rises above 8%.  
Whilst the underlying financial objective of the Group remains unchanged in principle, the introduction of special 
dividends mean that our financial goal is now better expressed as the delivery of long term sustainable growth 
in Total Shareholder Returns; where Total Shareholder Returns are defined as growth in EPS added to the total 
annual dividend yield.

STRATEGIC REPORT
PRODUCT AND THE NEXT BRAND
Unlike many high street retailers, NEXT designs and directly sources the vast majority of its products.  We can  
do more to leverage our design resources and sourcing base to produce better quality fabrics, print designs, 
trim detailing and make up.  In particular we will continue to push our design teams to adopt new trends in  
depth and with conviction.  This approach of taking greater fashion risks may sound counter-intuitive but, in today’s 
fast moving fashion environment, to fall back on “safe” historical ranges would merely guarantee failure.  On  
the whole, our experience is that where we have been braver in buying into new trends, we have been successful.
We have also adjusted our buying cycle to reflect the continuing trend for consumers to buy closer to the point 
at which they need the clothing.  Our aim is to increase the availability of cold weather clothing in January, 
February and March and warm weather clothing in August and September.  Going forward we will move  
away from a two season buying cycle to a four season cycle and our customers will see a bigger change from 
spring into summer (in April) and autumn into winter (in October).
Over the last 6 years we have made significant progress in developing our Home business.  Trading space has  
more than doubled to 1.7 million square feet and Home sales now account for 18% of our total turnover.  Over  
the next few years we intend to grow Home further by adding retail space and improving our online functionality.
RETAIL
RETAIL SALES
Total Retail sales were 1.7% ahead of last year, of which new space contributed 3.1%.
Full price sales grew by 2.9%.  Markdown sales were 11% down as a result of stock for Sale being 15% lower than 
last year.  This unusually low level of markdown came as a result of a last minute sales surge immediately before the 
summer and winter Sales.  In the year ahead we expect markdown levels to return to more normal levels.
RETAIL SPACE EXPANSION
Space added in the year
Trading space increased by 280,000 square feet over the year, taking us to 7 million, as shown below.

Portfolio Shape and Profitability
Whilst our space increased by 4%, the number of stores barely changed.  Much of our new space has come 
from extending and re-locating in existing trading locations.  Stores in new locations have been offset by the 
closure of smaller less profitable shops.  As a result of this active management of our less profitable stores,  
our Mainline portfolio remains highly profitable despite continuing negative like for like sales in many locations.  
More than 90% of our sales come from stores which deliver more than 15% profit contribution on sales.

Rental inflation remains very low, with most stores experiencing little or no increase at rent review.  In the vast 
majority of cases, when stores reach the end of their lease, we have been able to reduce rents.
Returns on Capital and Profitability
Profitability of stores opened in the last 12 months is forecast to average 22% and payback on the net capital 
invested is expected to be 19 months.  Both figures are within Company investment hurdles of 15% store profitability 
and 24 months capital payback.

Retail Space – Pipeline 
We continue to look for opportunities to profitably increase UK selling space.  For the coming year we expect  
to add 360,000 square feet (net of closures).  We expect 113,000 of this to come from three large Home  
format out-of-town stores.  For two of these shops (Maidstone, Kent and Hedge End, near Southampton) they  
are being built from the ground up to our own design, enabling us to ensure that the architecture of the building 
reflects the aspirations of our Brand.
RETAIL SERVICE
If our customers were to be asked to rate NEXT’s service we believe many would say it was generally good 
but not consistently exceptional.  We think that we have an opportunity to improve both the consistency and  
quality of our retail customer service.  During the last six months we have changed our recruitment processes,  
appraisal systems, training materials, man-hour planning systems and monthly bonus scheme with a view 
to focussing our store teams on providing better service.  Initial results have been encouraging but there is a  
way to go.  
In addition, we aim to improve the levels of staff experience in the business by increasing the average weekly 
contract worked by our staff.  This change will take time and will be achieved through natural staff turnover.  So 
that as and when staff leave the business some of their hours will be re-allocated to existing team members  
who want the extra work.

DIRECTORY DEVELOPMENT – UK
Service Improvements
In October of this year we introduced free, next-day delivery to stores for customers who ordered before 10pm.   
This service is now available in 341 stores, which account for 74% of our retail turnover.  As a result the  
percentage of orders made from home and delivered to store has risen from 30% to around 45%.  In the  
year ahead we intend to extend this service to stores accounting for 99% of our retail turnover.
Going forward we will increase focus on improving the reliability of our Directory services.  We fail to deliver  
around 2% of our parcels at the promised time, but know that there is an opportunity to improve this reliability.  
However, whatever improvements we make, there will always be a small number of errors.  How our staff handle 
these rare events is central to developing our reputation.  A Company’s ability to rectify mistakes is, for many  
customers, the litmus test of great service.  We can do much to respond better to these occasions through  
improved recruitment, staff training and systems.  
Directory Product Offer 
Our retail stores receive injections of new lines roughly every six weeks, with the year being divided into nine 
Retail phases.  Directory has been reliant on the publication of four big catalogues and has missed out on some  
of the newest Retail stock.  In future we will be adding stock to our website to coincide with our Retail  
phases, this stock will be supported by a number of “New-In” brochures.
For some years now NEXT has sold non-competing non-NEXT brands through the NEXT Directory.  This year  
we are further expanding the branded offer in the Directory itself and, more importantly, trialling a standalone 
publication devoted exclusively to third party brands.  This publication, which is currently called LABEL,  
has been distributed to 400,000 customers.
DIRECTORY DEVELOPMENT – INTERNATIONAL
We continue to make good progress developing our internet business overseas.  International online sales grew by 
86% and contributed 3.9% to Directory growth.  However, with a turnover of just over £100m, it is still relatively small 
and it would be a mistake to over-emphasise its importance.  All overseas sales are currently serviced from our UK 
warehouses through third party distribution networks.
Sales Initiatives
Growth has been driven through a combination of improved pricing, site translations, the acceptance of new 
domestic currencies and the development of new territories.  Of these factors, permanent price reductions  
have been by far the most important.  The table below sets out the international growth drivers for last  
year and those planned for the year ahead.  In addition to the initiatives listed in the table, we will be investigating 
ways to improve our delivery service in key territories.

Online Overseas Profitability and the Year Ahead
Net margins on our overseas business fell from 19% to 18%, reflecting keener prices and some marketing initiatives.  
We expect net margins in the year ahead to remain at 18%.  
Going forward we expect growth rates to ease a little, as the price adjustments made in 2013 begin to 
annualise.  We are currently forecasting for International online sales to grow by 50% to £150m.  The table

COST INFLATION AND COST CONTROL
This year we have more than offset cost increases with cost savings.  The tables below outline the main  
contributors to cost increases and cost savings over the last year.  Cost control remains at the heart of the  
business and we remain determined that cost savings must come through innovation and efficiency rather than 
any compromise to our product quality or services.

Total Cost Savings 72
In the year ahead we expect cost increases of around £44m.  Anticipated wage increases account for £27m  
of this rise, the majority of which comes from our annual cost of living award.  We expect these cost  
increases to be more than offset by cost savings.
Head Office, Warehouse and Systems Projects 2014/15
The rapid growth of our Online and Home businesses means that we have an unusual number of big systems 
and warehousing projects starting in the current year.   These projects will give some operational benefits but are  
mainly required to facilitate continued growth or replace obsolete systems.  Most systems development costs  
are revenue costs and written off in the year they are incurred.  Hardware and other infrastructure are depreciated 
over the life of the asset.

Our franchise business, with partners operating 173 stores in 35 countries, continued to grow both sales and 
profits.  The number of directly owned stores has been reduced to 16 and they broke even for the first time.  
Our 11 stores in Central Europe made a small profit, offset by a small loss in China.  We do not aim to expand

Full year sales of £63m and operating profit of £5m, before amortisation and profit share of £2m, was the best 
performance in our five years of ownership.  Lipsy’s retail sales were £20m, taken from 49 stores trading 57,000 
square feet, and sales to wholesale customers were £22m.  Online sales, through Lipsy’s own site and the NEXT 
Directory were £21m.  We expect further sales and profit growth from Lipsy in the years ahead.

UNREALISED FOREIGN EXCHANGE IAS 39
The £6m loss for the year compares with a £3m gain in the prior year.  At this time it is not possible to predict the 
year ahead, so group profit guidance assumes no IAS 39 gain or loss.
INTEREST AND TAXATION
The interest charge was £28m, £1m less than last year.  For the coming year we expect net debt to  
again range between £500m and £750m.  This will result in an interest charge of £30m due to the higher  
level of bond debt and low interest rates available on cash deposits.
Our tax rate reduced as expected to 20.4%, due to the reduction in headline UK corporation tax rates and 
agreement of prior year items with HMRC.  We expect our effective rate will be no higher than 21% in each  
of the next two years.
BALANCE SHEET AND ORDINARY DIVIDENDS
The balance sheet remains strong, with year end net debt of £517m and forecast peak borrowing requirements 
being very securely financed by our bonds and committed bank facilities of £1,088m.  During the last six  
months we repaid the 2013 bond, issued a new 12 year bond and extended our bank facility, all as set out below.

FINAL DIVIDEND
We have proposed raising our final dividend to 93p, taking the total dividend for the year to 129p.  The increase  
of 23% is in line with growth in underlying EPS.  Dividend cover remains at 2.8 times.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CASH GENERATION, SHARE BUYBACKS AND SPECIAL DIVIDENDS
CASH GENERATION
Over the last year we generated £326m of surplus cash after capex, interest, dividends and tax, of which £26m 
was used to maintain our ESOT.  The balancing £300m was returned to shareholders through share buybacks and 
permanently increasing the level of cover in our ESOT (which enhances EPS by as much as a buyback).  
We expect to generate around the same amount of free cash in the year ahead and are again budgeting 
to return £300m of cash to shareholders during the year.  We paid a £75m special dividend in February and 
have committed to a further £75m special dividend which will be paid in May.  Assuming the share price  
remains at its current level and our profit expectations remain unchanged, it is our intention to carry on paying 
quarterly special dividends for the remainder of the current year.  
SHARE BUYBACK PRICE LIMIT GOING FORWARD
In the Chief Executive’s Review last year we set out the criteria by which we would decide the maximum price 
the Company would pay to buy back shares.  We introduced the concept of Equivalent Rate of Return (ERR).   
ERR is the return required from an alternative investment, if that investment were to produce the same level 
of earnings enhancement as the proposed buyback.  We set the minimum ERR at 8%, which we consider  
a reasonable target for a return on equity investments.
Over the course of the year we have discussed this concept with our shareholders.  Most agree that the 8%  
limit is reasonable but many have commented that it would be more logical to use the Company’s guidance for 
forward profits as a basis for calculating the 8% ERR, rather than historic profits.  We agree with this point and, going  
forward, will set our price limit on the basis of the mid-point of our forward guidance.
For year ending January 2015 the mid-point of our guidance is for profit before tax to be £750m (see below).   
On this basis a buyback of £300m at £62.45 would give an ERR of 8% and this figure now represents our upper 
limit for share buybacks.  For clarity, in order for us to revert back to a buyback programme we would need  
to be convinced that any share price move below our target was likely to be sustained and that our profit 
expectations had not changed.

OUTLOOK FOR 2014
THE CONSUMER ECONOMY
The consumer economy has steadily improved over the course of the last year.  This modest improvement  
looks set to continue.  However, conditions are likely to remain far from buoyant and there are real risks  
to the sustainability of the current recovery. 
Employment Remains Strong
The most positive aspect of the economy remains employment, which continues to rise to record highs.

Credit Constraints Recede
Consumer credit has been steadily flowing back into the market.  The graph below shows the reversal of  
credit flows back into the market during 2013, with positive flows of around £7bn during the year (which equates 
to around 1% of UK earnings).  Mortgage approvals are also growing strongly and housing transactions are  
following suit, this change has been reflected in strong growth in our Home division over the last six months.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Real Earnings Pressure Easing but Still Negative
Throughout 2013, growth in earnings began to close the gap with inflation.  Encouragingly, in January there was 
little or no decline in real earnings.  If this trend continues, and real earnings move into growth, it will be good  
news for the UK consumer environment.  It would be the first time we have seen growth in real earnings for  
over five years.

Nonetheless, it is worth noting that last year’s increase in spending appears to have been driven through 
increased credit (see above).  If anything has been learnt from the last ten years it is that credit cannot  
continue to grow faster than wages forever.  Until we see significant increase in the supply side of the 
economy (profitable investment and improved productivity), we cannot bank on a return to sustained growth.   
Consequently we remain cautious in our budgeting for the year ahead.
OUTLOOK FOR NEXT BRAND SALES 2014
We are budgeting for total NEXT Brand sales growth of between 4% and 8% in the year ahead, this compares 
to the 1% to 4% estimate we gave at this time last year.  It reflects the underlying improvement in the economy  
and the fact that we are opening 1% more new space than last year.
Some might argue that our sales range is conservative when compared to the 5.5% growth we achieved last 
year.  However, last year’s total was significantly enhanced by the exceptional last quarter.  In the year ahead we  
expect the fourth quarter to provide tough comparatives and it will be hard to beat.  Accordingly we are  
budgeting very cautiously for the final quarter.  The chart below illustrates the anomalous performance in Q4.

GUIDANCE – GROUP PROFITS AND EPS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD
The table below sets out our guidance for the full year.  For the purposes of this guidance we have assumed that

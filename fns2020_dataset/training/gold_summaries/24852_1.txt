L ONG- TERM 
F OCUS
Dear Shareholder , 
Highland Gold is in the midst of its 15th year 
as a publicly-quoted enterprise. While there 
have been many achievements over the years, 
our objective remains to constantly look for 
ways to realise the substantial potential of the 
Company’s asset base. With that in mind, we 
undertook several initiatives during the year 
under review.
Among these is the ‘cluster’ initiative, 
designed to drive the Company’s progress on 
multiple fronts by focusing our development 
around existing operations and milling 
capacity and maximising corporate synergies. 
As part of this effort, the Company appointed 
a Business Development Head for each of our 
key geographic regions:
• Khabarovsk Cluster (MNV , Belaya Gora 
and Blagodatnoye);
• Baikal Cluster (Novo, Lyubov and Baley 
Hub encompassing Taseevskoye, Sredny 
Golgotay and Baley ZIF-1 Tailings); and 
• Chukotka Cluster (Kekura and Klen).
A key feature of 2016 was our extensive 
exploration activity designed to (i) provide 
additional resource for existing operations 
and (ii) advance identified development 
projects. The scale of such activity is reflected 
in more than 74,000 metres of exploration 
drilling across the Company’s portfolio 
during 2016 and a commensurate exploration 
spend of US$8.2 million.
 “I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE  
THA T THE GROWTH PO TENTIAL 
INHERENT IN OUR OPERA TING 
ASSETS AND OUR HIGH GRADE 
DEVEL OPMENT PROJECTS, 
T OGETHER WITH OUR 
COMPETITIVE COST DISCIPLINES, 
AUGUR WELL FOR THE FUTURE.” 9

Strategic Report
Engineering and construction specialists 
Fluor Canada are developing a DFS in  
this regard which will consolidate various 
specifics including SRK’s new JORC resource 
estimation and mining schedule. Delivery  
of the DFS is anticipated in Q3 2017 and 
commercial production is set to begin in 2020.
The Kekura deposit sits on a very small  
part of our licence area, which encompasses 
approximately 1,500 sq km. We have 
identified several promising targets within 
this territory , providing significant upside 
potential for the Kekura operation.
Considerable activity was seen at our other 
development projects during the year. At 
Klen we initiated an updated PFS, which is 
scheduled for completion in the first half of 
2017. At the Baley Hub deposits, we worked 
to de-risk these brownfield projects in order 
to facilitate further analysis of available 
development options.
In Kyrgyzstan, our fourth region, a scoping 
study was completed for our Unkurtash 
project and delivered in Q1 2017. We are  
now reviewing various development options, 
including the possibility of entering into  
a partnership arrangement with an 
appropriate investor.
Our primary objectives during 2017 will 
essentially mirror those for the year under 
review as we:
• Target stable levels of overall production 
from our three operating mines: MNV , 
Belaya Gora and Novo; 
• Continue to implement rigorous cost 
disciplines and efficiencies in order  
to leverage our advantage as a low- 
cost producer; 
As detailed below, exploration activity 
encompassed MNV , Belaya Gora, the 
Blagodatnoye and Sredny Golgotay deposits 
and Kekura, our premier development 
project. This work has already helped us  
to extend MNV’s life of mine and will help 
advance a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) 
for Kekura.
Alongside this with the aid of our 2016 
drilling results, we have initiated new, 
updated JORC reserve audits for our key 
operating and development assets, namely 
MNV , Novo, Belaya Gora, Blagodatnoye  
and Kekura. We aim to publish the results  
of these audits over the next 6 months. 
In 2016, we met our production guidance  
at a level of output that we are looking to 
maintain in 2017.
Novo proved the top performer with a 10% 
year-on-year increase in the production of 
gold and gold equivalent to a record 117,577 
oz. This represented 45% of total production 
and 55% of EBITDA. 
The average Au equivalent head grade was 
more than maintained at 5.61 g/t but the task 
ahead is to enhance throughput in order to 
offset the expected decline in average grade. 
To this end, plans to expand Novo’s ore 
processing capacity from 700,000 tonnes  
per annum to an annual 1.3 million tonnes  
are well advanced and we expect to reach 
targeted capacity in late 2018. 
MNV maintained stable output in 2016  
and the four-year extension of the mine’s  
life to 2022 is a valuable achievement. 
Management’s aim, however, is to extend  
the life of the mine beyond this and the  
near mine exploratory activity of 2016 will 
continue in 2017 and subsequent years 
utilising a US$3-5 million annualised budget. 
At Belaya Gora, outside consultants were 
engaged to assist in improving mine planning 
in order to address issues with dilution and 
irregular grade distribution. Work also 
continues on a project to expand cyanide 
leach (CIL) capacity to improve processing 
plant recovery rates. 
The Kekura licence, which enjoys an average 
reserve Au grade of 10.73 g/t, represents  
a world class gold deposit. A combination  
of open-pit and underground mining is 
envisaged, with a processing plant capacity 
of 800,000 tonnes per annum and a life of 
mine tentatively put at eight years.
• Progress Kekura, the expansion of  
Novo and the Belaya Gora upgrade; and
• Maintain our focus on exploration 
adjacent to MNV in order to further 
extend the life-of-mine.
Our Kekura investment, together with  
the Novo expansion, inevitably signals  
a significantly higher capex spend during  
the current financial year. With the comfort  
of a sound balance sheet, we would expect  
to fund the majority of 2017’s capex through 
operating cash flow. 
With the successful implementation of  
our key objectives – extending MNV’s  
life of mine, expanding capacity at Novo, 
improving Belaya Gora’s operations, and 
bringing Kekura online – we aim to achieve 
annualised production of 500,000 ounces. 
I have every confidence that the growth 
potential inherent in our operating assets  
and our high grade development projects, 
together with our competitive cost 
disciplines, augur well for the future. 
All of these objectives are, of course, 
dependent upon the skills and expertise  
of our employees. We are totally committed  
to the welfare of our personnel and our 
activities in this regard and in relation  
to our environmental responsibilities  
appear in the Operational Review.

Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report
Belaya Gora
With effect from Q3 2016 operations at Belaya 
Gora focused on the treatment of low-grade 
ore stockpiles (~1 g/t) while an operational 
reassessment was undertaken in response  
to irregular grade distribution, inconsistent 
mill performance and low recovery rates. 
In addition to focusing on prospective 
improvements to the processing flowsheet in 
order to increase recoveries, management is 
working with outside consultants on designs 
for the incorporation of additional cyanide 
leach (CIP) capacity at the mill. A programme 
designed to stabilise the mill input rate 
successfully lowered the tailings grade.
 
As a consequence, production of gold and 
gold equivalent recorded a 25% year-on-year 
reduction in respect of 2016 to 45,909 oz. This 
was accompanied by a fall in the recovery rate 
from 2015’s 75.4% to 71.4% and a decline in 
average grade from 2015’s 1.64 g/t to 1.21 g/t. 
Some 3,000 metres of drilling was conducted 
for the purpose of reserve confirmation. 
PRODUCTION COSTS
Total cash costs amounted to US$678 per oz 
(2015: US$465 per oz) while all-in sustaining 
costs were US$1,134 per oz (2015: US$551  
per oz).
CAPIT AL COSTS
A total of US$6.1 million was invested at  
Belaya Gora in 2016. This included capitalised 
expenditures and construction (US$2.9 million) 
and purchase of equipment (US$3.2 million).
OUTLOOK 
The results of a comprehensive review of  
the processing plant flowsheet, carried out 
during the final quarter of 2016, are expected 
in the new financial year as is a new JORC- 
compliant reserve statement from SRK. 
Blagodatnoye
In order to augment Belaya Gora’s mineral 
resource base, management has targeted 
further exploration of resources at the 
Blagodatnoye gold deposit, located some  
40 km from Belaya Gora. The licence enjoys 
preliminarily measured С2 category reserves, 
suitable for open-pit mining, comprising 
some 10 million tonnes of ore. Initial 
metallurgical testwork has supported gold 
recovery of more than 90% via cyanidation.
Following an extensive 15,000 metre  
reserve verification drilling programme 
earlier in the year, work at Blagodatnoye  
in Q4 focused on the collation and 
interpretation of exploration results. 
OPERA TIONAL REVIEW
KHABAROVSK REGION, RUSSIA
Mnogovershinnoye (MNV)
Production of gold and gold equivalent at 
MNV in 2016 edged ahead from 94,558 oz  
to 96,188 oz representing a near 37% share of 
total production. The average grade showed  
a 3% improvement year-on-year from 2.29 g/t 
to 2.36 g/t, while the recovery rate rose from 
90.4% to 91.5%. Ore processed totalled 
1,380,963 tonnes (2015: 1,412,819 tonnes). 
A detailed reappraisal of each of the 12 ore 
bodies across the licence area continued  
into Q1 2017 and culminated in a four-year 
extension of the life of the mine to 2022 
following the regulatory approval of reserves 
under Russian (GKZ) classification. The 
primary target, however, is to extend the  
life of the mine beyond this (see ‘Outlook’).  
In total, more than 18,000 metres of drilling 
was carried out during 2016.
The evaluation of MNV’s historic rock dumps 
saw a total of 758,200 tonnes of ore identified 
during the course of 2016. This programme 
will continue in 2017.
PRODUCTION COSTS
Total cash costs amounted to US$607 per oz 
(2015: US$691 per oz) while all-in sustaining 
costs were US$765 per oz (2015: US$881  
per oz).
CAPIT AL COSTS
A total of US$14.0 million was invested  
at MNV in 2016. This included capitalised 
expenditures and construction (US$4.1 
million), purchase of equipment (US$8.7 
million) and exploration (US$1.2 million).
1
OUTLOOK 
The extensive near-mine exploration activity 
seen during 2016 will continue in 2017 with  
a view to further extending the life of the mine 
beyond 2022. Such activity will encompass: 
• The lower horizons of the existing 
underground mine;
• Areas in the vicinity of open-pit operations;
• Near-mine Greenfield sites on adjacent 
licences; and 
• Historic rock dumps. 
Specific targets, utilising an annual budget  
of US$3-5 million, will include the Southern, 
Flank, Upper, and Quiet ore zones and, 
additionally , the MNV North-Western  
Flank licence (Bear ore body). 
An updated JORC-compliant reserve audit  
of MNV is currently in progress, with results 
expected during Q2 2017.
CAPIT AL COSTS
A total of US$2.0 million was invested  
at Blagodatnoye in 2016 and represented a 
capitalised exploration and evaluation asset.
1
 
OUTLOOK
A report on reserve estimates is expected to  
be submitted to the State Expert Review Panel 
during H1 2017. A JORC-compliant reserves 
statement is scheduled for publication within 
the same time frame. 
ZABAIKALSKY REGION, RUSSIA
Novoshirokinskoye (Novo)
Production of gold and gold equivalent at 
Novo in 2016 recorded a 10% increase from 
106,621 oz to 117,577 oz representing a 45% 
share of total production. The average grade 
showed a modest 0.7% improvement year- 
on-year from 5.58 g/t to 5.62 g/t, while the 
recovery rate shaded from 85.98% to 85.88%. 
Ore processed advanced by 9.6% to 757,971 
tonnes (2015: 691,284 tonnes). 
Plans to expand Novo’s annual ore processing 
capacity from 700,000 tonnes per annum  
to an annualised 1.3 million tonnes gathered 
momentum in Q4 2016. Geotechnical work was 
completed at construction sites together with 
inspections of buildings and various structures 
under renovation. 
PRODUCTION COSTS
Total cash costs amounted to US$254 per oz 
(2015: US$302 per oz) while all-in sustaining 
costs were US$274 per oz (2015: US$353  
per oz).

CAPIT AL COSTS
A total of US$11.0 million was invested at Novo 
in 2016. This included capitalised expenditures 
and construction (US$6.4 million) and purchase 
of equipment (US$4.6 million).
OUTLOOK 
The preparation of design documentation in 
relation to the planned expansion is well under 
way and a selection process has commenced  
for contractors with regard to construction  
and installation work. The mine is expected to 
achieve targeted production capacity in late 2018.
A new JORC reserve statement is expected  
in Q2 2017.

Sredny Golgotay – Kaftan Site
The pilot mining project at the Sredny 
Golgotay (Kaftan site), designed to evaluate 
the provision of additional resources for the 
Novo mill versus a stand-alone operation, 
resulted in the processing of 15,295 tonnes  
of ore with an average grade of 3.22 g/t. 
Delivery to Novo and subsequent treatment 
yielded 1,315 oz of gold and gold equivalent.
During Q4 2016 the results of the grade 
control drilling programme conducted  
earlier in the year, totalling 7,330 metres,  
in conjunction with operating data, served  
to delineate ore bodies to facilitate any  
future mining at the Kaftan site. The  
drilling programme, designed to validate  
the quantity and quality of reserves in  
the area, was completed in July , having  
been performed from above and below  
the surface. The evaluation programme 
utilised 8,281 assay results. 
CAPIT AL COSTS
A total of US$0.6 million was invested  
at Sredny Golgotay-Kaftan in 2016. 
Baley Ore Cluster (T aseevskoye, Sredny 
Golgotay and ZIF-1)
As at the 2016 year end, a de-watering 
programme at the Taseevskoye open-pit, 
initiated the previous May , had resulted  
in the removal of more than 2 million m
3
  
of water out of a total of 7 million m
3
. Water 
levels continue to decrease – there are no 
signs of inflow from the nearby Baley pit – 
and the pumping programme is scheduled  
to continue throughout 2017.
At Sredny Golgotay , R&D testwork continued 
regarding the advisability of utilising an 
X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) 
sorting plant to enable the pre-concentration 
of gold-bearing ores. The preliminary results 
of a pilot XRF operation, received in Q4 2016, 
fell short of expectations, primarily due to  
an insufficient level of the separation required 
to make the process viable. Nevertheless, the 
study continues utilising different equipment 
and finer grain sizes. 
Exploration work also continued at Sredny 
Golgotay – in addition to the aforementioned 
work at the Kaftan site – where 1,757 metres 
of trenching during Q4 2016 took the year’s 
total to 2,027 metres with logging completed 
in full. Some 1,985 samples were extracted 
during the final quarter taking the year’s  
total to 2,210 samples. Contractor SGS Chita 
delivered 311 fire assay results during Q4 
2016 with an additional 1,979 scheduled for 
subsequent delivery . 
Diamond drilling activity totalled 5,146 
metres in Q4 (with 5,695 samples extracted) 
and 15,919 metres for the year (with 16,508 
samples extracted). A total of 14,001 fire  
assay results were received with results  
for the remaining 3,410 samples scheduled  
for subsequent delivery . 
With the benefit of these results, work will 
continue in 2017 regarding the delineation  
of the licence’s ore bodies and the compilation 
of reserve estimates. 
CAPIT AL COSTS
A total of US$5.1 million was invested at the 
three Baley area licences in 2016, excluding 
Sredny Golgotay-Kaftan.
L yubov Ore Cluster (ZIF tailings)
An outside contractor was retained to  
oversee a resource verification project at 
Lyubov during the second half of 2016.  
The project entailed the trial processing of 
material from the Khaverginskoye, Lyubov 
and Nikolaevskoye tailings dams and waste 
dumps within the Lyubov licence area and 
involved 4,200 m
3
 of trenching and 96 metres 
of exploratory drilling to evaluate available 
resources. Sample selection was carried out 
by SGS Chita. A total of 5,680 tonnes of ore 
was treated, yielding 170 oz of gold.
CAPIT AL COSTS
A total of US$0.2 million was invested  
at Lyubov in 2016. 
CHUK OTKA AUTONOMOUS  
DISTRICT , RUSSIA 
Kekura
Processing of results from the 25,000-metre 
Kekura exploration programme was 
completed during the fourth quarter of  
2016. Drilling activity had focused on the 
eastern flank of the deposit for the purpose  
of confirming resource and potentially adding 
reserves suitable for underground mining. 
The development of a definitive feasibility 
study (DFS) for the Kekura project by Fluor 
Canada commenced in October 2016. SRK 
was awarded a contract to draft the mining 
section of the DFS, a task that began two 
months later. The process will continue in 
2017 as Fluor consolidates the various 
sections of the DFS into a single report. 
Fluor is also involved in the tender process 
for processing plant equipment, and tenders 
have been received in respect of milling and 
crushing equipment, power generators and 
press filters. 
Preparations for the 2017 construction  
season are ongoing, including the procurement 
of construction materials and work with 
contractors with regard to key infrastructure 
facilities. A winter road to the site has  
already been constructed and shipments  
of diesel fuel and key commodity supplies  
are being transported from the ports of Pevek 
and Magadan. 
The results of a JORC-compliant resource 
re-evaluation are also expected in the second 
half of 2017.
Klen
Preparation of a revised pre-feasibility study 
(PFS) was ongoing throughout the second half 
of 2016. Contractor Hatch has provided data  
on mining methodology , processing plant 
design and infrastructure solutions together 
with a financial and economic model. Further 
clarification in respect of processing parameters 
is required and, following additional process 
testwork, an updated report is scheduled  
for 2017.

Strategic Report
HEAL TH, SAFETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
The safety and welfare of our employees is  
of paramount importance and, sadly , a fatality  
at MNV during the year under review serves 
to underline the need for constant vigilance 
on the part of management and each and 
every member of the workforce. 
We have always placed considerable emphasis 
on the need for employees to assume a sense 
of responsibility for their safety and for the 
safety of others and, to this end, various  
staff training courses and workshops are  
held each year. In parallel with such activities 
there is constant focus on the need to maximise 
safety measures in order to minimise 
occupational risks. 
Our unvarying target is to achieve a zero 
incident rate, irrespective of the hazardous 
characteristics of the mining industry .  
In order to further these priorities a new 
Health and Safety Team was assembled last 
autumn for the specific purpose of improving 
the implementation of best safety practices 
across all operations. In line with our historic 
approach, the plan is to institute an 
occupational safety management system that 
prioritises the improvement of employees’ 
behaviour in respect of health and safety .
Senior staff from the Moscow management 
office Russdragmet (33 managers), Novo  
(18 managers) and MNV (19 managers), 
attended a highly informative course entitled 
“Conscious Safety Management” during the 
final quarter of 2016. At Novo, 36 managers, 
specialists and workers participated in  
a training course on “Internal Accident 
Investigation”. 
New corporate standards for Internal Incident 
Investigation, a methodology for Behavioural 
Safety Audits and rules and regulations in 
respect of Occupational Safety Committees 
have been developed. Tools for Behavioural 
Safety Audits and Leader Bypass were 
introduced at Novo and MNV .
Such developments, set to gather momentum

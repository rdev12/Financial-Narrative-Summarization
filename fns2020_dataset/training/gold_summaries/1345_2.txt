Profit/(loss) before taxation (£m)
£( 36.5)m
Continued growth in revenue and proﬁt in all divisions
with full year underlying operating proﬁt of £150.5m,
up 45% at constant exchange rates.
On a pro forma basis Sunbelt’s underlying full year
operating proﬁt grew by 43% to $272.3m reﬂecting the
progress made to date on the NationsRent integration.
On the same pro forma basis, A-Plant delivered
underlying operating proﬁt growth of 40% to £20.7m
reﬂecting its strong 11% organic improvement in pro
forma revenues.
Underlying basic earnings per share declined 3% at
constant exchange rates to 10.3p reﬂecting the expected
ﬁrst year dilution from the NationsRent acquisition.
The loss before tax for the year of £36.5m (2006: proﬁt
of £81.7m) is after charging exceptional costs, fair value
remeasurements and intangible amortisation amounting
to £117.9m (2006: £14.2m credit). No further
exceptional costs relating to the NationsRent acquisition
are expected.
Final dividend of 1.1p per share proposed, making 1.65p
for the year (2006: 1.5p).
* At constant exchange rates.
The ﬁgures for 2005, 2006 and 2007 are reported in accordance with IFRS. Figures for 2003 and 2004 are reported under UK GAAP and have not been restated in accordance with IFRS.
Underlying proﬁt is stated before exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangibles and non-cash fair value remeasurements of embedded derivatives in long-term debt.
The deﬁnition of exceptional items is set out in note 1 to the attached ﬁnancial statements.
Reference to pro forma basis throughout this annual report and accounts includes the NationsRent and Lux Trafﬁc acquisitions throughout both periods. For this purpose the pre-acquisition results of
NationsRent have been derived from its reported performance under US GAAP adjusted to exclude the large proﬁts on disposal of rental equipment it reported following the application of US “fresh start”
accounting principles and to include an estimated depreciation charge under Ashtead’s depreciation policies.

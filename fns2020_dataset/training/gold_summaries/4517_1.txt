CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STRATEGY REVIEW:
The sale and manage-back of The De Vere 
Belfry in March was perhaps the most 
signiﬁcant event of the year. The hotel 
was sold to the Quinn Group for £186 
million, a 47% premium to net book value. 
The full net proceeds were returned to 
shareholders via a special dividend of 159 
pence per share. In parallel, we negotiated 
a 25-year management contract.
We have also completed a full revaluation 
of our assets during the year, resulting in a 
net gain of £102 million. This gain, along 
with the signiﬁcant value realised through  
The De Vere Belfry transaction, is clear 
evidence of the beneﬁts of asset ownership 
and of our commitment to maximising 
shareholder value.
The successful conclusion of some of the 
Group’s historical tax issues means that we 
have been able to recognise a £44 million 
deferred tax beneﬁt. As a result, the Group 
is now unlikely to pay tax in the medium-
term, signiﬁcantly beneﬁting cashﬂow and 
post-cash tax returns.
Turning to our four-part strategy:

SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN EXTERNAL 
COSTS. GOOD PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN ALL 
AREAS OF OUR FOUR-PART STRATEGY WHICH HAS 
NOW MOVED INTO THE DELIVERY PHASE.

Chief Executive LEVERAGING OUR STRONG BRANDS
This year we commenced the roll-out of a 
customer service programme across the 
business, implemented comprehensive 
measurement systems to track customer 
satisfaction and developed new logos for 
our two hotel brands. The beneﬁts can be 
seen in the results of JD Power’s inaugural 
European Hotel Guest Satisfaction Study, in 
which De Vere Hotels ranked top in the ﬁrst 
class category. This was in addition to the 
results of two leading industry surveys, the 
BDRC British Hotel Guest Survey 2005 and 
BDRC UK Meetings Survey 2005, Select 
Brands, which reported that De Vere Hotels 
enjoys the highest level of customer loyalty 
in the leisure and conference segments 
respectively. These levels of guest satisfaction 
support our RevPAR premia of 31% and  
41% for De Vere Hotels and Village Hotels  
& Leisure Clubs respectively.
Our customer relationship management 
(CRM) strategy is already delivering great 
results with CRM campaigns generating 
£0.75 million of incremental revenue from 
the leisure market this year. Weekend 
occupancy in De Vere Hotels rose by almost 
2% points over the summer period (June to 
August). 
IMPLEMENTING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
The leading-edge reservations system, Fidelio 
Opera, has been fully implemented across 
Village and De Vere Hotels. The ability to 
deliver real-time availability and price parity 
through the internet has driven a dramatic 
increase in room bookings through our 
brand websites, accounting for 6.0% of 
total bookings in the six months since it 
was launched, versus 0.7% in the same 
period last year. Real-time availability via 
GDS supported a 24% (£1.5 million) revenue 
growth through this channel. In addition, 
we are on track to save £0.75 million per 
annum by increased efﬁciency and reduced 
transaction costs.
During the year we piloted our new 
revenue management system and selected 
a preferred software system, IdeaS. Full 
implementation across all hotels is expected 
to be completed during the next ﬁnancial 
year and early results from the pilot give us 
conﬁdence that a signiﬁcant uplift in RevPAR 
is achievable. 
We are on target to achieve procurement and 
efﬁciency savings of £3 million per annum by 
2006/07, having achieved approximately two-
thirds of this by 2004/05. However, increased 
utility costs and business rates are likely to 
more than offset these gains.
The sharing of best practice in health & 
ﬁtness membership sales processes resulted 
in a strong increase in membership numbers 
in both Village and Greens during the ﬁrst 
half. However, the gain in membership 
numbers was eroded in the second half as a 
result of an increasingly competitive trading 
environment.

BRANDS OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE VILLAGE GROWTH
Bedroom extensions to the existing estate 
are progressing ahead of plan. A 28 
bedroom extension at Village Bury was 
completed in July 2005 followed by 32 
bedrooms added at Village Cardiff in 
August 2005. We are currently building 
additional bedrooms at Cheadle (42 
bedrooms) and Nottingham (51 bedrooms) 
and have gained planning permission for a 
42 bedroom extension at Village Newcastle 
and 36 bedrooms at Leeds.
The new site roll-out also continues apace. 
Village Walsall, which opened in December 
2004, continues to perform ahead of 
expectations. Village Bournemouth is due 
to open in December 2005 and will be 
followed by Village Hull in February 2006 
and Swansea in January 2007. Subject 
to planning permission, we have now 
exchanged contracts on a site in South 
Leeds and a site in Elstree. In addition, we 
are at advanced stages of negotiation on a 
further three sites, with a strong pipeline of 
opportunities identiﬁed.
IMPROVING DE VERE RETURNS
We announced in April 2005 the ﬁrst 
expansion of the De Vere brand overseas 
with the management contract at Roda Golf 
& Beach Resort, Murcia. This 150 bedroom 
hotel with spa and 18-hole championship 
golf course is scheduled to open in 2008. 
We have also agreed, with the same owner, 
a management contract over a smaller hotel 
and golf development at nearby Corvera. 
Development opportunities elsewhere look 
promising. 
We remain excited about the development 
opportunities within our existing De Vere 
estate, although planning delays have 
pushed back timescales signiﬁcantly. 
Nevertheless, planning permission has 
been received for 41 bedrooms at Dunston 
Hall, where construction will begin in 
spring 2006. We are progressing planning 
applications for a further 125 bedrooms 
across six hotels.
De Vere Resort Ownership (DVRO) provides 
an important route to enhanced returns. 
Over and above The Carrick development, 
two further opportunities within the existing 
estate have been identiﬁed, although 
planning will be sensitive. However, in the 
short-term, DVRO’s performance is being 
impacted due to its close link to consumer 
conﬁdence and the property market, both 
of which have slowed during 2005.
RETURNS TARGET
When our four-part strategy was launched 
two years ago, we targeted a 10% Group 
EBIT return on capital employed (ROCE) 
by the end of 2007. This goal has been 
critical in achieving internal alignment with 
shareholder interests and to galvanise the 
entire organisation to focus on returns.
We have made good progress toward this 
goal in the last two years, increasing EBIT 
returns from 6.5% to 7.5%, excluding 
disposals, new openings and capital 
work-in-progress. This has been achieved 
despite a difﬁcult consumer environment 
impacting our health & ﬁtness businesses 
and DVRO and substantial increases in 
utilities and business rates that will now 
exceed our original projections by £6.5 
million in 2006/07. In addition, planning 
has delayed the construction of high 
returning developments at existing De Vere 
hotels and has meant that these projects 
will now have an adverse impact on returns 
in 2006/07, rather than the anticipated 
positive contribution.
8 I DE VERE GROUP PLC I CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGY REVIEW
VILLAGE GROWTH
• NEW VILLAGE OPENED AT WALSALL.
• 5 HOTELS UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR IN PLANNING.
•  EXTENSION PROGRAMME ON TRACK – EXTRA 150+ 
BEDROOMS ADDED OR CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION; 
PLANNING GRANTED FOR ADDITIONAL 75+ BEDROOMS.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGY REVIEW (CONTINUED) Moreover, there have been a number 
of material non-trading items that have 
complicated the overall picture, including 
the sale and manage-back of The De Vere 
Belfry, which, whilst clearly a very good deal 
for shareholders, diluted returns by 20 bps. 
Also, the movement in deferred tax has had 
the effect of increasing capital employed 
by £58 million and the property revaluation 
has resulted in an impairment charge of £40 
million, despite a net increase in values of 
£102 million.
Looking ahead, changes to accounting 
standards will lead to further complexity in 
the areas of share-based payments and non-
cash IFRS adjustments to capital employed. 
The combined effect is that, whilst we are 
making good progress on our four-part 
strategy and are achieving a post-cash tax 
return ahead of the Group’s cost of capital, 
we will now not achieve a 10% return by 
2006/07.
It is the Board’s view, particularly given the 
current market position of our hotel brands, 
that there is real synergy between owning 
and operating. Well-targeted investment 
and improved operational performance have 
both contributed signiﬁcantly to the uplift in 
property values reported in these results. 
Looking forward, we have been clear where 
we see further investment opportunities 
within our existing estate and are conﬁdent 
of improving trading across the Group. 
Accordingly, our shareholders can expect to 
continue to beneﬁt not only from increased 
earnings but also from growth in asset 
values.
In this context, it remains the Board’s 
belief that a focus on returns is the best 
framework for disciplined decision-
making. It has helped reshape our business 
approach, re-energised our internal teams 
and repositioned us as a Company that 
will have no hesitation in selling assets 
where a disposal can realise a higher value 
than could be achieved through continued 
ownership. Our resolve in this regard has 
been evidenced by our decisions to dispose 
of Village Prestwich and Village Swindon, 
the De Vere Bellhouse and the De Vere 
Dormy, and most signiﬁcantly, the sale and 
manage-back of The De Vere Belfry. 
We remain conﬁdent that our four-part 
strategy will continue to deliver growth  
and higher returns.

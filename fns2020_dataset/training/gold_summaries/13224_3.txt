 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008_3
Chairman’s statement
Chairman’s statement
Another record year
I am pleased to report that whilst the market
has become tougher in the ﬁnal quarter of 2008,
it has been another year of record results for
Regus. We have delivered post-tax earnings
of £114.9 million and increased our net cash
balance by over 100% from £101.4 million to
£211.2 million, despite having returned £36.3
million to shareholders, £37.5 million to the
banks and invested £69.5 million in growing
our workstation capacity.
Our business model remains strong, with
our results clearly demonstrating the focused
execution of our strategy for proﬁtable growth
and strong cash ﬂow conversion in rapidly
changing markets.
Financial performance
Group revenue has increased by 24.9% to
£1,077.2 million and gross proﬁt by 21.4%
to £305.7 million. Excluding the impact of new
centre growth the “like for like” improvement
was 14.1% and 14.7% respectively.
This increase was the result of our continued,
controlled blend of organic growth and targeted
acquisition activity, coupled with the impact of
currency translation, principally the strengthening
of the dollar and euro, contributing 40% of the
overall revenue increase.
Capacity growth
We have continued our measured approach to
growth and in the year to 31 December 2008
we grew our average available workstations
by 15.3%.
Our improved results were driven by average
occupancy increasing to 82.9% from 82.7%
in 2007 and revenue per available workstation
(“REVPAW”) increasing 8.4% to £7,029 from
£6,487 in 2007. Earnings (proﬁt after tax) grew
by 10.9% to £114.9 million and basic earnings
per share increased by 14.3% to 12.0p.
During the ﬁnancial year, we opened 112
centres for a total investment of £69.5 million.
Despite the ongoing challenges of the global
economy, we anticipate continuing to make
targeted investments to develop further our
market presence.
Dividend
Given our strong performance the Board is
recommending a 1.2p per share ﬁnal dividend
for the year. This will be in addition to the interim
dividend of 0.6p per share paid by Regus Group
Limited (then Regus Group plc) in October 2008.
Subject to the approval of shareholders at the
2009 AGM, this ﬁnal dividend will be paid on
Friday 29 May 2009 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on Friday
1 May 2009.
Board
In order to achieve our objective of greater
international diversity at board level, the
appointment of three new non-executive
directors – Douglas Sutherland, Ulrich
Ogiermann and Lance Browne – took place
from October 2008. Douglas replaces Stephen
East as Chairman of the Audit Committee.
I would like to thank Stephen and Roger Orf,
who both departed Regus as non-executive
directors at the end of 2008, for their
longstanding service to the Company.

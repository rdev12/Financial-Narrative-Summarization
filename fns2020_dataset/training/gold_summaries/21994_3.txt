 Annual Report & Accounts 2013

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
This has been another year of 
considerable progress for the Group. 
Profit before tax has increased by 22% 
from £8.52m to £10.40m, and earnings 
per share by 15% from 57.43p to 65.76p. 
This is after charging £1.0m of costs 
incurred in the acquisition of Spearpoint, 
the Channel Islands fund management 
business now renamed Brooks Macdonald 
International.
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 16p per share which, if 
approved by shareholders, will result in 
total dividends for the year of 22.5p. This 
represents an increase of 22% over last 
year’s total dividends of 18.5p per share. 
The final dividend will be paid on 18 
October 2013 to shareholders who are on 
the register at the close of business on  
20 September 2013.
Spearpoint became part of the Group in 
November 2012, our first venture outside 
the UK, which will be the focus of what we 
hope will be a significant offshore business. 
We now have offices in Jersey and 
Guernsey, with two businesses: Asset 
Management and Retirement Services. The 
acquisition was in part funded by a 
successful share placing with institutional 
investors raising over £21m, the first fund 
raising by the Group since our shares were 
admitted to AIM in 2005.
Our discretionary funds under management 
had a strong year and as at 30 June 2013 
totalled £5.11bn (2012: £3.52bn), a rise of 
45% over the 12 month period. Net of the 
Spearpoint acquisition, this represents an 
increase of 25.6%, compared to growth of 
9.8% in the APCIMS Balanced Index over 
the same period.
Property assets under administration grew 
to £1.04bn, an increase of 20% (2012: 
£865m) and third party assets under 
administration are now in excess of £140m 
(2012: £50m). In addition, as a result of 
the acquisition of Spearpoint, we had 
advisory funds under management of 
£348m at the year end.
In addition to these acquisitions the Group 
has continued to grow organically and 
invest for the future. The number of 
professional introducers using our asset 
managers continues to rise, we have 
recruited quality new fund managers and 
consultants and we continue to invest in 
our trainee programme, investment 
management process and IT systems.
The last year has been a year of 
considerable progress but also of change. 
The introduction of the Retail Distribution 
Review in January, something that we 
supported, has led to changes across the 
whole industry and to continued rises in 
regulatory costs. Together with a re-pricing 
of our Managed Portfolio Service (MPS) 
and with the investments highlighted 
above, as we indicated in July this year, this 
will lead to an adverse effect on our 
margins in the new financial year.
In spite of these changes we remain 
focussed on maintaining performance 
levels for our clients, our staff and our 
shareholders and are pleased with the 
significant progress achieved by the Group 
over the last financial year and look forward 
to the future with confidence.

Delivering our strategic plan
Chief Executive’ s review
“We have met or exceeded all 
of  our strategic priorities and 
targets for the year . 3i is now  
a more streamlined, decisive 
organisation focused on high 
performance and delivering 
attractive shareholder returns. ”
Introduction
FY201 4 was another busy year for 
everyone at 3i. We met or exceeded all 
of our strategic priorities and targets 
for  the year , and I am pleased to report 
a  strong set of results. We are now 
almost two years into the three-year 
strategic plan that I set out in June 201 2. 
This year’ s strong performance 
benefited from the considerable 
progress made during our 
restructuring phase in FY201 3. 
3i generated a total shareholder return of 30% compared  
to 9% for the FTSE All-Share index. Like many UK-based 
companies, we faced currency headwinds this year and  
the performance is all the more credible in view of that. 
During the year, we delivered a good flow of realisations 
and a total return of 16.3%. This included a good progression 
in NAV per share to 348 pence at 31 March 2014, from 
31 1 pence at 31 March 2013. 
As announced in November 2013, given the strong level of 
realisations, the emphasis on selective investment in these 
high-priced market conditions and our healthy balance sheet 
position, we have initiated additional shareholder distributions. 
The total proposed dividend for the financial year to  
31 March 2014 is 20 pence per share, a yield of over 6% to  
the 316 pence share price at the close of 28 March 2013.  
We paid one-third of this, 6.7 pence per share, in January 2014 
as an interim dividend. Subject to shareholder approval, we 
will pay the balance of 13.3 pence per share as a final 
dividend in July 2014.

Performance in the year
The Private Equity business made excellent progress this 
year, generating a gross investment return of £647 million 
(24% on opening value), reflecting the strong realisation 
activity and good earnings growth across the portfolio. 
We continue to see significant benefits from the asset 
management improvement initiatives launched in FY2013. 
The majority of our investments generated earnings growth 
during the year, with larger investments such as Action 
continuing to perform very well. A consequence of this strong 
performance is an increase in the carry payable we are 
accruing on our Proprietary Capital, although we have some 
way to go before this becomes a cash payment. Overall, the 
Private Equity investment portfolio is in much better shape 
than it was two years ago and I believe it offers significant 
potential for further value creation.
During the year, we delivered a good flow of Private Equity 
realisations, generating £669 million of total proceeds for 3i 
and realised profits over opening valuation of £201 million,  
an overall uplift of 43%. Including third-party funds managed 
by 3i, total Private Equity realisation proceeds in the period 
were £1.1 billion. These were achieved at a total money 
multiple of 1.8x, generating good returns on both proprietary 
and third-party capital for the benefit of our shareholders  
and fund investors. We realised a mix of investments over  
the year, including a good number of our smaller, more 
challenged investments. We have not sold any of our longer-
term hold investments which make up the largest part of our 
portfolio value. Their strong performance has led to material 
improvement in Eurofund V and the Growth Capital Fund, 
which have now recovered to 1.13x and 1.32x respectively 
of invested capital at 31 March 2014. This compares to 
0.91x and 1.04x at 31 March 2013 respectively.
As at 31 March 2014, our Private Equity portfolio comprised 
81 different investments, many of which have relatively low 
value. Over the next few years, as we continue to realise 
older and smaller value investments and pursue a focused 
investment strategy, we expect the number of investments 
held in our Private Equity portfolio to more than halve. This 
will create a much more manageable portfolio and generate 
further operating efficiencies.
For the Private Equity business, a key highlight of the year 
was the increased momentum in new investment activity 
with four key investments: Basic-Fit (leading European 
discount fitness operator), GIF (German-based specialist in 
transmission testing), JMJ (global management consultancy) 
and a substantial further investment in Scandlines (leading 
European ferry operator). In total, cash investment was 
£372 million including third-party funds, of which £276 million 
was 3i’s proprietary capital. We made these investments 
at careful prices and expect this group of assets to deliver 
considerable upside value over the medium term.
While this pick-up in new investment activity is encouraging, 
we remain highly selective given the current high-price 
environment. We continue to focus on our core sectors and 
geographies where we have real experience and where our 
international platform and capabilities are a differentiator.  
We focus on mid-market investments which we are able to 
secure using our local expertise and presence, away from 
highly competitive auction processes. A key aspect of our 
differentiated business model is that we lead investments 
with our own balance sheet. We aim to fund a majority 
of each investment with proprietary capital as well 
as managing the balance of third-party funds for our  
co-investors. This enables us to retain a material share  
of the alpha-generating economics. 8

Strategic report
In Infrastructure, the European portfolio continued to  
perform well and generated a good level of cash income 
for the Group, through both dividends and advisory fees 
from 3i Infrastructure plc. However, the value of the 3i India 
Infrastructure Fund declined during the year, driven by the 
combination of a material depreciation in the Indian rupee  
and political and macroeconomic challenges in India.  
3i Infrastructure plc’s core European portfolio is expected  
to be the key driver of future performance and accounted  
for 78% of 3i’s underlying Infrastructure portfolio value 
at 31 March 2014, compared with 68% at 31 March 2013.
In November 2013, 3i completed the acquisition from Barclays 
of their European infrastructure fund management business, 
adding over £700 million of assets under management and 
experienced investment teams in both London and Paris. 
This business was a pioneer in the PPP market and currently 
manages two unlisted funds focused on UK and European 
PPP and low-risk energy projects. This strategic acquisition 
is a key milestone in the development of our Infrastructure 
business and I believe it will broaden and enhance our access 
to new investment opportunities, as well as providing 
a platform for future fundraising.
In February 2014, following the announcement of Cressida 
Hogg’s departure, we appointed Ben Loomes and Phil White 
as Managing Partners and Co-heads of the Infrastructure 
business. This important leadership change brings fresh 
impetus and further underlines 3i’s commitment to the next 
stage of development of its Infrastructure platform.
Furthermore, in May 2014, 3i Infrastructure plc announced 
that it had agreed, subject to shareholder approval, and 
approval from the Jersey Financial Services Commission,  
a number of amendments to the existing advisory agreement 
with 3i. These included extending the term of the advisory 
agreement for a minimum of a further five years.
There continues to be a strong demand for infrastructure 
assets as investors seek yield. While the market remains 
competitive, we are seeing a number of interesting 
investment opportunities in our target markets. For example, 
in June last year, 3i Infrastructure plc invested £62 million 
in Cross London Trains, which will own a key element 
of London’s commuter rail infrastructure. In addition, 
it announced investments in the National Military Museum 
(Netherlands) and Mersey Gateway Bridge (UK) primary 
PPP projects, sourced through our new PPP platform, 
and see a strong pipeline for further PPP investments.
In Debt Management, third-party management fee income 
remained steady at £32 million (201 3: £31 million), representing 
44% of the Group’s total third-party management fee income 
in the period. At 31 March 2014, the business managed 
£6.5 billion of assets through 28 funds, 17 in Europe and 
1 1 in the US.
Market activity was buoyant during the year, following the 
re-opening of the European CLO market early in 2013.  
Levels of new CLO issuance in the US were dampened in 
early 2014 by anticipated regulatory changes but have 
subsequently recovered. We capitalised on this with the 
launch of two new European CLOs (Harvest VII and Harvest 
VIII) and two new US CLOs (Jamestown III and COA Summit). 
Together, these new CLO funds added £1.2 billion of AUM 
including £40 million of proprietary capital.
During the year, Debt Management generated a gross 
investment return of £16 million, equating to 20% of its 
opening portfolio value.
Since the period end, we have made good progress towards 
launching further CLO funds and we have warehousing 
vehicles in place in both Europe and the US to seed these 
future launches.

Strategic objectives 
and progress
Last year, I set out a number of key strategic objectives:
  Cover operating costs with annual cash income
  Grow third-party income and generate 
a sustainable annual operating profit from 
our fund management activities
  Improve capital allocation, focusing on enhanced 
shareholder distributions and re-investment in 
our core investment businesses
Our progress against each of these objectives is 
described below.
Cover operating costs with annual 
cash income
Prior to the launch of 3i’s restructuring in 2012, the Group’s 
operating costs materially exceeded its annual cash income 
from management fees and portfolio income. An important 
target in FY2014 was to cover the Group’s operating costs 
with annual cash income. The major cost reduction 
programme announced in June 2012 was a key part 
of achieving this objective. 
In FY2013, we significantly outperformed our original target 
of £40 million of annualised run-rate operating cost savings, 
achieving £51 million of cost savings at 31 March 2013. In this 
context, we announced last year a new target of £60 million of 
cumulative run-rate cost savings to be achieved by 31 March 
2014. I am pleased to report that we exceeded this target 
as well, delivering £70 million of run-rate cost savings at 
31 March 2014. These savings represent over a third of the 
Group’s total opening run-rate cost base of £185 million 
at 31 March 2012, before we announced the restructuring.  
As a result, actual operating costs in the year were 
£136 million, 20% lower than last year (2013: £170 million), 
including restructuring costs of £9 million (2013: £30 million). 
Restructuring costs were higher than the £7 million 
estimated, in order to secure the higher savings. We expect 
the full benefits of this cost reduction programme to be 
realised during FY2015.
In FY2014, the Group’s cash income was consistent with the 
prior year at £132 million. This was driven by the acquisition 
of the European PPP platform in our Infrastructure business 
and the launch of new CLO funds and increased portfolio 
income from proprietary capital deployed in our Debt 
Management business. This offset the reduction in fee 
income from Private Equity as a result of net divestment 
activity, as well as the Growth Capital Fund coming to the 
end of its investment period in the previous year.
To help you track our progress, last year we introduced 
a new key performance indicator called “Annual operating 
cash profit”. This measures the difference between our 
annual cash income (cash fees from managing third-party 
funds and cash income from our proprietary capital portfolio) 
and our annual operating expenses, excluding restructuring 
costs. As noted above, in the past, 3i has operated at 
a material deficit on this measure. In FY2014, we achieved 
an annual operating cash profit of £5 million.
Grow third-party income and generate 
a  sustainable annual operating profit 
from  our  fund management activities
Our Fund Management platforms in Private Equity, 
Infrastructure and Debt Management source and manage 
investments on behalf of both 3i and third-party funds.  
These platforms underpin our ability to make alpha-
generating investments on behalf of our shareholders, 
co-investors and fund investors. A key objective for us is 
to ensure that fees from these fund management activities, 
taken together, more than cover the costs of operating our 
platforms and that over time we are able to generate a 
sustainable annual operating profit. The costs of running  
our investment platforms include paying for our investment 
teams and the network of international offices, as well as  
the costs to the Group of providing support functions such  
as finance, information technology, compliance and  
human resources.
Our objective is to ensure that we maintain a profitable Fund 
Management platform overall, growing our AUM profitably. 
We have made strong progress in this regard. Since 31 March 
2012, total AUM has grown from £10.5 billion to £12.9 billion 
at 31 March 2014. Over the same period, through the cost 
reduction programme, we reduced our operating costs  
as a percentage of weighted average AUM from 1.5% at 
31 March 2012 to 1.0% at 31 March 2014, excluding 
restructuring costs.  10

Strategic report
In order to assess properly the profitability of our fund 
management activities, we consider the fees that can  
be generated by our entire Fund Management platform, 
treating proprietary capital invested on the same basis  
as managed third-party funds. To do this, we calculate an 
internal fee payable to the Fund Management business for 
managing our proprietary capital and call this a “synthetic 
fee”. The standalone profitability of our Fund Management  
platform is then based on measuring the total fund 
management income (third-party fees plus synthetic fees) 
against the operating costs allocated to the platform, 
excluding restructuring and amortisation costs. To help you 
track this profitability, we have introduced a new key 
performance indicator called “Underlying Fund Management 
profit and margin” (further details on page 46). In FY2014, 
our fund management platform generated an underlying 
profit and margin of £33 million and 26% respectively, 
compared to £17 million and 13% in FY2013.
Over time, we believe that our Fund Management platform is 
capable of generating sustainable and growing annual profits, 
which in turn should create additional value for shareholders 
beyond the growth in value of our proprietary investments. 
This is an important building block of the 3i Value Build which 
I talked about in my last review and which is shown 
on page 13.
Improve capital allocation, focusing 
on  enhanced shareholder  distributions 
and  re-investment in our core 
investment businesses
As part of the strategic review, we fundamentally changed  
our capital allocation approach so that, over time, we aim  
to use less of our capital to pay operating costs, funding  
costs and debt repayment, and instead focus our capital 
on additional shareholder distributions and investment 
in our core businesses.
The chart below shows the average allocation of our capital 
over the three years between FY2010-12. On average, 68%  
of the total proceeds from realisations and cash income was 
used to pay operating and funding costs and debt repayment, 
leaving just 32% for shareholder distributions and investment 
in our core businesses. In FY2014, we improved this picture 
with 50% going to shareholder distributions and re-
investment. We expect further improvement in FY2015.

Strategic report
Business model
3i’s business is a mix of proprietary capital investing and 
managing third-party capital. This “hybrid” asset manager 
business model enables us to combine capital returns from 
our proprietary balance sheet and recurring management 
fee income from our fund management activities. We believe 
that this represents a differentiated and attractive value 
proposition for our shareholders.
Investing from our own balance sheet is part of our heritage. 
Currently, proprietary AUM amounts to £3.4 billion, 
accounting for 26% of the Group’s total AUM. 3i is the largest 
single investor in its own Private Equity and Infrastructure 
funds. Putting our own capital to work alongside third-party 
investors is a fundamental part of our business model and 
strategy, and gives 3i a true competitive advantage. We view 
our role as both an active owner as well as manager of 
third-party funds. This further reinforces the alignment 
between the interests of our shareholders, our co-investors 
and our fund investors. 
So, in addition to generating capital returns from proprietary 
capital investing (our Proprietary Capital activities), we also 
consider the profitability of our Fund Management platform. 
Both parts need to generate value for the Group. Our overall 
objectives are to maximise investment returns from our 
Proprietary Capital activities and grow our Fund Management 
activities profitably. 
We are already managing the Group with this much clearer 
delineation between Proprietary Capital and Fund 
Management. Going forward, you will be able to track our 
progress through new disclosures and a combination of KPIs 
measuring our performance as an investor of Proprietary 
Capital and separately as a Fund Management business,  
in addition to overall Group performance. These KPIs are 
shown on pages 16 and 17 . The performance of these 
activities is discussed in the Financial Review, starting on 
page 40 and further disclosure on the breakdown between 
Proprietary Capital and Fund Management is shown in Note 1 
to the Audited accounts on page 1 14.
Outlook
We have continued to be successful in implementing our 
strategic plan against a backdrop of ongoing challenges in 
the macroeconomic environment. Further regulation across 
the financial services industry is also presenting additional 
challenges for our business through further costs and 
increased complexity. 
Despite this, we see the power of the 3i business model 
coming back well. Our network of local teams across our 
key geographies and our proprietary capital are two key 
competitive advantages. For example, in our mid-market 
Private Equity business, we have had teams on the ground 
across Europe for over 30 years and our franchise in those 
markets is very strong. This enables us to access attractive 
investment opportunities and using our own capital affords 
us flexibility in our approach and timescale that few  
of our competitors have.
The current environment is a tricky one for new investments. 
There is an excess of capital looking for investment 
opportunities and this has driven up sellers’ price expectations. 
We have benefited from this in our realisation programme, 
however as we review new investment we will need to 
continue to be patient and disciplined. Our proposition can 
deliver healthy alpha-generating returns if we invest, manage 
and exit well. Careful investment in mid-market Private Equity 
using 3i’s competitive advantages will generate significant 
value for the Group, its shareholders and third-party investors 
as well as take 3i back to sector-leading performance.
Everyone at 3i is committed and working hard to continue  
to deliver against our strategic plan. I would like to thank the 
entire 3i team for their efforts this year. They are key to our 
success. We are all looking forward to making further good 
progress in FY2015.

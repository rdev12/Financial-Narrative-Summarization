Strategic Report
Highlights
Highlights
 > Performance in line with management expectations 
at the time of the IPO
 > Revenue growth driven by acquisitions: 
 > 3.2% organic revenue growth  
(5.2% on a like‑for‑like currency basis)
 > Inorganic revenue growth of 14.8%, notably as a result 
of the acquisition of PAX in Sweden completed in 
August 2013 
 > Organic revenue growth was helped by an increase in new 
build residential systems sales in the UK, where the Group 
enjoyed an 1 1.2% growth
 > Integration of inVENTer (acquired in April 2014) 
progressing, in line with the anticipated timetable 
 > The Group is enjoying strong demand for its products, 
especially newer, higher value added ventilation systems
 > OEM (Torin‑ Sifan) had a challenging year with lower sales 
of boiler spares 
 > The Group’s reported loss before tax was impacted by 
exceptional costs (including IPO costs), re‑ financing costs, 
costs of acquisitions and higher finance costs under 
previous ownership
 > Net debt reduced by £129.8 million mainly as a result 
of the conversion of investor debt to equity and the 
repayment of some bank debt from the proceeds 
of the new shares issued

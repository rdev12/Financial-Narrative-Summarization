Dividend 
On announcing the rights issue in September 2009, the directors 
stated they would take into account the effect of the rights issue in 
implementing a progressive dividend policy over the medium term. 
Having carefully considered the Group’s performance during the  
past year and the progress it has made towards delivering the 
objectives outlined at the time of the rights issue, the directors  
are recommending a final dividend of 9.2 pence per share which, 
subject to approval at the AGM, will be payable on 12 November  
to shareholders on the register on 8 October 2010. With the interim 
dividend of 3.3 pence per ordinary share paid in April, this will result 
in a total dividend of 12.5 pence per 50 pence ordinary share. This  
is a 15% increase on the total dividend of 10.9 pence declared last 
year, which has been restated to take account of the share 
consolidation and rights issue.
People 
The working lives of our employees have not been easy during the 
past year and they have faced many challenges, wherever in our 
businesses they work. The board is immensely grateful for the way  
in which they have responded and continued to demonstrate the 
excellence of our teamwork. Thank you to all of them.
Looking forward
The board has set out a clear strategy. We have recognised changes 
in our markets and implemented a plan to deliver growth in shareholder 
value. Despite current economic uncertainties, we remain on target 
with our transformational housebuilding expansion plan, and are 
maintaining an industry leading construction business, able to grow 
again when markets improve.

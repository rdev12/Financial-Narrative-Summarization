Chief Executive’s review
I was delighted to join Phytopharm in July 2010. 
The Company has an exciting product pipeline 
with the potential to make a significant impact 
in the treatment of diseases that presently 
have limited therapeutic options. Since joining 
I have been working with the Board and the 
Phytopharm team to put in place the plans to 
turn that potential into reality. We now have a 
number of programmes underway which will 
deliver key development milestones in the next 
two years. If results from these studies 
continue to be positive, the Company will be in 
a good position to further exploit and increase 
the value of our products in partnership with 
larger pharmaceutical companies and generate 
value for shareholders.
Good progress has been made with our lead 
programme, Cogane™, in Parkinson’s disease. 
In 2009 the Company received data from a 
key non-clinical study which underlined the 
product’s potential and has generated much 
interest and excitement amongst leading 
scientists, neurologists and patient groups in 
the Parkinson’s disease community. If this result 
is replicated in clinical trials, it will provide a 
major breakthrough in the treatment of this 
condition. Since then we have completed 
a Phase I safety study in healthy volunteers 
and patients and have initiated a large, dose 
ranging Phase II study in patients with early 
stage Parkinson’s disease. The study is being 
conducted at leading neurology centres in 
North America and Europe. We are making a 
significant investment into this study to ensure 
that Cogane™ is evaluated against study 
endpoints which fulfil regulatory obligations 
as well as demonstrating medically and 
commercially meaningful results. This study 
will take two years to complete, with results 
due by the end of 2012. If successful, it will 
allow the project to be rapidly progressed 
into registration studies either by 
Phytopharm or in partnership with 
a larger pharmaceutical company.
Cogane™, and its structurally related compound 
Myogane™, have demonstrated neuroprotective 
and neurorestorative properties in a range of 
cell types and industry-standard in vivo models.

Chief Executive’s review continued
This leads us to believe that these compounds 
have potential utility in a number of 
neurodegenerative conditions in addition to 
Parkinson’s disease. We have recently initiated 
studies in glaucoma, a degenerative eye 
condition and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the 
most common form of motor neurone disease. 
Both programmes will evaluate the efficacy 
of our products in key in vivo models of these 
conditions. As both Cogane™ and Myogane™ 
have completed required preclinical safety 
studies and clinical Phase I clinical safety 
studies, rapid progression to clinical Phase II 
efficacy studies in these indications will be 
possible if the preclinical results are positive. 
Neurodegeneration is an attractive target 
for pharmaceutical treatment and many 
approaches to tackling this process, which 
is fundamental to many diseases, are being 
developed, including gene therapy and stem 
cell therapy. The fact that Cogane™ and 
Myogane™ are small molecule therapies, 
suitable for once-daily oral dosing with the 
potential to induce the production of innate 
neurotrophic factors, makes them particularly 
attractive. Small molecule treatments have 
a well described regulatory development 
pathway and are relatively simple to produce 
and administer, producing attractive 
therapeutic and commercial options.
In addition to Cogane™ and Myogane™, we 
have re-activated a programme investigating 
a new class of compounds called P61. These 
early stage compounds have anti-inflammatory, 
anti-remodelling, anti-spasmodic and TRPv-1 
modulating activities. This range of activities 
point to potential utility in a number of 
inflammatory therapeutic categories, including 
respiratory diseases, dermatological conditions, 
gastro-intestinal disorders and pain. We will 
further evaluate these compounds over the 
coming year.
Over the past year we have re-focused 
the business onto the development of our 
pharmaceutical pipeline. Following the receipt 
of the promising results generated from 
Cogane™ and the subsequent fundraising, 
an evaluation of the Group’s assets concluded 
that there was a higher chance of generating 
“ We now have a number of programmes 
underway which will deliver key development 
milestones in the next two years.”
value for shareholders by investing all of our 
resources in our pharmaceutical assets. As a 
result, we have curtailed all expenditure of 
Phytopharm’s functional food products. With 
regard to Hoodia our weight loss food product 
previously licensed to Pfizer Inc and unilever, we 
have entered into a cooperation agreement with 
the CSIR. This is the South African Government 
sponsored body from whom Phytopharm 
originally licensed the patents supporting 
Hoodia development. The CSIR will evaluate 
the data generated by Phytopharm and its 
partners with an aim to further developing 
and commercialising weight loss products 
based on Hoodia. In return for transferring our 
intellectual property and know-how relating to 
Hoodia, Phytopharm will receive a share of any 
future commercial milestones and royalty on 
sales. Our canine atopic dermatitis product, 
Phytopica, has been promoted by Intervet/
Schering Plough Animal Health over the last 
few years. Sales have been disappointing and 
the agreement with Intervet/Schering Plough 
terminated at the end of December 2010. 
We are in discussions with other potential 
commercial partners for this product.

The building blocks are therefore in place 
to make significant progress over the coming 
period. Phytopharm has a three year cash 
runway and we will invest in our product pipeline 
to deliver key development milestones during 
this period. If successful, we are confident that 
our products will have demonstrated their 
potential to make a major impact, medically 
and commercially, in a number of therapeutic 
indications. We will continue to keep you 
informed of our progress. Finally I would like 
to thank our shareholders for their continued 
support of Phytopharm.

Significant progress in product pipeline development
A large dose ranging Phase II study in 
patients with early stage Parkinson’s disease 
has been initiated.
“ Cogane
TM
 and Myogane
TM
 have 
potential utility in a number of 
neurodegenerative diseases in 
addition to Parkinson’s disease.”
We are not planning to invest further in these 
functional food products and as a result we 
have downsized the Company and therefore 
a number of staff who had been working 
on these programmes have left us. We thank 
them for their help and support. The resulting 
savings will allow further investment in our 
pharmaceutical products.
When looking at the wider pharmaceutical 
industry environment we believe that there 
are good prospects if our assets continue to 
demonstrate encouraging results. Most major 
pharmaceutical companies are facing erosion 
of their product sales associated with patent 
expiries. Most are committed to replenishing 
their product pipeline by a mixture of in-house 
development and licensing/acquisition of 
products with proven efficacy.

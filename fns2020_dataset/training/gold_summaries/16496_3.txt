 04 ValiRx plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Chairman’s statement
“ I am pleased to
 report a solid
 performance by
 the Group”
I am pleased to report, for the first time 
as Chairman, a solid performance by the Group, 
with real progress seen on a number of important 
fronts during the period. Our key therapeutic 
and diagnostic development programmes 
continue to advance and the recent equity 
investment and divestment of shares in a 
US‑listed entity that we announced recently 
all combine to position the Company strongly 
as we move into a new financial year.
Operating expenses rose to £2,984,337 
(2012: £2,492,193) reflecting the Group’s 
increased investment in its research and 
development programmes, predominantly to 
take the lead drug candidate VAL201 to clinical 
trials and to a much lesser extent to advance 
our GeneICE products to the next stage of 
development. Revenues in the reporting period 
of £124,868 largely derived from our biomarkers 
division, ValiFinn. Research and development 
tax credits were £309,541 (2012: £165,956) 
and bank interest income was £5,552 
(2012: £19,001). Our net loss for the year 
increased to £2,597,238 (2012: £2,163,948), 
however, after adjustment to reflect a change 
in the fair value of available‑for‑sale assets, 
the loss for the year stood at £2,702,258 
(2012: £2,150,055). 
As at 31 December 2013 the Company 
had cash and cash equivalents of £960,267 
(2012: £2,260,783); however, post the 
period end, our cash position has increased 
substantially following the raising of equity 
finance and the divestment of shares in the 
US‑listed company VolitionRx, in January 
and February 2014 respectively. 
In terms of strategy and the appropriate 
positioning of the Company, it is good to 
see ValiRx steadily growing in stature and 
enhancing both the value and number of 
its development assets. I believe the Group 
is well placed to continue in this vein and 
towards those value inflection points that 
exist across its portfolio.
Looking forward, we now have a secure funding 
platform upon which we can consolidate the 
further development of VAL201, VAL101 and 
our biomarker portfolio and importantly, a 
platform from which we can advance VAL201 
through First in‑Human trials. I look forward 
to the Company updating shareholders on 
future developments.

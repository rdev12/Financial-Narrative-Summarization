Headlines
A challenging year in a rapidly changing global
economy, with renewed focus and a new strategic
approach towards generating growth and
improving return for shareholders.
Results in brief
2007 2006
£000 £000
Revenue 118,647 120,233
Operating profit before taxation and exceptional items* 3,381 7,007
Group (loss)/profit before taxation (9,956) 6,094
Cash generated from operating activities 4,684 2,702
Net debt 12,531 10,686
Gearing 24.8% 19.7%
(Loss)/earnings per 5p ordinary share (5.83p) 3.83p
Dividends paid per 5p ordinary share 5.40p 5.40p
* Exceptional items (note 3) are items of income and expenditure that, in the judgment of management, should be disclosed separately on the basis that they are material, either by their nature
or their size, to the understanding of the financial statements and where not to do so would distort the comparability of financial performance between periods. In 2007 the £12.2 million charge
comprised reorganisation costs, losses on long-term contracts, stock write-downs and property profits. In 2006 the £0.4 million charge consisted of reorganisation costs, property profits and a
discount on acquisition.
Operational
Housewares restructuring completed during the year
helped the Division’s operating margin grow from
4.8% to 7.1% and its return on net operating assets
increase to 10.7% from 6.6%.
Restructuring of the Board undertaken, with a new
Chief Executive appointed during the year. Post year-
end the team was further strengthened with the
appointment of a new Group Finance Director and a
new Non-Executive Director.
Changes to the Board have led to a change of
strategic focus already being implemented.
Financial
Despite the difficult year there was improved cash
generation from operating activities of £4.7 million,
up from £2.7 million.
Net debt is well under control at £12.5 million
representing gearing of 24.8%, only slightly up on last
year. This leaves substantial headroom within our
existing borrowing facilities.
Turnover broadly unchanged at £118.6 million.

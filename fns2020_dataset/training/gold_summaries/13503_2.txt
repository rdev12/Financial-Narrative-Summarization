OUR BUSINESS In what is an increasingly complex and  
ever-changing global recruitment market, 
the Group provides our clients, from the 
largest corporates through to SMEs and 
start ups, with an end-to-end recruitment 
offering on a global basis.
Our business is all about the development of long-term and 
high-quality relationships with our clients and candidates. The 
recruitment industry is unique in that we have two very distinct  
but over-lapping stakeholders – our candidates are our clients  
of the future and our clients are our potential candidates. 
Quality (in terms of relationships and service levels), integrity  
and professionalism are the Group’s watch-words and we  
believe provide a clear point of differentiation for the  
Robert Walters Group.

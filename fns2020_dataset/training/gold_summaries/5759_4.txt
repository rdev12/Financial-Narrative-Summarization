 Experian at a glance
Experian is an information services 
company.
We provide organisations and 
individuals with information and 
analysis to help them make the right 
decisions.
It may be a bank needing to decide 
the most appropriate credit limit for a 
new customer. Or a retailer wanting 
to choose the best location for a new 
store. Or a vehicle manufacturer 
looking for the best potential 
customers for its latest model. Or a 
government department needing to 
verify the identity of new claimants. Or 
a consumer wanting to protect their 
family from identity fraud.  
At the heart of our business lies a vast 
store of information, around which 
we have developed a unique range of 
analytical skills and software tools. It 
enables us to provide extraordinary 
insight into everyday decision making.
From our early focus on financial 
services, we now have clients in almost 
every major industry. We have also 
continued to expand geographically 
and today support clients in over 65 
countries.
Our products and services are 
grouped under four principal 
activities: 
Credit Services
Helping lenders to make timely and 
responsible credit-granting decisions, 
while making it easier and quicker for 
their own customers to obtain finance. 
Decision Analytics
Enabling lenders to assess the 
degree of risk associated with any 
particular course of action and to 
test and fine-tune different  lending 
strategies.
Marketing Services
Helping organisations to reach new 
customers and to expand existing 
relationships, using the most 
appropriate media and message. 
Interactive
Allowing consumers to monitor 
their personal credit files securely 
over the internet and to find the best 
deals on products and services.
Experian’s operational headquarters are in  
Costa Mesa, California (above) and Nottingham,

616 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2010 chairman’s statement 05
Against the backdrop of continuing economic 
uncertainty across the international markets  
in which we operate, I am pleased to report 
that the Group has produced another good  
set of results driven both organically and by 
acquisition, announcing nine acquisitions 
during the year. 
Group revenue increased 4% to £4,829.6 
million and operating profit before intangible 
amortisation and acquisition related costs also 
rose 4% to £306.7 million. Basic earnings per 
share were 49.1p, an increase of 6%, and 
adjusted earnings per share, after eliminating 
intangible amortisation and acquisition related 
costs, were up 8% to 60.6p. Currency 
translation movements increased Group 
growth rates by approximately 1%.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a 9% increase  
in the final dividend to 16.2p. This brings the 
total dividend for the year to 23.35p, an 8% 
increase. This year we have decided to 
reintroduce the dividend reinvestment plan to 
replace the existing scrip dividend alternative. 
Further information will be included with my 
letter to shareholders relating to the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Strategy
We continue to pursue our well defined 
strategy of developing the business through 
organic growth and targeted acquisitions in 
both existing and new geographies, while 
continuously improving the efficiency of  
our operations. 
Our organic growth is achieved by applying our 
resources and expertise to enable customers, 
by outsourcing to Bunzl, to reduce or eliminate 
the hidden costs of sourcing and distributing 
numerous goods not for resale, thereby allowing 
them to focus on their core business more cost 
effectively and with lower working capital. 
In 2010 we saw a resumption of acquisition 
activity that took us further into some of our 
key markets in the US, Denmark, Benelux, 
Spain and Brazil while substantially increasing 
the size of our business in Switzerland and 
extending our operations into Israel.
Increasingly coordinating our procurement 
internationally and continually refining and 
deepening our commitment to our customers 
and markets, while looking to extend our 
business into new geographies, remain 
important elements of our strategy. Having 
pursued this strategy consistently over many 
years, we have built leading positions in a 
variety of market sectors across the Americas, 
Europe and Australasia.
Investment
We have over time steadily invested to  
support our growth strategy, thereby 
enhancing the infrastructure of the Group.  
We are continuously improving and upgrading 
our IT systems and warehouse facilities as we 
integrate new businesses into the Group, in 
addition to increasing our functionality and 
efficiency in order to improve customer 
service. By doing so we retain the competitive 
advantage which helps us maintain our 
leadership in the market place.
Corporate responsibility
As a responsible company, we realise that 
Bunzl is only sustainable if we maintain 
profitability through business practices which 
positively impact stakeholders, whether 
customers, employees or suppliers. Much  
has changed in the area of Corporate  
Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) since we first 
developed our policies in 2004. During 2010 
we reviewed our approach to CSR issues, 
seeking input from both consultants and 
shareholders. We confirmed that our 
management practices relating to business 
conduct, employees and health and safety, 
environment and community matters, as  
well as our approach to our customers and 
suppliers, remained appropriate. Business 
integrity together with committed, well trained 
employees working in a safe environment with 
an emphasis on reducing our environmental 
impact, contributing to the communities in 
which we operate, encouraging our suppliers  
to adopt a similar ethos to us and helping  
our customers to meet their CSR goals, 
particularly those relating to sustainability,  
are all intrinsic to our everyday business.  
We have therefore decided to adopt the  
term Corporate Responsibility going forward 
rather than CSR to reflect that these policies 
are part of the way Bunzl operates. We have 
also modified our policies to make them more 
concise, clearer and better tailored to Bunzl’s 
specific challenges. 
Employees
Many companies comment that their 
employees are their biggest asset but,  
as Bunzl is not capital intensive, this is 
particularly true for us. During 2010 our 
people have continued to show their 
commitment and dedication to serve our 
customers. We have had numerous examples 
of our employees battling against adverse 
weather conditions in various parts of the 
world to get into work and maintain customer 
service and deliveries. Their efforts and 
dedication are, as always, greatly appreciated.
Credit facilities
The Group remains highly cash generative  
and we continue to have access to diverse 
sources of funding to achieve our strategic 
objectives. In 2010 our net cash inflow was 
£10 million despite cash expenditure of  
£111 million on acquisitions and we agreed to 
raise a further £95 million (sterling equivalent) 
from the US private placement market, with 
maturities ranging from seven to 12 years,  
of which £20 million was drawn in December 
2010 with the balance due to be drawn in  
April 2011. We also renewed some £164 million 
of our banking facilities during the year. Our 
undrawn committed facilities’ headroom at the 
end of the year was £557 million. 
Board
Jeff Harris retired from the Board on  
28 February 2010. A non-executive director 
for more than nine years, during his time  
with us Jeff served as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, Senior Independent Director and, 
most recently, as Interim Chairman following 
Anthony Habgood’s retirement in 2009. We 
thank Jeff for his guidance and wise counsel 
over many years. I was appointed to the Board 
as Chairman designate on 1 January 2010  
and became Chairman on 1 March 2010 and  
Peter Johnson, who has been a non-executive 
director since January 2006, was appointed  
as Senior Independent Director in April 2010.
Charles Banks, who has served as a non-
executive director for almost nine years, latterly 
as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, 
will be retiring after our Annual General 
Meeting in April. His independent advice and 
significant contribution to our success have 
been greatly appreciated and he leaves the 
Board with our thanks and best wishes. We 
are currently undertaking a search for a new 
non-executive director and will make a further 
announcement in due course.

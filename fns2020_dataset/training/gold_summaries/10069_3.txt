I am pleased to report Melrose’s tenth set of annual results since 
ﬂotation in 2003. 
This has been a busy and successful year for your Company. On 23 
August we completed the acquisition of Elster Group S.E. (“Elster”) for 
an enterprise value of £1.8 billion. The acquisition was ﬁnanced by a 
£1.2 billion Rights Issue and a new £1.5 billion ﬁve year banking facility.
Elster is a world leader in metering products with special strength in 
gas meters. It has nearly 7,000 employees in more than 30 countries 
and turnover in the four months of our ownership in 2012 was £411.1 
million. It is described in more detail in the Chief Executive’s review.
It is still early in the integration process but we are already very  
pleased with the business and the potential for improvement over the 
next few years.
Shareholders’ investment in Melrose, net of dividends and returns of 
capital since 2003, amounts to approximately £1.1 billion. Our market 
capitalisation, at the current share price, amounts to £3.3 billion, 
meaning that over £2 billion of value has been created over this period. 
We continue to work hard to maintain this successful track record. Our 
employees throughout the Group are to be thanked for their contribution 
to this.
RESULTS FOR THE GROUP
These ﬁnancial statements report the results for the Group for the year 
to 31 December 2012 and comparatives for the previous year. The 
results for Elster have been included from 23 August 2012.
Revenue from continuing businesses for the year was £1,551.4 million 
(2011: £1,080.4 million) and headline proﬁt before tax (before exceptional 
costs, exceptional income and intangible asset amortisation) was £214.3 
million (2011: £154.7 million). Headline diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) 
on continuing and discontinued businesses was 16.3p (2011: 16.4p). 
Adjusting for the disposal of MPC, headline diluted EPS was 16.1p

(2011: 15.8p) an increase of 2%. Diluted EPS (before exceptional costs, 
exceptional income and intangible asset amortisation) on continuing 
businesses was 4.3p (2011: 12.9p). 
Further details of these results are contained in the Finance Director’s 
review.
DIVIDENDS
The Board intends to pay a ﬁnal dividend of 5.0p per share (2011: 4.8p), 
which represents a 4% increase. This will be paid on 13 May 2013 to 
those shareholders on the register at 19 April 2013, subject to approval 
at the AGM on 8 May 2013. This gives a total for the year of 7.6p per 
share (2011: 7.4p).
These numbers and the comparatives have been affected by the Rights 
Issue referred to above and adjusted accordingly.
Your Board continues to pursue a progressive dividend policy.
TRADING
2012 was another excellent year for our businesses with headline 
operating proﬁt increases in all three divisions of existing Melrose. Group 
headline operating margins at 15.7% suffered only a small decline even 
allowing for the inclusion of Elster, whose margins at this stage are lower 
than average for the Group. Without the effect of Elster, Group operating 
margins in 2012 increased again.
We continue to see excellent opportunities for investing in our 
businesses and in 2012 capital expenditure increased again to over 
twice depreciation within the three divisions of existing Melrose. 2013 is 
likely to be another year of high investment. Net debt, after the additional 
debt taken on for Elster, was £997.7 million at 31 December 2012. 
Working capital management and cash generation remain a major focus 
for Melrose and 2012 was another year of good performance.
Further details on trading are included in the Chief Executive’s review.
STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
I said last year that we were optimistic about identifying a suitable 
acquisition to continue the excellent growth of the Group. We ﬁrmly 
believe that Elster represents such an opportunity. In addition to these 
occasional acquisitions, however, our strategy also comprises selling 
existing businesses, at the appropriate time, when we believe we have 
achieved the bulk of improvement in performance, with subsequent 
related returns of capital. We are naturally fully focused on improving 
the performance of Elster at present but this will not deﬂect us from this 
other equally important part of our strategy.
We signalled in our Interim Management Statement in November that 
order books in certain of our businesses, principally the Energy division, 
had weakened somewhat. Although this continues to be the case we are 
conﬁdent of the outlook and therefore we expect further progress in 2013.
Economic recovery is not yet in sight in Europe, nor completely 
established in the US, but our mix of businesses with their strong 
positions in good end markets and opportunities for improvement gives 
us conﬁdence for the future.

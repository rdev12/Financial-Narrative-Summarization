Chairman’s statement
Christopher Winn
Chairman
Sanderson Group plc is a software and IT 
services business specialising in multi-
channel retail and manufacturing markets 
in the UK and Ireland.
Financial results
The trading results for the year ended 
30 September 2015 are in line with 
market expectations and show Group 
revenue growing to £19.18 million 
(2014: £16.41 million) and adjusted 
operating profit (stated before the 
amortisation of acquisition-related 
intangibles, share-based payment charges 
and acquisition-related and restructuring 
costs) growing to £3.30 million 
(2014: £2.84 million), an increase of 16%.
Overall, gross margin has been maintained 
at 85% (2014: 85%), reflecting a 
continuing emphasis on the supply of 
Sanderson proprietary software and 
services. The Group’s order book remains 
strong and at the year-end stood at a 
robust £2.35 million (2014: £2.41 million).
The Group’s cash generative business 
model has enabled Sanderson to invest 
in excess of £3 million during the year to 
further develop the Group’s operations, 
including £1.9 million of consideration 
and deferred consideration payments in 
respect of acquired businesses. Following 
this investment, at 30 September 2015, 
Sanderson reported a cash balance of 
£4.61 million (2014: £6.16 million).
Dividend
This strong cash generation has enabled 
the Board to maintain a progressive 
dividend policy whilst continuing to invest 
in and to develop the Group’s businesses. 
Subject to the approval of shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting, scheduled 
to be held on 3 March 2016, the Board 
is proposing a final dividend of 1.2 pence 
per ordinary share, making a total of 
2.1 pence for the year. This represents 
a 17% increase compared with the total 
dividend of 1.80 pence in 2014. The 
final dividend, if approved, will be paid 
on 18 March 2016 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 
4 March 2016.
Strategy
The strategy of the Board is to achieve 
sustained growth by further building and 
developing the Sanderson businesses 
operating within the multi-channel retail 
and manufacturing target markets. The 
digital retail opportunity, in particular, 
provides exposure to a market sector 
which is experiencing rapid growth. Whilst 
the Group will continue to invest across 
all of its businesses, particular emphasis 
will be placed on further developing the 
range of solutions for our fast growing 
digital retail businesses, for the food and 
drink processing sector and for entry level 
systems in the manufacturing division. 
Mobile solutions continue to be developed 
across all of the Group’s target markets.
To augment organic growth, selective 
acquisition opportunities will continue to 
be considered. 
The trading results 
are in line with market 
expectations and show 
Group revenue growing 
to £19.18 million and 
adjusted operating profit* 
growing to £3.30 million, 
an increase of 16%

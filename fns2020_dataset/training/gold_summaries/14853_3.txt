Chairman’s Statement
Progress
I am pleased to report that your 
Company continued to make further 
steady progress throughout 2003 
achieving both its main objectives of 
generating cash and operating proﬁts, 
whilst increasing turnover by 17% to 
£8.4 million.
We have increased our annualised 
recurring revenues by 15% to £7.9 
million whilst professional services 
revenues increased by 29% to £1.2 
million.
Transfer to the Alternative
Investment Market (“AIM”)
On 16
th
 June 2003, your Company’s 
listing was transferred to the Alternative 
Investment Market of the London 
Stock Exchange (“AIM”) from the 
Ofﬁcial List of the UK Listing Authority. 
The directors believe this move has 
allowed, and will continue to allow, the 
Company to take advantage of the 
greater degree of ﬂexibility afforded 
by AIM in implementing its strategy 
of acquiring additional products.
Acquisitions
In October 2003, we purchased a 
majority stake (with an option to buy the 
remaining shares) in an Italian ﬁnancial 
software development company with 
complementary risk management and 
portfolio insurance products.
We anticipate interest in these products 
both from our existing client base 
and from prospective asset managers 
globally as they seek to improve their 
portfolio performance reporting and 
risk analysis capabilities.
People 
I continue to be impressed by the 
commitment of StatPro’s employees to 
meet the objectives of our clients and 
would like to congratulate them on their 
continued efforts throughout 2003.
Prospects
Whilst asset managers continue to 
be cautious about initiating new IT 
projects we are beginning to see the 
welcome signs of increased activity 
and remain in a good position to take 
advantage of any upturn.

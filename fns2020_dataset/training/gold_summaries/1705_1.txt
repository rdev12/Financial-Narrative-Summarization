Chief Executive Officer’s Review of Operations
Hamish Grant
Chief Executive Officer
During 2005 the Company 
concentrated on continuing entry into 
the automotive control and diagnostics 
market with its Vindax technology.  
The primary areas of focus were 
building relationships with chip 
manufacturers who supply the 
automotive market and conducting 
proof of concept evaluations with 
key automotive manufacturers to 
demonstrate the benefits of Vindax 
technology. The Company also 
invested heavily in continued product 
development and intellectual property 
protection.
Building a presence in the  
automotive market
We made significant progress in 
this market sector during the year. 
We entered into a joint marketing 
agreement with a major US automotive 
chip manufacturer to work together  
on joint sales presentations to potential 
customers. Of equal significance,  
we have been able to demonstrate  
the Vindax processor working with 
other established chips that are  
already widely used in the industry.  
We demonstrated how our technology 
integrates with both Infineon based 
and Freescale based devices at two 
major international industry events in 
Detroit held towards the end of 2005.
During 2005, the work with automotive 
manufacturers has focused on practical 
proof of concept evaluations and 
the delivery of additional products 
to enable the customers to carry 
out in-car real-time evaluations 
and prototyping of pre-production 
solutions. 
The automotive industry is highly 
secretive and all evaluations are 
covered by non-disclosure agreements 
so we are not able to name specific 
customers and applications. However 
successful proof of concept studies 
were undertaken in the areas of 
misfire detection, control parameter 
estimation and vehicle weight 
estimation. These projects were all 
conducted with major automotive 
manufacturers, Tier 1 suppliers and 
specialist race teams in the US and 
Europe. One of these programmes  
has already resulted in the award  
of our first pre-production 
implementation contract with  
a major European automotive 
manufacturer, with a possible 
production implementation in 2007. 
The other exciting project concluded 
during 2005 was an evaluation for  
ITI Energy of Vindax technology as 
an enabling solution for an advanced 
battery management system for Li-ion 
battery cells. The preliminary project 
was completed successfully and ITI 
Energy has now signed a contract 
to develop a pre-production Li-ion 
battery management system during 
2006. The co-operative work with 
Advanced Batteries on this project 
led to the management teams of the 
two companies identifying potential 
business synergies which in turn led 
to our acquisition of Axeon Power in 
March 2006.
During 2005 the Company focused  
on continuing entry into the automotive 
control and diagnostics market with  
its Vindax technology.  Axeon’s Vindax Technology
Axeon’s Vindax products are designed 
to provide elegant, cost-effective 
solutions to problems involving 
complex, non-linear systems data.
Vindax products include the uniquely 
powerful Vindax processor architecture 
implemented as a fully synthesisable 
intellectual property (IP) core, and the 
Vindax Development System, the key 
tool in the investigation of complex 
problems and the application of 
Vindax technology to their solutions. 
The Vindax Development System plays 
a fundamental part in developing a 
solution.
Vindax learns by example. A Vindax 
processor or IP core is trained using 
representative samples of data, and 
forms its own internal representation of 
the data relationships. The processor 
can then recognise classes of input 
data and classify the data accordingly.
Vindax performs extremely well as 
a function approximator, as it can 
be trained to ‘learn’ a function (for 
example, the transfer function of the 
actuator in the field of active valve 
control).
A single use of the Vindax architecture 
may perform several complex and 
diverse functions through real-time 
multi-tasking.
The wide range of benefits provided 
by Vindax technology include:
Reduced time to market
By using Vindax, the time-consuming 
and costly process of algorithmic 
development to find a procedural 
solution is eliminated. Solution 
development is greatly simplified, 
accelerating time to market.
Performance
The Vindax microprocessor architecture 
offers unique levels of performance, 
achieving extremely low training and 
classification times. These are achieved 
using minimal silicon area and with  
low power consumption. Vindax offers  
considerable performance advantages  
over, for example, software 
implementations of machine learning 
techniques.
Compatibility with existing 
architectures
Vindax IP Cores are readily integrated 
with existing processing architectures 
such as RISC and DSP, allowing easy 
integration into a customer’s  
System-on-Chip design.
No complex development 
environments
The use of Axeon’s patented Learning 
Algorithms within Vindax products 
means that there is no requirement for 
complex development environments 
and compilers.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review of Operations – continued
In April 2006, we signed an agreement 
with Modec, the developers of a new 
zero emission city van, to become 
the exclusive supplier of its battery 
management systems and battery 
cassettes. Production is due to start 
in the final quarter of 2006, with a 
requirement for up to 50 battery 
packs by the end of the year and a 
production target of 800 packs in 2007.
Staying at the forefront of technology 
development
We also announced our new VX1064 
processor core at one of the major 
industry shows in September 2005. 
This development puts us at the 
forefront of market innovation, 
introducing a processor that will run 
a number of applications in parallel. 
Our first implementation of the new 
processor is in a field programmable 
gate array (FPGA), a device similar to a 
chip but lower in cost and complexity. 
The device chosen, an Altera Stratix-
II FPGA, is an ideal platform for 
prototyping of future engine control 
unit architectures and provision of 
real-time implementations of Vindax-
based solutions. The performance 
of the Altera implementation is 100 
times faster than current software 
implementations and allows the 
new processor to address multiple 
applications simultaneously.
In addition, we released two additional 
product development tools to 
complement the Vindax Development 
System (VDS): the Simulink Vindax 
Classifier S-Function and dSPACE 
AutoBox support. 
With the existing VDS tool, users can 
rapidly study and produce offline 
solutions for complex automotive 
and industrial control and diagnostics 
applications. Our customers wanted 
to be able to migrate these solutions 
into real-time embedded systems 
more easily. The Vindax dSPACE 
AutoBox support addresses this 
need. This product extension enables 
automotive customers to take a 
prototype function, developed offline 
in the VDS and modelled in Simulink, 
into the real-time environment in test 
vehicles and test cells. This integration 
makes it easier for customers to 
implement Vindax solutions in their 
pre-production test facilities.
Building our intellectual property
The Company maintains an active 
policy of identifying, reviewing and 
protecting its intellectual property. 
During 2005 the company filed 3 
patents in areas relating to its core 
technology and applications. During 
the second half of 2005, two patents 
were granted, European Patent 
number 1149359 “Neural Processing 
Element for use in a Neural Network”, 
and US Patent number 6,971,345 
“Control of a Mechanical Actuator 
using a Modular Map Processor”. 
These are the first patents to be 
granted on the technology of the 
Company and represent a fundamental 
barrier to competition.
The Company 
maintains an active 
policy of identifying, 
reviewing and 
protecting its 
intellectual property. 
During 2005 the 
company filed three 
patents in areas 
relating to its core 
technology and 
applications.  There is growing public awareness 
and political will to see reductions in 
CO
2
 emissions. Chart 1 shows how 
rapidly increasing atmospheric CO
2
 
concentrations correlate to rapidly 
rising global temperatures over the  
last one hundred years.
At the same time demand for oil 
continues to increase against a 
background of limitations to supply 
and reserves. Oil prices have risen 
from around US$25/barrel in 2003 to 
around US$75/barrel in 2006 and as 
demonstrated by the US Government 
forecast (chart 2) are expected to 
continue to rise. 
Our belief is that innovation can be used 
to materially reduce automotive CO
2
 
emissions and fuel usage by increasing 
the effective fuel efficiency of vehicles 
whilst at the same time making those 
vehicles better to drive, more reliable 
and cheaper to drive.
More fuel efficiency in conventional 
internal combustion engines involves 
better control over the combustion 
process in each cylinder of the engine. 
This plays to the strengths of our 
Vindax technology which can be used 
to provide the multi-application real-
time advanced control and diagnostics 
necessary to do this.
CO
2
 emissions reductions can also 
be achieved by switching to electric 
delivery vehicles in large metropolitan 
cities and hybrid electric buses, trucks, 
vans and cars elsewhere. 
All electric vehicles, hybrids and future 
fuel cell vehicles need a battery pack. 
Historically, battery technology has not 
allowed storage of enough power for 
automotive use whilst simultaneously 
remaining sufficiently small, cheap and 
durable to be cost effective.
Lithium-ion batteries provide four times 
the energy storage capacity of lead acid 
and twice the capacity of nickel metal 
hydride batteries (currently used in most 
hybrid cars). They represent the best 
battery option for the future. However 
Li-ion batteries degrade over time 
unless carefully controlled and to date 
have not been able to provide the three 
to five years assurance necessary for 
automotive use.
The advanced control and diagnostics 
capability of Vindax can be used to 
extend the life of large automotive scale 
Li-ion battery packs. We are coupling 
this capability with the expertise of the 
Axeon Power team in battery design, 
battery sourcing and package assembly 
to develop Li-ion battery management 
controllers for automotive and Li-ion 
battery packs for electric and hybrid 
vehicles. 
Our passion is to use our innovation to 
enable better, cheaper, more reliable 
and most importantly more fuel efficient 
vehicles in the automotive market. In 
so doing we believe we can create 
significant shareholder value.

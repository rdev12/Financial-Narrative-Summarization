Grainger Trust plc 
2003
During 2003, Grainger Trust more than doubled the size of its
asset base by completing an acquisition that began in 2001. 
It has enabled us to extend our specialist capabilities in
managing a large-scale tenanted residential portfolio and
opened up opportunities to develop our life tenancy business.
In parallel, we have continued to make progress in our
development and trading activities.

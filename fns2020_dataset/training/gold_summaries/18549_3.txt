 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 2
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The London property market 
remains very attractive and 
Foxtons continues to make 
excellent progress with its 
organic growth strategy.
Overview
Revenue grew across all business streams enabling  
the Group to report record revenues. In the sales 
market we saw falling volumes in central London, 
where price and Stamp Duty pressures have deterred 
buyers, more than offset by more active markets in 
outer London where the Group has been focusing 
recent expansion. Adjusted EBITDA is the key metric 
by which we measure performance, achieving  
£46.0 million (2014: £46.2 million) with margins  
in excess of 30%. Profit before tax was £41.0 million 
(2014: £42.1 million). The Company continued its 
growth across London by opening seven new branches, 
bringing the total network to 58. Cash generation 
remains strong, enabling the Company to propose  
an increase in full year dividends of 13.4%. In addition 
the Company commenced a share buy-back 
programme at year end.
Board and governance
The Board places significant importance on corporate 
governance and compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Full details are set out in the 
Corporate Governance section of our Annual Report 
and Accounts.
Dividend and share buy-back
The Group’s dividend policy is to pay between  
35% and 40% of profit after tax as ordinary dividends 
with the potential for special dividends to return 
excess cash to Shareholders. During 2015 an interim 
dividend of 1.67p per share plus a special dividend  
of 3.10p per share was paid in September 2015.  
The Board is proposing a final dividend for 2015  
of 3.34p per share plus a further special dividend of  
2.89p per share, bringing the total for the full year to 
11.0p per share, £30.8 million in total. The proposed 
dividends will, subject to Shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 18 May 2016, be 
paid on 26 May 2016 to Shareholders on the register 
at 29 April 2016. Since its IPO in September 2013,  
the Company will have returned £73.5 million of 
dividends to Shareholders inclusive of the above 
dividend proposal.
In addition to paying the expected dividend, the 
Company commenced a share buy-back programme 
on 16 December 2015, to make on-market purchases 
of Foxtons ordinary shares in line with the Company’s 
policy of returning excess cash to Shareholders, and 
the programme has continued into 2016. As at  
7 March 2016, the Company had purchased and 
cancelled in total 7 million ordinary shares at a  
cost of £12 million.
Summary
The attractive fundamentals of the London property 
market remains strong. Our strategy continues to be 
the delivery of profitable growth through targeted 
organic expansion. The Group has continued to 
perform well, taking into consideration the slow 
recovery of the London market since the General 
Election. The Group has a dynamic and dedicated 
team of people, all determined to build further on our 
success. I would like to take this opportunity on behalf 
of the Board to thank everyone at Foxtons for their 
commitment and hard work. With their continued 
support we can look forward with confidence  
to the future.

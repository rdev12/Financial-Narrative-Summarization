 Overview
The financial year ended 30 April
2008 was a period of substantial
and positive change and
development for the Group. By the
end of April we had almost doubled
in size, following two key acquisitions
and taken an important first step
into continental Europe. 
For several months either side of
the year end, the Group was in an
offer period after an unsolicited
approach. Despite the distraction of
the approach, we made excellent
progress in integrating the newly
acquired businesses and have also
restructured the Group along market
sector lines to provide additional
focus and to eliminate internal
overlap. The Group is now well
positioned with diverse product
offerings despite the difficult market
conditions faced in selected
verticals.
Financial performance
Revenues for the year were £22.5
million (2007: £16.1 million).
Excluding the impact of the two
acquisitions, revenues increased by
10%, a credible result given the
decline in demand from financial
services clients highlighted in our
April trading statement. Adjusted
profit before tax increased to £3.6
million (2007: £3.3 million),
excluding the impact of share-based
payment charges, amortisation of
acquisition related intangible assets
and exceptional costs associated
with the offers received for the
Group earlier in the year. 
Offer period
The Board and the executive team
were inevitably distracted and their
achievements overshadowed from
February for five months by an
unsolicited proposal which the Board
viewed as unacceptable. However,
the initial approach triggered interest
from the private equity sector. The
Board decided to allow the Group’s
two principal executives, Mark Smith
and Craig Dixon, to co-operate with
one private equity house to see if an
acceptable MBO offer could be put
together. That process fell victim to
the severe contraction in the debt
market.
We all believe the Group has a
strong and exciting future and
shareholders can be assured that
the entire Board and management
are working closely together to
realise the Company’s potential.
Acquisitions
We welcomed to the Group two
exciting new businesses, Internet
Business Group plc (IBG) in February
2008 and TAPPS B.V. (TAPPS) one
month earlier. In very different ways
they offer exciting opportunities for
the future. 
IBG made us a major player in the
UK’s affiliate marketing sector
through AffiliateFuture. This
substantially enlarged the Group’s
portfolio, bringing new customers
plus further advantages for our
existing clients. 
The significance of TAPPS, a
business more closely allied to
existing Group activities, is
geographical and takes us firmly into
continental Europe where we will be
applying much of our future focus.
The result of our organic growth
coupled with these acquisitions is
that the Group’s revenue run-rate at
the end of the financial year is
roughly double what it was at the
start. I believe it is interesting to
note if we compare all the UK’s
thousand or more AIM listed

People
There were changes on the Board
during the year. This is my first
Chairman’s statement since
replacing Warren Tayler in December.
Warren played an important part in
the Group’s development, guiding the
company from a relatively modest
start, through the initial acquisitions
which laid the foundations of today’s
successful Group. I would like to
express thanks on behalf of myself
and his former colleagues to Warren
and also long-serving non-executive
director Harold Gittelmon who also
retired from the Board.
We have welcomed some
excellent new managers and staff
during the year, particularly via the
acquisitions. We have an impressive
and dedicated team and I would like
to thank our staff, executives, Board
colleagues, advisers and
shareholders for their support and
contribution in the past year.

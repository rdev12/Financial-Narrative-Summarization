 10 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 201 1
Business review
Chief Executive’s review
2011 was a year to remember 
for Polymetal. Our listing on  
the London Stock Exchange  
in November and achieving 
record production volumes 
represent milestones of which 
we are particularly proud.
Record production levels
In 2011, we produced a record  
810 Koz of gold equivalent ounces
1
. 
This was achieved despite some 
grade decline at mature operations, 
which was more than offset by 
production from new operations  
and the successful expansion  
of existing mines. 
Annual gold production was essentially 
flat at 443 Koz, with a further 28 Koz  
of payable gold contained in Albazino 
concentrate prepared for processing  
at the Amursk POX plant. Silver 
production increased by 15% to  
19.9 Moz, a record for Polymetal. 
Copper production was 6.9 Kt, 
up 73% on 2010. 
The early months of the year were 
particularly challenging, with various 
issues relating to grade quality and 
production processes resulting in an 
initial operational underperformance. 
However as these issues were 
resolved, the business subsequently 
performed well, and we achieved our 
revised targets – reaching a run-rate 
of 1 Moz annual production in the last 
quarter of 201 1. This was supported  
in particular by the full ramp-up of the 
Albazino plant and stabilisation of 
grades at our Dukat hub.
As a result, we are now firmly on 
track to deliver on our target of  
1.4 Moz gold equivalent production 
per annum by the end of 2014. 
Strong financial performance
201 1 was a very successful year for 
the Company. The increase in gold 
equivalent production and the growth 
in metal prices during the year 
pushed the revenues up 43% to a 
record US$1,326 million. While cost 
pressures in Russia and in the mining 
industry in general remained high,  
we nevertheless believe we have  
been successful in managing our 
cash costs. Our cash costs were  
at US$701 per gold equivalent  
ounce, up 26% as a result of some 
operational challenges and low 
volumes due to the ramp-up of 
significant new operations at Albazino, 
and further influenced by Russia’s 
domestic inflation and the Rouble 
strengthening against the US Dollar.
Adjusted EBITDA, which is a key 
metric of our core cash earnings, 
increased by 47% to US$624 million, 
in line with revenue growth, and the 
adjusted EBITDA margin increased  
to 47%. Bottom-line net earnings 
were up 21%, driven by EBITDA 
growth, growth in non-cash 
expenses, and change in the 
effective tax rate.
As a result of the cash raised at IPO 
and robust growth in operating cash

flows, we have significantly reduced 
leverage to 1.41 net debt/adjusted 
EBITDA, with the majority of debt 
(65%) being long-term. Both these 
factors give us and our investors 
comfort as to the Company’s liquidity 
and funding. 
Robust project delivery 
I am very pleased to report that all our 
key projects are now progressing to 
plan and schedule. The Amursk POX 
facility was completed in December 
and has entered the commissioning 
stage. In 2012 it will start processing 
refractory concentrates from Albazino, 
and in 2013-14 will reach design 
capacity with the inclusion of 
concentrate from the Mayskoye mine. 
Much development and construction 
work has been completed at 
Mayskoye, our most remote mine,  
with mills installed and the power 
substation nearing completion. 
Underground development has 
reached a steady rate of 1,100 m  
per month. 
The Merrill-Crowe circuit was 
successfully commissioned at the 
Kubaka plant (Omolon hub), and  
is ready to commence full scale 
processing of high grade Sopka ore. 
Commitment to safety and 
responsible development
During the year we continued to 
demonstrate a strong commitment  
to responsible corporate citizenship. 
We have maintained high 
environmental standards both at 
existing and new operations. We 
have also continued to provide 
meaningful support to local 
communities wherever we operate.
I would also like to highlight a marked 
improvement in safety at work last 
year. We had no fatalities, and our 
lost time injury frequency rate was 
63% lower than in 2010. This very 
successful outcome was achieved  
as a result of great efforts throughout 
our operations to improve safety 
policies and working practices. 
These new policies have been  
strictly implemented to ensure full 
compliance across all locations, and 
are supported by extensive training 
and relevant incentive arrangements.
Looking ahead
Our teams are firmly focused on 
delivering further growth in 2012.  
This will be driven by the start-up  
of the Amursk POX facility and the 
achievement of full production 
capacity at Omolon. 
In the year ahead we expect to 
produce 590-640 Koz of gold, 21-23 
Moz of silver and 6-7 Kt of copper. 
We aim to increase our total annual 
gold equivalent production to over  
1 Moz in the coming year and to  
1.4 Moz by 2014.
We continue to focus on operational 
excellence, commitment to our 
strategic objectives and proven 
business model. With our talented  
and dedicated workforce, I am 
confident that we will continue to 
deliver sustainable value as we 
continue to grow.

A secure demand
The global demand for gold  
is secure and dynamic. 
 
Key categories include:
Investment
Gold will always play a vital role in  
any long-term savings or investment 
portfolios. It is a foundation asset 
offering a hedge against currency 
and asset price volatility.
Jewellery
Jewellery accounts for over 50%  
of the market for gold. Growing 
affluence in the major markets of 
India and China will continue to 
drive demand for gold jewellery,  
not just a decorative item but  
also as a key component of 
household savings.
Central banks and  
government agencies
Gold reserves held by central banks 
have increased over the past two 
years. The factors that motivated 
these purchases will remain relevant 
for the foreseeable future.
Industry and technology
Gold is used in an increasingly 
wide range of consumer and 
industrial technologies. It has 
unique technical properties of  
high conductivity, resistance to 
corrosion, malleability and ductility.

 04 Gaming Realms plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to announce strong  
growth in the 15 month period ended  
31 December 2014.
Gaming Realms has delivered solid 
growth in 2014 with revenue rising  
to £11.2m (2013: £0.9m) with an 
adjusted EBITDA loss to £7.8m (2013: 
£2.3m) reflecting the Group’s investment 
in player acquisition and platform 
development.
Acquisitions
In December 2013 Gaming Realms 
acquired QTM, an award winning 
specialist online gambling marketing 
agency for £2.3m. The addition of the 
QTM team has enhanced the Group’s 
strategy of acquiring players across 
its brands. 
On 5 September 2014 Gaming Realms 
acquired BBH for up to £10.5m. Voted 
best Bingo Affiliate (bingoport.com) this 
has enhanced the marketing capabilities 
of the Group even further. 
These two businesses are important 
building blocks in both marketing and 
data acquisition support of the Group’s 
overall strategy.
Strategy
Gaming Realms strategy has remained 
focussed on delivering real money 
gambling to the casual gaming market 
through new content and social elements 
across multi-platforms. We have built 
our new proprietary platform on which 
we launched SpinGenie and to which we 
migrated PocketFruity. We have been 
very successful in acquiring new players 
with 138,852 new depositing players 
acquired across the Group’s brands in 
the period (2013: 18,881). 
The new platform is delivering very 
strong growth on mobile. We are seeing 
68% of our players using a mobile device 
with over 60% of new users registering 
and depositing on mobile. 
Our objective is to offer a more fun 
entertainment based approach to 
gambling, which we will offer to a wider 
audience using modern methods of 
delivery and analysis. We are quite 
literally... playing a new game. 05 Gaming Realms plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements
We are looking to add new unique 
content onto the platform and 
announced in December 2014 the 
exclusive licence for a real money 
gambling version of Slingo from 
RealNetworks which is an exciting format 
for the platform. At its peak, Slingo 
achieved 52 million unique monthly 
active players worldwide and it lends 
itself very well to the mobile gaming 
market. We have added social gaming 
features into the player experience which 
have increased player retention and 
ultimately player lifetime values.

In line with the trading update issued 
on the 23 March 2015, Gaming Realms 
is pleased to announce solid growth 
throughout 2014 with revenue rising 
to £11.2m (2013: £0.9m) and a 
corresponding increase of adjusted 
EBITDA loss to £7.8m (2013: £2.3m)  
as the Group has invested heavily  
in player acquisition and platform 
development. Investment in player 
acquisition has led to an increase in 
average daily active depositing players

December 2014 the Group had no debt 
and held £4.0m (2013: £5.2m) in cash.

in the first quarter of 2015, with net 
gaming revenue from real money on our 
platform increasing 80% quarter on

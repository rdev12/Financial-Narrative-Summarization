publication in the UK and she continues to be actively involved 
in driving the business forward. Her other roles include: 
founder of Priority One, an IT outsourcing business, serving 
medium size businesses in Central London and joint CEO of 
Addictive Interactive a newly launching Social Network for 
brands. Sarah Jane Thomson is Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. She brings to Bloomsbury the experience, 
forward-looking vision, and sure intuition of a successful 
entrepreneur in the digital world. 
Wendy Pallot has joined the Board as Group Finance Director. 
Wendy Pallot is a graduate Chartered Accountant who 
qualified with Coopers & Lybrand with whom she spent 8 
years. She was Group Finance Director for GCap Media plc, the 
UK’s leading commercial radio operator and formerly listed 
on the UK Main Market, from 2005 until its takeover by Global 
Radio in 2008. She was Group Finance Director of GWR Group 
plc, a leading UK radio operator formerly listed on the UK Main 
Market, from 2001 until its merger with Capital Radio plc in 
2005 to form GCap Media plc. She brings to Bloomsbury a fresh 
perspective and a capacity for change.
This mix of new talent and experience on the Board – three 
new members on a Board of six – should not be under-
estimated. It will be invaluable. 
The departure of Colin Adams as Group Finance Director 
deserves special comment. His firm, steady and comprehensive 
grasp of the financial reins, and his understanding of the 
business, saw the Group through a momentous period of 17 
years in its history. The Board and the entire complement of 
Bloomsbury wish him well in his new job.
Charles Black and Mike Mayer stepped down from the Board 
during 2010 after a long service, during which they both 
contributed immensely to the success of the Group.
With the injection of new blood to our senior and middle 
management through acquisitions and recruitment, and 
the depth of the Group in a well-established and long-
serving work-force, Bloomsbury and its stakeholders are 
well equipped for the continued transformation in the next 
stage of the revolution in this industry and the geo-political 
upheaval in the world in which it operates.
The people who work for Bloomsbury are amongst the best 
in the business. The success of the Group in meeting the 
formidable challenges of the past, and in ensuring a profitable 
future, is down to them. The whole team are focused on the 
challenge and opportunities the group now faces. They have 
the thanks and gratitude of the Board, its shareholders and all its 
stakeholders for their untiring and enthusiastic commitment.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Overview
Bloomsbury has changed its year end to 28 February 2011 
as previously reported, so these results are in respect of the 
fourteen months ended on that date. We reported interim 
results for the twelve months ended 31 December 2010 on  
28 February 2011. Figures given below in relation to the twelve 
months ended 31 December 2010 are unaudited.
Bloomsbury’s results for the fourteen month period ended  
28 February 2011 demonstrate not only the strength of our 
revenue streams but also the adaptability of Bloomsbury 
which allows the Group to continue to grow in a difficult, but 
dynamic and opportunistic, external environment. This ability 
is largely centred on our small but strong, proactive and 
entrepreneurial management team, who not only continue to 
excel in traditional publishing but are also establishing a highly 
successful digital strategy. 
A good performance during the fourteen month period was 
particularly strengthened by an excellent final quarter of 2010. 
The two months ended 28 February 2011 were, as forecast, 
seasonally quiet months delivering a small trading loss in line 
with expectations and our experience in previous years.
In 2010 and into 2011 we have, in particular, seen significant 
growth in e-book sales. The US market continues to lead this 
trend, although since the last quarter of 2010, the UK has 
also begun to experience a surge in demand. Bloomsbury’s 
e-book sales rose from £79,000 in 2009 to £1.5m in 2010 and 
sales in January to March 2011 were £1.1m. UK and US e-book 
sales are both growing apace, and with the Kindle now 
firmly established in the UK market and recently launched 
in Germany, there is now a focused effort to sell e-books 
throughout the world.
Financial Performance
On 1 March 2011, Bloomsbury reorganised its structure into 
four worldwide publishing divisions: Adult; Children’s & 
Educational; Academic & Professional; and Information. We 
have also created two global service divisions for Sales & 
Marketing and Production. These changes were made in order 
to align the Group’s structure with the increasing globalisation 
of the publishing business and the growing demand for digital 
content. For the fourteen months to 28 February 2011, the 
Group was managed on the previous geographic lines, so this 
report reflects that configuration, reviewing performance 
within Trade and Specialist divisions across the UK, North 
America and Continental Europe. 
“Bloomsbury’s results for the 
fourteen month period ended 
28 February 2011 demonstrate 
not only the strength of our 
revenue streams but also the 
adaptability of Bloomsbury which 
allows the Group to continue to 
grow in a difficult, but dynamic 
and opportunistic, external 
environment.”

Chief Executive’s Statement
Chief Executive’s Statement
Revenue for the Group for the fourteen month period to  
28 February 2011 was £103.4m (12 months ended 31 December 
2009: £87.2m). Revenue for the year to 31 December 2010 was 
up 4% to £90.7m (2009: £87.2m). Revenues from the UK for the 
fourteen month period were £70.6m (2009: £58.9m). Revenues 
from the US were £21.7m (2009: £18.8m). Revenues from 
Continental Europe generated by Berlin Verlag were £10.1m 
(2009: £9.6m). Revenues from Bloomsbury Australia, which was 
launched on 1 January 2011, were £1.0m.
Profit before tax for the Group was £4.2m (2009: £7.1m). Profit 
before tax and highlighted items was £7.7m (2009: £7.7m). 
Highlighted items include the amortisation of intangible 
assets of £1.1m (2009: £0.6m), impairment of goodwill for 
Berlin Verlag of £1.5m (2009: £nil), costs of £0.3m (2009: £nil) 
relating to an aborted class one acquisition, restructuring 
costs of £0.2m (2009: £nil) and costs of £0.2m (2009: £nil) in 
relation to the relocation of the London offices as part of the 
Group’s reorganisation. We are due to move to a new London 
headquarters building in August 2011. This will enable the 
majority of Bloomsbury staff in the UK to operate from one 
building and bring the benefits of better integration of the 
publishing teams. The impairment of the goodwill in Berlin 
was made following a review of economic factors affecting the 
business. A new management team and structure is in place 
there now and a subsequent rationalisation of the publishing 
programme and reduction of the cost base has put the 
business on a firmer footing for the future. 
Basic earnings per share were 3.02 pence (2009: 6.77 pence). 
Basic earnings per share before highlighted items were 7.70 
pence (2009: 7.56 pence). Diluted earnings per share were 3.02 
pence (2009: 6.74 pence). Diluted earnings per share before 
highlighted items were 7.70 pence (2009: 7.53 pence).
At the period end the Group had net cash balances of £36.9m 
(2009: £35.0m). We continue to invest in future growth through 
acquiring new authors and titles as well as specialist publishing 
companies. Our strong balance sheet puts us in an excellent 
position to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise. 
As at 28 February 2011, the Group had 1,329 titles (31 December 
2009: 1,073) under contract for future publication, with a gross 
investment of £23.2m (2009: £23.7m). After payment of the initial 
tranches of advances to authors, our commitment for future 
cash payments on these contracted titles was £13.2m (2009: 
£13.4m).

Chief Executive’s Statement
UK Specialist
In July 2010 Bloomsbury Academic won the contract to 
digitise and publish online on a subscription model the 
archive of Sir Winston Churchill. This nearly one million page 
archive will be launched in the second half of 2012. In April 
2011 we purchased the National Archive Book publishing 
programme from the National Archive, that includes an 
academic as well as a trade history list. 
The acquisition of Bristol Classical Press and Duckworth 
Academic in November 2010 has made Bloomsbury Academic 
a major player in the field of classical scholarship by publishing 
important new research in Archaeology, Classics, Ancient 
History and Ancient Philosophy. 
Bloomsbury Professional published a number of major 
reference works in the period. Foremost of these were The 
Law and Practice Relating to Charities 4th ed., by Hubert 
Picarda QC which is the first major book to cover the sweeping 
new reforms in charities law, and Personal Injury Schedules 
– Calculating Damages 3rd ed. Our loose-leaf, Norfolk and 
Montagu on the Taxation of Interest and Debt Finance, 
was re-launched to great acclaim and this has led to a 24% 
increase in these loose-leaf subscribers and a more than 100% 
increase in revenue owing to the delivery of higher value 
content. Important to our success in 2011/12 is the launch of 
our new online service, and loose-leaf titles such as Norfolk 
and Montagu, with their established subscriber base, regular 
income stream and fast-changing content, which are ideally 
placed to capitalise on online delivery.
Our Core Tax Annual series continued to grow in 2010, 
with revenue up by 20% on the previous year. It will form 
the backbone of our new tax online service, which will be 
launched later in the year. The change of government in 2010, 
combined with an extra Finance Act, created significant tax 
publishing opportunities. As complex tax reforms are set to 
continue over the next few years, we can expect a continuing 
uplift for our tax publishing programme.
In 2011/12 we launch a new online professional service in 
the Republic of Ireland. The first modules will provide a 
comprehensive reference service for professionals specialising 
in tax and company law, with further modules in other core 
subject areas to follow.
Under Bloomsbury’s ownership, Berg Publishers produced 
the best performance in its trading history in the period. Sales 
were strongly boosted by the US co-publication of the Berg 
Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion with Oxford University 
Press. Along with the on-line Berg Fashion Library, it won three 
major awards. The first was the 2011 Dartmouth Medal, awarded

by the American Library Association who deemed it a “landmark 
of scholarship.” The second was the 2011 Frankfurt Book Fair 
Digital Award from the Independent Publishers Guild and the 
third the 2011 Bookseller FutureBook Award for Best Website.
In September 2011 Berg will relocate from Oxford to the new 
London head office, with clear advantages from reduced 
overheads and synergies from the closer integration of the 
Berg business with Bloomsbury’s visual arts list.
Methuen Drama and Faber & Faber Limited have just announced 
a new partnership to develop a drama digital content platform 
for libraries, teachers, students and researchers. Launching in late 
2012, Drama Online is the ultimate online resource for plays, critical 
analysis and performance. Drawing on the pre-eminent titles from 
Methuen Drama, Arden Shakespeare and Faber, Drama Online 
will offer a complete digital library of the most studied, performed 
and critically acclaimed plays from the last two and a half thousand 
years. In addition, it will provide expert student guidance in the form 
of scholarly notes, annotated texts, critical analysis and contextual 
information. Performance and practitioner texts from theory 
to backstage and acting guides, coupled with video and audio 
material, will make this an essential study tool meeting the full range 
of drama teaching needs.
Bloomsbury Information had an excellent financial period 
which saw the delivery of our key management services 
contracts with the Qatar Foundation through the successful 
launch of two new divisions of the Foundation: Bloomsbury 
Qatar Foundation Publishing (BQFP) and Bloomsbury Qatar 
Foundation Journals (BQFJ). BQFP publishes books in English 
and Arabic and was launched in April 2010 at a reception 
at Windsor Castle hosted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 
and attended by Her Highness Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al 
Missned, Consort of the Emir of Qatar and Chairperson of the 
Qatar Foundation. Since its launch, BQFP has published over 
40 titles including the Arabic translation of the worldwide 
bestseller The Gruffalo. It has acquired English language and 
translation rights to a number of novels from Arab writers 
including the two most recent winners of the International 
Prize for Arab Fiction, known as the ‘Arab Booker’ prize. 
In December the astronaut Buzz Aldrin’s inspiring talk to scientists 
meeting in Qatar marked the lift-off of BQFJ, the open-access, 
online, peer-reviewed, research journals publishing portal (www.
qscience.com). The launch journals include Sir Magdi Yacoub’s 
Aswan Heart Centre: Science and Practice, and journals about 
healthcare, librarianship, education and Islamic Studies.
The online financial best practice and information resource 
(www.qfinance.com) also saw sustained growth through the 
period achieving over 186,000 unique visitors per month by 
the end of February 2011.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Prospects for 2011/12 are positive as the new businesses 
develop. From 1 July, BQFP will take over the sales of 
Bloomsbury Group titles in the Arab World from Penguin 
Group. Other international business development 
opportunities are under active pursuit with additional internal 
resource being devoted to this aspect of the Division’s 
activities since the Group restructure in March 2011. 
UK Trade 
The Trade division continues to perform well. The strategy 
for the division has been to focus strongly on the titles with 
maximum commercial potential whilst keeping tight controls 
on the level of advance investment, continuing to identify new 
talented writers and promoting the “long tail” by acquiring 
established authors’ backlists in print and e-book format and 
moving titles to print on demand. 
In Adult the growth of our food list has been considerable 
with books published by high profile authors such as Hugh 
Fearnley-Whittingstall and Heston Blumenthal but also 
innovative new authors such as Niki Segnit with The Flavour 
Thesaurus. We continue to look for markets that are showing 
good growth and we have embarked on building a crime list 
of high quality writers who will deliver a book a year. Our ten-
year strategy of building a serious non-fiction list has matured. 
Concentration on the growth of our paperback list has paid 
off with a wide variety of bestselling books from the novels of 
Khaled Hosseini to The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie 
Society to Eat, Pray, Love and the books of Ben McIntyre.
The retail landscape is changing with more titles being sold 
online or through supermarkets, in e-book or print format. The 
impact of digitisation is becoming considerable and acquiring 
world English rights is of premier importance in the digital 
future. In the month of October 2010, e-books made up 42% of 
the US sales of our Man Booker Prize winner, The Finkler Question.
During the period we have had seven hardback bestsellers 
in the UK including Alex’s Adventures in Numberland by 
Alex Bellos, The Flavour Thesaurus by Niki Segnit, which was 
the winner of a design award, MI6: The History of the Secret 
Intelligence Service 1909-1949 by Keith Jeffery, Operation 
Mincemeat by Ben McIntyre, Just Kids by Patti Smith, River 
Cottage Everyday by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and The 
Finkler Question by Howard Jacobson. We also had three 
paperback bestsellers, Eat, Pray, Love and Committed by 
Elizabeth Gilbert, and Operation Mincemeat, in the Sunday 
Times list. Operation Mincemeat was number one in both 
hardback and paperback and Eat, Pray, Love was the number 
one bestselling non-fiction book in the year of 2010, occupying 
first place for 23 consecutive weeks.

Howard Jacobson won the Man Booker Prize, and Patti Smith won 
the National Book Award. We continue to identify and acquire 
books that are adopted for the Richard & Judy and TV Bookclub 
promotions. No and Me, Operation Mincemeat and Major 
Pettigrew’s Last Stand were adopted as Richard & Judy picks and 
The Bed I Made and Even the Dogs as TV Bookclub choices.
The 2011/12 year started well with the paperback edition of 
Alex’s Adventures in Numberland and The Good Book: A Secular 
Bible by AC Grayling. Highlights of the year ahead include 
the paperback of The Finkler Question, a new book in the 
summer from Ben Schott, Schott’s Quintessential Miscellany, 
and Rip Tide, a thriller by the ex chief of MI5, Stella Rimington. 
Non-fiction highlights for the autumn include the new title in 
the River Cottage series, River Cottage Everyday Veg by Hugh 
Fearnley-Whittingstall, Heston Blumenthal’s Heston at Home 
and How to Bake by Paul Hollywood.
In Children’s & Educational The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman 
won the Carnegie Medal in June 2010 and was the first book to 
win both the Newbury and the Carnegie Medals. Chains by Laurie 
Halse Anderson was also shortlisted for the Carnegie medal – 
giving Bloomsbury Children’s two out of the eight shortlisted 
titles. Grass by Cathy McPhail won the 12–16 year category for 
the Royal Mail Scottish Book Award in February 2011. Mortlock by 
Jon Mayhew and A Beautiful Lie by Irfan Master were shortlisted 
for The Waterstone’s Children’s Book Prize in January 2011. Terry 
Deary’s Put Out the Light, published in September 2010, has been 
shortlisted for the Sheffield Children’s Book Award 2011. The 
Wombles made a successful return to print, 40 years after the first 
book by Elizabeth Beresford was published, in November 2010. 
A children’s publishing agreement was signed with London 
Zoo to create a bespoke book programme for them; the first 
books will be published in September 2011. 
J.K. Rowling won the Hans Christian Andersen Literature Prize 
in October. The Harry Potter series was reissued in paperback 
with a stunning new livery for a new generation of readers. It 
was published alongside the release of the film of Harry Potter 
and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 in November 2010. Sales of the 
boxed set continued to be particularly strong. Part 2 of this film 
will be released in July 2011. 
We have just announced the establishment of Bloomsbury 
Reader, a new digital global publisher, in partnership with 
the Rights House, one of Britain’s leading literary agencies. 
The aim of this business is to make available books that are 
in copyright but currently unavailable in print, as e-books 
and print-on-demand throughout the world. The first list 
to be published in September 2011 has 500 titles by authors 
including Alan Clark, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Monica Dickens, 
Angela Huth, Roy Jenkins, Edith Sitwell and Alec Waugh, most 
of whom have not been published by Bloomsbury before.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Bloomsbury’s Public Library Online project continues to 
help libraries offer to their communities cost effective online 
access to books from a wide range of publishers thereby 
helping them retain their valued place at the core of a literate 
society. The service has maintained a 100% renewal rate and is 
currently available through 18 UK library authorities reaching 
7.3m of the UK population. Based on the success of the service 
in the UK and its scalability, Public Library Online has now been 
launched in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany 
and Scandinavia.
US
The US turned in a record performance for the period and all 
divisions had marked success. With the addition of new e-book 
agreements, most notably with Barnes & Noble, e-book sales 
increased significantly throughout the year, and Bloomsbury 
had its first two e-book bestsellers on the newly established 
New York Times  e-book bestseller list.
In Adult, My Horizontal Life, by Chelsea Handler, remained in 
the top 20 on the New York Times trade paperback non-fiction 
bestseller list every week during 2010, while the e-book of My 
Horizontal Life was in the top 10 of the New York Times non-
fiction e-book bestseller list that was established in the last 
quarter of 2010. The US Adult division published The Finkler 
Question, and it became an immediate print and e-book 
bestseller when published in October, appearing each week 
thereafter in 2010 on the New York Times trade paperback fiction 
bestseller list, and several weeks on the e-book bestseller list. 
Professional and Academic sales grew solidly throughout the 
year in the US, and the Methuen and Arden Shakespeare lists 
are now well-established there as leading publishers of drama. 
A&C Black’s book on Alexander McQueen, the first book 
published following his death, was a big success. 
The Children’s list had numerous successes including Captivate, 
Carrie Jones’s sequel to her paranormal blockbuster Need. It 
reached number seven on the New York Times bestseller list. Rules 
of Attraction, the follow up to Simone Elkeles’s 2009 bestseller 
Perfect Chemistry, also appeared on the Times list – reaching the 
number three spot – and placed on the USA Today and Publishers 
Weekly bestseller lists as well. Hearts at Stake, by Alyxandra Harvey, 
the first in a paranormal romance series published in January, has 
shipped more than 50,000 copies, and with the subsequent 2010 
releases of Blood Feud in July and Out for Blood in December, the 
series now has over 100,000 copies in print.
Germany
The overall German retail book market showed no growth 
in 2010, and Berlin Verlag’s sales reflected that. A film tie-in 
paperback edition of Elizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray, Love hit the 
top of the bestseller list, as did a biography of Berthold Beitz, 
one of Germany’s most important industrialists during the 
post-war era. Strong sales of Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner 
and A Thousand Splendid Suns ensured that backlist sales 
remained significant.

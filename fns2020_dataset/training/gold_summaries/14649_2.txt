Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements
This Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements which are 
made in good faith and are based on current expectations or beliefs, as 
well as assumptions about future events. You can sometimes, but not 
always, identify these statements by the use of a date in the future or 
such words as “will”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “project”, 
“intend”, “plan”, “should”, “may”, “assume” and other similar words. By 
their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive and 
speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events 
and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. You should not 
place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not 
a guarantee of future performance and are subject to factors that could 
cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or 
implied by these statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to 
update any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, 
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
1 Before exceptional items.
2  Adjusted basic earnings per share is based on adjusted earnings as 
set out in note 13 of Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

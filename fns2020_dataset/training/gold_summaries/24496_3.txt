 Chairman’s Statement
H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 3
Chairman’s Statement
I am delighted to report that 2007 has seen excellent
growth in all areas of the business with H&T’s 2007 profit
before tax and exceptional items reaching £7.2 million.
Financial Performance
The Group has delivered a year of double digit growth in gross
profit, EBITDA (before exceptional items), profit before tax and
exceptional items and number of stores. Gross profit increased
by 18.6 per cent. to £27.7 million (2006: £23.3 million).
EBITDA before exceptional items increased by 20.8 per cent. 
to £11.4 million (2006: £9.4 million). Operating profit before
exceptional items increased by 24.1 per cent. to £10.0 million
(2006: £8.0 million). We also opened 12 additional stores
during 2007, taking the total number of stores at 31 December
2007 to 89.
Secondary placing
On 16 May 2007, H&T completed the placing of 3.6 million
new ordinary shares to existing shareholders, all UK institutions.
This provided the Group with £7 million of additional finance
for its store expansion programme in which it invested £3.6
million during the year.
Final Dividend
In accordance with the dividend policy declared at the time 
of the flotation, the directors are pleased to recommend a final
dividend of 3.4 pence per ordinary share (2006: 3.0 pence).
This dividend will be paid to all shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 16 May 2008.
Outlook
Since the beginning of 2008 our expansion programme has
continued and as of today we have already opened four new
stores - two by acquisition and two greenfields. This takes the
total current number of stores to 93. We are confident in the
Group’s prospects for 2008. H&T will prosper through a mix 
of continued growth in the established estate, development of
the 18 greenfield stores opened over the last three years and
profit enhancement from the recent acquisitions. The current
high price of gold should also provide some profit opportunities
in the short term.
The hard work and commitment of staff has been central to
achieving 2007’s result and I would like to thank all of them 
for that.

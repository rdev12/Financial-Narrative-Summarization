Chairman’s statement

i am delighted that my last statement 
as Chairman of huntsworth should be an 
occasion when, once again, i can report 
record results for your group.
huntsworth is in robust health. not only 
are we showing record revenues and profits, 
we are also well positioned for an economic 
downturn. Operating margins are excellent, 
cash conversion consistently over 100%, debt 
is reducing fast and earn-outs – so often the 
bugbear of acquisition-led marketing services 
companies – fall away over the next three years.
i am proud of what we have achieved since 
2000 when we bought into this group which 
proved to be much weaker than we believed 
possible. Consequently we have had to build 
from scratch. And we have done that very 
successfully. w e now have one of the largest 
independent PR groups in the world with 
a growing specialisation in global healthcare 
communications. w e employ almost 1,900 
people in 70 offices worldwide and service 
over 3,000 clients.

h owever, i am most proud of the management 
team we have assembled over the period. 
One of our senior independent directors 
commented the other day that these top 
managers were as strong as you could expect 
to find in a public company three or four 
times the size of huntsworth. 
i agree. i would only add that i believe that 
they will take h untsworth to those new 
heights – building on the foundations 
which we have established together.
my only disappointment is that our share 
price has not yet reflected the true value 
of the enterprise which we have built.
But i expect the younger management 
team who are increasingly taking over 
at the helm of your company will justify 
a much higher rating as the true value 
of our business is recognised.
And that younger leadership will be guided 
by my outstanding successor – Richard sharp 
– who will take over from me at the Agm 
in may. w e are all delighted that Richard, 
who has enjoyed a successful career at 
goldman sachs, is to join us. i wish him 
every success and i know that he will be 
supported loyally – as i have been – by some 
outstanding colleagues.
if a Chairman’s job is to leave the business 
in a better shape than when he arrived and 
to ensure that his successor is the very best 
candidate available, then i will leave this role 
with great confidence in may.
t hank you all – employees, clients, 
shareholders and suppliers – for your 
support over the last eight years.

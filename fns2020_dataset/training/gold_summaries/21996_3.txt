 02  |  Brooks Macdonald Group  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Chairman’s statement
Christopher Knight Chairman
This has been a year of 
significant progress in which 
we have continued to invest in 
the Group’s future, increased 
our profits and grown our 
funds under management.
Underlying pre-tax profits for the year were 
£15 . 1m (2014: £13 . 3m), a rise of 13 . 5%, 
and underlying earnings per share have 
risen to 91 . 33p (2014: 86 . 24p) .
The board is recommending a final dividend 
of 20 . 5p per share which, if approved by 
shareholders, will result in total dividends 
for the year of 30 . 5p . This represents an 
increase of 17% over the total dividends 
paid the previous year of 26 . 0p per share . 
The final dividend will be paid on 28 October 
2015 to shareholders who are on the register 
at the close of business on 25 September 
2015 . We remain cash generative as a 
business and your board will continue  
its progressive dividend policy .
Our discretionary funds under management 
grew strongly over the year and as at 30 June 
2015 totalled £7 . 41bn (2014: £6 . 55bn), a 
rise of 13 . 13% . This compares favourably  
to the growth of the WMA index of 3 . 75% . 
In August we were pleased to announce 
the appointment of Andrew Shepherd  
as the Group’s Deputy Chief Executive . 
Andrew joined Brooks Macdonald in 2002 
and for the last seven years has been joint 
managing director of Brooks Macdonald 
Asset Management (‘BMAM’) . At the  
same time Nick Holmes was appointed  
the sole Managing Director of BMAM . 
These appointments broaden the senior 
management team and will provide Chris 
Macdonald with more time to focus on 
delivering the Group’s growth ambitions .
The Group has continued to change  
and develop over the last year . We are 
undertaking a complete IT upgrade for  
all our investment businesses, we continue 
to invest in regulatory oversight, our 
investment performance remains strong 
and we remain focused on delivering high 
performance and service standards for  
our clients . We have grown the business 
organically over the last year and with  
the continued changes to the regulatory 
landscape we are pleased with the progress 
we have made .

 Our first annual results as a 
listed company show good 
progress in the delivery of 
our strategy.”
Stephen Harrison
Chief Executive Officer
I am pleased to present our first 
annual results as a listed company. 
They demonstrate good progress in 
the delivery of our strategy since IPO. 
Revenue and profit both increased during 
the year due to a strong performance 
in the second half. Net debt reduced 
significantly, demonstrating the strong 
cash generation of the business. The 
Group Lost Time Injury frequency rate 
reduced by over 50% and the bricks 
business went the whole year without a 
single lost time incident, demonstrating 
that we continue to deliver on our 
commitment to safety.
Our focus continues to be to drive the 
business forward for the benefit of all 
stakeholders, especially our shareholders 
who have recently invested in the 
Company. We continue to identify and 
implement investments which can 
drive growth and improve our service 
to customers.
I am backed by a strong leadership 
team and a great workforce, whom I 
would personally like to thank for their 
contribution and dedication during the 
year. As a relatively new organisation we 
still have improvements to make, and I 
am determined to continue our efforts 
to increase employee engagement and 
make this a great place to work.
I am looking forward to addressing the 
challenges and opportunities faced by the 
business and delivering further progress 
in the implementation of our strategy 
during 2017.

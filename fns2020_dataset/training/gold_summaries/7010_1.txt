 HALMA
Chief Executive’s Review
6 Halma p.l.c. 2005
Record sales, profits and ROCE,
but …..
The Group delivered record sales,
record profits and a ROCE* of 62%
despite the headwind of currency and
rising raw material prices – particularly
stainless steel. It is always pleasing to
report such achievements together
with a record dividend payment for
shareholders, but there is more to be
done if we are to achieve the
performance levels we really aspire to.
The Group did do well to compensate
for some adverse factors, achieve
excellent cash generation and make
two high quality acquisitions. However,
the underlying level of organic growth
was inconsistent with parts of the
business failing to make satisfactory
progress, thereby eroding the growth
delivered elsewhere.
We take encouragement from our
achievements but do not shy away
from the challenges. Setting high
standards and expectations of our
performance has been a key element
of Halma’s continuing success in
delivering outstanding returns.
Strong cash generation and a
record dividend
The Group’s excellent cash generation
and outstanding ROCE* record is not
achieved easily but by the disciplined
management of our assets at all levels.
During the year this enabled us to
make £9 million of capital investment
in our existing operations, pay a record
dividend to shareholders for the
twenty-sixth consecutive year, make
two significant acquisitions and still
have £12 million of net cash available
at the year end.
Flat sales performance in
continuing operations
Sales from continuing operations,
excluding acquisitions, increased to all
territories except for the US where
turnover fell by 10%. Clearly currency
was a key factor, but again, is not the
whole story. We must become more

active in the way we build the
distribution channels of our
businesses, particularly in the US
and other key markets. We have
sometimes lacked clarity and speed
of action in this area in the past and
not allocated a significant proportion
of our resources to make it happen.
Exciting value-adding
acquisitions strengthen Optics
and Specialist sector
During the year we acquired Ocean
Optics, based in Florida, and Diba
Industries, based in Connecticut, for
a total of £22 million. They have
significantly enhanced our capability
in optical sensing and fluid
technology and have performed well
since joining the Group. We remain
committed to making such high
quality acquisitions as they become
available in accordance with our
strategy of focussing more closely on
those markets offering the best
growth opportunities.
Excluding these acquisitions and
costs of holding companies, the
Optics and Specialist sector achieved
underlying profit growth of 12%.
New product innovation, improved
sales processes and increasing
efficiencies in manufacturing
contributed to an excellent result.
Elevator and Door safety
maintains market leadership
At constant currency, the sector
reported marginal increases in both
profits and sales. In the US, our
voice communications equipment
sales fell significantly. Since the year
end we have merged this business
with our US elevator safety products
company to benefit from its well-
developed sales channels. 
BEA, the door safety business,
performed slightly better in the
second half than flagged at the
Interim stage. After rapid growth
since acquisition, this was
encouraging and underpinned a
reasonable sector performance
overall.
Water sector repositioned for
new market needs
We have taken actions to position the
business for better growth in the
future. There were significant changes
to senior management and to the
product range, which had short-term
consequences for operating costs and
margins. For example, it was
necessary to rationalise our range of
instruments which measure flow and
pressure in water networks to meet
more precisely the growing demand
for these products worldwide. This
resulted in additional costs associated
with stock write downs, field service
replacements, and adjustments to
product design and selling resources.
In addition, there was no repeat of a
major US leak detection contract this
year following last year’s success in
Las Vegas. However, we continue with
our investment in the US for leak
detection, UV treatment and water
quality. Our water business is now in
better shape to meet the
opportunities presented by this long-
term growth market.
Resistors struggle against impact
of currency and raw material
prices
As indicated at the half year, the
margins on our Resistor business
came under intense pressure from
stainless steel price increases. In the
second half, we had some success in
mitigating these increases although
in certain cases long-term contract
terms proved difficult to renegotiate.
We have recognised for some time
that our Resistors business has been
struggling against rising raw material
prices, currency and tough market
conditions. Since the year end, more
vigorous action is being taken and
already we have consolidated two of HALMA

our manufacturing operations based
near Cincinnatti, Ohio.
Fire and Gas delivers solid result
in changing market
We responded positively to the major
M&A activity in the global Fire and Gas
market. New product developments
and industry-leading customer service
levels helped us to compete with US
based rivals who benefited from a
weaker dollar when selling into export
markets. Whilst the market is
undergoing a period of significant
consolidation we continue to find, and
exploit, new opportunities.
Process Safety introduces new
products for new applications
A number of products were launched
targeting new applications for our
safety interlock products. The roll out
was more gradual than expected in
some cases, but the year ended with
greater momentum than it started,
particularly in the oil and
petrochemical market. Overall, the
sector continues to deliver a
satisfactory return on sales and
excellent ROCE.
Talented people and excellent
products
During the year, I visited all of Halma’s
principal subsidiaries and saw how
hard our people are working towards
our goal of higher growth. Halma has a
talented workforce that creates, builds
and sells excellent products covering a
huge range of applications. Improving
the timing of new product
introductions is an area we need to
improve continually and, although
great strides have been made recently,
a further improvement will have a
significant impact on our organic
growth prospects.
It is encouraging to see the increasing
commitment of our businesses towards
exceeding the expectation of
customers. Our innovation often makes
a big difference to our customers’
success and quicker new product
introduction is another way in which
we can exceed their expectation for
our mutual benefit.
Stephen O’Shea’s retirement
I would also like to record my thanks
to Stephen O’Shea for his generous
help during the recent handover period
and for his contribution to the Group’s
many successes since he joined us as
MD of Apollo Fire Detectors 22 years
ago. I am sure you will join me in
wishing him a long and happy
retirement.
A robust strategy although striving
for greater growth
Our ability to maintain strong returns
reflects well on our strategy of creating
unique, high value products which
protect lives, or improve the quality of
life, for individuals and businesses
worldwide. We will continue to invest
in, and develop, high return
technology businesses which operate
in niche, ‘demand driven’ global
markets with strong barriers to entry.
Actions to reposition the Group for
higher growth will continue both
operationally and structurally. I am
looking for greater consistency of
performance across the Group to
deliver the sustained organic growth
which provides valuable returns for
shareholders. Whilst there is still much
work to be done, there are good
opportunities available to us and I am
very much looking forward to leading
the Group in the year ahead.

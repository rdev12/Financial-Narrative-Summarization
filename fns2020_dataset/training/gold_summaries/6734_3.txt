 In a demanding year Goldshield continues its development. As the Chief Executive reports in
detail, your Company has focused upon delivering a number of key near term business objectives
during the year. In this way Goldshield has created a platform for future growth. This success has
been achieved at a time when a considerable amount of management time has been absorbed by
the Department of Health case against the Company and the SFO case against both the Company
and two of its leading executives including the CEO.
Within the business we set a number of key objectives for the year; to maintain sales, to build our
cash reserves and to develop our strategy in India. All three have been achieved. As a result, our
prospects for the future look strong.
The SFO case has, ﬁnally, moved forward. While we continue to deny vigorously the SFO’s
allegations, Ajit Patel, Kirti Patel and the Company have now been charged. The next step is the
service of the prosecution case in mid-July 2006. This will be the ﬁrst opportunity that we have
had, to get a more detailed insight into the case put forward by the SFO. The legal costs
associated with both the SFO action and Department of Health claims are signiﬁcant and are
disclosed separately as exceptional items in the Income Statement and provided for where
appropriate. 
We have taken these allegations very seriously and have established an independent Board
subcommittee whose function is to consider the Company’s strategy and formal response at each
stage of the proceedings.
The Board is delighted to welcome Keith Hellawell as a Non-Executive Director and Chairman
designate. Keith’s impressive public sector experience as Chief Constable of Yorkshire and the
‘National Drugs Coordinator’ is supplemented by signiﬁcant main Board experience in large private
businesses. We look forward to beneﬁting from his experience on the main Board and Board
committees.

About the Company
Founded in 1881, today we operate a group of twelve
distinctive department stores across the country,
from Kendal in the north to Bournemouth in the south.
 All trade under the well-established Beales brand,
with the exception of three stores, where we have
retained the locally respected names of Broadbents &
Boothroyds (Southport), Whitakers (Bolton) and
Denners (Yeovil).
We offer branded, functional and aspirational
merchandise for men, women and the home,
tailored to the individual requirements, in each
locality, of our customers, the discerning ABC1
consumer, who is seeking quality, style and
value for money.
We are proud of our individuality and our unique
heritage, which we draw on to provide exceptional
levels of personal customer service and in-store
environments which are being enhanced and updated
constantly to meet the expectations of our
customers.
Our aim is to grow our business through the
ongoing development of our existing portfolio
and the acquisition of similar department
stores.

M6G	arm	compared	to	the	morphine	arm	in	the	24	hour	period	after	
treatment 	 was 	 reduced 	 by 	 32% 	 (statistically 	 significant, 	 p=0.044). 	
The	incidence	and	severity	of	post ‑operative	nausea	in	the	M6G	arm	
was	27%	less	than	that	observed	in	the	morphine	arm	in	the	period	
6–24	hours	after	treatment.	This	was	the	second	primary	endpoint	
and	approached	statistical	significance	(p=0.052).
3. 	 P A TIENTS	RECEIVING	 M6G 	USED	LES S	ANTI ‑ EMETIC	DRUGS
In	addition	to	the	nausea	and	vomiting	reductions	of	over	25%,	
secondary	data	revealed	that	patients	receiving	M6G	required	
over	20%	less	anti‑emetic	medication	over	the	0–24	hour	period	
than	those	in	the	morphine	group.	This	shows	that	not	only	does	
M6G	induce	significantly	less	nausea	and	vomiting	than	morphine,	
but 	 also 	 that 	 the 	 post ‑operative 	 anti‑emetic 	 treatment 	 required	
is	considerably	reduced.	
The	potential	for	reduced	anti‑emetic	drug	costs	combined	with	
t h e 	 r e d u c t i o n 	 i n 	 m e d i c a l 	 a s s i s t a n c e 	 a n d 	 t h e 	 i m p r o v e d 	 p a t i e n t 	 c o m f o r t	
due	to	lower	PONV	supports	CeNeS	justification	of	a	substantial	
price	premium	for	M6G	compared	to	morphine.

This	filing	is	a	key	milestone	in	CeNes	history	and	represents	a 	 m a j o r	
step	forward	in	the	clinical	development	of	M6G.	The	opening	trial	
under	this	IND	was	the	Phase	I	pharmacokinetic	study	in	volunteers	
(M6G029).	W ith	the	successful	conclusion	of	this	study ,	CeNeS	has	
completed	the	studies	requested	by	the	FD A	to	support	a	Phase	III	
programme	in	the	USA .
CeNes	preferred	strategy	is	for	a	partner	to	be	involved	in	the	key	
decisions	regarding	regulatory	filing	strategies	both	in	Europe	and	
in	the	US.	The	strong	data	obtained	from	the	most	recent	Phase	III	
study	supports	the	proposed	product	profile	of	M6G	and	strengthens	
CeNes	position	with	potential	North	American	partners.	Registration	
could	be	achieved	in	the	US	in	2010	after	conducting	two	Phase	III	
studies	to	the	requirements	of	the	FD A .	It	is	important	to	note	that	the	
quality	and	robustness	of	the	clinical	data	produced	by	the	M6G022	
study	significantly	reduces	the	risk	for	the	development	of	M6G	by	
enabling	optimal	trial	design	and	the	selection	of	endpoints	in	the	
remaining	Phase	III	studies.	
In	Europe	the	narrow	failure	to	achieve	statistical	significance	with	the	
second	chosen	primary	endpoint	of	incidence	and	severity	of	nausea	
(p=0.052	not	p<0.050)	offers	three	options:
	 	 pursue	a	filing	application	in	cer tain	European	countries	with	the	
comprehensive 	 clinical 	 data 	 package 	 that 	 CeNeS 	 has 	 assembled;	
	 	 further	strengthen	the	European	package	by	conducting	an	
additional	European	Phase	III	study;	and
	 	 use	the	US	Phase	III	trials	to	sup port	the	European	application,	
potentially	with	a	global	partner .

In	line	with	our	stated	lower	risk	approach,	CeNeS	has	examined	
the	continuing	use	of	L ‑DOP A	as	the	main	treatment	of	P arkinson’s	
disease	and	selected	a	discovery	opportunity	that	could	significantly	
enhance	its	effectiveness.
Replacement	therapy	using	the	precursor	of	dopamine,	L ‑DOP A	
combined	with	a	Dopa‑decarboxylase	(“DDC ”)	inhibitor	(carbidopa	
or	benserazide)	is	the	mainstay	of	therapy	in	P arkinson’s	disease.

T olcapone	and	entacapone,	in	common	with	the	majority	of	known	
potent 	 COMT 	 inhibitors, 	 contain 	 the 	 undesirable 	 3‑nitrocatechol 	 unit	
that 	 is 	 associated 	 with 	 poor 	 oral 	 absorption, 	 short 	 plasma 	 half ‑life 	
and 	 extensive 	 metabolism 	 issues. 	 The 	 goal 	 of 	 breaking 	 away 	 from	
this	nitrocatechol	series	has	been	achieved	by	CeNeS	scientists	and	
a	number	of	discrete	chemical	series	without	the	nitrocatechol	group	
have	been	identified.	The	COMT	inhibitor	programme	was	carefully	
chosen	by	CeNeS	in	line	with	our	strategy	to	have	a	low‑risk	profile	
and 	 to 	 address 	 a 	 clear 	 commercial 	 opportunity . 	 A 	 number 	 of 	 potent

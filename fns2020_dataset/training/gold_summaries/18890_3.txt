 We now have an excellent platform from 
which to develop our business and create 
long-term value for our shareholders.
BOARD CHANGES 
In my Chairman’s statement last year,            
I emphasised the importance of building 
a strong and collaborative Board that can 
provide the leadership and experience to 
help oversee Laird’s next phase of growth.
During 2015, there were four new 
appointments announced to the 
Laird Board:
• Mike Parker joined us as Senior 
Independent Director in March. Mike is a 
former CEO of Dow Chemical and British 
Nuclear Fuels and has wide experience as 
a Non-Executive Director on the boards 
of several substantial companies;
• Tony Quinlan joined us as CFO in July. 
He is a former CFO of Drax and has 
served at a senior level in Marks & Spencer;
• Kjersti Wiklund, a Norwegian national, 
joined us as Non-Executive Director 
in July. Kjersti is a senior executive at 
Vodafone and has lived and worked in 
both Eastern Europe and Asia. She adds 
significant technical and international 
expertise to our Board;
• Nathalie Rachou, a French national with 
extensive international financial and M&A 
experience, joined us on 1 January 2016. 
Nathalie is a Non-Executive Director of 
Société Générale where she chairs the 
Risk Committee, Veolia Environnement 
and Altran Technologies.
2015 has been another good year for Laird 
and one in which we have continued to 
deliver against our three core principles of 
innovation, reliable fulfilment and speed.
During the year we:
• widened our range of offerings. 
In particular, the acquisition of LS 
Research and post year-end acquisition 
of Novero mean that our fast-growing 
wireless internet and telematics 
businesses will now be of similar scale to  
our Performance Materials business;
• made further progress in diversifying  
our customer base. This has reduced our 
reliance on any one customer;
• developed a plan to streamline our 
business to become a more effective 
partner for our customers and deliver 
efficiency savings. The benefits from the 
plan we announced in October 2015 will 
be significant from 2017 onwards;
• continued strengthening the executive 
management and Board of the Company 
in line with our ambitions.

Annual Report & Accounts 2015
02 Laird’s cultural transformation over the 
past three years has delivered a ‘One Laird’ 
approach in all aspects of the business. 
The exchange of ideas and sharing of 
innovation are now a fundamental part 
of the way we operate. This has fostered 
collaboration between business units, 
functions and geographies, leading to new 
customer wins and improved business 
processes. I would like to thank all our 
employees for their efforts over the year.
OUTLOOK
The sustainable growth of our business 
remains a key focus. We continue to make 
strides in diversifying our customer base 
while also continuing to invest in new 
geographies and growth opportunities.
We continue to focus on delivering 
shareholder value by executing against 
this strategy. After another year of growth, 
we remain confident in the strength of 
our business.
DR MARTIN READ, CBE
CHAIRMAN
1 MARCH 2016
Given these extensive changes to the Board, 
we asked Sir Christopher Hum to stay on 
for an additional year to provide a degree of 
continuity to the Board. His many years of 
experience and insight into Laird will be of 
great benefit to us. This will mean that the 
Board will run with one extra Director until 
he retires in December 2016.
Finally, I would like to express our thanks 
to Professor Michael Kelly who retired on 
30 June 2015 and who made a valuable 
contribution to Laird over his nine years on 
the Board.
DIVIDENDS
We aim to deliver shareholder value 
through organic and inorganic growth 
and a sustainable dividend policy.
This year, the Board has proposed a 
2015 final dividend of 8.60 pence per share 
(2014, 8.23 pence), resulting in a 4% increase 
in the total full year dividend to 13.0 pence 
per share (2014, 12.5 pence). The Board’s 
expectation is to increase dividends ahead 
of inflation over time, while taking into 
account underlying profitability, the cash 
requirements of the business and potential 
investment opportunities to drive future 
growth. The final dividend will be payable 
on 6 July 2016 to shareholders on the 
register on 2 June 2016. Having assessed 
our distributable reserves we see no 
constraints in delivering our policy.
PEOPLE 
As always, our people are our most 
important asset. They are the ones who 
reflect our values, run our operations 
and ensure we maintain Laird’s good 
relationships with our stakeholders.

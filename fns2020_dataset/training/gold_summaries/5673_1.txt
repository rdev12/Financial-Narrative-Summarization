chairman’s statement
The refinancing and equity issue
announced on 8 August 2003 and 
now completed brings to an end an
extraordinarily difficult period for the
Company. The difficulties emanated
from a combination of factors. The
general economic environment and the
conditions in our market both took their
toll on the Group generally, and these
combined with the cost of restructuring
and downsizing resulted in a reduction
in our funding facilities. Although the
effect of this was offset by a substantial
reduction in working capital it put
financial pressure on the business,
which has been addressed by the
refinancing and equity issue.
While the electronic component market
remained at a low level throughout 
our financial year which ended on 
31 May 2003 and we are in the middle
of the quiet summer months in Europe,
there are signs that some upturn is not
far away with component manufacturing
capacity utilisation rising and prices
stabilising. The management believe
that we are now well placed to benefit
from an upturn.
Dividend
In April 2003, the Company did not 
pay the dividend due on the Preference
Shares. The dividends due on the
Preference Shares accumulate and
must be paid before any payment of
dividends to holders of Ordinary Shares.
The current performance and position
of the Company make it inappropriate
for the Directors to recommend a final
dividend. The Directors expect to resume
dividend payments once the Group’s
profitability and reserves recover.
Update on Possible Offer
In April 2003, the Company announced
that it was in preliminary bid talks.
Discussions regarding a possible offer
for the Company, although continuing,
remain very preliminary.
Current Trading and Prospects
The Group’s trading in June 2003,
following the 31 May 2003 year end,
was in line with expectations, although
sales and margins in July were impacted
by the Group’s current funding position
prior to the refinancing. With the
refinancing completed, the Directors
believe that we will resume the
Company’s progress in gaining market
share which, with even a small
improvement in market conditions,
which the Board expects to become
evident in the next few months, should
lead to a significant improvement in the
Company’s trading performance for the
current financial year to 31 May 2004.
With the Company placed on a firmer
financial base, combined with the early
tentative signs of a healthier market,
the management faces the future
reinvigorated and determined to succeed.
The Company has created a more
efficient, integrated organisation with 
a much lower cost base than we had
two years ago and the Board believes
that this will allow the Company to be
more responsive to future market
fluctuations.

I am pleased to report that we are,
despite the difficulties of the past six
months, but now with the refinancing
of the Company completed, well
placed for a market upturn with all the
major organisational changes behind
us. Since May 2001 the management
team has fundamentally changed the
business model from a decentralised,
country based, high cost, low profitability
organisation that was difficult to
manage in a cyclical market, to a 
highly centralised model that retains
empowered local sales organisations,
has high levels of efficiency and strong
operational gearing going forward.
Moreover, this combination, together
with our demand creation programme
has created a compelling offering to
both our suppliers and customers.
Results
The Group’s performance for the year
ended 31 May 2003 reflects both
continuing difficult market conditions
and, as described in the Chairman’s
statement, the unique issues facing us,
especially in the latter months of our
financial year.
Sales of the continuing operations fell
by 18% to s438.2m, down from
s532.4m in the prior year. We gained
market share again in calendar 2002
for the second year running. In the
course of our financial year, we believe
that we increased our market share 
in the first half and suffered a slight
decline in the second half. This small
loss in market share should be quickly
recovered now that the refinancing of
the Group has been completed which
should allow the Group to return to 
its medium term trend of increasing
market share. 
chief executive’s review
“We work with many 
of the world’s leading
companies...
The adjusted loss before restructuring
costs, goodwill amortisation and tax 
of s13.0m compared with a profit of
s4.5m in the prior year. This was
principally caused by the difficult
market conditions and additionally the
tight working capital situation facing 
the business in the second half of the
Company’s financial year. Operating
expenses have been reduced by some
30% in the last two years, which partially
offset the loss of revenue in the period.
Cost Reductions
We have continued to restructure the
business to reduce costs. In May 2001
the group employed 1,278 people. We
now employ 807 people, a reduction of
37%, of which over two thirds were
from non-sales roles. The restructured
business model has been achieved by
moving to a single warehouse,
centralised purchasing, consolidating
our sales offices and focusing on fewer
but larger suppliers and customers.
Restructuring Costs
Restructuring costs of s23.4m in this
period, combined with s12.3m in the
prior year and s18.0m invested in the
new logistics centre, means that we
have incurred s53.7m in total over two
years in order to achieve a reduction in
annual operating expenses of s31.0m
compared with the annualised level 
of two years ago. We believe this
process, while costly, has been essential
and will significantly improve the
Group’s future performance.
The Market
As widely reported, the electronic
component market continued to be 
in the longest and deepest downturn 
to date for most of our financial year.
Although volumes have grown through
much of this period, this has been
more than offset by declines in average
selling prices with exceptionally low
component manufacturing capacity
utilisation.
We believe there is some evidence that
this utilisation is rising, and prices have
stabilised. Indeed many forecasters are
predicting growth in the second half 
of 2003 followed by a strong rebound
in 2004. As we are now in the quieter
summer months in Europe, and with
the economic environment in some 
key markets in the region remaining
uncertain, no clear trend is yet
established. However, we believe the
indications suggest some upturn in 
the market, even if weak, in the latter
months of the current calendar year.
Strategy
Our strategy consists of four key
elements: continuous improvement in
customer and supplier relationships,
developing and maintaining operational
excellence and retaining, developing
and attracting talented people. I am
pleased to say that we have made
excellent progress in all these areas
during the past year. The following
sections describe that progress. eurodis electron annual report 2003 05

our focused supplier
programme.”

“Our advanced
logistics centre...
Operational Excellence
The transition from eight warehouses 
in Europe to a single facility has 
been successfully completed. The
Advanced Logistics Centre in East
Netherlands was formally opened in
February 2003. Compared to the 
de-centralised approach, we are
shipping similar volumes with two
thirds less warehouse staff and at
much enhanced quality levels.
The centralising of our purchasing
function is complete and has now
bedded in. We are achieving good
efficiencies and have maintained our
stock turns at 5 at the year ending 
31 May 2003. We believe the function
will now start to deliver real improvements
in gross margin. 
During the second half, we purchased
the 40% minority interest in our 
Eastern European business which has
operations in Poland, Hungary, Czech
Republic, Slovakia and Russia for 
a purchase consideration of s1.5m.
Following this transaction we have
begun the process of creating greater
focus on the Group’s key strategies
which we believe will bring benefits in
improved efficiency and growth within
these businesses.
Excellence in Customer Service
We have achieved this by building 
a highly automated logistics centre and
single IT system where quality is built
in. Since our businesses are separated
by geography and language, a
centralised logistics model that
operates in the same way in all our
business units is critical. Our OneWay
programme, which has run for four
years, has created consistency across
the Group. This enabled us in May
2003 to move from individual company
accreditation to a group-wide
accreditation for ISO9001: 2000. Our
service levels have improved with all
customers now served from a large
single stock location which has a far
wider profile than could be achieved
with the smaller inventories held in
each country in the past. I am pleased
to report that we are recognised as 
an industry leader in e-Commerce 
with 72% of our purchasing activity
conducted electronically and 10% of
our sales order processing is done 
via e-Commerce relationships.
Flexible Local Customer
Organisations
Following the restructuring, our local
companies are more than ever
focussed on sales generation and
customer relationship management.
Although most non-customer related
activities have now been centralised we
have retained decision making locally,
thereby following our guiding principle
of making key decisions close to the
customer. This has created a flexible
and proactive local sales activity.
Demand Creation
Central to our offering is our demand
creation programme driven by our
Technology Centres which have been
created to pool expertise and provide
reference designs for our customers in
high growth segments. We also ensure
we have a high ratio of field application
engineers to field sales people to
augment this approach.

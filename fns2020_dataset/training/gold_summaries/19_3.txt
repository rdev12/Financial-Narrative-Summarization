“ Your service has been a godsend for me 
and my small company, our need to operate 
on an international basis would not be 
possible without Net2Roam”

The key elements of our results for 
the year to 28 February 2007 are 
that turnover was down to £2.6 
million (2006: £5.0 million) and 
losses before tax and the share 
option based charge were £0.8 
million (2006: profit of £1.0 million). 
Cash balances reduced to £2.2 
million (2006: £4.1 million).
These results demonstrate the 
resilience of ONSPEED as we 
continued with the development 
of OnShare. There is no doubt 
that the challenges associated 
with the development of OnShare 
have been greater than originally 
anticipated but this product is 
now out and we are confident it 
will be considerably better for the 
delays encountered. As a result 
of this emphasis on development 
expenditure last year, the cash 
burn rate was considerable but 
it has been reduced substantially 
since the beginning of this year.

Our strategy for growing the 
business remains as stated in 
our AIM admission document – 
to identify, acquire or licence and 
develop technology opportuni-
ties and to commercialise them 
through proven brand develop-
ment and analytical and cost 
efficient marketing. We continue 
to monetise the current products 
within the Group as well as seeking 
new, innovative, web-enabled tech-
nologies to add to our portfolio that 
are pre-paid, high margin and offer 
high visibility. We have acquired the 
technology rights to market some 
new products which will grow our 
product portfolio, thereby enabling 
us to utilise our customer base to 
maximum effect.
In December 2006, we completed 
the acquisition of the outstanding 
minority interest in Onshare 
Limited which holds the OnShare 
technology and this will allow us 
to gain the full advantage of this 
new product when commerciali-
sation commences.

We strengthened our Board by 
appointing three new members 
in the year. In July 2006, Polly 
Williams was appointed as a 
non-executive Director and as 
Chair of our Audit Committee and 
Jonty Slater, the Group’s Chief 
Technical Officer, was appointed 
as an executive Director. Duncan 
Neale was appointed as Finance 
Director and Company Secretary 
in September 2006.
Ian Smith, who joined as a non-
executive Director at the time of 
our AIM listing in June 2005, has 
decided to stand down from the 
Board at our forthcoming AGM due 
to his other increasing business 
commitments. We have benefited 
greatly from Ian’s wisdom and 
experience and wish him well with 
his other endeavours.

Success in the technology 
sector is fundamentally reliant 
upon making the best use of the 
people it employs to create intel-
lectual capital. We are committed 
to motivating, developing and 
rewarding our employees and 
are pleased that employees 
have been with Z GROUP for an 
average of nearly two and a half 
years. We promote knowledge 
sharing across the Group, 
ensuring that management are 
responsive to issues and trends 
within the business and the wider 
marketplace. Our employees are 
encouraged to keep abreast of 
new technology in the market-
place in order to remain competi-
tive. We also promote a collegiate 
atmosphere based on teamwork 
so as to foster creativity while 
focusing on business development.

Part of Z GROUP’s philosophy 
is to work to the highest ethical 
standards wherever possible – 
this includes its relationships with 
employees and customers and 
all those who may have dealings 
with the Group. We actively 
support a small start-up charity 
and provide encouragement 
to those employees involved. 
Also, we adhere to all environ-
mental regulations and have, 
where possible, utilised environ-
ment-sustaining policies such as 
recycling and waste reduction. We 
also encourage our employees 
to use environmentally-friendly 
supplies wherever possible, and 
to conserve electricity and water.

OnShare is now at the stage 
where we can see its potential and 
believe it can deliver significant 
shareholder value. Our priority 
this year is to commercialise the 
OnShare product and to become 
cash positive. Our existing 
and other new products, and a 
much reduced cash burn rate, 
will assist us in that endeavour. 
The current year’s trading is 
currently ahead of budget and 
we are cautiously optimistic that 
the coming months will continue  
that trend.

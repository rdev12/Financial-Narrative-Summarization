What we do for our customers
The way people work, communicate

change. And it is all in the quest  
for increased business productivity  
and efficiency while at the same time 
reducing operational and IT costs.

communications to small, medium  
and large-sized business customers,  
the public sector and not-for-profit 
organisations, both through our large 
network of channel partners and  
directly. Our products include fixed 
telephony, IP telephony, Cloud PBX 
solutions, broadband and data 
connections, mobile services, and  
unified communications solutions.

…what we do
Gamma creates simplified 
communications and 
software services for 
business. With a broad  
range of voice, mobile and 
data services, we lead on 
network strength, products 
that are both easy to use 
and provision, and quality 
through automation. 
Network
We operate a 2000 km optical 
fibre network formed in a 
resilient ‘figure of eight’ 
architecture around the UK.
Our core network centres  
are spread across six main 
locations and our key product 
platforms are located in at 
least two of these locations, 
with the ability for each  
node to act independently 
should one fail. As a result  
we typically achieve an 
availability of 99.997%  
or better for these resilient 
platforms.

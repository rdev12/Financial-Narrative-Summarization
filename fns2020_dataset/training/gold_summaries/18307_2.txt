Diploma PLC uses alternative performance measures 
as key financial indicators to assess the underlying 
performance of the Group. These include adjusted 
operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted 
earnings per share, free cash flow, trading capital 
employed and return on adjusted trading capital 
employed (“ROATCE”). The narrative in the Annual 
Report & Accounts is based on these alternative 
measures and an explanation is set out in note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements included in the Annual 
Report & Accounts on page 72.

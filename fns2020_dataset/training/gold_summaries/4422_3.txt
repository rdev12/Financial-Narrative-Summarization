 OVERVIEW
CHAIRMAN’S ST A TEMENT
Over the past 12 months we have 
made very good progress with our 
“Nouvelle Confiance” strategy to 
improve shareholder value.
After eliminating significant losses in 
our non-core market of Italy towards 
the end of the last financial year, we 
made very good progress this year with 
the completion of the managed closure 
of Spain and the sale of our business in 
Turkey. We have one further non-core 
business, Datart in the Czech Republic 
and Slovakia, for which we expect to 
resolve the future of our shareholding 
in the near future.
We are strengthening and growing our 
leadership position in our core markets 
in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, 
and this has been confirmed by 
significant share gains during the year. 
It is early days but Group retail profit  
is improving and you will read later in 
this report that we now have a clear 
strategy for the core businesses, 
particularly our main operations in 
France, and our plans are on track to 
deliver greater efficiency and reduced 
costs across the Group. 
During the year we completed a 
refinancing of the Group’s debt 
facilities to secure long-term funding 
to support our future growth plans.
I said last year that one of our tasks 
would be the final element of our 
“Nouvelle Confiance” strategy – to 
develop new growth opportunities 
within core markets. We have identified, 
and started to implement, programmes to:
• 
expand the Darty portfolio into 
smaller catchment areas with the 
new franchise model;
• 
extend the low price/pay-as-you-go 
services offer through the 
Mistergooddeal.com channel; and
• 
double the number of stores in 
France with the kitchen offer.
Looking to the coming financial year, 
market conditions are expected to 
remain challenging, but we are well 
placed to deliver our growth ambitions 
for Darty France to build our market 
share and restore retail profitability 
over the medium term. 
In summary, “Nouvelle Confiance”  
is creating a business that is better 
for our shareholders, employees, 
customers and suppliers and we are 
confident that our plans will deliver 
an improvement in earnings over  
the medium term. The Board have 
recommended a final dividend  
of 2.625 cents.
Finally, key to our achievements  
is the dedication and hard work of  
all our staff, and I would personally  
like to thank them all for the valuable 
contribution they make to our success.

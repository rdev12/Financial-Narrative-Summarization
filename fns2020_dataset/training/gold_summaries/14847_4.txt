Our Group 
at a Glance
Our	strategy	is	designed	to	exploit	several	dimensions	 of	our	key	asset	–	a	portfo lio	of	licences	covering	UK	 onshore	oil	and	gas	fields.	As	they	 deplete,	the	fields	 can	be	used	as	gas	stores,	with	the	repressurisation	of	 the	reservoirs	simultaneously	enhancing	oil	production.
A	 seasonal	 gas	 storage	 facility	 is	 a	 method	 of	 storing	 relatively	 cheap	 gas	 at	 times	 of	 low	 demand	 and	 selling	 it	 at	 higher	 prices	 at	 times	 of	 high	 demand.	 Various	 types	 of	 storage	 facilities	 exist.	 Star	 Energy’s	 fields	 are	 ‘brownfield’	 sites	 and	 will	 use	 redeveloped	 reservoirs	 that	 have	 already	 been	 natural	 stores	 of	 hydrocarbons,	 together	 with	 existing	 infrastructure,	 thus	 keeping	 any	 environmental	 impact	 	 to	 a	 minimum.
Star	 Energy	 is	 the	 UK’s	 second	 largest	 onshore	 oil	 producer,	 producing	 a	 weighted	 average	 of	 4,178	 bopd	 net	 for	 2005	 (2004:	 3,021	 bopd)	 from	 total	 oil	 reserves	 that	 have	 been	 recently	 estimated	 to	 amount	 to	 24.5	 million	 barrels	 (2004:	 14.1	 million).	 In	 addition,	 the	 weighted	 average	 of	 gas	 production	 was	 480	 boepd	 for	 the	 year	 (2004:	 481	 boepd)	 which	 was	 used	 to	 generate	 electricity.	 Gas Storage Gas & Oil Production
Strategy 
The	 Group	 intends	 to	 exploit	 this	 potential	 growth	 market	 by	 developing	 those	 fields	 in	 its	 upstream	 portfolio	 with	 geology	 suited	 to	 gas	 storage.	 After	 Humbly	 Grove,	 other	 potential	 sites	 in	 the	 Star	 Energy	 portfolio	 include	 Welton,	 Albury	 and	 Bletchingley.	 Our	 initial	 strategy	 is	 to	 contract	 the	 storage	 space	 to	 blue	 chip	 customers,	 securing	 a	 stable	 level	 of	 cash	 flow,	 while	 retaining	 the	 ability	 to	 share	 in	 the	 upside	 in	 the	 longer	 term	 if	 winter/summer	 price	 differentials	 widen.
Strategy 
This	 portfolio	 represents	 a	 pool	 of	 opportunities	 as	 potential	 gas	 	 storage	 projects	 as	 well	 as	 providing	 the	 Group	 with	 a	 stable	 source	 of	 cash	 flow.	 Our	 strategy	 is	 to	 continue	 development	 of	 this	 portfolio	 and	 augment	 it	 as	 suitable	 opportunities	 arise.	 A	 number	 of	 exploration	 prospects	 exist	 within	 the	 Group’s	 licence	 areas	 but,	 in	 the	 near	 term,	 Star	 Energy	 intends	 to	 prioritise	 gas	 storage	 development	 above	 	 this	 potential. 	 04 	 Star	Energy	Group	plc	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2005	 www.starenergy.co.uk 05 	 www.starenergy.co.uk	 Annual	Report	and	Accounts	2005	 Star	Energy	Group	plc 05
Founded	 in	 1999,	 Star	 Energy	 is	 an	 integrated	 energy	 company	 currently	 operating	 in	 	 the	 UK	 onshore	 sector,	 combining	 gas	 storage,	 oil	 and	 gas	 production,	 and	 electricity	 generation.	 The	 Company	 is	 the	 second-largest	 onshore	 UK	 producer	 and	 has	 148	 employees.	 Our	 UK	 sites	 include	 many	 mature	 fields	 with	 significant	 upside	 potential	 using	 modern	 technology.
Our	 experienced	 and	 highly	 skilled	 workforce	 approach	 all	 developments	 with	 an	 emphasis	 on	 environmental	 soundness	 and	 minimal	 impact	 on	 the	 surroundings.	 Star	 Energy	 has	 gas	 fired	 power	 generation	 plants	 at	 seven	 of	 its	 production	 sites	 with	 a	 total	 generating	 capacity	 of	 approximately	 35	 MW.	 The	 plants	 utilise	 gas	 from	 our	 fields	 to	 generate	 electricity	 that	 helps	 meet	 the	 requirements	 of	 our	 upstream	 operations.
Electricity Generation
Strategy 
Efficient	 use	 of	 power	 is	 an	 integral	 component	 of	 our	 business	 strategy.	 We	 intend	 to	 maintain	 operational	 flexibility,	 relocating	 turbines	 as	 appropriate	 and	 negotiating	 agreements	 for	 both	 the	 sale	 and	 purchase	 of	 electricity	 to	 balance	 periods	 of	 surplus	 and	 deficit	 in	 our	 upstream	 and	 gas	 storage	 operations.

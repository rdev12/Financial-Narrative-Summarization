 Our vision is to be 
the leading provider of 
imaging technology to 
eyecare professionals for 
improved patient care
We believe  
optomap represents an 
opportunity to improve 
pathology detection and the 
patient experience and helps 
a clinician efficiently target the 
area of the retina in need of 
further investigation. OUR 
OPPORTUNITY
Optos’ ultra‑widefield retinal imaging technology, combined with the specific data that can be derived from OCT images, 
has the potential to offer ophthalmologists and optometrists the most powerful tools for disease diagnosis and management.
Worldwide it is estimated that seven million 
people lose their vision every year and that 
285 million people are visually impaired
1
. 
These rates are expected to double by 2020 
unless prevention efforts intensify, as an 
ageing population contributes to more cases 
of cataracts, glaucoma and age‑ related 
macular degeneration (AMD), the leading 
causes of blindness
2
.
A growing need
Ocular pathology as well as many non‑ eye 
diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, 
and certain cancers, often first exhibit in the 
periphery of the retina. Regular screening 
plays a vital role in preventing loss of sight 
and detecting the onset of systematic 
diseases. optomap images taken at routine 
eye examinations provide digital records 
that can be compared over time to monitor 
disease progression and manage treatment.
Benefits of screening
Eye disorders and vision loss are among the 
costliest conditions to the US economy, and based 
on ever‑ increasing healthcare costs and an ageing 
population, this cost is set to continue to grow.

Since our beginnings in 1992, we have 
worked to create ultra‑ widefield retinal 
imaging technology and devices that are 
patient friendly and allow practitioners to 
detect many potential sources of vision loss 
before they become a problem. We are now 
often positioned as an integral part of a 
standard examination across the continuum 
of patient eyecare. 
Where we are
Our range of imaging devices supports 
different customer segments and patient 
levels, and now includes ultra-widefield 
imaging, OCT, visual acuity, perimetry 
and treatment laser products.

OptosPlc WHY OPTOS
With 347 million people worldwide diagnosed 
with diabetes, we have accumulated clinical 
evidence that demonstrates the extent of 
diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the peripheral retina 
and the impact of the severity of the disease.
For example:
   A Harvard University study demonstrates 
that one-third more lesions were found 
in the peripheral area outside of Early 
Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study’s 
(ETDRS) seven standard fields.
    Additionally, in many of these study patients, 
this led to a more severe grading of 
diabetic retinopathy.
   Our ongoing research into diabetic eye 
disease will lead to more effective detection 
of disease at a stage when treatment can 
prevent vision loss.
Optos is raising the 
standard of care for 
diabetic retinopathy
Our ever‑ expanding clinical evidence, supported 
by product development and market positioning, is 
driving a company‑ wide focus to evolve our products 
to take advantage of the latest trends to set standards 
that will allow eyecare professionals to see more and 
treat patients more effectively. This focus will ensure 
Optos remains the leader in UWF imaging.
We are raising the standards that will  
enable more effective retinal care

P200, 200Dx and Daytona with

as screening devices for 
diabetic retinopathy along with 
OptosAdvance for tele‑ health 
and sharing optomap images with 
specialists. In the future Daytona 
and Daytona with OCT will have 
new measurement capabilities, 
longitudinal and multi‑ modal 
tracking, DR detection and 
diagnostic software tools.  More disease was identified on UWF 
compared to traditional field of view 
23%
Published studies demonstrate that 
optomap‑assisted exams outperform traditional 
retinal exams and find more pathology.
Findings include:
   The sensitivity of an optomap‑ assisted 
exam was greater by 30%, significantly 
outperforming the traditional dilated exam.
   A literature review from the past three years 
concluded that there was a prevalence of 
66% of pathology visible outside of the area 
viewed by traditional imaging methods.

optomap retinal imaging and the ability to 
image more retina is now being reported 
to significantly alter disease management, 
leading to better patient outcomes.
For example:
   Results from a study conducted at John Hopkins 
University demonstrated that patient care 
was altered in 51% of the study patients 
than would have been delivered based 
on traditional techniques.
    In several study patients, peripheral findings 
suggested disease activity in the absence 
of clinical evidence of disease in the narrow 
central pole.

Software and feature improvements 
for our 200Tx device specifically 
designed for vitreo‑ retinal 
specialists include multi‑ modality 
tracking of each image type to be 
registered together to get more 
comprehensive information, leading 
to enhanced treatment planning 
and assessment, analysis tools and 
vascular feature measurements.

We are revolutionising eyecare with our core, ultra‑ widefield 
technology. The optomap provides a 200‑ degree view of the retina 
in a single image, something no other device is capable of doing.
We use a scanning laser ophthalmoscope to 
create a virtual point inside the eye enabling 
a 200‑ degree field of view. Two low‑ powered 
red and green lasers scan the retina 
simultaneously, allowing a view of the sensory 
retina to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 
and the deeper structures from the RPE to the 
choroid. Virtual point technology and a unique 
ellipsoidal mirror capture 200 degrees or 82% 
of the retina in a single patient friendly capture. 
How it works
Visit our online report

optomap’s unique 
ultra-widefield vision:

optomap images allow us to 
preview such a wide view of the 
retina before we perform our 
traditional exam…
optomap images offer unprecedented 
visualisation of retinal pathology in a single 
digital image that can be readily annotated 
and shared. A clinical study concluded that 
optomap imaging can enhance a traditional 
dilated fundus exam.

In a standard eye exams, conventional equipment 
is limited to a 45‑ degree field of view of the retina, 
showing very small portions at a time. Clinical 
literature demonstrates that traditional dilated 
retinal exams discover between 32% and 82% 
of the pathologies present.

Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Since November 2005 Booker Group 
has been seeking to ‘Focus, Drive and 
Broaden’ the business. We continue to 
make good progress. 
Focus  
(commenced November 2005)
Booker seeks to become the most 
efﬁcient operator in our sector. Bryn 
Satherley and his team continue to 
improve business efﬁciency. We ‘stop, 
simplify and standardise’ work and 
invest most of the savings in customer 
service. Much of the year has been 
spent integrating Makro into the Group. 
Through tight cash management we 
have now increased net cash from 
£77.2m last year to £149.6m this year. 
Makro business centres are now 
operating on the Booker systems. 
We have also generated synergies of 
approximately £26m through improving 
systems, processes and buying across 
the enlarged Group. 
Drive  
(commenced March 2006)
Booker Wholesale, our cash and carry 
business, served 503,000 customers 
this year up from 486,000 last year. 
 
 
Guy Farrant and the team continue to 
‘Drive’ choice, price and service for our 
customers. Each year we survey 40,000 
customers to identify where improvements 
can be made. Customer satisfaction 
improved again this year and our 
customer count has increased again, by 
17,000 customers. Customer satisfaction 
is a key measure within the business and 
we have made signiﬁcant progress since 
2006, achieving our highest ever levels of 
satisfaction this year. 
Choice Up
• In 2010 we launched Farm Fresh. 
Sales in the year to 28 March 2014 
were £65m. The quality and freshness 
of the produce is second to none and 
can be delivered to our customers 
within 48 hours of being harvested.
• During the year we rebranded Booker 
Basics as Chef’s Essentials to appeal 
to a wider audience. Chef’s Essential 
sales are now £95m per annum.
• We also launched CleanPro. This 
range of 73 professional cleaning 
products has been well received 
by customers.
Prices Down
• We operate in a very price 
competitive market. Every week we 
monitor prices versus competitors 
and during the year our price 
index remained competitive. In the 
year we “locked down” prices for 
caterers which has proved very 
effective in helping caterers plan 
their menu with conﬁdence.
Better Service
• Our people are doing an excellent 
job. Our customers rate Booker 
people highly. Business Centre 
teams at Makro have been trained in 
PRIDE to help improve the Parking, 
Reception, Internal, Delivery and Exit 
experience.
• We have continued to expand and 
improve our delivery service.
• We have more specialist butchers 
and greengrocers within the business 
than last year.
Catering
• Catering like for like sales grew by 
7 .1%, as our choice, price and service 
continued to improve. Our catering 
development sales force continues to 
serve our existing customers and to 
introduce new customers to Booker.

Premier
• Premier, Booker’s symbol group, 
grew to 2,982 stores (2,802 stores 
last year). Sales to these customers 
grew by 12%. The retail development 
team has put a lot of work into both 
compliance and building the sales 
and proﬁts of existing Premier stores.
Family Shopper
• During the year we launched Family 
Shopper. This is a local discount 
store. We now have six stores and, 
although it is early days, the response 
has been encouraging.
Broaden 
(commenced April 2007)
In the UK, Booker seeks to offer the 
best choice, price and service to 
caterers, retailers and small business. 
We also seek to become the suppliers’ 
preferred route to market. We also want 
to sell new products and services and 
reach new customers. In India we seek 
to become the best supplier to Kirana 
stores. To achieve these objectives, 
we are ‘Broadening’ the business. 
‘Broaden’ includes:
Makro
• The most important change we have 
made to Broaden the Group is the 
acquisition of Makro. Makro serves 
around one million small business 
customers, has great people, good 
locations and excellent products. 
Through Booker and Makro coming 
together we seek to become the 
UK’s leading wholesaler to caterers, 
retailers and small businesses. 
We will offer our customers better 
choice, prices and service via the 
internet, delivery and cash and carry. 
The transaction was cleared by the 
Competition Commission on 19 April 
2013. Makro has ﬁtted nicely into 
the Group. We have embarked on 
a rapid turnaround. As a result cash 
management has been tightened and 
we have improved proﬁts from a loss 
of £18m in 2012, to a proﬁt of £1 1m this 
year. Having exited some unproﬁtable 
product categories, sales were down 
9% but customer satisfaction has 
improved signiﬁcantly. We are planning 
that Makro will continue to experience 
a sales loss in the year ahead, as we 
continue to focus on professional 
customers. In Shefﬁeld, Belfast and 
Preston we have developed a new 
Makro/Booker format. The format has 
been tailored to the local market and 
we expect to complete ﬁve more of 
these conversions in the year ahead. 
Critically, Makro is increasing our 
capacity to grow delivered sales. This 
should help the Group grow to an 
estimated £6bn of sales in the next 
few years. I am pleased the team at 
Makro have settled into the Group. It 
is a credit to the teams at Booker and 
Makro that the integration has gone 
so smoothly. I am very grateful to all 
the teams for the hard work this year.
Improving the Cash and Carry 
Business Centre Experience
• We have now converted 150 of our 
172 business centres to the ‘Extra’ 
format. This features a lighter, 
brighter business centre environment 
and an improved choice, price and 
service. The conversion pays back in 
around a year and we plan to convert 
a further three business centres to 
‘Extra’ in the year ahead. The lessons 
from Extra will be rolled to the rest of 
the business and to Makro.
Harnessing the Internet
• Sales at booker.co.uk were £777m, 
up from £704m last year and £15m 
in 2005. All these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. We have 
334,000 customers registered on 
the website compared to 255,000 
last year. Customers can view their 
account details, use an iPhone app 
and order products. We have also 
doubled the number of stock keeping 
units available to a typical customer 
on the website through our special 
order system. This has generated 
incremental sales of £4m. 
Booker Direct/Ritter-Courivaud/
Classic Drinks/Chef Direct
• Mark Aylwin and his team are building 
our delivered wholesale business. 
Booker Direct has great customers 
including the prison service in England 
and Wales, Marks & Spencer and 
most of the cinema chains in the UK.
• In 2010 we acquired Classic Drinks, 
an on-trade wholesaler supplying 
pubs and licensed customers mainly 
in the North West. We are in the 
process of rolling this expertise out 
on a national basis.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Booker Direct/Ritter-Courivaud/
Classic Drinks/Chef Direct 
continued
• In 2010 we acquired Ritter-Courivaud, 
a leading speciality food supplier to 
restaurants. Through combining the 
logistics expertise we have in Booker 
Direct, with the catering knowledge 
from Ritter-Courivaud and the 
Groups’ buying scale, we launched 
Chef Direct in 2012. Chef Direct is 
based in Didcot and has won some 
important clients such as Aramark. 
Aramark serves 250,000 meals a day 
and through working with Booker 
Direct, the road miles have been 
halved and service improved.
• In the last year the Group delivered 
£1.3bn of product to retailers and 
caterers in the UK. Through using 
some of the space in the Makro 
business centres we will be able to 
increase our delivered business. 
Booker India 
• In September 2009 we opened our 
ﬁrst business centre in Mumbai. 
We now have four branches in 
Mumbai, one in Surat and one joint 
venture branch in Pune. We serve 
over 21,000 customers and have 
also launched 200 Happy Shopper 
symbol retailers, which harness the 
lessons learned from Premier in the 
UK for the Kirana stores of Mumbai. 
We are reviewing growth options in 
India and look forward to developing 
the Booker offer to become the best 
choice, price and service supplier to 
Kirana stores and caterers.
Sustainability 
• Booker was the ﬁrst UK wholesaler to 
achieve a third consecutive Carbon 
Trust Standard and the ﬁrst in the 
UK to achieve the new Carbon Trust 
Waste Standard. Booker are also The 
Grocer Gold “Green Wholesaler of 
the Year” 2013.
• 16,000 customers are now recycling 
with Booker through our packaging 
and used cooking oil recycling 
services. This helps our customers 
save money, increase recycling 
levels and support more sustainable 
communities throughout the UK.
• Customer recycling volumes are up 
40% against last year.
• We donated surplus food equivalent 
of 200,000 meals to local charities in 
the last year
• We also helped many customers and 
communities who were impacted 
by the flooding. In the sixteen most 
impacted locations we supported 
customers with a fund of £350,000 
of free stock and support.
People
• The progress made by the business 
this year is a credit to our great team 
of people. We are committed to 
continuing to make Booker better 
and safer for colleagues. We are 
also developing talent. For example, 
there is a shortage of butchers in the 
trade, so we have partnered with the 
University of West London to develop 
a formal “butchery apprenticeship”. 
28 new butchers graduated this year. 
We developed a similar scheme for 
greengrocers with 50 colleagues 
graduating this year. We intend to run 
both schemes again in 2014/15.
• For the seventh year running, 
the performance of the business 
means our people have shared in 
our success through our bonus 
system. With this great team of 
people, Booker will continue to make 
progress in the year ahead. 
• During the storms and flooding, 
our people did a fantastic job of 
maintaining service to our customers.
Our plan to Focus, Drive and Broaden 
the business remains on track. 
Customer satisfaction continued to 
improve and we grew the Group to 
£4.7bn of sales. Most importantly we 
teamed up with Makro to become the 
UK’s leading wholesaler to caterers, 
retailers and small businesses. We will 
provide our customers with improved 
choice, prices and service via the 
internet, delivery and cash and carry. 
We have a great team at Booker and 
Makro and together we will help our 
customers prosper in the year ahead.

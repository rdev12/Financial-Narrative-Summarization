Chief Executive Officer’s review
A high-growth business
• 2015 has been another successful  
year for Regus. We have continued to  
see powerful structural growth drivers in  
our market. More and more organisations 
and individuals are reassessing their 
approach to physical workspace and how 
they work. These positive dynamics have 
seen our business deliver strong underlying 
progress; strategically, operationally, and 
financially. We have added more locations  
to our market-leading network than ever 
before, generated attractive returns on our 
investments and significantly increased our 
profit through further operational efficiency.
Strong financial performance
The post-tax cash return on net growth 
capital expenditure achieved from locations 
opened on or before 31 December 2011  
was 23.1%, an improvement on the returns 
for the same estate in 2014 of 20.9% and  
a level well above our cost of capital. The 
2015 post-tax cash return on investment 
from locations opened on or before 31 
December 2012 was 21.5% (2014: 18.0%).
Group revenue increased by 15.9% at 
constant currency to £1,927.0m (2014: 
£1676.1m) (15.0% at actual rates). 
Underlying operating profit, before the net 
non-recurring gain of £15.3m, increased to 
£144.8m, up 37% at constant currency (39% 
at actual rates). Including the non-recurring 
gain, our statutory operating profit increased 
51% at constant currency to £160.1m  
(up 54% at actual rates).
We invested £284.9m in net growth capital 
expenditure during the year , adding a further 
554 new openings to the network, which stood 
at 2,768 locations at the end of the year.
We generated an increased gross margin  
of 28.3% on all our locations that were open 
on or before 31 December 2012 and also 
improved the gross margin on those 
locations that were added to the network 
during 2013 and 2014, both of which were 
material years of growth and consequently 
represent an increasingly significant  
element of our overall revenue. The initial 
performance of the locations added to  
the network during 2015 is in line with our 
expectations, albeit these are still at an  
early stage of progression towards  
financial maturity. 
Through detailed planning and strengthening 
our controls and processes, we have delivered 
improved operational effectiveness of  
our business, with a further reduction in 
overheads as a percentage of revenues.  
T otal Group overheads were up only 2%  
at constant currency compared to a 22% 
increase in the size of our network. As a result, 
total overheads as a percentage of revenues 
further reduced from 16.7% to 14.7%. 
Cash conversion remains a strong feature  
of our business model. Cash generated before 
investment in growth, dividends and share 
repurchases, and excluding the £80m net 
proceeds arising from the disposal of various 
portfolios of property assets in the first quarter , 
increased 23% to £215.7m (2014: £175.6m). 
After taking the net growth capital expenditure 
of £284.9m and disposal proceeds into 
account, and after paying dividends of £38.8m 
and spending approximately £32.0m buying 
our own shares, Group net debt increased 
from £138.0m at 31 December 2014 to 
£190.6m at 31 December 2015. This 
represents a Group net debt : EBITDA  
leverage ratio of 0.66  times, which is  
well below our internal 1.5 times limit and  
reflects our continued prudent approach  
to the Group’s capital structure.
Americas
Our Americas business achieved a good 
performance and is a key growth region  
in absolute terms. In total we had 1,140 
locations in the region at the end of 
December 2015. On a like-for-like basis 
mature revenues increased 3.9% at  
constant currency to £712.1m (up 7.9%  
at actual rates) with an average mature 
occupancy of 83.0% (2014: 79.1%).  
During the year we added 180 locations  
to the Americas network, expanding the 
business into more parts of the region.  
This expansion increased the average 
number of available workstations from 
131,665 to 149,414, with a total of 165, 464  
at the period end. 
In the Americas, the USA is our predominant 
market. It has performed well and we have 
made good progress expanding into 
secondary and tertiary markets on variable 
lease deals and increasing the range of price 
points by expanding the number of formats  
being offered. Mexico has remained a good 
market and after recent economic issues  
we have seen an improvement in our 
business in Brazil. 
EMEA
The reported revenues of our EMEA 
business have been impacted by the 
appreciation of sterling against the euro. 
Mature revenues on a constant currency 
basis increased 5.5% to £321.2m but  
were down 5.8% at actual rates.  
Occupancy on the Mature business 
increased from 77.6% to 79.4%. During 
2015 we added 183 new locations, taking  
the total number of locations to 736, and 
added Iraq to the network. The average 
number of workstations increased from 
61,274 to 77,901. At period end we had 
82,491 workstations. 
We have experienced strong growth in  
the incredibly diverse region of the Middle 
East and Africa. In Europe, across the  
many countries in which we operate,  
there has been a mixture of performance, 
but the overall result has been good. We 
have experienced an improved performance  
in Spain, whereas Russia has been a difficult 
market requiring the renegotiation of rental 
An excellent year in the 
development of our business. 
Our financial results are strong 
and we remain in robust 
financial health. We continue  
to find attractive opportunities 
to build out our global network 
and service the structural 
changes in the world of work.

also provided opportunities and we have

Asia Pacific
Our Asia Pacific business continues to  
move forward and has been our fastest 
growth region overall, with 146 new locations 
being added including our first centre in 
Brunei. In total we had 545 locations in the 
region. Mature revenues increased 3.9%  
to £239.1m at constant currency (up 3.7%  
at actual rates) with an average mature 
occupancy of 85.4% (2014: 78.9%) driven  
by growth in lower relative REVPOW 
markets. The average number of 
workstations increased from 58,911 to 
78,571. At the end of the period we had 
91,887 workstations, making it our second 
largest region.
There remains ample opportunity for  
growth in Asia Pacific both from building  
out in existing countries and adding new 
ones, like Brunei. We have continued to 
expand our business in China, which has  
not experienced any impact from the recent 
economic slowdown. We remain watchful 
however , and look to drive growth in 
secondary and tertiary areas using  
capital-light deals.
UK
Our UK business has delivered a good 
performance. Mature revenues advanced 
3.7% to £352.9m with mature occupancy  
at 81.1% (2014: 83.7%). With growth in the 
UK in recent years driven primarily through 
acquisitions, which started to feed into the 
Mature business in 2015, this is a good 
revenue improvement. The number of 
occupied workstations has remained  
very stable, but during 2015 expansions 
our competitors in our speed of expansion, 
increasing operational efficiency and the 
relevance and quality of our service offering. 
As part of our investment case we are 
constantly striving to improve our business 
and future potential returns. Whilst this is  
an ongoing process, we have recently 
implemented two important changes.
We have changed the field structure to 
introduce a clustering approach to the  
local management of locations. This has 
improved the cost structure of the  
business going forward and will lead to  
higher productivity. With the in-field  
selling resource now focused on a specific 
number of locations, we believe this will 
better promote the active marketing of  
the whole range of what is offered by the 
entire cluster , including format and price 
point. So, as well as improving operational 
leverage, this structural change also has the 
potential to deliver incremental revenues. 
The other important change we have 
implemented is to improve the compensation 
basis for location managers. Under the 
previous system bonuses consisted primarily 
of sales commissions. This has now been 
replaced by a quarterly profit share bonus 
scheme that better aligns rewards within  
the business with the interests of our 
shareholders. We have, however , retained  
the requirement to improve customer 
service, as measured by a Net Promoter 
Score, and reward export sales to locations 
outside of the manager’s cluster.
T oday, our return on investment is highly 
attractive, our cash flow is strong, and  
we have a proven, successful growth  
story that has seen us significantly develop 
our network over the past two years while 
continuing to deliver consistently strong 
returns. 2015 saw us hit many key 
milestones, as we added a record 554 
locations across the world to bring the  
total space under our management to over 
46 million square feet, entered Brunei, our 
106th national market, celebrated 20 years  
in China and 10 in India, opened our 500th 
centre in Asia Pacific and our 1,000th  
centre in North America (United States  
and Canada). 
We continued to differentiate our 
proposition, with the launch of services  
and benefits including the new Spaces 
(targeting creative workers) and Signature 
workspace formats, the continued growth  
of Regus Express in more airports, railway 
stations and shopping malls around the 
world, access to 18 million Wi-Fi hotspots 
and 800 airside lounges and our new 
community app. Importantly, we 
Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
increased the available inventory in the 
Mature business by 3%, which largely 
accounts for the occupancy reduction. 
During 2015, 45 new locations were added  
in the UK taking the total number of 
locations to 347. We are now seeing more 
growth in regional locations in the UK to 
complement our presence in the major 
cities. T otal average workstations increased 
from 60,037 to 65,721 with 70,956 at the 
year-end.
We also opened our first co-working  
Spaces location in Oxford Street. After  
only six months this has proved a popular 
format and location and has achieved  
strong occupancy and good margins.
Market context
2015 was a very significant year in the 
development of Regus. The change we  
have seen over the past two years has  
been remarkable, as an increasing number  
of businesses – from large corporations  
to entrepreneurial start-ups – have come  
to recognise the power of flexible workspace 
in helping them maximise the positive 
impact of new technologies and  
transform performance. 
Increasing awareness of our industry, 
coupled with shortening company and 
project lifecycles, is leading customers to 
distribute their workforces and service their 
customers in new ways that drive efficiency 
and reduced costs.

strengthened our business with the 
appointment of senior executives to bring 
additional energy, experience and intellect to 
our leadership teams.
Strategic direction
Despite our existing market leadership 
we have scope for significant growth.  
Our future is therefore about realising  
that potential, both in larger markets like 
China, India and the US, where we see the 
potential for a combined total of over 9,500 
locations (up from over 1,000 today), and in 
our most developed networks, such as the 
UK where we have 347 locations and see 
significant scope for further expansion. 
In doing so, we want to ensure that we  
can provide a solution for customers with 
every potential budget. We are focused on 
capturing the growth opportunity we have 
and realising the potential of the business, 
thereby generating significant value for 
shareholders as we move towards a potential 
20,000 locations. Effective planning, strong 
partnerships and product innovation will be 
the key factors in attaining this goal.
Planning
Business planning is critical as we go 
forwards. The simpler our business is to 
operate, ensuring that our people can get  
it right 100 per cent of the time, the more 
efficiently we can roll it out. As we enter the 
next stage of growth, we have developed  
a more sophisticated approach to planning, 
while keeping it simple, effective and fully 
aligned with our business goals. 
T oday , planning at Regus revolves entirely 
around defining and meeting customer  
needs through factors such as format,  
service portfolio and price point. Our approach 
is therefore structured, transparent, focused 
on the detail and planned at every level. As  
a result, we understand what we want to 
achieve, the risks involved and how to  
mitigate those risks.
Partnerships
Adding 554 locations during 2015 involved 
opening more than two every working day 
throughout the year. This is why we are 
further industrialising our approach to 
growth while keeping a very firm hand  
on risk.
We already have a very successful  
growth story. By changing the mix of 
formats, segments, markets and models  
and by streamlining our methodology 
through careful planning and automation 
within a new network of shared service 
centres, we can grow in a far more capital-
efficient way. Increasingly, by partnering 
more with the companies that own and fund  
real estate, we bring together investors  
in property and our fast-growing global 
customer base and continue to generate 
attractive returns on our investments. 
Products and innovation
Our business is based on the understanding 
that physical space needs to keep up with 
changes in technology. For this reason,  
we have invested a substantial amount  
in R&D during the past three years, building  
a world-class technical infrastructure and  
an array of apps and services. 
We will also continue to add to our line-up  
of formats that deliver a bespoke workspace 
environment to different parts of the 
addressable market, including the  
Spaces, Signature Group, OpenOffice,  
KORA and Express formats. 
T aking this approach means that we can 
support any organisation’s office needs, 
anywhere in the world. We provide a truly 
global and fast-growing network, with the 
right offer at the right price, in which it is  
easy to buy space for as little as a few hours 
or for several years. As part of this, we make 
best-of-breed products and services easily 
accessible to every member of the 
workforce, wherever they are and  
whatever their requirements. 
As we move ahead, we will have partnerships 
and alliances in place, building on those  
we already have with the likes of Microsoft, 
Google and Polycom, to bring customers 
those things that they cannot get for 
themselves. We will help customers  
become more productive, faster than  
ever before. In addition, we will increasingly 
provide the means for them to extract  
added value from their relationship with 
Regus, by collaborating, promoting their 
products and services to one another  
and participating in shared communities.
2016 outlook 
We remain confident in our business  
model and the long-term structural drivers 
of our industry. We will continue to invest  
to increase our levels of customer service, 
make our business relevant to a wider 
market, drive greater operational efficiency 
and deliver long-term shareholder value.  
We will continue to adhere to our strict 
financial criteria in executing our growth 
plans and remain suitably vigilant given the 
current global macroeconomic uncertainty, 
with flexibility in both our expansion plans 
and our cost base. Current trading is in line 
with management’s expectations and we 
remain confident in our prospects for 2016.

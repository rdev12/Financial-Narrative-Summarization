Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
A period of positive development
Results and dividend 
2009 was a record year for Amlin, as 
well as one of significant strategic progress. 
Pre-tax profits of £509.1 million and a return 
on equity of 37.0% sustained our long-term 
outperformance, as demonstrated by our 
weighted average return on equity of 29.1% 
since 2005. The 2009 results clearly benefited 
from a more favourable trading environment 
compared with the dual headwinds of major 
catastrophe losses and financial market 
turmoil of 2008, but they also reflect the 
continuing strength and diversity of 
Amlin’s business. 
The Board has decided to pay a second 
interim dividend, in lieu of a final dividend, of 
13.5 pence per share making total dividends 
declared for the year of 20.0 pence per share, 
a 17.6% increase over 2008. The second 
interim dividend will be paid on 31 March 
2010 to shareholders on the register at 
19 March 2010. 
Our goal remains to steadily grow the 
dividend. We also maintain the authority 
to buy back shares although we did not 
make any purchases in 2009.
Strategic progress
Amlin’s consistent record of performance is 
testament to the successful implementation 
of the Amlin Vision and investment in the 
five year strategy put in place in 2004. 
We believe we have achieved our principal 
goal of delivering long-term value to our 
shareholders, with a cross-cycle return on 
equity which is one of the strongest in the 
global non-life industry. Our consistently high 
level of client retention across the business 
shows that we have also remained focused 
on providing high standards of service and 
expertise to our global client base.
Amlin’s business has grown and 
diversified significantly since the Vision 
was first articulated, but the strength of our 
corporate culture and the stability of our team 
have meant that our core values have continued 
to underpin and drive our business. We have 
extended our management infrastructure 
and governance to facilitate the further 
growth envisaged in the next phase of 
our strategic plan and ensuring that we 
can sustain our culture and values into 
the future remains a key priority. 
During 2009 we reached a milestone in the 
development of one of our most important 
strategic investments. Amlin Bermuda, a 
2005 start up, paid its first dividend of 
$200 million to the Group in October 2009, 
followed by a further dividend of $169 million 
in February 2010. Amlin Bermuda was our 
first major foray away from the Lloyd’s 
market and is now a substantial and 
successful reinsurer in its own right. 
We also embarked on a major new 
strategic initiative with the acquisition 
of Fortis Corporate Insurance (now Amlin 
Corporate Insurance or ACI), which gives 
2009 was a landmark 
year in the development 
of Amlin. With our 
capital strength, 
the diversity of our 
business and the 
quality of our people, 
we are well positioned 
for the future.

us a substantial underwriting platform in 
Continental Europe from which to further 
develop our European presence alongside 
Anglo French Underwriters, which we 
acquired in 2008. We were pleased to 
welcome our new colleagues in ACI, who 
are already contributing their considerable 
experience and expertise to the task 
of integrating ACI into the Group and 
developing new business opportunities 
for the combined entity. 
We continued to invest in opportunities 
for profi table growth through further 
strengthening our existing underwriting 
teams and smaller acquisitions and 
investments focused on developing 
our distribution channels.
Outlook
Following excellent results in 2009 we are 
anticipating increased competition in the 
short term. However, the performance of 
our different classes of business will vary 
and Amlin’s excellent diversity of risk will 
continue to work to our advantage. 
We remain alert to continuing uncertainty 
in the wider economy and consequences 
such as changing regulatory regimes. Our 
response to a wide range of operational 
issues, including Solvency II, demonstrates 
that Amlin is more than ever focused 
on forward thinking and a willingness 
to embrace change. 
With our capital strength, well-established 
underwriting platforms in three major global 
markets, our strong relationships with brokers 
and clients and a wealth of talent and 
experience in the Amlin team, we are 
well positioned for the future.
Governance and the Board
As Amlin has developed from an exclusively 
Lloyd’s-based business prior to 2005 to the 
multi-platform Group that it is today, both our 
Board and executive governance structures 
have developed in order to maintain across 
a wider canvas the high standards of 
accountability and transparency to which 
we aspire. We believe that good governance 
reduces risk and adds value. 
We actively participated in the debate about 
the role of boards through submissions and 
discussion with the Financial Reporting 
Council in its review of the Combined Code 
Measuring our delivery

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
Committed to good governance
Our strong commitment to high standards of conduct and good governance is 
highlighted in the corporate governance section of this report on page 78.
The board believes that high standards of corporate governance are intrinsic to Amlin’s 
culture and values.
• They are central to fulfi lling many of Amlin’s core values such as integrity, 
professional excellence and sustainability.
• They underpin the objectivity of such processes as insurance reserving, risk 
management, balance sheet and investment management, the design and operation 
of executive remuneration and succession planning.
• They are the basis for the accountability of executive management to the Board and 
of the Board to shareholders.
2009 governance highlights
• Awarded 2009 ICSA Hermes Award for innovation in Governance Reporting.
• Fully compliant with the Combined Code on governance.
• Review of risk appetite and tolerances by category of risk.
• Improved reporting of risk to the Board.
• Overview and direction of the Group’s preparations for Solvency II.
• Transition of the Group’s governance arrangements refl ecting its continuing move 
from a Lloyd’s focus to a multi-platform international insurance group
(now to be the UK Corporate Governance 
Code). We await the fi nal outcome of this 
review later in 2010. In response both to this, 
and to our own changing circumstances, we 
have already made some refi nements to our 
approach, for example in the governance 
relationships between operating subsidiaries 
and the Group (both Board and executive) 
and in the area of risk governance. 
Ram Mylvaganam retired from the Board 
at the 2009 AGM, having given Amlin long 
and valued service which started at Murray 
Lawrence before the creation of Amlin. Ram 
was a loyal and supportive colleague over 
the years, not only to me but to many others 
within the Amlin organisation, and we are 
grateful to him. At the start of 2009, T ony 
Holt was welcomed back to the Board as 
a non-executive, following his retirement as 
Underwriting Director at the end of 2008. 
It is a tribute to the underwriting team and 
culture that T ony built and sustained that his 
colleagues have fi lled his executive shoes 
so effectively, and a great benefi t to the 
Group that his advice, counsel and challenge 
remain available in his new role. 
The Amlin team
2009 saw many valued additions to the 
Amlin team as we continue to position the 
business for future growth. As well as 
welcoming Patrick Coene and his team at 
ACI, we also broadened the executive team 
in areas such as Operations, Risk and 
Compliance as well as making senior 
appointments in Amlin London, Amlin UK and 
Amlin Bermuda. The quality of our people 
continues to be a core strength and I am 
delighted that we have further enhanced our 
capabilities in so many parts of the business. 
Our result this year is excellent. This is due 
to the outstanding performance of Charles 
Philipps, his management colleagues and all 
the employees who have been building the 
business of Amlin year by year. I would like to 
thank them all for their skill and hard work.

I am pleased to report another year of strong progress. 
The management team has continued to focus on our 
well-established strategy for developing the business, as 
well as keeping tight control on day to day operations. As 
a result, Dunelm has posted good growth in revenue and 
profits in the latest financial year, accompanied by further 
strong cash generation. More details are given by Nick 
Wharton, our Chief Executive, in his report.
Given the continuing strong business performance, the 
Board is able to recommend a 15% increase in the final 
dividend to 11.5p per share (2012: 10.0p), bringing the total 
ordinary dividends for the year to 16.0p (2012: 14.0p). We 
have also announced a special dividend of 25p per share, 
returning a further £50.7m of excess cash to shareholders.
The Board has continued to evolve over the last financial 
year with the appointment of a new Non-Executive 
Director, Liz Doherty. Liz joined the Board in May,  
bringing a wealth of experience across large retail and 
consumer businesses.
Looking ahead, we have a range of exciting development 
initiatives and in particular continue to see significant 
potential to expand our store portfolio further within the 
UK. We remain confident in the Dunelm proposition and 
look forward to further profitable growth.

Chairman

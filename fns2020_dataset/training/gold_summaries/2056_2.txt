Exploration and 
Production (E&P)
BG Group explores for, develops,
produces and markets gas and oil
around the world. Around 70% of 2007
production was gas. The Group uses its
technical, commercial and gas chain
skills to deliver projects at competitive
cost and to maximise the sales value 
of its hydrocarbons.
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
LNG is gas that has been cooled to 
a liquid form to make it easier to
transport. BG Group’s LNG activities
combine liquefaction and regasiﬁcation
facilities with the purchasing, shipping
and sale of LNG. 
Transmission and 
Distribution (T&D)
BG Group’s T&D activities are focused 
in fast-growing markets, developing
both markets and infrastructure for 
the delivery of gas.
Power Generation
A large proportion of the worldwide
demand for gas is attributable to 
power generation. BG Group develops,
owns and operates gas-ﬁred power
generation plants.

BG Group is engaged in the
exploration, development,
production, transmission,
distribution and supply of
natural gas. The Group also
has a number of power
generation business interests.
Gas reserves often require
complex chains of physical
infrastructure and
commercial agreements to
deliver the gas to markets.
BG Group has proven skills
and experience in creating
value from these chains.
BG Group is a rapidly growing global
energy business with interests in 
27 countries across ﬁve continents.

Overview
A reinvigorated Flybe
This year has seen a significant turnaround in  
financial performance as a result of the efforts taken  
to restructure the business. The £150.1m net raised in 
March 2014’s Firm Placing and Placing and Open Offer 
provides Flybe with strength and a firm foundation for 
profitable growth.  
Flybe’s structure and activities
As reported in our H1 2013/14 results announcement  
on 11 November 2013, the Group’s divisions have been 
removed and the business has been refocused into  
‘One Flybe’. We report three business segments:
“ 2013/14 has seen the rebirth of Flybe.”

Results
Flybe delivered a result for the year in line with  
market expectations. Revenue under management, 
including the full year impact of increased white label 
flying in Flybe Finland, increased 11.1% to £868.4m 
(2012/13: £781.5m). Group revenue increased 1.0%  
to £620.5m (2012/13: £614.3m). Adjusted EBITDAR 
before restructuring costs increased by 55.7% to 
£98.9m (2012/13: £63.5m), with an adjusted profit 
before tax, gains on revaluation of USD aircraft loans, 
net restructuring costs and surplus capacity costs of 
£1.7m (2012/13: loss of £23.6m) and a reported profit 
before tax of £8.1m (2012/13: loss of £41.1m).
This significant improvement in Flybe’s trading 
performance resulted mainly from the Turnaround 
Plans announced in January and May 2013, and the 
further Immediate Actions announced in November 
2013. Combined, these initiatives delivered cost savings 
of £47m in 2013/14, and this is expected to increase  
to £71m in 2014/15.
The Group’s balance sheet at 31 March 2014 had  
total cash, including restricted funds, of £218.4m  
at 31 March 2014 (2013: £54.7m), and net funds  
of £116.9m (2013: net debt of £66.3m).
The Business Review and Financial Review sections  
set out the full detail behind the 2013/14 results.
People
Our Turnaround Plan has involved considerable efforts  
to reduce the cost base of the business. Unfortunately, 
this process has resulted in the departure of over  
1,100 people from the business through redundancy, 
resignation or transfer to other organisations under  
TUPE arrangements. While only nine of these 
redundancies were compulsory, I do not underestimate 
the effect of these difficult decisions on those staff 
leaving and the friends and colleagues whom they  
left behind. 
On behalf of the entire Board, I would like to thank all 
of our employees both past and present for their hard 
work, support and resilience through what has proved 
to be a very challenging period for the business  
and its people.
Summary
2013/14 marks the rebirth of Flybe. Our turnaround 
plan has enabled the business to return to profitability. 
With our strengthened balance sheet following the 
£150.1m net fund raise, we can leverage our position as 
Europe’s largest regional airline and start to implement 
our twin-engine strategy of growing our UK branded 
business and our white label operations across Europe.
With the strengthening of our balance sheet, the Group 
is now stronger than it has ever been and is well placed 
to deliver future profitable growth and become 
Europe’s best local airline.

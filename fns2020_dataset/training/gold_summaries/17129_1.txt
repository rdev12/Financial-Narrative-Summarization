 William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006

2006 has seen the Group’s strategy of
generating organic growth, exploiting
new platforms and executing value-
enhancing acquisitions continue to deliver
long-term value for shareholders. The
Group produced a strong profit
performance in the period, fully
leveraging the benefits of the Stanley
Retail acquisition, which was completed in
June 2005. The year has also seen a strong
performance from FOBTs and the impact
of the World Cup, both of which have
boosted year-on-year gross win growth
while operating expenses continue to be
kept under tight control. Consequently,
profit on ordinary activities before interest,
taxation and exceptional items was up
19% to £292.2m (2005: £245.0m) and
earnings per share were 45.5p, a rise of
24% (after adjusting for last year’s
exceptional items) compared to 2005. 
In recognition of these excellent results,
the Board is recommending a final
dividend of 14.5 pence per share, taking
the full year dividend to 21.75 pence, an
increase of 19% on last year.
Retail channel
The Retail channel’s gross win grew by
18% to £736.0m (6% excluding Stanley
Retail) and pre-exceptional profit
increased by 24% to £225.9m (9%
excluding Stanley Retail). 
Within the original William Hill estate
(excluding Stanley Retail), total gross win
increased by 6% year-on-year. In this part
of the estate, gross win from over the
counter (OTC) was flat while FOBT/AWP
gross win was up 18%.
LBOs in the Stanley Retail estate
performed better year-on-year than those
in the original William Hill estate with
gross win growing by 7% for the full year
and second half gross win growth of 10%
achieved. For the year as a whole, FOBT
gross win grew by 18% and OTC gross
win increased by 4%. 
The average number of FOBTs in the
original William Hill estate increased to
6,034 (FY 2005: 5,892) in the period and in
the Stanley Retail estate the average
number of FOBTs was 1,567 compared to
1,539 in the second half of last year. The
average net profit per machine per week
in the William Hill estate was £494 (FY
2005: £402) and in the Stanley Retail
estate was £346 (second half of 2005:
£287). The improved profitability in both
estates was due to a combination of
greater gross win per machine and better
contractual terms with our main FOBT
supplier Leisure Link, which were effective
from May 2005. However, the imposition
of Amusement Machine Licence Duty in
August 2006 has adversely affected
average weekly profitability of each
terminal by £38.
The average number of AWPs traded in
the period fell to 303 in 2006 (FY 2005:
353) within the William Hill estate. In the
Stanley Retail estate, the average number
traded also fell from 386 AWPs in the
second half of last year to 314 in 2006. 
Non-exceptional costs in the channel
were up 16% (5% excluding Stanley
Retail). Excluding Stanley Retail, there
were minimal increases in staff costs due
to reduced overtime and premium
payments under the new LBO staff
employment contracts and productivity
improvements resulting from the
investment in EPOS. FOBT rentals fell due
to more favourable contractual terms,
which are exclusively profit-share based,
and AWP rentals fell due to the reduction
in the number of machines in the estate.
Savings were also made due to a higher
portion of VAT expense being recoverable
following the change in tax regime for
FOBTs. These savings were offset by
increased provisions for staff bonuses;
increases in rent and rates due to
increased LBO numbers and rent reviews;
higher energy costs reflecting general
market conditions; and depreciation and
maintenance charges as a result of
introducing new text and EPOS systems.
There were no exceptional costs in the
current year. The prior period exceptional
costs related to the integration of the
Stanley Retail acquisition.
We completed 233 development and LBO
refurbishment projects in 2006 including
50 new licences, 70 extensions and resites
and 113 LBO fittings. Overall, we spent
£40.1m on estate development in 2006. 
At 26 December 2006, we had 2,165 LBOs
in the United Kingdom, 9 in the Channel
Islands, 2 in the Isle of Man and 48 in the
Republic of Ireland; a total of 2,224. 
2006 has seen the introduction of the
capability to take a wider range of Tote
Direct bets across the estate, which has
been favourably received by our
customers. We also completed the rollout
of our new text system and an EPOS
system throughout the Stanley Retail
estate during the period and in
consequence the entire estate has been
running on identical systems since the
end of March. 
Telephone channel
Telephone gross win grew by 8% to
£57.5m and operating profit increased by
28% to £16.7m. 
The channel benefited from the World
Cup and increased football betting in
general as well as more normal
horseracing results. In addition there was
some favourable high roller activity
especially in the second half of the year.
Costs in the channel were up 5%
principally due to higher marketing spend
focused around the World Cup. 
We ended the year with 160,000 active
telephone customers (27 December 2005:
174,000).
Interactive channel
Interactive gross win increased 6% to
£130.5m and operating profit showed a
small increase to £61.5m. 
Growth in Interactive sportsbook gross
win was modest in the period when
compared to our expectations at the
beginning of the year. Since we launched
our Interactive channel in 1999, we have
fully exploited our legacy bookmaking
and client management systems but it
has become increasingly clear that the
Interactive sportsbook is being impacted
by the relative inflexibility of our current
technology configuration. Our NextGen
technology programme is designed to
rectify these issues and deliver systems
clearly superior to anything currently
available to our major competitors. By the
end of 2007, this programme is expected
to deliver a number of enhancements and
give us a flexible platform to more easily
introduce better products going forward.
We anticipate that these changes will be
undertaken alongside the technical
changes required by the Gambling
Commission, which are yet to be 
finalised.
Chief Executive’s Review
Chief Executive’s Review William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2006 5
Despite the limitations of our current
systems, we continued to increase our
range of in-running betting opportunities
on our sportsbook and we launched 10
new arcade games during the period that
expanded our offering to 20 games. 
Poker and Casino has also had a
challenging second half after an
encouraging start to the year. These
products have been affected by strong
competition particularly following the
withdrawal of many operators from the
US market in September 2006, which has
impacted poker site liquidity in general
and made the competition for European
customers more intense. We continue to
have confidence in the long-term
prospects of these products and in
December 2006, we extended our
contract with our poker and casino
software partner, Cryptologic. As part of
the new contract, Cryptologic have made
a significant commitment in respect of
game and other product development. 
In October 2006, we decided to close our
Interactive TV (WHTV) channel following a
review of its operations and the
conclusion of a trial broadcast of its
content into our LBOs. Whilst we have
exited this particular arrangement, we
remain committed to the strategy of
supplying customers with a means to
place bets on an interactive TV platform
and of supplying tailored content to our
own LBOs, once we have identified a
profitable and cost effective means of
doing so. 
In January 2007, we launched internet skill
gaming in partnership with
GameAccount, the world’s largest
integrated network of skill-based games.
Accessible through a tab on William Hill’s
homepage, the fully integrated browser-
based skill games available on the site
include multiplayer blackjack, gin rummy
and backgammon. We also launched an
interactive bingo game in partnership
with Virtue Fusion in January. Early
indications of trading from both these
ventures are encouraging. 
Total active accounts increased to 405,000
as at 26 December 2006 (27 December
2005: 341,000). 
Costs in the channel increased 10%
mainly due to higher marketing spend,
higher technology charges and closure
costs of WHTV.
Operating expenses
Expenses (net of operating income) for
the Group were £445.3m, an increase of
15% (6% excluding Stanley Retail). 
Excluding Stanley Retail, staff costs (which
represented roughly half of our total
costs) increased 7% in 2006, mainly
reflecting provisions for profit based
incentive schemes. Excluding these
provisions from this period and the
comparative period, staff costs have risen
by 2% reflecting a 3% general pay award
and an increase in the number of LBOs
now trading, partly offset by an
improvement in productivity driven by
the rollout of EPOS. Property costs, which
represented 17% of our total costs, were
up 12% over the comparable period
reflecting higher energy costs and
increases in rent and rates, in part driven
by an increase in average LBO size and an
increase in the number of LBOs.
Depreciation costs increased 38% with the
full year effects of the rollout of EPOS and
text systems along with the supporting
technology, although this was partly
offset by staff costs savings. The cost of
providing pictures and data to our LBOs
was up 7% over the comparable period
due to the increased size of the estate and
price increases. Advertising and marketing
costs were up 22% over the comparable
period reflecting World Cup and other
more general web-based advertising and
promotions. 
Stanley acquisition
The integration of the Stanley Retail estate
was completed by the end of March 2006
in accordance with the plans we drew up
in 2005. Key tasks achieved in 2006 were
the completion of the re-branding of the
LBOs, installation throughout the Stanley
Retail estate of the same version of EPOS
and audio-visual text systems already
deployed in the William Hill estate and the
closure of the Stanley Retail head office.
The Stanley Retail estate has delivered
strong gross win growth in 2006,
particularly in the second half with gross
win growth of 10% achieved year-on-year.
We remain confident that the acquisition
will deliver the synergies and other
benefits of up to £20m we anticipated at
the end of 2005, which compares
favourably with the original estimated
synergies at the time of the acquisition of
£13m.
Regulatory development
The Gambling Commission has now been
established and the Commission and
DCMS are in the process of developing
the regulations, conditions, standards and
guidance under the Gambling Act 2005
and the Commission will take over its
duty to promote the licensing objectives
under the Act with effect from 
1 September 2007.
The Group is preparing for the
implementation of these detailed
requirements. We have been heavily
involved in dialogue with the Commission
both by ourselves and via our trade
associations, with a view to ensuring that
appropriate and proportionate regulations
are implemented. However, we remain

concerned that certain requirements have
yet to be finalised, while the technical
standards for the remote businesses have
recently been published for consultation
with finalised documentation not
expected to be available until June. We
are concerned that insufficient time is
being given to the industry to enable full
compliance with these technical
standards from the beginning of
September. We will continue to hold
discussions with the Commission to press
for this and other issues to be resolved in
a practical way. 
We also look forward to the proposed
deregulation that the Gambling Act
enables, such as extended betting shop
opening hours and the installation of
higher payout gaming machines, both 
of which will be permitted from 
1 September 2007.
Cost of content
On 14 December 2006, the Government
announced that it had decided to retain
the Horserace Betting Levy Board and the
associated horserace betting levy scheme.
This follows the publication of the
findings of a report compiled by an
independent committee under the
chairmanship of Lord Donoghue. This
committee was established to investigate
whether there was any alternative
commercial arrangements that could
replace the current levy scheme but
concluded that, currently, there was not a
secure and alternative funding
mechanism for horseracing. At the same
time, the Government announced its
intention to modernise the existing levy
mechanism by reducing as many of the
administrative burdens as possible. We
welcome the Government’s intentions to
modernise the scheme and we remain
committed to providing a fair and
equitable financial contribution
supporting the UK horseracing industry.
SIS, a company partly owned by the
Group is currently the sole provider of UK
horse racing pictures and data content to
bookmakers. SIS (via the betting industry)
has contracts, which expire at the end of
2007 with a number of UK racecourses to
broadcast pictures and data to LBOs.
Recently a proposed joint venture
between Alphameric and Racing UK has
claimed to have secured exclusive
transmission rights from up to 30 UK
racecourses from the beginning of 2008.
This would mean that SIS would not be
able to transmit pictures from these 30
tracks (except when they are generally
available via terrestrial coverage) once its
current contracts expire. If this happens,
we will have to decide whether to have
two different sources of pictures from the
beginning of 2008 if we want to maintain
coverage of these horse tracks within our
LBOs. This could imply an extra cost for us
but also an inferior service for customers,
as the co-ordination of the timing and
broadcasting of events achieved by SIS
would not be possible with two different
transmission sources. In the event that we
decide to take the service offered by the
proposed joint venture, we plan to seek
an appropriate reduction in the level of
our current funding of the UK horseracing
industry via the levy scheme. 
International activities
In July 2006, the Group signed a non-
binding memorandum of understanding
with the Spanish gaming group Codere.
Codere is a company dedicated to the
private gaming sector in Europe and Latin
America. With more than 25 years
experience, it operates slot machines,
bingo halls, sports betting outlets,
racetracks and casinos in Spain, Italy,
Central and South America.
The parties plan to create a joint venture
to develop a sports betting business in
Spain. Spain is one of the largest
gambling markets in Europe and the
region of Madrid has recently published
(and several of Spain’s regions are now
developing) legislation to regulate sports
betting, allowing the establishment of
land-based businesses. The parties are
planning to apply jointly for a licence in
Madrid shortly and intend to apply in
other regions in Spain if regulations are
passed which make such applications
attractive.
The Group has established a joint venture
company with Codere relating to the
Italian gambling sector. Following a
tendering process in 2006, the Group and
Codere were jointly awarded concessions
to exploit licences issued as part of the
tender process launched in August 2006
by the Italian regulatory authority. The
award comprises 20 concessions to
operate horseracing betting shops, 7
concessions to operate sports betting
shops and 28 concessions relating to
sports betting points. Remote licences
relating to horseracing and sports betting
were also applied for and granted. In
addition to activating these units the
proposed joint venture intends to
evaluate other opportunities for growth in
the Italian market.
Dividends and capital
structure
The Company is proposing to pay a final
dividend of 14.5 pence per share (2005:
12.2 pence per share) on 5 June 2007 to
shareholders on the register on 27 April
2007. The 19% increase in the proposed
final dividend reflects the strong
performance achieved in 2006 and our
confidence about the Group’s future
prospects.
Following the acquisition of Stanley Retail
in June 2005, the Board considered the
optimal capital structure and financing
arrangements for William Hill. In
September 2005, the Board announced it
intended to maintain an efficient and
flexible capital structure and would
achieve these objectives by targeting a
ratio of net debt to earnings before
exceptional items, interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of
approximately 3.5 times to be achieved
over the medium term. A new five-year
bank facility of £250m was arranged in
June 2006 to underpin this objective and
the Board announced with its interim
results that they were increasing the total
buy-back programme from the previously
announced target of £200m – £300m, to
circa £320m – £400m by the end of 2007.
By the end of December 2006, the Group
net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.3 and
£257.0m had been returned by means of
on-market share buy-backs.
As we are now close to our target
leverage and as we have current
investment commitments, both
internationally through our joint ventures
with Codere and domestically in respect
of some retail bolt-on acquisitions, we
currently estimate that the pace of our
rolling share buyback programme in 2007
is likely to slow. We remain committed to
returning surplus capital to shareholders
and our buyback programme will be kept
under regular review.

Chairman’s statement
2008/9 was an excellent year for 
the Group and these results are the 
best that Braemar has reported. 
Revenue increased by 26% from £101.0 million to 
£127.1 million, proﬁ t before tax from continuing operations 
increased by 10% from £14.7 million to £16.2 million and 
earnings per share from continuing operations rose by 16% 
to 56.70 pence from 48.99 pence in 2007/8. The Group is 
ﬁ nancially strong, with cash balances increasing over the 
year from £21.6 million to £25.2 million at 28 February 2009.
Shipping has enjoyed an unprecedented boom over the past 
three years. Since August 2008, with the contraction of credit 
and weaker economies, freight rates and vessel values have 
reverted to pre-boom levels. Our activity is higher than we 
might have expected with transaction volumes remaining 
steady and the strength of the US dollar has a positive effect 
on our results. Our non-broking businesses have begun the 
new ﬁ nancial year strongly and demand for their services 
remains good. Overall the prospects for the year are positive. 
Shipbroking enjoyed a very strong ﬁ rst half in buoyant markets 
which rapidly changed from August 2008 with the onset of the 
credit crisis and global recession. Global trade experienced 
a signiﬁ cant slowdown in the ﬁ nal calendar quarter of 2008, 
since when there has been a stabilisation in shipping rates 
at pre-boom levels. The dry bulk and container markets, 
which are driven by the demand for raw materials and 
consumer goods, both suffered large falls and more 
recently the reduction in oil demand has led to a fall in the 
demand for tankers. While we are seeing renegotiations 
and cancellations of some charters and newbuildings in 
the wider market place, to date our forward order book 
has not suffered signiﬁ cantly. We anticipate expanding our 
shipbroking ofﬁ ce network overseas.

4 Braemar Shipping Services plc Annual Report 2009 The performance of our Technical division has been particularly 
pleasing following the investments made in acquiring Braemar 
Falconer in July 2007 and Braemar Steege in March 2008, 
both of which were rebranded to include the Braemar name 
during the year. Together with Wavespec, these businesses 
have contributed annual operating proﬁ ts before amortisation 
of £4.2 million and have signiﬁ cantly expanded the Group’s 
global reach and skill sets within the marine services sector.
The Logistics division – Cory Brothers – had a busy year 
in both forwarding and ship agency and successfully 
amalgamated the forwarding businesses in one building in 
Felixstowe following the purchase of Fred. Olsen Freight 
in December 2007. 
The Environmental division – Braemar Howells – recorded a 
small loss following the exceptionally strong year in 2007/8, 
as a result of weak activity levels in its incident response 
business, which offset good performances in the industrial 
and international services sections of the business.
The Directors are recommending for approval at the Annual 
General Meeting a ﬁ nal dividend of 15.5 pence per ordinary 
share, to be paid on 28 July 2009 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 3 July 2009. Together 
with the 8.5 pence interim dividend the Company’s dividend 
for the year is 24.0 pence (2008: 23.0 pence), a rise of 4%. 
The dividend is covered 2.4 times by earnings.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank all of our staff 
around the world for their combined hard work and skill. 
In a year of such economic change their experience and 
commitment has been and will continue to be invaluable.

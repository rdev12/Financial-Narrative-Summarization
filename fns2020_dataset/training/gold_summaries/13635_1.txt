Update
In summary, I would say that we have 
consolidated our position during 2010 
and have made steady progress in 
moving the development of our core 
assets forward. At the same time we 
have de-risked our portfolio by 
moving away from those non-core 
assets that presented higher risked 
returns at higher costs than we could 
realistically afford.
We faced some challenges with delays 
in obtaining the necessary licenses to 
move our core asset’s operations 
forward during the year, particularly for 
Galaz, due to the re-organization at the 
Government’s Ministries that occurred 
part way through the year, which added 
to the normal timeframe for obtaining 
the necessary approvals to progress 
our projects.  We also more recently 
were informed by our partner 
Canamens that they decided not to 
provide all of the funding under their 
agreement to acquire an interest in 
BNG LLP . This presents us with some 
short term challenges in meeting our 
immediate cash obligations which will 
be met through an additional financing 
arrangement that we have now agreed 
with Vertom International NV via a new 
loan facility of US$6 million. 
As well as the new financing 
arrangement that we have put in place 
with Vertom, we have also recently 
agreed with Canamens to cancel the 
sale of the 35% interest in BNG. This 
was considered to be in the best 
interests of both parties and will allow 
Roxi to seek alternate financing 
solutions for the continued 
development of the BNG asset. 
Canamens also agreed to novate their 
loans back to Roxi Plc in return for 
Roxi agreeing to pay to Canamens a 
form of royalty payment based on 
future production achieved from BNG 
LLP. All of these arrangements will 
ensure that we are able to achieve our 
aim to further develop the potential 
from the BNG asset and at the same 
time clear the way for a new financing 
solution to be put in place for BNG.
We also recently received final 
approvals for the extension of the NW 
Konys license area as well as the 
exploration license itself has been 
approved and extended for a further 
two years as well as the pilot 
production license being awarded to 
us, so we are well placed together 
with our new farm-out partner LGI, to 
move this asset to production later 
this year. We are in a similar position 
on BNG with our pilot production 
license on South Yelemes recently 
being awarded to us. Our plan is to 
move both assets to pilot production, 
as soon as the emissions licenses 
have been granted to us by the 
Ministry of Oil and Gas.
We are still waiting for final approval 
and completion for the sale of our 
interest in Ravninnoe and expect that 
this will complete during 2011. In 
respect of the sale of Munaily, we are 
currently re-negotiating the sale to 
BTC which when first negotiated, 
wanted to acquire 59% of Munaily. 
We are now looking to sell our entire 
interest in this asset and are 
re-negotiating our terms with the 
buyer. The Group’s remaining focus 
will be on Beibars where we plan to 
farm-out part of our interest to an 
investor willing to fund the drilling of 
exploratory wells that will enable us to 
assess the potential of this asset.
We continue to maintain our focus on 
cost reduction initiatives and are 
currently reviewing the possible 
restructuring of our holding 
companies structure in 2011. This will 
enable a much more efficient and 
transparent legal structure going 
forward and should enable further 
cost reductions to be achieved in 
addition to those put in place in 2010.
Strategy
Our strategy in the near-term remains 
committed to finding new farm-out 
partners for BNG and Beibars as well 
as achieving production from BNG 
and Galaz, which are now close to 
achieving pilot production, with oil 
discoveries having already been 
made on both assets and with the 
majority of the licensing and 
associated permits now in place to 
start pilot production in the latter part 
of 2011. This will allow us to develop 
Galaz and move onto exploration of

RXP2635 - AR10 Front AW11.indd   12 20/05/2011   16:50 deeper horizons in BNG where  
we believe much greater potential 
can be exploited based on the 
results from our recent 3D seismic 
work completed.
As we move to pilot production from 
our two core assets we will also look 
for further acquisitions into producing 
assets in Kazakhstan.
Financing Arrangements
The completion of the previously 
announced LG deal in January 2011 
provided not only the funding 
necessary for the further 
development of the NW Konys field 
but also funds that helped Roxi 
repay some of its short term loans 
as well as much needed additional 
short-term financing for Roxi’s fixed 
costs going forward. 
In terms of the financing of BNG, 
now that we have cancelled the deal 
with Canamens this will allow us to 
find an alternative financing solution 
for the BNG project. This will remain 
a priority in the near term to enable 
us to fund the exploration and 
development of the BNG operations 
going forward.
Financial Highlights
The Consolidated Income Statement 
on page 25 still reflects the fact that we 
have historically been an exploration 
company with no commercial 
production to date. The results for the 
year were impacted by the impairment 
of our Ravninnoe asset after our 
decision to sell our Ravninnoe interest. 
Additionally the partial disposal of our 
interest in BNG to Canamens released 
some of the unrealized currency 
translation losses that had been 
capitalized prior to the devaluation of 
the national currency. 
The advances received from the LGI 
deal which completed in January 
2011 enabled us to repay some of 
our loans to shareholders that fell 
due during the course of 2010. This 
was important to protect shareholder 
value and prevent the possibility of 
further dilution of the shareholder 
interests in Roxi. At the same time 
the proceeds from the disposal of 
the 40% interest in Galaz and 
Company LLP, provided useful cash 
injection into the Group that will 
sustain us whilst we prepare for pilot 
production from our two core assets 
in the latter part of 2011. These 
factors, together with the cost 
reduction initiatives put in place 
during 2010, will mean that we are in 
a much better position to finance our 
transition to production and 
cashflows than in the past and have 
managed to convert some of our 
historical short term financing 
arrangements to longer  
term debt with our partners that will  
be repaid out of initial production  
from our assets.
Infrastructure
Roxi’s activities are run out of our 
principal office in Almaty. 
Staffing
The Roxi Group now employs in total 
86 staff, all of whom are based in 
Kazakhstan. We have 62 in Almaty 
and 24 in the regional and field 
offices. Of these employees 9 are 
technical staff, 17 are financial staff, 
14 are operational staff and 46 fulfil 
other activities. 79 of our staff are 
Kazakh nationals.
Changes to the Board and executive 
management team have been 
summarised in the Chairman’s report. 
Social Programmes
Under Kazakh regulations part of our 
obligations under various work 
programmes on the assets in which 
we have interest are paid in the form 
of contributions to local social 
programmes. In 2010 Roxi made 
significant contributions to: 
•	 Kyzylorda region social fund  
$211,500 (Galaz); and
•	 Mangistau regional social 
obligation fund $625,000 (BNG).
These contributions, while 
mandatory, help secure the good 
standing of the Company with the 
local regional authorities and with 
centrally based regulators. Roxi is 
pleased to have assisted in the 
developments of these projects. 
Environmental
No significant environmental issues 
have surfaced at any of the properties 
acquired to date. Compliance with 
environmental regulatory bodies is 
being managed from both the 
Kyzyl-Orda and Almaty offices.
Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan continues to develop  
and is constantly improving its legal 
framework and tax legislation to 
achieve the right balance between  
the need to encourage new 
investment into Kazakhstan and 
existing companies who operate 
business in Kazakhstan and the 
State. Operating in Kazakhstan in 
such times of evolution can from time 
to time present challenges. 
As a Kazakh based operation, with a 
majority of Asian investors we believe 
we are ideally placed to deal with any 
issues as they arise and see, in the 
medium-term, some of the difficulties 
being encountered by other less 
integrated international companies 
 as an opportunity for growth.
Outlook
We look forward with confidence as 
both of our core assets move closer 
to production in 2011, bringing 
much more stability to Roxi’s 
operations going forward. We will 
continue to be challenged with 
finding the right financing solutions 
for the exploration of some of the 
deeper prospects on BNG, however, 
we believe that with this in place, 
together with the ongoing 
development of the NW Konys field, 
the transformation process for Roxi 
will be complete, moving us from an 
exploration Company to an oil 
producer and ultimately realizing 
value for our shareholders.

Group at a Glance
888 has made several strategic changes to address 
evolving challenges in the e-gaming industry. The Group has 
transformed its business from being a consumer focused 
casino and poker operator into two separate lines of 
business: “B2C” and “B2B”, each of which has a separate 
mangement structure.
888 now offers consumers worldwide all four core B2C 
product offerings: Casino, Poker, Bingo and Sportsbetting as
well as Live Dealer and Backgammon. We are experiencing 
rapid growth especially in our B2C’s “Emerging Offering” 
which includes Bingo, Sportsbook, Live Dealer Casino and 
Backgammon.
888 is also developing its B2B business line and is becoming 
a leading provider of technology, operations and know-how 
to business partners, using its existing capabilities. 888 is 
uniquely positioned to work with carefully selected strategic 
partners who are either aiming to monetise their existing 
database, brand loyalty and media assets or looking to 
enhance their existing online gaming operations.  
888 has already secured a number of high profile agreements
which highlight both the potential of this strategic direction 
and 888’s unique position as a leading operator offering a full 
service model in the B2B field. These include partnerships in 
2007 with Riley’s, Tower Torneos and LuckyAce. 2008 has
seen an acceleration in B2B development with several more
deals in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, including 
the groundbreaking partnership with the UK Football Pools 
(Sportech Plc) highlighting the potential for 888 in this area. 
The development and growth of the B2B business is an 
integral part of 888’s growth strategy for 2009 and beyond.

Centamin at a glance
Sukari has been operating since 2010 
and has an estimated 20‑year mine life 
based on the 8.2 million ounce reserve 
(as at 30 September 2013), with 
significant potential for further growth.
Centamin remains in a robust position to continue delivering 
on its track record of production growth and solid free 
cash flow generation, as shown by the following highlights 
from 2014:
•	 production of 377,261 ounces, a 6% increase on 2013 
and a 5th successive year of production growth;
•	 cash cost of production of US$729 per ounce;
•	 average realised gold price of US$1,257 per ounce; 
•	 completion of the US$331.2 million Stage 4 
expansion project; and
•	 processing throughput exceeded the expanded 10Mtpa 
plant nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter.
Our flagship project, the large‑scale and low‑cost 
Sukari Gold Mine, is located in the eastern desert  
of Egypt where production is rapidly increasing to  
an annualised rate of 450,000‑500,000 ounces.

Open pit mining Underground mining
Open pit mining operation
The open pit delivered total material movement of 44,820kt 
for the year, an increase of 7% on the prior year. 
Sukari Hill exploration
Surface drilling from January to April 2014 continued 
in the northern portions of the Sukari Hill deposit 
(through the Ra and Gazelle zones and into the northern 
Pharaoh Zone).
Regional exploration
Seven other prospects besides Sukari Hill have been 
identified on the 160km
2
 Sukari tenement area and 
exploration is being conducted under the principle that 
ore from these prospects would be trucked to the existing 
processing plant.
Underground mining operation
Ore production from the underground mine was a record 
968kt, a 65% increase on 2013.
Amun and Ptah declines
A total of 6,625m of development was completed, including 
5,701m which was mineralised (4,737m in Amun, and 961m 
in Ptah) and associated with stoping blocks planned for 
mining in 2015‑17. 
Sukari underground exploration
Drilling from underground remains a focus of the Sukari 
exploration programme and was progressively stepped 
up during the year. Continued underground development 
provided improved access to test potential high‑grade 
extensions of the deposit, which remains open to the north 
and at depth.  Strategic report

Processing
The Sukari plant processed 8.4Mt of ore in 2014, a 48% 
increase on 2013 (5.7Mt), reflecting the commencement 
of ore treatment through the new Stage 4 plant 
circuit. The Stage 4 expansion project represented 
US$331.2 million of capital expenditure to double the 
processing plant’s nameplate capacity from five million 
tonnes per annum (“Mtpa”) to 10Mtpa. Commissioning of 
the new circuit was successfully completed in the second 
half of 2014. Centamin plc Annual report 2014 | 09

Advanced exploration: Burkino Faso
In March, Centamin acquired ASX‑listed Ampella Mining 
Limited, thus gaining exploration rights over a highly 
prospective circa 2,200km
2
 region of Burkina Faso (“Batie 
West”) containing a 1.9Moz Indicated and 1.3Moz Inferred 
resource at the Konkera Prospect. Fieldwork is aimed at 
expanding the near‑surface resource through a systematic 
drilling, sampling and surveying programme over the 
numerous highly prospective target areas within this district.
Early stage exploration
Centamin’s portfolio also includes early stage exploration in 
highly prospective areas of Côte d’Ivoire and Ethiopia.
Côte d’Ivoire
As part of the Ampella transaction, Centamin acquired three 
licences in Côte d’Ivoire covering a circa 1,200km
2
 area 
across the border from Batie West in Burkina Faso. A further 
four licences are under application.
An ongoing programme of mapping, rock chip sampling 
auger drilling and geochemistry is aimed at processing a 
rapid and efficient assessment of the exploration permits 
potential and then either move prospects into advanced 
exploration or move to new permit areas.
Ethiopia
Centamin continued exploration on its tenement in Una 
Deriem in northern Ethiopia, and in total, 2,547.9m were 
drilled in 2014 bringing total drilling for the region to 
13,783m. A new licence known as the ‘Ondonok Dabus’ 
Licence was awarded and regional works are under way. 
A limited exploration programme was carried out on two 
licence areas under joint venture with AIM‑listed Alect o 
Minerals. Initial results were not as anticipated and as such 
led to the cancellation of this agreement in early 2015. 
Centamin’s portfolio includes advanced exploration 
in Burkina Faso and early exploration in Ethiopia and 
Côte d’Ivoire.

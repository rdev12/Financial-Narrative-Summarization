Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 2 Financial highlights
• Gross written premium for Ongoing operations
1,2
 up 3.9% 
to £3,274.1m (2015: £3,152.4m), driven by growth in 
Motor and Home own-brand in-force policies (up 4.3%)
• 2016 results reflect the one-off impact of using the new 
Ogden discount rate of minus 0.75%. Operating profit  
from Ongoing operations of £403.5m (pre-Ogden  
discount rate reduction
3
: £578.6m; 2015: £520.7m)  
and profit before tax of £353.0m (pre-Ogden
3
: £570.3m;  
2015: £507.5m). Return on tangible equity
1,2
 of 14.2%, 
(pre-Ogden
3
: 20.2%; 2015: 18.5%)
• Combined operating ratio
1
 from Ongoing operations of 
97.7% (pre-Ogden
3
: 91.8%; 2015: 94.0%), increased  
as a result of the reduction in the Ogden discount rate, 
partially offset by improved current-year underwriting 
performance and favourable weather claims. Adjusted  
for normal weather and before the Ogden discount  
rate change, the combined operating ratio was 93.5%, 
towards the lower end of the target range of 93% to 95%
• 5.4% increase in final dividend per share to 9.7 pence per 
share, (2015: 9.2 pence). Total dividends per share for 
2016, including special interim dividend of 10.0 pence 
per share paid in September 2016 following the approval 
of the Group’s partial internal model (“PIM”), of 24.6 
pence per share (2015: 50.1 pence) 
• The Group’s estimated Solvency II capital coverage ratio
4
 
post dividend is 165%, above the middle of the Group’s 
risk appetite range of 140% – 180% (pre-dividend: 174%)
Strategic and operational highlights
• Direct Line Motor and Home new business growth at the 
highest annual level since IPO, demonstrating the success of 
the investment in brand, proposition and customer service
• Total costs for Ongoing operations of £923.7m broadly 
flat year on year before non-cash impairment charge of 
£39.3m, after absorbing £24.1m Flood Re levy and 
supporting growth in Motor and Home own brands
• Extended Home and Private Insurance partnership with  
RBS for a further three years, and implemented faster and 
easier sales journeys using cloud-based technology making 
connectivity and future change easier 
• Invested in innovation, including partnership with PSA 
Peugeot Citroën for telematics extended for 4 more years, 
introducer role developed with Tesla, and MOVE_UK 
project brought into data collection stage 
• Received approval from the Prudential Regulation Authority 
(“PRA”) to use the Group’s Solvency II PIM
We had a successful 2016, absorbing a reduction in the discount rate 
applicable to personal injury lump sum damages awards to minus 0.75% 
and the Flood Re levy, while at the same time investing in the business  
and making progress on implementing our strategy. Our investments in  
our direct brands, competitiveness on price comparison websites and 
partnership capabilities are bearing fruit.

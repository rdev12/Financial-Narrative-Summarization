 02 Phytopharm plc Report and accounts 2007
Chairman ’s statement and Chief Executive’s review
Chairman ’s  
statement
Phytopharm ’s business strategy of developing 
pharmaceutical products and functional foods 
from medicinal plants is appealing and the 
Company has an impressive portfolio of 
innovative products in areas of high unmet 
health needs. With the new management 
team in place, the business has a clear vision 
and strong growth potential. 
Non-Executive Directors are closely involved 
with the governance of the Company and we 
form the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Of particular satisfaction is the high quality of 
internal operational and financial controls the 
Group maintains.
My Non-Executive Director colleagues and 
I continue to be impressed by the quality of 
people in the business and their energy and 
commitment. The Board and management team 
have a keen focus on the creation of shareholder 
value and a series of strategic objectives have 
been put in place to achieve this goal. We look 
forward to developing our products further 
and delivering on our objectives in 2008.
Alistair Taylor
Non-Executive Chairman
I was delighted to be invited to 
join the Board of Directors as 
Non-Executive Chairman in

I am pleased to report that 
Phytopharm is making good 
progress in developing a broad, 
balanced portfolio of products 
with diversified risk and 
substantial potential value.

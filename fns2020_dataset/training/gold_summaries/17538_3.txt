I am delighted to deliver my maiden statement as 
n on-Executive c hairman of yc O g roup and I thank 
my predecessor, peter Jay for his continued support 
and hard work during his tenure, which saw a critical 
period of transition for the g roup. 
t hrough the continued restructuring of the g roup, 
I am pleased to report that yc O has significantly 
increased its profitability and it remains wholly 
focused on maintaining this trend. 
In 2010, yc O continued to extend its reach 
worldwide. a permanent presence in the m iddle East 
was established in d oha and the g roup continues to 
explore opportunities to increase its levels of activity 
across a wider geographical base.
t he board was strengthened during the period 
with Ian petts appointed as f inance d irector, after 
serving yc O in monaco since 2008 and Rishi malliwal, 
an experienced corporate lawyer, joining as n on-
Executive d irector.

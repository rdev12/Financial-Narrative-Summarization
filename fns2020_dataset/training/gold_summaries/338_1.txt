I am pleased to report good growth 
across our major Business Units 
despite foreign exchange headwinds. 
With more than 75% of our sales 
outside the U.K., our business is truly 
international and therefore affected 
by currency fluctuations.
Branded Direct
The Branded Direct Business Unit 
reports sales of our branded 
products through our own sales 
forces in the U.K., Germany and 
Czech Republic. Its revenue grew 3% 
to £23.6 million (2013: £22.9 million) 
and by 6% at constant currency.
ActivHeal®
ActivHeal®, which delivers a range of 
woundcare dressings that offer 
significant cost savings without 
compromising on clinical outcomes 
or patient care, continues to be a 
compelling proposition for the NHS. 
Sales of our ActivHeal® range 
increased by 8% to £6.0 million (2013: 
£5.5 million). We are encouraged by 
the most recent data confirming that 
AMS had further increased its market 
share to 7.1% (2013: 5.5%) at the end 
of 2014. Encouragingly, ActivHeal® 
has had a strong start to 2015 with a 
number of tender and formulary wins 
from new NHS Hospital Trusts and 
we expect increased growth 
throughout the year. 
LiquiBand®
We continue to make good progress in 
the U.K. with LiquiBand®. In the 
Accident and Emergency Room (A&E) 
sales grew 8% to £2.6 million (2013: 
£2.5 million) and sales into the 
Operating Room (OR) increased 34% 
to £0.6 million (2013: £0.45 million).
AMS’s products have been used in 
A&E for a number of years and the 
good growth we have seen reflects 
the progress made by our focused 
sales team in this sector. The U.K. 
surgical sales team, now in its second 
year, is accessing the OR with a 
growing range of products that now 
includes sutures and haemostats. 
This team will also start selling 
LiquiBand® Fix8™, our hernia mesh 
fixation device.
Sales of LiquiBand® in Germany were 
flat at £1.4 million at a reported level, 
but increased by 5% at constant 
currency. Steady progress is 
expected to continue in Germany.
RESORBA®
Sales of RESORBA® branded 
products in Germany and the Czech 
Republic were slightly lower at £13.0 
million (2013: £13.1 million) at a 
reported level and increased by 4% 
at constant currency. Sales of 
haemostats increased by 12% at 
constant currency to £3.6 million 
(2013: £3.4 million) and sales of 
sutures and collagens into the dental 
market were unchanged at £3.8 
million, whilst sales of sutures into 
hospitals grew 2%, reversing the 
decline reported in 2013.
Although the German suture market 
continues to be challenging and is 
expected to remain so over the next 
year, we believe we are well placed to 
benefit from the competitive pressures 
in the market with our extensive range 
of competitively priced products. Our 
German commercial operations were 
strengthened by the appointment of a 
national sales manager in February 
2015. The introduction of the LiquiBand® 
Fix8™ device is also expected to 
support progress in 2015 and we are 
reviewing the optimal way to service 
the dental market in Germany which 
involves multiple call points.
In the U.K., we are actively working 
on a number of hospital tenders and 
evaluations with the goal of 
becoming the main suture supplier 
to those hospitals. We believe our 
ability to supply a comprehensive 
range of top quality sutures that 
provide cost savings to hospitals is 
compelling. Winning any one of 
these current evaluations would 
significantly increase the presence 
of our brand in the U.K..
In R&D, our focus is on extending 
the attributes of our collagens to 
meet the needs of dental 
practitioners and oral surgeons. 
We expect to obtain approval for 
an enhanced collagen cone in 2015 
as well as making good progress in 
including new antibiotics in our 
haemostats. 
Branded Distributed
The Branded Distributed Business 
Unit reports the sales of our brands 
through distributors in territories 
where we do not have a national 
sales team.
Branded Distributed revenue was 17% 
higher at £10.2 million (2013: £8.8 
million) and 24% higher at constant 
currency. The main contributor to 
this growth was LiquiBand® sales in 
the U.S., which totalled £4.1 million 
and accounted for 40% of total sales. 22

LiquiBand® in the U.S.
Sales of LiquiBand®in the U.S. 
increased by 36% to £4.1 million 
(2013: £3.0 million) and by 43% 
at constant currency. The new 
distribution partner added at the end 
of 2013 performed well throughout 
the year and contributed to the 
growth in sales alongside existing 
partners. Given the high level of sales 
in the second half of 2013, which 
included some pipeline filling at the 
end of the year, our sales growth 
performance in 2014 was particularly 
strong. The latest data for December 
2014 shows our volume market share 
increasing to 7%, up from 6% at July 
2014, in the U.S. hospital sector, while 
our volume market share in the U.S. 
non-hospital, or alternate site market 
is now estimated at 19%, up from 18% 
at July 2014. 
We launched our 2-octyl 
cyanoacrylate formulation with one 
of our existing distribution partners 
in the second half of 2014 and have 
already added additional partners 
since the start of 2015. A strength 
of the business is the range of 
formulations of cyanoacrylate on 
offer, including very fast setting 
formulations with applicators 
allowing for quick, precision closure, 
and film-forming formulations that 
provide a barrier layer over wounds 
as well as closing the wound itself. 
With formulations that have 
properties in between, we have 
products that can accommodate 
the full spectrum of wound closing 
needs. 
LiquiBand® in Europe and ROW
Elsewhere, within Europe and R.O.W, 
LiquiBand® sales through our 
distributors, continued to show good 
growth, with our distributors in 
France and Italy continuing to 
perform well. Overall sales increased 
by 15% to £1.5 million (2013: £1.3 
million) at reported currency and 
constant currency. 
The regulatory approval process for 
LiquiBand® in China is progressing, 
however, owing to changes in the 
regulatory pathway, we now expect 
approval later in 2015. 
Hernia Mesh Fixation Device – 
LiquiBand® Fix8™
We received approval to market this 
product in Europe on 29 May 2014 
and it has now been launched in the 
U.K. and Germany with our own sales 
teams as well as through some 
European distributors who are able 
to support the product. The initial 
response has been very positive, 
with a number of surgeons keen to 
endorse the product. We are also 
receiving valuable feedback about 
other possible applications suitable 
for this type of device which we are 
currently working on.
We do not anticipate significant sales 
in the first half of the year as 
surgeons are individually trained on 
how to use the device and we wait 
to see the outcome of their surgery. 
Following positive feedback, we 
are confident that the product will 
contribute to growth in the second 
half of 2015 and thereafter.
RESORBA®
Sales of RESORBA® products to all 
export markets other than Russia grew 
by 6% at reported currency to £2.9 
million (2013: £2.8 million) and by 10% 
at constant currency. Growth was seen 
across several territories, with our 
French, Italian and Chinese distributors 
performing strongly. Sales in Russia 
increased by 4% at constant currency 
but decreased 18% to £1.3 million 
(2013: £1.6 million) at reported 
currency, reflecting the weakening 
rouble. The Russian market is unlikely 
to grow in the forseeable future. 
Work continues to gain approval 
to supply RESORBA® sutures and 
haemostats into the U.S. We have 
received our first approval for the 
sale of one type of suture for the U.S. 
market and are still on target for the 
remainder of the suture range to be 
approved in the first half of 2015, 
with the expectation that we can 
launch the products in the second 
half of 2015.
In R&D our focus is on continuing to 
improve the formulations of the base 
monomers that are used in our 
adhesives as well as extending the 
applications of tissue adhesives for 
internal use.
OEM
The OEM Business Unit reports the 
sales of products that are sold under 
third parties’ brands.
OEM revenue increased by 7% at 
reported currency to £25.3 million 
(2013: £23.6 million) and by 9% at 
constant currency. 
Our silver alginate range of dressings 
continued to perform well, with sales 
increasing by 8% at reported 
currency and by 10% at constant 
currency to £13.1 million (2013: £12.1 
million). Our partners continue to 
do well with the range of silver fibre 
dressings we provide gaining market 
share as well as accessing new 
geographical markets. We continue 
to support them with regulatory 
approvals and marketing data.
Sales of our foam-based dressings 
were flat at £1.8 million. This was due 
to one of our partners launching a 
new product range last year with 
sales following the typical second 
year post launch sales pattern 
reduction. Adjusting for this, sales 
elsewhere were encouraging and up 
20% on a proforma basis. Our other 
woundcare and skin protectant 
products delivered good growth 
growing by 9% to £9.7 million (2013: 
£8.9 million), while the collagen OEM 
business acquired with RESORBA® 
was flat year-on-year at £0.8 million, 
with little change expected in 2015.
In R&D the focus is on further 
developing our foam range to 
include both an antimicrobial and 
an atraumatic foam. These products 
are well advanced and we expect 
approvals in the first half of 2015, 
with a launch later this year. 
Bulk Materials
The Bulk Materials Business Unit 
reports sales of bulk materials to 
third party convertors.
Bulk Materials revenue decreased 
by 7% at reported currency to £3.9 
million (2013: £4.2 million) and by 4% 
at constant currency.
Chief Executive’s Statement continued Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Company Overview
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014

Rollstock foam contributed around 
85% of Bulk Materials revenue and 
good growth was seen by one 
significant customer that had 
destocked in 2013. However, sales by 
some newer and smaller partners 
were disappointing. Until sufficient 
scale of revenue is achieved with the 
customer base, the Bulk Materials 
Unit will remain vulnerable to the 
ordering patterns of its partners 
and customers.
In R&D the focus is on developing 
new foam formulations with 
antimicrobials, working in 
conjunction with the OEM Business 
Unit. These products are expected 
to be launched in 2015.
Operations
Efficiency and Gross Margins
We continue to strive for operational 
improvements by reducing set-up 
times, eliminating non-value added 
activities and increasing outputs. 
These incremental efficiencies are 
helping to improve gross margins 
across the Group and have helped 
to generate an improvement of 
approximately 100 basis points in 
2014, offsetting some of the negative 
impact resulting from movements 
in currency. We have invested in 
improving our converting capability 
in Winsford. This equipment is still 
being commissioned. We expect to 
increase our operational flexibility 
and improve efficiency in 2015 as a 
result.
Capacity and Resource
We have also identified the need to 
increase the capacity of our collagen 
plant in Germany. We anticipate that 
£1.0 million of investment is required 
in the plant in the second half of 
2015. We continue to invest in 
improving our Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) management and 
reporting systems. Following the 
successful launch of our new ERP 
system at our Plymouth site, the 
system was launched in Winsford in 
February 2014 and in Etten Leur in 
the Netherlands in September 2014. 
We constantly monitor our systems 
across the Group and will invest in 
further improvements to systems 
in Germany. 
Regulatory and Quality Assurance
With the regulatory framework 
gaining in complexity, we have 
continued to invest in both 
regulatory and quality functions and 
systems to ensure that we are able to 
support our partners with winning 
approvals in new markets as well as 
obtaining approval for our own 
products. We anticipate that we  
will continue to invest in these areas 
in 2015. 
R&D
The Group continues to develop new 
products through its R&D teams. We 
are well advanced in the approval 
process for our antimicrobial and 
atraumatic foams and, whilst external 
regulatory pathways are out of our 
control resulting in unclear timings, 
we expect to obtain several product 
approvals in 2015, enabling these 
products to be launched thereafter. 
Summary and Outlook
We delivered revenue growth of 6% 
(at constant currency this would have 
been 9%) and significantly improved 
profitability and cash generation 
during the year. 
Our three largest Business Units all 
delivered solid performance despite 
challenging currency conditions. We 
were particularly encouraged by 
strong growth in the U.S., where the 
competitive quality, range and 
pricing helped to drive gains in our 
market share. The successful launch 
of the LiquiBand® Fix8™ hernia mesh 
fixation device demonstrates our 
continued commitment to investing 
in innovation and during the year 
ahead we expect further product 
launches and advancements in our 
R&D activities. 
With continuing growth across our 
major Business Units, due to the 
strong performance of our products, 
new products progressing well and 
our anticipated broadening into new 
geographies, we are confident that 
the Group is well placed to drive 
growth as well as continued 
improvements in efficiencies and we 
remain excited by the prospects for 
our future.

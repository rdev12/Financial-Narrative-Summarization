I am pleased to report 
another year of record order 
intake, revenue and profit. 
Our strategy remains to grow 
both organically and through 
acquisitions and again this 
year we have extended our 
geographic reach.
Roger Lockwood
Chairman
chairman’s statement
The six acquisitions we completed in 2011 
were successfully integrated and have all 
made positive contributions during the year. 
Rotork Instruments, the division we created 
in 2011 to address the wider flow control 
market, performed well and will benefit from 
the addition of Soldo which we acquired in 
November 2012. Following the year end, in 
January 2013, we acquired the Schischek 
group of companies which will form part of 
the Controls division and provides us a 
presence in a new market, heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC).
Rotork has a reputation for innovation and 
during the year we maintained our focus on 
bringing new products to market which 
incorporate additional features and provide 
new benefits to our customers. 2012 saw the 
launch of IQ3, the latest generation of our 
flagship electric actuator range, as well as 
new products in each of the other divisions.
Financial Highlights
Revenue grew 14% to £512m despite a 3% 
currency headwind. The currency impact 
was more than offset by the benefit of a full 
year contribution from the six businesses 
acquired in 2011, meaning growth on an 
organic constant currency basis was 12%. 
Adjusted operating profit* increased by 
14% to £132m, resulting in a broadly similar 
operating margin of 25.8% compared with 
25.9% the prior year. The rapid growth of 
Fluid Systems had a dilutive effect on Group 
margins even though this division generated 
adjusted operating margins in excess of its 
15% target at 15.3% for the full year. 
Earnings per share increased 11% to 103.1 
pence, or based on adjusted profit*, 
14% to 109.3 pence. Net cash balances 
grew £11m in the year to end at £60m.
Board Composition
In May 2012 we welcomed Sally James as  
a non-executive director, broadening the 
range of skills and experience within the 
Board. Sally currently holds a number of 
other non-executive positions and 
previously held senior legal roles in 
investment banks in London and Chicago. 
Following Sally’s appointment the Company 
is now compliant with the Corporate 
Governance Code in that half the Board, 
excluding myself as Chairman, are 
independent non-executives. We have  
also met our stated aim that 25% of  
our independent non-executives will be 
women by the end of 2012.
Board Performance
Once again this year we used external 
consultants to conduct an independent 
appraisal of Board effectiveness. The results 
of the review were positive and Directors 
were unanimously of the view that the 
Board operates effectively as a unit. It is 
clear that the breadth of experience and 
skills represented on the Board is a key 
factor in this. During the review it was 
noted that a number of improvements had 
been made following last year’s review 
including the appointment of a new 
non-executive director and a strengthening 
of the approach to risk management and to 
acquisitions within the broader flow control 
strategy. The review recognised that many 
of the challenges facing the Board relate to 
managing the continued growth of the 
Group whilst preserving the strengths of   Rotork plc Annual Report 2012

the composition of the Board enables it to 
fulﬁl its expected role.
Corporate Governance
As a Board, we are responsible to the 
Company’s shareholders for increasing 
shareholder value over the long term 
through effective management and good 
governance. The Board considers all the 
aspects of the business necessary to provide 
good governance including strategy, 
acquisitions, current performance, risk 
management and the internal control 
framework. Discussions include the Rotork 
Management Board on occasions and at 
least once a year the Board meeting takes 
place at one of the subsidiary sites. I am 
pleased to be able to conﬁrm that Rotork 
now complies with all aspects of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Dividend
The Board recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 
26.6p per share which, taken together with 
the 2012 interim dividend, gives a payment 
of 43.0p per share (2011 core dividend: 
37.25p), representing a 15% increase in core 
dividends. This dividend will be payable on 
21 May 2013 to shareholders on the register 
on 12 April 2013.
Outlook
The strong results across the Group reﬂect 
the progress we have made in executing our 
strategy, with each division achieving record 
results in terms of order intake, revenue and 
proﬁt.
Our expanded product portfolio and 
extensive international reach position us for 
further growth. We will continue to invest in 
infrastructure, product development and 
sales channels both organically and by 
acquisition to strengthen our presence in 
the wider ﬂow control market.
The markets that we serve remain active 
and whilst we recognise that we are likely  
to see weakness within some regions due  
to economic conditions, the Board remains 
conﬁdent of achieving further progress in 
the coming year.

 Trading overview
The Group is positioned to benefit
from strong growth in the provision
of manufacturing services to
customers in the UK, Continental
Europe and the US from our facility
in Dongguan, People’s Republic 
of China.
We are able to offer a cost-effective,
yet low risk route towards Far East
sourcing, which is becoming an
increasingly essential focus for
established companies operating in
mature economies. Our capabilities
have been further enhanced by
continued investment in facilities
and people, enabling our customers
to source more complex products
and assemblies with higher added-
value content.
We have seen success from the
ongoing development of standard
and custom power solutions,
bringing together design and
technical resources from our UK
engineering team with our medium
and high volume production
capabilities at Hartlepool 
and Dongguan.
The local market in Asia for
relatively high volume, low
technology products such as
chargers and adaptors has become
very competitive. Most sourcing
decisions in this sector are driven
primarily by price and offer less
attractive returns to suppliers,
especially in view of substantial
increases in the cost of basic
commodities such as plastics and
copper. We have continued to resist
downward price pressure at the
expense of volume, focusing our
resources instead on business
offering greater added value.
STMC Limited, our subsidiary
created in 2003 to provide
manufacturing services to the
domestic sector in China, made a
contribution to turnover of £0.50m.
Whilst this is modest, the facility
offers an important strategic foothold
which will provide competitive
advantages as the future demands
of Chinese consumers and
manufacturers are expected to
become more sophisticated.
Reported results were again
affected by the weakness of the 
US dollar, with an adverse impact 
of some 11% (equivalent to sales 
of approximately £2m) compared
with 2003. Since acquisition of
Stadium Asia in March 2000, 
the US dollar has depreciated by
more than 30%; this provides the
backdrop against which reported
turnover from Stadium Asia,
expressed in Sterling, has doubled
from £8.10m in 2001 to £16.45m in
2004. Underlying growth in dollar
terms has shown compound growth
of over 35% from approximately
US$12m to approximately US$30m
over the same period.

Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Results and dividend
Turnover reduced by 3% to
£33.80m in 2004 from £34.88m 
last year. This was primarily as a
result of currency movements,
although sales from UK electronics
also reduced as expected from
£10.60m to £7.98m. The proportion
of sales from higher added-value
manufacturing services showed
further growth, bringing the Group
operating margin (before exceptional
items and goodwill amortisation) to
7.1% (2003: 5.6%).
Profit before tax was £2.01m,
compared with £1.86m for last 
year. Profit before tax, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items
increased by 24% to £2.34m 
from £1.88m.
Exceptional costs of £0.20m 
reflect the closure of our
manufacturing operation at Clacton
in Essex. The remaining business
from this site has been distributed
between Asia and Hartlepool. It is
anticipated that the sale of the
freehold property at Clacton will
mitigate the impact of these
exceptional costs in 2005.
Earnings per share increased by
21% to 6.3 pence compared with
5.2 pence last year. Earnings per
share before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items rose by 38%
to 7.3 pence from 5.3 pence.
The Board proposes a final dividend
of 2.25 pence, bringing the total for
the year to 3.25 pence per ordinary
share. This represents an increase
of 12% compared with 2003
(2.9 pence), and is covered by
earnings before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items 2.2 times.

Turnover sourced from Asia
operations grew by 14% to
£16.45m. This represents
underlying growth of 23% in 
local currency, diluted by an 
11% reduction in the average
value of the US dollar relative 
to sterling.
Turnover sourced from the UK
reduced by 25% from £10.60m 
to £7.98m. This was primarily
attributable to the winding down of
operations at Clacton, which closed
in December 2004. There was 
also a reduction in demand from
mature contracts at Hartlepool.
Notwithstanding this reduction, 
our UK manufacturing operations
remain an important element of our
comprehensive service offer to UK
customers, which still contribute
almost 60% of Electronics turnover
by destination. The increasing emphasis on higher
value contracts, and corresponding
reduction in commodity business,
again resulted in an improved
operating margin overall from 
6.1% to 8.0%. This also reflected
enhanced utilisation of capacity 
in our Asia facility, which is now
approximately 70%.
During the year, more than £0.60m
was invested in the Dongguan plant,
with the most significant benefit
being a doubling of capacity in the
automatic placement of surface
mounted components and associated
test facilities. The new equipment is
able to place a broader range of the
latest components, and supports 
the continued move towards more
technologically demanding contracts.
During the final quarter of the
year, Stadium Asia Limited
entered a product development
and manufacturing agreement
with Sealink Technology Limited, a
privately owned company registered
in Hong Kong. Sealink offers a range
of radio frequency (“RF”) products
for the marine and hobby markets
to a select group of original
equipment manufacturers and
distributors in Europe, Asia and the
USA. Under the agreement,
Stadium Asia will provide
manufacturing and customer
support services and Sealink will
retain responsibility for marketing,
product development and technical
support. Stadium Asia purchased
inventory and manufacturing
equipment from Sealink at net book
value of approximately £0.12m. This
arrangement offers opportunities 
to increase sales of products
previously offered by Sealink, which
amounted to approximately £0.70m
in 2004, and gives Stadium Asia
exposure to an important and
growing area of technical expertise.
On 1 January 2005, Daren Electronics
Limited changed its name to Stadium
Power Limited. This subsidiary,
based in Diss, Norfolk, offers a range
of standard power solutions and
provides design, engineering
and manufacturing services for 
more complex power management
applications. The name change
reflects the increasing integration
of the business into Stadium
Electronics, with projects engineered
at Diss being manufactured at
Hartlepool or Dongguan depending
upon volume and supply chain
considerations.

Branded plastics
Turnover in the second half of the
year was maintained at prior year
levels after experiencing a reduction
in the first half.
New product launches in both
babycare and building products
markets were well received, and
are meeting sales expectations.
Sourcing activities in the Far East 
are becoming well established, 
and offer further opportunities for
new product development in 
coming months. Balance sheet and cash flow
Cash flow from operations
amounted to £1.03m compared
with £2.38m last year. The major
reason for the reduction was the
payment of additional pension
contributions of £1.89m (2003:
£0.49m) including a non-recurring
contribution of £0.88m of deficit
funding in August 2004. The
additional pension contributions 
are reflected in SSAP 24 variation
costs, charged to operating profit, of
£0.35m, and an increase in 
SSAP 24 prepayments (included in
debtors) of £1.54m.
Deferred consideration of 
£0.99m was collected during the
year resulting from the sale of
businesses in 2002, and the final
instalments totaling £0.31m fall due
in the first half of 2005. Bank loans
payable by quarterly instalments
reduced by £1.15m during the year,
including gains on foreign exchange
amounting to £0.13m.
Net bank borrowings at the 
end of the year stood at £1.58m
(2003: £1.59m), giving gearing of
11.4% (2003: 12.0%).
Pension costs
There has been a significant
increase in the company’s funding
of its historic pension liabilities
during the year, and the
performance of the underlying
investment assets has continued to
show improvement. It should be
noted, however, that the actuarial
estimate of the present value of
future liabilities reflects increases
resulting from prevailing discount
rates and mortality assumptions. 
The results of the next triennial
review for accounting purposes are
expected in July 2005, when full
consideration will be given in the
light of UK and International
Accounting Standards.
Current trading and prospects
Customer orders, products in
development and new enquiries are
all at high levels, and current trading
is consistent with our expectations.
Our main growth activities – 
the provision of high value
manufacturing services from
Stadium Asia and the design and
build of custom power solutions –
have reached a turnover exceeding
£14m from a standing start in
March 2000. We are confident 
that our growing reputation and
expanding network of worldwide
sales contacts can deliver
opportunities to maintain 
this momentum.

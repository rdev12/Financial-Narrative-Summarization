Operational Highlights
• Exceptional performance on site  
and a strong, ongoing relationship 
with Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS 
Foundation Trust, has led to securing 
a third project for the hospital, 
confirming our credentials within 
Healthcare refurbishment.
• Led by the Gatehouse Energy team,  
our carbon abatement division, 
Styles&Wood have entered into a 
strategic partnering arrangement with 
Consensus Capital Private Equity. 
Together we are now bringing a fully

to the marketplace.

Barclays have commissioned 
Styles&Wood to provide our full suite  
of property services and solutions 
which now includes programme and 
projects delivery, design services and 
building intelligence support.
• Our professional team approach has 
resulted in repeat custom for high 
quality office refurbishment projects  
for two major clients in the financial 
services sector and circa £10m from 
similar projects has been carried 
forward into our 2013 order book.
• Corporate Responsibility remains at  
the very heart of operations here at 
Styles&Wood. CEO, Tony Lenehan, 
holds a seat on the Business in the 
Community’s National Marketplace

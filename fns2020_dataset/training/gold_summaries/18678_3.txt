directors’ report - annual review
chairman’s statement
Total property return increased by 31% to £35.9m (2012: 
£27.5m) and included growing net rents of £24.5m (up 7.0% 
from £22.9m in 2012) and development profits of £7.0m 
(2012: £0.7m). Diluted EPRA net asset value per share 
increased 5.6% to 264p (2012: 250p). Total Shareholder 
Return for the year to 31 March 2013 was 28.4%, compared 
to returns for the Listed Real Estate Sector of 21.8% and for 
the UK Equity Market as a whole of 16.8%. These results 
allow the Board to continue its progressive dividend policy 
and to recommend to shareholders a final dividend of 3.70p, 
taking the total for the year to 5.55p, an increase of 7.8%.
The year has seen many successes in the Company’s 
investment portfolio and development programme. Asset 
management initiatives have driven the net income of the 
Group forward and, at 31 March 2013, passing net rents were 
£28.7m (2012: £25.9m). Our share of the surplus on revaluation 
of investment properties, including those held in joint ventures, 
was £6.8m (2012: £4.2m) and the investment portfolio is now 
valued at £407.0m (2012: £394.1m). On the development 
side we have delivered against many of the milestones set 
at the beginning of the financial year, most notably at 200 
Aldersgate Street, London EC1, where we have as of today 
let 90% of the 348,000 sq ft refurbished office building (with 
a further 6% under offer), at our 1.5m sq ft development at 
Brickfields, White City where we have received planning 
consent and contracts have been exchanged for a sale of the 
site, and at our 450,000 sq ft redevelopment of Barts Square, 
London EC1, where we have received a resolution to grant 
planning consent. 
Despite frequent commentary that banks are not lending 
enough to the private sector, there is clearly an appetite 
amongst banks to lend to well managed, profitable and 
stable public companies in the real estate sector. We continue 
to enjoy excellent relationships with our banking partners 
with c. £290m of new or renewed facilities agreed since the 
beginning of 2012, extending our debt maturity to 3.3 years. 
With interest rates continuing at historic lows, we have 
been able to ensure that we are adequately protected against 
future interest rate rises, thereby securing growing income 
surpluses, strong cash flows and good interest cover. 
During the year we consulted with shareholders on  
a proposed new annual bonus scheme, designed to codify  
the existing discretionary scheme, rewarding participants 
based on the results of the business and seeking greater 
alignment of executive remuneration with shareholders’ 
interests. The resulting bonus scheme, incorporating the 
feedback received from shareholders holding more than 50% 
of our share register, was approved by over 95% of 
shareholders who voted at the 2012 AGM. I am delighted 
this year’s results have allowed participants in the scheme 
to receive bonuses in the form of cash payments and 
deferred shares. 
Consultation with shareholders was also undertaken with 
regard to changes to the Board during the year. Richard 
Gillingwater, Senior Independent Director, and Richard 
Grant, Audit Committee Chairman, joined as independent 
non-executive directors and I welcome both of them to the 
Board. I congratulate my former deputy, Tim Murphy, who 
replaced me as Finance Director when I became Chairman, 
having served as Finance Director for the last 25 years. Our 
former Chairman, Giles Weaver, served with distinction 
during his time on the Board and I would like to thank him 
as well as Antony Beevor and Wilf Weeks, who have also 
retired, for their invaluable contributions to the Board and 
its Committees.
After a challenging five years, I believe we are on the cusp  
of returning to delivering outperformance. Looking forward, 
we will benefit from a rebalanced portfolio with a strong and 
growing income stream which we intend to increase 
significantly in the next year. In addition, our development 
portfolio is expected to deliver substantial profits and cash 
returns over the same period and in the following years.  
We look forward to these two elements of our business 
combining to generate strong returns and value on behalf  
of all our shareholders.

Your Company has had a very good year against  
a backdrop of challenging, albeit improving, 
economic conditions. The total unleveraged return 
of its property portfolio, as measured by IPD, was 
8.6%, the Company’s best return since 31 March 
2007, compared to the IPD Universe of March 
valued funds of 3.9%.

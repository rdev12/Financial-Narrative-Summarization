Chief Executive’s Review
Strategy update
Many companies in our field develop products 
which have great potential but few take these 
products onto the global market.

When we acquired Genesis Diagnostics and

products but that their commercial success  
was unfulfilled.

year which, for a mature product range in a mature market, represents 
a	 good	 result.	 A	 grow th	 rate	 of	 this	 level	 has	 not	 been	 seen	 at	 ODL	 for	
many years and is due to the increased sales resource being applied

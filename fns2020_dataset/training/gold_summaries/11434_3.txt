 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 2
We expected the office supplies market to show some improvement in 2013 as the UK
economy came out of recession and that this would benefit our Managed Procurement activity.
During the first half of 2013, however, it became clear that the market was not improving.
Customers’ buying habits have also changed over the last two years, with a focus on lower cost
products, buying little and often and other changes targeted at reducing their direct costs.
The Board expects this to be a permanent shift in buying behaviour.  This has increased our
cost to serve and impacted our net margins, though our Managed Procurement activity
continued to out-perform the market which declined by 9% year on year. It remains the larger
part of the Group, accounting for 63.5% of Group revenue and 52.8% of Group EBITA before
central costs. 
By contrast our Business Critical Services activities operate in growing segments of the
market.  Banner Managed Communication, the largest of these activities, saw a general
recovery in marketing budgets in its segment, with increased spend towards the end of 2013
on digital channels in particular.  Business Critical Services now represent some 36.5% of
Group revenue and 47.2% of Group EBITA before central costs.   
Our underlying profit before tax for 2013 was £4.2m. For reasons detailed in the Strategic
Report and Significant Accounting Policies, we are making prior year adjustments that restate
2012’s underlying profit before tax from £6.5m to £4.2m. This flattening of Group
performance over a two year period does no more than confirm the urgency of the need for the
recovery programme we started in the second half of 2013.  
We significantly reduced net debt in 2013 by £7.2m to £21.8m at 31 December 2013 (2012:
£29.0m), owing to an increase in operating cash flow to £13.0m (2012: £6.5m).
These results are reported in more detail in the Chief Executive’s Review and the Strategic
Report which follow.

Dividend
At the half year, we advised shareholders that we could not
recommend an interim dividend.  This was a particular
disappointment as we had shareholders who had been loyal to
us since we listed in 2004.   
The Board remains of the view that, in current circumstances,
investing free cash in our recovery programme and where
possible in strengthening our Business Critical Services, is in
the best long term interest of shareholders.  We, therefore, do
not recommend a final dividend for 2013 and do not expect
to re-instate the dividend during 2014.  
Chairman
As reported in November 2013, David Callear decided to
stand down as Chairman because of his wife’s terminal illness.
David has been with the business since before it listed, has
made a significant contribution to it, remains very committed
to it and is familiar with the industry so we are grateful that
he has felt able to continue as a non-executive Director. 
Outlook
Trading to date is satisfactory, it is in line with expectations
and our operating costs are reducing.  However, we are
concerned that the office supplies market as a whole will not
improve in 2014, so we remain of the view that underlying
profit in 2014 is likely to fall short of 2013.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM will be held at the Company’s head office, St
Crispins, Duke Street, Norwich on 29 May 2014 at 11.00 am.
Notice of the AGM will be circulated separately, together with
the proxy forms, for use at the AGM.

Strategy and change 
We believe our market strategy remains sound.   Business
Critical Services has performed satisfactorily since we
committed to diversification in 2008 and we are focused on
growing it organically to become the larger part of the Group.
Managed Procurement’s task is to retain its position in the
contract office supplies market, protecting margin as it does
so and, whenever possible, building further profitable market
share, which it has shown can still be done. We have a
satisfactory pipeline of sales opportunities across the Group.  
The changes we have to make, which we started in the second
half of 2013, re-model the way we support our markets and
we need to use our free cash flow to do this. Re-modelling will
also enable us to re-finance the Group in advance of our
current term loans, which currently stand at £12.5m,
maturing in June 2015.  We are working closely with our bank,
The Royal Bank of Scotland, in this regard.
Our programme to reduce overheads, both centrally and in our
operating activities, will run through much of 2014.  The next
step is to change the way we handle the logistics side of our
business to give us a platform that fits the changed office
supplies market and takes into consideration the fact that the
leases on our three main sites are due for renewal this year.
We shall shortly complete our review of the options for
implementation during the rest of 2014.  The recovery
programme should reach its full annualised rate of benefit
from early 2015.    
In short, our focus is on doing all we can to improve
performance and strengthen the business.

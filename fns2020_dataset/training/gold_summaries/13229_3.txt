 14 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Chairman’s statement
For the period, Group revenues grew 
23.3% to £1,533.5m (2012: £1,244.1m), 
while operating proﬁ ts were marginally 
ahead at £90.8m (2012: £90.2m), a 
strong result in light of the increased 
drag from the accelerated pace of new 
centre additions. 
We continue to position the business for 
the future, with over £300m invested in 
growing our high quality network. In total 
we increased our business centre network 
by 30% to 1,831 (2012: 1,411) and 
opened 76 third place locations. 
The performance of our Mature business 
continues to be a strength. On a like-
for-like basis, revenues in our Mature 
business improved by 3.7% to £1,226.3m 
(2012: £1,182.0m), while operating 
proﬁ t increased by 33% to £205.3m 
(2012: £154.6m) with the mature operating 
margin improving to 16.7% (2012: 13.1%). 
Our mature centres continue to be highly 
cash generative, with free cash ﬂ ow (after 
tax, ﬁ nance costs and maintenance capital 
expenditure) of £156.5m, representing a 
mature free cash ﬂ ow margin of 12.8% or 
16.6p per share.
Our New Centres business has also 
performed well, progressing in line with 
our expectations. Management remain 
focused on ensuring all new centres 
achieve the required ﬁ nancial returns. 
Strategy
Over the last 25 years Regus has evolved 
to meet the changing work needs of 
business, providing our customers with 
superior space and support regardless of 
when, where or how they work. We believe 
that now is the right time to expand and 
lay the foundations for a much larger and 
more proﬁ table business. 
Our growth strategy is based upon 
increasing the proﬁ t generation and cash 
ﬂ ows from our mature centres which 
enables us to invest in our network and 
thereby generate attractive returns and 
increased earnings per share over the 
long term. 
While pursuing our strategy, we also strive 
to be good corporate citizens. We are 
committed to sustainable business 
practices and dedicated to promoting and 
enabling the shift to ﬂ exible working in the 
economy. By doing so, we strengthen our 
business and help our customers improve 
their productivity while reducing both 
costs and carbon emissions through 
more effective use of space and reducing 
the need for travel. We are also committed 
to reducing our own impact on the 
environment, implementing systems and 
processes to ensure we use resources in 
a suitable and responsible way. We also 
actively back our team members’ initiatives 
to support the local communities in which 
we operate.
Board update 
During the year Florence Pierre joined 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director, 
complementing its existing skills and 
diversity. Following an external evaluation 
in 2012, an internal Board review was 
conducted in 2013. The results of this 
evaluation were used to improve the 
processes and effectiveness of the Board. 
No reportable matters were identiﬁ ed and 
we continue to have full conﬁ dence in the 
Board’s members and processes. 
Our people
Each of the Non-Executive Directors was 
able to attend a portion of the Group’s 
annual planning conference in November 
in which more than 150 senior managers 
from around the world actively participated. 
It was clear from observation of the 
participants’ plans that management’s 
focus on the people in these key roles 
is paying off in terms of our ability to 
innovate and deliver results as we execute 
our strategy.
I would like to thank each and every one 
of our team members for their unrelenting 
passion and commitment. Building Regus 
is a challenging and rewarding endeavour 
which is only achieved through their hard 
work and dedication.
Dividend
Given the continued strong performance of 
the business the Board is recommending 
a ﬁ nal dividend of 2.5p. Subject to the 
approval of shareholders at the 2013 
AGM this will be paid on 30 May 2014 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 2 May 2014. This represents 
an increase in the full year dividend of 13% 
to 3.6p (2012: 3.2p).

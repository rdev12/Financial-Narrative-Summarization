Improvement
Genus is a world-leading animal genetics

higher-quality animal protein more 
efficiently, in the form of meat and milk.
Genus is a market leader in porcine, dairy and beef genetics 
and is uniquely positioned as a global player, with a dedicated, 
multi-species research and development (‘R&D’) function and 
an international distribution network.
Genus at a Glance
What We Do
Genus applies DNA analysis to accelerate 
genetic improvement and deliver it to 
our customers, quickly and efficiently. 
We breed and distribute the genes of the 
world’s best pigs and bulls, scientifically 
selecting livestock whose offspring are 
designed to increase the profitability of our 
customers, who are some of the world’s 
leading farmers and food producers.
In the porcine market, we sell genetically superior 
boars and sows that produce offspring with 
desirable characteristics, such as feed-efficient 
growth or leaner meat.
In the dairy and beef markets, our primary 
product is bull semen, which is delivered 
through artificial insemination to improve our 
customers’ herds and their efficiency. We also 
offer genetically superior embryos, through our 
subsidiary IVB.
How We Operate
Genus sells under well-known trademarks: ‘PIC’ 
for pigs and ‘ABS’ for dairy and beef cattle. During 
the year, we served our customers through three 
business units:
Genus PIC, which serves porcine customers in North 
America, Latin America and Europe.
Genus ABS, which serves dairy and beef customers  
in North America, Latin America and Europe.
Genus Asia, which serves porcine, dairy and beef 
customers in fast-growing Asian markets.
Our Asia unit was established in 2012 to create a strong base 
in the region’s diverse and fast-changing markets. In FY17, 
we will integrate the Asia unit’s porcine and bovine operations 
into the global PIC and ABS units, respectively.

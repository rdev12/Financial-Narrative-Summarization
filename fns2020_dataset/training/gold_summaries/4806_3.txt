Chairman’s Statement
John Rennocks
Chairman
Delivering strong returns to shareholders
As previously announced, I will be stepping 
down from the Board immediately after 
the AGM on 21 January 2015. I joined the 
Board in 2002 and became Chairman in 
2004, following the retirement of the late 
Christopher Thomas who had previously 
been Chief Executive and then Chairman of 
the Company for over 30 years. His guiding 
objective for the Company was to focus on 
consistently strong cash flow which would 
fund the Group’s growth strategy and 
deliver healthy and growing dividends; this 
has remained a fundamental principle of 
the Board during my Chairmanship of the 
Company over the last ten years. 
The Group’s strong cash flow is generated 
from businesses which focus on essential 
products and services within specialised 
market segments and deliver sustainable 
and attractive margins, through the quality 
of customer service, depth of technical 
support and value adding activities. It is 
this business model that has provided the 
Group with the resources over ten years to 
invest ca.£160m of our internally generated 
cash in value enhancing acquisitions to 
support our growth strategy and deliver 
strong shareholder value. 
The success in pursuing this strategy 
can be measured against the Group’s two 
principal corporate objectives of growth 
in adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) 
and total shareholder return (“TSR”). The 
target for adjusted EPS is to deliver strong 
double-digit growth over the business 
cycle and since 2004 the Group’s adjusted 
EPS has grown at a compound rate of 
16% p.a. The objective for TSR growth is to 
deliver upper quartile performance relative 
to the FTSE mid-250 Index Group (“FTSE-
250”) and over the last ten years, Diploma’s 
TSR has grown at a compound rate of 
24% p.a. compared with median growth 
of 13% p.a. in the FTSE-250. 
I believe that this sustained performance 
demonstrates the Board’s commitment 
to a clearly defined and well executed 
strategy, robust business model and 
relentless focus on strong cash generation. 
This has helped Diploma develop into a 
successful and resilient business capable 
of delivering strong shareholder value on 
a consistent basis and I am confident that 
it will continue to do so for many years.
Results
Group revenues increased in 2014 by 7% 
to £305.8m (2013: £285.5m) despite the 
significant strengthening of UK sterling 
against most major currencies in which 
the Group operates. With ca.75% of the 
Group’s revenues generated outside the 
UK, the £17.7m reduction in revenues from 
currency translation more than offset the 
contribution to revenue of £15.4m from 
acquisitions completed during the year. 
On an underlying basis, which is after 
adjusting for acquisitions and for currency 
effects on translation, Group revenues 
increased by 8% with each of the Group’s 
business Sectors reporting strong 
underlying growth during the year.
Adjusted operating margins remained 
robust at 18.5% (2013: 19.0%) and adjusted 
Adjusted EPS growth
+20% p.a.
TSR growth
+36% p.a.
Dividend growth
+17% p.a.

operating profit increased by 4% to 
£56.7m (2013: £54.3m). Gross margins in 
the Canadian and Australian healthcare 
businesses were impacted by transactional 
currency effects, but these were partly 
mitigated by tight control of operating 
costs and the benefits arising from the 
Group’s recent Investment for Growth 
programme which is now substantially 
complete.
 
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 3% 
to £56.2m (2013: £54.3m) and adjusted 
earnings per share, helped by a lower 
effective tax rate, increased by 4% to 36.1p 
(2013: 34.8p).
The Group generated strong free cash flow 
of £37.8m (2013: £31.6m), despite a larger 
investment in working capital, reflecting 
both much lower capital expenditure of 
£2.2m (2013: £4.6m) and a smaller cash 
contribution of £1.8m (2013: £4.7m) to 
the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust. 
With the acquisition environment 
improving, the Group invested £16.5m 
(2013: £2.2m) in acquisitions during the 
financial year. Shortly after the year end, 
the Group acquired 80% of TPD, which 
extends the Healthcare business into 
Ireland and the UK; this acquisition has 
taken the acquisition spend to ca.£26m 
in the 2014 calendar year. 
At 30 September 2014 the Group’s net 
cash funds increased by £2.0m to £21.3m 
after distributing £18.2m (2013: £17.4m) 
to shareholders during the year. 
Dividends
The strong balance sheet and free cash 
flow, supported by a good set of results has 
led the Board to recommend an increase 
in the final dividend of 8% to 11.6p per 
share (2013: 10.7p). Subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM, this dividend will be 
paid on 28 January 2015 to shareholders 
on the register at 28 November 2014.
The total dividend per share for the 
year will be 17.0p (2013: 15.7p) which 
represents an 8% increase on 2013. The 
dividend is well covered by adjusted 
EPS at 2.1 times, in line with the Board’s 
objective of targeting towards a two times 
level of cover. Dividends have increased 
progressively in each of the last 15 years 
and represent a total of almost £100m 
of cash distributed to shareholders over 
ten years. 
Governance
The Board and its Committees have 
worked effectively throughout the year, 
benefiting from a stable year, following 
a number of years of changes as we 
developed and refreshed the Board.  
The work of these Committees and the  
key achievements this year are set out  
in the Corporate Governance section of 
the Annual Report & Accounts.
I should like to thank all my colleagues 
on the Board, past and present, who 
have always been both supportive and 
challenging, as needed. Their wise counsel 
and experience has made a substantial 
contribution to the success of the Group. 
Finally, I am delighted that in John 
Nicholas, the Company has a highly 
successful businessman with broad and 
relevant experience, who I am confident 
will chair the Group well on the next stage 
of its journey and to further success. 
Employees
I have very much appreciated the 
consistently high levels of service, 
performance and hard work that our 
employees deliver year after year. I believe 
that this is largely due to our decentralised 
organisational structure which allows 
our employees to understand their 
responsibilities and gives them space to 
operate efficiently and effectively. This 
provides enormous strength to the Diploma 
businesses and helps explain the Group’s 
sustained success. I wish to sincerely thank 
all our employees for their tremendous hard 
work and for all they have achieved during 
my period with the Company.
Outlook
The Group’s performance this year has 
benefited from greater confidence in its 
principal markets with strong underlying 
revenue growth in each of the Group’s 
Sectors. Given the strong comparatives and 
the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, 
the Board expects growth to trend this year 
towards our target “GDP plus” rates.
The Group has a strong and proven 
business model, together with a good 
geographic spread of activities, strong 
free cash flow and balance sheet. With 
an improving acquisition environment 
and a good pipeline of opportunities, 
prospects for acquisition activity in 2015 
are encouraging. This provides the Board 
with confidence that further progress will 
be made in the new financial year.

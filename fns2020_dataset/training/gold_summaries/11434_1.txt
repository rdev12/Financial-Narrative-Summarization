 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2013 4
Results: performance
Group revenue was some 2% up year on year at £231.9m
(2012: £227.0m).  Underlying profit before tax at £4.2m was
similar to 2012 (£4.2m restated), with underlying earnings
per share at 8.7p as against 2012’s 8.5p.
Results: cash/net debt
Group net debt at 31 December 2013 was £21.8m, a
reduction of £7.2m on 2012, reflecting a similar reduction in
the level of average daily net debt throughout the period.
These reductions reflect a number of measures: the lower
dividend payment of £1.3m (2012: £4.1m); lower exceptional
costs with the Group’s 2013 restructuring programme
starting in the second half; and operational improvements, in
particular a focus on overdue debtors and on stock, which was
significantly reduced over the year while maintaining product
availability. The focus on cash generation and reducing debt
remain key management imperatives.    
Managed Procurement
Our Managed Procurement activity encompasses both our
contract business, Banner Business Services, which services
large corporate and public sector customers, and Truline,
which services the independent dealer channel through our
contract with the Advantia group. In 2013 revenue was flat
year on year at £147.3m, representing 63.5% of Group
revenue (2012: £147.5m) and 52.8% of Group EBITA before
central costs (2012: 62.3%).
Banner Business Services (BBS)
BBS revenues increased slightly year on year, markedly
outperforming the overall office products market, which is
calculated to have declined by 9%.  This outperformance was
aided by the new contract with The Royal Bank of Scotland
(RBS) and the retention of existing business with the NHS,
although profitability was affected by the mix of business and
continuing pressure on gross margins.  We implemented the
RBS contract in February 2013 with no loss of service to the
customer.  The contract has traded in line with expectations
from the start and we have become one of RBS’s preferred
suppliers.
In the latter part of the year, we were formally notified of an
extension to our Government Office Supplies Contract
(GOSC) for a minimum of 6 months as well as an extension to
the wider public sector supply framework for 12 months.
Throughout the year we continued to secure new business,
using the BBS “Managed Procurement Model” as a core part
of our offering.  The model is an open-book approach, allowing
the customer visibility of the product net margin earned by
BBS, after taking into consideration all costs to service the
contract.  The customer can assess the cost to serve and can
change ordering patterns to manage his costs.  
Truline
Truline maintained a consistently high service level to the
Advantia dealer network; new dealers have since signed up
and the pipeline is looking strong for 2014.  In an industry
sector where service levels are often compromised, our last
mile delivery service is proving to be a significant competitive
advantage. 
T aken together, our Managed Procurement activity remains a
substantial business and a leader in the office products
market.  We have confidence that the changes to optimise our
operations as mentioned in the Chairman’s Statement will
underpin future profitability. 
Business Critical Services
Revenues in Business Critical Services grew 6% year on year,
as the full year impact of contract wins in 2012 came through
in 2013.  In 2013, revenue was £84.6m which represented
36.5% of the total Group revenue (2012: £79.5m and
35.0%) and 47.2% of Group EBITA before central costs
(2012: 37.7%).
Banner Managed Communication (BMC)
BMC is the largest business in the Business Critical activities
of the Group.  It has grown substantially over recent years,
has invested in infrastructure, and has market opportunities
Chief Executive’s Review

to grow further organically, while enhancing its profitability.
In 2013, with revenues of £79.2m (2012: £75.7m)  it
retained all its major contracts and won and launched
important new accounts which will benefit 2014 including
Care UK, Bourne Leisure and Harvey & Thompson Group.
The provision of marketing services continues to grow, with a
general recovery in budgets and an increased spend on digital
marketing channels in particular towards the end of 2013.
We are also seeing a continuing trend to outsource to
companies which are best placed to provide a professional
and targeted service.  In 2013, BMC was voted amongst the
top 100 outsourcing firms globally in an IAOP poll, reflecting
its success in executing multichannel marketing campaigns
for its clients.
BMC’s ability to measure accurately the return on client
marketing investment has helped its clients focus their spend
and, together with its increased sales in technical applications
to support their marketing communications, meant that some
15% of revenue in 2013 derived from services other than
traditional print management.  
BMC was also, for the first time, asked to act for an
established client in the USA, an exciting marketplace with
clear potential for further growth.  In 2014, we hope to
continue expansion outside the UK through opportunities
provided by existing clients. 
Banner Document Services (BDS)
BDS, our secure document destruction service operating
Closed Loop
TM
, the fully auditable recycling solution for
customers, delivered continued growth during the year, with
sales revenue increasing to over £5m (2012: £3.8m). Banner
Records Management which provides an on-site and off-site
digital solution for document storage and retrieval was
launched during the year and is expected to deliver growth in
2014 as we make customers aware of this additional,
complementary service offering.
Private / public sector mix
In 2013, private sector corporate customers provided 70%
of Group revenue compared to 66.8% in 2012.
Operating Costs
Logistics and distribution are significant costs for the Group,
but delivering excellent service remains an important
strategic differentiator. In 2013, despite the change in
customer buying habits to ‘little and often’ , as outlined in the
Chairman’s Statement, we were able to maintain our overall
service costs at the 10% targeted level. These efficiency
gains were delivered through greater productivity levels
across all logistics activities, most notably in warehouse line
picking and last mile distribution. Addressing and adapting to
these continuing changes remains a challenge today and is the
imperative driving our re-modelling programme. 
In the second half of 2013, we started a programme to reduce
our central support costs. This is continuing and will yield its
main benefit from the second half of 2014.
Chief Operating Officer
In March 2014, Steve McKeever resigned as Chief Operating
Officer to take up a leadership role in the IT industry. We thank
him for his considerable contribution to the Group and wish
him well in his new role.
Employees
The Group is essentially a people not an asset business.  Our
staff deliver outstanding service to our customers and it is
because of them that we are still outperforming our peers in
the office supplies industry. The Board recognises that 2014
will be a further challenging year and wants to thank them in
advance for their continuing commitment and diligence.

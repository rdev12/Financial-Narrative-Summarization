Overview
Accumuli at a glance
Accumuli is a UK-based independent specialist in IT security and risk 
management – our objective is to enable organisations to manage the ever 
increasing IT risk landscape and leverage their IT assets for business value. 
We provide industry leading solutions and services which are underpinned 
by rare skills and capabilities.
The customer problem
Assessing the risk and maximising the value from significant IT trends (such as cybercrime, consumerisation of IT, Big Data) or business 
objectives (such as saving money or doing more with less) is the perennial challenge for any IT department. The Accumuli approach is 
to assist our customers with key security and risk projects and be the chosen capability partner to ensure successful delivery and tangible 
results – we identify both the risk and potential of their IT infrastructure and address any gaps with our leading solutions and expert services.

Our solutions and services framework
Accumuli has three core pillars that make up our framework which means that we can either provide a niche solution or service for a specific 
need or offer a true end to end solution.
Corporate activity in the last twelve months 
Accumuli has a buy, build and partner strategy – we have now completed a total of seven acquisitions and one disposal. During the last twelve 
months we have successfully completed an early settlement of the EdgeSeven earn-out and acquired two further companies in Signify and Eqalis.

 The Group’s results for 2015 were ahead of
market expectations. Growth in our revenues
combined with an efficient operating model
have driven further increases in our
profitability, margins and returns on capital
employed (“ROCE”).

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
This strong performance was primarily
delivered from continued strong
revenue growth in the Middle East and
an improvement in margins from our
UK business.
The proposed dividend increase for the
year of 17% reflects these strong results
and the Board’s confidence in the Group’s
long term future.
During the year, we undertook a significant
fleet investment programme that provided
both additional capacity to grow our business
and also continued to refresh our rental fleet
to ensure that it remains highly competitive.
The investment programme included c.£20
million that was originally planned for 2016,
enabling the delivery of additional fleet in the
final months of 2015. The decision to bring
forward this investment was to ensure our
market positions in the UK, France and the
Middle East were improved and that we
are well positioned to capture growth
opportunities as we move into 2016.
The Board remains focused on improving
the performance of our German business,
and we strengthened its management team
during the year with appointments of new
Managing and Finance Directors. Following
an operational review of the business, its
organisational structure is being reshaped
to be more in line with our regionally based,
larger depot business model applied
successfully elsewhere in the Group.
We believe that these changes will be
operationally complete by the end of 2016,
moving the business closer to its

average cost of capital (“WACC”) and, once
achieved, maintain it above this benchmark
across the business cycle. This strategic
target was achieved in 2014 and further
improvements in ROCE have been delivered
in 2015. To recognise the development of
our capital structure over time and, in
particular, changes to the Group’s cost
of equity and debt, we reassessed the
Group’s WACC in the year and a WACC of
9.5% is now used when assessing our
ROCE performance. As we expand our
capital base in support of our growth plans,
we anticipate that the Group’s ROCE will
make more modest progress while the
returns from the additional capital
employed reach expected levels.
Financial results
The Group’s total revenues in 2015
increased by 1% to £248.6 million (2014:
£246.3 million), with rental revenues also
increasing by 1% to £233.5 million
(2014: £231.9 million).
Underlying operating profits increased by
10% to £43.1 million (2014: £39.3 million)
with margins improving to 17.3% (2014:
16.0%). The combination of a further
improvement in the Group’s trading
performance and a reduction in net interest
costs to £4.6 million (2014: £5.2 million)
enabled the Group’s underlying profit
before tax to increase by 13% to £38.5
million (2014: £34.1 million).
With the Group’s underlying effective tax
rate reducing to 21% (2014: 23%),
customers, streamlining accountability
and providing a firm base from which to
improve returns.
The continued improvement in the Group’s
performance in recent years reflects our
strategic focus of developing strong market
positions and a differentiated service
offering to drive revenues and improve
margins. The allocation of additional capital
during 2015 demonstrates the operational
flexibility provided by the strength of the
Group’s balance sheet, underpinning our
ability to support the delivery of our growth
plans with investment when required.
We are confident that the consistent
delivery of revenue growth, driven and
serviced from our efficient cost structure
with its inherent operating leverage, will
generate substantial shareholder value
in the medium term.
Dividend
Given the Group’s strong financial
performance in the year, the Board is
proposing a final dividend of 3.70 pence per
share, making a total dividend for the year
of 5.40 pence, an increase of 17% over the
previous year (2014: a total dividend of 4.60
pence). The final dividend, if approved, will
be paid on 21 April 2016 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business on
4 March 2016.
The proposed increase in the dividend
not only reflects the strong financial
performance in the year, and the strength
of our operating cash flows, but also the
Board’s confidence in the Group’s future
and the continued recognition that
dividends are an important means of
delivering shareholder value.
Dividend cover, based on the proposed
total dividend for 2015 and underlying
earnings per share, has reduced to 3.3 times
(2014: 3.4 times) in line with our stated
intention to maintain dividend distributions
within a range that is covered three to four
times by earnings. The actual dividend
cover in any one year will be balanced
against the Group’s investment needs and
funding requirements as we move through
the business cycle.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s ROCE for the year increased
to 12.3% (2014: 12.1%). The calculation of
ROCE is based on the Group’s operating
profit before exceptional items and the
average of the opening and closing capital
employed for the year of £336.6 million
(2014: £309.2 million). The ROCE of 12.3%
is stated on a like for like basis with the
prior year and therefore ignores the
favourable impact on the Group’s capital
employed arising from the impairment this
year of the carrying value of the remaining
goodwill in the German and Belgian
businesses. The impact of this impairment
reduces the Group’s capital employed and
so increases the reported ROCE for 2015
to 12.7% (2014: 12.1%).
The Group’s principal strategic target has
been to improve ROCE above our weighted

underlying profit after tax increased by 15%
to £30.4 million (2014: £26.4 million) and
underlying earnings per share increased by
15% to 17.95 pence per share (2014: 15.65
pence per share).
Amortisation* charges for the year reduced
to £1.7 million (2014: £2.0 million). An
exceptional item of £20.6 million was
incurred, relating to a non-cash impairment
charge on the carrying values of the
remaining goodwill associated with the
Group’s German and Belgian businesses.
After amortisation* charges and the
exceptional item, the Group’s operating
profits were £20.7 million (2014: £27.2
million), profit before tax was £16.2 million
(2014: £21.0 million) and profit after tax
was £8.3 million (2014: £13.9 million),
with earnings per share of 4.91 pence
(2014: 8.23 pence).
Using exchange rates consistent with 2014,
both total and rental revenues increased
by 2% to £252.2 million and £236.9 million
respectively, with underlying operating
profits increasing by 8% to £42.6 million
(2014: £39.3 million) and underlying profits
before tax increasing by 11% to £38.0
million (2014: £34.1 million). Underlying
profit after tax increased by 14% to
£30.1 million (2014: £26.4 million) with
earnings per share increasing by 13% to
17.76 pence (2014: 15.65 pence).
Cash flow
Underlying earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
increased by 8% to £85.9 million (2014:
£79.6 million) with margins improving to
34.5% (2014: 32.3%). After absorbing
movements in working capital and
payments of interest and tax, the Group
generated £68.8 million of operating cash
in the year (2014: £66.7 million). This
operating cash was used to largely fund
the Group’s increased purchase of rental
fleet assets in 2015, after which the net
cash used by operating activities was
£21.1 million (2014: net cash generated
from operating activities £13.6 million).
As we moved through 2015, the
management of our working capital in
the Middle East became more challenging
due to the well publicised liquidity issues
in the region. This is primarily an issue
within our Saudi Arabian business,
although its impact is mitigated by the
better working capital metrics seen in
our other markets in the region that are
driving our current revenue growth.
Whilst our Middle East business unit is
self-funding, its increased working
capital needs will moderate the rate
at which we allocate additional capital
into the region in the coming year.
This discipline is expected to increase
the level of “free cash” generated by
the region and will remain in place until
the liquidity pressures in the market
show signs of easing.
Investment
In 2015, the Group increased its level
of investment in its rental fleet and
operational infrastructure to £95.5 million
(£64.7 million) including c.£20 million
originally planned for 2016. As in previous
years, this was partly funded by the
disposal of surplus or retired assets which
generated £8.8 million (2014: £11.6 million)
in the year. After reflecting movements in
amounts owing to equipment suppliers at
the beginning and end of the year, our
investment programme resulted in a net
cash outflow for the year of £85.8 million
(2014: £45.6 million). This capital
expenditure was predominantly funded
by the Group’s strong operating cash
flows with the balance financed using the
Group’s debt facilities.
The investment was principally directed
towards the purchase of c. 3,100 rental
machines, which has provided additional
capacity to our operations and enabled a
further substantial refreshment of the
Group’s existing rental fleet to be
undertaken. Over the past four years,
around 40% of the Group’s rental fleet has
been refreshed, ensuring that it remains
well invested and highly competitive in
support of our strong market positions.
Net debt
The Group’s net debt before issue costs at
31 December 2015 was £119.9 million
(2014: £90.6 million). The increase in net
debt is principally the net effect of the

investment programme undertaken during
the year being partially offset by our strong
operating cash flows and a favourable
foreign exchange movement of £4.3 million
on our non-Sterling denominated debt.
After adjusting for the unamortised debt
issue costs relating to the Group’s US
Private Placements, the Group’s reported
net debt at 31 December 2015 was
£119.2 million (2014: £89.7 million).
The corresponding debt to equity ratio
was 53% (2014: 41%) and our net debt to
underlying EBITDA ratio was 1.39 times
(2014: 1.13 times). The Group continues to
operate comfortably within its preferred
leverage range of 1.00 – 1.75 times EBITDA.
Board changes
Given the development of the Group in
recent years and our desire as a Board to
demonstrate best practice, we are
separating the current role of Finance
Director and Company Secretary in 2016.
Alan Merrell will continue in his role as
Finance Director and we have appointed
a Company Secretary who is expected to
join the Group in April 2016.
Summary and outlook
The Group delivered a strong underlying
financial performance in 2015, ahead of
market expectations with revenues, profits,
margins and ROCE all delivering year on
year growth. The proposed increase in the
total dividend for the year of 17% reflects
these strong results and the Board’s
confidence in the Group’s long term future.
The key drivers of 2015’s performance
were further strong revenue growth in our
Middle East region and a notable margin
improvement in our UK business. We
recognise that the current financial
performance of our German business is
unsatisfactory and are taking further steps
to address this in 2016 so as to establish
a firm base from which the business can
return to growth on a sustainable basis
and deliver improved financial returns
for the Group.
Our fleet investment programme for 2015
was substantial and included additional
fleet added towards the end of the year to
ensure capacity is available to meet
anticipated growth in demand as we move
into 2016. Following this capacity increase,
our investment programme for 2016 is
primarily focused on the ongoing
refreshment and improvement in the
product mix of our fleet. As a consequence,
our fleet investment for 2016 will reduce to
c.£55 million, more in line with our trend
level of annual investment and one that is
largely self-funded from our operational
cash flows.
While our strong financial position provides
us with the flexibility to accelerate the
allocation of capital in response to
opportunities offering attractive financial
returns as they emerge, the disciplined
allocation of additional capital remains a
key focus of the Board. This will ensure we
maintain our ROCE above our weighted
average cost of capital across the business
cycle. In this regard, the recent increase
in working capital requirements of our
Middle East business will moderate the
rate at which we expand in this market
until such time as the liquidity issues ease
in the region.
Trading in the current financial year has
been in line with our expectations and,
whilst recognising the recent increased
uncertainty in the economic outlook, the
Board looks forward to delivering another
year of progress in 2016.

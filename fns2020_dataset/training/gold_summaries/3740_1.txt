I am pleased to report that Cohort’s trading this year 
has continued the successful trend of last year. The

with the acquisition of SEA in October 2007 and has 
witnessed continued strong growth from both MASS 
and SCS. All three companies have achieved record 
annual	revenue	and	profit.
In the year ended 30 April 2008, Cohort achieved 
Group revenue of £57.1m (2007: £34.4m) and an 
a d j u s t e d 	 o p e r a t i n g 	 p r o fi t 	 o f 	 £ 6 . 1 m 	 ( 2 0 0 7 : 	 £ 2 . 9 m ) ,	
representing a full year of trading for MASS and SCS 
and six months for SEA.
Group Overview
Cohort is an independent group whose constituent 
companies provide a wide range of technical advice, 
support and managed services and certain niche 
products, characterised by high tech design and low 
volume manufacture. It provides an environment in 
which companies can develop and continue to grow 
whilst retaining a high degree of autonomy but deriving 
b e n e fi t 	 f r o m 	 b e i n g 	 p a r t 	 o f 	 t h e 	 w i d e r 	 G r o u p . 	 T h i s 	 y e a r ’ s	
expansion of its existing companies and the acquisition 
of SEA is entirely in line with Cohort’s strategy 
of continuing organic growth and a steady rate of 
acquisition of successful, complementary companies. 
These may be large enough to operate as an additional 
member within the Group or smaller businesses that 
can be attached to existing members of the Group.

strengthened by Finance Director, Simon Walther 
and Business Manager, Emily Davies relinquishing 
their additional shadow roles in SCS with effect 
from 1 January 2008. Ian Dale‑Staples, CEO of SEA 
was appointed to the Cohort Board following the 
acquisition of SEA in October. Now that the earn‑out 
period for SEA has ended he will take an increasing 
role in the Group’s acquisition process.
Cohort’s well established businesses have successfully 
expanded from their roots in defence and now have a 
presence in the following market sectors: information 
systems, security, telecommunications, transport, 
space and off‑shore.

Cohort plc
Annual Report 
and Accounts 2008
Based in Henley‑on‑Thames, SCS was founded 
in 1992 and has consistently grown year on year. 
This year is no exception despite major management 
changes including my handover to Rick Bounsall 
as Managing Director on 1 May 2007. John Lyde 
(a founding Director) stepped down as Technical 
Director and I take this opportunity to thank him 
for his invaluable support over many years.
Revenue growth in 2008 at 18% was good, whilst 
not	as	strong	as	the	previous	year ,	and	profit	grew	
by just over 6% compared with 2007. The provision 
of specialist manpower support to the UK MOD 
demonstrated very good growth in revenue and 
profit,	partly	reflecting	the	high	level	of	operational	
stretch in the Armed Forces, whereas major equipment 
programmes experienced delay resulting in some 
under‑utilisation. Overheads were also higher, 
including costs relating to the needed introduction 
of new IT systems and additional support staff. 
These changes and the recent streamlining 
of management at SCS are aimed at improving 
the operating margin in the current year.
SCS Joint Ventures
In the course of the year SCS withdrew from 
participation in the Digital Millennium Map Limited 
Liability Partnership, membership of which pre‑dated 
the	2006	flotation	of	Cohort,	as	there	was	no	longer	
an adequate rational for the investment. We have 
continued to support Advanced Geospatial Solutions 
Limited (AGS), in which SCS holds a 50% stake, 
as it works to bring its ground‑breaking 3D terrain 
visualisation software to market. Progress was made 
with contracts being secured for both military/
security and commercial applications, the latter 
in relation to 3D display on mobile phones. 
We will continue to keep the investment 
in AGS under close review.
SEA
SEA (Group) Limited (SEA) is an independent systems 
engineering and software company operating in the 
defence, space, transport and off‑shore markets. 
It is based in Beckington near Frome, Somerset with 
f u r t h e r 	 o f fi c e s 	 c l o s e 	 t o 	 t h e 	 m a i n 	 U K 	 M O D 	 e s t a b l i s h m e n t	
at Bristol. The Company, which celebrates its 20th 
anniversary this year was acquired by Cohort in 
October 2007. Limited management structure changes 
have been made recently, namely the subdivision 
of the former Defence Division into four Divisions 
which, added to the existing Transport, Space and 
Off‑shore, make a total of seven. Paul Phillips, formerly 
heading Defence Division, has been appointed SEA 
Managing Director under Ian Dale‑Staples who remains 
SEA CEO and has a place on the Cohort Board.
Outlook
In 	 an 	 uncertain 	 financial 	 climate, 	 t h e 	 d i v e r s i t y 	 b o t h	
across the Group and within the individual companies, 
coupled with the ability to keep well abreast of and 
sometimes lead technology, provides the agility to 
enable us to respond quickly to market needs. I am 
therefore 	 confident 	 the 	 Group 	 is 	 well 	 placed 	 to 	
continue to grow both organically and by acquisition.

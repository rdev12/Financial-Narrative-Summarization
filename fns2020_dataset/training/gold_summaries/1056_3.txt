04 Antofagasta plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010
Chairman’s Statement
2010 was a landmark year for the Group, with the successful 
completion of the Esperanza mine. Commissioning of the plant 
commenced in November 2010, with the ﬁrst shipment of copper 
concentrate taking place in January 2011. As a result of Esperanza 
coming on-stream, along with the completion of the Los Pelambres 
plant expansion during the ﬁrst quarter of 2010, Group copper 
production is currently expected to increase to approximately  
715,000 tonnes in 2011, a 60% increase on the pre-expansion 
2009 levels.

Net earnings increased by 57 .5% to US$1,051.8 million compared with 
US$667 .7 million in 2009, reﬂecting improved commodity prices and 
increased production volumes. Cash ﬂows from operations were 
US$2,433.9 million, compared with US$1,167 .8 million in 2009, mainly 
reﬂecting the increase in proﬁts. At the end of 2010 the Group had a net 
cash position of US$1,345.1 million and total cash, cash equivalents and 
liquid investments of US$3,541.6 million.
Group copper production was 521,100 tonnes, compared with 442,500 tonnes 
in 2009. This 17 .8% increase was mainly due to increased production at 
Los Pelambres, reﬂecting higher throughput as a result of the plant expansion. 
Molybdenum production at Los Pelambres was 8,800 tonnes, a 12.8% increase 
on 2009, again due to the plant expansion. The transport and water divisions 
both achieved increased volumes.
Our careful ﬁnancial stewardship during the recent years of development will 
allow a substantial return of capital through the proposed special dividend, 
while the signiﬁcant increase in the ordinary dividend underlines our increased 
production base and conﬁdence in our future prospects. Our ﬁnancial position 
remains strong and we remain well placed to progress with our substantial 
growth opportunities which we have continued to enhance over the past year.
During 2010 the Chilean government enacted a number of changes to the 
Chilean tax system in order to contribute to the reconstruction costs following 
the severe earthquake which affected the country on 27 February 2010, 
including changes to both the corporate tax rates and the mining royalty. 
The Group’s four mining operations, Los Pelambres, Esperanza, El Tesoro and 
Michilla, which have invariability agreements in place with regard to the mining 
tax, have voluntarily elected to accept amendments enacted in respect of this 
tax. In exchange for waiving protection for a three-year period from 2010-2012, 
the companies will be granted an additional stability period of six years at the 
end of their existing agreements, during which any connected projects will also 
beneﬁt from tax invariability. Further details of the tax charge for the year and 
the tax structure applicable to the Group are set out in the Financial Review 
on page 63.
Strategy
The strategy for the Group’s mining business continues to be based on three 
key pillars. Firstly, securing and strengthening the core business of the Group – 
the Los Pelambres, Esperanza, El Tesoro and Michilla mines; secondly, 
continuing to grow this core business by further developing the areas around its 
existing asset base – the Sierra Gorda District around Esperanza and El Tesoro, 
the area around Los Pelambres, and areas close to Michilla, including the 
Antucoya deposit; and ﬁnally, continuing to develop and search for additional 
opportunities including early-stage growth in copper both in Chile and abroad. 
The successful execution of the Esperanza mine and the Los Pelambres plant 
expansion were major achievements in the Group’s growth plans. The Group has 
also made signiﬁcant progress with its longer-term growth prospects. In the 
Sierra Gorda District, mineral resource estimates were completed during 2010 
in respect of the Telégrafo and Caracoles deposits, totalling 3.9 billion tonnes 
with an average copper grade of 0.38% and containing additional gold and 
molybdenum credits. This gives a total of 6.1 billion tonnes with an average 
copper grade of 0.39% in the Sierra Gorda District. At Los Pelambres a scoping 
study is examining the key enablers which could allow the mine to utilise its 
signiﬁcant resource base in the longer term, which could potentially lead to a 
signiﬁcant increase in the scale of the operation later this decade. A feasibility 
study is in progress at the Antucoya deposit, evaluating the potential for a project 
producing approximately 80,000 tonnes of copper per year. At the Reko Diq 
joint venture, work on the feasibility study and the environmental and social 
impact assessment study are both complete and have been submitted to the 
Government of Balochistan. Further progress on this project will be dependent 
on the grant of the mining lease for which an application has been made, and 
successful conclusion of litigation which is currently in progress before the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan. In July 2010 the Group signed a deﬁnitive 
agreement with Duluth Metals Limited to acquire an initial 40% stake in the 
Nokomis copper-nickel-platinum group metal deposit, a potentially world-class 
base and precious metal deposit located in the highly prospective Duluth 
Complex in Minnesota, and work is progressing in respect of the feasibility study. 
The Group has also expanded its portfolio of early-stage international earn-in 
agreements. The Group is also continuing with its exploration and development 
activities relating to geothermal and coal energy prospects in Chile.

Sustainable development
Sustainable development forms an integral part of the Group’s decision-
making process and supports achievement of our business strategy. The Board 
continues to place key importance on a range of considerations including health 
and safety, management of human resources, environment and community 
relations. Effective management of social and environmental issues reduces 
costs and risks to our business, supports our reputation, underpins our 
relationships with key stakeholders including investors, regulators, 
employees and communities, and helps us to maintain our social licence 
to operate and grow. 
As a Group, we have been very proud to be able to play a part in the 
reconstruction efforts in Chile following the earthquake and resulting tsunami 
of February 2010 which had a devastating impact on the Maule and Bio-Bio 
Regions. Five days after the earthquake we had a team and equipment working 
in the severely affected town of Curepto in the Maule Region providing assistance 
and clearing debris. We also engaged with the authorities and established a 
US$10 million recovery fund, which has been mainly used for Antofagasta 
Minerals S.A.’s “Coastal Route” project to support the recovery of artisanal 
ﬁshing, which had been severely affected, as well as strengthening tourist and 
community infrastructure. In addition to this ﬁnancial contribution, Antofagasta 
Minerals is contributing management expertise used in large mining projects 
to help implement the project. Both for the Group as a whole as well as for 
the individuals directly involved, the project has been a very positive and 
rewarding experience.
Health and safety
The Board deeply regrets the death of two contractors at Los Pelambres during 
2010. The Board has a clear target of zero fatalities and considers any fatality 
to be unacceptable. Following these incidents, further safety training and 
awareness raising has been provided for workers. Los Pelambres has also 
introduced changes to increase the linkage between safety performance and 
remuneration, with 25% of bonuses now based on whether the site’s lost time 
injury frequency target has been met.
Dividends
In light of the successful completion of the key growth projects and the strong 
ﬁnancial position of the Group, the Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 
112 cents per share, comprising an ordinary dividend of 12 cents per share and 
a special dividend of 100 cents per share, which, if approved, will amount to a 
payment in June 2011 of US$1,104.2 million. Taking this payment into account, 
the Group’s ﬁnancial position remains strong and it remains well placed to take 
advantage of its considerable growth prospects as these continue to progress. 
This gives total dividends for the year of 116 cents, amounting to US$1,143.6 
million and representing a distribution of 109% of 2010 net earnings. 
The Board’s policy is to establish an ordinary dividend which can be maintained 
or progressively increased at conservative long-term copper prices and through 
the economic cycle. In addition, the Board recommends special dividends when 
it considers these appropriate after taking into account the level of proﬁts earned 
in the period under review, the existing cash position of the Group and signiﬁcant 
known or expected funding commitments. The Board’s overall policy remains 
unchanged and the level of distribution in future years, including any special or 
additional dividends, will depend on the factors set out above.

Board composition
I am very pleased to be able to welcome two new Non-Executive Directors to 
the Antofagasta plc Board, who both bring great experience of the international 
mining industry. Hugo Dryland is Global Head of Rothschild’s investment banking 
activities in the mining and metals sector, and has 25 years of investment 
banking experience in natural resources. Tim Baker was latterly Executive 
Vice-President and Chief Operating Ofﬁcer at Kinross Gold Corporation, and 
previously Executive General Manager of Placer Dome Chile. He has previously 
managed mining operations in Chile, the United States, Tanzania and Venezuela 
and held geological and production roles in Kenya and Liberia. Daniel Yarur 
retired from the Board on 1 March 2011. Daniel had been a Non-Executive 
Director of Antofagasta plc since 2004, and we are very grateful for his 
signiﬁcant contribution to the Group over this period and would like to wish 
him every success for the future.
Outlook
Market fundamentals remain positive and, while the high level of volatility that 
has characterised commodity prices in recent years is expected to continue, 
consensus estimates are for copper prices to remain favourable in 2011. 
Supply constraints and underlying demand could keep the copper market 
in deﬁcit for a number of years.
As previously announced, the initial forecast for 2011 Group copper production 
is for approximately 715,000 tonnes, a 37% increase on 2010 levels, mainly 
due to the production from Esperanza, although this will depend on a number 
of factors including the precise timing of the completion of the ramp-up of 
that operation. Molybdenum production at Los Pelambres is expected to be 
approximately 9,300 tonnes compared with 8,800 tonnes in 2010, due to the 
full-year impact of increased plant throughput as a result of the plant expansion 
completed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2010. The payable gold content in copper 
concentrate is expected to be approximately 324,000 ounces compared with 
35,100 ounces in 2010, also as a result of Esperanza, although again this will 
depend on the precise timing of the completion of the ramp-up of that operation.
The Group’s very sizeable resource base within Chile provides excellent 
opportunities for longer-term organic expansion, and its expanding portfolio 
of exploration and development agreements provides further potential for 
international growth. The Group’s continued strong ﬁnancial position means 
it is well placed to progress with all of these opportunities.
J-P Luksic

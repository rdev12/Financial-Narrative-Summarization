Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The principal financial risks and 
uncertainties the Group faces are 
described in note 19 to the annual  
report and accounts. 
The Group faces operational risks and 
uncertainties which the Directors take all 
reasonable steps possible to mitigate. 
However, the Directors recognise that 
they can never be eliminated completely. 
The principal operational risks and 
uncertainties the Group faces include 
those in relation to the recruitment of 
additional staff to meet the Group’s 
ambitious growth plans, the entry of a 
significant competitor to threaten the 
Group’s leading position in its domestic 
Escrow market, the occurrence of 
unforeseen difficulties in the integration  
of future acquisitions the Group may 
enter into and the dependence on  
key Executives and senior managers. 
There are no persons with whom the 
Company has contractual or other 
arrangements that are deemed to be 
essential to the Group.
Risk and uncertainties outside the  
Group’s control include those relating 
to the implementation of changes in 
government policy for the procurement 
of IT Services and alterations to the 
legislative and taxation framework in  
which the Group operates.
Disclosure of Information  
to Auditors
The Directors who held office at the 
date of approval of this Directors’ 
report confirm that so far as they are 
each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware. Each Director  
has taken all the steps that they ought 
to have taken as a Director to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of  
that information.
Auditors
KPMG Audit Plc has expressed 
its willingness to continue in office. 
Therefore, in accordance with Section 
489 of the Companies Act 2006, a 
resolution to reappoint KPMG Audit Plc 
as the Group’s auditor and authorising 
the Directors to fix the remuneration of 
the auditor will be put to the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The notice of the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting to be held at the 
Manchester Technology Centre is sent 
to shareholders with this annual report 
along with details of the business to be 
proposed and explanatory notes.

DIRECTORS’
REPORT
The Directors present their annual report 
and financial statements for the year 
ended 31 May 2009.
Principal Activity and Review of  
the Business
The principal activity of the Group is the 
independent provision of IT assurance 
through Escrow and Assurance Testing 
to both the public and private sectors 
worldwide. The performance in the year 
and the year end financial position were 
satisfactory and the Directors expect 
the Group to continue its growth for the 
foreseeable future. 
The Chairman’s report on pages 11 to 14 
as well as the Chief Executive’s review 
on pages 15 to 20 report on the Group’s 
development during the year to 31 May 
2009, its position at that date and the 
Group’s likely future development. 
Any forward looking statements made in 
this document represent management’s 
best judgment as to what may occur in 
the future. However, the Group’s actual 
results for the current and future fiscal 
periods and corporate developments 
will depend on a number of economic, 
competitive and other factors, some of 
which will be outside the control of the 
Group. Such factors could cause the 
Group’s actual results for future periods 
to differ materially from those expressed 
in any forward looking statements made 
in this document.
The financial results of the Group are 
shown in the income statement on  
page 52.
Dividends
The Directors propose a final dividend 
of 6.25p per ordinary share which, 
together with the interim dividend of 3.0p 
per ordinary share paid on 27 February 
2009, makes a total dividend of 9.25p 
for the year. The final dividend has not 
been accrued for in these financial 
statements. The final dividend will, if 
approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM), be paid on 25 
September 2009 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 28 
August 2009. The ex-dividend date will 
be 26 August 2009.
The Company received dividends of 
£2.0m (2008: £4.0m) from subsidiary 
undertakings during the financial year.

authorised and called up share capital  
of the Company are set out in note 21  
to the financial statements.

Corporate Social Responsibility
The corporate social responsibility 
section on pages 47 to 48 provides 
an update on the Group’s policies 
and activities in respect of its wider 
stakeholders - employees, clients,

The Non Executive Chairman, Paul Mitchell, is responsible for the running of the 
Board. Executive responsibility for the running of the Group’s business rests with the 
two Executive Directors, Rob Cotton and Paul Edwards, who are supported in this by 
the Operational Board of NCC Group.
 
The Board normally meets on a monthly basis. During the year, the Board met on 12 
scheduled occasions. 
The Board conducted a self evaluation on its effectiveness in February 2009 and has 
concluded no significant amendments are required to its operating procedures of the 
Board as a result of the review. In addition a review of the Chairman’s performance 
was conducted in January 2009 by the other Non Executive Directors and no actions 
were felt necessary to improve the Chairman’s effectiveness. 
The attendance of individual Directors at the scheduled Board meetings is shown in 
the table below:

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE
NCC Group is committed and is accountable to shareholders for high standards of 
corporate governance. In respect of the year ended 31 May 2009, NCC Group has been in 
full compliance with the provisions of section 1 of the June 2008 (revised) Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance.
This statement describes how principles of corporate governance are applied to the Group.
The Board
The Board comprises two Executive and four Non Executive Directors whose Board and 
Committee responsibilities are set out in the table below:

Governance  35_NCC Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 NCC Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009_36 
After careful review, the Board has 
again concluded that James Wallace, 
Eurfyl ap Gwilym and Debbie Hewitt 
were independent. In coming to this 
assessment the Board considered the 
character of the individuals concerned 
and the fact that none of them:
• 	 	 has	ever	been	an	employee	of	 
the Group;
• 	 	 has	ever	had	a	material	business	
relationship with the Group;
• 	 	 receives	any	remuneration	other	than	
their fees;
• 	 	 has	close	family	ties	with	advisors,	
other Directors or senior management 
of the Group that could reasonably be 
expected to cause a conflict;
• 	 	 has	significant	links	with	other	
Directors through involvement with 
other companies;
• 	 	 represents	a	significant	 
shareholder; or
• 	 	 has	served	on	the	NCC	Group	Board	
for more than nine years.
The Board is responsible to 
shareholders for the proper management 
of the Group and for its system of 
corporate governance. It receives 
information on (at least) a monthly 
basis to enable it to review trading 
performance, forecasts and strategy  
and it has a schedule of matters 
specifically reserved for its decision.  
The most significant of these are:
• 	 	 changes	to	the	structure,	size	and	
composition of the Board;
• 	 	 consideration	of	the	independence	of	
Non Executive Directors;
• 	 	 review	of	management	structure	and	
senior management responsibilities;
• 	 	 with	the	assistance	of	the	
Remuneration Committee,  
approval of remuneration policies 
across the Group;
• 	 	 approval	of	strategic	plans,	profit	
plans and budgets and any material 
changes to them;
• 	 	 oversight	of	the	Group’ s	operations	
ensuring competent and prudent 
management, sound planning,  
an adequate system of internal  
control and adequate accounting  
and other records;
• 	 	 final	approval	of	annual	accounts	and	
accounting policies;
• 	 	 approval	of	the	dividend	policy;
• 	 	 approval	of	the	acquisition	or	disposal	
of subsidiaries and major investments 
and capital projects;
• 	 	 delegation	of	the	Board’ s	powers	
and authorities, including the division 
of responsibilities between the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive and 
other Executive Directors; and
• 	 	 receiving	reports	on	the	views	of	the	
Company’s shareholders.
Operational management of the Group  
is delegated to the operating Board of 
NCC Group.
Procedures exist to allow the Directors 
to seek independent legal and 
professional advice in respect of their 
duties at the Company’s expense where 
the circumstances are appropriate. 
During the year a training course was 
run to remind the Directors of their 
responsibilities as well as to inform them 
of the changes made by the Companies 
Act 2006. In addition, all of the Directors 
have access to the Company Secretary 
for advice.
All Directors are required to submit 
themselves for re-election at regular 
intervals and at least every three years.
The following formally constituted 
committees deal with specific aspects  
of the Group’s affairs in accordance  
with their written terms of reference, 
which are reviewed regularly.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, which is  
chaired by James Wallace, who is  
a member and former Chairman of  
other PLC Audit Committees, comprises 
three independent Non Executive 
Directors and meets at least three  
times a year. The Chairman, Chief 
Executive, Finance Director and  
external auditors attend these meetings 
as required by the Committee.
The purpose of the Committee is to 
assist the Board in the discharge of its 
responsibilities for financial reporting  
and corporate control and to provide 
a forum for reporting by the external 
auditors. The responsibilities of the 
Committee include:
• 	 	 to	consider	liquidity	risk	and	the	going	
concern of the Group;
• 	 	 to	monitor	the	integrity	of	the	financial	
statements and review significant 
financial reporting judgements 
contained in them;
• 	 	 to	review	the	Company’ s	internal	
financial control system and risk 
management systems;
• 	 	 to	make	recommendations	to	the	
Board in relation to the appointment of 
the external auditors and to approve 
the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditors;
• 	 	 to	review	and	monitor	the	external	
auditors’ independence, objectivity 
and effectiveness;
• 	 	 to	develop	and	implement	policy	
on the engagement of the external 
auditors to supply non-audit services;
• 	 	 to	monitor	the	Company’ s	 
whistle-blowing procedures; and
• 	 	 to	review	regularly	the	need	for	an	
internal audit function.
The attendance of individual Committee 
members at Audit Committee meetings 
is shown in the table below:
During the year, the Audit Committee 
considered the following issues:
• 	 	 the	appropriate	valuation	techniques	
to be utilised in valuing share options 
under IFRS;
• 	 	 the	areas	of	judgement	in	the	 
financial statements including the 
valuation of intangible assets and 
goodwill impairment;
• 	 	 the	requirement	for	a	formal	internal	
audit function;
• 	 	 the	independence	of	Rickitt	Mitchell	
as corporate finance advisors;
• 	 	 the	level	of	fees	payable	to	KPMG	
Audit plc in respect of non-audit work;
• 	 	 the	separation	of	the	audit,	non	audit	
and tax work and appointment of the 
appropriate advisors;
• 	 	 various	tax	issues	within	the	 
Group; and
• 	 corporate	governance	issues.

NCC Group does not have a dedicated 
internal audit function, although regular 
internal audits are conducted under the 
Group’s ISO 9001 accredited quality 
assurance process and at the request 
of the Audit Committee. The Board 
has considered the need for an internal 
audit function and believes that current 
arrangements are adequate given the 
structure of the Group’s accounting 
function and the size of the Group.
Auditor Independence
The Company operates a rigorous policy 
designed to ensure that the auditors’ 
independence is not compromised by 
their undertaking inappropriate non-
audit work. Every five years, the audit is 
put out to formal tender to ensure that 
independence is maintained, the last 
time this took place was 2006. The next 
formal date for tender will be in 2011. 
All significant pieces of non audit work 
are put to informal tender to suitable 
parties. Upon review as to suitability  
and price, the work will then be placed  
to the provider recommended after 
approval by the Audit Committee. The 
Audit Committee has delegated the 
placing of financial non audit work 
under £25,000 to the discretion of the 
Executive Directors. 
The Audit Committee has undertaken its 
annual review of the nature and amount 
of non-audit work undertaken by the 
external auditors to satisfy itself that there 
is no effect on their independence.
Going Concern
The Directors are satisfied that the  
Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future, a period of not less 
than 12 months from the date of this 
report. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.  
See page 59 for the note on the Basis 
of Preparation.
Communication with Shareholders
The Company values the views of 
shareholders and recognises their 
interests in the Group’s strategy and 
performance. It holds briefings with 
institutional fund managers, analysts 
and other investors, including staff 
shareholders, primarily following the 
announcement of interim and preliminary 
results, as well as at other times during 
the year as may be appropriate. 
The Company’s programme of  
investor relations activities is designed 
to ensure that the investing community 
receives a balanced and consistent  
view of the Group’s performance. All 
shareholders are welcomed to the  
Annual General Meeting, at which the 
Board of Directors are available to  
answer questions from shareholders. 
Communication is also provided  
through the Annual Report, the Interim 
Report and the investor relations  
area on the Company’s web site,  
www.nccgroup.com on which financial 
and other information is available and 
regularly updated.
The Board receives reports from  
the Group’s brokers twice a year  
that communicate feedback from 
institutional shareholders. 
It reviews analyst coverage of the Group 
every month and receives reports twice a  
year from its financial public relations 
advisors regarding the views of analysts. 
There were no meetings between the 
investors and Non Executive Directors,  
as none were requested or required.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee,  
which is chaired by Eurfyl ap Gwilym  
and comprises the Non Executive 
Directors, meets at least three times a 
year and additionally as required. It is 
responsible for reviewing remuneration 
arrangements for members of the  
Board and other senior employees of 
the Group and for providing general 
guidance on aspects of remuneration 
policy throughout the Group.
The attendance of individual Committee 
members at Remuneration Committee 
meetings is shown in the table below:
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is 
set out on pages 39 to 45.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired 
by Paul Mitchell and comprises the 
Chief Executive and the Non Executive 
Directors. The Committee is responsible 
for proposing candidates to the Board, 
having regard to the balance and 
structure of the Board. The Committee 
met three times in the year, in particular 
to discuss and plan succession for all key 
senior Executives in the business.
Internal  Control
The Board is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining the Group’s system of 
internal control. Internal control systems 
are designed to meet the particular 
needs of the Group and the risks to 
which it is exposed. By their nature 
however, internal control systems 
are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material mis-statement or loss.

of staff;

key performance indicators, 
including non-financial 
measures;

for the coming years and  
rolling three-year strategic 
plans, which are approved  
by the Board;
•  procedures for the approval 
of capital expenditure and 
investments and acquisitions;
•  monthly monitoring and 
re-forecasting of results 
against budget, with major 
variances followed up and 
management action taken 
where appropriate;
•  regular internal audits 
of key processes and  
procedures under the  
Group’s ISO 9001  
accredited quality  
assurance process;
•  ongoing procedures to 
identify, evaluate and  
manage significant risks  
faced by the business in 
accordance with the  
guidance of the Turnbull 
Committee on Internal  
Controls and procedures  
to monitor the control  
systems in place to reduce 
these risks to an acceptable 
level; and
•  formal consideration of 
progress made against 
significant business risks  
at monthly operational  
board meetings.

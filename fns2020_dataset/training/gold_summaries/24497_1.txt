 Chief Executive’s Review
H&T Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 12
H&T’s clear growth strategy has delivered another strong
financial and operational performance, with record profits
and a record number of new stores. This growth was
achieved despite the negative economic climate impacting
the UK and world economy.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Pawn Service Charge 
H&T has been the largest pawnbroker in the UK
based on the size of the pledge book for many
years with a current pledge book of £32.0 million
(2007: £27.8 million). This increase in the pledge
book translated to a 15.2 per cent. increase in
Pawn Service Charge. The pledge book generated
£19.7 million of net revenues directly through the
Pawn Service Charge and £11.9 million indirectly
through the disposition process. Pawnbroking is 
and will remain the core of H&T’s business. To date
there has been no tangible evidence to prove that
an economic recession would be beneficial to
pawnbroking. We believe that the increase in 
new customers arise from:
• The increased number of outlets; 
• The high street location and modern lay out 
of our stores;
• The simplicity of the product in terms of pricing
and security; 
• The quality of our customer service which 
leads to high levels of customer retention and
repeat business.
Disposition
The sale of forfeited items to the general public
(“Retail”) is the most important element of
Disposition, generating higher margins when
compared with scrap or auction. 2008 proved 
a difficult year for the high-street retail environment
with many retailers, including jewellers, reporting
negative like-for-like results for the year, further
highlighted by trading deterioration during the 
last quarter of 2008. Despite this challenging
environment, I am delighted to report that we
achieved retail turnover growth of 32.5 per cent.
(10.7 per cent turnover growth on a like-for-like
basis) and maintained our retail gross margin at 
49 per cent.
Once again we have achieved double digit growth
in gross profit in our major business segments.
Pawnbroking activities, comprising Pawn Service
Charge and Disposition, represented 89 per cent.
(2007: 87 per cent.) of total 2008 gross profits 
and grew 32 per cent. year-on-year. The demand
for all these products was strong and the business
benefited from the price of gold. At the same time
financial services activities, comprising Cheque
Cashing and Other Financial Services, grew 12 
per cent. year-on-year and represented 11 per cent.
(2007: 13 per cent.) of total 2008 gross profits. 
The performance of the financial services products
was mixed with the overall gross profit growth
primarily delivered by the Pay Day Advance
product .
H&T remains the UK’s leading pawnbroker by size
of pledge book and at 31 December 2008 had
105 outlets across the UK. The estate increased by
16 store openings (2007: 12) during 2008. Of
those, 12 (2007: 5) were greenfield stores and 4
(2007: 7) were acquired branches. Further progress
was made on the new greenfield store layout which
has contributed to EBITDA profitability on average
now being achieved in the first year of a greenfield
site trading. The Group has opened or acquired 46
stores (44 per cent. of the total estate) over the last
four years.
The continuing growth we derive from our
established and greenfield stores has led to record
profits. Operating profit before exceptional items
reached £14.1 million (2007: £10.0 million), a 
41 per cent. increase on 2007 and 76 per cent.

Pawn Service Charge
Pawn Service Charge (PSC) represents all income earned 
up to the completion of a pledge. The main items are interest
and net profit from auctions after returning any surplus to the
customer.
In 2008 PSC represented 55% of total net revenues (2007:
62%) and 62% of total pawnbroking income (2007: 71%).
The reduction of PSC as a percentage of the total group net
revenues is due to the strong increase in disposition
turnover and margin.
The average loan in 2008 was £125 (2007: £111) and
the yield on the pledgebook was 65% (2007:66%). The
increase in the average loan is partly driven by the increase
in the gold price and the full effect of purchasing where
loans with lower values used to be pawned.
Disposition
Disposition refers to the entire process to dispose of
forfeited pledges. The key routes are retail through the
stores and scrap. Given the higher margin our preferred
route is via retail.
Retail
The Company’s retail proposition is primarily gold and
jewellery and the large majority (90.4%) of retail sales are
items sourced from pawnbroking or purchasing operations.
We complement our retail offering with a small amount of 
new jewellery. The turnover of new jewellery increased
sharply in 2008 with the introduction of some new ranges
which have been attracting new retail customers. 
We have incorporated the retail offering into all but one H&T
branded outlet and all new H&T Pawnbrokers now have a
dedicated retail window, most including an internal display
with a separate retail counter.
Profitability in this area is driven by sound valuation at the
point of purchase or lending and also by the management 
of appropriate stock. Our preference is to retail the stock that
is produced from forfeited loans to maximise our returns.
The advantage of H&T over other retailers is that the cost of
our supply is relatively low and we can scrap surplus items
and still make a profit. This offsets the fact that we have little
choice over our supply and therefore must retail what we have
available to sell.
As almost all items retailed come from pawnbroking or
purchasing operations we are able to offer an excellent value
proposition that is extremely hard to beat on the high street.
Scrap
Items that are damaged beyond repair, slow moving or surplus
to retail requirement, may be smelted and sold at the current
gold spot price less a small commission. The point of sale
system reduces the amount lent or paid on items identified as
scrap or low quality so we are still able to make a reasonable
margin on scrap sales.

Chief Executive’s Review (continued)
This strong performance in retail is a result of
different factors:
• Continued investment in staff training;
• Investment in new retail displays and windows;
and
• Introduction of some new jewellery ranges
supplementing the existing second hand product
range.
Scrap represents an increasingly important element
of disposition. Scrap profit in 2008 reached £4.8
million (2007: £1.5 million). This £3.3 million
increase can be analysed into two parts:
• The increase in the price of gold contributing
£1.8 million. The gold price in Sterling terms
continued to rise throughout 2008 mostly as 
a result of the strengthening of the US Dollar
currency; and
• The higher scrap volume contributing £1.5
million driven mostly by the success of gold 
and jewellery purchasing.
The Board announced in the 2008 interim report 
its intention to hedge some of its exposure to gold
price movement in order to protect its current scrap
margin. With the continued rise in the gold price,
the Board has decided to put its hedging strategy
on hold.
Total disposition gross profit increased to £12.0
million (2007: £6.9 million).
OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES 
Cheque Cashing (comprising Third Party Cheque
Cashing and Pay Day Advance)
During 2008, Third Party Cheque Cashing turnover
declined by 1.1 per cent. due to deteriorating
market conditions and increasing competition. We
expect this downwards trend to continue during
2009 and it may worsen in line with the general
economy.
Pay Day Advance continues to provide excellent
growth. Due to the expanding loan book and the
current economic climate, we experienced a small
increase in the percentage of bad debt. The Group
has in place a number of controls and indicators to
monitor the bad debt for these products and the
collection of arrears to mitigate this risk. H&T also
caps the weekly amount of new Pay Day Advance
business written in order to manage the profile of
the Pay Day Advance product growth. During
2009, H&T will continue to invest in new systems 
to enhance product underwriting and collection of
arrears. 
The revenues net of bad debt and provisions from
Third Party Cheque Cashing and Pay Day Advance
increased to £3.8 million (2007: £3.4 million).
KwikLoan
In view of the worsening economic and credit
climate, the Group decided, at the beginning of
2008, to adopt a cautious approach as regards to
signing up new KwikLoan customers. As a result the
KwikLoan loan book decreased from £0.5 million 
to £0.4 million during the year while KwikLoan
gross profit was flat year-on-year. 
Point of sale development
We look to invest in new technology in order to
improve operational efficiency, enhance
management information and risk management
systems, and simplify store operations to enable us
to achieve the full potential of the existing product
range and implement new products more easily.
In 2006 we commenced the development of our
new point of sale system and expected to implement
the solution in the summer of 2007. Due to the
delays and inability by the third party software
developers to complete the application, the contract
was terminated in December 2008. The intangible
asset was written off resulting in a £0.8 million
exceptional loss. 
In view of the repeated delays in the overall project,
the Board determined in early 2008 that a
contingency plan was required in the event that 
the project failed. This has proved to be the right
decision since the development work on this
alternative has been progressing rapidly and will 
be undergoing user acceptance testing in the first
half of 2009 with a planned deployment shortly
thereafter. This software is considered to carry 
lower risks than the initial point of sale development
project as it is built on current proven systems which

Third Party Cheque Cashing
Third Party Cheque Cashing is the provision of cash in
exchange for a cheque payable to our customer for a
commission fee based on the face value of the cheque. The
average cheque value in 2008 was £332 (2007: £355),
with the average fee being £21 (6.4%) (2007: £23 (6.4%)).
The cheques are normally in respect of wages and the
service is used as a quick and convenient alternative to a
bank overdraft. The product simply serves a short term need
for cash.
In order to manage the risk associated with cashing third party
cheques we have access to a variety of information, from credit
reference agencies to internet directories, as well as our own
point of sale system and database of customer activity. 
Pay Day Advance
Pay Day Advance is a simple form of credit, where the
advance is repaid by cheques presented by the customer at
the point of the loan. The contract allows for 30 days credit
and the average advance in 2008 was £458 (2007: £452),
with a typical charge of 13% (2007: 13%) per 30 days.
The customer will agree a date for the cheque to be banked,
then either:
• Pay additional fees for another 30 days (Extend); or
• Pay the face value of the cheque in cash (Settle); or
• Allow the cheque to be deposited into our account.
KwikLoan
H&T identified the need for an unsecured loan product that
had a longer duration than a Pay Day Advance. The
principle is that some customers are unable to repay the lump
sum of a Pay Day Advance after 30 days and prefer a
smaller regular repayment. The underwriting criteria are
essentially the same as for a Pay Day Advance although we
do more verification to ensure that the customer is likely to be
a reasonable risk for the duration of the loan.
KwikLoan is currently offered over a 12 month period for
loan values up to £750, although the average is closer to
£600. We earn approximately £300 gross interest on a
£500 KwikLoan over a 12 month period.
Prepaid Debit Card
H&T offer a prepaid debit card on behalf of Advanced
Payment Solutions (APS) under the CashPlus brand. The card
is an instant issue Cirrus card (which allows ATM access
immediately), with a personalised MasterCard issued to the
customer in the post within 10 days. For further product
information refer to www.apsgroup.com.
H&T were the first national chain to provide the CashPlus
card in the UK and we remain one of the largest customers of
APS.
The card is the ideal vehicle to provide funds to our
customers in a more convenient form than cash. The card is
the natural extension to each of our cash based products,
with the store staff cross selling the benefit as part of our
pawnbroking and cheque cashing transactions. We expect
the card to enhance our relationship with customers,
increasing retention and loyalty as they will use our outlets to
load additional funds on to the card.
The customers value the status of having a MasterCard and
the ability to use the card online, with over half the
transactions on the card being for internet purchases.

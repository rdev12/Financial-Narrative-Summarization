1. Market leader
Our market-leading businesses will enable 
us to benefit from the expected growth 
in demand in the UK and our regional 
markets within the US.
 • 40 % of UK market share based 
on volume of bricks sold in 2014 
(excluding imports).
2. Scale
We have 28 clay and 15 concrete plants 
throughout the UK and US manufacturing 
over 500 varieties of bricks coupled 
with ownership of valuable long-term 
clay reserves.
 • 43 m anufacturing sites; 33 UK sites and 
10 US sites.
 • Over 150 million tonnes of clay reserves.
 • Realisable production capacity of 
1.2 billion bricks per annum.
3. Long-standing customer 
relationships
Many of our long-standing customer 
relationships have lasted over 40 years.  
Our customer focus is based on quality, 
service and consistency and our service-
led ethos is one of the key drivers in the 
growth in our market share in bricks over 
the past 10 years.
4. Growing capacity
In the UK, demand for building products is 
anticipated to increase due to Government 
support for new house-building, increasing 
household formations and population 
growth. We are investing in the latest 
technology to increase capacity and to 
meet the growing market demands.

built in 2013 to consolidate production 
from two previous sites and increased 
site capacity by approximately 67% 
per annum.

commissioned in the second half of 
2017, is expected to add capacity of 
100 million bricks per annum.

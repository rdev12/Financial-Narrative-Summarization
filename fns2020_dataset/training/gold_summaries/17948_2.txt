‘‘
 We believe the market research industry will change more in the next 10 years than it has in the  
last 100 and BrainJuicer is extremely well positioned to benefit from a major system change. The growth of 
our core quantitative products gives us cause for continued optimism in the underlying momentum in the  
business and its long term upside potential.

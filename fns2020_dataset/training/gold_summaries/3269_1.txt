 Chief Executive’s Review
....we continue to
invest in process
improvement, to
increase productivity
and energy
efficiency....
”
At this time last year I commented
that the focus for the year ahead
was to improve our margins. It is
pleasing now to report that some
progress was made in the year with
the return on sales improving from
4.9% to 5.8% on turnover broadly
in line with the previous year. The
scope of the improvement was held
back for two reasons. Firstly the
large rise in energy costs where we
were particularly affected by
increases in gas and electricity
prices. Increased costs always have
a time lag before recovery, and
affect margins accordingly. The
second element was that we saw a
reduction in demand during the
winter months. This has now
largely recovered, and we will be
seeking to make further progress
with margins in the year ahead.
To achieve this we continue to
invest in process improvement, to
increase productivity and energy
efficiency, and in new product
development and environmental
improvement. In the year just
ended capital expenditure was
£1.44m. Our success in improving
our efficiencies can be seen below,
where the increase in sales per head
has improved by some 45% in a 
10 year period.
Foundries
Bloxwich Foundry ceased
production at the end of January,
and the sale of the site was
completed in March. From 1 April
2006, the Light Castings Division is
now based in Walsall trading as
Chamberlin & Hill Castings Limited,
the business and assets having
been hived down from Chamberlin
& Hill plc on 31 March 2006. The
transfer of the grey iron parts from
Bloxwich to Walsall was achieved
speedily and efficiently as was the
commissioning of the 2013
Disamatic moulding machine. For
the Light Division in the year
turnover fell by 9% while the
return on sales improved by 1.5%
despite the inevitable disruption
involved in the transfer of plant 
and equipment.
Following the rationalisation to one
site we look forward to further
improvement in net margins in the
year ahead. Current levels of
activity in the automotive sector
have recovered from the dip seen
earlier in the year. We continue to
see growth opportunities in our
market for turbocharger castings
for diesel engines, particularly for
those associated with improved

taken following the recent closure
of competitors have led to
increased output levels over recent
weeks. Given reasonable stability in
material and energy prices we
expect Walsall to continue to
perform well in the year ahead.
In preparation for consolidation of
the Heavy Castings Division onto
one site in Scunthorpe, Russell
Castings acquired the business and
assets of Ductile Castings and its
name was changed to Russell
Ductile Castings Limited from 
1 April 2006. Turnover in 2005/06
was broadly in line with the
previous year, while the return on
sales improved by 1.5%. The hand-
mould section was transferred from
Leicester to Scunthorpe at the year
end. Activity levels, which fell back
during the winter months, are
slowly improving as a major sales
campaign to raise turnover in the
division begins to bear fruit. As in
the Light Castings Division, the
volatility of raw materials and
energy costs remains the greatest
threat to performance.
During the year plans have been
developed and property acquired to
extend the Scunthorpe site in order
to complete the integration of the
business from Leicester in 2008.
Foundry investment will therefore
be largely concentrated at
Scunthorpe in the next two years.
In the year to 31 March 2007 
we will be investing in the 
site infrastructure and services, 
and the construction of a new 
melting facility.
Engineering
Production value fell slightly in our
engineering businesses to £7.8m
(2005: £8.0m) and the return on
sales fell back some 1.6%, the
reduction being consistent both in
our lighting business, PFP Electrical
Products, and at Fred Duncombe
(“FD”). Price competition and
lower gross margins at PFP and
higher fixed costs at FD were
responsible, the latter as a result of
increasing our sales personnel. In
both businesses we are developing
off-shore sourcing of both parts
and products in order to remain a
low cost supplier to our markets.
We are looking this year for
increased sales from new products
and improved margin. Our priority
is to ensure that we respond quickly
to changing customer needs to
maintain our market positions.
The Future
The past year has seen good
progress with our programme of
foundry rationalisation. Our aim
now is to develop our foundry in
Scunthorpe into a modern and
efficient facility that will meet the
market needs for heavy iron
castings for years to come. We also
look for the benefit of the work
already completed at Walsall to
show through.
In engineering we will seek to make
more rapid progress in the
reduction of our cost base and to
increase sales from our new
product ranges. 
As always, our people remain our
most important asset. We will
endeavour to continue developing
their skills, recruiting where
necessary to strengthen our
excellent team. In this regard I
welcome our new Chief Executive
Designate, Tim Hair, who will take
over from me following the Annual
General Meeting in July. I am quite
sure that Tim will take the
Company forward for all its
stakeholders.
After 41 years with the Company
and 12 years as Chief Executive, I
would like to record my sincere
thanks to my board colleagues and
all our employees, past and
present, who have given so much
support both to Chamberlin & Hill
and to me personally. I look
forward with pleasure to seeing
further progress in the years 
to come.

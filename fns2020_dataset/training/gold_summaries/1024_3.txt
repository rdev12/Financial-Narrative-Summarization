Clay Brendish
Chairman
Introduction
I am pleased to report a good set of results for the year. These were
achieved against the background of a global recession and the
changes we made to the business during 2008/2009. The sale of
our Public Sector Division in October 2008 was the latest, and most
signiﬁcant, step in our strategy of transforming the Company into
a more tightly-focused software business.
We now operate two divisions. Our Wireless business is a global
leader in both handset and air interface testing and is ﬁrmly
positioned at the heart of our Company. Our Travel business is
the market leader for travel technology solutions in the UK and
northern Europe. Both operations have a strong international
presence and the Company now derives 72% (2008: 67%) of
revenues from international markets (Wireless 95% (2008: 92%),
Travel 30% (2008: 19%)).
Further details of the Company’s performance are in the Chief
Executive’s review on page 6 and the ﬁnancial review on page 11.
Acquisitions and disposals
The sale of Public Sector for a gross consideration of £56.8m (net
proceeds £44.8m) resulted in a net proﬁt on the disposal of £27.6m.
Since 2004, the Company has raised £90.6m by disposing of
11businesses and has invested £65.4m in acquiring two businesses.
The disposal programme has enabled us to sharpen the focus of
the Company further, and to return value to shareholders, while
making selective acquisitions to strengthen our position in our
chosen markets.
Strategy
Our strategy is to position Anite as a global leader in wireless test
software. The disposal of Public Sector was a major step in our
strategy of transforming Anite into a more focused company and
of improving its long-term prospects for growth, higher margins
and greater international exposure. The Board believes that wireless
is a long-term growth market, which has high barriers to entry
and limited competition in those areas in which Anite operates.
This makes it possible to achieve good margins and to add value
by making selective acquisitions. In Travel, following the various
one-off customer changes over the past year and the strengthening
of the management team, the Board believes the best strategy
is to optimise the business’s long-term value by continuing to
strengthen and improve its market position.
In the Board’s view these factors together with operational success,
tempered by a reduction in the predictability and visibility of earnings,
should ultimately improve the rating of Anite’s shares.
Results
Adjusted revenue from continuing operations was £90.1m (2008:
£91.6m). Adjusted operating proﬁt was £20.0m (2008: £18.7m)
and the adjusted operating margin was 22.2% (2008: 20.4%).
The adjusted operating proﬁt is stated before disposed businesses,
share-based payments charge, amortisation of acquired intangible
assets, and restructuring costs.
Revenue and proﬁt beneﬁted from a £2.3m early settlement of part
of our contract with MyTravel. Proﬁtability was, however, affected
by a one-off £0.8m increase in legacy, non-operating property costs.
The effect of currency movements during the year was to improve
revenue by £7 .5m and operating proﬁt by £3.9m (based on this year’s
result at last year’s average exchange rates). Net amortisation of
research and development costs (R&D) in the year reduced proﬁts
by £1.0m (2008: £nil).
Adjusted proﬁt before tax from continuing operations was £18.1m
(2008: £16.7m) after net ﬁnance charges of £1.9m (2008: £2.0m),
giving basic earnings per share (after tax) of 4.4p (2008: 3.3p).
Proﬁt for the year, including proﬁt from discontinued operations of
£31.4m (2008: £6.5m), was £36.3m (2008: £13.2m).This gives basic
earnings per share of 11.3p(2008: 3.8p).
Dividend and share buyback
The Board has declared a ﬁnal dividend of 0.65p per share
(2008: 0.6p), making a total dividend for the year of 0.95p per share
(2008: 0.875p). This dividend will be payable on 20 October 2009
to shareholders on the register at 18September 2009.
Following the disposal of Public Sector, the Board returned £9.9m
in cash to shareholders in February 2009 by means of the payment
of a special dividend of 3.0p per ordinary share. This was combined
with an eight for nine share consolidation that reduced the number
of shares in issue to 298.6 million (2008: 338.0 million). The Board
has also committed to continuing a share buyback programme worth
up to £10.0m, subject to market conditions. l Wireless £11.7m l Travel £8.5m l Wireless £14.0m l Travel £9.5m

Section A
Overview
Balance sheet and cash
Anite has a strong balance sheet, ﬁnancial ﬂexibility and good
cash resources.
Net cash of £27.3m (2008: net debt £15 .4m) at the year end
included the net cash proceeds of £45.5m from the disposal of Anite
Public Sector, enabling us to reduce our term loan by £25.0m, the
£9.9m cost of the special dividend, and an £8.9m part settlement of
a currency swap.
Given the current macroeconomic conditions, the Board believes
it prudent to retain a strong cash balance. In addition, in order
to provide the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to enable us to consider
acquisitions, we retain total bank facilities of £45.0m, of which
£25.0m remains undrawn.
The Board, management and people
During the year, a number of Board and senior management changes
reﬂected the continuing development of the Company. Christopher
Humphrey, the Group’s Finance Director since 2003, was appointed
Chief Executive on 1January 2009. He replaced Steve Rowley, who
had been Chief Executive since 2003.
Steve led Anite’s transformation from a troubled and fragmented
IT services’ company to a focused international software company,
culminating in the sale of Public Sector and the return of signiﬁcant
shareholder value. We thank him for his major contribution to the
Company and wish him well in his new role at Torex.
The Board is making progress with the recruitment of a new Group
Finance Director and will announce an appointment as soon as
possible.
Nigel Clifford, Chief Executive at Symbian Limited (a subsidiary of
Nokia), was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1April 2009.
Nigel’s global experience and knowledge in the mobile handset and
wireless operator industries will be invaluable as we continue to
progress our wireless strategy. Peter Bertram, a Non-Executive
Director since 2004, has decided to step down from the Board during
the current year once a new Finance Director has been appointed.
He is Chairman or a Non-Executive Director of a number of listed
companies and has made a valuable contribution as Chairman of
the Audit Committee. The Board intends to appoint another
Non-Executive Director in the near future.
During the year we also made a number of important senior
management changes in our Wireless and Travel businesses to
strengthen the teams in place and to take Anite through the
next phases of its development.
On behalf of the Directors, I thank all our staff for their hard work
and support during such an important year.
Summary
We expect proﬁts for 2009/2010 as a whole to be lower than in
2008/2009. This will be more marked in the ﬁrst half as a result of
the re-basing of our Travel business and an increased customer-led
one-off investment in LTE (4G).
We now have the strategy and the team in place to take us into the
next phase of our transformation. We also have the ﬁnancial platform
and market positions from which to consolidate, invest and develop
our two strong businesses in these challenging economic times.

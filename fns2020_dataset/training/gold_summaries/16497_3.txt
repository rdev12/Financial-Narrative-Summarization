CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report 
that in the last 12 months 
we have seen continued 
progress across all areas 
of our business.

We raised £2.9 million before expenses  
at the start of January 2014.
I am pleased to report that in the last 12 months 
we have seen continued progress across all areas 
of our business. 
We started the year in good financial shape 
having raised, in aggregate, £2.9 million before 
expenses at the start of January 2014 by way  
of a combination of an equity placing and an 
equity swap Agreement; the latter was exercised 
in full before the year end. Additional equity 
finance (£1.6 million before expenses) was 
secured at the beginning of 2015.
A key priority for 2014 was to obtain the 
necessary formal regulatory permissions from  
the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory 
Agency (“MHRA”) and Ethics Committee to 
commence a Phase I/II, dose escalation study  
at University College London Hospital (“UCLH”),  
to assess the safety and tolerability of our lead 
drug VAL201 in patients with locally advanced  
or metastatic prostate cancer and other advanced 
solid tumours. These permissions were received 
in October at which point patient recruitment 
and testing began. We have since reported that 
VAL201 was safe and well tolerated at the doses 
tested in the first cohort and has now advanced 
to the next elevation of dose, where further  
safety and tolerability testing will be undertaken 
and early stage efficacy will be investigated  
as the trial progresses.
2014 also saw the establishment of a new 
subsidiary, ValiSeek Limited, a risk-sharing joint 
venture company with Tangent Reprofiling 
Limited. ValiSeek holds a worldwide exclusive 
licence from Tangent for the development and 
commercialisation of a novel cancer treatment, 
VAL401. In December we reported that in a 
GLP-regulatory toxicology study of VAL401 
no adverse effects were seen throughout the 
experiment even at a dosage 60 times greater 
than the envisaged dose for patients. This study 
has completed the toxicology package required 
to support ValiSeek’s approach to the regulatory 
authorities in 2015 with respect to advancing  
the drug towards pivotal clinical efficacy trials, 
initially in patients with lung cancer.
Another important accomplishment during  
the reporting period was the grant of new 
European and Japanese patents for our novel 
cancer screening test biomarker, NAV3, which 
is only one of five patent family assets within 
our Finland-based biomarker operation, ValiFinn 
Oy. Current diagnostic methods for cancer rely 
in the main on microscopic analysis of cells in 
biopsies. These work well in detecting established 
tumour cells. However at the early stage of 
cancer and before morphological changes have 
developed, such malignant cell detection is and 
remains difficult. The NAV3 gene biomarker is 
an important breakthrough as it enables the 
detection of cancer cells in tissue samples, 
whether they are primary tumours, metastases 
or pre-malignant cells, at a stage when tumour 
development is only about to start.

£210,802
in grants towards R&D (2013: £nil).
£87,558
Revenues for the year £87,558  
(2013: £124,868).
Lastly, in November we entered into a strategic 
alliance with one of the world’s leading 
biomedical research institutions, Deutsches 
Krebsforschungzentrum (the German Cancer 
Research Center) in Heidelberg, aimed at 
accelerating the translation of the preclinical 
evidence that we have amassed in support of 
our GeneICE technology’s potential to silence 
specific “rebellious genes” implicated in causing 
cancers, and take individualised cancer medicine 
from bench to bedside. As part of the Agreement, 
ValiRx will retain all rights to new GeneICE 
compounds deriving from the collaboration.
Our financial results show revenues for  
the year at £87,558 (2013: £124,868) with  
operating expenses rising 6% to £3,164,664  
(2013: £2,984,337) after receipts of £210,802  
of grants towards R&D (2013: £nil), as a result  
of increased R&D investment and overheads  
to drive VAL201 to Phase I/II clinical trials, 
and complete the VAL401 safety toxicology 
studies before year-end. The net loss for the 
year increased to £3,160,031 (2013: £2,702,258) 
resulting in a reduced loss per share (basic  
and diluted) of 0.08 pence (2013: 0.15 pence).  
As at 31 December 2014 the Company had  
cash and cash equivalents of £452,824  
(2013: £960,267); however, since the period end, 
our cash position has increased significantly 
following a further raising of equity finance,  
which we believe positions the Group well  
to reach its goals across all areas in 2015.
I should like to thank the Board and other 
colleagues at ValiRx, ValiFinn and ValiSeek for their 
contributions during another successful year and 
our shareholders for their continued support.

 I am delighted to report on another 
successful year for Arena Leisure Plc 
with strong performances from both our
racecourse division and our media rights
company , At The Races.

share of ATR’s post tax result, which was a loss
of £1.5m (2004: proﬁt £0.6m). Included within
the 2005 result is a tax credit for consortium
relief of £0.5m (2004: £4.9m) and £0.9m of
exceptional costs (2004: £0.9m) representing,
in 2005, legal costs incurred in connection with
two legal disputes. In the ﬁrst case against the
British Horseracing Board (‘BHB’), UK legal
history was made when the judge found in
favour of ATR, ruling that the BHB had abused 
its dominant position. The BHB has since
decided to appeal against this ruling, although
we remain conﬁdent. In the second case, in
which ATR is claiming around a net £30m in
outstanding rebates from the 30 racecourses
not currently afﬁliated to ATR following the
termination of media rights agreements in
2004, the court hearing is scheduled to begin
on 13 March 2006. ATR remains conﬁdent of 
a positive outcome.
Overall, proﬁt before tax was £4.5m 
(2004: £4.9m) and earnings per share from
continuing operations were 1.24 pence 
(2004: 1.41 pence). Adjusting for one-off

I am delighted to report on another successful
year for Arena Leisure Plc (‘Arena’), with 
strong performances from both our racecourse
division and our media rights company ,
At The Races (‘ATR’).We also acquired the
rights to redevelop and operate Doncaster
Racecourse, home of the world’s oldest 
classic race, the St Leger.
The results achieved in 2005 conﬁrm the
enormous operating improvements that have
been achieved. Turnover increased by 9.4% to
£40.7m (2004: £37.2m). Proﬁt from operations
on the new IFRS basis increased by 30.0% to
£6.7m (2004: 5.2m). Adjusting the 2005 result
for one-off gains and losses in order to give 
a more useful indication of underlying
performance (see Note 11 for details), the
adjusted proﬁt from operations was £6.3m,
a rise of 21.6%.
At The Races performed successfully in its 
ﬁrst full year of operation since its relaunch 
in June 2004. Arena’s share of ATR’s adjusted
operating loss (see Note 11 for details)
reduced dramatically by 73% to £1.0m 
(2004: £3.7m). Under the new IFRS accounts
presentation, Arena is required to disclose its Arena Leisure Plc Annual Report 2005 3
performance (see Note 11 for details),
adjusted earnings per share from continuing
operations increased in 2005 by 312% to 
1.32 pence (2004: 0.32 pence).
2005 was also a year of change for the
company , no more so than on the board.
On 1 October 2005, Mark Elliott replaced 
Ian Penrose as Chief Executive of Arena.
I would like to thank Ian for the enormous
energy and dedication that he brought 
to Arena during his time here as Finance
Director, Managing Director and Chief
Executive. Ian has left the company in 
a very strong position and he can be 
justiﬁably proud of his achievements here.
Mark Elliott is the former Chief Executive 
of Wembley Plc, having previously been its
Finance Director. During Mark’s seven year
tenure on the Board of Wembley , the company
operated ten greyhound tracks in the UK and
USA and one horseracing track in the US as
well as Wembley Stadium and Wembley Arena
and a variety of businesses providing services
to UK leisure venues. He therefore brings 
a wealth of experience relevant to Arena.
On 1 November 2005, Raymond Mould 
joined the board as non-executive deputy
Chairman. Raymond, a qualiﬁed solicitor,
has an outstanding track record in the UK
corporate world, particularly in the property
development industry . He also has a close
association with the horseracing industry ,
owning the 2002 Grand National winner,
Bindaree. He is currently Chairman of London
& Stamford Investments and was Executive
Chairman of Pillar Property Plc until May 2005
when it was acquired by British Land Plc for
£811m. At the same time, John Barnes retired
from the board and I would like to thank him for
all of his work at Arena. He had been a board
member since the company’s formation 
in 1997 and had made an extraordinary
contribution to Arena’s growth over that time.
Having been on the Arena board for ﬁve 
years and Chairman for over four years, I have
decided now is the right time for me to retire
from the board. I will therefore leave the board
at the annual general meeting (‘AGM’) on 8
May 2006, handing over the role of Chairman
to Raymond Mould. I am extremely privileged
to have been Chairman through a period of
such progress for Arena and to leave it facing 
a bright future.With Raymond and Mark at 
the helm, I am satisﬁed that Arena is in very
safe hands as it faces the opportunities and
challenges that lie ahead. I expect also to
announce the appointment of a new non-
executive director on or before the AGM.
I am extremely grateful to all of my fellow
directors and all of our employees for their
dedication and hard work over this eventful
year and, indeed, the support and loyalty they
have given me in my years as Chairman. Their
focus and determination to give every one of
our customers the best experience possible 
is fundamental to the success of the company
and I thank them all for their commitment.
As a result of the strong performance this 
year, an interim dividend of 0.25 pence per
share was paid in October and the Board 
has proposed a ﬁnal dividend for 2005 of 0.2
pence per share. This will give a total dividend
in relation to 2005 of 0.45 pence per share – an
increase of 50% over the 0.3 pence per share
declared in 2004. This dividend is proposed to
be paid on 12 May 2006 to shareholders on the
register on 31 March 2006.
2006 has started well, with our All Weather
racecourses performing well. During 2006,
it is expected that a number of new All
Weather surfaces will become operational 
at racecourses around the country . I see this 
as a tribute to the work that Arena has put in 
to raising the standards and proﬁle of All
Weather racing in this country since we 
ﬁrst introduced the Polytrack racing surface 
in 2001 at Lingﬁeld Park.We welcome
competition which, I have no doubt, will 
bring out the best in the Arena team as well 
as give us opportunities to extend the role 
of All Weather racing in the UK.
In December, Arena was delighted to
announce that agreement had been reached
for an Arena subsidiary to acquire the 
rights to redevelop and operate Doncaster
Racecourse – the home of the world’s oldest
classic race, the St Leger – on a 99-year lease,
commencing upon completion of the
redevelopment.Work on the exciting
redevelopment has now commenced.
The UK horseracing industry faces a number 
of challenges in the coming years, most
importantly the need to ﬁnd a commercial
replacement for the Levy before 2009 and also
an acceptable future home for the Tote.Within
the ever changing world of UK horseracing, I am
conﬁdent that Arena is well placed to capitalise
on the exciting value enhancing opportunities
in front of it, to help the industry as a whole
move forward and to continue to deliver a
growing proﬁt stream for its shareholders.
My thanks to you all for your continued support
of Arena Leisure.

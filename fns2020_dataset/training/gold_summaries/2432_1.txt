 BrainJuicer Group PLC  Annual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009
Introduction
In 2009 we have continued to 
grow our revenue and profits, 
and we have done so while 
investing more than ever before 
in our product development and 
operations, and in expanding our 
geographic footprint.
While the market has been 
difficult we have nevertheless 
made further steps along the 
path toward our ambitious long 
term goals: to alter and improve 
the way in which major consumer 
companies undertake market 
research and eventually to 
become one of the world’s  
leading research companies.
We recognise that we have a 
long way to go, but we remain 
confident in the building blocks 
we are putting in place and are 
encouraged by the progress we 
are making.  Perhaps the three 
most important data-points which 
under-pin our confidence: we 
are now working with 11 of the 
world’s 20 largest buyers of market 
research (up from nine in 2008), 
our revenue from these clients in 
2009 grew by over 70% year on 
year and since the year end we have 
secured an additional international 
research mandate as a preferred 
supplier from one of them.
If we can continue to attract and 
delight these highly demanding 
buyers of market research, we believe 
our innovative and radical client 
proposition is on the right track.
Priorities
Ultimately and simply, we are trying 
to help some of the world’s largest 
companies create better products, 
packaging and advertising.  We 
understand the challenges they 
face in their creative and innovation 
processes, and we believe that 
sensitive consumer engagement, 
undertaken in the right way, 
plays a key role in inspiring and 
enlightening those innovation 
processes.  Our priority is to 
develop and deliver large scale, 
robust quantitative market research 
which provides that inspiration, and 
not just the validation for which 
such research is traditionally known.
Our focus is often on the difficult 
early stage of the innovation 
process, where creativity and 
consumer insight is most needed, 
and which we believe is the 
segment least well served by our 
competitors.  We also believe that it 
is this early stage which is the most 
critical in the innovation process.
We have two categories of 
product: “Juicy” and “Twist”.  Juicy 
products are entirely different 
from those available elsewhere 
and challenge traditional 
approaches.  Twist products utilise 
industry standard quantitative 
research methods but add our 
unique qualitative diagnostics

 and FaceTrace

.  
Juicy products offer higher 
value to our clients, and are 
strategically more important 
to the Company.  Because they 
are so different from established 
methods, they take longer to gain 
client acceptance but due to their 
differentiation and defensibility, 
it is these products which will 
fuel our growth.  The success 
of these ‘Juicy’ products is the 
best indicator of our longer term 
positioning and success.  In 2009, 
our Juicy products grew by 66%, 
and represented 61% of our total 
revenue, up from 46% in 2008 
and 44% in 2007.
Our clients tend to be very large, 
and we are a small supplier to 
most of them.  We, therefore, 
have considerable potential from 
our existing client base, and our 
big challenge is to gain a more 
significant share of their market 
research spend.  To achieve this, 
we are looking to secure preferred 
supplier status.

Chief Executive’s Statement 15 BrainJuicer Group PLC  Annual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009
Whilst we believe we have the 
innovative products to succeed, 
we recognise we need to establish 
our credibility as an international 
partner to the world’s largest 
companies.  Market research 
tends to be a risk averse and 
conservative industry, and it 
can take a number of years of 
demonstrating value, proving 
validity, and building trusted 
relationships before clients will 
nominate a particular product 
and a particular supplier to such 
preferred status.  However, it is a 
prize worth winning.
To date the Group has one 
established preferred supplier 
relationship, and the revenue from 
that client was around £1 million 
in 2009.  We are beginning to 
be invited to tender more often 
for these positions, alongside 
the largest market research 
companies.  Since the year 
end we have secured a second 
international mandate with one of 
the world’s largest food companies 
and we are optimistic that in due 
course we will win more.
It is important for us to continue to 
expand our geographic coverage.  
Whilst our online platform enables 
us to undertake research wherever 
our clients need it, we also need 
offices in those countries in which 
our multinational clients have their 
main buying points.  We now have 
offices in the three largest market 
research markets: US, UK and 
Germany, and also in Switzerland 
where many multinational companies 
have located their European 
headquarters.  We are also 
represented in Australia through 
a licensing agreement, and in 
Canada where our former licence 
partner has become a wholly 
owned subsidiary since the year 
end.  The next priority countries 
for us are the high growth and 
strategically important markets for 
our clients; China and Brazil.
Profitability and growth
Our revenue growth at 27% 
was below our previous average 
annual growth rate of 37%, but 
nevertheless was very pleasing 
in a year when the economic 
backdrop was so difficult.  We 
have bold long term ambitions, so 
despite the challenging economic 
conditions, we continued to invest 
for the future whilst continuing to 
deliver short term profitability.  In 
2009, we maintained our margins, 
and operating profit therefore 
also grew by 27%.  The business 
remains strongly cash generative, 
and even after substantial 
investment for future growth 
our year end net cash balance 
increased significantly.
Prospects
In 2010 we intend to launch 
more innovation, open offices 
in Brazil and China and deliver 
further significant growth and 
strategic progress.  Our ambitious 
aim over the next decade is to 
become a top 10 global market 
research group.

Directorate Change 
 
Leonard Sim, who developed and prototyped our very first queuing solution in 1998 and who subsequently founded Lo-Q in the 
year 2000, has announced his retirement from the Group s board of directors with immediate effect.  Leonard has made an 
outstanding contribution to our business  not just over this year, but since the Group s very first days of operation.  He steps 
down from the Board today, but will remain with the Group as an employee as we move forward with our growth plans.  All of 
us at today s strong, successful and global accesso owe Leonard a significant debt of gratitude: not just for his original bright 
idea , but for the energy and passion with which he has pushed that idea forward. The board of directors has no immediate plans 
to recruit a replacement, but will keep the situation under review. 
 
Commenting on the results, Tom Burnet, Chief Executive of accesso, said:  
 
 2015 was another strong year for accesso, across every part of our business.  We have devoted considerable time, investment 
and technical attention to our product suite over the past twelve months.  The rewards of those efforts are now starting to show 
through financially, operationally and in the quality of conversation we are able to have with our customers. It gives me huge 
pleasure that those conversations have led to 92 new accounts comprising between them over 200 new venues being added to 
our customer base during the year.  
 
The clearest signal of our progress lies not in the numbers, and not even in the many achievements of the year in review.  Rather, 
I would urge people to look at the significant, long-term trust that both Merlin and Six Flags have placed in us over the last six 
months. To select a partner for one year, even two is a big step to take.  To select a partner for seven or even ten years, however, 
is quite a vote of confidence in our technology and our team  and it is this which underpins my confidence in 2016 and the years 
ahead of us.

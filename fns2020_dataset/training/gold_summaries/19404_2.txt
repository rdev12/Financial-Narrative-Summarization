Quintain at a Glance
We have an internal target 
of 10% total shareholder
return net of inflation, a target
that we have exceeded every
year since flotation in 1996.
We have also regularly
outperformed the UK
property market, as
measured by the Investment
Property Databank (IPD), 
the industry benchmark.
Over 10 years we are the
best performing UK property
fund monitored by IPD.
Quintain is a rapidly 
growing property company
specialising in areas of
development, investment 
and asset management
where it has competitive edge.
We develop urban
regeneration sites, invest 
for a combination of income
and uplift in net asset value
(NAV), and manage property
assets in sectors where
we believe there are high
barriers to entry, such as
healthcare. Income from 
the investment portfolio 
and from asset management
finances the development
projects, which have potential
for exceptional returns.

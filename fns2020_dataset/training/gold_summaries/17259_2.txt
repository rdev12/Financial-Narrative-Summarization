dend for the year Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 01 The Wolseley Group
The Wolseley Group 
is the world’s number one
distributor of heating and
plumbing products and 
is a leading supplier of
building materials to the
professional market
Wolseley is a unique business. No other organisation,
anywhere in the world, is truly comparable.
Where many distributors are nationally focused, 
we cross geographies. Where they may concentrate 
on narrow product lines, we distribute a diverse 
range to meet a wide spectrum of needs.
Our customers are drawn from across the industry; 
self-employed contractors, large construction 
businesses and governments all depend on 
Wolseley’s expertise.
We meet the demands of these customers by 
providing the products and services they need, 
when and where they need them, at prices that 
help them to achieve their objectives.

Chairman’s statement
Rolf Stahel
Chairman
“Ergomed is prospering and 
making progress on multiple 
fronts. The strategy that we 
laid out at IPO is coming  
to life.”
Our 2015 results and recent 
announcements demonstrate 
Ergomed is prospering and making 
progress on multiple fronts. The 
strategy that we laid out at IPO is 
coming to life. Your Board continues 
to seek opportunities to create 
significant shareholder value, 
drawing upon the experience and 
expertise Ergomed has accumulated 
during its 16 years as a contract 
research organisation. Select 
acquisitions of complementary 
services businesses and expansion of 
our co-development portfolio are key 
components of our growth strategy 
and we intend to deliver on both.
We have made two additions to our 
executive team and Board; Andrew 
Mackie as Chief Business Officer and 
Stephen Stamp as Chief Financial 
Officer. I would like to welcome them 
and congratulate Neil Clark on his 
promotion to Chief Executive Officer 
– PrimeVigilance.
Lastly, I would like to thank the other 
members of the Board, Ergomed’s 
employees and our advisors for all 
their hard work in 2015 and, based  
on our continued combined efforts,  
I look to the future with confidence.

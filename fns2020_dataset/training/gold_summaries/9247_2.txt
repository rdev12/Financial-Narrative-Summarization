 Laird PLC    01   
Financial highlights
 Explanatory notes:
(i)  Laird uses underlying results as key performance indicators. Underlying proﬁ t before tax and underlying earnings per share 
are stated before exceptional items, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible 
assets and goodwill, the gain or loss on disposal of businesses and the impact arising from the fair valuing of ﬁ nancial 
instruments. The narrative that follows is based on underlying operating proﬁ t, underlying proﬁ t before tax and underlying 
earnings per share, as the directors believe that these provide a more consistent measure of operating performance.
(ii)  Excludes a special dividend of 50p per share paid in June 2007.
*  The weighted average number of shares used to calculate earnings per share was 177.2 million in 2008 and 185.9 million 
in 2007, following the 8 for 9 share consolidation on 11 June 2007.
The Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008 contains the Directors’ report on 
pages 3-46.

STRATEGIC REPORT
GROUP AT A GLANCE:
STRENGTH THROUGH DIVERSITY
Carr’s is an international group focussed on developing innovative solutions for our global customers. The Group’s 
distribution network spans over 35 countries worldwide, and the geographic and divisional diversity lies at the 
centre of our strategy. During the year the Group consisted of three divisions, however, on 3 September 2016 the 
Food division was sold leaving the Agriculture and Engineering divisions, which operate in markets that offer growth 
prospects. Our diverse geographic and divisional exposure provides strength in an increasingly volatile global 
economic environment.

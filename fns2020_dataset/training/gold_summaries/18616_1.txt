chiefexecutive’ sreview
The Market The UK residential market has shown strong levels of growth in the 
12-month period to the end of September – both the Nationwide and the Halifax House
Price Indices showed year-on-year growth of 8.2%. Healthy growth levels were recorded 
in most parts of the country with London and the South East showing particular increases
in the latter part of the year. Our own portfolio, which has some 59% by value in London
and the South East, showed an average increase of 9.1%. 
The increase in interest rates in August has done little to deter price growth and it is 
too early to say what impact the November movement will have, although it is likely that
lenders will pass on a higher proportion of the increase to their customers than seems 
to have been the case to date. Since September, we have seen the annualised October
Halifax Index rise to 8.7% and sales from our own portfolio have been achieving prices
3% above our September vacant possession values. This ﬁgure should, however, be
treated with some caution because of the relatively low number of transactions involved. 
Our major business areas share a common theme: an ability to 
generate superior returns through our expertise in owning, managing,
developing and trading residential property either directly or as 
co-investor. We are pleased with the progress made in these areas 
in the year and are excited by the opportunities we are creating. 
RUPERT DICKINSON Chief executive 21
The UK residential market has shown signiﬁcant growth levels over extended periods 
of time: the average UK house price in 1986 was £41,000; in 2006 that has risen to
£181,000, an annual compound growth rate of just under 8%. Much of this has come 
in the last ﬁve years where the equivalent rate has been 14%. Whilst the economic and
interest rate outlook are likely to dampen these rates, we still remain conﬁdent of the 
long term potential of the residential market. We believe that our core portfolio is
particularly well placed to withstand short term ﬂuctuations. It has a broad geographical
base but also a strong core in London and the South East where average annual values 
are expected to remain ﬁrm because of high demand. The average vacant possession 
value of the individual properties in our main reversionary portfolio, the regulated
tenancies, is £182,000 and some 31% of the portfolio is within 20% of that ﬁgure. 
We have relatively few properties at the more volatile top end of the market and as the
majority of our properties are unmodernised there is usually strong demand from ﬁrst 
or second time buyers and property developers who wish to improve the property.

Our Business Core Portfolio – Regulated Tenancies Our core portfolio consists
primarily of regulated tenancies which account for 54% by value of our total property 
and investment interests. At 30 September 2006, we owned 7,715 regulated units 
valued at £1,090m (2005: 8,161 units at £984m). At the same date, the vacant 
possession value (the value at which we hope to sell them when vacant at today’s prices)
of the regulated portfolio amounted to £1,403m (2005: £1,349m). Including our share 
of regulated tenancies held within joint ventures, the vacant possession value becomes
£1,474m (2005: £1,367m). 
The regulated portfolio is valued by deducting a discount from the vacant possession
value. This discount takes account of the fact that the rental yield is generally below
market rates and that it may be some years before we obtain vacant possession and 
can then sell the property. Over time, this discount has narrowed although for the last 
few years we have used a rate of 27.5%. Strong market and transaction activity has 
led us to believe that this discount is conservative and our valuers have now certiﬁed 
the valuation of these properties at 77.5% of vacant possession value – a discount of 
22.5%. This realignment has produced an increase in value at the year end of £67m.
In addition to regulated tenancies, our core portfolio includes a further 652 units
comprising vacants, assured tenancies short term lets, and other interests. These 
units have a value at 30 September 2006 of £141m (2005: £117m) and their vacant
possession value is £160m (2005: £124m).

NB: shows full vacant possession of equity release assets even if we own less than 100%. 
Sales in this division have remained constant at £126m and margins on normal sales 
(i.e. when a property is sold on vacancy as opposed to with a tenant in situ) amounted 
to 48.6% (2005: 48.5%). Including net rental and other income of £24m, the regulated
chief executive’s review continued 23
portfolio produced an operating contribution of £76m (2005: £74m). The 2005 ﬁgure

For a portfolio of this type it is essential that we recycle capital – during the year, we
acquired 325 units for a consideration of £44m. The highlight of the year, however, 
was the acquisition of ﬁve London apartment blocks for £196m from the Church
Commissioners in the second 50:50 joint venture of this type with the Genesis Housing
Group. This portfolio included 429 regulated units.

Equity Release The equity release business is a strong ﬁt and a natural investment
channel for the surplus cash generated by our regulated business. We are building up a
highly reversionary portfolio which will provide us with the long term geared exposure 
to the residential market that we strategically seek. We have been building our portfolio
through three primary routes – our distribution agreement with Norwich Union, portfolio
acquisitions and our Bridgewater brand.

The market value of our 3,003 unit equity release portfolio at 30 September 2006 stood 
at £241m, with a vacant possession value of £421m (2005: 2,663 units with a market
value of £196m, vacant possession value of £354m). During the year, we acquired 
432 units for £29m and sold 110 units for £13m. The division produced an operating

This is a market in which critical mass, service integrity and product innovation and
development are key. We were therefore delighted to receive the ‘Award for Innovation’ 
at the Investment, Life and Pension Awards 2006. 
Critical mass will enable us to put in place more efﬁcient forms of ﬁnancing, while 
product development will help us to provide a greater selection of retirement solutions 
to potential customers. 
Since the year end we have announced an offer to acquire a portfolio of over 900
retirement properties, which are subject to lifetime leases, or are currently vacant.
Market-Rented Properties Over the years, the group has acquired a number of market
rented properties usually as a result of purchases of mixed tenure portfolios. This was
bolstered by the acquisition of City North Group plc in 2005, and by the start of this
ﬁnancial year we owned 1,102 market rented properties with a value of £188m. We believe
that we can maximise returns from such a portfolio by introducing third party equity and
non-recourse debt, with Grainger retaining a substantial investment and obtaining the
beneﬁt of asset and property management fees. 
Consequently, during the year, we transferred the bulk of our market rented properties to
a JPUT and then marketed the holding as G:res 1, an independent Jersey exempt company,
to institutional investors. Although we still owned all of the units at 30 September 2006,
we announced ﬁrst closing on 22 November 2006 having raised third party equity
commitments of £56m. We are expecting to secure further equity commitments of £69m in
due course and see this as a model for other co-invested funds which we could establish. 
chief executive’s review continued 25
In G:res 1 at the year end, we had 1,178 market rented properties with a market value 
of £210m and a vacant possession value of £238m, producing operating proﬁt before
valuation gains of £4.6m. 
Property and Asset Management One of Grainger’s key strengths is its ability to provide
property and asset management services to third parties with the specialist expertise
derived from being a substantial owner in its own right. Almost uniquely we can provide
these services across the UK through our seven managing ofﬁces and network of managing
agents. We expanded this capability into mainland Europe in October when we opened 
an ofﬁce in Mannheim to manage our growing German residential portfolio.
In total we employ 103 staff in our property and asset management division. As well as
taking responsibility for our own UK portfolio of 12,420 residential units they also provide
services for a total of 2,801 units for third party owners or for joint venture vehicles in
which we are participants. This includes the Schroders ResPUT, in which we hold a 22.3%
stake and the joint ventures with the Genesis Housing Group. 
Our property managers also support our own market rented fund, G:res 1, which was
valued at 30 September 2006 at £210m; we anticipate that, before any performance
related elements, this will generate annualised fee income for the group of approximately
£2.2m. Our total recurring fee income will be approximately £4m per year. 
We see great potential for the fund management structure to be applied to other areas 
of our business, most obviously our European portfolio.

Development Grainger Development is an important proﬁt contributor to the group 
and provides us with entrepreneurial development skills which complement our other
spheres of residential expertise. We have reﬁned our focus in this division to concentrate
on larger scale residential or residential-led mixed use opportunities, particularly in those
areas where the longevity of the project, the need to work with partners or the nature of
the development itself makes it unsuitable for housebuilders. 
At the year end, the value of our UK development portfolio stood at £90m (2005: £124m)
and the division produced operating proﬁts and proﬁts on the sale of ﬁxed assets totalling
£7m (2005: £13m). Major gross contributions were £2.8m from The Glasshouse, Putney,
£2.5m from sales of three properties in Slough and £2.3m from the ongoing sales of
Grainger Homes sites. The decrease in returns compared to the prior year was foreseen
and reﬂects the predictable but volatile nature of the proﬁt stream in any development
business. It is our ambition to enable this division to produce a more steady ﬂow of returns
but given that many of our current projects are at an early stage of development, this may
be some time in the future. 
At 30 September, the completed development value of our sites is estimated at £675m, 
of which £178m has planning consent.

During the year, we outsourced project management and delivery responsibility for
Grainger Homes to its then management. Although we retain ownership of the existing
sites, representing a future bank of some 318 new houses and will receive proﬁts as they
are sold, it is not our intention to have future involvement in small-scale housebuilding
activities where we are competing directly against national and/or local housebuilders. 
There has been signiﬁcant progress in planning on our major sites in the year. At the
Barnsbury Complex in Islington we have achieved detailed planning consent on a scheme
comprising 140 private and affordable residential units. At Hornsey Road Baths, Islington,
we have commenced demolition at the start of the development of new council ofﬁces,
200 private and affordable units and community buildings. We were also pleased to obtain
planning consent for 94 residential units and a 26,000 sq. ft. ofﬁce building at Macaulay
Road, Clapham after many years of endeavour. We have also submitted an outline planning
application for 1,550 residential units, 12 hectares of employment use and 14 hectares 
of mixed use at our site at West Waterlooville. Other major sites in our current portfolio
include two large residential schemes in the North East of England which will deliver
approximately 300 housing units. Further details on when these projects are expected to
become income producing are shown in the Financial Review later in this report. 
The division’s future pipeline includes a scheme above Seven Sisters underground station
for 327 residential units and 53,000 sq. ft. of retail under a co-operation agreement 
with the London Borough of Haringey and appointment as preferred developer by
Newbury Council to develop 331 units and 47,000 sq. ft of retail at Market Street 
in the town centre. 
Since the year end, we have been delighted to announce the ﬁrst joint venture acquisition
with Development Securities plc under the co-operation agreement we revealed previously.
This is for the 10 acre Curzon Park site in Birmingham, with an end value in the region 
of £350m-£400m. It will provide a mixed use scheme of c. 1.4 million sq. ft. to include 
c. 800,000 sq. ft. of grade A ofﬁce space, c. 400,000 sq. ft. of residential accommodation,
a 180 bed hotel and c. 30,000 sq. ft. of retail space.
We see our ability and willingness to work with partners (other developers, land owners,
councils, housing associations) as being key to giving us access to the larger mixed use
residential-led schemes on which we aim to focus. This enables us to achieve scale without
taking on a disproportionate level of risk. 
We have invested heavily in the human capital of this division in the year and feel that 
we now have the team to deliver our vision.  28 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2006

Europe At this stage last year we were looking forward to completing our ﬁrst 
acquisition of 1,406 German residential properties. At 30 September 2006, the 
portfolio stood at 2,739 units and, as announced in October, we have acquired 
a further 308 units in Munich with anticipated completion early in 2007.

Whilst we are constantly examining other areas for potential residential investment,
Germany still holds attraction for us. A combination of low levels of home ownership, 
an attractive ﬁnancing environment enabling us to achieve a positive yield spread, low
price levels relative to other European markets and potential for rental growth provides
good opportunities for experienced professional landlords. 
At 30 September, our portfolio comprised 186,844 sq. metres of residential space at 
a cost of £117m (generally below replacement cost) and providing an annualised gross 
rent of £7.5m. The operating contribution of the division in the year was £2.0m. 
There has been considerable comment on the opportunities for residential investment in
Germany and it is clear that competition for portfolios is ﬁerce. However, we are constantly
pursuing opportunities and our decision to open a small management ofﬁce in Mannheim
illustrates our commitment and enthusiasm for this sector. 
It is our ambition to grow the German portfolio to a size where it becomes an attractive
proposition for third party investment and where we can apply our strategic model for 
co-investing fund management.
In addition to our residential interests we also have an 81.6% stake in a company registered
in the Czech Republic. This company owns a well positioned development site of 21 acres in
Zizkov to the East of Prague City Centre. The site is designated as a mixed use development
site and we are hopeful of receiving a detailed planning consent in 2008.  29
Robert Dickinson We would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Robert
Dickinson who retires as Chairman at the conclusion of our next Annual General Meeting.
Robert was made a director of Grainger in 1961 and has been Chairman since 1992. 
Since 1961, Grainger has evolved from a small family company through initial listing on 
the then Unlisted Securities Market, full listing and is now the UK’s largest listed residential
property company. This tenure has seen a remarkable period of growth and return. 
A shareholder who had invested £10,000 in Grainger shares on ﬂotation in March 1983
would, at 30 September, have had shares worth £438,124 and would have beneﬁted from
£30,210 in dividends, including the proposed 2006 ﬁnal dividend. Further, if dividends had
been reinvested on receipt, the shareholder would, at 30 September, have had shares
worth £738,565*.
In a long term business like Grainger it has proved invaluable to have someone who has
been able to provide unrivalled experience and knowledge of the group and its market
over such a long continuous period. We have been fortunate to have been the recipients
of his wise and expert leadership.

This is an exciting time within the telecom and 
data communication industries with increasing 
investment in both proven and emerging 
technologies driving demand for our leading 
test solutions. 2010 was an excellent year for 
Spirent – one in which we delivered a strong 
performance through the execution of our 
strategy. Our broad test solution portfolio 
coupled with our global reach gives us the 
ability to pursue further profitable growth in 
2011 and beyond.
Markets and strategy
The fundamental drivers for growth in our industry are strong, as 
consumers and businesses demand anytime, anywhere, always-on 
access to data, applications and services. As a result, service 
provider and enterprise IT spending has returned, either to seek new 
revenue streams or to resolve challenges associated with network 
capacity and performance. Spirent’s expertise is in delivering test 
solutions that capitalise on data center transformation, cloud 
computing, the concept of Ethernet everywhere, the proliferation  
of new wireless devices and infrastructure, and applications that 
enrich our lives. 
Executing on our strategy delivered profitable growth for Spirent and 
a strong overall financial performance in 2010 which enabled us to 
increase sales by 13 per cent and adjusted basic earnings per share 
by 31 per cent year-on-year. Spirent delivers best in class financial 
performance compared to its peers. Our pace of innovation leads the 
test and measurement market. The key elements of our strategy are 
to focus on growing and emerging technology markets, to invest in 
our people and to utilise innovation to deliver the “right solutions”  
to the global market at the “right time”. These strategic goals have 
been furthered through the hard work, dedication and enthusiasm of 
our people. It is key to Spirent’s success and future that we continue 
to develop our employees, reward them and recognise their  
critical contribution. 
Spirent’s solutions span all major technologies and serve all major 
customer segments across the telecommunication industry. We have 
prioritised engineering development spending on areas that matter 
most to customers such as the evolution of wireless technologies to 
4G/LTE, high speed Ethernet, next-generation data centers, wireless 
infrastructure and application performance. Our worldwide sales  
and service organisation has industry leading capability, serving  
over 1,300 customers globally across all segments including network 
equipment manufacturers, mobile device manufacturers, service 
providers, enterprise and governments as we enable the 
development of technology from inception to deployment in  
live networks.
Outlook
The outlook is promising with our customers making new 
investments to bring next-generation technologies to market, as a 
result we are confident that the market for test and measurement will 
show further growth in 2011 and future years. Ethernet, wireless 
device and positioning test markets all show positive signs for growth 
in 2011. We continue to invest in new test solutions and in enhancing 
our current capabilities in the areas that matter most to our customers 
as they look to improve time to market of their industry leading 
products and services. We enter the year with the industry’s broadest 
and, we believe, most innovative test solution portfolio. Additional 
investment in product development to drive innovation coupled with 
a relentless focus on executing our strategy will enable Spirent to 
continue to prosper. 10 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2010

What we test
example:
Application Experience
Spirent provides hardware and software tools and test 
methodologies that enable testing of the performance of 
network equipment, devices and applications during the 
development phase. We apply the expertise gained through 
this testing to our service assurance solutions, which allow 
service providers to diagnose, troubleshoot and determine  
how to resolve issues within live networks. 
Ethernet has become the de facto standard for service providers, as well as the enterprise, 
across all aspects of the network, from access to the edge to the core, due to its cost 
effectiveness, scale and ability to support a wide range of applications. Spirent’s leadership 
in Ethernet testing allows us to benefit significantly from the sustained growth in Ethernet 
use across all communication and IT markets. We test network equipment which utilises 
Ethernet at ever-increasing scale, including switches, routers, evolved packet core network 
elements, firewalls, load balancers and intrusion detection/intrusion prevention.
For service provider networks (see diagram) we test all service layers of the network, 
including those that require high data capacity and those that deliver application scale or 
security. Spirent TestCenter is a single, converged performance test platform to test 
application experience and backhaul networks, as well as mobility, interoperability and 
40/100G Ethernet in core networks. We also test the service quality, security and 
application performance of content delivery networks, cloud applications and the internet.
For the enterprise, Spirent is well positioned to benefit from the move of applications  
into public/private clouds and from the growth from Enterprise NEMs who are building 
next-generation cloud infrastructure and cloud service devices. The rapid convergence of 
data center technologies such as storage over Ethernet, high speed Ethernet and virtual 
servers running multiple applications in the cloud, is pushing the boundaries of testing. 
Spirent has released virtualized variants of its solutions to provide unsurpassed visibility 
into the entire data center infrastructure. These take advantage of Spirent’s innovative  
PASS methodology to test the performance, availability, security and scalability of cloud 
computing networks.
New testing needs for wireless devices are driven by smartphone growth and the  
associated exponential growth in mobile data, which leads service providers to look to  
new technologies such as LTE and to the cost and efficiency advantages of all-IP networks. 
Spirent is a leader in functional, conformance and performance testing of 3G and 4G/LTE 
devices, including smartphones and data cards. Spirent also has a long track record as the 
leader in testing the performance of location technology that supports location based 
services on smartphones, including over-the-air testing.
Spirent is the worldwide leader in testing GNSS receiving devices. While GPS remains the 
most widely used system, others such as GLONASS, Galileo and COMPASS are gaining 
ground, with other positioning techniques such as use of Wi-Fi access points also growing  
in popularity. Spirent is able to test the performance of all of these technologies, as they 
become embedded in an ever-broader range of applications, from smartphones and 
vehicles to aerospace and government. Wireless User Emulation

 “Cairn has delivered on its key objectives for 2011: 
completion of the sale of 40% of Cairn India, the return 
of $3.5 bn to shareholders and the farm-down of the Pitu 
block in Greenland to Statoil.
With full cycle capabilities and balance sheet strength, 
Cairn is well positioned to create significant value from 
transformational exploration, within a well balanced 
portfolio of exploration and production assets.”

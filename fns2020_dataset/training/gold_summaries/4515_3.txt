Board
I am delighted that Carl Leaver joined the
Group as Chief Executive on 
1 September 2003. Carl joined from
Whitbread plc where, for three years, he
held the position of Managing Director 
of Travel Inn, managing its roll-out
programme. Prior to this he was
Operations Director of Marriott Country
Club golf resort hotels. Carl brings a fresh
approach based on significant sector
experience, strong operational
background and a personal energy to
take the Group forward. 
I would also like to thank Paul Dermody
for his significant contribution over 40
years of service, culminating in the last
three and a half years as Chief Executive.
Most significantly he led the Group’s
transformation to a focused hotels and
health & fitness business, which has
performed strongly despite difficult
market conditions. We wish him all the
best for the future.
People
We continually strive to achieve excellent
customer service, delivered with
enthusiasm and passion, and regularly
review public perception. The results
clearly tell us that De Vere Group has
employees who make a difference to our
business and it is their commitment that
has helped deliver another year of strong
results. On behalf of the Board, I would
like to thank all the teams for their
contribution to the business. 
Current trading and outlook
During the first nine weeks of the current
financial year, total Group turnover has
increased by 3.4% on last year’s strong
comparative period. Total turnover for 
De Vere Hotels has increased by 1.3% and
like-for-like RevPAR by 0.5%. For Village
Hotels & Leisure Clubs, total turnover has
increased by 1.2% and like-for-like RevPAR
by 4.7%. Greens total turnover has
increased by 8.0%.
Trading patterns remain volatile, 
although recent booking trends are more
encouraging. We remain confident that,
with the strength of our brands, we will
continue to deliver long-term growth.

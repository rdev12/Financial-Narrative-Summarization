Epistem Holdings Plc
Annual Report 2012
I am pleased to report major progress in a 
number of the Company’s core development 
programmes and the acceleration of 
investment in our first diagnostic product in 
the results for the year ended 30 June 2012. 
I am also pleased to report the  
recent completion of the first high 
value commercial contract for our 
Genedrive
™
 platform with Becton 
Dickinson. This agreement coupled 
with the earlier reported Xcelris 
Laboratories agreement signals  
the beginning of a new and  
exciting phase of revenue growth 
for Epistem and its investors.
Whilst market and trading 
conditions remain volatile across 
the healthcare sector, Epistem 
continues to differentiate itself 
through its diversified business 
model and advancing technologies 
whilst delivering increasing  
investor returns. 
Results 
Further details of the results for  
the period are covered in the Chief 
Executive Officer’s review, but 
financially the year to 30 June 2012 
saw the Company deliver revenues 
of £5.6m (2011: £5.8m). Based on 
this trading performance and the 
high levels of investment made in  
our Novel Therapies and Diagnostics 
(Genedrive
™
) programmes, the 
Company moved from a prior year 
profit to reporting an after tax loss of 
£0.2m (2011: £0.4m profit after tax). 
Following the successful completion 
of the £2.7m cash placing in 
December 2011, cash reserves at 
the end of the period were £4.7m 
(2011: £3.6m). 
During the year the Company 
continued to make progress  
across each of its three divisions  
as outlined below: 
•	 Following significant revenue 
growth over the past few years, 
Contract Research Services 
revenues were steady in the  
year at £2.9m (2011: £3.0m).  
We continue to develop and 
extend our high margin service 
offerings alongside our 
cornerstone US government 
biodefence contract. 
 With market uncertainties 
persisting, the division continues 
to build on and extend its core 
scientific strengths to provide a 
solid platform for future growth. 
•	 Personalised Medicine revenue 
growth increased significantly  
up to £2.7m (2011: £1.1m), more 
than double last year’s revenue, 
largely driven by the Sanofi-
Aventis oncology and GSK 
fibrosis biomarker collaborations.  
The Personalised Medicine 
reported revenues for the year 
also included initial Genedrive
™
 
unit sales (development) of £0.4m 
(2011: £0.0m).
•	 The progress of our Genedrive
™
 
molecular diagnostic device, the 
recent EU regulatory approval 
and the announcement of major 
collaborations with Becton 
Dickinson (outside India and the 
Indian Sub Continent) and Xcelris 
Laboratories (India and Indian 
Sub Continent) in Tuberculosis 
marks the beginning of Epistem’s

Annual Report 2012
first product related revenues and 
heralds a radical change in ‘Point 
of Care’ diagnostics healthcare. 
The Board believes Genedrive
™
  
is poised to bring about a 
breakthrough in rapid, high 
sensitivity and low cost molecular 
(DNA) diagnostic testing ‘near to 
the patient’ across a broad range 
of disease areas. 
•	 Novel Therapies’s drug 
development programme 
continues to advance. Following 
the completion of the funded 
research phase of the Novartis 
collaboration in 2011, we have 
invested in the development of our 
emerging leads with the division 
reporting nil revenues for the year 
(2011: £1.6m). Collaborative 
discussions are being progressed 
with potential partners in the 
areas of Regenerative Medicine 
and Oncology. The timings of 
license opportunities and future 
development funding remains 
difficult to predict accurately. 
•	 Based on the ongoing investment 
in our Novel Therapies and 
Genedrive
™
 programmes, the 
Company now reports a loss for 
the year of £0.2m (2011: £0.4m 
profit for the year) and loss per 
share of 2.9p (2011: 4.9p earnings 
per share).
Outlook
Epistem continues to build on its 
scientific and technical heritage  
as it transforms into a diverse, 
technology leading personalised 
medicine group with the near term 
growth in product revenues which 
are now underpinned by our first 
significant and long term commercial 
contracts with world class partners. 
Against a backdrop of market 
uncertainty, Epistem remains vigilant, 
whilst increasingly positive about  
its future growth potential.
Despite the challenging market 
conditions, each division continues 
to strengthen its technology and 
expertise. The Personalised Medicine 
division has seen a significant 
improvement in Biomarker growth 
over the past year, which together 
with our rapidly advancing molecular 
diagnostic platform Genedrive
™
  
is expected to deliver accelerated 
revenue growth across the division in 
future years. The Contract Research 
Services division continues to build 
an international profile and reputation 
for its proprietary service models  
and enhance its relationship with  
the NIH under our US biodefence 
contract (3 years remaining of this  
5 year contract). We anticipate a 
return to modest growth from this 
division in the current financial year. 
The Novel Therapies funded element 
of the drug discovery collaboration 
with Novartis was completed in 2011 
and we continue to maintain our 
investment in the development of  
our identified hits/leads. Whilst the 
timing of license and development 
opportunities remains difficult  
to judge, we remain optimistic  
about the strength of our hit/lead 
programme. We are in discussions 
with a number of other collaborative 
partners in relation to the 
development of our regenerative 
medicine and oncology hits/lead 
portfolio. Epistem continues to  
refine its discovery and development 
technology to position itself as  
a world leader in therapeutic 
discovery in the field of epithelial 
stem cell regulation. 
Alongside continued strengthening 
of our divisional units and the 
commercial advance of our 
Genedrive
™
 molecular diagnostic 
product, we expect to see the 
Company significantly strengthen  
its financial performance over the 
coming year. 
I would like to thank the CEO for his 
support and leadership, the Board 
and our employees for their effort 
and commitment in driving Epistem’s 
progress over the past year, as well 
as our investors whose on-going 
support has provided a stable 
platform for our continued growth. 
On behalf of the Board, I would  
also like to offer our thoughts  
and condolences to the family  
of Professor Chris Potten who  
died recently. Chris was a world-
renowned scientist who pioneered 
stem cell research in Manchester 
and was regarded as one of  
the world’s most influential figures  
in his field. In 2000, he co-founded 
Epistem and we look forward to 
maintaining and developing the 
legacy that Chris created.

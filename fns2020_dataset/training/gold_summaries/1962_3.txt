 Chairman’s Statement
Considerable emphasis has been placed on
increasing the Company’s land bank which at 31
December 2003 stood at 1458 plots (2002: 945
plots) with an additional 123 plots where
unconditional contracts have been exchanged.
The funding for the enlarged land bank has been
achieved partly from profits and partly from
increased borrowings.  Our gearing expressed as a
percentage of net debt to shareholders funds has
increased to 75.2% from 37.8%.  The current level
of borrowings has been arranged in a structured
manner taking into account the Company’s
present trading strengths, the value of its
underlying land bank and future cash flow.
At the important level of Human Resources we
have continued to develop skills and expertise
within our organisation and to foster relationships
with suppliers and sub-contractors.  On behalf of
the Board, I wish to thank them all sincerely for
their contribution to this year’s extremely
satisfying performance.
Future Prospects
We have started the current financial year with a
highly satisfactory level of forward reservations.
This, coupled with the scope afforded by the
increased size and quality of the land under our
control, enables your Board to plan confidently
for further increases in the physical output 
of new homes.
Based upon these factors, I look forward to a year
of continuing improvements in the financial
performance of the company.
Dividend
The Board is recommending an increased final
dividend of 8.0p per share which together with
the interim dividend of 4.0p makes a total of 12.0p
for 2003.  This represents an increase of 60% over
the 2002 level of 7.5p.  This final dividend will be
paid on 14 May 2004 to shareholders on the
register at 16 April 2004.
Results
I am delighted to be able to report on a further
year of significant growth in the Company’s
business.  Pre-tax profits for the year ended 31
December 2003 increased by 71.5% to £12.88m
(2002: £7.51m), giving rise to an improved
earnings per share of 79.2p (2002: 49.3p).
T urnover advanced by 27.6% to £62.8m (2002:
£49.2m), aided by increased activity levels and
more importantly, operating margins improved 
to 21.9% from 16.4% achieved in 2002.  
Review of Operations
As reported to you in my trading update to
shareholders in December 2003, the Company
continued to enjoy favourable trading conditions
in the area of our operations, (Yorkshire,
Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire).  Average
selling prices across the product range rose to
£139,500 per plot from £121,500 in the previous
year, an increase of 14.8%.  The Company was
also able to achieve its targeted sales output of 450
plots (2002: 405 plots), with little or no increase in
sales incentives.
The continuing momentum in our sales initiative
has been aided by the flexibility of having an
enlarged land bank and the widening of our
product range.  These factors have helped to
mitigate the delays in planning consents currently
experienced by most house builders.

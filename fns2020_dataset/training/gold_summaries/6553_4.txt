UK Housing
In the UK, George Wimpey is committed to building upon our long
track record of successful development by continuing to create new
and sustainable communities through our 28 regional businesses
and two satellite offices.
We market our homes through three brands. ‘George Wimpey’ is our
core brand and ‘Laing Homes’ our premium brand. They provide a
range of products from one bedroom apartments and starter homes
to large detached family homes. In 2006 we launched ‘G2’ our value
brand, specifically targeted at first time buyers and key workers. G2
provides affordable, quality one and two bedroom apartments at
highly competitive prices.
The UK housing market was broadly stable throughout 2006,
recovering well from the slow market conditions experienced in
2005. Strong demand, weak supply and a healthy economic situation
continue to underpin the market and provide George Wimpey UK
with considerable scope for future growth.

US Housing
Morrison Homes, our US business, continues to build on its strong
reputation for excellence by delivering high quality homes with
industry leading levels of customer service. Spanning five states, the
business operates within 13 markets, all of which have strong long
term demographic prospects. We traditionally build a wide range of
single family homes and in response to changing demand within the
market, we have introduced more compact townhomes to our
product range.
Over the last few years Morrison Homes has benefited from the strong
market conditions in the US. 2006 proved to be more challenging as
the housing market slowed considerably. The competitive market
conditions look set to continue in the short term until the current
oversupply in the housing market returns to normal levels.
Despite its short term weakening, we feel confident about the long
term outlook for the US housing market with strong demographic
trends likely to drive demand for housing. As the market stabilises
Morrison Homes is well placed to strengthen its regional positions
to deliver long term growth.

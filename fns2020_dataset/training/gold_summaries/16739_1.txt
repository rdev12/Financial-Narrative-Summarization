 Group Chief Executive’s Review 4
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
PATRICK HAREN
The Group has delivered a strong set of results with pro-forma
operating profit from continuing operations (based on regulated
entitlement) increasing from £119.1m to £132.4m.
NIE’s businesses have each delivered strong performances.  NIE’s
focus remains on cost reduction and efficiency while also ensuring
quality of service to our customers.
NIAER’s review of T&D’s next price control, which takes effect from
April 2007, is well underway following the publication of initial
proposals in December 2005 and we await final proposals.  We 
also await the outcome of NIAER’s review of the price controls for
Power Procurement Business (PPB) and the transmission system
operator, SONI, which were both due to be reset with effect from 
1 April 2006.
VP&E’s profit contribution for the year reduced slightly to £24.1m
(2005 - £25.0m) due to lower operating margins for Energia, offset
by higher sales volumes and an active trading strategy in the winter
period.  Energia now has 22,400 (2005 - 15,300) business
customers across Ireland, this growth coming from customers in the
small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector.
The SEM, the new all-island electricity wholesale market, is
scheduled to start in July 2007.  SONI is working with its RoI
counterpart, ESB National Grid (Eirgrid), NIAER and the Commission
for Energy Regulation (CER) in the RoI to set up the new market.
Other Group businesses are actively participating in consultations on
the market design and rules as well as reviewing their own
processes and systems to identify any changes required.
Northern Ireland Electricity
Transmission and Distribution
T&D revenues (based on regulated entitlement) increased by £0.9m
mainly due to higher income associated with the recovery of market
opening costs, offset by lower price control revenues.  Based on
regulated entitlement, T&D reported profits of £83.2m compared to
£73.9m last year.  Profits benefited from a change in the method of
depreciation for infrastructure assets which brings T&D into line with
the majority of UK distribution network operators (DNOs).  Before 
31 March 2005, T&D infrastructure assets were depreciated at 3%
per annum for the first 20 years followed by 2% per annum for the
remaining 20 years.  Since 1 April 2005, new assets are being
depreciated on a straight-line basis over 40 years and existing assets
on a straight-line basis over their remaining life.  This change
resulted in a reduction of £4.5m in T&D’s depreciation charge from
what it otherwise would have been.  Profits also benefited from
reductions in operating costs and the absence of certain
restructuring and reorganisation costs incurred last year.  In
particular, cost savings were achieved as a result of centralising
customer call handling at our distribution control centre in
Craigavon; this included the transfer to T&D of some services
previously provided by Sx3.  Cost efficiencies also resulted from a
lower headcount.
While we continually exert downward pressure on T&D’s costs, this
is not at the expense of standards of service to our customers.
During the year, all the overall standards set by NIAER were
achieved and there were no defaults against the guaranteed
standards.  We fully recognise our responsibility to maintain and
operate a safe and reliable network. 
We continue to make substantial investment in our infrastructure
assets.  Network capital expenditure in the year ended 31 March
2006 was in line with the regulatory allowance.  Total capital
expenditure (before customer contributions), including expenditure
on customer service systems, other non-network assets and new
systems required to support market opening in Northern Ireland,
was £73.5m (2005 - £72.5m).  The T&D regulatory asset base
(RAB) at 31 March 2006 was £783m (2005 - £754m).
In December 2005, NIAER published initial proposals for the next
T&D price control, which will be effective from April 2007 to March
2012 (RP4).  The key aspects of the proposals are described below:
Rate of return - NIAER proposes to adopt the precedent established
in the 2005 DNO review for the post tax rate of return to be allowed
on the distribution portion of T&D’s RAB (which is taken to represent
82% of the overall RAB) but to apply a lower rate to the 18%
representing the transmission portion.  This results in a blended rate
of 4.78% post tax real.  This compares to the existing rate of return
of 4.55% post tax real (corresponding to 6.5% pre tax real).
The proposed rate of return for the distribution portion of the RAB
would either decrease or remain unchanged for the last two years of
RP4 depending on the outcome of the next DNO review in 2010.
The rate of return on the transmission portion would remain
unchanged.
Controllable costs - the allowance for each year of RP4 would be set
equal to the RPI-indexed level of actual costs incurred during the
corresponding year in RP3 (April 2002 - March 2007).  This is
subject to some specific reductions in 2007/08 and 2008/09 and
also a small disallowance in respect of early retirement pension
deficiency costs.
The allowance for controllable costs would be further reduced if the
T&D price in any year of RP4 would otherwise exceed a price cap of
1.81p/kWh (in 2004/05 prices).
Capital expenditure - T&D has proposed capital expenditure of
£326m in RP4 compared to £257m in the current price control
period (both figures in 2004/05 prices).  This investment is driven by
the need to replace worn assets and to meet continued growth in
customer demand.  These proposals have been the subject of review
during the early part of 2006 by consultants appointed by NIAER.  Viridian Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005-2006
Group Chief Executive’s Review 5
Other - NIE would be committed to funding a £1m vulnerable
customer fund to help alleviate fuel poverty in Northern Ireland and
a further £1m to fund research focused on identifying the best long-
term options for development of the T&D network to accommodate
Government objectives on sustainability.  These costs would be
funded from NIE’s own resources.
NIAER outlined in the initial proposals that it expected to issue final
proposals in spring 2006; we await these shortly.
Power Procurement/SONI
Profits from PPB and SONI (based on regulated entitlement)
increased to £9.8m (2005 - £7.2m), reflecting increased entitlement
earned by PPB under its trading incentive together with the recovery
of certain costs which were provided for last year.  PPB’s
contribution from trading has been strong this year as the result of
operational difficulties at the independent Coolkeeragh CCGT plant,
which we do not expect to be repeated.
SONI is working jointly with Eirgrid, NIAER and CER to implement
the SEM.  The principal steps are: establishing a single market
operator through a contractual joint venture between SONI and
Eirgrid; setting up the necessary operational and commercial
interfaces between the two companies in their roles as transmission
system operator in each jurisdiction; and procuring the IT systems
required to operate the new market.  The capital costs are being
split 25% SONI, 75% Eirgrid.  SONI is receiving a rate of return on
its costs of 6.5% pre tax real.
NIE Supply
NIE Supply’s profits (based on regulated entitlement) increased to
£7.4m (2005 - £6.8m) due to lower operating costs and increased
incentive income from the administration of energy efficiency
programmes.  The business is making good progress in delivering
specific commitments linked to its price control in the areas of
keypad meter installation and the promotion of energy efficiency and
micro-renewables.  NIE Supply’s price control is due to be reset with
effect from 1 April 2007; we will be seeking to extend it by
agreement with NIAER.
Powerteam
Powerteam made steady progress during the year increasing its
profits to £4.6m (2005 - £3.8m) due to an increase in internal
income and improved margins; its main focus continues to be on
costs to T&D.  Over the last three years Powerteam’s external
business has been underpinned by a framework contract awarded in
June 2003 for the refurbishment of ESB’s medium voltage network.
This contract is due to end in June 2006.  Powerteam is developing
new revenue streams including further work with ESB, contracts for
the installation of windfarms in Ireland and overhead line and
substation contracts in Great Britain.
Viridian Power & Energy
VP&E has delivered a sound performance in the year.  Revenue
increased from £272.3m to £381.1m primarily due to volume growth
in the RoI, higher prices associated with rising fuel costs and sales
to gas customers.  Operating profit reduced slightly to £24.1m (2005
- £25.0m).
Generation
Huntstown 1 has performed well during 2005/06 achieving
availability (after both planned and unplanned outages) of 93.9%
(2005 - 92.5%).  The plant responded well to flexible despatch at
certain periods during the winter, as provided for in its design for
open-cycle as well as combined-cycle operation.  In April 2006,
Huntstown 1 incurred an unplanned outage lasting 19 days to repair
damage caused by a failed heat shield in the gas turbine.  This work
was successfully completed at the beginning of May.
At 31 March 2006, Huntstown 1’s gas requirements for the seven
month period to October 2006 were c90% hedged.  We await the
outcome of CER’s consultation on tariff-setting mechanisms for
calendar year 2007 before taking any decisions on hedging beyond
October 2006.  At 31 March 2006, Huntstown 1’s requirements for
CO
2
emission credits were fully covered for the year ending 
31 March 2007 by forward purchase contracts. 
The construction programme for Huntstown 2 is on track for
commissioning in autumn 2007 with capital expenditure of €27m as
at 31 March 2006.  Civil engineering works have proceeded well and
the main equipment is due to arrive on site during summer 2006.
Supply
In Northern Ireland, Energia’s sales increased from 1.5TWh to
1.6TWh, with customer sites maintained at 3,800 (2005 - 3,800)
notwithstanding some pressure on prices as the output from the new
Coolkeeragh CCGT was sold into the market.  Energia plans to
maintain its current level of volume sales in Northern Ireland. 
In the RoI, Energia increased its sales from 3.1TWh to 3.9TWh, with
customer sites increasing to 18,600 (2005 - 11,500), primarily
among SMEs.  Energia is growing its customer base to absorb the
future output of Huntstown 2. 
As indicated in the interim results, Energia has experienced pressure
on operating margins following the setting of electricity tariffs by CER
in the RoI for calendar year 2006, against a background of high gas
prices.  The effect of this has been partly offset by increased sales
and an active trading strategy.  The latter involved, inter alia,
increased purchases of electricity from ESB on a regulated
wholesale tariff at times of very high gas prices and additional
income from Huntstown 1 when despatched to meet system security
in the RoI. Group Chief Executive’s Review 6
We are making an active input into CER’s current consultations on
the appropriate level of RoI tariffs for calendar year 2007.  These
tariffs, which are published by ESB following agreement with CER,
set the benchmark for contracts between suppliers (such as Energia)
and customers participating in the competitive market.  We expect
the process to be challenging, given the level of forward gas prices
for winter 2006/07 and the planned introduction of the SEM halfway
through the tariff year.  We expect tariff proposals for the first six
months of 2007 to be issued at the beginning of September followed
by a final announcement in early October.
During the year, Energia started to supply a number of large
customers in the RoI with gas, generating revenues of £11m (14m
therms); annualised volume is c23m therms.
Renewable energy
Since 1 April 2005, suppliers in Northern Ireland have been required
to source a proportion of their supply from renewable generation.
Energia currently has 33MW of windfarm capacity under contract
and is aiming to negotiate further contracts with windfarm
developers, either as offtake arrangements, or through direct
investment where projected returns are appropriate.  Windfarm
development in Northern Ireland has been slower than expected 
as a result of planning delays.
In April 2005 the RoI government announced details of a new
support mechanism for renewable energy.  Under the mechanism,
renewable generators will contract with suppliers at a fixed price 
and suppliers will benefit from support payments levied across all
customers.  Energia is assessing offtake contracts with windfarm
developers under this scheme, which only received final approval 
on 2 May 2006. 
Other Activities
Other profits of £3.9m (2005 - £2.5m) benefited from the 
disposal of property.  We do not anticipate any further significant
property disposals.

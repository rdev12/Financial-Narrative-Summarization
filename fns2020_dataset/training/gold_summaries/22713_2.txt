 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 3
We have a balanced business with two 
differentiated, complementary divisions 
and a clear strategy for growth over 
the medium term. Growth in the 
Housebuilding division is underpinned 
by the Group’s industry-leading 
strategic land bank of 19,322 plots. 
89 per cent of this land is strategically 
sourced via options and conditional 
contracts with an average 10 per 
cent discount to open market value.
The Partnerships model complements 
the Housebuilding division with a low 
risk, capital-light model building homes 
on public sector land, typically local 
authority estate regeneration and 
brownfield sites. The Group has a 
strong track record of partnership 
development and has an excellent 
pipeline of future work of 14,504 
plots including those at preferred

Annual Report and Accounts 2013 03
Introduction
Northern Petroleum’s 
primary assets are in 
Alberta, Canada and offshore the 
Southern Adriatic, Italy. The Albertan 
redevelopment project is the first move of a 
production led growth strategy, which should 
provide the business with measurable growth in 
production, reserves and cash flow. The Southern 
Adriatic permits contain two oil discoveries, one 
with significant recoverable resources, and Cygnus, 
a world class exploration prospect 12kms from the 
producing Aquila oilfield. While the Group’s other 
assets are not currently a primary focus for the 
business, there is the potential for significant 
upside in the offshore French Guiana licence 
and the new 1.4 million acre licence 
with unconventional shale oil 
potential in the Otway Basin, 
South Australia.

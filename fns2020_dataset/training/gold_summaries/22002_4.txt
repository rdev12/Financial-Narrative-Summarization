An online department store, offering 
style for 50-plus customers and their 
families, with ranges for women, men, 
home and kids. We create unique 
silhouettes, rather than scaling 
patterns; we use real bodies, rather 
than static mannequins; and we design 
to fit – a unique, age appropriate  
point of view for our consumer. 
Simply Be has empowered women  
for over a decade, bringing fashion to 
all, regardless of size. We understand 
shape and create fashionable 
collections that fit. The brand is 
gaining significant momentum  
both at home and in the USA. 
A modern, challenger brand with a 
strong digital offer, Jacamo is inspired 
by real mens’ tastes. Collections are 
available in a market-leading range  
of sizes, from Small to 5XL. Jacamo 
brings both strong in-house ranges, 
such as Label J and Black Label, 
alongside international brands, 
offered in exclusive sizes.

The titles in this segment are focused 
on serving our loyal, traditional and 
typically more-mature customers. 
These customers tend to prefer 
paper-based marketing, such as 
catalogues and direct-mail offers.  
This is an attractive and accessible 
market, underserved by other retailers, 
and whilst not a future growth driver 
we generate a good financial return.

Secondary Brands focus on distinct 
customer niches which are not served 
by our Power Brands. These brands 
have significant customer loyalty, good 
growth prospects and are increasingly 
online. We view our Power Brands as 
having the greatest growth potential 
medium-term, however, and therefore 
our focus here is predominantly on 
customer retention.

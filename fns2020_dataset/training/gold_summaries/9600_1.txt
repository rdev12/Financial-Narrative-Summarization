 06 LUMINAR PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
As part of a policy to regenerate town
centres many local councils during the
last decade granted planning consents
for leisure use and reduced the number
of objections made to the magistrates
courts for the granting of licensing
hours beyond 11pm. This contributed
to a proliferation of licensed premises
opening in high streets across the UK.
Demand grew with the increase in
capacity as many high streets grew
into thriving leisure centres. By the
second half of 2002 demand began 
to decrease. With continued expansion
in capacity the market for high street
leisure became increasingly competitive
with many operators entering into
aggressive price competition in order to
maintain volumes. This was compounded
by operators who had developed weak
product which was inappropriate for
the late night market using discounting
as a reaction to increased competition.
Within each local market the operation
with the leading and best differentiated
offering has fared best. Marginalised
undifferentiated operations relying solely
on discounting have underperformed.
Given this material adverse change in
the market conditions from previously
highly favourable conditions, the
Company conducted a strategic review,
the results of which were announced
last November.
STRATEGY
The Board has concluded that the best
strategy to grow shareholder value 
is to pursue a policy of developing
a portfolio of branded units which will
occupy the leading trading position
within their local markets. This strategy
will meet the needs of modern leisure
consumers with consistent products
which will support strong customer
relationships and widen the user base.
Specifically, this will be accomplished
by providing an entertainment-led
experience in a safe and friendly but
exciting environment, with an emphasis
on value for money. It is the Company’s
strongly held belief that this approach
will reduce the need for ongoing
refurbishment capital costs and will
reduce trading volatility, which will
deliver consistent above average
returns over the long term.
In order to allow the Company to focus on
implementing this strategy and to apply
the appropriate management approach
to the branded and the unbranded
estate it is necessary to ring-fence
non-core unbranded businesses from
the rest of the estate. Those units
which are not ultimately capable 
of branding will be sold over time.
APPLICATION OF STRATEGY 
TO CORE ESTATE
Since January we have focused on 
four branded templates alongside the
two existing branded templates of
Chicago Rock Café and Jumpin Jaks 
for the Entertainment Division.
Each branded template will be positioned
within towns where the demographic
profile ensures that a suitable market
exists for the brand’s customer profile.
The unit will be designed with the
appropriate capacity to enable it 
to achieve a leading position within 
its local marketplace. Each brand
provides a high quality entertainment-
led leisure experience within a well
located modern property with a safe
and friendly atmosphere. The brands

will have the flexibility to be able to
cater for a wider market to increase
utilisation of the premises. Recruiting
and training the correct standard of
management is considered key to the
development of consistently branded
businesses. The Company will ensure
that adequate resources are allocated
to this important area.
Chicago Rock Café is the Company’s
longest established and most successful
brand. However, its performance over
the last financial year has reflected the
highly competitive trading conditions.
A detailed review including market
research has confirmed that the brand
has a unique position within the high
street and still has a strong appeal to
the over-25 customer. The research
demonstrates that Chicago Rock Café
is a strong brand appreciated by its
customer base but would benefit from
further capital investment. It is also
clear that some units developed in
recent years and some management
techniques used have led the brand
away from its core brand standards.
The Company has developed a clear
programme to re-invigorate the Chicago
Rock Café brand based on its core values.
The programme includes three areas;
development of 70’s style rooms adjacent
to existing units, major refits which 
will include sports bar areas and other
initiatives to develop incremental income
and a higher level of small maintenance
refurbishments to refresh the estate.
A further 43 units within the Company’s
estate benefit from strong positions
within key markets but the properties
will not currently accommodate any 
of our branded concepts. These units
will be retained for their long-term
licensing value. It is expected that 
it will be possible to develop branded
product within relevant towns over
time through acquiring space adjacent
to the existing properties or acquiring
alternative properties.
The Emerging Business Division
comprises 23 bars developed on an
experimental basis in recent years.
Given current market circumstances
the Company is reviewing the options
for this business.
APPLICATION OF STRATEGY 
TO NON-CORE ESTATE
A total of 61 units which do not fit our
branding criteria have been transferred
to a wholly-owned separate ring-fenced
subsidiary. A new management team
has been created to manage these
businesses on an entrepreneurial 
basis which is more relevant to
unbranded businesses. The new team
is headed by Tim Roberts who has
over 20 years’ experience of running
unbranded nightclubs.
The objective for the non-core 
venues is to realise maximum value 
for shareholders over the short to
medium term.
PROGRESS
The first conversion of an unbranded
nightclub to a branded template took
place in April last year when the former
Options nightclub in Kingston upon
Thames re-opened as an Oceana. Pilot
sites for the first Lava/Ignite and Life
opened in November last year in Burnley
and Wellingborough respectively.
Three units have had a complementary
70’s room developed adjacent to the
existing Chicago Rock Café and a further
Chicago Rock Café has benefited from
an extensive refit including a sports 
bar area. A further 15 Chicago Rock
Cafés benefited from more limited
refurbishments. A further 22 other
units have benefited from the
refurbishment programme.
Total capital expenditure on this
programme was £33.1m. Cash returns
on these investments during the year
amounted to 31%, including the highly
successful Oceana, Kingston. Excluding
that development, the sales uplift was
44% and the cash returns were 17%,
including initial developments of the
new branded concepts. 
In the current financial year the
Company expects to rebrand a further
11 unbranded units. Three 70’s rooms
will be added to existing Chicago Rock
Cafés, two Chicago Rock Cafés will be
extensively refurbished and a further
15 will benefit from freshen up
refurbishments. Capital expenditure

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
for these projects is expected to be 
in the region of £30m.
Last year the Company disposed of 
18 units for total proceeds of £9m. 
Of these units nine were unbranded
trading units which were sub-let. 
The remaining nine units were closed
prior to sale as they were trading 
at uneconomic levels. The Company 
will continue to close and dispose of
uneconomic units and to sell unbranded
units where appropriate prices can 
be obtained. Increasing opportunities 
are arising to utilise spare capacity for
town centre residential development. 
The Company is at an early stage in 
the programme to convert its estate 
to predominantly branded units. 
A good start has been made and the
opportunity remains to accelerate 
our plan should market conditions 
and performance allow.
FINANCIAL STRENGTH
Throughout the recent period of
uncertainty the Company has 
focused on generating surplus cash.
Last year the Company generated 
a free cash flow before dividends 
of £46m. This result, which has 
been achieved through a significant
reduction in expansion capital
expenditure, underlines the impressive
cash generating characteristics of
the business. The Company’s overall
financial position has been significantly
strengthened and it is now well
positioned to benefit from a recovery 
in its markets.
DISCOUNTING
Over the last year there has been much
debate in the media about an increase
in the discounting of alcoholic drinks by
high street leisure operators. Luminar
has always used promotional offers on
both admissions and drinks as part of
the marketing strategy to grow and
protect volumes. The Company’s
promotional schemes are agreed with
the relevant local licensing authorities
before implementation. Luminar’s
promotions as a percentage of sales
has not increased and our overall gross
margin has been maintained at over
80% for the last three years. This is in
spite of a 19% increase in duty for pre-
packaged spirits which was introduced
by the Government two years ago. 
We have consistently supported the
introduction of local council backed
minimum pricing levels and would
welcome a broadening of these schemes.
Luminar is a responsible operator on
the high street and supports the recent
Government initiatives on anti-social
drinking including the Alcohol Harm
Reduction Strategy.
DEREGULATION
The new Licensing Act, which became
law in July 2003, brought to an end 
a considerable period of uncertainty
regarding the future shape of alcohol
licensing in England and Wales. 
Under the Act, responsibility for
licensing will transfer from the judiciary
to local councils. The Government has
announced that the first appointed
date for the start of the transition
period in which the transfer from the
magistrates to the local authorities 
will take place is November 2004.
The Government’s present timetable
provides for a period of nine months to
complete the transition period. Luminar
welcomes the introduction of the new
system which is intended to reduce
crime and disorder. We believe that it is
unlikely that the authorities will permit
24-hour drinking. There may be some
relaxation of the closing time for both
pubs and nightclubs which would
benefit both sets of operators. More
importantly, the grant of new licences
will become more difficult and it is likely
that poor quality operators will have
their licences withdrawn. Both of these
measures will help to reduce the over-
capacity currently in the marketplace.
GAMING
Planned changes in the regulation 
of gaming in the UK will create
opportunities for the Company. First, 
it is likely that existing units will be 
able to increase the use of gaming
machines. Secondly, the development
of medium-sized casinos in provincial
towns with a significant entertainment
component will enable the Company 
to use its present skills and assets
within this sector.

The Company has entered into an
agreement with Accor Casinos S.A, 
the operator of 23 casinos in Europe, 
to establish a joint venture to operate 
a new concept of entertainment based
casinos. The initial pilot template will
be in Leeds, subject to approvals. 
The joint venture is intended to form
the basis of further developments 
from within our estate.
SUMMARY
Luminar has a well considered strategy
which we have started to implement on
a phased basis. I am given considerable
confidence from our performance
against our competitors, our financial
strength and the skills of our people.
Luminar has much opportunity including
new developments in the gaming
sector to leverage the quality assets
within our business.

 2 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009
Chairman’s statement
Bill Whiteley
Given the challenging global 
economic environment, I am 
pleased to report a good result 
for 2009, with record sales and 
profits that demonstrate the quality 
and resilience of our business, 
and reflect the investments and 
improvements we have continued 
to make. We generated a significant 
underlying cash inflow and the 
dividend has again been increased.
Sales at £518.7 million were up 3% 
from £502.3 million in 2008, with 
improving year-on-year comparisons 
in the last few months of the year in 
all segments. Sales included a small 
contribution from acquisitions and a 
benefit of over 10% from favourable 
average exchange rates.
Adjusted operating profit at  
£89.9 million increased by 5% from  
£85.7 million in 2008 due to reduced 
headcount and costs, especially in 
the second half-year, good pricing 
dynamics and the benefit of favourable 
exchange rates. This was reflected in 
the trading margin that improved to 
17.3% (2008: 17.1%). Operating profit 
was ahead in all segments except 
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
Net finance charges were £2.5 million 
compared with net income of  
£1.7 million in 2008, with the 
deterioration due largely to the  
impact of a turnaround in the net 
finance income related to defined 
benefit pension funds. The Group’s 
share of the after-tax profits of our 
Associate companies was unchanged 
at £2.8 million.
Adjusted pre-tax profit increased to 
£90.2 million (2008: £90.1 million) 
and earnings per share were 82.2p 
(2008: 83.4p). Cost reduction actions 
included reducing the total employee 
headcount by 7% during the year and, 
in December, we also announced  
a reduction in our French factory. 
As a result the total headcount 
reduction costs charged in 2009  
were £11.4 million with further efficiency 
gains expected in 2010. The pre-tax 
profit after charging these costs  
and including the amortisation of 
acquisition-related intangible assets 
was £76.4 million (2008: £85.2 million).
As previously reported, in October 2009 
the Group completed the acquisition of 
the Maso and Sine business from Maso 
Process-Pumpen GmbH (MasoSine) 
for £21.9 million and the integration into 
Watson-Marlow Pumps is progressing 
well. In October we also completed the 
acquisition of our Turkish distributor, 
Inter Valf, for an initial consideration of 
£2.8 million. We are pleased with the 
performance of these businesses since 
acquisition and with their small positive 
contributions to our earnings per share 
for the year.
The Board is recommending a 10% 
increase in the final dividend of 25.6p 
per share payable on 21st May 2010 
to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 16th April 2010. 
This, together with the interim dividend 
of 10.5p per share paid in November 
2009, makes a total dividend for the 
year of 36.1p per share. This compares 
with a total dividend of 33.3p per share 
last year, an increase of 8%. The cost 
of the interim and final dividends is 
£27.6 million which is covered 2.3 times 
by earnings. No scrip alternative to the 
cash dividend is being offered. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 3
“ We have made a positive 
start to the year. In the first 
two months of 2010, sales 
in constant currency have 
increased by 2% compared 
with 2009.” 
Mike T ownsend retired as Chairman 
following the AGM in May 2009 and  
we thank him for his contribution  
over his 12 years on the Board as 
a non-executive director. I have 
succeeded Mike as Chairman on  
1st July 2009 following seven years  
as a non-executive director. Upon  
the retirement of Einar Lindh at the  
end of 2008, Dr Krishnamurthy 
Rajagopal was appointed as an 
independent non-executive director on  
10th February 2009. Executive director 
Alan Black retired from the Board on 
30th April 2009. Mike Gibbin joined 
the Board as an executive director on 
1st May 2009, with responsibility for 
our Supply operations and our North 
American steam business companies. 
Clive Watson joined the Board as an 
independent non-executive director on 
17th July 2009 and is Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. We thank our retiring 
Board members and welcome the new 
members to the Board.
Prospects
There is increasing evidence that the 
global economy has started to recover. 
Industrial production rates are now 
positive across most of Asia and are 
improving in Europe and the Americas. 
However, in our view the economic 
upturn remains fragile and we are  
not expecting a rapid rebound in  
our markets.
We have continued to invest in the 
business through the recession to 
improve manufacturing efficiency, 
accelerate new product development 
and increase penetration of our 
markets. In 2010, we will capture the 
full-year benefit of last year’s cost 
reductions, but will reinvest some of 
these savings to increase investment  
in the business to enhance future 
growth and margin prospects.
We have made a positive start to 
the year. In the first two months of 
2010, sales in constant currency have 
increased by 2% compared with 
2009. We remain vigilant and given no 
renewed weakness in our markets or 
significant negative currency impact, 
we expect to make further progress  
in 2010.

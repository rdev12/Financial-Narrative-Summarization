Our business drivers
Our markets have long-term growth potential as customers look 
to focus on their core businesses and outsource non-core and 
back-office functions. Technological developments, such as cloud 
computing and high-speed wireless access, will facilitate this trend.

How we deliver
Our customers are predominantly large companies, with around 
95% of our revenue coming from the private sector. We offer them 
two primary ways to contract with us for processing services:
• 	 	 o u t s o u r c i n g , 	 w h e r e 	 w e 	 o f f e r 	 fi x e d - p r i c e , 	 c o s t - p e r - t r a n s a c t i o n ,	 
cost-plus or gainshare options for a defined scope and quality  
of service
•	 	 Enterprise 	 Partnerships, 	 wher e 	 we 	 form 	 a 	 joint 	 ventur e 	 with 	 our	
customer, who becomes our partner, and use that platform to 
provide them with services, generating savings for them and 
profits for us. We then generate further benefits for both parties 
by adding third party customers to the platform.

What we do
Business processing is at the heart of what we offer. We take on  
our customers’ non-core and back-office functions and perform 
them better, faster and more cheaply, allowing our customers  
to focus on their core business.
We also offer a range of advisory services and software products 
which add value for customers by helping to improve the efficiency 
and effectiveness of their processes.

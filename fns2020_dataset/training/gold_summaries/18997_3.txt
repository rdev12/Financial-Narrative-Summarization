WHO WE ARE
and what we do
We already manage 30,000 
properties which is a town the  
size of Maidenhead in Berkshire!  
We keep our finger on the pulse  
of the local property market  
with offices throughout the UK.
The Group provides lettings, estate 
agency and property management 
services to its clients through its network 
of franchised Martin & Co offices.
Our services are marketed through a high 
visibility website, branded shops in high 
street locations, branded cars, sign boards 
and other property portals.
We won ‘Gold’ for ‘Best Large Letting 
Chain’ at the ESTAS (Estate & Letting 
Agency Awards) in both 2009 and 2012 
as well as ‘Silver’ in the 2013 Sunday 
Times ‘Lettings Agency of the Year’.

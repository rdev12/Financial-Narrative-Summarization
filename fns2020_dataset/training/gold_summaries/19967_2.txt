Whitbread
Whitbread has built some of the  
UKâ€™s most successful hospitality 
brands, including Premier Inn  
and Costa. We employ over  
45,000 people in the UK and  
serve 25 million customers every 
month. Our strategy is to grow   
our leading brands with a clear  
focus on returns to deliver  
substantial shareholder value.
Hotels & Restaurants
Premier Inn is the UKâ€™s leading hotel 
business, with almost 700 hotels  
and more than 59,000 rooms across 
the UK. 
We have more rooms in more locations than our competitors, 
which allows our customers to stay closer to where they  
want to be.
We offer our customers a 100% moneyâ€“back guarantee  
of a good nightâ€™s sleep with a quality room, comfortable 
surroundings and friendly service. We call it our Good  
Night Guarantee.
All Premier Inn UK bedrooms have an ensuite bathroom,  
TV with Freeview and free Wiâ€“Fi internet access. All our  
hotels have a bar and restaurant, either inside the building  
or next to it, offering a wide range of dishes. Whitbreadâ€™s 
unique joint site model means that 382 of these hotels are 
located alongside our own restaurant brands: Beefeater; 
Brewers Fayre; Table Table; Whitbread Inns; or Taybarns.  
A further 190 hotels include one of our Thyme or Kitchen 
restaurants.
Internationally, we have five hotels in the Middle East and  
three in India with more in the pipeline. This year we  
announced that we will open our first hotel in Germany in 2016.
We have demonstrated our ability to build strong brands 
through the consistent delivery of operational excellence and 
a great customer experience in peopleâ€“intensive businesses.
We set our sights on ambitious and fastâ€“paced profitable 
growth and, in 2011, set out our first milestones which were  
to achieve 65,000 Premier Inn rooms by 2016 and Â£1.3 billion 
of system sales in Costa. We are well on track to achieving the 
2016 Premier Inn milestone and have already met the Costa 
milestone. We extended these milestones in 2013 and we  
can now see further growth opportunities. We have therefore 
announced new milestones to achieve around 85,000 UK 
rooms and c.Â£2.5 billion of system sales in Costa in 2020.
Listed on the London Stock Exchange, Whitbread PLC 
is a member of the FTSE 100 and the FTSE4Good indices.

Costa
Costa is the UKâ€™s favourite coffee  
shop
1
, with over 1,900 coffee  
shops in the UK, over 1,100 stores  
in 29 international markets  
and over 4,200 Costa Express  
selfâ€“serve units.
We have a multichannel strategy, with equity stores, franchise 
stores and stores operated by joint ventures, as well as a 
wholesale operation.
Costa was founded in London by Italian brothers Sergio and 
Bruno Costa in 1971 and we attribute much of our success  
to the quality of our coffee and our ability to open coffee  
shops in the most convenient locations. All the coffee we  
serve in the UK, and most of that served by Costa in the rest  
of the world, is roasted at our Roastery in Lambeth, London.
Costa Express was founded in 2011, after the acquisition of 
Coffee Nation. Our selfâ€“serve units provide customers with  
the same famous Mocha Italia blend as that enjoyed in our 
coffee shops and make drinks with fresh milk. Costa Express 
gives us access to a range of locations where customers are  
on the move and want a quality coffee on the go.

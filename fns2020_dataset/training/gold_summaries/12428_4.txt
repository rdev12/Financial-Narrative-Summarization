WORKING TOGETHER
Poundland and Macmillan Cancer Care 
have been working together since 
2009.  Our customers and colleagues 
have worked hard to raise money by 
giving donations, running marathons, 
climbing mountains and various other 
fundraising events.
Together we’ve raised over £1,000,000
The money raised will fund vital Macmillan support services, to 
help ensure that no one faces cancer alone. For example, £158,159 
could pay for a Macmillan nurse for three years, helping people 
living with cancer and their families receive essential medical, 
practical and emotional support.  Thank you to everyone involved.

RESPONSIBILITIES

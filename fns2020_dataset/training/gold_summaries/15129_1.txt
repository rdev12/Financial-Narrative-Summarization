 SurfControl plc Chief Executive’s strategic review 02.
This, together with the desire to
produce the best technology available
on the market at that time, gave us the
ability to capture mindshare and market
share, to become leaders in our field
and create a growing, cash generative,
profitable business
By 2000, the adoption of the Internet as
the main business communication tool
highlighted that the need to ‘Stop
Unwanted Content’ was about to go
beyond the boundaries of Web Filtering.
This gained further momentum as the
issues of content became universal
across Internet delivery mechanisms
such as E-mail and then Instant
messaging. Furthermore, the content
challenges subtly widened to include
pornography, sport, entertainment,
gambling and eventually the scourge
of SPAM. This led to the evolution and
strengthening of our software family to
include the SurfControl e-mail filter in
2001 followed closely by our Instant
Message Filter.
But it wasn’t just technology that was
driving change; increased use of 
the Internet beyond the US was also 
a key point of flux, and accordingly 
we expanded our reach into other
geographical regions giving us the
global presence that we have today.
Since conception we have experienced
a full range of emotions: excitement,
frustration, fear, and pride as we have
achieved all the objectives that we set
ourselves. At the beginning many long
term goals were ‘set in stone’ to drive
our vision and actions. The most
important ones were building a
business which had sustainable
growth, was both profitable and cash
generative, and in particular generated
$100m of annual sales. 
With our increasing geographical
reach and continued technological
advancement to further increase
revenues, cash generation and profits,
it is with great pride that we can
announce that we have achieved all of
our original goals, mostly ahead of the
original plan produced back in 1997/8.
With invoicing for the year ending
30 June 2004 reaching over $106m,
turnover of $87.3m, cash of $87.5m
and pre-tax profits of $14.4m, over
520 people and 13 offices around
the world together with ‘best of breed’
products, our 2003/4 year has been
another record year.
Building on
our success.
In 1998, when we launched our first web filtering
software we recognised that the market was due to
change from ‘protecting children from Pornography’ 
into ‘Protecting businesses from Unwanted Content’ 
that would affect Productivity, Resources, Legal Liability
and Security. This ‘change’ in mindset from Porn
Blockers to Rich Content Web Filters was the driving
force in our adoption by corporations across the globe.

So after taking a few moments to reflect
and enjoy SurfControl’s significant
achievements we must now focus all
our attention on the future.
We have succeeded. We aim to
continue: winning tomorrow and
beyond is the focus.
In the last 12 months SurfControl has
looked further into the future and defined
the direction, objectives and technology
that we need to evolve. This work
culminated in the announcement in May
2004 of our T echnology Roadmap.
Our future continues with an aggressive
focus on our core strength of Content
Filtering. However the dynamics of our
market are changing at an accelerated
pace, presenting both a significantly
bigger opportunity and increased
challenges.
Our Roadmap has three key components
– technology, geography and market.
To fully appreciate our direction we
need to examine the dynamics of
change in our market.
Winning tomorrow and
beyond is the focus.

At SurfControl we are developing technologies that will enable us to offer a completely integrated
content filtering solution. Annual report + accounts 2004 05.
Charles Darwin stated that “It’s not the strongest of
the species that survives, nor the most intelligent.
It is the one that is the most adaptable to CHANGE. ”,
and SurfControl’s ability to adapt to change during
its early growth is one of the keys to its success.
This ability to adapt to change is also one of the key
strengths as we move towards our next exciting
level of growth and expansion.
we project. we deliver. SurfControl plc Chief Executive’s strategic review continued 06.
The use of e-mail and the web at work
has been the most important business
development in recent times. It has
brought with it fundamental risks and
challenges to the business community
such as legal liability, risks to productivity,
network capacity pressures, and
increased security threats. There was an
opportunity, the market demanded a
solution and we provided it. We provided
software that gave our customers the
power to choose the type of content
they received and the type of content
they sent. We provided it on a multitude
of platforms to fit within differing
technological environments. We enabled
companies to stop unwanted content. 
This market, which also includes anti-
virus solutions, has become known as
the Secure Content Market. In 2003,
it generated combined sales of $3.2
billion. In 2008, it is predicted to
generate $7 .2 billion (IDC) growing at a
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
of 17%. The Secure Content Market
contains three major segments: web
filtering, message security and anti-virus.
It has driven our success to date and
the opportunity is continuing to expand.
However, within this expansion in 
opportunity and market size the
challenges and competition are also
expanding. In particular they are
evolving in terms of technology 
delivery and geography.
At a technology level our focus to date
has been on high quality software
delivery, but as the market has evolved
so have the ways in which filtering is
delivered. Filtering software is run on a
company’s server within the corporate
network. However, in recent times we
have seen an emerging market trend
towards putting in place two other
filtering solutions, firstly, a hardware
solution with the installation of a task
specific filtering appliance, and secondly
a managed service solution, with
content filtering being provided as 
a service by a third party.
The Market Dynamics
– a great opportunity.
In 1996, when the decision was taken to target this
market, it hardly existed – but we knew then it would
be big. Eight years on, the true implications of internet
access in the work place are only just being realised.
> vision
> leadership
> innovation

Lyndon B Johnson stated ‘Tomorrow is ours to win or lose’ .
We succeeded by never resting on our laurels. We have
succeeded by doing things better tomorrow that we did
well today. We have succeeded by both driving and
reacting to a dynamic and evolving market. We have
succeeded because every step we have taken has put us
in a position to take the next steps.

The Secure Content Market is set to show
consistent growth for years to come 
(Source: IDC, 2004) Annual report + accounts 2004 07.
The market opportunity for the Secure
Content Appliance is expected to exhibit
70% CAGR between now and 2007
and will be worth $1.6bn.
Beyond Appliances there is also the
emerging opportunity from Managed
Services which is set to show significant
growth in the future.
we listen. we respond.
This is particularly the case with regard
to the control of e-mail. Today, software
remains the most favoured e-mail
filtering tool accounting for 44% of
the market. However the appliance
approach now represents 28% as
does the managed service solution. 
The following factors have encouraged the
growth of demand for the security appliance:
> Reduced complexity. The all-in-one
approach simplifies product selection,
product integration and ongoing support.
> An alternative to software installation
with incremental servers. Customers or,
more often, value-added resellers (VARs),
value-added dealers (VADs), or managed
service providers (MSPs) can easily install
and maintain the products. Increasingly,
this process is handled remotely.
> Install and forget. The appliances are
generally “plug and play,” with very little
installation required. 
> Synergy with high-end software
solutions. Appliances are used in remote
sites at which an enterprise does not have
security professionals on the ground. A
plug-and-play appliance can be installed
and then managed remotely. This
management is synergistic with large,
centralized, software-based firewalls and
content security solutions. 
> Less end user interaction. The black box
approach limits the “damage” users can
do. This reduces support calls and
improves security
> Troubleshooting ease. When a box fails, it
is easier to swap it out than to troubleshoot.
The process gets the node back online more
quickly, and it can be done by a non-
technical person. This feature is especially
important for remote offices without
dedicated technical staff on site.

Today, content filtering is based on three
delivery mechanisms (Source: Ferris 2004)
Of the three content filtering delivery
mechanisms, the appliance market is 
set to grow at the fastest rate 
(Source: IDC, 2003) SurfControl plc Chief Executive’s strategic review continued 08.
Software
Currently we provide web and e-mail
software and we will continue to offer
this solution to new customers and our
global customer base alike. During the
year, we announced several upgrades
and enhancements to our software
solution, and added functionality and
performance. These included the launch
of SurfControl Web filter for Cisco CE
and Blue Coat platforms and upgrades
to our Web Filtering software for
Microsoft Windows, Proxy server and
ISA server, Check Point Firewall 1, Linux
and Nokia IPSO offerings. For many
organisations, software remains the
solution of choice and our software is
consistently viewed by the market as
being the best of breed in its class.
Appliance
This year will mark the launch of the
SurfControl filtering appliance and is
the result of a year of planning and
assessment of the market. SurfControl
examined several ways in which to
address the market and concluded that
the acquisition of an existing appliance
vendor would be the best way forward.
Accordingly, on 19 April 2004, we
announced the acquisition of the
principle assets of SecureM, a provider
of e-mail appliance technology. By
combining our core filtering expertise
with SecureM’s specific Linux based
appliance technology we will launch an
e-mail filtering appliance in the second
half of calendar year 2004 that is
superior to existing competitive offerings. 
This is a major new advance in the
development of SurfControl. But of
course, this is just the beginning and
as part of our technology roadmap
we will build our web filtering into
new generations of SurfControl
fully integrated appliances, offering
both web and e-mail filtering.
Managed Services
In conjunction with the development
of our appliance offering, we are
designing a managed service offering
enabling the remote filtering of e-mail
and web content. This is a natural step
for SurfControl. In fact, we have already
built up a working knowledge of this
area with the provision of our Content
Portal Authority solution for OEMs. This
technology enables ISPs to provide a
centrally managed content filtering
service based on our own core
technology. The managed services
approach completely removes the
delivery of content filtering from within
the corporate network and is becoming
increasingly popular. By providing a
managed service, we will provide
customers with a third option for
content filtering.
Technology – our
three year roadmap 
to success.
Going forward we are going to build upon our software
heritage and our core focus of Rich Content Filtering
and extend our offerings into Appliances and Managed
Services to provide customers with the ability to manage
content using one or a combination of methods that
best suit their needs.

Integrated Offering
Having developed the various delivery
mechanisms for enabling organisations
to filter content, we will be positioned to
offer a complete integrated offering. No
matter which mechanism our customer
wishes to employ we will provide them
with the solution based on our trusted
core filtering technology.
“SurfControl has always focused on providing its
customers with the “total filtering solution. ” As we
embark on our next stage of development, we
will provide the market with the ultimate choice
– multiple delivery on multiple platforms
according to the customer’s needs. ”
we understand. we go beyond. SurfControl plc Chief Executive’s strategic review continued 10.
This means that, in order to access
the larger market opportunity and to
provide a balanced risk for future
growth, it is important to invest in global
infrastructure and expansion. With that
in mind we will be increasingly investing
in further geographical regions, and in
particular mainland Europe and China.
The world is changing, our market is
changing and we are changing to meet
the challenge and the opportunity. 
Our current success, together with
the investment in technological and
geographical expansion, will continue
to drive our long-term growth and
profitability.

Geography –
beyond the USA.
Historically, the USA has been the single dominant
market for Filtering, however the importance of
the rest of the world is starting to emerge with the
market opportunity being as much as 57% outside
the US by 2008.

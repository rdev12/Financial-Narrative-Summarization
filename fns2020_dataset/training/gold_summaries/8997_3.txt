KBC ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
SUMMARY OF STATEMENT 
Turnaround achieved with return to profitability
Strong growth in revenue and workload backlog
Board recommending first and final dividend
SUMMARY 
I am pleased to report that, as we anticipated, 
2006 proved to be a year of continued progress 
for KBC and saw a return to profitability. 
Growth in proﬁts, turnover and workload 
backlog conﬁrmed the signiﬁcant turnaround 
in the business that started in the last quarter 
of 2005. This turnaround demonstrates a 
material and sustained improvement in business 
performance and reﬂects the alignment of 
our services and products with changing 
market requirements.
Revenue has grown by more than 24% year on 
year and signiﬁcant losses in previous years have 
been turned into the ﬁrst reported full year proﬁt 
for KBC since 2001. Sales awards also continued 
to grow in 2006 (exceeding 2005 by more than 
10%) and we ended the year with a conﬁrmed 
backlog of work of £27m compared to £18m 
a year earlier. This backlog includes an increase 
of around £2m on a like for like basis (growth 
of approximately 10%) as well as £7m from 
the acquisition of TTS Performance Systems Inc 
(“TTS”) and Veritech Inc (“Veritech”).
The economic environment for our reﬁning clients 
was the strongest for many years and we expect 
it to remain favourable for several years to come. 
This environment still provides our clients with 
many new challenges and we believe that KBC 
is in an unrivalled position to help them address 
these challenges and therefore beneﬁt from the

“ THE MARKETS IN WHICH KBC OPERATES REMAIN 
STRONG AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR MAJOR CONTRACT 
AWARDS CONTINUE TO BE POSITIVE. THIS MARKET 
ENVIRONMENT , COUPLED WITH THE TURNAROUND IN 
PERFORMANCE, PROVIDES THE BOARD WITH INCREASING

higher level of activity that we anticipate in 2007 
and beyond. We started 2007 with a healthy 
order book and, as we near the end of the ﬁrst 
quarter, progress is being maintained and we 
remain conﬁdent that this will continue.
RESULTS
Revenue for the year was up on 2005 by 24%, 
from £28.5m to £35.4m. The operating proﬁt 
of £1.9m in 2006 compares with a loss of £2.0m 
in 2005. This strong performance has been 
delivered despite a sharp reduction in the sterling 
value of US dollar revenues as a result of the 
£/$ exchange rate moving by 14% during the 
year. On a constant exchange rate basis, revenue 
would have been £35.9m and operating proﬁt 
£2.0m. These results include revenue of £2.1m 
and operating proﬁt of £0.2m from the acquisition 
of TTS in February 2006, and £0.14m of revenue 
and £0.05m of operating proﬁt from the acquisition 
of Veritech in November 2006. After net ﬁnance 
costs the Group realised a proﬁt before tax of £1.7m 
(2005: loss before tax of £2.0m). Basic earnings 
per share were 2.1p (2005: loss of 4.2p). 
DIVIDEND
In the light of the ﬁnancial performance of the Group 
in the last year the Board is pleased to recommend 
a ﬁrst and ﬁnal dividend for 2006 of 0.5p per share. 
The dividend will be payable on 22 May 2007 to 
shareholders on the register at close of business on 
11 May 2007. No dividend was paid in respect 
of 2005.
ACQUISITION OF TTS AND VERITECH
The acquisitions of TTS and Veritech are fully in line 
with our strategy to increase the breadth and 
depth of KBC’s services and strengthen relationships 
with our clients. With KBC’s high operational 
gearing, the increase in scale of our business 
has had a positive impact on proﬁtability and we 
continue to look for opportunities to accelerate 
this process.
BOARD CHANGES
As previously announced, on 25 May 2006 
Peter Close informed the Board of his intention 
to retire and George Bright was appointed as 
Chief Executive. At the same time Nick Stone 
assumed overall responsibility for Operations 
as well as Finance. I would like to thank Peter 
for his contribution to KBC following his return 
to the Company in 2003, and to wish him well 
for the future.
The Board is pleased to see the progress made 
under the new executive team and is conﬁdent 
in the future development of the Company 
under their management.
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOK
We have seen signiﬁcant revenue growth and 
return to proﬁtability over the last 18 months 
and the level of contract awards continues to 
rise. 2007 has started well and we remain very 
busy. The Board expects this to continue. The 
markets in which KBC operates remain strong 
and opportunities for major contract awards 
continue to be positive. This market environment, 
coupled with the turnaround in performance, 
provides the Board with increasing conﬁdence 
in the outlook for the business.

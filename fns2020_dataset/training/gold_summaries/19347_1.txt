 Operating review continued
Reserves and resources 
in 2015, our reserves remained almost unchanged as  
we were largely able to compensate for the depletion of 
existing mines by new reserve additions. g old reserves 
decreased by 1% to 17.7 Moz, and silver reserves decreased 
by 2% to 207.2 Moz, while copper reserves increased  
by 7% to 85.4 thousand tonnes. g old equivalent reserves 
decreased by 4% to 20.8 Moz, mainly as a result of change 
in the gold/silver price ratio.
The increase in reserves due to revaluation and new 
discoveries (a combined increase of 1.4 Moz gold equivalent) 
almost matched the depletion at existing operations.  
These increases included an upgrade of reserves at Kyzyl  
to 7.3 Moz (following the results of the feasibility study),  
initial reserve estimates at Perevalnoye and Khrustalny  
(Dukat hub), Tarutin (varvara) and underground reserves  
at Burgali and Tsokol (Omolon hub). We have also revalued 
upwards reserves at Birkachan, Dukat and l unnoye due  
to cut-off grade revisions on the back of the r ussian 
r ouble devaluation.
Mineral resources (additional to ore reserves) decreased  
by 12% in 2015 to 12.8 Moz of gold equivalent. Key drivers 
were the change in gold/silver price ratio and conversion  
of resources into reserves, including Kyzyl, Perevalnoye,  
and Tarutin. a more conservative approach has also been 
taken for the Oroch, Svetloye and g oltsovoye resources.  
Key brownfield resource additions during the year include 
initial resource estimates at the Primorskoye deposit 
(acquired in 2015), Khrustalny zone (Dukat hub) and 
irbychan, Yolochka, n evenrekan (Omolon hub), as well  
as the newly discovered Farida zone at albazino.
average reserve grade decreased to 4.2 g/t gold equivalent, 
mainly due to the change in the gold/silver price ratio, but 
continues to be one of the highest in our sector. average 
resource grade increased by 15% to 4.8 g/t gold equivalent 
as a result of high-grade resource additions. We continued  
to use conservative gold and silver price assumptions, of 
u S$1,100/oz and u S$15/oz respectively, in both reserve  
and resource estimates in 2015 (2014: u S$1,200/oz and 
u S$17/oz).
in 2016, we plan to complete independent audits of the initial 
resource estimates at our Pg M project in Karelia (v iksha) and 
at the newly acquired assets: l ichkvaz in armenia and 
Dolinnoye in Kazakhstan. 
Outlook for 2016 
in 2016 Polymetal will focus on consistent operational 
delivery with a focus on safety at our existing mines,  
as well as moving the Kyzyl development towards  
meeting our first production target date in 2018.
Management will progressively concentrate its efforts on 
Kyzyl where construction is on track to start in Q2 2016,  
and pre-stripping will also commence. We take confidence  
in our development approach, with low capital intensity and 
conventional processing technology, which ensures a lower 
degree of operational risk during the construction and ramp-
up period.
We will also focus on our new projects, including exploration 
drilling at the n ezhdaninskoye (a new joint venture with 
Polyus g old) and the operational turnaround at the newly 
acquired Kapan mine in armenia.
The Company is on track to produce 1.23 Moz of gold 
equivalent for 2016 and 1.30 Moz of gold equivalent for  
2017
1
. First gold will be produced from the Svetloye heap 
leaching operation and ensure sustained production levels  
at the Okhotsk hub. We anticipate a continued strong 
performance at Dukat, albazino, voro and Omolon, and an 
improvement at Mayskoye and varvara after the temporary 
production declines in the second half of 2015.
importantly, in 2016, we will continue to be focused  
on health and safety performance, in particular at our 
underground mines, and our aim is to substantially  
improve our safety record.

Operating review continued
Dukat was a key driver of the g roup’s operating performance 
in 2015, producing a record 27.4 Moz and reducing total cash 
cost by 26% to u S$6.4/ag equivalent oz.
Mining 
The annual amount of ore mined at the Dukat hub, which 
now includes four underground mines, grew 13% year-on-
year to 2.2 Mt while underground development increased 
11% year-on-year to match the increased mill throughput. 
at the Dukat mine, a record volume of ore mined was 
achieved – 1,656 Kt (up 13% year-on-year). u nderground 
development grew by 11% as a result of narrow ore bodies 
preparation. u nderground garages were set up. We 
continued with the expansion of the fleet of small-scale 
equipment for mining narrow veins. Supporting machinery 
was supplemented by fuelling equipment and mine transport. 
at g oltsovoye, mining continued at design capacity  
with 201 Kt ore mined at 486 g/t silver. u nderground 
development increased by 10% year-on-year, mainly  
due to the development in ore zone 2 of grade control  
drilling and resource-to-reserve conversion. 
The l unnoye plant demonstrated a very strong set of results: 
ore processed grew by 4% year-on-year to 416 Kt, with 
grades improving significantly by 15% for gold and 10%  
for silver due to input of high-grade ore from arylakh and 
zone 7 underground mines. average recoveries were strong 
at 90.5% for gold and 89.3% for silver. g old production was 
18.1 Koz, up 30% year-on-year, and silver production was 
5.0 Moz, up 15%. The hub’s total silver production was a 
record 27.4 Moz, up 15% year-on-year, due to continued 
strength of grades at the Dukat mine and steady increase  
in mine and plant throughput during the year. g old 
production grew to 51 Koz, up 12% year-on-year. 
Resources and exploration 
Our near-mine exploration efforts were again focused  
on tracing ore bodies adjacent to the main deposits; for 
example, the Khrustalny zone next to Dukat has high-grade 
intercepts that represent a continuation of the Dukat ore 
bodies. at Perevalnoye, we focused on in-fill drilling (10 km)  
to refine the geometry of known-ore bodies and prepare 
them for pilot mining works. We have also commenced 
drilling at the newly acquired Primorskoye deposit where 
5 km of drilling were performed to define ore zones 1 and 3.  
Drilling and resource modelling at Primorskoye are set to  
continue in 2016. 
at the l unnoye mine, amounts of ore mined grew by 5% 
while average grades increased by 11% for gold, due to the 
redistribution of volumes between ore zones 9 and 7 , and 
remained at the 2014 level for silver. Pilot cut-and-fill mining 
was successfully completed in horizontal layers in ore zone 7 . 
Sublevel caving mining was launched in ore zone 9.
at arylakh, total ore mined tripled year-on-year in line with  
the mine plan. average gold and silver grades increased,  
by 51% and 2% respectively.
processing and production 
Processing volumes at the Omsukchan concentrator and 
l unnoye plant continued to increase (up 6% and 4% year-
on-year, respectively) due to debottlenecking through 
continuous improvement programmes. The volume of ore 
processed at Omsukchan rose to a new record of 1,817 Kt, 
with average grades increasing by 1% for gold to 0.7 g/t and 
by 11% for silver to 452 g/t. Silver and gold recoveries were 
sustainably high (85.3% and 85.7% respectively) due to an 
ore quality control system based on geological and process 
mapping. g old and silver production increased by 4% and 
14%, respectively, to 32.9 Koz of gold and 22.3 Moz of silver. 
priorities for 2016
in 2016, in order to reinforce safety monitoring, we plan to 
introduce position control systems for underground mining 
workers and equipment throughout all mines. at Dukat 
underground mine, any further increase in throughput  
will be limited due to increased mining from narrow veins.  
We will complete the integration of fuelling and mining 
transportation equipment into the automated business 
process. at g oltsovoye, after completion of in-fill drilling,  
we will commence underground development at ore  
zone 2. at the l unnoye mine, we will fully transition  
to sublevel caving method in ore zone 9. 
We expect to maintain strong gold and silver recoveries  
and throughput at both the Omsukchan concentrator  
and l unnoye CiP, and maintain the solid production levels 
achieved in 2015.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
During the period, we enjoyed an exploration success 
rate of 88%. With full-cycle capabilities, a track record 
of operational delivery and balance sheet strength, 
we are well positioned to deliver continued growth 
in line with our strategic priorities.
Corporate responsibility is an integral part of Afren’s 
culture, permeating all aspects of the business. We are 
committed to conducting business safely and in an 
ethically, socially and environmentally responsible manner. 
This commitment is not only put into practice on a 
day-to-day basis, but also regularly monitored through 
both our management and governance systems.
Across the Group the Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) 
and Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) for 2012 
showed mixed success with the LTIF slightly above target 
at 0.53 and the TRIR better than target at 1.47. These 
results reﬂect in part the wide range of operations in 
which Afren was involved during the course of 2012 
and in particular the signiﬁcant increase in exploration 
activity in East Africa.

Operational highlights
Funding future growth
Afren’s remarkable growth is underpinned by a disciplined approach to 
ﬁnancial and portfolio management that recognises the importance of 
allocating our cash resources in a prudent and effective manner across our 
areas of operation. Supporting our thriving cash generative base is a robust 
and ﬂexible capital structure, which was strengthened during the period 
following the completion of our second secured Bond issue of US$300 million 
in the ﬁrst quarter of 2012.

World-class exploration and appraisal success 
The Afren team enjoyed an excellent year of E&A success in 2012 with three 
signiﬁcant discoveries announced at the Okoro Field Extension and Ebok 
North Fault Block, offshore Nigeria, and at the Ain Sifni PSC, Kurdistan region 
of Iraq, representing an E&A success ratio of 88%. The discoveries in Nigeria 
have given the Group a 2P reserves replacement ratio of 265%.
In East Africa, the recent completion of the seismic data acquisition programme 
and ongoing portfolio maturation has resulted in a mean prospective 
resource upgrade in the period to 5,838 million barrels of oil equivalent 
(from 2,1 13 million barrels of oil equivalent at 31 December 201 1), net to Afren, 
as we mature the assets technically and move forward into an active phase 
of exploration drilling in 2013, targeting both established and new basins. 
Solid platform of producing assets 
In 2012 we delivered record production driven by a full year of production 
from the Ebok ﬁeld and continued outperformance at the Okoro ﬁeld, both 
offshore Nigeria. We successfully fast tracked production at the Okoro ﬁeld 
Extension, within ten months from discovery, and initiated production 
operations at the Barda Rash PSC, Kurdistan region of Iraq.
With a net 2P & 2C recoverable reserves and resources base of over 
one billion barrels, of which only 5% has so far been developed, Afren has in 
place a solid platform for revenue growth and future cash ﬂow generation. Business review

Through strategic foresight Afren has assembled a balanced and focused portfolio of 
world-class assets consisting of high-impact exploration and appraisal opportunities, 
major development projects and key producing assets. These are organised into 
three core business units: Nigeria and other West Africa, Afren East Africa Exploration 
and the Kurdistan region of Iraq. We hold market leadership positions across each 
of our business units and are well positioned to deliver further growth capitalising on 
our early mover advantage and operational track record.
Nigeria and other West Africa
A dominant and growing position
From the outset one of Afren’s key priorities 
was to establish a reliable platform of 
cash-generative reserves and production 
that would enable us to build and grow the 
business on a sustainable basis. Our initial 
entry into the region allowed us to fulﬁl this 
objective and develop the necessary track 
record and credentials to expand across 
and beyond Africa. 
Nigeria and other West Africa remains a 
proliﬁc oil and gas region. In Nigeria alone, 
which represents a signiﬁcant portion of 
our West African portfolio, remaining 
reserves are assessed at 37 billion bbls of oil 
and 182 tcf of gas, ranking it tenth for oil 
reserves and ninth for oil production and 
gas reserves globally. Despite an abundance 
of opportunities, less than 35% of the 
discovered ﬁelds in Nigeria (of which there 
are in excess of 1,000) have been developed. 
It is estimated that of this opportunity set, 
well in excess of 100 such ﬁelds exist, each 
with estimated recoverable reserves of 
between 50 to 250 million bbls. The majority 
of such assets have been licensed to 
indigenous operators or are peripheral within 
the Major IOCs’ portfolios that struggle to 
compete for the necessary technical, capital 
and human resources required to bring the 
assets into production. 
Against this backdrop, Afren has positioned 
itself strategically as a partner of choice to 
assist in the effective development and 
monetisation of these assets by providing 
access to capital and the necessary technical 
and operational capability.
To date, we have successfully delivered two 
high-quality Nigerian development projects 
in Ebok and Okoro in record time, and have 
built a portfolio of six further development, 
appraisal and exploration projects. Our 
acquisition and partnership-led growth is 
evidence that, as pressure mounts on the 
incumbent asset holders to optimise 
development of Nigeria’s national hydrocarbon 
resources and develop local capacity, a 
secondary asset acquisition and divestiture 
market is opening up in the country. We are 
very well positioned within this market and 
the future for us in Nigeria is bright.
Beyond Nigeria, our other West African 
portfolio includes production assets in Côte 
d’Ivoire and attractive exploration acreage in 
Ghana, Congo Brazzaville and South Africa.

Continued
High-impact forward exploration 
programme 
Relative to other African regions, East Africa 
has been explored to a far lesser degree than 
the proliﬁc oil and gas producing regions of 
West and North Africa, where a signiﬁcantly 
greater number of wells have been drilled.
Mesozoic rifting phases associated with 
the break-up of the mega-continent, 
Gondwanaland, have created several proliﬁc 
hydrocarbon Basins. The Anza, Lamu and 
Mandera Basins in Kenya, the Ogaden Basin 
in Ethiopia, Ambilobe Basin in Madagascar 
and the Seychelles Basin share many similar 
characteristics, including source rocks, 
reservoirs, seals and structure with other 
Mesozoic rift basins that are today producing 
signiﬁcant volumes of oil and gas. 
Oil seeps are common and several wells 
drilled to date have encountered oil or oil 
shows, indicating that the regional source 
rocks are also liquid-prone. Major oil 
accumulations have also been discovered 
in Uganda, Sudan and Madagascar in 
particular, with Yemen and the Bombay/
Cambay Highs in India also proliﬁc oil 
producing areas that share a common 
geological origin with East Africa.
The next phase of exploration in East Africa, 
based on modern data, is already leading to 
a signiﬁcant increase in activity and discovery 
rates in the region.
Having achieved our early strategic priority 
of establishing a reliable platform of 
cash-generative reserves and production 
from our Nigeria and other West African 
base, the Afren Board deemed 2010 an 
opportune time to take an East African 
position by completing the all-share 
acquisition of Black Marlin Energy Holdings 
Ltd (Black Marlin).
Afren East Africa Exploration
Black Marlin, an independent exploration 
and appraisal company, was an attractive 
target for Afren with a high-impact portfolio 
of exploration and appraisal assets across 
Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar and the 
Seychelles. The acquisition provided Afren 
with an early entry position of critical mass 
in East Africa consistent with Afren’s 
mandate to establish a pan-African presence. 
The acquisition immediately expanded our 
exploration inventory by adding several 
exploration targets across multiple geological 
basins, play types and geographies that have 
allowed the Group to leverage its proﬁtable 
cash-generative production base in Nigeria 
and other West Africa. We augmented our 
position further in East Africa in 2010 with 
the acquisition of the Tanga Block offshore 
north-east Tanzania which lies south of, and 
is contiguous with, Afren’s 100% owned 
and operated Block L17 & L18 in Kenya.
Afren’s East African exploration portfolio 
today covers an extensive surface area of 
100,221 km
2
 on a gross basis, focused on 
Cretaceous, Jurassic and Tertiary rift basins 
which are geological settings that have 
yielded signiﬁcant discoveries in Uganda, 
Sudan, Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique 
and, most recently, Kenya.
Since the acquisition, Afren has signiﬁcantly 
increased the seismic coverage with a total 
of 9,444 km 2D and 5,607 km
2
 3D acquired 
across the portfolio.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012
In recognition of the opportunity at hand, 
in 201 1, Afren undertook its most ambitious 
acquisitions to date by acquiring the Barda 
Rash (60% operated) and Ain Sifni (20% 
non-operated) PSCs located in the Kurdistan 
region of Iraq, from Komet Group and the 
Kurdistan Regional Government respectively.
Afren is now the most active international 
independent E&P Group in Nigeria, and also 
in East Africa where we have assembled a 
highly attractive acreage position in some of 
the region’s most sought-after play fairways. 
Thematically, the Kurdistan region of Iraq 
shares similarities with the Nigerian and other 
West African opportunity set. Although oil 
has been discovered in abundance and plays 
proven, the region until very recently has 
nevertheless been overlooked by, or remained 
out of reach for, much larger international 
companies. This has created a window of 
opportunity for smaller, agile independents 
to secure assets with world-class potential. 
The acquisition is consistent with our 
strategic priorities and at the time delivered 
independently certiﬁed net 2P & 2C 
resources at US$0.68 per 2P & 2C bbl – 
well below other regional transaction values. 
As the region develops politically, we are 
one of the best-placed resource companies 
to beneﬁt from signiﬁcant reserves growth, 
de-risking of the geopolitical landscape 
and a consequent realisation of sustained 
oil export revenues.

a proliﬁc hydrocarbon province

An early entrant – signiﬁcant 
reserves growth
Kurdistan is a semi-autonomous region in 
the north-west of Iraq comprising an area 
of approximately 40,600 km
2
. Kurdistan is 
one of the last onshore exploration regions 
that promise to deliver proliﬁc hydrocarbon 
resources in an attractive ﬁscal environment. 
Data from OPEC currently puts Iraq’s oil 
reserves at c.143 billion boe, of which 
c.45 billion boe (c.30%) is believed to be 
in Kurdistan. The oil industry has enjoyed 
signiﬁcant success with cumulative gross 
discoveries of more than ﬁve billion bbls 
representing a success rate in excess of 70%, 
with production growing from 2,000 bbls/d 
in 2006 to some 250,000 bbls/d currently. 
The region is developing rapidly with over 
40 oil companies awarded PSCs, including 
four of the top ten oil majors, which followed 
Afren’s entry into the region.
We are an entrepreneurial company and take 
a long-term view of growing our business. 
We play to our strengths by leveraging our 
relationships and expertise to access new 
basins in areas where we can gain a 
strategically and competitively advantageous 
position – always willing to move ahead of 
the competition for the right opportunities.

LONDON’S FIRST FULLY ELECTRIC 
BUS ROUTE
Arriva London placed an order in March 2015 
for seven fully electric, zero emission Optare 
MetroCity single deck buses which will operate on 
route 312. This will be the first route in London to 
be operated entirely with fully electric buses. These 
vehicles will join two Optare MetroCity vehicles 
currently in service on route 312, which runs 
between South Croydon and Norwood Junction. 
The new vehicles are expected to commence 
service later this year.
This order marks the first order of electric vehicles 
to be solely funded by a London operator.
MAYOR OFFICIALLY WELCOMES THE 
FIRST BRITISH BUILT , PURE ELECTRIC 
BUSES TO ENTER SERVICE ON 
LONDON’S ROADS
In July 2015 the Mayor of London officially 
welcomed the introduction of four British built, 
pure electric Optare buses at an air quality event 
at the Mansion House.
The four Optare MetroCity single deck buses were 
part funded by the Department for Transport’s 
(“DfT”) Green Bus Fund and currently operate 
on route H98, between Hayes and Hounslow.
The introduction of the four pure electric Optare 
MetroCity buses is the first step of the Mayor’s plan 
for all single deck buses in central London to be 
zero emission at tailpipe, as part of the world’s first 
Ultra Low Emission Zone, from 2020.

DDA COMPLIANT SOLO PROVING 
A PERFECT FIT FOR COACHSTYLE
From 1 January 2015 all buses operating on registered 
routes open to the public up to 7.5t were required 
to be DDA compliant.
Established coach operator Coachstyle has been 
running seven 7.9 metre long, 2.33 metre wide 
Optare Solos since April 2014. 
With a low entry floor and a front axle located 
forward of the door, the Solo allows for easy access 
to a fully flat lower saloon area, making these buses 
easily accessible for all and fully compliant with the 
DDA regulations. Not only does the Solo have 
excellent capacity the slim design means it is also 
ideal for navigating narrow service routes.
These vehicles are a more fuel efficient, cost 
effective and environmentally friendly option for 
operators needing to replace older vehicles which 
are no longer DDA compliant.

IntrOduC tIOn
The year to 31 December 2009 was challenging 
for Tikit as clients adjusted their spending plans 
in the uncertain economic climate. The Group’s 
performance in the first half was, as reported 
in the trading update early in July, below the 
Board’s expectations set at the beginning of the 
year. Disappointing software sales in the second 
quarter, along with the prospect of continuing 
weakness in that area of the Group’s markets, 
caused the Board in July 2009 to revise its 
expectations for the financial year as a whole 
and I am pleased to be able to report that profits 
are slightly ahead of those revised targets. 
During the year the Board has implemented 
a business restructuring and cost reduction 
programme, the benefits of which will impact 
the current year and beyond.
Against this background, I am pleased to report 
that the Group generated operating profits during 
the second half of the year of £1.8m and that 
operating profits for the full year were £3.0m. 
The actions taken to restructure the business 
in light of the difficult trading conditions have 
resulted in annual cost savings of £1.0m and 
the benefit of this is shown in the significant 
improvement in margins which were 15.1% 
in the second half of the year compared with 
9.1% in the first half. Additionally, cash generated 
from operating activities was £3.5m and the 
Group’s net cash resources at the year end 
amounted to £1.6m, a significant increase 
on the £0.3m reported at the end of 2008.
Good progress has been made in many areas 
of the business, with continued solid growth 
in our recurring support and outsourcing 
revenues. In addition, positive customer response 
to Tikit-developed software, particularly the 
enhanced version of Tikit eMarketing and the 
Tikit House Style Manager for Microsoft Word, 
as well as the sales of TfB-developed practice 
management software, resulted in solid sales 
of Tikit-owned software. However, sales 
of third party software and the associated 
implementation work were weaker as clients 
held back on capital project commitments. 
The Group continues to develop its own 
enhancement software modules, but sales 
were constrained by the general weakness 
in demand for the Group’s third-party software. 
Nevertheless, these proprietary enhancement 
modules differentiate Tikit from the competition 
and we are committed to developing further 
the market for these products.
The Board remains confident of the financial 
strength of and prospects for the Group and 
its potential to generate positive cash flow. 
resuL ts
Total Group revenues for the year fell by 11.5% 
to £25.2m (2008: £28.5m). Revenues were below 
expectations mainly as a result of the deferral 
of capital projects by clients in the current 
economic environment and, to a minor extent, 
due to the implementation of subscription-based 
pricing on some of our products, which should 
however secure more predictable long-term 
revenues for the Group.
Recurring revenues derived from support and 
outsourcing services grew by 10.2% to £13.7m 
(2008: £12.5m) representing 55% of total 
revenues, up from 44% in the previous year. 
Total services revenues of the Group, consisting 
of our consultancy, implementation and managed 
services businesses, fell by 6.2% to £19.2m 
(2008: £20.4m). This was largely attributable 
to the fall in implementation revenues from 
£8.0m in 2008 to £5.4m in 2009.
Software sales in total were down overall 
by 27.9% to £5.0m (2008: £6.9m) and now 
represent less than 20% of total Group revenue. 
Sales of Tikit-developed software fell by 13% to 
£1.4m (2008: £1.6m) and third-party software 
sales declined by 32.1% to £3.6m (2008: £5.3m). 
Sales of third-party software products, such 
as Interaction from LexisNexis and Autonomy 
Worksite, suffered from the caution exercised 
by clients in committing to large capital projects 
in the current economic environment. There 
were, however, strong sales of Tikit’s own 
eMarketing software, especially in the US, and 
the newly-launched Tikit House Style Manager 
which is a subscription priced product. Sales 
of the TfB practice management software were 
down 11.5% year on year , although their second 
half performance of £0.45m was similar to the 
second half of 2008 (£0.47m). 
Full year operating margins fell to 12.0% 
(2008: 14.4%), although there was a significant 
improvement in the second half where margins 
improved to 15.1%, from 9.1% in the first half, as 
a result of a better product mix and the impact 
of some of the restructuring cost reductions. 
Operating profit for the Group, before amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and share-based charges, 
declined by 26.5% to £3.0m (2008: £4.1m). 
Share-based charges during the period were 
£0.12m (2008: £0.25m). Amortisation of acquired 
intangibles in the period were £0.37m (2008: 
£0.28m), which relate to the amortisation of 
the customer-related intangible asset associated 
with the TfB acquisition. Profit before taxation 
decreased by 29.1% to £2.5m (2008: £3.5m).

Earnings per share, before amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and share-based 
charges, fell by 29.2% to 15.3p (2008: 21.6p). 
The effective tax rate on profits was 25.8% 
in 2009 (2008: 26.7%). Basic earnings 
per share were 12.7p (2008: 18.1p). 
Our balance sheet remains strong, with net assets 
at 31 December 2009 of £15.2m (2008: £14.3m), 
including much higher net cash balances of £1.6m 
(2008: £0.3m). During 2009 the cash generated 
from operations was £3.5m (2008: £5.7m). 
There was no cash expenditure on acquisitions 
during the year and there are no outstanding 
acquisition liabilities. In respect of financing of 
the business, £0.05m of net interest was paid 
in the year (2008: £0.10m) which related to the 
annual fee on unused loan facilities and £0.87m 
was paid in respect of dividends (2008: £0.69m). 
No share options were exercised during the 
year. However, £0.11m was used to purchase 
shares into treasury and the Tikit Employee 
Benefit Trust (EBT). 
dIvIdends
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 4.1p per share, subject to shareholder approval 
at the AGM to be held on 21 April 2010. It is to 
be paid on 30 April 2010 to shareholders on the 
register on 9 April 2010. This, when taken with 
the interim dividend of 1.9p (2008: 1.9p), will 
bring the total dividend for the year to 6.0p 
(2008: 6.0p). 
eMpLO yees
2009 was a demanding year for our clients, 
our software partners, our employees and the 
management team. I would like to thank them 
all for their professional contribution and 
commitment in such an environment. It is a 
credit to all that these results were achieved 
and I look forward to working successfully 
with them again this year.
suMMAry And OutLOOK
During the year the Board undertook 
action to restructure the Group’s operations. 
This has resulted in reducing the fixed cost 
base and places the business in an excellent 
position for rapid profit improvement as 
conditions improve. 
Our clients continue to operate in tough and 
uncertain conditions and, as a result, some 
have chosen to defer investment in IT systems. 
We believe that the general uncertainty in the 
economic outlook will continue to hold back 
commitment by our clients to large capital 
projects involving third-party software and to 
some extent the Tikit enhancement products 
associated with those projects. Tikit is, however, 
uniquely positioned to benefit once these tough 
conditions ease and clients’ investment plans 
revert to the prior norm. As in previous years, 
we do not expect our clients to firm up their 
annual plans for expenditure on IT systems 
and support until the second-quarter. 
Tikit entered 2010 with a substantial number 
of project opportunities and trading in the 
early months of 2010 has been encouraging. 
Our focus for 2010 will be to improve margins 
through our emphasis on greater sales of 
Tikit-developed software, and to increase 
recurring revenues, combined with strong 
cost control and cash management. 
Our balance sheet remains strong and the 
Group has a good record of cash generation, 
providing a sound basis for us to continue to 
seek out opportunities to expand our ability to 
deliver a wider range of services to our clients. 
Combined with Tikit’s leading market position 
in the UK, the Board continues to be optimistic 
about the future trading prospects of the Group.

Introduction
I am pleased to report that, in a challenging
trading environment, financial results for the year
ended 31 December 2008 recorded a new high
for the Group.
Financial Results
Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2008
increased by 18% to £179.3 million (2007: £151.9
million). This included a combined contribution of
£5.0 million from the six new sites acquired during
the year. Revenue on a like-for-like basis increased
by 15%. Operating profit rose by 2% to £6.7
million (2007: £6.6 million) and profit before tax
rose by 3% to £7.1 million (2007: £6.8 million).
Earnings per share increased by 3% to 11.6 pence
(2007: 11.3 pence).
These results for the year ended 31 December
2008 are after the deduction of £750,000 in
respect of a bad debt provision made against the
debt of a customer that went into administration
in March 2009.
Net cash increased by £0.2 million, producing net
cash balances as at 31 December 2008 of £5.4
million (2007: £5.2 million). This increase in cash is
after an investment of £1.7 million in the purchase
of the Company’s own shares, deficit pension
contributions of £2.6 million and the payment of
£2.3 million for new site acquisitions.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to recommend a final
dividend of 3.3 pence per share (2007: 3.0 pence
per share), taking the total dividend for the year 
to 5.0 pence (2007: 4.5 pence), an increase of
11%. This will be paid, subject to approval by
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, on
12 June 2009 to shareholders on the register at
the close of business on 15 May 2009.
Trading overview
The business continues to make solid progress and
we have increased our market share. The contract
wins and contract extensions signed in 2007
helped to increase volumes through our repair
network notwithstanding a decrease in accidents
during the year. We have also increased our non-
insurance work. While our customer base is biased
towards multi-year contracts with the leading
insurance companies, we also provide our services
to corporate fleets, brokers, motor manufacturers
and private individuals.
Our national network of bodyshops enables us to
service our customers’ needs in an efficient and
effective manner and we continue to manage the
network carefully, adding new locations where we
have identified customer demand and closing
locations no longer required. During the year we
acquired six new bodyshops and closed one
bodyshop. These new acquisitions further extend
our capacity and service capability and will provide
improved returns once they are fully integrated
into our network.  
A key strength of our bodyshop network is the
flexibility it provides us in the deployment of work
across our branches, which allows us to maximise
cost effectiveness. Our size enables us to derive
economies of scale and it is pleasing to note that,
despite inflationary pressure, gross margin
remained constant at 46.5% for the second
consecutive year. We remain focused on achieving
cost savings and believe there is scope to deliver
further efficiencies within the business.
Our retail initiative progressed well in 2008.
Targeted at customers whose vehicles are already
in a bodyshop for an insurance-related repair,
revenue from this new offering has developed
well. We are now developing further this direct-to-

and via acquisition”

consumer offering, which should also enable us 
to enhance our margins. 
Our Network Services division, which acts as 
a “one-stop shop” for accident management
services, continues to expand. The division gives 
us a competitive edge over many of our peers,
providing a service tailored to individual
customers’ needs, and capturing additional 
work for the Group’s bodyshops.
Outlook
These 2008 results demonstrate the ongoing
success of our twin track growth strategy,
organically and via acquisition, and we believe that
this strategy will continue to deliver future growth.
Although our business is not immune to the
current economic downturn, the nature of our
business, based as it is around accident repairs,
should afford us protection. In addition, we
benefit from good cash generation, a strong
balance sheet and no bank debt. Accordingly, 
the Directors are confident that the business is
well placed for long term growth.

Over the past twelve months, we have once again 
seen strong revenue growth from our professional 
product ranges in Europe. This follows the successful 
completion of the rebranding of Vivid to ‘HaynesPro’, 
which started in September 2012, and has helped us 
to strengthen the Haynes brand throughout mainland 
Europe, whilst also allowing the professional side of 
the business to benefit from the Haynes association 
when developing new leads in geographical territories 
where Haynes has a strong brand presence. Demand 
for our traditional printed Haynes manuals, in both our 
main geographical markets has remained soft during 
the year and we have also experienced a noticeable 
downturn in demand for our domestic general 
publishing titles.
As a Group, for the most part, we were able to 
weather the early impact of the economic downturn 
and, whilst it was unrealistic to expect sustainable 
growth during this period, we were able to maintain 
Group profitability. However, over the last two years 
we have faced a strengthening headwind in our core 
automotive manual markets and more recently a 
significant slowdown in the 
UK general publishing market. 
The Board recognised that 
these pressures were unlikely 
to ease in the foreseeable 
future and so commenced 
a strategic review of the 
business at the end of 
2012. This review was 
completed in September 
this year and Eric Oakley, our Group 
Chief Executive, has set out below further details of 
the key actions we will be undertaking to help return 
the Group to revenue and profit growth.
Results summary
Over the past twelve months the softer trading 
conditions for our core automotive manuals and a 
sharp decline in demand for our domestic general 
book publishing titles has had a negative effect on 
Group profitability and, whilst in mainland Europe 
the strong trading performance from HaynesPro 
has helped to mitigate these downward pressures, 
Group revenue ended the year 7% lower at £27.6 
million (2012: £29.8 million). Despite a tight control of 
overheads, the impact of the lower revenue coupled 
with an increase in HaynesPro development cost 
amortisation of £0.4 million left Group pre-tax profits 
at £3.6 million (2012: £4.7 million), down 23%.
The Group’s effective tax rate was 31.3% (2012: 
31.6%) leaving basic earnings per share at 16.4 
pence (2012: 20.0 pence).
Although we are currently 
experiencing pressure on 
our core revenue streams, 
the Group continues to enjoy 
a healthy balance sheet and 
strong cash generation. With 
an operating profit to cash 
conversion ratio of just over 
180%, the Group’s cash 
balances ended the year up 
27% at £6.1 million (2012: 
£4.8 million).
Group Chairman’s Statement

   We now have a much clearer focus  
on those parts of the business which  
are core operations and which will  
help to drive future revenue and profit 
growth to the Group.

Post balance sheet 
event
On 17 September 2013, 
the Group acquired the 
trade and certain assets 
and liabilities including 
intellectual property, trade 
receivables and finished 
goods inventory marketed 
and sold under the Clymer 
and Intertec brands 
from Penton Media, Inc 
in the USA. The cash 
consideration for the acquisition was £5.85 million 
($9.25 million) funded in part through US internal 
cash and partly through bank debt. The acquisition 
of the Clymer and Intertec brands sits perfectly 
alongside our iconic Haynes manuals as well as 
expanding the Group’s range of repair manuals to 
include marine, snowmobiles and tractors.
Dividend and shares
As reported at the time of our Interim Results for the 
6 months ended 30 November 2012 (announced on 
31 January 2013), the Group has communicated its 
intention to grow the business through acquisitions, 
geographical expansion and organic growth and 
therefore, the Board feels it is appropriate at this time 
of economic uncertainty to conserve cash within 
the business. The Board maintains a target dividend 
cover of 1.5 times. Owing to the short term cash 
requirements associated with restructuring the loss 
making UK business, the Board feels it is sensible to 
exercise prudent cash management.
In light of the above, the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 4.0 pence per share (2012: 
9.5 pence) which, taken together with the interim 
dividend of 3.5 pence (2012: 6.2 pence), gives a total 
dividend for the year of 7.5 pence per share (2012: 
15.7 pence). Subject to the approval by shareholders, 
the final dividend will be paid on 30 October 2013 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business 
on 11 October 2013. The shares will be declared ex-
dividend on 9 October 2013.
Board, corporate governance and people
The Board is responsible for ensuring the Group 
businesses are managed 
in an efficient and effective 
manner. Through the 
forum of regular Board 
meetings, the Board 
sets Group strategy, 
evaluates Group 
performance, monitors 
operating and financial 
risk and considers 
all matters which are 
necessary to provide 
an environment of sound corporate governance. Full 
details of how the Board has complied with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code are contained in this 
year’s Annual Report. There have been no changes to 
the composition of the Group Board during the year.
Whilst the Board sets Group strategy, which 
management implements, the successful delivery 
of the strategy is very dependent on the employees 
who work within the business and we are very 
fortunate to have a hard working and loyal team 
which, particularly in the current climate, is willing to 
adapt to change. I would therefore, like to thank Eric 
Oakley and my fellow Board members, the Group’s 
management teams and all of our Group wide 
employees for all their efforts during the year. I am 
confident that the actions we are taking as a Group 
will help strengthen the business for the future.
Future prospects
Following the 
completion of our 
strategic review, we 
now have a much 
clearer focus on those 
parts of the business 
which are core operations 
and which will help to 
drive future revenue 
and profit growth to 
the Group. Whilst the 
economic landscape 
remains uncertain, 
with little prospect of a 
return to more buoyant 
trading conditions in 
the short-term, I am 
nevertheless genuinely 
optimistic about the 
future prospects for 
the Haynes Group. We 
have a solid financial 
base with a strong 
brand presence 
throughout the 
major English speaking 
territories of the world. These factors, together 
with our in-house automotive and IT expertise and 
a proven ability to create and distribute content in 
multiple languages through our internally developed 
multimedia platforms, mean we are well placed to 
fulfil our growth objectives.

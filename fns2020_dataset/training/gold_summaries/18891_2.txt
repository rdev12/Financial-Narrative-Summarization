1. EBITA is earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of acquisition intangibles. Underlying EBITA is defined 
as operating profit before deduction of exceptional and other items, as outlined in Note 7 and on the face of 
the income statement. Underlying EBITA is the same as ‘Operating profit before exceptional and other items’ 
on the face of the financial statements, but used as terminology in light of being a key performance 
measurement for management in the Group. 
2. As set out in the income statement, other underlying numbers are stated before deduction of exceptional  
and other items, as outlined in Note 7 and on the face of the income statement. Underlying profit after tax  
and underlying earnings per share are net of an imputed tax charge. Underlying revenue represents revenue 
for the underlying Group and excludes contract losses on businesses being exited.

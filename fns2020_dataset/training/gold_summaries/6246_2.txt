HIGHLIGHTS
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
• We successfully raised £4.7 million 
to assist the funding of our transition 
plan from our IPO and pre-IPO activity 
in the year, bringing the total raised to 
£5.8 million before associated costs 
since May 2013. 
• In anticipation of improved returns beginning 
in the subsequent financial year we began 
a transition towards increasing our 
proportion of self-published revenue by 
investing £4.1 million in the development 
and promotion of Elite: Dangerous and 
associated COBRA technology, which 
caused an expected and temporary 
operating loss of £1 .7 million. 
• Cash raised from self-published games 
and pre-orders of Elite: Dangerous 
represented 13% of cash received 
from revenue. Deferred income stood 
at £2.5 million at the year end 
(2013: £1.3 million).
• The proportion of non-publisher work 
recognised increased to 19% from 6%. 
• We diversified our publisher revenue 
by starting two contracts for a new 
global publishing partner in the year, 
each of which were based on original 
IP created by Frontier.

The Company has consistently 
delivered strong operating and 
financial performance. The robustness 
of our business model has been 
proved with its ability to weather 
difficult trading conditions faced by 
the Indian power sector.
 
Our plants have been performing at 
over 90% PLFs, significantly above 
industry average. Our ability to achieve 
such high PLFs can be attributed not 
only to our equipment but also our 
ability to procure a constant supply of 
coal. We also continue to realise above 
average tariff with our flexible sales 
model. The result is clearly visible 
in our year on year growth in profits 
and earnings.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14
Chairmanâ€™s
statement
 This is another set of good results. Once again strong  
cash flow funded the necessary capital investment for  
our growth engines, Premier Inn and Costa, to increase  
their share of the market. We have recommended  
an increase in the fullâ€“year dividend by 19.9% while 
maintaining debt at a prudent level. I am confident  
that the brand strength of Premier Inn and Costa will  
continue to fuel the Companyâ€™s growth into the future.
Whitbread continues to evolve in a fast changing trading and economic environment.  
Premier Inn has, for example, responded to the growing competitive presence of online  
travel agents by significantly increasing its digital capability and resources. It has also 
announced the launch of â€˜hub by Premier Innâ€™ which is a new city centre focused hotel  
concept. Costa is consistently looking to find new ways of ensuring that its customers  
are never far from a cup of Costa Coffee â€” for example through new distribution channels 
such as driveâ€“thru and a new generation of Costa Express machine. Our restaurants have  
also been updating their brand propositions. This focus on innovation is essential for a  
modern company to prosper.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final dividend of 47.00p per share, making a total dividend of 
68.80p per share, up by 19.9%. The final dividend will be paid on 4 July 2014 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 30 May 2014. The Scrip Dividend Scheme,  
which was introduced in 2009, has been closed. It has been replaced by a new Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan, which will not have the effect of diluting shareholdings. Further  
information on how to participate in this new plan can be found on the Companyâ€™s website.

Chairmanâ€™s 
statement
Board
In December 2013, we announced that Susan Hooper would be stepping down from her 
position as a nonâ€“executive director of the Company so that she could focus her attention  
on her new role at British Gas. I would like to thank Susan for her contribution to the Board 
over the last two years and wish her well in her new role.
We also announced changes to the roles and responsibilities of two of our other nonâ€“
executive directors. Sir Ian Cheshire became Senior Independent Director with effect from  
1 January 2014, taking over from Stephen Williams who had fulfilled that role since March 
2008. Stephen took over from Sir Ian as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee with 
effect from the same date.
Nine fascinating years of transformation and focused growth
This is the final Annual Report during my tenure as Chairman of Whitbread. It has been a 
privilege to lead the Board during nine exciting and transformational years for the Company.
When I joined Whitbread in 2005, the Group had a collection of brands including, among 
others, David Lloyd Leisure, T.G.I. Fridayâ€™s and Pizza Hut. Premier Travel Inn, as it was  
called then, had 28,400 UK rooms with no international presence and represented 15%  
of Whitbread sales. Nine years on, Premier Inn has 55,035 rooms in the UK and Ireland,  
with hotels also in India, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Premier Innâ€™s sales have grown at over  
13% per annum and now represent 42% of Whitbread revenues. It is the countryâ€™s leading 
hotel brand. Costa, which had 426 stores in 2005 and represented 6% of Whitbread  
sales, has grown into an international brand with 2,861 stores in 30 countries. Its sales have 
grown at 23% a year and represent 38% of Whitbreadâ€™s revenues. It is now the UKâ€™s leading 
coffee shop brand. Meanwhile we have focused our Restaurants business onto those 
sharing a site with a Premier Inn and we have almost doubled the number of these joint  
sites over the period.
This transformation has been achieved in a period that included the worst recession  
in living memory and has delivered significant value to our shareholders. The share price  
when I joined the Company in 2005 was Â£8.54 and we had delivered underlying basic  
EPS of 61.25p. At the time of writing the share price is Â£40.46 and our EPS for 2013/14  
was 179.02p.
In addition, I am immensely proud of the achievements of our Good Together programme.  
From a standing start five years ago, we are now fully engaged in many major and highly 
relevant areas to the business. These range from, for example, our leading apprenticeship 
programme to the highly successful school building programme in coffeeâ€“growing areas 
through the Costa Foundation. We are making a real difference.
None of this could have been achieved without the dedication and professionalism  
of thousands of members of the Whitbread team. I would like to take this opportunity  
to thank not just the 43,000 people currently working at Whitbread, but also thousands  
more that have contributed to this Companyâ€™s success during my time as Chairman.
Finally, on a personal note, I would like to thank my colleagues on the Board and in 
management for their support and wish Andy and his team every success as they lead  
the next phase of Whitbreadâ€™s development.

Chairman’s statement

€12.4m. Net cash flow from operations 
in 2013 was an outflow of €1.2m, down 
from €6.5m inflow in 2012.
We were informed at the start of 2013 
that Italy’s Environmental Impact 
Assessment (’EIA’) Commission, 
charged by the Ministry of Environment 
and of Protection of Land and Sea 
(‘MEPLS’) to rule on the Ombrina Mare 
oil and gas field development EIA, had 
ruled in favour of the Company’s 
submission. This positive news slowly 
turned to disappointment as the year 
progressed, with the Minister declining 
to sign the resulting EIA Decree that 
was presented to him for signature in 
February 2013. The MOG team, 
together with our advisers, have 
invested very considerable time and 
effort, often behind the scenes, to 
engage with all key stakeholders. 
Despite our many attempts at the 
highest levels to resolve this matter, 
ultimately we have been obliged to 
lodge an appeal with the Italian 
courts. Post this reporting period our 
legal appeal against the actions of the 
Minister was heard at a tribunal 
hearing held on 9 January 2014 at the 
Administrative Court in Rome. The 
Company is presently awaiting the 
decision of the appeal. We remain 
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board of 
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc, I am 
pleased to announce the Company’s 
2013 results.
A significant challenge for the 
Company in 2013 was the sudden loss 
of production from two of our key 
production wells at the Guendalina 
Field, offshore Italy, which resulted in us 
missing our production expectations 
by over 40%. I am pleased to report 
that, following a well clean-up 
operation at the start of 2014, 
production has been restored at GUE 
3SS, and that the updated reservoir 
analysis carried out during this exercise 
indicates the reservoir is in better 
condition and less depleted than we 
thought at the time of our Interim 
Results statement. As such, in these 
results, we are able to reverse €1.2 
million of the €1.8 million impairment  
of the Guendalina Field reported in 
September 2013. We look forward to 
continued safe and reliable operations 
at the Guendalina Field, which 
remains our main source of revenue.
Total annual production was 27.6 
MMscm (175,420 boe) and total 
revenue was €8.4m. Cash and cash 
equivalents at the period end was 
‘We have turned  
the corner after  
a challenging year  
and are well placed  
to advance the value 
of our portfolio in the 
year ahead.’ Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 9

convinced that the development of 
the Ombrina Mare Field will benefit the 
Abruzzo region and we are resolute 
that we will protect our shareholders’ 
interests in what is a very important 
asset within our portfolio.
On a more positive note, we have 
made good progress preparing for our 
upcoming drilling activities offshore 
Malta in Area 4. All of the necessary 
logistics and contracts are in place 
and we are now awaiting arrival of the 
rig and final clearances to start drilling. 
Post this reporting period, we received 
an extension of six months to the first 
exploration period to July 2014, 
enabling sufficient time to complete 
the drilling activities.
In 2012 the Board implemented a 
revised remuneration policy for the 
executives and all staff that more closely 
aligns their total reward based on a 
weighted combination of their individual 
performance, and the overall 
performance of the Company as 
compared with our peers. At the end  
of 2012, the Company was in the top 
quartile in terms of share value growth 
when compared with over 100 E&P 
companies listed on AIM, and this report 
reflects the executive and staff bonuses 
for 2012 performance that were 
awarded in January 2013. As a result of 
the general underperformance of our 
share price during the last twelve 
months, no executive bonuses or 
options were awarded for 2013.
Outlook
There is no doubt that 2014 will be an 
important year in the growth of the 
Company. We are excited to have two 
exploration wells and 1,500km of 2D 
seismic acquisition planned for the 
first half of the year. The drilling of the 
first exploration well, Hagar Qim, 
offshore Malta Area 4, has the 
potential to open up a new 
hydrocarbon basin. The onshore Italy 
Faseto 1 exploration well, while not a 
high-impact well like Hagar Qim, is an 
opportunity for rapid implementation 
as the development options have 
already been pre-approved.
During 2013 significant time, effort and 
resources have been spent by the 
Company in preparing to defend the 
interests of our shareholders against 
the claim and proceedings initiated  
by Leni Gas & Oil plc (‘LGO’) in 
January 2013. The Company continues 
to refute the various claims that have 
been made by LGO. The allegations 
made are unfounded and the 
Company will defend itself and the 
interests of its shareholders rigorously. 
The case is due to come before the 
Commercial High Court in London in 
early March 2014.
Particularly given the production 
challenges of 2013, we have 
maintained a strong focus on the cost 
of our operations, and our corporate 
overheads. At the close of the year we 
moved our four-person London 
head-quarters to a small serviced 
office and, at the beginning of 
January, we announced that two of 
our Non-Executive Directors, Jake 
Ulrich and Matthew Clarke, had 
stepped down from the Board. I am 
very grateful to Jake and Matthew for 
their guidance and I know that they 
remain strong supporters of the 
Company. I am confident we have a 
Board of Directors that is well placed to 
guide the Company through its next 
phase of development.
Mediterranean Oil & Gas continues to 
build up a very experienced technical 
and management team highly 
capable of exploring and developing 
oil and gas assets. To that end the 
Board remains focused and committed 
to growing the Company and we are 
actively seeking additional opportunities 
to expand our current portfolio.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
thank our shareholders and our 
employees for their continued support.

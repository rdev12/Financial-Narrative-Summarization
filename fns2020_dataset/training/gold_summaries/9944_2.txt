Equity issue and amendments to 
the facility terms
The agreed amendments to the Group’s debt 
facilities and the proposed equity issue to 
raise £140 million (before expenses) together 
represent material progress in restructuring 
Mecom’s balance sheet. In particular:
net cash proceeds from the equity raise of •	
£133 million (approximately €149 million);
£30.6 million (€34.2 million) of the net •	
proceeds will be used to pay down the 
Group’s outstanding convertible loan notes, 
with the balance being used to pay down 
bank debt;
pro forma 2008 net debt of approximately •	
£340 million (€350 million), after taking into 
account the net proceeds of the equity 
issue and the net proceeds of the recently 
completed disposals of the Group’s German 
and Northwestern Norwegian businesses;
testing holiday of normal trading covenants •	
under the facility agreement until June 2010;
margin of 350 bps on the term loan, 300 •	
bps on the revolving credit facilities; and
total debt restructuring costs of •	
approximately £18 million (€20 million).
Mecom expects that full banking documentation 
will be finalised in mid May 2009 following which 
the Group expects to launch the equity issue. 
Key financials
The Group has presented its financial results 
on two bases below and in the Chairman’s 
statement, the Chief Executive’s review and 
the Divisional reviews. 
The first is “like-for-like”, which presents 
comparatives for the year to 31 December 2007 
as if Mecom had owned all of its divisions for that 
entire year so as to allow a better understanding 
of the underlying trading and financial 
performance of the Mecom divisions (these 
are shown as Group revenue, Group EBITDA 
and Group operating profit in the table below); 
this like-for-like information is also stated before 
exceptional items and amortisation of acquired 
intangibles and on a constant currency basis 
(being the average exchange rates prevailing 
in the year to 31 December 2008); this like-
for-like information also includes the results of 
Mecom Germany on a line-by-line basis. 
The second basis is “reported”, that is the 
results of the operations as they appear in 
the audited financial statements, which reflect  
the ownership of Wegener and Mecom Germany 
for only part of the year to 31 December 2007 
and present the results of Mecom Germany as 
a discontinued operation in the financial years 
to 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 . 
The effect of the acquisitions of Wegener and 
Mecom Germany part way through the year to 
31 December 2007 results in the two sets of 
reported results not being directly comparable.

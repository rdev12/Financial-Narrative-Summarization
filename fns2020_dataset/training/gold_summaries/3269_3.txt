 CHAMBERLIN & HILL plc  Annual Report 2006 4
Chairman’s Statement
“
The Group’s net
operating margin rose
to 5.8% compared to
4.9% previously.
”
I am pleased to report that on
turnover broadly in line with the
previous year at £41.44m (2005:
£41.97m) operating profit before
exceptional items increased 15.8%
to £2.40m (2005: £2.07m), and
pre-tax profit before exceptional
items was up 19.2% at £2.26m
(2005: £1.90m). As at the interim,
the results are presented under
International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) which have
affected both the content and
presentation of these and 
the comparative 2005 figures.
Reconciliations to previously
reported results are given in 
note 28 to the accounts.
Fully diluted underlying earnings
per share rose 18.6% to 21.5p
(2005: 18.1p). The Board is
recommending an unchanged final
dividend of 8.0p per share (11.85p
total for the year) payable on 
28 July 2006 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on
7 July 2006. Dividend cover has
now been restored to 1.8 times,
based on underlying earnings.
In the Interim Report we
announced our intention to close
the Bloxwich foundry. This activity
was undertaken speedily and
effectively, and while it was
responsible for most of the
exceptional restructuring costs
reported of £0.93m this was 
more than offset by an exceptional
gain of £1.03m on the sale of 
the site.
The Interim Report also stated that
we were examining ways to
mitigate the deficit in our final
salary pension scheme, and
following the sale of the Bloxwich
site the Group made a payment 
of £1.50m into the Chamberlin 
& Hill Staff Pension Scheme. 
This, together with favourable
investment returns, reduced the
Group’s defined benefit pension
scheme deficit to £0.49m (2005:
£3.32m) at the year end. 
The Group’s balance sheet remains
very strong with net cash at the
year end of £0.59m (2005: net
debt of £0.04m) after capital
expenditure of £1.44m. The equity
attributable to shareholders at 
31 March 2006 rose to £13.54m
(2005: £11.94m).
The Group’s net operating margin
rose to 5.8% compared to 4.9%
previously. The substantial increases
in the prices of ferrous metals and
metallurgical coke endured in the
previous year subsided somewhat,
although large increases in the
prices paid for electricity and gas

from last autumn again put margins
under pressure until fully recovered
from customers.
Having completed the first part of
our foundry integration programme
with the closure of Bloxwich and
the relocation of its workload
elsewhere in the Group, we
anticipate improved margins for
grey iron castings in the year
ahead. We have now embarked 
on the redevelopment of our
Scunthorpe foundry where we
intend to relocate the business
currently in Leicester by 2008, and
believe that the merger of Russell
Castings and Ductile Castings will
provide further opportunities for
margin enhancement.
In our Engineering Division
advances were made in redefining
our market opportunities, offshore
sourcing and new product
development, but the overall result
did not reflect the progress made in
the Foundry Division. Since the
year end a reorganisation has been
implemented in Fred Duncombe,
aimed at better exploiting that
company’s opportunities. 
Barrie Williams will stand down as
Chief Executive following the
Annual General Meeting on 28 July,
in preparation for his retirement 
in September. Barrie joined
Chamberlin & Hill in 1965,
becoming a Director in 1976 and
Chief Executive in 1995. During
this period he has made an
outstanding contribution to the
Group, and on behalf of the Board
I would like to record our sincere
thanks to him and to wish him a
long and happy retirement. I should
also like to thank him personally for
the support he has given me since 
I became Chairman.
As we announced on 20 March
2006, I am delighted to welcome
Tim Hair to the Board as Chief
Executive Designate and look
forward to working with him to
build further on the sound business
left by Barrie.
Current activity levels at our Walsall
Foundry are much improved and
elsewhere markets appear to be
running at or around predicted
levels. Current trading is in line with
our expectations. If this situation is
maintained we anticipate another
year of progress and will continue
to seek new and relevant
opportunities to further enhance
earnings.

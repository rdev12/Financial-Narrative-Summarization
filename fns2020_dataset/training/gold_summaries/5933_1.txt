 Chief Executive’s Strategy Review
“We have delivered a strong
performance in all of the key
areas of the business.”
2003 has been a year of
consolidation for Fibernet.
Having successfully completed
the restructuring of the business,
we have continued our rigid
focus on the key components
of securing increasing volumes
of new customer contracts,
maintaining a high renewal rate
for existing customer contracts,
prudent cash management
and rigorous cost control.
I am pleased to report that the
results of these endeavours,
together with the achievement
of a number of exceptional
benefits, are better than were
expected at the beginning of
the year , particularly considering
the relatively unfavourable
climate that has prevailed in
the telecommunications market
generally .
Of the £58.0m of new contracts
won in the year , £32.2m came
in the second half; this compares
favourably with £26.9m in the
same period the year before.
Contract renewals for existing
customers during the year
continued to be excellent.
We finished the year with almost
£25m of cash. This strong cash
position has been helped by a
profitability can also be seen in
the increase in EBITDA before
exceptional items from continuing
operations from £5.0m in 2002
to £7.3m this year .
Overall, I am pleased with the
Group’s progress for the year .
growth has been driven by the
new contracts secured in the
second half of last year and
the first half of 2003.
Normally it takes between one
and six months from the signing
of a contract to completing the
installation and initial billing to
the customer . As a result, many
of the contracts signed in the
second half of 2003 have yet to
be handed over to customers
and accordingly , such contracts
will start to contribute to revenues
in 2004.
In addition, with revenues being
recognised equally over the life
of each contract, we have yet to
enjoy a full year’s worth of benefit
from services installed during
the year . With long-term contracted
revenues having increased by
£25.9m from £71.9m to £97.8m,
I am confident that our service
contract revenues for next year
will exceed this year’s, assuming
that contract renewals continue
at the current rate.
The improvements in our
performance over last year have
also translated into a marked
reduction in our loss before tax
from £92.4m to £5.0m. In
addition, the improvements in
combination of increased
installation fees, diligent collection
from customers, the recovery
of VAT in France and Germany
and funds received as a result
of our network rates rebate.
Whilst we have achieved positive
operating cash flow , and whilst
we expect to achieve positive
net cash flow in the medium term,
we will continue to prudently
invest our cash in connecting
new customers onto our network
as new contracts are signed.
We remain confident that we
have sufficient funds to execute
our business plan.
In addition, we have continued
to successfully manage our
operating expenses relevant
to the Group’s requirements in
order to maintain its growth.
F ollowing the decline in underlying
revenues caused by a slowing
of new orders and the demise
of some of our Service Provider
customers almost two years 
ago, I am pleased to report that
the combined effect of our
achievements is that we have
seen service contract revenues
increase this year from £7.9m
in quarter one to £9.0m in
quarter four . Specifically , this

5 Customers and Markets
The UK market remains the core
of our business and the ever-
increasing use of communications
services for the exchange of
information continues to fuel its
growth. Whilst we have continued
to takeadvantage of new
opportunities such as the
increasing need of our customers
to back-up and store information,
much of our new business has
been derived from the
replacement of services hitherto
provided by competitors.
Our sustained ability to provide
innovative, reliable and cost
effective services to our key
markets of Enterprise and
Service Provider customers
is underpinned by the bespoke
way in which we design them,
not just at a technical level but
also from commercial and
contractual standpoints.
Evidence of this can be seen
in the new customer contracts
that have been won during
the year . Within the Enterprise
sector , these include the
Nationwide Building Society ,
T ransbus and NEXT , together
with new Service Provider
customers including Sprint,
IP Infrastructure and IBM.
to either improve our
competitiveness to win new
customers or to provide additional
services to existing customers
by taking advantage of the
original connection investment.
During the year , we have launched
two new national Ethernet
services, which have involved
a new deployment of technology
on our national network.
TANet Ethersphere provides
a low cost, high performance
service for the connection of
data users across a shared
resource. TANet Etherline
offers a higher guaranteed
quality of service and an
enhanced ability to combine
voice and video with computer
(data) traffic. Both of these
services have now achieved
new live customers and show
significant promise.
In London, we have more than
doubled the reach of our
metropolitan network with the
procurement of additional
network routes from another
service provider . This transaction
significantly increases the
market for all of our London
services, including applications
such as metropolitan Ethernet.
The London Carrier Ring (LCR)
has grown impressively during
the year with the average circuit
usage increasing by 30% and
has achieved new member
growth too. New customers
include Smartcom, Expo
Communications and Rasmitel.
In Germany , we retained our core
business in Frankfurt after the
re-organisation last year . This
business concentrates primarily
on Service Providers within the
city and as well as providing
bespoke metropolitan services
and links to London, derives
the majority of its business from
the Frankfurt Carrier Ring (FCR).
New customer wins include
Belgacom, Primus, T eleDanmark,
Digital Networks and Czech
Telecom.
I am pleased to report that this
part of our business is now
profitable, despite continuing
difficult market conditions and,
as with the UK, has a strong
pipeline going forward.
Product Development
This year has seen a record
number of new services being
developed and released to our
markets. All of them are designed
We also continued to sign
additional contracts with existing
customers. These include Opal
T elecom, Mistral and BT Wholesale
in our Service Provider market.
Enterprise customers include
the Co-operative Bank, Direct
Line and HSBC.
The renewing of existing customer
contracts remains key to our
success, not only from the rev enue
and profitability standpoints,
but also as a testament to our
ability to provide successful
and highly reputable services
to our customers. As I mentioned
earlier , renewal rates have been
excellent during the year across
both of our market sectors and
include, Cadbury Schweppes,
Deloitte & T ouche, Best People,
3i and NTL.
As we start our new financial
year , the pipeline for new and
additional business continues to
be healthy . We have traditionally
been strong in the financial
services part of our market,
and whilst we expect to continue
this, we have also been successful
in developing business in other
areas including Retail, T ransport
and with the increasingly
popular Outsourcing/Facilities
Management industry .

Chief Executive’s Strategy Review (continued) Stakeholders
In what has been another year
of uncertainty for the
telecommunications market,
our stakeholders have once
again shown great resilience in
their support for our business
and I take this opportunity of
thanking them all, especially
our dedicated employees.
I am sure that this underlying
confidence in Fibernet will, over
time, be fully justified.
Conclusion
The Group has achieved a
great deal this year . We have
delivered a strong performance
in all the key areas of the
business and have reached 
a significant milestone in our
business model. Our revenues
from long term, high quality
customer contracts now cover
our ongoing operating expenses.
As we recognise revenues 
from recent and forthcoming
contracts, we have the prospect
of a return to sustainable
profitability firmly in our sights.
Furthermore, the markets for
our services and the pipeline 
of business both remain strong,
which, together with our
considerable financial reserves,
place us in an excellent position
going forward.
Our traditional method of
connecting our customers onto
the network is via direct optical
fibre links from the customer
premises into the nearest Point
of Presence. This remains the
case for much of our business
where very high speeds of
network are needed. However ,
where the end user is a small to
medium sized business, or the
branch office of a large company ,
fibre is not usually cost effective
given that the speed requirement
will be relatively low .
In order f or Fibernet to competitiv ely
reach this market we have
developed a range of services
under the T ANet Access umbrella.
Initially , we began the rollout of
our own SDSL services using
equipment to attach to British
Telecommunications (BT)
copper wires. Whilst meeting
with some success, this proved
to be a slow process. T o address
this, we have now reached an
arrangement with BT under the
Partial Private Circuits (PPC)
initiative where we can rent
leased line circuit equivalents
at competitive wholesale rates
from them. In addition, we are
now rolling out a substantial
number of connections to the
BT network in order to deliver
these circuits to our customers.
I am very pleased with progress
in this regard with initial services
now coming on stream.
With the success of the London
and Frankfurt Carrier Ring 
(LCR and FCR) services we have
now launched a National Carrier
Ring (NCR), which extends 
the benefits across the United
Kingdom.
As mentioned at the half year ,
T ANet Callchoice, the call centre
voice service, has been
launched following successful
trials. I expect that resulting from
initial customer interest live
users will be contracted in the
coming months.
Looking forward, we are
developing further the capabilities
of our services. Our original
concept of providing full T otal
Area Networking services
(T ANet) where Fibernet fulfils all 
of the networking requirements
between the desktops of our
customers, moves closer with
each additional service. Y ou
may be assured that this
strategy will continue with the
announcement of further
service developments in the
coming year .

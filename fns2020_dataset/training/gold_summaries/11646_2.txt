During 2012 we reported positive developments across our core clinical 
programmes, strengthened our LentiVector
®
 technology platform and 
secured MHRA approval for our GMP manufacturing plant. Macroeconomic 
conditions remain challenging, however sentiment towards the 
biopharmaceutical sector is improving and we are seeing more interest  
than ever in personalised medicines and niche disease indications,  
all of which positions Oxford BioMedica well for further developments  
in the year ahead.  Oxford BioMedica plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2012 03

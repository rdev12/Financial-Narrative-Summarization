 04 Pure Wafer plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Chief executive’s review
Highlights
  Another year of record 300mm 
reclaim volumes
  Further capacity increases 
underway
  Arizona site performed in line 
with expectations
  New customers on board
  Market growth continues
Operational review
Volumes for all wafer sizes were increased during the year, with 300mm volumes up by 53% 
and 200mm volumes up by 131% (enhanced by our North American acquisition). The month 
of June 2007 saw a record for 300mm wafer reclaim at Pure Wafer.
We are planning to further increase our 300mm wafer reclaim capacity at the Swansea site 
to 100,000 wafers per month at the end of the ﬁnancial year to June 2008, through further 
process development and capital expenditure. Such expenditure will be fully funded through 
cash generation and existing facilities.
Prescott site, Arizona, US
The development of the US site that we acquired in February this year continues in line with our 
original plans. The existing business is cash positive and proﬁtable on an operating proﬁt level. 
I am pleased to announce that the transfer of the 300mm technology from our Swansea site is 
progressing satisfactorily: the ﬁrst 300mm wafer reclaim line is now substantially in place and the 
installation is running according to plan, both in terms of cost and time. We expect capacity of 
this 300mm line to be approximately 20,000 wafers per month at the end of our ﬁnancial year 
to June 2008.
Market and products
Our customer base has signiﬁcantly increased as a result of the acquisition, more than doubling 
to over 80 customer sites, and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome all new Pure Wafer 
customers and to thank them for their support through the change of ownership of the US plant.
Smaller diameter wafer reclaim (100mm, 125mm and 150mm) is a new addition to the Pure Wafer 
product portfolio and has been gained through our US acquisition. These are proﬁtable product 
lines, with well established processes in a developed market place.
The current slowdown within the semiconductor industry is having the impact of reducing the 
demand for smaller diameter wafer reclaim as customers look to switch towards the more efﬁcient 
300mm manufacturing. With the comprehensive product offerings within the business we are well 
placed to support our customers through this transition.
Both the Swansea site and the newly acquired Arizona site 
performed in line with our expectations.

As expected, the competitive landscape is increasing as the market continues its growth, with 
two new 300mm competitors emerging in Taiwan and existing competitors continuing to increase 
capacity. We feel that we are well placed with our multi-site locations, leading technology, and 
wealth of experience, to maintain our position as a leading supplier of 300mm products.
During the year we shipped in high volume our new 50nm product offering. This product is very 
much in the early stages of product ramp, but we remain optimistic about the future potential of 
this product line.
New technology
We are continuing to look at opportunities outside of wafer reclaim, following the successful 
introduction of our 50nm product. We are conﬁdent that there are many more ways that we can 
leverage our world-class cleanrooms and silicon polishing expertise in order to continue to deliver 
increasing shareholder value in the future.

What sets us apart
2014 highlights
Our gold equivalent (GE) production
1
 
was 1.43 Moz, up by 12%. This 
exceeded both our original production 
guidance of 1.3 Moz of GE by 10% and 
the updated guidance of 1.365 Moz  
by 5%. This was largely due to the  
full ramp-up of Mayskoye and strong 
operational delivery at Dukat 
and Omolon.
We acquired the Kyzyl gold project  
in Kazakhstan. With gold reserves  
of 6.7 Moz at 7.5 g/t (JORC), this has 
increased Polymetal’s gold equivalent 
reserves by 50%. The project has  
a mine life of at least 20 years with 
substantial exploration potential.
Increased free cash flow generation 
enabled us to go beyond the regular 
dividend and pay a special dividend  
of US$0.20 per ordinary share 
(approximately US$84 million in total).
1
 Gold equivalent is calculated based on 1:60 Ag/Au  
and 5:1 Cu/Au conversion ratios.
1
 Total cash costs comprise cost of sales of the operating assets (adjusted for depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses and write-down of inventory to net realisable value and certain other 
adjustments, including addition of treatment and refinery charges related to concentrate offtake) and general, administrative and selling expenses of the operating assets. Gold equivalent sales 
volume is calculated based on average realised metal prices in the relevant period. Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated as total cash costs divided by total gold 
equivalent unit ounces sold.
2
 The Company defines adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, write downs of inventory to net realisable 
value, share-based compensation, additional mining tax, VAT, penalties and accrued interest, income on disposal of subsidiaries, bargain purchase gains, foreign exchange gains/(losses), 
changes in fair value of derivatives, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs, and income tax expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA 
divided by revenue. See Note 6 to the financial statements.
3
 Free cash flow is defined as total operating cash flows less investing cash flow (2014: excluding cash payment for the Kyzyl acquisition).
4
 Mineral resources and ore reserves are estimated in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). Mineral resources are additional to ore reserves.
5
 Average headcount for the period.

Our commitment  
to shareholder value  
creation is underpinned 
by a preference for  
high-grade assets,  
a strong operating and 
project delivery record, 
and capital discipline.
High-grade assets 
 
Our focus on grade and a preference  
for open-pit mines are key factors in 
maintaining lower operating costs and 
reducing per-ounce capital expenditure. 
Proven operating track  
record: delivering and 
exceeding expectations
Our track record speaks for itself: for  
the third consecutive year, we beat our 
production guidance despite difficult 
trading conditions. Our gold equivalent 
(GE) production for 2014 was 1.43 Moz, 
an increase of 12%, exceeding both our 
original production guidance of 1.3 Moz 
of GE (by 10%) and an updated guidance 
of 1.365 Moz (by 5%).
Capital discipline:  
strong free cash flow  
and substantial dividends
Our investment and capital structure 
decisions are based on a strong culture 
of capital discipline. Our project 
development and acquisition decisions 
are only approved if they are able to 
deliver the required return on capital.  
The free cash flow generated allows  
us to deliver a meaningful dividend 
payout while maintaining a comfortable 
leverage level.
Pipeline of quality  
growth projects 
Growth is essential to the long-term  
value of the mining business. With a 
major construction programme within 
existing assets now completed, we are 
concentrating on our next growth phase 
with the development of Kyzyl, Svetloye 
and our platinum group assets. Our latest 
acquisition, Kyzyl, is a world-class asset 
and one of the largest untapped, 
high-grade gold deposits globally.

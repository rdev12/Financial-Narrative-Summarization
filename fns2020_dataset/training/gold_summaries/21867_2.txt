 Brit PLC  Annual Report 2014     5     
STRATEGIC REPORT
Overview
We are a market-leading global specialty 
insurer and the largest business that 
trades solely on the Lloyd’s of London 
platform, the world’s leading specialist 
commercial insurance market. 
We provide highly specialised insurance 
products to support our clients across  
a broad range of complex risks, with  
a strong focus on property, energy and 
casualty business. 
We operate globally via our own 
international distribution network that 
benefits from Lloyd’s global licences. 
Our underwriting capabilities are 
underpinned by strong financials and 
our commitment to deliver superior 
returns to our shareholders.
We consider asset management as  
a core competency and integral  
part of our business. We seek to 
optimize the risk-adjusted return on  
our asset portfolio while never losing  
sight of our ongoing obligations to 
policyholders. 
Underwriting
Brit predominantly underwrites complex, 
high value insurance and reinsurance 
business. Insurance forms in excess of 
80% of our GWP . Our largest source  
of business is the US excess and  
surplus lines market and the majority  
of our premium income is denominated 
in US dollars, although the risks 
underwritten are distributed globally. 
We complement our core classes with 
highly specialised niche lines which 
provide diversification and the potential 
for high returns.
We underwrite primarily in London, but 
have developed an extensive network 
of local offices in the US, Bermuda, 
Japan and China to access business 
that does not usually reach Lloyd’s. We 
lead or are second agreement party 
on approximately 70% of the business 
we write, underlining our underwriting 
strength and expertise.
We source our business from a range 
of producers including the three largest 
brokers and also from a wide range of 
middle tier intermediaries. The majority 
of reinsurance business is sourced 
through the global reinsurance brokers.
Our platform and operations
We operate a strong and efficient capital 
model, with significant capital strength 
(as demonstrated by our 150.4% capital 
ratio), combined with capital efficiency 
resulting from our focus on the Lloyd’s 
platform.
Our underwriting and investment teams 
are supported by an efficient, flexible 
and scalable operating platform.  
We believe that the platform provides 
a stable foundation that enables us 
to pursue our strategy of focusing 
on maximising profitability of the 
underwriting business and extending  
our global distribution network.
Investment Management
At Brit we have a significant investment 
portfolio comprising financial invest-
ments, investment-related derivatives 
and cash. The value of our invested 
assets at 31 December 2014 was 
£2.6bn. The principal focus is on a 
portfolio of income-generating assets 
across a range of sectors to balance 
risk and return, complemented by 
an allocation to growth assets. The 
investment portfolio is managed for the 
most part by external asset managers 
under the direction of an experienced 
in-house team. Despite the low rate and 
challenging investment environment, 
our portfolio has generated favourable 
returns net of investment management 
fees in recent years (2014: 2.9%; 2013: 
2.1%; 2012: 2.9%).
Our culture and values
We are passionate about our business, 
our people and our customers and we 
have focused on cultivating a franchise 
that is built on delivering exceptional 
service. Our culture is centred on 
achievement and we have established 
a framework that identifies and rewards 
strong performance. Our objectives are 
aligned to those of our departments and 
employees, so that all of our employees 
understand the vital part they play in  
our success.

OUR TRACK RECORD 
AND FINANCIAL 
STRENGTH
OUR CAPABILITIES AND AMBITION ARE  
UNDERPINNED BY OUR STRONG FINANCIAL  
POSITION. OUR BUSINESS IS UNDERWRITTEN  
EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-
ALIGNED LLOYD’S SYNDICATE 2987, WHICH 
BENEFITS FROM LLOYD’S RATINGS OF  
A (EXCELLENT) FROM A.M. BEST, AA- (VERY 
STRONG) FROM FITCH RATINGS AND A+ 
(STRONG) FROM STANDARD & POOR’S. 
Track record  
Over the past six years, we have success-
fully transformed Brit into a simpler, more 
focused, more profitable, more efficient 
and more dynamic business, driven by 
some of the industry’s best talent. We 
have been proactive in delivering the 
best service for our clients and attractive 
returns to shareholders.
Over this six-year period Brit has 
demonstrated a strong track record 
of profitable underwriting, strong net 
investment returns and growth in core 
business lines.
We have also demonstrated disciplined 
capital management, with paid or 
recommended distributions totalling 
87.7% of total value created over the 
period 2011 to 2014. In addition the 
Group released a further £270m of 
capital to shareholders following the 
successful sale of the UK Insurance 
company in 2012. Over the same 
period, we have grown our surplus 
capital adjusted for the recommended 
2014 dividends, to £251.7m.
In 2014, we continued to build on this 
track record with 9.8% growth in gross 
written premium (GWP) to £1.3bn, 
profit after tax of £139.0m and return 
on adjusted net tangible assets before 
foreign exchange movements and IPO 
costs (RoNTA) of 20.7%.
Financial strength
At 31 December 2014 we had capital 
resources equal to 150.4% of the 
management capital requirements 
needed to support our business. Our 
capital strength provides flexibility to 
allow us to cope with major losses while 
not deviating from our commitment 
to fund profitable expansion and to 
provide an attractive dividend for 
shareholders.

STRATEGIC REPORT
In 2011, Brit was acquired by Achilles 
Netherlands Holdings B.V , a member of 
a Luxembourg-based group backed by  
a number of investment funds managed 
by Apollo and CVC private equity houses. 
Brit subsequently delisted from the 
London Stock Exchange and embarked 
on a major restructuring programme. 
Successful transformation 
Over the period from 2008 to 2012, we 
carried out a significant transformation, 
refocusing our strategy as set out on 
pages 10 and 11. In 2008, following the 
global financial crises, we commenced  
re-underwriting significant portions of 
the portfolio and then continued in 2011 
with the streamlining of our business 
model under new ownership and new 
management. There were five key themes 
to this transformation:
• Focus on the Lloyd’s platform and 
disposal of non-core businesses;
• Focus on underwriting shorter tail 
more profitable business lines;
• Improvement of investment 
capability, performance and controls;
• Expense efficiency and operational 
scalability; and
• Strong capital management.
 
This major programme of change delivered  
excellent and improving results in 2011, 
2012 and 2013 and we successfully 
executed an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 
25% of Brit PLC and were admitted to the 
London Stock Exchange on 2 April 2014. 
Brit PLC is now a member of the FTSE 
250. With the formation of this new UK 
incorporated parent company, we moved 
the domicile of the Group back to the UK. 
The move affirms our commitment to the 
UK and its supportive business, political 
and regulatory regimes.

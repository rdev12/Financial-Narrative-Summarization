 06 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Charter delivered excellent results for 2008, which showed
material growth compared with 2007 in terms of revenue, 
profit and earnings per share.
The Company’s results for 2008 continue to demonstrate 
the progress which has been made in developing both ESAB
and Howden, and were achieved in a year which saw generally
favourable market conditions during the first three quarters 
of the year followed by a sharp deterioration in economic 
and financial conditions in the final quarter. 
In 2008, revenue increased by 30 per cent to £1,887.0 million
and operating profit before exceptional items increased by 
21 per cent to £209.3 million.
Our principal measure of the value that we are creating for
shareholders is adjusted earnings per share, which increased 
by 17 per cent to 99.2 pence per share. We also seek to ensure
that earnings are underpinned by the continued generation 
of cash; in 2008, cash flow from operations was £159.5 million
(2007: £149.1 million), an increase of 7 per cent. 
Summary of results and performance against key indicators
The key performance indicators used by the Board in assessing
the results of ESAB and Howden and the consolidated results 
of Charter are summarised in the adjacent table, alongside
comparatives for 2007. 
In relation to each indicator, the outcome for the year is
considered against the outcome for the previous year and
against budget, taking into account internal and external
factors, including changes in market conditions, and any
unusual or non-recurring items, which otherwise might have 
a distorting effect on the outcome. 
The results for 2008 continue the trend of growth in adjusted
earnings per share and cash flow from operations, as both
ESAB and Howden have been strengthened and improved.
In 2008, ESAB achieved strong increases in its revenue 
and operating profit compared with 2007, despite the sharp
deterioration in market conditions in the final quarter of the year.
The results for the first three quarters of the year were well
ahead of the demanding targets set by the Board, and the
overall result was in line with the reduced forecasts that 
were prepared during the fourth quarter of the year. 
Howden’s revenue and operating profit were in line with the
targets set by the Board at the start of the year, which reflected
generally favourable market conditions across Howden’s
principal markets in power generation and the oil and gas
industries worldwide.

OUR BUSINESSES
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
The Board considers that the best measure of the extent 
to which Charter is generating shareholder value is adjusted
earnings per share, which excludes exceptional and other 
items considered by the Board to be not directly related to 
the underlying performance of the Group. The actual growth 
in adjusted earnings per share achieved by Charter in 2008 
of 17.1 per cent was ahead of budget, despite the change in
economic conditions during the year. The Board is also focused
on the cash generated from operations which increased during 
the year to £159.5 million (2007: £149.1 million), an increase 
of 7 per cent.
It is recognised that financial performance is not a sufficient
measure on its own. Non-financial key performance indicators,
such as health and safety and environmental measures, are
monitored with robust plans in place to continuously improve
performance. These matters receive regular focus, both 
from management and the Board, and are reported on 
in the Company’s Corporate Social Responsibility Report 
(see pages 32 to 35).
Charter’s strategy
The Board continues to believe that the long-term prognosis
remains positive for both of Charter’s businesses despite the
current financial and economic conditions. Charter’s long-term
strategy is to deliver sustained growth in shareholder value
through the continued development of ESAB and Howden. 
The annual review of strategy, which was approved by the
Board in September 2008, confirmed the potential for Charter 
to continue to make significant progress in growing operating
profit and earnings over the next five years, although it was
recognised that the deterioration in economic conditions may
restrict the growth which could be achieved especially in the
earlier years of this five-year period. 
The Board concluded that Charter should remain focused 
on its two businesses, both of which it believes are capable 
of creating significant additional value for shareholders. 
ESAB and Howden have the resources and intention to continue
to maintain their positions as leaders in their respective fields.
Both are capable of further development and will continue 
to invest in their businesses, new products and ways to service
the market. In 2009, the focus of this investment will be on
operational improvement and cost reduction. 
More information on the strategies to be pursued by ESAB 
and Howden are set out in the Business Reviews. 
Review of 2008 
2008 was a year of contrasts. The first three quarters were
marked by high levels of activity, escalating commodity prices
and the need for both ESAB and Howden to manage potential
pinch points in their respective supply chains, whilst the final
quarter saw an unprecedented contraction in the availability 
of credit, sharp falls in commodity prices and the onset of 
an economic downturn from which the timing of a sustained
recovery remains uncertain. 
ESAB and Howden have faced different challenges and have
responded in different ways, reflecting the characteristics 
of the industries in which they operate. 
ESAB
During the first three quarters of 2008 ESAB traded strongly,
with revenues and profits significantly higher than the previous
year. Activity in certain key end-user industries, particularly in
the automotive sector, dropped sharply in October as economic
and financial conditions deteriorated, which led to reduced
demand for ESAB’s welding consumables and equipment.
Since October, ESAB has reduced manned capacity for
consumables by 16 per cent globally and for equipment by 
20 per cent in Europe and North America. This included the
closure of a flux plant in Gothenburg, Sweden and a solid 
wire plant in Finland. The exceptional costs of this restructuring,
which will be spread across 2008 and 2009, are expected 
to amount to some £10 million. 
Further details on ESAB’s 2008 performance and restructuring
are given in ESAB’s business review on pages 10 to 17.
Howden
Howden had another excellent year, and produced a markedly
stronger performance in the second half of the year, reflecting
the strength of its order book. Further details are contained 
in the Howden business review on pages 18 to 23.
Balance sheet 
During the year the balance sheet strengthened further, 
with shareholders’ funds increasing by £151.9 million to 
£578.3 million, reflecting retained profit of £150.2 million 
and exchange translation gains of £116.3 million, offset by 
net after tax losses on cash flow and net investment hedges 
of £36.0 million, dividends paid of £31.7 million, an increase 
in retirement benefit obligations of £45.8 million and other
reductions of £1.1 million.

CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
In addition, ESAB is focused on identifying and implementing
further cost reductions in its manufacturing, assembly and
distribution operations and support, administrative and central
functions; these will be implemented throughout 2009. 
ESAB’s order backlog for engineered automation equipment
stands at about nine months, which is broadly in line with the
level at 30 June 2008, and gives good visibility for the business
for the remainder of 2009. The cutting business has around
three months of orders in hand, which is typical for the
business, although order intake has been slowing.
Howden
Howden’s new equipment sales for 2009 will be underpinned 
by its order book which as at 1 January 2009 included orders
worth some £390 million for delivery in 2009, and a further 
£110 million for delivery thereafter. Howden’s order book
continued to grow in January, and the size of the order 
book also benefitted from exchange rate movements.
In addition to fulfilling these orders, a principal objective for
Howden in 2009 is to maintain a strong order book throughout
the year. Overall, we continue to see opportunities in each 
of Howden’s principal markets around the world and the level 
of enquiries remains encouraging, although we expect that the
rate of order intake will be slower in the first half of 2009 than 
it was in 2008 due to the current financial environment and
economic downturn. The re-instatement of the Clean Air
Interstate Rules (‘CAIR’) in the USA and the Large Combustion
Plant Directive in the European Union are likely to support new
activity for emission control equipment, whilst in China, falling
power demand is likely to lead to lower new build activity. 
Demand for Howden’s compressors from customers in the 
oil and gas and petrochemical sectors is holding up well 
at present; this part of Howden’s business is becoming 
more significant as time goes on. 
At the present time, order cancellations have been immaterial
and only a small number of orders have been deferred from
2009 to 2010.
The aftermarket continues to represent a growth opportunity
and China, in particular, is showing positive momentum.
Cash flow, acquisitions and financing
With the continued focus on cash generation and control of
working capital, cash inflow from operations was £159.5 million.
Charter finished the year with a net cash balance of £51.8 million
compared with £88.2 million at 31 December 2007, which also
reflects dividend payments during the year of £31.7 million,
capital expenditure of £66.5 million and expenditure on
acquisitions of £39.4 million.
During the year, Charter companies completed three acquisitions.
ESAB acquired Romar Positioning Equipment Pte Limited, a
leading designer and manufacturer of automation and positioning
equipment based in Singapore, and also acquired the factory,
plant and certain other assets of Linkweld, a manufacturer 
of solid wire in Italy. Howden acquired Aeolus Industria 
e Comercio Ltda, a Brazilian industrial fans manufacturer. 
During the year, Charter renewed its financing facilities and
presently has committed facilities of £145 million with maturity
dates between 2011 and 2013.
2009 outlook
As we progress through the early part of 2009, there is no clear
visibility yet of how general market conditions will develop. 
ESAB
ESAB has started the year with volumes of consumables generally
in line with expectations. We expect continuing instability as
markets are affected differently by macro-economic conditions
and much depends upon the infrastructure and energy
segments which will be key in determining ESAB’s outcome 
for the year. 
We believe that the measures that we implemented in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and are in progress in the first quarter of 2009
are appropriate to meet the lower levels of activity which we 
are likely to see in 2009 but we will continually monitor market
conditions across different product areas and geographies 
to ensure that capacity and demand are in line. Our expectation
is that these measures will result in further exceptional costs of
£3 million to £4 million this year (in addition to the exceptional
charge of £6.2 million incurred in 2008) and lead to annualised
cost savings of £30 million per year. ESAB has formulated plans
for each region which will be implemented if activity levels
contract further.  09
OUR BUSINESSES
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Management remains vigilant to any softening of demand.
Howden has worked extensively to ensure that its growth 
in recent years has been built on flexible supply chains and
relatively low levels of fixed cost. With the visibility of a strong
order book, Howden will be able to respond pro-actively 
to any slowdown in order intake. 
Concluding comments 
Since October 2008 there has been a marked deterioration 
in global economic and financial conditions which had led to
reduced demand for ESAB welding consumables and equipment.
Notwithstanding this slowdown, as we progress through 2009,
we can take confidence from the global presence, market
leadership positions, strong technology and flexible cost bases
of both ESAB and Howden, which are supported by Charter’s
strengthened balance sheet and positive long-term dynamics 
in the businesses’ key end-user segments. All of these we
believe will assist Charter to resume growth as and when
economic and financial conditions improve.

OVERVIEW
d 2w is a masterbatch system which, when 
included in the manufacturing stage turns 
ordinary plastic at the end of its useful life 
into a material with a different molecular 
structure. At that stage it is no longer a 
plastic and has become a material which  
is inherently biodegradable in the open 
environment in the same way as a leaf.

anti-counterfeiting performance. They offer 
the ability to determine the authenticity

OVERVIEW
The d 2Detector is a portable XRF (X-ray) 
device that allows customers, and the 
authorities in countries with relevant 
legislation, to determine in less than 60 
seconds whether or not a plastic product 
contains d
2w, d 2p or d 2t additives as 
specified, and whether it contains any 
undesirable substances.

 Since 1999 we have been helping 
UK households save money on 
their household bills and finances. 
We help consumers through three 
leading brands: 
MoneySuperMarket, 
TravelSupermarket and 
MoneySavingExpert.
Our strategic priorities
Our strategy is to build on our core 
business of helping customers to 
find the right product. Investing in 
our technology, customer data and 
tools allows us to build deeper 
relationships, delivering more value 
to both customers and providers.
Our performance
We increased the number of 
people engaging with us. This 
helped grow our revenues and 
market shares. Our technology 
investment programme is 
ongoing.
We launched new platforms for 
several of our channels. In the 
late autumn, our new car 
insurance site went into live test. 
Our new platforms leverage 
technology investment across our 
brands and services. 
Our customer account, MyProfile, 
allowed more than 15m 
customers to keep their data up 
to date and use it to save money 
with us. We recruited 2.3m new 
customers who want to do 
business with us. In our Money 
channels we worked hard to get 
market-leading products.
We made significant 
improvements to our CRM  
and organic search capability, 
helping providers reach the right 
customers. 
We take pride in being a 
profitable and efficient company 
that has a clear focus on its 
customers. We delivered on these 
goals in 2014.

Marketing margin
2015 will see exciting innovation in 
TravelSupermarket, continued 
rollout of new technology to more 
MoneySuperMarket channels and 
new tools for MoneySavingExpert.
The sites need to continually 
adapt to changing customer 
needs. There is a risk that our 
technology takes longer to 
implement than planned, or does 
not deliver the expected benefits 
to customers and returns to the 
Group.
We will continue to add new 
channels to MyProfile. We will 
offer customers a greater range 
of services and analysis-based 
insights to help them save money.
The Group needs to continue to 
invest in its brands and its 
product offerings. There are 
always risks that we make 
mistakes in these. Our 
relationships with our customers 
are dependent on our ability to 
protect the data they choose to 
leave with us. 
We will use our data tools, 
analytics and position as the only 
major independent price 
comparison website to develop 
relationships with providers and 
secure market leading exclusive 
products for customers.
Our business is dependent on 
providers continuing to want to 
acquire new customers and to 
want to use price comparison 
websites for this.
Our strategy focuses on efficiency 
and on our customers. In 2015, 
we will measure ourselves on 
Adjusted Operating Profit rather 
than adjusted EBITDA, reflecting 
our technology investment.
Weakness in the UK economy 
could reduce the range of 
attractive products available for 
our customers, which could 
impact our revenues and 
margins.

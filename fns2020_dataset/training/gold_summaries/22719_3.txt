First impressions
Dominated by its history over the 
past five years, CPP had become an 
organisation preoccupied with the 
past, which was UK-centric in its focus 
and behaviours, despite the extraordinary 
potential developing in its overseas markets  
In 2016 we have started work to redefine 
the organisation in order to refocus our 
resources towards building a successful 
international operation, using the talent 
and skills in our overseas businesses as 
well as those that we have in the UK  
These changes will not happen overnight, 
but the organisation is progressing, led 
by a Group Chief Executive who has been 
skilful in keeping morale high whilst 
introducing difficult changes  This has 
been a solid start to building a better future 
Chairman’s statement
CPPGroup Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 8 Progress to date
At the initiative of shareholders, the Board 
was mostly changed in early May 2016 and a 
new Group Chief Executive, Jason Walsh, was 
appointed  Shortly afterwards, all the new Directors 
were approved by the FCA  This was then followed 
by the appointment of Justine Shaw as People & 
Culture Director  Michael Corcoran has advised the 
Board of his intention to stand down from the business 
and the Board with effect from 30 April 2017  
Michael has made an invaluable contribution to 
the stability of the Group and provided continuity 
during a period of potential risk to the business 
and the Board wishes him well in his future roles 
A major review of the Group’s strategy was launched 
during the year  This review has already concluded 
that resources need to be shifted towards providing 
greater support to our businesses in the rapidly 
developing markets for our products in India, 
China, Turkey and Mexico  At the same time, 
line management of the UK business has been 
separated from the Group functions in order to 
treat the UK as a self-standing market alongside 
other developed markets, such as Germany and 
our Southern European markets, as well as the 
developing high growth markets mentioned 
above  The UK’s regulated businesses have been 
ring-fenced against the background of establishing 
an open and constructive dialogue with the FCA  
New product development is being refocused to 
enable legacy products to be adapted to meet 
customer requirements in all markets whilst 
styling new innovative products to be attractive 
propositions, in either a chosen developing market, 
or in an established market prior to global roll-out  
These new products may include regulated 
(insurance) content alongside non-regulated 
(service) content  Design will be driven by 
customer requirements  Our recently announced 
acquisition of Blink Innovation Limited (Blink) 
adds further substance to our product ambitions 
During a period of change in the organisational 
structure and behaviour, senior management 
had become stretched  In January 2017, the Board 
agreed a temporary extension to Nick Cooper’s 
role in order to provide additional capacity to 
Jason Walsh and his executive team  One of the 
many benefits of Nick’s willingness to contribute 
in this way is that it avoids the immediate temptation 
to make permanent appointments too quickly to 
an organisational structure that is still evolving 
Governance
The Board is committed to maintaining high 
standards of governance, both at Board level 
and operationally throughout the business  
A number of key permanent appointments 
have been made during the year to support this 
approach and strengthen our internal controls 
Performance
The Group’s performance in 2016 had many 
positive developments  However, there remains 
a good deal of work to be done to return the Group 
to a position of strength and sustainable growth 
and the Board sees this development as a long 
term goal, which will ultimately benefit all of the 
Company’s stakeholders  The Board has approved 
this Annual Report & Accounts as being fair, 
balanced and understandable, providing the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy 
Looking ahead 
2016 saw the first steps in laying the foundations 
for a prosperous and sustainable future and I look 
forward to continuing that progress in 2017  
On behalf of the Board I would especially like to 
thank our valued colleagues for their commitment 
and hard work during the year and very much look 
forward to working with you all in the coming year

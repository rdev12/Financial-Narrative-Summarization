 Performance highlights
2014 results demonstrate clear delivery against our commitments
In 2014, Rio Tinto made a commitment to materially increase cash returns to shareholders. The Group delivered this through a 12 per cent increase in the full year
dividend and announced a US$2.0 billion share buy-back. These represent a total cash return to shareholders, in respect of 2014, of almost US$6.0 billion.
During 2014, Rio Tinto’s continued financial and operating discipline enabled the Group to offset much of the impact of lower commodity prices. By increasing
volumes and reducing costs, Rio Tinto achieved underlying earnings
(a)
of US$9.3 billion and maintained the EBITDA margin
(b)
at 39 per cent. Free cash flow was
assisted by a further reduction in capital expenditure
(c)
and a successful programme to release working capital. As a consequence, net debt
(d)
reduced by
US$5.6 billion to US$12.5 billion.
Decisive early action taken throughout the Group delivered the strong balance sheet, enabling the additional material cash return to shareholders.
With lower commodity prices and uncertain global economic trends, the operating environment remains tough. However, in these conditions Rio Tinto’s qualities and
competitive advantages deliver superior value. The Group’s combination of world-class assets, disciplined capital allocation, balance sheet strength, operating and
commercial excellence, and a culture of safety and integrity gives Rio Tinto confidence in its ability to continue generating sustainable returns for shareholders.

(e) Gearing ratio is defined as net debt divided by the sum of net debt and total equity at each period end.
Revenues and earnings
– Achieved consolidated sales revenues of US$47.7 billion, as a
US$5.4 billion (pre-tax) decline in pricing was partially offset by
US$3.0 billion from higher volumes.
– Sustained the EBITDA margin at 39 per cent, unchanged from 2013,
with volume gains and cost improvements offsetting the impact of
lower prices.
– Achieved underlying earnings of US$9.3 billion, nine per cent lower than
2013 despite the US$4.1 billion (post-tax) impact of lower prices.
– Delivered underlying earnings per share of 503.4 US cents.
– Generated net earnings of US$6.5 billion, reflecting non-cash exchange
rate losses of US$1.9 billion, a US$0.4 billion charge following the repeal
of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax and other charges of US$0.5 billion. An
impairment charge of US$1.2 billion mainly related to the Kitimat project
as reported at the half year was mostly offset by an impairment reversal of
US$1.0 billion in the second half of 2014 related to an uplift in carrying
value for the Pacific Aluminium business.
Production
– Set production records for iron ore and Hunter Valley thermal coal,
and delivered a strong operational performance in bauxite, copper
and aluminium.
Cash flow and balance sheet
– Achieved US$4.8 billion of sustainable operating cash cost
improvements and exploration and evaluation savings since 2012, of
which US$1.5 billion were in 2014.
– Generated net cash from operating activities of US$14.3 billion,
including working capital improvements of US$1.5 billion, principally
from lower inventories and lower receivables.
– Reduced capital expenditure by US$4.8 billion to US$8.2 billion in
2014, reflecting completion of existing major projects and continued
capital discipline.
– Decreased net debt by US$5.6 billion in 2014 to US$12.5 billion at
31 December 2014, with gearing of 18.6 per cent. This compares with
US$18.1 billion and 25.2 per cent gearing at 31 December 2013.
Capital returns
– Increased full year dividend by 12 per cent to 215 US cents per share.
– Announced an additional capital return of US$2.0 billion,
which comprises a A$500 million (c. US$0.4 billion) off-market share
buy-back tender of Rio Tinto Limited shares and the balance of
approximately US$1.6 billion for an on-market buy-back of Rio Tinto
plc shares.
– These represent a total cash return to shareholders, in respect of 2014,
of almost US$6.0 billion, an increase of approximately 64 per cent
on 2013.

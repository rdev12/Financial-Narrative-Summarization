 Another year of strong turnover and excellent profit figures have been
achieved, although slightly down on last year. This year’s turnover at
£29,363,893 and last year’s at £37,272,645 were substantially better than
historical levels.
Profit before tax and exceptional items for the year was £6,682,042 compared
with a profit before tax and exceptional items of £12,070,793 in the prior year .
The substantial level of profits earned during the period is due to the
application of engineering, manufacturing and sales techniques in supplying
world beating products.
Shareholders will no doubt have welcomed the £15,191,577 returned to them
through two share buy backs in the year which, together with £3,083,155
returned to them in the previous year, equates to  £18,274,732, amounting to
94p per share based on the 19.4 million shares currently in issue. £5.4 million
cash was retained at the year end.
A two year MOD contract came to an end with all equipment delivered,
approved and accepted by this exacting customer.  Product deployment in
December 2012 was a satisfying end to two years of dedicated work. However,
changes in operational requirements for overseas forces, the impending
withdrawal of ISAF forces from Afghanistan and the change in tactics employed
by insurgents have resulted in a substantial reduction in the deployment of
our innovative and unique detector at present.
The Specialist Electronics Division has now been able to concentrate its
resource and effort on developing new products and markets, and to place
emphasis on a global sales drive. Reference is made in the financial statements
to a number of innovative devices having unique selling points. These products
are predominantly for use in non‐conflict situations and are being marketed
in the UK and in a number of other selected countries.
At the annual Distributor Conference held in Corby in April 2013, attended by
more than 30 Distributors from across the globe, these products were
launched and enthusiastically received.  
Property Information Services (PSG) and Packaging Solutions (Moore & Buckle)
both had a profitable year. 
We are grateful to the outstanding commitment and loyalty of our employees
who have been substantially responsible for the excellent achievements.
The Specialist Electronics Division is our main focus as it redevelops and re‐
energises its core marketplace supported by a dynamic marketing strategy.
The positive response it is receiving from potential customers can be attributed
to the rapid and cooperative dovetailing of the sales and engineering teams.
We look forward to reporting to shareholders the results of these initiatives in
due course.

 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
GROUP OPERATING PROFIT, BEFORE RESTRUCTURING 
COSTS, REDUCED FROM £14.6 MILLION TO £1 2.6 MILLION 
AS RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES AND HIGHER UK 
ENERGY COSTS REDUCED MARGINS. OVERALL VOLUMES 
FELL BELOW 2007 AS WE FELT THE FULL IMPACT OF 
THE REDUCTION IN UK CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY 
AND EXPERIENCED A SHARP REDUCTION IN OVERALL 
VOLUMES IN THE FINAL QUARTER. OUR AGRICULTURAL 
ACQUISITION IN NORTH AMERICA PERFORMED AHEAD 
OF EXPECTATIONS AND CONTRIBUTED FIRST TIME 
OPERATING PROFITS OF £0.8 MILLION.
WE HAVE TAKEN DECISIVE ACTION DURING 2008 
TO ELIMINATE EXCESS CAPACITY, REDUCE OUR 
COST BASE AND MOVE OUR BUSINESS TOWARDS 
MORE RESILIENT SECTORS.
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT 2009 WILL BE CHALLENGING, 
BUT WE HAVE TAKEN POSITIVE ACTION TO REDUCE 
OUR COST BASE AND EXTERNAL FACTORS ARE LOOKING 
MORE ENCOURAGING.

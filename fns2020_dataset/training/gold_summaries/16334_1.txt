 The prime objective
The Board’s prime objective continues to
be to outperform the market in terms of
annual increases in shareholder value by
delivering above average increases in
earnings and by communicating effectively
with shareholders and the ﬁnancial
community. The Executive Team has the
responsibility for developing and
implementing the strategies and plans that
will deliver against this prime objective.
Ultra’s strategic framework
The strategic framework, pictured below, is
focused on ensuring that Ultra meets its
prime objective. This is achieved through
the strategies for growth which are
described on pages 8 and 9 allied with
the business model described on pages
12 to 17. Underpinning these are Ultra’s
strategic tenets described on pages 18
and 19 which help to shape and deﬁne
the values and behaviors embodied within
Ultra’s culture. Ultra’s culture is described
on pages 36 and 37.
Executing the strategies for growth
To increase Ultra’s portfolio of specialist
capabilities, the Group continues to invest
over 5% of revenue in internal
development. This investment is to
generate further specialist, differentiated
offerings in the niche market sectors
where customers preferentially focus their
expenditure. These activities are led by the
businesses and are robustly reviewed by
the Executive Team and the Board.
In parallel, Ultra continues to invest in
value adding acquisitions which bring
complementary, world-leading niche
technologies and market access to the
Group’s portfolio. In 2012, Ultra bought
three specialist businesses. In May the
Group acquired GigaSat, a UK company
that develops, manufactures, sells and
supports ﬁxed, mobile and transportable
satellite earth stations, or satcom
terminals. Their products and services are
provided to the military, government and
commercial markets around the world.
GigaSat is part of Ultra’s Tactical & Sonar
Systems division.
In June, Ultra acquired specialist UK cyber
security companies Barron McCann
Technology Limited and Barron McCann
Payments Limited (BeMac). BeMac provides
commercial-grade cryptographic and key
management services to the UK
Government, military, law enforcement
agencies and the ﬁnance sector. BeMac’s
proprietary products are accredited by
CESG/GCHQ, the UK government’s
national technical authority for secure
electronic communications. BeMac has
been integrated into Ultra’s AEP Networks
business to form a centre of excellence for
baseline and enhanced-grade cryptographic
and secure communication products and
services. This business is also part of Ultra’s
Tactical & Sonar Systems division.
In August the Group acquired RFI, a
specialist US electronic component
company that manufactures high-voltage,
power conversion sub-systems and a
variety of other products designed for
industrial, military and commercial
applications. RFI has been integrated into
Ultra’s EMS business and is a part of Ultra’s
Information & Power Systems division.

Rakesh Sharma, Chief Executive As a consequence of this continuous
investment, the Group’s 28 businesses now
cover more than 180 specialist capability
areas across Ultra’s core markets of
defence, security, transport and energy.
This broad diversity gives signiﬁcant
resilience to Ultra’s ﬁnancial performance
and drives the Group’s growth momentum.
Augmenting this wide diversity of capability
is Ultra’s constant determination to
broaden its customer base and to widen its
geographical footprint. Both of these
activities are carried out in a measured and
controlled manner with due consideration
of risk. New markets and geographical
sectors take time to enter and Ultra has
therefore made the strategic decision to
focus its resources in a prioritised number
of regions and sectors with high growth
potential. Ultra, as an independent,
non-threatening partner, is able to support
all of the main prime contractors and local
industry partners with its unique
capabilities and solutions. Ultra is therefore
well positioned to bring its specialised
equipment, systems and services to new
long-term platforms and programmes in
new markets and regions. Further details
on Ultra’s robust business model can be
found on pages 12 to 17.
Building and sustaining
long-term relationships
The ability to execute these strategies
successfully is entirely reliant upon the
Group’s employees. Ultra’s reputation as a
global leader in electronics and software
for defence, security, transport and energy
applications is built on the endeavours of
its exceptional employees and their ability
to develop long term value adding
relationships with customers. In the current
climate of changing market dynamics, it is
even more important that the Group
continues to differentiate itself through its
behaviours and attitudes. To support this
Ultra has developed a number of internal
initiatives and tools that help it gain a
better understanding of customers real
needs and hence improve its ability to offer
differentiated and comprehensive
solutions. One of these key initiatives is
LAUNCH: see page 36.
Underpinning all of Ultra’s behaviours is
a strong ethical policy that is mandatory
for all employees across the entire Group.
In addition to educating employees on
anti-bribery and corruption policies,
including gifts and hospitality practices, the
training also gives guidance on identifying
warning ﬂags to ensure potential issues are
raised immediately and can be dealt with
appropriately. In the period Ultra decided
not to pursue business in certain areas
where its ethical standards might be at risk.
Executing against the growth strategies,
shown above, requires consistency of
management focus and drive. The
continuity of Ultra’s management team
ensures that the expertise and experience
is retained to maintain growth momentum
in the Group. The members of the
Executive Team understand through
experience what makes Ultra different and
how to focus the Group’s businesses on
maintaining competitive advantage in the
various specialist market sectors in which
Ultra operates.
Summary
Early recognition of current changes in
market dynamics, coupled with Ultra’s
robust business model and inherent agility,
has enabled the Group to be positioned
for growth in these challenging times.
I am conﬁdent that Ultra is extremely well
placed to execute successfully the
strategies and plans to meet the Board’s
prime objective.

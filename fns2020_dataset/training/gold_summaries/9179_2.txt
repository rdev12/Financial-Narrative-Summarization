2005 has been a very exciting year when we
have laid the foundations for the future. Against
a very weak retailing environment in the UK,
we have returned Kleeneze Europe to growth. 
The acquisitions of I Want One of Those.com 
and Kitbag, the launch of eeZee tv and the
successful start to Kleeneze Europe’s continental
European expansion are major steps in creating
a European home shopping group.
The combination of our three retailing platforms 
of Catalogue Home Shopping, Internet Retailing
and Television Shopping with our core skills 
of consumer marketing, product sourcing 
and fulfilment, puts us in a strong position 
to accelerate growth.

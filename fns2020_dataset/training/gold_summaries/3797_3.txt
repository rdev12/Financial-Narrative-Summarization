 04 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2007
I am delighted to report a year of outstanding
progress against the commitments we have
given to improve returns to shareholders. 
The objective of the strategy we communicated
last year is to grow our business in a disciplined
way to deliver sustainable profit and growth.
This year represents an important first step in
delivering this strategy .
We remain firmly focused on developing 
our core foodservice business, in which we 
see continued strong long-term growth
opportunities in our chosen market sectors. 
Alongside this we are developing a range of
complementary support services, which we are
progressively bringing to market, prioritising
those sectors and countries where our ability
to provide both food and support services will
help us to develop our market. In particular,
we see a growing number of international
clients who are looking for a service partner
such as us who can deliver these services to
consistently high standards, globally .
The successful implementation of MAP has
given us the framework to manage the
business with the intensity necessary to drive
improved performance. MAP is now well-
established in the businesses. In the coming
year we will be taking further steps to embed
MAP even deeper into the organisation.
Our Group Chief Executive, Richard
Cousins, in his first full year in the role, 
has put in place a strong leadership team 
to lead the continued development and
implementation of our strategy , bringing in
competencies in areas such as marketing and
international clients to support the delivery 
of our objectives and to help drive value from
the combined strength of our global Group. 
I have continued the programme I initiated 
to improve corporate governance and
controls. Building on the progress we have
already made, our aim this year has been
reviewing and re-communicating Group
policies and practices, with processes and
training to ensure that these are received 
and understood. 
Over the last year we have further reviewed
our corporate social responsibility strategy
(‘CSR’) to ensure that we are addressing the
broader social and environmental issues in 
the way that we run our business. This
commitment is very much in evidence in 
our day-to-day operations, forming a firm
foundation to build on as we strive to
continuously improve our CSR journey . 
We have made good progress in the last year
and, going forward, I will continue to take 
the necessary steps to ensure that we set the
highest standards for corporate governance
and responsible business practice.

Delivering on our commitments
Our performance reflects a clear,
well-executed strategy , which is
starting to deliver increased value 
to our shareholders.
The introduction of MAP , our
Management and Performance
framework, has given us a common
language and agenda resulting in
greater focus and visibility across the
whole business. We have delivered a
step change in profit and free cash
flow generation as new processes
begin to embed throughout the
organisation. Looking ahead, we
believe we are entering a new phase
of sustainable value creation, with
exciting opportunities to grow
revenues, improve margins and
generate significant cash flow .

Returns to shareholders
The Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 7.2 pence per share for payment in 
March 2008. This brings our full year
dividend to 10.8 pence, a year on year
increase of 7%.
In July this year we completed the sale of
Selecta, the European vending business, 
for £772 million before transaction costs. 
Of these proceeds we are using £500 million
to extend our share buy-back programme.
This is in addition to the return of
£500 million to shareholders following 
the sale of SSP in 2006, taking the total share
buy-back programme to £1 billion. As of
30 September 2007 we had bought back
shares for cancellation to the value of
£720 million.
A further £45 million of the Selecta proceeds
have been contributed to Compass’ UK
closed defined benefit pension plans, taking
the total amount of special contributions 
to these plans over the past 15 months to
£325 million, significantly reducing the
pension deficit in these schemes.
The balance of the proceeds has been used 
to further reduce net debt. 
Management
On becoming Chairman I began the process
of reinvigorating the Board to achieve the
right blend of expertise, experience and
strong independent scrutiny to guide the
decisions of the Board over managing and
growing the business in the best interests of
our shareholders.
This has been achieved through an orderly
succession plan and without compromising
the effectiveness of the Board and its
committees.
Peter Blackburn, Peter Cawdron and Val
Gooding have all stepped down from the
Board in the last year and I would like to
thank each of them for the contribution 
they have made to the Group.
I am delighted that Sir Ian Robinson, Tim
Parker, Sir James Crosby and Susan Murray
joined the Board as non-executive directors
during the last 12 months, with Sir James
Crosby becoming the senior independent
non-executive director. Together with my
other colleagues on the Board, I look forward
to our new directors’ continued contribution
to the deliberations of the Board.
In June we appointed Mark White as the
Group’s General Counsel and Company
Secretary , a new role within the Group. 
Mark, a qualified solicitor, has extensive
international legal and business experience
and joined us from Wolseley plc. 
Our people
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank
all of our people around the world for their
commitment and efforts in achieving these
results and for the excellent service they
deliver daily; service that continues to earn
the loyalty of our clients and consumers and
reinforces our position as a leader in our
chosen markets.
Outlook 
The results that we have reported for 2007
demonstrate that we have the right strategy ,
the right leadership and, through MAP , the
right focus to capitalise on the considerable
opportunities that exist in our chosen markets.
I believe that these results and the actions 
we are taking give us a solid foundation on
which to base sustainable performance
improvements and deliver increasing value 
to our shareholders.

 Summary of 2005
The progress we made in 2004 has continued through
2005. Our Advertising and Marketing Services Division 
has started to deliver on our expectations with the very
successful acquisition of VCCP . Each of our three 
divisions has delivered double digit growth in operating
income and profit.
Our operating income grew by 21% from £52.1 million
to £63.0 million and our headline operating profit grew by
30% from £7.3 million to £9.5 million. Despite incurring
restructuring costs of £1.3 million in 2005, the statutory
profit before tax grew by 14% from £6.4 million to
£7.3 million.
Organic growth (excluding both acquisitions and disposals)
in operating income was 7% and 16% in operating profit.
Headline earnings per share grew by 32% from 2.2p per
share to 2.9p per share.
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 0.32p per
share, giving a total dividend per share of 0.48p compared
to 0.30p in 2004 – an increase of 60%.
Our net debt position at 31st December 2005 was
£3.0 million compared to £6.3 million at 31st December
2004.

Public Relations
Operating income for 2005 increased by 11% from

by 24% from £5.5 million to £6.8 million. Operating profit
margin increased from 15.2% in 2004 to 17.1% in 2005.
Bell Pottinger Sans Frontieres continued to be our most
successful business and expanded further its geopolitical
practice. Bell Pottinger Corporate and Financial, our
financial public relations firm, under its new Managing
Director Stephen Benzike has returned to growth and
reconfirmed itself in the top 10. Bell Pottinger Public Affairs
continued to be the number one public affairs consultancy.
Harvard and Insight grew beyond our expectations. Our
operations in Germany, the USA and Dubai all grew. The
downturn in consumer marketing had an effect on our
consumer brands.

DP World, Dubai Aerospace, Green Cross International,
Hero, GSK, Johnson and Johnson, Kimberley Clark,

Following the successful acquisition of VCCP , VCCP
management took over four existing Chime businesses,
Heresy, Rare Digital (now renamed VCCP Digital), Pure
Media and Gasoline. Heresy has been merged in to VCCP
and we have sold 76% of Rare Publishing which was a
loss-making business. Since acquisition, VCCP has entered
the top 20 advertising agencies in the UK.
Our specialist financial services business, Teamspirit,
and our specialist property business TTA, had strong
performances in 2005.

Exchange, Bank of England, Cancer Research UK,

to 1,012 in 2004. 124 clients paid us over £100,000

Major new client wins

In June 2005 we announced the acquisition of VCCP
Limited for an initial consideration of £14.5 million with
deferred consideration of up to £15.5 million.
Considerations, both initial and deferred, are satisfied one
half in cash and one half by the issue of new ordinary shares
in Chime. The initial cash consideration of £7.25 million was
satisfied partly by the issue of 20.4 million shares at 26p and
partly from within the Group’s own resources. Following the
transaction the VCCP Group has taken over the
management of four of Chime’s existing marketing services
businesses. Deferred consideration is payable based on the
pre-tax profit performance of the enlarged Group in the 6
years to 31st December 2010.
In July 2005 we acquired Baxter Hulme, a public relations
consultancy based in the north of England for an initial
consideration of £307,500 (£153,750 paid in cash and
£153,750 payable in shares subject to achieving the agreed
profit target for the year to 31st March 2006) with deferred
consideration payable of up to £692,500 dependent on
the pre-tax profits in the two years to 31st March 2008.
The acquisition has strengthened Bell Pottinger North, which
was launched in 2004.
In September 2005 we exercised our option to acquire
the remaining 60% of De Facto Communications. De Facto
is a leading healthcare and life science public relations
consultancy based in London and extends Chime’s
involvement in the important health sector. £182,706 was
paid on the exercise of the option with deferred
consideration of up to £1.8 million payable dependent
on the post-tax profits of De Facto for the four years to
31st December 2008.
On 31st December 2005 we sold the remaining 51%
of shares that we held in HHCL Group Limited to WPP
Group for £2.75 million. We also announced that we would
use some of the proceeds from the sale to begin a
programme to purchase Chime Ordinary Shares over the
next four years. 
In December we sold 76% of the shares of Rare
Publishing to PSP Communications Limited. The performance
of Rare Publishing has been disappointing and it is expected
that this will improve when it is part of a specialist
publishing group. Consideration of up to £382,000 will be
receivable based on the pre-tax profit performance to
31st December 2008.
In January we acquired 55% of Ledbury Research which
provides research and advice to brands and businesses
which market to high net worth consumers. The initial
market investment was £120,000 with further consideration
of up to 160,000 new Chime shares dependent on the two
vendors remaining with the Group and the pre-tax profit
performance over the next four years.
We announced on 1st February that we had cancelled the
warrants over 8,280,320 Ordinary Shares (3.3% of total
share capital) held by The Royal Bank of Scotland in return
for a payment of £800,000. The cancellation payment
equated to a share price of 0.34p. These warrants were
issued in September 2003 as part of our refinancing
arrangements at an exercise price of 24p and entitled The
Royal Bank of Scotland to subscribe for the shares at any
time up to 30th September 2006.
Corporate and Social Responsibilities
In July 2005 we issued our first Corporate Responsibility
Report which reviewed our practices relating to people,
clients, the communities in which we operate and the
natural environment. The report states our aim for the
year ahead.
We take Corporate and Social Responsibility seriously
and will continue to develop and improve our approach.
“Our Advertising and Marketing Services Division is
now achieving growth and profits ahead of our
expectation and there is market momentum in both
the Public Relations and Research Divisions.”

Retirement of Non-Executive Director
We are today announcing the retirement from the Board
of Alan Chamberlain. Alan has been associated with the
Group since 1989 both as a Director and a Consultant.
He has provided the board and management of Chime
with invaluable support and advice on corporate strategy,
acquisitions, finance and general management.
Alan will continue to act as a Consultant to the Group.
Outlook
Our Advertising and Marketing Services Division is now
achieving growth and profits ahead of our expectation and
there is market momentum in both the Public Relations and
Research Divisions. This is confirmed by the Group’s
performance for the first quarter of 2006 and we expect it to
be another successful year. 
We have recently agreed a three year forward strategy with
the Board. The highlights of this strategy are:
• To re-position Chime as the leading Modern
Communications Group.
• To continue our progress in margin enhancement with
a target of 18% within three years (currently 15.3%).
• To continue to reduce debt as well as implementing
a share buy back programme as appropriate within
market conditions.
• To increase the number of clients shared between more
than one company in the Group, both across the three
divisions and within each division.
• In new business to increase the average value of
our wins.
• To continue our productivity improvement by increasing
the average income per head.
• To continue our international expansion and grow the
share from its current level of 30% of operating income.
This expansion will come from the Public Affairs sector,
Corporate and Financial and Advertising and Marketing
Services. 
This strategy will be fulfilled by organic activities including
start-ups and possibly small strategic, non-dilutive
acquisitions.

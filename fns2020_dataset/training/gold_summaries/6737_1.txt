I am pleased to report another encouraging performance across the Group for the year ended 31
March 2009. Our efforts to concentrate on the core Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health
businesses have proved successful and have delivered Group revenues of £98.4 million, an increase
of 15.9% over 2008 (£84.9million) or 12.2% at constant exchange rates. Our proﬁt before tax and
exceptionals was £20.0 million (2008: £13.2 million), excluding a credit of £2.1 million in relation
to litigation costs (2008: charge of £0.3 million) and a £0.7 million non-cash impairment charge
(2008: £0.7 million). Earnings per share were 39.7 pence (2008: 16.9 pence). During the year,
the Group generated cash of £12.9 million from operating activities (2008: £4.8 million), and we
ﬁnished the year with £27.5 million of cash (2008: £19.2 million). I am delighted to report that
we have proposed to increase the ﬁnal dividend to 5.8 pence, which brings the total dividend to 8.7
pence (2008: 8.0 pence), an increase of 8.8%.
Our pharmaceuticals product portfolio has performed well with sales of £73.8 million (2008: £63.8
million) and operating proﬁt of £23.8 million (2008: £14.0 million) beneﬁting from a combination
of favourable product mix and operational efﬁciencies. Despite this encouraging performance, the
Pharmaceuticals business is facing increasing regulatory costs and pricing pressure on its branded
pharmaceuticals products sold to the NHS due to the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme. This
has a 3.9% price reduction effective as of February 2009 and further 1.9% price reduction as of
January 2010.
Sales from the Consumer Health business are up to £23.5 million (2008: £19.2 million) reﬂecting,
in particular, a strong performance by our two leading weight management products: Lipobind and
Appesat. However, the Consumer Health business incurred an operating loss of £4.7 million (2008:
loss of £1.6 million) due to a challenging market environment and increased investment in brand
building. The product lines have been rationalised, a number of non-core product areas have been
closed and the division has been restructured, resulting in non-recurring costs last year in the region
of £1 million. While we believe that this division has good long term prospects, especially in weight
management and joints & mobility, further work is required to build a sustainable business and we
expect the division to continue to be loss-making in the current ﬁnancial year.
Our decision to restructure our US business by strengthening the direct sales has shown encouraging
performance. It is our intention to operate in our core markets - Europe and North America - and
invest in new products and our marketing capabilities.
During the year we have made major efforts to improve efﬁciency with a rationalisation of our
product base and a review and reorganisation of processes to strengthen our operational platform.
In line with this, we are implementing SAP business management systems. I expect the majority of
systems and processes integration to be complete by the end of the calendar year.
We have made signiﬁcant progress in strengthening our senior management in the areas of quality,
regulatory, technical and medical affairs which will greatly assist us in supporting and growing our
product-focused business. As already mentioned in the Chairman’s report I am pleased to welcome
Kirti Patel back to the Group Board. He will be a valuable addition to the Group.
A detailed business review is provided on pages 11 to 13 in the Report of the Directors.
This is an exciting period for the Group. We remain committed to the development of lifestyle
consumer health brands and the introduction of new pharmaceutical products. Our strong balance
sheet allows us to be conﬁdent of weathering the economic downturn and our cash ﬂow and cash
reserves facilitate our commitment to grow the business. We intend to use our resources to invest

in new product introductions via development, in-licensing and acquisitions together with building
brands. Long term sustainable growth is an area that is at the forefront of our objectives and I am
conﬁdent we can maximise value for our shareholders.
The past year has been one of a major change for the Group and I would like to extend my gratitude
to the entire staff at Goldshield for their hard work and commitment.

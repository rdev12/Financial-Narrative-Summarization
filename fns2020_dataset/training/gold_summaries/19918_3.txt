Corporate governance report
Letter from the Chairman
Quick facts
•	 The Chairman met the 
independence criteria as set 
out in the 2012 UK Corporate 
Code (the Code) when he was 
appointed as Chairman
•	 The Code requires that at least 
half of the board is made up 
of independent non-executive 
directors (the test excludes the 
Chairman). At United Utilities, 
five out of the remaining 
seven directors (excluding the 
Chairman) are independent non-
executive directors
•	 The company secretary attends 
all board and committee 
meetings and advises the 
Chairman on governance 
matters. The company 
secretariat team provides 
administrative support
•	 All directors are subject to 
annual election at the AGM 
held in July. Following the 
completion of the annual 
evaluation process all the 
non-executive directors were 
considered by the board to 
be independent and making 
a valuable and effective 
contribution to the board. As a 
result, the board recommends 
that shareholders vote in favour 
of those standing for a further 
term at the forthcoming AGM

Our intention is to hand 
over the business to our 
successors in a better and 
more sustainable position for 
the future
Dear shareholder,
Our year
The focus of the board has been 
in the planning for United Utilities 
Water’s (UUW’s) next five-year 
regulatory period for 2015 to 2020, 
and endeavouring to ensure the long-
term success of the company and the 
group for that period and beyond. The 
board has concentrated on pursuing 
the company’s continuing strategy to 
provide the best service to customers, 
at the lowest sustainable cost and in a 
responsible manner, and in meeting the 
challenges of the financial year ended 
31 March 2015. 
Having the same directors on both 
the UUG and UUW boards (with the 
addition of Steven Fraser, managing 
director of UUW’s Wholesale business, 
on the UUW board) reflects our vision 
which is to focus on our core water and 
wastewater business and become a 
leading North West service provider. 
So, whilst both the UUG and UUW 
boards’ agendas have been dominated 
by the next regulatory period, the UUG 
board has also been addressing the 
strategic and directional challenges of 
the group. Our governance processes 
also address Ofwat’s published 
principles on board leadership, 
transparency and governance, and our 
statement can be found on our website 
at corporate.unitedutilities.com/
corporate-governance
We have achieved considerable 
progress against our strategy, 
particularly in customer service, 
although this is still a primary 
area of focus for the board. The 
implementation of our new operating

model for our wholesale business 
employing new technology and new 
work processes will support us in 
achieving this target. The board iss 
determined to maintain the rate of 
progress that has been achieved to 
date as we enter the next five-year 
period. 
In January 2015, the UUW board met 
to consider the best course of action 
in terms of accepting or rejecting 
Ofwat’s 2015–20 final determination. 
The board concluded that, although 
this was a challenging price control, 
we have plans in place to maintain and 
improve services for customers and 
provide an appropriate return for our 
investors. 
Our approach
As individual directors we are 
cognisant of our statutory duties and 
in particular to promote the long-term 
success of our company. Our role as 
the board is to set the strategy of 
the group, and ensure its long-term 
success and create shareholder value. 
Our intention as directors is to hand 
over the business to our successors 
in a better and more sustainable 
position for the future. Information on 
our vision and strategy and the way in 
which we create value is included in the 
strategic report on pages 4 to 55.
Our governance structure
We held eight scheduled board 
meetings during the year, which 
were attended by all directors. 
There were also a number of ad hoc 
board meetings held which directors 
attended either in person or via 
telephone conferencing facilities, 
a number of which related to the 
board’s involvement in the price 
review process. A diagram showing 
the inter-relationships of the various 
board committees can be found on 
page 64, and reports from each of the 
committee chairs about their work 
can be found on the following pages. 
The diagram also describes some of 
the group’s principal management 
committees. 
Our people
Nick Salmon retired as a director at 
the AGM  on 25 July 2014 and at that 
time Mark Clare replaced him as senior 
independent director. We welcomed 
Stephen Carter to the board as an 
independent non-executive director 
and member of the audit committee 
on 1 September 2014.  On Stephen’s 
appointment, Mark Clare stepped 
down from the audit committee and 
was appointed as a member of the 
remuneration committee. 
Stephen brings to the board table 
a strong career in government and 
regulation, having held a number of 
public sector roles, including serving 
a term as the founding chief executive 
of Ofcom. He is currently group chief 
executive at Informa plc, a FTSE 250 
listed company. Further information on 
the process for Stephen’s appointment 
can be found in the report of the 
nomination committee on pages 68 to 
72.
We have maintained our target of 
at least 25 per cent of our board 
comprising of women, and in terms 
of diversity of experience, skills and 
personal attributes, we have great 
diversity around our board. Good 
board dynamics are vital to the proper 
interaction and working of a board 
of directors. Board directors need to 
work together effectively for the good 
of the company and, in short, they 
need to get on with each other; clashes 
of personality are to be avoided as 
they do not facilitate constructive 
debate and challenge and effective 
communication. 
Collectively, the directors have many 
years of experience gained across 
a variety of areas and industries. 
Some have spent part of their careers 
overseas, and whilst there is a huge 
diversity in their skills and experience, 
they have predominantly worked in 
regulated industries, as is appropriate.  
Around our board table, I believe we 
have individuals who will apply their 
skills and experience to the benefit 
of our business and speak up if they 
disagree but, equally, listen to the 
views of others. 
The focus of the group 
has been in the planning 
for UUW’s next five-
year regulatory period 
for 2015 to 2020 and 
endeavouring to ensure 
the long-term success 
of the company and the 
group for that period and 
beyond.

Corporate governance report
Letter from the Chairman
Although there are time constraints 
for non-executive directors who 
also have an executive role, these 
individuals bring valuable current 
market experience to any board table. 
Similarly, we encourage our executive 
directors to serve as a non-executive 
director elsewhere to help broaden 
their experience, although this is 
restricted to one other directorship in 
a company which does not conflict with 
United Utilities’ business.
Our CEO, Steve Mogford, has made 
some changes during the year to the 
structure of his executive team of 
senior managers. This has resulted in a 
change of reporting lines and a related 
change in the male:female ratios of the 
executive team (excluding the CEO and 
CFO) of 4:3, (2014: 5:5). 
Our ethos and culture
One of our key core values, both at 
board level and as a company, is to 
act with integrity, by applying the 
highest standards of responsible 
business practice. The company has 
complied with the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code in accordance with 
the FCA ’s Listing Rules with which we 
were required to comply for the year 
ended 31 March 2015. For the period 
from 25 July 2014 (on the retirement 
of Nick Salmon) until 1 September 
2014 (on the appointment of 
Stephen Carter), there were only two 
independent non-executives directors 
appointed to the remuneration 
committee,  notwithstanding the 
fact that the Code requires that 
three independent non-executive 
directors be appointed. During this 
time no meetings of the remuneration 
committee were scheduled or held and 
as a result we do not regard this as 
being an incident of non-compliance 
with the Code.   
Our approach to risk
We adopt a prudent approach to 
the way we manage the risks to our 
business; we feel this is appropriate 
for an organisation such as ours 
that provides a vital service to 
its customers, and is an approach 
that permeates the culture of our 
business. That being said, we are a 
commercial organisation operating 
within a regulated framework, and 
accepting some level of risk is a 
normal consequence of doing business. 
It is the board’s and the executive 
team’s role to understand the risks 
associated with each activity of the 
business and that actions are taken 
to mitigate these risks as they feel 
appropriate. The greatest risk to our 
business is ensuring that we get the 
constituent elements of our five-yearly 
business plans correct to ensure our 
financeability, and that they are agreed 
by Ofwat in its final determination, as 
we are bound by these plans for the 
following five-year period with limited 
opportunity to change them. 
Our investors
The remuneration committee, under 
Sara Weller’s leadership, has been 
instrumental in updating the executive 
directors’ remuneration packages to 
ensure they align the directors’ and 
senior managers’ interests with the 
long-term interests of the company 
and its shareholders. At the time the 
changes were introduced in 2013, 
the committee went to considerable 
effort to consult on the changes with 
a number of the company’s large 
investors. At the 2014 AGM, 98.48 
per cent of the vote was in favour of 
the directors’ remuneration policy and, 
although only an advisory vote, 99.39 
per cent of the votes cast were in 
favour of the directors’ remuneration 
report, which would suggest that our 
investors are comfortable with our 
approach to reward.
We welcome any feedback you may 
have on this annual report -

Governance structure for  
our board and our committees 
In line with the Code, the board delegates 
certain roles and responsibilities to its 
various principal board committees, as 
shown in the diagram  on page 64. Whilst 
the board retains overall responsibility, 
a sub-committee structure allows 
these committees to probe the subject 
matter more deeply and gain a greater 
understanding of the detail, and then 
report back to the board on the matters 
discussed. The reports of the principal 
board committees required by the Code 
can be found on the subsequent pages. 
Minutes of the board and principal 
committee meetings (with the exception 
of the remuneration committee) are 
tabled at board meetings and the chairs 
of each of the board committees verbally 
report to the board on their activities.
The executive team is chaired by the 
CEO, and its members are the senior 
managers who have a direct reporting 
line to the CEO. The executive team 
meets monthly and  is responsible for 
operational matters and implementing 
the strategies that the board has set, and 
the day-to-day running of the business. 
Short biographies of the executive 
team can be found on our website at 
corporate.unitedutilities.com/united-
utilities-executive-team
The structure chart shown on page 64 
also shows the principal management 
committees and a brief description of 
their roles. These committees enable 
senior management to understand and, 
if necessary, challenge the business in 
its interpretation of the implementation 
of the strategies the board has set. The 
board received reports from the CEO and 
CFO at every scheduled board meeting, 
providing the board with an updated 
overview of the business and its financial 
position. 
•	 The board is responsible for 
setting the strategy of the 
group and ensuring the long-
term success of the group for 
customers, investors and wider 
stakeholders; and in creating

Attendance at board and 
committee meetings
Eight scheduled board meetings were 
planned and held during the year 
(2014: eight). A number of other board 
meetings and telephone conferences 
were also held during the year, as the 
need arose. The table below shows 
the actual number of scheduled 
meetings attended and the maximum 
number of scheduled meetings which 
the directors could have attended.
As directors, our intention is always 
to attend all scheduled board 
and committee meetings; only in 
exceptional circumstances would we 
not do so. Similarly, every effort is 
made to attend ad hoc meetings either 
in person or via the use of video or 
telephone conferencing facilities if 
needs be. None of our non-executive 
directors have raised concerns over 
the time commitment required of them 
to fulfil their duties. 
On the evening before each scheduled 
board meeting all the non-executive 
directors meet together with the CEO; 
this time is usefully spent enabling us 
to share views and cross-check our 
understanding of certain issues.

Board evaluation
We engaged Lintstock Consultants 
(Lintstock) to undertake our external 
evaluation; they also conducted the 
external evaluation in 2012. Other 
than conducting the 2012 evaluation, 
Lintstock had no other connection with 
the company.
The process, facilitated and evaluated 
by Lintstock, was based on the 
completion of online questionnaires 
by board members addressing the 
performance of the board and its 
committees, the Chairman and 
individual directors.
In addition to board members, other 
members of the executive team 
who regularly attend and support 
committee meetings were asked to 
complete the same questionnaires. 
The anonymity of all respondents was 
ensured throughout the process in 
order to encourage an open and frank 
exchange of views. The results were 
then analysed by Lintstock;  were 
then discussed with the Chairman, 
the chair of the relevant committee, 
and the company secretary; tabled at 
a meeting of the relevant committee; 
and then presented to the board.

A summary of Lintstock’s analysis of the 2014/15 evaluation is as follows:
Board composition and 
expertise
Board members’ skills and expertise were felt to be appropriate, and in particular the 
board members’ knowledge and understanding of the regulatory environment the company 
operates within, along with their understanding of the views of regulators, customers and 
investors.
Board agenda The allocation of time spent on the key strategic issues of the price review during the year 
was appropriate as were the other topics devoted to board discussion. With the completion 
of the price review, more time could now be allocated to address the advent of further 
market reform and competition in the sector.
Board support Presentations to the board and the timeliness of board documentation were appropriate, 
although improvements could be made to the content and format of papers. The support 
and training needs of board members continued to be addressed.
Wider strategic oversight The involvement of the board in the development of the strategic direction of the group was 
considered to be appropriate. The board would consider what improvements could be made 
to the format of the board strategy day.
Risk management and 
internal control
The board’s approach to the management of risk was considered to be appropriate, with 
suggestions being made to refine the management and oversight of risk overall.
Succession planning and 
human resource management
Board members felt that the senior management structure and the succession planning for 
executive and key management positions supported the strategic objectives. The visibility 
by the board of potential internal candidates for succession should be maintained and 
enhanced.
Committees The composition and performance of the audit, remuneration, nomination, corporate 
responsibility and treasury committees were considered to be appropriate.
Individual directors The individual performance of the directors was assessed; all of which were considered to 
be effective and all directors demonstrated the expected level of commitment to the role. 
The review of the Chairman’s performance, led by the senior independent director and that 
of Catherine Bell concluded that both continued to demonstrate an independent approach, 
notwithstanding they had each served in excess of six years as a director.
The internal evaluation conducted in 2013/14 identified the following actions:
•	 There was a need to improve further the visibility and engagement of the executive team and a wide range of senior 
managers with the board and provide more opportunities for such engagement; and
•	 Maintain the strong focus on succession planning for executives and those in critical posts in the talent pipeline.
Whilst progress has undoubtedly been made during the year, these are enduring themes which will continue to be pursued.
Training
Specific training has been provided to the directors during the year on a number of areas including regulatory matters

Wide range of betting and gaming products
William Hill’s 2,300 shops make up around a 
quarter of the UK Licenced Betting Office (LBO) 
market. In our shops, we provide customers with 
access to real-time sports information and live 
race or match coverage via satellite on our  
multi-screen television system. While horse racing  
is still a popular betting product, we now offer 
odds on an extensive range of sports, including 
football, golf and cricket. Customers can also play 
roulette, blackjack and other games on machines, 
which account for around one third of total gross 
win from our shops.  03

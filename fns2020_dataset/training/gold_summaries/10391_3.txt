Chairman’s statement
We are delighted to announce that 
MITIE has delivered another year of 
double-digit earnings growth, against 
a backdrop of unprecedented market
conditions. Revenues have grown by
8.2% to £1,521.9m, operating profit before
amortisation* (EBITA) by 11.5 % to £80.5m
and cash conversion stands at 97.5%. 
This result is particularly pleasing in a year
where economic conditions have been
extremely challenging and demonstrates
the resilience of the MITIE business, 
which is well diversified in terms of its 
client base and market sector exposure. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to deliver stakeholder value
through a focus on sustainable profitable
growth. To achieve this we have to
anticipate changes in our markets and
react quickly. Currently our clients are
increasing levels of outsourcing and seeking
supply chain efficiencies through larger
integrated contracts. In response to 
our clients’ changing needs, we have
improved our operating structure, invested
in additional specialist resources and while 
we are experiencing slowing in some areas,
we are seeing record levels of opportunity
and are securing many exciting long-term
integrated contracts.
Acquisitions remain a key part of our
strategy. With no gearing at the year end,
we are extremely well positioned to take
advantage of value creating opportunities.
We look for quality companies with strong
management teams that complement or
fit within our existing business and operate 
in growth markets.
Results
Our performance during the year, 
saw revenues grow by 8.2% to £1,521.9m
(2008: £1 ,407 .2m) . Operating profit before
amortisation* (EBITA) increased by 11.5% to
£80.5m (2008: £72.2m), reflecting an enhanced
margin of 5.3% (2008: 5.1%) with profit before
tax rising by 11.8% to £75.9m (2008: £67.9m).
Adjusted earnings per share grew by 15.4% 
to 17.2p per share (2008: 14.9p per share). 
The business remains very cash generative
and has reported a cash inflow from
operations of £94.4m (2008: £78.2m) for the
year, which represented cash conversion 
of 97.5% (2008: 90.3%). The balance sheet 
is extremely strong with net funds at the year
end of £10.9m (2008: net debt £15.6m). 
We have secured bank facilities of £230.0m,
which are in place to January 2012, of which
£10.0m was utilised at the year end. This leaves
the Group well positioned to take advantage
of acquisition opportunities as they arise.
We are pleased to report growth of 11.4% in
our order book during the year, which now
stands at an impressive £4.9bn (2008: £4.4bn).
Dividend
On the basis of our strong performance
during the year and our solid prospects for
the future, the Board is recommending an
increased final dividend of 3.6p per Ordinary
share adding up to a total dividend per
share for the year of 6.9p, a 15.0% increase
on 2008 in line with our dividend policy to
maintain dividends in line with underlying
earnings growth at a cover ratio of 2.5 times
adjusted earnings. Subject to shareholder
approval at the Annual General Meeting,
the dividend will be paid on 7 August 2009 to
shareholders on the register at 10 July 2009.
Main Board
There were a number of changes to the
Board during the year. David Ord and
Cullum McAlpine both retired from the
Board on 31 July 2008. As a result, I was
appointed Non-Executive Chairman and
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
and David Jenkins was appointed Senior
Independent Director and Chairman of the
Audit Committee. The Board is extremely
grateful for the leadership and valuable
contributions from David and Cullum during
their six years on the Board and wish them
every success in the future.
We are delighted that Terry Morgan has
agreed to join the Board on 1 July 2009 as a
Non-Executive Director. He will, immediately
following the conclusion of the AGM on the
10 July 2009, assume the role of Chairman
of the Remuneration Committee from
Ishbel Macpherson. Terry is currently Chief
Executive of Tube Lines and will become
Chairman of Crossrail later this year. 
Terry has extensive experience of change,
strategy and operations across a number 
of large, complex organisations and he will
make a valuable contribution to our Board.
People
Since becoming Chairman, I have been
extremely impressed by the strength, 
depth and positive attitude of the MITIE
team. As part of my induction programme,
I visited all of our divisions and the quality 
of our people is self-evident.
The effective day-to-day management 
of our business is critical. It requires the skill
and expertise that comes only with hard
work, commitment and experience. 
MITIE’s financial results and strength have
only been possible due to the hard work 
of its people, whose expertise and
dedication remain our most important
assets. We would therefore like to thank
them all for their contribution to another
excellent set of results.
Outlook
We have entered the new financial year 
in a positive position, with a strong order
book and bid pipeline, committed banking
facilities and no debt. 
We recognise the economic challenges
that are facing our own business and that
of our clients, but see continued opportunities
for sustainable profitable growth for MITIE
through our ability to enhance efficiency 
in extended scope outsourced solutions
and the introduction of innovation in asset
management for our clients. We look forward
to another good year of growth for MITIE.

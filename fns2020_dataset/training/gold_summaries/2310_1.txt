Booker Group plc
annual report & accounts 2011
Booker made good progress in 2010/11 
and our plan to ‘focus, Drive and Broaden’ 
the business is on track. Bryn satherley 
and his team continue to ‘focus’ Booker. 
Guy farrant has joined to ‘Drive’ the core 
cash & carry business and Mark aylwin 
is ‘Broadening’ Booker into delivered 
wholesale. after five years Bryan Drew has 
moved on to pursue his entrepreneurial 
interests. We are very grateful for Bryan’s 
contribution and i am pleased that the new 
team has settled in well.
FOCUS  
(commenced November 2005)
through tight control of cash and costs, 
Booker seeks to ‘focus’ on becoming the 
most efficient operator in our sector. thanks 
to the hard work of many colleagues we 
have improved business efficiency and 
cash generation. We seek to ‘stop, simplify 
and standardise’ work, with most of the 
savings being invested in customer service. 
through tight cash management we now 
have net cash of £27.1m.
DRIVE  
(commenced March 2006)
Booker serves 444,000 customers in the 
uK via the core cash and carry business. 
We continue to ‘Drive’ choice, price and 
service and each year we survey 40,000 
customers to identify where improvements 
can be made. customers say we have 
done a better job this year and our 
customer count has increased again, up 
by 13,000 customers.
Choice Up
•	 partly due to Guy farrant’s expertise 
in this area, our fresh departments 
have significantly improved. sales of 
fruit and vegetables are up 53%. We 
are confident that our fresh business 
will continue to power ahead in the 
next few years.
•	 in 2007 we launched euro shopper as 
an entry price brand for independent 
retailers. it now has sales of £56m at 
wholesale prices up from £44m last 
year. We have just launched a euro 
shopper Water, sugar and cola which 
are performing well.
•	 chef’s larder is our own label brand 
for caterers. its sales were £156m, 
up 5% on prior year. During the 
year we improved chef’s larder’s 
credentials through the reformulation 
and repackaging of 30 lines. We will 
continue to drive chef’s larder in the 
year ahead.
Prices Down
•	 ours is a very price competitive 
market. Booker surveys prices against 
our competition each week. During 
the year our price index remained 
competitive and this has been noticed 
by customers. We expect pricing to 
become even more important as the 
economy remains challenging and 
commodity prices become more 
volatile. During the year we ‘rolled back’ 
prices on 850 lines and expanded euro 
shopper and Booker Basics, our value 
brands. We expect to build on these 
actions in the year ahead.
Better Service
•	 s tock availability was the best we have 
achieved in five years.
•	 our people are doing a brilliant job. 
in spite of the terrible weather at 
christmas, our colleagues kept the 
business going.
•	 i am pleased that 77% of eligible 
business centre colleagues achieved the 
customer satisfaction bonus last year.
Catering
•	 catering sales grew by 6.3% to £1.1bn, 
because our choice, price and service 
for caterers made excellent progress. 
our catering development sales 
force continues to serve our existing 
customers and to introduce new 
customers to Booker. During the year 
the catering customer count increased 
by 13,000.

grew by 10%. the estate grew to 
2,600 stores. the retail development 
team put a lot of work into compliance 
and building the sales and profits 
of existing premier stores. this has 
worked and premier was awarded 
symbol Group of the Year 2010 at 
the retail industry a wards.
BROADEN  
(commenced April 2007)
in the uK, Booker seeks to offer the best 
choice, price and service to caterers and 
retailers and to become the suppliers’ 
preferred route to market. We also want 
to sell new products and services and 
reach new customers. in india we seek 
to become the best supplier to Kirana 
stores. t o achieve these objectives, we 
are ‘Broadening’ the business. ‘Broaden’ 
includes:
Improving the cash and carry 
business centre experience
•	 We have now converted 115 of our 
172 business centres to the ‘extra’ 
format. this features a lighter, 
brighter business centre environment 
and an improved choice, price and 
service. the conversion pays back in 
around a year and we plan to convert 
a further 20 business centres to 
‘extra’ in the year ahead.
harnessing the Internet
•	 sales on booker.co.uk were £526m, 
up from £407m last year and £15m 
in 2005. all these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. t he 
number of customers using the site 
has doubled in the last year as we 
improved online functionality for all 
our customers.
Booker Direct/ritter- 
Courivaud/Classic
•	 in 2007 Booker acquired Blueheath, 
a delivered wholesale business. Mark 
aylwin (the former chief executive 
of Blueheath) and his team have 
successfully converted Blueheath into 
Booker Direct, winning some great 
customers including the prison service 
in england and Wales, supplying 
branded foods to Marks & spencer 
and serving most of the uK’s cinema 
chains. We seek to offer solutions for 
customers which they cannot obtain 
elsewhere and help our suppliers 
develop profitable routes to market. 
in october 2010 we improved our 
delivered wholesale capabilities with 
the acquisitions of ritter-courivaud 
(‘ritter’) and classic.
•	 r itter is a leading speciality food 
supplier to restaurants. it has a 
fantastic food expertise and supplies 
many of the best restaurants in the 
uK. We have taken some of the 
ritter range into Booker and are in 
the process of extending the ritter 
national coverage through using 
Booker cash and carry business 
centre space. ritter and Booker are 
starting to serve national accounts 
with a choice, price and service they 
cannot obtain from other suppliers.
•	 classic is an on-trade wholesaler 
supplying pubs and licensed 
customers mainly in the north West. 
We are taking some of the classic 
range into Booker and have saved 
rental costs by moving some classic 
warehouses into a neighbouring 
Booker business centre. We believe 
that in the next three years classic/
Booker can become a new force 
in the uK on-trade sector, offering 
a low risk, low cost, high service, 
local solution.

•	 in the last year Booker Group delivered 
£930m of product to retailers and 
caterers in the uK. With the inclusion 
of ritter we can become a major force 
in foodservice and with classic we can 
become a significant player in on-trade.
Booker India 
•	 in september 2009 we opened our 
first business centre in Mumbai. We 
now have 7,000 customers and the 
customer reaction has been excellent. 
We have also launched 31 Happy 
shopper symbol retailers which harness 
the lessons from premier in the uK for 
the Kirana stores of Mumbai. We are 
in the process of opening our second 
business centre in Mumbai and our first 
joint venture business centre in pune. 
our partner in pune is satnam arora, 
who has expertise which compliments 
our own. We look forward to developing 
the Booker offer into other cities to 
become the best choice, price and 
service supplier to Kirana stores and 
caterers. 
Sustainability
•	 We want to improve our carbon 
efficiency. in 2008 Booker was the first 
uK food wholesaler to be awarded the 
carbon t rust standard. since then we 
have made good progress. We have 
recycled 4m litres of used cooking oil 
from our catering customers. this is 
used to power our distribution centre 
in Hatfield. We have sent 7% less to 
landfill, in spite of increasing sales by 
6.2%, and we are now trialling recycling 
centres in thirteen business centres. 
through better distribution fleet 
management we cut emissions of co2 
by 244 tonnes, new lighting systems 
saved 2,000 tonnes and with better 
waste management we saved 1,000 
tonnes. We can see opportunities to 
help our customers reduce waste and 
become more carbon efficient.
•	 We also look at sustainability in 
another way. Booker is privileged to 
serve 459,000 small and medium 
sized enterprises. independent pubs, 
caterers, nursing homes, convenience 
shops and the other customers we serve 
are crucial to their local communities. 
if we can help our customers thrive, 
we can also contribute to sustaining 
communities and neighbourhoods in 
Britain and in india.
People
•	 the progress at Booker has been 
achieved by our great team of 
people. During the terrible weather 
at christmas numerous Booker 
people worked harder than ever to 
keep the business centres trading, 
the wagons running and the supplies 
moving. However, for the other 50 
weeks of the year our people also 
did a heroic job. i am pleased that 
we continue to train all business 
centre colleagues under our priDe 
programme that boosts skills. f or the 
fifth year running, the performance of 
the business means our people have 
enjoyed in our success through our 
bonus system. With this great team of 
people Booker will continue to make 
progress in the year ahead.
in summary, Booker made good progress 
in 2010/11 and our plan to focus, Drive 
and Broaden the business is on track. 
c ustomer satisfaction improved further, 
we served 28,000 more customers and 
grew sales by over £200m. internet sales 
were £526m, ritter and classic have 
made a real contribution to the Group 
and we are pleased with the performance 
of Booker india. the uK economy looks 
challenging, but we are committed to 
helping our 459,000 customers prosper 
in the year ahead.

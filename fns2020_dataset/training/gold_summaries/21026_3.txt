 4 ASHMORE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Chairman’s Statement 
A review of the Group’s financial and
operational highlights demonstrate a
year of excellent progress. The profit
before tax was £196.2 million against
£131.4 million for the previous year ,
an increase of 49%. These results are
highly satisfactory , particularly as they
have been achieved against a
background of extreme volatility in the
global financial markets.
The Group’s core capabilities of
product innovation, asset raising,
delivering good investment performance
and excellent client service have again
continued to be demonstrated. During
this period we have worked extensively
on building a stronger infrastructure
platform for the further development of
the business going forward. In addition,
in line with our strategy , we are
beginning to develop a local asset
management presence on the ground in
a number of the key emerging markets
in which we participate to enable the
Group to benefit from the development
of these markets. All of these areas will
be expanded upon further in the Chief
Executive Officer’s Statement and
Business Review that follows.
Recognising the continued strong
progress and our confidence in the
Group’s prospects, the directors are
recommending a final dividend of 8.34p
for the year ended 30 June 2008 and,
subject to shareholder approval, this will
be paid on 5 December 2008 to all
shareholders who are on the register on
7 November 2008. This makes a total
dividend of 12.0p for the year (2007:
9.0p) an increase on last year of 33%.
We were delighted to welcome Graeme
Dell to the Board in December as
Group Finance Director . Graeme has
brought with him significant listed
company experience and has made an
immediate contribution to the Board and
its governance processes. Additionally
we were pleased that Jonathan Asquith
joined our Board on 1 September 2008
as an independent non-executive
director . Jonathan has a wealth of
experience in our industry having been
Vice Chairman and Chief Financial
Officer at Schroders plc and has also
held a number of senior positions in the
investment banking sector . I have no
doubt that he will be a considerable
asset to our Board. The Group expects
to further strengthen the Board by the
appointment of additional non-executive
directors and continues to be actively
engaged in this process. Jon Moulton,
who has served on our Board since
1999, will retire and not seek re-election
at the AGM and on behalf of the Board
I would like to express our gratitude for
his service and counsel over this period.
To build a first class asset manager
requires a team of the highest calibre
committed to delivering consistently
good investment performance and client
service. This year’s results confirm my
belief that Ashmore has such a team.
In addition, the Group’s strategic
position, focusing exclusively on
emerging markets combined with the
team’s long history of managing these
assets through many periods of
extreme market volatility , represents a
significant opportunity . Whilst the
markets may present further challenges
I am confident that the Group is ready
to meet them and to deliver on its
strategy .

Chairman’s statement
Delivering performance
This has been another year of excellent 
progress for the Group, delivering 
significantly improved financial returns, a 
consistently strong operating performance 
and continuing to invest in a disciplined 
way to underpin future growth. 
It has also been a year of Board changes 
for us, successfully managing the 
succession of David Thomas as our new 
Chief Executive, and the appointment 
of Neil Cooper as Chief Financial 
Officer Designate. 
The market for new homes remains 
strong across Britain, with demand 
continuing to exceed supply. The mortgage 
market has continued to improve both 
in terms of availability and rates, as well 
as Government support for the new 
build market. 
Against this strong market backdrop we 
are delivering ongoing improvements in 
our own performance across all aspects of 
our operations. 
We continue to focus on a rapid asset turn 
business model that is successfully driving 
up returns. 
Our production capability was underlined 
as we increased completions by 11% to 
16,447 during the year, overcoming a 
number of well publicised housing market 
challenges, particularly labour shortages. 
The fact that we delivered our highest 
completion volumes for seven years whilst 
continuing to lead the industry in terms of 
quality and customer service standards, is 
a great testament to the resilience of our 
operating model, our build programme 
and the dedication of our people. 
For the sixth consecutive year over 90% of 
our home buyers would recommend us to 
a friend – an outstanding achievement. 
As a result of the excellent operating 
performance, we were able to increase 
profit before tax by 45% and we finished 
the year with a net cash balance of 
£186.5m. We are well on the way to hitting 
our FY17 targets of a gross margin of at 
least 20%, and a ROCE of at least 25%.

Investing for the future
At the same time as delivering an excellent 
financial performance, we have continued 
to invest for the future. The land market 
has remained attractive in all regions and 
during the year we approved £957m of 
operational land commitments for 16,956 
plots. All of our land approvals continue 
to meet or exceed our investment hurdle 
rates of a 20% gross margin and a 25% 
site ROCE.
During the year we have also made good 
progress in securing a stronger pipeline  
of longer term strategic land. 
Promoting housebuilding
The UK Government recognises the 
importance of additional housing as a 
public policy objective. 
Help to Buy (Equity Loan) in England 
will be continued through to 2020 which 
provides good visibility in terms of our land 
investment strategy. The Government has 
increased it’s land release programme and 
measures to improve the planning system 
are being systematically implemented. 
We will continue to work with the 
Government on their Starter Home 
Scheme that is aimed at supporting 
200,000 homes over the next five years. 
By building more homes we are not only 
helping to address the housing shortage 
but also generating substantial economic 
activity. During the year we estimate that 
we supported 53,000 jobs either directly, 
indirectly or induced. 
Improving returns for our shareholders
The Board is pleased to propose a final 
dividend of 10.3 pence per share (2014: 7.1 
pence per share). Under our Capital Return 
Plan, special cash payments are proposed 
in addition to ordinary dividends with the 
first special cash payment of £100m to be 
paid in November 2015, which equates to 
10.0 pence per share. 
The total proposed capital return for the 
year is therefore 25.1 pence per share 
(2014: 10.3 pence per share).  
Our employees
The outstanding progress made during 
the year would not have been possible 
without the capability and dedication of 
our employees. 
I am delighted that so many of our team 
now share in our success through our 
Share Save scheme. 
Our site managers were awarded 81 NHBC 
Pride in the Job Awards. This is the 11th 
year in succession that we have secured 
more Pride in the Job Awards than any 
other housebuilder. 
We are also reliant for our success on 
over 12,000 subcontractors and suppliers. 
However , a shortage of high quality, skilled 
labour continues to test the industry and 
limit its output. We remain committed to 
investing in the skills and capability of our own 
employees and working with the industry, 
particularly our subcontractors, to address the 
longer term skill shortages the industry faces. 
The Board
During the year there have been a number 
of significant changes to the Board. 
Bob Lawson who led the Group with 
distinction as Chairman for six years 
retired from the Board on 12 November 
2014. We would like to thank him for his 
excellent service. 
Mark Clare, who had been Group Chief 
Executive since 2006, decided that after 
nearly nine years he wished to retire 
from executive life and develop his non-
executive career. The Board is grateful 
to Mark for the legacy he leaves in terms 
of the financial strength and operational 
capability of the Group; we wish him well 
for the future. Mark was succeeded as 
Chief Executive on 1 July 2015 by David 
Thomas, who joined us as Group Finance 
Director in 2009. We were pleased to have 
such a strong successor in place.
Neil Cooper has been appointed to  
succeed David and will join the Board  
on 23 November 2015 as Chief Financial 
Officer (‘CFO’). Neil is currently Group 
Finance Director of William Hill PLC 
and was Group Finance Director of 
Bovis Homes Group PLC from 2007 
until 2010, so he has a strong CFO track 
record as well as good knowledge of the 
housebuilding sector. 
The Board is confident that the Executive 
Directors – David Thomas, Steven Boyes 
and Neil Cooper – supported by an 
exceptional senior management team,  
will lead the Group effectively. 
The future
The market outlook is strong, we 
have a clear strategy in place and the 
management and operational capability 
to continue delivering improved returns. 
We look forward to another year of 
outstanding performance.

 Country & Metropolitan has delivered another set of outstanding
results in what is a shortened ten month period to 30 June 2003.
Profit before tax and amortisation of goodwill rose to £6.85m. This
record result confirms the Board’s confidence expressed in the
interim statement and I am positive that the Group is well placed
to continue such progress.
Results and dividend
The Group changed its financial year to 30 June following the
acquisition of NorthCountry Homes Group Limited (“NorthCountry”)
and during this shortened ten month period to 30 June 2003 it has
achieved an increase in pre-tax profits before amortisation of
goodwill of 72% to £6.85m (2002: £3.99m).  Operating profit
before amortisation of goodwill rose by 76% to £8.94m (2002:
£5.07m), which resulted in basic earnings per share before
amortisation of goodwill increasing by 56% to 25.91p (2002:
16.56p) per share.  As a consequence, I am pleased to report that
the Board is proposing to increase the final dividend by 21.5% to
2.60p (2002: 2.14p) per share bringing the total for the period to
3.30p (2002: 2.75p).  The final dividend will be paid on 9 January
2004 to shareholders on the register on 12 December 2003.
The Group’s net gearing has reduced from 150% to 139% at the
period end with interest cover increasing from 2.86 to a
comfortable level at 4.28 which is also cushioned by the current
annual rental income of £890,000.  Net asset value per share has
increased to 123.5p per share (2002: 102.7p) representing
shareholders’ funds of £23.3m (2002: £19.4m).
Operating review
As expressed last year and at the interim stage, the Group has
withdrawn from the more difficult luxury homes market in the
South East with only two such units available for sale.  We are
focused primarily to provide homes that are priced at levels which
are affordable in the relevant markets and have commenced some
new initiatives in the South East to achieve this objective.  These
initiatives are in line with the government’s aspirations and also
serve the requirements of local authorities.
However, an exception to the above is our ownership in what we
believe to be one of the most prime sites in London, opposite
Hampton Court Palace, with a direct frontage to the River Thames.
We have now signed heads of agreement with Network Rail for a
major mixed use development of the adjoining Hampton Court
Station and work is progressing for a joint planning application to
be submitted following formal agreement being concluded with
Network Rail.
The Southern Region has sold all the units at the development in
Moseley, Birmingham and has acquired further sites in
Wolverhampton suitable for regeneration.  The development in
Moseley has won the Birmingham Post & Mail Award for Best
Starter Home.
Our city centre development known as "Blue" at Granary Wharf in
Leeds is 50% sold with further units now released for sale.
Construction is expected to be completed in summer 2004.
Development of 43 units at our site at Poole Hospital in
Middlesborough has commenced and we have secured 9
reservations off plan at prices in excess of budget.  A planning
application has been submitted for the conversion of approximately
240,000 square feet of listed buildings, 368,000 square feet of new
build homes and 150,000 square feet of commercial space at High
Royds Hospital in Menston near Leeds and consent is expected later
in the year.  The Group has a 50% interest in this project via a joint
venture company.  The North West region is growing steadily and
Chairman’s Statement
2 Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2003
“The Group is now playing a leading role in urban redevelopment in the UK, with
a particular focus on affordable homes in the north of England.”
David Laing
Chairman has sold 31 of the 42 units at Jackson’s Warehouse in Manchester
with healthy margins and has secured approximately 300 plots for
future development.
NorthCountry’s five regions operating in the North of England have
had a successful period with 542 units sold during the ten months
to 30 June 2003.  It has now secured a resolution to grant planning
consent for approximately 250 units at Havelock Hospital in
Sunderland and construction is expected to commence shortly.
NorthCountry is focused on increasing its land bank suitable for the
first time buyer market and is continuing to achieve this at very
competitive prices. One of its key objectives is to increase the
number of outlets which has been thwarted by the nationwide
frustration in the planning system.  I am pleased to report that to
support the continuing growth of NorthCountry, the management
team led by Jolyon Harrison has been strengthened by the
appointment of Steve Murray as managing director.  Steve Murray
has 20 years experience in the house building sector and was an
executive director of Beazer Group PLC for 6 years.
The Group currently owns or controls 4,200 plots of which 1,790
plots have planning consent.  In addition it owns or controls
strategic land representing potential for a further 1,800 units.
Board Appointment
This year the Group also announced the appointment of Terry
Roydon as Non-Executive Director. I would like to take this
opportunity of formally welcoming Terry to the Board.
Terry has over 35 years experience in the house building industry
and has held a number of board positions in the building sector,
most notably as Chief Executive of Prowting PLC and more recently
as Chairman of Banner Homes Limited. During his time at Prowting,
the Company floated on the London Stock Market and generated an
annual turnover of £150m producing 1,600 homes annually.
Corporate activity
We sold part of our interest in Headway PLC to one of our
substantial shareholders, Allied Commercial Exporters Limited and
as a result our holding has reduced to 8.6%.  We continue to hold
our interest as a trade investment.
Prospects
Since the acquisition of NorthCountry our geographic spread has
increased significantly as has our product range and skill set.  As a
result the enlarged Group is well positioned for further growth,
especially in the current climate of low inflation and low interest
rates, which has provided much needed stability in the housing
market.  
By developing a diverse product portfolio and maintaining our
strong track record in land acquisition we continued to achieve a
record forward order book with contracted sales of £26.7m and
forward reservations of £18.6m as at 30 September 2003.      
I remain confident that Country & Metropolitan will deliver another
impressive set of results in the current year.  On behalf of the
Board, I should like to thank all members of staff for their immense
effort and support for the Group.

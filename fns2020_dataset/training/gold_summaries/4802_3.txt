 2 Diploma PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010
John Rennocks, Chairman
Diploma has delivered good revenue and profit growth 
in the 2010 financial year, with a strengthening trend 
into the second half of the year. In the face of the 
global recession in 2009, the Group quickly scaled 
back operating costs and working capital and reduced
balance sheet exposure. These actions left the Group
well placed to maintain performance during the
downturn and then to capitalise on the opportunities
presented by the recovery, which began to emerge in
the second quarter of the 2010 financial year in most 
of the Group’s key markets. Given continuing uncertainty
in the major economies, management has continued 
to maintain close control over costs and working 
capital, which has resulted in a further strengthening 
of operating margins and continued strong cash flow.
Results
Group revenue increased in 2010 by 15% to £183.5m
(2009: £160.0m). The combination of increased revenue
and cost reductions implemented in 2009, contributed 
to an increase in adjusted operating profit of 25% to
£32.1m (2009: £25.6m) and operating margins improved
to 17.5% (2009: £16.0%)
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 26% to £32.2m
(2009: £25.5m) and adjusted earnings per share
increased by 28% to 18.9p (2009: 14.8p).  
The Group generated free cash flow in the year of
£29.8m (2009: £23.5m), including net proceeds of
£6.4m received from the sale of the two Anachem
businesses. After spending £11.0m on acquiring 
new businesses and certain minority shareholdings
during the year, the Group ended the year with cash
balances of £30.1m (2009: £21.3m). The strong 
balance sheet, together with renewed medium term
bank facilities, will provide the resources to continue 
to exploit the acquisition opportunities which are 
now emerging. 
Dividends
Diploma continues to generate attractive and 
growing dividends for its shareholders. The Board is
recommending an increase in the final dividend of 
17% to 6.2p per share (2009: 5.3p) which, subject to
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, 
will be paid on 19 January 2011, to shareholders on 
the register at 3 December 2010. 
The total dividend per share for the year will be 9.0p
which represents a 15% increase on 2009 and is
consistent with the Board’s policy to target dividends 
per share towards a cover ratio of 2.0 times based on
adjusted earnings. 
Chairman’s Statement
Strong earnings, value
and dividend growth
over the business cycle 3 Diploma PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Five years of progress
The strength and resilience of the Group’s business
model is demonstrated by the consistent profitable
growth of the Group over the past five years. Adjusted
earnings per share has grown at 14% per annum
through a combination of organic growth and carefully
targeted acquisitions. This consistent growth in
earnings, combined with a strong balance sheet and
excellent cash flow has encouraged the Board to
significantly increase the rate of dividends paid to
shareholders from 4.0p in 2005 to 9.0p this year, an
annual average increase of 18% per year. At the same
time the Group’s market capitalisation has increased
from £161m in 2005 to over £300m. Taken together, 
the Group has therefore delivered an average total
shareholder return of 20% per year, over the past
five years. 
Governance
There were no changes to the Board during the year, 
but we continue to evaluate performance thoroughly 
on an annual basis, as well as reviewing appropriate
succession plans.
Employees
The requirement to reduce costs during the recession
has largely had to be borne by our employees, through 
a combination of reduced headcount and constrained
salary increases. The Board is very grateful for the way
in which our employees have adapted to these difficult
and challenging conditions and it again demonstrates
that a key strength of Diploma is the proactive and
responsive attitude of our employees. I wish to thank 
all of our employees for their exceptional efforts and
dedication which are key to the success of the Group. 
Outlook
In recent years, the Group has demonstrated both the
resilience of its business model and its ability to react
swiftly to changes in market conditions.
Robust underlying organic growth together with strong
cash generation and an active acquisition programme,
provide the Board with confidence that the Group will
achieve further progress in 2011.

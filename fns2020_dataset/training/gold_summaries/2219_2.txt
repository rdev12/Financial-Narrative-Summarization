Millets offers a range of branded goods though has 
a focus on key own-label brands, including Peter 
Storm and Eurohike which are amongst the UK’s 
most popular Outdoor clothing and equipment 
brands.
Focused upon customers with a passion for 
adrenaline sports, Freespirit offers a range of 
iconic casual lifestyle brands. Owing to the 
continuing decline in this Boardwear market, 
the Group has taken the decision to exit fully 
from this segment over the coming months.

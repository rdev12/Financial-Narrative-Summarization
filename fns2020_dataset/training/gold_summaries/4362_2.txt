OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS
The Group’s heritage is in news 
and the printed word – through 
the Daily Mail, The Mail on 
Sunday, local and regional 
newspapers. But there’s much 
more to our story. 
It’s more than 20 years since we 
took the decision to diversify 
the business and reduce our 
reliance on UK advertising 
markets. It was a pivotal 
moment. 
DMGT in 2011 has over 12,000 
employees. It controls a 
growing portfolio of profitable 
digital businesses. B2B 
operations account for nearly 
50% of total revenue. Profitability 
has increased five-fold, with 
more than 50% of profits now 
earned in North America.
We are expanding our 
capabilities, extending our 
geographic footprint and 
strengthening our balance 
sheet. 
A CONTENT-LED GROUP
We’ve built and acquired many 
different kinds of companies to 
develop the Group, but there  
is always one common thread. 
Each depends for its prosperity 
on connecting people with 
valuable, content-rich 
information. 
With our roots in news, we 
understand what makes  
great content. We invest in 
companies that generate 
high-quality, hard-to replicate 
content and distribute it to 
people and businesses when 
they need it, in the way that 
they want it. 
Customers want real-time, 
relevant information wherever 
they happen to be. We’re 
developing apps, building 
platforms and improving the 
mobile user experience. 
Our customers are also 
co-creators. They contribute 
reviews and feedback. They 
form online communities. In the 
professional sphere, they want 
to debate industry issues and 
analyse real-time data. 
We’re engaging with 
communities in various ways. 
We are building audiences  
on multiple platforms by  
acting as a trusted partner. We 
stage global conferences and 
exhibitions. We manage social 
and professional online 
networks. And we deliver 
compelling content. 
DISTRIBUTED DECISION-
MAKING
We don’t micro-manage. We 
devolve operating decisions  
as much as possible. Strong 
financial management  
skills and systems at Group  
level allow us to monitor 
performance and underlying 
risk. This, allied to a transparent 
reporting culture, provides 
effective control and gives  
us the confidence to let our 
businesses follow their own 
paths to growth. 
Our hands-off management 
style appeals to talented 
entrepreneurs. We focus on 
giving them the right kind  
of backing, motivating them 
and rewarding initiative. 
OUR STRUCTURE 
DMGT is publicly listed on  
the London Stock Exchange. 
The founding family retains a 
significant interest and, in the 
person of our Chairman, 
executive control.
Our overriding aim is to 
maximise performance for all 
shareholders. Our family control 
status makes that easier to 
achieve. Public listing adds 
rigour – it imposes market 
disciplines and promotes best 
practice. Committed, family 
ownership adds flexibility and 
greater scope to generate 
long-term value.
ACTING RESPONSIBLY
As a Group we’ve always been 
committed to sustainable, 
long-term performance. 
Managing our businesses and 
brands responsibly, valuing our 
own people and respecting 
the communities we serve are 
essential for our own continued 
success. From this common 
starting point each of our 
business units develops 
corporate responsibility policies 
to suit its distinctive conditions.
BUILDING ON SUCCESS 
We take a portfolio approach 
to management. We invest  
for the long term in businesses 
that meet our financial and 
strategic criteria. Equally, 
where existing holdings no 
longer meet our strategic  
and financial requirements,  
we will divest. 
Ours is a growth agenda. We 
are consistently looking to build 
on and extend our market-
leading positions. We are 
generating shareholder value 
and strengthening our balance 
sheet by progressively 
enhancing the quality  
of our assets. 
DMGT continues to evolve.  
It is developing into a global 
growth company with 
sustainable earnings, a 
consistently growing dividend 
and an increasing exposure  
to high-growth markets.
DMGT is an international Group quoted 
on the London Stock Exchange. It brings 
together a portfolio of businesses operating 
in traditional media, information and 
digital markets. DMGT companies 
provide essential news and knowledge 
resources to professional and consumer 
audiences around the globe.

REPORT SUMMARY
DMGT’s core objective is 
continually to improve the 
quality of its portfolio of assets, 
thus enhancing its overall share 
rating. We are progressively 
transforming DMGT into a 
global growth company.
We have identified three 
strategic priorities in pursuit of 
this objective. Firstly, we are 
growing our B2B businesses. 
Secondly, in consumer sectors 
we support our newspapers 
and invest in digital media. 
Thirdly, we are diversifying 
internationally into high-growth 
markets. 
Four strategic pillars inform our 
approach: growth, innovation, 
efficiency and talent. 
Our businesses are managed  
to achieve sustainable growth. 
We invest in growth potential 
and focus on high-growth 
sectors. 
Innovation is a key discipline. 
We invest in product 
development and new 
technology. We promote agility 
and resilience by encouraging 
a problem-solving, can-do 
culture across the Group.
The Group allocates capital 
efficiently according to clear 
investment criteria. We subject 
all of our assets and potential 
investments to regular, rigorous 
analysis. We maintain strong 
financial discipline.
We back talent. Our 
decentralised management 
style encourages initiative. We 
reward success with 
performance-related incentives. 
DMGT is a long-term owner of a diverse 
range of high-quality media and 
information assets in both the business-
to-business (B2B) and consumer sectors. 
We build sustainable and growing 
revenue streams by providing useful 
content, information, analytics and  
events 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
OUR VISION & VALUES
We are building a global 
growth company to deliver 
sustainable earnings and 
dividend growth over the long 
term. Our distinctive values 
help us to pursue growth, while 
remaining agile and keeping a 
firm grip on performance.
Long-term view
DMGT is a permanent capital 
company. We invest in 
companies and business 
models that will generate 
value through sustained 
growth over the long term. 
Empowering people
We’re here to help people get 
things done. Within the Group, 
we back talent. In our markets, 
we equip our customers with 
relevant, topical information.
Customer focused
We take our cue from our 
customers. Our decentralised 
structure ensures that the 
people making the big 
decisions are close to their 
markets.
Integrity and quality of content
High-quality content makes 
our companies distinctive. We 
aim to deliver relevant, reliable 
and topical information that’s 
hard to find elsewhere. 
Creative, adaptable and 
innovative

and see change as an 
opportunity.

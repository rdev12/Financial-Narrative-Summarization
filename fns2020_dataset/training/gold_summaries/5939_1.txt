     FIBERWEB PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009    9
OVERVIEW PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
2009 marked the last year of the major 
restructuring programme we have 
been driving over the last three years. 
The steady recovery in our ﬁ nancial 
performance, with the second half of 
2009 being the ﬁ fth consecutive half-
year of stable improvement in reported 
underlying operating proﬁ t and operating 
margin was especially welcome and 
notable in a year of considerable 
mayhem in the ﬁ nancial sector and deep 
recessionary conditions in many of our 
important markets.
The most important objective for 
the year was to continue building on 
the growth in underlying operating 
margin seen during 2008. The 4.4% 
achieved in the first half was followed 
by 5.8% in the strong second half, 
adding momentum to our efforts to 
improve pricing, reduce costs and 
most importantly in the longer-term, 
to launch attractive and differentiated 
new products at improved margins.
Financial Performance
Following the sales declines seen in 
recent years as a result of significant 
restructuring, 2009 saw a further 
decline. However, this was caused 
largely by the significant reduction 
in average raw material prices, 
which feeds through to sales with 
a lag of around 3 months, and the 
dramatic market conditions. The 
sales outturn of £454.2 million in 
2009 represents a decline of 10% 
in volumes and 16% in sales on 
a constant currency basis after 
adjusting for the impact of business 
disposals and the creation of the 
FitesaFiberweb joint venture at the 
end of July, which removed the sales 
of two facilities from our reported 
turnover. 2009 full year underlying 
operating profits from continuing 
operations before restructuring costs 
and non-recurring items at £23.1 
million represents growth overall 
in both reported currency and at 
constant currency.  A solid first half 
was followed by a strong second half 
as pricing and restructuring actions 
demonstrated their effect and 
the first significant impact of new 
product sales from our revitalised 
sales and marketing programmes 
began to demonstrate a positive 
impact.
The loss before tax of £6.1 million 
(2008: loss of £25.2 million) reflects 
the much reduced restructuring 
charges associated with ongoing 
efforts to remove unviable assets and 
to improve productivity, regrettably 
involving job losses. The 2009 
restructuring charge of £15.8 million 
(2008: £43.2 million) comprises 
£13.4 million of fixed asset write-
downs and impairments, £0.3 million 
of other asset write-downs, £6.0 
million in cash expenses, largely 
for redundancy payments, offset by 
gains of £3.9 million on disposals of 
previously written-down production 
equipment at Terram, Simpsonville 
and AQF.
We saw further volatility in oil prices 
during 2009, with the very low levels 
reached at the end of 2008 feeding 
through into low raw material prices 
in early 2009. However, steady 
increases in both oil and polymers 
characterised the remainder of the 
year. We succeeded in designing a 
hedging programme that effectively 
mitigated a significant proportion 
of this volatility in the second half 
of the year, with hedges equivalent 
to the majority of the polypropylene 
demand of the European Industrial 
division. This programme helped us 
maintain more stable prices for our 
customers and stable margins, and 
we will be seeking to replicate and 
possibly extend these arrangements 
in the future.

Operating cash flow of £59.3 
million (2008: £62.7 million) before 
non-recurring cash costs of £8.7 
million (2008: £6.8 million) and 
asset divestment proceeds of £4.5 
million (2008: £17.2 million) funded 
capital investment of £27.0 million 
(2008: £33.6 million), net interest 
payments of £9.3 million (2008: £9.6 
million) and shareholder dividends 
of £5.1 million (2008: £5.1 million). 
Excellent improvement in the 
control of working capital produced 
another net inflow of £15.3 million 
(2008: £17.7 million), continuing 
the trend seen in 2008. Working 
capital as a percentage of sales, 
a metric management believes is 
crucial to the business, stabilised at 
15.4% (2008: 17.1%), reflecting tight 
controls and management focus.
Divisional Review
The simpler organisational structure 
of the Group, implemented in 
mid-2008, was validated by the 
strong performance seen in 2009 
in a difficult market environment. 
In addition, the creation of a global 
purchasing function in late-2008 
allowed improved control and risk 
management of the Group’s largest 
single cost. 
The major organisational 
development initiative in 2009 
was the completion of a strategic 
marketing training programme, 
developed together with Cranfield 
University, for a group of fifty 
senior sales, marketing and 
product development staff from 
across Fiberweb. The purpose of 
the programme was to improve 
our capabilities in identifying and 
analysing markets and customer 
needs and in translating these 
insights into improved processes 
for product development, sales and 
planning.
Industrial
All three regional industrial businesses, 
in the Americas, in Europe and Terram, 
saw weak markets, currency turmoil 
impacting their competitiveness and 
signiﬁ cant reductions in inventory 
through their customer supply 
chains. Despite these impacts and 
very signiﬁ cant market declines in 
many market segments related to the 
construction industry on both sides 
of the Atlantic, we managed to raise 
margins, launch new products and 
gain market share in many areas.
In the Americas Industrial division, 
2009 was a year of stable margins  
while battling continued depressed 
construction markets but with 
excellent performance in terms of 
working capital reduction. Sales of 
$128.4 million were down by 23% with 
operating margins of 5.7%, slightly 
up on prior year. Working capital was 
a particular focus, with inventory 
reduced by $3.4 million to $35.1 
million, as strenuous efforts were 
made to improve responsiveness and 
cash ﬂ ow. Also notable during the year 
were:
• Further efﬁ ciency gains in 
manufacturing and logistics;
• The successful launch of a new 
range of rooﬁ ng underlays – based 
on the very successful Typar
TM
 
housewrap product – to compete 
with traditional rooﬁ ng felt.  The new 
products perform better, are longer-
lasting and are signiﬁ cantly quicker 
and easier to lay, with lighter rolls, 
reducing the risks for roofers 
carrying materials up ladders to 
their workplace;
• The successful ﬁ rst major 
DefenCell™  production and sales, 
with enormous productivity gains as 
production was ramped-up; and
• The successful migration to new 
polyester polymers as the recession 
forced existing suppliers to reduce 
or halt production.
In the European Industrial division, 
2009 was a recovery year following 
a weak 2008, faced with extremely 
difﬁ cult markets, especially in house 
building and hence rooﬁ ng. Although 
sales decreased to €77.2 million 
(excluding the acquired Coronor sales), 
down 7%, margins almost doubled 
to 12.6%, up from 6.7% in 2008, in 
response to cost reductions, new 
product launches and improved sales 
and marketing initiatives resulting in:
• Strong growth in Linopore UV Plus 
– the leading polypropylene-based 
rooﬁ ng underlay component with 
enhanced UV stability;
• Strong growth in polyethylene 
nonwovens sales to the medical 
industry, based on the successful 
qualiﬁ cation of a novel polyethylene 
compound, developed together with 
a partner supplier; and
• Launch of several new rooﬁ ng 
underlay products aimed at niche 
markets for renovation; a market 
segment which, as predicted, 
remained more stable than new-build 
as the recession gathered force.
Revenue £182.7 million 
(2008: £187.6 million)
Margin growth 8.1%
(2008: 5.4%)
INDUSTRIAL
Nonwovens are used widely in many industrial 
markets. Fiberweb has a strong position in the 
construction industry, fabric softener sheet and 
graphic arts markets amongst others.

OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Hygiene
2009 was an eventful year for both 
Fiberweb’s hygiene businesses.
In Consumer Fabrics, North America 
continued the strong recovery 
seen in 2008 with very high levels 
of utilisation for much of the year, 
despite an unexpected fall in volumes 
for premium branded products in the 
ﬁ rst quarter. Europe also suffered 
from over-capacity during the ﬁ rst 
half, but a combination of recovering 
markets, difﬁ culties suffered by 
some weakly-capitalised competitors 
and the initial beneﬁ ts of the major 
restructuring programme outlined 
early in 2009 and implemented during 
the year saw a marked improvement 
in margins. Overall in Consumer 
Fabrics, like-for-like volumes fell by 
9% with sales down 20% to £217.6 
million. Margins also fell from 4.9% 
to 4%, largely due to the impact of 
raw materials and price pressure in 
Europe.  Very low raw material prices 
at the start of the year supported 
margins initially, but then rose steadily 
from February onwards until the fourth 
quarter, putting pressure on margins, 
as expected. Strenuous efforts were 
made to improve efﬁ ciencies and to 
implement the closure of three less 
efﬁ cient spunbond lines in Europe 
with limited disruption to customers, 
as the new Italian spunbond line was 
commissioned around mid-year.
The major event of 2009 though was 
the creation of the FitesaFiberweb 
joint venture in the Americas. This 
exciting initiative brought together two 
of Fiberweb’s facilities – in Washougal, 
WA in the North-Western USA and in 
Queretaro, in central Mexico – with 
Fitesa’s modern and well-invested 
facility at Gravatai, near Porto Alegre in 
Southern Brazil, to create a business 
with sales of around $200 million from 
three sites and around 200 employees. 
FitesaFiberweb’s position will be 
further enhanced by the major new 
Our Hygiene business provides nonwoven fabrics 
to major consumer goods companies around the 
world for applications in diapers and feminine 
hygiene. These are produced using two principal 
methods: spunbond and airlaid.

PERFORMANCE 12    FIBERWEB PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2009 
The Industrial businesses will 
beneﬁ t from new products launched 
in ﬁ ltration, rooﬁ ng and specialist 
geo-textiles as well as in additional 
capacity for meltblown and agricultural 
fabrics. Cost reduction actions will 
beneﬁ t 2010, as will the investment 
in marketing skills and resources. 
However the current outlook in 
construction especially, remains 
uncertain.
Further debt reduction remains a 
priority. The medium-term target of net 
debt at 2x EBITDA announced in 2008 
remains in place, and we will strive to 
make progress in this direction while 
continuing the necessary programme 
of investment to improve Fiberweb’s 
competitiveness further. I believe we 
are in a robust position as we enter the 
Group’s next stage of development.

spunbond investment currently under 
construction at Fiberweb’s site in 
Simpsonville, SC in the South-Eastern 
USA.  The formation of this JV is a 
major step forward in the necessary 
consolidation of the spunbond industry 
and gives Fiberweb excellent access 
to the fast-growing and attractive 
South American market as well as 
reducing the ﬁ nancial strain and 
risk of ﬁ nancing a new investment, 
required to service new products 
under development with major hygiene 
customers for the North American 
market.  Similarly, Fitesa gains access 
to the North American market, sharing 
the risk of a new investment, and will 
beneﬁ t from Fiberweb’s deep and 
long-standing relationships with major 
global hygiene customers.
In the Airlaid business, now only 
present in China, 2009 was a 
disappointing year. Signiﬁ cant volume 
weakness was apparent right from 
the start of the year and only began 
to improve in the fourth quarter. As a 
result, sales fell by 13.7% to RMB294 
million and margins halved to 4.8%. 
Faced with these difﬁ cult market 
conditions, caused by consumers 
choosing to trade down to less-
premium feminine care products, 
launching new products from our 
relatively new second line was 
extremely challenging. Success was 
only seen late in the year, and we have 
better expectations for the coming year 
based on the customer acceptance 
now slowly becoming apparent.
On the Industrial side of our Chinese 
business, managed by the same 
management team as Airlaid, 
differences with our partner in 
the small polyester nonwoven JV, 
Hengguan, that we entered into during 
2008, led us to acquire 100% control 
and to begin the relocation of the line 
to our main facility in Tianjin, north-
eastern China. The successful upgrade 
of the Hengguan line has now largely 
been completed and we look forward to 
establishing a stable business once the 
relocation is complete in late 2010.
Our People
During these challenging times it 
demands a great deal of commitment 
and loyalty from our employees 
to focus on serving customers 
and optimising performance. I am 
always impressed by the loyalty and 
determination shown by Fiberweb 
people around the globe. We beneﬁ ted 
during 2009 from targeted recruitment 
in several important areas, notably in 
technical and marketing functions. 
We have also continued to invest in 
training and development for both 
existing and new staff as we turn 
our attention increasingly to growth 
through innovation.
As ever, I would like to thank all 
Fiberweb employees for their 
commitment and creativity as we begin 
to emerge from the turnaround into 
a period of more normal growth and 
development in challenging markets.
Outlook
We expect Fiberweb’s performance 
to be resilient, despite the continuing 
challenges of the economic 
environment. Results will be impacted 
by continued high levels of volatility in 
both commodity pricing and exchange 
rates. 
The Hygiene businesses are expected 
to continue to beneﬁ t from fairly 
stable end-user demand, from the 
heavy restructuring completed in 
Europe during 2009 and from the 
major investments made in recent 
years. The FitesaFiberweb joint 
venture is also expected to make a 
material contribution to our improving 
performance during 2010.
WE EXPECT FIBERWEB’S PERFORMANCE TO 
BE RESILIENT, DESPITE THE CONTINUING 
CHALLENGES OF THE ECONOMIC 
ENVIRONMENT.

 02 Business Direct Group plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 06/07
Introduction
The 13 month period to 31 January 2007 
saw considerable changes to the group, 
primarily with the appointment of Paul Carvell 
as chief executive officer. One of the first 
actions undertaken at this time was to conduct 
a strategic review of the business which focused 
on sustaining long term proﬁtable growth. In 
order to carry out the agreed strategy, we went 
to the market to raise additional funding, 
resulting in an additional £3m investment from 
shareholders. We should not forget that all 
of this happened alongside the day-to-day 
running of the business and during the period 
under review I am pleased to report that the 
group has continued to expand with signiﬁcant 
growth in the ParcelXchange business and 
signiﬁcant investment in Two-Man and 
Technical in our Specialist division.
Financial review
Turnover for the 13 month period totalled 
£15.95m (2005: £13.51m) and gross proﬁt was 
£5.45m (2005: £3.74m), a gross margin of 
34.2% (2005: 27.7%).
The operating loss was £1.69m (2005: £2.38m). 
After an exceptional charge of £0.42m (2005: 
£0.46m) in connection with moving the T eddington 
ﬁnance department to Rugby and reorganising 
the business to reﬂect the needs of its redeﬁned 
strategy, the loss before interest and tax totalled 
£2.11m (2005: £2.83m). With an interest charge 
of £0.29m (2005: £0.16m), the loss before and 
after tax amounted to £2.40m (2005: £2.98m). 
The basic loss per share was 6.7p (2005: 9.5p).
Adding back the exceptional charge 
of £0.42m (2005: £0.46m) and goodwill 
amortisation of £0.12m (2005: £0.10m), 
the adjusted loss before tax was £1.86m 
(2005: £2.42m), a 33.1% improvement, 
and the adjusted loss per share was 5.2p 
(2005: 7.7p). The adjusted LBITDA amounted 
to £1.11m (2005: £1.92m).
At the year end, net debt totalled £2.0m 
(2005: £4.0m) and net assets were £3.0m 
(2005: £1.4m), the balance sheet having been 
considerably strengthened by the placing on 
8 January 2007. At this time, Business Direct 
issued 100,000,000 new ordinary shares of 
1p at 3p per share, raising £2.7m of net funds 
after expenses of £0.3m. At the same time, 
£945,000 of preference shares were converted 
into 31,500,000 new ordinary shares of 1p. 
T o facilitate the placing, each ordinary share 
of 5p was converted into one new ordinary 
share of 1p and one deferred share of 4p. 
The deferred shares have no value. 
In addition, the group agreed a series 
of amendments to its banking facilities 
with the Bank of Scotland. As part of the 
new arrangements, the repayment date 
of the term loan of £2.5m was put back by 12 
months to 2011, and the ﬁnancial covenants 
were amended to reﬂect the group’s revised 
business plan. 
Business review
ParcelXchange Division
During the period under review, there was 
continued growth in the ParcelXchange 
network. The number of ParcelXchanges in 
the ﬁeld increased to 300, meaning that the 
actual number of lockers now exceeds 4,000. 
Occupancy also increased over last year 
from 39% to 51% and we intend to grow 
this further in the current year. 
Although we have halted the lost business 
we suffered in the first half on In Boot 
and offset those losses by new business on 
Direct Vendor Trunking, overall turnover for this 
area was static when compared to last year.

Specialist Division
The additional investment made in our 
T wo Man Delivery and T echnical Service offerings 
resulted in substantial growth and we view 
these as key components in the portfolio of 
services the Specialist Division provides. The 
results for our Sameday/Next day Delivery 
and Partsbank Divisions, which trade principally 
in the Northern Home Counties, were 
disappointing. This is a very price sensitive 
market and trading conditions are challenging 
for all those within it. However, having undergone 
a thorough review and replaced less proﬁtable 
accounts with more proﬁtable ones, we are 
conﬁdent that we can once again grow 
revenues and proﬁts in these areas.
Board changes
During the period under review, there have 
been signiﬁcant changes to the make-up 
of the group’s board.
Carl Wylde resigned from the board in 
January 2006. In June 2006 Paul Carvell 
joined the group, replacing Paul Keane, as 
non-executive chairman. At the same time, 
the board appointed Derek O’Neill as 
group ﬁnance director and David Whittaker 
as operations director.
In September 2006, Paul Carvell assumed the 
full time role of chief executive ofﬁcer, replacing 
Tim Houston who stepped down to concentrate 
on the significant opportunities presented 
by global licensing of ParcelXchange.
Following a period of consultancy, I joined 
the group in January 2007 as chairman, 
having previously held a number of key roles 
in public companies in the logistics industry.
At the end of January 2007, Wayne Crew 
also stepped down from the board, remaining 
responsible for ParcelXchange sales.
In March 2007, having been a key person in 
securing the additional funding, Derek O’Neill 
decided he needed to concentrate on his 
other business interests, and took a position 
as joint managing director with a recruitment 
services company. He has been replaced 
by Martin Wright, who has held a number of 
senior ﬁnancial roles in blue chip companies. 
Martin was already working in the group 
overseeing the transfer of the ﬁnance function 
from Teddington to Rugby.
David Whitaker also stepped down from the 
board in March 2007 and has been replaced by 
Martyn Wilson who assumes the role of managing 
director of our Specialist Divison. Martyn has 
many years’ experience in the Sameday/Next 
day/T echnical arena and was previously managing 
director of UK T oday, a major courier company, 
and prior to that held senior posts in TNT , 
developing its sameday network.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
the previous directors for their past contribution, 
to welcome the new team and wish them all 
every success in the future.
Employees
I would also like to thank all of our staff, without 
whose contribution the progress made would 
not be possible. Their enthusiasm for the 
business is reflected in the significant 
shareholdings held by them, and I am pleased 
to announce that in the current year we will 
be launching a sharesave scheme for which 
all levels of staff will be eligible.
Prospects
The ongoing success of the ParcelXchange 
concept in the domestic market and the vast 
opportunities of global licensing, together 
with the signiﬁcant growth opportunities in 
Specialist, give me great confidence that 
Business Direct Group’s prospects are 
excellent. Whilst not underestimating the 
challenges ahead, I feel sure that we now 
have the right people, structure and focus 
for this business to achieve its full potential.

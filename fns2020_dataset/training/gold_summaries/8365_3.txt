 Annual Report 2005
Chairman’s Statement
Results
I am pleased to report another
strong set of results for the year,
with growth in every division. 
Revenue for 2005 was £580.1m,
an increase of 16.1% over 2004.
Underlying operating profit,
stated before the amortisation 
of intangible assets and the
impairment of goodwill and after
adjusting for the hurricanes and
other non-recurring items, was
£92.9m, 11.9% up on last year.
Group operating profit was
£83.0m, an increase of 1.7%. 
A reconciliation of the underlying
figures to the statutory figures is
set out on page 8 of the
performance review.
Acquisitions and disposals
An important part of Intertek’ s
strategy to add value to our
customers, is to widen the range
of services in the Group and
extend the geographic coverage
by acquiring complementary
businesses which can be
leveraged through the global
network. During 2005, the Group
made 12 acquisitions for a total
consideration of £46.9m. Apart
from Omega Point Laboratories,
which was acquired in April 2005,
the other acquisitions were made
in the second half of 2005, so the
full impact on trading results will
not be realised until 2006. 
I am pleased to
report another
strong set of 
results for the 
year, with growth 
in every division.
The largest transaction was the
acquisition of Automotive
Research Laboratory (ARL) from
PerkinElmer in November 2005,
for consideration of £20.1m.
ARL which is based in T exas, is a
market leader in the provision of
testing services on automotive
fuels and oils. This fits well with
the existing Caleb Brett business
and complements the PARC
business which was acquired in
August 2005 and Entela, which
was acquired in 2004.
Acquisitions are described in
more detail in the performance
review. 
At the end of November, the
Group sold its 49% shareholding
in the German company, DEKRA
Intertek Certification GmbH, to
DEKRA AG for £2.7m and
acquired the remaining 51% of
the shares not already owned by
Intertek in the Swedish company
DEKRA-SEMKO Certification AB
for £0.9m. This deal ended the
joint venture between Intertek
and DEKRA and enables both 
parties to focus on growing 
their certification businesses
independently.
Accounting Standards
This is the first Annual Report
prepared by the Group under
Adopted International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs).
Previously, the Group’ s accounts
were prepared in compliance
with UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (UK
GAAP). The 2004 comparatives
have been restated except where
permitted by IFRS 1: First Time
Adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards.
The adoption of international
standards has some impact on
the presentation of our financial
statements but does not
fundamentally change our
strategy, business and economic
risks, financial position, or our
cash flows. A reconciliation 
of the impact on the income
statement and the balance 
sheet is given in note 29 to 
the financial statements. 
Dividends
During the year, the Group paid
total dividends of 10.9p per
share (2004: 9.3p) comprising
the final dividend for 2004 of
7.0p per share and the interim
dividend for 2005 of 3.9p per
share. Since the balance sheet
date, the Directors proposed a
final dividend of 8.1p per share
(2004: 7.0p) which combined
with the interim dividend of

year dividend of 12.0p per share
(2004: 10.4p), an increase of
15.4% over last year. The final
dividend, which is subject to
shareholder approval, will be
paid on 16 June 2006, to
shareholders on the Register
at 2 June 2006. 
Board changes
2005 was a year of change on
the Intertek Board. After leading
the Group for more than 20
years, Richard Nelson retired as
Chief Executive Officer in March.
I would like to thank Richard on
behalf of the Board for his
outstanding personal
contribution in building the
Group and I am pleased that he
has remained on the Board as
Non-Executive Deputy Chairman.
Wolfhart Hauser succeeded
Richard as Chief Executive Officer;
the transition was seamless and
the Group has continued to
perform well and grow under
Wolfhart’ s leadership. 
It is with much regret that I have
to report the sudden death of
Ross Sayers on 25 November
2005. Ross served as a Non-
Executive Director of Intertek for
the past three years and I speak
for the Board and my colleagues
at Intertek when I say that his
good humour, friendship and
valuable contribution to the
Group will be sadly missed.
I am delighted to announce that
Debra Rade joined the Intertek
Board as a Non-Executive
Director on 1 January 2006.
Debra is currently a Partner in
Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP
a major national US law firm,
based in Chicago. Debra’ s
practice focuses primarily on
corporate governance and
compliance as well as product
safety and certification. Until
2002, Debra was a senior officer
of Underwriters Laboratories Inc.
a provider of product safety and
certification. Debra’ s extensive
experience within the inspection
and testing industry, as well 
as her legal and corporate
governance background, will
strengthen the Board.
Employees
One of Intertek’ s key strengths is
the dedication and expertise of
the Group’ s employees around
the world. At the end of 2005,
the Group employed over
15,500 people in 108 countries,
an increase of 2,000 over last
year. This increase was partly due
to acquisitions made in the year
and I would like to extend a
warm welcome to all new
Intertek colleagues. On behalf of
the Board I would like to thank
all of the Group’ s staff for their
contribution during the year and
congratulate them on another
excellent performance.
Outlook
Intertek is very well positioned in
many of its industries and the
continued active marketing of
our services should ensure we
have another year of favourable
results with good organic
growth rates complemented by
acquisition growth. 
We strive to support and add
value to our customers by
continuing to align ourselves
with them and offering bundled
solutions to increase efficiency
and reduce their costs while at
the same time improving their
products. By offering good value
to our customers, we are
confident that Intertek will
continue to prosper in the years
to come.

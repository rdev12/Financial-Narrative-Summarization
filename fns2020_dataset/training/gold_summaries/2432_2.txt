Especially in a category which seems quite rational like 
Consumer Health Care, it’s essential to convey consumer 
messages in emotional ways. Communications testing 
using BrainJuicer’s unique and intuitive CommScan
®
 
method has helped us identify which advertising ideas 
are emotionally powerful – and why – in various markets 
around the world. The BrainJuicer
®
 team is highly responsive 
and professional, and they’re great fun to work with as well.

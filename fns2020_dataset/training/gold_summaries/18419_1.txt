Chief Executive Officer’s review
Dr Miroslav Reljanovic
Chief Executive Officer
“We have delivered a  
very strong financial 
performance with top-line 
and adjusted EBITDA 
growth of 43% and 39% 
respectively… and  
£28 million of new  
contracts won.”
I am pleased to report that in 
our first full year as a public 
company we delivered a very 
strong financial performance 
with top-line and EBITDA growth 
of 43% and 39% respectively. 
The stand-out performer was 
PrimeVigilance with pro forma year 
on year revenue growth of 47%.
We won contracts with a total 
value of £28 million during the 
year including several multi-million 
pound full service Phase II and 
III programmes and full service 
pharmacovigilance services to 
late stage pharmaceutical and 
biotech companies. This means 
our backlog at 1 January 2016 
is a healthy £59 million and sets 
up our services business for 
another good year in 2016. 
We continued to look for bolt-on  
acquisitions to augment the organic 
growth of our services business by 
adding complementary services 
and/or geographical coverage. 
In May 2015 we acquired Sound 
Opinion, one of the UK’s leading 
development plans and monetisation 
of products with the expectation of a 
greater share of the upside in return 
for bearing more of the development 
costs. It was in this context we 
started discussions with Haemostatix.
Haemostatix has developed a 
proprietary platform technology 
which can be used as the basis for 
a series of products to address 
the $2.5 billion global market 
for haemostats. A more detailed 
description of Haemostatix is set 
out on page 5. The Haemostatix 
acquisition is a landmark event for 
Ergomed. In the Board’s view, having 
its lead product already proven to 
work in patients, it is relatively low 
risk with a manageable and rapid 
development programme and also 
offers attractive market potential. 
In summary, Haemostatix has the 
potential to lift Ergomed to the next 
level based on near term milestones.
Ergomed will, as a result of 
acquiring Haemostatix, incur all 
of the development costs of its 
products and overheads which 
will, in the short term, change the 
financial profile of the Group. It is 
important to note that the Board 
intends to retain a balance between 
our services and development 
businesses such that Ergomed 
overall remains EBITDA positive.
Lastly, in addition to delivering 
our financial targets, we can look 
forward to two clinical milestones 
in 2016; lorediplon Phase II results 
and Zoptrex™ Phase III results, as 
well as the initiation of a Phase IIb 
confirmation proof of concept study 
for Haemostatix’s lead product. 
I look forward to another 
productive year in 2016.

combined it with PrimeVigilance.
Our co-development business, 
where we provide our expertise and 
services in return for carried interest 
in the drugs under development, 
continues to gain traction. In 
February 2015 we entered into a 
co-development agreement with 
Dilaforette for the Phase II clinical 
development of sevuparin in patients 
with Sickle-Cell Disease (‘SCD’) 
experiencing acute Vaso-Occlusive 
Crisis (‘VOC’). The first of its kind, 
under the terms of the agreement, 
Ergomed co-invests a proportion of 
its CRO fees from the trial in return 
for an equity stake in Dilaforette, 
a company forming part of the 
Karolinska Development AB (STO: 
KDEV, ‘Karolinska Development’) 
portfolio. We also announced that 
in line with the expanded scope of 
work undertaken by Ergomed we 
had increased our investment in 
CEL-SCI Corporation’s Multikine®, 
for the treatment of advanced 
primary head and neck cancer, from 
$10 million to $12 million. Other 
co-  development milestones included 
the initiation of Phase II trials for 
Ferrer (lorediplon) and Dilaforette 
and completion of recruitment for 
Aeterna Zentaris (Zoptrex™). 
We have been looking to enhance 
our co-development portfolio by 
striking deals which provide Ergomed 
with greater control over the

Results
Group revenue in 2005 (continuing and
discontinued) increased by 11% to £1,090.4
(2004: £979.0m). Profit before taxation decreased
by 1.2% to £138.9 (2004: £140.6m). Trading profit
rose by 18.5% to £177.7m (2004: £150.0m) and
underlying profit before tax rose by 17.4% 
to £167.0m (2004: £142.3m). It gives me great
pleasure to be able to report another set of
record results.
Underlying earnings per share of 10.58p (2004:
9.12p) were 16.0% higher than the previous year
and your directors have recommended a final
dividend of 2.40p per share (2004: 2.18p).
Together with the interim dividend of 1.01p 
(2004: 0.92p) which was paid in December 2005,
this represents an increase of 10% compared 
to 2004. Subject to shareholders’ approval, the 
final dividend will be paid on 7 July 2006 to 
all shareholders on the register at 2 June 2006.
Further information on these results are detailed
in the Financial Review on page 10.
Corporate Development
During the year the Group completed a
comprehensive strategic review, the details of
which are set out later in this report. Continuation
of organic growth and acquisition together with
an increased focus on technology development
will underpin sustained future growth. Reshaping of
the Group’s portfolio is largely complete although
there are likely to be further refinements in 2006.
A number of acquisitions were made in 2005 and
are set out in this report.The two most significant
were announced at the end of 2004 and completed
in 2005.They were H Koch and Sons for a cash
consideration of US$51m, and REMEC Defense &
Space Inc. for a cash consideration of US$257m.
Both have been successfully integrated into the
Group and we look forward to them each making
a significant contribution to the Group’s future
prosperity. In November the Group’s Fluid and 
Air distribution business was sold to the US-based
Eaton Corporation for a cash consideration 
of £150m.
People
Marcus Beresford was appointed Senior
Independent Director in 2005, replacing Mike
Smith who retired in June 2005 after nine years 
as a Board member. Mike Smith made an
outstanding contribution to the Group and,
on behalf of the Board, I thank him and wish 
him a long and happy future.
In June 2005 Geoff Cooper resigned after ten
years as an executive director and again, on behalf
of the Board, I thank him for his significant
contribution and wish him well for the future.
Dr John Patterson, Executive Director Development
of AstraZeneca plc, was appointed a non executive
director of the Group on 1 November 2005. He
brings wide ranging and relevant experience to
the Group and we welcome him to the Board.
2005 presented many internal and external
challenges to the Group as we refocused on 
a sharper technology-driven approach to our
business. In these circumstances we owe thanks
and appreciation to our employees for their skill
and dedication. I thank them sincerely.

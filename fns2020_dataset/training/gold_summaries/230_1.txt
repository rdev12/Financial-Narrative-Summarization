ACM Shipping Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
We are extremely pleased with the 
progress the Group has made during the 
year, both in terms of results for the year 
and investment in our future. Our US 
Dollar income, including four months 
of our new acquisition, ACMSS, was up 
54% on the previous year. Excluding this 
acquisition our Dollar income grew 22%. 
This follows an 8% increase in the previous 
year. We have also continued to invest for 
organic growth in terms of brokers both 
in the UK and overseas.
Spot brokerage
The core of ACM’s business is spot 
brokerage, which involves the hire of a 
vessel for a single voyage. The number 
of	spot	deals	fixed	during	the	year	is	an	
important performance indicator of the 
business. This grew 12% year on year 
following a 15% increase the previous 
year. Total spot income in US Dollars 
showed a 14% uplift. Our average freight 
income per deal increased slightly during 
the	year .	This	was	due	to	a	significant	
increase in rates in the last few months 
of the year following a period of relatively 
subdued rates in the previous months.
Time charter
Our time charter business, which involves 
the long‑term hire of tankers, had an 
excellent year. Income in US Dollars 
for the year showed a 45% increase over 
t h e 	 p r e v i o u s 	 y e a r . 	 A n 	 i m p o r t a n t 	 b e n e fi t 	 o f	
having a strong time charter ethos is that 
it gives the Group a forward order book. 
At the year end, ACM’s forward order book 
stood at over US$24.7 million and showed 
an increase of 27% on the previous year. 
This income includes certain contracts 
which run to 2018, but US$9.0 million 
of this will be invoiced in the 2008/9 
financial	year .
Sale and purchase
Our sale and purchase business was 
considerably strengthened during the 
year by our acquisition of ACMSS in 
December 2007. ACMSS business had 
an exceptional period of trading following 
the acquisition. Although we do not expect 
this level of performance to continue, 
we believe it continues to be a sound 
investment and was an important strategic 
move for the Group which will strengthen 
ACM globally.
Overseas operations and new markets
We have continued to expand our 
business globally. Our Indian office, 
which formally opened for business in 
December 2007, has already started to 
show very encouraging signs of its ability 
to increase our global market share of the 
tanker business. This follows a year of 
becoming established and training our 
e m p l o y e e s . 	 O u r 	 S i n g a p o r e 	 o f fi c e 	 c o n t i n u e d	
t o 	 s u p p o r t 	 o u r 	 U K 	 o f fi c e 	 a n d 	 a l s o 	 i n c r e a s e d	
its own direct business. In China we are 
in the process of changing our operation 
from a joint venture to a wholly owned 
and controlled operation. We believe that 
this approach will increase our opportunities 
to do business in the new building arena 
in this important market.
In early 2007 we started to become involved 
in the gas shipping market. This business 
is now showing signs of genuine progress 
and	we	are	confident	about	a	successful	
future for ACM in this market.
Joint venture
Our joint venture with GFI Group, Inc. to 
conduct derivative brokerage had another 
good year although the contribution 
t o 	 p r o fi t 	 w a s 	 s l i g h t l y 	 b e l o w 	 l a s t 	 y e a r	
at £0.9 million.
Acquisition of Harris & Dixon Shipbrokers
On 23 June 2008 we announced the 
acquisition of the ship broking business 
of Harris & Dixon Shipbrokers Limited. 
This acquisition is an excellent strategic 
step for ACM as they specialise in the 
one area of tanker broking that ACM 
is not currently involved in. Furthermore 
the deal will quickly become earnings 
enhancing. Harris & Dixon have an 
extremely experienced broking team who 
are committed to the Company for the 
long‑term; they bring with them a solid 
forward book and the combined customer 
bases will provide further exciting trading 
opportunities for the Group.
Outlook
This has been an exciting period for ACM, 
both organically and through acquisition. 
Our international footprint is growing and 
we are confident that this base along 
with synergies gained through acquisition 
will	help	drive	profitability	throughout	
the organisation.

 Introduction 
2013 was a landmark year for the HellermannTyton Group 
as it became a listed company while continuing to deliver 
good results from implementing its organic growth strategy. 
The Group listed on the London Stock Exchange on 2 April, 
following the IPO by Doughty Hanson of the majority of the 
Group’s shares. The IPO was met with signiﬁcant investor 
demand and the shares have subsequently performed strongly, 
rising by almost 55% from the IPO price of 195 pence per 
share to close the year at 302 pence per share.
2013 was also an important year for the Board, which I 
joined as Chairman in February. Three additional experienced 
independent Non-executive Directors were recruited at the 
same time, and the Board was therefore at full strength at the 
time of the IPO.
Performance
I am pleased to report that HellermannTyton delivered good 
progress in 2013. The Group’s revenue of €538.0 million 
increased by 11.1% in constant currency and 4.6% at reported 
rates compared with 2012. Underlying EBITA and underlying 
EBITDA were €83.0 million and €104.8 million respectively 
with margins remaining strong at 15.4% (underlying EBITA) 
and 19.5% (underlying EBITDA). This primarily reﬂects the 
increased volume of sales in all of the Group’s segments and 
markets as the Group continued to deliver the strategy that 
was set out at the time of the IPO.
Financial position 
Net debt position at 31 December 2013 was €150.6 million, 
including €220.0 million of senior secured notes and cash and 
cash equivalents of €80.0 million, which included €29.5 million 
of net proceeds from the IPO.
On 26 February 2014, the Group signed a new €230.0 million 
revolving credit facility to replace the existing senior secured 
notes and undrawn revolving credit facility.
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share (EPS) for the year were 
22.81 cents (2012 pro forma 22.23 cents). Reported basic EPS 
were 10.60 cents and reported diluted EPS were 10.41 cents.
Final dividend
Underlying EPS
I believe that the Group will continue to 
deliver good growth in the years ahead, 
underpinned by its continuing strategic 
focus and investment in maintaining 
excellent customer service, strong 
innovation and the high quality of its  
global infrastructure and workforce.

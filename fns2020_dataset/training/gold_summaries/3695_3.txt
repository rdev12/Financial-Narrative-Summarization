Chairman’s Statement
Results
Proﬁt on ordinary activities before taxation decreased by 45%
to £54.5m (2002 - £99.9m). Earnings per share decreased by
76% to 17.2p (2002 - 70.7p). These decreases were due to the
exceptional loss on the sale of Westwind after goodwill
previously written off to reserves in 1995 has been taken into
account.
I am delighted to be able to report another set of record
underlying results for 2003. Turnover for the year increased by
13% to £832.6m (2002 - £734.6m). Profit before tax,
integration costs, goodwill amortisation and the disposal of
Westwind rose by 17% to £135.3m (2002 - £115.8m).
Underlying earnings per share of 93.5p (2002 - 86.4p) were 8%
higher than for the comparable period last year. Your directors
have recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 19.80p (2002 - 18.00p)
per share. Together with the interim dividend of 8.36p per share
(2002 - 7.60p) which was paid in December, this represents an
increase of 10% compared to 2002. Subject to shareholders’
approval, the ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 2 July 2004 to all
shareholders on the register as at 4 June 2004.
The group generated cash from operations of £147.8m (2002 -
£135.9m). Net debt at the year end of £154.4m (2002 -
£188.8m) includes the cash cost of acquisitions completed in
2003 and represents a gearing level of 34% (2002 - 63%).
The group invested £40.4m (2002 - £31.6m) in research and
development, an increase of 28%.
Our ‘Manufacturing’ companies have been reorganised into a
single Aerospace Systems group which is expected to show
further growth in future years. Trading performance was much
stronger in the second six months of the year. Excellent results
were produced by all three business groups. Avionics has
successfully acquired and integrated nine businesses.
Corporate development
The group will continue to strengthen its leading position in
aerospace markets building on the skills and systems capability
which have been developed in recent years. A combination of
organic growth and acquisition will support this strategy which
has produced consistent growth and an increasing return for
shareholders over the past two decades.
In Cobham we have the people,
products and services to satisfy our
customers’ future requirements and the
strategy that will continue to increase 
total shareholder return

” COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 7
We completed a successful share placing in July.
Thirteen acquisitions were made during the year for a total
consideration of £165.4m, including £14.4m of deferred and
contingent payments. In December Westwind was sold to GSI
Lumonics Inc. for £21m.
People
In November, I became the non-executive chairman of 
Cobham plc. At the end of July, Giles Irwin retired as group
ﬁnancial director after 20 years’ service. In August, Robin Clark,
managing director of Flight Refuelling Limited, left the company
as a result of the reorganisation of the group’s structure,
mentioned above, after 22 years’ service with Flight Refuelling
Limited. My board colleagues join me in thanking them for their
long and valuable contribution to the successful development
of the group.
During the year there were two executive appointments to the
board. In July, Warren Tucker became group ﬁnancial director
and in November, Andy Stevens was appointed managing
director of the newly formed Aerospace Systems group. In
March 2004, Marcus Beresford was appointed to the board as
an independent non-executive director. I welcome each of them
and look forward to their contribution in continuing our record
of sustained proﬁtable growth.
Outlook
The breadth of Cobham group activities is such that we are now
able to manage variations in individual sectors with some
conﬁdence. Defence markets are growing in the USA and this
has directly beneﬁted the group. We have also successfully
anticipated the technologies required by military priorities.
Commercial aerospace still has some way to go before we can
be conﬁdent that a genuine recovery is in progress. However,
Cobham’s presence on the most modern commercial aircraft
and a growing aftermarket have, to some extent, mitigated the
effects of the downturn in the commercial aerospace sector.
Overall, I am conﬁdent that in Cobham we have the people,
products and services to satisfy our customers’ future
requirements and the strategy that will continue to increase
total shareholder return.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT
ROBERT WALTERS
The excellent performance in 2014 served 
to further highlight the strength, depth and 
diversity that the Group now has in terms 
of both geography and discipline. 
We have been able to leverage this strength to 
deliver an 80% (91%*) increase in profit before 
taxation, a result that was particularly impressive 
given that market conditions in two of the Group’s 
largest markets, Australia and France, remained 
challenging for much of last year. 
We have a strong blend of permanent and contract 
recruitment net fee income, a truly global footprint  
of growing businesses across both established and 
embryonic recruitment markets plus a market-leading 
recruitment process outsourcing business – all of 
which is underpinned by a powerful international 
brand and a strong and experienced senior 
management team.
The recruitment industry continues to evolve 
through the advent of new resourcing strategies and 
technologies and we remain firmly at the forefront of 
these developments. The role of a high-quality 
specialist professional recruitment consultancy, 
such as Robert Walters, to filter and manage the 
increased volume of data and the number of 
communication channels available to candidates 
and clients has never been more important. In 
addition, our Resource Solutions business ensures 
we are extremely well placed to benefit from the 
trend towards an outsourced recruitment model.
Review of operations
Asia Pacific (42% of net fee income)
Revenue was £251.4m (2013: £260.1m) and net fee 
income was £90.5m (2013: £92.1m) an increase of 
8% in constant currency. This delivered an operating 
profit increase of 45% (59%*) to £10.5m (£11.5m*) 
(2013: £7.2m).
In Asia we have benefited from strong growth 
within our larger, more mature and market-leading 
businesses in Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong 
and, very encouragingly, we are also now seeing 
positive returns from our more recent investments 
in a number of the region’s emerging recruitment 
markets. Our operations in Malaysia, Thailand and 
Vietnam in particular have delivered excellent net fee 
income growth and, critically, have the capacity to 
grow into substantial businesses. 
Australia returned to growth in the fourth quarter 
and in New Zealand, our businesses in Auckland 
and Wellington both delivered record performances. 
Resource Solutions in Asia won a number of new 
clients and also successfully extended a number  
of existing client deals.
UK (33% of net fee income)
Revenue was £311.9m (2013: £235.7m), net fee 
income increased by 24% to £71.1m (2013: £57.2m) 
and operating profit more than doubled to £5.2m 
(2013: £2.5m).
The UK had an excellent year as both client 
and candidate confidence continued to improve. 
Growth was broad-based and spread across both 
London and the regions, with disciplines such as 
commerce finance, legal and sales & marketing 
delivering particularly strong performances. Also of 
particular note, was the beginning of a recovery in 
the permanent financial services market in London, 
with recruitment levels across risk, compliance and 
projects particularly high.
To continue to build on this performance and further 
extend our regional presence, we have opened a 
new office in St Albans.
Resource Solutions continued to deliver impressive 
results increasing net fee income significantly  
year-on-year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT
CONTINUED
Europe (20% of net fee income)
Revenue was £106.4m (2013: £93.9m) and net fee 
income increased 4% (10%*) to £43.8m (£46.1m*) 
(2013: £42.0m) producing a 73% increase in 
operating profit to £2.2m (£2.3m*) (2013: £1.3m).
Market conditions across the Eurozone were 
mixed. In France, our largest business in the region, 
the permanent recruitment market remained 
challenging, however our contract business 
continues to go from strength to strength and 
produced excellent growth. 
Recruitment activity levels across the Benelux 
region were more favourable, with our business in 
Belgium the standout performer across both the 
permanent and contract markets. We continue to 
focus on Germany as a key growth market for the 
Group and are also very encouraged by the strong 
performance in a number of our smaller markets in 
the region such as Spain and Ireland.
Other International (5% of net fee income)
Revenue was £9.9m (2013: £8.0m) and net fee 
income increased by 25% (35%*) to £9.9m (£10.7m*) 
(2013: £7.9m) producing an operating profit of  
£0.3m (operating profit of £0.2m*) (2013: operating 
loss of £0.2m).
Other International comprises the US, South Africa, 
the Middle East and Brazil. Our business in the US 
had a record year with both San Francisco and 
New  York delivering excellent growth. In New York, 
much like London, we have seen a recovery in the 
permanent financial services market with areas 
such as compliance particularly active, whilst the 
technology-driven San Francisco market remains 
extremely buoyant. 
Client and candidate confidence in Brazil remains 
low, our office in Dubai more than doubled net fee 
income year-on-year whilst in South Africa net fee 
income grew strongly and we are now one of the 
largest international players in the market.
Current trading and outlook
Having entered seven new countries since 2010,  
the Robert Walters Group now has over 2,600  
staff spanning 24 countries. We have focused on 
increasing the profitability and productivity of our 
fledgling businesses and the Group as a whole, 
delivering an 80% uplift in profit before taxation  
and an increase in consultant productivity. 
Early trading in 2015 has been in line with 
expectations. Whilst we are mindful of continued 
Eurozone uncertainty, we believe we are very well 
positioned to capitalise on both current and future 
growth opportunities.

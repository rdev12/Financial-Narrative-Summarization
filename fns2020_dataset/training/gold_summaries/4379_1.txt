Chief Executive’s review
OVERVIEW
Our performance this year has been robust and we have
continued to deliver on our strategy towards being the
provider of choice of unified communications to the UK
SME and mid-market sector. 
2013 2012
Group £m £m
Revenue 351.5 348.6
Gross profit 129.7 132.9
Gross margin % 36.9% 38.1%
Adjusted EBITDA 56.3 56.3
Adjusted EBITDA % 16.0% 16.2%
Operating loss (16.8) (13.1)
Cash generated from operations 47.6 29.1
Free cash flow 38.6 28.6
Revenue has grown with the contribution from
acquisitions offsetting the well understood market trends
of reducing fixed line revenues and the impact of
regulation on mobile tariffs.
This year our product portfolio has been enhanced and
we have continued to reduce our reliance on our
traditional voice business. New acquisitions have brought
further strengths in networks and systems, whilst our
data business has been reinvigorated by direct
investment in new data centre facilities.
I am pleased to highlight the significant level of cash
generation as we have now managed our way through the
working capital headwinds seen in the previous year.
The Group has delivered a solid performance this year in
a difficult economic climate. I would like to thank our
employees across the Group for the effort and
commitment that has made this possible.
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our primary market is the SME and mid-market
business sector within the UK and our aim is to 
develop the business through a strategy of organic 
and acquisitive growth.
The acquisitions completed during the year are set 
out below.
On 16 April 2012 we completed the acquisition of the
entire issued share capital of WWG, a market-leader in
audio-conferencing and call-handling services. Based in
Peterborough, the business supplies services to a
number of the world’s largest audio-conferencing
companies and, though UK-based, routes inbound calls
from multiple foreign territories. WWG forms part of the
Daisy Retail division.
On 31 January 2013 we acquired the entire issued share
capital of TNC. TNC is an IT data specialist that provides
‘white-label’ professional services, maintenance and
installations to the UK channel. The business works with
vendors including Cisco, Juniper Networks, HP and
Microsoft to provide complex and specialist IT services,
delivered through its highly qualified in-house
engineering force. The Berkshire-based company has
experienced rapid organic growth since its establishment
in 2009 and its customer base is serviced by a UK-wide
team of field engineers and information and
communication technology consultants, supported by a
UK service desk. TNC now forms part of the Daisy
Wholesale division. Overview

DIVISIONAL REPORTING continued
Daisy Retail continued
Due to the change in mix of business, networks margin
has reduced to 40.4% (2012: 44.5%). This is as a result
of the effect of the high volume of inbound call
conferencing from WWG, which generates gross margin
of 23.5%. The underlying gross margin from fixed lines
and calls has been maintained through improved
commercial terms and pricing arbitrage in respect of
lower-cost voice traffic for mobile-terminated calls. 
In line with our expectations the volume of traditional
fixed line calls continued to decline. These legacy
products have diminishing significance as we diversify
our product range and increasingly provide new
technologies and mobile and data-led solutions to our
customers. Nonetheless, we are working hard to ensure
margins are maintained via continued enhancement
activity such as consolidation of supply, improved
volume discounts and product bundling to provide
improved customer value.
Our data revenue has reduced as some customers have
been switching into improved lower-cost products, but
we have been able to improve gross margin to 41.1%
(2012: 40.6%) through rationalisation of the supplier
base and by moving more data connections to our own
Daisy Wholesale division.
Investment in our existing owned data centres has
increased available capacity and improved our facilities,
with our current hosting capacity at approximately 66%
(2012: 70%) utilisation. This capacity provides a
significant opportunity for further growth in this market. 
The gross margin in systems has reduced to 59.2%
(2012: 65.4%) due mainly to the higher proportion of
SME sales versus sales of larger, mid-market systems.
The gross margin in mobile has reduced to 35.9% (2012:
37.8%) primarily through greater investment in smart
devices in line with customer demand. Our scale and
capability make us a key partner for the mobile
networks and this has allowed us to improve our
commercial arrangements as a consequence. Looking
forward, we are well positioned to take advantage of the
continued move to voice and data convergence on smart
devices, including both handsets and tablets.
Our success in Daisy Retail is driven by our ability to
increase the number of products and services taken by
our customer base, retention of the base through
excellent customer service and our ability to drive
further efficiencies and improvements in our processes.
Below is an analysis of the percentage split of the average
number of products per customer for the directly-owned
base within Daisy Retail. Products are defined as calls,
lines, inbound telephony services, mobile, internet
services, hosted solutions and maintenance:

1 47 46
2 29 32
3 18 16
4+ 6 6
100 100
Products per customer 1.85 1.80
The number of products per customer has increased as
the division focuses on cross-selling and increasing
product penetration. The number of customers now
taking at least three products has increased to 24%
(2012: 22%).
Efficient administrative functions are also important and
I am pleased to report that at 31 March 2013 the Retail
customer base enjoyed direct debit penetration of 77%
(2012: 75%) and e-billing penetration of 54% (2012: 53%).

Daisy Wholesale
Daisy Wholesale provides communications services to
smaller telecoms resellers. These resellers comprise
small to medium Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”),
telecoms networks and resellers and IT service
providers. These supply arrangements exist as a result
of the Group’s ability to obtain better pricing from
network carriers and ISPs, combined with the provision
of user-friendly portals, which facilitate efficient
provisioning for the resellers.
Products offered by Daisy Wholesale comprise:
Networks
Fixed line calls, fixed line rentals, inbound telephony
services, select services and managed billing
Data
IP VPN, broadband, ethernet and hosting
Systems
Maintenance, engineering and equipment
Mobile
A white-label offering from O2 and Vodafone

DIVISIONAL REPORTING continued 
Daisy Wholesale continued 
Our Wholesale data business (principally aggregated
broadband services) continues to enjoy higher gross
margins than those traditionally seen in networks. 
The post-acquisition results of TNC have been included
within systems.
The main area of growth during the year has been in
mobile services which were first introduced to this
customer base during 2012. This growth, together with
some operating cost efficiencies, has seen a significant
improvement in adjusted EBITDA to £3.9 million (2012:
£2.7 million). We anticipate further progression during
the next financial year as we see the full-year benefit of
these improvements.
Daisy Distribution
Daisy Distribution provides a full range of mobile handsets
and airtime tariffs from O2, Vodafone, Orange and 
T-Mobile via a dealer network. A summary of the division’s
results for the year ended 31 March 2013 can be seen
below, together with the comparative results for 2012.

The division has rolling, three-year agreements in 
place with the mobile networks on market-leading 
commercial terms.
This year the division has been impacted by the reduced
level of mid-term contract renewal incentives, provided
by certain of the mobile operators, which has had a
significant impact on revenue. The consequence of a
lower level of renewals is that our dealers have earned
less commission and hence the revenue shortfall was
partly offset by an improved gross margin.
There are indications that we can begin to re-initiate
mid-term contract renewals which positions Daisy
Distribution well for the new financial year.
Revenue by product — Group
Across the Group as a whole, our revenue can be viewed
as follows:
2013 2012
% of % of
Product £m total £m total
Networks 159.2 46% 138.9 40%

Group revenue
This demonstrates the diverse product mix, covering the
broad spectrum of communications services that Daisy
Group delivers to its customers. There has been a
marked increase in the proportion of revenue coming
from networks, as a result of the increase in inbound
call conferencing following the acquisition of WWG.
Traditional fixed line calls (excluding inbound telephony
services) continue to decline and now contribute only
14% of total Group revenue (2012: 16%).

OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER GROWTH
We have a highly skilled executive team capable of
building on the Group’s position as the main
consolidator and the leading independent provider of
unified communications to the SME and mid-market
business segment. We will continue to evaluate and
execute acquisitions that help build strategic advantage
and where we can see value for our shareholders.
We have invested £2.1 million in software development
this year (2012: £2.2 million). This investment has
ensured that we have the required customer
relationship management and billing systems that will
enable us to service a growing customer base taking
multiple products, over the medium term. In addition,
we have enhanced our network infrastructure and data
centres in preparation for future growth. A total of 
£3.1 million has been spent on property, plant and
equipment (2012: £2.5 million), with the bulk of this
expenditure relating to new network infrastructure
equipment at our various locations.
During the year we also signed a 15-year agreement for
a state-of-the-art data centre facility. This provides
500kW of IT load at the brand new Virtus LON1 data
centre primarily for hosting our customers’ business
critical IT platforms.
Our investment in DDCS since the year end further
improves our infrastructure and capabilities and we are
well-positioned for growth.
During the year the Group was selected as one of 14
organisations to deliver communication services within
the government’s Public Services Network (“PSN”)
services framework. The PSN framework is a ‘network
of networks’ that enables the delivery of public services
from any location by any provider across central
government departments, non-departmental public
bodies, the NHS, local authorities and voluntary sector
charities. These services include traditional and IP
based voice services, internet services, hosting, co-
location, audio-conferencing and system maintenance.
We were pleased to announce in December 2012 that, in
collaboration with its joint venture partner Updata
Infrastucture (UK) Limited, the Group had been awarded
a long-term contract for ten years to manage and
develop the IT network infrastructure and associated
services of one of the largest local authorities in the UK,
Essex County Council.
The new financial year will bring further business
process improvement activity and we will ensure that
we invest sufficient funds to manage the change,
ensuring our IT systems and network infrastructure 
will facilitate further growth.
SUMMARY
The last 12 months have seen Daisy Group make good
progress on both organic and acquisitive growth,
reinforcing the Group’s position in the market place.
We have in place the platform, the systems, the people
and the product set to allow us to grow both organically
and via strategic acquisitions.
Against a difficult economic backdrop, we believe we are
well positioned to make further progress towards our
aim of being the unified communications provider of
choice to the SME and mid-market sectors.

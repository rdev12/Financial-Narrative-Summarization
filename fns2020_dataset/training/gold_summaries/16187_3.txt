results. Across Mainstream, this year  
we reported record levels of customer 
satisfaction, up two percentage points from 
2012 to reach 79% (2012: 77%). Further  
to this, our higher-margin unique holiday 
sales increased by four percentage points, 
accounting for 69% of Mainstream holidays 
sold (2012: 65%), proving that our strategy  
to focus on unique holidays is working.

Dividends
We have a progressive dividend policy and  
it is the Group’s aim to maintain underlying 
dividend cover at around two times. 
Reflecting this year’s performance, the Board 
is recommending a final dividend per share  
of 9.75p per share (2012: 8.3p), an increase  
of 17%. At the time of our interim results, the 
Board proposed an increase of 10% to 3.75p 
(2012: 3.4p), leading to a full year dividend of 
13.5p per share, up 15% from 11.7p in 2012. 
Board
On 8 February 2013 I was appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director, and on 25 March 
2013, was appointed to replace Dr Michael 
Frenzel as Non-Executive Chairman of the 
Board following his retirement. On the same 
day, Sebastian Ebel became a Non-Executive 
Director.

Sustainable development
TUI Travel is a truly worldwide organisation 
and we are committed to operating our 
business in a sustainable manner. We have  
a three-year Sustainable Holidays Plan, 
launched in 2012, which sets out four 
overarching goals with 20 measurable  
and challenging commitments to responsible 
tourism. In this report we highlight progress 
from the second year of the plan and were 
pleased to see some promising results, 
particularly in terms of carbon management. 
We achieved our airline carbon reduction 
target of 9% (2008-2014) one year ahead  
of schedule with a reduction in our airlines’ 
per passenger carbon emissions of 3.2% 
year-on-year to 70.7g CO
2/RPK (2012: 73.0g 
CO 2/RPK).
Sustainability is ingrained in our business 
culture, not just for our own future as a 
business but as industry leaders to set an 
example to the wider travel industry and 
beyond.

Colleagues
The customer is at the centre of everything 
we do, but equally important to our success 
are our colleagues. TUI Travel is an 
organisation built from a workforce of over 
55,000 dedicated colleagues worldwide, all  
of whom share a common set of values which 
together creates TUI Travel and drives our 
performance as a market leader.
The hard work and commitment of this 
network of colleagues is vital to the success 
we have had to date. They play an integral 
part in driving our future growth. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank personally 
every one of our colleagues for putting in 
such a fantastic effort and helping us achieve 
the performance we have had in this 
record-breaking year. 
Friedrich Joussen 
Non-Executive Chairman
This has been another record breaking 
year for TUI Travel. It is my first year  
as Chairman of the Company and I am 
delighted to report a 20% increase in 
underlying operating profit to £589m,  
or 13% on a constant currency basis to 
£555m (2012: £490m). This has generated 
growth in our underlying basic earnings 
per share (EPS), having increased by  
19% to 30.8p (2012: 25.8p). Our statutory 
operating profit decreased slightly to 
£297m (2012: £301m) largely due to the 
£188m impairment of goodwill, meaning 
our statutory EPS has moved from  
12.5p to 5.4p for 2013. 
We operate in a market segment that, as a 
matter of course, has to weather geo-political 
events. As a result, it is vital that we have  
a strong and resilient business model that 
enables us to deliver on our strategy, which  
in turn drives long-term sustainable growth 
and increased shareholder returns. All of 
which, I am pleased to report, have been 
achieved this year. 
The travel and tourism sector has continued 
to grow by an average of 4% annually since 
1995, and is forecast to grow by 3.1% in 2013 
alone – outpacing the global economy. The 
comparable growth of TUI Travel is testament 
to what a fantastic year this has been, and 
shows how well we are positioned to continue 
to deliver on our annualised 7-10% growth 
plan. 
Results
Our financial performance comes as a result 
of our continued commitment to delivering 
high-quality unique holidays direct to our 
customers. This is coupled with a resilient 
business model and ambitious yet achievable 
growth roadmap. Our commitment to the 
customer is also delivering measurable 
15%

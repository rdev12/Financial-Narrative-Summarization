The GAME Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 
2008-2009
 I am pleased to report yet another 
strong set of results for The GAME 
Group despite the challenges 
presented by wider economic issues.
 Our success is based on placing our customers 
at the heart of our business. Our specialist 
proposition is designed to give our customers 
a great shopping experience and encourage 
their loyalty so they will come back to us time 
and time again. 
We focus on offering the widest range and 
choice of products available, combined with 
quality teams on hand to give helpful friendly 
advice, extensive product knowledge and 
exceptional service. 
We are ﬁ rst-to-market with leading promotions 
and multi-buy campaigns. 
Our trade-in programme enables our customers 
to access new games for less and we offer 
preowned products as a more affordable 
alternative to buying new and, through our 
Reward Card scheme, we consistently reward 
their purchases and thank them for shopping 
with us.
Lisa Morgan, Chief Executive
Continuing to focus 
on our customers is 
key to our success.

Our performance
Chief Executive’s review
continued
We believe we are positioned strongly to best 
serve customers as they seek ever better value 
and to differentiate our stores and websites in 
a constantly changing market place.
The Group has beneﬁ ted from the continuing 
growth in the appeal of pc and video games. 
With a worldwide market value of nearly 
$50 billion (source: IDG), video games are now 
a signiﬁ cant part of customers’ entertainment 
spend. The variety of product available 
offers something for everyone and, as a result, 
we have seen a much broader range of 
customers enter our stores and visit us online.
The suppliers of hardware and software 
publishers have recognised the diversity of 
demand. Over the course of our last ﬁ nancial 
year we saw the release of titles such as Grand 
Theft Auto IV , Call of Duty: World at War and 
Gears of War 2, all focused at the more 
traditional gamer. At the other end of the 
spectrum, we also saw innovative and 
interactive family products such as Wii Fit 
and Guitar Hero perform extremely well 
in the market place.
We have experienced central teams who work 
closely with our suppliers to ensure we get the 
right products to the right stores, in the right 
quantities, at the right time, supporting our 
store teams so they can focus on looking 
after our customers.
 UK and Ireland
In the UK we trade from over 690 stores through 
our GAME and Gamestation brands. The two 
brands appeal to different sets of customers, 
with Gamestation targeting the more traditional 
core gamer and GAME the family. They 
complement each other extremely well and as 
a result they both traded very successfully last 
year, delivering 70 per cent of Group revenue 
and 84 per cent of Group operating proﬁ t.
The UK games’ retail environment has changed 
considerably over the course of the year, 
with both Woolworths and Zavvi going into 
administration and withdrawing from the 
high street. We are well placed to beneﬁ t 
from these changes.
We further expanded our concession 
partnerships to gain access to new markets 
and customers. GAME concessions were 
opened in 20 Borders book stores across the 
UK – providing a relatively low-cost route to 
expand into new locations and reach even 
more customers.
It was our ﬁ rst full year of trading the Gamestation 
brand, following our acquisition of the business 
in May 2007. Gamestation has exceeded 
our expectations and we have continued 
to develop the brand and open new stores 
in appropriate locations. We expect to see 
further proﬁ t improvements as we complete 
the integration in 2009.
International
We trade from nearly 650 stores in eight 
international territories – France, Spain, Portugal, 
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Australia and 
the Czech Republic. Our acquisition of JRC, 
a 19 store pc and video games business 
based in Prague marked our ﬁ rst entry into 
Central Europe.
We had a busy store opening programme, with 
a net 134 stores opened outside the UK which 
included the buy-in of ten franchises. The size 
of our store portfolios, coupled with the GAME 
specialist offer and the capabilities of our local 
management teams, have enabled us to trade 
the GAME brand successfully in every country 
in which we operate. Our international businesses 
continue to perform well and contributed 
£583.3 million to revenue and £20.4 million 
to our overall operating proﬁ t.
Online
We are extremely focused on further developing 
our multi-channel offer. We operate transactional 
eCommerce websites in all the countries in 
which we trade. Over the course of the last two 
years we have invested nearly £12 million into 
our websites and online back ofﬁ ce infrastructure. 
This has given us a credible eCommerce 
offering that generated £106.8 million of 
revenue this year and positions us well to 
continue our growth trend in this area and 
beneﬁ t from future technological advances.

Our specialist proposition
 Regardless of where we trade, our success is founded on delivering our unique specialist 
proposition which puts the customer at the centre of our activities. 
Our specialist proposition is founded on our desire to provide an experience that consistently 
exceeds our customers’ expectations, builds relationships with them, and better understands 
their needs.
This is underpinned by an impressive, purpose-built, infrastructure and support network. 
 Our core attributes include:
We recruit and train employees with a passion for games and 
an aptitude for retail, who are dedicated to giving our customers 
the highest levels of services and advice. With such a broad range 
of products, requiring varying levels of technical know-how, 
we pride ourselves on matching each customer to the most 
relevant purchase.
The market is now in its third generation of hardware, comprising 
three consoles (Sony PS3, Microsoft Xbox360 and the Nintendo Wii) 
and two handhelds (Sony PSP and Nintendo DS). As a leading 
specialist we receive signiﬁ cant quantities of hardware products. 
As well as offering a full complement of console bundles, we offer 
a large range of software and peripherals, including our own 
brand accessories. We use our expertise and customer insight 
to generate unique product offers and deals. We offer customers 
what they want at prices they can afford.
The ability to trade-in and buy preowned games at GAME and 
Gamestation provides a material beneﬁ t for customers, particularly 
in today’s tougher economic climate. Trading-in games is a unique 
way for customers to save money, using their old games as currency 
against new purchases. Preowned games enable us to offer 
a wider range and better value to today’s more price-conscious 
consumer, allowing them to buy products at prices lower than 
our competitors. 
 Over 25,000 new customers are joining our Reward Card scheme 
every week. Both our GAME and Gamestation brands have built 
up signiﬁ cant levels of customer loyalty. The GAME Reward Card 
helps us to communicate with, and reward, up to 12 million 
customers and we intend to launch a similar programme for 
Gamestation. Through the Card our customers get points on 
every purchase, which can be used as discounts against future 
purchases. The transactional data allows us to learn more 
about our customers and their shopping trends, enabling 
us to continually reﬁ ne and target our offers.

Our performance
Chief Executive’s review
continued
 We aim to continually improve our offering 
and stay ahead of our competition by spotting 
trends and opportunities and by evolving 
our offer accordingly. At the same time, we 
constantly evaluate and invest in those aspects 
of our business that give us the greatest returns 
for the future.
Our customer focus is delivered daily by our 
committed employees. We pride ourselves 
on providing a great place to work: we recruit 
strong retailers, give them excellent training 
in customer service and product knowledge 
and they get the opportunity to work in a fun 
environment, in a constantly evolving industry. 
We encourage our employees to seek 
opportunities within the business with the result 
that many of our talented people within both 
stores and head ofﬁ ce have been promoted 
through the ranks.
Summary
The strength of our performance in the 53 weeks 
to 31 January 2009 was entirely attributable 
to our employees and our credentials as a 
specialist retailer – we will continue to nurture 
and develop these. We will also look to grow 
our store portfolio organically with 70 to 80 new 
stores planned for this year, continue to realise 
the beneﬁ ts of the Gamestation acquisition 
and further enhance our business online.
We recognise that the outlook for the wider 
global economy remains uncertain. However, 
we have seen the pc and video games market 
expand to record levels. It is now a key part of 
mass market entertainment. Console ownership 
continues to grow and innovative products 
continue to attract new customers and we are 
conﬁ dent about our prospects going forward.
Lisa Morgan
Chief Executive
 With over 1,340 stores in the Group, we have strong relationships with 
landlords and good access to new stores which is a key component 
of our property strategy. In each of the countries in which we operate, 
we identify the very best store locations for our customers that we 
believe will give us the best returns on our investment. We constantly 
review store performance and manage our estate to maximise 
our customer reach and our proﬁ tability. 
 We aim to have an online offering that matches the quality and 
reputation of our stores. In whichever way the consumer wants 
to shop with us, our product offer, availability and standards 
of service are consistently high.
To provide customers with our range of products and offers, 
it is vital that we maintain long-term and successful relationships 
with all the key hardware and software suppliers. We are 
committed to working in partnership to constantly improve 
our specialist proposition.
 Our distribution centres are dedicated to moving products quickly 
and efﬁ ciently to ﬁ nal destinations, whether that is large volumes to 
our stores or small individual packages direct to customers’ homes 
via online orders. Our state of the art systems and merchandising 
function ensures that we get the correct products in time to every 
destination, which is key to our customers’ needs.

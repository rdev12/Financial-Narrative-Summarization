Timing refers to changes in the date of recurring events which causes them to skip 
or occur twice in a ﬁnancial year.
The Group’s performance this year
ITE has delivered a good performance 
this year with the underlying business 
delivering a solid improvement in 
constant currency revenue and profits. 
However on account of the relative 
strength of Sterling against our 
principal trading currencies and the 
political upheaval in Ukraine, the Group 
is reporting lower revenues this year. 
Despite these circumstances the Group 
has reported an increase in headline 
profits before tax to £60.3 million. 
The Ukrainian business reported profits 
£2.6 million down from last year, and 
movements in foreign exchange had a 
further £4.0 million net negative effect 
on headline profits. However excluding 
Ukraine, ITE’s recurring events 
performed strongly, growing constant 
currency profits by £5.9 million, and 
profits were further enhanced by a first 
time contribution from acquisitions of 
£4.7 million. This was a smaller biennial 
year, and the net contribution from 
biennial events and timing differences 
this year was £3.1 million less than 
in the previous year.
The year started well with good 
trading conditions across most of 
our markets resulting in a strong 
first quarter financial performance. 
However the second quarter saw the 
onset of political instability and conflict 
in Eastern Ukraine. Subsequently, 
sanctions imposed by the West on 
Russia and the ensuing deterioration 
in the Russian Ruble began to affect the 
Russian economy, firstly affecting the 
viability of import related businesses into 
Russia. Subsequently the construction 
sector across all the Group’s Russian 
offices was impacted, and latterly the 
indications are of a more widespread 
effect on other sectors. The Ukrainian 
office reported a 50% reduction in 
square metres sold over the year, and 
like-for-like trading volumes in Russia 
were down 4% over the year. The Central 
Asian business was a highlight growing 
like-for-like volumes by 7% overall, led 
by a very strong performance from the 
Azerbaijan business. The Turkish and 
Asian businesses traded well, whilst 
the UK’s fashion market was a little 
flat overall. 
Development of the business
The main objectives for the Group 
this year were continuing to expand 
and diversify the Group’s business 
and managing the effects of the 
Ukrainian crisis.
The Group made major steps forward 
in establishing a business base in Asia 
in the last financial year and in 2014 
continued to build on this base. The 
most significant acquisition of the year 
was announced in October 2013, with 
the Group taking a 50% stake in the 
Chinacoat – Surface Finishing event. 
The event addresses two sectors of 
the industry, the paint sector, and the 
machinery and technology involved 
in applying the paints. Both sectors 
have grown significantly over the 
last few years in line with Chinese 
manufacturing industries. The 2013 
event took place in Shanghai, shortly 
after ITE acquired its interest, and 
sold 34,500m
2
, which was in line with 
expectations at the time of acquisition. 
The 2014 event opens tomorrow with 
34,200m
2
, an increase of 11% over its 
biennially equivalent event from 2012. 
In June 2014 ITE announced the 
acquisition of 50% of Indobuildtech, 
the leading construction event in 
Indonesia. Indonesia is a bright 
prospect for the exhibition industry 
as it combines a large population 
and healthy GDP growth. With two 
potential new exhibition venues, 
which will quadruple the space 
available over the next four years, 
Indobuildtech (currently wall bound) 
has significant potential to grow. ITE 
has now developed a strong base for 
growing its business in South East Asia 
with offices in Indonesia and Malaysia, 
with both countries having started 
construction of new exhibition space. 
The main factors affecting Group profitability this year are  
summarised in the profit bridge below. ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic report
Chief Executive’s 
statement continued
In October 2013 ITE announced the 
acquisition of 100% of Beauty Eurasia, 
the Istanbul-based cosmetics and 
beauty event. This is an important 
addition to our beauty portfolio in 
addition to the Ukrainian and South 
East Asian events in Indonesia, 
Vietnam and Malaysia. Beauty 
products are a strong proposition 
and early to respond to growing 
consumer prosperity – so a good 
asset for emerging markets. The 
June 2014 event was a success selling 
9,900m
2
 in its new venue, ahead 
of initial expectations.
Earlier in the year ITE extended its 
ownership in Scoop, the London-based 
high end womenswear exhibition 
which was an associate business, 
but is now a subsidiary. Scoop takes 
place twice a year in central London 
as part of the MODA portfolio and has 
become an important feature of the 
fashion calendar. 
ITE’s diversification strategy is 
working well and remains a priority 
going forward as we have illustrated 
in today’s announcement of the 
acquisition of Eurasia Rail in Turkey. 
In addition, ITE is increasingly focused 
on developing industry expertise and 
brands in its portfolio of events. The 
historic development of our business 
in Russia-CIS has left us with strong 
industry positions in Construction, 
Oil & Gas, Travel & Tourism and Food, 
with multiple shows in each sector. 
Often the events will represent slightly 
different parts of the supply chain 
for the industry depending upon 
where they are based. This logic is 
increasingly driving the development 
of our future new business as it both 
reduces risk and increases synergy to 
develop the business within sectors 
where there is expertise and a common 
customer base. The acquisitions of 
Beauty Eurasia and Indobuildtech are 
developments along this sector-based 
approach. Increasingly the entry into 
new markets will be driven by this 
logic, as acquisitions can be much 
less risky where ITE has customers 
and brands in place to support the 
new initiative.
In Russia, the benefits of common 
brands and systems which have been 
developed over the last few years 
are now being realised with an active 
programme of replicating and cross-
marketing events into and across 
the regional markets. The expertise 
developed by the Russian team 
is forming the base for a systems 
roll-out across the Group, bringing 
all customers and exhibitors into a 
common system. This will support 
the development of industry-based 
expansion strategies.
Venue expansion is important to 
the development of our business. 
In autumn 2014 the Expoforum 
venue opened in St Petersburg. This 
is a major new venue of 50,000m
2
 
gross with conference facilities that 
presents new opportunities for the 
further development of exhibitions 
and conference businesses in the 
north west of Russia. Construction 
has commenced on the new venue in 
Krasnodar, and completion is planned 
for early 2016. As noted before, there 
is new venue development under 
way in Indonesia and Malaysia that 
is expected to create opportunities 
for the Group to grow its events. The 
Group is well positioned to participate 
in the growth that the investments in 
local exhibition facilities are expected 
to generate.
ITE’s objectives and strategy 
ITE’s principal objective is to create 
a business with sustainable growth 
in headline earnings per share. Its 
strategy is to develop positions of 
market leadership in the exhibition 
business substantially in emerging 
and developing markets with good 
growth prospects.
ITE is evolving its strategic objectives. 
Whilst we have been successful in 
establishing positions in new markets 
the future accent will be more 
orientated towards development 
of brands and industry verticals in 
order to support our aim for industry 
leadership in certain sectors. This 
could also involve running exhibitions 
in established Western markets where 
there is synergy with our exhibitions 
in our existing markets. While we plan 
to continue our diversification efforts 
in our key emerging and developing 
markets with good prospects, we are 
also increasing our focus on expanding 
industry verticals.
Four priorities underpin ITE’s strategy: 
1. Improve its existing positions of 
market leadership; 
2. Expand into new sectors and 
geographies with potential for 
strong market positions; 
3. Enhance and improve our 
exhibition brands; 
4. Invest in developing our people. Strategic report Governance Financial statements
 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

ITE’s performance against its strategic 
priorities is set out below:
(i) Improve on existing positions of 
market leadership:
ITE’s existing positions of market 
leadership are founded on its ability 
to generate international sales, its 
recognised brands, its local office 
infrastructure and its long-standing 
relationships with venues.
International sales strength 
ITE’s ability to generate international 
sales has differentiated it from its 
local competition in Russia and the 
related CIS markets. The same pattern 
is also true of China and South East 
Asia, with international participation 
and content being key differentiators 
for pricing and position. The Group 
has established a loyal customer 
base and a geographic reach, which 
is increasingly valuable as it seeks to 
leverage its sales into new markets. 
In 2014 the Group’s international sales 
offices once again sold 132,000m
2
 
which represents circa 25% of the 
Group’s 2014 revenues. Approximately 
13% of revenues were sold by the 
Group’s London office, and 4% by 
each of its German, Chinese and 
Turkish offices. 
ITE’s international brands
ITE has established strong brand 
identities in certain exhibition sectors. 
In particular, the Build brand in 
construction, the Oil & Gas events 
brand, the ITE Travel exhibition and 
World Food brands all have strong 
reputations with customers as leading 
events in the Russian and CIS markets 
earned through more than 15 years of 
sustained good performance. There 
are also new initiatives this year to 
enhance and develop brands in the 
Oil & Gas, Transport, Travel & Tourism, 
Food and Security portfolios. 
Local office infrastructure 
ITE’s brands have built their reputation 
through sustained delivery of 
successful exhibitions to customers. 
The foundation of this is in ITE’s local 
offices which now employ over 900 
staff. Local offices generate the 
local sales, reputation and visitor 
participation of the event as well as 
managing technical staging of the 
exhibitions. Critically they own and 
develop the database of local visitors 
who make the exhibition successful 
for the exhibitors. In its core markets, 
ITE’s local offices have always been 
a competitive advantage over other 
international exhibition organisers and 
a barrier to entry for new organisers 
wishing to run events. ITE will continue 
to develop strong local offices as 
part of its exhibition business in new 
markets. The Group has an integration 
programme for new offices acquired 
into the ITE network and is increasing 
its investment in the infrastructure that 
underpins these offices and in staff 
training. The Group has high rates of 
employee retention in its offices, and 
supports this by its commitment to 
having widespread equity ownership 
– currently 54% of staff participate 
in some form of equity scheme. 
Venue relationships
ITE has always enjoyed long-standing 
relationships with the venues that 
host its exhibitions. In its core markets 
ITE has supported the development 
of venue facilities which in turn has 
helped the Group’s exhibitions to 
prosper. The Group has always sought 
to establish rights to run its main 
exhibition themes in its partner venues 
at the time of its choice and ITE has 
continued to work on maintaining 
and improving the venue relationships 
that underpin its business. Most of 
ITE’s major events have agreements 
which provide for venue facilities for 
at least three years ahead. 
(ii) Expand into new sectors and 
geographies with potential for strong 
market positions:
In existing markets this strategy means 
targeting new sectors and regions in 
which to acquire or develop exhibitions 
where there is potential for the 
participation of international exhibitors. 
In new markets, ITE is targeting the 
development of exhibition businesses 
where there is clear opportunity for 
strong future growth. 
This year the Group has continued 
to expand its business presence into 
Turkey, South East Asia and China. 
In so doing it has acquired expertise 
in new sectors – some of which has 
potential in ITE’s core markets, and 
also made it possible for the Group 
to run its existing brands in the new 
markets The acquisition of Beauty 
Eurasia in Turkey has strengthened 
the opportunity for ITE to build a 
series of events in the Beauty and 
personal care sector. Indonesia is a 
market with potential for expansion 
of the exhibition business and in 
acquiring Indobuildtech, ITE is well 
positioned to build a presence in this 
market and the Group is working to 
ensure that Indobuildtech benefits 
from being part of the Build brand 
and that best practice is shared. The 
Group plans to extend the Chinacoat 
brand into South East Asia, and is 
reviewing opportunities to leverage 
the brand strength elsewhere.
As the Group’s acquisition activity 
over the last few years has opened 
up access to new markets, there are 
now increasing synergies and benefits 
to be gained from strengthening 
its industry portfolio in each sector. 
The Group aims to increasingly focus 
its acquisition activity on building 
portfolio strength and leadership in 
exhibition sectors – creating stronger 
more defensible business positioning 
for its exhibitions.  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Strategic report
(iii) Enhance our exhibition brands: 
The Group’s management has been 
working to improve the strength of 
ITE’s existing international brands. 
The acquisition of Beauty Eurasia 
has strengthened the opportunity 
for ITE to build an internationally 
recognised brand in the Beauty and 
personal care sector. This is being 
supported by introducing product 
improvements to enhance customer 
experience and ensuring consistency 
in the presentation and promotion 
of similar events in ITE’s vertical 
industry sectors. The Group’s brand 
development projects have covered 
all aspects of product quality, naming, 
character, tone-of-voice and graphic 
designs associated with events in 
the Group’s largest portfolios. The 
improvements will deliver numerous 
benefits, including increasing the 
global recognition of ITE’s brands 
and enabling the Group to launch 
events into new territories. 
(iv) Invest in developing our people:
The Group has continued its 
programme of developing the strength 
and depth of the leadership and 
management teams in the year as well 
as improving communications between 
offices. Current initiatives include 
a developing talent management 
programme focusing on the Group’s 
most promising employees which 
sets out development plans to 
enable them to grow into future 
leaders. In addition we continue 
to run a Leadership Development 
Programme for our senior managers, 
and a rolling programme of cross-
Group development conferences. 
Communications have continued to 
improve, with a high level of employee 
engagement via the intranet, the 
newsletter and through co-operation 
in cross border industry groups. 
ITE is evolving its strategic priorities 
by which it seeks to achieve its overall 
objectives. The Group has been 
successful in establishing positions 
in new markets and the future accent 
will be more orientated towards 
development of brands and industry 
verticals in order to develop industry 
leadership in certain sectors. This may 
involve running exhibitions in both 
emerging and established markets 
where there is synergy with the 
Group’s existing portfolio of events.

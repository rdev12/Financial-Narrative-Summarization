 Taylor Woodrow operates a portfolio of 
housing businesses in selected markets in the
UK, North America, Spain and Gibraltar, which
account for 98 per cent of our operating profits.
In addition to building new homes, we also 
have expertise in mixed-use development 
and construction, which help to support our
development of sustainable new communities.
Chief Executive’s Review 
It also enables us to mitigate the
impact of any short-term weakness 
in any particular market or sub-market.
Consequently, as the markets in Arizona,
California and Florida started to weaken
in 2005, we were able to reduce our
planned land spend in North America
for 2006 and allocate additional funding
to our UK Housing business.
Each business is targeted to:
• Deliver high-quality homes in which 
our customers want to live;
• Use capital efficiently;
• Identify and manage risk effectively;
• Deploy effective and disciplined 
processes and systems, which 
encourage continuous improvement 
and support ‘right first time’ results;
• Work closely with supply chain 
partners to improve the way in 
which business is conducted; 
• Recruit, retain and develop high-
quality staff.
Strategic priorities
The Group’s key strategic priorities 
are to:
• Improve operating margins and 
returns on capital from our UK 
Housing business;
• Deliver competitive operating profit
margins and return on capital in
North America, whilst positioning 
the business for growth as market
conditions allow;
• Consolidate stable performance from 
our business in Spain and Gibraltar, 
whilst building a platform for future 
growth; 
• Grow the profits of our Construction
business, while managing risk
effectively.
Structure and strategy
Our aim is to be the homebuilder 
of choice. Our primary business is 
the development of sustainable
communities of high-quality homes 
in selected markets in the UK, North
America, Spain and Gibraltar. We seek
to add shareholder value through 
the achievement of profitable growth 
and effective capital management. 
Our performance in delivering total
shareholder return can be seen on
page 40.
We are a national homebuilder in the
UK. In the United States we operate 
in Arizona, California, Florida and Texas.
We also build in Ontario, Canada. 
Our operations in Spain are focused on
the popular holiday destinations of the
Costa Blanca, Costa del Sol and Mallorca.
Operating a portfolio of housing
businesses allows us to allocate our
capital where we see the best
opportunities for risk-adjusted returns.

Monitoring our performance
Operating margin is
calculated using profit from
operations (excluding joint
ventures’ interest and tax) and
revenue (including that of joint
ventures). Please see Note 3
of the Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 56 for
further information. This
measure represents the
profitability of our operations.
Return on average capital
employed (ROACE) is
calculated using profit from
operations (excluding joint
ventures’ interest and tax) 
and capital employed 
(pre-goodwill). This measure
indicates how efficiently the
business is using its capital 
to generate profits.
Gearing is calculated as net
debt divided by shareholders’
funds and represents the 
level of borrowing within the
business.
Home completions include
sales from within joint ventures,
which are counted as a
proportion of a unit in line 
with the percentage of the
joint venture owned by 
Taylor Woodrow.
The order book represents
future business, consisting 
of houses or lots reserved 
or amounts yet to be invoiced
on construction contracts.
Landbank indicates the
‘stock’ available for new
housing, for which planning
consent has been received.
Some of the landbank is
owned outright, whilst other
plots are controlled through
options.
Customer satisfaction is
measured by each of our
businesses through the use 
of customer surveys. The way
in which these surveys are
conducted and the questions
that they contain vary by
business.
Results
Consolidated revenue for the year 
to 31 December 2006 was up 3 per
cent at £3,572.1m (2005: £3,476.9m).
Profit before tax was £405.6m (2005:
£411 .0m).
At 31 December 2006, total equity
before minority interests was £2,103.5m
(2005: £1,928.4m). Net debt was
£391 .3m (2005: £456.9m). Net gearing
was 18.6 per cent (2005: 23.7 per cent).
Basic earnings per share was 50.5
pence (2005: 50.6 pence). Equity
shareholders’ funds per share increased
by 7 .8 per cent to 364.7 pence.
Group housing has had a good year,
with our North American business
reporting another year of record profits.
Revenue increased to £3,128.4m
(2005: £2,864.9m), reflecting an
increase in both home and lot
completions. Profits from operations
were higher than last year, at £469.2m,
as the increase in completions
outweighed the reduction in overall
Group housing operating margin.
Some 53 per cent of 2006 Group
housing profit from operations* came
from overseas operations (2005: 49 per
cent). This reflects our decision to
increase investment into those markets
over the last few years.
The Group housing landbank (owned
and controlled) was reduced to 68,662 
plots (2005: 75,160), as a result of our
more cautious approach to land buying
in North America. The Group housing
order book stood at £1,070m 
(2005: £1,318m), with a decrease 
in North America offsetting increases 
in the UK and Spain.
*Throughout the Chief Executive's Review, profit from operations and operating margins 
exclude joint ventures' interest and tax (see Note 3, page 56). The Group’s share of joint 
venture revenue is used in the margin calculation (see Note 3, page 56).

Grand Union Village is a £130 million redevelopment of a 54 acre
brownfield site in West London into a mixed use, sustainable urban
village, set alongside the Grand Union Canal. 
When complete, over 800 homes, including apartments and family
homes, will be provided as well as a new canal basin known as
Engineer’s Wharf. A Community Development Trust, set up and part
funded by Taylor Woodrow, is now actively involving residents in the
creation and management of community facilities provided at the site.
The development was recognised with a Prince’s Foundation award in
February 2007 for creating a community design that has helped to
improve the quality of life for the people who live there.

2006 saw a return to more stable
market conditions in the UK. There
was, however, considerable regional
variation in the strength of markets.
London and the South-East were
particularly strong while the Midlands
and North remained subdued. Overall
visitor levels per site per week were 
up 12 per cent on 2005 and we also
saw an increase in the reservation rate
to 0.83 homes per site per week (2005:
0.81). Cancellation rates have also
improved, with the 2006 level of 17 per
cent being broadly in line with the long-
run industry average (2005: 20 per cent).
We have increased our average
number of active sites in 2006 to 207
(2005: 204). Home completions for 
the year were up 1 per cent to 8,294
(2005: 8,178) and we entered 2007
with an order book up by 30 per cent
to £534m (2005: £411m).
Average selling prices were higher at
£193k (2005: £185k). An increase in the
underlying price per square foot offset
the slight reduction in average square
footage of our homes from 960 sq ft 
to 952 sq ft. The latter was a result of
an increase in the proportion of social
housing completions to 15 per cent
(2005: 13 per cent) and the proportion
of apartment completions to 45 per
cent (2005: 40 per cent). 
UK Housing revenue increased by 11 .8
per cent, driven by the increases in
home completions and average selling
prices. Operating margins* were lower
at 12.0 per cent (2005: 14.2 per cent).
Results in 2005 benefited from a
higher level of land profits, primarily
due to the disposal of the Quartermile
project in Edinburgh. Revenue from
land sales in 2006 was £194.6m (2005:
£134.4m) and yielded lower profits and
margins than in 2005, due to an increased
proportion of recently-acquired land in
the mix. This is a result of our strategy
of acquiring large sites and selling on
those parcels of land that we do not
require for our homebuilding business.
Return on average capital employed for
the year was 14.0 per cent (2005: 15.2
per cent).
Our operating margin has declined in
2006, and consequently growth in margin
is the long-term key focus of our UK
Management. We are preparing a
number of new measures to extract
greater value from our sites. These will
complement our ongoing activity to
better manage cost:

• Increasing the proportion of our 
homes that are built using our core 
range, which provides customers 
with the choice that they need, 
whilst also enabling us to achieve 
lower build costs;
• Further developing our ‘right 
first time’ approach to reduce
maintenance costs and increase
customer satisfaction; 
• Increasing build process efficiency.
We will be providing an update on our
progress with these initiatives when
we announce our interim results on 
31 July 2007 .
Our Supply Chain team works to deliver
value throughout the build process.
Their skills were recognised by the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply when Taylor Woodrow’s Supplier
Management Solution won the award
for ‘Best Use of Technology’ in 2006.
We continue to make good progress
with our strategic landbank, which
represents land that does not currently
have planning consent. Having
identified a site with strategic potential
we will typically agree a purchase
option arrangement with the landowner
and then work together to promote 
the land through the planning process.
Such options generally provide us with
the ability to purchase the land at a
discount to market value when suitable
planning consents are obtained. 
Sites brought through from the
strategic landbank typically generate
higher margins than those bought 
in the open market with a planning
consent in place. During 2006, 22 per
cent of our home completions were
strategically sourced (2005: 19 per
cent) and we aim to increase this to 
25 per cent of our completions by
2008. At the end of 2006 we had
79,000 potential plots within our
strategic landbank (2005: 80,000) and
39 per cent of the land in our landbank
originally came from strategic sources
(2005: 41 per cent).
10 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
The quality of the landbank is critical 
to delivering growth in future years. 
As well as the strength of the strategic
land outlined above, we have
maintained our investment in the 
UK landbank during 2006. As a result,
our year end landbank stood at 34,827
plots owned or controlled, broadly in
line with the position a year ago. This
represents 4.2 years of supply.
We are committed to developing
communities where people want to 
live, rather than just building a collection
of houses. For example, The Green
Building at Macintosh Village in
Manchester won the Civic Trust
Sustainability Award for its urban design
and use of materials. 
Customer satisfaction is a key priority
and our efforts in this area are reflected
in the improvements to our customer
satisfaction score. In 2006, the score
for our UK Housing business rose to 78
per cent (2005: 75 per cent).

14 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Above: Senna Hill, Austin, Texas, USA at the start of the year were converted
into completions. Return on average
capital employed has reduced from 
the wholly exceptional levels achieved
last year, but still represents a very
strong result.
We entered 2006 with a record order
book of US$1,421m as a result of our
focus on pre-selling. Our order book 
of US$854m at the end of 2006
reflected the weaker market conditions
experienced during the year. 
We have been more cautious in the
land market in 2006, as land prices
adjusted downwards to reflect the
market conditions. Much of our land is
acquired under option initially and only
bought outright once planning consents
are in place. We carefully review the
terms of each option as it becomes
exercisable and, where terms are no
longer attractive due to changes in
market conditions, we approach the
land vendor to renegotiate. In many
instances we have managed to
improve terms, but there have also
been cases where we have allowed
options to lapse. We have undertaken 
a full review of our year-end land
positions which, in conjunction with
deposits on options not taken up, has
resulted in a pre-tax land write-off of
US$40m.
While we have continued to buy land
through our existing portfolio of
options, we have been very selective 
in replacing options during 2006. As 
a result, our landbank at the year end
stood at 31,353 plots (2005: 37 ,910
plots). This represents 4.4 years of
supply and allows us to continue to be
selective in our land purchasing in 2007 .
While short-term market prospects 
are difficult, commentators are united
in the belief that a recovery will occur.
There is very significant potential for
Taylor Woodrow in North America in
the medium-term. Our home
completions in North America are just
over a half of our completions in the UK
for 2006, but the Florida market alone 
is larger than the entire UK market.
Our business in Arizona, which is
focused on the Phoenix market, has
been tremendously successful since it
was acquired in 2002. Having originally
been centred on entry-level homes, the
business has been diversifying into the
mid-market and during 2006 launched 
a new product range, targeting growing
families and executive buyers. We
completed 1,245 homes in Arizona in
2006 (2005: 1,009) at an average selling
price of US$287k (2005: US$209k). The
business is also a highly successful
land developer, buying larger tracts of
land, identifying the plots that best suit
our product and selling on the remaining
plots to other builders. During the year
we completed the sale of 1,171 lots
(2005: 1,076). Whilst the market in
Arizona cooled during 2006, the long-
term fundamentals of population growth,
job growth and relative affordability
remain in place.

The Summit Collection at Shamrock

markets. In the North, our business 
is focused on the lower end of the 
mid-market in the San Francisco Bay
area. In Southern California we build 
in selected sub-markets from Riverside
and San Bernardino Counties
southwards to San Diego and eastwards
towards Palm Springs. Californian
markets in general weakened
significantly during 2006, primarily due
to interest rate rises and affordability
issues. However, our focus on the 
mid-market and providing high-quality
homes allows us to offer an attractive
proposition to our customers. During
the year we completed the sale of 
540 homes (2005: 721 homes) at an
average selling price of US$812k 
(2005: US$835k). We also achieved 156 
lot completions (2005: 378).
We operate from three divisions in
Florida. Our Central Florida division
covers the areas around St Petersburg,
Tampa, Bradenton and Sarasota. 
In South-East Florida we operate in the
Palm Beach area, whilst in South-West
Florida we are focused on the markets
between Fort Myers and Naples. 
We offer a wide range, from middle
market to luxury homes and
condominiums, targeted to move-up
families, retirees, and second home
purchasers. The Florida market has also
experienced more difficult conditions
following a number of years of very
strong house price appreciation. 
Home completions in 2006 were 835
(2005: 752) at an average selling price
of US$653k (2005: US$727k). Our land
development business in Florida is
primarily centred around our large-scale
developments, where we sell lots to
other homebuilders. In 2006 we
completed the sale of 499 lots (2005:
219 lots).
Our operations in Texas are active in
both Austin and Houston. These
markets did not experience the price
growth of other US regions in recent
years and are proving more stable
while other markets weaken. They offer 
good levels of affordability, particularly
in comparison to the western United
States. We have a strong reputation 
in Texas as a high-quality community
developer, which enables us to target
the ‘move-up’ market. We offer our
customers a range of innovative home
designs that deliver ‘affordable luxury’.
Home completions increased to 280
(2005: 190) with average sales prices 
up 5 per cent to US$447k (2005:
US$424k). We also have a strong 
land development business in Texas,
centred on our community at Steiner
Ranch in Austin. We completed on 306
lots in 2006 (2005: 353).
In Ontario, Canada, the group trades
under the Monarch brand which
benefits from a long-standing reputation
for quality and value. Operating in the
Greater Toronto Area and in Ottawa in
Eastern Ontario, Monarch builds 
low-rise, mid-market family homes 
Chief Executive’s Review continued
and high-rise condominiums as well 
as affordable, urban townhomes. The
Ontario market has not seen significant
house price inflation over recent years
and retains a good level of affordability.
In addition, the market was assisted by
the reduction in the level of Canadian
Goods and Services Tax during the
year. Completions in 2006 were 1,592
homes (2005: 1,260). The average sales
price was Can$322k (2005: Can$326k).
We also sell lots in Canada and
completed 508 during 2006 (2005: 709).
The continuing success of our business
in North America is a result of our
focus on high-quality developments,
professional finishes, and exceptional
customer service. In October 2006,
Taylor Woodrow received the honour 
of being the first homebuilder ever to
be inducted into the Builder Magazine
‘Hall of Fame for Design Excellence’. 
This prestigious award recognises
outstanding contributions to residential
design.
Our North America divisions are
consistently recognised by customers
and industry peers, winning some of
the most sought-after awards in the
business. In particular, our Arizona
division received five awards at ‘The
Nationals’ Awards 2006, recognising
Taylor Woodrow’s contribution to
innovation in home design, marketing
and sales.

We sold a total of 379 homes in 2006
(2005: 406) at an average selling price
of £205k (2005: £169k). This increase 
in average selling price reflects a
change in the mix of completions, with
a higher proportion of completions in
2006 coming from our developments in
Mallorca. We also took the opportunity
during the year to rebalance the land
portfolio by selling some of our holding
in the Malaga area.
Operating margins and returns on
capital have remained strong, albeit
below the exceptional levels achieved
in recent years.
The order book increased 23 per cent
to £100m (2005: £81m) and our year-
end landbank stood at 2,482 plots, up 
10 per cent (2005: 2,265).
The disappointing reduction in our
customer satisfaction score
predominantly results from difficulties
in obtaining habitation certificates, as
high levels of development activity
have put pressure on local town halls.
Construction
Our Construction business has
developed an excellent reputation within
its chosen markets focusing on repeat
work for blue chip clients, facilities
management, infrastructure and
government projects. This excellence
has once again been recognised with 
a number of industry awards in 2006,
including being named Building
magazine’s ‘Major Contractor of the
Year’ and winner of the overall
‘Constructing Excellence’ award. Profit
from operations* was £8.1m (2005:
£8.8m) and our increased order book 
of £1,165m at the year end (2005:
£707m) provides us with a solid
platform for 2007 .
During the year we have undertaken
projects ranging from the redevelopment
of the ticket hall at Kings Cross
Underground Station in London to the
design and build of the National
Assembly for Wales in Cardiff. We have
recently commenced work on the 
St Helens and Knowsley Hospitals PFI
Scheme and are also preferred bidder
on the Sheffield ‘Building Schools for the
Future’ programme. We achieved a
customer satisfaction score of 87 per
cent in 2006 (2005: 91 per cent).
Principal risks and uncertainties
As with any business, Taylor Woodrow
faces a number of risks and
uncertainties in the course of its 
day-to-day operations. By effectively
identifying and managing these risks,
we are able to improve our returns
thereby adding value for shareholders.
Economic and market environment
Customer demand is dependent upon
underlying economic conditions, such
as interest rates, unemployment levels
and general consumer confidence,
which are outside the Group’s control.

Our business in Spain trades under the
Taylor Woodrow brand and is primarily
focused on developing sites in popular
holiday destinations. Where we identify
appropriate opportunities, we also 
build homes designed to meet the
requirements of the local population.
In Gibraltar, Taylor Woodrow serves 
the luxury market through apartment
developments, selling off-plan well 
in advance of the start of construction.
After a strong performance in 2005, we
saw our markets in the Costa Blanca
and Costa del Sol slowing during 
2006. However, the market in Mallorca
continues to be good as a result of the
limited supply to meet the demand for Los Balcones, Los Arqueros Golf and
Country Club, Marbella, Spain  The impact of these factors on the
Group’s sales is mitigated to a degree
by operating in different geographic
markets, which may exhibit different
economic conditions at any particular
point in time.
We use the detailed knowledge of 
our local teams to select the locations
for our communities and the
appropriate home designs to meet
customer demand. We minimise the
level of speculative build that we
undertake by opening a sales office 
and showhomes at an early stage 
of development. Our selective use of
part-exchange has proved successful 
in making the process of buying a
home easier for our customers.
Planning system
The number of homes that we are able
to build in the course of a financial year
is dependent on the granting of suitable
planning permissions. Due to the time
taken to obtain planning permissions
on land, we hold a landbank to provide
greater certainty of the number of plots
available to be developed in the
following 12 months. We also look to
use option contracts to control land,
with ownership not being taken until
planning is more certain.
Delays to the expected timescale for
receipt of planning on a site may result
in a reduction in the number of homes
that we have available for sale.
Planners may also impose conditions
within planning consents, which may
lead to additional costs of developing 
a site. Our land specialists mitigate
these risks by working closely with 
the relevant planning authorities and
through the structure of land purchase
agreements.
In the UK, planning permissions can be
very specific, including the density, types
of housing and availability of car parking
spaces. If the views of the planners do
not coincide with our customers’
aspirations there will be an impact on
demand for our product. We work closely
with the government, both directly
and as a member of industry groups, 
to highlight such potential issues.
Land purchasing
Land is the major ‘raw material’ for the
Group and, as such, overpaying for land
would have a detrimental impact on our
profitability. To mitigate this risk, we
operate an investment appraisal process
for all significant land purchases, with
approval required from our Investment
Committee prior to such purchases
being completed. The Investment
Committee reviews the key information
on which bids are based and ensures
that projects meet our internal hurdle
rates for operating margin and return
on average capital employed.
Availability of sub-contractors
The vast majority of the work carried
out on site is performed by sub-
contractors. If they are not able to
Chief Executive’s Review continued
20 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006 recruit sufficient numbers of skilled
employees, our developments may
suffer from delays or quality issues.
We vet all suppliers thoroughly prior 
to working with them to ensure 
that they meet our requirements for
environmental impact, health and
safety, quality and financial stability. 
We also play our part in addressing 
the skills shortage in the building
industry through apprenticeship
schemes and membership of the
Construction Industry Training Board.
Availability of materials
The key materials used within our
operations, such as bricks, blocks,
concrete, steel and timber, are in heavy
demand across the world. Changing
patterns of construction demand due to
factors ranging from changes in public
sector construction programmes to
natural disasters can have an influence
on the availability of such materials.
Our vetting process ensures that
materials are responsibly sourced from
financially stable suppliers and meet
our requirements for health, safety and
quality. We work closely with our key
supply chain partners, providing
forecasts of our demand to assist with
ensuring the availability of supply.
Site safety
Building sites are inherently dangerous
places. We recognise our responsibility
to provide our workforce with a safe
place of work and have a team of 
in-house Health and Safety specialists
who provide training and site reviews.
As detailed later in this review, we 
have a strong commitment to Health and
Safety, but we are continually looking
for ways to make further improvements.
Construction process
Construction, both of homes and other
projects, can be subject to delays 
and cost over-runs arising for a wide
variety of reasons. These include

adverse ground conditions, changes 
to the original design once build has
commenced and unfavourable weather.
We target selectively the type of 
work that we bid for, choosing not to
participate in projects where we
consider that the risks are too great.
We maintain detailed risk registers,
ensuring that risks are identified, 
priced or hedged and approved at the
appropriate level before taking on a
project. These registers are maintained
throughout the life of the project and
reviewed following the completion 
of the job to identify any key learning
points for future projects. We also
actively promote developments in
areas such as off-site manufacturing
which have the potential to reduce 
the risk of delay. The Calders Green development near Weston, sits in 
the middle of some of the most beautiful parkland that
Cheshire has to offer. It is a gated development of family
homes and apartments in a setting of lakes, streams 
and trees. 
22 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Above: Calders Green, Crewe, Cheshire, England Sustainability and the environment
Taylor Woodrow is committed to
continuous improvement in the design
and construction of new homes and
enhancing the built environment for
people who live in and near its new
communities, both now and in the
future. In order to measure our progress
against this aim, we focus on four key
areas of sustainability.
Urban regeneration is a major part of
our business, transforming areas of land
that are often derelict and sometimes
contaminated into desirable places to
live. During 2006 we commenced work
on Telford Millennium Community, which
will include up to 800 highly sustainable
homes along with associated
community, education and commercial
facilities on the site of a former colliery.
In 2006, 63 per cent of our UK homes
and 21 per cent of our North American
homes were developed on brownfield
(previously developed) land (2005: UK:
68 per cent, North America: 17 per
cent). Our Construction business also
undertakes regeneration projects and 
is currently working with Sandwell
Homes to deliver a five year package of
repairs and improvements to homes
across six towns in the West Midlands.
As the cost of buying a new home in
the UK continues to increase,
affordable housing (homes built for
registered social landlords or as part of
Key Worker programmes) is becoming
an increasing part of our business. 
We have developed a reputation for
delivering high-quality affordable
housing, making us a partner of choice
for housing associations. Affordable
housing increased as a proportion of
our business from 13 per cent in 2005
to 15 per cent in 2006.
Around 25 per cent of the UK’s carbon
dioxide emissions, a major cause of
climate change, come from the energy
that people use to heat, light and run
their homes. During the year we
commissioned thermal photography 
to compare the energy efficiency of
brand new and second-hand homes.
The results showed that new homes
are significantly more energy efficient
than those built twenty or thirty years
ago. The average SAP (Standard
Assessment Procedure) rating for our
UK homes was 97 in 2006 (2005: 98),
against a maximum possible score 
of 120.
Taylor Woodrow has also taken a
leading role in the deployment of the
EcoHomes scheme (an environmental
assessment method for house building
and refurbishment). In 2006, 950 of our
homes were certified to EcoHomes
standards representing 11 per cent of
our total UK completions (2005: 736, 
9 per cent). 
As a major homebuilder we have a
responsibility to play a major role in the
sustainability debate. As such, we
contributed to the consultation on the
UK Government’s draft Code for
Sustainable Homes and held our first
sustainability conference.
We closely monitor the environmental
performance of our business and have
continuous improvement initiatives
underway in three key areas:
• We successfully reduced the average
amount of construction waste
generated per UK home to 32.1 cu. yds
and the associated cost of disposal to
£291 (2005: 39.6 cu. yds and £351);
• We reduced the carbon dioxide
emissions from our UK operations
(including those generated during the
construction process, by our offices
and showhomes and by our company
vehicle fleet) from an estimated
20,204 tonnes in 2005 to an
estimated 19,034 tonnes in 2006; 
• We received a reduced total number 
of environmental prosecutions, 
notices and incidents during the year 
of 19 (2005: 29).
Sustainability and environmental issues
are becoming increasingly important in
North America and we have a number
of initiatives underway in our different
regions. For instance, our Florida
business has implemented a recycling
programme at its Palma Sola Trace
community, which has successfully
increased the amount of waste
material that is recycled or reused.
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006 23
Community
Taylor Woodrow has a long history 
of contributing to local communities
through voluntary projects and other
activities. We set ourselves the
objective of further developing our
community programmes during 2006.
Examples of our work with
communities in the UK include:
• Our ongoing relationship with the 
charity Barnardo’s through our 
‘Building Futures’ partnership, 
through which team members raised
£11,447 for their local Barnardo’s 
projects (2005: £4,913). Many other 
company events raised additional 
funding for Barnardo’s of £26,000 
(2005: £19,200);
• Continuing our ‘Support the Team’ 
programme, we donated £28,959 
to match team members’ charitable 
fund-raising efforts (2005: 35,918);
• Rolling out our ‘Community in the 
Curriculum’ initiative to schools 
neighbouring our developments in 
Scotland and the West Midlands; 
• Developing policies for a company-
wide process for community 
consultation.
Our team in North America has a
strong culture of community
participation, which was further
enhanced during 2006. Examples of
the team’s contributions include:
• Team members from Texas raised 
more than $50,000 in walks 
benefiting the Juvenile Diabetes 
Research Foundation;
• Our team in Southern California 
raised more than $25,000 for 
HomeAid Orange County, a non-
profit organisation that helps build 
and renovate shelters for the 
transitionally homeless men, women,
and children in the community; 
• The Arizona division hosted an 
‘Easter Egg-Stravaganza’ for 
residents of one of its communities, 
which was attended by over 100 
residents with their children. More 
than 1,000 eggs were hidden, with 
prizes including gift certificates, toys 
and bicycles. 2006

Employees
The development of effective teams is
vital to our company. We are committed
to recruiting and retaining a talented
team that is motivated and focused to
deliver and exceed our business
objectives. This commitment is
supported by regular benchmarking of
our remuneration and benefits packages. 
We respect the rights of our people.
We promote:
• Good and safe conditions of work;
• The development and best use of 
talent;
• Equal opportunity employment; 
• Involvement of our people in the
planning and direction of their work.
We strive to make our project sites and
our offices safe working environments.
Our objective is to improve safety
performance through awareness
raising, monitoring and incentivisation. 
In the UK we have a programme of
active monitoring for site safety and
project performance is linked to bonus
schemes for site managers and senior
managers. During 2006 we conducted:
• 1,382 site inspections, which 
measure how well our project teams 
are implementing Health and Safety 
management (2005: 1,212); 
• 326 safety management audits, 
which measure how well our project 
teams have planned the management
of Health and Safety (2005: 342).
We have been recognised for our
leadership position within the sector. In
2006 our UK Housing and Construction
businesses each received Gold Awards
from the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents. During 2006
our accident frequency rate was 0.34
accidents per 100,000 man hours
(2005: 0.34).
In North America, we conduct
independent Health and Safety audits
of all construction sites twice a year
and set continuous improvement
targets. The results of the 2006 audits
were very good, with average scores of
93 per cent exceeding the target of 88
per cent.
Our Spanish business has achieved
certification to the occupational Health
and Safety management standard
18001 . The standard has been
successfully audited by Lloyds Register
and is being promoted to our
contractors and suppliers.
Despite the good progress made in
advancing the quality of our safety
management processes, we are deeply
saddened to report three fatalities in
our operations during the year.
We are committed to keeping our
employees informed of developments
within the business. Internal
communication methods include
weekly news bulletins, regular team
Chief Executive’s Review continued
24 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
briefings and frequent opportunities to
meet senior management face-to-face.
We undertake regular employee
surveys and benchmark the responses
against both previous results and
industry standards. Our 2006 survey
showed that 79 per cent of our
employees would recommend Taylor
Woodrow to others as a good place 
to work, an improvement on the 2004
figure of 74 per cent.
Our people are a key strength of our
business and their skills have once
again been recognised in industry
awards. Jerry Williams from our
Construction business was named
‘Project Manager of the Year’ for the
National Assembly for Wales at the
Chartered Institute of Building awards.
12 of our UK Housing site managers
received NHBC ‘Seal of Excellence’
Awards, with three winning ‘Regional
Awards’ and going through to the
overall UK final. Steve Vorres received
the NHBC UK Supreme Award, in the
multi-storey category, for the second
year running for our Victoria Wharf
development in Cardiff.

At 31 December 2006, the gross IAS19
deficit was £206m (2005: £220m). Net
of deferred tax, the deficit was £144m
(2005: £154m). Further information is
contained in Note 20 on page 68.
The company has now completed
discussions with the trustees of the
main defined benefit pension scheme
in the UK on the means of mitigating
this deficit. As we announced at our
Interim Results, the company has
agreed to increase its past service
deficit funding payments from £4.8m
per annum to £20m per annum for a
period of 10 years. This increase impacts
on cashflow but profit from operations
will not be affected. Also in line with
our previous announcement, the fund
was closed to future accrual for existing
members on 1 December 2006.
Equity shareholders’ funds
At the end of 2006, shareholders’ funds
were £2,103.5m, up from £1,928.4m at
the end of 2005. Equity shareholders’
funds per ordinary share rose to 364.7
pence at the end of 2006. This
represents an increase of 7 .8 per cent
from the previous year-end.
Shareholders' returns
Basic earnings per share stood at 
50.5 pence (2005: 50.6 pence). The
proposed final dividend of 9.75 pence
produces a total return of 14.75 pence
per ordinary share, an increase of 10
per cent over last year. This level of
dividend is consistent with the Board’s
policy of paying progressive dividends
through the business cycle.
The dividend is covered 3.4 times 
by earnings.
Cash flow and net debt
Operating cashflows before movements
in working capital were £460.9m (2005:
£461 .1m). Inventories increased by
£347 .5m which was partly funded by an
increase in creditors of £17 4.4m. Of this
26 Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2006
Chief Executive’s Review continued
latter increase, £131 .1m is represented 
by an increase in land creditors. Cash
generated by operations was £223.3m
(2005: £359.7m). Income taxes and
interest payments totalled £166.3m
(2005: £229.5m), resulting in net cash
from operating activities of £57 .0m
(2005:£130.2m).
Net debt at the year-end stood at
£391 .3m (2005: £456.9m) equivalent to
net gearing of 18.6 per cent (2005: 23.7
per cent). Interest on borrowings, net of
interest receivable was £55.0m (2005:
£54.4m). Average net debt for the year
was £837 .8m (2005: £823.4m). At the
year-end Taylor Woodrow had undrawn
committed revolving credit facilities
totalling £629.5m.

waterside park areas will also be created.
The scheme consists mainly of apartments,
along with a number of three-storey
townhouses. The development has launched
successfully. With an in-depth knowledge of the
markets in which we operate, we are
well-placed to benefit from any land
acquisition opportunities that market

Ian Smith
Chief Executive
19 February 2007
Prospects for 2007
Our geographic portfolio of businesses
continues to provide us with alternative
investment and growth options.
The UK Housing market remains good.
Underlying fundamentals are strong
due to the continuing significant
undersupply of new housing. Whilst
Government is committed to introducing
policies that will increase the availability
of land for development, we have not
yet seen any increase in supply. Despite
strong price appreciation during 2006,
there were wide regional variations and
customer confidence could be damaged
in some of the weaker markets if
further interest rate rises materialise 
in 2007 . We anticipate an increase in
the number of home completions
during 2007 and will continue to focus
on improving our operating margins.
In North America, although the markets
in Arizona, California and parts of Florida
remain challenging and difficult to predict,
current market conditions in Texas 
and Ontario are healthy. We continue 
to be confident in the prospects for 
the business in the medium-term, but
expect to see significant reductions 
in both operating margin and return on
capital employed during 2007 . In 2007
the priority for our North American
management is to minimise the impact
of the market downturn in the short-
term, whilst taking the opportunity 
of the market downturn to position 
the business for accelerated growth 
in the future.
The market in Spain remains attractive
on a medium-term view, although any
weakness in the UK market in the
short-term could reduce demand for
property in Spain from British buyers.

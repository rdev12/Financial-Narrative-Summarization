C
onsort Medical is a specialist 
medical device manufacturer with 
more than 50 years’ experience 
serving the healthcare industry. It has two 
divisions: Bespak, based in the UK, is a 
global leader in drug delivery systems; 
and King Systems is a US leader in 
disposable products for airway 
management. Together the Group 
manufactures over 500 million devices 
every year.
In our last Annual Report, I outlined  
how the new management team had 
repositioned the business over the past 
three years, in particular investing in 
innovative new products that would 
reinvigorate the top line and drive growth. 
I am therefore very pleased to report that 
this year the Group has delivered record 
revenues and proﬁts and that our 
compound operating proﬁt growth over 
the past three years has now been 7.4%. 
The King Vision digital video laryngoscope 
has been in the market for ten months, 
and in that short time has already 
recorded higher revenues than we 
achieved with the previous laryngoscope 
product. Market feedback has been 
consistently positive, and we have  
further iterations of the King Vision in 
development. Just before the year end  
we were also able to report FDA approval 
for and market launch of the ﬁrst device  
to contain Bespak’s Integrated Dose 
Counter (IDC). The IDC represents a major 
long-term market opportunity for us, and 
it is an important milestone that it has now 
passed the FDA approval process.
During the year we added three more 
projects to the Bespak product pipeline, 
two for nasal drug delivery and one to 
design for high volume manufacture a 
nicotine delivery device that can be used 
as a substitute for tobacco cigarettes.  
Two of these contracts will involve 
handling drugs on our Kings Lynn site, 
which will take us further up the value 
chain in line with our stated strategy  
and will offer important cost beneﬁts to 
our customers.
We were also pleased to report in July 
2011 that the Group was participating in a 
further funding round for Atlas Genetics, 
a POC diagnostics company in which we 
took a 19% stake in February 2011. In this 
round, worth up to £17.5m to Atlas, we 
were joined by two global healthcare 
companies with signiﬁcant diagnostic 
interests and two leading healthcare 
investors. Their participation adds to the 
comfort that we gained during our own 
due diligence process. Atlas is making 
good progress in its development work.
We are pleased to have continued to  
grow our strong core platform businesses. 
The further diversiﬁcation into additional 
growing markets such as nasal drug 
delivery, POC diagnostics and airway 
visualisation continues to open up new 
opportunities and de-risks the portfolio.  
I believe the business is well positioned to 
deliver sustainable earnings growth in the 
future. We continue to seek to enhance 
our organic growth through selected 
acquisitions, strategic investments  
and alliances.

5 Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Governance Chief Executive’s review
it has been a very 
successful year, 
delivering record 
revenues and proﬁts 
in a challenging 
global environment
The year ended 30 
April 2012 was another 
successful one. We have 
continued to deliver 
both revenue and proﬁt 
growth to the top end of 
the market’s expectations 
whilst maintaining a 
strong balance sheet,  
with both cash and 
borrowing facilities 
available for investment  
in opportunities.
Revenues from products and services 
grew by 8% to £136.6m and operating 
proﬁts before special items increased 
by 5% to £21.5m. Proﬁt before tax and 
special items increased by 12% to £19.4m. 
The Bespak Division increased revenues 
by 12% to £93.3m and its operating proﬁt 
before special items by 17% to £18.2m. 
The respiratory business continued 
to drive strong growth, with a very 
strong product mix in valves more than 
offsetting further price reductions in a 
major device contract. Valve volumes 
increased by 12%, and included good 
growth in emerging market sales as well 
as additional business for two major 
western customers and ﬁrst sales of our 
valve into the important Chinese market. 
Device services revenues were up on 
last year with increased volumes. The 
approval of our proprietary IDC with 
Teva’s QNASL ™ product is an important 
milestone in the development of our dose 
counter franchise. We are also ramping 
up pre-approval inventory build for the 
DEV750 Dry Powder Inhaler. However, 
we have been less fortunate in achieving 
approval on time for our two injector 
programmes and two valve programmes. 
Some programme delays are the norm 
rather than the exception in a highly 
regulated industry such as ours, and we 
allow for delays to customer timelines  
in our own ﬁnancial planning. None of 
these programmes has been cancelled 
and we are conﬁdent that they will 
launch in 2013. 
Looking to the mid-term pipeline for 
Bespak, we were delighted to add Kind 
Consumer’s Oxette nicotine delivery 
device development programme and 
also two nasal drug delivery programmes 
to the portfolio. The Bespak Innovations 
team has doubled in size and is making 
encouraging progress in a number  
of areas.
King Systems experienced a challenging 
year, with constant currency revenues 
up 2% to £43.3m but operating proﬁts 
down 31% to £3.3m, although £0.9m of 
this related to an increased allocation 
of corporate overheads. Underlying 
sales of core products to end users has 
remained ﬂat in a ﬂat market, but this 
was distorted in our revenues by the 
impact of an inventory pipeline ﬁll in the 
ﬁrst half of the 2010/11 year. Revenues 
from the King Vision were encouraging 
and in line with our expectations. The 
launch in the coming years of further 
products to enhance and deepen the 
King Vision range is expected to be a 
major driver of revenue and proﬁt growth 
for the Division. We also continue to see 
good growth in Airway sales, in particular 
of our King Laryngeal Tube. Following 
the very successful commissioning of 
the Flex2 breathing circuit automation 
line this year, the manufacturing 
transformation programme is reaching 
the ﬁnal stages of execution in the 
coming year. The breathing bag and 
mask automation lines will be installed in 
the second half of this calendar year, with 
full commissioning to take place in the 
ﬁrst months of 2013. The H&M Rubber 
facility is scheduled to close around the 
end of the calendar year following a 
successful inventory build programme. 
In summary, it has been a very successful 
year, delivering record revenues 
and proﬁts in a challenging global 
environment. The strategy that we put  
in place some years ago and the 
dedication of our employees are now 
delivering results.

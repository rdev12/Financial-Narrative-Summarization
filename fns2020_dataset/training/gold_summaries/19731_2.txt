 e Substantial UK selling price increase implemented in March 2015, with a further 
increase announced for February 2016. 
Operational highlights
 e The older of the Group’s two furnaces was successfully mothballed in August, 
reducing manufacturing capacity but yielding substantial energy savings  
for 2015/16.

two forehearths, were implemented during the two-month shutdown, enabling 
further progress to be made in improving product quality.
 e In May 2015, the Group achieved BBA certification for Superwhite 34, a blowing 
wool product targeted specifically at new build housing. This product is expected 
to be of material benefit to the Company in 2015/16.

for the time being, pending further adaptations to the supplier’s plant.

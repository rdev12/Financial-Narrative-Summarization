The transition to a low-carbon world will involve major changes to 
the way we supply and use energy. This will involve a shift from dirty, 
inefficient, centralised supply of electricity to clean, smart, flexible 
decentralised generation. 
Chief Executive Peter Bance discusses the contribution that 
residential fuel cell Combined Heat and Power (‘CHP’) can make  
to this transition. 11 Ceres Power Holdings plc Annual Report 2010

1 Home Truths: A low-carbon strategy to reduce UK 
housing emissions by 80% by 2050 – University of 
Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute
Q: 
What are the key challenges facing 
the energy sector over the next 10–15 
years. What needs to be done to meet 
these challenges?
A: 
Power generation creates 24% of the 
world’s CO
2
 emissions, the largest 
man-made source, according to a 
report published by The Climate Group 
and McKinsey. The challenge is for the 
energy sector to simultaneously reduce 
carbon emissions and ensure energy 
security whilst addressing fuel poverty 
and affordability. 
To meet these challenges will require 
substantial investment in new power  
generation and in upgrading an ageing  
grid infrastructure. The estimated total 
cost of new investment required in the 
UK by 2020 to deliver the environmental 
targets, while maintaining security of 
supply, is around £200 billion.
Residential microgeneration, including 
fuel cell Combined Heat and Power 
(‘CHP’), can make a significant 
contribution to addressing these 
challenges and will complement the 
investment in large-scale centralised 
generation including intermittent 
renewable generation and base 
load nuclear. 
Q: 
Why is it important to address the 
residential sector in terms of emissions 
reductions; aren’t the big wins 
transport and large upstream  
power generation?
A: 
Housing is the biggest single energy 
efficiency prize.
In the UK, housing accounts for 27% of 
the country’s total carbon emmissions
1
, 
the largest single element. Half of the 
UK’s 26 million existing homes are more 
than half a century old and have some 
of the lowest energy efficiency ratings 
across Europe. 
With more than 80% of the houses we 
will be living in by 2050 already built
1
, 
this will require cost-effective carbon 
reduction technologies that can be 
retrofitted to the existing housing stock 
increased gas use in people’s homes 
(as electricity is generated locally 
rather than centrally), fuel cell CHP has 
the ability to reduce overall gas usage 
by ‘UK plc’ as these products make 
much more efficient use overall of the 
gas input than centralised generation. 
The capability of fuel cell CHP products 
such as Ceres Power’s unit to operate 
on a range of fuels (e.g. natural gas, 
LPG, biogas and hydrogen) also adds 
to national and local energy security by 
exploiting a more diverse energy mix.
Q: 
How big a contribution to electricity 
generation could residential CHP 
make in the UK?
A: 
Ceres CHP offers one of the most 
cost-effective ways to reduce carbon 
in the retrofit housing sector, once 
conventional insulation measures (e.g. 
loft insulation, cavity wall insulation) 
have been adopted.
Independent research shows that 
mass deployment of residential 
CHP products by 2020 could be the 
equivalent of up to 7GW of electrical 
capacity. As residential CHP products 
prove themselves in the market, it is 
possible that they will become the new 
benchmark for high-efficiency heating 
and be mandated by governments, 
much as condensing boilers are today.
as well as installed in new build, if the 
Government’s emissions reductions 
targets are to be met.
Significant reductions in CO
2
 
emissions from the residential sector 
are increasingly difficult to achieve 
in the existing housing stock. With 
home insulation and other available 
measures reaching saturation, fuel  
cell CHP offers one of the most  
cost-effective ways to reduce carbon.
Q: 
Can residential CHP really offer a 
mass market solution to reducing 
energy bills and CO
2
 emissions in 
homes. Isn’t large centralised power 
generation more efficient?
A: 
Centralised generation wastes a 
significant proportion of the energy it 
uses, through heat losses at the power 
station itself and further losses in the 
transmission and distribution system. 
A fuel cell CHP product installed in 
a home avoids these losses, and 
captures the heat generated for use 
within the home.
By creating electricity at the point  
of use, overall efficiency of fuel usage 
can be improved from around 35%  
for centralised generation to up  
to 90% for residential CHP . This results  
in significant energy savings and 
reductions in CO
2
 emissions, compared 
to grid-supplied electricity and 
conventional central heating.
A Ceres Power fuel cell CHP product is 
designed to replace a central heating 
boiler and can be easily installed in the 
majority of UK homes. 
Q: 
I understand that using fossil fuel 
residential CHP can help reduce 
emissions, but doesn’t this increase 
the reliance on gas and reduce 
energy security?
A: 
From a national energy security 
perspective, the high-efficiency energy 
conversion of a residential fuel cell 
CHP product helps reduce the overall 
use of existing fossil fuel resources 
through efficiency gains. Despite some  12 Ceres Power Holdings plc Annual Report 2010

Continued
maximising the annual energy savings. 
Unlike renewables that generate power 
on an intermittent basis, the Ceres CHP 
product is controllable and designed 
to meet daily and seasonal energy 
demands in the home by automatically 
varying its electrical and heat output. 
By reducing the electrical demand 
from homes, strain on the electricity 
grid can be reduced and, with smart 
meters, CHP products could be actively 
modulated (e.g. through price signals) 
to provide valuable generating 
capacity, increasing security of supply.
Q: 
How will installing Ceres Power CHP 
products help address fuel poverty 
and affordability?
A: 
Ceres Power’s unique patented fuel  
cell design operates at a lower 
temperature range enabling the  
CHP product to be manufactured  
using cost-effective materials and 
processes. The combination of high  
fuel efficiency, all year round operation 
and cost-effective manufacture can 
offer a typical consumer installing  
a CHP product an attractive payback 
compared to grid-supplied electricity 
and gas-fuelled conventional  
central heating.
The attractive payback for a Ceres  
CHP product means that finance 
solutions such as ‘Pay as you Save’ 
and the Green Deal (offered by banks, 
energy companies or local authorities) 
can reduce or even eliminate the  
up-front cost for households, offering  
affordable solutions to invest in  
low-carbon energy efficiency products. 
The annual energy bill savings 
delivered by the CHP product are used 
to repay the incremental investment, 
helping vulnerable households in 
particular and reducing the carbon 
footprint of the existing housing stock. 
Q: 
As the electricity grid decarbonises 
how can a Ceres CHP product  
deliver sustainable carbon savings 
beyond 2030?
A: 
Ceres CHP technology produces high 
value despatchable electricity that 
Q: 
How does a Ceres Power CHP product 
help reduce household energy bills 
and CO
2
 emissions?
A: 
Ceres has developed an integrated 
wall-mounted CHP product that is 
capable of generating all of the 
heating and hot water and the majority 
of the electricity for a typical UK 
home. Ceres Power’s unique fuel cell 
technology enables the CHP product 
to match daily and seasonal energy 
demands in the home all year round, 
substantially reducing the need to buy 
electricity from the mains power grid.
A home would typically use a boiler 
to meet its heating and hot water 
needs, and would use electricity 
generated by a central power station 
and transmitted through the mains 
grid. Centralised generation wastes 
a significant proportion of the energy 
it uses, through heat losses in the 
power station and in the electricity 
transmission and distribution network. 
A fuel cell CHP product installed in a 
home avoids these losses and captures 
the heat for use within the home. The 
resultant increase in efficiency can 
save the consumers around a quarter 
of their total annual energy costs, and 
reduce a home’s CO
2
 emissions.
In addition to benefiting from energy 
bill savings, a UK household would be 
eligible to receive an annual ‘clean 
energy cashback’ called a Feed-in  
Tariff, for every kWh generated by the 
CHP product.
Q: 
How does a Ceres Power CHP product 
operate in the home?
A: 
The Ceres CHP product is designed 
to replace a conventional boiler, 
using the same gas, water and 
electrical connections and with 
similar installation and maintenance 
requirements. The unit is wall-mounted 
and the home does not require a 
separate condensing boiler.
The low heat to power ratio of a Ceres 
fuel cell allows the CHP product 
to operate all year round thereby

displaces primarily conventional flexible 
fossil-fuelled power in the ‘merit order’. 
The carbon savings from our CHP 
product remain largely unchanged 
even as the electricity grid gradually 
decarbonises with mass deployment 
of baseload nuclear and intermittent 
renewables such as off-shore wind, 
because the grid will always need 
flexible, despatchable electricity  
that typically comes from the most 
carbon-intensive power plants.
Over the coming decades, studies show 
there is also significant potential for 
decarbonising the incoming gas used 
by fuel cell CHP through a transition 
from today’s natural gas to biogas and 
ultimately green hydrogen from Carbon 
Capture and Storage or renewables. 
In addition, as the electrification of 
residential heating (e.g. heat pumps), 
and transport (e.g. electric vehicles) 
becomes widespread, Ceres technology 
can provide valuable real-time local 
balancing capacity that will be needed 
in a system to relieve grid strain  
and enable more cost-effective 
renewable deployment.
Q: 
How will you sell the CHP product  
in the UK and how large is the  
market opportunity?
A: 
In the UK approximately 1.5 million gas 
boilers are installed every year, of which 
more than 85% are replacement boilers. 
The Ceres CHP product is an integrated 
wall-mounted unit that can be installed 
as a replacement for a conventional 
gas boiler. 
We have partnered with British Gas 
to sell our natural gas residential CHP 
products in the UK. As the largest 
operator in the installation and 
maintenance of domestic central 
heating and gas appliances in Britain, 
British Gas will be responsible for selling, 
installing and servicing Ceres Power 
CHP products in customers’ homes. The 
Group has already secured a volume 
forward order from British Gas over a 
four-year period.
This B2B business model enables Ceres 
to access millions of UK households 
and maximise sales in partnership with 
British Gas, Britain’s leading supplier of 
energy efficiency services in the home.
Q: 
If I live in a rural community and my 
house is not connected to the mains 
gas network, can I still install a Ceres 
CHP product in my house?
A: 
Yes you can. We are developing a version 
of our CHP product that can operate 
on packaged fuels such as liquefied 
petroleum gas (‘LPG’) that will enable UK 
households installing a Ceres LPG CHP 
product to enjoy energy bill savings and 
CO
2
 emissions reductions in the same 
way as homes connected to mains gas. 
We have partnered with Calor Gas (the 
country’s largest LPG supplier) to sell, 
install and service this product in the 
UK, where there are more than 2 million 
homes off the mains gas network. 
LPG is a very clean fuel compared to 
other off-gas grid alternatives such 
as heating oil, coal or electricity. For 
example, switching from an oil-fired 
boiler to an LPG CHP product would 
result in a double win – cleaner fuel 
and cleaner electricity.
Q: 
Where do you see the biggest 
opportunities for Ceres technology 
over the next five years?
A: 
Residential CHP is the main prize and 
we will look to sell market-specific 
variants of our residential CHP product 
platform globally including Europe, 
Asia and North America. 
The Group’s CHP technology will be 
able to operate on mains natural gas 
and LPG allowing the Group to address 
homes both on and off the mains gas 
grid. Across Europe there are more 
than 100 million properties without 
access to mains gas. In North America, 
the Group’s unique load-following 
fuel cell technology could provide 
significant opportunities to improve the 
resilience of the electricity grid, facilitate 
widespread dynamic demand-side 
management and provide valuable 
peak-shaving capacity. 
The Group is exploring opportunities 
in all these geographies and is in 
dialogue with a number of energy and 
product companies.

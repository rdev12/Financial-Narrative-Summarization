Financial highlights
“  2009 was a very challenging year during which Charter acted quickly and resolutely 
to ensure both ESAB and Howden addressed the challenges of recession and 
dislocation in the financial markets, whilst continuing to invest in both businesses 
and to position them for future growth. 
 
We believe that the worst of the recession is behind us but the recovery is expected 
to be uneven across the many different regions in which Charter operates. ESAB is 
well positioned to benefit from any recovery in steel consumption and, whilst we 
expect Howden’ s results in 2010 to be a little softer than 2009, we expect growth 
to resume in 2011. 
 
Our decision to declare an increased dividend reflects Charter’ s robust performance 
in 2009, its strong balance sheet and the Board’ s confidence that both ESAB and 
Howden will make further progress in 2010.”

“  Our business is more  
broadly-based than  
ever and we see further  
opportunities to expand”
Chief Executive’s review of the business
The progress made across the Group over the last year continues 
to be encouraging. All of our operations have been performing 
well and we have grown the business in line with our strategy of 
expanding into complementary service areas and by increasing 
our geographic presence. We now have more than 400 employees 
worldwide based at 35 offices, of which eight are overseas, and 
our shipping services business is more diverse than ever before. 
With shipping activity remaining strong, we see no shortage of 
opportunity to continue our controlled growth in the same vein.  
A review of the market and our activities during the year is set  
out by segment below.
Shipbroking 
Shipbroking activities are undertaken under the name of 
Braemar Seascope from offices in London, Shanghai, Beijing, 
Singapore, Melbourne, Perth and Aberdeen. Revenues in 2006/7 
increased to £40.5m (2006: £39.7m) and adjusted operating 
profits were £8.7m (2006: £9.0m). The operating profit margin 
(before impairment charge) for the division was 21.6% in 2007 
(2006: 22.7%), reflecting a shift towards lower margin chartering 
business in the year. There was an average of 205 employees of 
whom 68% were fee earning and 25% were based overseas  
(2006: 189 employees).
In each of the dry market sectors freight rates dipped from the 
start of our financial year when the Baltic Dry Index (“BDI”) 
stood at 2,708, reaching a low in May 2006 (BDI 2,416) before 
recovering over the remainder of the financial year (BDI 4,765). 
The BDI currently stands at 6,585. The capesize market curve 
was particularly steep in both directions with the strong recovery 
driven by Chinese demand, during which we were able to 
conclude a number of long-term period charters at high rates. 
There has also been a considerable growth in vessel supply 
although there is still sufficient market tightness to produce 
significant fluctuations in rates from time to time. Currently 
the market is affected by load port congestion, especially in 
the east coast coal ports of Australia. This has helped reduce 
the supply of vessels and thereby to strengthen freight rates. 
Following our investment in Australia, this year we opened an 
office in Singapore and in Sao Paolo, both of which are becoming 
increasingly important as shipping centres. In view of the 
strength of the market and our investments, we expect our  
dry activities to become a more significant part of our business  
in future.
Deep sea tanker chartering increased both income and 
transaction volumes over last year, and the value of longer term 
period business grew significantly over the year. At the start of 
the financial year the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index (“BDTI”) stood at 
1,109 falling to a low of 951 in April 2006 but recovering strongly 
to reach a 12 month peak of 1,602 in August and closing at 1,101 
on 28 February 2007. It currently stands at 1,296. The weakness 
in tanker freight rates at the start of the financial year was caused 
by OPEC cutbacks which led to reduced refining. However, as the 
oil price rose from $60/barrel to $70/barrel supply restraints 
were relaxed and refineries moved quickly to source crude which 
became much in demand causing a rapid rise in freight rates. 
With increased refining came the increased demand for the 
carriage of refined products and although rates did not return to 
the high levels of the previous year, they did remain steady for 
most of the second and third quarters. In addition the constant 
Chinese and Indian demand for crude supplied not only from the 
Middle East but also from Atlantic producers in West Africa and 
the Caribbean maintained a healthy employment of large crude 
carriers. Delivery of newbuildings into the tanker markets during 
the course of 2006 has increased the deadweight available to 
carry oil which has meant that after the market weakened in 
the fourth quarter, rates did not recover as quickly following the 
increased volumes at the start of our new year. However, it is 
encouraging to note that despite the steady growth of the fleet 
during the first quarter of our new year the spot market was 
notably active with short-term demand for crude. As the year 
progresses we expect to see continuing demand from the major 
refining centres, but the growth in the tanker fleet prior to the 
phasing out of older tonnage will mean the market is likely to  
be more volatile.
Alan Marsh 
Chief Executive     Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007
Offshore had its best ever year driven by high activity levels and 
charter rates and the successful conclusion of some good sale 
and purchase and project transactions, some of which will benefit 
the company for many years to come. Worldwide oil and gas 
exploration has been very active and continues to be so, giving 
confidence for the coming year.
We consolidated our container business midway through the 
financial year with the purchase of the remaining 50% interest 
in Braemar Container Shipping and Chartering Limited in August 
2006. After a reasonably strong market in the first half of the year 
container charter rates fell in the second half of the year before 
recovering strongly during the first quarter of 2007. During 2006 
global growth in container volume was 10.8% and fleet capacity 
grew by 16.5%, and in 2007 the growth is expected to be in the 
region of 10-11% for container volumes and 14.5-15% for growth 
in fleet capacity. The desk performed well throughout the year in 
a rapidly changing market and we expect a similar performance 
to last year given the forecast growth in capacity, providing world 
trade is maintained. 
As at 1 March 2007 we had concluded business that should 
generate revenues in excess of $30m in the new financial year  
(1 March 2006 for the next twelve months: US$26m). 
Ship agency, forwarding and logistics
Revenues increased to £23.4m (2006: £15.9m) and operating 
profits were £0.9m (2006: £0.6m) and the Company’s 
achievements were also recognised by its customers when in 
April 2007 Cory was voted number one in the Lloyds Loading  
List Customer Service Awards 2006. 
The year overall has seen Cory consolidating its acquisitions 
made late 2005 and early 2006, and concentrating on 
organic growth with average staffing increasing from 120 to 
149. Growth was driven primarily by the liner, logistics and 
forwarding business, where revenues showed month-on-month 
improvements throughout the financial year. 
Chief Executive’s review of the business continued
Deep water construction 
vessel fixed by our offshore 
department for a minimum  
of five years.
The coastal tanker market benefited from larger contract volumes 
and falling bunker costs towards the end of the year providing 
a stimulus to activity. Deep sea chemical parcel tankers had a 
steady year with an upturn in rates in the fourth quarter due to a 
combination of increasing demand and the prospect of the latest 
biofuel regulations coming into force. This trend should continue 
during 2007 through to 2008 and while there will be seasonal 
fluctuations the market is expected to remain firm.
The LPG freight market is expected to strengthen over the next 
twelve months as new product streams and market participants, 
such as China, compete in the market for tonnage. 
The LNG transportation market remains at low levels for short-
term employment due to the delivery of new vessels, committed 
for long-term LNG transportation, the projects for which have 
since been delayed by between one and three years. However, 
such vessels will be absorbed in the long-term projects that 
they were originally intended for and while there are some 
uncommitted vessels in the market these will, in time, achieve 
gainful employment. 
Sale and purchase enjoyed another very successful year. There 
was a shift in the business with less high value second-hand 
transactions than in 2005/6 but a record year for newbuildings 
where the income is received over 2-3 years on average. The 
demand for new ships is borne out in the extended shipyard 
order books and in a tendency for payment terms to reflect 
larger up-front contracted values. The newbuilding forward order 
book is now at its highest level (both in terms of the number 
of ships and commission value) with ship deliveries stretching 
out to 2010/11. Over the last six months there has been a very 
significant increase in the market value of bulk carriers which 
is commensurate with the rise in dry freight rates and we have 
recently concluded a number of transactions at historically high 
values. Demolition business remains a small part of sale and 
purchase activity but we expect it to increase in the coming years 
in line with the phase-out of single hull tankers.
Significant business is 
transacted by the Group for 
export of minerals from Port 
Hedland, Australia. Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     
The increase in liner, logistics and forwarding was driven primarily 
by sustained strong demand with in excess of 13,200 forwarding 
jobs being handled in the year compared with 9,700 last year. 
These were mostly on key logistics contracts supplemented 
with a number of one-off projects. Whilst most of the activity 
is handled out of Felixstowe, we have been developing 
forwarding activities from certain existing agency locations, 
thereby increasing the scope and capability of Cory as a whole. 
Planetwide, the forwarding acquisition made in 2005, performed 
in line with our growth expectations. During the year it handled 
1,860 of the forwarding jobs and was also able to add new 
consolidation routes to the Middle East. 
Port agency handled 17% more port calls in 2006/7 maintaining 
a leading position in an increasingly competitive market. New 
income streams commencing in early 2007 should see this 
growth continue through the remainder of 2007 and into 2008. 
The acquisition of the business and assets of Gorman Shipping, 
which handles over 750 vessels per annum concentrated on 
the Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal, has significantly 
strengthened our UK agency activities. The business has been 
combined with the existing Cory Liverpool office making it one of 
the foremost ships’ agents in the area. Morrison Tours, a highly 
seasonal business linked closely to the cruise industry around 
the UK has added to its customer base and improved the take-up 
of the shore excursions on offer. 
With further new pieces of business being won in both agency 
and liner, logistics and forwarding, activity levels should continue 
to be maintained in all areas in the coming year. 
Technical shipping support – Wavespec
Revenues increased to £6.6m (2006: £5.2m) and operating 
profits were £0.6m (2006: £0.3m) in line with the growth in 
activity levels. The average headcount during the year was 18 
employees (2006: 17 employees) with a further 50 engineers sub-
contracted to clients within this segment (2006: 45 consultants). 
Currently, the company has site supervision teams at three 
shipyards for the construction of up to 48 new LNG vessels in 
connection with the Qatargas II project and this is expected to 
generate a positive contribution for the Company for several 
years. It is also fulfilling a similar role in connection with LNG 
vessel construction for use on the Sakhalin gas project.  
Wavespec has also been active in the development of the 
seaborne transportation of compressed natural gas, working 
with Braemar Seascope to provide technical and commercial 
assistance for a number of projects. 
Environmental services – DV Howells 
DV Howells was acquired in March 2006 and has contributed 
revenue of £3.2m and operating profits of £0.2m in the eleven 
months since it joined the Group. The average headcount 
during the year was 39 full-time employees compared to 
34 at acquisition. The addition of Hi-bar in September 2006 
completed the response coverage across the UK and enhanced 
the Company’s training and consultancy capability. The Company 
has had a busy year and has integrated well into the Group. 
Of particular note is the major role the Company has played 
following the grounding of the mini-bulker Sumni in the Orkney 
Islands and the container vessel MSC Napoli in Devon. Services 
provided, some of which are still on-going, include pollution 
control, beach clearance, decontamination wash-down facility 
and the handling of hazardous container cargoes. The Company 
also won important contracts to provide incident response 
services in Angola and for the Ministry of Defence (“MOD”), both 
of which illustrate the potential of the business to grow in the UK 
and overseas. 
Bunker trading
Revenues increased to £33.4m (2006: £7.7m), representing a  
full year’s contribution, and operating profits were £62,000 
(2006: £30,000).
Bunker sales have been lower than expected due to a 
combination of the drought conditions and high oil prices, which 
has to some extent limited demand in the Australasian region. 
Looking forward, the Australian resources and minerals sector is 
enjoying significant growth which should be a basis for increased 
bunker sales in the future. We are currently in the process of 
reviewing our strategic options with regard to this business.

Financial review
Profits and earnings
Reported pre-tax profits were £10.1m (2006: £10.3m). Adjusted 
pre-tax profits (before an impairment charge) increased by 7% to 
£11.0m on revenues of £107.2m (2006: £68.5m). As indicated at 
the half year, given the performance of all business segments in 
broadly favourable markets, we expected the operating profits 
in the second half of the year to show an improvement over the 
first half. Second half operating profits for 2006/7 were £5.8m 
compared with £4.7m (before impairment) in the first half and 
£4.7m in the second half of 2005/6. The trading improvement 
shows sustained business growth across all segments.
A reconciliation of reported profits to adjusted profits is set out 
in the table below. The impairment charge is not a cash cost and 
arose because at the half year, after a relatively weak market, a 
more prudent view was taken of the estimated future earnings 
from the Australian business.

The weighted average number of shares increased from 19.38m 
to 19.72m for 2006/7.
Margins
Operating profits are stated after deducting both cost of sales 
and operating costs. Cost of sales comprises bunker payments, 
freight and haulage and payments to sub-contractors. The 
operating profit margin (before impairment) of 9.8% in 2007 
compares with 14.4% in 2006. The reduction is mainly due to the 
increased relative contributions of the non-broking businesses 
which generate returns at lower margins but which are less 
volatile. The margin in shipbroking was lower due to an increase 
in operating costs totalling 3.4% mainly in respect of staff costs 
and the establishment of new overseas offices. A summary of the 
segment margins is set out below.
Operating margins before impairment 
  2006/7  2005/6
Shipbroking 21.6% 22.7%
Ship agency, forwarding and logistics 3.9% 3.6%
Technical shipping support 8.3% 5.6%
Environmental services 7.0% n/a
 14.1% 16.2%
Bunker trading 0.2% 0.4%
Total 9.8% 14.4%
Foreign exchange
The average rate of exchange for conversion of US dollar income 
during the financial year, after taking account of hedging, was 
$1.86/£ (2006: $1.80/£) and at 28 February 2007 the balance 
sheet rate for conversion was $1.97/£ (28 February 2006: 
$1.75/£). If the 2006/7 US dollar denominated income had been 
translated at the 2005/6 average exchange rate, it would have 
been higher by approximately £1.2 million. At 28 February 2007 
the Group held forward currency contracts to sell US$6 million at 
an average rate of $1.95/£ and currency options giving the right 
to sell US$1.1 million for AU$ at a rate of 0.78. 
Taxation
The tax rate on reported profit before tax was 35.8% (2006: 
30.3%). The underlying rate, excluding the share of net profits 
from joint ventures and the effect of the impairment charge,  
was 33.3% (2006: 31.0%). Braemar Seascope Group plc  Annual Report 2007     
Felixstowe’s Trinity 
Terminal: Cory Brothers 
handle at least one ship 
per day through this port.
Cash flow and acquisitions
The cash balance increased over the year by £1.0m to £14.6m 
(2006: £13.6m). Operating cash flow generated in the year was 
£9.7m, from which the major cash outflows before expenditure 
on acquisitions were £0.7m for the purchase of fixed assets, 
£3.4m on corporation tax and £3.6m for dividend payments. 
Net cash expended on acquiring businesses was £2.5m, offset 
by £0.7m of cash in the acquired balance sheets, in respect of DV 
Howells and Hi-bar (£0.6m), 50% of Braemar Container Shipping 
and Chartering (£1.2m), 41% of Gorman Cory (£0.2m) and 
Planetwide (£0.5m). This does not include further potential cash 
consideration of, in aggregate, £1.1m dependent on profitability.
Treasury risk management
The Board sets the Group’s treasury policy covering financing 
decisions and treasury risk management, the objective of which 
is to manage the Group’s financial risk exposures in an effective 
manner. The Finance Director is responsible for day-to-day 
treasury risk monitoring and activity which is reviewed by the 
Board through regular reporting. The Group uses financial 
instruments to hedge underlying exposures and not for 
speculative purposes.
Liquidity risk: The Group has no net debt and did not have at 
any time during the year. An overdraft facility of £3.0m with the 
Group’s principal relationship bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland 
plc, is maintained for financial flexibility and in order to improve 
treasury efficiency and performance. 
Foreign exchange risk: The majority of the Company’s 
shipbroking, technical services and bunker trading income is US 
dollar denominated and changes in the rate of exchange relative 
to £ sterling, and to a lesser extent the Australian and Singapore 
dollar, can have an effect on the reported results and net assets. 
From time to time the Group enters into forward foreign exchange 
contracts and currency options to limit the effect of currency 
fluctuations. 
Interest rate risk: The Group has an exposure to interest rates in 
relation to its cash balances, the majority of which are held in the 
UK. Surplus cash (in £s or US$s) is deposited at institutions with 
strong credit ratings and deposits are short term in nature.

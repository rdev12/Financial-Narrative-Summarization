Rightmove is the marketplace for property in the UK. 
This has been built from both the consumer’s desire to 
search for property habitually with us and our leadership in 
property listings. The latter has substantially increased 
in early 2015. We are committed to the never-ending need 
to evolve and innovate to continue to drive our clear 
leadership position.
The Board and I are grateful for the confidence of our 
19,300 Agency and New Homes customers and also to our 
employees whose efforts have positioned Rightmove as the 
essential marketplace for home hunters to find their next 
home and for property advertisers to reach by far the widest 
possible audience.
Financial results
The strength of our business model and core value 
proposition underpin record financial results in 2014. 
Underlying operating profit
(1)
 was up 20% to  
£124.6m (2013: £104.0m) driven by strong organic 
revenue growth of 19% to £167.0m (2013: £139.9m) 
and continued focus on cost control. Underlying basic 
earnings per share (EPS)
(2)
 was up 24% to  
100.3p (2013: 81.0p), even greater than the percentage 
increase in profits and in part attributable to £73.9m of 
share repurchases as part of our policy of returning cash 
to shareholders.
I am pleased to present Rightmove plc’s results for the year 
ended 31 December 2014.
Rightmove has demonstrated a characteristic and 
unwavering focus on improving its market leading customer 
proposition and consumer experience. It has proven a wise 
strategy as customers continue to invest more for greater 
returns, reflecting the value of our immense and growing 
popularity with Britain’s property searching public, our 
customers’ customers.
We have built our brand over 15 years and become the 
undisputed leader in the online property marketplace by 
providing consumers with one place to search and research 
UK property and by providing our customers one place to 
reach all home hunters. We at Rightmove take no greater 
satisfaction than providing a great value service to the 
organised property industry, by connecting them to most 
vendors and home searchers efficiently and effectively. 
Rightmove is perennially ranked as one of the top ten most 
popular websites in the UK. This popularity was highlighted 
when Google identified Rightmove as the most searched 
for business in the UK in 2014. The attraction of our more 
than 15 billion and growing page impressions demonstrates 
how compelling Rightmove is to consumers and ultimately to 
our customers.

Board changes
During the past year, we welcomed Peter Williams and Rakhi 
Parekh to the Board. Peter and Rakhi have already made 
substantial contributions drawing upon their collective 
consumer and digital experience and Peter’s extensive board 
experience. During an overlapping transition period, the 
Board continued to benefit from the sage contributions of 
Jonathan Agnew and Judy Vezmar as we have for each of the 
past nine years. Having completed three terms and no longer 
deemed independent, Jonathan and Judy will not stand for 
re-election to the Board in May 2015. We are grateful for their 
insights throughout their service, perhaps most nostalgically 
during Rightmove’s early days as a public company when 
online marketing was less accepted as the norm and best 
way to reach home movers.
Outlook
Our results for 2014 show us continuing to outperform 
expectations. Based upon strong customer numbers, traffic 
and healthy growth in average spend per advertiser at the 
start of the year, the Board remains confident of continued 
success in 2015.

Returns to shareholders
Our commitment to return excess cash promptly to investors 
continues to be as strong as ever. Cash conversion remains 
in excess of 100% of operating profit. In 2014, we returned 
a further £103.4m (2013: £85.6m) to shareholders through 
dividends and share buybacks while retaining only 
£11.2m (2013: £6.8m) at the end of the year. This brings 
the total cash returned to shareholders since our flotation 
in March 2006 to £482.1m.
Dividend
The Board previously announced that it would increase the 
interim dividend to 13p (H1 2013: 11.0p) per ordinary share, 
which was paid on 7 November 2014. Consistent with our 
policy of increasing the total dividend for the year broadly in 
line with underlying operating profit, the Board proposes to 
pay a final dividend of 22.0p (2013: 17.0p) per ordinary share 
for a total dividend for the year of 35.0p (2013: 28.0p), an 
increase of 25%. The final dividend, subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 5 June 2015 to all shareholders on 
the register on 8 May 2015.

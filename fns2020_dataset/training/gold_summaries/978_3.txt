 2 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2009
Chairman’s statement
2009 was a particularly important year in 
your Company’s history as it saw us take 
the Gedabek gold/copper mine (‘Gedabek’) 
in Azerbaijan into production. This exciting 
event was not only a major milestone for 
Anglo Asian, but also for Azerbaijan as it 
is	the	country’s	first	operating	gold	mine	
in recent times. With gold production at 
Gedabek continuing to increase quarter on 
quarter	as	efficiencies	at	the	mine	further	
improve, and the updated JORC compliant 
resource expected to increase by at least 
50% from our original resource estimation 
of 702,000 ounces of gold, 37,500 tonnes 
of copper and 6,100,000 ounces of silver, 
we	remain	confident	of	Gedabek’s	long-term	
success	as	a	profitable	gold	producing	entity .	
Whilst our efforts have focused on Gedabek 
and ensuring its success, the development of 
our total 1,962 sq km portfolio of prospective 
copper and gold assets also remains central 
to	our	mid-term	strategy	of	increasing	our	
production portfolio. To this end, now that 
mining operations are successfully underway 
at Gedabek we look forward to advancing 
various exploration programmes across 
our portfolio.
Gedabek, located in western Azerbaijan, is 
an open pit, heap leach operation. Whilst it 
currently has an initial six year mine life with 
target production in excess of 300,000 ounces 
o f 	 g o l d , 	 w e 	 a r e 	 c o n fi d e n t 	 t h a t 	 t h r o u g h 	 t h e	
expected resource upgrade and through further 
exploration in the immediate region, this will 
be extended. Initially, the processing plant 
suffered technical teething problems, including 
the operational consistency of the secondary 
and tertiary crushers and the level of ore on 
the leach pad. However these issues have 
largely	been	rectified	through	the	installation	
of new plant equipment and we are now 
experiencing	increasing	production	figures.	
In the months ending 31 March 2010 and 
30 April 2010 we achieved gold production of 
6,167 ounces and 5,298 ounces respectively, 
and we anticipate that these levels of production 
will continue. We have already exceeded our 
revised target of 25,000 ounces of gold for 
t h e 	 fi r s t 	 1 2 	 m o n t h s 	 o f 	 o p e r a t i o n 	 t o 	 3 0 	 J u n e 	 2 0 1 0	
with total production to 30 April 2010 totalling 
30,323 ounces of gold. We have now aligned 
our production targets with the Company’s 
financial	year;	our	production	forecast	for	the	
year ending 31 December 2010 is 53,500 ounces 
of gold. 
In	terms	of	gold	sales,	we	completed	our	first	
gold sale in July 2009 and in line with increasing 
gold	production	figures,	these	sales	have	
increased over the period. The buoyant gold 
price has seen the Company completing gold 
sales ahead of forecast projections at an average 
of $1,098 per ounce for the months July 2009 
to April 2010. 
Our excellent relationship with the Government 
of Azerbaijan continues and we are very grateful 
for its support. Indeed, we were delighted when 
His Excellency Ilham Aliyev, the President of 
Azerbaijan, agreed to open Gedabek at a formal 
ceremony in May 2009. Since that time we have 
maintained a close dialogue with him and various 
ministers including the Minister of Ecology and 
Natural Resources. We also continue to work 
closely with the International Bank of Azerbaijan 
(‘IBA’), which is majority owned by the 
Government of Azerbaijan and has provided 
us with loans now amounting to $43.9 million, 
to be repaid from cash generated from 
production at Gedabek. Further details of 
these loans are given in the Financial Review. 
At this point I should once again outline 
our Production Sharing Agreement (‘PSA’). 
This sees the Government of Azerbaijan take 
51% of commercial products from each mine 
after deducting the quantities of commercial 
products necessary to enable the Company 
to recover its operating costs, capital costs 
and imputed interest. Costs allowable as 
operating, capital and imputed interest for 
e a c h 	 m i n e 	 a r e 	 d e fi n e d 	 u n d e r 	 t h e 	 t e r m s 	 o f 	 t h e	
PSA agreement. Prior to the point at which 
the Company has recovered all its carried 
forward, unrecovered operating, capital and 
imputed interest costs, the Company is able 
to recover up to a maximum of 75% of the 
imputed revenue from each mine. Up until 
the time Anglo Asian has recovered all its 
carried forward, unrecovered costs, the 
Government of Azerbaijan effectively takes 
12.75% (being 51% of the balancing 25%) 
of commercial products of each mine with 
the Company taking 87.25%. 
In tandem with our main cash generation 
from	gold,	our	silver	and	copper	by -products	
will also add to our revenues going forward. 
To this end, during the year we continued 
the development of the SART processing plant 
to facilitate the recovery of the copper and 
silver dissolved in the leaching solution. 
This was completed in February 2010, but as 
this process has never been used commercially 
on such a scale before, we expect a few start 
up	issues	in	its	first	months	of	operation.	
We hope it will be fully operational by 
September 2010. The plant capacity is 
approximately 1,800 tonnes of copper/silver 
concentrate per year although the amount 
produced will depend on ore mineralogy and 
process	efficiencies.	Initial	assay	results	show	
that the copper concentrate contains 60–70% 
copper and 4,000 to 6,000 g/t of silver. It should 
be noted that the higher silver content may be 
the result of an anomaly caused by the silver 
build up in the solution prior to the start up of 
the SART plant. The Company is in the process 
of evaluating options for the sale of copper/
silver concentrate.
Additionally, at Gedabek, leading global mining 
consultant SGS Mineral Services (‘SGS’) has been 
analysing existing drilling data with a view to 
completing a new resource and reserve model 
by the end of 2010. We were delighted to 
announce recently the initial results of Phase I 
of the Realistic Mineral Model Report, 
completed by SGS, which indicates upgrades 
for the measured, indicated and inferred gold, 
copper and silver metal contents of at least 
5 0 % . 	 W e 	 a r e 	 e x p e c t i n g 	 c o n fi r m a t i o n 	 o f 	 t h e s e

 Summary
  Gedabek gold/copper mine in Azerbaijan completed May 2009 
and opened by the President of Azerbaijan
  First gold sales achieved July 2009
  Gold production to 30 April 2010 totalled 30,323 oz – 
exceeding	forecast	for	first	full	year	of	operation	to	
30 June 2010 of 25,000 oz of gold
  Second calendar year production target to 31 December 2010 
of 53,500 oz of gold Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2009 3
is expected to be completed in late 2010 and 
will increase our knowledge of the size and 
characteristics of the ore body at Gedabek.
Developing our asset portfolio forms a key 
part of our strategy as ultimately we hope 
to replicate our success at Gedabek in other 
areas. Our portfolio of Contract Areas in 
Azerbaijan consists of Gedabek, two further 
Contract Areas, Ordubad and Gosha, totalling 
1,062 sq km and three additional Contract Areas 
covering 900 sq km in territories occupied 
by Armenia, which we are unable to develop 
until access is obtained.
Exploration work has been ongoing at our 
462 sq km Ordubad and 300 sq km Gosha 
Contract Areas at a low level. We anticipate that 
this will pick up during the remainder of 2010.
A strong, stable team is key to the success of 
any business and Anglo Asian is no different. 
I am delighted with our current team, which 
is working well together and delivering solid 
results. During the year we made a number 
of appointments including that of Professor 
J o h n 	 M o n h e m i u s 	 w h o 	 j o i n e d 	 a s 	 a 	 N o n - e x e c u t i v e	
Director in August 2009, replacing Ross Bhappu. 
Professor Monhemius has over 40 years of 
experience of academic and industrial research 
and development in hydrometallurgy and 
environmental control in mining and 
metallurgical processes as well as experience 
in the public company arena.
On the management side, in October 2009 
we appointed a new Operations Manager, 
Timothy van Zeller, to oversee Gedabek on 
a	day -to-day	basis.	Timothy	has	over	30	years’	
experience in the mining industry having worked 
for many large scale mining operations in 
Zimbabwe, South Africa, Uzbekistan and 
Kazakhstan, and specialises in heap leach 
operations. His appointment has left Farhang 
Hedjazi, who stepped across from his role as 
Chief 	 T echnical 	 Officer 	 to 	 become 	 a 	 consultant 	
to the Company, free to focus on the wider 
operations including Gedabek geometallurgical 
studies and exploration activities. 
Looking forward, I believe 2010 
will prove to be a very exciting 
year for Anglo Asian. With 
further plant improvements in 
the pipeline, Gedabek is expected 
to generate increasing revenues 
from this point onwards. 
Our whole team now consists of approximately 
300 personnel from mining engineers to 
geologists and project managers. As ever, 
maintaining good health, safety, social and 
environmental standards is very important 
to us. We were therefore very pleased to be 
recognised for our efforts through the award

Management System for our mining and gold 
and copper processing operations at Gedabek. 
In addition, we are also committed to 
Gedabek’s local community and have 
implemented community projects aimed 
at keeping an open and active dialogue 
with the local populace and assisting in 
their economic advancement. Over the past 
two years we have implemented initiatives 
including the provision of the necessary 
expertise and materials to provide two villages 
in the vicinity of Gedabek to obtain fresh 
water, as well as repairing a bridge and a 
medical facility in one of the villages.
In 2009 Anglo Asian generated revenues 
of	$10,256,851	(2008:	$nil)	as	a	result	of	
gold and silver sales from the Gedabek mine. 
The revenues were generated from the sale 
of Anglo Asian’s share of the production for 
the year which comprised 9,656 ounces of 
gold and 2,919 ounces of silver at an average 
price of $1,057 and $17 respectively. The Group 
incurred mining cost of sales of $8,403,928 
(2008:	$nil)	and	therefore	reported	a	mining	
profit	of	$1,852,923	for	FY	2009	(2008:	$nil).	
As production ramps up we expect gross 
profits	achieved	to	improve	significantly .	
During the year there was an impairment charge 
of	$5,773,180	(2008:	$nil).	This	comprised	of	
a write down of $5,000,000 in respect of 
the mining rights of Ordubad Contract Area 
and $773,180 in respect of evaluation and 
exploration expenditure for three mining 
properties within the Ordubad Contract Area. 
The Company originally carried mining rights 
for Ordubad at $10,000,000 at the time it 
purchased rights to the Contract Area and wrote 
down an amount of $5,000,000 during 2007. 
The Directors carefully evaluated the potential of 
Ordubad Contract Area in relation to the expiry 
of the licence in 2011 and made the decision to 
write down the balance of $5,000,000.
The Group incurred administration expenses 
of 	 $4,250,801 	 (2008: 	 $4,526,090) 	 and 	 finance 	
costs	for	the	year	of	$3,262,986	(2008:	$nil).	
The Group generated a loss for the year of 
$11,723,910	(2008:	$4,471,434).	
Looking forward, I believe 2010 will prove to 
be a very exciting year for Anglo Asian. With 
further plant improvements in the pipeline, 
Gedabek is expected to generate increasing 
revenues from this point onwards. This, in 
tandem with our exploration activities, gives 
us	confidence	in	our	strategy	of	becoming	
a 	 m i d - t i e r 	 g o l d 	 a n d 	 b a s e 	 m e t a l 	 m i n i n g 	 C o m p a n y	
focused in Caucasia and Central Asia. 
I would like to thank all those involved in 
the Company for their continued support 
and belief in our projects. I truly believe that 
Anglo Asian has great potential to deliver 
good rewards to its shareholders and look 
forward	to	the	coming	year	with	confidence.

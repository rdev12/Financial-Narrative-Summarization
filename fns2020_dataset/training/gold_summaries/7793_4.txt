Overview
IGas at a Glance: 
From reservoir to reﬁnery
With assets ranging from mature 
discoveries made more than 50 years 
ago, to unconventional resources 
only now recoverable as a result  
of technical advances in oil ﬁeld 
practices, IGas has a very signiﬁcant 
position in discovered and potentially 
deliverable hydrocarbon resources 
across Britain.
In the North West and Staffordshire 
we have more than 500,000 acres 
under licence, which are primarily  
for the development of 
unconventional resources.
The size of the CBM resource has been 
demonstrated and its delivery potential is currently 
being appraised. As regards shale, this year’s 
activity has begun appraisal of the potential.  
Within this area we have drilled a total of ten 
wells and have an extensive library of other 
borehole data and pre-existing 2D and 3D 
seismic. With seven sites already permitted and 
a similar number being pursued in the area, we 
are well positioned to develop these resources 
close to markets and customers, once the 
appraisal phase is completed and repeatable 
commercial flow rates have been demonstrated 
from both the coal and shale horizons.

Potential production sites (approved permits)
The Weald basin is the source of 
approximately 40% of our current 
production.
With eight fields ranging from Stockbridge in 
the west, near Winchester, to Palmers Wood 
near Gatwick in the East. The area has 
produced more than 29 million barrels of oil to 
date. Our oil is collected by tanker from our sites 
and transported to our processing facilities at 
Holybourne. Here we have storage for more 
than 20,000 barrels and a rail terminal allowing 
us to transport our products to local refineries 
by train. We also handle oil on behalf of other 
operators in the area, providing IGas with a 
valuable additional revenue stream.

In the East Midlands we have two 
primary production centres: Welton 
and Gainsborough/Beckingham.
Hydrocarbons have been produced in the East 
Midlands since 1959 and current production 
from this area accounts for approximately 60% 
of Group’s total current production.
The Welton area is made up of six fields and a 
gathering centre where the produced oil, gas 
and water are separated. The produced oil is 
transported to Conoco Immingham via road 
tanker, gas is used for power generation and 
produced water is pumped for reinjection.
The Gainsborough/Beckingham area is made 
up of eleven fields and a processing facility. Oil is 
transported to Conoco Immingham via road 
tanker, gas is piped to Gainsborough-1 for 
power generation and produced water is 
pumped for reinjection.

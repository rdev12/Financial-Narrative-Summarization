 EXPANSION 
The construction of Phase Three of our Shirebrook campus expansion is now well underway. It consists of an additional warehouse and office facility, spanning a c.700,000 sq. ft. 
footprint. Occupancy of the first warehouse area is about to commence, with population of the remaining areas of the warehouse planned for later in 2015, on schedule. We have also 
commenced work on an additional retail unit and training centre at our Shirebrook campus, with completion anticipated for late 2015. The expansions will have a range of benefits for the 
Group, including an improved environment for staff training.
Our Oxford Street store has now been open for over 12 months and has been well-received by both customers and suppliers. The property, which was the former HMV Flagship store, 
allows us to trade over four floors, with c.50,000 sq. ft. of retail space. Our Glasgow City Centre store has undergone an extension of approximately 28,000 sq. ft., more than doubling 
its previous footprint and we have collaborated with Under Armour to offer our customers an exceptional shopping environment. We have also recently acquired the freehold of the 
c.50,000 sq. ft. former Primark store in Leeds, which is expected to open this summer.
We are confident in the success of the format used in the stores, which we intend to roll out further.
Our Fitness division now has 27 fully operational gyms across England. During the year the Group purchased 25 former LA Fitness gyms, and developed an additional two gyms with 
separate retail premises, ensuring that customers can purchase their everyday gym essentials on site. 
STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS 
Strategic Investments are an integral part of the Board strategy to explore new opportunities to bring our product to market. 
The Group enhanced its relationship with Debenhams during the year with the purchase of an additional strategic investment in the business, increasing our beneficial interest from 6.6% 
to 15.0% at the year end date of 26 April 2015, which has subsequently reduced since the year end to 10.5%. We are currently trialling four concessions within Debenhams stores. 
SHARE SCHEMES 
I am pleased to confirm that we have achieved the final Adjusted Underlying EBITDA target under the 2011 Share Scheme and Executive Share Scheme. We hope to reward  
participating employees under the 2011 Share Scheme for their loyalty and motivation by way of share awards. The first award under the 2011 Share Scheme is due to vest later in 
2015, which will distribute c.5m shares to c.2,000 participating employees. The Group’s Share Schemes are some of the most generous schemes in the country, and are key tools in 
motivation and retention.
 
I am pleased to report the Group has once again achieved another solid result, delivering growth in both Group revenues and EBITDA.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
12
ANNUAL REPORT 2015  To the extent that a significant number of participating employees elect to sell some or all of their shares, whilst the Company has no obligation to buy back the shares, the Board will 
consider a number of options open to it, including whether to: (i) implement an on-market buy back of shares pursuant to the authority given by shareholders at the Company’s AGM  
in 2014; or (ii) fund the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust so as to allow it to acquire shares in the market to replace those shares transferred to participating employees pursuant to  
the vesting.
As part of our strategy to closely align the interests of our team with those of our shareholders, the 2015 Share Scheme was approved by shareholders at a General Meeting in July 
2014. The vesting of awards under the 2015 Share Scheme is conditional upon the achievement by the Group of four demanding EBITDA targets, which span between FY16 and FY19. 
The awards will vest in 2019 and 2021, subject to successful completion of all four targets, and other specific performance conditions. The Executive Deputy Chairman, Mike Ashley, 
withdrew from the Scheme during FY15. Mike remains fully committed to the achievement of the Scheme’s targets, but would like the focus to be on ensuring that the Scheme aligns 
with the wider Sports Direct team, and therefore chose to withdraw from the Scheme.
As we enter FY16 it is clear, and also understood by the market, that planned acquisitions in FY15 did not fully materialise. Following its recent review, the Board now recommends 
to shareholders a revised FY16 Adjusted Underlying EBITDA target of £420m, rather than the existing target of £480m which is now considered to be unreasonably challenging. This 
compares to the Underlying EBITDA of £383m achieved in FY15. All other targets for the further three years of the Scheme currently remain the same. The Board will continue to review 
the robustness of the 2015 Share Scheme on an annual basis.
THE BOARD 
During July 2014, it was announced that Charles McCreevy, a Non-Executive Director of the Group, would not be standing for re-election at the 2014 AGM. Charlie, who had spent over 
three years with the Group, had extensive all-round business knowledge, with particular relevance to Competition Regulations. I would like to thank him for his valuable contribution to the 
Board. We are in the process of appointing a replacement and hope to make an announcement within the near future.
I am delighted to welcome Matt Pearson to the Board in the position of Acting Chief Financial Officer. Matt joined the business over eight years ago and since then has gained an in depth 
knowledge of the finances of the Group. Matt has been leading our Group Finance Team for several years and is therefore perfectly placed to take on the additional responsibilities of this 
role. Further details relating to the recruitment of the Board can be found on pages 37 and 42.
CASUAL WORKERS 
Much of the comment regarding the Group’s use of zero hour contracts has been unfounded and inaccurate. We comply fully with all legal requirements which relate to casual workers, 
including sick pay, holiday pay, and freedom to gain other employment. Casual workers also participate in general incentive schemes.
DIVIDEND 
The Board has decided not to propose a dividend in relation to FY15. The Board remains of the opinion that it is in the best interests of the Group and its shareholders to preserve financial 
flexibility, facilitating the pursuit of potential acquisition and other growth opportunities. The payment of dividends remains under review in future years.
CONCLUSION 
Despite ongoing challenging market conditions, and the weather, we yet again exceeded our targets in FY15. Such success, year on year, is a testament to the hard work and dedication 
of all our workforce for which the Board thank and congratulate them.

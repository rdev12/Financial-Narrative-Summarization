Chairman’s statement 
A positive year for our Company
Greg Lock, Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report a positive year for 
our Company with good progress on 
many fronts for Computacenter. 
Revenue grew 5.4 per cent to a record high 
of £3.072 billion, our adjusted* profit before 
tax was a solid £81.7 million and our strong 
consistent cash generation enabled us 
to make a special return of approximately 
£75 million to our shareholders, in addition 
to regular dividends.
We did not, however, meet our plan in 
France and were disappointed with our 
performance there. While business 
conditions in that country were challenging, 
most of the problems were of our own 
making. We took too long to implement 
the Group ERP system and this resulted 
in logistics issues that have depressed 
our profit and temporarily increased our 
working capital requirements which have,  
in turn, negatively impacted our cash 
position in the short term. 
We managed to stabilise our problem 
contracts in Germany and reengineered 
our processes and organisation there. As a 
result, our German business has performed 
well in 2013, and it is now better positioned 
for the future. In the UK, the business was 
strong in both product sales and Services 
revenues and profit, and we were pleased 
with our progress across all fronts. 
All of this added up to healthy revenue 
growth and solid profit for the Group as 
a whole. 
The implementation of our Group 
Operating Model in the UK and Germany is 
substantially complete and we expect solid 
progress from our businesses in each of 
these countries during 2014. The changes 
in management and organisation we are 
making in France will not deliver much profit 
improvement in the coming year, but we are 
determined to focus on the long term.
We have no borrowings, strong cash flow 
and healthy customer relationships in all 
aspects of our business and we face the 
future with confidence in our strategy  
and in our operational capability. Where  
we have stumbled we have reacted 
vigorously to improve our performance  
and our long-term prospects.
I take this opportunity to thank our 
customers for their confidence in us and 
the business they have given us, and our 
employees for their skills, development 
and performance.
I trust you will find the above summary and 
the details which follow to be fair, balanced 
and understandable.

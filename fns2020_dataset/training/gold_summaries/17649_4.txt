Group at a Glance
By centralising review and approval processes via secure Cloud-based platforms, ZOO’s proprietary 
patented software helps customers to increase their speed of production, reduce costs and protect brand 
integrity. ZOO’s services enable quicker and more cost effective processes across a range of applications, 
formats and markets.
Increasingly the group’s propositions are benefiting 
a variety of companies across sectors where the 
development of media products, printing, packaging 
and marketing involves complex processes in 
multiple countries and languages, and efficient 
collaboration becomes a significant challenge.
Smarter Workflows 
for Creative Media
The group’s largest customers include major Hollywood 
studios, for which the production, marketing and distribution 
of film and video properties in numerous formats across many 
geographies and languages has previously been a lengthy, 
costly and largely manual process. Our services empower 
our clients to operate with greater control, to a higher quality 
and at a lower cost.
ZOO Digital Group plc provides a range of software enabled 
services that support the workflows associated with the design, 
development and distribution of creative media.

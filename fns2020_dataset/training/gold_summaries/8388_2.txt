Highlights of Our Year
Invensys has made a great deal of progress on a number 
of the specific operational and financial priorities set out 
at the start of the financial year, despite a backdrop of 
uncertain and difficult economic and financial markets. 
Highlights for the year include the 2008 Refinancing,  
a cash conversion in excess of 120%, a free cash flow of  
£296 million and net cash and deposits at 31 March 2009 
of £309 million.

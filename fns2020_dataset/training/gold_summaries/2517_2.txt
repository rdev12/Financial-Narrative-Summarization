Investment
A thorough understanding  
of industry needs and product 
development requirements  
drive investment decisions.  
This investment programme  
is central to the success  
of the European operations.
The ongoing investment programme  
at the Zele site will take a significant  
step in 2012 as another five-layer 
agricultural stretch-film line is installed  
to meet growing demand for our  
next generation silage films. 
An additional flexographic printing  
press and upgraded extrusion equipment  
are being installed at the Hardenberg  
site to enable further developments in  
product quality and process efficiency. 
The installation of additional Machine 
Direction Orientation technology at  
the Roeselare site will ensure that BPI 
remains the leading supplier of thinner 
stronger films.
BPI has continued to 
invest in industry leading 
technology to enable  
the development of 
advanced products and 
continual improvements 
in process efficiency. 07

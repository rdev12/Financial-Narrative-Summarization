Key Performance Indicators
The Board considers the key performance indicators by which it measures the performance of the Group 
to be revenue, recurring revenue (both the level and the percentage of total revenue), gross margin, profit 
from operations and earnings per share, both adjusted for amortisation of acquired intangibles, acquisition 
costs, exceptional reorganisation costs and exceptional income. The key performance indicators used by the 
Board are summarised below and the table sets out K3’s performance for the year under review.
Definitions:
Revenue is the gross revenue as reported 
in the financial statements, comprising 
software, hardware, consultancy, and 
support and managed services. This is 
a key measure of activity within each 
business segment and for the Group as 
a whole.
Recurring revenue is the income 
provided for annual licence renewals 
and support for software used by our 
customers. This is a key indicator in 
measuring the underlying resilience and 
growth of the business.
Percentage of recurring revenue 
measures the growth of income 
providing core stability to the business.
Gross margin percentage is calculated as 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
This measure identifies the level of 
contribution derived from each sale or 
component thereof. 
Adjusted profit from operations is 
calculated as profit from operations per 
the financial statements, adjusted for 
the impact of amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, acquisition costs, exceptional 
reorganisation costs and exceptional 
income. This is a key performance 
indicator for quoted companies. 
Adjusted operating cash percentage 
is the operating cash generated after 
adding back cash flows in respect 
of regularising liabilities that were 
significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at 
the date of acquiring companies and 
trades, acquisition costs and exceptional 
reorganisation costs, divided by the 
adjusted operating profit. This is a key 
indicator in measuring the Group’s ability 
to convert operating profit into cash. 
Adjusted EPS is calculated as profit 
for the period, adjusted for the 
tax affected impact of acquired 
intangibles amortisation, exceptional 
reorganisation costs and acquisition 
costs, divided by the weighted average 
number of shares during the period. 
This is a key performance indicator for 
quoted companies. 
Chief Executive’s Review
Strong growth in revenues with significant rise in software at £12.89m (2013: £9.0m) and services at £19.83m (2013: £16.4m).
The improvement in gross margin to 54% reflected higher services revenues and improved software margin.
The adjusted cash flow from operations
*7
 reduced due to higher working capital as the business has grown over the last  
12 months, but has remained healthy at 97% (2013: 170%) of adjusted profit from operations

The K3 Microsoft Dynamics business,

generate additional intellectual 
property, cost effective resourcing 
and improved channels to market, 
particularly to support our new “ax|is” 
solution. Revenue for the total Microsoft 
business increased by 19% year-on-
year to £37.78m (2013: £31.72m) and

The closure of major software wins for 
both our “ax|is” proposition (based on 
Microsoft Dynamics AX) and Dynamics 
NAV product drove a major turnaround in 
the Division’s performance this year. 
After a very encouraging first half, the 
Division continued to perform well, 
fuelled by “ax|is” and improving retail 
sentiment. Divisional revenue increased 
by 34% to £25.26m (2013: £18.86m) and 
turned an adjusted loss
*10
 in the prior 
year of £1.66m into an adjusted profit
*10
 
of £0.65m. As would be expected, the 
improvement in services revenue to 
£8.90m (2013: £5.88m) and software 
revenue to £5.57m (2013: £3.64m) 
has had a major impact on the results. 
However there has also been a large 
increase in the cost of delivery. At the 
half year we highlighted that a significant 
increase in demand for Dynamics AX had 
in turn created a surge in demand for 
skilled Dynamics AX resource. We have 
made a significant short term investment 
on an accelerated programme of global 
recruitment, including near-shoring, and 
training to equip our staff. The reduction 
of costs of delivery is a key initiative for 
future profitable growth in the division.
Having secured a number of pilot orders 
for our “ax|is” product at the end of the 
last financial year, the Division secured 
wins worth a total of £12.63m for the 
solution over the year, across nine major 
contracts. This contributed some 82% 
of the total value of the Division’s new 
wins. Including orders for our established 
Microsoft Dynamics NAV solution, the 
total value of new orders was £15.4m 
over the year (2013: £6.87m). Of these 
orders, we closed £6.16m in the second 
half year, including another two pilot 
projects for “ax|is” that could lead to 
further large orders.
What has helped to drive our new 
Microsoft Dynamics AX orders is our 
intellectual property (“IP”), which 
has created a richer more enhanced 
enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) 
solution for retailers. It is worth noting 
that the average size of Microsoft 
Dynamics AX orders is much larger than 
for our traditional Microsoft Dynamics 
NAV business and that delivery is also 
over a more extended period. We are 
working closely with Microsoft on 
product releases and this relationship on 
product development is benefiting our 
overall stance in the marketplace. 
Whilst our focus has been on the 
Microsoft Dynamics AX proposition, 
our traditional Microsoft Dynamics NAV 
business has also returned to growth with 
two major contracts worth £1.3m secured 
in the year, and a further deal worth 
£0.86m secured since the year end. We 
are also investing in a product upgrade 
path for existing customers to provide 
additional functionality for solutions 
purchased in previous years.
Software income of £5.57m compared to 
£3.64m in the prior period. These sales 
are from a mix of traditionally structured 
deals and Microsoft Enterprise 
Agreements. Enterprise Agreements are 
used by Microsoft on larger contracts 
and under these agreements K3 
receives a “commission” for the software 
delivered to the customer combined 
with follow-on services as normal. We 
estimate that the software recognised 
would have increased by £1.16m to 
£6.73m on the traditional sales basis. 
Recurring maintenance income of 
£9.47m is up 14% over the prior year 
(2013: £8.32m) reflecting the impact of 
new deals and initiatives to encourage 
customer retention.
Whilst the Division is primarily focused 
on the Retail market, it also includes our 
businesses that service the wholesale, 
manufacturing and distribution, and 
events sector. These units saw strong 
growth, with an encouraging level of 
new contract wins in both our AX and 
NAV businesses. Revenues grew by 
18% to £7.43m (2013: £6.27m) with a 
strong recovery in adjusted profit from 
operations
*11
 to £0.49m (2013: £0.10m). 
We also saw some good growth in our 
point of sales RSG business that focuses 
on the events sector, utilising the 
Microsoft Dynamics RMS product. The 
opportunities in this area encouraged 
us to make a small acquisition of a 
competitor (RTL) in July 2014.
At 30 June 2014, the pipeline for the 
Division was at £37.9m (2013: £38.8m). 
This excludes approximately £7.18m still 
to be delivered on the large contracts 
won in the current year.
Microsoft UK Division
Divisional revenue increased by 34% to £25.26m  
(2013: £18.86m) and turned an adjusted loss in the

The International Division includes 
our Dutch Microsoft Dynamics reseller 
business, our Point of Sale business 
focused on smaller retailers, and our 
ISV (software author and channel 
management) company. 
The ISV contains the “ax|is” product 
set developed in conjunction with the 
Microsoft UK Division, which has been 
pivotal in the improvement in the results 
of the Group. Early market interest in 
our enhanced retail solution is very 
encouraging and Microsoft’s support for 
our software development programme 
has led to a deepening relationship  
with them. 
Revenue was broadly flat year-on-year 
at £12.53m (2013: £12.86m), however 
adjusted profit from operations
*12
 
decreased to £1.54m (2013: £2.26m). 
Whilst the slow recovery of the Dutch 
fashion and retail market has continued 
to be a major factor in the business 
performance, we have also made 
an investment in resources in the 
Dynamics AX product, which we have 
not historically sold in this territory. This 
division also includes our global reseller 
channel and personnel engaged in the 
development and marketing of our “ax|is” 
software product, which is having a 
profound impact on Group performance. 
Software sales at £1.93m were up 
19% (2013:£1.62m) though services 
revenues at £4.64m were down 3% 
(2013: £4.81m). Margins at 50% showed 
an improvement over the prior year as 
the development of product has been in 
full swing throughout the year and more 
cost has been capitalised. There has 
however been a significant increase in 
sales and marketing personnel to build 
our channel team and prepare the Dutch 
business to become a player in the local 
Dynamics AX market, having previously 
focused on the Dynamics NAV product.
Our relationship with Inter IKEA 
Systems B.V. (the owner and franchisor 
of the IKEA concept and the largest 
customer in the Group) continues to 
be very strong, with good levels of 
services income on planned projects, 
with further potential business to 
come. Shortly before the year end we 
commenced a major work stream for 
one of the franchisees and we are being 
encouraged by certain franchisees 
to use our expertise to assist them in 
other activities.
The Unisoft business is performing in 
line with our expectations with its RVE 
Point of Sale product gaining traction, 
whilst the market remains difficult. The 
move to subscription based sales is a 
big change, reducing the sales cycle 
down to weeks instead of months and 
building a recurring revenue base with 
commitments up to five years. Sales in 
the current year at £3.45m were in line 
with the prior year (2013: £3.48m). We 
are looking at the wider potential sales 
opportunities for this product. 
The Division secured a total of £3.2m 
of major order wins (2013: £1.13m). 
The prospects pipeline, excluding 
potential business anticipated in a long 
term plan with Inter IKEA Systems B.V., 
currently amounts to £6.7m of orders 
(2013: £5.2m), highlighting that further 
improvement in business performance 
can be expected.

Revenues at the SYSPRO and Sage 
Division increased marginally to £26.02m 
(2013: £25.38m). Adjusted profit from 
operations
*13
 was satisfactory at £5.07m 
(2013: £5.58m), with the reduction mainly 
due to investment in sales resources 
in Sage and the acceleration of a 
programme in our SYSPRO business that 
is designed to replace employees likely to 
retire in the coming years. 
The Division’s recurring revenues 
remain high at £15.12m, albeit a £0.86m 
decrease on last year (2013: £15.98m), 
with the reduction reflecting the disposal 
of a small non-core Sage business in 
May 2013. SYSPRO maintenance and 
support levels remained strong with 
a 97% renewal rate (2013: 98%). Total 
software sales were excellent at £5.00m 
(2013: £3.84m) and total services income 
increased by £0.32m to £5.56m (2013: 
£5.24m).
The SYSPRO operation is the exclusive 
UK and sole European SYSPRO partner 
with a rolling five year distribution 
agreement. It has over £1.0m of income 
from own IP products covering functional 
requirements which are usually found 
only in significantly more expensive 
software. The SYSPRO business remains 
strong with high levels of recurring 
income, excellent management of 
opportunities and encouraging levels of 
new business wins. These increasingly 
involve elements of hosted services. 
The SYSPRO business secured 14 new 
wins in total worth £2.34m compared 
with ten worth £1.77m last year. The 
majority of these new deals came 
with extended period maintenance 
agreements. At the year end the pipeline 
was £2.8m (2013: £3.4m), the reduction 
coming about as a result of a number of 
the current year wins were sizeable and 
are taking longer to replace. 
Our SYSPRO customer base generates 
high levels of recurring revenues through 
annual software licence and support 
renewals, with income at £7.35m (2013: 
£6.96m). The major part of this income 
is recognised at the annual renewal 
date in October, giving the first half in 
this division a significant weighting 
compared to the second half. We will be 
investing in new resources over the next 
year to underpin longer term continuity 
within our professional services team and 
to take advantage of new technologies 
that will improve our own IP products, 
maintaining our competitive advantage.
After a slow start to the year as it 
reorganised its delivery and support 
functions and recruited a new Sales 
Director (ex-Sage), our K3 Sage operation 
enjoyed an extremely good second half 
year. In total, we signed 87 deals worth 
£3.7m over the year (2013: 60 deals 
worth £2.05m). The second half year was 
very strong for Sage’s new X3 Enterprise 
level solution and we closed 12 deals 
worth £1.85m. We have an extremely 
popular standard template X3 model 
that allows us to deliver an ERP solution 
in less than 60 man days, which is almost 
unheard of for a relatively functionally 
rich ERP product. The X3 product is also 
sold in a premium version for larger 
implementations and this is a market that 
we are gradually moving into. 
Our other business units in the Division 
have customers who can be offered 
upgrade opportunities to our Enterprise 
level solutions and hosting. These 
businesses contributed £3.58m (2013: 
£3.24m) of sales in the year. £2.50m of the 
income is recurring (2013: £2.52m). 
The pipeline of prospects for the Division 
totalled £17.0m (2013: £14.8m) after 
significant wins in the final quarter of the 
financial year.

The Managed Services Division offers  
a range of application solutions 
delivered on-premises, hosted or via 
‘Software as a Service’ using hosting 
centres in Philadelphia, London, 
Edinburgh and Toronto. 
Revenue over the year rose by 27% 
to £8.15m (2013: £6.41m) and moved 
back into profit, generating £0.43m 
of adjusted profit from operations
*14 
(2013: adjusted loss
*14
 of £0.56m). 
The move back into profitability was 
achieved through a combination of 
increased revenues and lower operating 
costs. At the beginning of the year we 
recruited a small team of “operating 
system” consultants, who are delivering 
managed services for a number of our 
retail clients who were reported in 
our Microsoft UK division. Prior year 
comparatives for divisional results have 
not been restated as the impact is not 
material to the Group.
The run rate of recurring income at the 
year-end showed a 16% increase year-on-
year to £5.30m (2013: £4.55m). Hosting 
represented £2.75m (2013: £2.78m) of 
this recurring revenue, having lost a 
major contract in the second half year 
with an external customer. 
We have focused very strongly on 
widening the product offering to include 
“network as a service” , “platform as a 
service” and “infrastructure as a service” , 
in addition to our traditional “ERP as a 
service” model. Our ability to host multi-
site overseas customers offers significant 
growth opportunities with deal wins of 
this nature in both AX and SYSPRO. We 
also expect to benefit from the marked 
improvement in new order wins in the 
Microsoft UK division in due course.
The pipeline of demand for hosting has 
increased to £4.1m (2013: £3.37m).

Central costs
*15
 for the year were £0.39m (2013: 
£0.53m). These costs included Directors’ costs, group 
human resources, accounting and legal personnel, 
and costs associated with the Plc including financing. 
The costs are stated net of recovery of elements 
recharged to the operating units. The costs have 
fallen year on year due to changes in management 
implemented in the second half year.
Change in  
reporting structure
It should be noted that in future the 
Board intends to report the Group’s 
performance by reference to its 
industry sectors (retail, manufacturing 
and distribution) and its global 
intellectual property.
Outlook
The investments we have made 
over the last two years in Microsoft 
technology are starting to yield real 
benefits for the Group. We believe that 
there is significant long term potential 
to accelerate and widen sales for our 
new enhanced Microsoft Dynamic 
AX solution. The route is via further 
development of our global partner 
channel, which also brings margin 
benefits, and the launch of additional 
Dynamics AX products over the next 
few years, tailoring our existing “ax|is” 
template with IP for various retail market 
segments. Our deepening relationship 
with Microsoft is another positive step 
forward as we seek to scale the growth.
Whilst there are further costs to growth, 
we are also concentrating on driving 
margins and expect to see these improve 
progressively over the near term.
Overall, we continue to remain very 
encouraged by growth prospects  
and look forward to another year  
of progression.

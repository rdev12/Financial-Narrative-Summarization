On site at Weir Minerals Chile, 
who were recently awarded a 
new maintenance contract with 
Minera Escondida, the world’s 
largest copper mine.
Weir Gabbioneta process pumps 
destined for Russia’s Tartarstan 
region which is expected to refine 
up to seven million metric tons of 
crude oil per year. 
Reducing component travel 
distance by 94% and set up 
times by 42% gave Weir SPM 
the operational edge to win 
the Group’s manufacturing 
excellence award.
Weir’s excellent technical service 
helped Peak Gold’s New South 
Wales mine increase throughput 
and reduce costs with a mill liner 
re-design.
Part of Minerals de-watering range, 
the patented GEHO APEXS
®
 
power saving pump moves large 
volumes of abrasive, corrosive 
slurries at high pressures.
With an extensive, successful 
track record of hydro work in the 
UK, our power business is seeing 
similar ongoing demand for 
refurbishment projects in Canada. 
Power & Industrial’s service 
skills have seen them extend 
their geographic reach with 
a multi-million dollar contract 
on a natural gas platform in 
the South China Sea.
Market overview  
The global economic downturn and 
associated decline in commodity prices 
resulted in difficult market conditions  
in 2009. While commodity production 
volumes were lower early in the year 
there was notable improvement in the 
second half supported by investment in  
Asian infrastructure. 
 
 
 
 
  
Weir Minerals is the global leader in the 
provision of slurry handling equipment 
and associated spare parts for abrasive 
high wear applications used in mining 
as well as in the niche oil sands and flue 
gas desulphurisation markets. Products 
include pumps, hydro cyclones, valves, 
de-watering equipment and wear 
resistant linings. Investment in materials, 
technology and engineered hydraulics 
ensure world class performance. The 
division is present in key mining markets, 
including South and North America, 
Australia and Africa.

Market overview  
The North American upstream market 
experienced reduced activity with lower 
demand for natural gas. At the mid-year, 
rig count had reduced by around 50% 
before starting to recover in the second 
half. Significant downstream project 
opportunities were driven principally by 
Middle East refining expansion. 
 
 
 
 
  
Weir Oil & Gas designs and manufactures 
pumps and ancillary equipment for 
global upstream and downstream oil and 
gas markets and provides substantial 
aftermarket service and support activities. 
Upstream operations specialise in high-
pressure well service pumps and related 
flow control equipment along with repairs, 
parts and service of pressure control and 
rotating equipment. Downstream focuses 
on design and manufacture of centrifugal 
pumps, mainly for the refining industry. 
Principal operations are in North America, 
Europe and the Middle East.

Market overview  
The original equipment power market 
continued to be buoyant in Asia, but 
depressed elsewhere. The strong Asian 
market has been driven by China’s 
nuclear new build. New coal and nuclear 
plant delays in Europe and North America 
have resulted in increased potential for 
service and life extension projects. 
 
 
 
 
  
Weir Power & Industrial designs, 
manufactures and provides aftermarket 
support for specialist and critical-service 
rotating and flow control equipment, in 
the main, to the global power sector. 
The division includes valve operations, a 
specialist pump business and substantial 
service and aftermarket operations and 
is one of only a few businesses globally 
capable of providing specialist valves into 
the nuclear islands of third generation 
nuclear power stations. Facilities are 
located in Europe, North America, China, 
Middle East, India and South Africa.

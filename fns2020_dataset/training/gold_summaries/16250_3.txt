Chairman’s Review
2004 has been a very strong year for UBM. Group operating
profit* increased by 33.1% to £132.3 million (2003: £99.4
million). Earnings per share* increased by 36.4% to 32.6p
(2003: 23.9p). The board is recommending a final dividend
of 8.37p (2003: 5.7p) bringing the total dividend for the
year to 12.0p (2003: 9.0p) an increase of 33.3% reflecting
the strong performance during the year and the directors’
confidence in the outlook for the future.
The Group has intensified its focus on an integrated multi-
media strategy, harnessing technology to give our customers
more responsive feedback on the effectiveness of their spend
and leveraging UBM’s strong online positions across all its
channels to market – an integrated multi-media proposition.
We are continuing to invest significantly in this area and our
organic initiatives have contributed to an underlying revenue
growth for the Group of 3.2%.
During the year we acquired certain MediMedia businesses
(now CMPMedica) which now makes healthcare our largest
sector and gives a more balanced sectoral spread. Since the
year-end we have announced three more acquisitions, all of
which are a strong strategic fit and also meet our exacting
financial criteria. Over the last 2 years all acquisitions have
exceeded their business case. At the end of January 2005,
we announced that we were undertaking a strategic review
of our market research business which includes the
possibility of a sale of these assets.
Our balance sheet is strong helped by a reduction in the tax
creditor from £308.5m to £208.0m.
At the heart of any organisation are its people and the values
they embrace. During the year significant work has been
done to define our values more closely. The Board takes very
seriously adherence to these values because they are so
important to the perception of UBM from customers,
suppliers, potential employees and shareholders. To all our
employees, on behalf of the Board, a sincere thank you for
the tremendous results you have achieved during the year.
I am also pleased to welcome two new non-executive
directors to the Board; Chris Hyman joined in May and
Sandy Leitch in January 2005. Both bring significant
experience to the Board.
2004 was also memorable because at the year-end we
announced that at the beginning of April 2005 David Levin
would succeed Clive Hollick as CEO of UBM. It was always
clear to me, and the rest of the Board, that Clive’s succession
was likely to be one of the most significant items ‘on my
watch’.
Clive has been at the helm of UBM in its various incarnations
for over 30 years – in itself a staggering feat. From the early
roots in Hambro’s in 1974 then Vavasseur the money broking
business was formed in MAI. This was then nurtured, and
significant value returned to shareholders in 1998. He was a
founding director of NOP World in 1989 – his patience,
encouragement and foresight has grown it to its current
form. In 1991 he was a founder of Meridian Broadcasting
which then formed the heart of our developing TV assets
which we sold in 2000 for £1.75billion – returning £1.25
billion to shareholders. Similarly, he has nurtured our stake in
Channel 5 from its foundation in 1995 to the valuable and
growing asset that it is today. These are just a few examples
of the pattern: spot an opportunity, invest, grow and develop
it; be patient, then when and if the timing is right, realise the
value for shareholders. His record is a matter of public record
and one that is extremely difficult to match over such a long
period of time, furthermore, it is still intact. He also
developed a strong internal team such that we had a choice
of several worthy internal successors to consider.
The succession process that we adopted was clear and
rigorous. In the end, the Board concluded that David Levin
was the strongest candidate to succeed Clive – no easy task
by any means. David’s experience includes a successful track
record in publishing with Euromoney, then with Psion and
currently as CEO of Symbian. He has exemplary people skills,
deep knowledge of publishing and technology and extensive
experience in international markets – the Far East, Europe
and USA. He has an impressive operational background with
a strong record of strategic execution. We are all excited
about him joining and heading up UBM.
When I was contemplating joining the Board in 1996,
I thought with Clive at the helm life would not be boring.
I have not been disappointed! Clive, you leave the Group in
tremendous shape, sincere thanks to you from everyone at
UBM – we will miss you but we also have a worthy successor.

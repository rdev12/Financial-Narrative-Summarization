The Group’s performance this year
ITE has delivered a good nancial 
per ormance in its lesser iennial 
 ear which re ects a good trading 
per ormance in most o its mar ets 
together with a rst time contri ution 
 rom ac uisitions, ut o set  an 
increase in the cost ase o Mos uild 
which relocated to a new venue and 
 aced a new competitive threat. ITE 
has made a num er o smaller olt on 
ac uisitions in the ear in U raine 
and India, ut the main ocus o 
management has een to integrate 
properl and consolidate the large 
ac uisitions which the Group made 
during 2011. 
Revenues or the ear o £172 million 
represent an 11% increase over last 
 ear, and volume sales o 799,000m
2
 
represent growth o 24% over last ear. 
These results re ect growth in the core 
port olio and recent ac uisitions. On a 
li e or li e asis revenue growth o 3% 
was earned on volume sales growth o 
2%. Trading conditions in most o our 
mar ets were consistentl strong and 
most o our mar ets delivered revenue 
growth gures o more than 10%, 
although Moscow and the U were 
e ceptions to this. 
The ma or impact on our results 
this ear came rom ITE s premiere 
construction event Mos uild which 
represents one third o our e hi ition 
 usiness in Moscow. Following a 
decision  its host venue to launch 
its own competitive event in the 
construction sector, ITE had in 2011 
made the decision to relocate Mos uild 
to another venue which o ered more 
secure terms or its uture. The results 
this ear re ect the nancial impact 
o this upheaval ut also underpin the 
strength and resilience o this event. 
Mos uild in underl ing terms sta ed 
 roadl the same si e  despite acing 
the dual challenges o relocation and 
new competition. E hi ition sales 
achieved were 66,000m
2
 compared 
to 77,600m
2
 in 2011, the change mostl 
re ecting a iennial pattern within 
one o its sectors. However the cost 
 ase o the show increased  circa 
£3 million in the new venue, which in 
addition to the iennial e ect on the 
revenues negativel a ected ITE s 
2012 pro ts  circa £4.5 million. 
This one o step up in costs has now 
 een a sor ed and sales or the 2013 
event are, to date, progressing in line 
with e pectations. 
E cluding Mos uild, the li e or li e 
revenues rom the Russian e hi ition 
 usiness grew  4% this ear. Trading 
conditions in the Central Asia mar ets 
were strong and supported a 21% 
improvement in li e or li e revenues. 
In Southern and Eastern Europe, good 
trading conditions helped the region to 
deliver 6% li e or li e revenue growth, 
which together with a strong rst time 
contri ution rom Tur e uild and the 
new U rainian ac uisitions helped the 
region to its est ever result. Our U 
 usiness MODA also had a good ear 
with growth rom its minorit sta es in 
niche ashion usinesses and a solid 
per ormance rom its mainstream 
 ashion event. 
The main actors a ecting Group 
pro ta ilit this ear are summarised 
in the pro t ridge opposite.
Development of the business
ITE has ocused this ear on properl 
integrating the new usinesses it 
ac uired last ear, as well as la ing the 
groundwor or developing a usiness 
plat orm in Asia. Two o the larger 
ac uisitions in 2011 were in Russia 
(MV and rasnodar). The rasnodar 
 usiness made a ull ear contri ution 
with revenues o £8.4 million and a 
pro t contri ution o £2.4 million, oth 
 etter than our e pectations at time 
o ac uisition. The MV usiness in 
Moscow per ormed well in delivering 
revenues this ear o £14.8 million and 
a contri ution o £5.2 million, despite 
the competitive environment and the 
relocation o some o its events. 
Tur e uild, also ac uired last ear, 
made its rst contri ution to ITE s 
results and delivered its est ever 
result with revenues o £7.3 million 
and a contri ution o £3.2 million.
The Russian management team has 
 een consolidated into a regional 
management structure. The nancial 
and operating s stems o the our 
 usinesses are now managed on a 
common plat orm and the various 
show identities and rands are eing 
com ined. e have identi ed a num er 
o good opportunities to cross launch 
events rom one region to another and 
to cross sell etween events. Li ewise 
in Tur e there has een a change in 
management structure to a sor the 
newl ac uired Tur e uild. 
 e made some small complementar 
ac uisitions this ear which have helped 
to uild the pro le o ITE s usiness in 
U raine, India and the U . In Decem er 
2011 ITE completed the ac uisition o 
the Autoe po port olio o events in 
U raine, which rought a num er o 
complementar events (winter tourism, 
logistics) into the port olio, ut whose 
principal asset is the dominant motor 
show ta ing place in U raine. Later in 
the ear we ac uired two events in the 
 eaut sector (Beaute ), which is a 
new sector or ITE, ut o considera le 
growth potential in other regions where 
ITE operates. In India we made two 
small ac uisitions in the ear  one a 
port olio o engineering events ased in 
Mum ai and one o construction related 
events in Chennai. India s e hi ition 
 usiness is currentl regional with no 
single large e hi ition acilit , and the 
route to e pansion is through regional 
cloning. Having a regional capa ilit 
now provides the Group with a plat orm 
 or running events in Mum ai and 
Chennai. In the U , MODA increased 
the scope o its London ased ashion 
 usiness through the ac uisition o 
 ac et Re uired , a ast growing niche 
menswear event.
ITE s priorit in Russia and CIS over 
the ne t ear is to continue the organic 
growth initiatives started this ear. 
The Group will also continue to loo or 
opportunities to e pand the usiness 
model, oth in mar et and  uilding 
a coherent e hi ition usiness in Asia. Business Review

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REVIEW CONTINUED 
Having done much o the groundwor 
this ear we are well positioned to 
ma e good progress ne t ear. 
Announced toda was the ac uisition 
o a 28.3% minorit sta e in ABEC, the 
largest independent organiser in India. 
ITE plans to co operate with this new 
partner and ecome a ma orit owner 
within the ne t three ears. One o the 
e citing aspects o this partnership is 
that ITE now has ownership o the 
premier construction events in Russia, 
Tur e and India, three o the astest 
growing emerging mar ets.
The international exhibition business
The glo al e hi ition mar et was 
estimated to e worth circa 25 illion 
in 2011. The ollowing ta le sets out the 
distri ution o the world s e hi ition 
 usiness and shows that almost hal 
 value is in the USA, and circa 
three uarters is in developed mar ets. 
There is a road correlation etween 
the amount o e hi ition space in a 
countr and the si e o a countr s 
e hi ition industr . 
The emerging and developing mar et 
e hi ition usiness is small when 
compared to the developed world, 
 ut aster growing. Russia, Tur e and 
the CIS countries together account or 
 ust over 1 illion (4%) o the world s 
e hi ition usiness and the Asian 
mar ets (China, India and South East 
Asia) account or circa 10%.
Pro ected uture growth rates or the 
e hi ition industr are set out opposite.
ITE is the eighth largest organiser in 
the world  revenue, and the third 
largest in emerging mar ets. ITE is the 
largest e hi ition organiser in Russia 
with an estimated mar et share o over 
20%. ITE is in a stronger position in 
most o its Central Asian usinesses 
with a leading mar et position and 
status as the dominant international 
e hi ition organiser. In Tur e ITE has 
a strong mar et position (8% o the 
mar et) though its usiness is more 
locall ased and there are a num er 
o other international organisers 
competing in di erent sectors. All o 
these mar ets are e pected to grow in 
the uture at a ove average rates or 
the industr and a large part o ITE s 
strateg is ased around ensuring we 
continue to e mar et leaders in 
these mar ets. 
ITE aims to appl its ree cash ow 
 rom its e hi ition usinesses in 
e panding its usiness model to new 
mar ets, where there is good potential 
 or growth in the uture. The current 
 ocus is on developing a usiness 
in rastructure in India, South East Asia 
and China to ensure our e hi ition 
port olio can participate in the 
e pected growth in these regions. 
ITE’s ob ectives and strategy
ITE s usiness o ectives are to:
 – Create sustaina le growth in 
headline earnings per share
 – Create and maintain sustaina le 
positions o mar et leadership in the 
e hi ition usiness in emerging and 
developing mar ets.
ITE s strategic priorities or achieving 
these o ectives are: 
i. to strengthen and develop e isting 
positions o mar et leadership 
ii. to e pand the usiness model into 
new sectors and geographies where 
there is potential to develop strong 
mar et positions 
iii. to grow and improve its port olio 
o international e hi ition rands 
iv. to invest in the development o 
management talent in ITE. 
v. ITE s per ormance against its 
strategic o ectives is set out elow:
(i) To strengthen and develop its 
existing positions of market 
leadership.
ITE s positions o mar et leadership 
are ounded on its a ilit to generate 
international sales, its recognised 
 rands, its local o ce in rastructure 
and its longstanding relationships 
with venues.
International sales strength 
ITE s a ilit to generate international 
sales di erentiates it rom most o its 
local competition in Russia and the 
related CIS mar ets. Through its 
su sidiar sales o ces the Group has 
esta lished a lo al customer ase and 
a specialisation in promoting sales into 
ITE s Russian and CIS e hi itions. In 
2012 the total net metres sold  the 
Group s international sales o ces 
increased  18% to 115,500m
2
. This 
represents circa 23% o the Group s 
2012 revenues, the same proportion 
as achieved in 2011 re ecting the 
ac uisition o new usinesses which 
are mostl weighted towards local 
sales. The Group has invested in 
 uilding up its international sales 
presence this ear, opening a new 
o ce in Mala sia to target potential 
customers rom South East Asia. 
Appro imatel 9% o revenues were 
sold  the Group s London o ce, 4% 
 its German o ce, 3%  its Chinese 
o ce and 3%  its Tur ish o ce. 
ITE’s international brands
ITE has esta lished strong rand 
identit in certain e hi ition sectors. 
In particular, the Build rand in 
construction, the Oil & Gas events 
 rand, the ITE Travel e hi ition and 
 orld Food rands all have strong 
reputations as leading events in the 
Russian and CIS mar ets earned 
through more than 15 ears o 
sustained good per ormance. 
The Group is wor ing to increase 
recognition or these rands in other 
emerging mar ets. There are also 
a num er o new and developing 
local rands in securit , transport, 
pac aging, printing and mining events. 
The Group is wor ing to consolidate 
and esta lish these rands more visi l 
in the international e hi ition world.
Building ITE’s local of ce 
infrastructure 
ITE s rands have uilt their 
reputation through sustained deliver 
o success ul e hi itions to customers. 
The oundation o this is in ITE s local

an e hi ition success ul or ITE s

competitive advantage over other 
international organisers and a arrier 
to entr or new organisers wishing 
to run events in these mar ets. ITE 
continues to strengthen its local 
o ce presence through investment 
in in rastructure and training its 
sta . There is a high level o e uit 
ownership in the Group with more 
than 51% o sta participating in 
e uit schemes o some description. 
Maintaining venue relationships
ITE has esta lished long standing 
relationships with the venues that 
host its e hi itions. Historicall ITE has 
supported the development o venue 
 acilities which in turn has helped the 
Group s e hi itions to prosper. Through 
this ITE has esta lished rights to run its 
main e hi ition themes in its chosen 
venues at the time o its choice. ITE has 
continued to wor on maintaining and 
improving the venue relationships that 
underpin its usiness. Most o ITE s 
ma or events have agreements which 
provide or venue acilities or at least 
three ears ahead. This ear ITE has 
agreed outline terms or holding its 
shows in the new St Peters urg venue, 
which is due to e completed  2014. 
(ii) To expand the business model 
into new sectors and geographies 
where there is potential to develop 
strong market positions.
In e isting mar ets this strateg 
means targeting new sectors or 
regions in which to ac uire or develop 
 usinesses where there is potential 
 or the participation o international 
e hi itors. In new mar ets, ITE is 
targeting the development o 
e hi ition usinesses where there 
is clear opportunit or strong 
 uture growth. 
This ear the Group has e panded 
the industr sectors in its U rainian 
 usiness. Through its ac uisitions o 
Autoe po and Beaute the U rainian 
 usiness has gained e posure to the 
automotive and eaut cosmetics 
sectors. The eaut sector is new to 
ITE, and one we hope to e a le to 
replicate into other mar ets in the near 
 uture. The Group aims to increase 
its involvement in a roader range o 
sectors in India, and made two small 
ac uisitions this ear, one in the 
industrial machiner sector and 
one in the construction sector. 
(iii) To grow and improve its portfolio 
of international brands. 
The Group s management has een 
wor ing to improve the strength o 
ITE s e isting international rands and 
to improve international recognition o 
its local rands. As part o this, some 
industr vertical groupings have een 
esta lished to ensure consistenc o 
presentation and message across the 
Group. Developing the international 
recognition and strength o its rands 
improves the Group s a ilit to 
success ull clone its events into 
new geographies. 
(iv) To invest in the development 
of management talent in ITE.
The Group emplo s a management 
structure that encourages creativit , 
promotes responsi ilit and acilitates 
the change that is re uired to maintain 
and strengthen ITE s position as a 
mar et leader. This structure relies on 
e perienced and s illed managers who 
are either nurtured through the ITE 
s stem or recruited or their a ilit to 
contri ute towards the development 
o the usiness.
Over two decades, ITE has uilt a 
reputation or producing e ective 
and respected trade events in growing 
and developing mar ets. This has een 
achieved  setting standards that 
e ceed customer e pectations as 
well as the standards delivered  
rival organisers.
As competition naturall intensi es and 
e pectations grow, ITE has to meet the 
challenge o constant improvement. 
The Compan recognises that this 
doesn t happen  chance  it happens 
 ecause o the s ills, ualities and 
commitment o the Group s sta .
 e have made some good progress in 
developing the strength and depth o 
the management team in the ear as 
well as improving the communication 
 etween the di erent o ces. e have 
 urther developed our Group intranet as 
well as opening up communication  
 unctional management i.e. connecting 
sta lines across the di erent o ces 
such as construction mar eting IT. e 
have started on a rolling programme 
o internal senior management and 
 unctional con erences, and launched 
a series o leadership training courses 
to urther develop our internal 
management resource.

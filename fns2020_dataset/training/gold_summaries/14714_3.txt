I am pleased to report that 2007 
saw a further improvement in 
the performance of the Group. 
During the course of the year, 
the Group has restructured its 
core operations; strengthened 
its management team with 
experienced senior staff to 
run each of the key operating 
divisions; delivered further 
improvements to efﬁ ciency 
of its support operations; and 
accelerated the growth strategy 
both organically by increasing 
the number of sales consultants; 
and by acquisition through the 
purchase of the Glotel business.
The culture of the Company has 
changed. We have focussed our 
people on delivering excellent 
service to our candidates and 
clients. We have endeavoured 
to recruit the best people by 
providing an environment of 
high reward, recognition and 
motivation. We believe we will 
retain and develop these staff to 
put us in a position where we can 
outshine the competition. This 
policy has created a workplace 
that whilst challenging and 
competitive is also a fun and 
rewarding place to work. We 
believe our company provides 
opportunities for our staff to fulﬁ l 
their ambitions by providing a 
structured career in which they 
can grow and develop their 
talents.
Our management team are 
highly motivated and ambitious 
to further grow our organisation 
both organically and through 
selective acquisitions. The last 
twelve months have laid down 
an extremely strong platform to 
enable these goals to be realised.
Our results for 2007 reﬂ ect the 
successful execution of our plans 
and the consequent continued 
improvement in the ﬁ nancial 
health of the Group. Revenues 
increased 6.3% to £432.8 million, 
but the more relevant measure of 
volume in our business, net fee 
income, improved by 22.7% to 
£56.1 million. Pre-tax proﬁ ts were 
£7.1 million, an improvement of 
31.2% compared to the prior 
year, with basic earnings per share 
of 3.76p, up 22.1% on 2006. 
The Group’s balance sheet 
remains healthy with total assets 
of £158.3 million, compared with 
£139.5 million at 31 December 
2006. Closing net cash at the year 
end was £35.0 million compared 
with £46.9 million last year, 
reﬂ ecting the £30.8 million cash 
outﬂ ow for the Glotel business 
and continued strong cash 
generation from the underlying 
business.
...and expanded geographically.

completion of the acquisition 
of Glotel plc in July and the 
integration of the Glotel business 
was completed during the second 
half of the year. Since acquisition, 
the Glotel business has been 
trading ahead of our expectations 
and the Board expects this 
acquisition to be earnings 
enhancing in 2008. 
 
Whilst market commentators have 
mixed views on the prospects 
for the recruitment sector in 
2008, our business is, so far this 
year, trading in-line with our 
expectations. We will continue 
to review opportunities to grow 
our Company by looking at new 
markets and possible acquisitions, 
but we remain determined to 
invest wisely in and continue to 
build the business for the beneﬁ t 
of our shareholders. The Group 
is well placed to make further 
progress in 2008.
SPRING STAFF
The continued progress shown by 
the Group in 2007 is a function 
of the efforts from all of the staff

like to extend the appreciation 
of the Board and shareholders to 
the staff at Spring and to thank 
them for their dedication to the 
Group and to all of our clients and 
candidates.

Our AGM will be held on

welcoming shareholders there.

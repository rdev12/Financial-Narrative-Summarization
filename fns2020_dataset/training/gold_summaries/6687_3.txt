 4 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Directors’ Report: Business Review
Chairman’s statement
The effects of the economic downturn
during the past twelve months have
demanded exceptional effort to stay on
track.We have achieved that and have
delivered a good set of results as a
consequence.
Our long standing strategy is to
deliver high quality passenger transport
services in dense, urban markets, primarily
through bus and rail.This has provided us with
a core of strong and sustainable positions in
regulated and deregulated bus markets, which
have been resilient in the current economic
environment.The bus operations are
complemented by our significant UK rail
presence which consists of a 65% share in
three strategically selected, commuter focused
rail franchises.These are tightly managed to
deliver shareholder value and we are delighted
to have retained the Southern franchise for
another five years from September 2009.
Business performance highlights
Overall, revenue increased by £147.0m,
or 6.7%, to £2,346.1m (2008: £2,199.1m)
primarily due to a full year of London Midland
and Gatwick Express rail revenue. Operating
profit* was slightly ahead of our expectations
at £123.6m, albeit £21.3m or 14.7% below last
year’s particularly strong result (2008:
£144.9m).Adjusted earnings per share (before
amortisation and exceptional items) were
152.3p (2008: 174.8p) and basic earnings per
share were 14.7p (2008: 128.8p). Profit for the
year,after tax and exceptional items, was
£18.3m (2008: £76.8m).
Dividends
Following the Group’s good performance,
the Board is proposing a final dividend of
55.5p per share (2008: 55.5p) to maintain
the total dividend for the year at 81p (2008:
81p).The final dividend is payable on 20
November 2009 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business
on 6 November 2009.
The Board of Directors
and Governance
Christopher Collins retired from the Board
as a Non-Executive Director on 23
October 2008.As I said last year, we will
miss Christopher’s significant contribution
to the Group.Andrew Allner joined the
Board as a Non-Executive Director and
Chairman of the Audit Committee on 24
October 2008. Rupert Pennant-Rea was
appointed as the Senior Independent
Director on 23 October 2008.
On track
“We believe we
are well placed for
the year ahead,
although we
continue to assume
economic
conditions in
the UK will
remain difficult
over the next
twelve months.” Sir Patrick Brown, Chairman The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 5
Information in this Annual Report
The Group has always been committed
to open and transparent reporting.
We recognise the importance of
enhancing our disclosure in these
challenging economic times so that
our shareholders are able to better
understand our business. In this year’s
Annual Report we have provided more
information on the Group’s markets,
strategy, performance against financial and
non-financial Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) and risks.We have also provided
more detail about corporate governance
and the Group’s devolved nature and
local focus.
Corporate Responsibility
As a public transport operator, corporate
responsibility is integral to the way we run
our business.The safety and security of
our passengers, our people and the
general public is an absolute priority for
the Group.We have included employee,
bus and rail safety KPIs throughout this
report.Although we operate through a
devolved structure, we recognise the
importance of sharing best practice.This
year we strengthened the Group’s health
& safety forums to enhance the transfer
of knowledge and expertise across the
Group.
We remain committed to improving the
energy efficiency of our operations. Not
only does this have important
environmental benefits but it helps to
reduce operating costs. Key Group wide
energy saving initiatives are highlighted
throughout this report which we estimate
will reduce annual operating costs by
around £5m and CO
2
emissions by
30,000 tonnes. One of our primary
environmental responsibility measures is
CO
2
emissions per passenger journey
(ppj) for bus and rail. Overall, this has
increased slightly from last year as a result
of the full year contribution from London
Midland, a predominantly diesel, and
therefore more carbon intensive,
franchise. Excluding London Midland, the
underlying measure has reduced by 2%.
Employees
The number of employees in the Group
averaged 27,177 for the financial year,
below last year’s 27,627 due to the various
restructuring programmes across the
Group. I would like to thank all of our
employees for their dedication and hard
work through these challenging economic
conditions, ensuring that we remain a
strong and successful Group.
Outlook
We have not changed our overall view on
the outlook since our trading update in
June 2009.We believe we are well placed
for the year ahead, although we continue
to assume economic conditions in the UK
will remain difficult over the next twelve
months.
Our bus operations have proven to
be robust and we expect demand for
these services to remain strong.
Our rail operations should deliver a good
level of profitability in the year ahead, albeit
below the level achieved to June 2009. Our

aim is to supplement the expected modest
growth in underlying passenger revenue with
additional revenue from our new high speed
rail services in Southeastern, revenue
initiatives in our new Southern franchise and
comprehensive cost control across all three
franchises.
In aviation services, we expect our
ongoing restructuring programme to
protect against near term deterioration
whilst strengthening our position for the
medium term.
Our strategy remains to provide high quality
public transport services in the UK, targeting
organic growth through the economic cycle
and from value-adding capital investment
and acquisitions.We will maintain our
financial discipline and strong balance sheet;
our financing is secure and we remain
committed to providing solid returns to
shareholders.
We have started the new financial year
well and trading has been in line with the
Board’s expectations.

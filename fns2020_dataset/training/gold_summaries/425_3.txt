Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Overview
Our vision and strategic priorities
Afren’s vision is to be the leading independent 
E&P Company in each of the areas in which 
we operate. We also aim to be recognised 
as the partner of choice by all of our 
stakeholders, and have created a balanced 
portfolio of high quality upstream assets 
across the full-cycle E&P value chain. 
In order to achieve our vision, we have 
identified clear strategic priorities focused on 
running our business and delivering efficient 
growth in a responsible way. 
Low cost reserves growth
In July 2011 we announced the acquisition 
of two major assets in the Kurdistan region 
of Iraq – the Barda Rash and Ain Sifni Blocks. 
The acquisition, which is consistent with our 
strategy of acquiring low cost barrels, has 
increased our 2P and 2C recoverable reserves 
and resources base by over 633% at a cost 
of under US$1.0 per barrel and strategically 
means that Afren is now well positioned in 
two of the world’s most prolific oil producing 
countries, Nigeria and Iraq. We were pleased 
to receive all requisite approvals for 
development of the large scale Barda Rash 
field in December 2011, and are now under 
way with the development of what is a truly 
world class asset. Furthermore, we completed 
the OML 26 acquisition through our 45% 
interest in First Hydrocarbon Nigeria (FHN), 
adding a significant reserves and resources 
base onshore Nigeria, fully funded by FHN.
Stable production platform
In 2011, we successfully delivered first oil 
from the landmark Ebok field development 
in just over two years from commencing 
appraisal drilling. We have also concurrently 
maintained production at the Okoro 
development (at levels which have exceeded 
our pre-start up expectations) as well as 
our operations in Côte d’Ivoire. In 2011, we 
achieved an average full production growth 
of 19,154 boepd (14,333 boepd in 2010).
 
We will continue to grow our production by 
developing the existing production and 
appraisal opportunities within our portfolio, 
whilst also pursuing high impact exploration 
targets in East and West Africa as well as the 
Kurdistan region of Iraq.
Record financial results
The Company benefited from increased 
production and a higher realised oil price in 
201 1, achieving record profits of US$125.4 
million on turnover of US$596.7 million. During 
the year we raised US$184.5 million from an 
equity placing in support of our expansion into 
the Kurdistan region of Iraq and took the 
opportunity to access the bond market, allowing 
us to repay shorter-term facilities and at the 
same time reduce any potential over-reliance on 
a relatively limited number of lending banks in 
times of economic uncertainty.
High impact exploration  
campaign under way
We were delighted to be able to announce, 
post period end, that we made a successful 
start to our 2012 exploration drilling 
campaign with the Okoro East exploration 
well. The proximity of Okoro East to the 
producing Okoro main field means we are 
well positioned to monetise this discovery 
quickly and efficiently – both in terms of 
leveraging our detailed understanding of the 
subsurface and development track record in 
the area. We will be looking to replicate this 
success with further wells planned at our core 
Ebok/Okwok/OML 115 hub and will also 
participate in multiple high impact wells in 
key plays across the Kurdistan region of Iraq, 
West Africa Transform Margin and the rift 
and coastal basins of East Africa, each of 
which has the potential to materially increase 
our discovered resource base. 
Key Performance Indicators
We measure the performance of the business 
with five KPIs that are designed to measure 
progress against our strategic objectives. 
In 2011 we realised strong year-on-year 
performance. More information on our KPIs 
and 2011 performance is included on pages 
16 to 17.
The Afren team
As global demand for energy increases and 
competition for upstream oil and gas assets 
intensifies, we are witnessing similar trends in 
a tightening recruitment market with demand 
and competition for skilled and experienced 
people increasing. Industry surveys highlight 
that a growing skills shortage is now the 
greatest concern to employers within the 
industry, ahead of both economic instability 
and geopolitical risks. Afren’s growth and 
success revolves first and foremost around the 
quality and commitment of our people – and 
the values to which we all subscribe, namely 
professionalism, dedication, creativity and 
respect. In order to ensure that we can attract 
and retain the best people, we have in place 
a remuneration policy that is necessarily 
competitive within the industry, and rewards 
exceptional performance with a balance 
between short- and long-term rewards 
and a comprehensive benefits scheme.  10 Afren plc

Chairman’s Statement Continued
Since 2009, Afren has engaged the British 
Safety Council to independently audit our 
health and safety performance in Nigeria and 
Côte d’Ivoire based on rating performance 
in five key areas:
•  Safety organisation
•  Management control systems 
•  Emergency control systems
•  Management of accident/incident reporting 
and investigation
•  Workplace implementation.
We are pleased to report that we have 
achieved three out of five stars again in 2011, 
with 75% compliance with best practice. 
We have established challenging EHSS targets 
across all areas of our operation, against 
which we are well positioned to deliver. 
In 201 1 we continued to develop and 
implement social and economic capacity 
advancement programmes in our areas of 
activity. This year we have communicated 
more about our all encompassing CSR strategy, 
in particular the stakeholder engagement 
activities that provide a foundation for our 
wider CSR programme. More information 
on our CSR initiatives and performance in 201 1 
is included on pages 52 to 57.
‘We remain committed 
to developing local content 
in each of our operating areas 
and employ 178 people in 
Africa, of whom over 97% 
are local nationals.’
We continued to grow our team in 2011 with 
86 new arrivals joining us during the year and 
opened two new regional offices in Nairobi 
and Erbil. Our total workforce grew to 272, 
up 30% year-on-year, of which all are 
full-time employees. We remain committed 
to developing local content in each of our 
operating areas and employ 178 people in 
Africa, of whom over 97% are local nationals. 
We will continue to evolve our employment 
practices and policies to ensure we are able 
to attract and retain the best talent, and are 
wholly committed to developing all our staff 
to their full potential.
Corporate Social Responsibility
At Afren, we aim to be a responsible and 
transparent business. Our CSR policies 
encompass our relationship with all 
stakeholders including shareholders, 
employees, contractors, local communities 
and host governments, as well as with the 
environments in which we work. We have 
successfully worked with the host 
communities in the areas in which we 
operate. A key strategic priority is the effective 
management of CSR policies across all 
operational areas.
During the year we implemented a number 
of key EHSS initiatives. These included 
developing a comprehensive Environmental, 
Health and Safety Management System 
across our portfolio and benchmarking 
ourselves against the Oil and Gas Producers’ 
(OGP) annual average safety performance. 
Both reinforced our continuous improvement 
in EHSS, resulting in significant declines in 
the Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) and 
Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIR) of 79% 
and 91% respectively.  Afren plc 11
Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Overview
Managing risks to our business
The monitoring and management of risks 
to the business are integral to Afren’s 
organisational framework. So that we can 
continue to operate safely and effectively, 
we are constantly identifying and analysing 
potential risks that could adversely affect 
our ability to deliver against our objectives. 
At the same time, crucially, we map out our 
response should things go wrong.
We have a robust, solutions-based reporting 
system in place that enables the direct and 
timely reporting of risks to the Board of 
Directors. This focuses on specifying precisely 
what actions are required to help us 
continually improve risk mitigation and ensure 
we are equipped to deal with a constantly 
evolving operating and business environment.
So that we can identify all risks to the delivery 
of our strategy early and put mitigation measures 
in place, we are continuing to enhance our risk 
management process and to embed it in the 
organisation. We are therefore cascading the 
management of risks at all organisational levels 
to reaffirm that everyone is responsible for 
managing those risks that may impact their 
day-to-day work. More information on our risk 
management and performance in 201 1 is 
included on pages 20 to 25.
Expanding the Board
In February 2012, Patrick Obath was 
appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director. Mr Obath, an East African national 
and senior energy industry practitioner, 
has held a number of senior management 
positions in a career spanning over 36 years, 
including 20 years with Shell International, 
Shell Kenya, Shell Tanzania and Shell Oil 
Products Africa. Mr Obath brings a wealth 
of expertise in corporate health, safety and 
environmental management, combined with 
significant East African experience. These 
attributes will prove invaluable as we move 
into an active operational phase across our 
exploration portfolio in Kenya, Tanzania, 
Madagascar, Ethiopia and Seychelles.
Group Code of Business Conduct
Your Board is fully committed to the principles 
of good corporate governance. These 
principles are detailed in Our Group Code of 
Business Conduct, which has been updated 
in line with the enactment of the Bribery Act 
2010. The Code sets out the behaviour which 
Afren expects of its Directors, managers and 
employees, of our suppliers, contractors, 
agents and partners. We are committed to 
complying with all applicable legal requirements, 
to upholding the highest ethical standards 
and to acting with complete integrity at 
all times. Our employees and everyone that 
we work with create and support our reputation 
and ensure our progress and success. 
This Code demonstrates our commitment 
to ensuring that these high levels of conduct 
are maintained.
The Company has complied with the 
provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code throughout the year and, 
where specific provisions may not appear 
to have been complied with, a full explanation 
is provided in the Corporate Governance 
statement on pages 64 to 72 of this report.
Outlook
2011 has been another year of growth and 
delivery for Afren. We have made good 
progress in all aspects of our business, in 
particular delivering significant year-on-year 
production and reserves growth and posting 
a record set of financial results. 2012 is also 
set to be an exciting year for the Company 
as we continue to pursue further growth 
opportunities and begin to unlock the true 
potential of our portfolio – both through our 
active field development, and exploration and 
appraisal drilling programmes.

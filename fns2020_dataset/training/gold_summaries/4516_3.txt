 The hotel market in the UK has 
strengthened compared to the previous 
ﬁnancial year. This has been particularly 
noticeable in the London market and in 
improved provincial demand from corporate 
single sleepers. Recovery in the conference 
market tends to lag behind these indicators. 
The leisure market remained buoyant 
throughout the period.
Group turnover for the year increased 
by 3.1% to £321.8m (2003: £312.2m) 
and operating proﬁt on a pre-exceptional 
basis was up by 5.4% to £57.6m (2003: 
£54.7m). Return On Capital Employed 
(ROCE) increased by 0.4%pts to 7.2% on 
a pre-exceptional basis. Proﬁt before tax, 
excluding exceptional items, was up by 
14.7% to £45.6m (2003: £39.7m). 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend 
of 8.82 pence per Ordinary share. The ﬁnal 
dividend together with the interim dividend, 
of 4.28 pence per Ordinary share, makes a 
total of 13.10 pence (2003: 11.70 pence) 
an increase of 12%.
People
Signiﬁcant progress has been made 
during the year to enhance development 
programmes for all our employees as it is 
their contribution that drives the success 
of our business. New performance review 
programmes are now in place to assist in 
each staff member’s ongoing development 
and the teamwork structure has also been 
enhanced to support the achievement of 
both personal and Company objectives. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all our staff for their contribution to the 
businesses.
 4 I DE VERE GROUP PLC I CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT:
TURNOVER CAPITAL INVESTMENT 2004
The Board is delighted with the progress that has been made since the 
appointment of Carl Leaver a year ago, particularly on the development and 
implementation of the Group’s new strategy. This has been achieved against a 
backdrop of defending an unwelcome partial offer from GPG earlier this year, 
which was expensive both ﬁnancially and in terms of management time.

Current trading and outlook
During the ﬁrst nine weeks of the new 
ﬁnancial year total Group turnover has 
increased by 1.6% on the same period in 
2003/04.
Like-for-like turnover at De Vere excluding 
De Vere Resort Ownership (DVRO) 
increased by 4.7%. RevPAR on the same 
basis grew 4.0%, with the De Vere 
Cavendish (now like-for-like) achieving 89% 
occupancy and beginning to beneﬁt from 
the implementation of our new approach 
to pricing.
In DVRO, advance sales at The Carrick 
continue to give great cause for optimism 
and now stand at £4.2 million. New 
lodges are also being built at De Vere 
Slaley Hall and De Vere Belton Woods. 
All lodges currently under construction 
will be completed by Spring 2005 so that 
all advance sales will ﬂow into this year’s 
results.
Excluding advance sales at DVRO total 
turnover for De Vere was 0.1% down 
on prior year, also impacted by the 
completion of the sale of the Bellhouse 
on 1 November 2004 and continued 
challenging trading at the Dormy ahead 
of its closure later this month.
Like-for-like sales at Village were ahead by 
7.8% with RevPAR up by 5.5%, driven by 
increased average room rates.
Like-for-like leisure membership was up 
strongly in both Village and Greens by 
7.7% and 9.2% respectively, with Greens 
turning in a very respectable like-for-like 
sales growth of 5.4%.
Total turnover for Village was ahead 8.9%, 
with early trading at Village Maidstone 
more than offsetting the loss of Swindon 
and Prestwich.
Improved trading and management 
action to improve efﬁciency are having a 
beneﬁcial impact on like-for-like margins in 
both hotel brands. We expect to maintain 
progress, notwithstanding signiﬁcant 
increases in energy costs and, potentially, 
property tax following the rating re-
valuation later in the year.
We continue to see improvements in 
corporate demand, although, as yet, 
recovery in the conference market is 
proving elusive. The leisure market remains 
robust. Encouraged by current trading 
and our strategic progress we believe the 
prospects for the year to be good.

Operational Highlights
Our strong operational progress during 
2011 has resulted in a diversified portfolio 
with five core clinical programmes and 
the successful commissioning of our 
proprietary manufacturing facility.
Securing three IND approvals from  
the FDA within 12 months for our novel 
ocular gene therapies partnered with 
Sanofi was an exceptional achievement, 
and we are also pleased to have secured 
new industry collaborations.
With tough economic conditions 
impacting companies and influencing 
sector dynamics, we continue  
to monitor our expenditure and  
remain committed to maximising  
the opportunities ahead.

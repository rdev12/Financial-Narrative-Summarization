It is now over two years since Bradford &
Bingley converted from mutual to plc status
and floated on the London Stock Exchange.
In that period the Group has seen continuing
growth in revenues and profits.
The Group has also made significant progress
in developing its distinctive strategy - namely
to concentrate on profitable segments of
mortgage and property lending, whilst moving
increasingly into a range of fee-earning property
related and personal financial services.
Results
Profits before tax and exceptionals rose 8%
to a record £273 million; profit attributable
to shareholders rose 5% to a record 
£172 million; before exceptional costs,
earnings per share rose 13% from 26.0 pence
to 29.3 pence and return on equity rose from
14.2% to 15.8%.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to propose a final 
dividend of 9.9 pence per share for payment 
on 9 May 2003 to shareholders on the
register as at 28 March 2003.This will result 
in a full year dividend of 14.8 pence,
a 14% increase on 2001.
Trading
The Group’s policy is to lend selectively to
those segments of the residential and
commercial property markets which meet our
careful underwriting criteria and in which we
believe we can make a good return over the
full lending cycle.
Our lending balances have increased, with
rapid growth in our selective lending business,
particularly in the buy-to-let market, more
than offsetting the redemptions in our
traditional book.
We are pleased to report that new lending
rose to a record £5.8 billion in the year
compared to £3.4 billion last year. Our
managed lending balances exceeded
£20 billion for the first time. Arrears and
defaults have continued to decline.
Overall savings balances have stabilised after
the substantial outflow of ‘carpetbagger’
deposits following the flotation.There has
been a continued shift from convenience
savings to lower margin value savings.
In total, outflows post-conversion are
estimated to have reduced Lending & Savings
profits by some £40 million.This resulted
from the anticipated reduction in balances
driven by account closures following flotation.
This was offset positively by some £19 million
by the Group changing the amortisation
period for mortgage incentives bringing it
into line with the industry standard.
We continue to manage our capital actively
and repurchased £88 million of our own
shares during the year. In the course of the
year we completed two substantial capital
market transactions which supported our
lending growth.
The contribution from our Distribution
business, which comprises Mortgage Broking,
Estate Agency, Insurance Broking and
Independent Financial Advice continued to
grow rapidly. Pre-tax profits doubled,
advancing from £14 million to £28 million,
despite the difficult equity markets and further
investment spend.We reached our target of
1,000 advisers in mid 2002, ahead of schedule.
We have delivered on the £30 million cost
reduction target we set ourselves in 2001,
with costs falling by £5 million in 2002,
before exceptionals.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2002
Exceptional costs totalled £33 million, including
£15 million relating to our decision to end our
mortgage systems and processing joint venture
with ALLTEL Information Systems.
Pensions
Because of the rapid decline in world stock
markets during the year, we have reviewed our
pension liabilities in advance of our triennial
valuation, due 30 June 2003.While pension
funding is essentially a long-term consideration
we considered it prudent to transfer an
additional £50 million to our pension fund.
As at the end of 2002, our Minimum Funding
Requirement ratio was estimated to be 125%.
We believe this indicates that we are
adequately funded to meet our existing
liabilities.We will adjust corporate and individual
contributions as needed to meet future
increases in liabilities.
People
Our achievements in 2002, in increasingly
challenging markets, have been the direct result
of the hard work and dedication of staff
throughout the Group.We have placed increasing
emphasis on improving productivity and are now
delivering record revenues with fewer people.
The Board would like to thank all our colleagues
for the positive way in which they have adapted
to continued change in the business.
Board
I would like to take this opportunity to pay 
a particular tribute to Lindsay Mackinlay, who
retired as Chairman of Bradford & Bingley plc
in October 2002.
It is rare for a Chairman to be required to
lead companies through changes as radical as
those Lindsay experienced at Bradford &
Bingley. Lindsay joined the Board in 1990, and
when he became Chairman in 1995 Bradford
& Bingley was still a medium-sized building
society. He leaves us, seven years on, as a
FTSE 100 company, with a clear, distinctive and
successful strategy.The Board will miss his wise
counsel and stewardship, and we all wish him
every success and happiness in his retirement.
I would also like to thank Keith Greenough,
who retired from the Board and from his
position of Managing Director for Lending &
Savings at the end of December 2002. Keith
has made a significant contribution to the
business since joining us in 1997 when we
acquired Mortgage Express and has played a
pivotal role in developing our successful
specialist lending strategy.We wish him well 
in his retirement.
Share price
Bradford & Bingley’s shares continued to
perform resiliently last year in a difficult market
and as a result we joined the FTSE 100 index in
July. By the end of 2002, our second full year of
trading on the London Stock Exchange, our
share price was 19% ahead of our flotation
price and 2% ahead of our end of 2001 price. In
comparison, the UK Banks index fell by 22% and
the FTSE 100 index fell by 25% during 2002.
Outlook
The outlook for the UK financial services
and property markets is uncertain.
Economic and political uncertainty is likely to
lead to continued low interest rates which
can be expected to underpin the property
market and mortgage repayments.We expect
house prices to grow more slowly in 2003
and even to fall in those areas that have seen
exceptional growth in the last 12 to 18
months. It will take some time for consumers
to regain confidence in the stock market but
the need to save for the future remains and is
underscored by uncertainty over pensions.
Our focus remains on achieving further
improvements in our operating performance
while looking for acquisitions that complement
our strategy.
At the same time we will need to digest the
implications of the extensive regulatory changes
that the Financial Services Authority proposes to
make to the mortgage and regulated products
markets.The Board remains confident that our
selective lending strategy and our focus on
financial services and property retailing are right
for the Group and will allow it to carve out a
distinctive position in the markets it serves.

Our priorities Our priorities
Our overall corporate goals are 
profit growth and improved return 
on equity. Four guiding principles help
us to drive towards these goals.
In Lending, we aim to compete in
niches where we can achieve better
than average returns and growth.
In Retail, we aim for high growth 
and innovation to make the most 
of high margins and its lower capital
requirement.
Across the Group we are focused 
on tight cost control, and we are
actively managing our capital base 
to improve returns to shareholders.

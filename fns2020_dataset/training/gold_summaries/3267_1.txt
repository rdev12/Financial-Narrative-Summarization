 Chief Executive’s Review
Results
Turnover in 2003/2004 of £27.3m
was some 1% higher than in the
previous year. The year started 
with activity slightly better than in
the 4th quarter last time.  However,
trading deteriorated to a low point
in the 3rd quarter before some
improvement in demand in the final
period of the year. Better volume in
the foundries was helped by further
consolidation as a result of foundry
closures, in particular the closure 
of Henley Foundry, Halesowen
benefited our order books at both
Walsall and Bloxwich. Also a
feature of the year was the rapid
rise in the price of ferrous scrap 
and metallurgical coke. Monthly
increases in these materials during
the second half and the inevitable
time lag for recovery from
customers had a detrimental effect
on our foundry margins. Overall,
turnover from castings rose from
£18m in the year ended 2003 to
£19m this year.  However, the net
margin fell from 6.1% previously to
4.4% this time. New production
steel also rose significantly in price.
Despite this our light engineering
businesses managed to maintain
their margins, although turnover at
£8.3m was lower than the £9.0m
achieved in 2003.
Within the individual foundries
Walsall was hardest hit by the
material price rises and the difficulty
in recovery, while Bloxwich Foundry
saw a further decline in the demand
for malleable iron tube fittings. We
have introduced considerable new
business both for grey and ductile
iron into Bloxwich Foundry to
change its underlying market
position. Ductile Castings improved
its performance with a significant
increase in sales and better margins
in the year. Although sales fell
slightly at PFP it was pleasing to see
margins recovering, while at Fred
Duncombe a reduction in turnover
led to some decline in the profits
achieved.
Investment
Our major investments in the year
included the purchase of plant and
equipment from the administrators
following the closure of Henley
Foundry. This enhanced our
capacity at Walsall and Bloxwich
and helped to ensure the smooth
transfer of the order book.
On 2 April 2004 we acquired
certain of the assets and the
business of Russell Castings,
Leicester.  Russells is an extremely
well-known foundry with a
turnover of £9.2m in the year
ended March 2004. We are
currently operating the foundry on
its existing site while we evaluate
how to gain maximum benefit from
synergies with our other foundries.
Russells has established a market
position in technical excellence for
austenitic ductile iron (ADI), where
it is a pathfinder in new applications
for this material.
The size range of castings produced
by Russell complements those
within the existing group, providing
us with the opportunity to offer
castings from 0.1Kg up to 6 tonnes
in grey iron, ductile iron, ADI and 
a variety of alloyed iron. There is
considerable opportunity for cross
selling to existing customers.
CHAMBERLIN & HILL Plc  Annual Report 2004 4 5
We acquired 14,000 square feet of
building that we previously rented
contiguous to our existing factory
at Fred Duncombe. We have made
further investments in our range of
high security exit hardware and are
now beginning to see the planned
market opportunities opening up
for these products.
Outlook
Our priority is to improve our
margins at Walsall and Bloxwich
foundries, while increasing volume
in line with market demand.  At
Ductile Castings we are actively
seeking to increase the output of
castings in the weight range 
50 kilos to 300 kilos. We will be
seeking to expand our production
of ADI at Ductile as well as at
Bloxwich and Russells. Overall, we
expect to see growth in volume and
profits in our foundry operations
this year aided by Russells. We
hope to build on the sound
foundations at PFP, to further
improve our margins as well as
extending our range of lighting
products. At Fred Duncombe we
are restructuring and strengthening
our sales activity. We expect further
progress with our security range of
products, and are seeking to lower
cost by finding new sources of
supply throughout our businesses.
For the future we are looking to
build on the foundations we have
put in place this year, improving
volumes and operating margins,
and maximising the opportunities
available to us through Russell
Castings. The year ahead will be
one of consolidation and growth. 
It has been a testing year and 
our excellent team of people have
once again shown their dedication.
I would like to thank them all most
sincerely.

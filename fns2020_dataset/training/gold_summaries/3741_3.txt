the Group and overseeing its growth to this 
point, Stanley Carter decided to step aside 
from his role as Chief Executive. He has moved 
to the role of non-executive Co-Chairman, 
in which capacity I look forward to continuing 
to work with him in the development of the 
business. The Board is grateful to Stanley for 
his immense contribution to the success of 
Cohort to date.
Andy Thomis rejoined the Board of Cohort plc 
and succeeded Stanley as Chief Executive 
in	May	2009.	 Andy ,	along	with	Stanley	and	I,

him for his contribution to the Group and 
wish him well for the future.
In the course of the year Paul Phillips was 
appointed	Managing	Director	of	SEA,	having	
previously	been	responsible	for	its	Defence	
division. Paul has been with the Company 
for many years and has a background in 
technology, project management and business 
development which equips him well to lead

Outlook
Following a good year for order intake with 
total	orders	of	£67.5m,	the	Group	order	book	
at	1	May	2009	stood	at	£47.2m.	 This	provides	
a good platform going into the current year. 
Success in new markets, plus continuing 
strong performance in our primary markets, 
position the Group well for achievement of 
its growth objectives. We continue to look 
for acquisitions to complement the organic 
development of the business.
Overall the Board is positive about the 
outlook for the continued progress of 
the Group.

Business Review
The Company entered its second year of operation after listing and has made good progress in 
investing in the niche market of partially-completed properties in the Chinese Mainland.
During the year, the following major events were accomplished:
• By 30 June 2008, net funds raised in June 2007 of approximately US$535 million were 
fully invested.
• Of the six projects injected into CCP at listing (the “Initial Portfolio”) by Shui On 
Construction and Materials Limited (“SOCAM”) and other joint venture partners, Huapu 
Centre and Shengyuan Centre in Beijing, Xiwang Building in Dalian as well as nearly all of 
the units of Central International Plaza in Qingdao were disposed of within the Company’s 
overall profit target. Approximately 22,000 sqm of Central Point in Chengdu were also sold 
in September 2008.  
• The substantial proceeds generated from these sales put the Company in a net cash position 
at year end.  These cash reserves will allow CCP to weather the current worldwide economic 
downturn comfortably and reinvest for growth should suitable opportunities arise.
• Construction work on four of the six projects in the Initial Portfolio was substantially 
completed.
• Since listing, eight more projects have been acquired with an attributable developable gross 
floor area (“GFA”) of approximately 1,073,000 sqm, representing an increase of 127% on 
the Initial Portfolio of 473,000 sqm.

Property Portfolio and Project Updates
CCP’s diversified portfolio of property projects are located in a number of major and secondary 
cities in China with rapid economic growth. Continued urbanisation is ensuring that both 
foreign and domestic investments are attracted to those cities.  The Company’s unique mode 
of business allows investors to access this niche market of partially-completed properties in 
China’s real estate market.  Having established a strong foundation in distressed assets, two 
new greenfield projects in Shenyang and Chengdu were acquired. These will complement 
the existing distressed asset portfolio and strengthen the income and profit potential in the 
medium term.
BEIJING
Beijing, the capital of China, is the third largest city after Chongqing and Shanghai with a 
population of 17 million.  It is recognised as the political, economic, cultural and educational 
centre of the Chinese Mainland. In 2008, Beijing’s per urban capita income reached RMB24,700, 
representing an increase of 12.4% from the previous year, and more than twice the level seen 
in 2000.   
Huapu Centre
This Grade-A commercial complex is in Beijing’s Dongcheng District, a prime commercial and 
business area, and comprises two 24-storey office towers above a retail podium. It has 128,000 sqm 
of mixed office and retail space. The Company sold its interest in Huapu Centre in February 2008 
to a Korean investor with a gain of approximately US$42 million.
Shengyuan Centre
Shengyuan Centre is in Beijing’s well-established business district and consists of two Grade-A 
office towers of 18 storeys and 9 storeys respectively providing 43,000 sqm of space. The project 
was sold to a Chinese aviation company in May 2008.
Fengqiao Villas
This development is a group of up-market western-styled villas in Beijing’s Shunyi District. The 
fifth ring road is nearby and Beijing International Airport is approximately 11 kilometres away.  
Shunyi is an affluent suburban area with various luxurious villa developments, international 
schools and a large expatriate population. The villa project has a total of 187 villas together 
with a clubhouse of 7,700 sqm.  The Company has already acquired 141 villas and efforts to 
add more villas to this development and the clubhouse will continue.

CHENGDU
Located in the southwest of China, Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan Province and the fifth 
largest city in Mainland China, with a population of over 11 million. It is one of China’s most 
important economic centres and transportation hubs and has been designated a Pilot Reform 
City.  Chengdu’s 2008 total GDP was RMB390 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 
around 12% which is among the highest of any city in China.  Per capita GDP in 2008 was 
over RMB30,000 per annum.
Central Point
Central Point is on the south bank of the scenic Jinjiang river and is adjacent to Chengdu’s 
new central business district.  The existing superstructure remained intact after the earthquake 
in May 2008. Phase I of the project consists of a 35-storey tower with office and serviced 
apartments.  The office portion was sold to a major Chinese bank in September 2008. A soft 
opening of the serviced apartments is planned in the third quarter of 2009 and an international 
company has been engaged to operate the apartments. Construction works have commenced 
on the adjacent Phase II which will be developed into a 31-storey Grade-A office tower. When 
fully developed, 120,000 sqm of GFA will be available by 2010. 
Orient Home
This project is owned by a 50-50 joint venture established in February 2008 between CCP and 
SOCAM.  Located in the Jinniu District, it is near one of the inner city ring roads as well as a 
major station of the future Metro Line interchange. A contemporary composite development 
will be built, comprising 13 residential towers, together with serviced apartments, office area 
and a retail podium. Work will commence this year and upon completion in 2012, the project 
will have a GFA of 454,000 sqm.

17 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
CHONGQING
Chongqing is China’s largest and most populous city with 32 million residents and spans over 
approximately 82,000 square kilometres.  Chongqing was separated from Sichuan province 
and became a municipality directly under the control of the central government in 1997.  
Rapidly urbanising, it is an important economic and commercial centre in the south-western 
region of China and houses many headquarters for the motor, steel and aluminum industries.  
Investing heavily in infrastructure in recent years, the strategic importance of Chongqing has 
been further enhanced by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam and its role as the gateway 
to the Central and Western provinces under China’s “Go West Policy”.  Chongqing’s GDP 
grew by an impressive 14.3% to RMB510 billion in 2008 and its annual GDP per capita has 
reached RMB17,800.
Ruiqi Building
Ruiqi Building is located near Chongqing’s central business district, adjacent to a number 
of luxury hotels and shopping centres.  The project has a 24-storey residential tower above a 
retail podium, with GFA of 86,000 sqm. Construction is underway and the project is set for 
completion in 2009. Marketing for both the residential and office components is expected to 
start later in 2009.
Haomen Building
This project is in the vicinity of the central business district and opposite the JW Marriott Hotel 
and the future Chongqing International Finance Centre. CCP intends to sell the development 
in its existing conditions in 2009. 
Nanyang Building
Nanyang Building is within the Nanan district and enjoys views of the Yangtze River. It 
is also near the Holiday Inn Hotel as well as the Chongqing International Convention and 
Exhibition Centre. The existing commercial building will be demolished and redeveloped 
into two luxurious residential blocks with a GFA of 53,000 sqm.  Planning approval and re-
designation of this zone are underway.
Qianxinian Building
The property is located in the busy Guangyinqiao shopping area with a total GFA of 35,000 sqm.  
The initial development plan was to convert the building into an upmarket 21-storey office 
tower.  However, CCP is now looking at a more attractive exit strategy involving en-bloc 
disposal, with minimum cost of refurbishment.

DALIAN
Dalian is the center of foreign trade in Liaoning Province and an important seaport in the 
northeast of the Mainland.  It has more than 6 million people and numerous Japanese, Korean 
and large western enterprises have set up manufacturing bases in the city. 
Xiwang Building
Xiwang Building, a Grade-A 40-storey office tower providing 89,000 sqm of space, is 
near the city centre of Dalian.  The building was sold to an international investment fund 
in September 2008 and the substantial sales proceeds of RMB1.05 billion (approximately 
US$153 million) were used to further strengthen the cash reserves of the Company. 
GUANGZHOU
Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong Province in southern China, the economic centre of 
the Pearl River Delta. Numerous multinational and domestic manufacturing companies have 
established their headquarters and regional offices in this leading commercial city.  Guangzhou 
has grown rapidly in the past decade and its GDP , one of the largest among all major Chinese 
cities, has surged in recent years and exceeded RMB820 billion in 2008.
Chuangyi Centre
Chuangyi Centre is located in Tianhe district, a prominent and well-established residential and 
commercial area offering easy access to a Metro Line station.  It has three residential towers 
and a block of serviced apartments, providing a GFA of 100,000 sqm.  Works will commence 
in the second half of 2009 and are scheduled for completion in 2011.  
Dapeng International Plaza
This 51-storey office tower has a retail podium adjacent to the Guangzhou Garden Hotel in 
the heart of Guangzhou city with a GFA of 129,000 sqm.  However, the Company decided it 
was prudent to withdraw from the transaction after the vendor failed to fulfill certain major 
conditions connected with the sale.

QINGDAO
Qingdao is in eastern Shandong Province and is a major marine transportation and industrial 
city.  It covers an area of approximately 11,000 square kilometres and has a population of 
7.3 million.  Substantial foreign investments in industries such as chemical processing, heavy 
manufacturing, and the fast growing high-tech sector have strengthened the city’s impressive 
economic growth.
Central International Plaza
Central International Plaza is situated next to Qingdao’s central business district. The project 
consists of a residential and commercial tower, with a total GFA of 63,000 sqm.  Upgrading 
work was completed in 2007. At year end of 2008, the entire office space had been sold and a 
small number of retail and residential units remained.
SHENY ANG
Shenyang is the capital city of Liaoning Province in northeast China with an area of 13,000 
square kilometres and a population of 7.2 million. Shenyang is home to various heavy 
industries including aerospace, automotive and high technology.  The city’s GDP in 2008 
was approximately RMB390 billion, with an annual per capita GDP of RMB50,000.  The 
Central Government’s recent policy of revitalising the three northeast provinces of China is 
expected to benefit Shenyang.  Major Hong Kong-based developers have acquired sizable sites 
for development in this city.
Shenyang Central Plaza, Phase I
Purchased at an auction in 2007, this partially-completed property is located at the north end 
of the “Golden Corridor”, the future business and economic centre of Shenyang. It is also close 
to the city’s cluster of government central administration office buildings. This 298,000 sqm 
high quality contemporary complex comprises four residential towers, two commercial towers 
and a retail podium. Construction is progressing on schedule and pre-sale activities are expected 
to commence in the latter part of 2009. Completion of the project is scheduled in 2011 to 
coincide with the opening of the No. 2 Metro Line. This project is now wholly owned by CCP 
following the acquisition of the 30% interest held by a co-investor in early 2009.
Shenyang Central Plaza, Phase II
This is a joint venture between SOCAM and another CCP shareholder in which the Company 
has a 40% interest.  A detailed development plan is under preparation for this greenfield site 
and construction will commence in the second half of 2009.  Fourteen residential towers, a hotel, 
serviced apartments, two office towers and a retail podium will provide a GFA of approximately 
660,000 sqm. Together with the adjoining Phase I, the combined development will be a major 
landmark and hub in Shenyang’s “Golden Corridor” upon completion in 2013.

23 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Outlook
The Chinese government reacted swiftly to the global financial turmoil and made a concerted 
effort to ensure that the country will continue to grow at a steady pace.  Measures announced by 
year end include a major package of RMB4 trillion (approximately US$585 billion) to stimulate 
domestic consumption and the provision by banks of substantial liquidity.  It is expected that the 
8% GDP growth target set by the Chinese government for 2009 is achievable.  The attainment 
of this target will also assist other major economies around the world in recovering from the 
worldwide recession.  All signs are pointing to the Chinese Mainland being the first of the big 
nations to emerge from the financial crisis when market conditions return to stability.
Judging the right time for acquisitions and disposals has been a key element of CCP’s success to 
date.  The decision in 2008 to dispose of major properties then on hand prior to the deepening 
of the worldwide financial crisis in the last quarter of 2008 has put CCP in an enviable position 
of holding a large amount of cash. At the end of 2008, CCP’s cash exceeded both its bank loans 
and outstanding convertible bonds.
As the turmoil in 2008 is carried over into 2009, market conditions will remain highly volatile.  
Continued pressure on property developers is evident and consolidation has forced weaker players 
to dispose of assets and exit the market. This trend will serve CCP’s business model well.
Your Company will carefully observe clearer market signals in the first half of 2009 before 
undertaking new projects or investments, with much stricter criteria on investment returns.  
A strong deal pipeline will be maintained, with main focus on distressed properties while 
attractive greenfield projects will also be examined.
Meanwhile, major projects in CCP’s existing portfolio have progressed broadly in line with 
original investment plans and are expected to generate a steady stream of income and profits 
in the next three years. 
Leveraging on Shui On Group’s reputation in property development and the expertise of the 
asset manager, CCP will continue to have access to a wealth of experience. The outlook both 
in terms of current projects and the potential for acquiring new projects is positive and the 
management is confident that the Company will continue to be the leader in its unique field 
of operation.

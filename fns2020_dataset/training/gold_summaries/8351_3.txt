In my first statement as Chairman of
Interserve I am pleased to report
that the Group made good progress
in 2005, delivering strong results
and advancing our strategy to
develop as an added-value
infrastructure and facilities
management provider.
We traded well in most markets,
with the bulk of our revenue
reflecting our focus on long-term
customer relationships.
Our results are summarised in the
table below:
Dividend
The directors are recommending a
final dividend of 10.1p (2004: 9.7p),
bringing the total dividend for the
year to 14.7p (2004: 14.1p). 
Subject to shareholder approval 
at the Annual General Meeting, 
the final dividend will be paid on 
9 June 2006 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on
24 March 2006.
Board
Several changes were implemented
during the year as part of a planned
Board succession. This involved my
appointment and that of one other
non-executive director, Les Cullen,
together with the retirements of
John Padovan and Mike Bottjer, both
of whom left with the gratitude of
the Board for their contribution to
the Group. Mike left the Board on 
31 December 2005 after 43 years’
service with the Group, 26 of which
were as a director, having been
Chairman since 1996. On behalf of
the Board and all colleagues in the
Group, I would like to thank Mike
for his leadership over many years
covering a period in which the
Group has made remarkable
progress.
People
Our results are testimony to the 
hard work, skill and enthusiasm of
our people. During my first months
with the Group I have been able to
meet many of our teams and have
been consistently impressed with
their energy, professionalism and
dedication to customer service
across our broad spectrum of
services and operating
environments. On behalf of the
Board, I thank them for their
performance in 2005 and look
forward to their continued
commitment in the future.
Prospects
In light of the earnings progress
made in 2005, together with
favourable trading conditions,
particularly in our Middle Eastern
markets, the Board remains
confident of the Group’s
encouraging prospects for continued
growth. We have excellent forward
visibility, in both workload and
opportunities, are well-positioned in
our markets and have skilled
management in place with a clear
strategic plan and a determination
to succeed.

Highlights of our year
Experian Annual Report 2007  | 13
Investing in people 
As part of the demerger, Experian
employees were granted shares to
enable them to associate even more
closely with our goal of building
shareholder value over the long term.
Investing in technology
Secure and efficient data processing is
vital to our success and last year we
began consolidating our three major US
data centres into two, including the
bunkered, secure state-of the-art centre
in McKinney, 
T exas. 
Product innovation
TrueTouch was one of more than 
20 new products launched during the
year; it classifies the UK’s 46 million
adults according to their likely
response to different methods of
communication. 
Demerger completed
Experian became an independent
company, listed on the 
London Stock Exchange,
successfully raising 
£800m to support 
future growth 
initiatives.
Deepening client
relationships
HSBC and Bank of America were
among many long-established clients
to award major new contracts to
Experian.
Complementary
acquisitions
We made several acquisitions during
the year, including credit bureaux in
Canada and Estonia and marketing
businesses around the world, in order
to complement our existing businesses   
and accelerate
their growth.
Investing in data
Information is at the
heart of what Experian
does and we are
always looking to
acquire new sources. In
April 2007, we agreed
to acquire Hitwise, which
provides data on how people use the
Internet.
Developing 
new sectors
Our CreditExpert service, 
which enables consumers 
to manage their own  
personal credit 
information, provided 
over three million 
credit reports to UK 
subscribers last year 
following its introduction 
from the US in 2003.

Operating result
Group revenue for the 52 weeks to  
30 June 2012 was £603.7m  
(2011: £538.5m), an increase of 12.1%. 
This increase was achieved through growth 
in like-for-like sales of 3.1% and contribution 
from net new space amounting to 9.0%. 
The like-for-like sales performance 
strengthened through the year with H2 
delivering an increase of 5.2% compared 
with growth of 1.1% in H1.
Trading in the final quarter was exceptionally 
strong boosted by the unusually wet 
weather driving strong footfall. As a result 
like-for-like sales in the final quarter grew 
10.4% (2011: +1.9%). We estimate that the 
benefit to total revenues from the weather 
conditions was approximately £8m in the 
quarter.
Gross margin increased by 30 basis points 
to 48.3% (2011: 48.0%) primarily reflecting 
benefits from direct sourcing initiatives.  
We have moved a small number of ranges 
to direct sourcing where significant margin 
benefit exists; at the same time we have 
used our deepened factory relationships  
to ensure that our UK based full service 
vendors continue to provide good value.
Operating costs grew by 12.3% compared 
with last year, with the increase primarily 
due to expansion of and investment in the 
store portfolio and supporting central 
infrastructure. Operating costs in like-for-like 
stores increased by just 2.1%, including 
increased investment in multi-channel 
operations and refits. Non-store costs grew 
in line with the overall growth of the 
business, including increased marketing 
investment and strengthened central teams. 
Operating profit for the financial year was 
£95.2m (2011: £83.3m), an increase of 
£11.9m (14.3%). Adjusting for the benefit of 
unusual weather conditions, we believe that 
underlying operating profit would have been 
approximately £92.7m. 
 
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation were £113.9m (2011: 
£97 .4m). This has been calculated as 
operating profit (£95.2m) plus depreciation 
and amortisation (£18.7m) and represents 
an increase of 16.9% on the previous year. 
The EBITDA margin achieved was 18.9%  
of sales (2011: 18.1%).

Finance Director
Financial items and PBT
The Group generated £1.0m net financial 
income for the year (2011: £0.4m). Financial 
items include interest earned on surplus 
cash deposits of £0.8m (2011: £0.5m) and 
foreign exchange gains arising from the 
translation of dollar denominated assets 
and liabilities at the end of the period, worth 
£0.2m (2011: loss of £0.1m). As at 30 June 
2012 the Group held $1.4m in US dollar 
cash deposits and additional forward 
contracts for $22.3m representing 
approximately 35% of the anticipated US 
dollar spend over the next 12 months. 
After accounting for interest and foreign 
exchange impacts, profit before tax  
for the year amounted to £96.2m  
(2011: £83.6m), an increase of 15.1%.
Tax, PAT and EPS
The tax charge for the year was 26.0%  
of profit before tax compared with 28.5%  
in the prior year. This year on year 
improvement reflects the reduction in the 
headline rate of corporation tax, as well as 
an increase in the level of assets qualifying 
for capital allowances following a review 
completed in the year.
Profit after tax was £71.2m (2011: 59.8m), 
an increase of 19.1%.
Basic earnings per share for the year ended 
30 June 2012 was 35.3p (2011: 29.7p),  
an increase of 18.9%. Fully diluted EPS 
increased by 19.8% to 35.1p (2011: 29.3p).
Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure in the financial 
year was £38.6m compared with £37 .2m 
last year. The most significant investments 
were made in order to support continued 
growth and development of the superstore 
portfolio with the addition of 14 new stores 
(which included 2 relocations and 2 
freeholds) and major refits in 4 further 
stores. Investment was also made to 
support our multi-channel offer and our 
infrastructure was bolstered by the 
completion of our new Head Office in 
Leicestershire, fully operational since 
September 2011.
Working capital
Investment in working capital has increased 
by just £0.3m over the financial year as a 
result of additional stock to support new 
store openings partially offset by an 
increase in deferred rent in the same sites 
and a growth in VAT liabilities as a 
consequence of increased trading.
 
Cash position and dividend
The Group generated £91.9m  
(2011: £74.0m) net cash from operating 
activities in the last financial year, an 
increase of 24.2%. Net cash resources  
at the end of the year were £65.2m  
(2011: £35.1m), with average cleared funds 
across the year of £57 .6m (2011: £35.9m).
An interim dividend of 4.0p was paid in  
April 2012 (2011: 3.5p). It is proposed to  
pay a final dividend of 10.0p per share 
(2011: 8.0p). The total dividend of 14.0p 
represents a 21.7% increase over last year 
reflecting the Group’s strong financial 
performance and leaves dividend cover  
of 2.5x, within our target range of  
2.5x–3.0x earnings. This dividend will be 
paid on 21 December 2012 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 
30 November 2012.
 The Board reviews the Group’s funding 
position on a regular basis and has 
concluded that access to external funding  
is not required in the short term.
The Group maintains uncommitted lines of 
funding with partner banks whilst trading 
with a positive net cash position.
Return of capital
The Group’s policy is to maintain cash 
resources such that it is able to take 
advantage of investment opportunities as 
and when they arise, for example freehold 
property acquisitions. Periodically the Board 
will seek to return to shareholders any cash 
accumulated in excess of likely 
requirements. 
Taking into account the Group’s financial 
strength; its known and anticipated 
investment plans; the level of cash available 
as at the date of this report; and allowing for 
potential further weakness in the UK 
consumer environment the Board is 
proposing that surplus capital amounting to 
£65.8m (32.5p per share) be returned to 
shareholders in November 2012. It is 
proposed that this will be accomplished  
via a B/C share scheme which allows 
shareholders the option of receiving the 
return as capital or income. Full details will 
be announced in due course and provided 
in a circular to shareholders accompanying 
the annual report.
Financial risk and treasury 
management
The Board has established an overall 
treasury policy and approves authority 
levels within which the Group may operate. 
This policy ensures that risk is managed 
within the agreed framework. 
Key performance indicators
In addition to the traditional financial 
measures of sales and profits, the Directors 
review business performance each month 
using a range of other KPIs. These include 
those in the table on page 12.

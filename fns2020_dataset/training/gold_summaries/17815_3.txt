 06 ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Following my appointment as Chairman in January 2016  
and our IPO in February 2016, I am very pleased to present 
my first report.
Group performance
The 2015 financial year was another 
successful one for Ascential, with revenue 
growing 6% on an Organic basis, Adjusted 
EBITDA up 14% to £90.9m, margins 
expanding from 27.3% to 28.5% and free 
cash flow conversion at 88%, up from 
80% in 2014. We are a retention-centric 
company and our priority is to grow 
the number of customers who choose 
to do business with us. The continued 
growth in customer numbers and the 
improved retention rates across the 
board are testament to these priorities. 
Strategic progress
During the year we continued to actively 
manage our portfolio of products. Several 
new products were launched driven by 
customer demand and feedback, including 
Lions Innovation, and other product lines 
were extended to new geographies. 
We made one small acquisition in June 
2015 when we welcomed RetailNet 
Group (“RNG”) to the Group. RNG is 
a US-based provider of retail analytics 
and executive education and is a great 
complement to our Planet Retail business. 
We also sold the Media Business 
Insight business in January 2015. 
We wish the business and its staff 
well under their new ownership.
Our admission to the London Stock 
Exchange on 12 February 2016 was a 
major milestone for the Company. The 
primary net proceeds raised from the IPO 
were used to reduce our net external debt 
to a level more appropriate for a publicly 
listed company. Time dedicated to our 
successful IPO, whilst also maintaining 
a relentless focus on delivering strong 
financial and operational results for 2015, 
is a real testament to the strength and 
depth of Ascential’s management team.

ASCENTIAL PLC — A REPORT OF THE YEAR 2015
Our Board
Our Board is committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance. 
The IPO presented an ideal opportunity 
to formally re-assess the skills and 
talents required for our Board as 
we embark on the next stage of our 
development as a public company.
Firstly, I am delighted that my predecessor 
Tom Hall (Apax), and David Pemsel 
(Guardian Media Group (“GMG”)), have 
each agreed to remain on the Board 
as Non-Executive Directors. We are 
grateful that we will continue to benefit 
from their experience and constructive 
engagement. I would also like to thank 
former Board members Frank Ehmer 
of Apax and Alan Hudson of GMG for 
their contribution over the past years 
of private company ownership.
The Company welcomed three 
independent Non-Executive Directors in 
January 2016 – Paul Harrison (who chairs 
the Audit Committee), Judy Vezmar (who 
chairs the Remuneration Committee) 
and Gillian Kent. I am confident that their 
broad range of both executive and non-
executive experience will prove invaluable 
and am delighted that we have been able 
to attract such talented candidates.
In addition to the Executive Directors, 
Duncan Painter, Chief Executive, 
and Mandy Gradden, Chief Financial 
Officer, we currently have six Non-
Executive Directors. Excluding me, 
three are considered independent 
under the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We expect to make one more 
independent Non-Executive Director 
appointment in May. Assuming our 
expectations are realised, we will then 
be fully compliant with the Code. 
Dividend
Ascential plc was incorporated in January 
2016 and, as indicated at the time of 
the IPO, expects to pay its first dividend 
in respect of the 2016 financial results 
with one-third paid in November 2016 
and two-thirds paid in May 2017.
Outlook
The new financial year has started well. 
Since the year end, Spring Fair, Bett UK 
and Pure Spring have taken place and 
performed in line with our expectations. 
Preparations for Money20/20 Europe in 
April also continue to progress well. While 
still early in 2016, we are encouraged 
by the current level of forward bookings 
and are confident of another good 
year of growth for the Group.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank all the 
employees and customers of Ascential 
for what has been a very successful year.

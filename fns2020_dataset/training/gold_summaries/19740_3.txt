Chairman’s Statement
Nirj Deva, DL, FRSA, MEP
The year under review included some  
major investments in marketing and 
development costs. However, revenues 
remained disappointingly static, resulting in  
the operating loss before exceptional items 
increasing to £0.97 million (2015: £0.27 million).

IDENTIFYING 
GROWTH
OPPORTUNITY
As a result of the above, and following years 
of significant investment into our d
2
w 
oxo-biodegradable plastic masterbatch 
range (the Group’s primary revenue 
generating technology) the Board has 
carried out a strategic review of its 
technologies and their operating position. 
• For d
2
w, a number of successful 
commercial milestones have been 
achieved. As a result, the technology’s 
main sustainability credentials namely, 
Eco-label, Recycling Studies, Bio-
degradation and Eco-toxicity on land and 
in the sea have been enhanced. This is in 
addition to an earlier Life Cycle Analysis 
in support of oxo-biodegradable 
technology. Symphony has, and 
continues to achieve, positive political 
momentum in several overseas markets 
where governments aim to resolve the 
plastic litter crisis without damaging the 
plastic industry. Accordingly, the Board 
has decided that it will substantially 
reduce, but not eliminate, its investment 
into product development and marketing 
as it is unlikely to have a short to medium-
term impact on the Group’s revenue 
generation. The Board believes that the 
opportunities for d
2
w oxo-biodegradable 
plastic will remain at the same high levels, 
despite a reduced level of investment.
• For d
2
p, significant technological 
milestones have been achieved and 
although the Board is confident that 
material sales can result in the near future, 
there is an uncertainty in relation to timing. 
The Group has therefore realigned its 
focus, cost and investment into d
2
p 
“designed to protect” plastic additives and 
masterbatches. The Board has 
successfully developed a number of new 
formulations in the d
2
p range, including 
but not limited to the following: anti-
microbial, flame retardant and 
insecticides. Some of these technologies 
may require certification or regulatory 
clearance before commercial use, and the 
Board is working hard to obtain these with 
our distributors. d
2
p has a number of 
synergies with our established markets 
and customers, and the Group has a high 
number of sales opportunities that could 
result in a material increase in revenue in 
the near term. Due to both technical and 
regulatory reasons, no certainty of 
success can be given, however the Board 
has received positive indications from 
potential customers for the new products. 
The impact of the strategic review on its 
technologies affects Symphony in the 
following ways: 
• The Group has been able to significantly 
reduce its ongoing operating and 
marketing costs, which are expected to 
show a reduction of approximately 
£750,000 in 2016.
• The Board have reduced their fixed 
remuneration. 
• Management are more focused on 
delivering products and technologies 
which will create shorter term value for 
shareholders.
• The cost base is now better aligned with 
the Group’s current levels of revenue, with 
potential upside should sales increase. 
• Given the uncertainty, a number of items 
being carried on the Group’s balance 
sheet have been impaired including 
development costs relating mainly to  
d
2
p of £1.28 million and the deferred  
tax asset of £1.14 million, as well as a 
prudent review of inventory and aged 
receivables provisions.  Symphony Environmental Technologies plc

The Company has, and can foresee, no 
working capital constraints as a result of 
these changes.

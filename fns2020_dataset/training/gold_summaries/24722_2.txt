DIVERSITY
Business management: The Group is a single segment investment management business governed by the Board, with sole discretion for setting the strategic 
direction of the business. Whilst the Group’s Executive Directors and key management are responsible for and have discretion over the day-to-day management 
of the business and support functions, all strategic, ﬁnancial management and key operational decisions are taken centrally by the Board. The Board receives 
reports across product lines, distribution channels and geographic regions, and monitors ﬁnancial performance and determines the allocation of capital centrally. 
People above represents average headcount and excludes NSIM and support functions. Total Group average headcount in 2010 was 938 (2009: 933). AUM above 
excludes NSIM but includes Pearl. Total income above excludes NSIM and ﬁnance income.

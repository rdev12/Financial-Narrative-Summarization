Final results for the year ended 31 December 2016
Ebiquity, a leading independent marketing analytics specialist, 
announces final results for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
Ebiquity provides services to 80 of the top 100 global advertisers, 
with data‑driven insights spanning over 90 countries.
 Michael Karg, PhD, CEO, commented: 
“   We have seen continued strong performance from our consultancy businesses MVM and 
MPO, which are at the core of the changing nature of the media landscape particularly 
around effectiveness and efficiency of marketing investments. We have already made 
good progress with our Growth Acceleration Plan which will replicate our service 
offering across key territories, further strengthening our ability to service global clients. 
    Investments into expanding our digital services across our three practice areas coupled 
with events in the media marketplace – such as the debate around the performance 
of digital advertising – create significant medium‑term growth opportunities. The 
implementation of our plans, the opportunities arising from the changing nature 
of the industry, make us excited for the future.”

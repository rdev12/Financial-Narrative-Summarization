 I am delighted to be making my annual report to
shareholders following a year in which the work carried
out in the previous year, setting the objectives of our
strategic plans for growth and expansion, came to fruition.
Our team has produced a fine performance for the year.
The Group has seen a 21% growth in turnover from
continuing operations which when added to the part
year turnover from acquisitions brought the year on year
increase to 76.8%. Profit before taxation has increased 
by 80.9% and diluted adjusted earnings per share have
increased by 65.7%. These are excellent results in difficult
market conditions and when viewed with our track record
clearly demonstrate that the business model and strategy
that is in place continues to be a successful one. 
Dividends
It is proposed to pay a maiden final dividend in respect
of the current year ending 31 December 2006 of 0.5p per
share which, subject to shareholder approval, will be paid
on 11 May 2007 to all shareholders on the register on 
13 April 2007. We intend to review the dividend policy at
the half year stage.
Acquisitions
Two acquisitions were completed in the first half of the
year and one shortly after on 9 July 2006. Full details of 
the acquisitions were announced to the Stock Exchange 
on the relevant dates and further details are included in
the Chief Executive’s Review.
These three acquisitions approximately double CBG’s
general insurance activities, demonstrating our
commitment to consolidation in the North West. The
current level of gross premiums handled would have
positioned the enlarged business within the top 30 UK
insurance brokers.

In addition to our central hub in Manchester, CBG 
now operates out of Liverpool, Burnley, Poulton-le-Fylde
and Blackpool. 
A number of other potential acquisitions are currently
being considered by the Group.

A number of changes to the structure of the Board were
announced in August. These changes reflected the
recognition by the Board that the Group was rapidly
expanding and that the dynamics, skill sets, expertise 
and experience required of the Executive Directors, 
were focused to ensure that the Group is managed in an
efficient manner as it enters a new stage of development.
Robin Slinger’s appointment as Chief Executive brings 
a wealth of corporate and communications skills with 
his background in corporate banking. Robin was a 
Non-executive Director since October 2004 and is fully
familiar with all aspects of the Group and is well equipped
to lead us through further expansion of the Group. 
Stephen Jackson resigned as a Director on 30 January 2007
for family ill-health reasons. Stephen will continue to be
employed on a part time basis in the Company’s Financial
Services division, CBG Financial Services Limited. The Board
wishes Stephen well and would like to express its thanks
to him for his contribution during the development of 
CBG in recent times.  
Following Robin Slinger’s move from his Non-executive
position and Lord Pendry’s resignation on 7 July 2006, the
Board will appoint a third Non-executive Director when 
a suitable candidate is identified. 
Strategy
The Group’s strategy remains to grow the Group rapidly
through a combination of selective regional acquisitions
and also organic growth from existing operations,
principally through cross-selling across the Group’s trading
divisions. Operating margins will continue to be improved
through the further development of long term
relationships with our suppliers and such a relationship
was recently concluded with an arrangement over three
years with Allianz Cornhill. 
The Group is currently investing in updating its
Information Technology systems. Fundamental to the
Group is the recruitment and retention of quality staff,
trained to use the latest technology into which new
acquisitions can be quickly and effectively integrated. 
The Enterprise Management Incentive share option
scheme is to be opened to all eligible employees, linked 
to the overall performance of the Group.
Prospects
Although the insurance market is set to remain in a
relatively unchanged state for the immediate future,
through 2007 and into 2008, CBG is well equipped to
create value from its existing operations. This has been
demonstrated again throughout the course of last year.
The Directors are confident that the Group will continue
to develop and grow in an effective and controlled 
manner, delivering value to its shareholders.

Chairman’s statement
The results for the year ending  
31 January 2012 demonstrate a resilient 
sales performance against a backdrop of 
protracted economic slowdown and the 
ongoing European debt crisis that made 
trading conditions particularly challenging 
in the second half of the year. The Group 
has however been less severely impacted 
than in earlier economic downturns, 
which is attributed to efforts to broaden 
the business both geographically and in 
terms of product range and particularly 
the acquisition in the prior year of Hartest 
Holdings plc (‘Hartest’). Whilst the 
results fell short of the Group’s original 
expectations, progress in the Americas 
was strong and results are second only 
to last year’s record outturn with sales, 
operating profit before non-recurring or 
special items (‘trading profit’), operating 
cash flow and adjusted earnings per 
share all exceeding any year prior to the 
Hartest acquisition in 2010.
Organisational change
Once again this has been a transformative 
year in which the Group has continued  
to build foundations which will enable  
it to move to the next level.
Elektron Technology (Elektron) has 
grown over a number of years through 
numerous largely UK-based acquisitions. 
The Group has made significant progress 
with its programme of streamlining  
the enlarged organisation as it moves 
from a group of subscale, siloed 
manufacturing businesses to a single 
organisation focused on technology,  
new product development and global 
sales and marketing. 
The Group now employs a matrix 
structure that provides its global sales 
organisation with expert functional 
support. The sales effort is organised 
into three separate regions (Americas, 
Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and 
Africa) that are better able to promote 
the Group’s range of products, creating 
channels for further growth.
The Group has the infrastructure in place 
to support the business as it grows, with 
centralised marketing, technology and 
operational expertise and also strong HR, 
IT and finance functions. The impact of 
this is already being seen in increased 
efficiency and operational visibility. The 
Group also successfully implemented the 
first stages of a move to a new Enterprise 
Resource Planning system during the 
year. This roll-out, along with the adoption 
of a Group-wide Customer Relationship 
Management system, will be completed 
during 2012-13.
The Group has also closed its former 
head office in Romford, announced the 
closure of the legacy manufacturing sites 
at West Molesey and Redhill and moved 
to a new head office and Technology 
Centre in Cambridge. 
In short the Group has now designed 
a streamlined organisation that can be 
scaled up as opportunities arise.
Product development and marketing
The Group’s integrated management 
organisation is already making an impact 
on new product development (NPD). 
Market driven NPD is key to the Group’s 
future success and the right foundations 
are now in place. 
The Group has the infrastructure 
in place to increase efficiency and 
support the business as it grows 08 07 06 05 04 03 09 10 11 12

8 years
Eight consecutive years of dividend growth
The Group’s marketing team is 
addressing the previously fragmented 
nature of Group branding and messaging, 
with the first results of a progressive 
brand overhaul visible on the corporate 
website. Changes to 26 other websites 
will follow. It is expected that this will not 
only create a distinct, unified identity for 
the Group, but will also deliver a basis for 
increased cross selling across its portfolio 
of brands.
People
The Group has hired several experienced 
professionals for key leadership roles 
during the year. For technical and 
marketing roles, the move to Cambridge 
has proved particularly successful, giving 
the Group access to a much larger pool 
of qualified people with experience of 
fast-growing companies. 
The Board has put in place incentive 
plans, which have been designed to 
keep the Group competitive within the 
marketplace and to reward the building 
of value aligned to shareholder interests. 
Elektron values its people and recognises 
the need to look after them, including 
those times when the Group’s plans 
have meant disruption for some. The 
commitment of many Elektron people 
throughout the world in a challenging 
environment has been remarkable and 
deserves recognition.
Dividend
The Board is continuing its progressive 
dividend policy, recommending a final 
dividend of 0.56p (2011: 0.55p) making  
a total dividend for the year of 0.83p 
(2011: 0.80p). This represents an  
increase of 3.8% and is the eighth year 
running that the Board has been able  
to recommend an increased dividend. 
The dividend is expected to be paid  
on 17 August 2012 to shareholders  
on the register at the close of business  
on 4 May 2012.
The Board is proposing a scrip issue 
alternative, subject to a resolution 
being passed at the Annual General 
Meeting allowing the Directors to 
issue shares other than pro rata to 
existing shareholders. Full details will 
be contained in the documentation 
convening the AGM. 
Outlook
Trading in the early months of the year 
has given the Group no reason to change 
its outlook. In the current uncertain 
economic climate Elektron retains its 
cautious stance.
At a more fundamental level however, 
the prospects for Elektron are strong. 
The Group is putting in place measures 
to reduce its exposure to the economic 
cycle and is in a good position to help 
its customers as they become more 
connected whether by creating physical 
power and data links, or by measuring, 
monitoring and controlling key physical 
processes. The Group’s brands already 
provide proven, sector-leading products 
in specific geographies, with considerable 
potential to expand into further territories. 
Elektron will continue to invest in its 
portfolio of market leading products  
as it increases the pace of NPD and 
expands its international network.

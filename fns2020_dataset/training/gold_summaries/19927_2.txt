1 Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation/impairment and special items.
2 Excludes custom smelting revenue and EBITDA at Copper and Zinc-India operations as custom smelting has different 
business economics.
3  Based on profit for the period after adding back special items and other gains and losses, and their resultant tax and 
non-controlling interest effects. In the prior period, the underlying attributable profit included the net tax benefit from  
the Sesa Sterlite merger offset by a deferred tax charge due to the change in tax rates at Cairn India.
Group highlights
Improving production 
volumes at Copper India
Higher production volumes 
at Copper India, while 
maintenance work at 
Konkola reduced production 
in Zambia. An easing of 
documentation requirements 
for VAT refunds in Zambia 
will enable us to increase 
utilisation rates of the smelter. 
 see page 64
Resuming operations at 
Sesa Goa
Production recommenced 
at Karnataka and in Goa, 
environment restrictions were 
lifted, with Vedanta allocated 
an interim annual mining 
quantity of 5.5mt of saleable 
ore. We are implementing 
cost reductions to counter 
the low-price environment.
 see page 60
Ramping up aluminium
Production reached record 
levels at Lanjigarh and we 
have initiated a number of 
innovative, cost-saving projects. 
The new Korba-II smelter and 
Jharsuguda-II smelter started 
production with significant 
ramp up planned in 2016.
 see page 68
Resilient performance  
in falling crude  
oil environment
We have revised capex 
but continue to focus on 
opportunities, with Cairn 
delivering the largest 
exploration and appraisal 
programme in its history. 
We spent US$1.1 billion in 
FY2015 out of US$3 billion, 
retaining flexibility on 
spend going forward.

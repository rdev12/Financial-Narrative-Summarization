Our strategic priorities
SABMiller has four clear strategic priorities:
Creating a balanced and attractive 
global spread of businesses
The wide geographic spread of our operations allows us to benefit from growth in volumes 
and value in beer markets around the world. We continue to look for opportunities to strengthen 
our geographic footprint in both developed and developing markets through greenfield entries,
alliances, mergers and acquisitions.
For more information see page 14
Developing strong, relevant brand portfolios 
that win in the local market
We seek to develop attractive brand portfolios that meet consumers’ needs in each of our markets.
This includes expanding our offerings, to address new consumer segments and drinking occasions,
strengthening our mainstream brands, building a differentiated portfolio of international and local
premium brands and channelling the right brands to the right outlets at the right time and price.
For more information see page 16
Constantly raising the profitability 
of local businesses, sustainably
Our aim is to keep enhancing our operational performance through top-line growth and continuous
improvement in costs and productivity. It’s also important that we maintain and advance our
reputation, protect our licence to trade and develop our businesses sustainably for the benefit 
of our stakeholders.
For more information see page 18
Leveraging our skills 
and global scale
Our global spread presents increasing opportunities to gain value from the scale and skills of 
the group, not least by standardising our back-office functions around the world and regionally
integrating our front-office systems. We are also benefiting from ongoing collaboration and the
sharing of skills between our businesses.

availability of local brand portfolios. At the same
time, our international premium brands – Pilsner

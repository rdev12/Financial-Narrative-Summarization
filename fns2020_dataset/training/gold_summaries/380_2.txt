A two speed advertising
world…
BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and
China) economies are key to
global growth, but the US is
still important, due to its share
of global advertising spend.
>
Our aim is to ensure we continue to leverage our high quality
global asset base, in the context of the changing dynamics in
the markets in which we operate. This aim will be realised by
focusing on achieving the strategic priorities of our two core
divisions, Aegis Media and Synovate.
Aegis Media’s strategic priorities are focused on:
> Increasing exposure to faster-growing regions
> Ensuring full service of digital and media propositions
across brands
> Developing international clients and targeting
profitable new business
> Increasing digital profile and capability
> Building on leading positions in top 20 markets,
especially the US
> Broadening service offering across existing and new
clients
Synovate’s strategic priorities are to: 
> Increase traction and build momentum with 
key global clients
> Provide competitive differentiation through 
operational excellence
> Prioritise investment in key gateway markets 
for international research
> Expand existing capabilities in key industrial 
verticals and research methodologies across 
all of our geographies 03 / Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
BRIC economies are expected to
contribute nearly 50% of global
advertising growth to 2015…
with China alone already 
the world's second largest
advertising market.

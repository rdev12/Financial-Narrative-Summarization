 Serabi Mining plc Annual report and accounts 2005 4
Chief Executive’s Statement 
Let me begin by congratulating all our employees on
successfully expanding production at the Palito Gold
Mine during 2005. We believe that the Palito Gold
Mine forms the template for developing additional
projects for Serabi in Brazil, a country with vast gold
mining potential.
PALITO GOLD MINE
Overview
The Palito Gold Mine performed well during 2005,
achieving total production of 17,261 ounces of gold
equivalent. A total of 59,387 tonnes of ore from the
Palito Main Zone was mined during 2005, of which
54,993 tonnes was development and shrinkage stope
ore from underground and 4,394 tonnes from surface
material. The ore head grade during the year averaged
9.2 g/t and gold recovery averaged 89.4%. An analysis
of the operating performance of the mine on a
quarterly basis illustrates the dramatic improvements
made at the operation throughout the year.
Mining
During the second quarter of 2005, Serabi reported
to shareholders that the rate of mining was becoming
a bottleneck in terms of our ability to increase
production. Indeed, the impact of this was evident
in the quarterly decrease in tonnes mined during the
third quarter as compared to the second quarter.
Following a detailed assessment of potential solutions,
it was decided to introduce mechanised longhole
stoping as a new mining technique and to initiate
decline access to the lower sections of the Palito
Main Zone.

“Longhole stoping will enable us to increase production
levels from the mine, reduce our operating costs on a per
tonne basis and improve safety and working conditions for
our employees.”
The decline will allow Serabi to move away from the
generally labour intensive mining method of shrinkage
stoping in favour of the more productive longhole
stoping mining method. The decline was well
advanced by year end and equipment required to
undertake longhole stoping is expected to arrive at
Palito during the first quarter of 2006. We expect to
begin to see the benefits of the new mining method
in the second quarter of 2006. Specifically, longhole
stoping will enable us to increase production levels
from the mine, reduce operating costs on a per tonne
basis and improve safety and working conditions for
our employees. 
Notwithstanding, other shorter-term initiatives were
undertaken leading to a noticeable increase in mining
output in the fourth quarter. This reflected much
improved rates of development, inevitably affecting
grades in the short-term but laying the foundations
for improved production scheduling and grades 
during 2006. 
Plant
The process plant performed exceptionally well during
the year, with gold recovery rates showing a steady
quarterly improvement, ending the year averaging
91.8% in the fourth quarter. Plant capacity also
increased throughout the year according to a three
phase improvement plan.
The first Debottlenecking Phase was completed
relatively quickly and at minimal cost. This optimisation
of the Palito plant resulted in improved throughput to
just above 150 tonnes per day during the second and
third quarters, accompanied by increased gold
recovery rates.
The second Upgrade Phase was initiated later in the
year and the benefits of this phase became evident
during the fourth quarter. The upgrade involved the
addition of a few key items, most notably a third
ball mill which will reduce downtime and provide a
sustainable capacity of between 300 to 350 tonnes
per day.
We await the outcome of a new long-term mine plan
before beginning a third and final Expansion Phase 
of the plant. If results support further expansion, 
we would expect daily Palito capacity could be
increased further through modular expansion of 
the existing plant with potential to establish a regional
processing centre for satellite projects in the Jardim 
do Ouro District.
Palito Main Zone Resource Estimate
Serabi employs its own drill crews and completed a
total of 18,235 metres of core drilling from surface
during 2005, considerably greater than the Company’s
target of 12,000 metres. Most of this drilling was

undertaken on and around the Palito Main Zone in
order to assist with mine planning and expand the
quality and quantity of the resource base. It is
noteworthy that the drilling programme also led to
the discovery of the Compressor Lode, located within
25 metres of the Palito Main Zone. The Compressor
Lode has turned out to be a series of at least four,
high-grade veins that have been incorporated into 
the mine plan for 2006. 
Based on this drilling and extensive underground
sampling, a new JORC resource estimate for the 
Palito Main Zone was carried out at year end by
independent consultants Hellman and Schofield Pty. 
As a result of the review, total resources increased
by 74% to 825,900 gold equivalent ounces compared
with the previous December 2004 estimate.
The quality of the resource also improved, with 
a substantial move from the Inferred Resource 
category to the Indicated Resource category; Indicated
Resources now comprise 90% of the total resource
ounces at the Palito Main Zone. 
In addition, the strike length of the resource on
the Palito Main Zone increased from 900 metres to
1,050 metres and the current maximum depth of
the resource increased by 100 metres to the 0 mRL
elevation, or 200 metres below the bottom of the
existing main shaft. These results provide confidence
that the Palito Gold Mine has the potential to grow
into a long-life, low-cost gold producer for Serabi.
The resource remains open in all directions.
An important economic measure for an underground
gold mine is the number of ounces per vertical metre.
It is therefore noteworthy that the new resource
estimate has added approximately 50% more gold
equivalent ounces per vertical metre on the Palito

Main Zone, to an average of 5,500 gold equivalent
ounces. The potential economic impact of such an
increase is significant, as more gold can be accessible
from each level of mine development. 
Our objective for 2006 is to continue to expand the
resource at the Palito Main Zone along strike and at
depth. We also expect to increase further the quality
of this resource as an increased rate of underground
drilling will enhance our understanding of the ore body. 
2006 outlook for Palito Gold Mine
With the shift to mechanised mining techniques
at Palito, Serabi is forecasting an increase in gold
equivalent production for 2006 to 45,000 ounces. Total
cash costs are targeted to reach approximately US$200
per ounce by the year end. Based on the new resource,
the geological potential and further drilling of the
Palito Main Zone, we also intend to complete a revised
long-term mine plan during the year, in order to assess
the full potential of the mine and conclude upon the
optimal production rate for the operation.
JARDIM DO OURO DISTRICT EXPLORATION
Overview
The Jardim do Ouro District concessions include eight
identified targets that lie within five kilometres of the
Palito Gold Mine. Serabi’s objective for the Jardim do
Ouro projects is to establish resource ounces and to
assess the potential to develop these resources into
satellite orebodies that could be processed at the
nearby Palito plant.
Initial work during 2005 focused on the Palito West
and Bill’s Pipe targets in the Jardim do Ouro District.
Palito West 
Located approximately 250 metres to the southwest 
of the Palito Main Zone, Palito West is interpreted as a
system of high-grade vein structures. A small exploration
adit was driven into the Palito West structure and
extensive channel samples were taken which yielded
encouraging results. Late in 2005, a preliminary drill
programme of four shallow diamond drill holes was
completed at Palito West, with results of 0.8 metres
grading 20.3 g/t gold and 0.6 metres at 79.5 g/t gold.
Mineralisation at Palito West remains open to the south
and at depth. We plan to test further the extent of
mineralisation at this prospect during 2006.
Bill’s Pipe 
The Bill’s Pipe target lies approximately 1,000 metres 
to the north of the Palito Gold Mine and is the location
of a large gold-in-soil geochemical anomaly. A series 
of trenches were completed at Bill’s Pipe during the
year, yielding promising results of 2.0 metres grading
17.6 g/t gold, 1.5 metres at 10.8 g/t gold and 1.0 metre
at 2.5 g/t gold. The trenching programme was

followed up with a diamond drilling programme
which intersected high-grade mineralisation contained
within structures similar to those found on the Palito
Main Zone and coincident with the gold-in-soil
geochemical anomaly. Drill results included 0.5 metres
at 27.0 g/t gold and 1.0 metre at 20.7 g/t gold.
Further drilling on the Bill’s Pipe prospect is planned
for 2006.
Work programme for 2006
Serabi’s objective for 2006 is to establish a resource 
on at least one of the Jardim do Ouro District projects.
Keeping this goal in mind, drilling will continue to
follow up the encouraging results from Palito West
and Bill’s Pipe, in addition to other areas. 
TAPAJOS REGIONAL EXPLORATION
Serabi has built an extensive exploration portfolio
throughout the Tapajos Region of Brazil. Our
concessions total approximately 100,000 hectares 
and we are only just beginning to evaluate these
prospective targets. Due to late delivery of new surface
drill rigs, work in 2005 was limited to soil geochemistry
analysis, geophysics and geology on a small number 
of projects. However, the groundwork laid in 2005
provides the foundation for Serabi to advance these
projects during 2006 and initiate drilling.
Pombo Gold Project
In October 2005, Serabi announced that it had
purchased an option to acquire 100% of the Pombo
Gold Project. Copper-gold mineralisation is found
within a major northeast-southwest trending fracture
zone structure. This structure has been mapped in
detail along a strike length of 3.9 kilometres and
mineralisation has so far been identified along
700 metres of strike length.
Channel sampling from old garimpeiro workings
returned six metres at 12 g/t, two metres at 37 g/t,
two metres at 22 g/t, two metres at 15 g/t and three
metres at 15 g/t. Geophysical analysis suggests that the
mineralisation at Pombo may actually expand at depth. 
The similarities between Serabi’s Palito Gold Mine and
the Pombo Gold Project are striking. Both have similar
types of mineralisation, namely gold associated with
pyrite and chalcopyrite. 
Work programme for 2006
A high priority for Serabi during the first half of 2006 
is to drill on the Pombo and Sucuba projects in the
Tapajos. The Company’s goal is to develop an initial
resource on at least one Tapajos regional project and, 
if warranted, to begin work on a scoping study to
assess the possibility of bringing at least one of these
projects into production.
CONCLUSIONS
These are exciting times for Serabi. 2005 was an
important transitional year as we moved from a
private to public company and increased output at the
Palito Gold Mine towards full commercial production.
2006 is expected to be a year of continued growth for
the Company as we expand production further at the
Palito Gold Mine and advance our exploration projects
in the Jardim do Ouro District and the Tapajos Region.

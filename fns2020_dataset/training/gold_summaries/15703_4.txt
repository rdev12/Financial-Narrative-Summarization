THUS is focused on the provision of  
fixed line telecommunication services 
to large business customers and public 
sector organisations, while tailoring 
services to suit small and mid-sized 
businesses under the Demon brand.
Business model
THUS’ business model is focused on the  
provision of primarily infrastructure-based  
services to business customers and public  
sector organisations in the UK. 
Our addressable market is not focused on  
the highly competitive consumer market in the  
UK nor very large multinational corporations. 
Demon’s service offerings are targeted at small 
and mid-sized businesses and complement 
THUS’ capabilities for larger organisations. 
Continuing operations
THUS has four established business segments 
comprising Managed solutions, Data and 
telecoms, Internet and Mobile.
Managed solutions are run as a separate unit 
within THUS. They comprise large corporate 
accounts with complex service needs, typically 
combining delivery of several different standard 
services, an element of outsource to THUS  
and longer than average contract duration. 
In contrast, the Data and telecoms, Internet and 
Mobile segments record revenue and results 
for more standard product sales to a wider 
customer base including corporate, small and 
mid-sized customers, channel resellers and other 
telecommunication companies.
Within each segment, the principal costs 
comprise payments to other telecommunication
companies for interconnect and use of their 
network to collect and deliver services to THUS 
customers, other directly variable costs, directly 
attributable selling, distribution and administrative 
costs and depreciation on assets directly 
attributable to that segment.
However, as the majority of services are sold, 
provisioned and run from a unified infrastructure, 
THUS maintains a large pool of central costs.  
In 2008, these costs reduced by 7% to £108.7m
1
 
(2007: £1 17 .2m

) and comprised £41.2m  
of depreciation, impairment and amortisation 
(2007: £43.4m), £29.4m of network operations 
and maintenance costs (2007: £27 .3m) and 
£38.1m of corporate overheads (2007: £46.5m).

to individual segments.

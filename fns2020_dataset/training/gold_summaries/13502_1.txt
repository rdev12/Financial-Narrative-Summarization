 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Overall conditions 
for the period were 
mixed with some of 
the Group’s markets 
showing clear signs of 
recovery, whilst others 
remained challenging. 
The last five years have been extremely 
tough for the recruitment industry but as 
demonstrated by this set of results, the 
Group continues to increase market share 
and has emerged from this period stronger 
than ever. 
The Group benefits from a diverse 
geographical, discipline and sector 
business model and a well-respected 
international brand. We have built a 
well-balanced blend of permanent and 
contract recruitment income streams  
and have successfully expanded our 
sector coverage beyond our traditional 
strength in financial services. In Resource 
Solutions, we have also created a market-
leading and growing recruitment process 
outsourcing business. 
We continue to be at the forefront of 
technology. Through our digital assets 
including our multiple market-leading 
mobile apps and our new multi-lingual 
mobile website we continue to innovate  
to deliver value to our clients and 
candidates. In addition, internally we  
have successfully completed the global  
roll out of a streamlined front office 
recruitment database. 
Review of Operations
Asia Pacific (46% of net fee income)
Revenue was £260.1m (2012: £280.6m) 
and net fee income decreased 1% 
(4% increase*) to £92.1m (£97.4m*) 
(2012: £93.4m) delivering an operating 
profit increase of 1% (11%*) to £7.2m 
(£8.0m*) (2012: £7.2m).
Our market-leading business in Japan 
delivered a record performance with the 
internationalisation of business driving 
strong demand for bilingual professionals. 
Our operation in Malaysia goes from 
strength to strength and is a market leader 
in what is a rapidly developing recruitment 
market, where we have a clear first mover 
advantage. Market conditions in 
Singapore, Hong Kong and China remain 
positive. It’s also pleasing to report strong 
net fee income growth in our newer and 
smaller businesses in Taiwan, Thailand, 
South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam.
Market conditions in Australia, the region’s 
largest market, remain challenging with 
the resources sector affecting confidence 
levels across the wider economy. Our 
Brisbane and Perth offices were hardest 
hit; however, our offices in New South 
Wales, Victoria and South Australia were 
impacted to a lesser degree. We have 
already taken steps to realign the business 
accordingly reducing headcount by 18%.
Our investment in setting up Resource 
Solutions in Asia continues to deliver net 
fee income growth, with a number of new 
client wins during the period.

 Net fee income UK (29% of net fee income)
Revenue was £235.7m (2012: £193.2m) 
and net fee income increased by 15% to 
£57.2m (2012: £49.7m) producing a six-fold 
increase in operating profit to £2.5m  
(2012: £0.4m).
In London, financial services hiring 
activity remained generally muted; however, 
we continue to successfully diversify and 
develop our offering in areas such as legal, 
IT and most recently supply chain and 
procurement. Our regional recruitment 
businesses – Manchester, Birmingham, 
Milton Keynes and Guildford – produced 
a particularly strong performance across 
all recruitment disciplines. 
Resource Solutions in the UK had an 
excellent year both winning new clients 
and retaining existing business across 
both commerce and financial services. 
Europe (21% of net fee income)
Revenue was £93.9m (2012: £87.8m) 
and net fee income increased 6% (2%*) 
to £42.0m (£40.2m*) (2012: £39.6m) 
producing an increase in operating 
profit to £1.3m (£1.2m*) (2012: £1.2m).
France, the region’s largest business, 
produced a robust performance, growing 
market share in a country where market 
conditions have arguably been toughest. 
Net fee income growth rates were 
strongest across the Group’s Benelux 
operations, with Walters People, our junior 
clerical recruitment business, in particular 
the stand-out performer. In Germany, we 
continue to grow net fee income strongly 
and we are seeing encouraging signs 
from our business in Spain.
Other International (4% of net fee income)
Revenue was £8.0m (2012: £6.1m) and 
net fee income increased by 38% (44%*) to 
£7.9m (£8.3m*) (2012: £5.7m) producing an 
operating loss of £0.2m (operating loss of 
£0.3m*) (2012: operating loss of £0.4m).
Other International comprises South Africa, 
the US, Brazil and the Middle East. Our 
business in South Africa had an excellent 
year growing net fee income strongly. 
Improving confidence in the US has helped 
boost activity levels in our New York office 
and the technology boom in San Francisco 
shows no signs of abating. In Brazil, 
market conditions remain difficult but our 
São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro operations 
have delivered solid net fee income growth. 
The Group opened a new office in Dubai, 
our first in the Middle East region. 
Current trading outlook
Trading for the first two months of 2014 
has been encouraging. Whilst we are seeing 
definite signs of recovery in some of our 
markets, others including major markets 
such as Australia and France remain 
challenging. The Group is well positioned 
to continue to deliver enhanced profitability 
in line with current market expectations.

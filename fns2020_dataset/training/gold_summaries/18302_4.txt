Lighting 
The Lighting segment, which is comprised 
of Dialight’s Lighting and Obstruction 
businesses, is focused on providing energy 
efficient lighting solutions through the use 
of high-brightness LEDs and connected 
technologies. It represented 75% of the 
Group’s revenue in 2015 and 71% of the 
Group’s segmental operating profit.
The Lighting business provides lighting 
products to customers operating in 
industrial sectors, which include steel 
foundries, pulp and paper mills, automotive 
manufacturers, utility and waste water plants 
and food and beverage processing plants. 
The business also provides specialist 
lighting products for hazardous industrial 
sites, including those in the oil and gas and 
mining sectors.
A high proportion of Lighting sales, 
particularly in the US, are through major 
distribution networks. The business 
also sells directly to major international 
customers and has strategic links with 
key automation partners.
The Obstruction business provides  
LED lighting used for aircraft collision 
avoidance in the onshore telecom and 
broadcast tower market and offshore wind 
turbine markets. Revenue is project based 
and the timing of orders in this business 
can be uneven and difficult to predict.
Overall 71% of the Lighting division’s 
revenue was generated in North America 
in 2015, with 19% in Europe and the 
Middle East, and 10% in Asia and Australia.
Signals and Components
The Signals and Components division 
consists of Dialight’s Traffic, Transportation 
and Components businesses. In Traffic 
and Transportation, Dialight provides LED 
lighting for signals, while the Components 
businesses include sales primarily to 
electronics original equipment manufacturers 
("OEMs") for status indication and components 
for automotive and niche industrial application.
In 2015, the division represented 25%  
of the Group’s revenue in 2015 and 29%  
of the Group’s segmental operating profit. 
These businesses all operate in high 
volume and competitive markets where 
products are less differentiated. As a result, 
revenues across these businesses are 
declining and the Group manages these 
businesses for value.

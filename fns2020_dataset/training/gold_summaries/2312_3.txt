CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Booker Group 
plc has delivered 
another good 
performance
I am pleased to report that Booker 
Group plc has delivered another good 
performance. In the 52 weeks to 29 
March 2013 sales rose by 3.5% to 
£4.0bn and operating profit of £99.1m 
was up 12% as customer satisfaction 
continued to improve. The financial 
performance was good and the Group 
ended the financial year with net cash 
of £77.2m. The drive into the catering 
market is working, with sales to caterers 
up by 6.2%. Sales to retailers also rose 
by 2.0%. 
The plans to ‘Broaden’ the business 
are going well. In the 52 weeks to 29 
March 2013 Booker distributed £1.15bn 
of product to our customers’ premises 
versus £1.05bn last year as we continue 
to expand our delivered service. We 
launched Chef Direct last year and 
are pleased to have been awarded 
a number of prestigious accounts. 
Internet sales were £704m compared to 
£635m in the previous year and Booker 
India is making good progress. 
During the year we also acquired Makro. 
As the Competition Commission’s 
clearance of the transaction was 
received on 19 April 2013, Makro has not 
been consolidated into these accounts. 
We are delighted to have the team from 
Makro join Booker Group and we are 
also pleased to have Metro AG as a 
strategic partner and major shareholder.
I should like to thank all our colleagues 
for their contribution to the success of 
the Group in the year just ended.
Basic earnings per share were 4.93 
pence, up from 4.77 pence (52 weeks) 
last year, after a 9.99% equity dilution 
arising from the share element of the 
Makro consideration. Given the strong 
operational performance and cash flow 
of the business the Board recommends 
the payment of a final dividend of 2.25 
pence per share (2012: 1.95 pence per 
share) which, together with the interim 
dividend, makes a total dividend for the 
year of 2.63 pence per share (2012: 2.28 
pence per share). The final dividend is 
payable on 12 July 2013 to shareholders 
on the register on 14 June 2013.
Outlook
The economy is expected to remain 
difficult in the year ahead and the 
food wholesale market remains very 
competitive. Nevertheless, we expect 
to continue to make progress in this 
challenging environment. The Group’s 
trading in the first seven weeks of the 
current financial year is ahead of last 
year and we remain on course to meet 
our expectations for the year.
Annual General Meeting
Our Annual General Meeting will be 
held on 10 July 2013. The notice of 
Annual General Meeting separately 
accompanies this document.

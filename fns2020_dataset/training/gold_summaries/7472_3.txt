Chairman’ s Statement
After a year of considerable 
change, Holidaybreak is now 
clearly positioned as a growing 
European specialist holiday group. 
In the year to 30 September 2005, 
we sold 3.0m holidays (2004: 
2.3m), increased headline profits* 
and generated £38.1m of free 
cash flow**. We also made two 
successful acquisitions in the 
Netherlands. 
I am delighted to report that this represents  
the Group’s best ever performance, in terms of 
headline profit before tax* and free cash flow**. 
Once again our employees have displayed 
commitment, enthusiasm and skill in all parts  
of the business. I thank them for all they have 
done in 2005.
We have the strength of management, 
commitment and financial resources to be  
even more successful in the years to come.  
The executive management is concentrating on 
margin performance, good return on investment 
and the generation of cash. The Board remains 
focused on the allocation of capital, the 
management of risk and the performance of  
the executive management in the interests  
of the Company and its shareholders. 
Group Results
For the year ended 30 September 2005, pre-tax 
profits (before goodwill amortisation and 
impairment) were £32.0m (2004: £28.0m) on 
turnover of £303.0m (2004: £28.6m). Headline 
earnings per share* were 48.8p (2004: 44.0p). 
Operating profit* was £35.8m (2004: £3.4m). 
On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact  
of acquisitions, existing activities made an 
operating profit* of £3.6m. The new 
acquisitions, Bookit and Djoser, both 
announced in December 2004, contributed 
combined operating profits* of £4.2m. 
All Holidaybreak’s operations generated 
substantial cash. Operating cash inflow  
was £52.0m, (2004: £46.3m). Net debt at  
30 September 2005 was £22.9m  
(2004: £2.5m). The acquisitions of Bookit  
and Djoser, for a combined consideration  
of £39.6m, were financed from cash flow and 
new borrowings. Capital expenditure, net of 
disposals, was £2.4m (2004: £3.5m).
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 
9.35p (2004: 7.6p), payable on 25 April 2006, 
to shareholders on the register on 3 March 
2006, making a total of 26.6p (2004: 24.2p)  
for the year.
The 0% increase in the annual dividend  
reflects the Board’s confidence in future 
prospects. The Group is financially strong and 
has a clear strategy to grow, both organically 
and by acquisition, adapting to and exploiting 
the rapidly changing market place. The Board 
intends to continue to pay ordinary dividends 
that are appropriate in light of the growth 
prospects and the underlying performance  
of the Group.
Acquisitions
Holidaybreak increased its presence in the 
growing leisure break and ‘soft adventure’ 
sectors and also in European travel markets 
with the acquisition in December 2004, of 
Bookit, an online intermediary for short-stay 
holidays in the Netherlands, and the acquisition 
in January 2005 of Djoser, the leading Dutch 
adventure holiday operator. The combined 
consideration for the two acquisitions  
was £39.6m.

Proﬁt before tax*
Djoser and Bookit enjoy high levels of consumer 
recognition in the Netherlands and are market 
leaders in their sectors. Both companies have 
experienced and committed management 
teams who are staying with the businesses. 
Integration of the newly acquired businesses 
has gone smoothly. They are both performing 
well and ahead of management expectations. 
Both were earnings enhancing* in the year. 
Management and Board Changes 
Carl Michel joined Holidaybreak as its new  
Chief Executive on 5 September. He succeeded 
Richard Atkinson, who retired after 30 years 
with the Group. Carl, 42, has extensive 
management experience in the international 
travel sector and has worked for a range of 
companies, including McKinsey, British Airways, 
Deutsche BA (where he was CEO) and Opodo.  
I am delighted that Carl joined Holidaybreak.  
He is a well-known senior executive in the travel 
industry, with outstanding strategic skills and 
strong European credentials. I believe that he 
has the capabilities to take Holidaybreak 
through its next phase of development.
At the same time, the departure of Richard 
Atkinson after 30 years with the business was  
a significant moment for us. Richard began in 
the business in 975, which was then providing 
holidays for less than 700 families. Holidaybreak 
now sells three million holidays annually. We 
have three profitable, cash generative divisions, 
attractive margin performance and good trading 
results. Richard can be justifiably proud of all 
this and he retired with our immense gratitude 
and good wishes.
James Greenbury, 44, joined the Group  
as a Non-executive Director with effect from  
 January 2005. With his strategic skills and  
his experience of the service sector, he has 
proved a valuable addition to the team as 
Holidaybreak seeks to grow by investment  
in its current businesses and by acquisition.
Clive McLintock retired as a Non-executive 
Director on 3 December 2004. Clive made a 
strong and valuable contribution during his time 
on the Board and I thank him for all he did for 
the Company.
Outlook 
Current trading is in line with our expectations. 
We are pleased with performance in the UK  
and the Netherlands although the London short-
breaks market remains subdued. The Group  
is confident of achieving another satisfactory 
performance. The Board believes that the 
financial and trading prospects of the Group  
for the current year are good. Once again, the 
Group expects to deliver industry-leading 
margins, generate strong cash returns and 
exploit market opportunities.

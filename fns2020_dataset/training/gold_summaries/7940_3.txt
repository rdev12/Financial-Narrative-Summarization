Imprint Plc | Chairman’ s statement
Introduction
I am pleased to report that Imprint
delivered a strong set of results for the
year ended 31 December 2006. This
strong performance was driven by
sector leading revenue growth both
from our organic and acquired
businesses, a doubling in net fee
income from our Asian operations and
a triple digit increase in pre-tax profits.
2006 was a year when our Group
delivered on its considerable potential.
Following the acquisition of three
businesses in 2005, the focus in 2006
was on delivering organic growth from
all of our businesses, particularly
through gains in market share and
a significant expansion in Asia.
During the year we continued to invest
in the Group’ s global operations, both in
the front and back offices, as we strive
to increase and maximise potential
earnings over the course of the cycle.
Over the last 12 months we have
increased our fee generating headcount
by 21%, up from 310 at 31 December
2005 to 375 at 31 December 2006.
Including directors and support staff,
the Group employed 480 staff at
31 December 2006, operating from
14 offices in eight countries.
As is the case with most successful
businesses whose primary assets are its
people, Imprint’ s achievements in 2006
are entirely the result of the dedication,
efforts and loyalty of the Group’ s
employees, and I should like to take this
opportunity to thank them all.
Financial highlights
Adjusted earnings per share (being
diluted earnings per share adjusted for
goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items) were 65% higher than 2005 at
22.3 pence. Diluted earnings per share
were 17.0 pence, up 136%.
Turnover increased by almost 50% to
£80.1 million through a combination of
strong organic growth and the full year
impact of the acquisitions of ECHM
and Morgan McKinley in 2005, which
together trade a significant volume of
temporary placements. Net fee income
(gross profit) increased by 41.0% to
£44.9 million, which included growth in
the non-acquired business of 32.6%,
from £13.0 million to £17.3 million.
Across the Group’ s primary markets of
the United Kingdom and Europe, net
fee income in the second half of 2006
increased by 24.3%, from £16.1 million
to £20.1 million, with both our organic
businesses and the businesses we
acquired in 2005 gaining market share.
I am pleased to report a full year
operating margin (being the conversion
rate of net fee income into operating
profit
1
) of 25.8% (2005 – 22.2%) and an
operating profit
1
of £11.6 million, up
64.1% (2005 – £7.1 million), which have
been achieved alongside continued
investment in our fee generating
capabilities. The growth in the margin
has been achieved thanks to positive
returns on investments made in
previous years and the financial benefits
which have been derived from all of our
businesses working closer together in
the sourcing of client and candidate
opportunities and the sharing of
overheads and group services.
Profit before tax increased by 109% to
£9.1 million (2005 – £4.4 million) after a
£1.8 million charge for goodwill
amortisation, a £0.3 million charge for
share-based payments and £0.4 million
of exceptional costs resulting from a
decision we took late last year to
relocate the London-based operations
of ECHM, Morgan McKinley and our
group shared service functions into the
same premises. This decision will
facilitate even closer cooperation
between our contingent recruitment
businesses (which share a similar
candidate pool) and our back office
functions, will reduce overheads and
will result in approximately 70% of our
London-based staff being located in the
same building.
The Group’ s balance sheet at 31
December 2006 was strong, with net
current assets of £15.2 million (2005 –
£9.4 million), cash of £4.3 million (2005
– £3.2 million), and banking facilities
available to the Group of £7.5 million.
The Board declared an interim dividend
of 1.3 pence per share and is proposing
to pay a final dividend of 2.6 pence per
share (2005 – maiden dividend of 2.0
pence), taking the total dividend for the
year to 3.9 pence per share. The final
dividend will be paid on 18 May 2007 to
those shareholders on the register at
20 April 2007.
Acquisition
On 19 July 2006, Imprint acquired the
Ingram Consultancy, one of the United
Arab Emirates’ leading recruitment
businesses. This acquisition has
provided Imprint with a strategic entry
point into the high growth Dubai and
Gulf Cooperative Community markets
and has further broadened the scope of
the services we offer to our commercial
and financial services clients.
Initial consideration paid was £900,000
in cash and by the issue of 115,924 new
ordinary Imprint shares. Further
potential consideration of up to £3.8
million is payable in a combination of
cash and new ordinary shares,
contingent upon the financial
performance of the acquired business
in the year ended 31 December 2006
and the years ending 31 December 2007
and 2008. No consideration is due for
performance in the year ended
31 December 2006.
The Ingram Consultancy trades as two
businesses, iQ selection, which provides
contingent recruitment services in the
region, and an executive search
business which has recently been
rebranded as WoodHamill Ingram to
reflect the international talent search
capabilities which the Group can now
provide in this geographical region.
Current trading and outlook
All of the markets and regions in which
the Group operates continue to be
buoyant and the short term outlook for
the Group is therefore encouraging.
Imprint is well placed to continue to
grow earnings and continue its
expansion in 2007 by further increasing
headcount and by enlarging the scope
of its service offerings, thereby
diversifying its revenue streams. The
Board is actively investigating new
office openings and continues to review
selective acquisitions that meet the
Group’ s strict cultural, operational and
valuation criteria.
I look forward to 2007, as Imprint seeks
further to increase market share in its
established markets, while also growing
in new sectors and geographies.

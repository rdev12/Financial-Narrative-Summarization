ClearSpeed Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Chairman’s statement
Introduction
ClearSpeed made considerable 
progress during 2005, achieving a
number of significant milestones in 
its markets and product development
whilst at the same time containing
costs. These included delivering the
world’s highest performance processor
for 64-bit floating point operations, 
and culminated in December in both
the group’s first commercial product 
– the Advance
™
Board – becoming
available, and a successful fundraising
which has placed the group in the
position of being well funded to 
address a potentially substantial 
market opportunity. 
Financial results
The group was successful in controlling
both its costs and cash, while at the
same time undertaking a substantial
product development programme and
achieving the steady building-out of the
other capabilities needed to support
the increasing level of commercial
activities. The year finished in line with
group expectations: the retained loss
was £6,412,000 and the cash outflow
from operations was £6,824,000.
Turnover increased to £439,000 for the
year, compared to £247,000 for the
previous year. The growth in revenues
principally occurred towards the end 
of the year when the group’s first
commercial product began to ship 
to customers. The revenue for the
second half of the year was £293,000.
The group finished the year with a
significantly strengthened balance sheet
following the raising of approximately
£20,070,000 (net of expenses) by way
of a placing. 
Technical progress
Since ClearSpeed floated on AIM 
in July 2004, the group has made
considerable progress in achieving 
its technical goals.
During 2005, a key focus was the
continued development of the group’s
first commercial products: the CSX600
processor and the Advance
™
Board
which has two CSX600 processors. 
The CSX600 was demonstrated for 
the first time at the International
Supercomputer Conference at
Heidelberg in June, and is both the
world’s highest performance 64-bit
floating point processor and the world’s
most power-efficient processor for
these performance levels. 
Commercial progress
Following the important milestone 
at Heidelberg in June, in August the
group was invited by Intel to co-present
at the Intel Developer Forum in San
Francisco on the use of the CSX600
with Intel processors running Intel’s
Math Kernel Library. In November, 
the group demonstrated the Advance
™
Board at the Supercomputing
Conference in Seattle and was very
pleased that demonstrations of this
board was also given on the stands of
AMD, IBM, Intel and Sun Microsystems.
“The order from Sun Microsystems for the Tokyo 
Institute of Technology is a significant milestone 
in the group’s development.”

On 15 November 2005, the first day 
of that conference, the Tokyo Institute
of Technology announced that
ClearSpeed, as part of a consortium 
led by NEC and Sun Microsystems, had
been selected to deliver Japan’s highest
performance supercomputer. Sun has
announced that, in its first phase, this
computer will use 360 ClearSpeed
Advance
™
Boards. 
Offering power-efficient performance
and using 96 cores in its CSX600
processor, the group was also pleased
that 2005 was the year in which
performance per watt was identified 
as “the new metric” for the industry, 
and that multicore processing became
established as a dominant trend in the
continued development of processors
for the computing industry.
Board
During 2005 the board made two 
key appointments. In September 
Paul Webb, who has extensive
experience in technology companies,
was appointed chief financial officer.
Also in September, Shanker Trivedi was
appointed as a non-executive director.
Shanker has recently joined Callidus
Software as vice-president and chief
marketing officer, and previously was
vice-president of datacentre solutions
for Sun Microsystems Inc. and before
that vice-president and managing
director of Sun Microsystems in 
the UK.
Outlook
I am pleased to report that since 
the end of 2005 the group has
continued to make valuable progress.
The order from Sun Microsystems for
the Tokyo Institute of Technology has
been shipped, which is a significant
milestone in the group’s development.
At the same time, discussions with
other customers are progressing
satisfactorily. 
As a result of the recent fundraising, 
the successful development and
demonstration of the CSX600 processor,
and the increasing commercial activity,
the board believes that ClearSpeed 
is well placed to make further
substantial progress.

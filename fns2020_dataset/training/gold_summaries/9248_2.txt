 Laird PLC    01   
Financial highlights
 Explanatory notes:
(i)  Laird uses underlying results as key performance indicators. Underlying proﬁ t before tax and underlying earnings per share 
are stated before exceptional items, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible assets 
and goodwill, the gain or loss on disposal of businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of ﬁ nancial instruments, 
and acquisition transaction costs. The narrative that follows is based on underlying operating proﬁ t, proﬁ t before tax and 
earnings per share, as the directors believe that these provide a more consistent measure of operating performance.
*  The weighted average number of shares used to calculate earnings per share was 211.6 million in 2009 and 204.3 million 
in 2008, following the Rights Issue announced in October 2009. 2008 earnings and dividends per share have been restated 
for the effect of the Rights Issue.
 The Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009 contains the Directors’ report on pages 3-46.

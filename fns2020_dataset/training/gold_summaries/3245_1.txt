Chief Executive’s Review
Business review
I am pleased to report that Ceres Power 
has successfully delivered on the 
objectives that we set ourselves in  
last year’s Annual Report. Substantial 
achievements have been made in our 
priority areas: value engineering of  
the core Combined Heat and Power 
(CHP) product; preparation for mass 
manufacturing; delivery of key private 
and public sector contracts; securing 
new commercial contracts to get 
product to market in volume; and 
growing revenues and maintaining  
a strong balance sheet.
Product 
We have adopted a rigorous Alpha, 
Beta, Gamma product development 
process based on industry best practice 
for bringing new consumer durable 
products to market. This involves a  
three stage process of performance 
validation, reliability testing and mass 
production, after which the product  
is ready for mass market launch. 
In June this year, we announced that 
the CHP product Alpha design phase 
had been completed under the 
programme with British Gas, meeting 
requirements for ease of installation, 
service and maintenance and 
designed for volume manufacture.  
In addition, we also announced  
to the market our roadmap for the  
CHP product launch in the UK. 
We have successfully delivered our first 
milestone on this roadmap with the 
build and test of a 1kW Fuel Cell Module 
meeting all the performance, size and 
weight requirements under the Alpha 
phase. The Fuel Cell Module was 
operated on three different fuel types: 
mains natural gas, methane and 
propane. On each fuel, it delivered a 
maximum electrical output of just over 
1kW and was operated over a broad 
range of power outputs demonstrating 
its controllability and efficiency. The core 
Fuel Cell Stack within the integrated Fuel 
Cell Module demonstrated a heat to 
power ratio of better than 1:1 and was 
built using Ceres Power fuel cells made 
by scaleable manufacturing processes.
The Fuel Cell Module has been 
packaged to fit overall dimensions  
of 205mm by 305mm by 305mm. 
Including its thermal insulation it weighs 
less than 25kg, meeting the Alpha CHP 
product targets. Together, these size 
and weight achievements enable the 
CHP product to be wall-mountable and 
easy to install, essential to maximise 
mass market access. This milestone 
achievement underpins the Group’s 
confidence that it will complete the 
Alpha CHP build by the end of 2008.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing development  
work during the year has focused on 
migrating from low-volume techniques to 
scaleable mass manufacturing solutions 
using production-intent machines, 
materials and processes. Significant 
gains have been made in processing 
speeds, automated handling and 
statistical process controls. 
In preparation for mass production 
scale-up, detailed planning for the 
Mother Plant has been completed and  
a shortlist of possible sites has been 
agreed. This strategy of centralised  
in-house volume manufacturing of  
The shift from 
centralised 
generation  
to distributed 
microgeneration 
could be 
equivalent to  
the shift from 
mainframes  
to PCs 05
CERES POWER HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
the core Fuel Cell Module from the 
Mother Plant is being followed in order  
to maximise value capture, intellectual 
property (IP) protection and operational 
efficiency. Key balance of plant 
components and sub-assemblies  
are being co-developed and  
sourced from cost-effective, high  
quality volume suppliers from across  
a global supply chain.
Operations
In support of the Alpha, Beta,  
Gamma CHP programme, the Group  
is increasingly investing in dedicated 
facilities for performance and durability 
testing as well as additional analytical 
equipment to support quality 
assurance. The Group has also 
continued to invest in the professional 
development of existing employees  
and the recruitment of experienced 
people in manufacturing operations, 
supply chain management, systems 
engineering and quality systems.  
This is set to continue as new 
commercial contracts are secured  
and manufacturing is scaled-up. 
By focusing on a core platform 
technology with attractive cost and 
performance characteristics, a number 
of potential market opportunities are 
being targeted in different countries 
and market segments. This maintains 
highly efficient operations with a 
relatively low cost base.
Commercial 
The highlight of the year was the 
signing of a major new development, 
trialling and distribution agreement with 
British Gas, building on a long-standing 
relationship formally established in 2005. 
British Gas CHP agreement
Following the 
successful 
demonstration  
of an integrated  
wall-mountable CHP 
Unit, Ceres Power 
signed a major  
new agreement with 
Centrica plc, trading  
as British Gas.  
Under the terms  
of this agreement, 
British Gas is paying 
£5 million and 
committing its 
operational resources 
to support a 
development and 
trialling programme. 
Ceres Power has also 
secured a volume 
forward order from 
British Gas to deliver  
a minimum of 37 ,500 
CHP products in 
aggregate over a four 
year period starting in 
2011, with substantially 
greater levels of  
sales expected. As  
a key part of the 
agreement Centrica 
invested £20 million to 
acquire a 10% equity 
stake in Ceres Power. 
British Gas is the 
largest residential 
energy supplier in  
the UK with more than 
16 million customer 
accounts. In a  
UK market where 
more than 1.5 million 
boilers are installed 
each year, it has  
the largest installation 
& maintenance  
force for domestic 
central heating.
“This technology 
has the potential 
to transform the 
domestic central 
heating market, 
enabling our 
customers to 
generate cheap, 
reliable and  
low-carbon 
electricity in their 
own homes.” 
Gearoid Lane, Director of 
British Gas New Energy

Chief Executive’s Review
continued
Under this agreement, British Gas is 
paying £5 million towards the costs of 
developing and trialling CHP products 
for volume launch in the UK. In addition, 
British Gas is committing its operational 
resources to support this programme 
including sales and marketing, training, 
installation, servicing and logistics. 
British Gas is the largest residential 
energy supply company and installer  
of gas appliances in the UK. This  
agreement provides Ceres Power with 
an unparalleled channel to market for 
residential CHP products. 
British Gas has also placed a volume 
forward order with Ceres Power to 
supply a minimum of 37,500 CHP 
products over a four year period, 
conditional upon completing the 
trialling phase and agreeing standard 
commercial terms. Both companies 
have agreed to promote the Ceres CHP 
product with the intention of achieving 
substantially greater levels of annual 
sales over the four year period. 
Ceres Power is also focusing on 
developing other markets for CHP 
products and is actively seeking 
partners to help expand internationally.
The programme with EDF Energy 
Networks to develop an energy security 
device for use in UK homes has met all 
the milestones to date, and the Group 
is expected to deliver a prototype under 
the existing contract on schedule  
during Q1 2009. The product uses  
the core Fuel Cell Module running off 
packaged fuel and is hybridised with 
an electrical storage unit. This capability 
will enable the Group to address global 
opportunities for energy security 
applications including uninterruptible 
power supplies, load-shedding  
support, battery charging and  
romote power generation. 
Financial 
Revenue for the year increased 
substantially to £0.7 million (2007: £0.1 
million), through the successful delivery 
of technical milestones under the 
Group’s contracts with its commercial 
partners. In February 2008, the Group 
received the first milestone payment  
of £1 million from British Gas, and is 
recognising this as revenue over the 
Alpha phase of the contract which 
continues into and is expected to 
complete in the current financial year. 
Following the completion of several 
existing public sector contracts during 
the year, other operating income fell 
13% to £0.8 million (2007: £1 million).
The Group has continued to invest in its 
product development, manufacturing 
and commercial capabilities across the 
business. This has resulted in research 
and development expenditure 
increasing 16% to £5.7 million (2007: £4.9 
million) and administrative expenditure 
increasing 8% to £2.2 million (2007:  
£2 million). Finance income rose 63% to 
£1 million (2007: £0.6 million) as a result 
of raising approximately £20.2 million 
(net of expenses) through the issue of 
new shares during the year and rising 
short-term interest rates. The loss for the 
year increased by 2% to £5 million (2007: 
£4.9 million), reflecting the increase in 
operating expenses net of the increase 
in revenue and interest income.
The net cash used in operating activities 
increased by £0.3 million to £3.7 million

(2007: £3.4 million) mainly due to the 
reduction in income tax received in the 
year. Cash investment in property, plant 
and equipment increased by £0.5 
million to £1.1 million (2007: £0.6 million) 
reflecting investment in the Product 
Facility and manufacturing equipment 
during the year. 
Cash inflow from financing activities 
increased by £19.7 million to £20.2 million 
(2007: £0.5 million). This was mainly due 
to the issue in February 2008 of 6,671,838 
new shares at a price of 300p per share 
to GB Gas Holdings Limited (a subsidiary 
of Centrica plc), which raised £20 million 
(before expenses). The Group’s cash 
and cash equivalents increased by 
£16.3 million (2007: decrease £2.9 million). 
The Group’s liquidity position is  
strong with £27.5 million in cash and 
cash equivalents. All surplus funds  
are invested in short-term, low-risk  
triple-A rated money market funds 
in accordance with the Board 
approved Group treasury policy  
which is focused on preserving  
the Group’s capital. 
Outlook
The Board has set out a clear roadmap 
through to commercial launch in the  
UK of the CHP product in collaboration 
with British Gas. In addition, we have 
committed to build commercial and 
operational capabilities to grow the 
business and to expand internationally. 
To achieve these objectives, our 
priorities for the next 12 months will be to:
complete the Alpha CHP product 
build using fuel cells from scaleable 
manufacturing processes;

Ceres Power has achieved a twenty-fold 
improvement in processing speed for  
the drilling of fuel cell steel substrates.  
These gains resulted from the Group acting 
as specifier and system integrator  
for a machine that combined available 
sub-systems for the optics, motion control 
and power supply into a dedicated design 
tailored for mass production.
This approach allowed Ceres Power  
to minimise development spend, capture 
Intellectual property and maintain direct 
control over its supply chain whilst building 
important in-house manufacturing 
Manufacturing scale-up
capabilities. Further improvements 
involved eliminating manual handling 
by successfully implementing a novel 
automated substrate handling process.
This overall programme demonstrates 
how the Group is successfully developing 
scaleable mass manufacturing 
solutions in parallel with its product 
engineering programme. The 
associated reductions in capital 
spending will directly contribute  
to the CHP product’s ability to be 
manufactured cost-effectively.

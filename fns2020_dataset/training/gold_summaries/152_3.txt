Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Abcam plc
Chairman’s review
Introduction
This is my first full year review as Chairman of Abcam and 
covers a period during which the global economic environment 
has continued to create challenges of exceptional scale and 
duration for many companies. It is therefore very pleasing to 
report another outstanding performance from Abcam.
Financial highlights
Revenue increased by 25.2% to £71.1m (2009: £56.8m). 
Over the period we benefited from the relative weakness of 
Sterling, which had a positive impact on sales, but less so than 
in recent years. However, underlying sales growth at constant 
currency rates was still very strong at 23.1% (i.e. if foreign 
currency exchange rates had remained unchanged from 2009) 
with good performances coming from each of our main 
geographic markets.
Operating profit increased by 61.6% to £25.6m (2009: £15.9m 
after a non-recurring fixed asset impairment related charge of 
£1.1m). This strong performance reflects some benefit from 
exchange rates but also good cost management in the purchasing 
of OEM products, greater production efficiency leading to lower 
costs for our own products and tight operational cost control 
which, as sales have increased, has enabled the benefits of the 
operational gearing of the business to come through. Although 
opportunities exist within the business for further operational 
gearing, these are more limited and are unlikely to be at the 
same scale as in the 2009/10 financial year.
Lower interest rates led to a reduction in investment income, 
meaning that the growth in profit before tax was 58.4% at £25.8m 
(2009: £16.3m after a non-recurring fixed asset impairment 
related charge of £1.1m). After the award of share-based 
incentives to employees and the issuing of new shares following 
the exercise of share options, the growth in Earnings Per Share 
(EPS) was 54.5% to 53.82p (2009: 34.83p).
Cash flow in the period has been exceptionally strong with cash 
generated from operations of £24.9m (2009: £16.4m prior to 
one-off receipt of lease incentive of £1.1m). Operating cash flows 
before working capital movements were £28.7m (2009: £18.9m), 
giving a cash conversion ratio of 86.8% (2009: 87.0%). 
At 30 June 2010 cash and short-term deposits amounted 
to £40.2m (2009: £25.5m). 
“ Abcam has been resilient in the recent economic turmoil and we are fortunate 
in being geographically well-hedged, in a market where increasing levels of 
research mean that demand continues apace for high quality research tools.”

Dividends
Last year the Board increased the dividend distribution ratio 
to 35% of post-tax profit in the light of the strong cash flow and 
continued success of the Group. Further progress has been made 
on both these fronts in the 2009/10 financial year and consequently 
the Directors are recommending that the distribution ratio be 
increased to 37.5%. An interim dividend of 5.42p per share 
was paid in April 2010 and the Directors are recommending a 
final dividend of 14.61p per share, making a total of 20.03p for 
the year, an increase of 65.4% on that paid last year. Subject 
to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in 
November, the final dividend will be paid on 26 November 2010 
to shareholders on the register on 5 November 2010.
Proposed share sub-division
In recent years the market price of the Company’s ordinary 
shares of one pence each has risen to a level where the Board 
believes that it is appropriate to propose the sub-division of each 
of the existing ordinary shares into five new ordinary shares of 
0.2 pence each. This may improve the liquidity and marketability 
of the ordinary shares of the Company by reducing the market 
price of an ordinary share and increasing the number of shares 
in issue. The Board will seek approval from shareholders for the 
proposed sub-division at the Company’s forthcoming AGM 
in November 2010.
People
I have been immensely impressed by the energy, knowledge 
and commitment of our staff, whom I would like to thank for their 
continued efforts on Abcam’s behalf, and in particular for their 
contribution to such a successful year. 
We also greatly value all our other stakeholders – customers, 
suppliers and shareholders – and appreciate their continued 
loyalty and support.
Outlook
Abcam has been resilient in the recent economic turmoil and 
we are fortunate in being geographically well-hedged, in a market 
where increasing levels of research mean that demand continues 
apace for high quality research tools. The new financial year has 
started well with sales in line with management’s expectations. 
However we still remain cautious due to the pressure on 
governments, especially in the West, to reduce their deficits 
and the potential for reductions in research funding which 
may impact our business.

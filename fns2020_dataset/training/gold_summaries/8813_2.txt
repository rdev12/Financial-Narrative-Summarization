Strategy
Looking forward both businesses will continue to focus on 
customer service, innovation and tight financial discipline.  
They both have clear strategies.
The key priorities of Menzies Aviation are:
Organic growth at existing stations, by maintaining  
a strong focus on delivering great service at the right  
price while keeping costs lean.
Organic growth by opening new stations to achieve 
network density in key regional markets.
Acquisitive growth to accelerate our achievement  
of network density.
Developing and exploiting cross-sell and key account 
opportunities across the network.
Maximising our position in this high-growth sector.
The key priorities of Menzies Distribution are:
Accelerating our programme to remodel the cost base  
and protect the strong cash generation of the business.
Strengthening our clear No2 market position by working 
more closely with our retailer and publisher customers to 
benefit the consumer.
Developing innovative new products, services and revenue 
streams.
A relentless focus on improving customer service, 
productivity and operational excellence.
Prospects
John Menzies is a strong, profitable company, and both  
its divisions are leaders within their respective markets. 
Menzies Aviation has excellent growth potential and  
Menzies Distribution remains highly cash generative.
I am confident that the medium-term outlook for the Group  
is positive.

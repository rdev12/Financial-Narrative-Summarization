Chairman’s Statement
The past year has again demonstrated the success of our
strategy with positive progress across the enlarged Group.
Iain Napier, Chairman
Delivering value
across the Group
In what was a year of signiﬁcant
achievement for Imperial Tobacco 
we delivered another good operational 
and ﬁnancial performance.
Earnings and Dividends
Our adjusted earnings per share have 
risen by 15 per cent to 136.9 pence. 
Basic earnings per share were 
50.6 pence (2007: 116.7 pence, adjusted 
for the bonus element of the rights issue
in June 2008), primarily impacted by
restructuring costs, fair value movements
on derivatives, amortisation of acquired
intangibles and one-off acquisition
accounting adjustments, partially offset 
by brand divestment gains. 
Adjusted attributable earnings grew 
by 26 per cent to a little under 
£1.2 billion. In line with our policy, the
Board is proposing to pay out half of 
this as ordinary dividends. The Board
recommends a final dividend of 
42.2 pence per share, bringing the 
total for the year to 63.1 pence 
(2007: 60.4 pence, adjusted for the
bonus element of the rights issue in 
June 2008).

Altadis
On 25 January 2008 we completed 
the acquisition of Altadis, significantly
enhancing our business proﬁle. We 
have a strong track record in acquisitions
and a reputation for integrating new
businesses efﬁciently. 
The enlarged Group has around 40,000
employees, 58 manufacturing sites, an
extended geographic reach and a more
versatile brand and product portfolio,
including international strength in cigarette
and world leadership in ﬁne cut tobacco,
cigars and rolling papers. We now also
have a leading logistics platform in Europe.  
As part of the integration process we
announced a number of European
restructuring projects in June which will
enable us to strengthen our competitive
position and deliver the previously
announced annual operating efﬁciencies 
of approximately €300 million by the end
of the ﬁnancial year ending 30 September
2010, rising to approximately €400 million
by the end of the ﬁnancial year ending 
30 September 2012. The estimated 
one-off cash cost of achieving these
efﬁciencies is approximately €600 million.
Regrettably, these projects are impacting
our workforce and we are committed 
to providing a comprehensive range 
of support measures to assist 
affected employees. 
Driving Operational Performance
Altadis and integration have been 
key priorities during the year but 
we have also remained focused on 
driving the operational performance 
of the enlarged business, which included 
an eight month contribution from 
“With our
enhanced
geographic
and brand
proﬁle we
look to the
future with
conﬁdence.”

Chairman’s Statement continued
Altadis and the ﬁrst full year contribution
from Commonwealth Brands.
Whilst building on our strong proﬁt base 
in mature markets we pursue growth in
emerging markets and this year we made
excellent progress in Eastern Europe,
Africa and the Middle East.
The USA is another important growth
market and one where our cigarette 
and ﬁne cut tobacco shares further
increased in the year. 
These positive operational developments
are underpinned by our ongoing focus 
on reducing costs and effectively
managing our cash. 
The Rights Issue
From the outset, we said that the
acquisition of Altadis would be 
part funded by a rights issue. 
At our half-yearly results in May we
announced a 1 for 2 rights issue at a 
share price of 1475 pence per share to
raise £4.9 billion. The rights issue was
sized at the minimum level required to
maintain our investment grade credit
rating, to which we remain committed. 
Given the uncertainties affecting the capital
markets this year, it was gratifying to see
that the take-up rate was 97.2 per cent
and the remainder of the shares were
successfully sold in the market.
Following the success of the rights 
issue and two bond issues in September, 
we are comfortable with our current
ﬁnancing position.
Corporate Governance
As a major international company we 
seek to act in a fair and responsible
manner towards all stakeholders. 
It is the Board’s duty to review and
approve our Company’s policies in this
regard. We have in place processes which
enable us to meet the high standards 
of conduct expected of our Company. 
In September, we delisted from the 
New York Stock Exchange as part 
of our ongoing programme of business
simpliﬁcation. This will not compromise 
the integrity of our Corporate Governance
and internal control procedures and we 
will continue to communicate regularly 
with our investors based in the USA.  
Board Changes
David Cresswell, Manufacturing Director
and Anthony Alexander, Vice Chairman,
retired during the year and I would like 
to express my sincere thanks to them 
for their contribution to the Company. 
There have been several new additions 
to the Imperial Tobacco Board during 
the year.  
We were delighted to welcome Jean-
Dominique Comolli, former Chairman 
of Altadis, to the role of Non-Executive
Deputy Chairman. We also welcomed
Bruno Bich and Berge Setrakian, both
former board members of Altadis, to 
our Board as Non-Executive Directors. 
All have a tremendous wealth of
international business experience 
and their knowledge of the tobacco
industry will be invaluable in ensuring that
we maximise the signiﬁcant opportunities 
the enlarged Group offers.
In conclusion, I would like to thank our
employees for their contribution to another
successful year. Imperial Tobacco and
Altadis employees have developed strong
working relationships and their combined
skills and expertise will enable us to create
further sustainable value for our
shareholders. 
The turbulent economic conditions are
unlikely to change in the short term but 
we are resilient and highly cash generative.
With our enhanced geographic and brand
proﬁle, and strong business fundamentals,
we can look to the future with conﬁdence.

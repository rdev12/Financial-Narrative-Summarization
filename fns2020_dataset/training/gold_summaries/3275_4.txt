Exports

Engineering activity outside of the UK is a key driver of demand.
Approximately 70% of output is ultimately exported. Direct exports account for 30% of output 
with our customers located in Europe, America and Asia. Indirect exports, where Chamberlin 
businesses supply products to UK-based equipment manufacturers whose products are then 
shipped worldwide, account for approximately 40% of our output. Against this 30% of sales are 
driven by demand from the UK economy. Global demand for engineered products is strong and 
our UK customers, which include companies such as Siemens, Howden, CAT, JCB and Tata Steel, are 
typically leaders in their sectors. 
Chamberlin operates across 5 locations in the UK. The foundry Division specialises
in technically demanding castings in complex shapes and in specialist metallurgies.
Work is allocated across its three foundry sites based on size and metallurgy as follows:
 Light castings based in Walsall produces castings up to 5kg in grey iron;
 Medium castings based in Leicester produce 5kg to 100kg castings in a wide variety of iron alloys;
 Heavy castings based in Scunthorpe make 100kg and 6 tonnes castings again in a wide variety
of iron grades.
The two engineering businesses supply to regulated markets operating from two sites in the
West Midlands.

Introduction Performance Governance Financial Statements
In February 2011, the Group acquired the assets of Jebron Ltd from the 
administrator for £162,000. The original Jebron business had developed a 
number of high capability innovative products, but it had not been able to 
fully exploit these as a result of poor quality and customer service, combined 
with ineﬃcient manufacturing. Production was restarted in March 2011, at 
Jebron’s original premises, under the direction of the Exidor management 
team. Their immediate task was to improve both quality control through the 
production process and on time delivery to customers and having regained 
their conﬁdence start to grow the business.
Quality and service improvements were delivered over the summer, and 
with the transfer of manufacturing to our Cannock site in November 2011, a 
step change in production eﬃciency was achieved.
In the ﬁrst year of operation under Chamberlin, Exidor Door Controls as it 
has been re-branded, delivered approximately £2.0m of sales and £300,000 of 
operating proﬁt from a standing start.

Gall Thomson
Gall Thomson is the world’s leading 
supplier of marine breakaway couplings. 
Its subsidiary, KLAW, is a supplier of 
industrial couplings including quick release 
couplings and breakaway couplings.
A Gall Thomson marine breakaway 
coupling is used in the oil and gas industry 
to enable a loading line to part safely and 
then to shut off the product supply in the 
event of a vessel moving off station during 
the loading or discharging of oil and gas 
products, whether at offshore moorings or 
jetty terminals. The purpose of the 
breakaway coupling is to prevent 
environmental pollution without damage to 
pumping and transfer equipment.

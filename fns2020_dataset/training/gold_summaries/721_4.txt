Healthcare
Allocate’s largest sector, with over 360 
healthcare customers across 11 countries,  
is where we witness first hand the effects  
of changing operational models, evolving 
legislation, increasing demands on staff 
and financial pressure.

address these issues by optimising people, 
processes, performance and assurance 
without compromising patient care. Allocate Software plc

Allocate continues to derive revenue  
from sectors which are required to manage 
workforces with complex shift and capability 
requirements. Historically this mainly 
consisted of Maritime and Offshore 
engineering customers, however, the 
acquisition of Time Care and RosterOn  
have brought a broader customer base 
including, security services, transport, 
mining, retail, education and government.
Allocate’s industry leading DefenceSuite is 
designed to meet the complex requirements 
of modern defence forces. With a proven 
track record, it has been deployed in a 
number of organisations including: the Royal 
Navy, the British Army, the Royal Australian 
Navy, NATO, the Australian Army and The 
Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

Stop Nuisance Calls
We do not cold call or send spam  
texts or emails. We are acutely  
aware of how invasive and upsetting 
nuisance calls can be and believe  
this unscrupulous practice should  
be stamped out. In October 2014 we 
launched our Stop Nuisance Calls 
campaign calling upon the 
government to take a much stronger 
stance against the offenders in UK 
industry and to proactively support 
consumers who are subject to millions 
of nuisance calls every year. On  
25 February 2015 the Government 
increased penalties and lowered the 
threshold for imposing fines, which is  
a positive first step.
Connecting
Once the LSA has established all the relevant 
facts and details the consumer is connected 
directly to a PLF. We connect around 80,000 
qualified PI enquiries to our panel of 50 
specialist PLFs each year. Our PLFs value  
the consistent quality and mix of enquiries. 
Without the service which NAH provides 
thousands of genuine PI victims would be 
left without a route to justice. 
We believe that access to justice is a 
fundamental right and our business helps 
secure this for hundreds of people every 
week. For more than 20 years National 
Accident Helpline has helped millions of 
people who have suffered a genuine 
injury through no fault of their own.
Our business
Our history
Listening
Our Legal Service Advisors (LSAs) are 
trained to help consumers understand if they 
have a valid claim. LSAs are experienced at 
identifying claims with merit and only pass 
these across to our Panel Law Firms (PLFs). 
Critics of the PI sector make sweeping 
statements about fraudulent claims 
without due consideration for the 
essential assistance that NAH and the PI 
sector provides to genuine claimants. 
Attracting
We understand that Personal Injury victims 
can feel like the Underdog when making a 
claim and many are not comfortable 
contacting a solicitor directly. Consumers 
see us as approachable experts who will 
listen and advise in an empathetic way.  
Our NAH brand and marketing activity 
generated around 248,000 inbound consumer 
contacts in 2014. We do not cold call and we 
lobby against nuisance marketing.  3 NAHL Group plc

Our market
We have a leading position in  
the PI market and NAH’s focus  
is on the higher margin, faster  
growing segments.
The PI market is large and fragmented with approximately one million claims per 
annum. Claims can be divided into three segments: Road Traffic Accident (RTA); 
non-Road Traffic Accident (non-RTA) and medical negligence. Whilst over three 
quarters of the overall PI market comprises RTA claims, NAH’s focus remains on 
the higher margin, faster growing segments of medical negligence and non-RTA 
claims. These accounted for 76% of NAH’s total qualified enquiries passed on to 
PLFs in 2014. 
The UK PI market is relatively flat, in overall terms, but medical negligence is 
growing at about 12%

 and non-RTA at about 7%

shares are 1.9%

regulatory environment is driving industry consolidation with a 56% reduction

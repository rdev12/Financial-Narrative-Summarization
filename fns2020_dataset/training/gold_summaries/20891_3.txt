 LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
POSITIONING 
FOR THE FUTURE
Company and our management 
have been well prepared to meet 
the challenges ahead. I look forward 
to his continued support, not 
only of the Group, but also in the 
development of the mining industry 
in Chile in his new role as President 
of Sonami.
A RESPONSIBLE 
PARTNER IN THE 
COMMUNITY
As we work to reduce our cost 
base we must do so in a way 
that reflects our responsibilities 
to the communities – and the 
environment – in which we operate. 
I am delighted therefore with 
the demonstrable progress that 
Antofagasta has made to strengthen 
its community relations during 
2016. Chief among these is the 
agreement we reached in April with 
the Caimanes community which led 
to the resolution of two court cases 
relating to the Mauro tailings dam. 
Los Pelambres and the Antofagasta 
Group now move into a new era of 
community engagement.
Dear shareholders,
Over the course of 2016 we saw 
copper prices begin to stage a 
recovery from the lows at the 
beginning of the year and this has 
continued into 2017. While this 
is undoubtedly good news, we 
must be careful as an industry 
to guard against falling back 
into complacency.
Despite considerable efforts – the 
industry still has further to go 
in order to put costs back on a 
sustainable footing.
At Antofagasta, our response to 
these challenges has been to renew 
our focus on producing profitable 
tonnes. This is an essential strand in 
our strategy to ensure our business 
will generate positive free cash flow 
through the cycle and generate 
decent returns on the capital we 
invest. Our employees have worked 
hard over the last 12 months to 
improve the Company’s operating 
performance and reliability, 
achieving some notable milestones. 
The Antucoya mine successfully 
reached full production capacity 
during 2016 and the Zaldívar 
mine, in which we acquired a 50% 
interest in December 2015, was 
fully integrated into our operations 
during the year.
As a result of these efforts, over the 
course of 2016 costs have come 
down, productivity improved and 
copper production has grown to 
almost 710,000 tonnes. While we 
anticipate prices will be stronger 
in 2017 than in 2016, we must 
continue to implement our strategy 
of reducing costs sustainably 
and producing only profitable 
tonnes in a way that benefits all of 
our stakeholders.
AN IMPORTANT 
PILLAR IN CHILE’S 
DEVELOPMENT
Despite the fall in prices over the 
last few years, the copper industry 
in Chile still has a vital role to play 
both in the country’s development 
and in the global markets. While 
I believe that Chile needs to continue 
to diversify its economy as the 
country raises living standards for 
all, we must not lose sight of the 
very important role that the copper 
industry has to play.
I believe that copper remains a 
central pillar in Chile’s development. 
The industry contributed some 8% 
of Chile’s gross domestic product 
last year. Approximately 50% of 
this is reinvested back in to Chile’s 
economy, securing jobs, supporting 
local businesses and helping to 
create the prosperity which drives 
the country’s development. The 
industry contributed $3 billion in 
taxes during 2015, allowing the 
government to invest in education, 
social housing, roads, rail and other 
vital infrastructure.
If managed properly, copper will 
have a long-term role to play in 
Chile’s development. The country 
still has 30% of global copper 
reserves. With the right incentives 
in place and working with all the 
stakeholders involved – employees, 
communities, companies, 
shareholders and local and regional 
government – we can develop these 
reserves safely and to the benefit of 
future generations of Chileans.
WELCOMING OUR 
NEW CEO
In April 2016 we welcomed 
Iván Arriagada as CEO of the 
Antofagasta Group. He has over 
25 years of operating and financial 
experience in the mining and oil and 
gas industries, including leading the 
Group’s mining division since early 
in 2015. Iván is the right person 
to succeed Diego Hernández, 
having worked closely with him 
in the preceding year. His focus 
on cost discipline and operating 
performance has proven very 
effective in navigating the current 
challenge of low copper prices. His 
strong commitment and leadership 
of our expansion initiatives has 
enhanced our ability to grow 
profitable production in the future.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank 
Diego for his commitment and 
dedication over these past four 
years. Under his leadership the 
OUR CORE VALUES
RESPECT INNOVATION
EXCELLENCE SAFETY AND HEALTH

4 ANTOFAGASTA ANNUAL REPORT 2016 NEW LEASE OF LIFE 
FOR MICHILLA
Last year we announced the closure 
of Antofagasta’s first mine, Michilla. 
As I said at the time, this was an 
important moment both for the 
Company and for me personally 
– Michilla was the mine where 
I completed my first internship 
when I was just 18 years old. 
I am delighted that during 2016 we 
found a new owner for the mine, 
another Chilean mining company, 
which will be able to continue its 
operations and help secure jobs in 
the region.
SAFETY
The safety of our employees and 
the communities in which we work 
is our number one priority. Our 
target is to achieve zero fatalities 
at our operations. Therefore 
I regret to report that during 2016 
Antofagasta had two fatalities. On 
behalf of the Board – and myself – 
I would like to express our sincere 
condolences to the families of our 
departed colleagues. 
BOARD CHANGES
During the year Hugo Dryland 
retired from his position as Non-
Executive Director of the Company, 
a position he has held since 2011. 
I would like to thank Hugo for his 
valuable insights and guidance on 
a wide range of matters and for the 
significant contribution he made 
to the Company during his time 
on the Board. Hugo was replaced 
by Francisca Castro, who brings 
with her extensive experience in 
mining, energy and finance, in 
Chile – where she has worked 
for the government and Codelco 
– and internationally. I know her 
knowledge and expertise will be of 
great benefit to Antofagasta.
In August we announced that Ollie 
Oliveira, a Non-Executive Director of 
Antofagasta, was appointed Senior 
Independent Director. Ollie took over 
from Bill Hayes who remains on the 
Board. We also made several other 
changes to the Board committees 
with Ollie taking over as Chairman 
of the Audit and Risk Committee, 
and Vivianne Blanlot as Chairman of 
the Sustainability and Stakeholder 
Management Committee.
OUTLOOK
We made good progress in 2016, 
reducing costs and increasing 
production as the full impact from 
the new assets in our portfolio 
flowed through. This led to a 
strong end to the year, which was 
boosted by a marked strengthening 
in copper prices on higher than 
expected Chinese demand.
As we look ahead into 2017 we see 
a market which is more driven by 
supply considerations than demand 
factors, some of them short term. 
This may result in more supply 
disruptions than originally expected 
and the year ending in balance, 
or possibly in deficit. In any event 
the market should be in balance in 
2018 and in 2019 we expect to see 
supply constraints come through in 
the market as the impact of project 
deferrals is felt in the global market.
So, although prices and sentiment 
are improving, some of the 
challenges we have seen in the 
market over the last two or three 
years are expected to continue over 
the next 12 months. We are now 
seeing the return of inflationary 
pressures on input prices and this is 
one reason we remain committed to 
our strategy of reducing costs and 
putting them on a sustainably lower 
footing, producing profitable tonnes 
and delivering positive free cash 
flow through the cycle. With this 
approach we will maintain healthy 
margins during periods of lower 
prices and safeguard our financial 
strength to the benefit of all of our 
stakeholders – our employees, 
communities, shareholders and the 
government. This in turn sets us up 
well to take full advantage of any 
upturn in the market.
As a final note I would like to thank 
all of our employees and managers 
for their continued hard work. 
I look forward to 2017 and beyond 
with a greater degree of optimism 
than I have had for some years.

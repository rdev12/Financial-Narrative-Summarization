Chief Executive’s Review

Your Company continued to move forward
in 2006 with record revenue achieved from
712 unit completions – another record
output of new homes. These achievements
have improved gross profits to £23.7m from
£22.1m in 2006, although higher finance
charges and overhead costs have reduced
our pre-tax profits to £11.2m from £12.7m
in 2006.
Our continued investment in development
land – up from 2,030 plots last year to 2,850
plots at the end of 2006 – has caused the
increased finance costs necessary to secure a
four year landholding. This will form a
solid base from which the Company can
plan ahead with greater certainty in an
increasingly complex planning
environment.
The Market
Selling became more difficult as the year
progressed and two interest rate increases
compounded the difficulty. Demand for our
new homes remained strong, but we had to
manage customers’ expectations of values
on their existing properties as they traded-
up. Increasing the use of sales incentives
and allowances to maintain throughput
became necessary as customers expected
inducements in order to trade. These costs
affected margin and coupled with plot sales
to investors caused our operating margin to
fall to 13.4% from 15.6% in 2005.
Revenue
T otal revenue for 2006, all of which was
derived from the sale of new homes, was
£122.4m, an increase of 18.6% over the
2005 figure of £103.2 m.
The Company sold 712 homes in the year
(2005: 686) an increase of 3.8%. Average
selling prices increased 14.3% to £171,959
largely as a result of the increased
proportion of larger detached houses and
fewer affordable homes. The analysis of the
change in mix is shown below.
Mix 2006 2005
4/5 Bed Detached Houses 256 193
2/3/4 Bed T ownhouses 359 403
Apartments 72 26
Affordables 19 47
Bungalows/Conversions 6 17
T otal 712 686
The average price per square foot across
the product range increased by 4.1% to
£154.
The completions of new homes in the year
came from a total of 47 sites spanning
Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire
and Derbyshire, half of which were from
developments completed during the year.
We have an established expertise and long
record of developing brownfield sites and
in 2006 72% of homes sold were from
previously brownfield sites (2005: 73 %).

Profits 
Gross profit was £23.7m - 7.0% ahead of
last year’s £22.1m but gross margin fell
from 21.4% to 19.3%.
The year was a challenging one with an
increased use of incentives being required
to achieve sales and a higher proportion of
sales to investors. Overheads increased
from £6.1m to £7.3m in 2006 partly due to
one-off costs relating to the various board
changes, higher pension costs and costs
relating to the proposed relocation of head
office. These factors coupled with rising
build costs depressed the operating margin
which fell to 13.4% (2005:15.6%).
Balance Sheet
The total capital employed at December
2006 was £124.7m, an increase of 30.5%
over the year before. Stocks, comprising
land and work in progress increased over
50% from £112.9m to £169.8m at the end
of 2006. Shareholders’ equity was £47.4m
equivalent to 396.5p per ordinary share.
Land Bank
We have been successful in building up the
land bank despite a very competitive land
market in our region, with several new
entrants trying to establish a presence in the
area.
Plots held with planning permission at the
end of 2006 totalled 2,850 compared with
2,030 at December 2005. At the 2006 level
of completions this represents 4.0 years
supply up from 3.0 years at the end of
2005. In addition we have a further 209
plots which are under contract.
Expenditure on land in 2006 totalled
£69.6m.

Borrowings 
The increased investment in the land bank
was largely financed by increased
borrowings. Net debt at 31 December 2006
was £77.3m (2005: £54.8m), which equates
to net gearing of 163.0% (2005: 134.7%).
The average net debt in the year was
£72.7m.
Treasury and Interest Rate Risk
The Company finances its activities
through a mixture of shareholder funds and
debt. As part of the annual review of
facilities the Company has this month
signed a new overdraft facility which
supports the profile of the cash
requirements of the Company over the
next 12 months. On signing, the facility
increased to £45m and reduces back down
to £30m on 1 October 2007 for the balance
of the term. In addition the Company has a
committed term facility of £65m.
The Company has a policy to manage its
interest rate exposure through interest rate
swap agreements. During 2006 we have
entered into two interest rate swap
agreements which fix interest on £50m of
debt at 5.2%. The Company’s interest
expense is thus largely protected from
interest rate rises.
Risks to the Business
The Board reviews the principal risks to the
business on an ongoing basis. Major risks
that have been identified include:
• Impact of increased interest rates on
demand for new homes.
• Reduction in the level of employment
in the region of operation.
• Continued availability of land to
maintain ongoing business.
• Impact on build costs caused by
availability of skilled labour and
materials costs rising above general
inflation.

Health and Safety
The Company works hard to uphold its
good record in health and safety.
Construction management liaise closely
with our external advisers and regular
seminars are held to reinforce the
Company’s commitment.
Staff Training 
We continue to make a significant
investment in the craft based
apprenticeships of bricklaying and joinery
with a further 12 new recruits in 2006.
Time and money spent on their close
supervision in their early years with us is
repaid with loyalty through a high retention
rate.
Head Office staff are encouraged to
continue their vocational training and many
do so in their own time through evening
studies.
Design and Development
A number of new houses and apartments
have been prototyped in 2006 and now
form part of our sales product range.
The constant raising of building standards
affecting such factors as noise, energy
conservation and  sustainable drainage
solutions now means that the designs of all
our range have to be regularly revisited for
best practice to be achieved.
The Government has an increasingly green
agenda and has already asked our industry
to build carbon free homes within the next
10 years. Such demands ask a great deal of
our suppliers and sub-contractors and cost
pressures are evident.
People
The year’s results could not have been
achieved without the commitment,
enthusiasm and hard work of all our
employees, sub-contractors and
consultants, together with the continued
support of our customers and shareholders
and I would like to express the Board’s
gratitude to all those members of the team.

2013 was another year of solid progress 
for Senior.
Total Group revenue increased by 6.2% to £775. 1m 
(2012 – £729.8m). Revenue from continuing 
operations (excluding the sale of Senior Hargreaves 
in October 2012, which contributed £17.8m of 
revenue in 2012), increased by £63.1m (8.9%), 
including an incremental £33.9m from three 
acquisitions: Thermal acquired in November 
2013 (£1.0m); Atlas acquired in February 2013 
(£3.0m); and the full-year effect of the 
acquisition of GA in November 2012 (£29.9m). 
If the effect of acquisitions and a year-on-year 
favourable exchange impact of £5.4m are 
excluded, underlying revenue from organic 
operations increased by 3.3% on a constant 
currency basis. In 2013, 66% of sales from 
continuing operations originated from North 
America, 15% from the UK, 12% from the Rest 
of Europe and 7% from the Rest of the World.
Adjusted operating profit increased by £6.2m 
(6.1%) to £107.6m (2012 – £101.4m), due to a 
combination of the increase in organic 
operations’ revenue, further operational 
improvements and year-on-year acquisition 
contributions of £2.3m. Overall exchange rate 
movements had no impact on 2013 adjusted 
operating profit compared to 2012. Adjusted 
profit before tax increased by £7.0m (7.7%) 
to £98.1m (2012 – £91.1m). 
Excluding acquisitions, underlying adjusted 
operating profit from organic continuing 
operations increased by 4.7% on a constant 
currency basis. The Group achieved an 
adjusted operating margin of 13.9% in 2013 
(2012 – 13.9%). 
Total Group reported operating profit from 
continuing operations was broadly similar to 
the prior year at £93.3m (2012 – £93.7m).
The underlying tax rate in 2013 was 19.7% 
(2012 – 20.4%) and adjusted earnings per share 
increased by 7% to 19.00 pence (2012 – 17.75 
pence). Basic earnings per share rose by 1.0% 
to 17.22 pence (2012 – 17.11 pence).
The Group continues to be highly cash-
generative and delivered free cash flow of 
£63.8m (2012 – £57.6m) after increased net 
investment in capital expenditure of £28.8m 
(2012 – £26.0m). As a result, the level of net 
debt at the end of 2013 of £59.2m was 
comfortably below the £70.9m at the start 
of the year, even after spending £30.5m on 
acquisitions and investing a further £0.5m in 
the Group’s joint venture in China during 2013. 
This year-end net debt level leaves the Group 
well placed to fund future organic and 
acquisitive growth.
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 3.60 pence per share (2012 – 3.27 pence). 
If approved, this will bring the total dividends, 
paid and proposed, in respect of 2013 to 5.12 
pence per share, an increase of 10% over 
2012, slightly ahead of the increase in adjusted 
earnings per share. 
DELIVERY OF GROUP STRATEGY
Significant progress was made in delivering 
the strategy during 2013 with: the Group’s 
portfolio enhanced through two acquisitions; 
a healthy level of business being won on new 
programmes and market share gains being 
secured on existing platforms; the Group’s 
culture of operational excellence providing high 
levels of customer satisfaction and safer, more 
efficient factories; and the Group’s employees 
working enthusiastically and innovatively to 
deliver a strong performance in 2013 and to 
enhance the growth prospects for the Group.
The acquisitions of Atlas and Thermal in 2013 
have added the complementary capabilities of 
structural composites and hot-forming and 
aerospace insulation to the Group. When 
combined with the global reach, customer 
relationships and financial strength of the 
existing Senior operations, these additional 
capabilities are expected to provide healthy 
long-term growth opportunities for the 
Aerospace Division. Indeed, Atlas is already 
working together with Senior Aerospace BWT 
to provide cabin air-supply ducting systems for 
the future Bombardier CSeries, Mitsubishi 
Regional Jet and Embraer E2-Jet aircraft. 
Operating in successful end markets and 
being aligned with the right customers is 
an important determinate to Senior’s future 
growth prospects. The Group’s most important 
market is large commercial aircraft, now 
representing 36% of Group sales, where 
Boeing and Airbus collectively delivered 1,274 
aircraft in 2013, 7% more than the prior year, 
and booked 2,858 net orders. Their combined 
order book of 10,639 aircraft represents a very 
healthy eight years’ production at current build 
rates, meaning good growth can be expected 
in the future. The Group’s customers 
increasingly operate on a global basis and it is 
important that Senior is able to support them 
across the world. Accordingly, during 2013 
further investment was made in the Group’s 
Chinese Joint Venture, with heavy-duty engine 
common-rail production commencing at the 
year end, and a new factory set up in Mexico to 
serve the North American land-vehicle market 
for flexible exhaust connectors. In Aerospace, 
having world-class production capabilities in 
Asia will be very important in the future as 
the region represents the fastest growing 
air-passenger market in the world. In its 
Thailand facility, Senior has a good foundation 
to build upon to meet this customer demand, 
signific Ant progress in delivering

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S SUMMARY  
OF THE YEAR 2013 PERFORMANCE  with 2014 planned to see the construction of 
significant additional capacity, including the 
installation of a specialist treatments facility, 
at a total cost of some £6m over the next 
three years.
In industries where customers have choices 
with whom they do business, Senior’s on-time 
delivery and quality record and its cost 
competitiveness are key to the Group gaining 
market share and winning work on new 
programmes. Accordingly, great focus is placed 
at each operation on using “Lean” principles, 
such as Kaizen events, to deliver operational 
improvements to reduce costs, improve 
product flow, optimise use of resources 
and improve safety. Investment in modern 
equipment and fit-for-purpose facilities, such 
as the new factory built for the structures 
business at Senior Aerospace Weston in 2013, 
are also ongoing requirements in an 
environment where technology and customer 
expectations are always advancing. Senior’s 
financial strength allows the Group to remain 
at the forefront in this regard with increases in 
the shipset value on the B787 and A350 during 
2013, and the fact that the Group now has 
30% more content on the B737 MAX and 56% 
more on the A320neo than the current B737 
and A320 aircraft respectively, providing 
tangible evidence of Senior’s success in 
delivering its strategy. 
Recruiting and developing good leaders is 
arguably the most critical aspect to the Group’s 
future success. Senior’s culture is one of 
empowered entrepreneurial leadership 
operating within a fixed control framework 
where communication of good and bad news is 
encouraged, and equally accepted, and success 
is recognised and fairly rewarded. Over the past 
five years, the Group Development Programme, 
which is personally important to me, has been 
successfully expanded and increasingly focused 
on leadership development. During 2014, the 
Programme is to be further enhanced with the 
introduction of a senior executive programme 
for potential future leaders and “Driving 
Innovation” workshops for all of the Group’s 
operating company CEOs, both in conjunction 
with Ashridge Business School. 
Whilst the historic performance of Senior 
over recent years, and the strong platform 
the Group has built for the future, clearly 
demonstrates healthy progress in 
implementing the Group’s strategy, the Board 
is cognisant of the need for strategy to evolve 
as markets and technologies change and the 
Group gets larger and more complex. As a 
consequence, the Board and Executive team 
increased their focus on strategy during 2013 
and can be expected to do so throughout 2014. 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Corporate responsibility is a key part 
of how we do business at Senior and I am 
pleased to report excellent progress on a 
number of fronts this year. 
We have enhanced our training and 
development programme and improved 
collaboration and sharing of good practices 
across the Divisions. During the year, we also 
improved the communication of our anti-
bribery and corruption measures and 
strengthened compliance through our internal 
audit processes. The Group has further 
reduced its carbon emissions and our core 
environmental metrics also demonstrated 
healthy improvement, as we invest to reduce 
energy and water consumption. Sustainability 
drives demand for many of our services and 
operating in an ethical and responsible manner 
is integral to our customer relationships. 
Improvements have also been made to our health 
and safety programme through the roll-out of 
technical standards for the core health and 
safety risks. These have helped to identify 
potential hazards and contributed towards 
improving our two key safety metrics, see 
table on page 17.
OUTLOOK 
The year has started satisfactorily and, with the 
large commercial aerospace market remaining 
strong and some early signs of an economic 
recovery taking place, progress is expected to 
be made across the Group’s operations during 
2014. The second half of the year is expected 
to benefit in particular from civil aircraft build 
rates continuing their upward trend, the A350 
aircraft being delivered to customers and an 
anticipated large expansion joint contract 
commencing delivery. However, whilst solid 
progress is expected to be made locally in 
2014, volatile foreign exchange movements 
add more uncertainty as to the reported Group 
outcome for the year.
Looking further ahead, the entry into service 
of the A350 in late 2014, and its subsequent 
production ramp-up, together with Boeing’s 
and Airbus’ plans to increase the build rates 
of their B787, B737 and A320 aircraft, mean 
the outlook for the large commercial aerospace 
sector is both strong and visible. This is 
Senior’s most important market, representing 
36% of Group revenue in 2013. However, price 
pressure remains ongoing across the 
commercial aerospace industry and is being 
managed in line with expectations. As well as 
increases in build-rates, Senior expects to 
benefit from the greater content it has on the 
new-engine versions of the high volume 
narrow-bodied aircraft, the A320neo and B737 
MAX, which are scheduled to enter service in 
2015 and 2017, respectively. Having a world-
class aerospace facility in Asia is also expected 
to lead to increases in market share as the 
recent contract awards to the Group’s Thailand 
operation, from Rolls-Royce for the A350 XWB 
engine and from Spirit AeroSystems on the 
B787, clearly demonstrate. This facility is now 
being significantly expanded.
Whilst a much smaller part of the Group, 
prospects also remain encouraging in the 
regional and business jet sector, with 
Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft, on which the 
Group has healthy content, commencing its test 
programme during 2013 and Senior winning the 
low-pressure ducting package for the Embraer 
E2-Jet. Less encouraging, is the outlook for 
military and defence, representing 14% of 
Group sales in 2013, with increases in the 
build rates of new programmes, such as the 
A400M military transporter and the P-8 naval 
reconnaissance aircraft, not expected to entirely 
offset the impact of reduced defence spending 
by the USA and European Governments.
In Flexonics, the longer-term outlook for 
Senior’s land vehicle operations is showing 
some early signs of improvement, with 
volumes of passenger vehicles in Europe 
anticipated to gradually improve from the 
six-year low seen in 2013, production of 
heavy-duty engine common-rails now 
commencing in China, and the Group’s global 
footprint leading to more customer enquiries 
for flexible exhaust connectors. Progress also 
continues to be made in winning additional 
heavy-duty exhaust gas recycling cooler 
programmes, although this has been slower 
than hoped for and the much improved life of 
the current product is resulting in lower 
revenue from spare-parts. Whilst the future 
level of the Group’s industrial activity is less 
visible, given its often one-off project nature, 
the Group’s industrial end-markets such as 
power generation, oil and gas, chemical 
processing, medical and semi-conductor are 
likely to grow broadly in line with global 
economic activity. In addition, environmental 
legislation continues to tighten across the 
globe which can be expected to provide 
greater demand for the Group’s products.
As well as the organic growth opportunities 
mentioned above, Senior’s cash-generative 
nature, strengthening market and financial 
position provide a solid platform from which 
the Group can continue to pursue acquisitive 
growth opportunities on a targeted basis. 
Consequently, whilst Senior will undoubtedly 
face a number of challenges as it pursues 
its growth agenda, the Group’s reputation 
and opportunities it is developing, mean the 
prospects for the future remain encouraging.

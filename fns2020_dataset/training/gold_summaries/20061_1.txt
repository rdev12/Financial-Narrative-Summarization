We are in a unique position to capitalise on what is fast 
becoming a tidal wave of interest and enthusiasm for 
genetic medicine.
2014 was a year of significant progress 
for Silence Therapeutics, achieving 
important technological advances in new 
capabilities and in the development of 
existing technology. As well as the ability 
to switch genes off using our modified 
siRNA and delivery systems, we added 
the ability to switch genes on using 
messenger RNA (mRNA). We were also 
successful in translating the efficacy of 
our DACC lung delivery system from 
rodents to non‑human primates (NHPs). 
We now have a versatile modular genetic 
toolkit that combines unique delivery 
systems, targeting a variety of organs, 
with different RNA payloads, enabling 
efficient gene expression modulation up 
as well as down. 
Our well‑established and embedded 
algorithm for high throughput pre‑clinical 
drug development has allowed us to take 
advantage of the highly specific nature 
of our technology, with the synthesis 
of a therapeutic RNA molecule and 
formulation into the appropriate delivery 
system being fast and affordable. This 
has enabled our ‘multiple shots at goal’ 
approach, which incorporates clear 
go/no‑go milestones prior to clinical 
development. 
Following the year end, we announced 
highly encouraging data from our 
Phase 2a pancreatic cancer trial and also 
won a European Patent Office appeal 
on our AtuRNAi
®
 trigger modifications. 
These combined successes have since 
led to a material capital raise and we are 
in a unique position to capitalise on what 
is fast becoming a tidal wave of interest 
and enthusiasm for genetic medicine.
A key objective was achieved in April 
2014 when we confirmed successful 
target gene knockdown in NHPs using 
our lung‑targeted delivery system, 
DACC, to deliver AtuRNAi
®
 siRNA 
molecules. These results demonstrate 
that we have crossed the translation 
gap between rodents and NHPs with 
the DACC system, achieving sustained 
knockdown for three weeks after a 
single dose. 
The technology translation of DACC to 
NHPs provides further validation of our 
delivery platform, adding to the existing 
translation evidence on AtuPLEX
®
, 
which targets the systemic vascular 
endothelium and is currently in the clinic. 
Broadening the number of organs and 
cell types which we can address remains 
a key focus for us and we are actively 
advancing earlier stage systems to the 
NHP stage.
During the year, we made exciting 
progress in delivering mRNA to induce 
protein generation, demonstrating that 
therapeutically relevant levels of protein 
are generated from the delivered mRNA 
cargo in vivo. We also established 
that our proprietary liposomal delivery 
formulations are capable of carrying 
a RNA payload far larger and more 
structurally complex than previously 
thought. Liposomal delivery systems 
are well suited to mRNA in comparison 
to other delivery technologies which 
are limited to smaller payloads. We 
have been able to rapidly optimise our 
lipoplexes for mRNA delivery and our 
expertise and know‑how in delivering 
RNAi triggering molecules has been vital 
in enabling us to make this progress. 
This technology breakthrough will greatly 
increase the range of indications which 
Silence can address.

With this ability to modulate gene 
expression both up and down in 
pre‑clinical animal models, we aim to 
fundamentally change the timelines, 
costs and risks of a traditional 
biotechnology business model. Our 
partnerships with some of the world’s 
leading academic institutions mean 
we are well positioned to advance the 
field of cutting edge therapeutics. We 
also continue to explore the potential of 
microRNA delivery and therapeutics.
In July 2014, we completed recruitment 
for the Phase 2a pancreatic cancer 
study for Atu027 in combination with 
the standard of care, gemcitabine. 
Atu027 is our leading siRNA based 
drug candidate. It uses our proprietary 
AtuPLEX
®
 technology to broadly deliver 
PKN3 targeting AtuRNAi
®
 molecules to 
the vascular endothelium. The primary 
objective of this trial was to assess 
safety and pharmacokinetics.
Post the year end, a preliminary 
analysis of this study indicated that 
the subjects who were exposed to a 
33% higher total dose of Atu027 had 
a longer duration of Progression Free 
Survival (median of 5.33 months) than 
patients on the lower exposure regimen 
(median of 1.81 months). This suggests 
a dose‑dependent beneficial effect 
of Atu027.
Even allowing for the small number of 
patients in the trial, these results show a 
clear positive early signal which requires 
further investigation. Atu027 has the 
potential to become a new therapeutic 
modality in oncology. This is an excellent 
outcome for Atu027 and the validation of 
our RNA therapeutics platform. In light 
of this data, we will be reviewing the 
protocol for the planned Phase 1b head 
and neck cancer study. 
Importantly, the safety data from this trial 
is consistent with the excellent tolerability 
observed in the more than 400 patients 
that have now been treated with our 
proprietary modified siRNA (AtuRNAi
®
). 
The study also provided further evidence 
of the favourable safety profile of 
Silence’s delivery platforms. 
Our pre‑clinical pipeline continues to 
develop. Encouraging results have 
been obtained in pulmonary arterial 
hypertension models, where our drug 
candidate was compared to the gold 
standard treatment. We are working on 
several further earlier stage projects and 
currently have collaborations in place 
with world leading academic institutions, 
including the University of Oxford, the 
University of Cambridge and Imperial 
College London.
Our partnerships with some of the world’s leading academic  
institutions mean we are well positioned to advance the field  
of cutting edge therapeutics.

Strategic report
Chief Executive’s review continued
Our newest delivery formulation, 
MacPLEX, is making promising progress 
and has shown effective and cell type 
specific targeting of liver macrophages. 
Macrophages are key immune cells and 
MacPLEX has the potential to be an 
enabling platform to tackle new disease 
areas. Plans for Atu111, targeting acute 
lung injury, continue to be reviewed. 
Another significant post year end 
development was the successful 
outcome of a European Patent Office 
hearing on our AtuRNAi
®
 trigger 
modifications. 
The Board of Appeal upheld our key 
RNAi trigger modification patent 
against challenges by four parties 
including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals 
Inc, its subsidiary Sirna Therapeutics 
Inc, Alcon Laboratories Inc, and an 
independent attorney.
This was a very important victory for 
Silence. It strengthens our already broad 
IP portfolio covering both RNAi triggers 
and delivery. We will continue to protect 
our position robustly whilst always ready 
to engage in licensing discussions. 
We are continuing discussions with the 
company which approached Silence for 
a licence for its AtuRNAi
®
 modified siRNA 
trigger. We also await news of licensing 
developments at Quark Pharmaceuticals, 
following the favourable Phase 2b results 
it announced for delayed kidney graft 
function last year.  Silence Therapeutics plc Annual report and financial statements 2014 09

The prospects for Silence have 
never been greater than today. 
RNA therapeutics has made significant 
technology strides and as such, is 
now able to attract enough capital to 
transition its technology to the clinic. 
As a global leader in the field, Silence is a 
major beneficiary of this trend. Following 
our most recent fundraising, we will be 
investing in our delivery technologies and 
capabilities, expanding our pre‑clinical 
and clinical pipelines and will also 
explore the potential use of our mRNA 
delivery technology for gene editing 
applications such as CRISPR/Cas9. 
Drug development is entering the age of 
genetic medicine and through our leading 
technologies and collaborations, Silence 
is giving the UK and Europe a central role 
in this ground breaking area. 
We look forward to the future with 
great confidence.

Georgia Healthcare Group PLC  Annual Report 2016  Strategic report
The structure of our business
We are the largest healthcare services provider in the fast-growing, predominantly privately-owned, Georgian healthcare services market. We lead 
the market by offering the most comprehensive range of inpatient and outpatient services and by targeting the mass market segment through our 
vertically integrated network of 35 hospitals and ten ambulatory clusters, as at 31 December 2016.
GHG’s market leading position, its unique business model with significant growth potential, and its experienced management team make it a 
compelling investment story. Furthermore, the first class leaders of our medical team are driving the improvement of service quality and access  
to healthcare across the organisation. These factors, together with the improved access to healthcare services through the Universal Healthcare 
Programme (“UHC”) financing, enable us to capitalise on existing service gaps and the overall lower quality of medical care in the country.
 Largest healthcare service provider in Georgia: 23.4% 
market share by number of beds (2,557), which is expected 
to grow to c.29% as a result of the renovation of two major 
hospital facilities, scheduled for completion in 2017 (additional 
c.600 beds)

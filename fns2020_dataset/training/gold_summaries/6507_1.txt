 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004 05
IINTRODUCTION
Genetix achieved an encouraging increase
in turnover of 13% (20% at 2003 average
US dollar exchange rate) during the year,
beneﬁting from a healthy opening order
book. We faced difﬁcult trading conditions
during the third quarter but this was offset
by a strong sales performance towards the
end of the year. During the year we began
the process of strengthening our position
within the pharmaceutical market by
focusing on systems that accelerate drug
target validation and product development.
We believe these areas of strategic interest,
centred around our new cell biology
products, will provide a platform for
growth over the coming years.
THE MARKET/UNDERLYING TRENDS
Our customers continue to develop
new areas of drug development within 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
sectors based upon the increased focus
on new biopharmaceutical products. The
introduction of automation has increased
the number of drug targets and the next
keyphase is the selection and validation of
targets of sufﬁcient interest for further in-
depth study. Genetix is rising to this
challenge by focusing the majority of its
R&D effort on cell biology and protein
expression while modifying its sales
approach to promote these new
technologies. The opportunities are
exciting because this market is potentially
signiﬁcant and the customer base has
funding available for instruments that are
capable of delivering efﬁciency gains and
therefore, a rapid return on investment. 
PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Against this background, Genetix achieved
turnover of £12.2 million (despite the
adverse impact of a weaker US dollar
estimated at £0.8 million) and proﬁt
before tax and goodwill of £1.2 million,
after goodwill of £0.9 million.
Instrumentation sales were £9.2 million,
an increase of 25% on 2003, including a
strong performance from our picking range
of products. Consumables and services
turnover was £3.0 million, down 14%
on 2003, and we are working hard to
improve sales by broadening the product
range, launching new internally developed
products and improving the link
between our instrumentation and
our consumables. 
Having built up our sales and marketing
team at the end of 2003, we had forecast
a reduction in short-term proﬁtability in
2004 in order to achieve our longer-term
goals. We constantly review our operational
structure to respond to changing market
conditions and as a consequence, we
reduced our headcount by 10% towards
the end of 2004.
The Group ﬁnished the year with a cash
balance of £22.2 million.
SALES AND MARKETING
We have increasingly adopted a
“team-based” sales process made up of
multi-skilled scientists, engineers and
commercial staff to progress good sales
opportunities due to the increasing
sophistication of our customers’ needs. We
will further develop this team approach in
conjunction with key account management
to improve our order conversion and
provide better support to our customers.
In addition, we will be reviewing all our
distributor relationships to ensure their
suitability for a particular product or range
of products.

UK sales were 21% higher than 2003 and
accounted for 14% of total sales, aided
by this team-based approach using the
resources and demonstration facilities at
New Milton. Sales to the rest of Europe
were 2% higher than 2003. As predicted
last year, the German market remained
depressed throughout 2004 but we expect
this to improve in 2005 as we introduce
our new cell biology products. In the US,
our largest and most important market,
sales were up 20% (34% at 2003 average
US dollar exchange rate) compared to the
previous year. In the rest of the world sales
fell by 10%, however, this region only
accounts for 9% of total sales but offers
good future growth prospects.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
The main initiatives were:
•
development of the ClonePix
FL
,
our mammalian cell colony picker,
extending the ClonePix family of
cell biology products;
•
reﬁnement of the aQuire scanner,
adding a third blue laser to expand
the range of cell, tissue and protein
arrays imaged;
•
further development of the QArray
and QPix (the “XT” version) to increase
throughput and data quality;
•
development of a new plate system for
maximising protein expression; and
•
development of new reagents for cell
biology, proteomics and gene
expression.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
R&D expenditure was maintained as 
we continued to develop our ultra 
high-throughput microarrayer, the
QArray
max
. In the second half of the year,
we focused on two new cell biology
projects – ClonePix
FL
and Clone
Select
–
both using our core skills in imaging,
picking, placing and bioinformatics. The
ClonePix
FL
uses ﬂuorescent technology
to produce a leading-edge instrument
capable of identifying, analysing and
selecting colonies of mammalian cells 
to increase the productivity of new
biopharmaceuticals. We have completed
our ﬁrst prototype instrument and have
received first orders from several blue-
chip pharmaceutical companies as “early-
adopters” of this exciting new technology.
The Clone
Select
system is complementary to
cell colony picking and addresses the
selection and sub-selection of cells with
different growth rates through the use of
advanced optics and imaging techniques.
R&D expenditure (excluding grant
recoveries) was £1.5 million (2003:
£1.4 million) including the QArray
max
project and the two new cell biology
projects. Work on our LINK project is now
nearing completion and will conclude at
the end of March 2005. The project has
raised the proﬁle of Genetix in the ﬁeld
of protein-protein interaction and the
technologies developed and experience
gained will be valuable as we develop our
know-how into new applications.
With effect from 1 November 2004,
R&D was split into two teams, focusing
primarily on two major projects, to
improve the concentration and
effectiveness of our R&D effort.
We continue to submit all potential
projects through our New Product
Development Committee to approve
their scientiﬁc and commercial viability
prior to development.
This year we have:
developed our range of products
to ensure they cover the full
range of applications and
processes used by our customers.
2004 Reagents
and Consumables
This year we have:
developed our family of
mammalian cell pickers and
extended the ability of our
successful ClonePix instrument.

ACQUISITIONS
The primary focus of the Group remains
organic growth. However, we reviewed
various acquisition opportunities during
the year but did not progress any of these
projects beyond due diligence.
OUTLOOK
We remain positive about our prospects
for 2005 given the opportunities outlined
above. Genetix is a respected player in its
ﬁelds of expertise and aims to exploit this
to differentiate itself further from its
competitors and improve sales and
proﬁtability.
Our key priority in 2005 is to concentrate
activity on the potentially signiﬁcant
markets within cell biology and penetrate
these as quickly as possible.

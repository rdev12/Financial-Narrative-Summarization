I am delighted to report a record set of results for the

Proposed dividend
The improved financial performance of the Group
during 2005 allows the Board to propose a
significantly improved dividend of 1.25 pence which,
subject to Shareholder approval, will be paid on 3 July
2006. This is a 25% increase on the last dividend paid
to shareholders on 4 July 2005.
Operational review
2005 was a year of consolidation in order to drive the
benefits from the integration of the previous year’s
acquisitions into the Group’s new operating structure.
2005’s results include new segmental reporting
disclosures which reflect the reporting structures now
implemented within the Group.
Our Security and Specialist Services operations
performed extremely well in 2005 reporting an
operating profit before goodwill amortisation of
£5.3 million on a turnover of £68.9 million
(2004: £1.7 million operating profit before goodwill
amortisation on a turnover of £30.3 million). The
performances of both First Security Group Limited
and TASS (Europe) Limited which were both
acquired in the second half of 2004 have exceeded
our expectations.
Our Integrated Services operations reported an
operating profit before goodwill amortisation of
£4.8 million on a turnover of £163.9 million
(2004: £3.0 million operating profit before goodwill
amortisation on a turnover of £159.8 million) despite
Chairman’s Statement
A L R Morton Chairman 
All key financial indicators
demonstrate very healthy
growth in 2005 MacLellan Report & Accounts 2005    5
suffering a £0.4 million “hit” to profits caused by the April 2005
administrative receivership of the Rover Group. The Chief Executive’s
Review sets out the many significant contract wins which our operations
secured in 2005 and we are particularly pleased that 2006 will see the
commencement of a new five year relationship with Prudential Property
Investment Managers to provide operational and facilities management
services at 14 retail destinations across the UK. The annual value of this
contract is expected to be in the region of £20 million.
Strategy
We are well positioned to benefit from the further consolidation which
is likely to occur in the outsourced business services markets in which
we operate. Although these markets are competitive, we see many
exciting opportunities for profitable growth including “bolt on”
acquisitions. Our immediate focus, however, is to continue to
expand organically in 2006 and produce further healthy growth in
earnings per share.
Outlook
The Board is encouraged by current trading and is enthusiastic and
confident about the Group’s prospects for 2006.

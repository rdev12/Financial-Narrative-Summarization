 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 10
CHIEf Ex ECUTIv E’S REv IEw The group has made good progress this year with 
the fastest rate of revenue growth since 2009. 
This has been achieved by investing in high levels 
of new customer recruitment, improving our product 
and promotional offers, especially online, and making 
progress with our key strategic initiatives. 
The 53rd week last year delivered revenue of £12.9m 
and operating profit of £2.9m. The commentary below 
is all based on a comparison of 2012/13 with the 
52 week version of 2011/12.
Revenue
Revenue growth has been delivered 
in our core home shopping business 
supplemented by increased 
contributions from our international 
and stores operations. For the 52 
weeks ended 2 March 2013 group 
revenue was £784.7m, up by 6.0% 
in total and by 5.5% on a like-for-
like basis. The growth in revenue 
accelerated as we progressed 
throughout the year, culminating in 
a strong second half which was up 
by 7 .1% on a like-for-like basis.
Customer Groups
The key objective of our marketing 
activity this year was to restore growth 
to the customer file, and this has been 
successfully achieved. Sales from new 
customers increased by 24% during 
the year benefitting from an extra £6m 
of marketing investment in media costs 
compared with the previous year. 
The additional investment has been 
spent with the online search engines 
on “pay per click” recruits, which is 
now our single largest channel of 
recruitment, and for television airtime 
for direct response advertisements. 
Inevitably these methods of 
recruitment bring in younger than 
average customers. 
In addition to the increased sales from 
new customers we also saw a 1% 
increase in orders from our established 
database and a 2% increase in the 
amount spent by each customer. We 
entered the new financial year with an 
active database of 6.4m customers, 
who are predominantly female with an 
average age of 57 . 
The number of those customers who 
had placed an order in the last year 
was up by 6%, a key indicator of 
future growth.

Under 50 Customer Group
The brands in this customer segment 
continue to be the main contributors 
to the group’s overall revenue growth.
Simply Be is the largest brand in 
this segment with sales in excess of 
£122m and growth of 14% across all 
channels and geographies. It has the 
most fashion-conscious customers 
and our expertise is in recognising 
the latest trends and designing 
our clothing range to look good on 
customers whether they are size 
14 or size 32. On average Simply Be’s 
customers are visiting the website 
every few days looking for new lines.
Jacamo is targeted at the brand-
conscious thirty-something male 
who wants the convenience of online 
shopping and branded clothing in 
their size, and identifies with the fun-
loving image of the brand, exemplified 
by Freddie Flintoff as our brand 
ambassador. This continues to be 
our fastest growing brand with sales 
up by 36%.
Fashion World’s customers, who 
are primarily from lower socio-
demographic groups, have had a 
tough time in the last few years but a  Group revenue

revamp of the product range, a more 
contemporary feel to the catalogue 
and website and the use of celebrities 
such as Claire Sweeney and Claire 
Richards to promote the brand, have 
resulted in revenue growth of over 4%.
Figleaves, the leading online lingerie 
brand, has seen strong growth in 
profitability, managing its cost base 
extremely well on revenues which 
were slightly up.
50 Plus Customer Group
The 50 plus customer group has had 
a difficult time during the recession 
but there were signs of improvement 
in the second half, when revenue grew 
by 3%, resulting in a positive sales 
outcome for the year as a whole.
The strongest growth in this segment 
came from House of Bath, which 
sells an eclectic range of items for the 
home and garden, where revenue 
grew by 34%, built on very successful 
recruitment campaigns. There was 
also strong growth from Marisota 
which targets customers in their early 
50’s with a catalogue and website 
offering fitting solutions for clothing 
and footwear. The menswear brands, 
High & Mighty and Premier Man, saw 
modest growth. Our largest brand, 
JD Williams and its associated titles, 
which supply a wide range of products 
to customers who are typically retired, 
saw revenue fall by 5%, partly due to 
reductions in the recruitment budget in 
previous seasons. Julipa, focussed on 
our most traditional customers, 
had flat sales year on year.

In light of the lacklustre economy 
and the adverse weather conditions 
throughout most of last year it is 
pleasing that we have managed 
to grow revenue in all four product 
categories.
Ladieswear revenue grew by 1%. 
The global supply chain has settled 
down after the turbulent conditions in 
2011 and this has helped us to have 
better balanced stock levels, resulting 
in higher full margin sales but fewer 
discounted sales. The impact of a 
very wet summer followed by a cold 
start to 2013 depressed sales but in 
between we had strong sales from 
our autumn ranges. We exploited our 
online capabilities to create fashion 
stories and capsule ranges to reflect 
the latest trends. In contrast the sales 
of occasionwear and higher priced 
garments were disappointing.
Footwear sales were up by 5% with 
the strongest growth from Viva La 
Diva, our online footwear portal, and 
men’s footwear. The weather patterns 
resulted in strong boot sales but weak 
sandal sales. 
Menswear continued its strong growth 
as it has done for each of the last 5 
years, and broke through the £100m 
barrier for the first time. 
The use of Freddie Flintoff as a 
celebrity ambassador for Jacamo, 
including strong sales from his own 
range, contributed to the growth of 
younger menswear.
Home and gift sales had an excellent 
year with growth of 15%. Our strategy 
across all product groups was to 
sharpen our price points on easily 
comparable lines and this had the 
greatest effect on the home and gift 
revenue. In addition we have been 
using our supplier integration portal 
to significantly increase the number of 
lines available online with the product 
being despatched directly from the 
supplier. The aggregate impact of 
these changes was to drive much 
higher volumes at a lower rate of 
gross margin with a net benefit in 
terms of cash contribution. Within this 
category there were some excellent 
performances from electrical, furniture, 
homewares, toys and gifts.
Multi-channel
Online sales have increased as a 
proportion of our home shopping 
revenues by five percentage points 
or more for each of the last 8 years. 
Last year the proportion rose from 
50% to 55% with online revenue 
rising by 15% to £424m, maintaining 
our position in the top division of 
internet retailers. The growth of 
online purchasing is partly down to 
global acceptance of digital media by 
consumers and we aim to accelerate 
this trend with our customers as it 
delivers increased revenue and lower 
operating costs. To this end we now  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 12

recruit most customers through online 
campaigns, sponsoring approximately 
five million key words and phrases 
through online search engines coupled 
with sophisticated optimisation 
techniques. We also link our direct 
response television campaigns and 
our newspaper advertisements into 
our websites. We continue to expand 
the number of internet exclusive 
product lines and last year had 84,000 
stock options which were never 
featured in a catalogue generating 
an incremental £42m of revenue. 
Last year saw an explosion in mobile 
access to the internet through the 
burgeoning sales of smartphones and 
tablet computers. We quickly adapted 
all our websites to be “mobile friendly” 
and by the year end 26% of all online 
sessions were being accessed from 
mobile devices, which accounted for 
23% of the value of sales transacted. 
There is much evidence that the 
older consumer is adapting to tablet 
computers at a fast rate which will help 
to accelerate the switch from paper to 
digital media in the coming years.
The ideal scenario for the customer 
is to be able to switch seamlessly 
between channels without noticing 
any variation in the branding or service 
offer. As an example we saw the 
number of inbound calls to our contact 
centre decline by 9% but by offering 
the same affinity products to our 
telephone orderers as we do to our 
online customers we increased 
our add-on sales by £15m.
To be truly multi-channel requires a 
store portfolio and we are testing this 
concept for our younger brands in 
targeted locations. During the year 
we opened a further five Simply Be 
stores and in addition we utilised 
some of the space in three of the 
stores for the Jacamo menswear 
range, which has done exceptionally 
well. Total revenue from the Simply 
Be/Jacamo stores was £4.6m with 
start-up losses of £2.2m. We are 
in the process of evaluating the 
incrementality of these sales, the 
positive halo effect on online sales 
and the projected return on capital 
achievable. Assuming this evaluation 
is positive we will look to open a  
limited number of stores in high 
footfall locations.
Our High & Mighty stores had revenue 
of over £9m, up by 5% despite tough 
trading conditions in many of the 
locations where they are trading. 
However more promotional activity 
resulted in a loss of £0.7m compared 
with our aspiration to reach breakeven.
International
Simply Be and Figleaves allow 
international orders to be placed 
on their websites from many parts 
of the world, but our overseas 
marketing is focussed on USA, Ireland 
and Germany. International sales 
amounted to £30.2m with losses of 
£1.9m (2012, £1.5m). Simply Be’s sales 
in the USA grew by 75% to £8.4m with 
an acceleration in the second half. We 
are still testing a variety of marketing 
and recruitment techniques, and have 
found that the Marisota product range, 
which is slightly less fashionable than 
Simply Be, yields better results from 
direct mail recruitment. Consequently 
we will launch a dedicated Marisota 
website in April 2013 as well as one for 
Jacamo menswear.
Our marketing expenditure in Germany 
has been significantly reduced and 
focussed wholly online. Whilst this has 
reduced revenue by 38% to £2.2m 
it has reduced losses and gives an 
expectation of breakeven next year.
Oxendales is our primary brand in 
Ireland, where we have traded for 
many years. The continuing economic 
woes have seen a decline in both sales 
and profits since the recession hit, and 
last year revenues fell a further 15% to 
£14.2m and operating profit was down 
49% to £1.7m.
Figleaves derives 22% of its total 
revenue of £24.7m from overseas, 
with the USA the main market, and 
has ambitions to grow sales further 
in this region.
Gross Margin and Credit
The rate of gross margin was level 
with the previous year at 53.0%. 
However this masks a 1.6% increase 
in the rate of gross margin in the 
second half to offset an equivalent 
reduction in the first half. There have 
been three key features which shaped 
the gross margin. The “Amazing Value” 
lines throughout the various product 
categories successfully traded gross 
margin rate for volume growth, but this 
was more than offset by a significant 
reduction in the level of product and 
marketing discounts compared with 
the high level in the second half of 
2011/12 when we had excess levels 
of stock to clear. The ratio of bad

debts to sales rose by 0.4% to 8.1% 
due to the high level of customer 
recruitment. The underlying level 
of arrears and write-offs was level 
with the prior year and the increase 
in the ratio is wholly due to this 
customer mix. 
The services revenue associated with 
our credit accounts rose by 6.1% to 
£226.9m, 29% of our total revenue.
Overheads
A 5% increase in average item values 
helped contain the rise in distribution 
costs to 3.9%. To build up the 
customer database we invested an 
extra £6m in recruitment campaigns, 
offset by a £2.5m reduction in 
catalogue costs through our contact 
optimisation programme. In addition 
we had invested further to support 
our strategic initiatives to drive 
international revenue and develop 
the stores channel.
Customer Service
We are continually looking to improve 
the customer service experience. 
During the last twelve months we 
have made more of the product range 
available for next day delivery and 
moved the cut-off time from 2pm to 
6pm. We have improved the online 
self-service “My Account” facility 
and the automated service emails 
are keeping the customers’ better 
informed and generating revenue. 
The end result has been a reduction 
in the number of enquiries and claims 
from our customers, keeping us in the 
top quartile for service amongst our 
peer group.
Current Trading and Outlook
We have made good progress with 
our strategic plan in the last year but 
there are still many opportunities to 
develop in the new financial year. 
The trading processes and organisation 
have been revamped to recognise the 
pre-eminence of the online channel 
and also to strengthen the focus 
on our key brands, both from 
product development and marketing 
perspectives. We will offer more choice 
in payment options to attract those 
customers who do not wish to open 
a credit account. The transition from 
paper contacts to online communication 
will be managed carefully to drive sales 
and reduce costs. The higher level of 
customer recruitment investment will be 
maintained. Strong revenue increases 
are anticipated from our operations in 
the United States, and from our Simply 
Be/Jacamo stores, and we expect 
lower levels of operating losses as these 
operations develop.
Revenue in the first 7 weeks of the 
new financial year is up by 6.3% 
and by 6. 1% on a like-for-like basis. 
The strength of our customer base 
is the most positive influence in 
delivering this rate of growth which 
has been achieved despite the cold 
spell in March which has significantly 
impacted the sales of ladies summer 
clothing. However sales of footwear 
and menswear have been positive and 
home and gift has continued its strong 
performance. This product mix has 
impacted the achieved rate of gross 
margin so far but we hope that we 
will enjoy better weather than the wet 
summer of 2012 to redress this issue.
Change of Chief Executive
This is my last Chief Executive’s report 
before starting to hand over to Angela 
Spindler from 1 July 2013. I have had a 
hugely enjoyable career with N Brown 
Group in two spells totalling 25 years, 
the last 11 years as chief executive, 
and I must especially thank David 
Alliance and Jim Martin for both these 
opportunities. It is almost impossible 
to believe that the business I joined 
with sales of £42m in 1985 could 
deliver these results in 2013. The 
talent, enthusiasm and dedication of 
everyone in the group has delivered 
this long-term transformation and 
I sincerely thank everyone for their 
contribution.
The business is in good shape 
today with a strong management 
team and I firmly believe that the 
group has an excellent strategic 
position with an exciting future 
ahead of it. I offer Angela my full 
support and best wishes to realise 
this potential and I am sure the group 
will continue to prosper under Andrew 
Higginson’s and Angela’s guidance.

 Centrica plc report 2003 01
Chairmanâ€™ s statement
Our continued focus on understanding and providing
what our customers want has helped us to achieve
growth in both revenues and earnings.
Centrica has made steady
progress during 2003 against a
backdrop of uncertain economic
conditions, rising energy prices
and challenging regulatory
issues in some of our markets.
Our continued focus on
understanding and providing
what our customers want, and
our skill in managing the risks of
sourcing the energy to meet their
needs, have helped us to achieve
growth to record levels in both
revenues and earnings.
The development of competitive
markets is important for our
strategy . In 2003 we saw a
continuing commitment to a 
fully transparent energy market
in Britain, with new legislation to
introduce a competitive electricity
trading system in Scotland. In
Europe, the new energy directives
are now in place, and we look
forward to the establishment of 
a properly competitive market.
The regulatory environment in
North America remains varied,
but overall we have continued 
to prosper in our chosen
markets. There has been 
further progress in improving 
the competitive nature of the 
UK telecommunications market,
but there is some way to go
before a level playing field is
firmly established.
In 2003 there were sharp rises 
in UK wholesale prices in both
gas and electricity despite lower
than average consumption due
to warmer weather . The long
term outlook for gas supply in
the UK is improving, with an
increasing diversity of supply
and further links between the 
UK and mainland Europe. It
seems inevitable, however , 
that the increasing costs of
complying with the UK and EU
regulations designed to deliver 
a low carbon economy will
create upward pressure on
consumer electricity prices.
Dividend
The board of directors is
proposing a final dividend of 
3.7 pence per share to be paid 
in June 2004. This means that,
when combined with the interim
dividend of 1.7 pence per share
paid in November 2003, the 
total dividend for 2003 will be 
5.4 pence per share. This total
per share increase of 35%
reflects our continuing
confidence in the outlook for
both cash flow and earnings 
in the medium term.
The board of directors
Sir Brian Shaw retired in May
2003 and we are most grateful
for the part he played in the
development of Centrica. 
It is fitting that he continues to
chair the AA Motoring T rust, an
independent charity supported
by Centrica. Mike Alexander ,
who made a considerable
contribution to the success 
of Centrica, retired from the
company in February 2003. In
December , my own retirement
was announced and my
successor , Roger Carr , subject
to re-election to the board, will
be taking over as chairman at 
the end of the annual general
meeting (AGM) in May .
The future
Centrica has made enormous
progress over the past seven
years, rising from the bottom 
half of the FTSE 100 Index 
to position itself in the top 30
companies in the UK; growing
from our British Gas base
through the acquisition of 
the AA, the movement into
telecommunications and
international expansion. 
I am delighted that we have
established a solid platform 
from which continued delivery 
of our strategy will produce
strong medium term growth.
The commitment and dedication
of our employees have ensured
that 2003 has been another very
successful year for the group
and I would like to thank them 
all for their hard work. I am
confident that, with the 
excellent management team 
led by Sir Roy Gardner , along
with the experience brought 
by Roger Carr as the new
chairman, and the collective
efforts of all our employees, 
the company will continue 
to go from strength to strength.
The commitment and
dedication of our
employees have
ensured that 2003 has
been a very successful
year for the group.

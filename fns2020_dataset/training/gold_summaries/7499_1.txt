HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Business review
Our strategy is to be the leading 
provider of home assistance and 
appliance warranties to homeowners 
in the UK, Europe and US by offering 
customers annual membership. 
We deliver this strategy through 
leveraging our product development 
knowledge, direct consumer 
marketing expertise, network 
management and service delivery 
capabilities combined with long-
term relationships with business 
partners including utilities, appliance 
manufacturers, retailers and financial 
services companies. 
The results we are announcing 
today show strong progress in our 
worldwide membership businesses 
and reinforce our strategy to focus 
exclusively on policy membership.
Our businesses
We now have access to 56m 
households globally, of which 32m are 
outside the UK. We sold 2.7m gross 
new policies in the year and increased 
total policies by 14% to 9.2m (2008: 
8.1m).
UK Membership
Our UK business now provides cover 
for anything that goes wrong in the 
home that is not covered by household 
insurance such as pipes and wires, 
furniture and appliances. 
UK Membership metrics are shown on 
page 15.
Revenue decreased by 3% to £228.2m 
(2008: £236.5m) and operating 
profit* increased by 14% to £87.2m 
(2008: £76.3m). We signed a new 
underwriting agreement in September 
2007 with Inter Partner Assistance 
whereby from 1 October 2007 they 
took the full risk on new policy sales 
and we ceased reinsuring 49% of the 
risk through our captive insurer. The 
change in underwriting arrangements 
has reduced the reported revenue 
for UK Membership in the year and 
the phasing of profits between the 
first and second halves of the year. 
Excluding the impact of changes in 
underwriting arrangements, revenue 
in UK Membership grew by 14%. 
The business achieved gross new 
policy sales of 1.83m (2008: 1.68m) 
with retention rates remaining high 
at 83% (2008: 85%). We continued our 
successful strategy of increasing value 
per customer through the continued 
success of Combined Policies which 
now represents 14% (2008: 8%) of our 
customers with income per customer 
growing 18% to £59. 
Chief Executive’s review
Our vision is to be the first place 
people turn to when it comes to fixing, 
maintaining and looking after the 
home, recognising the problem that 
homeowners have throughout the world 
in finding a reliable tradesman and 
paying the repair bill in the event of a 
home emergency.

HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
During the year, we reorganised 
our businesses in the UK with those 
areas of the network dedicated to 
servicing our UK policy members 
moving from Emergency Services 
into UK Membership. The transfer 
of our plumbing, electrics, gas and 
other subcontract networks that 
support our policy customers, as well 
as our network of directly employed 
plumbers, has enabled us to deliver 
an improved end-to-end service for 
our UK policy customers, thereby 
replicating the highly successful 
integrated model we deploy in our 
international operations. 
We have continued to develop 
the network that supports our 
policy business by increasing the 
proportion of jobs carried out by our 
own plumbers, from 32% to 47% in 
the year. We have also completed 
the rollout of franchising across our 
Electrics network and introduced new 
technology to improve the efficiency 
and performance of our directly 
employed engineers in the field.
Our Manufacturer Warranties 
business has had another successful 
year with total polices growing 47% 
to 331,000. We also signed up new 
partners including Aqualisa, Lec, 
Maytag, Sanyo and Smeg taking the 
total number of partners to 18 across 
the boiler, shower, white and brown 
goods sectors. 
This business not only provides a 
significant and growing contribution 
to Group performance but also an 
excellent opportunity to cross-sell 
our core utility products to these 
customers. 
As announced at our interim results, 
the difficult retail environment has 
impacted our retail warranties 
business with revenue falling by £6m 
year-on-year. Warranties sold on 
behalf of retailers are not recognised 
in our customer or policy numbers 
and represent a relatively small 
contribution to UK Membership 
profit, with limited exposure to further 
changes in the retail sector. 
In October 2008, we launched a 
pilot in the West Midlands of a new 
range of ‘One Contact’ services 
aimed at attracting new customers 
through offering access, via our UK 
Membership network, to a range of 
home repair trades on a ‘pay-on-use’ 
basis. The response to the pilot has 
been encouraging and the next phase 
of One Contact is to prove that we 
can successfully convert a one-off job 
customer into an annual member with 
a number of tests in progress.
In March, we launched two new 
products. Firstly, home assistance 
cover for landlords providing access to 
an additional 12% of the UK housing 
market. Secondly, cover for flats 
ranging from entry-level plumbing 
cover through to a combined package 
including an annual boiler service and 
central heating inspection.

We now have access 
to 56m households

are outside the UK.

Continental Europe
Our European business has had 
another very good year with operating 
profit* increasing by 204% to £5.3m 
(2008: £1.8m), 143% in local currency. 
We now have access to 22.7m 
households in Europe and 1.6m 
policies with a combined penetration 
of 5%. Doméo, our French joint 
venture with Veolia, has grown total 
(100%) operating profit* by 106% to 
£14.0m (2008: £6.8m). The operating 
profit* result of £5.3m comprises 
£4.8m contribution from our share 
in the French joint venture, a £0.1m 
contribution from Spain, with profits 
from Reparalia being used to invest in 
building our Spanish policy business 
and £0.4m contribution from Belgium.
Our focus this financial year is to 
continue European development 
through broadening our product 
range and building on the success 
we have had in the UK in our 
Manufacturer Warranties business 
by expanding this important part of 
our membership model alongside our 
utility-branded policies. We will also 
continue to explore opportunities and 
identify potential partners to expand 
our membership model into new 
European territories.
France
The total number of policies in our 
French joint venture, Doméo, has 
increased by 33% in the year to 1.57m 
(2008: 1.18m). Gross new policy sales 
in the year have increased to 0.55m 
(2008: 0.44m) and the retention rate 
has remained high at 88% (2008: 
89%). During the year we have also 
increased the number of affinity 
partner households (excluding 
apartments) by 1.0m to 13.5m. 
Metrics for the French business are 
shown on page 15.
The principal policies offered by 
Doméo include plumbing and drains, 
water supply pipe, water loss, electrics 
cover, gas supply pipe and boiler 
cover. Doméo has grown its policy 
book across all categories through 
a combination of customer growth 
and the sale of additional policies to 
existing customers with policies per 
customer increasing from 2.1 to 2.3. 
This, combined with a more attractive 
underwriting deal completed in the 
year, resulted in a 55% increase 
in revenue (82% in GBP) and 65% 
increase in operating profit* in local 
currency (106% in GBP). 
In the year, we recruited a new 
Managing Director to lead our French 
business whose focus, along with 
the expanded business development 
team, will be on developing new 
products and affinity partnerships 
as the business moves into the next 
stage of its development. 
We successfully tested the sale of 
policies via new channels including 
email and the internet and we signed 
agreements with new affinity partners 
Vialis and Gaz Electricité de Grenoble.
Our European business has had another 
very good year with operating profit* 
increasing by 204% to £5.3m 15

Spain
We are pleased with the strong 
performance of Reparalia which 
continues to meet our expectations 
from when we acquired the business 
in August 2007 and is an integral 
part of our plans to build a policy 
business in Spain. Reparalia has been 
instrumental in signing agreements 
with our Spanish affinity partners and 
we firmly believe that this acquisition 
provides the preferred entry model 
into new markets.
We have made progress in 
establishing a policy business which 
now has 47,700 policies following 
an encouraging start to full scale 
marketing with Endesa. We recently 
signed twelve month test marketing 
agreements with two water 
companies, Agbar and Acciona and 
results from the initial tests have been 
positive.
In the year we launched a franchise 
offering to Reparalia subcontractors in 
Madrid and Barcelona. We believe this 
is an effective and cost efficient way 
of raising awareness of the Reparalia 
brand, reinforcing our relationships 
with our subcontractor network and 
helping support the development of 
the Spanish policy business.
With an encouraging start to full 
scale marketing, scope to increase 
penetration of Endesa customers and 
the potential to sign up long-term 
agreements with other partners, 
Spain is well positioned for future 
growth.
Belgium
In December 2008 we acquired SPT, 
Belgium’s leading claims handling and 
subcontract repair network business. 
Our focus this year will be to develop a 
membership business by using SPT as 
a platform to secure long-term affinity 
partnerships with utilities in Belgium 
and the Netherlands. 
United States of America
The US has had another strong year 
generating an increase in revenue 
in local currency of 58% (GBP 96%) 
and an operating profit* in the 
second half. The total number of 
policies has increased by 0.19m to 
0.55m, an increase of 52% driven by 
continued high levels of gross new 
policy sales of 0.25m (2008: 0.18m) 
and an increase in customer numbers 
of 50%. The retention rate has also 
increased to 80% (2008: 78%) as a 
result of improved retention initiatives 
and moving a greater proportion of 
customers to pay for their membership 
via their utility bill. 
Metrics for the US business are shown 
on page 15.
Policy growth in the US has been 
driven by strong take-up rates with our 
water company partners in particular 
California Water and Louisville 
Water and with Progress Energy. 
Initial results from marketing our 
Exterior Electrics policy to First Energy 
customers, which covers repairs to 
the section of external electric line 
or underground cable for which the 
customer has legal responsibility, have 
also been encouraging.
The US has had another strong year 
generating an increase in revenue in local 
currency of 58% 17
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009
We are also pleased to announce 
the signing of a 10-year marketing 
agreement with SEMCO Energy Gas 
Company, a gas utility based in 
Michigan, which will provide access 
to an additional 250,000 households 
and includes the acquisition of 
26,300 policies which, together 
with the agreement with Utilities 
Inc announced in January and the 
opening up of additional territories 
with existing affinity partners, has 
increased US marketable households 
in the year by 0.8m to 9.4m.
We continue to develop our pipeline of 
affinity partner prospects and remain 
focused on expanding our footprint in 
the US to reach our goal of more than 
20m marketable households in the 
medium term.
With the US now profitable on an 
ongoing basis we look forward to 
delivering another year of profit 
growth this financial year and 
increasing the contribution of the US to 
the business overall.
UK Emergency Services
As previously announced, it has been 
a difficult year for our UK Emergency 
Services business which continues 
to operate in challenging market 
conditions, with lower volumes and 
pricing pressure. The lower volumes 
together with £41m of flood-related 
work in the prior year have resulted 
in revenue falling by 20% to £233.6m 
(2008: £291.7m). The completion of 
a significant proportion of larger, 
more complex, lower margin jobs, 
particularly within our Buildings 
business has also impacted margin 
progression in the year with operating 
margin* falling from 5.2% to 3.4% 
and operating profit* by 47% to 
£8.0m (2008: £15.1m). On the back 
of the ongoing tough operating 
environment we have taken the 
difficult but necessary decision to 
exit the business and write-down the 
value of these assets resulting in an 
impairment charge of £97m.
Summary
We are pleased to report a year of 
significant progress for HomeServe 
and another set of strong results for 
our membership businesses. The 
market opportunities for our three 
membership businesses are very 
exciting and we are confident that 
each of them will continue to deliver 
strong growth over the coming years. 
The decision to exit our UK Emergency 
Services business will significantly 
simplify the Group and allow us to 
focus exclusively on maximising 
the potential of our membership 
businesses, both in existing markets 
and through further international 
expansion.

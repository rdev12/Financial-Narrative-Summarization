New measures
During the year, new measures were introduced for guest 
satisfaction, complaints and the ‘right licensee, right concept, 
right execution’ measure in the Leased estate. As such there 
is no historic data for these measures; however they are 
considered to be important measures for monitoring the 
health of the business in future years.
 > Guest satisfaction – 84.8%
 > Complaints – 0.65 per 1,000 covers and 1.46 per 10,000 drinks
 > Right licensee, right concept, right execution – 74%
Our target is to achieve a guest satisfaction score of 90%. 
We do not set specific targets for complaints or ‘right licensee, 
right concept, right execution’ but we aim to continually improve 
on these metrics.

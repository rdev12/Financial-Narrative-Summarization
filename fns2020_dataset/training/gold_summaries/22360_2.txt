Circle Property Plc 
Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the period 4 December 2015 to 31 March 2016
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
 ʱ The letting of the entire first floor of K1 in Milton Keynes to Trafficmaster 
enabled us to proceed with the refurbishment of K2 in the knowledge that 
K1 was fully let. Those works are now complete and we are pleased that K2 is 
attracting considerable interest. We are drawing-in tenants from competing local 
developments who appreciate our high specification and thoughtfully planted 
landscaped grounds with ample car parking.
 
 ʱ In Birmingham, we are already on site and working through our rolling 
refurbishment of 36 Great Charles Street retaining existing tenants and extending 
leases to meet tenants requirements. The entrance is being enlarged and all floors 
are being refurbished in “media-style” with exposed ceiling services and open 
plan yet flexible floor plates.
 ʱ At Somerset House in Temple Street Birmingham we are securing pre-lets on 
the two Ground Floor restaurants for which planning permission has now been 
granted. The strip out is underway and will be followed by a refurbishment of the 
upper floors completing in Spring 2017.

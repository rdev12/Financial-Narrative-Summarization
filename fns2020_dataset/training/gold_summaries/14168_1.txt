 OVERVIEW FOR THE 12 MONTHS
I am pleased to announce Shed Media’s final results covering the 12 months to 31 December 2008.
During the period, adjusted operating profit increased to £14.5m from £9m up 61% on a like for like basis
3
(2007 16 months: £11m). 
The Group delivered 215 hours of programming, up from 209 in the 16 months to 31 December 2007, of
which 29 hours was drama and 186 was factual. Programmes included new prime-time BBC drama Hope
Springs, Waterloo Road series four, New Tricks series five, Who Do You Think You Are? series six and Supernanny
US series five.
Over the past twelve months, the breadth of Shed Media’s programming has grown substantially. We are
now delivering quality prime-time drama, factual entertainment, documentary, current affairs, children’s,
and daytime programmes for 21 different broadcasters. The year also saw our first foray into feature
documentaries with the production of Wall to Wall’s Man on Wire, which has gone on to win numerous
awards, including an Oscar and a BAFTA. Twenty Twenty’s award winning factual programme, The Choir,
also picked up an RTS for Best Constructed Factual Series and an award for best factual programme at the
industry Broadcast Awards.
Business in the US has grown strongly with 64 hours delivered (compared to 32 in 2007) and the Group
has delivered on its stated aim of leveraging acquired companies’ product into the US market. Both
Twenty Twenty and Wall to Wall won US commissions for UK formats, World’s Strictest Parents and Who Do
You Think You Are?, which are currently being produced out of our US office. 
Shed Media’s in-house distribution arm, Outright Distribution, has performed well, successfully distributing
Shed Media content and growing its third party business. Revenue from the Group’s IP exploitation
accounted for 44% of gross profit. The UK is the world leader in exploiting format rights and Outright
Distribution represents an increasingly strong, highly cash generative and profitable part of Shed Media’s
business. As we move forward we will continue to concentrate our efforts on growing and developing this
very high quality earnings stream both through the rapid expansion of our own library and attracting more
third party content.
UK Business
Despite the challenging UK environment, Shed Media has delivered high-quality content for all terrestrial
broadcasters and several digital channels.
Shed Productions delivered a new prime-time drama Hope Springs (8 x 60’) and Waterloo Road (20 x 60’) for
BBC One. 
Wall to Wall delivered New Tricks series five (8 x 60’) and series six of ratings winner Who Do You Think You
Are? (5 x 60’) both for BBC One. New Tricks series six (8 x 60’) is currently in production. 
Ricochet’s output included Dangerous Jobs for Girls (4 x 60’) for Channel 4, Cowboy Builders (6 x 60’) for Five,
Extreme Dreams (20 x 30’) for BBC Two and Blood Sweat and T-Shirts (4 x 60’) for BBC Three.
Twenty Twenty’s new strand; World’s Strictest Parents (6 x 60’), received the highest ever ratings for a
factual series on BBC Three. Other programmes delivered during the period included Almost Perfect Guide
to Life for BBC Two (5 x 30’) and the Sorcerer’s Apprentice (40 x 30’) for BBC One.
Since the year end, major re-commissions for delivery in 2009 include a fifth series of Shed Productions’
Waterloo Road (20 x 60’).

broadcasters. 
Outlook
Three months into our current financial year and the Group has secured 61% of its production revenue
target and over 50% of its IP target. The US presents a significant area of growth for the Group with 62%
of the revenue target already achieved. IP revenue will continue to perform strongly with Outright’s
expanding library of Group and third party content.
The Group had a good 2008 and we’ve started 2009 strongly. As ever our talented and experienced team
will be working hard to create and produce the new brands of the future.

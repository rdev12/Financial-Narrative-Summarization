This has been a period 
of tremendous progress 
for the Company. 
We have run our operations at over 90% 
load factor and nearly trebled our available 
capacity from 270 MW to 750 MW. In so 
doing, we have also established a 
multi-location business, widened our core 
skills in areas such as transmission line 
construction, delivered an increase of over 
20% in profitability and continued to 
actively manage our gearing and 
operational risk profile. Over the last three 
years, as we increased from 110 MW to 
270 MW operating capacity, our local 
currency earnings have grown by over 
350%. With a full 750 MW constructed and 
further low risk projects being evaluated, 
we intend to create further value for 
shareholders. 
A quantum leap forward to 750 MW 
constructed assets 
In the last few weeks, the Group has 
completed the construction of its biggest 
projects – the 180 MW Chennai IV and 
the 2x150 MW Gujarat, bringing our total 
constructed assets to 750 MW. With one 
of the 150 MW units in Gujarat awaiting 
transmission lines from the state, we 
currently have 600 MW of operational 
assets across two states. 
The 180 MW Chennai unit, constructed 
on time and within budget, was built using 
key equipment from Europe, a first for the 
Group, and increases the Chennai plant’s 
capacity to 414 MW. 
The new units at Chennai and Gujarat 
boast the same flexible fuel design features 
as our existing Chennai plant.
At the 300 MW Gujarat site, our 
development work has been completed. 
We continue to work with the state 
transmission company on constructing the 
multi-circuit evacuation line which is now 
approximately two-thirds complete. In the 
meantime, one 150 MW unit has already 
been operating at an average load factor of 
approximately 47% since commissioning 
in April, ahead of our expectations. This 
unit uses the newly constructed interim 
transmission line and we continue to 
expect both units of the plant to achieve 
normal commercial operations in around 
September 2015. 
I am extremely proud of the team’s 
achievement in building two sizeable 
projects concurrently in different locations 
to such a high standard. 
Operations continue to endorse our 
business model 
In addition to the substantial growth in 
capacity, we achieved continued strong 
operational performance that saw load 
factors averaging 91% across our portfolio 
of three units that were commercially active 
for the full financial year at Chennai. This 
is well ahead of the national average and 
is reflective of our flexible procurement 
policy that once again helped to ensure 
we experienced no lack of fuel (coal). 
We continued to perform consistently well 
against regulated tariff levels for industrial 
users – our average tariff for the year rising 
slightly to Rs 5.71 per kWh. These factors 
combined to deliver Rupee revenues that 
were higher than last year in spite of a 
major planned maintenance shutdown 
of our flagship unit, Chennai I. Our robust 
top line thus continued to benefit from 
the successful implementation of our 
business model.

Rupee costs have held steady
As much of our coal purchases are 
imported, unit costs of generation are 
affected by currency fluctuation between 
the US Dollar and the Indian Rupee. 
Whilst we have continued to enter into 
a mix of fixed and variable price coal 
contracts of varying durations, the Rupee 
has been far less volatile against the US 
Dollar than in previous years. Any savings 
generated as a result of coal prices were 
largely offset by a rise in logistics costs 
and coal cess. Around 68% of our coal 
purchases were imported. 
Opportunities taken to manage risk 
One of the advantages of our model is that 
we retain the flexibility to take opportunities 
that benefit our risk-reward profile. For 
instance, in October 2014 the Group 
secured power sales contracts until 
September 2015 with TANGEDCO for 
around two-thirds of the output from the 
Chennai plant at attractive fixed rates. 
Similarly, the Long Term Variable Tariff 
arrangement entered into in January 2014 
for 74 MW continues until 2029 and 
delivered an average tariff this year of  
Rs 5.79 per kWh. This is in addition to the 
55 MW reserved by us at Chennai for sales 
direct to Group captive customers at an 
average tariff of over Rs 6 per kWh since 
December 2014.
Our joint venture with Noble, entered into 
in August 2014 for a Long Term Freight 
Arrangement, is expected to provide 
security over our cost and availability of 
international freight for around half of our 
existing operations from 2017, deploying 
the right management skills to deliver 
those savings. Under the arrangement,  
the Company has joint ownership of two 
new 64,000 tonnes cargo vessels and 
gives OPG the ability to use 1.5 Mt of 
freight capacity per annum.
I believe our being able to take such 
opportunities as they arise helps us 
to establish a continually more 
robust business. 
Maintaining our focus on balance 
sheet management 
During the year we invested £102m 
on completing our capital projects and 
our borrowings were £261m at 31 March 
2015. This represents gearing of 59% 
which remains in line with expectations. 
Our repayments remain on schedule and 
our borrowing facilities have an average 
outstanding duration of approximately nine 
years versus our enlarged asset portfolio 
that is being depreciated over 35–40 
years. During the year, our domestic credit 
rating was raised to ‘A-’ and in the last  
few weeks it has been raised again to  
‘A’. In addition, as a result of base rate 
reductions, we have already seen 0.5%  
cut from our local borrowing cost which 
equate to annualised pre-tax savings of 
over £1m.  OPG Power Ventures Plc

India’s economic revival continues 
and we will continue to build a robust 
business for the long term
Some developments are being prioritised 
by the new Government in pushing 
ahead with business-focused legislation, 
such as that relating to land acquisition for 
infrastructure projects, mining and minerals, 
and to the transparency of administrative 
processes. The Government is starting 
to lead the way on investment in certain 
crucial sectors including the power sector. 
Delivering ‘Power for All by 2020’ and 
anticipated amendments to the Electricity 
Act 2003 should assist in making 
investment more attractive but I believe 
that the sheer enormity of the task to 
balance electricity supply and demand 
makes it one of the country’s greatest 
challenges. We expect to play our part by 
continuing to build and grow a profitable 
and robust business that meets the 
demands of our customers. 
Meeting demand, maintaining 
momentum
With customers seeking to source their 
energy needs through a mixture of thermal 
and renewable power, the Board will 
endeavour to ensure that OPG’s growth in 
the future reflects that dynamic. We have 
kept an active watch on the renewable 
power space and are being measured 
about the timing of our entry into 
renewables as the aforementioned 
demand trend in India coupled with 
improving wind and solar technologies 
and falling equipment prices make it 
increasingly attractive to us. 
We are evaluating in detail new projects, 
including modular wind and solar projects 
across four states in India. I believe that the 
development of renewables capacity will 
make our business even more robust with 
a yet wider combination of technologies, 
locations and potential customers. The 
evaluation of these future projects will 
include analysis of the optimum funding 
structure, given the forecast internal cash 
generation of the Company alongside 
the Board’s intention to initiate a dividend 
which remains unchanged and is to be 
embedded within our proposed long-
term management incentive scheme. 
Our current view is that projects to be 
pursued are those that can be funded 
from internally generated capital and debt. 
At this time of positioning the Company 
for the next stage of its development, the 
Board recognises that the Group currently 
has no long-term incentive plan in place. 
As such, the Group’s Remuneration 
Committee believes that the introduction of 
an incentive scheme is appropriate as the 
Board targets future growth. The scheme’s 
currently proposed metrics, described in 
more detail after the financial review, are 
to be designed to sit alongside the Group’s 
strategy with vesting occurring upon value 
creation for shareholders.

To achieve our targets we need 
to maintain leadership in health 
and safety and responsible 
corporate citizenship 
We are a growing team of around 400 
and I’m pleased to report that at both 
Chennai and Gujarat, continuous training 
programmes in safety management are 
established for both OPG and contractor 
staff. Targets have been introduced to 
enable year-on-year improvements and 
these are monitored by the Company’s 
Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee. To drive the improvement 
programmes, the Company has adopted 
a Policy of Zero Harm at both sites. 
We continue to invest in our community 
initiatives in both Gujarat and Tamil Nadu 
building sanitation facilities and providing 
medical outreach and educational 
assistance to over 2,500 friends of OPG. 
Summary 
First and foremost, a big thank you to 
our team, whose unrelenting efforts 
have created our business. Similarly my 
gratitude goes to all of our partners and 
stakeholders over the last several years 
and of course to the Board for their 
support and guidance. 
I’m delighted by our exceptional progress. 
As our story starts to reveal itself more 
fully in the form of significant cash flows 
from our new plants, I’m more confident 
than ever of the Group’s ability to deliver 
further and increasing long-term value. 
Our Company continues to progress 
towards a new level of robustness defined 
by its increasing scale, diversity and ability 
to secure profitable growth.

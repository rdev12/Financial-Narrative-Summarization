 Chief Executive Officer’s introduction 
and business model
Establishing closer integration 
of healthcare systems.
“ The NHS’ Five-Year Forward View strategy 
document expressly states its commitment 
to fully interoperable electronic health records 
so that patients’ records are largely paperless, 
available to clinicians wherever treatment is 
provided, and can be accessed by patients. 
As custodians of well over 40 million such 
records, across every major area of healthcare, 
we remain uniquely placed to help provide 
faster, better and cheaper healthcare through 
connected software and services.”
Vision 
“ To support longer and healthier lives for everyone by providing integrated, 
excellent and innovative healthcare IT for patients and those involved in their care”

Our key differentiators: why EMIS Group?
We’re joining up healthcare. Through innovative IT, we’re 
giving more and more healthcare professionals access to the 
information they need to provide better, faster and cheaper 
patient care.
We’re unique. Our national reach includes clinical software 
used in every major healthcare setting – from GP surgeries to high 
street pharmacies, community, hospitals and specialist services. 
We’re clinically focused. We enable clinicians to provide 
safe and efficient care – helping patients live longer, healthier 
lives. Our technology is used by more clinicians in the UK than 
any other provider and we have a significant and growing 
international presence.
We care about what we do. Our clinically led design teams 
work with our customers to develop systems. That’s why we 
consistently meet the needs of individuals – whether a district 
nurse or an A&E consultant. 
We’re pioneering. We’ve won awards for our innovation and 
excellence and invested in not-for-profit research that is openly 
available to all. We’re always looking at future technologies to 
make sure we develop ground-breaking services that benefit 
patients and clinicians. 
We’ve got strength in numbers. Our clinical systems are 
used by over 10,000 healthcare organisations across the UK.

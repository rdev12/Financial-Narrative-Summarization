Marketplace overview
Private sector
As companies continue to seek cost 
reductions in order to compete in tough 
market conditions, they are focusing 
on the further outsourcing of non-core 
services. Increased demand is 
being driven by integrated Facilities 
Management (FM) and energy services.
Our organic growth is based on excellent 
client relationships. We have worked 
alongside many of our clients for a number 
of years, building trust and mutual respect 
that has translated into increased 
business. There are many opportunities 
for us to repeat the growth achieved 
with existing clients such as Rolls-Royce, 
V odafone and Diageo while also exploring 
the potential of new relationships.
We see signiﬁcant integrated FM 
opportunities in the ﬁnancial services 
and retail sectors, and were pleased 
to see potential become reality with 
our appointment to service a £775m 
transformational contract for Lloyds 
Banking Group. 
The majority of ﬁnancial and retail 
sector clients operate with single-service 
contracts and we anticipate that the 
next phase of outsourcing is likely to see 
a shift towards integrated property and 
energy management. 
Public sector
The public sector remains under 
pressure, with central government and 
local authorities in the UK streamlining 
their cost bases in a trend that is 
likely to continue for the foreseeable 
future – and this is creating signiﬁcant 
opportunities for outsourcing. The UK 
Government’s 201 1 Parliamentary 
White Paper on Open Public Services 
made clear that there remains a strong 
political will to introduce greater 
competition and reform into more 
areas of public services. 
We remain predominantly focused 
on the justice, social housing, education 
and health sectors.
The Home Office and Ministry of Justice 
(MoJ) have a ﬁve year strategic plan 
which runs from 2010 to 201 5. As part of 
this, they have savings targets of 25% over 
four years and have initiated a number 
of programmes to meet that goal. 
Our own MoJ pipeline stands at some 
£1bn, with many key contracts due to 
be decided during 2012. Against a 
backdrop of full prisons and the rising 
costs of the justice process, there are 
speciﬁc and extensive outsourcing 
opportunities in areas such as FM, 
prisons management, electronic 
monitoring, community payback and 
probation trusts. Home Office market 
opportunities include police services 
and immigration removal centres.
In the health sector, we are seeing 
a range of opportunities, including 
a growing portfolio of energy services 
work to upgrade ageing infrastructure. 
Increasingly, there is also a strong 
community element to these projects. 
For example, for Camden Council, 
we developed an innovative energy 
scheme to supply up to 1,500 council 
tenants with surplus heat from 
our energy plant at the Royal Free 
Hospital in Hampstead.
To date, we have seen limited 
momentum within local authorities 
to combine more services and 
rationalise their estates. 
However, the pipeline of outsourcing 
opportunities for the delivery of local 
public services remains strong across 
the UK. 
Exciting opportunities 
in changing markets
We work closely with clients in both the private and 
public sectors, primarily in the UK but increasingly in other 
European countries too. The trend towards integrated services 
is a long-term one, and has been clearly identiﬁed in previous 
Annual Reports. What is different now is the speed of change 
and the scale of contracts – more clients are asking more 
and more of us.
In addition to helping them improve efﬁciency while reducing 
costs by outsourcing non-core services to us, we also enable 
clients to reduce the amount of energy they use as well as the 
price they pay for it.

Governance Accounts Business review Overview
In January 2012, the City of Edinburgh 
Council recommended MITIE as the 
preferred bidder for its integrated facilities 
management contract, a proposed 
seven year partnership which would 
have generated signiﬁcant beneﬁts 
to Edinburgh creating 200 new jobs, 
50 apprenticeships and with guaranteed 
savings of between £51m and £1 14m. 
Members of the City of Edinburgh 
Council subsequently voted not to 
approve the proposed contract. 
Whilst a disappointing outcome, our 
proposal offered a model of the future of 
outsourcing and we will continue to invest 
in this area to support its future growth.
Energy services
Our energy services business already 
accounts for 34% of our revenue and 
may rise even further as demand grows 
in both the public and private sectors 
for energy and carbon strategies, driven 
by macroeconomic, environmental 
and legislative factors.
Reduced consumption and diversiﬁed 
energy supply are major objectives for 
all clients. The UK alone must spend 
£450bn on energy efficiency measures 
and supply infrastructure by 2025. 
Across the EU, there are an estimated 
700-1040 active energy service contracts 
with a market value of €6.7bn to €8.5bn. 
This is expected to grow to around 
€25bn by 2020. Energy management is 
now accepted as central to an effective 
FM service – in fact our energy services 
capability is part of every contract we 
operate and is absolutely fundamental 
to our larger bids. 
Already the second largest energy 
services company in the UK, we are well-
positioned for rapid growth. Our strengths 
are based around six core capabilities: 
decentralised energy; renewable 
energy; energy consumption reduction; 
carbon compliance; data management; 
and the introduction of innovative ideas 
and initiatives that raise awareness.
International and new markets
We go where our clients need us 
to go, and as they increasingly take  
a pan-European approach to 
procurement we have expanded 
our services beyond the UK. 
Our work with Rolls-Royce now spans 
the continent and demonstrates our 
ability to provide integrated FM and 
energy services across borders.
The opportunity is clear: 43% of our top 
100 clients have international operations – 
and we are positioned to help them 
access the same efficiencies they enjoy 
in the UK.
Our European capability was initially 
provided via a partnership with Service 
Management International (SMI). During 
201 1 we acquired the remaining 50% of 
SMI’s equity capital. The SMI platform  
self-delivers and supply-chain manages 
FM portfolio services to multinational 
blue-chip clients across 23 countries. 
SMI’s established supply chain of affiliates 
have an annual collective turnover of 
US$8.5bn and employ 280,000 people 
worldwide. In August, SMI was appointed 
as a preferred bidder for a contract with 
Givaudan to provide integrated FM in 
several European countries. 
We currently have direct delivery 
capability in France, Germany, Poland 
and Norway – and are targeting further 
growth in Europe as we see further 
opportunities emerge in this market.
In the UK, we are constantly looking at 
ways to expand our range of services, 
not only by using our entrepreneurial 
model to enter new markets but also 
through value-creating acquisitions 
where appropriate.

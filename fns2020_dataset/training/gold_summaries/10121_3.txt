 Annual Report 2006 Metalrax Group PLC 2
Chairman’s statement
Results
For the year ended 31st December 2006 Metalrax Group PLC
achieved a 16% increase in revenue at £120.2 million (2005:
£104.0 million).
Profit before tax, excluding exceptional items, was £6.5 million
(2005: £6.8 million), ahead of expectations and reflecting a
materially improved second half performance. Profit before tax
(including exceptional items) was £6.1 million, the same as in the
previous year.
Bank overdrafts and loans at 31 December 2006 stood at 
£9.9 million (31 December 2005: £2.7 million cash in hand). This
is expected to fall this year subject to the timing of property
disposals and from the expected improvement in profitability.
A year of transformation
The three operating divisions have been firmly established and are
reported as follows for the first time: Automotive, Engineering
Support Services and Housewares. We have relocated and
integrated Kenham Tools and Pressings to Bacol Industries and
Commercial Bearings to Metalrax (Bordesley Green). We have
added to the group through the acquisitions of Makespace
Mezzanine Floors, the Belsize Engineering Company and
Advanced Handling (including the Romanian facility). Welland
Engineering Supplies also moved to new premises at the end of
the year.
Whilst the profit for the year (excluding exceptional items) as a
whole is similar to 2005 it is important to note that after a very
poor first half in 2006 when profits fell, we have seen a much
improved second half of the year with reported profits of 
£4.7 million, well in excess of last year’s £3.2 million.
This illustrates the start of the planned recovery of the group and
supports our optimism for the future.
Further transformation in 2007
The major reorganisation of the group, which commenced with
the 2004 strategic review, will be complete by the end of 2007,
but there is still much work to be done.
The development of our Romanian facility is a key opportunity.
Surplus equipment from the UK has now arrived in Romania and
a £1 million refurbishment is nearing completion.
Production on the back of new orders is about to commence and
we expect further orders to flow. I hope to report at the Annual
General Meeting a highly successful opening that is due to take
place in early May.
Romania will also undertake about half of the business from the
Prescott Powell operation, the balance being reallocated within
the Automotive Division. This will release a further freehold
property in the UK for disposal.
As reported in the Trading Update issued in January, we carried
out a review of the George Wilkinson bakeware business in
conjunction with KPMG, as it continued to under perform relative
to its peak a few years ago. The business will be downsized onto
one half of its existing site and turned into a smaller more
profitable business through both cost reduction and the
elimination of unprofitable contracts.
Having merged the management of Cooper Coated Coil and
Fabricote, it is now time to reduce down from two coating lines
to one. This will require capital investment of some £1.6 million
and will deliver a reduction in costs, operating from a single site
with one of the most efficient lines in the world and with no
reduction in capacity. The environmental impact will be
significantly improved. Again a freehold property will be released
for sale.

Dividend
As indicated in our January Trading Update, the board is
recommending the payment of an unchanged final dividend of
3.75 pence per ordinary share to be made on 25th May 2007 to
shareholders on the register on 27th April 2007, subject to formal
approval at the Annual General Meeting on Wednesday, 
23rd May 2007. This, together with the interim dividend of 1.65
pence per share, makes an unchanged total dividend for the year
of 5.4 pence per ordinary share. 
The dividend policy reflects the board’s continued confidence in
the longer term outlook for the group and the level of cash that is
being realised from property disposals arising from the
reorganisation process. 
Board changes
As previously reported the board structure has undergone a
number of changes in the year. On 14th March 2006 four board
members relinquished their positions in order to form the nucleus
of the newly created operational board. Andy Pearson joined the
board as a non-executive director on 1st January 2006 and Bill
Kelly was appointed Group Finance Director on 14th March 2006.
After twelve years on the board, Reg Fort will be retiring after the
2007 Annual General Meeting in May. On behalf of board
colleagues past and present we thank him for his wise counsel
and wish him well in his retirement from the group.
Our People
2006 has been a year of significant change for the group, to
which I welcome our new joiners. On behalf of the board I wish
to thank all of our people for their valued hard work and
commitment to the group. They have again proved themselves to
be our greatest asset.
Pensions
I am pleased to report that as a result of initiatives instigated by
the board, there has been a substantial reduction in the net
deficit in the main Metalrax Scheme, from £5.8 million to 
£3.2 million.
Outlook and current trading
Metalrax remains on a robust financial footing. The group has
been faced by many challenges in recent years both internally and
externally generated, and as our peers will attest, common to all
involved in the global metal manufacturing market.
The signs are that the reorganisation work is beginning to bear
fruit and there are reasons to be optimistic about the future. The
cash being generated from property disposals now and in the
future strengthens the group financially during times of change
and also allows us to realise our growth aspirations by continuing
to consider selective acquisitions
We have had a satisfactory start to the current financial year in
line with our expectations for the year as a whole.

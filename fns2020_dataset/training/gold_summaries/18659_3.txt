STRATEGIC REPORT
PERFORMANCE 
& PROGRESS 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
growth of 25%
(1)
 and EPS growth of  
21%
(1)
. Taking into account this financial 
performance, and in line with our policy of 
building dividend cover towards 3x earnings, 
the Board proposes to increase to the full  
year core dividend by 5%. 
The Hays business is broad-based, well 
diversified and balanced. We have grown  
into new geographies and new sector 
specialisms, primarily through organic 
replication of our business, supplemented  
by acquisitions when appropriate. 
This year we completed the acquisition  
of Veredus Corp., a US-based IT staffing 
company, which has provided us with  
a great platform to build scale rapidly  
in what is the world’s largest recruitment 
market. This, along with our existing 
worldwide operations, enables us to serve  
the needs of our multinational clients and  
our internationally mobile candidates by 
offering them a truly global service around 
the clock, delivered around the world by 
talented local experts. This scale and breadth 
makes us unique in the world of specialist 
recruitment, and is a key driver of the  
Group’s success.
I and the Board have had the opportunity  
to visit many Hays offices this year in 
countries such as Germany, France and the 
US and have, as ever, been greatly impressed 
by the professionalism, talent and expertise  
of our people. Everyone in the Group shares 
the same aim of making Hays the world’s 
pre-eminent specialist recruitment business 
and their drive and commitment has 
underpinned this year’s strong financial  
and operational performance. I would 
therefore like to thank everyone in the Group 
for their contribution over the last 12 months 
and we look forward to another successful 
year in 2016.

“ In 2015 we have delivered 
a strong set of results 
with excellent operating 
profit growth and a 
strong cash performance. 
We have also made 
further strategic progress, 
notably completing the 
acquisition of Veredus in 
the US.”
We delivered good net fee growth of 9%

,  
as we capitalised on continued strength  
in the majority of our markets, further 
improvements in the UK and a return to 
growth in Australia. We converted this net  
fee growth into excellent operating profit

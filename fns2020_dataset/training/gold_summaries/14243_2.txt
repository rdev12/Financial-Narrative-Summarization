Highlights of 2010
Operational
  Successful merger and integration of Silence and Intradigm
	 to	create	a	leading	company	 in	the	field	of	RNA	interference	(RNAi).
  Excellent progress made with ongoing Phase I clinical trial of Atu027, 
Silence’s	lead	compound,	for	the	treatment	of	solid	tumours.	As	of	March	2011,	
23 	 patients 	 have 	 been 	 treated 	 with 	 Atu027 	 and, 	 to 	 date, 	 the 	 compound 	 has 	 been	
shown	to	be	safe	and	well	tolerated.
  Atu027 shown to prevent the formation of lung metastases 
	 	 in	a	variety	of	preclinical	brea st	cancer	models.	Data	were	published	in	a	
peer -reviewed	paper	in	Clinical	Cancer	Research.
  Silence’s partner, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., successfully	completed	
two	Phase	I	trials	of	QPI-1002,	which	incorporates	Silence’s	AtuRNAi	technology .	
Quark 	 subsequently 	 initiated 	 a 	 Phase 	 II 	 trial 	 of 	 QPI-1002 	 in 	 the 	 prevention 	 of 	 delayed	
graft	function	in	kidney	transplant	patients.	
  Silence to receive up to US$1.5m milestone following 	 Quark’s 	 receipt 	 of	
a	US$10m	payment	from	Novartis	for	an	option	to	develop	and	commercialise	
QPI-1002	signed	in	August	2010.	F uture	milestone	payments	to	Silence	related	
to	Quark’s	licence	agreement	with	Novartis	could	reach	US$80m.
  Silence and AstraZeneca extended two existing collaborations: 
	 	 one 	 aimed 	 at 	 the 	 discovery 	 and 	 development 	 of 	 siRNA 	 therapeutics 	 and 	 the 	 other	
at	the	delivery	of	siRNA	sequences.
  Silence expanded its siRNA delivery collaboration with Dainippon 
Sumitomo 	 to 	 include 	 additional 	 disease 	 targets 	 that 	 were 	 not 	 originally 	 specified 	
under	the	initial	collaboration.
  Zamore Design Rules patents issued. Silence, through its licence 
agreement	with	the	University	of	Massachusetts,	was	issued	several	US	and	
European	patents	which	broadly	cover	methods	of	enhancing	silencing	activity	
of	RNAi	therapeutics.	The	Company	believes	that	the	Zamore	technology	is	
invaluable	for	the	development	of	efficacious	RNAi	therapeutics.

Post year-end events
  In	January	2011,	Silence	announced	it	was	no	longer	in	discussions	that	may	
have	led	to	an	offer	for	the	Company .	Given	the	recent	progress	of	Atu027	and	
other	technological	achievements	made	during	the	last	year ,	Silence	believes	
it	is	well	placed	to	capitalise	on	its	leadership	position	in	RNAi	therapeutics.
	 	 In	April	2011,	 Silence	announced	plans	to	raise	up	to	£6.5m	by	a	placing	
and	open	offer .

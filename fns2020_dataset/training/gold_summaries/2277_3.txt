 INTRODUCTION
It has been an encouraging year There has
been a good recovery in our overall trading
performance with consequent improvement
in our proﬁtability. The pressure on pricing and
cost increases continued and the extent of the
underlying operating improvement has been
masked by the impact of currency movements,
particularly in respect of the US dollar.
TRADING
Turnover in the year improved by 2.0% to
£457.2m (2003: £448.4m) and operating proﬁt
increased by 73.7% to £43.6m (2003: £25.1m).
Our proﬁt before taxation, goodwill and
exceptional items was £44.2m compared to
£32.0m in 2003. Goodwill amortisation was
£8.5m (2003: £9.1m) and exceptional items
were £11.2m (2003: £34.0m). 
All our Strategic Business Units (SBUs)
experienced an increase in sales and in the
main this translated into improved proﬁtability.
Of the £8.8m sales growth, all but £1.8m of
our growth in sales has been organic as the
acquisitions that we have made occurred late
in the year. 
The disposal of electroplating has largely been
completed and all the loss making plants have
either been sold or closed. The increasing
proﬁtability of the anodising and organics
businesses in Scandinavia and Germany
supports the decision to retain them in the
Group. Under the current accounting rules we
are not able to treat the electroplating activities
as discontinued until the process is completed,
which we anticipate will be in the current year. 
We made four modest acquisitions in the year
at a cost of £4.7m. In addition, in November,
we transferred our PVD businesses into a
strategic alliance with IonBond, creating an
operation with strong technical skills and wide
geographic scope which will be expanded
by acquisition and leveraging its advanced
coating technologies.
Our ongoing tight control of capital expenditure
brought about a further reduction in the year
to £34.0m (2003: £38.3m).
The £62.0m net proceeds from the rights issue
in March greatly improved the strength of
our balance sheet and gave us the ﬁnancial
ﬂexibility to further develop the business.
We have also generated free cash ﬂow of
£57.1m from trading and this has been
complemented by £20.8m from our disposal
programme. Consequently there has been
a signiﬁcant reduction in our net borrowings
which have fallen from £210.3m to £88.5m. 
OPERATING EXCEPTIONALS
AND EXCEPTIONAL CHARGES
Exceptional costs of £7.4m were incurred
in 2004 in connection with the electroplating
disposals. There was also an £3.8m exceptional
charge in respect of transferring our PVD
business into the IonBond strategic alliance.
DIVIDEND
A ﬁnal dividend of 3.85p per share is being
recommended by the Directors, which together
with the interim dividend, will make a total
payment of 6.1p per share which is an increase
of 7% (2003: 5.7p after adjustment for bonus
element of the rights issue). The dividend
will be paid on 6 July 2005 to all shareholders
on the register at the close of business on
10 June 2005. 
GOVERNANCE
Apart from some minor areas which are
explained in the Directors’ Report, Bodycote
is in compliance with the 2003 FRC Combined
Code. This mirrors the high level of compliance
achieved by Bodycote in relation to the 1998
Code in the period 1999 to 2003. Plans are
in place for reporting future results under
International Financial Reporting Standards
starting with our Interim Report in August 2005.
EMPLOYEES
We have in the past emphasised the dedication
and professionalism of our staff and it is
pleasing that this year we can show very
positive ﬁnancial beneﬁts from their efforts
which complement the additional investment
that was made by our shareholders.
CURRENT TRADING AND PROSPECTS
We are pleased with the current trading at
the start of 2005, which is in line with our
expectations. We look forward to the rest
of 2005 with a degree of conﬁdence that we
can further improve our trading performance.
As well as continuing to gain new outsourcing
contracts we also expect to expand the Group
with carefully chosen bolt-on acquisitions
which will strengthen our existing businesses
and extend their geographic spread. 
We have the essential ingredients of a strong
balance sheet, capable people, productive
facilities and systems to ensure the delivery
of exceptional quality and service which should
enable us to give a good account of ourselves
in the changing market place. The strategy
of the Group remains directed towards
consistently delivering a pre-tax return
on capital employed in the mid teens.

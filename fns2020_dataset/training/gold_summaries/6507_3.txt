 04 GENETIX GROUP PLC
Genetix has made good progress in a
difﬁcult year achieved against a backdrop
of uncertain market conditions. Excluding
the impact of the weak US dollar, sales
increased by 20% despite continuing
unpredictability and increasing lead
times for order placement. Proﬁt before
taxwas £0.9 million, up 103%. This was
a highly creditable performance and
afﬁrms the decisions we made over a year
ago to invest in our sales and marketing
effort and develop products for the
biopharmaceutical market. We now have
the chance to build upon the foundations
laid in 2004 and exploit the exciting new
opportunities opening up for our business.
In 2004, Genetix has had to adapt quickly
to meet the changing demands of our
customers. During the year we broadened
our range of products by launching
instruments targeted for use within the
biopharmaceutical sector. An example of
this is the ClonePix, where we made use
of our expertise in imaging, software and
engineering to accelerate the process
of identifying, analysing and selecting
mammalian cells. We aim to be at the
forefront of these exciting new sectors.
The new Strategic Business Unit structure
put in place last year has evolved as
the business needs have changed and
we have simpliﬁed our sales structure
wherever possible to clarify responsibilities.
The Chief Operating Ofﬁcer has taken direct
charge of US sales and is coordinating our
“team-based” sales approach, key to
successful exploitation of our new
products within the pharmaceutical sector. 
In the fourth quarter, we reduced our
headcount by 10% to maintain efﬁciency
across the business going into 2005. 
Genetix has come through a challenging
year by growing sales, cutting costs and
moving into new markets for its leading
edge systems – the coming year will be
exciting as the business seeks to establish
itself in these new markets. The initiatives
taken during 2004 combined with the
early enthusiasm shown for our new
products should lead to a progressive
improvement in sales and proﬁtability
in 2005.
We would like to thank all our staff
for their continuing hard work and
commitment over the past year.

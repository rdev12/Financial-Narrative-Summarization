 04 Air Partner PLC Annual report 2006
Record financial results produced in 
a more normalised year of trading
Strong contribution from all products 
and areas of the Group
Twelfth consecutive year of a 10% core 
dividend increase
Focus on geographic and product 
diversity rewarded
I am pleased to report that your Company has, once again, enjoyed 
a buoyant year producing significant growth in both sales and profit. 
At the time of the interim results forward bookings were 14% ahead 
of the prior year and this positive trend continued throughout the 
second half of the financial year. Accordingly, Group sales grew by 
15% to £140.4 million (2005: £122.5 million)*, with profit before tax 
for the year ended 31 July 2006 up by 16% to £5.13 million 
(2005: £4.41 million)*. Diluted earnings per share increased by 15% 
to 34.4p (2005: 29.8p)* and the unaudited Group cash position, as 
at 30 September 2006, was £15.6 million (FY2005: £15.4 million). 
The directors have recommended payment of a final dividend of 
12.1p, making the total for the year 18.2p (2005: 16.5p, excluding 
a 20.0p special dividend) representing an increase in the core 
dividend of 10% for the twelfth consecutive year.
Air Partner’s 2005 record results benefited from one off, non-repeating 
contracts, while this year has been characterised by a more normalised 
pattern of trading and further delivery against the Group’s stated 
strategy. The announcement of back-to-back record financial results 
is a testimony to the robustness and resilience of the Group today. 
Air Partner has worked hard to diversify its revenue streams both by 
geography and product, thereby successfully positioning the Group 
to take advantage of the significant increases in air travel that have 
occurred in the last decade.

The ongoing globalisation of markets in an ever-increasing time-short 
society continues to drive growth in the aviation industry, and 
particularly private charter. Consequently, the demand for Air Partner’s 
services is more diverse and broad-based than ever before. In the 
period under review 35% of turnover came from the Government 
sector and Air Partner acted for six of the G8 group of Governments. 
In addition, increasing stringent security requirements have made 
conventional airline travel more exasperating, fuelling demand for 
Air Partner’s private jet services amongst businesses, VIPs and high 
net worth individuals (“HNWI”). 
The continued HNWI population growth has led to Air Partner 
developing a new JetCard service focused on this market. The JetCard 
is designed to enable users to benefit from Air Partner’s unprecedented 
track record flying Royalty, Heads of State, Government ministers and 
high level corporate executives, by allowing them to buy private jet 
usage on a prepaid basis. The Group’s investment in JetCard has 
created a world-class Air Partner product, providing guaranteed jet 
availability, at fixed rates and with a money-back option if our clients’ 
need change. 
In line with the Group’s stated strategy to invest in the growing private 
jet market, I am delighted that the Air Partner is also announcing 
today the acquisition of a leading London-based private jet operator, 
Gold Air. A full statement on the acquisition is available on RNS, but 
the transaction is immediately earnings enhancing and provides 
Air Partner with control of the UK’s newest private jet fleet without 
owning the aircraft.
Current trading remains strong and advanced bookings are 
significantly ahead of this time last year. The Group continues to 
invest at all levels for future success and accordingly, your Board 
remains confident of Air Partner’s future success.

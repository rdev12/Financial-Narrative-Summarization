ClearSpeed Annual Report and Accounts 2005
Chief Executive Officer’s review
Overview
The strategic priority for ClearSpeed 
as it entered 2005 was to commence
the transition from its technology
development phase to beginning 
to build out a fully-fledged business.
Throughout the year the group made
considerable progress in achieving 
this goal. 
ClearSpeed made significant progress 
in its technical development and won
its first high-performance computing
system customer. It launched and
commenced shipping its first commercial
product: the Advance
™
Board containing
two CSX600 processors. The group
believes that an increased awareness 
of and interest in its technology from
potential partners and customers is
confirmation that it is potentially well
placed to exploit major trends within 
the industry. 
Costs were contained and cash outflows
from operations were in line with group
expectations. The successful fundraising
will enable ClearSpeed to capitalise 
on and develop its position as the
designer and supplier of the world’s
fastest and most power-efficient
multicore processor for 64-bit floating
point operations.
Market opportunity
Growth in demand for high-performance
computers (HPC) is being driven by 
a combination of factors, two of which
are particularly important. 
Firstly, HPC systems are no longer
required just by government and
academic research laboratories, 
they are now also a critical tool in 
key industries which we see as the
wider commercial space for HPC and
include important sectors such as: 
• Aerospace and Automotive
• Life Sciences & Biotechnology 
• Energy, Oil & Gas 
• Scientific Computing 
• Digital Content Creation 
• Financial Analysis & Modelling 
Secondly, while specialised systems
such as IBM’s Blue Gene, or those from
Cray, NEC and SGI, meet the need for
special-purpose systems at the very
high end, in the wider commercial
space for HPC a fundamental change
has occurred. Here the use of standard
processors, those that have delivered 
so much in terms of the cost and
capability of PCs and servers, has come
to dominate. 
ClearSpeed’s strategy of supplying its
technology to the HPC market through
Advance
™
Boards requires no chip
integration and also allows for systems
upgrades to be easily accommodated,
both retrospectively and for new cluster
systems. In addition to the existing
installed base of HPC cluster systems,
analysts estimate that 150,000 HPC
cluster systems were delivered in 2004
and are forecast to rise to 220,000 HPC
cluster systems in 2007. Through
ClearSpeed’s channel partners in the US
and Far East, the directors are confident
that ClearSpeed’s technology will be
selected for other new HPC projects.

The group’s strategy of engaging 
with independent software vendors 
and suppliers to port code to the
ClearSpeed processor complements 
its “Plug and Play” strategy in removing
barriers to adoption. Workstation users
with compute-intensive requirements,
such as computer-aided design and
engineering, can access the group’s
technology using the group’s Advance
™
Board. The group has entered into
informal partnerships with various
independent software vendors, and at
the Supercomputing Conference in
Seattle in November 2005 demonstrated
its technology with Mathematica and
MATLAB
®
software packages. These
software packages alone are estimated
to have at least one million users, 
some of whom are expected to have
sufficiently intense computing needs 
to require the processing acceleration
delivered by ClearSpeed’s solutions.
Within the embedded systems market,
the group has also had some initial
commercial success. For example, 
a UK-based defence systems vendor 
has entered into ClearSpeed’s partner
programme for a project, which has 
the potential to result in orders for
thousands of processors.
Technical development
It was a major milestone for the group
that in June 2005 it demonstrated its
first commercial processor, the CSX600. 
Offering up to a sustained performance
of 25 billion 64-bit floating point
operations per second (25GFLOPS), 
the CSX600 is the world’s highest
performance processor for this type 
of compute-intensive work. Achieving
this performance level while consuming
less than 10 watts, the CSX600 is 
also the world’s most power-efficient
processor for this type of application
area. Delivering a processor of this
capability was a very significant
achievement of the whole team 
in 2005. 
The key benefit of such high levels 
of performance (when delivered so
power-efficiently and in a processor
which is complementary to the main
processors from companies such as
AMD, IBM and Intel) is that, by lowering
both the cost of purchase and the cost
of ownership of high-performance and
technical computing systems, the
CSX600 enables teams – in industries 
as diverse as aerospace, financials, 
and oil and gas – to achieve new levels
of accuracy in a much shorter time 
than might previously have been
economically affordable for them,
making a direct contribution to their
productivity, time to market and
competitive advantage.
Business development and build-out
The value proposition offered by the
CSX600 and the group’s Advance
™
Board, each of which contains two
CSX600 processors, was increasingly
recognised during 2005, and this 
led to the group having discussions 
and engagements with numerous
customers and channel partners
including Sun Microsystems and NEC.
The group was also pleased to find that
its pricing assumptions for such a value
proposition were also validated, and the
announcement on 15 November 2005
that ClearSpeed was selected by the
Tokyo Institute of Technology as part 
of a consortium, led by NEC and 
Sun Microsystems, to develop Japan’s
largest supercomputer was a further
major milestone. The order for boards
for this system was received by the
group in 2005 and was worth
approximately $2 million.
While keeping costs lower than
expected during the period, the 
group has continued to develop 
the capabilities needed to deliver 
its products to market. ClearSpeed 
has successfully developed a supply
chain with partners in the US, who 
all have the ability to handle volume
manufacturing. ClearSpeed 
has also strengthened its marketing 
and customer support capability. 
Team
It is through the talent and commitment
of the whole team that so much has
been achieved, both technically and
commercially, in 2005. The group
aspires to recruit and retain very
talented individuals throughout the
functions that it is developing, and to
be a rewarding place in which to work.
The group was therefore pleased that in
2005 it continued to be able to recruit
key individuals in both the USA and the
UK and that turnover within the team
continues to be very low.
Trading
The principal influences on the financial
performance of ClearSpeed during
2005 were the continued investment 
in research and development, 
a building-out of the business reflected 
in an increase in marketing and
administrative expenses and an
increase in working capital to support
the increasing sales activity. The
retained loss for 2005 was £6,412,000,
up from a loss of £3,753,000 for 2004.
Turnover for 2005 was £439,000, 
an increase of 78% on the 2004 
figure of £247,000. This increase is as 
a result of the sale of Advance
™
Boards,
following their release to market during
the fourth quarter. The gross margin for
2005 was 66% (2004: 58%), reflecting
both the sales price levels achieved at
low volumes and the manufacturing
costs associated with low throughput.  08

review 
continued
“The group was successful in meeting most of its goals 
in 2005, and has created a platform from which to continue
this progress in 2006.”
Whilst administrative expenses
increased to £7,378,000 in 2005 from
£4,408,000 in 2004, the business
continued to operate with a lean model
throughout the period. Investment 
in the product roadmap continued,
resulting in research, design and
development expenses for 2005 
being £4,677,000. Marketing and
administrative expenses for 2005 were
£2,701,000, up by £919,000 on the
2004 expenses of £1,782,000. The
majority of the increase was incurred 
in the second half of 2005 when
expenses increased by 73% to reflect
the building-out of sales, marketing 
and customer support activities
following the commercial launch 
of the group’s first product.
Cash flow and fundraising
The continued investment in research
and development and the growth in
marketing and administrative expenses
were the principal reasons for the cash
outflow from operating activities being
£6,824,000 for 2005, up from
£4,238,000 for 2004. 
Purchase of tangible fixed assets 
in 2005 was £321,000 compared to
£84,000 in 2004. Office and computer
equipment with a cost of £216,000 
was purchased to support the new
headcount, which increased from an
average of 35 employees in 2004 to 
54 employees in 2005. Additionally,
with the launch to production of the
company’s first commercial product,
the Advance
™
Board, tooling costing
£105,000 was incurred.
During December 2005, ClearSpeed
raised approximately £20,070,000 
(net of expenses) by way of a placing.
The new funds will be used to: 
• Consolidate the group’s position 
as the designer and supplier of the
world’s fastest and most power-
efficient multicore microprocessor 
for 64-bit floating point performance
• Provide additional working capital 
to finance the commencement of
volume shipments of the group’s 
first products, the CSX600 processor
and Advance
™
Board
• Increase the rate of investment in the
group’s sales and marketing effort
• Increase investment in product
development
• Strengthen the group’s balance sheet
Working capital
The commencement of production of
the group’s first commercial products
resulted in an investment of £251,000
in stock at the end of 2005 (2004: nil).
Trade debtors increased to £173,000 at
the end of 2005, an increase of £89,000
on the balance at the end of 2004,
reflecting the increase in turnover.
The renewal of computer-aided design
licenses during December was the
principal reason for trade creditors
being £922,000 at the end of 2005, 
an increase of £628,000 over the
comparable figure for 2004. The
majority of this expenditure was 
carried forward as a prepayment 
at the end of 2005.
Taxation
Tax credits of £391,000 relating to
research and development activities
were received and credited to the 
profit and loss account during 2005
compared to £275,000 for the 
previous year.
At the end of 2005 the group had 
an unrecognised deferred tax asset 
of £11,400,000 (2004: £9,500,000)
resulting mainly from tax losses. This is
available indefinitely to offset against
future taxable profits of the same trade.
Accounting Standards developments
In June 2003, the Council of the
European Union adopted regulations
requiring listed companies in Member
States to prepare their consolidated
financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) from 2005. In 
2004 it was decided that AIM-listed
companies do not need to file their
accounts under IFRS until 2007. The
group has decided to adopt IFRS for
2007 reporting and accordingly the 
first financial results to be announced
prepared in accordance with IFRS 
will be for the first half of 2007.
Accounting standard FRS20, covering
the accounting and reporting of
employee stock options, is required to
be adopted for 2006, and as a result the
financial results for the first half of 2006
will be prepared on this basis.
Summary
Focused on commencing the transition
from its technology development phase
to beginning to build out a fully-fledged
business, the group was successful in
meeting the majority of its goals in
2005, and there is good reason to
believe that this has created a platform
from which to continue this progress
during 2006.

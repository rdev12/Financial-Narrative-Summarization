Chief Executive’s Statement
Julian Wassell
Total revenue for the year was £4.96 million, 
a 4% reduction from last year. From a sales 
point of view, the end of the financial year 
was a little disappointing with a small number 
of customers delaying orders. Whilst each 
opportunity had a specific and understandable 
reason for the delay, it is also possible that 
caution over wider economic factors played 
a part in these instances. These opportunities 
have not been lost and we are continuing 
to work to expedite them. The first of the 
delayed orders was converted in October 
and so far in the current financial year we 
are slightly ahead of the previous year in 
overall revenue terms.
Our adjusted operating profit for the year 
was £430,000 compared with £459,000 in 
2015. Ordinarily we would expect a reduction 
in turnover to have a similar pound for pound 
impact on operating profit, as our overall 
gross margin is typically well over 90%. 
We were, however, able to maintain our 
adjusted operating profit at a level broadly 
similar to last year due to an improvement 
in margins and targeted overhead savings. 
Hardware related revenue was £116,000 
compared with £184,000.
We have for many years pursued a strategy 
to strengthen the relationship with our 
customers by growing the proportion of 
our revenues delivered through our hosting 
centre in Milton Keynes. Last year was no 
exception as hosting revenues amounted 
to 59% of total revenues, up from 51% the 
previous year, strengthening our recurring 
revenues and therefore visibility.
We strengthened our new business sales 
team last year and are currently looking to 
invest further in this area. We continue to 
manage the migration process to Quantum VS 
carefully, recognising that while Quantum VS 
provides an excellent solution for the majority 
of users of our older legacy products, the 
migration process itself inevitably leads to 
higher levels of customer churn than we 
have historically seen. We have continued 
to sign new orders during the year and at 
30 September 2016, we had 40 customers 
signed up for our Quantum VS product with 
a further 113 still using our older applications. 
The first customers for our new Quantum VS 
e-business module went live during the 
year and we have further customers currently 
in the implementation process. Quantum VS 
e-business allows us to offer a single product 
which can be implemented on an incremental 
basis starting with a simple website, through 
on-line catalogue access, to a sophisticated 
e–business solution fully integrated into their 
back-office application. It is also compatible 
with our legacy applications which assists 
the migration process.
In the short-term, we would expect to 
see the proportion of our total revenues 
represented by Vecta start to increase due 
to the fact that its sales cycle is much 
shorter than that for an ERP solution 
such as Quantum VS.
Strategy
Our two main products, Quantum VS and 
Vecta, deliver software solutions that offer 
clear business benefits to our customers 
helping them to generate sales growth or 
to create efficiencies and drive down costs. 
Quantum VS and Vecta are complementary 
with many of our customers using both.
Quantum VS is an ERP application focussed 
on a number of verticals within the distribution 
sector including builders and timber merchants, 
suppliers of fixings and fastenings, industrial 
and security products and electrical 
wholesalers. Our long-term strategy is to 
manage the migration of customers from our 
four legacy applications (Merchant, Charisma, 
Esprit and The Business Programme) to 
Quantum VS whilst identifying and exploiting 
new business opportunities in our target 
vertical markets.
Vecta is a powerful combined CRM and 
Business Intelligence (BI) product which 
drives sales growth for businesses in a 
wide range of verticals. Our strategy remains 
to exploit the space between the major 
CRM products, which typically do not 
deliver sales analysis, and pure BI tools. 
We plan to continue investing in the 
long-term future of our key products through 
significant levels of R&D. During the year 
under review total R&D expenditure amounted 
to £982,000 or 20% of total revenues. 
For comparison purposes, last year this 
was £1,067,000, also 20%.
Business model
Our software products are supplied under 
long-term contracts of up to five years’ 
initial duration. These can be either in 
the form of traditional on-site licencing 
arrangements or hosted service level 
agreements. These contracted recurring 
revenues represented 82% of total revenues 
during the year, up from 79% last year. 
Typically, our customer relationships extend 
well beyond the initial contract period. 
This recurring revenue model gives us 
good visibility of revenues and also generates 
strong cashflows as charges are typically 
invoiced annually in advance. 
The remaining 18% of our revenues arise 
from initial software licence fees, hosting 
joining fees and the provision of professional 
services (implementation, training and 
consultancy). We also supply a small 
amount of low-margin computer hardware.
Summary
•  Total revenue for the year was £4.96 million, 
a 4% reduction from last year. 
•  Adjusted operating profit for the year 
was £430,000 compared with £459,000 
in 2015. We were able to maintain 
our adjusted operating profit at a level 
broadly similar to last year due to an 
improvement in margins and targeted 
overhead savings.
•  Contracted recurring revenues represented 
82% of total revenues during the year, 
up from 79% last year. 
•  Operating cash flows remained strong 
at £860,000 (2015: £952,000). 
We have for many years 
pursued a strategy to 
strengthen the relationship 
with our customers by 
growing the proportion 
of our revenues delivered 
through our hosting centre 
in Milton Keynes. Last 
year was no exception 
as hosting revenues 
amounted to 59% of total 
revenues, up from 51% 
the previous year. Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 4
“ Our two main products, Quantum VS and Vecta, deliver 
software solutions that offer clear business benefits to 
our customers helping them to generate sales growth 
or to create efficiencies and drive down costs.”
Business model continued
We have seen a gradual move in recent 
years away from the traditional licence 
fee model in favour of subscription pricing. 
This is particularly the case with Vecta, the 
latest version of which is exclusively delivered 
on a cloud basis. Subscription pricing in the 
long-term will benefit the business as 
on-going revenues are typically higher than 
under traditional licence fee arrangements. 
However, this is at the expense of lower 
up-front revenues in the short-term.
Financial review
Revenue for the year was £4.96 million 
compared with £5.16 million last year. 
Second half revenues were £2.45 million 
compared with £2.51 million in the first 
half of the year. 
Adjusted operating profit for the year was 
£430,000 representing an operating margin 
of 8.7%. This compares to £459,000 last 
year (an operating margin of 8.9%). Statutory 
profit before tax was £244,000 compared 
to £347,000 last year.
We use adjusted operating profit to 
monitor the performance of the business 
on a day-to-day basis. It excludes interest 
receivable, any gains and losses on property 
transactions, one-off exceptional items and 
a number of non-cash items which arise 
under IFRS (namely defined benefit pension 
scheme charges and the capitalisation 
and amortisation of development costs). 
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit 
to statutory profit before tax is provided 
in note 3 to the accounts.
The current year’s result includes 
exceptional charges of £114,000 in relation 
to property matters. These are described 
in the property section below. Last year’s 
result included a net charge of £72,000 
in relation to property matters (a profit 
on disposal of £117,000 and a provision 
of £189,000 against the carrying value 
of the surplus Milton Keynes property).
Operating cash flows remained 
strong at £860,000 (2015: £952,000). 
Other significant cash items were dividends 
of £631,000 and capital expenditure 
of £360,000, after which cash balances 
and short-term deposits totalled £5.40 million 
compared to £5.55 million at 
30 September 2015.
R&D expenditure was £982,000 
(2015: £1,067,000). Of this £127,000 
(2015: £139,000) was capitalised as 
required by IAS 38. Amortisation of 
previously capitalised R&D expenditure 
amounted to £96,000 (2015: £66,000). 
Accordingly, the R&D charge in the income 
statement is £951,000 (2015: £994,000).
The tax charge for the year was £86,000 
(2015: £43,000) which represents an 
effective tax rate of 35%. £30,000 of 
the charge arises from a reduction in the 
deferred tax rate applied to the pension 
scheme liability. Taking this into account 
gives an underlying effective tax rate of 23%.
Earnings per share was 1.25p or 1.24p on 
a fully diluted basis (2015: 2.41p and 2.39p).
Pension
The liability associated with the Group’s 
defined benefit pension scheme has 
increased again this year, from £2.27 million 
to £3.88 million before deferred tax. This is 
principally due to a continuing fall in corporate 
bond yields which are used to value the 
liabilities in the scheme. Of this, £1.53 million 
has been taken directly to reserves as an 
actuarial loss. The remaining £84,000 has 
been charged in the income statement. 
The scheme was closed to future accrual 
in 2014 and consequently there was no 
current service cost in 2016.
Valuing the scheme under the accounting 
rules prescribed by IAS 19, net assets since 
2009 have been reduced by £3.38 million. 
The steady fall in corporate bond yields 
since 2009, which reflect the low interest 
rate environment that has prevailed over 
that period, has resulted in the discount 
rate assumption falling steadily, from 5.7% 
in 2009 to 2.2% in 2016. It should be noted 
that any subsequent increase in interest 
rates and recovery in bond yields would, inter 
alia, lead to an improvement in the IAS 19 
position of the scheme.
In contrast with the IAS 19 valuation, the 
most recent triennial actuarial valuation 
of the scheme, which was performed at 
31 July 2013, showed a small surplus on 
an ongoing funding basis. Importantly, as 
a result of the scheme being fully funded 
on this basis, the Group is not currently 
required to make cash contributions into 
the scheme. The scheme actuary is currently 
undertaking an updated triennial valuation 
as at 31 July 2016. This valuation will be 
finalised during 2017 and we will report 
the results to shareholders in due course.
The defined benefit pension scheme 
comprises a grouped funding arrangement 
whose sole asset is a with-profits insurance 
policy backed by corporate bonds. The main 
difference between the IAS 19 valuation and 
the ongoing funding valuation is that IAS 19 
requires the scheme asset to be valued at the 
insurance policy’s discontinuance surrender 
value at the period end. This valuation does 
not take into account the guaranteed annuity 
rates which have been secured by the policy 
and which are included in the ongoing 
scheme funding valuation.
Net assets
Primarily as a result of the increase in 
pension liability referred to above, net assets 
reduced to £3.19 million from £4.96 million. 
Net assets per share amounted to 25.3p 
(2015: 39.3p).

 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 3
I am pleased to be able to announce our results for the
financial year, which demonstrate the Group’s resilience in
adverse trading conditions. As you will see, turnover for
2005 increased modestly by 2% to £2.71 million (2004:
£2.67 million) although profit after tax decreased to
£51,941 (2004: £278,163).  
Overall, we had a challenging year as the mild weather
depressed claims volumes which have, of course,
traditionally been significantly dependant on weather
related losses. Nevertheless, we have continued our efforts
to reduce our reliance on such losses with significant
success in the second half of the year. Consultancy
income increased to £359,000 (2004: £48,000) and we
also commenced the first stage of our partnership
relationship with Capita Insurance Services by entering into a contract to provide Liability
adjusting services.
Costs and cash-flow continue to be monitored carefully and additional margin gains are
achievable as our level of activity increases.  
Whilst the current financial year, commencing 1st January, continues to display low
volumes of weather related claims, we anticipate that the Group’s results will ultimately
benefit from our efforts to diversify our services. 
We remain committed to investment in our information technology infrastructure and
expect to make further advancements in the use of IT in our field adjusting services.
As always, I wish to thank our loyal employees and our shareholders for their support.

“this is an excellent performance. Bloomsbury’s core attributes of entrepreneurship, innovation, 
publicity flair and tight control of costs have led to the delivery of o ne g lobal Bloomsbury and the 
future performance we have now set the stage for as we enjoy the synergies and sales advantages of 
having delivered a unified worldwide publishing group. in our strategy for growth we are targeting 
50% of profit to be digital within five years, with Bloomsbury being the number one applied visual 
arts and independent humanities and social science publisher in e urope. over that time we aim to be 
the number one publisher of choice in cookery, sport and natural history, with an information division 
which has a global base delivering increasing revenues from digital knowledge hubs.
We start the year with a very strong programme led by the publication of And the Mountains Echoed by

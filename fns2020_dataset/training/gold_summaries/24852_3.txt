CHAIRMAN’S ST A TEMENT
EUGENE SHVIDLER
STEADY 
PROGRESS
Dear Shareholder , 
I am pleased to report that our key short-term 
objectives of stabilising production, furthering 
the unlocking of our extensive resource base 
and enhancing our cost competitiveness, as 
outlined a year ago, met with considerable 
success during 2016.
A solid operating performance resulted in  
the overall production of 261,159 oz of gold 
and gold equivalent. This nudges the record  
output of 262,485 oz achieved in 2015 and  
sits comfortably within our official estimate  
of between 255,000 and 265,000 oz. We are 
repeating this guidance range in respect  
of 2017 when, once again, our intention  
is to balance stable production with the 
progression of our principal development  
and exploration projects.
Such projects are integral to your Company’s 
ongoing growth and, in line with this, activity 
at Kekura, our flagship development 
undertaking situated in the remote, mineral 
rich region of Chukotka, in the Far East  
of Russia, will gather further momentum 
during 2017 and beyond as we prepare  
for commercial production in 2020. 
The importance of this premier project to  
our medium-term production targets, the 
respective performances of our three operating 
mines – MNV , Belaya Gora and Novo – and 
the scale of additional development and 
exploration activities, are covered in detail  
in the Chief Executive’s Report and the 
subsequent Operational Review.
In view of this I will merely draw attention  
to the following: 
• The life of MNV , our oldest mine, has been 
extended by four years to 2022 following  
a detailed reappraisal of each of the mine’s 
12 ore bodies and receipt of the regulatory 
approval of reserves under Russian  
(GKZ) classification;
• Plans to significantly increase the mining 
and milling capacity of Novo, our largest 
producer, from 700,000 tonnes per annum 
to 1.3 million tonnes per annum by 2018  
are progressing well; and 
• Mining and processing challenges at  
Belaya Gora, our youngest mine, are  
being addressed in conjunction with 
outside consultants.
 “THE SOUND ACHIEVEMENTS  
OF 2016 BEAR WITNESS  
T O MANAGEMENT’S ONGOING 
PURSUIT OF ‘GOOD GROWTH 
POTENTIAL ’…” 7
Highland Gold Mining Limited | Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report
The sound achievements of 2016 bear witness 
to management’s ongoing pursuit of ‘good 
growth potential’ and, irrespective of the 
inevitable challenges, your Board has every 
confidence that the unlocking of Highland’s 
valuable resource base over the ensuing 
years will yield further significant rewards 
for shareholders. 
At the time of incorporation Highland also 
demonstrated ‘a firm commitment towards 
safety , health and the environment and social 
responsibility towards employees and 
communities.’ As the Chief Executive’s 
Report and the Operational Review show, 
such perspectives are as much a part of 
Highland’s corporate culture today as they 
were in 2002. 
I am pleased to record a 5.5% reduction  
in our Total Cash Costs to US$454 per oz in 
2016, while our All-In-Sustaining Cash Costs 
remained basically flat at US$652 per ounce. 
Strict expenditure controls, a higher gold 
price, efficiency improvements and the 
weakness of the Russian Rouble versus  
the US$ all served to drive these key 
performance indicators which illustrate  
the competitive advantage we enjoy  
as a low-cost gold producer.
The average gold and gold equivalent  
price realised during 2016 amounted  
to US$1,136 (2015: US$1,062 per oz) and 
should be viewed alongside our All-In-
Sustaining Cash Costs measurement. 
These factors were duly reflected in  
a 21.9% increase in 2016’s EBITDA to 
US$162.5 million and a consequential 
advance in our EBITDA margin to 53.1% 
(2015: 48.3%): a positive indication of 
operating profitability . 
Strong cash flow has been utilised, in part,  
to further reduce gearing and our net debt  
to EBITDA ratio at the year-end stood at  
a conservative 1.26 compared with 1.74  
as at 31 December 2015. 
Your Directors have constantly voiced the 
Company’s commitment to the return of 
profits to shareholders through dividend 
payments. Against the aforementioned 
background, the Board is pleased to 
recommend the payment of a final dividend 
of £0.054 per share (2015: £0.025 per share) 
which, subject to approval at the Annual 
General Meeting on 17 May 2017, will  
make a total distribution of £0.104 per  
share (2015: £0.045 per share) for the  
financial year to 31 December 2016. 
Management has, during the year under 
review, communicated more actively  
with the investment community , largely  
in response to the revival of interest in 
natural resource stocks: a trend that has been 
accompanied by a marked improvement  
in the stock liquidity of your Company  
and a strong share price performance. 
Shareholders may be interested to note  
that, on 23 May 2017, Highland Gold  
Mining will celebrate the 15th anniversary  
of its founding, having originally been 
incorporated in Jersey in 2002 ‘for the 
purpose of acquiring, consolidating and 
developing a portfolio of quality gold  
mining projects in the Russian Federation 
with good growth potential.’
It is with deep regret that I have to record  
the occurrence of a fatality at our MNV  
mine on 10 September 2016. Additional 
safety measures have been implemented, 
details of which are to be found in the 
following sections. 
Finally , it gives me great pleasure to thank  
all our employees, on behalf of the Board,  
for the hard work and commitment that 
underwrote our achievements during 2016.

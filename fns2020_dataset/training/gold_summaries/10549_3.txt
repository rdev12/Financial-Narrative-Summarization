Results 
t he Group’s record results for the year ended 
30 September 2013 demonstrate its position 
as a leading provider of multidisciplinary 
Engineering Services supporting critical 
uK infrastructure. t he Engineering Services 
business achieved strong growth in revenue, 
operating profit and forward order book.
Group operating profit prior to exceptional 
items and amortisation was up 9% to £1 1.2m 
(2012: £10.3m) on Group pre-exceptional 
revenue of £334.6m (2012: £337.4m). 
Group operating margin improved to 3.4% 
(2012: 3.0%). Earnings per share prior 
to exceptional items and amortisation 
increased by 7% to 14.81p (201 2: 13.90p) 
with basic earnings per share on 
continuing activities increasing 
by 25% to 14.85p (2012: 11.87p). 
t here have been a number of exceptional 
items during the year. t he net impact 
of these items in the year is a profit 
before taxation of £0.5m. An amortisation 
charge of £0.5m has also been recognised 
offsetting the exceptional profit. Full 
details of these items are set out in 
Note 3 of the financial statements.
t he Engineering Services business 
has progressed well with a 9% increase 
in revenue to £232.4m (2012: £214.1m), 
together with a 10% increase in operating 
profit to £10.6m (201 2: £9.6m). Operating 
margin improved to 4.6% (2012: 4.5%).  
t he Specialist Building activity remained 
focused on selective niche markets in the 
South with operating margin improving to 
2.0% (2012: 1.7%). As expected, operating 
profit was maintained at £2. 1m (201 2: £2. 1m) 
on revenue of £102.5m (201 2: £1 23. 1m). 
t he Group’s contracted order book 
at 30 September 2013 stood at £416m 
(2012: £331m), a 26% increase, with 
the Engineering Services order book 
up 28% to £301m (2012: £235m). 
Cash performance has been strong and 
I am pleased to report that the Group has 
returned to a year end net cash position 
of £2.8m (2012: net debt £5.5m). t his 
improvement has come through a strong 
working capital performance combined 
with the benefit of the sale of land at 
Rugby which has been recorded as 
an exceptional item.
Much of the cash generated from the 
Rugby sale was redeployed in acquiring 
l ewis Civil Engineering l imited (“l ewis”) 
for a cash consideration including costs 
of £8.2m. l ewis, which is based near 
Cardiff, specialises in the construction and 
maintenance of infrastructure and assets 
within the water industry. l ewis has revenue 
of approximately £25m per annum with an 
operating profit margin of circa 5%. It is 
a well respected brand in its region and 
market with clients including Wessex Water 
and Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water. It provides its 
services through framework agreements 
and employs 175 highly skilled personnel. 
l ewis’s financial performance is expected 
to be both cash generative and accretive 
to Renew’s Engineering Services operating 
margin in the 2013/14 financial year.
  Engineering Services up 
9% in revenue to £232.4m 
(2012: £214.1m).
  t he Group’s contracted 
order book at 30 September 
2013 stood at £4 16m (201 2: 
£331m), a 26% increase, with 
the Engineering Services 
order book up 28% to 
£301m (2012: £235m). 
  t he Group has returned to 
a net cash position of £2.8m 
(2012: net debt £5.5m).
  l ewis Civil Engineering 
acquired for £8.2m in cash.
  Full year dividend increased 
by 14%.

06 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Dividend
t he Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 2.50p per share, increasing the full year 
dividend by 14% to 3.60p (2012: 3.15p). 
t he dividend will be paid on 3 March 2014 
to shareholders on the register as at 
31 January 2014. t he Board intends to 
continue to grow dividends progressively.
Outlook
t he Group enters the 2013/14 financial year 
in a strong position. In Specialist Building 
the Group operates in two discrete market 
sectors that have strong fundamentals 
and in which we have particular experience 
and expertise. In Engineering Services, the 
Group is expanding its position as a leading 
provider of engineering support services 
in the uK’s Energy, Environmental and 
Infrastructure markets. t hese markets 
are mainly regulated and the critical assets 
are maintained by programmes of essential 
non-discretionary spending. t he Group 
continues to focus its activities on these 
programmes which provide both good 
visibility of future opportunities and 
sustainable earnings streams. 
It remains the Board’s strategy to 
grow the business, both organically 
and by selective acquisitions, developing 
Renew’s position as a leading medium 
sized engineering support services group. 
t he Board’s ambition is to grow Group 
revenue to over £500m, an achievement 
which continues to be likely to require 
further acquisitions. t he Board continues 
to set challenging performance targets 
and believes that over the next three 
years the Group can increase its 
Engineering Services business operating 
margins to 5% whilst maintaining Specialist 
Building performance in line with that 
currently being achieved. t he Group’s 
successful acquisition record combined 
with these strong results and net cash 
position, together with the record forward 
order book indicate that Renew is well 
placed to achieve these targets.

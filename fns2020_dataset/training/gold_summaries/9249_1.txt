Chief Executive’s review
Overview
Laird is a leader in the design, 
manufacture and supply of 
customised, performance critical 
products, systems and controls 
for wireless and other advanced 
electronic applications. We design, 
develop and supply the technology 
that allows people, organisations, 
industrial applications and electronic 
devices to connect eff iciently, locally 
and globally. We provide technology
for a connected world. 
In 2010 we began the recovery from 
the global recession and associated 
credit constraints that prevailed during 
the second half of 2008 and during 
2009. We saw the benefits of the 
decisive actions we took during that 
period to reduce costs, and from our 
decisions to maintain engineering 
and R&D expenditure. This allowed 
us to increase our new product 
development, broaden our customer 
base, and improve our operating 
margins, resulting in underlying pre-tax 
profits growing by more than 50%. 
Through our acquisition of Cattron 
Group International Inc. (“Cattron”) 
late in 2010, we have expanded into 
the wireless systems and controls 
area which brings with it services and 
aftermarket revenues. This acquisition 
will form a base for further expansion 
into other “vertical markets” with 
requirements for hardware, software 
and systems applications.
We are well placed to make further 
good progress during 2011.
Results
Revenue from continuing operations in 
2010 was £567 .4 million, up 7% (2009, 
£528.8 million). Excluding Mechanisms 
whose closure was announced at the 
half year, revenues increased 15% in 
the year. T otal revenues in the second 
half of 2010 were up 7% on those in 
the first half expressed in Sterling. 
We saw good growth in 2010 
compared to 2009 in both our 
Performance Materials and Wireless 
Systems divisions. 
 
Sales to our largest OEM customer 
in 2010 accounted for 19% of 
total revenues (2009, 40%). This 
percentage is expected to reduce 
further to between 10% and 15% 
of total revenues in 2011, and is 
expected to stabilise in this range by 
the end of this year. We have grown 
all other revenues by 44% in the year, 
broadening our customer base, in 
particular with a leading supplier 
of smartphones and tablets.
Underlying operating profit from 
continuing operations was £46.4 
million in 2010, up 38% (2009, £33.6 
million). Operating margin was 8.2%, 
up from 6.4% in 2009. The operating 
profit in the second half of 2010, at 
£27 .9 million, grew strongly compared 
with the £18.5 million in the first half. 
Underlying operating margin in the 
second half of the year was 9.5%, 
compared with 6.7% in the first half.
Underlying profit before tax from 
continuing operations was £40.2 
million in 2010, up 52% (2009, £26.5 
million). We believe this to be a very 
creditable result, given the significant 
reduction in revenues from our largest 
customer, rising China labour costs, 
and the adverse eff ects of exchange 
rate movements.
We announced the closure of our 
Mechanisms business at the half 
year, and subsequently undertook 
restructuring actions including 
headcount reductions and the 
consolidation of manufacturing 
facilities, particularly in respect of 
handset antennae and the combining 
of our EMI shielding and handset 
metals product lines. These actions 
resulted in exceptional costs from 
continuing operations of £36.9 million 
being incurred in the year, of which £21.1 
million were non cash costs, principally 
asset impairment charges arising 
from the closure of the Mechanisms

2010 Revenue
business. Exceptional cash spend in the 
year was £6.9 million, including cash 
spent on exceptional items provided 
for in 2009, and cash spend on 
these items in 2011 will be £11.1 million. 
Annualised savings are expected to 
be approximately £10 million.
Statutory loss before tax from 
continuing operations in 2010, after 
exceptional items, the amortisation 
of acquired intangibles, the gain or 
loss on the disposal of businesses 
and the fair valuing of financial 
instruments, was £8.6 million 
(2009, £4.6 million profit).
We again focused strongly on cash 
generation in 2010, limiting the 
working capital outflows despite 
revenue growth, and with capital 
expenditure held below depreciation. 
Operating cash flow after capital 
expenditure from continuing 
operations was £41.2 million (2009, 
£49.7 million). Cash conversion after 
capital expenditure was healthy at 
89% despite the volume and revenue 
growth (2009, 148%, reflecting the 
marked fall off  in revenues in that year 
compared to 2008).
Net borrowings at 31 December 2010 
were £103.6 million (2009, £45.4 
million), with the increase largely 
due to the acquisition of Cattron in 
November 2010. Net debt to EBITDA 
at year end was a very comfortable 
1.4 times, giving both balance sheet 
strength to withstand any external 
shocks, as well as headroom to pursue 
additional value added acquisitions.
Underlying earnings per share from 
continuing operations were 11.8 pence, 
up 23% (2009, 9.6 pence, adjusted 
for the bonus element of the October 
2009 rights issue), reflecting the higher 
profits off set by the greater number 
of shares in issue.

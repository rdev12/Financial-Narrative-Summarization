Genetix	 Group	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 &	 Accounts	 2005
“ We made significant 
progress in establishing 
our new cell biology 
products in the 
growing area of 
biopharmaceuticals.”
We made significant progress in 
establishing our new cell biology 
products as our key area of focus in  
the growing area of biopharmaceuticals. 
With profit before tax increasing  
by 72% to £2.3 million, results have 
been encouraging as the Group’s new 
products penetrate these exciting new 
markets. This healthy performance, 
being broadly in line with expectations, 
endorses our underlying strategy.
Our new cell biology products, the 
ClonePix
FL
 and CloneSelect range  
of instruments targeted at the 
biopharmaceutical sector, have  
been successfully introduced and are 
now selling throughout the world. 
Customers have responded very 
favourably by engaging with our in-
house scientists carrying out proof  
of principle experiments. These 
collaborations should accelerate  
the uptake of our new products and 
enhance further product development 
opportunities in this emerging area. 
These products from Genetix have 
been shown not only to play an 
important role in the development  
of new healthcare products, but also  
to deliver significant cost benefits to 
our customers when compared to 
existing instrumentation. 
The role of Chief Operating Officer 
recently became redundant and we 
would like to thank Trevor Bell, who 
left Genetix on 11 January 2006, for 
improvements made to the organisation, 
some of which are referred to above.  
In addition, the recruitment of a  
Finance Director to replace Gary Corsi, 
who left the Group at the end of January 
2006, has been completed with the 
appointment of Andrew Kellett who 
joins us from Quest Diagnostics Inc. 
Andrew will take up his appointment  
on 27 March 2006.
We wish Gary and Trevor every success 
for their future careers. 
The Board has considered whether  
the Group’s interests would be better 
placed by having its shares quoted  
on AIM rather than the Official List. 
Following a review of the advantages 
and disadvantages of both exchanges 
the Board has concluded that it  
would be in the best interests of the 
Company’s shareholders as a whole  
for the Company’s stock market 
quotation to be moved to AIM. It is  
the Board’s view that AIM represents a 
more flexible environment in which to 
achieve the Group’s objectives and to 
reduce costs and formalities relating to 
maintaining a market in its shares and 
undertaking transactions in the future.
The process of transferring from the 
Official List to AIM has commenced 
and further details will be included in  
a Circular to be posted to shareholders 
in due course. Our intention is to post 
the requisite Circular to shareholders 
on the same day that the Annual 
Report and Accounts are distributed. 
The approval of the Company’s 
shareholders will be required to effect 
the transfer to AIM and our intention  
is to convene an Extraordinary General 
Meeting for the same day as the 
Annual General Meeting which is 
planned for 3 May 2006.
Finally, we thank all staff for their 
unstinting efforts over the year. 
Genetix is fortunate in having a 
committed, flexible and highly 
professional workforce. We are  
very proud of what they have  
achieved and I would like to  
thank them and acknowledge  
their significant contribution.

Growth
For Shire, growth is both a means 
and an end. Sustained high growth 
across all our business units enables 
us to fuel further R&D and in turn 
develop innovative new products 
for patients with unmet needs. 
Growth drives our revenues and 
proﬁ ts. It adds to our momentum. 
Growth, too, is a great marker of our 
progress, as we strive to achieve our 
10 x 20 target to double our product 
sales

Review of the Year
I am pleased to report that Phoenix IT Group plc has delivered good
results in 2008 against a backdrop of significant change during the
year . Following the Group’s largest acquisition to date, that of ICM
Computer Group plc in May 2007 , an integration review and
planning exercise was undertaken and the resulting integration
programme is nearing completion. As a result the Group is well
placed in each of the markets that it serves and enters the new
financial year in a strong position.
Results
Group revenues increased by 82.1% to £230.8m (2007: £126.7m)
and operating profit before non-recurring items and amortisation
of acquired intangibles increased by 45.4% to £33.0m (2007:
£22.7m). Profit from operations (after amortisation of acquired
intangibles) increased by 13.1% to £23.4m (2007: £20.7m). The
Group has continued to be highly cash generative during the year
with the free cash flow increasing by 26.2% to £29.7m (2007:
£23.6m).

Dividend
The Board recommends a proposed final dividend of 3.65p (2007:
second interim dividend of 3.17 4p), which, if approved at the Annual
General Meeting, will be paid on 1 October 2008. Combined with
the interim dividend of 1.83p paid in January 2008, this makes a
total dividend per share of 5.48p (2007: 4.764p), an increase of 15%. 
Board Changes 
During the year we announced that Nick Robinson stepped down as
Chief Executive Officer and became Non-Executive Deputy
Chairman from 1 January 2008. Nick joined the business in its
earliest years and has been instrumental in its successful growth
and development. He remains a substantial shareholder and I am
very glad that the Group will continue to benefit from his
involvement on the Board.
I became Executive Chairman on 22 November 2007 after serving
as Non-Executive Chairman since 21 October 2004. It is currently
expected that I will remain in this role until 31 December 2008
when I will revert to Non-Executive Chairman.
Jeremy Stafford, who has served as Chief Operating Officer since
24 April 2007 , became Chief Executive from 31 March 2008.
Employees
We are fortunate to have a strong team of talented and
hardworking people in the Group who have delivered the successful
performance achieved in the year and I thank them all on behalf of
the Board and the shareholders. I am also pleased to formally
welcome the management and staff of ICM to Phoenix IT Group.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Group’s registered
office, Technology House, Hunsbury Hill Avenue, Northampton on
Thursday, 14 August at 10.30 a.m. 
Summary
The integration phase is nearing completion and the Group is
confident that the new structure will not only deliver the
anticipated synergy cost savings in the next financial year but also
provide a platform for growth for each of the business units.

Financial overview
The termination of the TroVax collaboration in April 2009 and the revised strategy for TroVax development following the FDA review of the TRIST study
in June 2009 had a material effect on the Company, and resulted in a £6.0 million exceptional profit in the statement of comprehensive income. In
contrast, in 2008 we recognised an exceptional loss of £4.6 million from impairment of intangible assets. Before exceptional items, revenue for 2009 was
£9.0 million (2008: £18.4 million) and costs (cost of sales, research and development costs and administrative expenses were significantly reduced at
£20.9 million (2008: £27.6 million).
Cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets increased by £3.4 million in 2009, leaving a balance of £25.3 million at 31 December 2009.

Total revenue 19,120 18,394 7,219 760 824
Non-exceptional TroVax revenue of £2.6 million in 2009 comprised the recognition of deferred income up to the termination of the collaboration
in April 2009.The remaining £5.7 million of deferred TroVax income was recognised in 2009 as exceptional revenue. A termination payment of
US$6.5 million (£4.4 million) paid by sanofi-aventis made up the remainder of exceptional revenue.
The ocular collaboration with sanofi-aventis contributed revenue of £6.2 million in 2009.The collaboration has two elements: an upfront payment of
US$26 million (£16.6 million) was received in 2009, and R&D funding of up to US$24 million will be receivable over the current phase of the collaboration.
Revenue recognised in 2009 comprised £3.1 million of the upfront payment and £3.1 million of R&D funding. Deferred income of £13.7 million is
expected to be recognised between 2011 and 2013.
Cost of sales £437,000 (2008: £1,295,000)

Exceptional cost of sales 527 –– ––
Total cost of sales 437 1,295 449 ––
Cost of sales is the royalty payable to third party licensors attributable to upfront and milestone payments that are recognised as revenue.Where the
recognition of upfront and/or milestone payments is deferred in part or in full, the appropriate proportion of cost of sales is also deferred and is
classified as a prepayment. In 2009 a credit of £545,000 was recognised within non-exceptional cost of sales following a reduction in the estimated
royalty rate that had been applied to TroVax collaboration revenue in 2007 and 2008.

Financial Review
Andrew Wood, Chief Financial Officer
“We maintained our financial strength through 2009,
making the transition from the TroVax collaboration
with sanofi-aventis that had been a key feature of the
financial results for the two previous years, to the new
ocular collaboration in 2009.The cash inflows associated
with the sanofi-aventis collaborations, together with
continuing careful focus on expenditure, resulted in
a stronger cash balance at the end of 2009 than at
the beginning.”
Our present funds, together with licence income and
anticipated revenues from current collaborations, are
sufficient to meet operational needs until the beginning
of 2012.This gives the Group a strong platform from
which to build a profitable, sustainable business.

Total non-exceptional operating expenses 20,955 26,322 26,424 22,222 12,192
Non-exceptional operating expenses were £5.4 million lower than 2008 at £21.0 million.The reduction in R&D costs came mainly from lower external
clinical costs, and in particular from lower TRIST expenditure. Costs incurred in the sanofi-aventis ocular programme are included in R&D costs.
The increase in expenditure on these products has offset some of the reduction in TroVax expenditure. Administrative expenses increased in 2009,
principally due to foreign exchange losses, bonus payments and legal costs related to patent litigation.
Research & development costs £14,899,000 (2008: £22,482,000)
2009 2008 2007 2006 2005

Total non-exceptional research & development costs 14,899 22,482 22,142 19,523 9,327
R&D costs comprise in-house expenditure (staff, R&D consumables, intellectual property, facilities and depreciation of R&D assets) and external costs
(preclinical studies, GMP manufacturing, regulatory affairs, and clinical trials). External clinical and preclinical costs from 2006 to 2008 had been high due
to TroVax development costs, particularly costs of the TRIST study. As expected, these costs fell back significantly in 2009, with non-exceptional external
TroVax development costs recognised in 2009 down to £0.7 million compared to £10.0 million in 2008. Costs related to the TRIST study from June 2009
onwards are part of exceptional R&D costs. Offsetting some of the reduction, ocular product and ProSavin external costs were £2.7 million higher in
2009 at £5.2 million. Most of the 2009 ocular programme spend was covered by R&D funding from sanofi-aventis. In-house R&D costs in 2009 were 6%
lower than in 2008 at £8.1 million.

Administrative expenses in 2009 were overall £2.2 million (58%) higher than 2008. Foreign exchange losses account for £1.2 million of the increase.
The exchange loss of £0.5 million in 2009 was mainly due to weakening of the US dollar over the course of the year. In 2008 foreign exchange gains of
£0.7 million were recognised. Administrative staff costs were £0.8 million (40%) higher than 2008 at £2.8 million, due mostly to bonuses. 2009 bonuses
included £0.3 million costs in relation to a share-settled bonus paid to John Dawson, Chief Executive Officer.There were no bonuses in 2008. Legal costs
in 2009 were £0.5 million higher than 2008 at £1.4 million. £1.0 million of the 2009 legal costs related to the Bavarian Nordic litigation and patent
oppositions. In January 2010 the Bavarian Nordic litigation was settled.

In 2009 there was a net reduction in headcount of 11, continuing a downward trend that started in July 2008 following the TRIST setback. Subsequent to
the year end this trend has begun to reverse, with a net gain of 4 in January and February 2010. One full-time employee and one part-time employee
are based at the wholly owned subsidiary, BioMedica Inc, in San Diego, USA. All other staff are based at the main offices and laboratories in Oxford, UK.

Exceptional items are described fully in note 5 to the financial statements. On termination of the TroVax collaboration with sanofi-aventis, net
unrecoverable costs of £0.8 million were written off.This is net of receipts of US$10.9 million (£7.2 million) – reimbursements by sanofi-aventis as part of
the termination process. Following the FDA review of TRIST in June 2009 and the revision of the development strategy for TroVax, £2.2 million was
provided to meet the costs of closing out the TRIST study, and £0.5 million of expenses related to the planned Quasar TroVax clinical trial were written off.
Between June 2009 and the end of the year, costs of £1.4 million were incurred and set against the TRIST provision.

The Group places its cash in bank deposits for periods of up to 12 months and generates interest on those deposits.The maturity profile of deposits is
intended to match planned expenditure. As expected, the dramatic fall in market rates from the end of 2008 has resulted in much lower interest income
in 2009.The Group has no debt, but is recognising as a finance expense the discount on a lease provision and a dilapidation provision.The lower charge
in 2009 reflects the level of interest rates in the year.

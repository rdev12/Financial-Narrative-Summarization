 4 Healthcare Locums
Last year saw significant growth 
for HCL both through the
acquisition of RS Locums, and
strong organic growth across all
other divisions. The management
has successfully completed 
two further acquisitions in the 
first quarter of 2006, which will
enhance HCL’s ability to provide
medical and social care staff. 
The acquisitions will also extend
HCL’s ability to provide locum
General Practitioners, an area 
that the Company expects to
grow significantly over the next
twelve months. All acquisitions
have been fully integrated into
the HCL group, which continues
to operate from two call centre
sites, supported by four small
regional satellite offices.
HCL operates in an increasingly
regulated NHS market, and 
has recognised that this market 
has proved difficult for many
smaller companies lacking the
infrastructure to meet the needs 
of NHS contracts. HCL has
capitalised on this opportunity 
and in so doing has gained
market share. The Company has
also been working closely with 
the private sector, especially those
involved with the Government’s
Independent Sector Treatment
Centre Programme (ISTCs). HCL
is now involved in a number of
campaigns in support of private
sector providers to recruit both
permanent and locum staff 
to service the government’s 
ISTC contracts.
The Company has seen a shift
towards more permanent
placement requirements in both
the NHS and private sector, and
this has had a positive effect 
on the gross margins achieved
across the group. We anticipate
that this trend will continue into
2007 and for the foreseeable
future. HCL’s strategy is to remain
in the high margin niche specialist
healthcare and social care
markets operating mainly from 
its two call centre sites. This
approach will minimise costs and
maintain high net margins.
We expect that the market 
will continue to favour larger
operators. Healthcare Locums
whilst only in its third year of
trading, is already the third largest
specialist provider of healthcare
staff in the UK. It is also 
the fastest growing specialist
healthcare staffing company in 
the UK and it remains well
positioned in this market 
to meet the ever changing
needs of the NHS and private 
healthcare markets.

Chairman’s statement
I am delighted to announce the inaugural preliminary results for
Healthcare Locums PLC (HCL) for 2005 which are in line with our
expectations. HCL was successfully admitted to AIM in November
last year, and raised £15m of new money for the Company which
was used to reduce the Company’s financial gearing and put 
HCL in a strong position going forward into 2006.

2016: a transformative year 
While progress since we listed on the London 
stock exchange has been rapid, 2016 
proved to be a year of transformation for 
the Group with a number of important 
milestones being achieved 
>  In May, we acquired InVesting B.V. in the 
Netherlands and Belgium, a market leader 
in consumer credit and secured 
capabilities, financed via a €230 million 
public bond offering
>  In July, we refinanced our £180 million 
revolving credit facility, reducing the margin 
by 100bps and extending the term for five 
years through to July 2021 
>  In August, we received our full FCA 
authorisation in the UK 
>  In August, our credit rating was upgraded 
to BB- by Standard and Poor’s, reflecting  
our commitment to maintaining a strong 
financial profile
>  In September, we refinanced our £220 million 
bond, reducing the cost by 275bps and 
extending the term for eight years to 2024
>  In September, we announced a landmark 
deal in the Netherlands where we co-invested 
£21.3 million to purchase and service  
€1.7 billion of high-quality secured real-estate 
assets from RNHB Hypotheekbank  
(a subsidiary of Rabobank). This added 
specialist servicing expertise to our  
market leading Dutch offering 
>  In December, we agreed our intention to 
purchase Zenith Service S.p.A., a master 
servicing business in the highly attractive 
Italian market, we expect to complete  
in H1 2017
>  In February 2017, our credit rating was 
upgraded to Ba3 by Moody’s and we  
increased our revolving credit facility to  
£215 million across five banks

Group results
I am pleased to report that Morgan Crucible 
has delivered another healthy set of ﬁnancial 
results in 2008 against the backdrop of an 
increasingly difﬁcult economic environment. 
Group revenues were up 20.5% on last
year at £835.0 million. For the ﬁrst time 
in a number of years, currency translation 
effects have actually been in our favour on 
the income statement with our reported 
ﬁnancials beneﬁting from the strength of 
the US dollar and the euro against sterling. 
We also saw nine months of good ﬁnancial 
contribution from the advanced ceramics 
businesses acquired from Carpenter 
Technology Corporation at the end 
of March.
Overall organic sales growth, that is to say 
excluding the additional revenue from these 
acquired businesses, was a very respectable 
4% on a constant currency basis.
This revenue growth, allied with strong 
ongoing operational management of the 
cost base, helped the Group to show 
continued improvement in proﬁt margins 
despite the headwinds caused by inﬂationary 
pressures in raw material and energy costs. 
Underlying operating proﬁt margins for the 
year were a healthy 11.8% compared to 
11.4% in 2007. Our goal as a Group remains 
mid-teen operating proﬁt margins in good 
times and double digit in bad times.
Pre-tax proﬁt for the Group was £82.8 million; 
up 15.5% on the prior year. Underlying 
earnings per share at 23.4 pence compared 
to 19.7 pence last year also showed double 
digit levels of year on year growth.
Divisional highlights
Given the increasingly challenging market 
environment in 2008 it is pleasing to report 
that all three Divisions delivered year-on-year 
increases in sales and operating proﬁts.
Progress was particularly encouraging in the 
Insulating Ceramics Division – the Group’s 
largest Division by revenue – which saw 
revenues rise 18.2% from £324.0 million 
to £382.9 million; 6.1% on a constant 
currency basis. This was driven in particular 
by large project orders into the chemical 
John brings a wealth of experience to the 
role on the back of his 18 years service with 
Morgan Crucible during which time he has 
lived and worked across the globe for the 
Group in a range of different roles and 
businesses. John replaces Phil Wright who, 
after 16 years of loyal and committed service 
to Morgan Crucible, retired from the Group 
at the end of the year. Phil has successfully 
brought about signiﬁcant changes to the 
manufacturing footprint of the Molten Metal 
Systems business leaving it well positioned 
for the future. I would like to thank Phil 
personally for all of his contributions over 
the years.
Looking forward
Unprecedented volatility in the global 
economy clearly makes it much more 
difﬁcult than usual to forecast the demand 
outlook accurately. However, our ongoing 
strategy of moving towards less economically 
cyclical markets has successfully reduced 
the Group’s exposure to some of the sectors 
which came under particular pressure in 
the latter half of 2008 such as automotive, 
consumer goods and semiconductors. 
Demand in markets such as defence and 
medical remained strong which to date has 
offset the softening we have seen in some 
sectors which are more aligned with the 
general industrial cycle. In those markets 
where we have seen weakening demand 
we have taken decisive actions to reduce 
the cost base. Going forward, we remain 
watchful and prepared to respond 
proactively to any other signs of slowdowns 
in our end markets as they emerge. 
The general economic environment is 
clearly more difﬁcult now than it has been 
for many years but I remain conﬁdent that 
Morgan Crucible is a higher quality, more 
resilient business than in the past. As we 
look to the future, we are committed to 
demonstrating this quality and resilience 
over the next 12 months.

and petroleum markets along with robust 
demand in emerging market economies. 
The focus on operational excellence in 
the Division through the World Class 
Manufacturing (WCM) programme yielded 
good improvements in our manufacturing 
processes. Our commitment to remaining 
at the forefront of world technical leadership 
in the insulating ceramics ﬁeld was 
underpinned by the opening of a new 
global R&D centre in Bromborough, UK.
The Technical Ceramics Division also had 
an excellent year with revenues up from 
£152.6 million in 2007 to £212.2 million 
in 2008, representing 3.3% growth on 
a constant currency basis and excluding 
acquisitions. There was good progress in 
the underlying business particularly in 
medical market applications with divisional 
performance also bolstered by the new 
revenue and earnings stream from the 
Carpenter businesses. I am pleased to 
report that these newly acquired businesses 
– which predominantly serve the aerospace 
and power generation markets – have 
delivered an excellent set of results in 
their ﬁrst nine months with the Group.
The Carbon Division also reported 
year on year growth in revenues and 
operating proﬁts. Revenues increased 
from £216.6 million to £239.9 million; 
representing 1.3% growth on a constant 
currency basis. This revenue progress was 
achieved despite delays to the US military 
procurement programme for the next 
generation of US body armour, X-SAPI. 
Encouragingly, the NP Aerospace business in 
which we acquired a 49% equity stake last 
year ﬁnished a very successful 2008 with a 
strong order book for 2009 having secured 
additional contracts from the UK military for 
vehicle armouring applications. 
Management
A major priority for me as Group Chief 
Executive remains to continue to develop 
and enhance the senior management team 
of Morgan Crucible with the next generation 
of home grown talent. I am therefore 
delighted to report that John Maxwell 
was appointed CEO of the Molten Metal 
Systems business unit (formerly known as 
the Crucibles business) on 1 October 2008.

progress

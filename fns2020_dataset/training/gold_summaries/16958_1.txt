Chief Executive’s review 
 
Overview 
 
The main challenges that faced Weatherly during the year ended 30 June 2008 were volatile commodity prices and the 
security of power supply in southern Africa. Our response was to position the company to deal with these issues by 
investing capital to increase production and reduce operating costs, and by installing back-up power supplies. 
Weatherly’s main assets have been the copper mines and smelter acquired from their former owner, Ongopolo.  
 
By the financial year-end four mines were operational - the fifth, Kombat, having been suspended due to power 
shortages - and the first phase of the Tsumeb smelter expansion was performing according to schedule. However, 
further falls in the copper price post year end led to the closure of Tsumeb West and the placement of our remaining 
three mines on care and maintenance pending an improvement in prices. The smelter continued to operate on a 
standalone basis to process processing imported concentrates.   
 
 
Financial review 
 
In the year ended 30 June 2008, the company’s revenues increased 67% from US$63.1 million to US$105.5 million. 
Gross profit was US$5.1 million (2007: US$ 7.21 million). Net loss, due to the asset impairment of all mines and other 
assets written down of US$50.84 million, was US$54.07 million or US 13.15 cents per basic share. Cash in the bank as 
at 30 June 2008 was US$5.4 million. As at 31 January 2009, the company had cash in the bank of US$2.4million.  
 
In April 2008, Weatherly completed a US$12 million fundraising by the issue of secured convertible loan notes. The 
proceeds of the fundraising were used to complete the Tambao feasibility study and to upgrade existing assets in 
Namibia, including the refurbishment of diesel generators to provide Weatherly with alternative sources of power to the 
national grid.  
 
Operational review 
 
Weatherly operates as a holding company for its mining arm, Weatherly Mining Namibia (“WMN”), and its smelting arm, 
Namibia Custom Smelters (“NCS”).  
 
Mining 
 
Weatherly Mining Namibia’s mines fed three concentration plants located in the central and northern regions of Namibia. 
Combined milling capacity was approximately two million tonnes of ore per annum, of which less than two thirds were 
being utilised. Our short to medium term strategy was to expand the production of the existing mines and to develop new 
satellite mines to fully utilise the available capacity.

As stated above, the Kombat Operations were closed as a result of flooding caused by irregular power supply from 
NamPower, which led to the decision to shut the mine. In October 2008, following a sharp fall in the copper price, 
Tsumeb West was closed and Matchless placed on care and maintenance . Further price falls led to similar measures 
being taken at Otjihase and Tschudi in November 2008, with the last day of operations being 20 December 2008. These 
properties will remain on care and maintenance until copper prices recover sufficiently to make resumption of mining 
operations economically viable.  
 
Tsumeb Tailings (Weatherly 50%, Everclear Solutions Inc. 50%) 
Weatherly is working with joint venture partners Everclear Solutions Inc. (Everclear) to recover copper, lead, zinc and 
silver from the Tsumeb tailings dam. During the financial year, Everclear successfully demonstrated its proprietary 
technology on a bench scale basis, and then moved to construct a small plant on site. Everclear was again able to 
demonstrate that the process, technically at least, is capable of electro-winning copper and other metals from the tailings. 
Everclear intends to install a larger plant on site in 2009 to demonstrate both the commercial and technical aspects as a 
prelude to a full feasibility study.  
 
Zambia 
Both the application for the extension of PLLS 252 (exploration licence) and the granting of a retention licence for PLLS 
240(tailings project) have been rejected and, as a consequence, the Zambian assets have been written down to zero. 
 
We continue to pursue our legal rights to licence area PLLS 239 (old Luanshya copper mines), which was granted by the 
Republic of Zambia’s Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development in April 2005 to our wholly owned subsidiary, Puku 
Minerals Limited. The case has been completed and the judgment is awaited.  The book value of this licence was written 
off in previous years and significant uncertainty still exists over whether renewal will be granted. 
 
Burkina Faso 
The company is involved in the development of a high-grade manganese deposit in Burkina Faso through its Dubai 
partner, Wadi Al Rawda Industrial Developments (Wadi). Weatherly assisted Wadi in the preparation of a feasibility study 
which has been submitted to the Burkina Faso government for assessment, together with an Environmental Impact 
Statement and an application for a mining licence.   
 
Reserves and resources 
The mine reserves, resources and historical reserves are contained in tables on page 10. Tables A and B have been

Early in 2007, the decision was taken to change the operating philosophy of the Tsumeb smelter. Historically, it had been 
an integral part of the mining operations and in 2006 Weatherly rebuilt the small reverbatory furnace to accommodate its 
own mine production. The furnace operated effectively but, because of its small throughput, had relatively high operating 
costs. In order to reduce costs and fully utilise the existing infrastructure of the original, much larger plant, it was decided 
to expand the plant using imported concentrates to supplement internal production. The company targeted concentrates 
that would warrant a premium to be processed; such concentrates are typically low in copper and high in precious metals 
(gold and silver) and contain penalty elements such as arsenic. 
 
As a result of this decision, Weatherly created Namibia Custom Smelters to operate as a stand-alone and profitable 
custom smelter. The process was initiated through: 
 
• Commitment to capital expenditure of approximately US$10 million to convert an existing top submerged lance 
furnace from lead to copper smelting;  
• Signing of long-term contracts with two suppliers – Chelopech Mining EAD (“Chelopech”), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Dundee Precious Metals (“DPM”) from its mine in Bulgaria and Louis Dreyfus Commodities Metal 
Suisse SA (“Louis Dreyfus”) for concentrates from Peru; 
• Signing of “back to back” contracts with several international chemical companies for the sale of arsenic trioxide 
(the refined by-product from smelting); 
• Restructuring the smelting workforce to meet the new challenges of an independent smelting business. This 
involved a top-down reorganisation with a number of redundancies and re-deployments as well as new recruits 
to operate the new furnace. This was successfully completed in late 2007. 
 
The first concentrates from Bulgaria and Peru were trialled in February and May 2008 respectively, using the existing 
reverbatory furnace as an interim measure before the Ausmelt furnace became operational. Since the financial year end, 
the Ausmelt furnace has been commissioned and is now fully operational. Although delayed a number of times by the 
late arrival of key components and the renegotiation of commercial terms with concentrate suppliers, the project was 
completed within budget. Costs associated with the Ausmelt furnace are incremental which means that the smelter has, 
for the first time, the flexibility to deal with varying concentrate supply. 
 
The next important step will be the commissioning of the oxygen plant in early 2010, which is expected to increase 
capacity by a further 60% with an accompanying reduction in costs. This will be funded from the loan facility and from 
cash flow from the smelter.   
 
In December 2008, at the time of the completion of the loan facility, the three -year contracts with Chelopech and Louis 
Dreyfus Commodities were extended to five years ending December 2013. During this period, Louis Dreyfus will also be 
the exclusive offtaker of copper blister produced by the Tsumeb smelter. Under the terms of this contract, the smelter will 
process up to 120,000 dry metric tonnes (dmt) of concentrates in 2009, increasing to over 200,000 dmt from 2010 
onwards following commissioning of the oxygen plant.  
 
The terms of the US$12 million convertible loan note agreed with significant shareholders in May 2008 were renegotiated 
at this time. Repayment will now take place in three annual instalments with US$3 million due to be paid in May 2009, 
US$4 million in May 2010 and US$5 million in May 2011. The conversion price has been reduced from 23.5p to 8p and 
the noteholders have waived previous acts of default under the terms of the original note. The company can choose to 
delay the May 2009 instalment to 2010 but would pay interest at an increased rate of 18%pa. 
 
Marketing, sales and treasury 
 
Generally, Weatherly sells all its copper production on delivery to the Walvis Bay terminal to traders on a four-month 
forward London Metals Exchange (LME) price. All metal sales, concentrate purchases and tolling contracts were 
reviewed at the end of 2007 and new frame contracts were agreed with two trading houses, Republic House and Louis 
Dreyfus. The average weighted copper price achieved for 2007/08 was US$7,785 per tonne. Copper prices throughout 
the year ranged from a high of US$8,730 per tonne to a low of US$6,380 per tonne. Weatherly also sold 28,673 ounces 
of gold and 229,503 ounces of silver contained in the copper blister. Average gold price for the year was US$823 per 
ounce and silver US$15 per ounce. Precious metals accounted for 27% of revenue. 
 
Namibia is a rand currency area and local costs are affected by fluctuations in the rand/US dollar exchange rate. During 
2007/08, the average exchange rate was 7.312 with movements from 6.426 to 8.244.  
 
As at 30
 
June 2008, Weatherly held cash reserves (in sterling and US dollars) equivalent to US$5.4 million.  
 
The company maintained a copper floor price protection programme and, as at 30 June 2008, had in place “puts” for 800 
tonnes of copper per month until January 2009 at US$5,000 per tonne. These “puts” expired at the end of calendar year 
2008 and the company received payments of US$2.74 million in respect of these hedges.  WEATHERLY INTERNATIONAL PLC

Divestments 
 
In January 2008, Weatherly sold a series of options on its smelter slag dumps to AIM-quoted Emerging Metals Limited. 
EML has been created to acquire and develop minor and noble metals such as germanium, gallium and Indium which 
EML believes will become increasingly scarce as demand for these metals increases. The consideration was a 
combination of cash, shares in EML and options to acquire further shares in EML if certain criteria are met. The shares 
and options that were received as part of the consideration had, by 30 June 2008, increased in value by US$7.7 million.  
This amount is split between the options increase value of US$2.9 million which is put to the profit and loss and the share 
increase value of US$4.8 million put through to the equity reserve; a detailed explanation of this appears in note 21 to 
the financial statements. On 20 February 2009 the value of EML was 6p per share. If this had been the price at 30 June 
2008, it would have meant that a gain of US$0.3 million would have been put through the equity reserve account 
compared to the gain of US$4.7million put through at 30 June 2008.  
 
 
Safety record 
 
The number of lost time accidents increased in 2007/8 from the previous year which was an all-time low for these 
operations. Management is allocating increased resources to improve the situation, which has its roots in the safety 
culture prior to Weatherly’s involvement. Management is strongly committed to improving this situation in the coming 
year.

Environment  
 
Weatherly is committed to maintaining the highest environmental standards as part of its overall business philosophy. 
The gaseous emissions from the smelter are constantly monitored and it remains fully compliant with government and 
statutory requirements. During the forthcoming year, the company will be reviewing its environmental monitoring, 
management and reporting systems to ensure it continues to maintain the highest standards. 
 
Outlook 
 
Given the events since the end of the financial year, particularly the severe downturn in copper prices, the company has 
had to take a number of difficult actions in response. This has included the closure of its mines and establishment of the 
Tsumeb smelter as an independent business treating only imported concentrates. Copper prices are not expected to 
recover until there is a turnaround in the global economy and this could take some time. However, the completion of our 
$11.3 million loan facility of which US$3.9 million remained committed but undrawn as at 31 January 2009 will ensure 
funding for the smelter’s ongoing requirements and expansion programme, which will continue to generate revenue for 
the company.  
 
Weatherly’s immediate objectives are to ensure that all its Namibian mines and Namibian development projects are kept 
on care and maintenance in such a way that the full value of the assets is retained, and that the mines can reopen 
quickly should copper prices recover. The smelter will continue to generate substantial and sustainable profits, sufficient 
to meet its operating and debt servicing requirements.  
 
Weatherly intends to take advantage of the downturn to reassess its mine strategies, and to optimise its plans in advance 
of any resumption of mining activity whilst at the same time realising asset values as appropriate. On a corporate level, 
the company will be looking to advance its involvement in the promising manganese project in Burkina Faso and, subject 
to availability of funding, to acquire new resource assets in order to build a larger and stronger company in the long term. 
 
While the current severe downturn is an immediate setback to the company’s fortunes, it also presents potential 
competitive opportunities. The challenge for Weatherly and its management will be to make the most of those 
opportunities. In responding quickly to these tough market conditions and taking the decisive actions we have, I believe 
the company is well positioned to do so.

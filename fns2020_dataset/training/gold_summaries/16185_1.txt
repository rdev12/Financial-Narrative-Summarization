Strategic overview
Business model
In recent years our business model has been redeﬁned to address evolving trends in leisure 
travel. By deﬁning our customers in one of two ways we are able to anticipate their future 
preferences and leverage our position to tailor our offering accordingly.
• Leading brands
• Leveraging scale
• Online driven
• Experienced management teams
• Common technology platforms
1.  Global market 
trends
We actively seek to understand 
consumer needs, anticipate what 
they might demand in the future 
and move quickly to offer them  
the right product at the right time.
4.  Key success factors 
The key success factors form the backbone of our business model 
and enable us to cater efﬁciently to global trends while maintaining 
our leading market positions. Each of the categories, product driven 
and price driven, has a unique set of factors that make it thrive. 
There are, however, a few critical factors that transcend both. 
2.  Our customers 
Based on global market trends, we 
deﬁne our customers in two ways.
5.  Outcome 
Both propositions are focused  
on our vision of making travel  
experiences special. 
3.  Product 
characteristics
Product driven products satisfy 
the increasing demand for 
differentiated, exclusive, ﬂexible 
and experiential holidays that are 
unique to TUI Travel. Price driven 
products satisfy the demand for  
a broad range of holidays with 
competitive pricing.

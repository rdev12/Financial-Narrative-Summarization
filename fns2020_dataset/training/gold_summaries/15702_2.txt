THUS transformation
The integration of Y our Communications (YC) and Legend Communications (LC) which 
were acquired in February and March 2006 respectively, continues to proceed ahead of the
original plan. During the year we announced that the integration is now expected to deliver 
£30m of annualised savings (previously £25m) for expected implementation costs of less than
£25m (previously £30m).
The successful disposal of Demon Netherlands, in June 2006, marked another important milestone
and the consideration gave rise to a post-tax gain on sale of £29.0m. The proceeds received were
used to strengthen the Company’ s balance sheet and repay £30m of the secured loan.
Continuing operations
As a result of the acquisition of YC and LC and the disposal of Demon Netherlands, THUS 
records results for its continuing operations in four established segments comprising Managed
solutions (18% of 2007 revenue), Data and telecoms (59%), Internet (16%) and Mobile (7%).
Managed solutions are run as a separate unit within THUS. They comprise large corporate
accounts with complex service needs, typically combining delivery of several different standard
services, an element of outsource to THUS and longer than average contract duration.
In contrast, the Data and telecoms, Internet and Mobile segments record revenue and results 
for more standard product sales to a wide customer base including corporate, small and mid-
sized customers, channel resellers and other telecommunication companies.
Within each segment, the principal costs comprise payments to other telecommunication
companies for interconnect and use of their network to collect and deliver services to THUS
customers, other directly variable costs, directly attributable selling, distribution and administrative
costs and depreciation on assets directly attributable to that segment. 
However , as the majority of services are sold, provisioned and run from a unified infrastructure,
THUS maintains a large pool of central costs. In 2007 , these costs totalled £117.2m
1
(2006:
£91.7m
1
) and comprised £43.4m of depreciation, impairment and amortisation (2006: £41.5m),
£27.3m of network operations and maintenance costs (2006: £21.7m) and £46.5m of corporate
overheads (2006: £28.5m).

Excludes £1.6m of restructuring costs in 2007 (2006: £10.4m).

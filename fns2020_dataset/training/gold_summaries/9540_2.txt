[ 04] Performance Highlights
How we performed
in 2012:
• The Tragic Events at Marikana significantly impacted our operational and
financial results
– 110,000 ounces of mined Platinum lost
• Safety – unacceptably two fatalities, but an overall 11.7% improvement
in LTIFR to 4.16 per million hours worked
• Metal in concentrate production of 679,821 ounces of Platinum and
1,259,585 PGMs ounces
• Platinum sales of 701,831 ounces, PGMs sales of 1,383,945 ounces
• Revenue of $1,614 billion
• Underlying EBIT of $67 million
• Underlying Earnings Per Share of 7.4 US cents down 93.4%
• Net debt increased by 79.9% to $421 million
• Available ore reserve up 13.5% to 3.3 million square metres
• Improvements in grades and concentrator recoveries
• Number Two furnace commissioned on schedule and Number One Furnace
successfully modified and operating well
⁄ Reviewed growth strategy,
future production profile and
capital investment programme
as a result of continued
lacklustre short-term demand
of PGMs and the weak pricing
environment.

1 Underlying EBIT is calculated on profit for
the period excluding special items, as
noted on page 121 of this Report.
2 In 2009 we changed our reporting
methodology for ore reserve development,
in line with industry best practice, to
exclude partially developed ore reserves.
We have reported on this basis since then.
3 Lost time injury frequency rate, as measured
per million hours worked, is a key safety
performance indicator.

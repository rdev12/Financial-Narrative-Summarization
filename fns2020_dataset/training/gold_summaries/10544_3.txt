 Introduction
I am pleased to report a strong set of results.
We are successfully meeting our strategic
objectives for our two main business
streams. In Specialist Engineering we have
continued to grow revenue, which was
bolstered by a full year’s contribution from
Seymour, while in Specialist Building we saw
a marked increase in revenue and particularly
in operating profits prior to exceptional items.
Against a background of increasingly difficult
market conditions, the results again illustrate
the quality and sustainability of earnings with
our forward order book indicating an increased
level of work in our specialist sectors.
Results
Group revenue for the year ended 
30 September 2008 was £390.6m 
(2007: £348.1m), a 12% increase over the
corresponding period last year. Profit before
income tax for the year prior to exceptional
items and amortisation charges was up 29%
to £9.5m (2007: £7.4m). Profit after tax,
exceptional items and amortisation charges
was £5.3m (2007: £7.3m).
At 30 September 2008, the Group’s net cash
position stood at £28.2m (2007: £24.4m).
As has been well documented, conditions 
in the house building market, which is 
the principal end market for our Land
Remediation business, have worsened
considerably over the last six months. 
We are also seeing weaker market conditions
for our non-specialist and retail businesses
which jointly accounted for 46% of 
Specialist Building revenue in 2008.
As stated in our pre-close announcement on
1 October 2008, the Board has taken
decisive action to address these issues by
realigning the Land Remediation activities to
address the more robust regional civil
engineering market, whilst retaining its land
remediation capability. In Specialist Building,
the Group has reduced capacity by 15%.
Whilst these actions have resulted in an
exceptional charge in 2008 of £1.5m for
redundancy costs, the resultant saving in
annual costs will be in excess of £5m.
The Group’s order book at 30 September
2008 stood at £219m (2007: £252m) 
with, pleasingly, 79% represented by repeat
order work. The 13% reduction, which is
predominantly in non-specialist areas, is 
in line with the implemented capacity
reductions. This reflects our emphasis on
project selectivity and quality of earnings as
we seek to continue to improve percentage
operating margins in these more challenging
market conditions. 
Dividend
In accordance with the Group’s progressive
policy, a final dividend of 2.0p per share
(2007: 1.2p) is being proposed. This takes
the total dividend for the year to 3.0p 
(2007: 1.8p), a 67% increase over last year.
The dividend will be paid on 23 February
2009 to shareholders on the register as at 
30 January 2009 and in accordance with
accounting standards will be accounted for 
in the 2009 financial year. The shares will
become ex-dividend on 28 January 2009.
Growth strategy
Our declared strategy of focusing on two
distinct business streams, Specialist
Engineering and Specialist Building, remains
in place.
Our aim is to increase revenue in Specialist
Engineering both organically and by
acquisition, with operating margins of at least
4%. In Specialist Building, our aim is to
continue to increase operating margins with 
a medium-term target of 2%. Currently our
Specialist Building margin stands at 1.7%.
Our medium-term objective remains to
develop a Specialist Construction business
with overall operating margins of 2.5% and
with Specialist Engineering providing 33% 
of revenue.
Outlook
Market conditions are more challenging but
the Group is operating from a position of
strength, supported by a strong balance
sheet with cash resources available to take
advantage of carefully considered
opportunities which may arise. Our
management team, led by our Chief Executive
Brian May, is very experienced and I am
confident in their ability to deliver excellent
performance in the difficult economic climate.
The impact of the decisive action taken in
September to realign and reduce capacity,
and the continued resilience of our specialist
markets, gives the Board confidence that we
can continue to grow the Group’s operating
margin percentage albeit on reduced levels of
activity in 2009.

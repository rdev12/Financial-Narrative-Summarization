 A year of str ong
organic and
acquisitive gr owth
Chair man’s Statement
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Revenue increased to £437.8m (2007
£380.8m), driven by robust activity levels in
both divisions and acquisitive growth of
£18.5m. The Conveyor Belting ("CB")
Division experienced high levels of demand
in its major markets against a backdrop of
buoyant global coal markets. In the
Advanced Engineered Products ("AEP")
Division, overall high activity levels and
strong performances from the acquired
businesses were marginally tempered by
some softer markets in our Precision
Polymers businesses.
Operating profit before amortisation of
intangible assets acquired and exceptional
items increased to £49.3m (2007 £39.0m),
with the contribution from acquisitions
amounting to £4.1m.
Exceptional items of £3.4m (2007 £0.2m)
principally related to the costs associated
with the expansion of the heavyweight
conveyor belting business in North America
and the profit on disposal of its non-core
lightweight PVC conveyor belting operation. 
Operating profit was £43.8m (2007 £38.2m).
Net finance costs increased to £7.5m (2007
£4.6m) as a result of higher borrowings
relating to the Group’s strategic expansion.
The headline and underlying tax rates were
29% and 30% respectively. Adjusted
earnings per share before amortisation of
intangible assets acquired and exceptional
items was 17.5p per share (2007 15.1p).
Basic earnings per share amounted to 15.5p
per share (2007 15.0p).
Net cash from operations generated £45.7m
(2007 £53.3m) and included an investment
in working capital of £8.2m associated with
growth, with working capital ratios
maintained at prior year levels. Investing
activities amounted to £104.2m (2007
£35.4m), in accordance with our strategic
expansion plans. In part, this expansion was
funded by £35.4m of equity raised in March
2008 through the placing of 15.7m ordinary
shares. Net debt was £97.6m (2007
£36.3m), in line with expectations despite an
increase of £10.9m relating to the translation
of foreign currency borrowings. Interest
cover was 6.8 times (2007 8.9 times).
The Board is recommending a final dividend
of 4.4p per share which gives a total
distribution for the year of 6.6p per share
(2007 6.225p), a 6% increase on 2007.
ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENT
It is most encouraging to report on the major
growth initiatives around the Group. The
implementation of our strategic plan has
been successful with seven businesses
acquired during the year and one disposal.
After the year end, two further acquisitions
were completed. This reflects our plans
indicated in our share placing which was
announced in March 2008.
In November 2007, B-LOC in the US was
acquired by AEP for an initial consideration
of £4.4m with future contingent deferred
consideration estimated at £0.6m at the year
end. Its products extend and complement
our existing range of high value added,
proprietary drive solutions.
I am delighted to report on a year of strong organic and acquisitive growth. The
number of new businesses acquired has been unprecedented. These have performed
well in the period from acquisition and their contribution, when combined with
excellent results from our existing operations, has led to a 26% increase in operating
profit before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items.

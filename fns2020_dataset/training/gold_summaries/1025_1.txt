 Chief Executive’s review  
Anite is well positioned
for growth in the LTE market
Christopher Humphrey
Chief Executive
In the Travel division, as indicated in last 
year’s report, Norwich Union’s decision not 
to renew its contract for us to manage some 
of its IT services, together with the loss of 
customers as a result of them being acquired 
or going into liquidation, meant that revenue 
and profit were lower than in the previous 
year. In recognition of this, we reduced the 
cost base to align with the lower revenue. 
Revenue and profit were further affected 
when, in December 2009, the Globespan 
group went into administration. Despite the 
impact of these events on the business, we 
continued to develop our relationship with 
Europe’s largest travel operator, TUI, and 
expect to realise the benefit of that 
relationship over the next few years.
Our markets
Anite is structured into two market-facing 
divisions: Wireless and Travel. The Wireless 
division consists of two businesses. Handset 
Testing provides specialist systems, hardware 
and software to enable chipset and mobile 
phone manufacturers to design new mobile 
phone and data card devices efficiently, 
to begin selling products for testing  
LTE – the technology for the next-
generation of mobile phones – and, 
during the second six months of the year 
that, combined with some recovery in 
customers’ budgets, resulted in improved 
second-half revenue for both Handset 
Testing and Network Testing.
Over the years we have worked in 
partnership with a number of hardware 
suppliers, most recently Agilent, for 2G 
technology. Three years ago, we decided 
to collaborate with Agilent on the LTE 
hardware platform they were developing. 
Following delays in its development, 
however, we decided to end this partnership 
and to provide our own hardware, which 
we had been developing to test and 
demonstrate our LTE software while the 
main hardware platform was being finalised. 
This proprietary Anite hardware solution has 
now been developed into a final production 
model. It is being sold to, and is being 
well received by, key handset and chipset 
customers throughout the world. 
I am happy to report to you that despite 
a very demanding year the business is in 
good shape. We have continued to invest 
in our new products and, as a result, are 
well positioned to supply our markets as 
they start to improve.
Overview
The restricted financial environment 
had a significant affect on our Wireless 
customers’ spending in the first half of 
last year, but in the second half, the slight 
easing of economic conditions, combined 
with the availability of early stage 4G (LTE) 
hardware systems towards the end of the 
year, resulted in performance beginning 
to improve.
We continued to invest in new products 
throughout the financial year. In the 
Travel division, we continued to develop 
our @comRes software, and in the 
Wireless division we continued to invest 
in developing new products for Handset 
Testing. Our change in LTE hardware 
strategy enabled the Handsets business   6     Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010

Our automated solutions for development 
testing and conformance testing, which 
have a long lifespan and are easy to use, help 
manufacturers to reduce costs and show 
a clear return on investment, by enabling 
them to identify and resolve problems early 
in the development process. We are unique 
in allowing licences to be shared across R&D 
sites, and our common hardware platform 
enables solutions also to be used across 
departments. Our software reduces costs, 
and improves quality and time-to-market, 
by simulating true network conditions in the 
lab. In addition, because the large network

Handset Testing
New handsets and chipsets have to go 
through a series of compliance tests while 
they are being developed and before they 
can be launched onto the market. The 
Handset Testing business provides customers 
with the technology to test handsets’ 
viability by simulating the network and 
their conformance with industry standards, 
and their ability to interoperate with other 
devices across a wide range of networks.
and to bring them to the market quickly. 
Network Testing provides technology 
to enable Mobile Network Operators 
(MNOs), which build and operate mobile 
phone networks, to test the efficiency and 
effectiveness of their systems, and to carry 
out live testing with different makes of 
handsets to ensure a consistently high-
quality service for mobile phone users.
The Travel division provides industry-leading 
reservation and e-business systems to help 
leisure travel companies run their businesses 
profitably. These include tour operators,

our range of testing products extends back 
to the first-generation digital technology 
(2G). New mobile devices do not operate 
on a single technology and, consequently, 
devices must be able to switch seamlessly 
between all available technologies to 
maintain a connection. The need for legacy 
and new-generation technology to be 
present in one phone makes it very difficult 
for new entrants to the market to be able  
to provide a comprehensive product range.
In the past two to three years, the use of 
mobile phones and wireless-connected 
devices, including smartphones, data 
market each year, and the constant changes 
in mobile phone technology which, in turn, 
are driven by the continued growth in 
subscribers. In the 37 years since Motorola 
invented the first portable cellular phone, 
mobile phones have progressed from being 
the proverbial brick with an aerial, which 
could simply make and receive calls, to 
today’s tiny multi-function devices, while 
the number of subscribers has grown to 
approximately 4.6 billion – more than 60% 
of the world’s population. 
There have been multiple phone 
technologies launched in that time and 
devices perform on their networks, a number 
of them specify that manufacturers must 
validate their devices on an Anite tester. 
At the start of the design process, customers 
expect us to be technically innovative and 
responsive to their needs; while a large 
proportion buys our standard products,  
for major customers we are also able to 
offer a degree of customisation.
The principal drivers of the business are the 
evolution of new phone technology, the 
number of new handset models, data cards 
and “dongles” which are brought onto the 
Conformance toolset

that they comply with 
industry standards 
and deliver the service

for testing the widest 
range of technologies, 
from GSM to LTE.

the US and, during the year, we developed 
solutions for China’s own version of LTE, 
TD-LTE. This, we believe, will give us an 
advantage in the development of that 
testing market. Since the inception of LTE 
we have consistently led the conformance 
testing market and we currently lead the 
market in the development of conformance 
test cases. The conformance test market is 
driven by certification schemes administered 
by the standard setters (for example, GCF). 
The LTE certified scheme is expected to go 
live in early 2011 and around that time we 
expect the conformance testing market to 
begin to gather momentum. The industry 
has, so far, defined around 200 conformance 
tests for LTE, 100 of which we have already 
implemented and had validated by the 
standards setters – more than double  
that of our nearest competitor.
Network Testing
Our Network Testing business provides 
products for mobile network operators 
(MNOs) and network manufacturers to 
measure the coverage and quality of mobile 
phone networks. We provide a range of tools 
that can be used to check the performance 
of networks at different stages of their 
life cycles. Our tools can not only be used 
to measure the quality of radio frequency 
metrics, but also enable our customers  
to see how end users perceive the quality  
of the mobile phone networks using quality  
of service and end user metrics. 
During the year, we continued to increase 
sales coverage and now operate in more than 
90 countries, usually with local partners who 
also offer technical support to customers, 
and support all major network standards, 
including LTE. 
Our measurement tools are designed to meet 
the needs of all our end-customers, whatever 
their internal processes and however they 
choose to do their testing. They provide a 
a period of economic recession, has put 
pressure on the speed of the network roll-
out. Industry giants such as AT&T, China 
Mobile, Verizon and Vodafone are, however, 
now committed to being in the early wave 
of this investment and are requiring handset 
manufacturers – the majority of which are 
our customers – to prove the technology 
on their products; and that is where our 
handset testing solutions are increasingly 
used. Over the 12 months following the roll-
out of networks, 4G data devices (initially 
cards and dongles) will be sold, and will be 
followed by 4G phones and other devices. 
These data cards and phones all need similar 
amounts of testing.
Handset Testing strategy
We continue in our objective to position  
the Handset Testing business as a world 
leader in its field. To achieve that, we aim  
to complete our LTE solution, and to secure 
market penetration of all three testing 
phases – development, conformance and 
interoperability; to develop the range of 
products and tools we offer customers; 
and to increase sales to network 
operators, worldwide.
LTE is no exception to the rule that demand 
for more, and more powerful, applications 
drives advances in technology hardware;  
LTE is a complex standard and is particularly 
challenging. This is, of course, of benefit to 
us – new technology demands new handsets 
which need to be tested – but the evolution 
of the smartphone and other mobile devices 
is exerting severe pressure on the capacity  
of the world’s major mobile phone 
networks. There is, therefore, a compelling 
need for this technology. This is in direct 
contrast to 3G technology where no such 
powerful catalyst existed.
The lead of the US and China in LTE 
technology will also be of benefit to us 
since some of our biggest customers are in 
dongles, netbook and tablet computers – 
such as Apple’s iPad – has accelerated.  
The applications on these devices are data-
intensive, but the licensed spectra (network 
capacity) are fixed. These factors, combined 
with network operators’ desire to reduce 
costs – because traffic is increasing faster 
than revenue – has driven the need for a 
new, more efficient technology. 
LTE – which we have supported since its 
inception – is now accepted as being the 
most effective 4G technology to deliver 
the data capacity that is needed. It uses 
the spectrum extremely efficiently: more 
network users can be accommodated 
on the same cell space and it “pushes” 
data through the spectrum more quickly 
in efficient packets. Where 3G made it 
technically possible to access data, 4G  
will make it practically possible.
I wrote about the advent of 4G, essentially 
mobile broadband, in last year’s report. This 
has taken time to develop and, in today’s 
global market, the US and China have been 
particularly ambitious in its adoption. 
Within 4G there are two competing 
technologies, WiMAX and LTE. In 2007, we 
instigated our internal development process 
for LTE but, at the same time, recognised the 
need for us to be able to offer solutions for 
both technologies. With our own resources 
focused fully on LTE, we believed it was 
more appropriate to acquire a WiMAX 
capability, which we did in January 2007, to 
improve our offer in that area. As it became 
clearer, however, that LTE would be the 
winning standard, in April 2010 we decided 
to stop offering WiMAX and to close that 
part of our business.
To adopt 4G, which most of the world’s 
largest operators have pledged to do 
over the next three years, network 
operators have to invest in upgrading their 
infrastructures and that, particularly in

The software embedded in our products 
enables organisations to manage and 
analyse vast amounts of data, quickly and 
efficiently, either on our Nemo Analyze 
post-processing analyser, or on third-party 
post-processing analysis tools.
As the world’s mobile network coverage 
increases, with roll-out occurring in most 
developed and developing countries, we 
will continue to expand geographical sales 
coverage and to help MNOs establish, and 
then upgrade, their networks.
Network Testing strategy
Our objective is to continue to be the first 
to offer new technology, to provide excellent 
after-sales service and technical support, and to 
maintain strong relationships with customers, 
either direct or through local partners.
There is potential for considerable growth  
in many of the countries in which we 
operate. For example, India – which has a 
population of nearly 1.2 billion – has recently 
concluded the auction of its 3G licences  
and is an increasingly important market.
We are developing our LTE product but, 
since testing can begin only when the 
networks are in place, we do not expect any 
significant benefit to accrue from that until 
2012/2013. Our strategy is to continue to 
benefit from the roll-out of new networks 
by the MNOs and to leverage the LTE 
technology roll-out as it occurs.

efficiently. The technology offers customers 
the ability to sell an increasingly diverse 
set of holiday products through a range 
of sales channels (including call centres, 
travel agents, and the web), to price by 
currency and market, to manage their 
inventory dynamically, to connect with 
other industry providers effectively and to 
improve productivity and customer service. 
In addition, we offer managed services  
on a hosted or remotely-managed basis. 
These products have a long life-cycle:  
many existing users of our legacy ATOP 
product have been with us for more than  
15 years.
In recent years, major leisure travel 
companies have become even larger as 
they have acquired smaller operators. 
Paradoxically, their IT systems – which have 
the potential to transform profitability by 
offering economies in buying and selling, 
and by centralising back-office, as well as 
some sales functions – have tended to lag 
behind. In addition, there has been added 
competition to traditional tour operators 
from internet travel companies, such as 
Expedia and lastminute.com.

What does Anite Travel do?
Anite supplies systems 
to help leisure 
travel companies 
run their businesses 
more profitably. 
Our technology 
enables them to 
sell an increasingly 
diverse set of holiday 
products through a 
range of channels – 
including call centres, 
travel agents, and 
the web – to price by 
currency and market, 
to manage their

What products and 
services do you offer?
@comRes provides 
multi-channel 
distribution for leisure 
travel companies. It 
offers the key functions 
of reservations, 
content and customer 
relationship 
management, and 
operational finance.
@com eBusiness Suite  
is an integrated set of 
business applications, 
built around the core 
functions of @comRes. 
Think of it as a Travel-
ERP solution which 
includes supplier 
contracting, dynamic 
supplier connectivity, 
sales, inventory 
management, 
customer 
markets and holiday types, and to be 
confident that the system will scale up in  
such a way as to cope with an increasing 
work load as the business continues  
to grow.
As a stand-alone system, @comRes offers 
the four key functions, of reservations, 
content and customer relationship 
management, and operational finance.  
It is also the core around which our @com 
eBusiness Suite is built; this is a single 
integrated solution, which customers  
can buy and implement in modules.
In an economic environment where price 
and capacity are key to success, our flexible 
software enables leisure travel companies 
to reduce costs while, at the same time 
managing a wider range of products. 
Although demand for the traditional 
package holiday remains strong, the ability 
to manage flexible and dynamic packages 
from the same IT platform is a major 
competitive advantage.
Travel strategy
In the drive to become the dominant 
software supplier to the European 
leisure travel market, we will continue to 
capitalise on our existing strong customer 
relationships – in the past year we have 
begun to work with TUI UK – and to invest 
in @comRes’s ability to handle fixed and 
flexible packaging, and specialist operations, 
from a single system.
We will also continue with the process of 
creating UK and central European versions 
of @com to make it more accessible to 
mainstream travel companies. We will create 
long-term plans for customers currently 
using our legacy systems to migrate to  
@comRes. In addition, we will seek new mid-
sized customers and partners throughout 
Europe and North America, and investigate 
opportunities in emerging economies.
We are in the process of changing our 
revenue model to one in which we license 
our system to customers on an annual basis. 
While this is likely to be a long-term project, 
it will have benefits on both sides: it will 
reduce the initial capital cost for customers 
and will augment our recurring revenue.
While the recession is likely to accelerate 
consolidation by increasing pressure on 
smaller travel operators, we are confident 
that the scalability inherent in our  
@comRes software and @com eBusiness 
Suite, combined with our reputation for 
implementing software that works, places 
us in an ideal position to grow steadily in 
the UK and overseas.
The current year will continue to be 
challenging for the Travel business, 
particularly in the first half. The progress  
our @com product is making with 
established and new customers is, however, 
an indication of our present unique  
market position. Implementation for larger 
customers can take several years but,  
once completed, will benefit them for many 
years to come. We intend to show that we 
have re-established the trading position  
of this business and that it is set for  
further growth. Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     11

The past financial year was a challenging 
one for the Group, but we saw an 
improvement in the second half with both 
the Wireless and Travel businesses making 
good progress. Our new LTE product has 
been well received by customers.
Predictions as to the growth of the LTE

years to find a suitable replacement for 
its 25-year-old tour operating system. It 
quickly saw the value of going beyond the 
core @com reservation system and has 
now integrated our entire @com eBusiness 
Suite. This enables it to manage its principal 
business functions – reservations, content 
management, customer relationship 
management and operational finance –  
on a single system and to achieve: 
 
> profitability – through a significantly 
lower-cost IT platform which incorporates  
a complete set of integrated applications;
> flexibility – the @com eBusiness Suite 
enables Aurinkomatkat to combine the 
attributes of traditional, flexible and dynamic 
business processes;
> security – a robust technology platform that 
takes IT performance off management’ s agenda;
> scalability – proven high-volume linear 
scalability while retaining consistent 
response times.
“The @com eBusiness Suite goes a long way 
beyond the boundaries of the traditional 
‘reservation system’ to help Aurinkomatkat 
remain at the forefront of Finland’s holiday 
industry.”
Risto Mäntynen, Director of Information 
Management, Aurinkomatkat
We expect the continuing investments in 
our products to start to pay back during 
this year. The effect of this and normal 
seasonality factors mean we expect trading 
to be biased to the second half, although 
not as markedly as in 2009/10. Anite began 
the year in good shape: we are trading well 
and in line with our expectations.

Premises the size of the London
School of Economics require the
almost permanent presence of
painters and decorators. 
In this case, Sykes, one of the biggest painting contractors in Britain, has a
contract until 2006 to repaint the London School of Economics.
Sykes rely on Travis Perkins for paint supplies because their Blackfriars
Branch has the specialist skills to mix 12,000 colours from only four base
colours and 16 colourants, using the ICI Dulux system with 
in-house calibration.

name behind the

Courts of Justice and many others.

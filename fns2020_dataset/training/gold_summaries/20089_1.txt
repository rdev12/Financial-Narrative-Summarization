 10 MATCHTECH GROUP   |   Annual Report 2014
“ The Group has continued its track 
record of delivering year-on-year 
organic double-digit growth in 
NFI with both the average 
permanent fee and contract 
margins increasing.”
Chief Executive’s Review
Adrian Gunn, Chief Executive Officer
Maximising performance
This has been another successful year with 
strong performance across the Group.
Our focus as a specialist recruiter, on higher 
margin, harder to fill roles is bearing fruit.
We are focused on putting the right value 
on the quality service we provide. By 
increasing our staff’s ability to appreciate 
their own added value, we have improved 
their negotiating confidence which, in turn, 
has increased margins whilst maintaining 
nurtured client relationships.
Whilst contractor numbers on assignment, 
excluding the Provanis acquisition, has 
increased by only 100 to 7 ,100 from the 
7 ,000 we had at the start of the year, we 
have grown the Net Fee Income (NFI) 
we generate from contract recruitment 
by 14%.
We have replaced the contractor 
reductions at Portsmouth Naval Base with 
better paid, higher margin contractors 
elsewhere. We increased our contract 
margin percentage from 6.8% last year to 
7.5% this year which equates to 10% more 
NFI from the same revenue and this, along 
with wage inflation and placing candidates 
at higher pay rates, has driven the NFI 
forward.
In 2014 we also made over 3,000 
permanent placements, generating in 
excess of £12m in fees.
However, whilst the UK economy is in 
recovery mode, the acute skills shortage 
means that candidates are finding 
themselves with multiple job offers. 
This leads to more offer rejections and 
counter offers from incumbent employers, 
somewhat elongating the time to hire and 
slowing the growth in permanent fees.
We have maintained a healthy business 
mix with contract NFI now representing 
73% and permanent fees 27% of 
Group NFI.
The Group has continued its track record of 
delivering year-on-year organic double-
digit growth in NFI with both the average 
permanent fee and contract margins 
increasing.
The acquisition of Provanis has added to 
our capabilities. It has been successfully 
integrated into the Group and has 
positively impacted on profitability.
Having mapped our most attractive 
markets against our teams of strongest 
capability, we have identified the areas of 
greatest potential.
We continue to invest heavily in additional 
consultants, particularly focusing on 
increasing our consultant headcount within 
Engineering in the first half of FY2015.
We refined our 2017 Vision for the Group 
to be the market leading specialist recruiter 
within Engineering and Technology, the 
employer of choice, the best partner to 
clients and candidates with a rapidly 
developing international business and 
being a premium stock for investors.
The Group is ideally placed to benefit 
from the very strong demand in the UK 
and worldwide for skilled engineers and 
this demand is increasing as the global 
economy recovers and manufacturing 
output rises.
Our niche Engineering and Technology 
focus, market leading position and 
balanced business model of contract and 
permanent recruitment put us in a good 
position to take advantage of these trends.
I look forward to reporting on further 
progress throughout the coming year. 11 MATCHTECH GROUP   |   Annual Report 2014

Chief Executive’s Review continued
Engineering
The Engineering sector delivered 13% growth in 
Net Fee Income (NFI) to £27 .1m, with a 15% increase 
in Contract NFI and Permanent Fees slightly ahead 
of the prior year.
Infrastructure was our strongest 
performing area with a 36% increase 
in NFI on the back of major investment 
in rail, highways, utilities and building 
structures. Network Rail announced £38bn 
of funding into engineering projects and 
the Highways Agency delivered record 
spending reports, increasing confidence 
to the infrastructure sector. Both private 
and public organisations throughout 
the industry proactively targeted niche 
engineering talent, resulting in increased 
activity across both contract and 
permanent recruitment.
Aerospace NFI grew by 17% as the design 
and engineering phases of the A380, 
A400m and A350 moved into volume 
manufacturing, resulting in the UK having 
an order backlog of more than 10 years.
NFI in Automotive was up 5%, there were 
sustained high levels of investment from 
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and increased 
levels of interest in UK automotive 
capability from developing countries.
Energy produced similar NFI to the 
previous year, the Nuclear division 
(Defence and New Build) recorded strong 
growth, whilst our Oil & Gas team was 
impacted by stalling North Sea investment.
As expected Maritime was impacted by 
the planned completion of the QEC aircraft 
carrier build phase at Portsmouth Naval 
Base, but with NFI down only 7% year on 
year this highlights our ability to supply 
into shipyards nationally.
Our low risk international strategy of 
following key clients has led us to place 
candidates in 30 countries from our UK 
office. Our German business continues 
to be challenging but operational results 
have shown an improved performance 
compared to 2013.
Engineering has continued to differentiate 
its recruitment service by providing a clear 
focus on niche and specialist skills, whilst 
also positioning ourselves as authoritative 
thought leaders in the sector.
Gaining credibility with engineering 
industry stakeholders through association 
and partnerships is key and we have 
continued to provide valuable market 
intelligence and balanced opinion, as well 
as facilitating events and highlighting 
recommendations and actions in order to 
address the skills gap.
In partnership with the Institute of Marine, 
Engineering Science & Technology 
(IMarEST), a report, ‘Mitigating the Skills 
Gap’, in the Maritime and Oil & Gas 
Market, identified 16 recommendations to 
government, educators and industry which 
are being implemented through the Marine 
Industries Alliance and the UK National 
Engineering, Science and Technology 
Forum (UK NEST).
Our annual ‘Confidence Index’ which 
examines, by sector, how confident 
engineers are about a variety of different 
career related issues, including career 
progression, job security and salary, 
attracts a healthy amount of debate, 
media coverage and interaction with 
the Department of Business Innovation 
and Skills.
We provided valuable insight on 
recruitment trends within the engineering 
community contributing to a high profile 
report ‘Inventing the Future’, which 
was produced by the New Engineering 
Foundation. Submitted to Government 
the report challenges the way Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics 
(STEM) education subjects are delivered, 
managed and funded.
Our new partnership with Women in 
Engineering Society (WES) supports 
activities such as ‘National Women in 
Engineering Day’ which attracted an 
overwhelmingly positive response from 
clients, candidates and EngineeringUK.
We are committed to addressing the skills 
gap by addressing diversity, supporting a 
pipeline of talent, exploring the advantages 
of skills transfer, celebrating engineering 
excellence, promoting engineering as the 
career of choice and maintaining a focus on 
attracting and retaining talent to ensure a 
long-term sustainable engineering future 
for UK industry.

Professional Services
The Professional Services sector delivered £17 .9m of 
Net Fee Income (NFI) up 24% (2013: £14.4m) and 
now generates 40% of the Group’s NFI.
Excluding £1.8m of NFI generated from 
the acquisition of Provanis, underlying 
NFI grew by 13%. Contract NFI was up 
34% to £10.2m (2013: £7.6m), 11% on 
an underlying basis, and Permanent Fees 
were up 13% to £7.7m (2013: £6.8m).
With Provanis generating almost all its 
business from contractors, there has 
been a shift in the business mix within 
Professional Services with contract now 
generating 57% of NFI (2013: 53%) and 
Permanent Fees 43% NFI (2013: 47%).
Technology, which is the largest part of 
Professional Services, increased NFI by 
27%, 8% excluding Provanis and has a 
business mix of 83% contract and 17% 
permanent fees.
Technology operates seven niche teams 
within Controls & Automation, Electronics 
& Systems, Software, Communications & 
Infrastructure, Business Intelligence, ERP 
and Project Management. These specialist 
teams focus on higher margin, lower 
volume contingency business.
A centralised Corporate Accounts Team 
has also been set up to service our 
high volume, lower margin framework 
agreements more profitably.
Provanis, the niche Oracle Applications 
agency acquired in September, has 
accelerated our penetration into the 
ERP marketplace. Provanis has been 
successfully integrated into the business, 
with an outturn NFI conversion ratio in 
excess of 60%.
Professional Staffing NFI was up 19% with 
strong growth in permanent fees giving a 
business mix of 27% contract and 73% 
permanent fees.
Similar to Technology, Professional Staffing 
operates within skill specific teams who 
focus on Procurement, Finance, HR, Sales 
& Marketing and Training. These specialist 
teams are split across two recruitment 
centres, London and Whiteley and as 
well as being skill specific these teams 
only focus on four key sectors including 
Engineering and Technology.
This clearly defined remit is accelerating 
new client acquisition, improving the 
candidate experience and helping identify 
cross selling opportunities between 
brands. This strategy also underpins 
our primary objective of driving up 
productivity levels within Professional 
Services and we have the capacity to 
increase this productivity within our 
existing staff levels before further 
headcount investment is required.
Stuart Feest, Managing Director, Connectus and Provanis

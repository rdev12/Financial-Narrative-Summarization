 Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations
6 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Technology is now influencing lifestyle rather than simply reflecting 
it: the Blackberry device, for example, has fundamentally changed 
the work-life balance for large numbers of professionals worldwide; 
the merging of mainstream media with our everyday lives is made
possible by easy access to the internet, any time and anywhere, and 
in turn makes that access critical. We expect our household appliances
to have an increasing number of features, our cars to be safe and
reliable, our cameras to react automatically to prevailing light
conditions, and our mobile telephones to incorporate myriad 
features. A silent revolution in the way ordinary people interact 
with technology is underway.
This is a revolution which ARM has foreseen and, indeed, has
pioneered. In recent years we have transformed our business,
organically and by acquisition, from one which was primarily focused
on the development of microprocessor intellectual property (IP), to one
which is now capable of delivering a total solution – from beginning 
to end of the design process – to our customers. Our 2004 acquisitions
of California-based companies Artisan Components, which designs
physical IP , and Axys, which provides electronic system-level (ESL)
design tools, were augmented in October this year by the acquisition
of Keil. Based in Munich, Germany, and in Plano, Texas, Keil is a 
leading provider of 8/16-bit software development tools for the
microcontroller market; bringing it into the ARM fold enables our 
silicon Partners’ customers to develop intelligent and low-cost 
32-bit microcontroller-based products more easily.
Our strategic priorities
It is our ambition for all digital products to be powered by ARM
technology – and we are well on the way to becoming the architecture
for the digital world. In the future, digital products will contain
increasing amounts of our technology, including processor and physical
IP , other systems IP and embedded software. In addition, we will
continue to provide the software development tools that enable
designers to build innovative ARM Powered products: in 2005 our
Partners shipped 1.7 billion of these, up 31% on 2004, and in May
2005, we announced that we expect total shipments to increase to
approximately 4.5 billion by 2010.
We use the analogy of a human body to describe how ARM technology
brings digital products to life: our processor IP is the brain controlling
and driving the system; our data engine IP forms the specialist organs,
such as the lungs; fabric IP makes up the nervous system which
enables the brain to communicate with the other parts of the body;
and our physical IP – the libraries and memories – are the cells from
which the entire body is made. Our tools are the parents and teachers
which shape the body and develop its thoughts; and our software IP
are the thoughts that go through the brain and provide the intelligence
and character of the product. 
A year of execution and delivery
In 2005, we made significant progress in executing on our strategic
priorities. At the beginning of the year we set ourselves an objective:
to take ARM into the next phase of its growth. Looking back, we have
done just that. We have positioned our enlarged group to capitalise on
Our industry is one which changes constantly, 
but in the past year the shift has been particularly
noticeable  ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 7
the huge potential benefits which accrue from the combination of ARM
and Artisan; we have delivered a number of new products which
underpin the proliferation of our IP; and we have delivered meaningful
earnings growth for our shareholders.
Building on the combination of ARM and Artisan
We completed the acquisition of Artisan Components in December
2004. One year on, we have successfully integrated Artisan, now our
Physical IP Division (PIPD), into the Group. The PIPD management team
is a blend of senior executives from ARM and Artisan. The unified ARM
sales team is a combination of the former ARM and Artisan sales
teams; based on an account management structure, it uses technical
specialists from across the group.
During the year, we began to see good progress in effecting the
strategic plan for the acquisition. This was, first, to outsource physical
IP to traditional ARM Partners; second, to create optimised products
from the combination of physical IP and processor IP; and, third, to use
the Artisan sales channel to create broader access to processor IP .
We plan to build on the success Artisan achieved in selling its physical
IP to small fabless semiconductor companies, which account for
approximately 10% of the world’s semiconductor industry revenue, by
expanding the customer base to include large fabless semiconductor
companies and integrated device manufactures (IDMs). These not only
account for the other 90%, but represent ARM’s traditional customer
base. We made progress on this and exceeded our expectations by
completing seven deals – encouraging early indications of our Partners’
willingness to outsource the development of physical IP when it makes
economic sense to do so, and when we have the right products. As the
cost and complexity of developing physical IP increases, we anticipate
that an increasing number of our Partners will realise the commercial
and technical wisdom of outsourcing it from us. 
During the year, we also developed our first optimised products
through the combination of physical IP and processor IP . Developing
processor and physical IP concurrently has enabled us to create faster,
smaller, and more power-efficient processors. In October, at the second
annual ARM Developers’ Conference in California, we introduced 
the Cortex™-A8 processor; at the same time, we introduced the
Advantage™ CE libraries which increase the processor’s performance
and efficiency. Our Partners will be able to license optimised physical
IP to maximise the Cortex-A8 processor’s performance while, at the
same time, minimising size and power consumption. A number of
other optimised products, including the introduction of an
implementation of the ARM1176JZF-S™ processor, were delivered
through collaborative technology design: advanced physical IP , and
process technology delivery will provide 40% more performance
without increasing size or power consumption.
Delivering new technologies 
At the beginning of 2005 we had a strong portfolio of products for
licensing. During the year, we increased licence revenues in the
Processor Division (PD) by 19% – building on 27% growth in 2004 – and
signed 71 new licences, including 12 for ARM11 family products which
are now increasingly being licensed for use outside the mobile sector. Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations/continued
8 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
During the year, PIPD had sold 20 platform licences to its foundry and
IDM Partners, and a further 42 end-user licences to IDMs and fabless
semiconductor companies. At the year end the cumulative total for
PIPD licensing reached 67 platform licences and 143 end-user licences.
The year was an outstanding one for the development of the new
products that will drive future revenue growth. The Cortex-A8 processor
is the industry’s fastest embedded processor and our first complete
processing solution to comprise a wide range of ARM technology to
reduce time-to-market. Its performance and power consumption
characteristics make it ideal for consumer products which run multi-
channel video, audio and gaming applications. We expect it to
revolutionise consumer and low-power mobile devices, and to enable
even more innovative product features to be delivered to end users to
provide higher levels of functionality and entertainment. The Cortex-A8
processor’s attributes were recognised by the winning of four high-
profile industry awards: Electronic Products magazine’s “Product of the
Year”; Portable Design magazine’s “Editor’s Choice”; Electronic Design
magazine’s “Best of Embedded 2005” and Microprocessor Report’s
“Analysts’ Choice Award for the Best Processor-IP Core of 2005”. In
October, we announced that there were already five lead licensees for
the product, including Freescale, Matsushita, Samsung and Texas
Instruments. We expect the Cortex-A8 processor to be available for
general licensing by mid-2006.
We continued the development of our other products in the Cortex
family, including the Cortex-M3 processor, which was available for
general release by early 2006. We licensed it to four lead licensees in 
2005 and had made initial deliveries to them by the middle of the year. 
Test silicon for the Cortex-M3 processor is revealing higher performance
and smaller size characteristics than we initially visualised and creates
a significant opportunity for licensing growth in 2006. The latest addition
to the Cortex family, code named “Serval-E”, was licensed to two lead
Partners and is expected to be available for general licensing during 2006.
We also made significant advances in technology in PIPD with the
acceleration of the development of leading-edge products. This will
ensure that we have the ability to support large IDMs and fabless
companies which, as a result of rapid increases in the cost and
complexity of physical IP arising from the continuing advances in silicon
process technology, are increasingly looking to us to provide third-party
physical IP . To this end we have successfully developed 90nm and,
more recently, 65nm physical IP products, enabling us to sell leading-
edge physical IP to a number of major foundries, including Chartered
Semiconductor and IBM. 
ARM IP in digital products 
When we updated our estimate of future shipments of ARM Powered
products, we also rationalised our application-oriented approach to
target markets in line with the changing nature of the electronic
industry: we now focus on solutions for the mobile, home, enterprise,
embedded and emerging applications markets.
By the final quarter of the year, our Partners had shipped a record 
499 million units – the equivalent of approximately 5.5 million each
day. The mobile market continued to grow strongly: we shipped more  ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 9
than 1 billion units into mobile for the first time and also increased
penetration by attaining an average of 1.4 ARM processors per
handset. The first shipments of ARM11 family-based phones were
made in Japan from the FOMA N902i; with multiple versions now
shipping. We expect this strong growth in mobile (up 23% from 2004),
to continue in 2006, driven by shipments of ultra-low-cost handsets
(ULCH) in emerging markets and by the increased popularity of smarter
phones.
We also achieved significant growth (46% over 2004) in non-mobile
markets: our Partners shipped 600 million units in 2005 –
approximately the same number as was achieved for mobile
shipments in 2003. This was over a broad base of applications,
particularly hard disk drives, games consoles, smartcards, printers, DVD
players, flash memory products, digital still cameras, Wi-Fi chipsets and
automotive products.
We continued to make strategic investments to speed our growth in
non-mobile areas. The microcontroller sector promises particular
potential and we expect this to reach approximately 1 billion units by
2010. Our acquisition of Keil maximises the opportunity for success in
the microcontroller market; we are aiming to provide an easy transition
for developers from their older 8- and 16-bit technologies to new ARM
32-bit microcontrollers. We believe we can accelerate this by providing
a consistent development system platform for building applications. 
We introduced our first combined development product, the RealView
®
Microcontroller Development Kit, in January 2006.
Looking ahead
Our extensive portfolio of technology for licensing, increasing
momentum in royalties, the growth in sales of development systems,
and the prospect of more revenues arising from the combination of
processor IP and physical IP , gives us confidence for another strong
performance in 2006. We enter the year in an excellent position to
continue to build on our market leadership.

10 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Notwithstanding the 20% increase in R&D expenditure to drive
expected strong revenue growth, an increase in earnings per share of
more than 20% has enabled us to return more cash to shareholders
through a progressive dividend policy and the ongoing share buyback
programme that we introduced during the year.
The business, its objectives and strategy
ARM's comprehensive product offer includes 16/32-bit RISC
microprocessors, data engines, 3D processors, digital libraries,
embedded memories, peripherals, software and development tools, 
as well as analogue functions and high-speed connectivity products.
The Group licenses this technology to semiconductor companies which,
in turn, manufacture, market and sell microprocessors and related
products. ARM has developed an innovative, intellectual property-
centred and market-driven business model in which it neither
manufactures nor sells the products incorporating ARM technology, but
concentrates on the research and development, design and support of
the ARM architecture and supporting development tools and software.
Together with our broad Partner community, we provide a total 
system solution that offers a fast, reliable path to market for leading
electronics companies.
In 2005, as well as growing profitability, the Company was robustly
cash generative (before investing activities), with net cash inflows
from operating activities of £41.7 million, giving rise to a year-end
cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable
securities balance of £160.9 million.
Performance
Revenues
Total revenues for the year ended 31 December 2005 amounted 
to £232.4 million. Total revenues comprised £182.3 million from 
the Processor division, an increase of 19% over total revenues 
of £152.7 million in the year ended 31 December 2004, and 
£50.1 million for PIPD (2004: £0.2 million). 
The actual average dollar exchange rate in 2005 was $1.80 compared
with $1.78 in 2004 for ARM standalone. This had the effect of
decreasing total reported revenues by approximately £2.8 million.
Total licensing revenues in 2005 were £104.2 million, being 45% 
of total revenues, compared with £59.4 million or 39% of total revenues
in the year to 31 December 2004. Total licensing revenues in 2005
comprised £69.4 million from the Processor division, compared with
£59.4 million in 2004 and £34.8 million from PIPD (2004: £nil). 
Royalty revenues in 2005 were £87.8 million, representing 38% 
of total revenues, compared with £59.6 million or 39% of total
revenues in the year to 31 December 2004. Royalty revenues in 
2005 comprised £72.5 million from the Processor division, compared
with £59.6 million in 2004, and £15.3 million from PIPD (2004: 
£0.2 million). 
Sales of development systems in 2005 were £25.7 million, being 
11% of total revenues, compared with £19.7 million, or 13% of total
revenues in 2004. Service revenues, which include consulting services
and revenues from support, maintenance and training, were 
£14.7 million in 2005, representing 6% of total revenues, compared
with £14.2 million, or 9% of total revenues in 2004.
In 2005, ARM increased revenues at twice the rate 
of the semiconductor industry, achieved operating
margins healthily in excess of 30%* and saw volumes 
of ARM Powered products grow by more than 30% 
year-on-year to 1.7 billion units

Royalty revenues and unit shipments
Total royalty revenues for 2005 were £87.8 million, comprising 
£72.5 million from the Processor division and £15.3 million from PIPD.
Royalties from the Processor division came from record unit shipments 
of 1,662 million compared with £59.6 million and 1,272 million units
in 2004. Dollar royalty revenues earned in the Processor division were
$131.1 million, up 22% on 2004 compared with the increase in year-
on-year unit shipments of 31%. The average royalty rate in 2005 was
7.9 cents. The average royalty rate in a given period is based on a
number of variables, including the average selling prices of the chips
being shipped, the applicable royalty rate payable to ARM and the mix
of unit shipments by ARM product family.
In 2005, the proportion of total unit shipments accounted for by the
mobile segment was 65%. Unit shipments in the mobile segment
grew by 23% year-on-year with unit shipments in the non-mobile
segments growing by 46%. Growth in the non-mobile segments was
achieved across a broad range of product applications, including hard
disk drives, games consoles, smart cards, printers, DVD players, flash
memory products, digital still cameras, Wi-Fi chipsets and automotive
products.
There were 68 Partners shipping ARM technology-based products at
the end of 2005; 19 companies were paying royalties for physical IP
products at the end of the year. Royalties within PIPD demonstrated
market share growth against a backdrop of lower year-on-year revenue
for the foundries as a whole.
Gross margin
Gross margins for the year to 31 December 2005 were 89% compared
with 92% for the ARM standalone business in 2004. Cost of sales in 2005
included compensation charges in respect of share-based payments of
£1.3 million (2004: £0.4 million). The reduction reflects the higher
margin achieved in the Processor division offset by the lower margins
achieved in the Physical IP Division.
Operating expenses
The comparability of costs between 2004 and 2005 is affected by 
the acquisitions of Artisan Components Inc. on 23 December 2004 
and Axys Design Automation Inc. on 16 August 2004. On acquisition,
significant values of intangible assets other than goodwill were
recognised and these amounts are amortised over the expected useful
lives of the assets acquired, with the cost recorded against research
and development, sales and marketing or general and administrative
expenses as appropriate. To aid comparability, these costs have been
separately identified as “acquisition-related charges” in the narrative
below. In addition, the issuance of ARM share options to the
employees of Artisan on its acquisition gives rise to significant non-
cash share-based compensation charges. These, together with the
share option compensation costs arising on options granted to existing
ARM employees, are separately identified in the narrative below.
Total operating expenses in the year to 31 December 2005 were
£170.7 million compared with £112.3 million in 2004. Average headcount
increased from 774 in 2004 to 1,234 in 2005. Operating expenses in
2005 included total acquisition-related charges of £17.9 million (2004:
£0.5 million) and compensation charges in respect of share-based
payments and related payroll taxes of £20.2 million (2004: £7.5 million). Operating and financial review/IFRS/continued

Excluding acquisition-related charges and compensation charges in respect
of share-based payments and related payroll taxes, total operating
expenses in 2005 were £132.6 million in 2005, compared with 
£99.8 million in 2004 after excluding a further £4.5 million in respect
of a non-recurring charge for a technology licence agreement. 
Research and development (R&D) expenses at £80.3 million in 2005,
represented 35% of revenues. This compares with £54.7 million, 36%
of revenues, in 2004. Average headcount in this area increased from
464 in 2004 to 783 in 2005. R&D expenses included total acquisition-
related charges of £8.1 million (2004: £0.3 million) and compensation
charges in respect of share-based payments and related payroll taxes of
£12.3 million (2004: £4.3 million). Excluding acquisition-related charges
and compensation charges in respect of share-based payments and
related payroll taxes, R&D expenses in 2005 were £59.9 million and 
£50.1 million in 2004, representing 26% and 33% of revenues respectively . 
Sales and marketing costs in 2005 were £47.4 million or 20% of
revenues, compared with £25.5 million or 17% of revenues in 2004.
Average headcount in this area increased from 204 in 2004 to 286 
in 2005. Sales and marketing costs in 2005 include total acquisition-
related charges of £9.1 million (2004: £0.2 million) and compensation
charges in respect of share-based payments and related payroll taxes
of £4.3 million (2004: £1.5 million). Excluding acquisition-related
charges and compensation charges in respect of share-based payments
and related payroll taxes, sales and marketing costs in 2005 were
£34.0 million and £23.8 million in 2004, representing 15% and 16% 
of revenues respectively. 
General and administration expenses in 2005 were £43.0 million or
19% of revenues, compared with £32.1 million or 21% of revenues 
in 2004. Average headcount in this area increased from 106 in 2004 
to 165 in 2005. General and administration expenses in 2005 included
total acquisition-related charges of £0.7 million (2004: £nil) and
compensation charges in respect of share-based payments and related
payroll taxes of £3.6 million (2004: £1.7 million). Excluding acquisition-
related charges and compensation charges in respect of share-based
payments and related payroll taxes, general and administration
expenses in 2005 were £38.7 million, compared with £25.9 million in
2004 after excluding a further £4.5 million in respect of a non-recurring
charge for a technology licence agreement, representing 17% of
revenues in both years. 
Operating margin
The operating margin in 2005 was 15.1% compared with 18.5% 
in 2004. The operating margin in 2005, excluding acquisition-related
charges of £17.9 million and compensation charges in respect 
of share-based payments and related payroll taxes of £21.5 million
was 32.1% compared with 27.0%, before acquisition-related charges
of £0.5 million, compensation charges in respect of share-based
payments of £7.9 million and £4.5 million in respect of a non-
recurring charge for a technology licence agreement, in 2004.

£7.9 million and £4.5 million in respect of a non-recurring charge 
for a technology licence agreement, or 31.5% of revenues in 2004.
The Group’s effective taxation rate in 2005 was 26.8%, compared with
26.6% in 2004. In 2005, there was an increase compared with 2004 
in the level of disallowable items, but this was offset by tax benefits
arising from the structuring of the Artisan acquisition and increased
R&D tax credits and deferred tax adjustments.
Fully diluted earnings per share in 2005 were 2.1 pence compared 
with 2.5 pence in 2004. Earnings per fully diluted share in 2005, before
acquisition-related charges of £17.9 million, compensation charges 
in respect of share-based payments and related payroll taxes of 
£21.5 million and related estimated tax adjustments thereon of 
£9.1 million, were 4.2 pence, compared with 3.5 pence before acquisition-
related charges of £0.5 million, compensation charges in respect 
of share-based payments of £7.9 million, £4.5 million in respect 
of a non-recurring charge for a technology licence agreement and
related estimated tax adjustments thereon of £2.1 million, in 2004.
Balance sheet and cash flow
Goodwill at 31 December 2005 was £474.4 million, compared with
£419.2 million at 31 December 2004. The increase in goodwill 
in 2005 is due primarily to foreign exchange movements, given 
the strengthening of the US dollar against sterling from $1.92 at 
31 December 2004 to $1.72 at the end of 2005. Goodwill arising 
on the Keil acquisitions amounted to £5.8 million. Goodwill is not
amortised under IFRS but is subject to impairment review on at least
an annual basis. A regular review of the carrying value of the assets
arising on the acquisition of Artisan was performed as at 31 December
2005 and it was concluded that no impairment charge was required. 
Other intangible assets at 31 December 2005 were £79.7 million,
compared with £84.0 million at 31 December 2004. The movement 
in other intangible assets in 2005 reflects the amortisation in the year
of the intangible assets arising on the acquisitions of Artisan and Axys
of £17.5 million and an additional £8.7 million arising on the Keil
acquisitions in October 2005. The other intangible assets will be
amortised through the profit and loss account over a weighted average
period of five years. 
Accounts receivable at 31 December 2005 were £55.5 million, 
compared with £34.3 million at 31 December 2004. The allowance
against receivables was £2.2 million at 31 December 2005, compared
with £1.5 million at 31 December 2004. Deferred revenues were 
£20.4 million at 31 December 2005, compared with £21.4 million 
at the end of 2004.
Resources available
The consolidated cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments 
and marketable securities balance was £160.9 million at 31 December
2005 compared with £142.8 million at 31 December 2004. Operating and financial review/IFRS/continued

Interest receivable
Interest receivable was £5.3 million for the year to 31 December 2005
compared with £6.9 million in 2004. 
Returns to shareholders
Dividend 
The directors recommend payment of a final dividend in respect of
2005 of 0.5 pence per share which, taken together with the interim
dividend of 0.34 pence per share paid in October 2005, gives a total
dividend in respect of 2005 of 0.84 pence per share, an increase of
20% over 0.7 pence per share in 2004. Subject to shareholder
approval, the final dividend will be paid on 5 May 2006 to
shareholders on the register on 31 March 2006.
Total dividends actually paid in 2005 amounted to £10.4 million 
(2004: £9.0 million).
Share buyback programme
During 2005, the Group initiated a share buyback programme to
supplement dividends in returning surplus funds to shareholders.
During 2005, the Company bought back over 13.9 million shares at 
a total cost of £16.2 million. This programme is on-going and further
repurchases are expected to be made in 2006 and beyond.
Capital structure
The authorised share capital of the Company is 2,200,000,000 ordinary
shares of 0.05 pence each (2004: 2,200,000,000). The issued share
capital at 31 December 2005 was 1,386,102,680 ordinary shares of
0.05 pence each (2004: 1,350,786,975).  
Treasury policies and objectives and liquidity
The Group has established treasury policies aimed both at mitigating
the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on reported profits and
cash flows, and at ensuring appropriate returns are earned on the
Group’s cash resources.
With approximately 95% of Group revenues earned in US dollars and
approximately 45% of Group costs being incurred in US dollars, the
Group has a significant exposure to movements in the exchange rate
between the US dollar and sterling. This exposure is partially mitigated
by an ongoing hedging programme, involving forward contracts and
low-risk option contracts where appropriate. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
In line with the guidance for the preparation of an operating and
financial review, certain risk factors faced by the Group are identified
below. A more detailed description is included in the Group's annual
report on Form 20-F. Details of the Group's internal control and risk
management procedures are included in the corporate governance
report on pages 18 to 20.
ARM’s quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and be
unpredictable which could adversely affect the market price 
of ARM ordinary shares
ARM has experienced, and may in the future experience, significant
quarterly fluctuations in its results of operations. Quarterly results may
fluctuate because of a variety of factors. Such factors include: 
— the timing of entering into agreements with new licensees;
— the mixture of licence fees, royalties, revenues from the sale 
of development systems and fees from services;
— the introduction of new technology by us, our licensees or our
competition;
— the timing of orders from, and shipments to, systems companies 
of ARM technology-based microprocessors from our semiconductor
Partners;
— sudden technological or other changes in the microprocessor
industry; and
— new litigation or developments in current litigation. ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 15
In future periods, ARM’s operating results may not meet the
expectations of public market analysts or investors. In such an event
the market price of our shares could be materially adversely affected. 
General economic conditions may reduce ARM’s revenues and
harm ARM’s business
ARM is subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global
economic conditions. Because of economic uncertainties in many of 
our key markets, many industries may delay or reduce technology
purchases and investments. The impact of this on ARM is difficult to
predict, but if businesses defer licensing our technology, require less
services or development tools, or if consumers defer purchases of 
new products which incorporate ARM’s technology, revenue could
decline. A decline in revenue would have an adverse effect on the
results of operations and could have an adverse effect on ARM’s
financial condition. 
ARM competes in the intensely competitive semiconductor market
The semiconductor market is intensely competitive and characterised
by rapid technological change. ARM cannot give assurance that it will
have the financial resources, technical expertise, or marketing or
support capabilities to compete successfully in the future. 
Competition is based on a variety of factors including price,
performance, product quality, software availability, marketing and
distribution capability, customer support, name recognition and
financial strength. Further, given ARM’s reliance on our semiconductor
Partners, its competitive position is dependent on their competitive
position. In addition, ARM’s semiconductor Partners do not license
ARM’s architecture exclusively, and several of them also design,
develop, manufacture and market microprocessors based on their 
own architectures or on other non-ARM architectures. 
ARM may not develop or operate systems which comply fully with
the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Preparations for attestation under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act as at 31 December 2006 are relatively well-advanced. There can
be no guarantee, however, that the detailed testing of internal controls
required as part of the attestation process will not identify significant
control deficiencies or material weaknesses that impact on the
auditors’ opinion on internal controls over financial reporting and/or
require disclosure on Form 20-F.
Other risks include ARM's inability to manage the significant changes 
in the number of its employees and the size of its operations in the
United States, dependence on semiconductor Partners and systems
companies, availability of development tools, systems software and
operating systems compatible with ARM’s architecture, dependence on
a small number of customers and products, ARM’s inability to develop
new products on a timely basis, unanticipated costs due to products
that could have technical difficulties or undetected design errors, the
ARM architecture not being continued to be accepted by the market,
risks associated with any strategic investments or acquisitions,
dependence on senior management personnel and on hiring and
retaining qualified engineers, exposure from international operations,
litigation and threats of litigation and protection of ARM’s intellectual
property, unavailability of debt financing or additional equity funding to
satisfy future capital needs, adverse affects resulting from changes in
stock option accounting rules adversely impacting ARM’s reported
operating results and its competitiveness in the marketplace.

the evolution group plc
Report & Accounts 2003
Review of the year
The Group made substantial
progress in 2003. All areas of our
business have been strong, and
there has been a significant
increase in revenue generation.
Total revenue in 2003 was £40.8m
(2002: £15.8m), an increase of 159%.
During 2003, the Group was able to
create substantial shareholder value
in separating, by way of flotation,
our intellectual property subsidiary
IP2IPO, and the Group saw a
significant realisation from the sale
of part of the Group’s interest.
The core of the Group’s business
now consists principally of
Institutional Equity broking and
Private client stockbroking and fund
management, and both businesses
have outperformed the respective
budgets for 2003. It has always
been the Group’s strategy to retain
separate brands, and both are
managed as independent businesses
in all respects.

Report & Accounts 2003
EVBG continues to be the largest
operating business within the
Group. Total operating income
increased by 264% to £32.1m (2002:
£8.8m), although conditions in 2003
were mixed. The first half was
dominated by the Gulf War and
difficult equity markets. EVBG was
able to trade profitably through this
period, with the reduced cost
structure that was introduced in
2002. The appetite for risk increased
in the second half of 2003 and
EVBG was able to accelerate its
income generation and profitability.
Corporate broking
Our corporate broking track
record in 2003 has been extremely
encouraging, overall income
increased by 285% to £17.3m
(2002: £4.5m).
During 2003 EVBG advised on 60
transactions. In total, we raised
£271m for our clients. Our ability to
provide these services successfully
for our clients comes from our
knowledge and understanding of
those client companies and the 
in-depth research into these
companies and their business
opportunities. Our retained
corporate client list had increased
to 107 at the year end. The
opportunity is still substantial to
provide integrated advisory services
to small and mid-cap UK companies.
EVBG continues to be innovative in
its thinking to provide equity
finance solutions to our customers.
Equity research and Equity
distribution
In research, EVBG has continued
to increase our sector coverage in
2003, reinforcing EVBG’s aim to be
a research led equity business with
qualified, specialist analysts. At the
year end, EVBG had coverage of in
excess of 190 stocks across sectors,
including: health, pharmaceutical
and biotech, general retail, leisure
and hotels, media and
entertainment, support services,
electronics, software, mining, oil
and gas, construction/building,
materials and infrastructure. The
improved research product is
evidenced by the continued market
share growth in sales and the
improved ratings in surveys such 
as Extel and Institutional Investor.
Sales and distribution have
strengthened throughout 2003.
EVBG has seen an increase in the
flow of secondary sales
commissions. New recruits to the
team have successfully secured new
sales channels into international
institutional investors. This new
dimension has increased
substantially the distribution
platform at EVBG.
Market-making and Trading
In 2003, EVBG made significant
changes to our trading operation.
In April, a new team was recruited
to realign entirely the market-
making direction, increasing the
number of stocks that we make
prices in to over 600 by the year
end. All our market-making and
trading activities across the mid and
the small cap traded profitably in
2003 and EVBG saw a significant
increase in transaction volumes.
Market-making ensures the
operation of an orderly and liquid
market and provides a service to
retail stockbrokers. EVBG has been
able to increase this part of the
business by adding further
electronic connectivity via the Retail
Service Provider (“RSP”) mechanism.
At the year end, we were members
of the London Stock Exchange and
Proquote hubs and have begun the
process of adding a further two RSP
connections.  
In summary, 2003 has seen EVBG’s
businesses develop significantly. 
I believe that, as we approach the
end of the first quarter of 2004, we
are confident of further income and
profitability growth . Chief Executive’s Report

the evolution group plc
Report & Accounts 2003
In 2003, we set a plan for
Christows of growth in scale and
attaining profitability. I am
pleased to report that both of
these achievements were met.
Total income increased by over
25% to £8.3 million which,
coupled with continued tight
management of costs, produced a
second consecutive profitable year
after the restructuring in 2001.
Transaction based income increased
by 39% from 2002 and included an
exceptional performance from our
contracts for difference team which
doubled its income. Our strategy of
growing funds under management,
particularly those strategic funds
upon which recurring management
fees are received, also proved
successful. Strategic funds under
management increased by 59% over
the previous period to £398m
(2002: £250m) making up 83% of
total funds under management at
the year end (2002: 77%).
Our growth in funds under
management was underpinned by
record sales, for the third
consecutive year, for our
professional intermediary sales
team, leading to Christows winning
new mandates to increase
significantly year end funds under
management to approximately
£477 million, an increase of 46%
over last year. Within our funds
under management we have seen
an extension of our offering to a
wider potential client base via our
OEIC, Multi-Manager Portfolio
Service and the successful Private
Portfolio Account, where we have
seen further growth in the average
portfolio size of our bespoke
discretionary clients. In addition, we
have been successful in recruiting
likeminded individuals who can
attract new clients to supplement
the organic growth from our sales
activities, and have been joined by
new account executives from a
variety of competitors.
During the middle part of the year,
we continued our regional
development by opening a new
branch office in Bath, which we
strongly believe will have
considerable potential in 2004 and
beyond. Finally, as the year came to
a close, we completed the process
of repatriating our OEICs to the UK
from Dublin, which will allow our
Fund Management team to utilise
the flexibility introduced by the new
UCITS legislation to supplement the
excellent performance of the funds
last year.
Christows begins 2004 with a
robust, scaleable platform for
growth and a continuation of the
trends apparent in the second half
of 2003 should contribute to
accelerating profitability in the
current year. IP2IPO operated as a subsidiary 
of the Group until October and
during this period concluded its
third university  partnership, when
in May 2003 it entered into a 25
year partnership with King’s
College London. At this point, it
raised £6.25 million through a
further round of private financing
to develop this relationship. In
September 2003, IP2IPO agreed
terms of a new 25 year partnership
with the University of York’s Centre
for Novel Agricultural Products
(‘‘CNAP’’) which was conditional
upon IP2IPO’s admission to AIM. 
In October 2003, IP2IPO
successfully listed on AIM raising
£31.5 million valuing this group at
£111.8 million. Since then it has
continued to make progress in the
development of spin out companies
from its on-going university
partnerships. At the time of the
admission to AIM, the Group
realised £15m from the sale of its
majority stake, leaving it with
40.61% of IP2IPO at the year end.
IP2IPO now operates as a separate,
independently managed business
and the Group’s interest is
monitored through the position of
Non-executive director, which I hold
on its board.
New Business
In August 2003, trading
commenced in Evolution Securities
China Limited (‘‘ESCL’’). This
company has its principal office in
London and a branch in Shanghai.
It offers investment banking services
to both Chinese and UK institutions
and is well placed strategically to
access the growing Chinese equities
market. ESCL combines a deep
knowledge of China, its economy
and its securities industry with first-
class securities analysis, sales
support and trade execution. ESCL
aims to meet the growing need
from professional investors for
attractive investment opportunities
in China at an acceptable level of
risk. ESCL’s integration within the
Group ensures that its corporate
activities are efficient and well
supported. ESCL is an appointed
representative of Evolution Beeson
Gregory Limited. 
Official List & New Offices
As outlined in the half year results,
the Company completed the move
to the Official List on 26 June 2003.
The head office for the Group and
its investment banking operations
changed to 100 Wood Street in
August 2003. The facilities provided
in this modern office, in the heart
of the City of London, has provided
a strong platform for our trading
and settlement operations and
brought us closer to our clients and
institutional investors.
Both of these achievements were
completed under tight timetables
and cost effectively.
Employees
We continue to recognise the
importance of developing a culture
where the employees’ interests are
aligned mutually with those of the
Group’s shareholders. This is
something that we aim to achieve
for the key performers in all of our
business units. Through the use of
the Group’s principal share and
share option schemes, we are able
to manage this by combining staff
incentivisation with a high degree
of loyalty. The use of such
arrangements resulted in a profit
and loss impact across the Group
during 2003 of £3.0 million,
principally in the form of a charge
for the cost of options (difference
between the market value of each
1p ordinary share and the exercise
price at the time of grant). It is our
firm belief that these arrangements
are extremely effective and that
incentivising and retaining our key
employees are in the interests of the
Group’s shareholders.

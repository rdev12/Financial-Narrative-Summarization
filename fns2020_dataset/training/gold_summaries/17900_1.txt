Our results 
This has been another very successful financial year for the Group and we have delivered 
strong improvement across all our key financial metrics.
We increased profit before tax by 44.8% to £565.5m and our operating margin improved 
by 230 basis points to 15.3%. ROCE was up by 440 basis points to 23.9% as we continued 
to develop our fast asset turn model of a shorter owned land bank, deferred land 
payments, standardised product and the ability to sell through both our national brands 
on larger sites. 
We have also significantly strengthened our balance sheet, ending the year with net  
cash of £186.5m (2014: £73.1m).

Our businesses
Our improved financial results have 
been driven by a strong and disciplined 
operational performance in both 
our housebuilding and commercial 
developments businesses. 
Housebuilding
With a good level of demand for new 
homes across all six of our operating 
regions, our housebuilding business has 
focused on optimising sales volumes, 
getting the best prices for the homes 
we build, thereby driving financial 
performance. The sales rate for the 
year was 0.64 (2014: 0.69) net private 
reservations per active site per week, 
with a sales rate in the second half of 0.70 
(2014: 0.71) net private reservations per 
active site per week.
There was strength across all regional 
markets, and in particular our Northern 
region delivered a year on year uplift in 
sales rate in the second half, despite a 
strong prior year performance. 
We achieved a significant uplift in the 
rate of new site openings in the financial 
year. In total, the Group launched 176 
(2014: 136) new developments including 
JV’s and at 30 June was operating from 
9% more sites with 399 (2014: 366) active 
sites (including JV’s). Looking ahead, we 
expect to see further controlled growth in 
site numbers in FY16 of around 3%.
Completions for the full year including 
JV’s were up 11% at 16,447 (2014: 14,838). 
Private completions increased by 7% 
to 12,746 (2014: 11,936), affordable 
completions were 2,853 (2014: 2,255), 
and JV completions in which the Group 
had an interest were 848 (2014: 647). 
This represents our highest level of 
completions in seven years, and Barratt 
London completed a record volume of 
1,965 units including JV’s. 
We continue to increase the proportion 
of completions that are on more recently 
acquired higher margin land and these 
accounted for 76% (2014: 65%) of the total 
in the year. We have also continued to 
take advantage of the stronger market 
conditions to increase the rate of sale on 
older lower margin sites. This will bring 
forward our exit from these sites and help 
to drive up returns in the medium term. 
Help to Buy (Equity Loan) has provided 
a very attractive opportunity for our 
customers, especially for first time buyers. 
During the year 31% (2014: 31%) of our 
total completions (excluding JV’s) used the 
scheme. The contribution from investor 
sales, which are predominantly in our 
London region, fell slightly in the year to 
11% (2014: 12%) of total completions.
Our total average selling price 
(‘ASP’) increased by 7% to £235,000 
(2014: £219,900) in the financial year 
with our private average selling 
price increasing by 9% to £262,500 
(2014: £241,600). This year on year 
increase reflects both further mix changes 
and underlying house price inflation. 
We expect to see some further increase 
in ASP driven by changes in mix in FY16, 
with the total ASP in our owned land bank 
increasing to £252,000 as at 30 June 2015 
(2014: £227,000).
Affordable average selling price increased 
by 7% to £112,300 (2014: £105,300) 
reflecting changes in mix, with affordable 
completions increasing to 18% (2014: 16%) 
of total completions.
Our JV’s have performed well and our 
share of profits from JV’s in FY15 for 
the housebuilding business increased 
to £45.6m (2014: £40.8m). As at 30 June 
2015 we were selling from 16 (2014: 8) JV 
sites and expect the share of profits from 
JV’s to increase to around £60m in FY16. 
For our London region, the proportion of 
completions from JV sites versus non-JV 
sites is expected to increase significantly in 
FY16, in particular driven by completions 
from Fulham Riverside in Fulham, Enderby 
Wharf in Greenwich and Nine Elms Point 
in Vauxhall.
Targeted land buying
A key driver of the transformation of our 
business in recent years has been our 
land investment strategy. Since 2009 
we have approved the investment of 
£4.8bn in land for new homes and this 
has boosted returns and led to increased 
completion volumes.
During the year conditions in the land 
market remained encouraging in terms 
of the availability of attractive high return 
sites across all regions. We successfully 
continued our investment strategy of 
targeting high quality operational land 
that meets or exceeds our minimum 
hurdle rates set on acquisition; a 20% 
gross margin and a 25% site ROCE. In the 
year we committed to land expenditure of 
£957.0m (2014: £1,198.1m) covering 16,956 
plots (2014: 21,478 plots), the appropriate 
level to maintain our controlled land bank 
at our target of c. 4.5 years. As at 30 June 
2015 our owned and controlled land bank 
stood at 70,523 plots equating to 4.5 years 
of production.

Fulham Riverside,

Public land remains an excellent source of 
land for the Group. The Government has 
increased its commitment to releasing 
public sector land with 150,000 plots to be 
delivered by 2020. In the more competitive 
South East and London land markets, 
public land is an important alternative 
source of land supply. Barratt is very well 
positioned to maximise this opportunity 
with our unique public sector land team 
and membership of all HCA Delivery 
Partner Panels. We have the expertise 
and the capability to secure and deliver 
what are often large and highly complex 
developments. Our track record 
demonstrates this with 70% of bids 
won over the past year. Our public land 
developments achieve at least 20% hurdle 
rate gross margin with ROCE generally 
significantly higher than our 25% hurdle 
rate, reflecting the attractive deferred 
payment terms often available.
As we progress the transformation of 
our operational land bank, the Group is 
focused on securing our longer term land 
supply. Through the acquisition of options 
over strategic land we are focused on 
securing our land pipeline out to 2020 and 
beyond, whilst minimising risk and capital 
employed. We made further good progress 
in the year, with a strategic portfolio of 
71,600 plots (2014: 69,200 plots) equating 
to 284 sites (2014: 260 sites). We have 
seen a significant step up in the delivery 
of strategic land, with 17% (2014: 10%) of 
total completions being delivered from 
strategically sourced land in the year, 
progressing towards our target of 20% 
in FY17.
We have been encouraged by the capability 
of our business to bring forward land 
through the planning system within the 
context of the National Planning Policy 
Framework. We now have full or outline 
planning permission in place for all of our 
expected completions in FY16 and 89% of 
expected production in FY17. 
Improving efficiency and reducing costs
Improving the efficiency of our operations 
and controlling costs has continued to be a 
high priority for the Group in a recovering 
market. We are pleased that overall build 
cost inflation for FY15 has been limited to 
c. 3.5%, in line with expectations, and for 
FY16 we expect build costs to increase by a 
similar amount. 
We have a robust and carefully managed 
supply chain with 85% of our build 
materials sourced through our centralised 
procurement function. We have effectively 
sourced the raw materials required to 
underpin our controlled volume growth 
and over 90% of our material costs are 
now fixed until the end of FY16. 
On labour, whilst we have seen an increase 
in the supply of skilled subcontractors 
over the past year, there remains an 
industry shortage, with increases in 
labour costs remaining the largest driver 
of overall build cost inflation. We are 
well placed and continue to have the 
necessary labour to meet our operational 
and quality requirements. We are also 
seeking to increase efficiency through 
the use of timber frame on some of our 
sites and the use of alternative off-site 
manufacturing options, including closed 
panel roof solutions.  
More generally on costs, we have 
continued to focus on the broader 
efficiency of our business with process 
reviews being undertaken in the areas of 
commercial, sales and marketing. 
Commercial developments
Outside London and the South East, the 
commercial occupier market is showing 
signs of increasing confidence. Since the 
downturn, demand has been mainly 
satisfied by the availability of second-hand 
space and with this accommodation now 
largely filled, occupiers have turned their 
attention to new commercial build. This is 
presenting cost challenges as a result 
of the reduction in construction capacity 
following the downturn.  Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Strategic Report Governance Other Information Financial Statements
Demand is currently driven by 
e-commerce logistics requirements 
and in the last 12 months we have seen 
the return of institutional funding to 
this sector. We have used institutional 
funding for 600,000 sq. ft. of logistics 
buildings, with a further 200,000 sq. ft. 
in the immediate pipeline. Wilson Bowden 
Developments is also now focusing 
on mixed use residential and leisure 
schemes, such as in Hounslow, where 
together with Barratt London, it has 
entered into a conditional contract with 
the Local Authority to deliver 120,000 sq. 
ft. of commercial leisure facilities and 
530 flats.
Commercial development revenue was 
£57.2m (2014: £14.4m) with an operating 
profit of £6.1m (2014: loss of £1.0m). 
Our Hinckley scheme, which comprises 
200,000 sq. ft. of retail and leisure space, 
achieved completion of the foodstore 
element during the year with full project 
completion due in FY16 along with our 
Derby development, which comprises a 
hotel and 46 flats. 
Going forward our commercial division 
will work closely with our housebuilding 
business to develop mixed-use schemes, 
and will seek to develop independent 
commercial schemes where they can 
be forward funded by third parties prior 
to commencement.
Our objectives
Our strategic objectives remain clear – to 
continue to build the Group’s profitability, 
drive return on capital employed and 
maintain an appropriate capital structure, 
whilst offering attractive cash returns to 
our shareholders. 
We have made further good progress 
against these objectives in the year with 
gross margin increasing by 220 basis 
points to 19.0% (2014: 16.8%) and ROCE 
increasing by 440 basis points to 23.9% 
(2014: 19.5%). The Group ended the year 
with net cash of £186.5m (2014: net 
cash £73.1m) and land creditors at 35% 
(2014: 33%) of the owned land bank.
We continue to make very good progress 
towards achieving our FY17 targets of at 
least 20% gross margin and at least 25% 
ROCE and are committed to delivering 
them as early as possible. In particular, 
the run-down of the Group’s low or 
zero margin legacy assets will drive 
improvements in ROCE.
This strong financial performance 
supports the Group’s Capital Return Plan 
and dividend policy. We are delighted to 
propose a final dividend of 10.3 pence 
per share (2014: 7.1 pence per share) 
resulting in a total ordinary dividend 
for the year up 46.6% to 15.1 pence per 
share (2014: 10.3 pence per share) and 
the first of our special cash payments 
totalling £100m, equivalent to 10.0 pence 
per share, payable in November 2015. 
This reflects our ordinary dividend policy 
of the dividend being covered three times 
by earnings, supplemented by the special 
cash payments to November 2017 totalling 
£400m.
Health and safety
Increased activity levels across the industry 
in terms of site openings and production 
volumes combined with shortages of skilled 
staff has increased the risks of accidents on 
sites. In the twelve months to 30 June 2015 
we had 381 (2014: 379) reportable incidents 
per 100,000 employees. We remain focused 
on continuing to enhance health and 
safety performance across our business. 
We have established a Board level Safety, 
Health and Environment Committee in the 
year, had our safety management status 
independently assessed by the British 
Safety Council which awarded us five star 
status, and introduced a number of new 
initiatives including our ‘Five Steps to Safety’ 
programme to promote the importance  
of a safe working environment.
Our priorities 
To continue to deliver leading financial 
performance and maximise sustainable 
returns for our shareholders by focusing 
upon our clear set of priorities – Customer 
First, Great Places, Leading Construction 
and Investing in our People. 
Each of these priorities has a work 
plan to drive improvements across the 
business and they are supported by 
a set of principles that underpin all of 
our operations. 
Customer first
We place customers at the heart of our 
business by building outstanding homes 
and anticipating the changing needs of 
home buyers. 
We are the only major national 
housebuilder to achieve the Home Builders 
Federation Five Star quality status for 
six consecutive years, with over 90% of 
customers being prepared to recommend 
us to a friend. 
We are continuing to improve the quality 
and efficiency of the way in which we deal 
with customers through the sales process. 
During the year new customer service 
systems were rolled out to divisions to 
speed up and improve the efficiency of our 
service and a new customer contact centre 
was put in place. 
We have introduced a ‘Future Homes’ 
project to inform design direction in terms 
of customer trends and preferences. 
As well as carefully defining customer 
segments and their design preferences, 
we are working with The Architects’ 
Journal to select new house design 
features to meet these requirements. 
Great places
A key focus of the organisation continues to 
be building relationships with landowners 
to ensure that we can acquire the right 
land and then create outstanding places 
to live. Our objective is to be the partner of 
choice for landowners by demonstrating 
our ability to achieve planning permission 
and create value. 
During the year we made significant 
progress in terms of securing the right 
operational land, continued our success in 
winning public sector land and increased 
investment in longer term strategic sites.
We are now using the Design Council/
CABE Building for Life process extensively 
and are winning more design awards than 
any other major housebuilder. We have 
now achieved Building for Life awards on 
33 sites.  Barratt Developments PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Strategic Report – Chief Executive’s statement continued
Leading construction 
We are focused on a ‘right first time’ 
approach as the most efficient way 
of operating across all aspects of our 
building processes with a continuous 
focus on improving build quality. 
During the year we analysed thousands 
of comments from our customers and 
used them to identify where we needed to 
enhance the quality of some components. 
This ‘ getting it right first time’ approach 
will drive improved efficiency through 
reducing remedial costs and improve 
customer satisfaction. 
We are implementing a number of  
quick wins in terms of lowering build 
costs, for example we expect to build  
c. 1,300 timber frame homes in FY16. 
Other innovations in the build process 
implemented during the year include  
new roofing and flooring solutions  
and we have started to trial other  
new products having assessed over  
100 off-site construction suppliers. 
We are also looking to embrace the best 
methods of on and off-site construction  
to increase efficiency.
Our site managers continue to lead  
the industry and during the year we  
won 81 NHBC Pride in the Job awards. 
This was the 11
th
 year in succession that 
our site managers have won more of 
these awards than any other company. 
Investing in our people
The building and construction industry 
continues to face a shortage of skilled 
workers and attracting and retaining the 
best people is an important priority for 
the business. We aim to have a diverse 
workforce that reflects the communities in 
which we operate, delivering excellence for 
our customers and business by drawing on a 
diverse range of talent, skills and experience.  
We have continued with our graduate 
and apprentice programmes and have 
recruited our largest ever intake of future 
talent. In addition, we have trained or 
are training 60 employees through our 
Foundation Degree Programme with 
Sheffield Hallam University. 
We are piloting a Regional Academy in 
our East region targeting a wider mix of 
potential employees and are continuing 
to support the wider industry focus on 
addressing the skills shortage. 
Current trading
The sales performance across the Group 
has been strong for the first 10 weeks 
of FY16, with net private reservations 
per week of 257 (FY15: 224), resulting in 
average net private reservations per active 
site per week of 0.68 (FY15: 0.62). 
Our total forward sales (including JV’s) 
as at 6 September 2015 were up 32.2% on 
the strong prior year figures at a value of 
£2,321.9m (7 September 2014: £1,755.7m), 
equating to 10,755 plots (7 September 
2014: 8,507 plots).
We expect FY 16 full year completion 
volumes for the Group to be around 
15,750, plus around 1,000 completions 
delivered through our JV portfolio giving 
total completions of around 16,750 
(FY15: 16,447) in line with our target of 
controlled volume growth.

Outlook
The fundamentals for the market 
remain very positive with strong 
demand for new housing across Britain. 
The lending environment is supportive 
with the borrowing rates on offer to our 
customers remaining at extremely low 
levels. The Government is committed to 
increasing the supply of new homes, we 
have greater clarity on housing policy, 
and in particular believe the extension 
of the Help to Buy (Equity Loan) Scheme 
through to 2020 in England will support an 
increase in new housing supply. The land 
market remains attractive and we continue 
to secure excellent new development 
opportunities across all regions that at 
least meet our minimum hurdle rates.
I am proud to lead our first class team 
and we are all determined to build 
on our outstanding operational and 
financial performance and to drive 
further efficiencies across the business. 
Current trading is strong, we are confident 
on the outlook, and expect to make further 
good progress in the current financial year.

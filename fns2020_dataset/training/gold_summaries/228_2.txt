Commenting on the results, James Kerr-Muir, Chairman, said:
“As leaders in their fields, BRC and Stadco are well placed to benefit from the opportunities and to face the
challenges that their respective markets bring. Although 2007 has been a difficult year, we are moving into 2008
with an improving control environment and with new senior management in certain key positions. 
Current trading in BRC is dominated by the exceptional increase in the price of steel in world markets. Its effect on
the supply chain and on demand is a concern. However, BRC should make progress in 2008, based on its strong
order book and on good underlying demand in key infrastructure sectors. 
Sales at Stadco have started the year well, although margins continue to be under pressure. Whilst we do not
expect 2008 to see progress at Stadco compared with last year, the ground will be laid for improvement in 2009. 
Overall, we expect that Acertec’s underlying performance in 2008 will be similar to that in 2007.”

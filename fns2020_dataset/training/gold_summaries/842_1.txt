 Chief executive’ s review
Solid performance across 
all business segments
“The strength
of our portfolio
of Project Equity
Investments has
really come
through this year”
Sir Peter Mason KBE
Chief executive
AMEC made solid progress in 2004 and 
on 22 November was reclassified to the
Support Services Sector of the London
Stock Exchange by the FTSE Global
Classification Committee. This change 
of stock market sector, which recognises
the shift in the balance of AMEC’s activities
towards services, was followed on
2 December 2004 by the announcement 
of a revised statutory segmental analysis,
which better reflects the ongoing business
portfolio. The segments are Engineering
and Technical Services (“ETS”), Oil and Gas
and Project Solutions. 
26 AMEC plc annual report 2004 Business review
Engineering and T echnical
Services
With turnover of £2.3 billion, representing
47 per cent of total turnover in 2004, 
ETS is the largest of AMEC’s three
business segments.
This business delivered another robust
performance in 2004, with total operating
profit up 7.9 per cent. 
Multitechnical Services
2004 was another year of robust
performance, with increased activity
reflecting organic growth, driven broadly 
by levels of economic activity, together with
a series of eight small acquisitions that
extended the local services network 
and capability in France, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain. This business will
continue to follow the same growth
strategy in 2005, targeting further 
volume growth and an improved margin,
particularly in Benelux.
Environmental Services
2004 was a record year, with increased
levels of activity under a framework
contract for the US Air Force in locations
including Iraq and Guam. The Geomelt
contract for the US Department of Energy
at Hanford, initially valued at US$60 million,
continues to make progress and the first
full scale nuclear waste vitrification is due
to be completed by the end of 2005.
New offices are being opened in a number
of countries and this pattern of customer-
driven expansion is expected to continue
steadily with increasing demand for
environmental services.
Design and Engineering Services
Performance in 2004 was mixed.
In the UK, AMEC is active on framework
contracts for clients that include BAA and 
the Ministry of Defence. There are also
specific future opportunities, including 
the restructuring of the nuclear industry
which opens to private sector companies
from April 2005.
AMEC plc annual report 2004 27 AMEC is one of the few companies with the
expertise and relationships to pursue the
£2 billion of work that the UK government
estimates will be available on an annual
basis and is positioning itself to compete 
in that market. 
Investment in US industrial markets remains
low. While some sectors, like mining, are
now very busy, others, such as food and
forest products, have yet to show any signs
of recovery. AMEC has taken further action
to reduce the cost base in response. 
AMEC is working in Iraq under various
contracts to restore damaged infrastructure,
including power generation and water . 
Task orders under these contracts have, 
as expected, taken some time to come 
through and safety and security remain 
of paramount importance. Firm awards 
to date to the AMEC Fluor joint venture
amount to around US$730 million, although
the final value could be much higher . In
addition, AMEC has received direct orders
totalling around US$130 million. These
contracts continue to carry no commercial
risk as they are all fully cost reimbursable.
Activity in Iraq made a small contribution in
2004, and whilst conditions remain volatile
and it is difficult to predict rates of progress
on specific tasks, this contribution is
expected to increase in 2005. 
AMEC is committed to a long-term presence
in Iraq and is exploring opportunities in the
country and in the region.

This business generated turnover of 
£1.2 billion, representing 25 per cent 
of total turnover in 2004.
Activity levels remained high and the
quality of earnings was improved, with
operating margin increasing to 4.7 per 
cent (2003: 4.3 per cent).
During 2004, the services’ business
increased levels of international activity 
in regions including the Gulf of Mexico,
West Africa, Caspian, Canada and Asia
Pacific. 
The business has extended its portfolio of
services into gas storage and pipeline
design and strengthened its position in
brownfield projects, operations and asset
support services. More work was secured
from an increasing range of customers,
including the Kuwait Oil Company, the
Korean National Oil Company and
Woodside of Australia. 
The Canadian oil sands business is busy,
as more efficient extraction methods and 
a strong oil price have made the region’s
resources more profitable to develop,
whilst the pipelines business was active
during 2004 on a range of projects
including the BTC pipelines in Georgia and
the Cheyenne Plains project in the US.
Since the year-end, the acquisition of
Paragon, the Houston-based design and
engineering company, has significantly
improved AMEC’s competitive position in
the main decision-making centre for the
global oil and gas industry. 
Paragon allows AMEC to provide a more
complete service to customers in the Gulf
of Mexico region. It has acknowledged 
sub-sea pipeline design capability and is 
working on projects including the complex
Mardi Gras project for BP . 
Paragon positions AMEC as a top tier
designer and project manager in Houston,
in addition to strengthening its engineering
and asset support relationships with
customers such as Chevron/Texaco,
Marathon and Pemex. 
During 2004 AMEC completed the vast
majority of its upstream lump sum
contracts, with the remainder expected to
be completed during the first half of 2005.
These contracts are being replaced with
more stable, long-term services and the oil
and gas order book for 2005 is up year-on-
year despite a reduction in these lump-
sum contracts.

Project Solutions
This segment, which is generally involved
with large infrastructure projects, generated
turnover of £1.4 billion, representing 
28 per cent of total turnover in 2004. 
Performance in the Project Solutions
business was steady, following AMEC’s exit
in the first half of 2004 from US Construction
Management and the disposal of AMEC’s
remaining 49 per cent interest in the 
regional French construction business 
Spie Batignolles. 
Project Solutions includes AMEC’s activities
in PPP, Developments and Wind Energy,
which reported an operating profit of 
£20 million, a 10 per cent improvement 
on 2003.
Construction Services
This business has strong relationships with
clients both in the public and private sectors
and was active in 2004 on major projects 
in defence, transport, healthcare and
infrastructure markets.
In 2004, good progress was made in
delivering the Docklands Light Railway
extension, and the University College London
Hospital is heading to completion on time
and on budget.
PPP
In 2004, AMEC’s share of the operating
profit of its PPP concessions was 
£10.8 million (2003: £10.6 million) and 
after taking into account the share of 
net interest payable, resulted in a small 
net contribution.
Since the year-end AMEC’s PPP portfolio
has been strengthened through the award
of preferred bidder status for Colchester
Hospital, the Docklands Light Railway
extension to Woolwich Arsenal and South
Lanarkshire Schools. In total these projects
have a value to AMEC in excess of £600
million. AMEC is also at preferred bidder 
stage on Incheon Bridge in South Korea, 
where financial close is expected shortly.
Over the coming years, AMEC expects  to
achieve increasing earnings from this
portfolio, either from the sale of its
investments or from increasing the
contribution from operational concessions.
Developments
AMEC has built a leading reputation in
urban regeneration, working in partnership
with landowners such as local authorities
and private sector organisations. Over a
dozen schemes were under development
during 2004, including projects in Reading
and Durham. During the year an AMEC
joint venture was awarded a major scheme
to regenerate Lewisham town centre.
Planning approval is expected for about
three million square feet of developments
in 2005, a threefold increase on the
previous year .
Wind Energy
AMEC is developing an onshore portfolio 
of around 1,500 MW, including third parties’
shares of developments being managed 
by AMEC. Its offshore developments have
all been pre-sold, although AMEC continues
to be involved in project management 
for the owner, with work that carries
performance incentives as well as
management fees.
During 2004, AMEC submitted planning
applications for major schemes at Kyle and
the Isle of Lewis in Scotland, the latter 
being potentially the world’s largest
onshore windfarm. 
The planning process is extremely slow and
at the end of 2004 a very large percentage of
the portfolio remained in planning. Over the
next few years an increasing number of
schemes are expected to emerge from
planning, enabling AMEC to commence
construction and to release value from its
onshore portfolio.

Orders
Order intake in the ETS business continues
to exceed sales, whilst the year-end order
book in AMEC’s Oil and Gas and Projects
Solutions businesses remained solid at
£2.4 billion (2003: £2.4 billion). 
The quality and volume of the order book 
in Oil and Gas has improved over the last
12 months, with large project delivery
contracts being replaced by higher margin,
lower risk services activities. The year-end 
order book in Oil and Gas stood at £1.3 billion
(2003: £1.2 billion), whilst Project Solutions
recorded £1.1 billion (2003: £1.2 billion). 
Sustainability
2004 was a year of progress, with
improvements in our overall performance
in health and safety, environment,
community and employment. However, 
it is really unacceptable that the number 
of fatalities at work increased compared to
the previous year and yet further efforts are
being taken to ensure a safer year in 2005.
An overview of 2004 appears on page 21 
of this report and the sustainability report
will be published in late April 2005. 
Outlook
The board remains confident that each of
AMEC’s three business segments will deliver
further growth in 2005 in line with its earlier
expectations, even after the transfer of UK
rail maintenance contracts to Network Rail
and the disposal of Spie Batignolles, which
together represented about £10 million 
of total operating profit in 2004.

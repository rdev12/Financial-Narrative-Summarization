 chie F executive’s review
In 2016, the Group achieved 
market leading growth in 
its UK real money gaming 
business, integrated its 
new social business, built 
award winning content 
to complement its newly 
acquired IP and executed 
unique strategic partnerships 
with globally recognized 
brand licensors and 
gaming licensees.
Overview
The investment in both our proprietary 
platform and marketing has resulted in 
excellent growth in a competitive uK 
market place by allowing us to focus on 
a younger mobile based audience. Mobile 
now accounts for 84.0% (2015: 78.3%) 
of our player base. 
Growth in 2016 has been supported by 
key media deals with Fremantle including 
The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent, which 
have allowed us to offer a more targeted 
gambling offering to our key demographic. 
We have augmented this by the in-house 
creation of 8 new unique ‘Slingo Original’ 
mobile games, which account for over 
£101m (2015: £56m) in wagering on the 
platform or 17% of the gross gaming 
revenue for the year. The most recent 
game Magic Mine is truly original in 
combining skill and chance as it attempts 
to mirror the ‘fun element’ of many social 
games, which are lacking in harder edged 
gambling products.
Overall wagering has increased by 51% to 
£609m (2015: £404m) and deposits have 
more than doubled to £49.0m (2015: 
£24.0m). As a more established platform 
we have been able to reduce bonus costs 
to 29% (2015: 43%) of gross gaming

SET FOR
GROWTH
06 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 revenue and lessen direct costs associated 
with the operation to 35% (2015: 42%) of 
revenue. This has allowed greater focus on 
marketing and revenue growth in the year. 
Demand for our unique content has been 
such that it has led to the development of 
a Remote Game Server (‘RGS’) which allows 
our ‘Slingo Original’ games to be licensed 
to third party operators as premium 
content. This will form an increasing part 
of our strategy in 2017 as we look 
to differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors, as well as expand the 
reach of our content into new territories. 
Licensing deals to Zynga, Scientific Games 
and Instant Win Games in 2016 have paved 
the way for further deployment of our 
content into new jurisdictions such as 
Quebec through the Provincial Lottery 
monopoly and New Jersey through 
iGaming and Pala Interactive.
We have further integrated the social 
business, bought from Real Networks in 
2015, with the creation of a shared 
development path which now allows us to 
deliver content simultaneously to both real 
money gaming and social audiences. The 
first offering in this regard is Slingo Arcade 
which, following launch in late Q4/16 
rapidly has become the second highest 
grossing social app, scaling to an average 
of $8,000 per day in March 2017. In future, 
emphasis will be on using this channel to 
monetize content developed for real 
money gaming similar to licensing our 
content to third party operators. This will 
have resulted in a reduction in headcount 
from 53 in June 2016 to approximately 29 
in June 2017 within social publishing.
disposal of non-core assets
During the year we disposed of our 
non-core legacy third party platform assets 
which has allowed us to focus resources on 
our higher margin proprietary mobile 
gaming platform and our own high 
performance game content.
The disposal of our in-house digital 
marketing agency in a strategic 
partnership between Gaming Realms and 
Ayima, has allowed the Group to benefit 
from an enlarged marketing capability. 
We have been seeing the benefits of this 
on our acquisition channels on Grizzly. 
marketing
As a result of our marketing strategy our 
cost per acquisition on our Grizzly platform 
was £86 (2015: £79), one of the lowest 
across the industry for a uK casino and we 
gained 1 16,349 (2015: 78,198) new 
depositing players in the year. Our revenue 
per depositing player increased 22% to 
£153 (2015: £125) which is reflective of 
the greater operational improvements in 
the business despite a lower than normal 
gaming margin in H2.

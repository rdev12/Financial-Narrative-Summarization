Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
JEFF HARRIS
RESULTS
This is my second report to shareholders and 
over the past year I have spent more time 
visiting Cookson’s operations and meeting 
with management and employees. I continue 
to be impressed by the underlying strength of 
our businesses, and by the commitment both 
to improving productivity and new product 
innovation so as to add value to our customers. 
Both the Engineered Ceramics division and the 
Performance Materials division have strong 
global market positions, competitive cost bases, 
and see profitable growth as a result of their 
continued investment in product innovation.  
We have renamed the divisions to better reflect 
the true nature of their activities. 
Cookson’ s results for 2011 clearly reflect the benefits 
of all these strengths, and show that we are making 
very encouraging progress on the three year 
targets we set out at the start of 2011.  Revenue 
grew by 11% to £2,826m, headline profit before 
tax increased by 18% to £261m, and headline 
earnings per share increased by 14% to 70.4 pence. 
Our financial position is strong with ample liquidity 
under our long-term financing arrangements.
Earlier in the year, when growth in some 
international markets looked uncertain, we 
made contingency plans for any further global 
economic downturn. This has not occurred and 
the outlook today is significantly more positive. 
DIVIDEND
Given the good trading performance in 2011 and 
the outlook for 2012, the Board is recommending a 
final dividend of 14.50p per share (2010: 11.50p), an 
increase of 26% and in line with our stated target of 
growing dividends ahead of earnings growth. 
T ogether with the interim dividend of 7.25p per 
share, this gives a total dividend for the year of 
21.75p per share (2010: 11.50p), an increase of 89%.
BOARD CHANGES
Dr Emma FitzGerald joined the Board as a 
non-executive Director on 1 August 2011.  
Dr FitzGerald is Vice President, Global Retail 
Network for Shell International and has 
extensive experience of the Asia-Pacific region 
having served on boards in Korea and China. 
We recently announced that Steven Corbett, 
President and Chief Executive Officer of Cookson’s 
Performance Materials division, will join the Board 
with effect from 1 May 2012. Mr Corbett joined 
Cookson’s Electronics division in 1990 and was 
promoted to his current role in 2004.
As reported in my last Chairman’s Statement, 
Barry Perry retired from the Board at the close of 
the Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2011. 
He had served with distinction as a Non-
executive Director since 2002.
GOVERNANCE
Good governance continues to be an essential 
element in the conduct of the Group’s affairs. The 
Board acknowledges, as a prime responsibility, its 
oversight of the Group’s strategy and 
performance. We believe that good governance, 
as evidenced by an effective Board, rigorous 
performance management, strong controls and 
risk appraisal and a culture of integrity, will best 
deliver long-term shareholder value.
DIVERSITY
Cookson looks at diversity in its broadest sense, as 
we feel it is important to get the right balance of 
independence, skills, knowledge and experience, 
both on the Board and across our business.
Ours is a global business employing over 15,000 
people in more than 40 countries; our 
management grades alone comprise over 40 
nationalities. Diversity is therefore an integral 
part of how we do business. We acknowledge its 
importance and recognise the benefits that 
different perspectives can bring. In recruiting 
our employees we draw on a varied range of 
backgrounds and expertise, benefitting from all 
dimensions of diversity including cultural and 
gender diversity. 
We support the broad thrust of the Davies 
report. We are pleased to have Dr Emma 
FitzGerald join our Board. In 2011 we also 
appointed our first female Divisional Chief 
Executive Officer. We aspire to increase such 
representation in the future.
Our Board appointments have been and will 
continue to be made on merit against objective 
criteria, selecting the best candidate for the post.  
Cookson will only use executive search firms that 
have adopted the Voluntary Code of Conduct 
addressing gender diversity and best practice.
PEOPLE
Our employees are key to the Group’s success.  
Their commitment and dedication is critical in 
achieving our goals and I pay tribute to them.  
The significant improvement in the Group’s 
performance is a credit to the hard work of 
Cookson employees around the globe.

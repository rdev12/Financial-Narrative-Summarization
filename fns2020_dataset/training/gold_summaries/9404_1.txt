LiDCO Annual Report
2012/13
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
Dr Terence O’Brien  
Chief Executive Oﬃcer
I am pleased to report the results of a very productive twelve months 
where we have grown revenues, launched a new product that 
doubles our addressable market to a $2 billion recurring revenue 
opportunity, and commenced sales of LiDCOrapid into the Japanese 
market. We reinforced our position in the US through acquiring the 
installed base of 230 monitors; raised £2.21 million (net), part of 
which funded the US purchases; saw further clinical data published 
showing that LiDCOrapid improves patient outcomes; and have been 
active in further securing a global intellectual property portfolio  
to protect our technology. We are also seeing in the  
UK strong commitment and progress towards an NHS  
objective of doubling the number of surgical patients  
receiving ﬂuid monitoring. 
Overview
Our new product development has been 
achieved at considerable pace – we have 
completed this project on budget, within 
twelve months and produced a product 
that is truly innovative. LiDCO believe that 
the LiDCOrapidv2 with Unity software is 
game-changing in that now all surgery 
patients can be non-invasively monitored, 
allowing the user to achieve optimal blood 
pressure and ﬂuid management, while 
simultaneously ﬁnely titrating the level  
of anesthesia. We will initially market our 
new integrated monitor to address the  
10 million high-risk surgical patients 
worldwide that would beneﬁt most.  
Our customers are already energised about 
both the surgical use and the potential 
utility of the product beyond surgery, into 
what could prove to be widespread use in 
non-surgical settings. We will explore these 
additional applications and expect in time 
these could add considerably to what we 
see as the current market opportunity. 
In February of this year we announced  
the registration and launch in Europe  
of the new LiDCOrapidv2 monitor with 
Unity software. This is the world’s ﬁrst 
non-invasive multi parameter monitor 
speciﬁcally designed for continuous 
non-invasive blood pressure, ﬂuid and 
consciousness monitoring of high-risk 
surgery patients. We believe our innovative 
monitor sets a new standard through 
displaying in an integrated fashion a 
number of the more recent advances in 
peri-operative care monitoring. Through 
the addition of the non-invasive option  
our technology can now be used in many 
more locations within the hospital. Initial 
customer response to the product has 
been extremely encouraging and sales 
have been made to both UK and European 
hospitals. First generation LiDCOrapid 
customers can access the technology 
through a software upgrade and  
addition of the non-invasive and level of 
consciousness modules. Our expectation  
is that the additional utility that the 
LiDCOrapidv2 brings will signiﬁcantly 
increase disposable revenues from both 
existing and new customers. 
During the period we have achieved 
registration, reimbursement and the ﬁrst 
monitor sales into the world’s second 
biggest market for hemodynamic 
monitoring – Japan – for the LiDCOrapid. 
We are only the second technology to 
achieve cardiac output reimbursement in 
Japan and also announced during the year 
that we had signed a strong Japanese 
distribution partner, Nihon Kohden. 
Furthermore, in protecting our intellectual 
property, we were delighted to report last 
month that the Japanese Patent Oﬃce had 
granted a patent protecting the Graphical 
User Interface (“GUI”) of the LiDCOrapid 
monitor in Japan. The distinctive display of 
hemodynamic parameters by LiDCO’s GUI 
makes the touch-screen monitor unique 
and easier to interpret than traditional 
displays. This GUI forms the structure of the 
screen displayed by the new LiDCOrapidv2 
with Unity software. A patent protecting 
our LiDCOrapid GUI was granted in the  
EU in September 2011 and is currently 
pending in the US. We vigorously pursue 
patent protection and have a number  
of other patents pending that we believe 
cover both core aspects of our signal 
processing technology and the integration 
and display of additional parameters in  
the LiDCOrapidv2. 
The US is our largest export territory and 
represents our second largest installed  
base of monitors and disposable sales  
(after the UK). Having reviewed sales 
progress in the US, we felt that although 
our distribution partner, Covidien, had 
made some progress, they were unwilling 
to give the LiDCO products suﬃcient 
dedicated sales time to achieve their 
contractual minimum purchase obligations. 
After discussion, we agreed to continue 
working collaboratively with Covidien  
on an OEM licensing relationship, with 
LiDCO integrating Covidien’s level of 
consciousness technology into the 
LiDCOrapidv2.  9
LiDCO Annual Report
2012/13
During the period  
we have achieved registration, 
reimbursement and the ﬁrst  
monitor sales into the world’s  
second biggest market  
for hemodynamic monitoring –  
Japan – for the LiDCOrapid.
LiDCO re-assumed direct responsibility  
for LiDCOrapid sales and subsequently 
purchased back the remaining inventory, 
the US monitor installed base, and their 
associated high margin disposable sales 
income. These distribution changes 
inevitably negatively aﬀected US sales in  
the second half. We are now growing our 
own direct US sales force to drive sales 
growth through increasing disposable  
use and establishing additional accounts. 
Our expectation is that we will further 
improve our market access for US sales of 
the LiDCOrapidv2 through the appointment 
of one or more distribution partners, and 
we are progressing discussions with a 
number of parties.
In the UK, the surgical monitoring market 
continues to grow strongly. We are 
delighted to report excellent progress  
with surgical disposables revenue growth  
of 79% over the prior year. This growth  
is expected to continue as, over the next 
twelve months, the NHS in England is 
committed to driving adoption and is 
providing payment incentives aimed to 
double the numbers of surgery patients 
receiving ﬂuid monitoring. 
Furthermore, in November new guidance 
from the UK’s National Institute for  
Health and Clinical Excellence (“NICE”) 
recommended the use of level of 
consciousness monitors during general 
surgery for higher risk surgery patients.  
Such technology is now accessible through 
the new LiDCOrapidv2 monitor, which uses 
Covidien’s Bispectral Index (“BIS™”). BIS was 
highlighted in the NICE report as showing 
the strongest evidence of clinical beneﬁt. 
This recommendation built on the  
previous guidance from NICE and the 
Commissioning for Quality and Innovation 
(“CQUIN”) payment framework, both  
of which support intra-operative ﬂuid 
management monitoring for high risk 
surgery patients. The LiDCOrapidv2 with 
Unity software is therefore a single  
monitor solution that satisﬁes both  
NICE recommendations and CQUIN 
requirements for high risk surgery patients. 
Combining these features into a single 
monitor makes use of the LiDCOrapidv2 
highly appealing compared to our 
competitors’ older, single parameter 
technologies. 
The main territories for us are the UK,  
which we believe is the fastest growing 
market for surgical monitoring in Europe, 
and the major export markets of the  
US and Japan. The global market for 
hemodynamic monitoring disposable  
sales into the high risk surgery patient 
population represents a potential recurring 
revenue stream of $2 billion per annum.  
We believe that our technology is now 
best-in-class and capable of taking a very 
signiﬁcant share of this growing surgical 
monitoring market. 
Worldwide, hospitals are coming under 
increasing pressure to adopt ﬂuid 
management monitoring, as it both 
increases the quality of healthcare provision, 
and reduces the costs of post-operative 
care. As LiDCO’s technology can now be 
used completely non-invasively, it has 
become a more broadly applicable and  
easy way of delivering such care. 
The last 20 years have seen the emergence 
of a number of other complementary 
monitoring parameters that are increasingly 
used in surgical and intensive care settings. 
Going forward LiDCO strongly believes the 
convergence of all of these parameters  
into an integrated monitor capable of 
simultaneous and integrated display is a fast 
developing and key customer requirement. 
As such it is our intention to continue  
with our strategy of converging additional 
parameters into the LiDCOrapidv2 platform 
- thus allowing other important modalities 
to be monitored through a common 
hardware platform and co-displayed for 
greater impact. Our next target parameters 
are those that when integrated should 
enhance the utility of our monitor in both 
cardiac surgery and for the monitoring of 
shock and sepsis patients. 
Alongside the integration of multiple 
parameters, the use of less invasive 
hemodynamic monitoring has generated  
a hard-to-refute body of clinical evidence 
regarding cost eﬀectiveness that underpins 
ever wider non-invasive clinical usage. Now 
available with a simple to use non-invasive 
option, we believe that LiDCOrapidv2 will 
ﬁnd ever wider applications, both in and 
outside of surgery, and we hope will 
become commonplace in the management 
of any patient requiring acute care. 
The introduction of LiDCOrapidv2 providing 
a non-invasive, multi parameter monitoring 
platform is a signiﬁcant technological 
advance. We expect this will result in these 
measurements taking an increasingly strong 
role in the anesthetic management of a 
much larger population of high-risk general 
surgical patients. Even wider scale adoption 
of LiDCO’s technology will, we believe, 
signiﬁcantly improve clinical outcomes for 
high risk patients undergoing surgery, while 
providing major cost savings to hospitals.  10
LiDCO Annual Report
2012/13
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
Revenue and trading
Revenues for the full year were £7.21 million 
(2011/12 £7.12 million). LiDCO received  
no license fees during this ﬁnancial year 
(2011/12: £540,000) therefore excluding 
license fees, product revenues increased  
by approximately 9% – driven by a strong 
performance in the UK. Top line revenue 
growth was negatively aﬀected by the 
disruption around the distribution changes 
in the US (referred to above). We also had  
to see out a degree of destocking by 
distributors in the EU. Both the US and EU 
territories are expected to return to growth 
in 2013 together with increasing revenue 
contribution from Japan. Sales in the UK  
are expected to continue to grow strongly, 
particularly in high risk surgical monitoring 
as more hospitals comply with NICE and 
CQUIN requirements for ﬂuid and level of 
consciousness monitoring. 
Markets breakdown
Global markets
The priority markets for LiDCO at this time 
are the UK, US and Japan. The latter two are 
the world’s ﬁrst and second largest markets 
by size (estimated at $650m and $420m 
respectively) representing a total of  
around 5 million high risk surgery patients 
per annum. 
UK markets
In our domestic UK market sales continued 
to grow strongly, up by 33% to £4.93 
million (2011/12: £3.70 million). This was 
the result of increases in both our third 
party distributed revenues (up £520,000) 
and excellent growth in both LiDCO 
monitors and disposables sales (up 
£651,000). Total (surgery and critical care) 
UK disposable unit sales increased 29% 
from 21,045 to 27,155 units and sold/
placed LiDCOrapid monitors were up  
57% at 77 (2011/12: 49 units). Growth  
of unit sales of surgical disposables was 
particularly signiﬁcant at 70% up on the 
prior year, a reﬂection of both the increased 
installed base and average use up from  
4.7 to 5.1 disposables per month. LiDCOplus 
monitor sales/placements of 14 units  
were marginally lower than the prior year 
(2011/12: 17 units), however disposables 
units were stable at 12,300 with sales  
value up 10% to £1.47 million (2011/12: 
£1.33 million).
through providing more in-service support 
to existing customers. In order to do so  
we are increasing our own US sales and 
nurse educator presence and expect to  
see signiﬁcant sales growth in 2013 both 
through increasing monthly disposable use 
rates and also incrementing the installed 
base. We continue to have discussions with 
potential distribution partners for the US 
market, who are appropriately positioned 
and resourced to implement the sales 
model developed in the UK, which is 
focused on increased and wider adoption 
of the LiDCOrapid monitors, to drive 
disposables consumption. 
Continental Europe 
The Company also has an active sales and 
marketing program in Europe. Sales were 
down 27% in this territory to £622,000 
(2011/12: £853,000). This was anticipated  
as European states, especially those in 
southern Europe, have cut back healthcare 
expenditure at the governmental level.  
In detail, this was reﬂected as lower monitor 
unit sales (19 vs. 60 in 2011/12) coupled  
to a lower average transfer price for 
disposables. Despite the ﬁnancial pressures, 
total unit disposable sales were down only 
slightly to 9,350 (2011/12: 9,445) due to  
a fall-oﬀ in critical care sensor disposable 
sales. Encouragingly, surgery disposable 
units were up 14%. Although this was not  
a growing market last year, we do expect 
growth going forward starting this year. 
Our distributors have substantially 
destocked during the year and have shown 
strong interest in committing to upgrading 
to the new LiDCOrapidv2 monitor. 
Japan and Rest of World
The LiDCOrapid monitor and associated 
disposable products were launched in 
Japan in August 2012 after obtaining 
registration and reimbursement. Japan  
is the second biggest market after the  
US for minimally-invasive hemodynamic 
monitoring and has the highest disposable 
pricing with a reimbursement of $420 per 
patient monitored. After Edward’s Vigileo/
FloTrac, LiDCOrapid is the second product 
to be granted reimbursement. LiDCO’s 
commercial partners in Japan are Argon 
and Nihon Kohden. Nihon Kohden has  
120 branch oﬃces and around 1,000 sales 
representatives and is a potent sales 
organization in Japan. Nihon Kohden  
UK market dynamics
The NHS drive for adoption of ﬂuid 
monitoring looks set to continue to 
underpin growth in our surgery monitoring 
business. In the UK around 40,000 patients 
a year currently undergo surgery with the 
guidance of hemodynamic and ﬂuid 
monitoring technologies. Under its latest 
initiatives, the NHS is seeking to increase 
this ﬁgure to 80,000 patients per year 
starting in April 2013, with the eventual aim 
of managing up to 800,000 patients a year. 
The Company expects to see signiﬁcant 
growth in the UK in 2013 for the 
LiDCOrapid and the LiDCOrapidv2 product 
range, with our intensive care LiDCOplus 
business showing more modest increases. 
US markets
In the US LiDCO has now acquired the 
existing LiDCOrapid customer base from 
Covidien and has taken back direct 
responsibility for the sales and marketing  
of all LiDCOrapid products. Product sales of 
£1.10 million were down from £1.49 million 
in 2011/12; this was predominantly as a 
consequence of the previously announced 
change in distribution arrangements  
to direct sales. LiDCOrapid sales were 
disrupted for several months in the latter 
part of the year. Revenue comparisons 
between the periods are further 
complicated by greater stocking orders 
taken into inventory by the distributor  
in the prior year. However, the underlying 
sales into hospitals across the period shows 
a better and clearer picture. Disposable unit 
sales of Smartcards increased by 8% to 
6,095 (2011/12: 5,630). Prior to the change 
to direct sales the monthly run rate was 
growing and standing at 550 per month 
compared to 480 per month in the same 
period in 2011. 
US market dynamics
The installed base of LiDCOrapid monitors 
in the US now stands at 230 units in 70 
hospitals. This is a substantial installed base 
and one that is equivalent to our installed 
base in the UK into which we sold 14,855 
disposables last year. The disposables sold 
in the US as noted above were 6,095.
Having assessed the US LiDCOrapid 
business, we believe there is an immediate 
opportunity to grow use rates and 
revenues in the existing installed base  11

monitoring) for Covidien and has rights to 
sell the combined monitor (LiDCOrapidv2 
with Unity software) when registered. 
Eighty LiDCOrapid monitors and 2,000 
disposables were sold during the period. 
This year will mark our ﬁrst full year of 
trading and we expect good commercial 
progress will be made. We hope to be 
submitting the LiDCOrapidv2 with Unity 
software and BIS™ option for Japanese 
registration later this year. Approval is 
anticipated in the second half of 2014. 
During the year a patent was granted in 
Japan for the LiDCOrapid monitor graphical 
user interface. This is important as the 
structure of the monitor screen is novel  
and is used in our multi parameter 
LiDCOrapidv2 monitor. Product sales  
to Japan in the year were £330,000 
(2011/12: £44,000). 
Product sales to the ROW territories

were strong with 99 units sold (2011/12:  
50 units) and monitor revenue up 12% 
£265,000 (2011/12: £236,000) – reﬂecting 
higher sales of the lower priced LiDCOrapid 
monitors (97 compared with 35 in the prior 
year). Sensor/Smartcard sales revenue was 
up by 4% to £299,000 (2011/12: £287,000). 
No license fees were paid during the 
period. Moving forward we are building 
sales capability through distribution 
partnerships in the Middle East and we 
recently signed a distributor for China.  12

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Operating results 
Overall turnover increased by 1% to £7.21m (2011/12: £7.12m) with  
an excellent performance in the UK more than mitigating the £390,000 
reduction in US product sales caused by the change in sales and marketing 
arrangements in that region. Details of sales performance by region are 
provided above. The Group made a loss after tax of £117,000 (2011/12:  
proﬁt £15,000) but remained comfortably EBITDA positive at £595,000 
(2011/12: £609,000) The loss per share was 0.07 pence (2011/12: earnings 
0.01 pence). Cash at the year-end was £2.06m. 
high. The margin across all LiDCO products 
(i.e. excluding third party product sales) 
increased during the period from 80% to 
82%. Future proﬁtability will signiﬁcantly 
depend on margins achieved on 
disposables and these have remained  
high during the year. Margins achieved  
on LiDCOplus sensors remained steady at 
86% and LiDCOrapid Smartcards increased 
slightly to 95% (2011/12: 94%).
The overall gross proﬁt increased by 
£74,000 to £4.82 million. The loss of margin 
resulting from the lack of license fees and 
the reduction in LiDCO based product 
sales, was oﬀset by the margin from 
additional third party product sales and 
negligible Med One cost of sales compared 
with £227,000 in the comparative period. 
The overall gross margin remained static  
at 67%. 
Total overheads increased by £242,000  
(5%) to £5.04m (2011/12: £4.80m). Sales 
and marketing costs increased by £198,000 
including the costs of re-engaging direct 
sales representation for the LiDCOrapid  
in the US. During the year there was a  
write back of £123,000 of share-based 
payment charges as a result of the lapse  
of share warrants granted to the former  
US distributor.
The operating loss increased by £168,000  
to £217,000. As a result of a three year sale 
and leaseback arrangement taken out in 
January 2012, the Group incurred net 
interest costs of £42,000 (2011/12: income 
£4,000). After net tax credits of £142,000 
(2011/12: £60,000) the Group made  
a small loss after tax of £117,000 (2011/12: 
proﬁt £15,000). 
Taxation
The Group continues to beneﬁt from 
research and development tax credits 
which may be recovered in cash while the 
Group makes an operating loss. The Group 
has a deferred tax asset of £4.8m although 
this has not been recognised in the 
accounts as it is not considered to meet  
the criteria laid down in IAS 12.
Cash, ﬁnancing and working capital
The net cash outﬂow before ﬁnancing 
activities in the period was £1.56 million 
(2011/12: £582,000) compared with  
a loss after tax of £117,000. As noted  
in the annual report to 31 January 2012, 
expenditure on intangible assets increased 
signiﬁcantly as a result of the continuous 
non-invasive blood pressure module and 
Unity software development. External 
expenditure including technology  
licenses for this development in the  
year was £564,000. The product was 
launched in February 2013 and residual 
development and licensing costs in the 
year to January 2014 are expected to be 
circa £200,000.
Revenues from the sales of LiDCO 
disposables increased by 6% to £3.88m 
(2011/12: £3.65m) with a notable increase 
of 79% in revenue from UK surgery 
disposables and excluding license fees, 
overall revenues increased by 10%. License 
fees are normally received in respect of 
signiﬁcant corporate distribution  
or licensing arrangements and are  
irregular. No such fees were received  
in the year (2011/12: £540,000).
During the year a total of 276 monitors 
(2011/12: 364 monitors) were sold or 
placed including 91 (2011/12: 66) sold or 
placed in the UK. The 7 year rolling base  
of sold/placed monitors at the year-end 
was 2,312 (2011/12: 2,189). Some of  
the monitors sold to distributors are for 
demonstration use and evaluation purposes. 
Unit sales of LiDCOrapid Smartcards rose  
by 1% overall with a 70% increase in the  
UK oﬀset by a 57% drop in US sales. In the  
UK total disposable unit sales of sensors  
and Smartcards increased by 29%. In the  
UK where the Group has detailed usage 
information, the average use rates for 
surgery disposables increased to 5.1 
(2011/12: 4.7) uses per monitor per month 
with individual hospital use as high as  
19 Smartcards per monitor per month.
Gross proﬁt margins (which are calculated 
before any allocation of overheads) remain  13

Growth in revenue  
from UK surgery disposables
As also noted in the results to 31 January 
2012, larger than normal forward orders  
of monitors had to be placed in order to 
mitigate against the eﬀect of end of life 
notices issued by the manufacturers on 
some monitor components. The Group’s 
software is written speciﬁcally to work with 
the existing hardware platform, allowing 
back integration into the installed base.  
It was therefore considered necessary to 
ensure that the Group had an unchanged 
hardware platform for the next few years. 
As a result of these forward orders and  
the buy-back of the customer base and 
inventory from its former US distributor, 
inventories increased in the year by 
£922,000. Remaining outstanding forward 
orders for monitors amount to £220,000 
and will be received in the year to January 
2014. Inventory levels should thus fall in the 
current ﬁnancial year. 
In November 2012 the Group issued 
17,423,000 new ordinary shares at  
13.5 pence per share in a placing and 
subscription to both new and existing 
investors, including management raising 
£2.21 million net of costs. Some of the 
proceeds have been used to buy back 
inventory and the installed base of 
monitors from the former US distributor. 
The additional funds will also allow the 
Group to accelerate the retro-ﬁt of its UK 
installed base of LiDCOrapid monitors with 
the new product, to strengthen the Group’s 
balance sheet and position the Group so  
as to be able to better pursue other growth 
opportunities as and when they arise.  
In addition, a further 1,997,000 shares were 
issued in respect of share options exercised 
during the year for a total of £225,000.
Net cash balances at 31 January 2013 
amounted to £2.06 million (2011/12:  
£1.34 million).
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
We are very excited about the distributor 
and customer reception for our  
recently developed and launched  
new LiDCOrapidv2 with Unity software.  
This is the ﬁrst monitor in the world to be 
designed speciﬁcally for multi parameter 
monitoring of both depth of anesthesia 
and ﬂuids for patients undergoing high  
risk surgery. This development allows  
the connection of two modules to the 
LiDCOrapidv2 allowing the co-display  
of Covidiens’ depth of anesthesia parameter 
(BIS™) and CNSystems’ continuous 
non-invasive blood pressure monitoring 
(CNAP™). We have registered this product 
for sale in Europe and have FDA approval 
for sale of the new Unity software and 
depth of anesthesia module option. We 
expect the non-invasive blood pressure 
option (LiDCO CNAP™ module) to also be 
available for sale in the US market around 
the summer of 2013. 
New development activities for 2013 
include the language localization of the 
new Unity software and clinical evaluation 
of additional parameters for integration 
into the LiDCOrapidv2 monitor. The new 
Unity software has been structured in such 
a way that more measurements can be 
added quickly and cost eﬀectively. We are 
particularly interested in parameters whose 
addition will give enhanced utility not only 
in the high risk surgery market but also  
in the cardiac surgery arena and shock/
sepsis patients. We will keep investors 
appraised on progress and expect to be 
able to announce more details of further 
parameter integration later this year. 
Looking to other development projects 
these will include an update to the 
LiDCOplus software that will bring the 
operating system up to date and will 
improve ease of use and connection  
to third party monitors. LiDCOview, our 
easy-to-use graphical display of historical 
LiDCOplus and LiDCOrapid hemodynamic 
data, is a unique research tool that is used 
for the review of historical data for research 
and education purposes. This will also  
be updated with the addition of BIS™  
(depth of anesthesia) to the download, 
analysis and display. Both projects will  
be completed and released in the next  
few months. 
Outlook
We expect signiﬁcant sales growth in 2013, 
driven by higher direct sales revenues in 
both the US and the UK, a full year of sales 
in Japan and a return of sales growth  
in the EU. Our new widely applicable 
LiDCOrapidv2 monitor with non-invasive 
and level of consciousness options will 
contribute signiﬁcantly to our revenues. 
Costs and margins will be kept under 
control. The Board anticipates further 
growth in 2013 and expects to be both 
cash generative and proﬁtable.

 Chief executive officer’s review
Introduction
The FDA clearance and launch of our second generation instrument platform, the eSensor XT-8, in 2008
marked a significant step towards our aim of commercialising our proprietary electrochemical detection
technology to provide a low cost, easy to use technology for molecular diagnostics testing.
At the same time as the FDA clearance for the eSensor XT-8, we also received clearance for our eSensor
Warfarin Sensitivity Test which represents a significant market opportunity for Osmetech.
Warfarin market opportunity
Warfarin decreases the blood’s clotting ability and is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant in
North America and Europe. Individuals metabolize Warfarin differently, and if its administration is not
managed carefully, life threatening side effects may occur. In the U.S. alone there are an estimated
2 million new Warfarin patients each year and it is the second most likely drug, after insulin, to send
Americans to the Emergency Room, resulting in an estimated 43,000 visits a year and many
hospitalizations.
Current clinical practice involves a ‘trial and error’ process for the physician to determine the appropriate
dosing level for the drug on a patient-by-patient basis. There is now rapidly growing awareness of the
influence of genetic factors in establishing correct dosing levels, supported by scientific and medical
research. Furthermore there is now an increasing weight of compelling economic data to support such
testing, demonstrating that not only can patient care be improved but testing can save costs.
We believe that the market is now at a tipping point where Warfarin sensitivity testing will become a
standard of care, resulting in widespread genetic testing for the substantial number of new Warfarin
patients.
In August 2007, the FDA updated the label for Warfarin to note that people with variations of the genes
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 may respond differently to the drug. This has now been followed up by the
American Medical Association (AMA) sending literature to U.S. physicians promoting the use of genetic
testing as best practice when establishing Warfarin dosing for patients. The Joint Commission, strong
influencers and monitors of hospital laboratory practice, have identified anticoagulation therapy,
including Warfarin dosing, under their main guidelines for improving patient safety in 2008 and 2009.
In January 2009, results of the largest prospective study yet performed supported the use of genetic
testing for Warfarin patients. The study conducted by the Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical
Pharmacology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, commenced in 2001 and monitored 1,496
new Warfarin patients, assessing the impact of the three main genetic markers that are known to play a
critical role in metabolism of, and sensitivity to, Warfarin. It concluded: “We have shown that in a large
prospective study, VKORC1 and CYP2C9 predict Warfarin dose and individuals predisposed to unstable
anticoagulation during initiation of therapy. We anticipate that adequately sized clinical trials of patients
randomized to pharmacogenetic versus conventional dosing will demonstrate that Warfarin dose
prediction improves the safety and cost effectiveness of oral anticoagulant treatment.”
In February 2009, a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine by The International
Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium described how clinical and genetic data from 4,043 patients
were used to create a dosing algorithm that was based on clinical variables only and an algorithm in
which genetic information was added to the clinical variables. The algorithms were validated on a group
of 1,009 patients and the study, which is by far the largest and most inclusive of its kind to date,
concluded that the use of a pharmacogenetic algorithm for estimating the appropriate initial dose of
Warfarin produces recommendations that are significantly closer to the required stable therapeutic dose
than those derived from a clinical algorithm or a fixed-dose approach. In an accompanying editorial, two
Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2008 3 Chief executive officer’s review
continued
senior FDA representatives supported the findings, noting that a high proportion of the population
(46%) were outliers and required higher or lower doses than the ‘average’ patient.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is now in the process of launching the largest
prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial in the United States to test whether a gene-based
strategy for prescribing the initial Warfarin dose will improve patient outcomes. The clinical trial will use
a dosing strategy similar to that developed in the international study and will enroll 1,200 participants of
diverse backgrounds and ethnicities at twelve clinical sites.
In addition to the improved standard of care for patients, there are a number of key organizations who
are also driving this change from an economic perspective, excited by the costs that can be saved in
healthcare budgets. The organizations include Medco, a leading U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM),
with the nation’s largest mail order pharmacy operations and 60,000 retail pharmacies.
Warfarin – Osmetech’s unique position
Osmetech’s FDA-cleared Warfarin Sensitivity Test provides genetic information relating to the three
principal biomarkers for the metabolism of the drug. In addition, our Extended Warfarin Sensitivity Test
incorporates additional markers, including the exclusively-licensed CYP450-4F2 biomarker, unique to
Osmetech. The results of recent independent clinical studies support the significance of CYP4F2. A 2008
publication in Blood (Journal of the American Society of Hematology) concluded that the CYP4F2
marker significantly improves genetic data for Warfarin dosing. Other studies including recent 2009
publications from researchers in Spain and another group from Italy have confirmed and strengthened
the importance of the 4F2 variant. They concluded that CYP4F2 increases the reliability of the Warfarin
pharmacogenetic test. When CYP4F2 is included with CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic variants, age and
weight an additional 7% of the interpatient variability in Warfarin dose response is explained. Further
independent studies are in progress.
Additionally, the significance of our unique CYP4F2 biomarker has been recognized by
WarfarinDosing.org. This is a free Web site dedicated to helping doctors and clinicians estimate the
most appropriate therapeutic dose for patients already prescribed Warfarin initiating Warfarin therapy by
integrating genetic, phenotypic and therapeutic information. The adddtion of CYP4F2 to the
WarfarinDosing.org dosing algorithm uniquely positions this algorithm as the leading comprehensive
clinical utility tool.
We believe that the combination of ‘best platform’ and ‘best test’ should position Osmetech as a leader
in this market, which we believe is poised for significant growth.
Molecular Diagnostics Market
According to Frost & Sullivan, a market research firm, the 2007 worldwide in-vitro diagnostics, or IVD,
market was estimated to be $35 billion, and is anticipated to reach $43 billion by 2010. Its fastest
growing segment, the molecular diagnostics market, was $2.5 billion in 2007 and is anticipated to reach
$3.7 billion in 2010. This new and expanding part of the IVD market emerged in response to a need for
more rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostic tests than were available using only traditional techniques,
such as growth-based tests, biochemical tests or immunoassays.
We believe several factors contribute to the growth of this market, including:
• Decentralization of genetic testing;
• Conversion from “home-brew” tests to FDA-cleared molecular testing methods;
• Expansion of genetic testing for disease predisposition;

continued
• Advances in pharmacogenomics and personalised medicine; and
• Growth of the infectious disease diagnostic market.
Osmetech’s Solution
Traditionally, the market for molecular diagnostics testing has been dominated by testing methods that
rely on optical or fluorescence technologies and complex research based instruments adapted to meet
the very different demands of the clinical environment. These technologies are expensive to operate and
require specialised facilities and highly-trained personnel. In addition, the devices that utilise these
technologies are sensitive to dust, debris and movement and require specialised care and maintenance.
By contrast our eSensor platform is a simple, ‘clinical lab ready’ system designed specifically for the
molecular diagnostics market and fits perfectly into routine workflows. The platform is based on
electrochemical technology that uses chemical reactions to detect the presence of molecules, which in
turn produce characteristic electrical currents. This technology, which is unique in the molecular
diagnostics field, has been proven in other clinical applications (such as blood glucose home testing for
diabetics) to deliver accurate and reproducible results in small, robust and affordable formats. Osmetech
has strong intellectual property supporting the use of this technology for the detection of DNA, RNA
and proteins.
Our unique eSensor platform permits multiplexing, or simultaneously running multiple tests on
individual samples, and random access testing, or the ability to initiate tests while other tests are in
progress. It is a compact bench-top workstation with an integrated touch screen computer and
disposable test cartridges that can process up to 3,000 tests a week. It provides a definitive result within
30 minutes with limited operator involvement and requires little or no maintenance.
Our business model
We are principally targeting those reference laboratories and hospitals that already possess molecular
testing skills but currently do not have a solution for our particular tests. Our target customers will
typically be sending their testing out to larger institutions but would prefer to retain testing in-house in
order to provide faster results for the patient and to improve the profitability of their laboratories.
Osmetech is one of a small number of companies with the capability of meeting the needs of this
decentralizing and growing market.
Our business model is currently to provide customers with an instrument under a reagent rental
agreement earning Osmetech revenues from the sale of tests. The customer incurs no upfront capital
expenditure and has minimal labour costs and dedicates only a small amount of laboratory space for
running the test. With attractive reimbursement levels in place, molecular diagnostic testing instantly
becomes profitable for our customers.
The combination of growing the installed base of instruments and broadening our test menu by
launching new assays has a multiplier effect which should allow Osmetech to build a fast growing, high
quality revenue stream.
Commercial progress
At the end of December 2008 we had grown our installed base of instruments with customers to 34,
comprising 13 evaluation and 21 contract units. We have increased this total to 49 during the first three
months of 2009 and have seen a continuation of the excellent conversion rate from evaluation to
contract. We have yet to lose an evaluation to a competitor and the XT-8 has been rated ahead of
competitor products by two recent independent studies. This success has been driven by an excellent
user experience, with a reported 100% system performance, which compares very favourably to
competing products that often report high ‘no-call’ rates requiring the re-processing of a sample.

Distribution partner
We have a relatively small in-house sales force and in order to capitalize on the significant market
interest for our products and the growing number of customer leads, we have entered into a five-year
U.S. distribution agreement with Fisher Healthcare, a division of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Fisher).
Fisher has a significant presence in the U.S. diagnostics market with 6 molecular sales specialists and
over 150 generalist healthcare sales representatives.
Test menu and pipeline
We intend to develop and market a broad range of DNA tests in the fields of genetic testing,
pharmacogenomics, infectious diseases and cancer. Having the ‘best platform’ has enabled us to secure
exclusive rights to the important new genetic marker for Warfarin, the CYP450 4F2 biomarker and to
enter into an agreement with QIAGEN to adapt their QIAplex-based respiratory viral test, which is
already a commercially successful product, for use on our eSensor XT-8 System.
The current menu of tests commercially available for use on our eSensor XT-8 System comprises:
• Warfarin Sensitivity Test for the three most relevant CYP2C9/ VKOR biomarkers associated with
Warfarin metabolism. FDA 510(k) clearance obtained in July 2007.
• 2C9 Drug Metabolism Test for CYP2C9 biomarkers associated with metabolism of phenytoin and most
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Launched as a research use only product in November 2008.
• Cystic Fibrosis Test for pre-conception screening of cystic fibrosis gene carriers for use with the
eSensor XT-8 System. Launched as a research use only product and an application for 510(k)
clearance submitted to the FDA in March 2009.
We are currently developing additional tests to expand our test menu for the eSensor XT-8 System, in
each case focussing on validated content where external research has already identified the relevant
biomarkers. These tests include the following:
• Extended Warfarin Sensitivity Test based on the eSensor Warfarin Sensitivity Test, this test
incorporates a number of additional markers, including the exclusively-licensed CYP450-4F2
biomarker. An application for FDA 510(k) clearance was filed in December 2008.
• Respiratory Pathogen Test Panel to detect major respiratory viruses and aid in the identification of
bacterial and viral infections. This test will adapt QIAGEN’s QIAplex-based respiratory viral test for
use on the eSensor XT-8 System and is currently in development. We expect to launch as a research
use only product in 2009 and will also consider an application for FDA 510(k) clearance.
• Factor II, Factor V and MTHFR Test venous thrombosis test for the most common mutations
associated with increased risk of blood clots, which can lead to stroke and pulmonary embolism. This
test is currently in development and we expect to launch as a research use only product in 2009 and
will also consider an application for FDA 510(k) clearance.
• 2D6 Drug Metabolism Test for CYP2D6 biomarkers associated with metabolism of a variety of
prescription drugs including antipsychotics, anti-depressants and anti-thrombolytics. This test is
currently in development and we expect to submit an application for FDA 510(k) clearance if and
when development is completed.
• Tamoxifen Sensitivity Test for metabolism of the breast cancer drug Tamoxifen. This test is currently
in development and we expect to submit an application for FDA 510(k) clearance if and when
development is completed.

continued
• 2C19 Plavix Test for metabolism of the anti-platelet drug Plavix (Clopidogrel). This test is currently in
development and we expect to submit an application for FDA 510(k) clearance if and when
development is completed.
We anticipate adding further tests to our development pipeline during the course of the coming year,
particularly in the fields of personalised medicine and cancer, where the market opportunities are highly
attractive.
Fund raising
The global molecular diagnostics market and the knowledge and understanding of healthcare
technology companies are heavily centred on the US. A significant number of emerging healthcare
technology companies trade on NASDAQ. In September 2008 we announced proposals to undertake an
issue of American Depositary Shares (ADS) and obtain a listing of such shares on the NASDAQ Global
Market. With market conditions proving very difficult and deteriorating further, we concluded that there
was insufficient interest to proceed with the ADS Issue and the NASDAQ Listing at that time. Given the
Company’s further funding requirements, in December 2008 we raised £6,662,609, net of expenses,
through the placing of new shares to institutional shareholders, which should provide sufficient funds to
support the business until July 2009. We are currently evaluating options to provide further funding for
the Group.
Financial review
Loss
The loss from continuing operations increased by 28% from £12,030,624 in 2007 to £15,451,979 in 2008
and the net loss per share from continuing operations increased by 17% from 5.93 pence in 2007 to
6.93 pence in 2008. The operating loss for the period increased 20%, primarily resulting from £1,195,536
costs incurred in connection with the withdrawal of a proposed issue and ADS listing on NASDAQ in the
U.S. and currency exchange rate differences between the two periods amounting to 8%.
Revenue
Revenue increased from £169,273 in 2007 to £352,069 in 2008. The increase of £182,796, or 108%, was
principally a result of the growth in sales of our eSensor Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Detection Test, although
currency exchange rate differences accounted for 19% of the increase. Product sales were £116,288 and
£305,163 (an increase of 162%) and license revenues were £52,985 and £46,906 (a decrease of 11%) in
2007 and 2008, respectively.
Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress
Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress increased from £92,818 in 2007 to
£312,106 in 2008. The increase of £219,288, or 236%, was principally as a result of manufacturing
additional eSensor Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Detection Tests in 2008, following the growth in our installed
base of eSensor 4800 instruments. Gross profit for product sales (defined as product sales less changes
in inventories of finished goods and work in progress and royalties on product sales) decreased from a
profit of £23,470 in 2007 to a loss of £6,943 in 2008 representing 20% and (2)% of product sales in 2007
and 2008, respectively.
We expect the gross profit on product sales to improve significantly in 2009 as we increase our sales of
eSensor XT-8 test cartridges. These have a much lower cost of goods than our first generation test
cartridges for the eSensor 4800 System. Furthermore, we have identified further cost reductions and
manufacturing efficiencies for XT-8 cartridges which we expect to progressively achieve in the coming
year.

Employee benefits
Employee benefits costs increased from £6,413,616 in 2007 to £6,882,569 in 2008. The increase of
£468,953, or 7%, includes a reduction in the level of share compensation charges from £450,317 for 2007
to a credit of £314,881 for 2008 primarily due to a revision of expectations for achieving performance
targets for management long-term incentive plans. The base level of payroll costs was higher in 2008
reflecting the higher average number of employees in the year for continuing operations, which
increased by 17% from 94 in 2007 to 110 in 2008, although this cost increase was partially offset by a
substantial reduction in bonus payments. In December 2008 we undertook a rationalisation program and
have reduced staffing levels to approximately 60 employees which will significantly reduce employee
benefits costs in 2009. The cost of this program in respect of one-off employee benefits costs in 2008
was £421,785.
Research and development costs
Research and development costs increased from £2,595,179 in 2007 to £2,667,855 in 2008, an increase of
£72,676, or 3%. Excluding currency exchange rate differences between the two periods amounting to
approximately 8%, costs decreased by 5% in 2008 reflecting lower systems development costs, as the
development of the eSensor XT-8 System was completed during the year. This reduction was partially
offset by an increase in costs related to the development of new tests during the period.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense increased from £589,611 in 2007 to £714,637 in 2008. The
increase of £125,026, or 21%, resulted from both an increase in the amortization of license costs and
increased depreciation in respect of plant, machinery and laboratory instruments.
Other expenses
In total, other expenses increased from £3,526,449 in 2007 to £5,383,198 in 2008. This increase of
£1,856,749, or 53%, principally reflects £1,195,536 (2007 – £NIL) costs incurred in connection with the
withdrawal of a proposed ADS issue and listing on the NASDAQ Global Market in the U.S.
Interest on bank balances and term deposits
Interest on bank balances and term deposits decreased from £864,143 in 2007 to £213,259 in 2008. The
decrease of £650,884, or 75%, resulted primarily from a reduction in average cash balances during the
year, due to the ongoing operating expenses of the business.
Taxation
There have been no UK activities during 2008 that would qualify for research and development tax
credits as compared to 2007 during which we qualified for net tax credits of £153,633. The tax charge in
2008 of £122,572 primarily reflects a reduction in the estimated credits available in respect of 2007.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents decreased from £13,910,710 at 31 December 2007 to £6,034,926 at
31 December 2008, a decrease of £7,875,784, or 57%. The decrease of cash and cash equivalents was
principally due to the use of £14,305,945 in operating activities, offset by the net proceeds from the issue
of shares in 2008 amounting to £6,662,609. Cash and cash equivalents at 28 February 2009 were
£3,842,861.
Net cash used in operating activities increased from £14,121,176 in 2007 to £14,305,945 in 2008, an
increase of £184,769, or 1%, and a decrease of approximately 7% excluding the impact of currency
exchange rate differences between the two periods. The movement was primarily due to two factors: an
increase in operating cash outflows before movements in working capital of £2,739,237 mainly resulting
from an increase in the loss from continuing operations, offset by a reduction in net working capital of
8 Osmetech Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Chief executive officer’s review
continued
£615,836 in 2008 compared to an increase of £1,542,334 in 2007. The decrease in net working capital in
2008 is principally due to an increase in creditors in 2008 reflecting the agreed payment deferral of
certain professional costs associated with the cancellation of the proposed ADS issue and listing of such
shares on NASDAQ in 2008.
Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations increased from £156,830 for 2007 to
£760,989 in 2008, representing an increase of £604,159. The increase is primarily explained by the
reduction of interest received on bank balances and term deposits.
Net cash generated from/(used in) financing activities increased from (£559,228) in 2007 to £6,662,609 in
2008, an increase of £7,221,837. The increase primarily reflects the net proceeds from the issue of shares
in 2008 amounting to £6,662,609 and the payment of £480,845 made to redeem share warrants in 2007.
Outlook
The past year has been one of significant development for the Company with the successful launch of
our second generation instrument platform, the eSensor XT-8, together with our Warfarin Sensitivity Test,
following FDA clearance. However with difficult conditions in the financial markets we have rationalised
the business and reduced our workforce. We have accomplished this without negatively effecting
operational activity and cost savings have been realised. The excellent operational performance of the
eSensor XT-8 in the field is a testament to the skill and dedication of our employees, past and present,
who have worked tirelessly to bring the product to market and help create the basis of the strong
business we have today. However, financial markets remain challenging and consequently we continue to
examine all strategic options for Osmetech to ensure that we have adequate funds for our future
requirements.
We will continue to execute on our strategy of commercialising our pipeline of tests and increasing our
installed base of instruments in the field. We are focussing on tests with validated biomarkers where
there is an established market need. The attraction of our instrument platform is illustrated by the
agreement with industry leader, Qiagen, to adapt their existing and widely used respiratory test for use
on our eSensor XT-8.
We already have a growing number of strong customer leads and expect to accelerate our commercial
expansion further through the distribution agreement recently signed with Fisher Healthcare in the U.S.
We will benefit from Fisher’s considerable sales and marketing strength and established relationship with
key customer accounts. This agreement further validates our products and technology.
The roll out of the eSensor XT-8 system has been successful and continues to gather pace. We are
establishing the eSensor XT-8 as strong product platform with an expanding test menu in a fast growing
market, which allows our customers to improve both patient care and the profitability of their
laboratories.

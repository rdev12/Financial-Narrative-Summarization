 We are well positioned for the future 
Chief Executive’s Review
2014 summary
In 2014 we saw the positive benefit of the improved 
environment in all of our regional markets and we were 
pleased to see greater balance across the regional 
markets coming into effect in the second half of 2014 
with slower and more sustainable price growth, after  
a very strong first half.
Customer demand remained high across all regions  
and was helped by a more affordable and accessible 
mortgage market, due both to Help to Buy and a more 
competitive lending environment. 
Against this backdrop, and in line with our strategy,  
we have continued to grow steadily and sustainably, 
delivering increased completions and creating additional 
value, increasing operating profit by 53.6% to £480.7 
million (2013: £312.9 million).
2014 was an important year for the Group as we met  
or exceeded all previous financial targets and committed 
to delivering more by setting new stretching targets for 
the medium term, which I will detail later. We are pleased 
that in 2014 we have made significant progress towards 
all of these medium term targets. More information on  
our financial performance can be found in the Group 
Financial Review section on pages 40 to 43. Alongside  
this, there were many operational highlights including 
achieving a record contribution per completion of £49.6k 
(2013: £38.8k), significantly increasing our intake of 
trainee and apprentice programmes and contributing 
£300 million to local communities across the UK via 
planning obligations, providing infrastructure, affordable 
homes, public transport and education. 
Health and safety is our non-negotiable top priority and 
we were particularly pleased to see that this was reflected 
in our 2014 employee survey which found that 99%  
of our staff believe that Taylor Wimpey is committed  
to health and safety and keeping people safe. We have 
continued to keep our UK Annual Injury Incidence Rate 
(AIIR) low at 209 per 100,000 employees and contractors 
in 2014 (2013: 207). We reduced our AIIR for major 
injuries from 60 in 2013 to 26 in 2014.
Proactively managing the cycle 
Our views about managing the cycle have not changed. 
Housebuilding is a cyclical industry and, whilst sensible 
measures from Government, interest rate setters and 
regulators can help to reduce the scale of that cyclicality, 
we do not believe it can be removed completely. 
Therefore, whilst we remain focused on delivering strong 
returns and growth, we are also mindful of mid and long 
term risk. This means that we need to take a more active 
approach to managing the cycle than has been historically 
undertaken in the business, or the sector. We are

currently operating in a housing market underpinned  
by a significant structural demand and supply imbalance. 
Housing remains high on the political agenda with 
recognition of the importance of housebuilding to the 
economy and the need for more quality homes in the  
UK by all of the main political parties. Whilst there remains 
uncertainty around the outcome of the General Election in 
May, consumer confidence remains solid and is supported 
by healthy underlying demand, low interest rates and high 
levels of employment. We therefore consider that the UK 
near term market risk is low. 
We believe that we are currently operating at the early 
stages of the housing cycle. The charts on pages  
14 to 15 show some of the key external measures  
we follow closely and these will change depending  
on the stage of the cycle. However, the housing cycle  
is influenced by many factors and these should not 
be viewed in isolation.
Our strategy 
Taylor Wimpey’s vision is to become the UK’s leading 
residential developer for creating value and delivering 
quality across the housing cycle. Since we set out our 
strategy in 2011, we have seen the transformation of 
Taylor Wimpey to a value driven business, with a long 
term focus on generating the best quality sustainable 
returns. We are confident that we can achieve this as  
a result of three key differentiating factors:
1.  We have invested in new land in a disciplined way,  
at the right time and in the right locations. This has 
been supported by record conversions in the last few 
years from our strategic pipeline, adding to the scale, 
quality and future profitability of the landbank.
2.  We have a clear view on the right size of our 
business and our focus is on delivering sustainable 
growth and value generation in a balanced, 
consistent way through the housing cycle.
3.  We believe that the underlying quality of the  
business is very important and is worth investing  
in. This includes our non-negotiable approach to 
health and safety and our focus on people and 
customer service.
Following a period of strong investment, we are  
now at our optimum size of landbank at c.75k plots, 
equating to c.six years of supply at current completion 
levels. We have therefore moved to a land replacement 
position in the short term land market and, together 
with the increasing profitability of the business, are 
becoming increasingly cash generative. This has 
enabled us to move to a phase focused on delivery, 
maximising the returns from our investments, and

continuing to ensure that the business is optimally 
positioned to deliver those returns on a sustainable 
basis. In May 2014 we announced a set of stretching 
financial targets for the period 2015 to 2017, to 
challenge the business to deliver even more over  
the medium term.
These targets, each of which is applicable for the 
period 2015 to 2017, are to achieve: 
 − An average operating profit* margin of 20% over  
the three year period 
 − A return on net operating assets** of at least  
20% per annum 
 − An average increase in net assets (including returns 
to shareholders) of 15% per annum over the three 
year period 
 − An average conversion of at least 65% of operating 
profit* into operating cash flow
†††
 over the three 
year period
Whilst we clearly do not expect to deliver all of these 
three year targets in 2015, we do expect to show 
significant progress towards all of them. 
More information on these targets and how they fit into 
our long term strategy through the cycle can be found  
on pages 16 to 17.
Our strategy is underpinned by our strategic principles 
set out on page 18. 
We want to earn returns, but how we do this is equally 
important to us. Our cultural principles underpin 
everything we do. These are set out on page 19.
Our business model is based on a value cycle, and  
each component of the value cycle is important in order 
to achieve our strategic objectives. Each element of  
our business model is detailed in full on pages 18 to 25.  
We believe that sustainability is fundamental to each 
aspect of the value cycle and, therefore, to the long  
term success of the Company. Further information on 
sustainability can be found on pages 30 to 33 and within 
our dedicated Sustainability Report 2014. 
Dividend and cash return policy 
In 2014 we set out the principles and policy of returning 
surplus cash to shareholders at the appropriate times in 
the cycle, in addition to our regular maintenance dividend. 
Reflecting both our confidence in our performance and 
the underlying resilience of the market, we have 
announced the doubling of the maintenance dividend 
pay-out to 2% of net assets, which is at the top end  
of previous guidance, subject to shareholder approval. 
This will give a proposed 2014 final maintenance dividend 
of 1.32 pence per share to be paid on 20 May 2015 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 
10 April 2015 (2013 final dividend: 0.47 pence per share). 
In combination with the interim dividend of 0.24 pence 
per share (2013 interim dividend: 0.22 pence per share), 
this gives a total maintenance dividend for the year of 
1.56 pence per share (2013 total maintenance: 0.69 
pence per share).
On 3 July 2014 we commenced the return of surplus 
cash to shareholders with a £49.7 million special  
cash payment, equating to 1.54 pence per share.  
As we previously announced on 30 July 2014, we will 
return approximately £250 million to shareholders on  
3 July 2015, equating to 7.68 pence per ordinary share, 
to shareholders on the register at close of business on  
22 May 2015, subject to shareholder approval at the 
2015 AGM. Going forward, surplus cash returns will 
continue to form a significant proportion of our annual 
total return to shareholders. These cash returns will be 
set on an annual basis, in line with the cash generation  
of the business. They will be announced at our half year 
results and paid the following year. A key part of the 
rationale of our approach to running the business in  
a sustainable way is to give investors a significant, 
consistent and reliable dividend stream.

12 Our customers
In 2014 we achieved a customer satisfaction rate of 87% 
(2013: 90%), with the decrease reflecting the challenge  
to deliver our homes on time as the labour market 
adapted to the better sales market. Whilst this remains 
high in comparison to historic trends, we are very 
disappointed that this has decreased. During 2014 we 
began an in-depth review of every aspect and stage of 
our customer journey, to identify areas of improvement 
and to deliver a better homebuying experience for our 
customers. This is a very important area for us and will 
continue to be a key focus in 2015 and on an ongoing 
basis, as we work to realise improvements to our service 
and to our customers’ experience. More information can 
be found on pages 22 and 38.
Our people 
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Kevin’s 
words of thanks to the teams and the individuals across 
our business. I believe we have the best people in  
the industry and we want to make Taylor Wimpey  
the employer of choice and establish a culture 
where individuals from all backgrounds can reach 
their full potential. 
Whilst we have done a lot over the last few years in 
developing our people, we recognise there is still more  
to do. We will be focusing on the areas of learning and 
development and building on our success in our training 
programmes in 2015.
Our new Group Human Resources Director Anne Billson-
Ross is working with our GMT and the wider business to 
update the human resources strategy for T aylor Wimpey 
and drive further improvement in 2015. 
I am also extremely proud of the efforts of our employees 
around the country, supporting our chosen charities.  
In total during 2014 we raised over £539k (2013: £415k) 
for registered charities through donations and fundraising. 
More information on this can be found on page 31. Just 
one example of this was in March 2014 where nearly 200 
of our staff from across 80% of the regional businesses 
completed Taylor Wimpey’s inaugural teambuilding event 
in the Brecon Beacons with an aim to climb the Welsh 
National Park’s 10 highest mountains in 10 hours for the 
Youth Adventure Trust, a charity which provides 
adventure camps and day activities for disadvantaged 
children aged between 11 and 14, to enable them to 
experience success, learn to go beyond their own 
expectations and grow in confidence. Our 45 teams 
raised over £141k. This was the highest amount raised  
in a single event in the charity’s history. We are also 
looking forward to building on this with our next all-
employee challenge in May 2015. 
Diversity 
During 2014, we continued to focus on diversity and 
inclusion. We remain committed to the belief that 
embracing diversity and inclusion will enable Taylor 
Wimpey to succeed through a workforce that is creative 
and innovative. We continue to actively embrace the 
business and local communities in which we operate  
and will strive to reflect their richness and character by 
including such aspects as gender, race and religion but 
also diversity of thought, background and experience.  
In 2014 we undertook a range of activities including 
establishing a senior management working party to 
create a diversity and inclusion strategy. For further  
detail please see pages 57 to 59.
Outlook 
Looking forward, and as I mentioned previously, we  
are currently operating in a housing market underpinned  
by a significant structural demand and supply imbalance. 
Housing remains high on the political agenda with 
recognition of the importance of housebuilding to the 
economy and the need for more quality homes in the  
UK by all of the main political parties. Whilst there remains 
uncertainty around the outcome of the General Election  
in May, consumer confidence remains solid and is 
supported by healthy underlying demand, low interest 
rates and high levels of employment. We therefore 
consider that the UK near term market risk is low.
The beginning of the spring selling season has seen  
both demand and trading at the better end of our 
expectations. Net private sales rates for the year to date 
(w/e 1 March 2015) of 0.70 are at healthy levels (2014 
equivalent period: 0.72) and within the range we see as 
sustainable. With slower market growth, we anticipate 
reducing build cost pressure in 2015. 
As at 1 March 2015, we are 51% forward sold for private 
completions for 2015 with a strong total order book of 
£1,657 million (2014 equivalent period: £1,529 million).
This together with our strong landbank, with over 50%  
of plots sourced from the strategic pipeline, positions us 
well for 2015 and beyond. We remain confident that our 
long term strategy, enhanced by the stretching medium 
term targets we announced in May 2014, will enable us 
to maximise the best quality returns from our investments 
on a sustainable basis across the housing cycle.

Planning
The changes to the planning system in the last few years including the Localism Act and National Planning Policy Framework are having a 
positive impact on the planning system. We continue to monitor this, along with the recently introduced Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) 
and the time taken to achieve implementable planning permission to start on site.
Planning policy and regulation
Planning remains the fundamental constraint in the UK.  
In recent years there have been a number of changes  
to the planning system, with the implementation of the

Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and the National 
Planning Policy Guidance.

Mortgage availability and affordability 
We build a wide range of homes, from one-bedroom apartments to five-bedroom houses, with prices ranging from below £100,000 to  
over £3 million. The majority of the homes that we build are sold to individual purchasers who take on significant mortgages to finance  
their purchases. Mortgage availability and affordability therefore are key factors.
During 2014, we have continued to see an improvement 
in customer sentiment and an increase in sales rates  
as customers, already feeling more confident, were able 
to gain access to a healthier mortgage market, helped 
through Help to Buy and a more willing and competitive 
banking system.
In 2014, mortgage availability, including for higher loan  
to value mortgages, continued to improve with the total 
value of mortgage approvals for home purchases up 
10.5% at £124,894 million (2013: £112,985 million) 
according to the Bank of England data, with property 
transactions 13.6% higher at 1,219,710 (2013: 1,073,560).

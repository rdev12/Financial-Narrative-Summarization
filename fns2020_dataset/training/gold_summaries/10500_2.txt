Strong start to the current ﬁnancial year
1. The ﬁnancial highlights relate to the Pro Forma Income Statement covering the years ended 31 December 
2006 and 31 December 2007 assuming a debt free acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited by the Company on 1 January 2006, from which date intangible amortisation commenced, and a share 
option charge which reﬂects the average charge over the vesting period of currently unexercised options. 
 The Directors anticipate presenting ﬁnancial information on a similar basis until the ﬁnal results for the year 
ended 31 December 2008. Thereafter the need to present a Pro Forma Income Statement will not be 
required because the relevant comparator period will be consistent with the current period. Further 
information on the Pro Forma Income Statement is set out in the Business Review on page 10.
2. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by the Directors by making certain adjustments to the historical compensation 
levels of the Directors and senior managers, and share based bonus awards to employees on the listing of the 
Company. These adjustments reﬂect the Directors’ and senior managers’ proﬁt share, discretionary bonus and 
related employer’s national insurance contribution. They also include charges relating to the issue of free 
shares to each eligible employee to the value of £3,000, charges relating to the conditional share award made 
to Gerald Corbett on listing and charges related to share based compensation relating to options issued prior 
to listing. Following listing, these elements of compensation no longer apply at these levels. For further 
information, see page 10.

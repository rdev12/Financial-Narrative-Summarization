Since coming on board as Chief 
Executive Officer in October 
2008, I have seen oil production 
from the Khurbet East field 
exceed our expectations by 
averaging over 10,000 barrels of 
oil per day, as well as the 
discovery of the Yousefieh oil 
field, which is located just three 
kilometres from the Khurbet East 
early production facility. 
I joined Gulfsands after almost 10 
years of service with OMV, for 
three primary reasons. Firstly, the 
Group has a strong balance sheet 
with no debt and is highly cash 
generative. Secondly, the assets 
held were of a high calibre, in 
particular Block 26 in Syria where 
significant upside exists, and 
thirdly, I was impressed with the 
quality and the blend of skills of 
senior management and 
members of the Board. Having 
restructured the Company in 
2008 and focused on its strategy 
of fast-tracking the development 
of its Middle East assets, 
Gulfsands is now in a good 
position to grow substantially over 
the next 12 months and beyond. 
Since joining the Company last 
October, I have further 
strengthened the technical and 
financial teams based in London 
to enable us to better service our 
operations in the Middle East.
It is clear we have a number of 
key challenges ahead. This 
period of relatively low oil prices 
places pressure on cash flow 
and requires a prudent, but 
balanced, approach to 
investment. In the USA, the 
relative maturity of our assets in 
the Gulf of Mexico is evidenced 
by the downgrading of our 
proved and probable reserves by 
3.8 million barrels of oil 
equivalent (“mmboe”) to 5.1 
mmboe at year-end (working 
interest basis), owing to sharply 
higher levels of water production 
in certain wells. We intend to 
contain expenditures in our US 
business, with future activity 
concentrating on high impact, 
low risk, low cost operations that 
have the potential to efficiently 
increase production and ultimate 
reserves. In Syria, however, our 
assets are at a very early stage 
of development. The exploration 
period in Block 26 will finally 
cease in August 2012 and as a 
result, a very active programme 
is required to fully evaluate and 
capture opportunities prior to 
this date. As we have 
demonstrated with development 
of the Khurbet East field, 
additional discoveries will be 
efficiently commercialised. 
Gulfsands aims to be one of the 
pre-eminent independent 
exploration and production 
companies in the Middle East 
and a preferred partner and 
operator. We will focus on low 
cost, high impact onshore 
operations with significant equity 
interests in a small number of 
countries where we can 
capitalise on strong local 
relationships. Our primary focus 
will continue to be Syria where
we intend to build on our 
success and reinvest in new 
value-adding projects. We also 
intend to capitalise on 
opportunities to position the 
Group for the longer term in Iraq. 
During 2008 Gulfsands 
established an impressive track 
record in exploration, appraisal, 
development and production. 
The Yousefieh oil discovery was 
made in November with a  
63 metre net oil column being 
encountered which flowed at 
rates of up to 1,460 barrels of oil 
per day via a 48/64 inch choke 
over a four hour test period. 
Approval to develop the Khurbet 
East field through an early 
production facility was gained in 
February 2008 and only five 
months later the facility had been 
constructed, development wells 
drilled and oil produced. The 
time taken from discovery of 
Khurbet East to first production 
was just 13 months. The Khurbet 
East early production facility has 
consistently produced in excess 
of the 10,000 barrels of oil per 
day design capacity with little 
pressure depletion and minimal 
water production.
Building of a permanent 
production facility at Khurbet 
East will start in 2009 with the 
award of contracts in the third 
quarter, with the expectation that 
the 50,000 barrels of fluid per 
day (“bfpd”) facility will be 
commissioned by the end of 
2010. In the meantime, the 
capacity expansion of the early

production facility from 10,000 to 
18,000 bfpd will be in place by 
mid-year with three new Khurbet 
East development wells drilled in 
order to provide the additional 
volume of oil required to utilise 
this additional capacity. The 
Yousefieh discovery will be 
appraised in 2009 with the 
drilling of two wells and an 
application will be submitted for 
development of this field. 
The acquisition in 2009 of 850 km
2
 
of 3D seismic data surrounding 
the Khurbet East and Yousefieh 
oil fields will provide the best 
opportunity to identify new 
exploration prospects for drilling 
in late 2009 and 2010, in what 
has been demonstrated to be a 
highly prospective fairway. 
Processing of the data will take 
place in the third quarter, 
followed by seismic interpretation 
and prospect definition in the 
fourth quarter.
Due to high levels of activity in 
Syria, capital investment by the 
Group for both 2009 and 2010 
will be in the order of $40 million, 
all of which is expected to be 
fully funded from operating cash 
flow. In 2010, in addition to an 
active exploration programme, 
seven development wells are 
planned to be drilled in the 
Khurbet East field and an as yet 
undefined number of 
development wells at Yousefieh. 
Consequently, a very busy year 
ahead is expected on many 
fronts. The hard work, innovative
 approach and dedication of all 
employees during 2008 is duly 
recognised and appreciated, 
along with the support of 
shareholders as the Company 
prepares to meet its objectives 
and continues to build an ever 
stronger exploration and 
production company in the 
Middle East.

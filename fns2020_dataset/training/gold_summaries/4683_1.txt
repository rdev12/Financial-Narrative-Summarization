 Although revenue declined during  
the year by 4% in underlying terms, 
adjusting for movements in foreign 
currency, it grew by 2%. This is despite  
a slow start to the year. Sales volumes  
of edible collagen grew by 3%.
We had some notable successes in our 
key strategic markets.
China 
Our sales volumes more than doubled  
in the world’s largest collagen casing 
market, as we strengthened our market 
presence in advance of our new 
Nantong factory coming on-line  
in 2016.
North America
Solid volume growth of 6% in this 
mature market reinforces the 
opportunity for our £45 million 
investment in our new USA plant.
REVENUE GROWTH
STRATEGY IN ACTION
2014 highlights REVENUE GROWTH
Germany
Strong sales growth of 40% where our 
premium products perform well in this 
demanding market.
Japan
Another exacting market, in which sales 
volume grew by 13%, where we have 
partnered with customers to develop 
innovative products for the growing 
snack sector.
Co-extrusion gel
Another year of progress in what  
is becoming a dynamic global 
marketplace. MANUFACTURING 
EFFICIENCY
During the year, we invested £69 million 
as part of our three-year programme to 
transform our manufacturing footprint. 
This programme will reduce the unit cost 
of manufacture, increase capacity in 
Asia and align our product portfolio  
with local markets.
USA investment 
We have now completed the 
construction of the building and 
commenced installation of equipment 
for our new manufacturing hall in South 
Carolina. This high-technology plant will 
replace our existing ageing, inefficient 
manufacturing equipment and will 
produce proven products for the 
Americas snack stick market.
2014 highlights
STRATEGY IN ACTION China investment
Having secured land at a long-
established industrial development park 
earlier in the year, the construction of 
the new plant is well advanced with the 
building structure now in place and 
equipment arriving ready for installation. 
This new plant will create production 
capacity in the fastest-growing collagen 
market in the world.
Restructuring of existing operations
After careful consideration and planning, 
we have restructured our operations in 
Scotland to take out older, less efficient 
capacity and focus production on  
the products which best match our 
customers’ needs. In Australia, we have 
outsourced our hide preparation 
operations. Together these changes  
will reduce fixed costs and generate 
annual savings of £5 million.

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s review
Angus Russell, Chief Executive Officer
Throughout 2011 at Shire, we were thinking about
value. About how to do more in challenging times.
About understanding the complex and interwoven
needs of patients, physicians, payors, and
policymakers. We recognize that patients’ lives improve
only when we understand not just them, but the 
entire web of care. We believe that when we respond
thoughtfully to the concerns of others, we perpetuate
what we’ve come to call the circle of value. We’re not
just interested in advancing our own standing in the
healthcare community. We’re committed to the basic
ideal that when we can help create value for others, 
we become more valuable ourselves.
Our long-term strategy of delivering differentiated
specialty products, focusing on symptomatic diseases,
and making responsible, disciplined investments in
research and development produced yet another
strong year. Our worldwide product sales were up 26%
for the year, revenue grew to $4,263 million, operating
income was $1,109 million, and diluted earnings per
ADS were $4.53. With some 5,000 people operating
in 29 countries, and a balanced portfolio of products,
we continued to leverage a strategy that year-after-year
delivers results, even in turbulent economic times. 
Still, we want to do more. We’re focused on all our
stakeholders—patients, physicians, policymakers,
payors, investors, and employees. In 2011, we spent
time in the company of patients, their families, their
communities. We talked to physicians about the
frustrations they face as they seek to treat symptoms
and make diagnoses. We talked to policymakers
around the world and we talked to payors about how
they measure and reward value. We talked, we
listened, and we responded to the benefit of all of our
stakeholders—systematically advancing our pipeline. 
We grew both organically and through acquisitions. 
We continued to explore the potential application 
of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, currently approved 
as VYVANSE in the US for children and adults with
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), 
in conditions ranging from negative symptoms and
cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and major
depressive disorder to binge eating and excessive
daytime sleepiness. These are all conditions for which
there are not, at this time, adequate treatments.
We also made significant headway in our research on
the potential application of mesalamine, our ulcerative
colitis medicine sold as LIALDA/MEZAVANT in 16
countries around the world, for those diagnosed with

diverticulitis. Two Phase 3 studies will be completed
this year for this painful and life-altering condition,
which often results in repeated flare-ups and is not
adequately managed by current medicines. 
At the same time, within our Human Genetic Therapies
(“HGT”) business, we continued our exploration of the
potential application of intrathecal delivery—the use 
of ports to deliver medicine directly to the central
nervous system—for the treatment of Hunter syndrome,
Sanfilippo, and Metachromatic Leukodystrophy. As this
research program advances, we hope to be able to 
do more for patients diagnosed with these often life-
threatening and heartbreaking diseases. 
We made great headway as well for patients depending
on our HGT enzyme replacement therapy products. 
The accelerated construction and approval of a new
manufacturing facility, in Lexington, Massachusetts,
ensured greater access and a sustainable supply 
of medication for patients diagnosed with Fabry and
Gaucher disease. Meanwhile, we beat our own
deadlines as we worked to expand the manufacturing
capacity of VPRIV , now available in 30 countries across
Europe and serving patients with type 1 Gaucher
disease. We also launched FIRAZYR, an orphan drug
used for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary
angioedema (“HAE”) in adults 18 years of age or 
older in the US. Throughout the year, we continued 
to meet with patients and physicians— in conferences
and at special meetings—all with an eye toward
working together to ensure better diagnoses and 
more effective treatments.
Our ambition to reach beyond our current expertise
also resulted in the acquisition of Advanced
BioHealing, Inc. (“ABH”), which brought us a new
business in Regenerative Medicine—adding to our
portfolio DERMAGRAFT, a bioengineered skin
substitute that assists in restoring damaged tissue 
and supports the body’s natural healing process.
Created from cultured skin cells and applied via a
biodegradable mesh, DERMAGRAFT is approved in
the US for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. The
continued growth of ABH within Shire has, we believe,
demonstrated the potential that can be made from 
a focused regenerative medicine business. We are
excited about the opportunities in this area and 
are looking forward to bringing DERMAGRAFT
to more patients and to expanding Shire’s offering 
in regenerative medicine.
We strengthened our global presence throughout 
the year—expanding our international hub in Nyon,

Switzerland, with diverse and talented people; opening
offices and finalizing marketing agreements in countries
ranging from Brazil to Japan and keeping an eager eye
on new opportunities where we can serve our multiple
stakeholders effectively.
Throughout the year, we made continuing investments
in our culture—reinforcing, through numerous channels,
just what it is to be a Shire employee. Through 
various programs we reinforced our commitment 
to differentiating ourselves as the company that 
always strives to be as brave as the people we help.
We worked to ensure that our employees are inspired
by our strategic vision, that they understand the
importance of fostering our brave values, and that 
they are improving their ability to both listen and
respond—all of which contributes to our collaborative,
responsible environment. 
We launched the first of what will become an annual
external recognition program—the BRAVE Awards, 
in which non-professional caregivers from around the
world were recognized and rewarded for their courage
and dedication, and for the difference they make 
in the lives of those they care for. 
Though by many measures 2011 will be remembered
as another year of great success for Shire, we also
think of it as a year in which we developed new growth
opportunities. In 2012, we’ll continue to invest in our
people, pipeline, and values—in those things that
differentiate us as a company. We’ll prepare for the
launch of VENVANSE in Europe, advance pipeline
projects, and look for new acquisitions—defining 
and assessing the value of such programs as early 
as possible. 
But most of all, we will be listening—paying acute
attention to the world around us and continuing 
to address the needs of the stakeholders who make 
up our circle of value. I look forward to sharing our
news with you as the year progresses. 
Finally, I would like to acknowledge those who make
Shire’s story so distinct, so vibrant, and so full of
promise: our people. Many have been helping to drive
our growth for some years now. Others, such as the
400 or so individuals from ABH and the talent newly
hired into positions all around the world, are just
starting to contribute their insights, creativity, and
expertise to Shire. Speaking for the entire Leadership
Team, we are grateful for the relentless efforts and
dedication, the ambitions, and the proven capabilities
of all Shire employees.

Creating stakeholder value
Our commitment to delivering value
We’ve built Shire into one of the most
successful specialty biopharmaceutical
companies in the world. 
Everyone who works at Shire is
committed to delivering value in the

It’s an approach that brings real,

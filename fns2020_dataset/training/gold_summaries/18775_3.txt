ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008

The results for the year ended 30 June 2008 
show an operating profit on operations 
before exceptional costs of £0.708 million 
(2007: £1.357 million) and a loss before tax of 
£4.189 million (2007: profit £1.123 million).
Since floating in March 2007 the Company is operating 
with a strong balance sheet and has now completed 
the purchase of 20 development sites which have the 
potential for 1,360 plots and 253,000 square feet of 
commercial space. During the year, we have secured 
planning consents on four sites for 468 residential 
units and 105,000 square feet of commercial space.
Since the last annual report and accounts there has 
been an unprecedented fall in confidence in the housing 
market with house prices having declined significantly. 
As a result there has been a serious reduction in demand 
for land from both volume and other house builders.
There appears to be little prospect of any material 
improvement in the housing market until mortgage finance 
and consumer confidence returns and with financial 
markets being increasingly volatile and dysfunctional, 
any recovery may be some considerable time away.
We are therefore examining alternative uses on a number of 
our sites and are in discussions with a number of potential 
purchasers with particular interest coming from the housing 
associations and the hotel and nursing home sectors. 
FINANCIAL summAry
Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2008 was 
£11.0 million (2007: £5.5 million). This was principally 
achieved by the sale of 98 development plots across 
three sites which had been successfully taken 
through the planning process, together with a listed 
building suitable for conversion into residential 
units and a commercial building that was let.
Market conditions have seriously declined over the last 
few weeks and as a result the Board decided to carry 
out a further review of the carrying value of its land 
holding. Whilst a number of our sites are still showing 
potential profitability we believe it is appropriate 
to write down the value of part of our portfolio by 
£4.783 million to reflect the values at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value in the current market place.
The Group continued to increase its activity in the course 
of the year with inventories standing at £47.68 million 
(2007: £38.79 million). We had cash of £4.60 million (2007: 
£42.84 million) as at the balance sheet date and net assets 
were £53.32 million (2007: £61.77 million) being 32.9p 
(2007: 38.1p) per share. Further to the announcement 
dated 4 August 2008 we confirm that we are in ongoing 
discussions with our bank to agree the level of security 
required to put in place a bank facility of £15 million. In the 
meantime, our existing overdraft facility stands at £7 million 
secured by way of a debenture and is available until 31 
July 2009. The extension to £15 million requires credit 
committee approval though the Directors are confident 
based on the Group’s substantial assets that this will 
take place once a suitable level of collateral is agreed.
The current portfolio generates residential and 
commercial letting income of £636,000 per annum.

LAND
The Group’s main focus at the moment is on 
securing planning consents on the existing portfolio. 
The current market conditions are now presenting 
some potentially attractive propositions which are being 
examined, however due to the extremely difficult trading 
environment we are taking a very cautious approach.
On 4 August 2008, we announced that heads of terms 
had been agreed for the sale of our site at Ashford 
h ospital near h eathrow subject to consent being obtained 
for a hotel. Unfortunately the potential purchaser 
has now withdrawn, but we are in discussions with 
other potential hotel operators regarding the site.
We continue to believe that the fundamentals of our 
business model remain sound because of the overall 
constraints in the supply of development land in the 
United k ingdom and the underlying demand for housing. 
In addition major housebuilders who are not in the land 
market at present and who are currently using up their 
existing land stocks will need to replenish their landbanks 
in due course. The current downturn is also resulting in 
less planning applications being submitted thereby further 
restricting the supply of land with planning consent.
PLANNINg CoNstrAINts
Unfortunately the planning system has continued 
to deteriorate since we reported our interim results.
With a few exceptions, most planning departments seem to 
go out of their way to frustrate development opportunities 
and rarely encourage the initiative, enthusiasm and 
professionalism that Inland puts into its projects.

The difficulties that the sector continues to experience 
and the resulting delays caused, impairs our ability 
to realise attractive opportunities. This impediment 
is compounded when the rapid decline in the housing 
market has prevented a number of sales being achieved 
at good margins, had consents been received earlier.
We continue to take a robust and tenacious approach 
to the planning problems we are experiencing but the 
process is nevertheless time consuming and frustrating.
INvestmeNts
h owarth h omes PLC where we hold 15% of 
the equity and a further 20% by way of convertible 
loan stock is experiencing challenging conditions in 
line with others in the house building industry.
h owarth had taken a decision to pre sell over £24 million 
of their stock last year and most of those completions 
have now taken place. The focus is on cash generation 
and sales are still being achieved albeit at reduced 
margins. h owarth are currently operating on six 
sites totalling 51 homes. The company has a land and 
development facility of £20 million from Royal Bank of 
Scotland and are currently operating well within this.
Inland are working closely with h owarth on new 
initiatives where land can be sold for social housing by 
Inland with h owarth securing the building contract.
At 30 June 2008 the Group held a stake in M J Gleeson 
PLC representing 3.74% of its issued share capital with 
a carrying value of £3.06 million. The carrying value of 
other listed investments amounted to £0.84 million.

Despite the current turbulent market conditions 
we believe that the long-term fundamentals of the land 
market and Inland’s business model remain sound.

Moving into the next phase of development
Hance Fullerton
Chairman
The year to 30 April 2007 was one of 
significant investment and progress in  
the portfolio of Progeny
®
 companies.  
The maturing portfolio had two exits 
during the year, Acolyte Biomedica and 
Corpora, and investment in one company, 
InnoMatica, was ceased as it failed to meet 
our ongoing Progeny
®
 investment criteria.
Focus
As announced on 1 May 2007, a review of 
the business has been undertaken with 
the objective of delivering profitability.  
To achieve this, the primary focus for the 
immediate future will be realising value 
from the existing portfolio of companies, 
rather than on the establishment of 
additional new companies. 
The plan set out three areas in which an 
immediate improvement in profitability 
was intended as follows:
Investment in new Progeny
®
 companies 
to be deferred in order to focus efforts 
on the existing portfolio. This will 
reduce the operating loss in respect 
of direct investments in Progeny
®
 
companies in the current financial year. 
Operating costs and staffing to be 
substantially reduced. The priority to 
be on realising value from the existing 
portfolio of investments rather than 
sourcing, evaluating and setting up 
new companies. 
‡
‡
The fee-for-service business to focus 
on the profitable Management services 
business, which has long term contracts 
already in place, rather than short term 
consulting work. This will also result in 
significant savings in staff costs. 
I am pleased to report that strong 
progress has already been made in  
each of these key areas as follows: 
The operating loss in respect of direct 
investments in Progeny
®
 companies is 
expected to be approximately half that 
of the previous year. 
Operating costs and staffing have been 
reduced by £2.3 million on an 
annualised basis.
A profit of £4.0 million has been 
delivered through an initial fair value 
gain on the Company’s holding in 
Geomerics as a result of the third party 
investment. 
The fee-for-service business is now 
focused on the Management services 
business, which is expected to deliver in 
excess of £0.4 million profit in the year. 
Outlook 
ANGLE is on track with its plan to deliver 
ongoing profitability. Following on from 
the successful third party investment in 
Geomerics, we are seeking similar 
transactions for other key portfolio 
companies. Meanwhile our Management

opportunities for its development look 
favourable. 
I intend to retire from the Board of 
ANGLE at the Annual General Meeting 
on 20 September 2007. I will leave the 
Board in the capable hands of Garth 
Selvey who will succeed me as Non-
executive Chairman. Garth joined 
ANGLE as a Non-executive Director in 
September 2006 and has developed a 
wealth of experience in all aspects of 
corporate life including company growth, 
securing venture capital investment, 
attracting new investors, disposals, 
acquisitions and integration, as well as 
being CEO of Comino Group, a fully 
listed Company on the London Stock 
Exchange, prior to its acquisition by 
Civica plc in 2006.
I would like to thank the Chief Executive, 
other directors and senior management 
for all their support over the years. I look 
forward to hearing of ANGLE’s success in 
the future.

Overview
Financial results 
Another year of solid ﬁnancial performance.

with contribution margins in the Lighting 
segment growing from 35.7% in 2011 to 44.3%

38.6% to 42.0 pence including a £0.7m proﬁt

operations of the business of £0.4m net of tax 
(2011: £0.3m loss).

to approval by the shareholders, a ﬁnal dividend

Board changes
During the year Harry T ee CBE announced 
his decision to step down from his position as 
Chairman of the Board and in September 2012, 
following an external recruitment process, I was 
appointed Group Chairman having previously been 
Dialight’ s Senior Independent Director. The Board 
has also recently announced the appointment 
of two new Non-Executive Directors, Stephen Bird 
who joins the Board as Senior Independent Director 
and Tracey Graham who joins as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
Staff
Many signiﬁcant changes were made at Dialight 
during 2012. Throughout the year our employees 
continued to work hard and their efforts are 
evident in the Group’s results. I would like to 
thank everyone for their continued commitment, 
support and hard work.
Current trading and outlook 
2013 should see continued strong growth in 
Lighting driven by expanded sales channels and 
new products. We see further enhancements to 
the value that our products bring to our customers 
as Dialight’s technical teams capitalise on the 
ongoing developments in LED technology. 
The growth in revenues and the Group’s focus 
on the cost and performance of its products 
gives us conﬁdence for a future of sustainable 
proﬁt improvement in this year and the years 
to follow.

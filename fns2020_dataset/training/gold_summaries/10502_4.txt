The Group recorded a substantial increase in its reported visitors from 27 April 2008 to the end of June 2008 following a release 1. 
made in respect of the anti-virus software AVG. In assessing whether a webpage was safe it ‘followed’ every link or URL displayed 
on an email or webpage to the destination website. This meant that many web based businesses including the Group recorded 
visitors from users of the AVG software who themselves did not technically visit the website. The 2008 visitor count has been 
adjusted for the estimated impact of this. AVG released a further update to its anti-virus software early in July 2008 which resolved 
the issue.

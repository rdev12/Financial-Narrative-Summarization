Chairman’s  
Introduction
We made good progress this year driving growth 
through our total tobacco portfolio in many markets, 
while effectively managing our costs and cash flows, 
all of which are central to our success. 
Our performance further demonstrates our growth 
potential although our overall results this year were 
held back by the exceptional circumstances in Spain 
and the impact of trade buying patterns in the UK. 
We see considerable opportunities ahead and 
continue to focus on creating long-term sustainable 
value for our shareholders.
Results and Dividends
1 
We grew our tobacco net revenues by 2.0 per cent  
and our total adjusted operating profits were up by  
1.3 per cent at £3.1 billion. We delivered 5.4 per cent 
growth in adjusted earnings per share to 188.0 pence. 
Basic earnings per share were 177.3 pence (2010:  
148.5 pence). 
We have increased our dividend payout ratio to  
50.6 per cent of adjusted earnings per share and the 
Board recommends a final dividend of 67.0 pence  
per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 
95.1 pence per share, up by 12.8 per cent. This will  
be paid on 17 February 2012 with an ex dividend date 
of 18 January 2012.
2011 Performance Overview and Achievements
Sustainable Sales Growth: We made gains in  
the EU and delivered an excellent performance in 
emerging markets outside the EU. Our key strategic 
brands Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes, West and JPS 
had another strong year with overall volumes up  
4 per cent

. 
We also delivered excellent growth in fine cut tobacco 
and snus and grew volumes of both our mass market 
and premium cigars.
Cost Optimisation: Strong financial discipline is 
embedded across our business and we continue to 
focus on efficiencies and made productivity gains of  
3 per cent. Tobacco operating margins were again 
over 42 per cent due to price increases and ongoing 
cost optimisation. 
Cash Utilisation: We use our substantial cash flows 
to reward our shareholders and to reinvest in growing 
our sales. We delivered a strong dividend increase  
this year and we intend to continue steadily increasing 
dividends per share ahead of the growth in adjusted 
earnings per share. 
At our half year results in May we announced a share 
buyback programme of £500 million on an annualised 
basis and spent £181 million acquiring 8.7 million 
shares during the balance of the financial year.
Corporate Governance and  
Corporate Responsibility
Good governance and the responsible way we 
manage our business are fundamental to our 
approach and underpin our long-term sustainability. 
Our responsible approach is reflected in external 
benchmarks: both our performance in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index and by another Gold award rating 
from the UK’s Business in the Community Corporate 
Responsibility Index.
We have again incorporated our corporate 
responsibility reporting into our annual report on  
pages 33 to 41 and are one of the few FTSE 100 
companies to assure our responsibility performance  
to the AA1000 stakeholder engagement standard.
Board Changes
In October 2011, Malcolm Wyman was appointed  
as a Non-Executive Director and we announced  
that Pierre Jungels will retire as Senior Independent 
Non-Executive at the conclusion of our 2012 Annual 
General Meeting. In addition, Graham Blashill,  
Group Sales and Marketing Director, retired from  
the Board following our Annual General Meeting in 
February 2011. 
I would like to welcome Malcolm to the Board and  
thank Pierre and Graham for their contribution to  
our success and wish them both well for the future.

People
Our employees are central to our success and I would 
like to thank them for their dedication and hard work. 
Their consistent focus on delivering results gives me 
confidence that we will realise our growth potential. 
In Conclusion 
We are focused on delivering quality earnings growth 
and I believe we are well positioned to build on our 
achievements. 
Our focus on sales, underpinned by our disciplined 
approach to cost and cash management will enable  
us to continue to create long-term sustainable value 
for our shareholders.

In 2011, we outperformed the FTSE 100 
by 25 per cent. With dividends 
reinvested, £100 invested in Imperial 
Tobacco five years ago would now be 
worth £172 compared to just £106 if 
invested in the FTSE 100 Index.

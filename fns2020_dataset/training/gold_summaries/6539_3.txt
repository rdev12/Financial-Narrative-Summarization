A YEAR OF 
GOOD STRATEGIC 
PROGRESS

BOB Laws ON
I	am	pleased	to	report	a	year	of	good	
progress,	as	we	implemented	the	
Group	strategy	that	we	introduced	
in	2012.	Following	last	year’s	record	
results,	financial	progress	was	more	
limited,	against	a	backdrop	of	very	
challenging	market	conditions	for	
the	Group’s	customers.	Despite	these	
tough	conditions,	Genus	continued	
to	invest	in	the	capabilities	it	needs	
to	capture	the	significant	long-term	
growth	opportunity	for	genetics.
The	strategy	and	organisational	
changes	arising	from	Karim’s	
strategic	review	gave	Genus	a	
sharp	focus	in	2013.	Aligning	the	
business	around	species	and	key	
customers	has	given	the	Group	a	
clarity	of	purpose	and	energy	that	
has	been	very	evident	to	the	Board.	
r esults
Genus’s	results	for	the	year	to	30	
June	2013	showed	modest	growth	
on	last	year’s	record	performance.	
Revenues	and	adjusted	operating	
profit	were	at	similar	levels	to	the	
prior	year,	while	adjusted	profit	
before	tax	rose	2%	to	£47.2m.	
Once	again,	Asia	led	the	way,	with	
profits	rising	by	14%.	However,	
high	feed	costs	and	low	output	
prices	for	our	customers	held	
back	performance	in	the	rest	of	
the	Group.	In	addition,	we	made	
planned	investments	in	resources	to	
strengthen	our	business.	Adjusted	
earnings	per	share	grew	3%	to	55p,	
benefiting	from	a	1%	lower	tax	rate.
On	a	statutory	basis,	profit	before	
tax	was	lower	than	the	previous	year,	
due	to	a	reduction	in	the	fair	value	
calculation	of	our	bovine	biological	
assets	under	IAS	41,	as	we	anticipate	
a	shift	towards	more	genomic	sales.	
The	prior	year	had	benefited	from	
an	IAS	41	exceptional	credit.	As	we	
have	consistently	said,	the	nature	
and	volatility	of	this	non-cash	
accounting	item	does	not	reflect	our	
underlying	business	performance.	
We	therefore	use	adjusted	profits	
to	report	externally	and	to	measure	
our	performance	internally.	
During	the	year,	we	reduced	net	
debt	to	£52.9m,	which	is	below	
one	times	EBITDA.	This	gives	
the	Group	substantial	financial	
flexibility	to	pursue	its	plans.
Dividend
The	Board	is	recommending	a	final	
dividend	of	11.1	pence	per	share,	
which	together	with	the	interim	
dividend	of	5	pence	per	share,	
would	result	in	a	dividend	for	the	
year	of	16.1	pence	per	share,	an	
increase	of	10%	over	last	year’s	
dividend.	This	continues	our	
progressive	dividend	policy	and	
reflects	the	Board’s	confidence	in	
Genus’s	future.	It	is	proposed	that	
the	final	dividend	will	be	paid	on	
6	December	2013,	to	shareholders	
on	the	register	at	the	close	of	
business	on	22	November	2013.
strategy
Following	his	appointment	in	
September	2011,	Karim	initiated	
a	thorough	strategic	review.	We	
announced	the	outcome	of	this	
process	in	May	2012.	Our	focus	in	
2013	has	been	to	implement	this	
strategy	and	to	invest,	so	that	Genus	
can	seize	the	significant	opportunities	
presented	by	the	growing	use	of	
genetics	to	make	animal	protein	
more	affordable	and	sustainable,	
to feed	a	growing	world	population.
As	I	reported	last	year,	the	
strategy	started	by	focusing	on	
our	customers’	needs.	To	serve	
them	better,	we	introduced	a	
new	organisation	that	aligned	our	
resources	around	species	and	key	
growth	areas,	with	a	particular	focus	
on	Asia.	This	has	enabled	us	to	
focus	on	disseminating	best	practice	
around	the	world,	whilst	adapting	our	
business	to	meet	the	unique	needs	
of	the	major	developing	nations.
Second,	we	renewed	our	emphasis	
on	leading	through	innovation	in	
research	and	development.	The	early	
results	of	this	investment	have	been	
encouraging,	such	as	the	single-
step	genomic	evaluation	process	
described	on	page	28.	This	is	just	one	
of	several	initiatives	Genus	is	pursuing.
Finally,	we	said	that	we	would	ensure	
that	Genus	had	the	right	resources	
and	competencies	in	key	functions,	
such	as	supply	chain,	technical	
services	and	marketing,	to	deliver	our	
strategy.	The	Group	has	made	strong	
progress	in	bringing	highly	talented	
individuals	into	the	organisation,	
to	strengthen	these	areas.
A	fuller	discussion	of	our	substantial	
progress	with	implementing	our	
strategy	can	be	found	in	Karim’s	
Chief	Executive’s	Report	report	and	
throughout	the	rest	of	this	document.

took	a	well-deserved	retirement.	
John	served	Genus	as	both	a	Non-
Executive	and	an	Executive	Director	
over	eight	years	and	contributed	
enormously	to	the	Group’s	progress	
over	this	time,	through	his	energy,	
wisdom	and	skill.	He	leaves	us	
with	our	deeply	felt	thanks	and	
very	best	wishes	for	the	future.
The	Board	was	pleased	to		
recruit	Stephen	Wilson	as	the		
new	Group	Finance	Director.		
He	is	already	making	a	valued	
contribution	as	an	Executive	
Director	and	Board	member.	In	
addition,	we	have	welcomed	Tom	
Kilroy	as	our	new	Group	General	
Counsel	&	Company	Secretary.	
He	brings	a	wealth	of	commercial,	
intellectual	property,	legal	and	
executive	experience	to	the	Group.	
In	addition	to	Tom	and	Stephen,	
the	Genus	Executive	Leadership	
Team	has	been	strengthened	by	the	
appointment	of	Saskia	Korink	Romani	
as	Chief	Marketing	Officer.	In	July,	
Saskia	took	on	the	role	of	acting	
Chief	Operating	Officer,	Genus	ABS.
Of	course,	so	much	of	the	driving	
force	behind	our	business	comes	
from	the	skills	and	capabilities	of	
our	people,	who	operate	in	more	
than	30	countries	worldwide.	I	have	
had	the	opportunity	to	meet	many	
of	them	this	year	and	I	continue	to	
be	impressed	by	their	enthusiasm	
and	professionalism.	On	behalf	of	
the	Board	and	our	shareholders,	
I would	like	to	thank	all	of	Genus’s	
employees	for	their	dedication	
and	commitment	to	achieving	
so	much	progress	in	2013.
in s ummary
2013	was	undoubtedly	a	difficult		
year	for	the	global	agricultural	
industry,	which	was	severely	
affected	by	drought	in	the	US	
and	poor	harvests	in	Europe.	
Throughout	this	tough	period,	
Genus	continued	to	deliver	growth	
on	top	of	last	year’s	record	results	
and	made	significant	progress	in	
fundamentally	transforming	its	
business	and	investing	for	growth.	
The	Board	and	I	are	confident	that	
the	business	has	never	had	stronger	
foundations	to	take	advantage	
of	the	opportunities	in	the	global	
market	for	animal	genetics.

Transforming Our 
Customers’ Herd Fertility 
Performance
We know that efficiently producing high 
genetic quality pregnancies drives herd 
profitability, and that customers’ goals 
and production systems vary. 
Our Reproductive Management System (‘RMS’) team 
therefore optimises customers’ herd pregnancies by 
providing tailored solutions based on sound science, 
training and vast field experience. 
In the UK and Ireland, RMS has grown rapidly to service 
686 farms, with nearly 170,000 cows or 10% of the 
national herd. The service is provided by 131 technicians, 
nine leaders and eight RMS trainers, supported by a 
technical services team.
Our unique combination of skilled people, accurate data and 
standardised working has transformed fertility performance. 
The average pregnancy rate for UK and Ireland RMS 
customers’ herds is 18%, well above the national average of 
14%. RMS has also hugely influenced herd expansion and our 
customers’ businesses. For example we have worked with 
Bowe Dairy Farming Company as a breeding company and 
farm consultants since 1998. Since then the business has 
grown from 80 to 600 cows. RMS has been an integral 
support to the business since 2007, helping the company 
achieve a pregnancy rate of 24%.

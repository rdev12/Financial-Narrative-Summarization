 04 Gaming Realms plc Annual Report & Accounts 2015
The acquisition of  
Slingo IP and games  
perfectly fits our strategy 
for delivering mobile 
based entertainment 
content. The results 
speak for themselves in 
so far as we have higher 
margin games, lower 
CPAs and a great pipeline 
of licensing deals.
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased  
to report that significant progress was 
made in 2015. We have developed and 
published real money and free to play 
original content on our new proprietary 
gaming platform, with positive business 
intelligence, growth and results 
supporting our strategy. This has 
continued into the current year.
In August 2015, Gaming Realms 
completed the acquisition of the 
GameHouse social and mobile assets 
and Slingo brand from RealNetworks, 
Inc. With this came the IP for Slingo, 
a new social games platform, a portfolio 
of mobile games, two games studios 
and highly experienced teams in Seattle 
and Vancouver Island.
During the year, two original Slingo real 
money games were developed and 
published on the Grizzly platform, and 
have quickly become amongst our best 
performing games in the UK. In our 
social business we launched two free to 
play mobile apps during the year (Slingo 
Blast and Lucky Streak Slots), as well as 
continuing to publish and monetise 
several acquired games including 
Hidden Artifacts.
Since the acquisition from RealNetworks, 
we have signed new strategic 
partnership agreements with Zynga and 
Scientific Games to distribute Slingo into 
adjacent gaming markets currently 
outside our strategic focus. This clearly 
highlights the strength of our IP and 
ability to extend its reach into massive 
markets such as national and state 
lotteries as well as the global gaming 
machine market with leading providers.

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Our strategic focus has been further 
underlined by streamlining our 
operational focus on our own proprietary 
technology and game publishing.  
We have therefore sold our third-party 
platform gaming assets as we believed 
we could achieve superior economics 
from selling these assets, as well as 
increasing management focus in the 
areas of highest shareholder return.
Financial review
As indicated in the trading update in 
January, I am pleased to report that the 
Group has delivered full year 2015 
revenue of £21.2m and an adjusted 
EBITDA loss of £4.1m, which is in line 
with market expectations. The 2015 
performance has seen an increase of 
revenue of 116% versus the comparable 
12 months to 31 December 2014. 
Adjusted EBITDA loss has also decreased 
by 30% in the same period.
People
During 2015 the Group deepened its 
talent pool in critical areas related to our 
platform and content development, and 
the social gaming acquisition brought 
a further 57 experienced professionals 
into Gaming Realms. At year end we 
employed 169 people (2014: 84). 
It is the view of the Board that this 
expansion in multiple territories continues 
to have a very positive impact on both 
culture and performance. 
Outlook for 2016
The first quarter of 2016 has seen further 
increase in like-for-like revenues of 7%  
to £7.5m from the previous quarter  
(Q4 2015: £7.0m).
OPERATIONAL 
HIGHLIGHTS
Increase in active daily  
players compared to  
previous financial year.
+478% 78,198
+199%
3,639
Increase in new real money 
gambling depositors compared  
to the previous financial year.
Our strategy of investing in content, 
platforms, and building a large and 
profitable audience continues to drive 
our growth. In addition to our B2B 
licensing partnerships into global lottery 
and land-based casino markets, our 
ability to attract highly complementary 
media brands such as Britain’s Got 
Talent, the X Factor and Deal or No Deal 
into our own B2C business offers us 
potential for further growth in the 
remainder of 2016.
The Board is excited by the progress 
of the Group in the year under review, 
encouraged by the developments 
already achieved in the current year, and 
believes that shareholders should share 
their enthusiasm and confidence in the 
future of Gaming Realms.

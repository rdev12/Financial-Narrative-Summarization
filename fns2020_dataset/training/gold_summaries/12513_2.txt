Notes
On pages 04 to 77 of this report the Group’s results for the year ended 31 December 2013 are presented on an ‘Underlying business’ basis, unless otherwise stated. 
This includes the performance of the Bread division which was held as ‘assets for sale’ at the year end and excludes the impact of disposals and milling sales as this 
basis better reflects the performance of the core business of the Group and aids comparison with last year’s results. A reconciliation to the statutory numbers can be 
found on page 43.

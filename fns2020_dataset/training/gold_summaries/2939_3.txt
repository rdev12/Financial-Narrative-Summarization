A Year of Good Progress
03 Carillion plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The strength of the enlarged Group is also clearly evident in the
value of its order book, which more than doubled to £16 billion 
at the year-end (2005: £7 billion). Mowlem’s order book at
acquisition was approximately £2.5 billion, therefore most of 
this increase came from new orders won during the year.
The good progress we have made in 2006, particularly with the
integration of the Carillion and Mowlem businesses, is due to
the leadership of our management team and the commitment
and professionalism of our people. On behalf of the Board 
I should like to thank all our employees for the contributions 
they have made to the integration process and to Carillion’s
success in 2006. 
With an order book of £16 billion and strong positions in 
a wider range of growth markets, we have created a more
resilient business, capable of accelerating our strategy for
growth. This positive outlook for the Group confirms the 
Board’s view that Carillion is firmly on track to deliver 
materially enhanced earnings in 2007. 
Chris Girling retires from the Board on 30 April 2007, having
served as Finance Director since shortly after Carillion was
launched as an independent company in 1999. Chris has 
played a major role in Carillion’s development and he 
leaves with the Board’s grateful thanks for his outstanding
contribution to the Company’s success and with our very best
wishes for the future. Our new finance director, Richard Adam,
joins the Board on 2 April from Associated British Ports where
he has been Group Finance Director since 1999. Richard is an
experienced and successful Finance Director with strong
operational and business management skills and we are
delighted to welcome him to the Board.
As I announced in my interim report to shareholders, we
strengthened the Board during the year with the appointment
in September 2006 of Don Kenny as an executive director and
Steve Mogford as a non-executive director. Don is a Managing
Director responsible for six Carillion business units and brings to
the Board extensive experience not only of Carillion’s business,
but also our industry sector, having held a number of senior
positions in Carillion and in other major UK support services 
and construction companies. Steve has been a main Board
director of BAE Systems for over six years and is currently 
BAE’s Chief Operating Officer responsible for Programmes. 
With his considerable experience as a senior business leader 
and also in managing major capital projects, Steve will make 
a valuable contribution to the development of our business. 
In view of the Group’s performance in 2006 and prospects for 
2007, the Board is recommending a final ordinary dividend for 
2006 of 5.9 pence per share, making the total full-year dividend 
9.0 pence per share, an increase of 12.5 per cent on the total 
paid in respect of 2005 (8 pence per share). The final dividend 
for 2006 will be paid on 22 June 2007 to shareholders on the
register at close of business on 27 April 2007.

In particular, the benefits of acquiring Mowlem plc in 
February 2006 have been greater than expected at the time 
of acquisition: integration cost savings have increased, new
order intake has moved strongly ahead and the acquisition 
has been significantly earnings enhancing in 2006, rather than
earnings neutral. 
In 2006, revenue increased by some 57 per cent to £3,593
million, including joint ventures (2005: £2,284 million), which
reflects both organic growth and the acquisition of Mowlem.
Profit before tax, non-operating items and amortisation
increased by 48 per cent to £82.1 million (2005: £55.5 million).
Earnings per share on the same measure rose by 15 per cent 
to 23.5 pence per share (2005: 20.4 pence). 
Cash flow from operations was again strong and average net 
debt in 2006 was £110 million, well below the £200 million we
expected at the time of acquiring Mowlem. At 31 December
2006 the Group had net debt of £108 million. 
I am pleased to report that Carillion
made good progress in 2006 and 
either achieved or exceeded all our 
key financial and strategic objectives.

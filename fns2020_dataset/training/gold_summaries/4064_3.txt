 Chairman’s statement
Overview
I am pleased to report another year of significant progress. 
Our ‘Being Number One’ strategy is driving the Group’s  
success and is providing resilience in these challenging times. 
To finish the year with higher revenues and profits, a robust 
balance sheet, increased banking and bonding facilities, a 
record order book and a growing reputation for delivery is 
a major achievement and one that stands us in good stead  
for the year ahead.
Our clear and focused strategy is ensuring that the Group 
continues to win new business in sectors where there is a 
commitment to expenditure. Our established market positions  
in areas such as infrastructure, water, waste, energy, health  
and education are of critical importance and will ensure that  
we continue to deliver operational progress in 2009.
To take full advantage of market opportunities, the Group has 
been operationally realigned into five divisions: Infrastructure, 
Environment, Oil, Gas & Process, Community and Property 
Development. As Andrew Wyllie highlights in his Chief 
Executive’s review, this will also allow the business to  
broaden its offering within the markets where we have  
identified real potential.
Results
Revenue for the year was £996.0 million (2007: £877 .9 million). 
Profit from operations was £18.3 million (2007: £16.5 million), 
an increase of 11%.
Net financing income amounted to £4.8 million  
(2007: £3.3 million) which incorporated net interest income of  
£5.8 million (2007: £2.4 million) and a pension scheme related 
net interest cost of £1.0 million (2007: £0.9 million income).
Profit before tax was up 17% at £23.1 million  
(2007: £19.8 million). 
Basic earnings per share amounted to 2.9p (2007: 3.6p). The 
2008 earnings per share reflects the full annualised impact of the 
September 2007 rights issue, when the Group raised £60 million. 
The Group has no significant borrowings and net cash balances 
at the year end totalled £146.6 million (2007: £132.8 million), 
including the Group’s share of cash held by construction joint 
venture arrangements of £34.2 million (2007: £28.8 million).  
The average month end net cash balance during the year  
was £117 .4 million.
Dividend
The Board is recommending the payment of a final dividend  
for the year of 0.5p per share. If approved at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting, the dividend, which will be paid on  
22 May 2009 to shareholders on the register as at 24 April 
2009, would take the payment for the full year to 0.75p  
(2007: 0.5p), an increase of 50% over the prior year.
“ Our confidence in the  
future is reflected in the 
Board’s recommendation  
to increase the total  
dividend for the year.”

in a Channel 4 documentary shown in August 2008.  
The Footbridge was one of the schemes which formed  
the Castleford Project – an urban renewal initiative 
designed to give regeneration and new confidence  
to the former coal mining town. 
Pension
As at 31 December 2008, the deficit in the UK Pension Scheme 
recorded in the Group’s balance sheet in accordance with  
IAS 19 was £36.1 million, net of deferred tax, an improvement 
of £0.3 million from the position as at 31 December 2007 .
Board and Staff
Mr F W Ballard and Mr M A Sulaiman stepped down from  
the Board during the year. I thank them for their contribution 
and we wish them well for the future.
On behalf of the Board, I would also like to thank the 
management and staff at Costain for their continued hard work, 
dedication and loyalty. They can all be very proud of what has 
been achieved over the last year. 
Outlook
These very good results reinforce Costain’s position as one of 
the most successful businesses in the UK’s construction and 
engineering industry.
Our increasing momentum is underlined by over £500 million of 
significant new contract wins already secured in 2009. We have 
more work secured for 2009 at this point in the year than we did 
for 2008 at the comparable time last year. 
Whilst external macroeconomic events, including the fall in equity 
markets and interest rates, will have an impact on net interest, the 
business continues to perform strongly and we are on course to 
deliver the Board’ s expected operating result in 2009.
We remain focused on markets where there are significant  
spend commitments and, with a net cash balance approaching 
£150 million, we have the resources to continue to develop  
the business.
Our confidence in the future is reflected in the Board’ s 
recommendation to increase the total dividend for the year.

Dairy Crest produces and markets Cathedral City, the UK’s 
leading cheese brand, and the premium Davidstow cheddar 
brand. o ur world-class supply chain starts with milk 
supplied by nearly 400 farmers in the dairying heartlands 
of Cornwall and Devon. This top quality milk is made 
into cheddar cheese at our highly-automated creamery 
in Davidstow, Cornwall. The cheese then matures for an 
average of nearly a year at our purpose-built n uneaton 
facility before being cut, packed and distributed. We have a 
second packing site in Frome, Somerset, for more complex 
and innovative packaging.
 Whey is a by-product of the cheese making process. 
Historically, we produced sweet whey, to sell to a variety 
of food manufacturers. We now have a new facility at 
Davidstow producing demineralised whey and galacto-
oligosaccharide (‘Go S’), a lactose based prebiotic, both 
ingredients for infant formula, a high-growth, high-margin 
global market.

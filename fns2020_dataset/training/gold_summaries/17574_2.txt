Revenues	have	consistently	grown	since	 2003.	2006	increased	substantially	 because	of	the	success	of	the	Middle	 East	 operations	 and	 the	 continual	 growth	 of	the	UK	operations.	In	2007	we	have	 built	on	the	success	achieved	in	2006	 both	in	the	UK	and	the	Middle	East.	 O p e r a t i n g	p r o fi t	h a s	i n c r e a s e d	o v e r	t h e		 5	y e a r	p e r i o d .

Headcount	increased	steadily	over	the	 period	2003–2005	before	making	a	 substantial	increase	in	2006.	This	 aggressive	recruitment	has	continued	 	 in	2007	as	we	have	added	a	further	 	 37	staff	across	the	Group.	 Revenue	per	head	is	a	key	measure	of	 cost	control	and	margin	maintenance	 a s	s t a f fi n g	i s	t h e	s i n g l e	b i g g e s t	c o s t	t o	
the	Group.	The	steady	state	of	this	ratio	 is	testament	to	good	cost	control	and	 also	the	ability	of	the	Company	to	 generate	additional	revenues.	In	2007	 we	have	invested	in	our	sales	function	 across	the	Group.
Earnings	per	share	are	calculated	 	 b y	d i v i d i n g	t h e	p r o fi t	a t t r i b u t a b l e	t o	
shareholders	by	the	weighted	average	 number	of	shares	in	issue	in	the	period.
Earnings	per	share	grows	strongly,	albeit	 at	a	slower	rate	than	sales,	as	we	invest	 in	the	future	of	our	businesses.	 *	Based	on	year	end	headcount

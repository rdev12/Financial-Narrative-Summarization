Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
Business overview
Zotefoams is a diversified value-added 
plastics processor, utilising unique cellular 
materials technology in a variety of markets 
globally. Zotefoams manufactures block 
foams using high-pressure nitrogen gas 
technology, licenses intellectual property 
(‘IP’), sells related machinery and also 
processes foams for specific markets.  
The block foams business units compete 
primarily through the superior foam 
properties created by our technology, 
offering reduced environmental impact and 
a better safety and technical performance. 
This business has significant barriers to 
entry, including capital cost, know-how,  
user specifications and, in our HPP 
business, patents. Zotefoams’ block foams 
are sold, and often specified, under the 
AZOTE
®
 and ZOTEK
®
 brand names, which 
are well known in the industries we serve: 
automotive, aerospace, packaging, industrial 
parts, marine, building and construction, 
military and sports and leisure. Zotefoams 
also sells T-FIT
®
 (replacing the T-TUBES
®
 
brand) technical insulation, manufactured 
from ZOTEK
®
 foams, for pharmaceutical, 
semiconductor and biotech facilities. MuCell 
Extrusion LLC (‘MEL ’) licenses a patented 
process that creates ‘micro-bubbles’ in the 
core of plastic parts or products by injecting 
gas into them as they are manufactured. 
This produces a foamed core, bound by  
a solid skin into one integral material that 
seems indistinguishable from a solid 
product. Products using MEL technology 
can be designed to perform like solid plastic, 
but will typically use 15-20% less material, 
realising both cost and environmental 
benefits, by using inert carbon dioxide or 
nitrogen gas and reducing plastic content  
at source. MEL shares in the customers’ 
benefits by receiving a licence fee for IP  
and/or royalty on parts made.

Results
Zotefoams manages and reports its business 
in three main business units defined by 
product type: Polyolefin foams, HPP foams 
and MEL. Total Revenue increased by 11% to 
£54.44m (2014: £49.08m), with growth in all 
three segments and in all major geographies. 
Gross profit increased by 17% to £15.00m 
(2014: £12.84m excluding exceptional items) 
and our gross margin improved to 27.6% 
Our AZOTE
®
 business unit operates 
regionally across Europe, North America 
and Asia, while HPP and MEL are global 
operations. As our business develops we 
are creating new opportunities, such as our 
joint venture in China and, in 2016, the 
formation of Zotefoams Midwest LLC in 
Oklahoma, USA, which are extending our 
traditional business and moving us closer to 
key customers. These initiatives, operational 
in 2016, along with our major investment in 
capacity in Kentucky, USA, which is now 
expected to begin production in the first half 
of 2017, required significant investment in 
time and expertise from our senior 
management team over the past year. We 
see these initiatives as the start of a period 
of transformational organic growth of our 
business using our unique technologies, 
while building on our IT systems, operational 
capability and continued investment  
in people.

MATTE BLACK PLASTAZOTE
®
 
foam for luxury packaging: 
non-staining and odour free
Plastazote
®
 matte black polyethylene  
foam recently joined the AZOTE
®
 family.  
It is a strong, resilient, light foam which 
provides strength and durability for  
the most challenging and luxurious 
packaging applications.
Plastazote
®
 matte black is ideally suited  
as a component material in products 
requiring shock absorption and vibration 
dampening, and as a material for 
cushioning components in packaging 
applications. Its purity makes it the  
ideal choice when working in contact  
with precious metals and other high 
value goods.
Easily fabricated, completely odour free 
and impervious to most chemical agents, 
this foam offers excellent strength and a 
dark matte black finish, which is ideal for 
luxury packaging applications where 
quality, look and feel are paramount.

of 12 months of the year. Inventory levels  
of customers increased during the first part 
of the year, generating an overall demand  
in the market for our products in excess of 
normal supply, but declined later in the year, 
leading to a more stable demand situation. 
Zotefoams’ investment in manufacturing 
systems, efficiency and de-bottlenecking of 
capacity continued throughout the year and 
further capacity improvements are expected 
to be delivered from existing autoclaves as 
improvements in support services come  
on line in the first half of 2016. Input costs 
began the year at slightly lower levels than  
in 2014, however, by the end of the first 
quarter, the average euro price of our main 
raw material, Low Density Polyethylene 
(‘LDPE’), began to trend upward. While the 
price of crude oil, the source raw material for 
LDPE, has reduced significantly over the 
past 18 months, the price for LDPE has 
remained at a similar level for the past three 
years. The overall price for LDPE in the year 
was similar to 2014, but with the second six 
months of 2015 approximately 10% higher 
than the first six months.
Zotefoams’ AZOTE
®
 polyolefin foams are 
manufactured using our unique, high-
pressure, nitrogen gas process. Sheets  
of extruded plastic, in this case mainly 
low-density polyethylene and ethylene-vinyl 
acetate co-polymers, are processed through 
large pressure vessels known as autoclaves 
at temperatures up to 250 degrees 
Centigrade and pressure up to 670 bar, 
before being expanded into sheets of foam 
in a lower-pressure autoclave. The autoclave 
process allows foams to be as light as 
98.5% air by volume and lowers polymer 
usage for improved environmental impact. 
Our foams are consistent, closed cell (giving 
cushioning, very low water absorption and 
buoyancy), good insulators and can be 
processed in many different ways for a 
variety of end applications. Demand overall 
is driven by three main market trends: better 
use of resources, safety improvements and 
other performance benefits.
Total Revenue in Polyolefin foams increased 
by 8% to £43.61m (2014: £40.44m). Sales 
volumes increased by 10%, while foreign 
exchange rates were, in aggregate, 3% 
adverse, as a weaker euro was only partially 
offset by a stronger US dollar. The segment 
profit was £7.55m (2014: £5.99m), after the 
amortisation of acquired intangible items.
In the UK and Continental Europe, which 
accounts for 69% (2014: 72%) of AZOTE
®
 
polyolefin foams’ Total Revenue, sales 
volumes increased by 11%, while North 
America volumes grew by 2%. In Asia, 
where we operate a sales joint venture, sales 
volumes increased by 27% following a small 
decline the previous year. We see all areas 
offering scope for further sales growth in  
line with our stated objective of growing 
Polyolefin foams sales at twice the rate  
of global GDP. To support this global 
opportunity, we need to invest in capacity 
and our approach to this is described in 
more detail in the “investment” section of  
the report.
In 2015 we began the year very strongly, 
with an order book that was partly a result  
of delayed European shipments from late in 
2014. Sales volumes throughout the year 
remained strong, with sales records in 8 out

MuCell partners with Dow  
on innovative microfoaming 
technology 
In an exclusive collaboration, MuCell 
Extrusion LLC partnered with Dow to 
launch an innovative microfoaming 
technology for the packaging industry in 
Latin America.
Dow is working with MuCell and mutual 
customers in Latin America to produce 
foamed films that replace solid films. 
Foaming films is an excellent route to more 
sustainable packaging by allowing the 
production of more units with the same 
amount of raw material, thus resulting in 
lower carbon emissions.
Some of the key benefits of the 
microfoaming technology include:
• Improved packaging performance such 
as superior sealing integrity and abuse 
resistance.
• Differentiated optical properties that 
deliver characteristics of premium 
packaging.
• A superior environment profile 
compared to traditional packaging.
Dow has played an instrumental role in 
helping MuCell develop five new foamed 
film customers in Latin America over the 
past year with substantial potential for the 
reduction of carbon emissions.

The High-Performance Products (‘HPP’) 
business unit covers our ZOTEK
®
 block 
foams as well as the recently rebranded 
T-FIT® technical insulation. ZOTEK
®
 
products use the same proprietary autoclave 
technology as our AZOTE
®
 polyolefin foams 
but are manufactured from PVDF 
fluoropolymer, nylon or PEBA, generating  
a uniqueness based on the combination  
of the original polymer attributes and our 
foaming process. ZOTEK
®
 F fluoropolymer 
foams are inherently fire and chemical 
resistant, ZOTEK
®
 N nylon foams are  
tough and can operate in very high 
temperature environments, while ZOTEK
®
 
PEBA foams have excellent kinetic energy 
management properties. All of these foams 
are light weight, moisture resistant and  
good insulators.
HPP sales increased by 25% in the year to 
£8.27m (2014: £6.61m) and now represent 
15% of Group Revenue. Within HPP the 
largest market is aviation, where growth is 
expected as a result of new applications 
(increased content per aeroplane) and an 
increase in the build rate of aeroplanes. 
Typical aviation applications are in window 
gaskets, air ducts, high-end seats, seals and 
gaskets. Following a strong performance in 
2014, in which we delivered a near doubling 
of revenue from T-FIT
®
 insulation products, 
2015 sales from T-FIT
®
 increased by 2%, 
which was below our expectations. This was 
due mainly to the timing of projects in the 
major application of cleanrooms insulation 
for pharmaceutical, biotech and 
semiconductor manufacture in China,  
India and the rest of Asia. 
I am pleased to report that indications  
are positive for future growth in T-FIT
®
, 
supported by our joint venture to 
manufacture and sell these products in 
China, which we expect to be operational  
by the end of the first half of 2016.
The HPP segment reported a profit of 
£0.82m (2014: £1.02m), with sales growth 
offset by a planned higher investment of 
resource in sales, development and supply 
chain surety to support future opportunities. 
With these additional resources we have 
also made considerable progress in other 
markets such as industrial, automotive and 
sports and leisure, which we believe have 
excellent potential for future growth but may 
take longer to realise.

MEL ’s business model is to develop and 
license IP and share in the savings or 
benefits of the licensee through a royalty 
and/or licence fee. The MuCell
®
 extrusion 
technology is delivered through a gas 
injection system, which is sold to customers, 
often with other associated equipment and 
engineering support, to retrofit their existing 
extruders. Following product development 
and end-user validation the customers will 
manufacture their products using our 
technology and pay us licence fees and/or 
royalties. MEL revenue, therefore, comes 
from two main sources: initial set-up 
(engineering and equipment sales) and 
operation (licence fees and/or royalties). 
MEL ’s IP comprises a significant body of 
patents and know-how in gas injection 
methods and apparatus, product 
performance, additives, operating systems, 
die and screw design, etc. The main target 
market for MEL is consumer packaging, 
where production volumes are large and 
developments are scalable across 
geographic and product markets.

 PEBA USED IN INSOLE FOR PUMA’S INNOVATIVE EVOSPEED SL
PUMA is one of the world’s 
leading Sports Brands, 
designing, developing, selling 
and marketing footwear, apparel 
and accessories. For over 65 
years, PUMA has established  
a history of making fast product 
designs for the fastest athletes 
on the planet.
Light and fast have become lighter and 
faster with the introduction in June 2015  
of PUMA’s innovative football boot, the 
evoSPEED SL. PUMA’s lightest yet match 
boot was designed to give footballers a 
new game advantage enhancing speed 
and agility. 
ZOTEK
®
 PEBA contributed to the radical 
weight reduction PUMA achieved with the 
evoSPEED SL boot, delivering significant 
performance benefits when combined with 
other innovative materials. The ZOTEK 
PEBA insole provided the ultimate in 
lightweight and high energy return.
ZOTEK
®
 PEBA foam delivers performance 
over a wide temperature range, right down 
to -40ºC. The combination of high energy 
return and low flex fatigue delivers 
performance way beyond traditional 
closed cell foams, and with none of the 
volatile chemicals.
Some of the world’s best players, including 
Sergio Agüero, Marco Reus, Radamel 
Falcao, Marco Verratti, Antoine Griezmann 
and many more have worn the boot.
Marco Reus commented; 
“ This new boot is a real change to what  
we have been wearing before, it actually 
looks and feels like a totally new product. 
They are so light, you can almost not feel 
them, and still I feel they give me exactly 
that support I need to have from a boot. 
This is a whole new direction of  
boot design.”

MEL Total Revenue increased 25% to 
£2.62m (2014: £2.09m), driven by more 
favourable US dollar exchange rates and a 
47% increase in Equipment and Engineering 
sales, from £1.16m to £1.70m, as licensees 
convert their extrusion lines to use our 
technology. Licence and Royalty payments 
were at a similar level to the previous year, 
with underlying growth distorted by a 
one-off limited exclusivity licence fee in 2014. 
MEL is still an early stage growth business 
and our key performance measures include 
increasing the installed base at customers 
and further developing our licensable 
technology. Over the past 18 months we 
have delivered significant improvements in 
capital efficiency of line conversions from 
transfer mixer technology and the proven 
use of satellite units. Transfer mixers 
minimise operational downtime and cost 
when converting an extruder to MuCell
®
 
technology, while satellite units allow more 
than one extruder to be run from a MuCell 
extrusion gas system at a minimal marginal 
cost. Improved conversion costs for 
customers are one reason why equipment 
revenues grew by 47% compared to 2014, 
representing 36 units (2014: 20 units), while 
the total installed base at customers is now 
88 units (2014: 52 units), an increase of 69%. 
Approximately half of these units are now in 
operational use at customers and are 
generating revenue, while we anticipate that 
the majority of the remaining units will be 
commissioned for commercial use within 
6-12 months. Following sale, commissioning 
and commercial ramp up, the value 
delivered from our strategy of increasing the 
installed base will be delivered over the life  
of our commercial contracts, which are 
typically 10-12 years.
Further development of IP remains a core 
activity for the MEL business unit and, 
pleasingly during 2015, improvements in 
processing certain polymers, additive 
technology as well as machinery 
modifications were developed and  
are factors which will contribute to our  
future success.
The MEL segment result was a loss (after 
amortisation costs associated with acquired 
intangible assets) of £0.80m (2014: loss of 
£0.41m), reflecting the increased investment 
made in people and IP development in MEL. 
Before amortisation costs on acquired 
intangible assets, the loss was £0.50m 
(2014: loss of £0.10m).

range of high-performance 
closed-cell foam insulation 
products are anticipated to 
commence in the second  
quarter of 2016.
T-FIT

 will be manufactured and sold 
through the Company’s joint-venture 
company, KunShan ZOTEK King Lai, 
established with King Lai Group (‘King Lai’) 
in March 2015. T-FIT

Investment
Zotefoams’ core autoclave technology is 
used in both our AZOTE
®
 and ZOTEK
®
 block 
foam manufacture. The overall need to 
increase capacity is currently driven by our 
demand expectations for AZOTE
®
 polyolefin 
foams, which account for over 95% of 
production volumes. Wherever possible,  
we seek capacity enhancements through 
measures such as improving efficiency, 
investing in services to increase cycle times, 
planning improvements etc. However, in 
2014, we decided that the timing was right 
to begin the next phase of investment in a 
new high-pressure autoclave and to site this 
vessel in our facility in Kentucky, USA. 
Zotefoams Inc, in Kentucky, has operated 
low-pressure autoclave technology, for the 
final expansion of intermediate material, 
since 2001 and demand from the North 
American market will fill a new vessel 
capacity almost immediately, releasing 
capacity from the UK to service demand 
elsewhere. The investment programme was 
originally scheduled to commission in the 
second half of 2016, but will now more likely 
be the first half of 2017, due to a quality 
problems identified by the autoclave supplier 
requiring them to reschedule delivery of  
the vessel. The other components of the 
programme are running to schedule: a 
building extension, extrusion capability 
including feed systems, extruders and 
ovens, plant services including heating 
nitrogen gas to over 250 degrees Centigrade 
and systems to pressurise an autoclave with 
this superheated gas at pressures more 
than 300 times the pressure of a standard 
car tyre, not to mention sourcing appropriate 
raw materials, implementing an IT system 
and hiring and training a technically 
competent workforce. With this delay we 
have examined the need for capacity and 
expect the improvements made in Croydon 
during 2015, including some additional items 
to be brought on line during 2016, to be 
sufficient to meet our demand needs until 
mid-2017. At our Croydon site we are 
planning further investment in low-pressure 
autoclaves and extrusion, specifically 
designed for ZOTEK
®
 foams, as well as 
commissioning additional laboratory space 
for our technical and quality departments.
In Asia, our joint venture with King Lai Group 
is scheduled to begin production in the first 
half of 2016 and will initially make product  
for cleanroom insulation, where the largest 
market opportunities are China and India. 
The investment needed is relatively modest, 
with machines to heat and mould our 
ZOTEK
®
 foams to the specific shapes 
needed. In addition to manufacturing we  
will expand our sales team dedicated to the 
T-FIT
®
 advanced insulation products and, 
with the benefit of local manufacture and 
supply, expect this business to show strong 
growth over the coming years. In AZOTE
®
 
polyolefin foams we currently have a 50:50 
sales joint venture agreement with INOAC 
Corporation in Japan, with the plan to  
begin local manufacturing for the Asian 
market when sales volumes reach an 
appropriate level.
Strategy and objectives
Zotefoams’ strategy is to expand through a 
combination of profitable organic growth of 
our Polyolefin and HPP foams businesses, 
new customers for our MEL technology 
licensing business, and through 
partnerships or acquisitions in related 
technologies, products or markets.
Our stated objectives are:
• Sales growth in our Polyolefin business to 
exceed twice the average rate of global 
GDP growth.
• Develop a HPP portfolio and MEL 
customer base to deliver enhanced 
margins.
• Improve our operating margins.
• Improve our return on capital employed.
Performance against these objectives was 
as follows:
• Sales of Polyolefin foams increased  
by 8%.
• HPP sales grew by 25% and MEL sales 
grew by 25%.
In both business units we continue to invest 
further in resources to deliver growth, with  
a clear understanding of the inherent profit 
potential being higher than the current 
Group operating margins. These business 
units now account for 20% of Total Revenue, 
up from 18% in 2014.
• Group operating margins before 
exceptional items increased to 11.6% 
(2014: 11.4%).
• Pre-tax return on average capital 
employed, excluding acquired intangible 
assets and their amortisation costs, 
decreased to 14.4% (2014: 14.7%). Levels 
of capital employed will continue to 
increase with the strategically significant 
investment in our Kentucky, USA, site, 
planned to commission in 2017. We 
expect the return on capital to reflect this 
until the benefit of this investment can  
be realised.

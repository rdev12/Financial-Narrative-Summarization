 Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc 2
Chairman’s Statement
The results for the financial year ended 30 September 2005
reflect a continuation of the trends seen at the half year
with turnover 120% ahead of the previous financial year, a
record for Cobra of £7.7m (2004: £3.5m). The contracted
forward order book for the financial year 2006 currently
stands at £5.0m (Jan 2005: £2.7m). 
In 2005 Cobra generated £0.6m cash from operations (2004:
£2.0m outflow), a loss before tax of £0.4m (2004: £2.3m) and
after tax of £0.3m (2004: £2.4m loss). In the second half of
the financial year the Group traded profitably and was cash
generative. Cash at bank (inc short term deposits) at the end
of the financial year stood at £3.0m (2004: £3.2m), up from
£2.6m as at 31 March 2005, despite a further £0.8m of
capital investment in the year (2004: £3.2m).
This improvement came from our focus on North America,
which provided 79% of turnover (2004: 31%) reflecting the
region’s dominant position in the global biotechnology
market. Further investment in business development is
underway to increase Cobra’s penetration of this vitally
important market. Investment in manufacturing staff is also
ongoing to underpin the growing forward order book with
increased headcount at both the Keele and Oxford facilities.
The recruitment of internationally experienced senior
managers has also been completed to ensure that the
expanding capability is directed to meet the highest
regulatory standards in both the US and the EU.
We are also in discussions with two major customers
concerning their longer term requirements for Phase III
materials and commercial supply, which could have a direct
bearing on the scale and shape of any new capacity that
may become necessary, and in this regard facilities have
been identified in both Europe and North America. We
continue to review opportunities to expand our service
offering and a thorough review of potential partners in
Europe and North America is nearing completion.
During the year the Executive Directors have undertaken a
comprehensive risk assessment exercise. The allocation of
responsibility for each risk and its management is now
underway. A regular risk review will form part of the annual
cycle of governance procedures. 
Cobra has made a strong recovery in response to the
challenges faced in 2004, leading to a profit in the second
half of 2005. The Group has demonstrated its resilience,
flexibility and professionalism by widening its range of
services, increasing penetration of the North American
market and positioning itself to benefit from the growth in
demand for biopharmaceuticals and the contributions of all
employees in achieving this outcome are fully recognised. 
Cobra is now poised to move into the next stage of its
development as a profitable and leading provider of
specialist biomanufacturing services to the global
marketplace, based upon longer term supply agreements
with customers and agreements for products moving into
late stage development.

“This has been a strong year. We continue to execute on our strategy with precision and focus, and we are seeing the 
rewards.  
 
Our financial performance was robust, and our resilience as a global business is becoming more evident. Our clients 
are increasingly seeing the benefit we bring to their customers, and in turn their own profitability.  
 
We have continued to develop the business this year as we continued to focus on investment, building and improving 
our business, and finding new ways to support the digital customer journey. Our third strategic acquisition has 
opened up many more exciting opportunities, as well as securing our position as one of the very largest ticket 
businesses globally.   
 
I am excited by where we are as a business, and I see enormous growth opportunities in our future. I look forward to 
reporting more positive news for our company through the current year.”

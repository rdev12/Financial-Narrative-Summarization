 3 Overview
Anite reported strong growth in the  
year and made good progress in all 
three businesses
Clay Brendish
Chairman’s statement
Introduction
I am pleased to report a strong financial performance for the year 
ended 30 April 2011, compared with a relatively weak result last 
year. This performance was driven by significant revenue growth in 
our Wireless division, which resulted in strong overall profit growth 
above that expected by the Board at the start of the year.
Handset Testing reported a strong finish to the year, with LTE (4G)
products accounting for 34% of Handset Testing revenue compared 
with 12% in the previous financial year.
Network Testing had a good result benefiting from a recovery in 
customer spending and upgrades to customer networks.
Travel performed slightly below the Board’s original expectations. 
However, profitability remains robust and tangible operational progress 
was made during the year. This culminated in the signing of a major 
contract with TUI Travel PLC and an increased closing order book.
Second-half milestones
Two important milestones were achieved during the second half.
First, in January 2011, Anite acquired the Invex network test and 
measurement product line, which included two products that 
significantly widen our network testing product range in readiness 
for LTE roll-outs in future years.
Second, in April 2011, Anite signed a multi-year contract with  
TUI Travel PLC to implement Anite’s @comRes reservation system  
in TUI’s UK and Ireland division.
Strategy and progress
We continue to make good progress with our strategy to position Anite 
as a global leader in Wireless test software, and to take advantage of 
the opportunities that will emerge from the development and roll-out 
of LTE technology. For the year, our Wireless revenue advanced and 
contributed 79% of Anite’s total revenue (2010: 71%).
The Board believes that Wireless operates in a long-term growth 
market, which has high barriers to entry and relatively few major 
competitors. This enables the business to generate good profit 
margins and returns on investments.
In Travel, our strategy is to increase the business’s long-term value  
as it transitions between legacy and new products. To achieve this, 
we will continue to strengthen and improve its market position  
by expanding the customer base and managing the migration of 
existing customers to our new product, @comRes, thus increasing 
recurring maintenance revenue.
Overall, the Board is committed to maintaining market leadership 
through continued investment in our R&D programmes.
It is the Board’s intention that the Group retains a strong financial 
position to provide financial flexibility.

Results summary
The Group’s results were well ahead of last year and continue  
to demonstrate the underlying strength and profitability of our 
divisions: an adjusted operating margin of 22% (2010: 14%) was 
reported by the Wireless division as a whole and 21% (2010: 24%) 
by the Travel division.
Handset Testing benefited from improved market conditions, 
recovery in customer spending in 3G and growth in LTE orders  
in line with the progress of the technology. This produced a result 
substantially ahead of last year.
Network Testing also benefited from improved market conditions, 
which led to a particularly strong first half result.
Travel reported reduced licence revenue compared with last year, 
leading to a fall in revenue and profit.
Overall Group adjusted operating profit was up 48% to £17.6m 
(2010: £11.9m) on revenue up 19% at £93.7m (2010: £78.8m).
Adjusted basic earnings per share were up 67% to 4.0p (2010: 2.4p).
The year end financial position was robust. Net cash as at 30 April 
2011 was £27 .7m (31 October 2010: net cash of £28.4m). The reported 
level of net cash is before taking account of the liability on the currency 
swap which, as previously announced, will be settled on 31 October 
2011 for £21.6m. The year end closing net cash is also stated after  
a £5.9m impact in the second half for shares purchased for the 
Employee Benefit Trust and for the cost of the acquisition of the 
Invex product line.
Dividend 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 0.735p per share 
(2010: 0.65p), representing a 13% increase. The dividend will be paid 
on 25 October 2011 to shareholders on the register at 16 September 
2011. This increase reflects the Board’s intention to maintain a 
progressive dividend policy, the dividend having been held last year 
despite reduced earnings.
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all employees for their 
contribution, hard work and support during the period.
Summary and outlook 
Anite reported strong growth in the year and made good progress  
in all three businesses.
Travel is now in its best shape for a number of years after a period  
of declining profits. It has a strong order book and sales pipeline.  
By the end of the current year, we expect it to be demonstrating  
the path to renewed growth from its robust and profitable core.
2011 saw improved financial performance within the Wireless 
division, driven by both customer spending recovery and organic 
business growth. We believe the recovery phase is complete and 
that its 2012 results will be driven by business growth alone. 
Wireless is better positioned to take advantage of its existing  
and new markets than in the past and we believe that the LTE 
opportunity is also likely to be deeper and longer-lasting than 
previous technologies.
For 2012 overall, we believe that there are good growth prospects 
led by the Wireless division. The Group has made an encouraging 
start to the new financial year. We remain optimistic about Anite’s 
future progress.

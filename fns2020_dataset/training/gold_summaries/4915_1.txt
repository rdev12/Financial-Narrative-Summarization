 Chief Executive’s Report
INTRODUCTION
2004 was another very successful year for your
Company with sales reaching record levels both 
system-wide and at store level. Profitability also 
continued to grow very strongly as the benefits of our
high operational gearing became still more apparent.
Whilst we opened fewer new stores in 2004 than in
2003, our priority remains to only open in the right
locations with the right operators, and this we achieved.
Our strong cash generation continued and, as 
indicated in previous statements, this will be returned
to shareholders as long as it does not impact on the
growth of the business. As a result, the share buy
back programme was commenced during 2004 and 
it is proposed to significantly increase the dividend
payment for the year. 
Our continuing success results from a strong and 
talented management team who have an in-depth
understanding of the market in which we operate.
Their innovative approach has helped to further
strengthen our leadership position. 
SYSTEM SALES
System sales, which are the sales of all stores in the
Domino’s system in the UK and Republic of Ireland,
rose by 22.5% to £174.3m (2003: £142.3m) in the 
53 weeks ended 2 January 2005. Like-for-like sales 
in the 268 stores open for more than twelve months
grew by 6.6% (2003: 7.4%). 
In 2005 Domino’s Pizza celebrates 20 years in the UK
market. In the last five years alone, total system sales
have grown by over 174.5% from £63.5m in 1999 to
£174.3m in 2004. This is an annual compound growth
rate of 22.4%. 
SYSTEM EXPANSION AND MANAGING GROWTH
In 2004 we opened 40 new stores (2003: 50) and
closed one (2003: one). As a result, the year-end store
count in the UK and Ireland increased to 357 stores
(2003: 318). 
Forty new stores in 2004 was, however, a 
disappointment as we had set ourselves an internal
target to repeat the 50 new store openings we
achieved in 2003. There were two reasons for the
shortfall. Firstly, as foreshadowed in my Interim 
Statement, uncertainty arising from long-awaited
changes in the planning Use Classes Order, which 
will result in Domino’s Pizza stores requiring A5
(rather than A3) class, has caused delays in our
obtaining the necessary consents. 
The legislation that gave rise to these changes was
announced in early 2004 but, after an extraordinary
delay, it has only recently been confirmed that the new
classes system will come into effect on 21 April 2005.
Whilst we do not welcome the still stricter planning
controls, we hope the elimination of uncertainty will
allow the planning process to become more predictable.
It is the strategy of the Company to expand the system
as quickly as possible. We will not however, do this at
any price and the quality of the franchisees that operate
new stores continues to be of paramount importance. 
This highly selective approach to expansion is the 
second reason for our opening fewer stores in 2004
than in the previous year. During 2004, although we
saw another record number of applications from
potential new franchisees, aided by our winning the
British Franchise Association Franchisor of the Year
award, there remained a lack of suitable franchisees
in regions that we have identified for expansion and
where we have secured new sites. We, therefore,
declined to open a number of stores where there 
was neither a new franchisee of the standard required
nor an existing franchisee ready to operate multiple
stores. I am pleased to report that most of these sites
have now opened or are scheduled to open in the
first quarter of 2005 with franchisees who will be a
credit to the system. 
TRADING RESULTS 
Group turnover, which includes the sales generated by
the Group from royalties, fees on new store openings,
food sales and rental income, as well as the turnover
of corporately owned and operated stores, grew by
20.5% to £74.2m (2003: £61.6m). 
Group operating profit grew by 53.2% to £9.1m
(2003: £6.0m) although there was an exceptional
charge of £532,000 in 2003 related to a tender offer
and the establishment of an Employee Benefit Trust
(“EBT”). Excluding this, Group operating profit grew
by 40.6%. During 2004 the Group incurred a loss 
on the sale of fixed assets of £47,000 compared 
with a profit of £775,000 in the previous year, almost
all of which related to corporate store disposals in
both years.

Domino’s is a people business before it’s a pizza delivery
business and our stores employ over 8,000 team members.
It’s up to these diverse and dedicated people to take great
care of our customers and uphold the high standards
that make us the pizza delivery leaders. That’s why we
invest in attracting, training and retaining the very best.

Delivering a great-tasting, piping-hot pizza on time relies
on three things – ingredients, expertise and innovation. 
Our team of foodies follow the seasons around the world
to source the best ingredients and we make our own fresh
dough balls too. Skilled pizza experts handcraft every single
pizza while cutting edge ordering and delivery technology
enables us to focus every minute on preparing high quality
food. Our food may arrive fast but it’s not fast food!

Interest paid rose to £0.4m (2003: £0.3m) as the
result of a full year interest charge on the EBT. Net
interest costs are covered 33.7 times by operating
profits (2003: 29.3 times). After taking account of
these items, profit before tax was up 34.9% to 
£8.8m from £6.5m. 
The tax charge fell from 30% to 23% principally as 
a result of the non-recurrence of the tax effect of the
previous year’s store disposals; the relief available 
on the rollover of capital gains made in earlier years
and the tax relief available to the Company on the
exercise of employee options. As a result of the
reduced tax charge, profits after tax were up 47.7%
to £6.7m (2003: £4.6m).
EARNINGS PER SHARE AND DIVIDEND 
Basic earnings per share were up 46.7% to 13.23
pence from 9.02 pence. Diluted earnings per share
increased by 51.0% to 12.67 pence from 8.39 pence.
As a result of the strong cash generation during the
year, the Board is pleased to recommend a further
significant increase in the dividend payment which, 
if approved, will give a final dividend of 3.05 pence
per share (2003: 2.18 pence per share). This would
give a total dividend for the year of 5.25 pence per
share, a 50.0% increase over the 3.50 pence per share
declared for 2003. The proposed dividend is 2.5 times
covered by profits after tax (2003: 2.6 times).
Subject to shareholders’ approval the final dividend
will be payable on 29 April 2005 to shareholders on
the register on 15 April 2005.
CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET 
2004 has been another encouraging year in terms 
of our balance sheet and cash flows. Net cash inflow
from operating activities reached £9.9m, up from
£8.0m in 2003. This increase was attributable in the
main to the higher operating profits which were
£3.1m up on 2003.
The Group continues to generate increasingly strong
cash flows and the model is proving to be even more
robust as profitability grows and capital expenditure
levels have reduced now that the infrastructure is in
place. At the year-end, the Group had cash on hand 
of £4.8m (2003: £3.7m). The increase in cash on 
hand this year was even more reassuring given the
underlying cash flows. During 2004 we spent £2.1m
more than last year on fixed assets, primarily due to
the purchase of the long leasehold interest of the
commissary in Naas. Furthermore, we bought back
shares at a cost of £1.6m, had higher outflows of
£0.6m in tax and £0.9m in dividends but still increased
cash balances by £1.1m. 
During the year options over 2.4m shares were 
exercised generating a cash inflow of £1.1m 
(2003: £1.0m). 
Towards the end of the year, the Employee Benefit
Trust (“EBT”) granted further reversionary interests 
in 600,000 of the Company’s shares which were 
purchased by the EBT at a cost of £1.2m. This was
financed by a further bank loan of £1.2m guaranteed
by the Company. The EBT now holds a total of
3,599,921 shares financed by the bank loan of 
£6.4m (2003: £5.2m). The Company has adopted 
the accounting treatment of UITF 38, Accounting 
for ESOP Trusts. The full cost of the shares has 
been deducted from shareholders’ funds, with the
debt being consolidated into the Group’s balance sheet.
During the year DP Capital extended the leasing 
support provided to franchisees for the fit-out of 
new stores and the refit of existing stores, with new
advances of £0.9m. After repayments, the balance
outstanding at the year-end from this activity was
£2.9m (2003: £3.1m). These facilities are financed by
a limited recourse loan facility and the amount drawn
down at the year-end stood at £2.6m (2003: £2.7m).
At the year-end, the Group had consolidated debt 
of £9.0m (2003: £8.0m) all of which related to the
EBT loan and financing for DP Capital referred to
above. After taking into account cash balances, 
net borrowings at the year-end stood at £4.2m 
(2003: £4.2m) representing 31.7% (2003: 39.7%) 
of shareholders’ funds.
Although adoption of IFRS will only be mandatory for
AIM listed companies from 2007, we have already
made a preliminary assessment of the impact on the
Group. Our evaluation has highlighted that the adoption
of IFRS is not expected to have any significant impact
on the Group’s reported results.

CORPORATE STORES
In recent years we have been exploring different
structures to enable our shareholders to benefit 
from the significant profitability and exceptional
returns on capital that can be obtained from a well-run
Domino’s Pizza store. Past experience has shown us
that corporate ownership can dull the entrepreneurial
spirit that is essential to that success, and impose
overheads, that in a smaller business, might be 
avoided. We have, therefore, been exploring a 
number of alternatives, including joint ventures, to
see if the partnership of corporate strength and the
entrepreneurialism of a franchisee who has invested his
or her own money into the business can reproduce
the success experienced by so many of our franchisees.
The results to date from our current joint ventures
have been encouraging and, as a result, we have
determined to incorporate most of the existing 
corporate stores into joint ventures. 
We will attempt to establish as many of the 
joint ventures as possible using third party debt 
funding so that your Company’s role will be that 
of an equity partner. This will enable us to maximise
our returns and obtain the return of much of the 
capital previously invested. This will then become
available for reinvestment in the core business or
returned to shareholders.
LEADING THE MARKET
In 2004, the take-away and home-delivered food 
market in the UK was estimated by Mintel to be worth
£5.2bn, of which home delivery now constitutes 24%.
The total value of the home delivered food market in
the UK has increased in value by 62% since 1999 and
is now estimated to be around £1.2bn. Pizza currently
accounts for 43% of the home delivered food market
and we estimate that Domino’s can claim to deliver
approximately one in ten home delivered meals in 
the UK.
Research suggests that the home delivery market 
will be worth in excess of £1.8bn by 2009 and this
growth will be driven by continued pressure on 
consumers’ time coupled with increasing access to
convenient technologies that offer online, interactive
and SMS ordering of home delivered food.
There has been considerable recent debate on the
issue of healthy eating which has prompted us to
review our responsibilities in this area. We believe
that we have a role to play in supporting Government
efforts to increase public health and awareness of
nutritional issues. Your Company believes that its main
responsibility is to provide customers with high quality
food, about which they can access full information,
and provide a menu which includes options to suit 
different lifestyles and dietary needs. The introduction
in 2004 of reduced fat cheese, ‘Delight’ mozzarella, 
is a demonstration of this approach in action and 
we will continue to reinforce our commitment in
these areas. 
Through constant and close monitoring of the world in
which we operate, and through innovation and practical
changes that benefit our customers, I am confident
that Domino’s Pizza will continue to strengthen its
leadership of the home delivered food market.
BUILDING THE BRAND 
Brand-building activity continued to be an important
focus in 2004, both externally to customers and 
internally to our own people.
The strength of our National Advertising Fund was
leveraged with creative, high impact and closely 
targeted campaigns throughout the year, culminating
in a highly successful launch for our new gourmet pizza,
Double Decadence™. These campaigns benefited
from the continued support of our sponsorship of 
The Simpsons on Sky One which ensures our brand
has a continuous presence in homes across the UK
and Ireland at peak pizza-ordering time.
Direct mail and local store marketing, which includes
the distribution of over 150 million menus each 
year, are mainstays of our marketing activity and 
are complemented by the efforts of our franchisees
to foster local loyalty through positive community 
relations campaigns.
Our e-commerce platforms go from strength to
strength with sales in 2004 ahead by 41% on the
prior year. Sales through the internet and interactive
TV accounted for 5.2% of sales in the UK (2003: 4.5%).

The first-mover advantage we enjoyed after becoming the
first pizza delivery company in the world to offer nationwide
online and interactive TV ordering still pays dividends. With
so much added convenience for customers, rapid growth in
our e-commerce sales comes as no surprise. Our updated
website (www.dominos.co.uk) launched in 2004, enabling
customers to order pizza in seconds and ordering from us
through Sky Active requires a few clicks on a remote control!

A top priority for Domino’s Pizza is to deliver more than
just great-tasting pizza to the communities we serve. 
We do this in a number of ways – through sympathetic
store design, responsible operations and support for
local charities and groups. Our franchisees understand
that, at the heart of a successful Domino’s business,
there is a successful relationship with the community.

CURRENT TRADING AND PROSPECTS 
Trading in the first six weeks of the current year has
got off to a good start with like-for-like sales up 6.6%.
In the same period, e-commerce sales are 49% ahead
of last year. Our store opening programme is also well
on track to achieve our targets. 
Our strategy remains the roll-out of new stores and
the growth of like-for-like sales, whilst maintaining
tight control of overheads. Achievement of this 
strategy will allow us to generate significant amounts
of cash which, in the absence of any business need,
will be returned to shareholders. We have made a
promising start to 2005 in the achievement of all
these objectives and, therefore, look forward to the
year with confidence. 
CONCLUSION AND THANKS
At the heart of your Company’s success is our 
highly-focused approach – the delivery of hot, high
quality pizza on time. Fulfilling this simple promise
every day is a dedicated team of corporate and 
in-store team members to whom I offer my thanks
and respect.
In particular, I should like to thank our franchisees.
These men and women are the engine of our 
organisation and their enterprise, enthusiasm and
round-the-clock dedication sets the pace for the 
rest of our business.

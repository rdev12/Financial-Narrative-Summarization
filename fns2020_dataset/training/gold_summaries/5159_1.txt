Chief Executive Officer
Eclectic Bar Group plc (the Group), is a leading operator 
of 23 (21 at the end of the financial year) premium bars 
located in major towns and cities across the UK. 
The Group trades across its estate under a variety of 
concepts including Embargo Republica, Lola Lo, Sakura, 
Po Na Na, Fez Club, Lowlander and Coalition. The Group 
predominantly targets a customer base of sophisticated 
students midweek and stylish over 21s and professionals 
at the weekend. The Group focuses on delivering added 
value for its customers, with premium product ranges, 
high quality music and entertainment and a 
commitment to high service standards. 
Eclectic Bar Group plc began trading on 19 November 
2013, and was formed to acquire all the share capital  
of Eclectic Bars Limited, in a share for share exchange. 
On 28 November, Eclectic Bar Group plc listed on AIM,  
a part of the London Stock Exchange. The Group raised 
£10.5 million in new equity, which was used to pay costs 
of £1.4 million (£0.8 million of costs were directly related 
to the issue of new shares and £0.6 million to the cost  
of listing and the reorganisation) and to repay the 
shareholder loan and interest of £7.4 million, leaving  
£1.7 million in cash for the Group to fund organic growth 
prospects and the acquisition of new sites and small 
groups of sites.
The Group’s strategy
The primary expected avenue of growth for the Group 
over the coming years is through the acquisition and 
development of new sites and small groups of sites 
together with a new focus on driving further food 
revenues into the bar estate. 
Eclectic’s business platform provides the perfect 
framework for the variety of venues that the Group owns. 
This variety in our businesses enables us to pick the right 
concept for the location and community within which  
it is situated, whilst maintaining the Group’s focus on  
a premium customer base and standardisation of 
processes and supply.
It is anticipated that the majority of new sites will be in 
major cities and towns where there is also a university 
population. The Group targets a 30 percent EBITDA 
return on new acquisitions and 25 percent on 
redevelopments of existing sites in the first 12 months 
post-acquisition or re-development. The Group is 
targeting the addition to its portfolio of two to three  
new sites per annum, and currently has a strong pipeline 
in place. 
The Group finances its new acquisitions and 
developments with cash generated from operating 
activities and bank funding as appropriate.
Eclectic’s estate has a national geographic spread in 
key university cities and towns which provide a vibrant 
night time economy and the demographics to support 
premium bars.

Review of The Group’s activities during the year
The estate has continued to be developed during the 
reporting period. Eclectic acquired 4 new venues and 
carried out the refit of one existing site:
•	 	 C o a l i t i o n 	 B a r 	 i n 	 B r i g h t o n, Eclectic’s 18th site, was 
acquired in October 2013. Located in the Kings Road 
Arches on the sea front, the venue has a large outside 
terrace on the beach, a 24 hour licence and a 
capacity of 600. It is open five nights a week, and 
regularly hosts live music events and headline DJ acts. 
The enviable location coupled with the large beach 
terrace gives great opportunities for food, drinks  
and events. 
•	 	 C o y o t e 	 W i l d 	 i n 	 D e r b y, the Group’s 19th venue, was also 
acquired in October 2013. This freehold site is a listed 
building on three floors, located in Derby city centre. 
This has been converted into The Group’s Lola Lo brand 
and opened in April 2014. The traditional Lola Lo music 
mix of credible club classics and contemporary beats 
provides night-time entertainment, along with regular 
club nights and live performances. The introduction of 
the “Island Grill” menu is typically Tiki and encourages 
early evening diners to the venue.
•	 	 M a n ch es t e r 	 D e a n sg a t e 	 L ock s, Eclectic’s 20th site, 
opened as a Lola Lo in the middle of December on the 
same stretch as Sakura (which opened on the Locks  
in October 2010). The 560 capacity venue is on three 
levels and includes three bars and two DJ booths, 
together with quirky features such as a “dress up box” 
in the high energy area on the lower ground floor and 
the first shop selling branded T-shirts and all things Tiki 
– puffer-fish lampshades, books and the brand’s 
highly-desirable signature Tiki mugs. This venue offers 
food from the “Island Grill” menu featuring a similar 
food offering to Derby. 
•	 	 M a d a m e 	 G e i s h a 	 i n 	 B r i g h t o n was acquired in March 
2013, and was re-launched at the end of March 2014, 
showcasing Eclectic’s newest “speakeasy” concept, 
Dirty Blonde. The external appearance of the business 
appears as a pawnbroker’s shop behind which is  
two floors of bars and booth seating for drinking and 
casual dining. The food offering incorporates dishes 
from the five boroughs of New York together with an 
extensive range of spirits, champagnes, wines and 
beers on offer. 
•	 	 L o w l a n d e r 	 G r a n d 	 Ca f é bar and brasserie in London’s 
Covent Garden, was acquired at the end of March 
2014. Lowlander is a Belgian Grand Café providing an 
all-day offer with a strong food element and a vast 
selection of predominantly Belgian speciality and craft 
beers. The business is very well established with a strong 
presence in Covent Garden and provides the basis  
for a national roll out over time. The customer base  
is in line with the other businesses in the Group and 
cross-selling opportunities will offer synergy benefits.

since the year end
The Group will continue to seek and identify 
development opportunities across its existing estate  
to enhance the profitability of the Group. 
The Group operates in a fragmented marketplace with 
strong potential to grow by site acquisition and purchase 
of small groups across the UK’s major conurbations.
Since the year end the Group has: 
•  Signed an “agreement to lease” on a 20 year term a 
new site in Liverpool. The Group intends to develop this 
unit in the financial year ending June 2015 to Lola Lo, 
bringing the total number of Lola Lo units to 11. The new 
acquisition is subject to the satisfactory outcome of 
planning and licensing applications.
•  Signed a new 20 year lease on a site in Sheffield, 
bringing the total number of sites to 23. The property is 
situated on the popular West Street, set over two levels 
with ground floor and first floor totalling 6,500 square 
feet and also includes its own exclusive outside area. 
The Group intends to develop this unit in the financial 
year ending June 2015 to a Lola Lo and will include  
the Group’s popular ‘Island Grill’ food offering.

•  On 18 July 2014 a new intermediate holding company 
was formed called Eclectic Icon Ltd. This company  
is a 100% subsidiary of Eclectic Bar Group plc. 
  In a share sale and purchase agreement dated  
24 July 2014 Eclectic Bar Group plc agreed to transfer 
100% of its holding in Eclectic Bars Ltd (6,300,000 
ordinary shares of £0.0001) to Eclectic Icon Limited  
in return for the allotment and issue of 14,999,999 
ordinary shares in that company. 
  On the same day Eclectic Icon Ltd carried out a 
capital reduction whereby its share capital was 
reduced from £15,000,000 divided into 15,000,000 
shares of £1.00 each to £1,500,000 divided into 
15,000,000 shares of £0.10 each, thereby creating 
£13,500,000 of realised profits which would be 
available in the future for distribution by way  
of dividends to Eclectic Bar Group plc.
•  Finally, the Group has also concluded a significant 
extension on the Embargo Republica, Kings Road  
lease to 2033. The club and terrace space has been 
upgraded and the venue refitted over the summer  
to include the facility for the introduction of live music 
and fully reopened at the end of August 2014.

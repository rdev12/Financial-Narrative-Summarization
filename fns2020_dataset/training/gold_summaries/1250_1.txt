 6 Armour Group plc Annual Report 2010
Chief Executive’s Review
In the year to 31 August 2010 Armour has 
delivered profitable results in one of the most 
difficult trading environments in recent memory. 
The year to 31 August 2010 has been a  
volatile one for the Group, influenced by the 
poor weather in January , a disappointing 
World Cup and a general fall in consumer 
confidence following the Election and the 
subsequent Budget. Despite these issues,  
the Group has remained profitable and  
has successfully grown sales. 
The fluctuating demand from our customers, 
particularly in the latter part of the financial 
year , proved challenging in correctly sizing  
our business operations to ensure that we 
maintain our levels of service and support  
to our customers, whilst operating from an 
affordable cost base. Throughout the year we 
have looked to reduce our operating costs and 
as part of this review, we have now initiated a 
reorganisation of our home division which will 
deliver further cost savings and efficiencies 
going forward into 2011.
Whilst the economic environment has been 
uncertain, we have seen encouraging signs  
of steady improvement in Armour Auto and 
our operations in Asia have again grown sales 
significantly , albeit from a fairly small base. 
Our new product programme has also 
delivered further successes through products 
such as Q-TV2, our discreet flat screen 
speaker system, and remains a core part  
of the Group’s strategy to deliver future 
profitable growth.
Armour Home designs, develops and 
distributes a range of consumer products and 
accessories for the home, supplying the retail 
and house building markets primarily in the 
UK. In the year to 31 August 2010 the sales for 
the Armour Home division were £42.8 million 
which generated a profit of £1.9 million. 
 
2010 has been a year of contrast for the 
Home division, experiencing both ends of the 
trading spectrum over the course of the year .  
A strong first four months in the run into 
Christmas 2009 was impaired by a poor 
January , due to the serious winter weather , 
and a very quiet July following the end of  
the football World Cup.
Our key UK markets of retail and house 
building have continued to feel the effects of 
economic downturn during 2010. Once again 
profit margins have been under pressure from 
aggressive price competition, fluctuating 
exchange rates and a changing sales mix 
caused by slower sales into the high margin 
home automation market relative to an 
increase in sales in the lower margin  
retail market.
Sales of our home automation systems and 
associated products declined during the year 
by 5% with demand remaining subdued due 
to the low level of new house builds and a 
sluggish home renovation market. There 
were signs, in the first quarter of 2010, that 
the market was improving with a significant 
number of new project specifications for our 
core Systemline distributed home audio and 
video systems. However , following the Election 
and the emergency Budget, the market 
slowed with many projects being delayed.  
As with last year , demand has been better 
at the higher end of the market with smaller 
developers who are typically building less 
than 20 homes per year . We believe that this 
demand at the higher end of the market will 
continue and our launch of a new 16 room 
Systemline system, due at the beginning of 
2011, will help to protect and grow our 
revenues in this important sales channel.  
The home automation market remains a  
key part of the home division, accounting 
for 18% of divisional sales.

We believe that this demand at the higher end of 
the market will continue and our launch of a new 
16 room Systemline system, due at the beginning 
of 2011, will help to protect and grow our revenues 
in this important sales channel.
Sales into the UK retail channel performed 
satisfactorily given the market conditions, 
ending the year 13% up on 2009, although 
gross margins were down due to an 
unfavourable sales mix and price competition. 
Sales growth was driven by new products 
under our Q Acoustics, Alphason and QED 
brands. Q Acoustics, the award-winning hi-fi 
speaker brand, had a good year with both 
the Q2000 hi-fi speaker range and Q-TV2 
exceeding our sales expectations. Alphason’s 
new office furniture range also made an 
important impact generating sales of  
£2.2 million with the new range being listed  
at retailers including John Lewis, Staples,  
Next and Office Depot.
The division’s export sales had a reasonable 
year driven on by Q Acoustics Q2000 range  
of hi-fi speakers and Q-TV2, both of which 
delivered sales above our expectations.  
The trading environment in most of our 
target markets has remained difficult, 
although we have seen strong growth in 
Asia and Scandinavia, where our continued 
investment in expanding our subsidiary 
operations has delivered encouraging results. 
Armour Home has continued to bring to 
market award-winning products that are well 
reviewed in both the consumer and trade 
press. In 2010, the home division won more 
than 10 industry awards. These include the 
ERT Training Award for Alphason; Q Acoustics 
again winning the What Hi-Fi? Sound and 
Vision award for its Q2000 5.1 speaker 
package; and the new QED Profile HDMI  
cable winning What Hi-Fi? Sound and Vision 
“Product of the Year” award in the cable 
category. 
Our customer base in the home division has 
grown in 2010, particularly in the large retailer 
sector in the UK and Europe where new 
customers include Next, Debenhams, Shop 
Direct, Sainsbury , Kesa, Boulanger and FNAC. 
This underlines the quality of the brands, 
products and service that we continue to 
deliver into the retail market.

Armour Auto is the leading company in the 
UK and Sweden supplying the automotive 
aftermarket with connectivity solutions 
and audio-video equipment for in-vehicle 
applications. The division delivered sales 
of £13.3 million and a profit of £0.1 million 
in the year to 31 August 2010.
The automotive division has shown some 
encouraging signs of improvement during 
2010 that we believe will become increasingly 
evident in 2011. There have been positive signs 
of recovery in our OEM business and a good 
performance in the Nordic operations. 
However , weak consumer demand, logistical 
problems within a major customer’s 
operations and the delay in launching a key 
new product has combined to hold back sales 
in the year . Gross profit margins within the 
automotive division have performed well, 
increasing marginally on the prior year  
due to lower fixed production costs in  
the UK operations.
In our core UK retail sales channel, market 
conditions have been testing with sales 
declining by 12%. For much of the year , sales 
into the specialist independent retail channel 
showed modest improvement over 2009, but 
in the last quarter sales into this channel 
slowed and ended marginally down.  
In the national accounts, sales were also 
down, but this was distorted by operational 
issues experienced by our largest customer 
following the relocation of their warehousing 
and logistical operations in July. Whilst these 
issues are now resolved, they did have a 
material impact on sales and profits in  
July and August. 
 
 
 
 
In our OEM business, which accounts for 28% 
of the division’s sales, we experienced positive 
signs of recovery in 2010 with sales growing 
by 17%. Demand from all our key customers 
grew, particularly in the agricultural vehicle 
market, as their production schedules 
increased during the year . The new contracts 
won in 2009 all came on stream in 2010 and 
contributed to sales. Armour Auto has 
continued to win new contracts in 2010 in 
niche areas of the automotive OEM market 
and on the back of these contract wins and 
increasing demand from the existing 
customer base, sales are expected to continue 
to grow throughout 2011 in this sales channel.
The focus in 2010 for our iO range of in-vehicle 
Bluetooth music streaming and handsfree 
solutions has been to build the distribution 
channel in preparation of the launch of the 
new technology platform. Considerable 
progress has been made in developing the 
reseller network throughout the UK and in 
selected international markets. However , 
the delay in launching the second generation 
product range has undoubtedly held back our 
sales in this category. The launch of the new 
product range is scheduled for early 2011 and 
our expectation is that sales will accelerate 
following its launch.
Armour Nordic, our business in Scandinavia 
that forms part of Armour Auto, has had 
another good year with a strong increase in 
sales. This growth came principally from the 
expansion of the distribution in Sweden and 
Norway of Armour Home’s brands, which 
were taken on in March 2009. Sales of the 
automotive product portfolio, which remains 
the largest element of sales in Nordic, were 
flat in the year . The prospects for the Nordic 
region remain good driven by further growth 
in the home products and increased 
penetration in the Norwegian market,  
which we entered in 2009.

New Product Development A significant 
proportion of the Group’s sales growth in 2010 
has come from new products launched in 
2010. The key new products have been Q-TV2, 
Q2000, QED Profile and the Alphason office 
furniture range. The continued investment  
in new product development is vital to the 
long-term growth of the Group and forms 
a fundamental part of the Group’s strategy.  
The economic environment has meant that 
some development programmes have been 
put on hold, but the core programmes have 
continued and will deliver a range of new 
products in 2011, with a focus firmly on the 
wireless delivery of content. One such product 
is the Q2 Internet Radio (www.Q2radio.co.uk), 
which was launched in November 2010 and 
provides access to over 10,000 radio stations 
as well as podcasts. This radio is truly unique 
with no buttons, dials or screens and is 
controlled by rolling it over to change  
stations and tilting forward or backwards  
to adjust volume.  
Outlook The forthcoming year is likely to 
continue to be challenging with considerable 
uncertainty lingering in our core consumer 
markets. Consequently , we are engaged in a 
review of our operations with a view to sizing 
the Group to meet a more difficult outlook. 
There will undoubtedly be areas of the Group 
that will make progress in the coming year 
and the prospects for new products such as 
the second generation of the iO Bluetooth 
music streaming and handsfree solutions  
are promising. However , the overall outlook  
is one of caution.

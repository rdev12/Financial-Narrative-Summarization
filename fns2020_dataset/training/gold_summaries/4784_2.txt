“ The Group has enjoyed another successful year in 2014, delivering 
its best ever performance in terms of revenue, adjusted operating 
profit and adjusted EPS. The business continued to invest, delivering 
a major new product launch in the Dillistone Systems division, while 
successfully completing the integration of FCP Internet into the 
Voyager Software division, and in September 2014 announcing the 
acquisition of ISV Software. 
 
This represents our 3rd successive year on year increase in the 
dividend, in line with our progressive dividend policy, which illustrates 
the Board’s confidence in the future prospects of the Group.”

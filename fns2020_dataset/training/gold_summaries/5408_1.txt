 Performance review 2007
The rapid rate of development in 2007 
has changed both the scale and scope of
Empresaria’s operations. Reflecting these
changes we are breaking down our review of
the business this year into three regions, UK,
Continental Europe and Rest of the World. 
This breakdown allows us to highlight not only
relative financial performance of each region
but, of equal interest, the distinctive growth
strategies applied in each market. 
The UK performed strongly in 2007.
Development focus in the UK over recent years
has been to expand and strengthen our existing
operations. This approach is reflected in healthy
organic growth rates at both revenue and 
net fee income line of 20%, an improvement 
in the proportion of net fee income derived 
from temporary staffing revenue to 58% and
increased operational efficiency driving the
Group’s bottom line performance. 
In Continental Europe, where labour markets
tend to be more highly regulated and
economies of scale create greater competitive
advantage, our approach has been to build
strong bridgeheads in individual country
markets through acquisition and then to use
these as cornerstones for growth in each
country. The clearest example of this approach
was the investment in Headway in Germany 
in May 2007. Headway performed in line with
expectations in 2007, generating year on year
revenue and net fee income growth of 25%. 
Outside of the UK and Continental Europe 
we have targeted emerging economies and
staffing markets where the primary focus has
been on investing in start up operations with
experienced local management teams. This
approach has an initial adverse impact on
profits but, as we are already experiencing,
creates rapid organic growth in immature but
fast developing markets. The year 2007 was
significant for this region as the large number 
of recent start up companies moved collectively
towards profitability. 
Headway investment
On May 3, 2007 Empresaria acquired 60% in
the German staffing company Headway, a fast
growing, partially specialised staffing company,
based in Bavaria and expanding its network
rapidly in other parts of Germany. This
acquisition was an important strategic step in
the internationalisation programme and gives
Empresaria a much more balanced stream of
revenues and profits. 
In the period from May to the end of the year
Headway contributed revenues of £47m, net
fee income of £15m and operating profit of
£2m, in line with expectations.
The German market has experienced strong
growth in 2007. Headway achieved sales
growth of 25.1%, exceeding the estimated
market growth of approximately 20%, running
an ambitious expansion programme with a 
net total of 22 new branch openings, starting
from 47 branches in the beginning of 2006 
and ending the year with 69 branches. The
investment made in new branch offices in 2007
will benefit sales growth and profitability of
Headway from 2008 onwards, as the immature
branch network starts to exploit its potential. 
Particularly good progress was achieved in 
the specialised divisions Headway Logistics,
Headway Engineers and Headway Industry

In the period from May
to the end of the year
Headway contributed
revenues of £47m.
The rapid rate of development in 2007 
has changed both the scale and scope of
Empresaria’s operations. during 2007, increasing the proportion of 
the company’s specialist business to 56.2%,
while Headway Austria achieved profitability 
in 2007. The priorities for 2008 are to increase
profitability of the immature branch network,
improving efficiencies throughout the
organisation as well as strengthening the
successful existing divisions. 
Management team and structure
The Group is managed by a small, balanced
Board of Directors with a Non-executive
Chairman, two Executive Directors and two
Non-executive Directors. Below the main board
is a Board of Management chaired by the Chief
Executive. The Executive Directors are the
Group Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director. In 2006 we created the role of Head 
of European Operations with Continental
Europe companies reporting to this new
position. We have now created a similar role 
for the UK. As previously announced, Nick 
Hall-Palmer steps down as Group Finance
Director and as a member of the main Board
following the reporting of our 2007 results after
eight successful years in the role. His new role
is Group Development Director and Head of UK
Operations. Nick is replaced as Group Finance
Director by Stuart Kilpatrick. We welcome
Stuart to the team.
Market overview
Staffing is a relatively young industry. Growth
rates and growth dynamics differ from country
to country. As individual staffing markets evolve,
generalist clerical and industrial staffing services
make way for individual market specialists as
the drivers of growth. Liberalisation of previously
restricted labour markets acts as a catalyst for
super-normal growth rates, specific recent
examples being Japan and Germany. The
penetration rate – the percentage of the
working population of a country in temporary
work – varies from country to country
depending on the regulatory and cultural
environment. The UK has the highest
penetration rate of all international staffing
markets. Temporary staffing tends to follow
permanent staffing in each new market as
employers and workers acclimatise to the
benefits of flexible staffing. Above all, the
industry as a whole is growing on the back 
of the rapid global and regional demographic

changes, the increasing shortages of skilled
staff and the increasing demand for flexible
workforce solutions and flexible working
arrangements.
The short-term fortunes of generalist clerical
and industrial staffing companies are connected
to the broad economic environment in which
they operate. For specialist staffing companies
such as Empresaria, our short-term fortunes 
are largely dictated by the performance of the
specialist markets we serve. 
In the case of the UK market, the most
developed of all international markets, we have
deliberately invested in a portfolio of sectors
with different economic and market dynamics.
This diversification strategy has worked well
over time and enabled us to grow consistently
through previous difficult market conditions. 
At the moment we are seeing no material
change in our markets. Investment banking
(approximately 8% of UK net fee income) has
seen a decline in permanent revenues but, by
way of compensation, has seen a significant
increase in temporary staffing revenues. With
the exception of our Public Sector division (4%
of 2007 UK net fee income), which continues to
encounter challenging market conditions, all
sectors are performing strongly and are ahead
of 2007 at both revenue and net fee income
levels for the first two months of trading in
2008. Our Property Services and Construction
sector, in particular, is experiencing strong
demand for its services, particularly from
infrastructure and transportation clients
associated with upcoming projects such 
as the 2012 Olympics and the new London
Cross-Rail initiative.
In Continental Europe, Empresaria’s principal
exposure is to the German market, one of the
stronger economies and without doubt one 
of the fastest growing staffing markets as 
a consequence of recent labour market
liberalisation. Although industry growth rates
appear to have declined over the course of
2007, they are still expected to remain at
double digit levels for a number of years to
come. Outside of Germany we are experiencing
growth in our Eastern European operations and
enjoying contribution from our new Dutch
company, EAR, whose rate of expansion is
being restricted by the shortage of available
skilled workers.
The developing markets of Asia and Latin
America offer substantial long term growth
opportunities. In Asia in particular, we are 
well placed to take advantage of developing
economies and nascent staffing industries.
Empresaria now operates in China (and is
looking to increase its investment there in
2008), India, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
Indonesia and the Philippines. We are
experiencing rapid growth in each of these
countries and foresee a continuation of this
trend in 2008. 
Across all regions, Empresaria has a broad mix
of temporary and permanent staffing operations
with a group wide split of net fee income in
2007 of 72%:28% temporary to permanent.

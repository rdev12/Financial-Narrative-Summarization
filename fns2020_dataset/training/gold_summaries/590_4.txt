At a Glance
Al Noor Hospitals Group Plc (‘Al Noor’ or the ‘Company’) 
is the largest private healthcare company in Abu Dhabi, 
capturing 30% of all private in-patient admissions and 
29% of all private out-patient hospital visits. Our Company 
currently operates within three hospitals and 17 medical 
centres and clinics which are primarily located in the Emirate 
of Abu Dhabi with one further clinic in Muscat, Oman. 
Al Noor employs more than 4,000 staff and approximately 
5,400 patients entrust us with their health care needs every day.
Al Noor offers a wide spectrum of healthcare services within the 
primary, secondary, and tertiary care sectors and is the only 
private healthcare organisation in Abu Dhabi that has a full 
network, or ‘continuum’ of health services. Our broad range of 
diverse services provides patients with ‘seamless care’ as they 
move from service to service according to their changing health 
needs – from preventative care to the most complex services.
Not only does our Company focus on providing the types 
of services needed across the Emirate, Al Noor is also 
dedicated to providing an exceptional patient experience. 
The latest Health Authority-Abu Dhabi (‘HAAD’) statistics 
show that, among private providers in Abu Dhabi, Al Noor is 
a leader when it comes to in-patient satisfaction with all three 
of its hospitals placed in the top four in Abu Dhabi.

Al Noor is devoted to ensuring that our services fully and 
effectively meet the needs of our patients and the 
communities we serve. We have opened facilities over a wide 
area of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, providing ‘closer to home’ 
care to as many people as possible. Furthermore, our 
patients are able to receive all of their care, from treating an 
ear infection to cardiac surgery, within the Al Noor healthcare 
system.
Al Noor has a strategic presence in the three main 
geographical areas of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi: with medical 
centres in Abu Dhabi City, Al Ain, and the Western Region. 
The first two are densely populated and have high patient 
volumes. As flagship facilities, our three in-patient hospitals 
are well positioned, with two in the city of Abu Dhabi and one 
in the city of Al Ain. The hospitals are in ideal locations to 
support future growth and expansion.
Leading Operator
With comfortable modern facilities, the latest medical and 
diagnostic equipment, and world class staff, Al Noor 
hospitals are renowned in the UAE for delivering 
exceptional standards of patient care. All three Al Noor 
hospitals hold JCI accreditation and ISO certification. They 
boast high staff-to-patient ratios and enjoy consistently 
high patient satisfaction scores.
The Company operates 17 out-patient medical centres in 
the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the Emirate of Dubai, and the 
Sultanate of Oman, all of which opened between 2002 and 
2014. The medical centres provide out-patient and 
diagnostic services, with general practice and some 
medical specialties.

Results
I am pleased to report another good set of 
results against the background of mixed 
macroeconomic and market conditions 
across the countries in which we operate. 
Overall currency translation movements 
due to the weakening of sterling had 
a significant positive impact on the 
reported Group growth rates at actual 
exchange rates. 
Group revenue increased 14% to £7,429.1 
million (2015: £6,489.7 million) and adjusted 
operating profit before customer 
relationships amortisation and acquisition 
related costs was up 15% to £525.0 million 
(2015: £455.0 million). Adjusted earnings 
per share were 106.1p (2015: 91.0p), an 
increase of 17%.
At constant exchange rates, revenue 
increased by 4% and adjusted operating 
profit rose by 5%. The Group operating 
margin improved from 7.0% to 7.1% with 
adjusted earnings per share up 6% at 
constant exchange rates. 
Return on average operating capital 
increased to 55.9% from 55.5% in 2015, 
driven by an improvement in the operating 
capital in the underlying business, partly 
offset by an adverse impact from exchange 
rate movements, a slightly lower underlying 
operating margin and the impact of the 
lower return on operating capital from 
acquisitions. Return on invested capital of 
16.7% was down from 17.1% in 2015 
principally due to the effect of acquisitions 
and limited organic growth. 
Dividend 
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 29.0p. This brings the total dividend for 
the year to 42.0p, up 11% compared to 2015. 
Shareholders will again have the 
opportunity to participate in our dividend 
reinvestment plan.
Strategy
Our consistent and proven strategy of 
developing the business through organic 
growth, consolidating our markets through 
focused acquisitions and continuously 
improving our operations has delivered 
another successful year of growth for 
the Group.
We look to achieve organic growth by 
applying our resources and expertise to 
enable our customers to reduce or 
eliminate the hidden costs of sourcing and 
distributing a broad range of goods not for 
resale. By outsourcing these activities to 
Bunzl they are able to focus on their core 
business and run their operations more 
cost-effectively by achieving purchasing 
efficiencies and savings, while at the same 
time freeing up working capital, improving 
their distribution capabilities, reducing 
carbon emissions and simplifying their 
internal administration. 
By continuing 
to focus on our 
strengths and 
consolidate the 
markets in which 
we compete, we 
have achieved 
another year of 
growth in earnings 
and dividends.

Acquisition activity continued throughout 
2016. Including Saebe Compagniet and 
Prorisk and GM Equipement, which we 
agreed to acquire in November 2016 and 
completed in January 2017, we made 14 
acquisitions with a total committed spend of 
£184 million, thereby adding annualised 
revenue of £201 million. These acquisitions 
have helped to strengthen our position in 
many of the markets that we serve. In 
addition, the acquisition of Packaging Film 
Sales in the US was announced and 
completed at the beginning of 2017 and we 
are today announcing the purchase of LSH 
in Singapore. We now have operations in 
30 countries.
Investment
Investment in the business to support our 
growth strategy and enhance our asset base 
is an ongoing process. We have continued to 
improve our facilities and open new ones, 
both as a result of acquisitions and by 
consolidating our warehouse footprint in 
order to make it more efficient. Systems are 
critical to our ability to serve our customers 
in the most effective way. We continuously 
upgrade our IT systems as we integrate new 
businesses into the Group’s operations and 
increase the functionality of our existing 
systems. By doing so we are able to 
enhance our customer offering and retain a 
competitive advantage, thereby maintaining 
our leading position in the marketplace.
Corporate responsibility
We continue to focus on sustainable 
operating processes throughout our 
businesses while at the same time, through 
our one-stop-shop offering to our 
customers, also actively contribute to the 
sustainable footprint of our customers’ 
businesses by consolidating their product 
deliveries. We work closely with our 
suppliers with a view to ensuring that they 
also adopt corporate responsibility (‘CR’) 
policies similar to our own, while the quality 
assurance/quality control team in Shanghai 
undertakes audits of our key Asian 
suppliers to assist them in meeting our 
stringent standards. In addition, we 
continually look to add to our full range of 
environmentally friendly products. Integrity 
is at the heart of Bunzl’s standards and we 
ensure that all relevant employees 
undertake CR training and that our 
whistleblowing programme is 
communicated throughout the Group.
Employees
Bunzl’s decentralised business model 
drives local empowerment and fast decision 
making, thereby allowing us to demonstrate 
repeatedly our understanding of our 
customers’ needs and deliver great service. 
Throughout our operations around the 
world, it is the enthusiasm with which our 
employees undertake their responsibilities, 
their commitment to improve our 
performance and their willingness to go 
the extra mile that allows us continually to 
delight our customers. I would like to thank 
them all for their achievements this year 
which have contributed greatly to the 
Group’s continued success. 
Board
After more than a decade in the role, 
Michael Roney retired as Chief Executive 
and stood down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 
April 2016. He was succeeded by Frank van 
Zanten who for the previous 10 years was 
Managing Director of the Continental 
Europe business area. The management 
transition has gone well with Frank’s 
appointment providing continuity for 
the business as well as its customers 
and employees. 
Following his appointment as Chief 
Executive of Brammer plc, Meinie Oldersma 
resigned as a non-executive director in 
August 2016. 
David Sleath, who has served as a non-
executive director since September 2007, 
will be retiring after the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting in April 2017. During his 
time he has also served as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee and Senior Independent 
Director. His independent advice and 
significant contribution to our success have 
been greatly appreciated and he leaves the 
Board with our thanks and best wishes.
Today we are announcing the appointment 
of Lloyd Pitchford as non-executive director 
with effect from 1 March 2017. Lloyd is 
currently Chief Financial Officer of Experian 
plc and has extensive international business 
experience which will be of great value to 
Bunzl as we continue to expand and develop. 
Upon David Sleath’s retirement at the 
Annual General Meeting, Lloyd will assume 
the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and Vanda Murray will become the Senior 
Independent Director.

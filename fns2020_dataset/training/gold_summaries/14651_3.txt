financial statements
Spirent delivered a strong performance in 2010: 
reporting growth of 13 per cent in revenue to 
$482.2 million and growth of 30 per cent in 
operating profit to $112.7 million. 
The Company is consistently achieving a return on sales of over 20 
per cent, with the return in 2010 being 23 per cent. The order book 
increased in the year, with a book to bill ratio of 105. Earnings per 
share was distorted compared to the prior year by the recognition  
of deferred tax assets in 2009. Eliminating this effect by taking a 
constant tax rate for both years shows that adjusted basic earnings 
per share increased by 31 per cent in 2010 to 11.62 cents, after 
charging 0.27 cents in respect of share-based payment and acquired 
intangible asset amortisation.
The financial performance of the Group reflects the improvement in 
operations achieved through the pursuit of excellence in all aspects 
of the business coupled with growth in the markets for Spirent’s 
leading test solutions. 
This trend of improvement seen in the past several years is now 
combined with revenue growth driven by the innovation of our 
employees in developing world-class test solutions to serve the 
needs of a rapidly evolving communications industry. We plan  
to expand the Group’s capabilities through additional investment  
for organic growth by the expansion of product development 
engineering and extension to our sales activities. In addition,  
we are pursuing growth through acquisition, when and where  
we can see that the return on investment is attractive. As the first 
step in this process we completed the acquisition of The Fanfare 
Group, Inc. in February 2011.
The Group’s free cash generation was $82.6 million in 2010, 
representing a cash conversion to earnings ratio of 104. Cash 
balances were $223.9 million at 31 December 2010. Given the strong 
overall performance of the Group, the Board recommends a final 
dividend of 1.40 cents per share compared with 1.00 cents per share 
in 2009. The Company intends to maintain its policy to repurchase 
shares in order to counteract any dilutive effect from the exercise of 
share-based incentives.
Ed Bramson stood down as Chairman on 4 March 2010, and both  
he and Gerard Eastman retired as non-executive directors on 5 May 
2010. We thank them for their outstanding achievements during  
their tenure. 
The strong performance in 2010 was achieved through the hard work 
and commitment of our employees and management teams 
throughout the world. I wish to thank all of them for their contribution 
to making 2010 such a success for Spirent. 
We are mindful of global macro-economic factors that are likely to 
create challenges in the coming year. However, Spirent’s diversified 
customer base, market leading product offerings and promising 
market opportunities mean that we are well placed to deliver further 
growth through 2011.

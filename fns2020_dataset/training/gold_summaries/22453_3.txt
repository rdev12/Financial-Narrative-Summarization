 ClearDebt Group plc  
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
 
2 
 
I present the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2008. 
 
These are the first financial statements reported by the Group in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. The principal change to the financial 
statements relates to the treatment of goodwill. Goodwill is no longer amortised but is instead reviewed by the 
Board on an annual basis and any impairment in the carrying value is immediately recognised through the 
income statement. A full explanation of the transition to IFRS is included in the notes to the financial 
statements. 
 
The Group made an operating loss of £1,131,950 in the year (2007: loss of £695,029) resulting in a loss after 
taxation of £697,264 (2007: loss of £657,494) and whilst it is disappointing to continue to record a loss there has 
been much progress made in the year, particularly in relation to the successful diversification of the Group’s 
IVA activities into the debt management arena via the acquisition of Abacus (Financial Consultants) Limited 
(“Abacus”).  
 
The Group’s balance sheet shows net current assets of £100,990 (2007: £1,195,387) which includes cash of 
£265,537 (2007: £849,795) which is sufficient to continue to develop the Group’s business over the next 12 
months, given the positive cash flow now being enjoyed in ClearDebt and Abacus. 
 
The Group is now starting to reap the rewards of the Abacus acquisition both through the provision of a 
complete offering of appropriate debt solutions to its clients and also via the cross referral opportunities being 
achieved in terms of client acquisition. This, together with savings being achieved through synergies in 
advertising spends across the 2 divisions, leads me to look forward to the coming year with increasing 
confidence.

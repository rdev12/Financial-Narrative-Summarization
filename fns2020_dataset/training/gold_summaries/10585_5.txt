Yell
As a result of its strong vendor relationships, yet independent
stance, Morse has been able to implement a supplier
framework agreement which delivers considerable cost
savings to Yell.
Morse has demonstrated quarter on quarter improvement
against the criteria set by Yell as part of their Strategic
Supplier Programme. These are based on service levels,
communication, flexibility, value, and relationship.
Morse’s specialist sales team has demonstrated an in-depth
understanding of Yell’s business and their requirements,
allowing Morse to create innovative and unique solutions to
meet Yell’s needs. The breadth and depth of Morse’s
knowledge and expertise has enabled Morse to implement
appropriate and effective solutions on time and on budget. 
The strength of this relationship has allowed Yell to take
advantage of Morse’s capabilities to advise and execute
across a range of enterprise level technologies and issues
including servers, storage, software, asset lifecycle
management and resourcing.

Results
Turnover increased by 18.8% to £956.4m  
(2007: £804.8m). Average selling prices were up 
18.5%, more than compensating for the 11.2% 
volume shortfall caused by our deliberate strategy of 
reducing the ex-Uniqema commodity business and 
weak industrial markets in the second half. Currency 
translation added a further 11.5% to the growth. 
Turnover in our core Consumer Care division was up 
28.0% and up 11.9% in Industrial Specialities.
Continuing pre-tax profit before exceptional items 
increased by 61.8% to £98.4m (2007: £60.8m). 
Earnings per share before exceptional items increased 
by 39.4% to 51.7p (2007: 37.1p), despite the dilution 
from the business disposals discussed below.
Disposals
We disposed of our associate, Baxenden Chemicals, 
in February 2008 to Chemtura Corporation for 
£13.0m and our Chicago Oleochemical business was 
sold to H.I.G. Capital LLC in May 2008 for £46.8m. 
These disposals further reduced Croda’s exposure to 
commodity and industrial markets.
Dividend
In 2007, we changed our dividend policy from one 
of modest dividend growth, whilst building dividend 
cover, to payouts growing more in line with earnings. 
As a consequence of the strong trading performance, 
the Board has increased the final dividend by 25.5% 
to 13.55p, making a total of 19.75p for the year. This 
represents an increase of 25.4% versus the 15.75p 
paid out for 2007. 
Outlook
We have started 2009 in line with expectations. The 
broad trading trends of resilient Consumer Care 
demand, weaker industrial markets and favourable 
currency translation are continuing. We are confident 
of making further progress in the year ahead.
Martin Flower 
Non-executive Chairman
I am very pleased to announce that 2008 was another year of excellent 
progress for Croda. The Group’s ability to produce record sales and profits 
demonstrates the robustness of the underlying business and the continuing 
strength in our core market sectors. Furthermore, these results were 
achieved despite a difficult economic environment with steeply rising raw 
material costs in the first half and weak industrial markets, particularly in the 
second half. Overall, the Group saw double digit sales and profit growth in 
every quarter, with our Consumer Care business trading particularly well.
Chairman’s statement 3
Wind turbine at Hull factory Croda was the first chemical company in the UK to build and operate 
a 2MW wind turbine to cut costs and CO

 emissions. The turbine is producing 40% of the Hull site’s 
electricity needs and exporting any excess to the national grid.
The best way to predict the future is 
to invent it.

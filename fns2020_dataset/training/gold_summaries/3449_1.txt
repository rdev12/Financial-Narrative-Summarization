CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
STRATEGY
Chloride is a market leading, focused
supplier of secure power solutions to
those customers who understand the
risk to business continuity of degrading
power quality. We term this Secure
Power Always.
Our Total Solutions Approach
generates competitive advantage
through establishing long-term
relationships with customers, to whom
we provide service and support for
our own and multi-vendor installations
through life, often exceeding ten years.
Looking forward, we are conﬁdent
that our strategy provides an excellent
framework for sustained growth over
the long term as well as greater
resilience in the shorter term.
We were delighted to be awarded
the European Uninterruptible Power
Supplies Growth Strategy Leadership
Best Practices Award for 2008 by the
leading independent market research
company Frost & Sullivan.
The unprecedented upheaval in ﬁnancial
and commercial markets that took place
during the last year affected all aspects
of economic activity around the world.
This has, to varying degrees, fed
through into each of the geographies
and market sectors in which we
operate. The challenge for all
businesses and management teams
has been to maximise performance
in this very different macro-economic
environment to the recent past.
At Chloride we chose to remain
focused on the consistent and
sustained execution of our proven
strategy and by doing so we have been
able to deliver another year of strong
growth in sales, proﬁts and cash ﬂow.
In view of the economic conditions,
we were especially focused on
operating cash ﬂows throughout
the year. This has allowed us to both
manage down our net debt and to
maintain investment for the future.
We managed our cost base
appropriately, driving further business
efﬁciencies and taking pre-emptive cost
reduction actions in the USA and the
UK when market conditions warranted,
to support margins.
Going forward, we will continue to
execute our strategy and maintain the
careful and prudent management of our
cash ﬂows, costs and balance sheet.
THE UNPRECEDENTED UPHEAVAL IN FINANCIAL AND
COMMERCIAL MARKETS THAT TOOK PLACE DURING
THE LAST YEAR AFFECTED ALL ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY AROUND THE WORLD.
IT IS OUR STRATEGY TO OPERATE IN HIGHER GROWTH POTENTIAL
MARKET SECTORS AND GEOGRAPHIES AND TO FOCUS OUR
INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO:
 EXPAND THE NETWORK OF SALES AND SERVICE OFFICES THROUGH
WHICH WE ACCESS AND SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS
 MAINTAIN THE INDUSTRY LEADING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE
IN OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE SOLUTIONS
 DEVELOP THE SKILLS AND CAPABILITY OF THE CHLORIDE PEOPLE

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
on oil prices being greater than
US$50 per barrel (usually those involving
deepwater drilling and bitumen sands).
In Power Generation, the energy “gaps”
in many Western economies should
drive opportunities for conventional
and nuclear generation projects.
Despite a slowdown in Financial
Services the Data Centre market, which
accounts for 20% of sales, is expected
to be quite robust but with a switch from
large proprietary data centres to hosted
facilities. We will continue to use our
experience and expertise in Western
Europe to expand the business in Asia
Paciﬁc, Eastern Europe and Russia.
Whilst we generated good
performances in the Manufacturing
sector, where sales grew by 53%,
we expect this to be softer going
representing 16% (2008: 12%) and
Central Asia and Eastern Europe
generating 10% (2008: 8%).
Similarly, we have developed a better
balance to the market sectors that the
Group serves. This is achieved on a
region by region basis and our approach
is focused on the higher growth
potential sectors for Chloride in each
region. There remain opportunities for
us to grow, even in difﬁcult market
conditions, where we have historically
been underrepresented.
Energy and Oil & Gas represented 16%
of our sales and we expect this sector
to continue to generate opportunities
as we expand our geographic coverage.
Oil & Gas investment levels are
expected to be lower, particularly
affecting those projects dependent
LONG-TERM GROWTH MARKETS
The world market for Secure Power
solutions grew strongly in the ﬁrst half
of 2008 but, in common with many
other industries, the rates of growth
slowed through the second half of the
year as the economic environment
deteriorated. Nevertheless, we are
pleased to have once again delivered
growth ahead of the market and to
build market share.
Despite these shorter term challenges,
at a macro level, we are conﬁdent that
increasing Digitisation and rising Energy
demand are enduring long-term drivers
of growth in our markets.
IMPROVED GEOGRAPHIC AND
MARKET SECTOR BALANCE
During the year we continued to
focus on extending our capabilities
and geographic reach in higher growth
potential markets. In so doing we
increased our addressable market,
improved the inherent resilience of
the business and positioned ourselves
closer to customers in order to be
able to service and support them
more effectively.
This approach has signiﬁcantly
improved the geographic balance of the
business. Western Europe, our largest
market, now accounts for 57% (2008:
63%) of sales, with Asia Paciﬁc

In the UK our service business grew
strongly, more than offsetting the
impact of a slowdown in the Financial
Services related solutions business.
Chloride Masterpower, which is based
in Aberdeen and serves the Energy
and Oil & Gas markets, grew strongly
and will now be integrated into the
UK business. This will allow a more
focused approach to the many
opportunities in the UK Energy and
Oil & Gas sectors, as well as releasing
back ofﬁce efﬁciencies.
STRENGTHENING A
MARKET LEADING POSITION
IN WESTERN EUROPE
Western Europe, where we continue
to be strong in the UK, Italy, Spain
and Germany, performed well with
growth at 11%.
During the year we strengthened
our presence and capabilities in
key Western European markets
and geographies.

and the Government sector, 34% higher,

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
In India our strategic partnership
with DB Power Electronics (DB)
developed further as we took effective
management control in July 2008 and
agreed to acquire up to 90% of the
business in July 2009. DB, which is the
largest domestic secure power supplier
in India, has a sales and service network
of more than 40 ofﬁces. DB has a
strong technical capability and holds
the requisite qualiﬁcations to supply
the Indian nuclear industry. Going
forward DB will be responsible for
all of Chloride’s business in India, and
where appropriate DB technology will
be sold through the Chloride network.
In Italy we continued to make good
progress, building on long-term
relationships with customers across a
wide range of sectors and, importantly,
started to address hitherto unexplored
opportunities in the Energy and Oil &
Gas markets.
Spain performed well, particularly
in the Energy and Oil & Gas markets,
which more than compensated for
weakness in our traditional sectors.
Sales grew 26%.
In Sweden, where we hold a 15%
minority stake in Chloride Eltek,
performance was strong. We have
an option to acquire the remaining
interest in this business by 2010.
ACCELERATING GROWTH
IN ASIA PACIFIC
The markets in Asia Paciﬁc offer strong
long-term growth opportunities and we
continue to move quickly and decisively
to expand our presence and capability
in this territory. Sales in the region
were up 71%. We won excellent
business in China for the Olympics,
in South Korea in the Energy and
Oil & Gas sectors as well as in
Malaysia and Hong Kong.
In January 2009 we acquired Siemens
UK’s UPS service business. The
business was immediately integrated
into the UK service network and
provides access to a range of new
customers and markets. Just after
the end of the year we completed the
acquisition of Malcolm Power Systems,
a small UPS service provider
in Scotland.
In October 2008 we improved our
access to the Irish market with the
acquisition of Power & Electronic
Services Limited. Since the business
was acquired, it has performed strongly
and has generated good orders, sales
and cash.
In France, where our Industrial
Systems business is headquartered
in Lyon, performance was strong with
the focus on the Energy and Oil & Gas
markets. We also invested in our sales
and service business relocating to new
facilities and ASTE, our multi-vendor
service provider, has had a successful
year, growing strongly with a number
of customers including Aeroport de
Paris and Euro Disney.

In Vietnam we established our

rewarded with orders and sales;
including a prestigious order with
the Vietnamese telecoms operator
Vietel. Late in the period we
established a presence in South Korea
and the Philippines and have already
secured orders.
Our manufacturing joint venture in
Shenzhen, Southern China, came on
stream during the year, as expected,
with the launch of three new products
under 200kVA. This signiﬁcant
investment, in which we have
management control and which is now
proﬁtable, will help underpin Group
margins going forward and provides a
local source for the Asia Paciﬁc region.
These investments reﬂect our
commitment to the region and our
determination to establish a signiﬁcant
platform for a long-term presence
in Asia Paciﬁc.
We continued to invest in Chloride
Singapore to develop a market leading
presence in the territory and were
rewarded with some signiﬁcant order

TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS
Central to our Total Solutions Approach
is sustained investment in technology
and service offerings in order to
maintain our industry leading position
and to ensure we meet the
expectations of customers.
 The vitality index, which represents
the proportion of product sales
derived from products introduced
in the last three years, stands at
76% buoyed by signiﬁcant new
launches in both the standard
and industrial businesses.
 Our product range offers class
leading energy efﬁciency
performance and the smallest
footprints in the market.
Improvement in energy
efﬁciency is a priority in
our development process.
DB has increased our development
capability. We completed construction
of a dedicated development centre at
DB’s headquarters in Pune, India during
the year. The DB team now works in
close co-operation with our existing
design centres in Erlangen, Germany
and Bologna, Italy and has an important
role in development for both the Indian
and international markets.
BUILDING A PLATFORM
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA
We achieved another year of growth
in the region with sales up 27%.
Performance was driven by good
penetration of both the standard and
Energy and Oil & Gas markets in the
UAE, Kuwait, North Africa and Saudi
Arabia. In addition, we took steps to
further strengthen the management
team and improve our technical,
project management and service
capabilities in the region.
AMERICAS
Overall performance in the Americas
was, in reported terms, up by 13%,
the highest growth rate in the region
in recent years. In North America our
small products and power conditioning
business struggled (down 11% at
constant exchange rates), a result of
the poor economic environment and
a speciﬁc exposure to retail markets.
However, the high power business
grew by 27% (10% at constant
exchange rates), its fourth consecutive
year of growth, and also beneﬁted from
the acquisition of Protech Services,
a Chicago-based service provider,
in January 2009. This acquisition,
the ﬁrst in North America for a number
of years, will allow us to accelerate the
development of the US service business.
In Latin America we grew well with
sales up 23%, the result of a strong
performance in Brazil.
DEVELOPING A PRESENCE
IN EASTERN EUROPE AND
CENTRAL ASIA
In Eastern Europe and Central Asia
we have focused on developing a local
Chloride presence in the countries
we see as important. Excellent sales
growth of 51% in Eastern Europe
reﬂected strong performances in
a number of businesses.
In Turkey, where we are the market
leader, a focus on expanding our
solutions offering and a targeted
approach to the Energy and Oil &
Gas sectors generated sales up
by 42%.
In June 2008 we opened Chloride
Rus LLC, a joint venture, with our
long standing partner in Russia,
in which we have a minority stake.
This is proving to be an exciting
opportunity with sales to the joint
venture up 25% as we developed
the local technical capability and
services platform.
Our business in Poland, Chloride
Polska, had its second year of strong
growth with sales more than doubling.
In Kazakhstan we established an
additional sales and service ofﬁce
and in Azerbaijan we are present
in Baku to support the offshore
oil and gas installations in the
Caspian Sea.

SERVICE
Central to our strategy is the provision

Connections grew 9% this year and
over the past four years have grown
11%, CAGR. The next generation,
Life.Next, will provide IT-based,
customer conﬁgurable interrogation
and reporting to make critical
information available to customers.
PEOPLE
Our strategy is dependent upon the
development of the knowledge and
skill base in Chloride and on our ability
to add to and develop that base as
we expand our geographic presence.
Chloride is fortunate to have some
of the most experienced people in
the industry and I am grateful to my
colleagues for their commitment to
customers, which ultimately delivers
success for Chloride.
The service order book grew by 27%
and service revenue now accounts for
34% (2008: 32%) of total revenues.
 Our services are focused on the
needs of customers, with the aim
of developing long term relationships
with them. We have developed
and broadened our range of services
to support the wider critical power
infrastructure and now provide
generator, switchgear, emergency
lighting and control system service
support. In addition, we offer a range
of site testing and surveys including
thermal imaging, waveform analysis,
battery impedance testing and fuel
tank surveys.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
OPERATING MARGINS
The operating margin increased by
just less than one point, the seventh
successive year of improvement.
We managed our cost base very
carefully, driving further business
efﬁciencies and taking pre-emptive cost
reduction actions in the US and the UK
when market conditions warranted,
to support margins. Our service focus
drove the higher margin service
revenues strongly ahead improving
the sales margin mix.
CURRENCY
The Group’s activities in each of the
countries in which we operate are
conducted and managed in local
currency. A majority of the Group’s
sales and proﬁts are generated within
the euro zone and the strength of
the euro relative to sterling has had
a material translational impact on
the Group’s results.
During the year the impact on sales
and operating proﬁt was £32.4 million
and £6.1 million respectively.
Signiﬁcant movements in the sterling-
dollar and sterling-euro exchange rates
have the potential to have a material
impact on the Group’s reported results
going forward.
ROBUST BUSINESS MODEL
Given the economic conditions
we were especially focused on the
generation of strong operating cash
ﬂows throughout the year. Operating
cash ﬂow was £43.0 million, (2008:
£30.0 million) with conversion at 93%
(2008: 83%). The growth in operating
cash ﬂow fed through into the free
cash ﬂow and allowed us to fund
acquisitions and reduce the gearing in
the business to 10.8% (2008: 23.1%).
This, together with good management
of our credit facilities, means that we
remain a well funded business with
the ﬁnancial resources to sustain
development and investment in
the business. The Group’s committed
borrowing facilities at 31 March 2009
amount to £110.0 million. In addition,
the Group has uncommitted facilities
of £13.0 million. Included in the
committed facilities amount are
two credit facilities amounting to
£25.0 million each that expire in June
2009 and November 2009. The Group
has been successful in renewing the
ﬁrst of these facilities and increasing
the same to £30.0 million and is well
advanced in discussions with the
renewal or replacement of the other
facility and expects to complete this
exercise in the next quarter.
– Power
to Learn, Power to Grow – is now
ﬁrmly established at the centre of the
training and development programme
for Chloride people and business
partners across the world. Blended
learning techniques combining remote
and residential attendance are used and
where appropriate courses are provided
in local languages. Rapid progress
has been made with the formal
accreditation of training centres in
Bologna, Bedford, Erlangen, Singapore,
Madrid, Istanbul, Pune and Sydney.
More than 15 trainers have passed
through a similarly rigorous assessment
to achieve trainer status.
Some 640 employees (27% of the
headcount) have undertaken training
modules in the year covering sales,
solution design and service support
that have been developed by experts,
both internal and external to Chloride.
As part of our Environmental Health
and Safety (EHS) policy our courses
incorporate the relevant EHS best
practice to safeguard employees,
customer staff and other stakeholders.
The Academy will remain a priority
for Chloride going forward.

PROSPECTS
Chloride operates in global markets
with robust long-term growth
characteristics, driven by increasing
Digitisation and rising Energy demand.
We enter the new ﬁnancial year with
an order book at record levels led by
Industrial Systems, but remain cautious
about the short term.
Chloride, which has a robust business
model, supports mission critical
business systems and public
infrastructure. Despite the more
challenging environment, with robust
service revenues and cash generation,
and a strong balance sheet we expect
the Group to show resilience. Mindful
of this we continue to review carefully
all our markets and manage closely
our cost base.
We continue to execute our strategy,
with further careful investment in
higher growth potential markets and
sectors, and in the technology and
services that meet the demands of
our customers. Accordingly, we are
conﬁdent in the longer term prospects
for the business.

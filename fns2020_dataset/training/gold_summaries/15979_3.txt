CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

I am pleased to report that Trakm8’s strategy of reinvesting in the business in order to drive long 
term growth is bearing fruit.  
 
Trakm8 has successfully introduced a number of new products and software solutions that have been 
well received by the market.  
 
The strength of the Trakm8 financial model where little profit is taken on the original sales is 
demonstrated by the improvement in cash balances to £1.41m and rising recurring revenues which 
continues to be the key focus of our strategy. 
 
I am encouraged by the outlook for the business. The Group is well positioned with a strong balance 
sheet in a growing market. With the increasingly advanced solutions offered by the Company’s 
technology, I am confident that the business will continue to grow profitably and take advantage of 
opportunities as and when they arrive. 
 
As announced separately today, I have decided to step down after seven years as Chairman and non-
executive Director of Trakm8.  John Watkins, currently our Chief Executive, has become Executive 
Chairman, a new role.  At the same time we are appointing Keith Evans, a former partner of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, as non-executive director.  It has been a pleasure contributing to the 
development of the Trakm8 story and I am confident that its future is bright and secure.       
 
 
Dawson Buck 
Chairman

 I am delighted to report that all the
Group’s brands made steady progress
during the year despite the slowing UK
economy. Both Village Hotels & Leisure
Clubs and Greens Health & Fitness
continued their organic growth and 
De Vere Hotels continued to trade 
robustly whilst addressing specific 
projects, including hosting The Ryder Cup
at The De Vere Belfry and the
refurbishment of the De Vere Cavendish
St. James’s. RevPAR for the UK hotel
market as a whole declined by 2.9% in
the provinces and by more than 14% in
London, whilst the health & fitness
market continued to grow. 
The resilience of our two hotel brands
under these market conditions
demonstrates the breadth of their
respective consumer offerings. Both
brands have differing mixes to their
income streams and customers compared
to their peer group and this enhanced
stability, in turn, provides the Group with
a strong competitive edge in difficult
market conditions. During the year, we
maintained our focus on training and also
reorganised our sales force and other
support teams to bring greater
operational efficiencies. This continuing
investment in our staff allows us to deliver
the fundamental skills of any hospitality
business – first class service.
Our commitment to improve all aspects of
our brand delivery resulted in De Vere
Hotels receiving a major award from the
British Development Research Consultants
(BDRC) in December 2001. This recognises
the increasing levels of both awareness
and brand loyalty that exist amongst our
strong and growing customer base.
Hosting The Ryder Cup was a significant
endorsement of the Group’s capabilities
in hospitality management and reinforces
De Vere’s position as a leading hotel and
conference group of outstanding quality.
The tournament, which took place in the
final week of the financial year, provided a
global platform from which to accelerate
the Group’s growing brand awareness,
reaching a worldwide television audience
of one billion including 26% of the UK
population. The Ryder Cup is now the
third largest televised sporting event in
the world. It attracted more than 180,000
visitors to The De Vere Belfry, who
witnessed first-hand the Group’s ability to
manage a world class event as well as an
excellent sporting contest. A high
proportion of these visitors were
influential business decision-makers and,
quite possibly, future conference clients.

De Vere Hotels
At the year end, De Vere had 21 hotels
with 3,298 rooms (2001: 3,316) and
23,500 health & fitness members 
(2001: 22,400), an increase of 4.9%. 
During the year there were few signs of 
a sustainable recovery in demand in the
business and overseas visitor markets.
However, we are very pleased to report
that De Vere’s sales still grew by 1.8% to
£177.8 million (2001: £174.7 million). 
On a like-for-like basis total turnover rose
by 2.1%, whilst RevPAR grew by 1.4% to
£59.58. This compares to a decline in
RevPAR for the provincial hotel market of
2.9%. Like-for-like occupancy was
marginally down by 0.9 points to 74.1%
reflecting weakened demand.
Nevertheless, the average achieved rate
grew by 2.6% to £80.36 as a
consequence of our resilient stance on
pricing across all market segments.
EBITDA, excluding exceptional items,
reduced by 2.0% to £48.4 million (2001:
£49.4 million) and operating profit on the
same basis declined by 3.1% to £35.3
million (2001: £36.4 million). Increases in
business rates due to the rating revaluation
and climate change levy affected the first
half, whilst increased insurance premiums
impacted the whole year.
Although demand in the mid-week
business market was down, for both the
conference and corporate market, there
was a successful switch in focus to the
stronger short-break market, especially
during the first half. This is a testimony to
both our flexible approach and the
breadth of our offering. We continued
with our brand-building campaign over
the summer period and maintained a
robust stance on discounting, which was a
prevalent feature of this market segment. 
The refurbishment of the De Vere
Cavendish St. James’s has been completed
on schedule and the hotel is now
operating with 231 (2001: 250)
bedrooms. The hotel has been
repositioned as a leading 4-star deluxe
hotel in central London and will further
leverage the Group’s extensive client base.
During the refurbishment, the hotel
operated with a reduced number of
bedrooms and experienced similar trading
to the London market in general. The
benefits of the repositioning are already
being experienced both with positive
feedback and, more importantly, in a
steady rise in achieved room rates. 
Building on the success of The Ryder Cup,
the Group has been seeking opportunities
of raising the brand profile on a global
scale and has signed a sales and
marketing alliance with Destination Hotels
& Resorts in the USA. This agreement will
enable us to leverage the brand in the
North American market.
The ongoing and controlled refurbishment
programme of our bedstock and facilities
at a number of our hotels, to maintain the
quality of our estate in line with the 
De Vere brand positioning, will continue.
The steady growth of De Vere Resort
Ownership has been maintained. We have
met our target of building a further 11
lodges during the year, bringing the total
number to 126 at three of our resort
properties. An additional development
phase of six units has begun at De Vere
Slaley Hall for completion in August 2003.  
Right: De Vere Oulton Hall, a 5-star

35 De Vere and Village hotels offer
delegates the opportunity to use
function rooms of various sizes,
using versatile and well-equipped
presentation facilities.

By the year end the number of Village
Hotels & Leisure Clubs had reached 14,
with 1,243 rooms (2001: 1,089). Health &
fitness membership had grown by 14.9%
to 56,800 members (2001: 49,500).
Turnover for Village rose 13.2% to 
£64.2 million (2001: £56.7 million). On a
like-for-like basis, sales grew by 2.1% and
RevPAR by 0.7% to £40.59, against an
industry decline of 2.9%. On a similar
basis occupancy was down by 1.8
percentage points to 79.2%. Achieved
rates rose by 3.1% to £51.25, the latter
once again reflecting our resilient pricing
stance. EBITDA grew by 9.2% to £19.2
million (2001: £17.6 million) and
operating profit increased by 6.0% to
£13.4 million (2001: £12.6 million).
Like De Vere Hotels, there was a similar
and successful switch in focus, from the
weak corporate market to the more
resilient short-break market. The
performance of Village relative to the
market demonstrates both the strength
and uniqueness of the brand. Village Bury,
which opened in August 2001, has now
delivered a full year’s contribution and is
meeting its targeted returns. Our 14th
Village hotel opened in Newcastle in June
2002 and it too is meeting trading
expectations. 
This hotel also includes some new design
modifications which will be used on
future new builds. A more flexible design
brief has been created which will be
adapted to meet differing local demand.
This, together with a smaller site
requirement, increases the potential of
our brand and expands the range of
possible new sites. 
We are now poised to move into the
South of England, which will be an
important step in the brand’s
development. Contracts have been
exchanged at Maidstone and
Bournemouth. Two further sites in the
Midlands, Perry Barr and North
Birmingham, are subject to planning
consent. There will be a phased opening
programme of these four sites over the
next few years, with the first due to open
in Summer 2004. We are continuing to
seek further sites that will meet our strict
development criteria.

Greens Health & Fitness 
It has been a year of substantial progress
for Greens, our health & fitness brand,
which moved into profit as expected.
During the year, a further four clubs were
opened at Chingford, Gosforth, Shipley
and Leicester and total membership stood
at 59,300 members as at 29 September
2002 (2001: 37,000). Our target of 15
clubs will be achieved by the end of
December with the scheduled opening at
Giffnock, South Glasgow.
Turnover increased by 78.3% to £24.0
million (2001: £13.5 million) with like-for-
like sales up by 13.0%. EBITDA increased
to £4.8 million (2001: £0.5 million) and
an operating profit of £1.3 million was
achieved in the year (2001: operating loss
£1.0 million). 
In a market that is still growing, there was
a successful drive for new members over
the summer months. Average club
membership is over 4,000. After three
years of expansion, the emphasis for the
forthcoming year is on optimising unit
profitability, cash flow and strengthening
Greens’ position as a player at the
premium end of the market.
G&J Greenall
Due to a decline of marginal own label
products in favour of higher contribution
branded products, total sales decreased
by 3.7% to £27.9 million (2001: £28.9
million). Operating profit for the full year
increased, however, by 6.5% to 
£1.9 million (2001: £1.8 million). 
Current Trading & Outlook
During the first eight weeks of the current
financial year, total Group turnover has
increased by 7.4% on 2001. RevPAR on a
like-for-like basis for De Vere Hotels has
increased by 3.7%, with sales up 1.6%.
On a similar basis, RevPAR at Village
Hotels & Leisure Clubs has increased by
2.3%, with sales up by 4.7%. Greens total
sales have increased by 47.1%.
We are pleased with recent trading,
although we remain cautious about
extrapolating a trend because of the
nature of the comparative figures. Looking
ahead, the outlook is still uncertain with
the extent and timing of recovery
remaining difficult to predict. However, we
have confidence that our brands will
continue to outperform the market.

 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2008 5
Chief Executive’s Review
Our strategy has strengthened 
the Group and we achieved 
a signiﬁcant advance in proﬁts.
Tony Thorne
Group Chief Executive
In 2007/08, the Group achieved a 54% advance in
adjusted operating proﬁt to £119.6 million. 
A tighter supply position for corrugated case material
(CCM) and corrugated packaging during much of the
ﬁnancial year provided good support for our price increase
programme, aimed at recovering the higher input costs we
have been incurring for some time. We also beneﬁted from
the actions taken in both our activities, Packaging and
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling, to improve the business 
mix and raise cost-competitiveness. 
Towards the end of the ﬁnancial year, we announced 
a major investment project aimed at reinforcing our position
as a leader in lighter-weight packaging, by giving us a
signiﬁcant capability in the growth segment of high-quality
lightweight CCM.
The improvement in the Group’s adjusted return on 
average capital employed in 2007/08 of 12.9%
(2006/07: 8.7%) represents good progress towards
meeting our target to exceed the Group’s estimated 
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.5% 
over the business cycle.
Strategy
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s composition 
and strategy to assess that these are best able to generate
value for shareholders. We are conﬁdent that the strategy
we are pursuing will provide good opportunities for 
organic development of the Group. In instances where 
it will enable us to fulﬁl our strategic development plans 
we will acquire businesses. We remain prepared to exit
businesses which are not likely to meet our strategic
objectives in the longer-term.
The strategy has strengthened the Group, giving us a 
good base from which to compete. It is ensuring that we 
are developing strong market positions in both Packaging
and Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling and raising operational
performance across our businesses. An aim of our strategy
is to dampen the volatility of the Group’s results through our
industry’s business cycle, particularly by ensuring that there
is sufﬁcient proﬁt growth in the less cyclical parts of our
Packaging operations to achieve long-term progress. 
In the coming ﬁnancial year we are prepared for tougher
trading conditions, reﬂecting difﬁculties in the world
economies, particularly those of the UK, the rest of western
Europe and the USA. We have established a number 
of strategic priorities with the objective of continuing 
to progress the implementation of the strategy whilst
maintaining cost discipline and a strong balance sheet.
In Packaging, we will provide market-leading service to 
our customers across the product range, but concentrate 
our pursuit of growth in targeted higher value-added sectors 
of the market. In Corrugated Packaging, these include 
retail-ready and promotional packaging, mainly for the 
fast-moving consumer goods market, and heavy-duty
packaging for industrial users, while in Plastic Packaging
we have a number of good growth opportunities for our
returnable transit packaging (RTP) business in both the
industrial and retail parts of the market. We will build on
our existing positions in the faster-growing markets of central
and eastern Europe and Russia. We are targeting to extend
our recycling capability to take advantage of the demand
for increased recycling associated with the environmental
pressures to reduce the quantity of waste going to landﬁll. 
In Paper, the priority is to reinforce our position in CCM, 
by successfully completing our project to supply high-quality
lightweight CCM at Kemsley Mill, but we will also develop
further our growing position in plasterboard liner. 
In Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling, we will maintain our 
focus on rebuilding proﬁts in the UK while developing 
the considerable potential of our existing businesses in
continental Europe. We will increase further our support 
for our dealer customers by developing our fulﬁlment
services, enhancing our e-commerce and promotional 
tools and exploiting our capability to supply those 
products that resellers choose to offer but do not stock.

Packaging
2007/08 was a relatively good year across our Packaging
activity. Despite signiﬁcant cost pressure, we advanced in
all three segments. The improved results were built around
cost recovery through better pricing but this would not have
been possible without our close attention to providing good
customer care and high service levels. It was pleasing to 
see the growth coming through in the targeted higher 
value-added sectors of our businesses, a result of our
improved product and market development capability
supported by focused capital investment. 
In the year, we made a major acquisition to support 
the development of our capability in lightweight CCM at
Kemsley Mill, we strengthened our position in promotional
packaging through the acquisition of Multigraphics and we
extended our network of packaging converting operations
in eastern Europe through establishing new manufacturing
facilities. We also strongly supported our Ukrainian
associate in its substantial development programme.
UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging
In 2007/08, the UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging
segment, which accounts for 38% of Group revenue 
and 52% of Group average capital employed, achieved 
a £32.0 million improvement in adjusted operating proﬁt 
to £68.5 million and an adjusted return on average 
capital employed of 14.3%. All three elements of the 
supply chain in this segment – Severnside Recycling, 
St Regis Paper and DS Smith Packaging – contributed 
well to the improved result.
Our programme to raise prices enabled us largely to
recover the previously incurred higher input costs although
further increases in energy costs are maintaining the
pressure on margins.
Severnside Recycling, which supplies the waste paper raw
material for our own recycled paper mills, continued to
develop the services it provides to third parties to generate
additional revenue from its waste collection network and
recycling expertise. Our UK paper business continued to
focus on raising the operational performance of its mills 
and the development of plasterboard liner sales. In our 
UK corrugated packaging business, we beneﬁted further
from our capability to service the market competitively with
value-added products from our conventional box plant
network and our group of speciality corrugated businesses.
The investment and product development effort we have
targeted at the growing retail-ready and decorative
packaging sectors contributed strongly to our success. 
In February 2008, we announced our plan to produce 
high-quality lightweight CCM at Kemsley Mill through 
the acquisition and subsequent modiﬁcation of the adjacent
New Thames Paper Mill. The entire project is expected to
cost circa £104 million, funded from the Group’s existing
debt facilities. Work is already well advanced on the
modiﬁcation of the facilities and we plan to commence
production of lightweight CCM in January 2009. This
investment will materially strengthen the long-term
competitiveness of our UK Paper and Corrugated 
Packaging business by giving us, at a very advantageous
investment cost, a signiﬁcant capability in an important
growth segment of the CCM market. It demonstrates our
commitment to developing our UK business and reinforces
the Group’s position as a leader in meeting the growing
demand for high-quality lighter-weight corrugated
packaging. The project is expected to generate good
ﬁnancial returns in its ﬁrst full year of operation (2009/10)
and provide very good returns for shareholders in the
longer-term.
Having raised the level of ﬁnancial returns in UK Paper and
Corrugated Packaging to a more satisfactory level, we are
now focused on sustaining an improved level of returns from
this segment over the business cycle. As we start the ﬁnancial
year, the strength of the euro is assisting our competitiveness
and pricing but we are faced with some slowing in demand,
continued high waste paper costs, further rises in energy costs
and lower paper prices on the continent; although we expect
margins in our Paper business to be under pressure, we will
drive for further progress in our recycling and converted
packaging operations.
Continental European Corrugated Packaging 
Despite facing signiﬁcantly higher input costs, this segment
achieved improved results with operating proﬁt increasing
to £20.3 million (2006/07: £18.2 million). Our businesses
in the established markets of France and Italy performed
creditably, assisted by their attention to raising productivity
and their focus on higher value-added sectors of the market,
such as heavy-duty packaging. As indicated at the half-year,
results were poor in Turkey, where market conditions were
tough; we are implementing an extensive action plan to
rebuild proﬁts. By contrast, our developing Polish business
made further strong progress due to a combination of good
growth and an increased proportion of higher value-added
product in our sales mix. The high-quality operation that we
have developed in Poland provides us with a good hub
from which to develop in central and eastern Europe. We
already have satellite operations in three countries and 
will be seeking to extend our network of businesses in 
this region as well as developing further in Poland.
Results at our Ukrainian associate business were adversely
affected by a major ﬁre; its performance is now recovering.
Its investment programme, designed to raise capacity 
and extend its product range, is progressing; we have
established a good capability in the fast-growing market 
of plasterboard liner. 
In Continental European Corrugated Packaging we are
faced with higher energy costs and softer demand as we
start 2008/09. We will maintain our focus on the higher
value-added sectors of the market and the opportunities
presented by our developing markets. 
Plastic Packaging
Plastic Packaging achieved a solid advance in adjusted
operating proﬁt to £10.7 million (2006/07: £10.2 million).
Good progress in RTP and the division’s two smaller
businesses was partly offset by weaker results in liquid
packaging and dispensing.
In RTP, beverage crate sales were strong as a result of 
the fulﬁlment of several large contracts and the success of
new products. The extruded products businesses recovered
some of the higher costs of polymer and beneﬁted from 
our previous actions to strengthen the sales and product
development functions; we have good opportunities for
further sales development based on new products and our
growing presence in eastern Europe. In liquid packaging
and dispensing, proﬁt margins in both taps and bags were

affected by competitive pressures. The USA business
beneﬁted from the introduction of new products and the
development of new markets; this progress was more than
offset by weaker results in the European business due to
continuing competitive pressures. The programme for
implementing the restructuring of our German bag-in-box
operations has been agreed with our employees and is 
due to be completed by April 2009.
The smaller packaging management and modiﬁed
atmosphere packaging businesses both achieved 
good proﬁt improvement.
Polymer costs have recently risen again; a priority for the
coming year will be the mitigation of these higher input
costs. We expect developments in new products and 
new market sectors to assist us in this objective. 
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling
The signiﬁcant improvement in this segment’s results was 
in line with our three-year plan, initiated in 2006/07, to
rebuild proﬁts. Adjusted operating proﬁt increased by 
£7.3 million to £20.1 million due to advances in both 
the UK and continental Europe. 
In Spicers UK, our programme of actions resulted in
improved service levels as we moved through 2007/08,
reaching a good level as we exited the ﬁnancial year. 
The strong sales growth was all in electronic ofﬁce supplies
(EOS) products, which reﬂects a deliberate move to support
our dealers in these products. The proportion of EOS in our
sales mix now more closely reﬂects that of the market as a
whole and we will look to grow our sales of both EOS and
non-EOS product as we develop the business. Costs were
lowered in the distribution network through the closure of
the Park Royal distribution centre. Our e-commerce system
has been strengthened further and is providing a good
basis for competitive advantage. Our UK action programme
is being reinforced to ensure the achievement of our
targeted further progress in this important business.
In our continental European businesses, which account 
for circa 50% of Spicers’ total revenue, the established
French and Benelux businesses again performed well, 
while our businesses in Germany, Spain and Italy each
achieved signiﬁcant goals in their development plans. 
The growth of the Italian business, ahead of its plan, 
is particularly encouraging. 
Spicers has been well received when it has entered new
continental European markets. The size of its product range,
its purchasing power and its service offering enable dealers
to compete more effectively in the market, thus boosting
sales in the dealers’ distribution channel. The performance
of our continental European development businesses has
further reinforced our conﬁdence in the potential for the
Spicers business model across Europe.
Our objective for Spicers is to maintain progress on 
two fronts: continuing the rebuilding of proﬁts at Spicers 
UK and developing further our existing continental
European network.
Our People
The considerable advances in the Group’s operational
performance and our substantially improved results have
been achieved through the skills, ideas and hard work 
of our employees. When I visit any of our businesses I 
am hugely impressed by the extent of the commitment,
enthusiasm and creativity demonstrated by our people. 
I am grateful to them for their enormous contribution to 
the success of the Group.
Outlook 
The 2007/08 result provides a good proﬁt base. The
current ﬁnancial year’s operating performance will be
affected by slowing demand and higher input costs. We
expect to partly offset the effect of this tougher trading
environment through tight cost and cash discipline 
across all our operations and continued progress in our
strengthened Packaging converting and Ofﬁce Products
Wholesaling businesses. We remain on track to commission
our new lightweight paper machine in January 2009. As
expected, proﬁt before tax in 2008/09 will be impacted 
by a non-cash increase of circa £10 million in the ﬁnance
costs related to the employment beneﬁt ﬁnance charge.

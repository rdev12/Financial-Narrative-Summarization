 01 Cape plc Annual Report 2009 Trusted
Build
Cape provides access, insulation, refractory 
services, ﬁ reprooﬁ ng and coatings during 
the initial build phase. In recent years, Cape 
has established an unrivalled reputation in 
the construction of Liquiﬁ ed Natural Gas 
(LNG) facilities. This is supported by the fact 
that Cape has been involved in the build 
and maintenance of 70% of the world’s LNG 
exporting facilities.
Maintenance
Following the construction phase, Cape is 
often retained by plant operators to maintain 
the asset. Cape provides a wide range 
of essential non-mechanical services to 
support client maintenance and shutdown 
programmes on typically 3-7 year contracts.
Extension of life
As an industrial asset gets older, 
Cape will work closely with the client 
on rejuvenation projects, to devise a 
strategy to extend its useful life.
Decommissioning
Cape’s expertise and broad range of 
services makes Cape the contractor of 
choice to support decommissioning 
and asset abandonment activities.

 10 Patsystems plc I Annual Report & Accounts 2008
I am delighted to report a 
strong set of results for the 2008 
financial year which have been 
achieved against a backdrop of 
significant change in our markets 
and the overall economic turmoil. 
I believe this demonstrates the 
fundamental strength of both 
our business and business model.
At the half year results,  
I commented that sales wins 
expected in the first half of  
the year had crystallised later 
than expected. I am pleased  
to confirm that the confidence 
I expressed in our sales pipeline 
was well founded and that 
market expectations have  
been fully achieved.
t he recurring nature of a 
substantial proportion of 
our trading systems revenue 
combined with continued growth 
in demand for our post-trade 
risk product, Risk Informer, has 
delivered both revenue growth 
and a robust cash position for 
the business. we have continued 
to add new customers as well 
as developing further our 
relationships with existing clients.
Cash flows from operating activities 
amounted to £3.6 million compared 
to £2.6 million in 2007; we expect  
this level of cash generation to 
continue in the forthcoming 
year. the year end cash balance 
stood at £5.9 million (2007:  
£3.2 million) and the business 
remains debt free.

31 December 2008 increased  
to £3.7 million compared to  
£3.0 million in 2007. Adjusted 
pre-tax profit is the definition 
of profit used by analysts to

share from 1.7p per share last

87% of revenue in 2008 was  
of a recurrent nature compared 
to 83% in 2007, demonstrating 
the inherent strength of the 
Patsystems business model. t his 
provides an excellent basis up 
on which to develop and plan 
the growth of the business. 
DIvIDEnD
Following the dividend of 
0.21p per share, approved by 
shareholders at the Annual 
general meeting on 17 April 
2008, relating to the results 
for 2007, the Board declared 
an interim dividend of 0.126p, 
payable in september 2008, 
based on the interim results 
for the year.
Patsystems is expected to 
continue to generate resilient 
positive operating cash flow in 
2009 and beyond, in light of 
this, and combined with our 
strong year end cash position, 
the Board is recommending the 
payment of a final dividend of 
0.237p based on the results for 
2008 as a whole, bringing the 
total dividend for the year to 
0.363p per share, compared to 
a total of 0.33p for 2007. this 
gives a year on year growth 
of 10% in our dividend.

As he set out in last year’s Annual 
Report, stewart millman stood

from the Board of Patsystems at the 
Annual general meeting last year. 
I should like to thank stewart on

for his substantial contribution to 
the growth and development of 
Patsystems; he left the business 
profitable, cash generative and 
well-placed to take advantage of 
the many business opportunities 
available. I greatly respect stewart’s 
advice and guidance and wish 
him every success with the many 
other ventures I know he intends 
to be involving himself with.
I should also like to thank steve

their support during my first

their business experience and 
wise counsel has been particularly 
beneficial during a challenging

t he ongoing support of our 
customers is fundamental to the 
success and growth of the business. 
I am delighted that in addition 
to existing customers extending 
their use of Patsystems’ products 
and services during the year 
we have also added a breadth 
of new customers across all the 
markets in which we operate. 
I would also like to thank our 
shareholders for their continued 
support particularly when equity 
valuations have been subject to 
the vagaries of volatile market 
sentiment. I believe the result 
for 2008 and the prospects for 
the business in 2009 justify their 
confidence and support  
in Patsystems.

a strong sales pipeline with 
a number of major business 
opportunities that are expected 
to be signed during the first half 
of 2009 and will benefit the result 
for this current financial year.
with the high visibility that 
results from our recurring 
revenue base, combined with 
a strong well qualified sales 
pipeline, we remain positive 
that despite the general 
economic outlook we expect 
the business to continue to 
grow in 2009. 
the business is also expected 
to continue to be strongly 
cash generative during 2009 
and the Board believes we are 
well positioned to weather the 
present economic uncertainties.

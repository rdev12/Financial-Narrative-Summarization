 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Principal Activities 
During 2015 the operational performance of the 
business was in line with expectations. Group 
revenue for the year was £12,477 ,000 (2014: 
£13,684,000). The Group reported a loss before 
tax of £2,711,000 for the year after incurring a 
charge of £2,770,000 related to the write-off of 
certain capitalised software developments (2014: 
£1,951,000 loss before tax after providing for 
£813,000 of impairment charges on the Linford 
Wood property). Excluding the charge, operating 
profit before tax was £59,000 (2014: loss before 
tax £1,138,000).
The basic loss per share was 6.05p (2014: basic loss per 
share 4.90p). Excluding the charge, basic profit per share was 
1.55p (2014: basic loss per share 2.34p). Cash holdings at the 
end of 2015 were £1,923,000 (2014: £3,612,000). The Board 
recommends that no final dividend be paid (2014: nil).
As expected, the UK examination marking market broadly 
stabilised in 2015, as there have been no further structural 
changes in UK qualifications of the type seen in 2014. 
Economic conditions in overseas markets, notably in 
Africa, have continued to be challenging, driving further 
reductions in the Group’s traditional markets for scanners 
and print. Cost saving measures introduced as a response 
to the reduced activity levels were sufficient to stabilise the 
business and underpin the Group’s operational performance.
In the Education market, revenue amounted to £12,287,000 
(2014: £13,027 ,000), a decline of 5.7%. Within that total 
amount, the revenue attributable to e-Marker® in the UK 
and overseas was stable at £9,344,000 (2014: £9,301,000).
In non-Education markets no revenue for large-scale 
Elections and Census projects was recognised during 2015: 
non-Education revenue for the year totalled £190,000 
(2014: £657,000).
In January 2016, the Group reported a change in the 
treatment of capitalised development expenditure relating 
to the new e-Marker® examination software product. 
Historically, development expenditure relating to the 
new e-Marker® examination software product has been 
capitalised on the balance sheet in accordance with the 
requirements of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. A year-end 
review led the Group to conclude that under IAS 38 
and IAS 36, the previously capitalised expenditure of 
£2,770,000 built up since May 2012 should be expensed 
to the Income Statement as the criteria for capitalisation 
was no longer met. The need to develop a broader set of 
features to meet market needs, combined with increasingly 
challenging international market conditions, resulted in the 
deferral of projected annual revenue expectations which 
are used to support the carrying value of the asset, hence 
this resultant change in accounting treatment. This change 
will result in future expenditure on development of the new 
e-Marker® product being charged to the Income Statement 
as it is incurred.

I am delighted to have joined DRS at a key stage in its 
development. The focus on project management and 
developing stronger relationships with major clients are 
key to the delivery of our strategy. The ongoing attention 
to cost management supports our ability to invest in 
developing software, hardware and services to support both

Education market.
Outlook
Going forward the Group remains committed to its strategy 
of being a leading provider of examination processing 
data capture and marking software and services and the

In the coming year the UK examination marking market is

markets are expected to continue to be challenging for the 
foreseeable future. With cost saving measures continuing to 
be a focus, the outlook for the financial year is expected to be 
broadly in line with the prior year.

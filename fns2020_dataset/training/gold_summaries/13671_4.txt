Royal Mail Group Limited
Annual Report and special purpose Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013
Financial performance 
overview
Reported Group revenue was £9,279 million.
 
See KPIs pages 12-13
Group revenue increased by five per cent on a like-for-like basis with the key 
performance drivers being: 
 – Letters revenue up three per cent.
 – UKPIL parcel revenue up 13 per cent.
 – GLS Euro revenue up two per cent.
• Operating costs have increased by three per cent on a like-for-like basis, 
benefiting from productivity improvements and tight cost management.
• Operating profit after transformation costs before other exceptional items 
of £403 million is £251 million higher than last year, mainly due 
to revenue growth. 
• Other net exceptional items comprise profit from property disposals (last year 
saw significant profit on disposals), property write-offs, industrial diseases 
provisions, Postal Services Act related costs and IT costs relating to the 
separation of Post Office Limited. 
• The current year taxation charge effective rate of 12 per cent is due to the 
charge on current year profit being partly offset by past years’ losses.
• The Group has recognised a deferred taxation asset, primarily in respect of 
taxation losses carried forward and decelerated capital allowances. This is a 
result of an improved profit outlook for the Group.

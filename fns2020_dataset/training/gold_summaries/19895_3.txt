 2003 was a year of substantial
progress in building our platform,
such that we are now
approaching an appropriate level
of scale to enable us to focus
greater attention on increasing
returns, reducing costs and
improving quality standards, 
in products and services.
By September 2004, we will be
serving the accommodation
needs of over 26,000 students in
28 cities, an increase of over 75%
since January 2003. T aking into
account our investments over this
period, we consider that the
business is, as planned, now
reaching a scale commensurate
with its infrastructure. As a result
the Board now intends to move
the emphasis of its strategy away
from the debt funded annual roll
out of a targeted number of beds
to focus on optimising the value
of UNITE's unique portfolio. 
This will be done through
maximising the rental potential of
our properties; through focusing
future developments on those
cities where we consider the
opportunities within a balanced
portfolio to be most attractive;
and through seeking funding
opportunities other than
straightforward debt ﬁnance, for
example through selective asset
disposals and joint ventures. In
line with our market opportunity
our annual roll out programme will
still be signiﬁcant; in addition to
the 5,104 bed spaces to be
delivered in 2004, we anticipate a
similar number being delivered in
2005. We believe that this
strategy will provide the most
attractive returns to shareholders
over time.
An important objective in 2003
was to put in place the ﬁnal
elements of funding for our
development programme, without
further recourse to equity markets.
I am pleased to report that this
was achieved. With the recent
establishment of a new £100
million warehouse facility in
addition to our existing borrowing,
UNITE is now fully funded to build
out and reﬁnance its development
commitments. In light of this
increase in bank facilities and the
lower capital requirements of our
revised strategy, the Board does
not consider it necessary to
undertake a major capital
recycling transaction at this time.
We remain committed to the
undertaking made at the time of
the last equity fund raising in 2002
not to raise further equity to
ﬁnance expansion.
With our large and increasing
customer base, UNITE's mission
has evolved to becoming the ﬁrst
choice in the student
accommodation market. T o that
end, we have set out three
imperatives on which to be
judged, namely to provide:
■ our customers with great value
and service;
■ our people with challenging,
meaningful and rewarding
careers; and
■ our shareholders with
continually improving 
ﬁnancial returns.
A clear strategy to maximise
the value of our portfoilio

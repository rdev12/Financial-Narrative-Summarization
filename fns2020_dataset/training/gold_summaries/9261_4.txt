Lamprell  
at a Glance
Lamprell is located in the UAE in the Arabian 
Gulf, one of the most important oil and gas 
regions in the world. The Group has four 
facilities in three locations in the UAE and a 
facility in Thailand. The development of a new 
much larger facility in the Hamriyah Free 
Zone, in the UAE is underway. 
Jebel Ali 
The facility occupies an area of 
178,900m² that includes more than 
16,000m² of covered work spaces 
with internal overhead cranes 
suitable for carrying out fabrication 
and assembly activities under cover. 
The covered areas also contain the latest 
welding and CNC cutting machinery. This 
protected work environment is cooler, 
safer and more productive than an 
outside location, and it allows the 
production of a higher quality product at 
less cost. The yard was designed to allow 
optimum production based on a clear 
and logical flow of material through the 
facility. In addition to the covered 
fabrication areas it has extensive open 
fabrication areas that are equipped with 
gantry and mobile crawler cranes. 
Oilfield Engineering 
The Oilfield Engineering facility 
was completed in 2005 and is a 
purpose-built facility located within 
the boundaries of the Jebel Ali 
facility. The Oilfield Engineering 
facility is accredited with  
all relevant API licences  
and certifications. 
In addition to the covered fabrication 
areas it has extensive open fabrication 
areas that are equipped with gantry and 
mobile crawler cranes. These open areas 
are used to assemble the final structures. 
There are also first class project, 
production, engineering and client offices 
for more than 300 people at the facility.
Lamprell’s Jebel Ali facility was purpose 
built in 2002 and is one of the most 
modern in the region. It is located in the 
Jebel Ali Free Zone and is 25km from  
the centre of Dubai.

Business overview
Hamriyah 
This 51,000m² portside facility  
has direct quayside access.  
This facility primarily undertakes 
jackup rig upgrade and 
refurbishment projects together 
with new build projects.
The core workforce at this facility as with 
both the Sharjah and the Jabel Ali 
facilities workforce is supplemented from 
the local labour market when required to 
meet the demands of specific projects.
New facility 
When completed the new facility will have 
a developed area of 250,000m
2
 with a 
deepwater berthing quay wall 1,250m in 
length and 9m deep. This will enable 
Lamprell to work on up to 10 rigs and 
simultaneously construct up to three new 
build jackups.
Sharjah 
Lamprell’s facility in Sharjah is 
located in Port Khalid, a designated 
free zone, and it has 360m of direct 
quayside access at which the 
majority of Lamprell’s jackup rig 
upgrade and refurbishment 
projects are executed. 
The facility has a total surface area of 
36,000m² that includes 28,000m² of  
open fabrication areas that are serviced 
by mobile crawler cranes and tower 
cranes, as well as 3,500m² of covered 
fabrication areas. Lamprell’s senior 
management team and the service 
departments such as finance, human 
resources and procurement are all 
located at the Sharjah facility.
Thailand 
Five year lease for a 46,950m² 
facility with 158m of exclusive 
deep water quayside in Sattahip, 
Thailand, in May 2008.
The Company believes this expansion 
provides an excellent opportunity to 
transfer the skills and reputation Lamprell 
has built over many years, through its 
operations in the United Arab Emirates,  
to a region which offers a significant  
fleet of jackup drilling rigs owned by 
predominantly the same group of clients 
that operate in the Middle East. 
The yard has been granted necessary 
operating licences and has commenced 
commercial operations.

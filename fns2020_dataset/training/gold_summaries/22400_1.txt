Investment platforms




























Investment report
















Our strategy, which remains 
unchanged, is to invest 
in alternative investment 
platforms where we see 
opportunities for creating 
shareholder value and co-invest 
with experienced management 
teams, provide them with seed 
funding to get started and then 
seek third party funding to 
facilitate their growth.

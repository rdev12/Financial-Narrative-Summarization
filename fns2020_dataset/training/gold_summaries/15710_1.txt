Chief Executive’s Statement
2006 has been very encouraging with a number
of large projects awarded to Tikit.
Operating review
All parts of the business made positive
contributions to the Group’s results in
2006. The Group currently operates and
is managed across three co-ordinated
business streams: Consultancy,
Managed Services and Software Sales.
Clients are delivered an integrated
solution based upon a managed blend
of these three areas of expertise.
The table below summarises Group
sales by business category.
Consultancy
Tikit continues to be the leading
provider of Document Management
(DM) systems to large law firms and
undertook consultancy assignments
with over fifty clients in the year
including major projects at Simmons
and Simmons, Slaughter and May, SJ
Berwin and Bevan Brittan. New
document management systems were
also implemented at two large Scottish
firms: Shepherd and Wedderburn and
Andersen Strathern.
Our Client Relationship Management
(CRM) team undertook assignments at
over sixty clients during 2006 with
major projects at Simmons and
Simmons and SJ Berwin in the UK and
De Brauw in Holland. This team has also
had significant success in the
accountancy arena, completing a major
project at Grant Thornton, utilising both
Tikit’s own eMarketing Solution and

LexisNexis’ InterAction software. Our
CRM system is deployed across Grant
Thornton’s 32 UK offices, totalling some
1,600 users. In addition, Tikit undertook
extensions to the CRM systems installed
at Ernst & Young offices, both in the UK
and Australia. A significant number of
these projects also benefited from the
data auditing and cleansing expertise of
the Shamrock team.
Shamrock have also been adding value
to our accounting and legal clients by
providing outsourced marketing
campaign activities.
Our Practice Management Systems
(PMS) group are recognised experts in
the back-office systems upon which law
firms are reliant. They have undertaken
a number of assignments to help clients
implement PMS systems and, for HM
Government’s Treasury Solicitors, have
installed a new Time Recording system
for over 500 users, based upon the
Sage Carpe Diem system. They have had
early success with Redwood software,
sold exclusively by Tikit in the UK, for
financial planning and budgeting, with
installations under way at Clarke
Willmott, CMS Cameron McKenna and
SJ Berwin.
Tikit is continuing its strong alliance with
Microsoft. We are a Microsoft Gold
certified partner , as well as recently
being awarded our fifth competency, the
Information Worker Solutions
accreditation, in recognition of our
expertise with implementations of
platforms such as SharePoint and
Office. We are currently developing an
innovative portal solution in conjunction
with Eversheds and Microsoft using
Share point and Handshake software,
which we expect to be applicable across
a wide number of professional firms.
A web-based portfolio control and billing
workflow system (developed by Tikit)
has achieved wide adoption at
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer . This
project not only shows Tikit’s
understanding of law firm processes but
also its versatility in creating a new
process flow that integrates a range of
existing applications.
Managed services
Good progress is being made in the
provision of outsourced, infrastructure
support services to law firms through
our Network and Infrastructure Support
(NIS) division. Historically specialising in
the accountancy sector , NIS has, this
year , won large projects with Brabner
Chaffe Street and Dickinson Manser in
the legal sector as well as continuing its
business with the large accountancy
practices. The major work in 2006 has
been a number of complete server
refresh projects incorporating Microsoft
Exchange and full security and network
management implementations. Of
particular note is the exciting project at
Chantry Vellacott which will be
implemented in 2007 and which will
standardise IT systems across all six UK
offices.

The acquisitions we made in 2005 have
performed well.
Recent improvements to our document
editing and classification service in
Yorkshire, which provides clients with a
cost effective way of classifying their
key documents to enhance the value of
their knowledge management systems,
is delivering greater benefit to both Tikit
and its clients.
Software sales
2006 has been very encouraging with a
number of large projects awarded to
Tikit, many of which were tendered for
in 2005. Total revenues for the year
ended 31 December 2006 from all
software sales were £7 .4 million (2005:
£5.7 million), an increase of 30% on the
prior year .
We are Interwoven’s preferred partner
in the legal and accountancy market
sector , being awarded their Global
Partner of the Year award for the
second year running. The recent
announcement of Tikit signing its one-
hundredth Interwoven WorkSite client
illustrates our continued success in
this area.
Tikit has invested resources into several
other new technologies such as iBox, a
new indexing and search tool which
combines taxonomy management,
browsing and searching in a new way
especially suited to use by law firms, and
is undertaking a pilot implementation at
one of the UK’s largest law firms.
Another such initiative is with
Microsystems D3, which provides clients
with software and a service to ensure
that working documents are stripped of
unnecessary metadata and that styles
and formatting are consistent. Early
adopter projects are already underway
with a number of clients.
Product development
In conjunction with third-party software
products, Tikit has developed a number
of software application packages, which
typically provide additional functionality
in key application areas. One of these
products, the eMarketing Solution
(which includes E-Merge and ReAction
Server) is now installed in 152 clients
worldwide with sales secured not only in
the UK but also in the USA, Canada,
Ireland and Australia. We achieved sales
of £734,000 of our own IPR in the year
(2005: £660,000).

13534TIKITGRO:13534TIKITGRO  12/4/07  08:41  Page 14 Following on from the success of the
eMarketing Solution we have recruited
extra people to provide more focus on
creating and developing more Tikit own
brand software products. These
products will provide further
functionality and management to key
application areas within law firms and
will initially be aimed at Interwoven
WorkSite and Microsoft Word.
Overseas
The French subsidiary, LecSoft, is
developing well, with a particularly
strong performance in the second half
of the year . Our Spanish operation
continues to focus on gaining market
share, presence and reputation and
made a small contribution to profits in
2006. Total overseas sales including our
operations in France and Spain
accounted for 22% of sales in the year
ended 31 December 2006.
Summary
Overall Tikit had a very good year
operationally and the acquisitions that
we made in 2005 have performed well.
Tikit operates in a market where people
and their relationships are absolutely
critical to the success of the business
and the quality of the newer people
coming into Tikit together with the
enthusiasm and support from Tikit’s
existing staff has enabled the business
to be significantly stronger than at the
same time last year . I would therefore
like to thank every employee of Tikit for
contributing to the success we enjoyed
in 2006.

8 TUI Travel PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Our statutory profit before tax (PBT) has 
increased 40% in the year from £144m to 
£201m and our statutory earnings per 
share (EPS) rose 62% from 7.7p to 12.5p. 
These results prove that we have the right 
strategy and are executing it well.

The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 8.3p per share (2011: 8.0p). 
On 8 May 2012, the Board recommended 
an interim dividend of 3.4p per share

a progressive dividend policy and will look 
to maintain underlying dividend cover at

Sustainable development
Our vision is to make travel experiences 
special whilst minimising environmental 
impact, respecting culture and people, and 
bringing economic benefit to communities. 
During the year we launched our three-year 
Sustainable Holidays Plan highlighting our 
continued commitment to sustainable 
development. The plan highlights significant 
integration of environmental and social 
principles into the way we do business. 
Achieving our vision is critical to the future 
health of our own business, the wider 
industry, the customers we serve and the 
communities they visit.
Colleagues
The record performance that we have 
achieved this year comes down to one  
thing in particular, our colleagues. Across 
the world, 54,000 people strive to make  
our strategy come to life and it is their 
commitment, passion and ambition  
that results in the ultimate success of  
our business. We aim to make travel 
experiences special. A large number of our 
colleagues are customer facing and it is 
their service that makes the difference 
between a good holiday and a great one. 
The Board and I would like to personally 
thank each and every one of our colleagues 
for their continuing commitment and hard 
work.
Dr Michael Frenzel
Non-Executive Chairman
2012 has been a record year for our 
business. We are pleased to be 
reporting a 4% increase in underlying 
operating profit for the full year to 
£490m (2011: £471m). This is even 
more impressive against a backdrop of 
global economic uncertainty, political 
turmoil, weak consumer sentiment, the 
Eurozone crisis, natural catastrophes 
and downgrades to forecasts across 
numerous consumer industries.
Underlying operating profit
+4%
The travel and tourism industry has 
grown by an average of 4% every year 
since 1995. This year is no different 
with the number of international 
arrivals set to reach one billion in 2012. 
The market today is directly worth  
over US$2 trillion to global GDP and 
supports 98 million jobs worldwide. 
By offering our customers exactly  
what they want, not what we think they 
need, we are very well positioned to 
benefit from the size and growth of  
this vast industry in the long-term.
Results
The Group has achieved record results this 
year. Whilst we have witnessed a slight 
decrease in revenue to £14,460m (2011: 
£14,687m), mainly due to foreign exchange 
translations following the Eurozone crisis, 
we have seen record underlying operating 
profit increase 4% to £490m (2011: £471m). 
Underlying profit before tax is up 8% to 
£390m (2011: £360m) for the full year 
whilst underlying basic earnings per share 
increased by 9% to 25.8p (2011: 23.6p).

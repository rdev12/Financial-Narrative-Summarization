Johnston Press plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 200409
The vast majority of Johnston Press
titles are now printed in house at one
of 13 regional centres that are
managed centrally by the Group’s
Printing Division. This centralised
management control increases the
efficiency of the Group’s printing
operations as it ensures that specific
titles are produced at the most
appropriate centre thereby maximising
colour revenue potential and the
utilisation of the Group’s total printing
capacity. In addition, the operation 
of a relatively small number of larger
scale printing centres provides the
basis for tight cost control and
excellent operational efficiency. 
Regional printing centres
Johnston Press continues to invest
heavily in further enhancing its printing
capability and in part this investment
has focused on the deployment of
greater revenue generating colour
capacity. The £60 million investment 
in the development of a brand new
facility near Sheffield and the proposal
to spend more than £45 million on 
a similar plant in Portsmouth will
improve the overall efficiency of the
Group’s printing operations.
Johnston Press also continues to
invest significantly in the development
of Group-wide IT systems in order to
consolidate what was once a disparate
range of company-specific systems.
As well as improving levels of
customer care, this investment also
helps drive business efficiency and
productivity. In addition, the
introduction of common systems
facilitates the offer of extended title
packages to advertisers and this 
in turn will drive revenue growth in 
the future.

Chairman’s Statement
Continued progress
2004 was a year of organic growth and continued
progress for Johnston Press. The Group achieved
record results in terms of sales, margins, profits,
earnings per share, dividends and cash generation. 
The continuing success of Johnston Press stems from
a single-minded focus on providing local communities
with news, information and entertainment. The staff 
of Johnston Press have, once again, shown themselves
to be amongst the best in the business and, on behalf 
of the Board and shareholders, I would like to
congratulate them.
Results
Revenues grew in excess of 5% which was more than we
had expected, in part reflecting the success of new products
launched during the year. Tight cost control and some
continuing efficiencies from past acquisitions drove margins
and profits but the positive impact of recent investment in
printing and IT systems also helped. 
Operating profit for 2004 was £177.2 million, up 10%.
Headline earnings per share were 37.96p, up 17%.
Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend of 4.8p per share,
making a total of 7.2p per share for the year compared to 
6p per share last year. This is an increase of 20%. 
Organic Growth
In recent years, Johnston Press has made a number of
significant acquisitions. In 2004 we did not and all the growth
has come from organic developments. Within our existing
market areas, we have launched a number of new publications
including free newspapers, advertising-only publications and
lifestyle magazines. We have launched a number of locally
focused websites, upgraded our online classified platforms
and invested heavily in new colour printing capacity and IT
systems. During the year, we announced our commitment to
invest more than £60 million in a new print facility in Sheffield
and, in February 2005, we announced a similar initiative
costing more than £45 million at Portsmouth.
We have a clear focus on using investment to improve the
economics of our existing business.

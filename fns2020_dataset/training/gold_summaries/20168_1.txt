CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
 “ This has been a strong year for 3i with all 
three of our businesses performing well.  
We have reshaped our business model 
and our shareholders are benefiting from 
attractive returns and dividends. We look 
forward with confidence.”
INTRODUCTION
We are now at the end of our three-year 
restructuring and have met or exceeded  
all of the priorities set out in our scorecard. 
Since 2012, we have made considerable 
progress by streamlining and refocusing  
3i into a more resilient business capable  
of generating long-term value through the 
economic cycle. This is reflected in this 
year’s strong performance and good 
progress against all of the Group’s KPIs 
over the last three years. 
This year’s financial results build on the momentum 
established last year. 3i generated a total shareholder 
return of 27%, compared to 6% for the FTSE 100. All three 
of our businesses performed well and contributed to the 
Group’s total return on shareholders’ funds of 20% (2014: 
16%) and 14% increase in NAV per share to 396p (31 March 
2014: 348p). The strong performance was achieved 
despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, with the 
euro alone depreciating by 13% against sterling, reducing 
the NAV per share by 12 pence.
HOW WE PERFORMED IN THE YEAR
Private Equity had another very successful year, 
generating a gross investment return of £719 million,  
or 24% on opening value (2014: £647 million, 24%).  
This reflected strong earnings growth and a flow of 
realisations ahead of our expectations at this time  
last year. Earnings growth of 19% was driven by our  
larger assets such as Action, Element and Basic-Fit,  
and a significant reduction in investments with  
declining earnings. 
During the year, our Private Equity team generated  
total proceeds of £831 million (2014: £669 million) from 
realisations. These included £155 million returned as a 
result of refinancings (2014: £59 million). Favourable debt 
markets have allowed us to enhance capital structures 
and introduce higher leverage in a number of our best 
performing and highly cash generative assets. Despite 
this, average debt to EBITDA within the portfolio remained 
stable at 3.1x (2014: 3.1x). Proceeds from refinancings  
are generally returned as a repayment of shareholder 
loans, and do not usually generate a profit over value. 
Excluding refinancings, we realised profits of £144 million 
over opening valuation, an overall uplift of 27%, from a 
combination of asset sales and IPOs (2014: £190 million, 
45%), including sales of Hilite at 2.1x and Vedici at 2.0x 
original cost. 
In particular, the sustained, constructive market backdrop 
for realisations has meant that we have made very good 
progress in selling some of our smaller, more challenged 
investments and the number of portfolio companies has 
reduced to 65 at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2014: 81).  
The sale of Azelis, signed in February 2015 and completed 
in May 2015, is an excellent example of the potential for 
recovery, when we are able to focus on more intensive 
asset management. Over the last few years we have 
changed the Chairman and management at Azelis  
and agreed a new plan and financial structure  
which has underpinned its successful recovery and exit.  
We recognised £40 million of value growth in the year  
against an opening value of £26 million at 31 March 2014.

In strong equity markets, we have also had the opportunity 
to IPO investments such as Eltel, Refresco and Phibro.  
We generated £273 million in proceeds from quoted equity 
sales at, or post, IPO. Strong performance from our quoted 
portfolio, including prior listings such as Quintiles, has 
meant that the Private Equity quoted portfolio generated 
£177 million in value growth and realised profits of 49% 
on the opening value.
Notwithstanding the strong overall performance, our 
portfolio companies are not immune to wider macro 
issues and we had to reduce the value of one investment 
materially during the course of the year. Inspecta, which 
had been impacted by the economic environment in 
Finland and Russia, declined in value by £32 million during 
the year. We announced the sale of Inspecta in April 2015 
and expect it to complete in the first half of FY2016,  
with proceeds in line with our 31 March 2015 valuation.
Although we have continued to be net divestors, we have 
maintained the investment momentum started in FY2014. 
Our approach remains selective, as the availability of 
competing capital can quickly move prices outside our 
target returns. However, our sector and market expertise 
has continued to deliver attractive opportunities during the 
year. We invested in two US headquartered businesses,  
Q Holding and Dynatect, and a UK business, Aspen Pumps, 
which have ambitious plans to grow internationally. 
Together with our Eurofund V investors, we also invested 
in Christ, a German-based jewellery retailer, alongside our 
existing investment in Amor. During the year our portfolio 
companies made over 20 acquisitions, representing a 
combined enterprise value of over €400 million, funded 
almost entirely out of the companies’ own finances. These 
acquisitions are an important part of building the strategic 
value of our portfolio companies, including delivering their 
international growth potential. In total we made cash 
investments of £457 million, of which £369 million was  
3i’s proprietary capital (2014: £372 million, £276 million). 
We continue to review a wide number of opportunities, but 
many are not pursued if we judge that the sale price is 
likely to move beyond where we see value.
Our longer term hold investments now account for 
approximately 50% of our portfolio value, and their strong 
performance, together with realisations, has led to 
material improvement in Eurofund V and the Growth 
Capital Fund, with multiples of 1.4x and 1.7x of invested 
capital respectively (31 March 2014: 1.1x, 1.3x respectively).
Infrastructure had a good year as gross investment return 
increased to £96 million, or 20% (2014: £2 million, 0%). The 
European portfolio continued to perform well and the 
dividends and advisory fees from 3iN generated a good 
level of cash income for the Group. 
3iN’s total shareholder return was 25% in the year, 
following the highly successful sale of its holding in 
Eversholt Rail. This transaction demonstrates how 
competitive the environment for large European Core 
infrastructure investments has become, as sovereign 
wealth and pension funds increase their investment 
appetite in the face of prolonged low interest rates. The 
team achieved a good level of new investment for 3iN, 
with £1 14 million of total investment commitments in the 
year (2014: £80 million). The Infrastructure team used its 
expertise gained through an existing investment in 
Oystercatcher and its strong relationship with Oiltanking 
to invest €107 million in two oil storage facilities in the 
Netherlands and Belgium. The team also completed five 
PPP deals, committing a total of £37 million. 
3iN has a portfolio of high quality Core infrastructure 
assets and this is reflected in significant increases in value 
in addition to Eversholt Rail. Core infrastructure accounted 
for 83% of 3iN’s total investments at 31 March 2015. 
3i has recognised £30 million of advisory and 
management fees (2014: £24 million) and £45 million of 
performance fees during the period (2014: nil). £35 million 
of these fees was accrued as carry payable to the 
investment team (2014: nil). This carry will be paid out to 
the team over a number of years.
The more favourable credit markets ensured that  
Debt Management had a good year of fundraising, 
launching six CLOs in Europe and North America and 
increasing AUM by 12% to £7 .2 billion (31 March 2014: 
£6.5 billion). The team also launched a European Middle 
Market Loan Fund with an investment mandate that 
permits a wider range of investments, typically investing in 
smaller businesses than CLOs. In the US, our Senior Loan 
Fund passed the $100 million milestone which has created 
more investor interest in the product. Both initiatives were 
important steps in diversifying the business beyond CLOs 
and generating additional fee income. In total, Debt 
Management recognised fee income of £34 million in 
FY2015 (2014: £32 million), as new fundraising offset the 
effect of the run-off of older funds. 
The CLO markets are subject to increased regulatory 
change. Regulators in Europe have mandated that CLO 
managers hold a minimum amount of capital investments 
in their products. The US market has introduced a similar 
practice although the corresponding legislation does not 
come into force until December 2016. 3i is well placed to 
comply with these changes given its proprietary capital.  
3i supported the development of the business and invested 
£79 million in new CLOs in the year (2014: £40 million). 
These equity investments generate a good cash yield 
which, together with the fee income, is an important 
component of our operating cash profit. 
Chief Executive’s review continued
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 06 STRATEGIC REPORT
In 2012 we were operating with a substantial annual 
operating cash loss and, as this was diluting capital 
returns to investors, we set a KPI to achieve an  
operating cash profit. We undertook a significant 
transformation programme, focusing on recurring fee 
income and operational efficiencies and as a result, in 
FY2014, we recorded a first annual profit of £5 million.  
This measure improved significantly to £28 million  
in FY2015. All of the businesses have contributed to 
increased cash income with additional fundraising in  
Debt Management and strong portfolio income from 
Private Equity and Infrastructure. Operating expenses  
also declined in FY2015 to £131 million or 1.0% of AUM 
(2014: £136 million, 1.0%). These costs included £12 million 
relating to acquisitions made since 2012 and £1 million  
of restructuring costs (2014: £6 million, £9 million).  
To reflect increased activity levels, we have recruited  
to support origination in both Private Equity and 
Infrastructure and fundraising in Debt Management.  
The Group has also now launched a Graduate Programme 
and will welcome its first graduates in the Autumn. 
Looking forward, further cost efficiencies are not expected 
and expenses will increase marginally as the businesses 
continue to grow. 
Maintaining the profitability of the combined fund 
management platform is a key component of operating 
cash profit. This measure improved in the year, as Debt 
Management’s fundraising offset the expected decline in 
Private Equity fees as a result of its strong realisations. 
Actual fund management profit grew strongly to 
£26 million, with a margin of 21% (2014: £19 million, 15%). 
Underlying profit, after restructuring and acquisition costs, 
was stable at £33 million, with a margin of 26% (2014: 
£33 million, 26%).
Reflecting our confidence in the future growth and cash 
generation capacity of the business, we have announced a 
final dividend ahead of our established guidance. We 
propose to pay a total dividend for the year of 20 pence per 
share (2014: 20 pence per share). This results in a final 
dividend for 2015 of 14.0p, subject to shareholder approval.
Our financial performance is reviewed in more detail on 
pages 21 to 32. 
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED IN THE LAST 
THREE YEARS
To strengthen 3i both commercially and financially,  
our emphasis has been on asset management, cash 
generation, cost control and fund management margins. 
We have now completed our transformation programme 
and our performance against our June 2012 objectives  
is summarised on the page overleaf and detailed below.
The six asset management initiatives were an essential 
part of the strategic plan as Private Equity is, and will 
continue to be, the biggest contributor to value growth for 
the Group. Since 2012 we have rebalanced the Private 
Equity business, selling off non-core or underperforming 
assets and refocusing on a smaller number of high growth 
middle-market companies. Over the longer term we aim to 
have a portfolio of fewer than 40 investments and, to date, 
we have made very good progress. The number of assets 
has reduced to 65 at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2012: 124) 
and 89% of assets by value are now held in our core 
geographies of northern Europe and North America 
(31 March 2012: 77%). The improvement in asset 
management is also producing quantifiable results.  
Unrealised value growth over the last three years has 
principally been driven by earnings which have improved 
to 19% in 2015 (2012: 9%). This was driven by excellent 
performance in our largest assets and a material 
reduction in smaller and non-core assets with negative 
earnings growth. 22% of the portfolio by value at 31 March 
2012 had negative earnings growth compared to 7% at 
31 March 2015. Early indications on the new investments 
made since 2012 are very promising. 
This stronger portfolio of assets was valued at an average 
of 10.5x EBITDA (post discount) at 31 March 2015 
compared to 14.6x EBITDA for the FTSE 250.
The Group’s AUM has increased by 9% per annum to 
£13.5 billion at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2012: £10.5 billion) 
predominantly driven by Infrastructure and Debt 
Management. Infrastructure acquired a PPP platform in 
2013, which is delivering deal flow to 3iN, and Debt 
Management expanded in the US via an acquisition in 2012. 
Debt Management, in particular, has successfully raised 
new funds in both Europe and the US in the last two years. 
A critical part of our strategic plan was to reduce the 
operating cost base in order to use shareholders’ capital 
for distribution or reinvestment. Against a March 2012 
run-rate cost base of £185 million, we achieved savings of 
£70 million and reduced costs to 1.0% of AUM (2012: 1.6%). 
Headcount reduced by 45% to 240 at 31 March 2015, 
excluding acquisitions, and 276 including acquisitions 
(31 March 2012: 435).

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 08 STRATEGIC REPORT
In 2012 we set out a target capital allocation model to 
rebalance returns to our investors. Over the last three 
years we have generated £2,124 million of realisation 
proceeds, invested £766 million in new Private Equity 
investments, and £189 million to support Debt 
Management fundraising. Following the reduction of gross 
debt of £542 million, we initiated an enhanced shareholder 
distribution policy in July 2013. Including the proposed final 
dividend for this year, we will have returned £506 million  
of dividends to shareholders, whilst reaching a net cash 
position and maintaining a robust balance sheet to support 
longer term net asset growth. 
At the end of our three-year restructuring, the Group 
has three diverse, but complementary, businesses 
underpinned by the expertise of our people and 
differentiated by our selective investment approach 
and disciplined focus on returns. 
OUR BUSINESS TODAY
Today 3i offers a differentiated and attractive value 
proposition. By combining proprietary capital investing  
and the management of third-party capital, our business 
model generates capital returns and recurring fund 
management income. 3i is the largest single investor in its 
Private Equity and Infrastructure funds and this ensures 
that the interests of our shareholders, our fund investors  
and co-investors are aligned. It also enables us to retain  
a material share of the “alpha-generating” returns from 
mid-market private equity and infrastructure investing. 
Recurring management fee income contributes to the 
financial resilience of the business and eliminates the 
capital dilution caused by the costs of running the 
business. Capital growth and regular dividends evidence 
our progress and provide long-term value for our 
shareholders.
In Private Equity, our strong international network of  
local investment teams and proven ability to develop 
businesses internationally allows us to build credibility 
with management and vendors. Our proprietary capital 
affords us flexibility and speed, which differentiates our 
competitive position. 
Combining our focus on driving operational excellence 
within our portfolio companies and an institutional 
approach to the process of investment management 
supports our strategic objective to achieve our target of 
at least 2x our money invested over three to five years. 
Monetary policy across the developed world has led  
to an abundance of equity and debt capital chasing  
a limited supply of investment opportunities. So the 
principal constraint on our activity is investment 
opportunity at sensible prices. We expect to invest  
in four to seven new investments a year and commit  
€500 – €750 million. But we will only do this if investments 
meet our demanding strategic and financial criteria.  
Given the strength of the Group’s financial position,  
and the scale of potential investment, we intend to fund 
this activity principally from proprietary capital.  
As a result, we have decided not to initiate a new  
third-party fundraising in the short to medium term, 
notwithstanding our improved performance. 
The impact of central bank intervention on sovereign 
wealth and pension fund managers’ appetite for 
infrastructure investing is expected to persist. Although 
the Infrastructure team is actively participating in bidding 
processes, our priority, as investment adviser to 3iN, is to 
maintain a disciplined approach to new investments.  
The team continues to monitor and review opportunities in 
adjacent markets, including new sectors and geographies. 
In the meantime, significant value growth in the existing 
portfolio is supporting 3iN’s NAV appreciation and the 
business will continue to be an important contributor  
to our fund management profitability and to operating 
cash profit. 
Our Debt Management business is principally a fund 
management platform; its calls on 3i’s proprietary capital 
are limited to regulatory requirements and seed capital for 
new product development. Aided by the positive market 
conditions throughout FY2014 and FY2015, our US and 
European teams were very successful in raising new 
funds. We expect this general environment to persist as 
banks continue to actively manage their lending exposures 
by syndicating assets to alternative funds such as CLOs. 
The current appetite for yield is also supportive for our 
new product offerings such as the European Middle 
Market Loan Fund and the US Senior Loan Fund.
OUTLOOK
3i is demonstrably a more resilient business, both 
commercially and financially, than it was when we started 
the restructuring three years ago. The focus we have 
placed on embedding institutional quality investment 
management processes throughout the businesses and 
our ongoing cost discipline has generated real results.  
We are confident that this, along with the expertise and 
integrity of our people, will underpin our aim to generate 
attractive shareholder returns through the cycle. 
None of this progress would have been possible without 
the dedication and hard work of the 3i team. I would like  
to thank them for their application and good work over the 
period to bring 3i back to today’s healthy position. I would 
also like to take this opportunity to thank Sir Adrian 
Montague, our departing Chairman. He has been a 
pleasure to work with over the last three years and he  
has revamped our Board in line with the restructuring  
of the Group. 
We look to the future with confidence in the knowledge 
that there is still much more to achieve at 3i.

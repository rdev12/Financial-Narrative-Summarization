Innovation
Customer focus and investment in  
engineering resources led to the successful 
launch of the WBH® pump, just one of  
a number of new or enhanced core 
product launches. 
Global Capability
Weir is committed to going where its  
customers are and growing its presence in 
fast growing markets. This was underscored 
by the acquisition of Seaboard and the 
acquisition of a majority stake in HIM Tech, 
as well as an expansion of the Group’s 
service footprint in all its end markets.
Collaboration
Weir’s collaborative mindset was further 
developed through a range of initiatives 
including a broadened shared engineering 
services capability in India, eliminating  
bottlenecks in product development.

Market overview 
Capital expenditure in the mining sector 
increased as miners broke ground on a 
number of greenfield developments and 
brownfield expansions. Activity levels 
increased strongly in South America, 
Australia and Asia-Pacific, while promising 
progress was seen in North America, 
Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 
Activity levels in Western Europe remained 
low due to macro economic concerns in 
the region.
Sustained high oil prices supported 
increased investment and activity levels  
in the North American oil sands market.
Weir Minerals is the global leader in the 
provision of slurry handling equipment and 
associated spare parts for abrasive high 
wear applications. Mining and minerals 
constitutes the division’s largest sector  
but it has aligned product sales into niche 
markets, including oil sands. Products 
include pumps, hydrocyclones, valves, 
dewatering equipment, wear resistant 
linings, rubber products and  
screening machines. 
The division has a presence in the world’s 
key mining markets including South 
America, Australia, Asia-Pacific,  
Africa and North America.

Market overview 
The North American upstream market 
experienced a second year of rapid growth, 
underpinned by increased horizontal drilling 
of oil and liquids rich shale formations. 
Average US horizontal rig count, a leading 
indicator of upstream pressure pumping 
demand, increased 22% on 2010, while 
greater operating efficiency resulted in  
an estimated 32% increase in horizontal 
wells drilled. 
Middle East services markets benefited 
from oilfield development in Iraq and Saudi 
Arabia while downstream markets continue 
to be challenging.
Weir Oil & Gas designs and manufactures 
pumps and ancillary equipment and 
provides aftermarket service and support 
activities principally for the upstream oil and 
gas markets. The acquisitions of Seaboard 
and Novatech expand the division’s 
conventional and unconventional upstream 
equipment product portfolio to include 
high-pressure wellhead equipment and a 
broadened range of aftermarket pressure-
pump expendable components.
The downstream business occupies 
a niche position in the design and 
manufacture of centrifugal pumps for 
the refining industry. The division’s main 
operations are in North America, Europe 
and the Middle East with an expanding 
footprint in Asia-Pacific and South America.

Market overview 
The global nuclear market, active in the  
early part of the year, slowed following the 
Fukushima reactor incident. Demand for 
original equipment and spares across 
European and US thermal power markets 
remained subdued although growth 
continued in emerging markets, particularly 
India. Activity picked up in the oil and gas 
markets with good project activity in the 
Middle East and Asia-Pacific. The North 
American hydro power market saw good 
levels of activity. While renewables markets 
remained challenging in Europe, a number  
of opportunities have emerged across South 
America and Africa. General industrial and 
municipal markets remained subdued while 
unrest in Libya led to the cessation of all 
project activity in February 2011.
Weir Power & Industrial designs and 
manufactures valves, pumps and turbines  
as well as providing specialist and support 
services to the global power generation, 
industrial and oil and gas sectors.  
The division has locations in Europe,  
the Middle East, North America, India,  
China, Asia-Pacific and South Africa. 
The division’s capability in emerging  
markets was strengthened in 2011 with the 
acquisition of a majority stake in HIM Tech,  
a valves manufacturer in South Korea.

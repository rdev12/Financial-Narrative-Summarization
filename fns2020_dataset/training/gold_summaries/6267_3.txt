CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
BUSINESS REVIEW
I am pleased to report continued
growth in sales, operating profit and
cash generation during the year.
Our strategy to increase the scale of
the Group both organically and by
acquisition has resulted in significant sales growth, cash
generation and improved profits.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Group has adopted International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the EU (“IFRS”) in these results for
the first time and the comparative figures have been
restated accordingly. The impact of adoption of IFRS on the
Group’s income statement for the period ended 31 August
2008 has been to increase the retained profit, as compared
to UK GAAP, by £259,000 (2007: £109,000) as a result of
the changes in accounting for employee benefits, business
combinations and lease inducements. 
Sales have risen by 29% to £14.8m compared with last
year. Operating profit has increased 258% to £666,000
(2007: £186,000). The profit before tax has increased by
201% to £454,000 (2007: £151,000).  Earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
were £1,139,000 (2007: £573,000). The retained profit for
the year was £324,000 (2007: £141,000) and the basic
earnings per share was 0.19p (2007: 0.10p).
The balance sheet remains strong with an increase in cash
during the year of £686,000 to £2,903,000  
(2007: £2,217,000) after repayment of bank loans and loan
notes of £732,000.
The directors do not propose a dividend. (2007: £ nil).
Average headcount for the year has increased from 105 to
137, with 140 at the year end.

UNICUS
The earn-out period relating to the acquisition of Unicus
Regulatory Services Limited ended on 31 July 2008. The
liability for deferred consideration has been increased from
£250,000 to £815,000, reflecting the strong 
post-acquisition performance of the business.
BOARD CHANGES
I informed the Board of my intention to stand down as
Chairman at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to
be held on 22nd December 2008. Mr Grahame Cook
joined the Board on 28 August 2008 as a non–executive
Director and Chairman designate. In addition, Mr Frank
Condella and Mr Ken Lacey joined the Board as non-
executive Directors on 25 September 2008. With these
additions, I am convinced Fulcrum Pharma has a strong
Board, capable of delivering the Company’s strategy.
I would also like to thank Dr Jon Court, who stepped 
down from the Board on 31 March 2008, for his years of
leadership of the Fulcrum Pharma business.
CONCLUSION
I am encouraged by the improved performance of the
Group in terms of operating profit and cash generation.
The Board remain committed to growing Fulcrum Pharma’s
professional services business both organically and by
acquisition.

To our shareholders, I am pleased to report 
on Archipelago’s affairs during 2012, in 
what was a transformational year for our 
Company. The Company achieved strong 
operational results at our Toka Tindung mine 
and grew the asset with material increases 
to our Resource and Reserve base. Our 
ﬁnancial results demonstrate our robust 
performance, with solid cash generation 
and proﬁts maintained throughout the 
period. We also made signiﬁcant progress  
in increasing the proﬁle of Archipelago  
in key capital markets.
With our core operation in North Sulawesi, 
Indonesia, Archipelago is clearly leveraged 
to one of the most dynamic business 
environments on the globe. With a 
population of 230 million people and  
GDP of greater than US$3,700 per capita, 
Indonesia continues to beneﬁt from a period 
of sustained and strong economic growth; 
centred on internal development and an 
increasingly prevalent middle class.
This trend is expected to continue over 
the next 10 years, which in turn will 
support further economic expansion and 
international investment in Indonesia – 
in particular in the resource sector, including 
precious metals. An increasingly educated 
and urbanized population will provide 
a strategic labour force in centres of 
investment, with mining regarded as a  
key industry in this context. Throughout the 
current growth phase, Indonesia’s national 
government continues to play a guiding role 
in ensuring that economic expansion occurs 
in a sustained and systematic manner.
The Indonesian people also continue  
to embrace democratic principles and 
governance. Presidential elections are 
scheduled for 2014 and this is already 
impacting on national policy and the 
political debate. Moving into 2013, 
Archipelago remains optimistic in respect  
of the country’s prospects and stability as it 
approaches the forthcoming election cycle.
This is of particular relevance to the mining 
sector, which remains a core source of 
economic beneﬁt for Indonesia. In 2012, 
the national government issued a number 
of policy pronouncements for the sector, 
which caused uncertainty for some industry 
participants. One particular issue was a 
pronouncement in early 2012 requiring 
foreign owned IUP holders to divest some of 
their interests in Indonesian mineral projects 
after ﬁve years of commercial production.
It is worth noting that this new divestment 
regime will not apply to Archipelago’s 
mining concessions, which are based  
on two pre-existing Contract of Work 
arrangements, negotiated directly with  
the Indonesian national government. 
Notwithstanding this, Archipelago was 
able to respond in a pro-active way  
to the changing policy landscape by 
working in close dialogue with government 
stakeholders at regional and national 
levels. We will continue to take this 
approach in 2013.
It is important to reﬂect on the broader  
policy rationale underlying the changes  
to Indonesian mining law, which 
emphasises greater transparency and 
improved regulation of mining practices  
to share the beneﬁts of mining with the 
Indonesian community. In this regard, 
Archipelago acknowledges the paradigm 
shift in Indonesian mining policy since  
the adoption of new laws in 2009. In 
conjunction with our core Indonesian 
stakeholders, Archipelago continues  
to work in a co-operative manner with 
government to advance commercial 
outcomes for Toka Tindung, consistent 
with the direction of national policy.
Moving forward, Archipelago will build  
on the achievements of the last year as  
we look to increase our production proﬁle. 
We will pursue our targeted exploration 
programme, enabling us to expand our 
resource and asset base, which provides 
the rationale for further capital expansion. 
Building on our reputation for delivering 
results, we will also continue to assess 
value accretive options for broader 
corporate expansion.
As we continue to implement these 
strategies, Archipelago will remain a  
strong cash generator. In this context,  
it was pleasing to announce a formal 
dividend policy subsequent to year end, 
with the Board committed to paying to 
shareholders at least 10% of operating 
cash ﬂows by way of dividends. Clearly,  
this outcome aligns with our corporate 
vision of delivering signiﬁcant value and 
returns for our shareholders.
On behalf of the Board, I would like  
to thank our shareholders for their  
ongoing support throughout 2012.

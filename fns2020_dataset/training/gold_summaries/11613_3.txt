 2 Osmetech Annual Report 2004  
During the last financial year Osmetech has made significant advances
with its strategy to develop a medical devices and diagnostics business in
the fast growing point of care market.  As a result of the successful
acquisition of the OPTI product line of blood gas analysers from Roche,
the Group’s risk profile improved substantially and the business is now
well funded with over £3m of cash and term deposits at the year end.
Chairman’s statement
The first full year of trading of the OPTI product line has exceeded our expectations at all levels.
Now fully integrated, this business provides a sound and profitable commercial base for the
Group.  There are clear organic growth plans for OPTI which will commence in the second half of
the coming financial year following the launch of three key new products and the start of the
important trading relationship with IDEXX in the veterinary market.
The OPTI business has provided us with an excellent platform from which we can develop other
opportunities within the Group, notably the vaginal infection product scheduled for the next
calendar year.  The experience of the OPTI management team and the proven development and
engineering capabilities will be very valuable in this process of bringing new products through to
market.
I am delighted to welcome Alfred Marek to the Board. Alfred joined Osmetech from Roche at the
time of the OPTI acquisition and is President of Osmetech’s Critical Care Division based in Atlanta.
Previously with AVL he was instrumental in developing their entire blood gas business prior to its
sale to Roche.
This strengthening of the management team comes at an important time for the Group as it seeks
to grow both organically and through continued strategic acquisitions.

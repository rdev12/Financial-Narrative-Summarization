This was our first full year of operating 
without our former largest market, the 
US. We have successfully re-focused  
our operations into other markets with 
fantastic results. Our success is 
manifested by our recent return to the 
FTSE 250 and by industry accolades 
such as Best Betting and Gaming 
C o m p a n y at the Leisure Report Awards 
2007, C a s i n o 	 o f 	 t h e 	 Y e a r and Best Land-
l i n k s 	 P a r t n e r s h i p at the eGaming Awards 
2007 as well as C a s i n o 	 o f 	 t h e 	 Y e a r at the 
Gambling Online Awards 2007. 
Our first ever acquisition was completed 
in May with the purchase of the online 
Bingo business of Globalcom Ltd., and 
has proven to be a great success with 
excellent financial results following its 
integration into 888’s offering umbrella. 
The year was marked as a year of 
innovation and initiatives – we have 
expanded our business model by 
offering our full service on a “white label” 
basis to selected business partners as 
demonstrated by our strategic alliances

I would like to thank all 888 employees, 
our management and our customers for 
making 2007 an outstanding year. 
Financial results
2007 was a phenomenal year for us. 
NGR increased 36% to US$213 million 
(2006: US$157 million) with Total 
Operating Income increase of 38% to 
US$217 million (2006: US$157 million) 
driven by turnover growth from both our 
core Casino and Poker products and 
from the introduction of new products, 
particularly Bingo. Profit Before Tax* 
showed remarkable growth and 
increased 106% to US$46 million (2006: 
US$22 million).
  Annual Report & Accounts 2007  Responsible gaming is a fundamental pillar to our business.  
Our aim is to ensure our services are used responsibly.
Dividend
Given our strong financial results, in 
addition to our interim dividend of 1.8 
cents per share paid in October 2007, 
the Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 5.0 cents per share. 
Our values
During 2007 we outlined and 
implemented our core values that 
represent the philosophy by which we 
operate. We take pride in our ability to 
consistently maintain them. Our values 
were implemented across all parts of the 
organisation, and comprise excellence, 
innovation, caring, customer centricity, 
leading and collaboration. 
Responsible gaming
Responsible gaming is a fundamental 
pillar of our business. Our aim is to 
ensure our services are used 
responsibly, and are fair and transparent. 
We work hard to raise awareness 
through education and to provide our 
staff with first rate tools for ensuring a 
responsible gaming environment. In 
2007, we were awarded for the first time 
“Gamcare” certification, recognising 
888’s dedication to customer protection. 
We also launched our responsible 
gaming website (www.888responsible.
com) where we offer comprehensive and 
easily accessible information about 
responsible gaming practices, dealing 
with problem gambling, preventing 
underage gambling and more. 
Outlook
Building on a great 2007, we have 
introduced our new Bingo brand, 
888ladies, and launched 888sport,  
our Sportsbook offering. Quarter 1 of 
2008 started well across our business, 
particularly in our new Bingo and 
Sportsbook offering. Your Board  
believes we are well positioned to 
develop and grow our business in this 
exciting and expanding space for the 
foreseeable future.

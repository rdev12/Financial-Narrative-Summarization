 ClearDebt Group plc 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

I am delighted to present the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2010. The Group performance, 
particularly from the IVA division, has been especially pleasing and has been marked by a step change in the 
number of new IVAs being passed each month and of course by the acquisition of the back books from Relax Group 
plc (“Relax”) for £2.7m in December 2009. 
 
The Group’s financial performance was very strong. Whilst the Group made a pre-tax profit in the year of £465,709 
(2009: £460,923) this has to be considered in light of the Relax acquisition costs amounting to £527,819 (including 
finance costs of £28,346), amortisation relating to the back books of £944,234 and partially offset by a profit on the 
bargain purchase of the back books of £252,914. The financial and operating performance of the Group can be better 
judged by the massive gains in revenue, gross profit and profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
when compared to the previous year. 
 
I am pleased to say that the Group has successfully rationalised and integrated the Relax acquisition with some 
6,500 new clients being added more than doubling the client base of the Group. These clients are spread across a 
whole spectrum of IVAs, DMPs and for the first time PTDs - giving us the capacity to take in house cases based in 
Scotland for PTDs which were previously outsourced. 
 
The Group’s Statement of Financial Position shows net assets of £5,016,621 (2009: £4,535,318) including cash of 
£541,504 (2009: £584,593) and has been strengthened by the raising of new monies in April 2010 via the issue of 
convertible loan notes raising £2.3m to finance the £2.7m acquisition and associated costs.  
 
The Group finances are on a sound footing and we look to continue to achieve strong growth in the client base 
through the acquisition of further back books as well as through organic growth with cost efficient marketing 
activity and referral relationships. We have made a very good start to the first quarter as regards new IVA business 
and I look forward to another profitable year.

Group performance
These results reflect a good underlying 
trading performance in most of our 
markets. ITE has reported revenues 
of £175 million (2013: £192 million), 
and record headline profits before 
tax of £60 million (2013: £59 million) 
for the 2014 financial year. The 
political upheaval in Ukraine and the 
relative strength of Sterling against 
our principal trading currencies have 
had a significant impact on the year’s 
results and held back what would 
have otherwise been an even stronger 
financial and operating performance. 
Importantly, the Group has continued 
its strategy to diversify its business 
interests into Asia with the acquisition 
of 50% interests in the Chinacoat 
exhibition and the Indonesian 
construction event representing first 
steps in China and Indonesia. The 
acquisition of Beauty Eurasia in Turkey 
and the majority interest in Scoop, the 
Group’s London womenswear fashion 
business, have both helped to build 
on our industry positions in growth 
sectors. In this, the Group’s lesser 
biennial year, headline diluted earnings 
per share was 20.2p (2013: 19.3p). 
Reported pre-tax profit was £41.5 
million (2013: £43.9 million) and fully 
diluted earnings per share was 13.8p 
(2013: 14.0p). The Group finished the 
year with net debt of £15 million (2013: 
cash of £23 million), after investing £50 
million on acquisitions during the year.
Board and management
Mike Hartley stepped down from 
the Board at last year’s AGM, having 
handed over his duties as Audit 
Committee Chairman to Stephen 
Puckett who joined the Board last 
year. Edward Strachan, who has 
been an executive Director since 
2003, stepped down from the Board 
on 1 April 2014, but remains a key 
member of ITE’s management team 
as a Regional Director for certain 
territories in Central Asia which he 
originally established for the Group. 
Sharon Baylay was appointed to the 
Board as a non-executive Director on 
1 April 2014. She brings a wealth of 
international marketing, branding and 
communications expertise together 
with a strong understanding of digital 
marketing from her career at Microsoft 
and the BBC. I would like to express my 
gratitude to both Mike and Edward for 
their contributions to the Board over 
the last decade.
ITE is first and foremost a people 
business and its success is based upon 
the hard work and loyalty of its staff 
worldwide. The Group has over 1,000 
employees conducting its business in 
31 offices in 18 different countries with 
a broad range of cultural backgrounds, 
all co-operating with each other and 
participating in the development of 
ITE. Almost 50% of our staff have been 
employees of ITE for more than five 
years, and 54% are participants in one 
of our equity schemes. As Chairman 
I would, on behalf of the Board, 
like to thank and acknowledge the 
contribution of all of ITE’s employees 
to this year’s result and especially 
those staff in Ukraine who have worked 
under very difficult circumstances. 
ITE’s Board recognises that good 
corporate governance is in the long-
term interests of the Group and we 
are conscious of our responsibilities 
for setting values which underpin 
the Group culture. As Chairman, I am 
mindful of my personal responsibility 
for leading the Board and ensuring it 
operates diligently and effectively. 
Dividend
ITE’s growth has supported a 
consistent increase in annual dividends. 
This year the interim dividend was 
increased from 2.3p to 2.5p and 
the proposed final dividend is 4.9p, 
making a full dividend for the year of 
7.4p (2013: 7.0p). This is an increase in 
dividend of circa 6%, in line with the 
underlying earnings growth in headline 
profits over the biennial cycle. The final 
dividend is proposed for payment on 
10 February 2015.
Outlook
In the year ending 30 September 
2014 the Group enjoyed good trading 
conditions in its major markets for 
most of the first half of the year. 
The political crisis in Ukraine and the 
consequent sanctions imposed on 
Russia have increasingly changed the 
economic and trading environment in 
those countries over the second half 
of the year. Currency movements have 
also had a significant effect on the 
financial result for 2014 with Sterling 
being on average 20% stronger 
against the Ruble and having also 
appreciated against other emerging 
market currencies. Both these issues 
continue to affect the outlook for the 
next financial year. At 27 November 
revenues booked for FY 2015 were 
£81 million representing circa 51% of 
market expectations for the full year. 
Like-for-like revenues are circa 17% 
behind this time last year, and 9% 
behind at constant currency. 
ITE’s results remain sensitive to the 
economic climate in Russia which 
remains its largest market but with 
strong market positions the Group is 
well positioned to respond positively 
to any future improvement in the 
economies of its markets. ITE also 
enjoys increasingly good growth 
prospects in many of its other markets 
and its portfolio of leading events 
continue to perform well. Management 
will continue to review the Group’s 
cost base to ensure that it has the 
most efficient structure to execute 
its strategy of growing its business 
and diversifying its sensitivity to the 
circumstances of any one region. ITE 
is well equipped to achieve these 
objectives through its strong balance 
sheet and good operating cash flow. 
Accordingly the Board has confidence 
in the Group’s future prospects.

Note
In these results, we refer to ‘like-for-like’ 
movements. This is defined as financial 
performance or volumes after adjusting for 
the impact of acquisitions, and timing/biennial 
events. We also refer to ‘constant currency’. 
Constant currency results are calculated on 
the basis of translation of the results at the 
same exchange rates as the prior year.

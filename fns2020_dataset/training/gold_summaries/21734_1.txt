CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Booker Wholesale Customer Satisfaction (% recommend)
Premier retailers are now delivered 
from Makro business centres rather 
than Booker.
Choice Up
• Booker seeks to grow brand and own 
brand sales.
• In 2010 we launched Farm Fresh. 
Sales in the year to 25 March 
2016 were £65m. This is despite 
considerable deflation in the fresh 
markets. The quality and freshness of 
the produce is second to none and 
can be delivered to our customers 
within 48 hours of being harvested.
• We launched CleanPro in 2014. 
This range of professional cleaning 
products has been well received 
by customers. We have 50,000 
customers buying CleanPro each 
week with sales of £42m per annum.
• We continue to improve the ‘good, 
better, best’ of the offer in order to 
satisfy all customers, for example, 
our new frozen bread range meets  
all needs.
Since November 2005 Booker Group 
has been seeking to ‘Focus, Drive 
and Broaden’ the business. 2015 
was a challenging year. In April 2015 
the display of tobacco products was 
banned in small shops in the UK. This 
depressed our retail customer sales. 
Continued price deflation depressed top 
line sales growth and we suffered the 
worst Summer weather in recent years. 
Despite these challenges the Group 
continued to make good progress on 
both the catering and retail sides of 
the business.
FOCUS (commenced  
November 2005)
Booker seeks to become the most 
efficient operator in our sector. We 
continue to improve business efficiency. 
We ‘stop, simplify and standardise’ 
work and invest most of the resulting 
savings in customer service. During 
the year we bedded down the new 
organisation structure. We rolled out 
our new fleet of vehicles, we extended 
the use of ‘self-scan’ and overhauled 
stock management. Our close attention 
to cash has resulted in having £127m of 
net cash, whilst keeping the Group cost 
base in line with last year (pre Budgens 
and Londis).
DRIVE (commenced March 2006)
Thanks to the hard work of Guy Farrant 
and the team, Booker Wholesale/Makro, 
our cash and carry businesses had a 
good year. It served 1,252,000 customers 
this year. We continue to ‘Drive’ choice, 
price and service for our customers. 
Each year we survey 45,000 customers 
to identify where improvements can be 
made. Customer satisfaction is a key 
measure within the business and we have 
made significant progress since 2006. 
Booker and Makro now have a common 
business centre operating structure 
reporting to Andrew Muldoon. This 
enables the Group to move business 
from one location to another to improve 
operational efficiency, health safe 
and legal objectives and customer 
satisfaction. For example, five hundred

“Thanks to the hard work of everybody in  
the Group, our plan to Focus, Drive and 
Broaden the business remains on track.

satisfaction was strong, sales and profits 
were the best we’ve ever achieved.”

Booker’s Pricing vs Cash & Carry Market
Prices Down
• We operate in a very price competitive 
market. Every week we monitor 
prices versus competitors and during 
the year our price index remained 
competitive. We are continuing to 
keep our core line prices at market 
leading levels to provide the best 
possible margin for our customers. 
During the year we saw significant 
price deflation, particularly in 
the catering sector. Booker has 
consistently offered low prices on 
these core products and maintains 
its promise of helping the customer 
during challenging times.
Better Service
• Our people are doing an excellent 
job. Our customers rate Booker 
people highly. Business Centre 
teams across the Group have been 
trained in PRIDE to help improve the 
Parking, Reception, Internal, Delivery 
and Exit experience.
• We have continued to expand and 
improve our delivery service.
• We have more specialist butchers 
and greengrocers within the business 
than last year. We also have skilled 
fishmongers operating in our Makro 
Business Centres.
Business Centre Delivery
• Booker offers a seven days a 
week multi-temperature delivery 
service to both retail and catering 
customers (70% of the fleet has 
multi temperature capacity). All 
of our delivery customers pay the 
same price for goods as our collect 
customers. Our delivery business 
continues to grow (from £600m in 
2008/9 to £1.8bn in 2015/16).
• During the year we completed the roll 
out of our new fleet comprising 550 
vehicles of 3 types. As a result of this, 
as well as through separating our 
Business Centres into small, medium 
and large, Booker and Makro 
has increased Business Centre 
delivery capacity.
Categories
• Our catering, small business and 
retail customers are served by 
our trading teams. These are led 
by; Dominic Morrey, Fresh and 
Ritter, Steve Roper, Drinks and 
Classic, Colm Johnson our Impulse 
categories, Mark Dineen Catering 
and Adrian McKeon for the Budgens 
and Londis businesses. Together 
with their teams, they report into 
Andrew Thompson and Guy Farrant. 
We really value the support from, and 
our relationships with, our suppliers 
and strive to become their preferred 
route to market in the UK.
Caterers/Small Business
• In the past two years we have 
restructured the Group, so that all 
our catering and small business 
customers are coordinated by Stuart 
Hyslop and his team. Consequently, 
Independents, Group Accounts 
and National Chains can draw 
upon the Booker, Makro, Classic 
and Chef Direct infrastructures.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
This has helped strengthen caterer 
satisfaction and grown like-for-like 
catering sales by 0.6% including 
Classic, and by 1.9% excluding 
Classic. This is despite continued 
price deflation in the catering market 
Classic is our on trade wholesale 
business. During the year we made 
the decision to concentrate our 
teams on improving our beer, wine 
and spirits offer in Booker and Makro 
and exited some unprofitable keg 
and on-trade business. 
• We have also made good progress 
with Group Accounts, such as 
Cosmo and Enterprise Inns, where 
we serve these accounts from 
Booker and Makro. 
• Our Chef Direct business, which 
serves national accounts from our 
distribution centre in Didcot has 
also had a good year serving clients 
including Byron Burgers, Ed’s Easy 
Diner and Wagamama.
 
Retailers
• All our retail customers, be they 
Premier, Londis, Budgens, Family 
Shopper, retail club members, 
unaffiliated independents or retail 
national accounts are coordinated by 
Steve Fox and his team.
Premier
• Premier, Booker’s symbol group, 
grew to 3,213 stores (3,082 stores 
last year). Non-tobacco sales to 
these customers grew by 10%. The 
retail development team has put 
a lot of work into both compliance 
and building the sales and profits of 
existing Premier stores.
• Premier still remains unique by 
operating a no cost model for 
members, and has the advantage for 
retailers of providing deliveries and 
also the ability to top-up at their local 
Booker branch. We install the fascia 
and imagery free of charge and also 
provide a market leading promotion 
every four weeks. All goods are 
delivered at cash and carry prices.
Family Shopper
• We continue to develop Family 
Shopper, a local discount format. 
This is doing well. At May 2016, 
we have 42 stores and, although 
still early days, the response to this 
format has been encouraging.
Budgens & Londis
• On 14 September 2015 Budgens and 
Londis joined the Group. Budgens 
serves 150 retailers. The Budgens 
consumer is typically ABC1. 
Londis serves 1,469 retailers with 
approximately 49% of consumers 
being ABC1. Since completion 
of the acquisition, the teams at 
Budgens and Londis have fitted 
into the Group with ease and have 
embraced the Group approach to 
cash, customer satisfaction and 
health and safety. Since joining the 
Group they have generated £13m of 
cash and customer satisfaction has  
been good.
Booker Direct
• Booker Direct serves national retail 
chains from our distribution centres 
with customers including Marks 
& Spencer, most of the cinema 
chains in the UK and the prison 
service in England and Wales. 
Together the Group can now serve 
any independent retailer, Group 
Accounts and National Chains 
throughout the UK.
BROADEN (commenced  
April 2007)
In the UK, Booker seeks to offer the best 
choice, price and service to caterers, 
retailers and small business. We also 
seek to become the suppliers’ preferred 
route to market. In addition, we want 
to sell new products and services and 
reach new customers. In India we seek 
to become the best supplier to Kirana 
stores. To achieve these objectives, 
we are ‘Broadening’ the business. 
‘Broaden’ includes:
Digital 
• Sales at booker.co.uk were £979m, 
up from £874m last year and £15m 
in 2005. All these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. We have 
490,000 customers registered on 
the website compared to 408,000 
last year. Customers can view their 
account details and order products. 
We have also doubled the number 
of stock keeping units available to 
a typical customer on the website 
through our special order system. 
 
Ritter-Courivaud
• Ritter-Courivaud is a speciality 
foods supplier to the UK’s leading 
restaurants. Ritter had a good year 
growing sales via the Makro business 
centres and direct to customers.
Booker India 
• In September 2009 we opened our 
first business centre in Mumbai. We 
now have four branches in Mumbai, 
one in Surat and one joint venture 
branch in Pune. These serve 21,000 
customers, and have also launched 
200 Happy Shopper symbol retailers 
which harness the lessons learned 
from Premier in the UK for the Kirana 
stores of Mumbai. We continue  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

to review growth options in India 
and look forward to developing the 
Booker offer to become the best 
choice, price and service supplier to 
Kirana stores and caterers.
Sustainability
• Booker achieved a fourth consecutive 
Carbon Trust Standard in the 
past year, verifying eight years of 
emissions reductions. In addition we 
have gained a second Carbon Trust 
Waste Standard, covering four years 
of improved waste management.
• Over 25,500 customers are now 
recycling with the Group through 
our packaging and used cooking oil 
recycling services. This helps our 
customers save money, increase 
recycling levels and support more 
sustainable communities throughout 
the UK.
• We are rolling out LED lighting to the 
majority of Business Centres over the 
next 3 years.
• Over 6.7 million litres of used cooking 
oil has been recycled, up 72% on  
last year.
• We donated surplus food equivalent 
to over half a million meals to local 
charities in the last year.
• We supported customers who 
were disrupted by the floods 
through providing stock and 
financial assistance.
• We are committed to helping our 
retail and catering customers 
serve communities throughout the  
United Kingdom.
People 
• Again our team have done a brilliant 
job this year. We are committed to 
continuing to make Booker better 
and safer for colleagues. We are 
also developing talent. For example, 
there is a shortage of butchers in the 
trade, so we have developed a formal 
‘butchery apprenticeship’ with 44 
new butchers graduating in the past 
year. We developed similar schemes 
for greengrocers with 36 colleagues 
graduating and fishmongers with 2 
colleagues graduating. There are 
currently 146 colleagues participating 
in this year’s schemes who are due to 
graduate in September 2016 and we 
intend to run all three schemes again 
in 2017/18. We are also currently 
working with The Institute of Meat 
to raise the skill level of our Butchery 
teams further, and to date three 
butchers have been awarded the 
prestigious Master Butcher title. This 
is part of a longer term plan to up-
skill and develop our future Butchery 
Managers who will go through a 
Craft Butcher training programme  
with accreditation.
• Investment in our delivery teams has 
continued to make progress:
− Our drivers and managers have 
annual refresher courses of Safe, 
Secure and Legal training and 
our vocational drivers complete 
training for the Certificate of 
Professional Competence (CPC), 
which is run by our team of in-
house trainers and delivery 
support managers.
– We also run a driver apprenticeship 
scheme, open to internal and 
external drivers who wish to 
develop their career with Booker 
as well as annual training days 
for managers, to support them 
by improving their day to day 
operation to increase customer 
satisfaction and continue helping 
us to drive cash profit.
• For the eleventh year running, the 
performance of the business means 
our people have shared in our 
success through our bonus system. 
With this great team of people, Booker 
will continue to make progress in the  
year ahead. 
• During the year Bryn Satherley retired 
as Group Operations Director. Bryn 
has served Booker for the past 10 
years and we are very grateful for the 
contribution he has made, he remains 
a good friend of the Group and we 
wish him all the best for the future. 
Thanks to the hard work of everybody 
in the Group, our plan to Focus, Drive 
and Broaden the business remains on 
track. Booker Group had a good year; 
customer satisfaction was strong, sales 
and profits were the best we have ever 
achieved. We made good progress on 
the integration of Budgens and Londis. 
We are very grateful for the support of 
our customers, suppliers and people 
and look forward to making progress in 
the year ahead.

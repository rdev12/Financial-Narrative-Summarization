“ 2008 has started 
positively and the Board 
remains confident in 
its business prospects.”
Chairman’s Statement
Michael Marx
Introduction
I am pleased to report Nationwide’s results 
for the year ended 31 December 2007. It is 
encouraging to have achieved such pleasing 
results while laying strong foundations 
for future growth.
Financial overview 
Revenue for the twelve months ended 
31 December 2007 increased to £151.9m 
(2006: £151.2m), a very creditable performance 
given our decision to let a £20m contract lapse 
due to unattractive commercial terms. Operating 
profit before non‑recurring items rose by 15% to 
£6.6m (2006: £5.8m). Adjusted profit before tax 
excluding non‑recurring items increased by 15% 
to £6.8m (2006: £5.9m) and adjusted earnings 
per share excluding non‑recurring items increased 
by 26% to 11.3p from 9.0p last year. 
The Company adopts IAS 19, the ‘corridor 
approach’, for its pension obligations. However, 
in order to provide shareholders with financial 
results which are comparable with other 
companies, results under IAS 19 (non‑corridor) 
are also shown. Under IAS 19 (non‑corridor), 
operating profit before non‑recurring items 
increased by 14% to £7.6m (2006: £6.7m). 
Profit before tax before non‑recurring items 
increased by 14% to £7.9m (2006: £6.9m) and 
earnings per share before non‑recurring items 
increased by 19% to 12.5p (2006: 10.5p). 
It should be noted that non‑recurring items 
affected last year’s results only.
The Group’s cash position remains very strong, 
with net cash at 31 December 2007 of £5.2m 
(2006: £6.9m), having acquired four new 
bodyshops during the year for a total 
consideration of £2.1m in cash. 
Dividend
The Group has a progressive dividend policy in 
place and the Directors are pleased to recommend 
the payment of a final dividend of 3.0p per share 
for the year, an increase of 15% on last year 
(2006: 2.6p). With the interim dividend of 1.5p, 
this takes the total dividend for the year to 4.5p 
(2006: 2.6p). Subject to approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid 
on 2 June 2008 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 9 May 2008. 
Trading overview
The year started well with a good first quarter. 
However, in the second quarter we took the 
strategic decision to decline the renewal of 
a substantial contract which was offered on 
commercially unattractive terms. Since then, we 
have more than replaced the lost volumes from 
new and existing customers. While work from 
these new agreements has already started to 
flow, we expect to see the full benefits come 
through in the current financial year and beyond. 
As insurers look to consolidate the number 
of vehicle repair suppliers, our market‑leading 
position and high standards of customer service 
should ensure that we will continue to be well 
placed to take advantage of the changes, 
as these new agreements demonstrate. 
We remain focused on driving efficiencies and 
leveraging our scale in order to realise cost savings. 
By working together with customers we are able 
to manage our operations carefully, deploying 
work across the network of bodyshops in a way 
which allows for maximum efficiency and cost 
effectiveness. During the year, we have achieved 
cost savings and we will continue to look at 
further ways in which to enhance operations.

Revenue
During the period, we continued our acquisition 
growth strategy, with the purchase of four new 
bodyshops in order to meet demand from our 
customers in specific regions. We also refined 
our existing network of repair centres, disposing 
of five sites which were no longer suitable for 
our needs. 
Our Network Services division, which offers 
insurers and fleet operators a comprehensive 
‘one stop shop’ option of accident management 
services, continues to perform well. The Aquilo 
business, acquired in December 2006, was 
successfully integrated during the year and has 
contributed to Network Services’ success. 
Outlook
The strategic decisions which we took in 2007 
have established the foundations for future 
growth. We are focused on developing customer 
relationships which will enable us to leverage 
our scale and operational efficiencies to the 
benefit of both Nationwide and our customers. 
The new agreements we secured over the course 
of 2007 will bring further benefits in the current 
financial year and beyond, as the additional 
volumes are generated.
Furthermore we believe that our business is 
well placed to benefit from market consolidation 
by acquiring bodyshops where appropriate and 
by taking advantage of opportunities to win 
additional volumes from insurers consolidating 
their repair base. 2008 has started positively 
and the Board remains confident in its 
business prospects.

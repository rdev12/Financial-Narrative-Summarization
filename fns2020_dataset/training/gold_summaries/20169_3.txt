 “ 2016 has delivered another robust  
result which demonstrates the value  
of our clear, consistent strategy and 
disciplined approach to investment.”
Overview
In my ﬁrst year as Chairman, I am pleased to report that 3i 
delivered another robust result. The Group has a clear, consistent 
strategy and Simon Borrows and the team continue to make 
excellent progress in positioning 3i as a business capable of 
delivering attractive returns throughout the economic cycle. 
Market environment
2015 was marked by considerable turbulence in global markets 
and growth indicators in the US and Europe remained under 
pressure. As a consequence, central bank monetary policy 
continued to be supportive across all the major developed 
economies with interest rates remaining at historic lows. 3i has 
limited direct exposure to companies in the most challenged 
sectors and our portfolio performed well, with our largest and 
strongest investments, including Action, Scandlines and 
3i Infrastructure plc, delivering strong year-on-year 
improvements in performance. 
Performance and dividend 
In FY2016, total return increased by 25% to £824 million 
(2015: £659 million). Net asset value increased to 463 pence 
per share (31 March 2015: 396 pence) and return on opening 
shareholders’ funds was 21.7% (2015: 19.9%). We remained net 
divestors during FY2016 and ended the year with a net cash 
position of £165 million and available liquidity of £1,352 million 
(31 March 2015: net cash of £49 million and liquidity of 
£1,214 million). In light of this strong performance, the Board  
has recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 16 pence per share (2015:  
14 pence per share), resulting in a full year dividend of 22 pence 
per share (2015: 20 pence per share), equivalent to 27% of cash 
realisation proceeds (2015: 23%). This reﬂects the Board’s 
continuing conﬁdence in both the Group’s future prospects and 
its cash generation capability. Subject to shareholder approval, 
we will pay the ﬁnal dividend of 16 pence (2015: 14 pence) in  
July 2016. 
Our current dividend policy, set in May 2012, contemplates 
distributions of between 15–20% of cash realisation proceeds 
(subject to certain criteria on gross debt and gearing described 
below) with a minimum dividend of 8.1 pence per year. As a result 
of the Group’s strong performance and conservative balance 
sheet strategy, actual dividends have exceeded 20% of realised 
proceeds in each of the years the policy has been in operation.
In light of the Group’s continued progress in executing its 
strategy, the quality of its investment portfolio and forecast 
realisation pipeline, the Board has decided that with effect from 
FY2017 , the base dividend will increase to 16 pence per annum, 
with an additional ﬁnal dividend each year taking account of cash 
realisations, the investment pipeline and the balance sheet at  
year end. Consistent with our conservative approach, we will 
maintain our criteria of only paying an additional ﬁnal dividend 
provided gross debt is less than £1 billion and gearing is less than 
20%, but do not expect this to be a practical constraint. Further 
detail on the Group’s approach to capital allocation is provided 
in the Chief Executive’s review.
Outlook
The combination of continuing market volatility and the upcoming 
Brexit referendum is likely to weigh on investor sentiment, with 
reduced M&A volumes and delays in capital investment likely  
to persist while the uncertainty remains. However, I believe that 
3i’s proprietary capital, selective investment approach and 
balance sheet strength positions the Group well to deal with 
these uncertain economic and ﬁnancial conditions. A clear, 
consistent strategy and disciplined approach to investment 
underpin our conﬁdence in the future success of the Group.

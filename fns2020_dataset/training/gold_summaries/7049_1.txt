2006 performance summary 
2006 has been a record year for Hanson,
with operating proﬁt
†#
increasing by 15.1%
to £562.7m, following an increase of
15.4% in 2005. 
We have maintained earnings growth
momentum. Acquisitions made in 2006
added £47 .9m to operating proﬁt
†#
. Property
proﬁts
†
increased by £17 .8m to £32.7m
(£14.9m). Heritage
1
operating proﬁt
†#
from
our six divisions increased by £12.2m.
Strong selling price discipline led the
heritage improvement, recovering signiﬁcant
input cost increases as well as reﬂecting the
underlying economic value of our long-term
mineral reserves. Group operating margin*
†#
increased by 0.7ppts to 12.8% (12.1%).
In 2006, more than half of our operating
proﬁt
†#
was generated in North America. 
Our North American Aggregates division
delivered an excellent result, with operating
proﬁt
†#
30.7% ahead of 2005. This was 
led by strong selling price discipline and a
good performance from acquisitions made
in the year, most notably Material Service
Corporation. We achieved an average
aggregates price increase of 12.1%,
reﬂecting both additional input cost
increases and the increasing scarcity of
mineral reserves in some of the US markets.
2006 was a good year for our North
American Building Products division,
increasing operating proﬁt
†#
by 12.8% over
2005. Acquisition earnings, most notably
from PaverModule in Florida, and operating
proﬁt
†#
increases in Pipe and Precast and
Roof Tile, more than offset a reduction in
operating proﬁt
†#
from our Brick operations
due to weakening of the residential market.
The majority of our products are sold into
the infrastructure, industrial and commercial
construction sectors which remain robust. 
Our businesses in the UK are performing
well in a challenging market. 
In UK Aggregates, the asphalt market was
particularly difﬁcult in 2006. Our asphalt
volumes decreased by nearly 10% and
signiﬁcant cost increases could not be 
fully recovered through selling price rises.
Despite this, the division increased
operating proﬁt
†# 
by 13.2%, beneﬁting 
from the acquisition of Civil and Marine 
in March 2006, and from strong selling
price discipline and cost control. 
Encouragingly, the UK Building Products
division improved its earnings in the second
half of the year compared to the second
half of 2005. Difﬁcult trading conditions
were experienced in 2006, largely due 
to weak brick demand in the repair,
maintenance and improvement (RMI)
sector. Operating proﬁt
†#
increased by
£5.2m, or 13.8%, including additional
property proﬁts of £6.8m.
Another good performance was delivered
by the Australia and Asia Paciﬁc division,
supported by strong selling price increases
and buoyant demand in Western Australia
and Queensland. In addition, results from
Malaysia and Hong Kong improved. 
Good progress was made in Continental
Europe, with a 9.5% increase in operating
proﬁt
†#
in 2006. 
Capital investment
Our plant upgrade programme has
continued this year, driving cash spent on
capital investment up to £288.6m, an
increase of £96.8m compared to last year
and representing 155.8% of depreciation.
Investments include additional mineral
reserves and replacement of plant and
equipment. We have also invested in new
plants and signiﬁcantly upgraded existing
plants, particularly in the USA, to add value
through increased production efﬁciency
and product quality. These improvements
also provide a more comprehensive
product offering and enhanced 
customer service. 
2006 has been 
a record year.
Acquisitions are
performing well 
and our selling 
price discipline has 
been maintained.

Acquisitions 
We paid a total of £558.0m to invest in 
16 acquisitions during 2006. Civil and
Marine, acquired in March for £248.1m,
completes our product integration in the
UK, making us the UK’s leading supplier 
of GGBS (ground granulated blast furnace
slag), a high quality cement substitute with
signiﬁcant environmental beneﬁts. Material
Service Corporation, acquired in June for
£166.3m, is one of the leading aggregates
producers in Illinois. PaverModule, our
Florida-based concrete paver company
acquired in January, forms the basis of a
new product offering for our North America
Building Products division. The other
transactions included operations in North
America, UK, Austria and Spain. 
Customers 
We continue to work with our customers 
to provide high levels of service and product
quality throughout the group. All of our
employees play an important part in this
customer focus. This includes speciﬁcation
advice from our sales teams, product quality
assurance and new solutions from our
operational teams, on-time delivery from 
our distribution teams and administrative
support from our ﬁnance and IT specialists.
Safety 
Safety remains a priority and it should never
be compromised. We are committed to
achieving high standards of health, safety
and welfare for our employees, contractors,
customers and visitors. 
Operating outlook 
Our North America divisions have a broad
geographic spread and end use balance.
This should result in stable overall demand
for our products in 2007, albeit against 
a strong ﬁrst half of 2006. There are some
signs of improvement in brick demand 
in our Building Products UK division.
Elsewhere, demand is expected to 
remain stable.

We aim to continue to maintain our selling
price discipline to recover input cost
increases and to reﬂect the underlying
value of our mineral reserves. 
Our capital investment in new plant and
equipment is expected to increase by
around £100m in 2007 against 2006 to
support ongoing productivity programmes. 
The pipeline of potential acquisitions
appears encouraging, particularly in North
America. Overall, we expect to make further
progress in 2007 .

OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
1 Poised to complete business transition
• Substantially, all Group revenues in the period were derived from 
self-publishing activities, which was up 13% at £21.0 million 
(FY15: £18.6 million). In addition the deferred income balance 
rose by £1.5 million to £2.2 million.
• Good progress was made during the period towards the strategic 
objective of self-publishing multiple revenue generating franchises. 
There was continued investment in the Group’s transition with 
Elite Dangerous revenues used to fund development of both 
Planet Coaster and further Elite Dangerous franchise development.
3 Elite Dangerous audience expanded
• The Group expanded the audience for Elite Dangerous by releasing 
on Microsoft’s Xbox One, and supporting the consumer launch of 
the two major PC Virtual Reality systems.
• New Elite Dangerous products were introduced to cover  
all main price points: Elite Dangerous: Horizons is a paid-for  
seasons pass of expansions to extend the Elite Dangerous game, 
and Elite Dangerous: Arena is a low-priced entry point offering 
instant action player-vs-player combat.
4  Frontier’s player numbers grow
• The total Elite Dangerous franchise unit sales increased by over 
one million during the year, and are currently around 1.8 million.
• Planet Coaster exceeded the Board’s expectations, with around 
25,000 unit sales during the period and 50,000 to date.
2  Second franchise on track 
• Alpha builds of the Group’s second franchise, Planet Coaster, 
were released to early adopter customers and the game 
remains on track for launch on 17 November 2016.

Strategy
Bovis	Homes	has	made	significant	progress	
in	2011,	delivering	a	strong	improvement	in	
profits	and	earnings	against	a	backdrop	of	
challenging,	but	stable,	market	conditions.	
The Group has continued to position itself for significant 
improvement in returns through the continued acquisition 
of high quality consented sites in order to grow active sales 
outlets, leading to higher volumes, increased average sales 
price and higher profit margins.
Additionally, the Group has taken steps to improve the 
efficiency of capital employed, both through the sale of 
consented plots on selected sites and by managing working 
capital tightly.
Bovis Homes aims to be a quality housebuilder delivering  
high returns generated from a strong land bank, much of  
it strategically sourced, and a quality product sold at a 
premium price. In order to deliver improved returns, the 
following clear strategic objectives for 2011 were set out  
and have been delivered:
•  Increase operating profits
•  Build future margin potential in the land bank
•  Improve efficiency of capital employed
Additionally the Group is progressing the following ongoing 
objectives:
•  Deliver strong health, safety and environmental standards
•  Deliver strong customer satisfaction
Increase operating profits
Operating profit increased in the year by 69% to £36.4 million. 
This resulted from the compound positive effect of an 
increased volume of legal completions at a higher average 
sales price with an improved profit margin. 
Volume growth was driven from the increased number of 
active sales outlets in 2011. Having opened 33 sales outlets 
during the year, the average number of active sales outlets 
grew to 73 from 66 in the prior year and the Group finished 
2011 with 80 active sales outlets. 
The increase in active sales outlets contributed to the delivery 
of 2,045 legal completions during 2011, 8% ahead of the 
previous year (2010: 1,901). The Group legally completed 
1,624 private homes (2010: 1,592, including the 215 home 
joint venture deal), with an underlying increase, excluding 
the joint venture deal, of 18%. As a result of the quantity of 
new site openings during the year, legal completions of social 
homes increased by 36% to 421 (2010: 309), 21% of total 
volume, compared to 16% in 2010.
In addition to increased volume, the Group’s average sales 
price also increased. The average sales price of private homes 
was 5% higher at £180,100 in 2011 (2010: £172,300).  
This uplift was almost entirely due to the mix of homes as  
the Group increased the contribution from family homes  
in the south of England. Taking private and social homes 
together, the overall average sales price in 2011 was  
£162,400 (2010: £160,700).
Gross profit margin (excluding land sales) increased to 20.8% 
in 2011 from 17.9% in 2010. This resulted from two factors: 
the full year benefit of construction cost savings in 2011  
and the increased contribution from legal completions on 
stronger profit margin sites acquired post the housing  
market downturn.
As a result of the compound positive effect of volume growth, 
higher average sales price and improved gross profit margin, 
gross profit (excluding land sales) increased by 30% to  
£69.5 million. Combined with land sales profits of £2.7 million 
and with overheads well controlled, the significant growth in 
operating profit to £36.4 million (2010: £21.6m) was achieved 
at an operating margin of 10% (2010: 7.2%). Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		9
Strategy delivery is on track with the Group positioned 
for significant growth in returns
Build future margin potential in the land bank
During 2011, 2,552 plots were added to the consented land bank 
at a cost of £134 million (2010: 3,690 consented plots at a cost 
of £203 million). Approximately 88% of these plots are located 
in the south of England, where the housing market continues 
to show greater robustness. The plots added have an estimated 
future revenue of £542 million and an estimated future gross profit 
potential of £137 million, based on current sales prices and current 
build costs, and are expected to deliver an estimated gross margin 
of over 25%. Of the plots added to the consented land bank, circa 
1,000 plots were delivered through conversion of strategic land.
The Group has agreed terms for the acquisition of more than 
2,000 further plots. Of these, circa 750 consented plots on five 
sites are at an advanced stage in the acquisition process with a 
targeted acquisition date in H1 2012. An additional circa 500 plots 
on five sites are contracted, subject to planning, with planning 
expected in 2012.
The consented land bank amounted to 13,723 plots as at  
31 December 2011, marginally below the 13,766 plots held  
at 31 December 2010. The Group estimated that the gross profit 
potential on the plots within the consented land bank at the 2011 
year end, based on current sales prices and current build costs, was 
£524 million with a gross margin of 21.4% (31 December 2010: 
gross profit potential of £461 million with a gross margin  
of 20.0%). The increase in 2011 of £63 million arose from the  
land additions (£137 million) less utilisation from home sales  
(£69 million) and land sales (£26 million). The balancing positive 
value of £21 million reflects other added value changes delivered 
by the Group in respect of improving gross profit, including cost 
savings and site replans.
Of the 13,723 plots, 72% are located in the south of England 
(2010: 69%). At the year end, the consented land bank included 
5,797 consented plots (42% of total), which have been acquired 
since the housing market downturn (2010: 3,931, 29% of total). 
The average consented land plot cost was £39,800 at the start of 
2011 and increased over the year to £42,100, as a result of  
a lower number of written down plots held in the land bank  
(17% of land plots versus 26% at the start of the year) and the 
addition of new prime southern traditional housing sites where  
the average plot cost is higher.
The Group intends to increase its investment in strategic land 
as visibility over the effects of the changes to the planning 
environment improves. The strategic land bank at 31 December 
2011 stood at 18,749 potential plots as compared to 17,325 
potential plots at 31 December 2010. The Group added circa  
2,400 potential plots to the strategic land bank during the 
year, thus enabling the strategic land bank to grow in size 
notwithstanding the successful conversion of circa 1,000 plots  
into the consented land bank. 
Improve efficiency of capital employed
The Group has controlled the size and value of the consented land 
bank during 2011, with a lower number of plots being acquired 
than in 2010, whilst legal completions have increased and a 
number of land sales have been successfully delivered. At the same 
time the Group is increasing the number of active sales outlets, 
thus employing its capital more effectively.
In order to improve the spread of the Group’s land bank to 
enhance capital turn, the Group has achieved its five targeted 
consented land sales on selected sites in 2011, particularly on those 
sites which have a longer trade out period by virtue of their size.  
Of these, four land sales completed in 2011 and the fifth 
completed in early January 2012. As a result of the four completed 
sales, the land bank reduced in size by 532 consented plots.
The Group has tightly controlled work in progress, with the 
number of units of production held at the end of 2011 reduced  
to 949 units (2010: 1,093). Additionally, work in progress 
associated with infrastructure, roads and sewers has been reduced.
Improve returns 
Strong growth in profits during 2011 combined with improved 
efficiency of capital employed has resulted in a significant increase 
in return on capital employed to 5% in 2011 from 3% in 2010. 
The Group is firmly of the view that, based on current market 
conditions continuing, return on capital employed will further 
improve in 2012, fuelled by the aforementioned compound 
positive effect on profit of volume improvement, growth in average 
sales price and increase in profit margin. Whilst future output 
capacity will grow, the capital base will remain tightly controlled in 
respect of land and work in progress. Therefore, assuming current 
market conditions continue, the Group anticipates achieving a 
return on capital employed of at least 7% in 2012. 10		 |		Annual	report	and	accounts		 |		Strategy
Chief Executive’s report 
Deliver strong health, safety and 
environmental standards
The Group is committed to delivering strong health and  
safety standards for its employees, subcontractors and other 
site visitors. It maintains a high level of organisational focus 
on its health and safety regime through comprehensive staff 
training, clear and accountable management processes and 
through regular and transparent reporting of performance. 
This is overseen, firstly, through the operational line, which 
takes day to day accountability for this area and, secondly, via 
a Group-wide oversight committee with nominated regional 
directors responsible for safety, run by the Group Director of 
Health and Safety and chaired by a senior Group manager. 
The Group also seeks to ensure that all of its employees and 
subcontractors who operate at or visit sites carry a CSCS card, 
indicating its commitment to a fully trained workforce. 
Notwithstanding the increase in the Group’s build activity 
during 2011, the Group’s NHBC risk score for the year was 
0.44, which compares favourably to the industry peer  
group average. Additionally, the risk incident rate decreased  
to 21, a 33% improvement over 2010.
During the last 12 months the Group has continued to focus 
efforts on the key areas of significant risk, being working  
at heights, PPE and slips, trips and falls in order to raise 
awareness in these areas. Whilst the Group’s health and  
safety performance is relatively strong versus external 
benchmarks, the Group cannot be complacent. Health and 
Safety will remain a key area of focus for regional and  
Group management.
The Group continues to regard sustainable development as 
critical to the long term creation of value for its shareholders. 
The housebuilding industry has an important role to play both 
in mitigating the impact of its building activities on the local 
environment and in the evolution of building techniques  
and advances, which reduce the carbon usage from new  
build developments.
The Group works with a range of external stakeholders to 
agree and carry out development in a mutually acceptable 
manner, thereby ensuring that its developments take place in 
a way which mitigates the impact on the local environment, 
thereby balancing the needs of local communities for new 
housing with the requirement to avoid environmental damage.
Looking forward, the Group is focusing on ways to ensure 
that its products conform to good environmental standards, 
including both to EcoHomes standards and to emerging 
standards under the Code for Sustainable Homes. Reflecting 
the existing contribution that the Group makes to the 
communities and environments in which it operates, the Group 
is proud to say that it is a member of the FTSE4Good index.
Further details of the Group’s efforts and achievements during 
2011 in regards to Corporate Social Responsibility will be 
published in a separate report, available from the Company’s 
website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk).
Deliver a strong customer service experience 
for Bovis Homes customers
The Group continues to invest in delivering its customer 
charter, which sets the expectations in relation to the quality 
of the product it delivers and the manner in which the sales 
transaction is serviced. The Group has been recognised 
independently by the achievement of a four star builder rating 
by the Home Builder Federation. Additionally, the Group is 
pleased to see the key internal scoring metrics of ‘recommend 
a friend’, ‘purchase another Bovis home’ and ‘overall quality 
of the new home’ continuing to generate strong satisfaction 
scores during 2011, at 95%, 94% and 94% respectively.
The focus of the Group’s customer communication has 
remained web based during 2011, with the Group using 
the power of the internet to directly market its products to 
consumers, utilising internally generated mailing lists as well as 
via intermediaries such as ‘Smart New Homes’ or ‘Right Move’. 
Over 70% of customer enquires originate via the web.
The sales hub structure remains successful. Given the 
prevalence of the web as the primary enquiry origination 
point for our customers, the Group has been able to provide 
its customers with the convenience of appointments to view 
homes at their preferred site. Whilst providing customers 
with improved convenience, the Group has reduced its cost 
of sales per transaction and increased its rate of successful 
sales conversion. Additionally, sales hubs are capable of being 
manned more efficiently on a seven day opening basis and 
also into the evening cost effectively. This selling process is 
supported by the Group’s bespoke prospect management 
system, which delivers on-site technology whilst integrating the 
Group’s prospects database with brochure fulfilment.

Strategy delivery is on track with the Group positioned 
for significant growth in returns 
Market conditions
A lack of availability in 2011 of high loan to value mortgage 
products continued to constrain market demand for new build 
homes. This was particularly an issue for first time buyers, who, 
since the financial crisis, have had to provide a higher level of 
deposit for their home purchase than had historically been the 
case. Monthly mortgage approval levels have been stable 
throughout 2011, but at significantly lower levels than the  
position historically.
With a backdrop of continuing economic and employment 
uncertainty, trading conditions are expected to remain challenging 
during 2012. However, the Group regards positively the anticipated 
launch of the Government backed mortgage indemnity scheme 
and welcomes the stimulus that this scheme can provide to activity 
in the new build homes market through the availability of 95% 
loan to value mortgages. The mortgage indemnity scheme is 
expected to work in a similar way to the Group’s existing Perfect 
10 product and the Group will work with the industry, lenders and 
the Government with the aim of launching the new scheme in 
good time for the spring market this year. As well as working with 
the industry, the Group will continue to seek innovative ways to 
enable its customers to access appropriate mortgage finance.
During 2011, sales prices have been stable with some regional 
variations. Although the market remains challenging and customer 
confidence and commitment levels remain subdued, the Group 
currently believes that the pricing environment will be broadly 
stable for 2012 as a whole, on the expectation that a limited 
supply of homes for sale will not satisfy demand from purchasers. 
At the same time, buyers are likely to remain constrained by 
mortgage availability. It is anticipated that sales prices will continue 
to be more robust in the south of England than in the north, which 
will assist the Group given the southern bias of its sites.
Current trading
The Group entered 2012 with a forward sales order position of 
568 homes, a 35% improvement on the 420 homes brought 
forward at the start of 2011. This improvement was contributed to 
by the increase in average active sales outlets to 73 in 2011 from 
66 during 2010.
Active sales outlets were 83 in the eight weeks to 24 February 
2012, up by 28% from 65 in the same period in 2011.  
This increase has been instrumental in delivering the robust  
trading achieved in the period to 24 February 2012, with sales 
enquiries and site visitors higher by 26% and 32% respectively. 
From these enhanced visitor levels, the Group has achieved 320 net 
private reservations in the first eight weeks of 2012 against 227 in 
the comparative period in 2011, an increase of 41%.
During this eight week period, the average private sales rate was 
0.48 net reservations per site per week, an improvement of 10% 
on the sales rate of 0.44 in the same period in 2011. Sales prices 
achieved to date have been modestly ahead of Group expectations.
As at 24 February 2012, the Group held 926 net sales for legal 
completion in 2012, as compared to 647 net sales at the same 
point in 2011, an increase of 37%. Of these, private sales 
amounted to 550 units (2011: 428 units) and social housing sales 
amounted to 376 units (2011: 219 units).
Outlook
As a result of the robust investment in land in 2010 and 2011,  
the Group expects to trade from an average of 85 sales outlets in 
2012 versus 73 in 2011, an increase of 16%. With 83 active sales 
outlets currently open, the Group is confident that the 85 target 
can be achieved.
Given the focus on acquiring land in the south of England, it is 
anticipated that 75% of the active sales outlets at the end of the 
2012 will be southern located versus 60% at the start of 2012. 
As new sales outlets are opened by the Group, absolute weekly 
reservation levels are anticipated to increase.
The continued growth in active sales outlets should, based on 
stable market conditions, enable the Group to deliver increased 
volumes, at a higher average sales price with improved profit 
margins. With a clear focus on controlling the capital employed 
of the Group through rigorous management of the landbank and 
tight control of work in progress, the Group expects to deliver a 
strong improvement in returns in 2012 and beyond.
The Board is confident in the Group’s prospects for 2012, 
assuming a continuation of current market conditions. The Board 
continues to believe that the Group’s growth strategy will increase 
profits, which, combined with improving capital efficiency, will 
materially improve shareholder returns.

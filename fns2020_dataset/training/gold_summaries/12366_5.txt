Exploration
The substantial increase in the  
gold resource base at Albazino  
and successful exploration results  
at Kutyn and Svetloye put us in a 
strong position to make decisions on 
signiﬁcant new asset developments  
in the second half of 2013-early 2014. 
These assets will most likely form the 
core of the third generation of growth 
assets after reaching our 2014 target 
of 1.4 Moz of gold equivalent.
Resource increase in 2012
+4.9 Moz 
of gold equivalent (+35%)
Dividends
Our dividend policy in 2012 evolved  
in response to increased demand  
for dividend ﬂow from institutional 
investors across the world. It also 
highlighted our ability to generate 
meaningful free cash ﬂow at the 
current stage of our development.
Strong results from  
our exploration activities
Committed to capital  
discipline and a progressive 
dividend policy
What we said
At the time of our listing, we adopted a new dividend policy  
to reﬂect our commitment to meet shareholder expectations  
in an environment characterised on the one hand by high 
commodity prices, and tight ﬁnancial markets on the other.  
A dividend of US$0.20 per share was proposed, along with  
the intention to pay annual dividends of 20% of net income, 
provided that net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio is less  
than 1.75.
Greenﬁeld exploration
Investment in greenﬁeld exploration remains a key objective  
for us. Our target standalone mines need to meet the stringent 
criteria that drive the cost efﬁciencies and a strong return on 
capital invested. These criteria include high grade, preference 
for open-pit mining, potential operational synergies with 
existing assets and, most importantly, new projects will need  
to exceed our minimum hurdle rates in terms of internal rate  
of return, which are set based on the complexity and risk level 
of a particular project.
Greenﬁeld exploration efforts for new precious metals  
deposits are set to form the next generation of our growth 
assets and contribute to our longer-term growth prospects. 
The exploration expertise is therefore crucial for the  
long-term strategic development of the Company.
Key exploration results in 2012:
Albazino
The exploration results at Albazino highlight the tremendous 
potential of this asset, and are an excellent example of
Polymetal’s ability to create value by discovering high-grade 
resources close to existing processing facilities.
Khakanja, Dukat, Omolon, Varvara and Voro
Ongoing brownﬁeld exploration activities aimed at extension  
of life-of-mine of our existing operations. At Varvara, signiﬁcant 
resource and reserve additions were achieved as a result  
of in-ﬁll and step-out drilling. 
Svetloye 
Metallurgical test work to determine viability of heap leaching  
is continuing, with a reserve estimate for the bulk heap leach 
processing option targeted for the fourth quarter of 2013.
Kutyn
Increased mineralised potential by 0.6 Moz of gold contained. 
Tamunier
An initial JORC resource estimate prepared for the deposit  
of 50 Mt at 1.2 g/t gold.
Elmus
Additional ore zone discoveries.
What we did – Key achievements
Raised payout ratio to 30% compared to the initial 
target of 20% and introduced interim dividends
Introduced annual Board consideration of a special 
dividend and paid US$0.50 per share in special 
dividends in January 2013
Demonstrated the importance we place on delivering 
meaningful cash returns to our shareholders and  
sustainable value creation

Analysis of production results 
Mining 
Stripping volumes in 2012 grew by 6%, while underground 
development increased by 33% to 46.7 thousand metres, 
mainly due to our Dukat hub where ore is increasingly sourced 
from underground. Ore mined was 12,591 Kt, a 14% increase 
over 2011 level. The bulk of ore mined (87%), is sourced from 
open-pit. The key contributors of growth in ore mined were 
Khakanja (due to intensiﬁed mining at pit 3 and completion of 
underground mining at Yurievskoye) and Omolon (full capacity 
achieved at Sopka and commencement of mining at Tsokol), 
further complemented by a 45% increase in ore mined at 
Albazino as the mine achieved full capacity.
The average gold equivalent grade in ore mined was 4.1 g/t, 
increasing by 10% over the 2011 level of 3.8 g/t. The solid 
increase in grade proﬁle was driven mainly by increased share 
2012 became a year of solid operating 
results, with reliable delivery on 
increased production guidance revised 
upwards by 5% during the year, and 
successful ramp-up of new mines. 
This robust operating performance 
was further supported by a substantial 
increase in resource base, paving the 
way for development decisions on the 
third generation of growth assets.
Total gold equivalent production of 1,063 Koz was up 31% 
compared to 2011 and exceeded the original guidance  
of 1 Moz by 6%. These excellent results were driven by  
stable performance at all our mature mines, with a notable 
improvement achieved at Dukat, and successful ramp-up  
at Omolon and Albazino.
The strong operating results were combined with considerable 
exploration success, a dramatic increase of resource base at 
Albazino to nearly 6 Moz of gold and successful exploration 
results at Kutyn and Svetloye. As a result, the Company is 
steadily approaching development decisions on new asset 
development in the second half of 2013 – beginning of 2014. 
These are set to build up the ‘third generation’ of growth 
assets, ensuring growth beyond 2014.
Delivering on production and sales targets
Annual gold production was 589 Koz, up 33% year-on-year, 
driven mainly by successful ramp-up at Omolon and Albazino. 
Annual silver production was 26.5 Moz, up 33% year-on-year, 
as a result of higher grades and recoveries at Dukat, 
successful processing of high-grade Sopka ore at Omolon, 
and increased silver grades at Khakanja.
Importantly, metal sales for the full year exceeded production 
both for gold and silver. This was achieved by expected 
de-stockpiling of concentrate and reﬁned metals inventories 
– most importantly at Dukat and Omolon – accumulated  
in the ﬁrst six months of the year, and contributed to stronger 
operating cash ﬂows.
Delivering on key capital projects
We have made solid progress across our key construction 
projects, although some of them did not progress fully  
in line with our expectations, with a three-month delay in 
commissioning at Mayskoye and issues arising during the 
ramp-up of the Amursk POX plant. However, these issues  
did not have a material effect on our 2012 results and 2013 
production targets. Both Amursk and Mayskoye are now the 
key focus of 2013 for our management team, with deﬁned 
action plans in place.
In 2012, the key achievements across our growth projects 
included:
 The Albazino mine and concentrator reached design 
throughput and recovery from the second quarter  
of the year.
 The refurbished processing plant at Omolon with  
Merrill-Crowe section performed fully in line with 
expectations, processing more than 300 Kt of high gold  
and silver grade ore from satellite Sopka deposit.
 The majority of construction works were completed at the 
Mayskoye concentrator. Currently construction is on track  
for the revised start-up deadline in April 2013, with the  
only remaining works including installation of electrical, 
controlling, and auxiliary equipment.
of ore mined at Omolon and Albazino, our new higher grade 
mines, combined with increased average grades at these 
operations by 13% and 27% respectively. Importantly,  
average grades were also supported by a stable grade  
proﬁle at Dukat while ore mined grew 8% year-on-year.
Processing 
Ore processed was up 13% in 2012 and reached 9,925 Kt. 
This solid increase was mainly driven by full ramp-up of 
processing facilities at Albazino (reaching design throughput 
and recovery in the ﬁrst half of the year, resulting in a twofold 
increase) and commencement of processing of ore from 
Sopka at the newly commissioned Merrill-Crowe section  
of Kubaka plant (Omolon hub). Our mature mines 
demonstrated stable performance at their nameplate  
capacity or slightly above. 
As expected, average gold equivalent grade in ore processed 
grew by 15% to 4.4 g/t (slightly above our average reserve 
grade of 3.9 g/t) as the growth in processing volumes came 
mainly from our new high-grade mines – Omolon (with 
processing high-grade ore from Sopka, average grade 
processed grew almost threefold year-on-year) and Albazino 
(contributing 12% of total ore processed by the Group in 2012, 
up from 7% in 2011). At Khakanja, there was an increase in 
average silver grade due to processing of higher-grade ores 
from Khakanja’s pit 3 and Avlayakan.
Production 
Our original annual gold equivalent production guidance  
of 1 Moz for 2012 was subsequently increased to 1.05 Moz  
by the end of the third quarter, on the back of the strong 
operating results achieved. Actual gold equivalent production 
for the year was 1,063 Moz, a 31% increase compared  
to 2011, and exceeded the elevated guidance.
Major contributions to production growth were attributable  
to four operations: 
 Dukat – with the increased grade proﬁle due to 
implementation of new underground mining methods, 
expansion of mining at Goltsovoye, and sustainably 
improved recovery levels at the main Omsukchan 
concentrator.
 Albazino/Amursk hub – as a result of the Albazino mine 
and concentrator reaching design throughput and recoveries 
by the second quarter of the year and commencement  
of commercial production at the Amursk POX, combined 
with continued concentrate sales to third-party offtakers.

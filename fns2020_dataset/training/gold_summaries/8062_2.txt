HIGHLIGHTS
SGL Field Development
 Consistent gas production during the year with production from the block totalling 
2223 mmscf during the year.
 Successful drilling of new development wells with good gas shows. Sufficient number 
of development wells has been drilled & completed to meet gas supply requirement 
of 33.5 mmcf/d (net of Co
2
) under Phase II of the sale agreement signed with GAIL. 
 Successful completion of the new ‘Gas Gathering Station (GGS)’ with CO² removal 
facility with daily production capacity of approximately 65 mmcf/d gas. 
 GAIL has been notified of its “take or pay” obligation in respect of Phase II gas supplies 
under the GSPA. With the commencement of this Phase II, the price of the gas also will 
increase from US$ 4.11 per mmbtu to US$ 5 per mmbtu.
 On-going negotiation for supply of additional 28 mmscfd (net of CO²) to state owned 
power company (RRVUNL) through GAIL in advanced stages. RRVUNL has already 
ordered the turbine for additional 160 MW capacity following requisite approvals for 
this expansion.

Financial 
 Consolidated revenues, operating profits & profit before tax of respectively 
US$ 6.76 mn, US$ 3.98 mn & US$ 3.13 mn for the year. Provision of notional deferred 
tax liability of US$ 1.78 mn as per IFRS requirements. Given the Company’s carried

development of the Block. Partly financed from drawdowns of US$ 52.39mn from 
US$ 110mn debt facility and renewed existing related party loan of US$ 25.27mn 
during the year.

sanctioned earlier - total repayment of US$ 11.79mn of principle and payment of 
interest of US$ 4.77mn during the year.

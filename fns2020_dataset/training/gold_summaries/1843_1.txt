 04 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Group overview
Overall performance of the business during the 
financial year was dominated by the significant decline 
in customer demand for new housing. In response,  
the Group reduced the scale of its business, cut costs, 
sold at acceptable rates and reduced debt.
Group Chief Executive’s statement
“In addition... the Group 
is continuing to focus  
on the action needed to 
drive the longer-term 
performance of the 
business which will enable 
it to recover more quickly 
from the downturn when 
the market begins to 
improve – land and 
planning; sales and 
marketing; people and 
efficient production.”
of social housing fell to 15.7% (2008: 20.4%)  
as the Group reduced the number of new sites. 
During the year houses represented 50.5% 
(2008: 54.9%) of the Group’s completions, 
excluding central London, and the Group 
expects site replans to increase the proportion 
of houses available on its sites in future. 
Properties sold to investors rose to 20.9%  
of total completions compared with 14.1%  
in 2008. 
Net private reservations per site per week were 
up 10.5% compared with the 2008 financial 
year, 6.0% down for the first half and 28.6%  
up in the second half. A return to more normal 
seasonal selling patterns emerged, with 
second half net private reservations 15.4% 
above the first half levels on a per site per 
week basis. 
A lack of customer confidence, in particular  
the perception of falling house prices, led to  
a sharp decline in sales. This contributed to a 
lower forward order book of £464.3m (2008: 
£697 .6m) at the year end, of which £286.4m 
(2008: £538.7m) was contracted. 
The first half of the year was particularly 
challenging for the Group. Conditions became 
immensely difficult as a result of the 
deteriorating economic outlook and the 
resulting contraction in the availability of 
mortgage finance, and decline in customer 
confidence levels. Sales were only achievable 
at substantially reduced prices. In the second 
half of the year, the Group started to achieve 
some pricing stability, albeit at reduced levels. 
This combined with acceptable sales rates at 
planned selling prices allowed the Group to 
achieve its cash targets.
Declining volumes and prices have had a 
significant impact on the profitability of the 
Group. Group profit from operations before 
exceptional items fell from £550.2m to £34.2m. 
Operating margins before exceptional items 
were 1.5% (2008: 15.5%). As a result of 
inventory write-downs and other operating 
exceptional items of £519.5m (2008: £255.0m), 
the Group’s loss from operations was £485.3m 
(2008: £295.2m profit).
Tight control of land spend and work in 
progress and disposal of commercial 
development assets helped to reduce  
net debt to £1,276.9m at 30 June 2009  
(2008: £1,650.6m). 
Total completions for the year decreased  
to 13,202 (2008: 18,588). The overall mix  
of completions also changed. The proportion  Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009 05

The average selling price measured over all 
completions reduced by 14.1% to £157,200 
(2008: £183,100). The underlying reduction, 
excluding the impact of mix changes, was 
approximately 22%. During the second half  
of the year, the Group experienced improved 
price stabilisation across the housebuilding 
business. Prices are now approximately 27% 
lower than at their peak in the summer of 
2007. Following the resetting of prices from 
January 2009 and as a result of increased 
visitor numbers in the second half and reduced 
stock levels, the Group was able to reduce the 
level of sales incentives being offered. 
Driving business performance
During the year the Group has focused on 
improving its operating efficiency. It has 
continued to prioritise driving sales, reducing 
costs and generating cash to reduce debt. 
These objectives were pursued whilst seeking 
to preserve the capability of the organisation  
to respond to any market recovery.
Maximising sales
The effectiveness of the Group’s sales 
channels has continued to improve. The 
Group has moved increasingly towards online 
and new technology to support sales. 
A range of products has been used effectively 
to address different market sectors and the 
barriers to house purchasers in the current 
market. Shared equity has been important in 
addressing the first time buyer market where 
the lack of higher loan to value mortgage 
finance has become a particularly difficult 
issue. 11.4% of the Group’s completions 
during the year depended on shared equity. 
HomeBuy Direct, the Government scheme,  
is now in operation and the Group reserved 
around 24 homes per week during the fourth 
quarter of the financial year using this scheme.
Part-exchange has been used to address the 
customer sector that has had difficulty finding 
purchasers for its existing homes. During the 
year 11.8% of completions (2008: 12.3%) were 
supported by part-exchange incentives. The 
Group’s ability to sell second hand properties, 
and thus manage its working capital, has 
enabled it to continue to use this mechanism 
as an effective sales support tool throughout 
the year.
Part-exchange stock levels have also 
continued to fall. At 30 June 2009, we had 
150 unreserved part-exchange units, down 
78% over the last twelve months (2008: 677).
Stock of completed units continues to reduce. 
We had 822 unreserved stock units at                
30 June 2009, 3.9 weeks’ supply at current 
sales rates, down 55% from the holding of 
1,821 units at 30 June 2008.
Cost reductions
Cost reduction programmes are well 
established and embedded in the Group’s 
operations. During the year the number of 
divisional offices was reduced from 32 to 25, 
whilst seeking to ensure that the core 
infrastructure of the Group and its brands 
have been preserved. 
The programme to reduce supply and build 
costs has continued to deliver substantial 
benefits for the Group. For example, since 
June 2007, the Group has reduced the basic 
housebuild costs of a standard house type  
by approximately 15%. Material prices and 
subcontractor rates have been reduced 
significantly to reflect the current conditions  
in the market. Whilst it is unlikely that these 
reductions will be permanent, other cost 
reduction programmes including technical 
design changes and replans from apartments 
to houses are expected to yield longer-term 
efficiency improvements.  Visitors per site

Group overview | Group Chief Executive’s statement
Managing cash
During the year the Group has continued to 
focus on generating cash. Having reduced 
excess stock in the first half, it carefully 
controlled work in progress, closely matching 
new build starts to sales. Site openings have 
been tightly managed, in particular by 
deferring investment on sites with significant 
upfront infrastructure requirements. The 
average number of sites during the 2009 
financial year was 503 (2008: 594). In addition, 
the progress made in disposing of certain 
commercial development assets from the 
Wilson Bowden Developments portfolio 
generated cash for the Group. 
Land spend during the year was largely 
restricted to fulfilment of pre-existing 
contractual commitments which could not  
be cancelled or deferred, although there was 
limited expenditure where the Group could 
source attractively priced opportunities on 
deferred terms. Land spend totalled £263.7m, 
a significant reduction on the spend of 
approximately £1.0 billion in 2008. 
Although the Group’s net debt has been 
reduced significantly during the year, future 
cash flows remain vulnerable given continued 
market uncertainty. Nevertheless, the Group 
has operated within its financial covenants 
throughout the last twelve months and, as 
explained in the basis of preparation on  
page 58, expects to continue to do so in  
the absence of a further downturn.
Driving up quality
The Group has continued to focus on the 
quality of the products it builds and on 
customer support during and after the sales 
process. The Group recently became, for  
the first time in its history, a Four Star builder 
in the Home Builders Federation 4th annual 
customer satisfaction survey. In addition, the 
Group has achieved 76 (2008: 73) National 
House-Building Council ‘Pride in the Job’ 
quality awards. 
The Group continues to make progress to 
improve the design of its products, internally, 
externally and for the development as a 
whole. The Group has been awarded its  
first ever Building for Life award for the 
development at City Point in Brighton and 
Building for Life standard for the development 
at Tachbrook Triangle in Pimlico, London,  
by The Commission for Architecture and the 
Built Environment (‘CABE’). The Building for 
Life awards are the National Standard for 
well-designed homes and neighbourhoods. 
The Group is continuing to improve the quality 
of design in its developments and has 
produced new internal design guidelines 
which seek to promote examples of good 
practice across the business. 
Product innovation
Customer demand, economics and regulation 
continue to influence the nature of the Group’s 
products. Houses made up 50.5% of Group 
completions, excluding central London  
(2008: 54.9%). As the Group replans sites,  
this proportion will rise further as apartments 
are replaced by new house types. 
Design innovation will be particularly important 
in meeting environmental challenges of the 
future at the most economical cost. The 
Group’s zero carbon house at the Building 
Research Establishment (‘BRE’) continues to 
be tested and management are pleased with 
its performance to date. Planning permission  
has been granted for the flagship zero  
carbon development at Hanham Hall and  
it is expected that work will start on site later  
this year.
Building on experience, the Group is currently 
developing a range of houses designed to 
meet the requirements of various aspects of 
the Code for Sustainable Homes. The Group 
believes that this work will provide both cost 
and reputational advantages for its products.
Commercial developments
Good progress has been made in the disposal 
of commercial developments assets from the 
Wilson Bowden Developments portfolio, with 
total cash proceeds of £181.1m received in  
the financial year ended 30 June 2009. 
Investments and development opportunities, 
with a net asset value of £55.9m as at 30 June 
2009, have been retained and are being 
managed by a dedicated team with a view  
to realising value when the market improves. 
This team will also seek opportunities to create 
value from the wider Group portfolio including 
where there are mixed-use sites.
Government initiatives
The Government has put in place a number  
of measures during the year to support the 
housebuilding industry. On the demand side, 
HomeBuy Direct, after a slow start, is now 
making a significant difference to the Group’s 
sales of shared equity products. Whilst 
Government support to the banking sector 
has been welcome, the Group has yet to see 
a material improvement in the availability of 
mortgage finance, in particular for the higher 
loan to value sector. Addressing this issue 
remains a priority to drive recovery.
On the supply side, the Government’s 
commitment of £400m of funding, announced 
in the 2009 Budget, and the additional 
resources that have since been made 
available to the Kickstart programme  
were a welcome development for the  
industry and the Group. Final funding  
for the Group under the scheme will be 
determined later in the year.
Health and Safety
The Group considers health and safety to  
be of paramount importance. A Health and 
Safety Committee, including members of the 
Board, has been formed in order to provide 
further focus to the Group’s strategy for 
improvement and to review overall Group 
performance. During the financial year the 
Group’s commitment to health and safety 
resulted in an improvement to its reportable 
Injury Incidence Rate to 522 per 100,000 
persons employed, a 20.4% decrease on  
the prior financial year. The Group is pleased 
to have achieved its objective to reduce the 
Injury Incidence Rate below 560 per 100,000 
by 2010 one year ahead of target.
Planning for recovery
In addition to the measures to improve the 
short-term performance of the organisation,  
the Group is continuing to focus on the action 
needed to drive the longer-term performance of 
the business which will enable it to recover more 
quickly from the downturn when the market 
begins to improve – land and planning; sales 
and marketing; people; and efficient production. 08 Barratt Developments PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Group overview | Group Chief Executive’s statement
Land and planning
If build activity scales back up in order to 
satisfy increased demand, it will be necessary 
to identify and secure investment opportunities 
in the land market, including strategic land, on 
appropriate terms to replenish the land bank to 
meet more normalised build levels. The Group 
intends to exploit fully its planning capabilities 
in order to extract maximum value from both 
existing and newly acquired sites.
Sales and marketing
The sales function is expected to benefit  
in an improving market from the efficiencies 
achieved during the downturn. A combination 
of a step up in training support and deployment 
of new technology on site will enable the 
Group to improve conversion rates. In addition, 
a shift in marketing focus away from deal-led 
advertising should support an improvement  
in sales performance.
People
The Group has continued to develop and 
invest in its people and their expertise, despite 
the downturn, in order to ensure appropriate 
and adequate resources are available to meet 
future demand. Increased professional and 
skilled resources, including in areas such as 
land buying, will be required and the Group’s 
successful graduate and apprenticeship 
programmes will need to be relaunched.
Efficient production
The competition for suppliers and contractors 
is expected to intensify when activity levels 
increase and shortages of labour, appropriate 
skills and materials, as well as cost pressures, 
may result. Whilst the Group’s strong 
procurement function and existing national 
procurement agreements with major suppliers 
will provide a firm base, it is committed to 
strengthening these relationships to ensure 
the support it needs as the market recovers.
Current outlook
The second half of the 2009 financial year has 
seen a degree of stability return to the UK 
housing market. The Company was able to 
maintain price levels after significant falls in 
the first half year, whilst achieving improved 
reservation rates per outlet. 
 
This trend has continued since the start of the 
new financial year with reservation rates in the 
first eleven weeks both above budget and 
those in the same period of the previous year. 
Overall reservation prices are running ahead 
of internal expectations.
Forward sales at 30 June 2009 were £464.3m 
(2008: £697.6m) representing 3,328 plots 
(2008: 4,586 plots). As at 13 September 2009 
forward sales had increased to £733.4m.
Total completions for the 2010 financial year 
are currently expected to be approximately 
12,000, with a similar mix between social and 
private completions, but consistent with the 
replanning and build programme undertaken 
since the second half of the 2009 financial 
year, a shift in product mix towards a higher 
proportion of houses. The Group anticipates 
this shift will slightly improve average selling 
prices for the period.
Nevertheless, the encouraging signs being 
experienced are subject to continued 
uncertainty in the wider economic climate. 
There is unlikely to be a sustained recovery in 
the UK housing market until mortgage finance 
is more readily available particularly in the 
higher loan to value segment and consumer 
confidence is more fully restored. 
Proposed Placing and Rights Issue
The Board is today announcing a fully 
underwritten Placing and Rights Issue to raise 
gross proceeds of approximately £720m, 
together with amended financing arrangements 
which will come into effect upon successful 
completion of the Placing and Rights Issue. 
The Firm Placing and Rights Issue will:
•  substantially strengthen the Group’s balance 
sheet and reduce its financial indebtedness;
•  allow the Group to develop its existing  
sites; and
•  improve the Group’s competitive positioning 
and enable it to take advantage of land 
purchasing opportunities as and when  
they arise in a period of market recovery.
The amended financing arrangements  
will enable the Group to take advantage of 
opportunities that may arise in a recovering 
market, as well as to provide an appropriate 
alternative framework, should a further 
downturn arise.

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ending September 2006
Chief Executive’s Report
Some years it is much easier to write the report to
shareholders than others and the past 12 months
certainly comes into this category. The investment climate
throughout the period has remained relatively benign.
The market’s performance as measured by the FTSE 100
Index has risen by less than 10% but if one ignores a blip
in May and June, it has in fact presented a relatively stable
background against which to advise our clients. We have
however strengthened your Group in a number of ways
and broadened the offering to our clients and this has
shown through in our results. The Group’s profits before
tax for the year ending 30 September 2006 amounted to
£32m against £24.6m (before exceptional item) a year ago,
an increase of 30%. However, within operating expenses
there is an item of £1.2m relating to the one-off cost of
moving to our new Head Office, to which our Chairman
alludes in his statement and if one were to add that back
the increase would be 35%. These profits were earned on
total income of £174m against £145m last year, an
increase of 20%.
We have, as in previous years, made two interim dividend
payments rather than an interim and a final, in order to
distribute the dividends in April and October. A first
interim dividend of 2.5p per share (2p per share in 2005)
was paid on 6 April 2006. A second interim dividend was
paid on 25 October 2006 of 2.75p per share against 2.5p
per share the previous year, making a total for the year of
5.25p per share against 4.5p per share in the previous
year, an increase of 17%. 
Fully diluted earnings per share were 10.6p which
compares with 8.3p if last year’s exceptional item is
excluded, an increase of 28%; 33% if one adjusts for
moving costs. Basic earnings per share were 11.1p
which compares with 6.2p per share previously, an
increase of 79%.
During the past year we have made further good progress
in building the discretionary funds that we manage. In my
report a year ago, I outlined the case for discretionary
management and there is no doubt that it enables us to
give a better service to our clients and at the same time,
by switching the emphasis to a fee based charge, we are
underpinning our earnings for shareholders. The value of
discretionary funds under our management rose to
£8.8 billion at the year end from £6.9 billion a year
previously, an increase of 28%.
This highly satisfactory performance reflects in part a rise
in the underlying values, although the FTSE 100 Index only
rose 8.8% over the same period, and in part switching
from advisory to discretionary management. However, by
far the largest reason for this excellent performance was
the winning of new mandates and clients following those
who have joined us from other houses.

Responding to our clients’ requirements we are now
providing a broader wealth management package for
those that require it. Our financial planners offer
particular expertise on personal pensions and inheritance
tax planning and they have held a number of highly
successful seminars around the country. We have now
established a SIPP administration service through which
we provide personalised portfolios for our clients. Last
year the financial planning team’s turnover rose 76%.

We have been particularly glad to welcome an additional
38 senior client executives and their clients who have
joined us over the past year. It always takes a few months
for these transfers to be completed and accordingly the
full benefit of these additions will not be felt until the
current year. London has benefited the most, where we

Chief Executive’s Report
have welcomed an additional 23 senior client executives
and 10 assistants. In total, we now have 137 client
advisers in our London office and 574 groupwide.
The Belfast office, which we opened last year, continues to
be strengthened. Since the year end we were delighted to
announce the purchase of the Bank of Ireland’s Northern
Ireland private client investment management business
which will be run by our Belfast office.
In August we agreed the purchase of Aberdeen Private
Investors from Aberdeen Asset Management and the
successful transfer of £200 million client funds followed.
This further strengthens our Aberdeen branch and also
represents a valuable addition to our Glasgow branch.
During the year we opened a new branch in Keswick.
Since the year end we have established an office in Oxford
and will be opening an office in Hereford in January 2007.
Our policy of establishing branch offices around the
country, staffed by dedicated and enthusiastic
professionals who we can support with all the same
technology and investment advice as if they were in
London, continues to work well for us in building the
client base and attracting new mandates. We were
pleased to win the Investors Chronicle Award for
“Financial Security and Administration”, being described
as being a clear success story. We were equally delighted
that Stocktrade, our execution only arm, came first in the
same category as “Best On-line Stockbroker”.
We are always updating our technology, but the new
eXimius software which is currently being installed
represents a step change to what has been available to
date. It greatly enhances the portfolio management tools
for our client executives, as well as providing the
information that will be required under MiFID.
Corporate Broking
In addition to private client investment management we
are now acknowledged as one of the leading corporate
brokers for smaller companies. We act as advisers to 133
quoted corporate clients as well as a number of private
companies. Our corporate advisers are based in
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester
and Newcastle branches.  Last year was an excellent one
for the Division as will be seen from their figures:-

Revenues rose by 55% and operating profit increased by
83% and the markets for new and secondary issues were
strong for virtually all of the year . Our existing clients were
active on the acquisition and fund-raising fronts and we
gained our full share of new clients both from initial public
offerings, flotations and from companies already quoted.
Whilst still offering a full service to smaller and micro cap
companies, we have also been increasingly active with
larger clients, a trend that has continued in the new
financial year.
Conclusion
From the foregoing it will be seen that we have made good
progress on many fronts during the past year, particularly
in terms of the increase in the number of clients and
amount of funds using discretionary management. At the
same time we are building the number of experienced
client executives to give clients the personalised attention
that is our trademark. We expect this trend to continue
and it is a key element of our strategy.
I would like to thank all our staff for their hard work and
their commitment to our clients. It is thanks to them that
we can look to the future with considerable confidence.
Additionally, we will have a full year’s contribution from
the teams that have joined us during 2006, further
strengthened by others who will be joining us shortly.

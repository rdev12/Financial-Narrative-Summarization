Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Growing production
capacity for the
inevitable market
recovery.
Dear Fellow Shareholder,
1. Introduction
Operationally, 2011 has been an encouraging year for the Company in which
we have reaped the benefits of the operational turnaround we undertook in
2009 and 2010. Lonmin is a fundamentally healthier business, and is moving 
in the right direction towards clear goals.
However, against the backdrop of a fast changing South African environment
the year has not been without its difficulties either, and I will address these later
in this report.
There are areas which affect our business which we, like our peers, do not
control – the Rand, the price of platinum and, of course, the global economy in
which an international business like Lonmin operates to name but three. In the
last year the entire Lonmin team, from mine to market, has focused relentlessly
on those things we can control and in taking as much uncertainty out of the
business as possible.
I am, therefore, pleased to be able to report that we achieved our revised
Platinum sales guidance of 720,000 ounces and revised unit cost guidance 
of around 11%. Encouragingly, the mines hoisted ore containing 720,000
Platinum ounces, whilst metals in concentrate was 719,000 Platinum ounces,
ahead of 715,000 and 694,000 Platinum ounces delivered last year
respectively. These results are particularly pleasing given the safety issues 
and illegal strike we experienced.
For ten of the twelve months of the year our business delivered according to
plan. In the two months where it did not, we saw factors around safety and an
illegal industrial action at Karee affect performance. The operational review
covers these events in more detail. Those ten months of delivery demonstrate
that when these events do not affect us we are a fundamentally sound and
successful operation. Our challenge is to ensure that those events become 
rare or are eradicated in future.
2. Safety
After many years of improving safety we lost six colleagues in separate fatal
incidents at Marikana in the first seven months of 2011. 
Lonmin, and mining, has been my working life for many years. The shock of
losing colleagues never changes, and the loss of Jonas Thomage Kgwatlha,
Modisaotsile Edward Setlhare, Afiado Mazive, Hermanus Potgieter, Rafael
Macamo and Alpheus Mogane Moerane was felt across the entire business.
“The healthy state of our
ore reserves bode well
for 2012 and we
anticipate sales of
around 750,000 
Platinum ounces.”

Whilst our safety performance was unacceptable I
believe that our fundamental approach to safety
management has been sound and our
commitment to zero harm and safe production
remains undiminished. We carried out a root and
branch review of all of our safety procedures. This
review re-affirmed our basic safety strategy, but
we identified five key areas where we must
improve: leadership development, systems
development and simplification, safety culture,
enabling environment and contractor safety
management.
I’m pleased to say that our safety performance
following the cluster of fatalities mid year improved.
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) for 2011
showed a 19.8% annual improvement. All
employees and management were however in
breach of the balanced score card disqualifier of
four fatalities and as a result, no bonus was
allocated for this target. In the last five months of
the year, at a time when we sought to increase our
throughput, we achieved four million fatality free
shifts across all of the Lonmin operations, an
achievement which we last achieved in 2009
during a time when production was contracting 
as a result of the restructuring programme. I am
also particularly pleased to report that Rowland
shaft’s safety record now leads in the industry
having achieved twelve million fall of ground fatal
free shifts over a ten year period.
The journey to zero harm will take time and require
the continued commitment and dedication of both
management and employees.
3. Operational Overview
Mining
Our Mining Division’s performance demonstrated
continued growth and it is unfortunate that the
excellent momentum established at the beginning
of the year was interrupted by the mid year
fatalities and an illegal strike at Karee operations.
Total tonnes mined were 11.7 million, up 3.7%
from last year, of which 10.9 million tonnes were
from underground operations at Marikana.
Management continued to place emphasis on
quality of mining and improving mining discipline
and the fruits of the processes, procedures,
training and work initiatives are evident in these
results. Notably, the lost momentum on all
operations from the disruptions at Karee was
quickly restored with excellent production being
recorded from June through to September. The
interruptions however had a detrimental effect on
our overall mining figures. 
Hossy, our proof-of-concept mechanised mine
recorded a good year. However, machine
reliability, availability of replacement parts and the
difficulty of attracting and retaining trained artisans
have continued to be major barriers to efficient
production. As a result, we are scaling back on
the mechanised proof-of-concept method to
introduce an element of hybrid mining to some of
the mine areas to mitigate the risk to production. 
Immediately available ore reserves at our Marikana
operations were 2.9 million centares at the end of
2011, a remarkable 8.8% higher than last year.
This level of preparedness allows us to plan our
future growth with confidence. 
Our overall milled grade was 4.40 grammes per
tonne, a reduction of 5.4% against the prior year.
The reduction reflects the slightly higher dilution
resulting from the high levels of development, poor
ground conditions experienced at K3, an overall
lower UG2 in situ underground ore grade and the
proportionate increase in the mining of lower
grade Merensky ore from underground and
opencast. The grade however remains within our
acceptable range.
Our unit costs per PGM ounce increased by
11.2% reflecting the continued inflationary
pressures being felt by the industry in general. 
The unit cost was also impacted by the production
losses arising from the safety stoppages and
illegal strikes. Excluding these two major factors
unit cost was up around 8.0% on a normalised
basis and in line with our original guidance,
demonstrating prudent cost control.
We have made progress with our capital
development with a capital spend of $268 million
during the year mainly at K4, Hossy and Saffy and
at the sub-incline at K3. This will stand us in good
stead with meeting our future production profile.
Processing
The Division delivered solid results. I am delighted
to say the upward trend in concentrator recoveries
we saw early in the year continued with high
levels being sustained throughout 2011. The
underground concentrator recoveries we achieved
of 85.4%, up another 0.7% from 2010, contributed
to the increase in the instantaneous recovery rate,
which was 82.5%, up 3.4 percentage points. We
say more about this key area in the Operational
Review on page 24.
The modifications made to the Number One furnace
during the re-build at the end of 2010 have been
successful, and it operated satisfactorily throughout
the year. Smelter risk will be further reduced in
Quarter three of 2012 when the Number Two
furnace comes online.
The tailings treatment project is on schedule with
three chrome plants commissioned by Xstrata-
Merafe Chrome Ventures and ChromTech, our
partners on the projects, and the Rowland tailings
treatments plant was commissioned in August this
year. The tailings treatment plant at Easterns is due
to be commissioned in early 2012. The projects
will improve our recoveries of PGMs by 2% per
year when fully operational at these plants. [ 08 ]
4. Financial
We completed the refinancing of our bank debt
facilities during the second half of the year, and
replaced $875 million bank debt facilities we had
with $945 million of new facilities on superior
terms. As a result we have extended the maturity
profile of our debt to support our growth and
enhanced our ability to maintain a sound and
efficient balance sheet with some flexibility. Our
net debt position and balance sheet were strong
at year end, and position us well to manage the
prevailing short term global market uncertainties.
5. Growth Plan 
We will continue to focus on maximising the value
of the Marikana asset which has a long life high
quality ore body. Our K3, K4, Saffy and Hossy
shafts drive our growth ambitions. There are new
sub-declines at K3 that will enable us to maintain
the efficiency of this shaft. K4 is a new generation
shaft that comes online in 2012 and will ramp up
production over the next few years. Saffy and
Hossy will continue to ramp up. Combined, these
shafts are the platform for us to reach what we
believe to be Marikana’s optimal production level
of around 950,000 Platinum ounces. The world
events of the last six months demonstrate how
the timetable for delivery of this capacity may be
influenced by external factors.
We now expect the platinum market in 2012 to
remain broadly in balance with a bias to a small
surplus. The recovery in demand we had
previously anticipated may be postponed due 
to these short term difficult market conditions.
We have the capacity to produce 800,000 ounces
of Platinum in 2012. However, given the high risk
of business disruption particularly from Section 54
safety stoppages, our guidance for next year’s
sales is 750,000 Platinum ounces.
The transaction we announced with Shanduka
Group (Proprietary) Limited (Shanduka) on Limpopo
provides a potential development roadmap whilst
enabling our own management to continue to
focus on delivering the value inherent in our
Marikana asset. Akanani is a longer term prospect
and we continue to look at the options that are
available to us whilst completing additional
feasibility work particularly on processing options.
Lonmin is well positioned for the future thanks to
our strategy of investing in ore reserve development.
At the time of our interim results in May, we
announced our plan for organic growth beyond
2013 to reach Marikana's optimal production level
of 950,000 Platinum ounces. We continue to
believe that investing to grow our production
capacity is the right thing to do to enable us to
take advantage of the attractive long term
fundamentals for PGM markets. However, in light
of current economic uncertainty and short term
PGM outlook, together with our objectives of
delivering profitable ounces and maintaining
balance sheet prudence, we will retain flexibility
around our capital expenditure plans and we will
moderate the pace of capacity expansion if the
environment dictates.
Markets Outlook
As I mentioned above, I believe the outlook for the
PGM markets will be challenging in the short term,
influenced by the global uncertainties we have seen
in recent months. However, beyond this horizon
the fundamentals remain sound underpinned by
the tightening emission legislation, demand
growth in non-road emissions control, anticipated
growth in diesel car market share particularly in
the United States and India and growth in gasoline
vehicles in China. The stationary fuel cell market is
real and growing, whilst jewellery is set to remain a
price equaliser in times of slack demand. Growth
in supply from the South African PGM producers
will however remain constrained. 
6. Transformation
The whole management team is clear that issues
around transformation are core to the continued
success and growth of this business. It is a
fundamental element of our licence to operate and
we strive to do it well both because it is right, and
because it is right for our investors.
Equally, a healthy, profitable and growing Lonmin
brings benefits to all of our stakeholders, be they
investors, our employees, the authorities or the
communities in which we operate.
This year we have spent in total, R309 million 
on community projects, hostel conversions,
healthcare delivery, adult learning schemes,
training and provision of bursaries to university
students. Of the 184 students we have sponsored
to date, 157 are HDSAs and 35 are female. Our
management payroll excluding white women,
now includes 32% HDSAs, up from 28% in 2010,
all of whom are merit based appointments.
We strive to achieve good working relationships
with our stakeholders and during the year we
continued to build on the collaborative approach
that we have successfully nurtured in the recent
past particularly with the unions. We are also
working closely with the Bapo Ba-Mogale
community in developing a roadmap that can
unlock the inherent value of their position for the
benefit of the Bapo community as a whole.
Chief Executive Officer’s Review (continued) [ 09 ] 2011 Annual Report and Accounts / Lonmin Plc
www.lonmin.com
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Operating Statistics Shareholder Information
We are exploring initiatives that will enable us to
attain the Mining Charter Phase Two ownership
target by 2014 and have shared our concepts to
achieve this with the Department of Mineral
Resources (DMR). One such initiative is the
Limpopo transaction as it creates the potential
opportunity for Shanduka to become a Black
Economic Empowerment (BEE) PGM mining and
operating company, in line with the DMR’s
empowerment objectives. 
Some of the industry transformation targets are
challenging, However, I believe Lonmin’s
performance to be ahead of industry average in
most areas and we have reproduced our reporting
audited scorecard performance on page 44. 2012
will see our transformation initiatives accelerated
and we look forward to making announcements
on this progress as the year passes.
Social issues are increasingly coming to the fore 
in the public consciousness, in the media and
amongst policy makers. I expect this trend to
continue and grow, presenting fresh challenges 
in the years ahead.
The Transformation and Sustainability sections 
of this annual report on pages 16 and 41 provide
more details about the initiatives we have been
focusing on in this area.
7. Sustainability
We have made some good progress in achieving
our environmental targets. Whilst our total energy
consumption increased by 5.1% in 2011 to 6,533
Terajoules, we have made considerable progress
with our programmes on optimal management of
water resources and atmospheric emissions.
Notwithstanding these initiatives, the PGMs that
we produce are a vital component in autocatalytic
convertors and therefore play a significant role in
reducing air pollution and contributing positively to
the climate.
The Sustainability section of this annual report on
page 41 provides more detail.
8. Guidance
The healthy state of our ore reserves bode well for
2012. We anticipate sales of around 750,000
Platinum ounces in 2012 with additional ounces
coming from the K3 sub-declines, Hossy and
Saffy as they continue to ramp up, and the planned
decline of production from Newman continues.
We expect to improve cost control by driving
productivity to mitigate the increase in our gross
costs. We expect to achieve this, even though our
operations face significant inflationary pressures,
by maximising our efficiencies and economies of
scale as this will enable us to move down the cost
curve. Given this, we anticipate that unit cost will
increase in line with wage increases which we
expect will be in line with those recently achieved
by our two larger competitors.
Our capital spend will mostly be on further
developing K3 and Rowland shafts, ramping up
production at Hossy and Saffy and bringing K4
into production. Our capex guidance for 2012 is
around $450 million, being R3.7 billion. This is
slightly higher than prior guidance due to escalation,
the devaluation of the Rand and minor scope
changes. Most of this spend will be in Rands and
will therefore be subject to Rand strength. 
9. Exco Changes
I was delighted to welcome Natascha Viljoen 
and Thandeka Ncube to the Executive Committee
(Exco) during the year. Natascha assumed the 
role of Executive Vice President (EVP) Processing
following Theuns de Bruyn’s departure and was
part of the team that worked with Theuns in
enhancing our concentrator recoveries. Thandeka
has joined the Exco representing Shanduka and
replacing Rowan Smith and Karishma Sewpersad.
Theuns, Rowan and Karishma leave with our
thanks and good wishes.
10. Employee Thank You
The dedication, support and professionalism of
our employees remain key to our success. I am
proud of the way we have brought our operations
back to good health and established a platform
from which we can grow as a business in the
years ahead.
I would like to end my report this year with a
heartfelt “thank you” to each and every one 
of them.

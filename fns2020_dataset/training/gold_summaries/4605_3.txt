OVERVIEW OF 2008 RESULTS
Overall trading performance during the year was excellent. Profit before 
tax and before exceptionals of £41.9 million was up 66%. Cash flow 
generated from operations at £49.0 million was up 82%, assisted by 
reductions in working capital levels.
Engineered Steel Products made strong progress across the Australian 
and Asian operations. Galvanizing Services was resilient, despite the 
impact of remarkable commodity price volatility on its marketplace. 
Delta EMD produced a significant turnaround from last year’s operating 
loss, benefitting from the decision to reduce production capacity.
Following a competitive market auction, some £450 million of Pensioner 
liabilities were transferred to Pensions Insurance Corporation via the 
purchase of an insured bulk annuity. Delta funded some £50 million 
in cash to facilitate the transaction, which I am relieved to report was 
negotiated and signed prior to the most recent turmoil in the financial 
markets. This represents an important step forward for shareholders 
in reducing the scale and risks associated with the Delta Pension Plan 
(DPP), albeit further action is desirable as and when market conditions 
permit.
Despite funding the above transaction, Group consolidated net cash 
at year end amounted to £109.6m. This, alongside healthy underlying 
cash generation, provides Delta with the ongoing flexibility to continue 
to invest in the core operations, fund add-on acquisitions and when the 
time is right to consider further actions on the DPP.
Key Priorities for 2009
Inevitably, trading conditions will be tougher over the coming year, 
with even the relatively resilient Australian economy having recently 
reported GDP contraction. These impacts are already apparent in some 
businesses to a degree, albeit we expect much of Delta’s portfolio to 
demonstrate defensive characteristics during a downturn. A strong 
operational focus will therefore be high on management’s list of 2009 
priorities. 
The ongoing programme to upgrade plant in existing markets and add 
capacity in new markets will continue so long as these continue to 
demonstrably add to medium and long-term value. Add-on acquisitions 
are likely to become available to cash buyers at more realistic prices 
than previously. These will be actively considered, provided they have 
strategic logic as part of the Delta Group.
“Many businesses would 
envy Delta’s current 
position as we enter a 
downturn, with relatively 
diverse businesses, 
many with defensive 
characteristics, and net 
cash in the bank . . . To 
enhance the marketability 
and attractiveness 
of Delta as an equity 
investment, the Board 
remains keen to pursue  
all options for enhancing 
long-term value for 
shareholders.”

Many businesses would envy Delta’s current position as we enter a 
downturn, with relatively diverse businesses, many with defensive 
characteristics, and net cash in the bank. In the short term, these are 
indeed important assets. Yet the options for the strategic development 
of the Group continue to be limited by the scale, risks and regulatory 
constraints imposed by the DPP. To enhance the marketability 
and attractiveness of Delta as an equity investment, the Board 
remains keen to pursue all options for enhancing long-term value for 
shareholders.
For 2009, operational management’s exclusive focus will be on 
optimising trading performance during the downturn, and on the 
active longer term development of the businesses. At the centre, 
efforts will also focus on further simplifying the Group’s portfolio of 
businesses, generating further net cash in the balance sheet, and on 
monitoring market opportunities to further de-risk and de-scale the 
DPP at fair value. 
DIVIDEND
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 4.6p per share 
(2007: 3.4p per share) which would provide a full year 2008 dividend 
of 6.5p per share (2007: 5.0p per share).

Overview
The Group has made progress in what has been a difficult but 
ultimately productive year.
Our Chief Executive, Neil Gillis, has been leading a turnaround 
programme aimed at restoring the Group to profitability. At the 
start of the turnaround plan, the primary focus was on retail 
standards, reducing the cost base, making better use of working 
capital and strengthening the management team. Good progress 
has been made on all these fronts.
In September 2009, advised by KPMG, Travers Smith and 
Singer Capital Markets, the Board embarked upon the Company 
Voluntary Arrangements (‘CVAs’) for the Company and its 
subsidiary The Outdoor Group Limited which, once approved 
and effective in December 2009, enabled the business to exit 
101 leases, which included 88 trading stores which had not 
been trading profitably for some time. Around the same time, 
the Group placed Sandcity Limited, the loss-making Boardwear 
subsidiary that traded the O’Neill retail brand, into administration.
The effective delivery of the CVAs also enabled the Group to 
successfully agree a two year working capital facility with Bank 
of Scotland plc of up to £42.5m to allow the business to fund 
the CVAs and thereafter commence a store refurbishment 
programme. As a result of the CVAs, at the end of the financial 
year the business was left with a reduced but improved store 
base of 313 sites, comprising 92 Blacks, 208 Millets and 13 
Freespirit stores.
Results
Total Group sales decreased by 7.0% in the year to £249.0m 
(2009: £267.6m). This reflects the reduction in the number 
of trading sites as part of the CVAs and the administration of 
Sandcity which together reduced store numbers by 25.5% from 
420 to 313. Sales during the year also benefited from the closing 
down sales during October and November which helped to 
reduce levels of older stock.
Like-for-like sales for the Group increased by 5.4% in the full 
year but, more reassuringly, from the ongoing estate grew in the 
second half by 9.5% against the same period last year.
A gross margin of 50.7% was achieved in the year (2009: 
54.3%). The reduction in the year was partly due to the business 
promoting more aggressively in a challenging market, but was 
also adversely impacted by the closing down sales in the stores 
affected by the CVAs.
The Group made an operating loss before exceptional items 
of £14.3m (2009: £4.5m) reflecting the worsening economic 
conditions prevalent in the first half of the year, and the under-
performance of Boardwear. 
Within these headline results, the ongoing part of the estate 
made an operating loss of £7.9m after deducting central costs 
appropriate to the whole business (including all distribution and 
marketing costs). Initiatives have already been put in place to 
reduce this level of overhead following the downsizing, and 
reductions at the rate of £5m per annum have been achieved on 
the overhead template for the business.

Loss before tax   (35,714) (7,859) (43,573) (3,368) (46,941)
Exceptional items during the year arose mainly from the need 
to make compensation payments to landlords in respect of 
the CVAs, professional fees associated with the restructuring, 
redundancy costs and provisions for rates relating to closure 
stores for which the Group remains liable. The net exceptional 
operating charges recorded of £27.1m also reflected the release 
of previously held provisions for onerous lease obligations for 
sites which the Group was able to exit as part of the CVAs. 
A breakdown of exceptional items is set out in note 8 to the 
financial statements.
The store closure programme during the year was achieved with 
minimal disruption to the rest of the business, and the clearance 
process was successful in ensuring that inventories were reduced 
by 22% on the previous year level of £50.1m to £39.0m.
Dividend
The Board has decided not to declare a final dividend for the 
year, believing that the performance of the business does not 
warrant the resultant cash outlay. We will resume dividend 
payments as soon as the performance of the Group permits.
Board changes
As announced on 15 July 2009, both Claude Littner and Andrew 
Mallet stepped down as Non-Executive Directors. I would like to 
thank them for their service to the Group.
Current trading and future outlook
Like-for-like sales from the ongoing estate in the first six weeks of 
the new financial year are in line with the strong comparatives of 
2009. 
The Group is now in a strong position to grow the business 
through sensible investment in our stores and expanding into 
geographic areas where we are not currently represented. The 
Company launched an equity raising process on 5 February 
2010 and received strong support from existing shareholders 
and potential new investors. The process was halted when 
Sports Direct International PLC indicated that it may make a 
bid for the business which subsequently failed to materialise. 
As a consequence we are today announcing a revised equity 
fundraising. The additional funding will enable the business to 
accelerate its investment plans, in terms of both opening new 
sites and refurbishing existing sites, whilst at the same time 
reducing average net borrowings. Stock Exchange Code: BSLA

The store opening programme has already got off to a healthy 
start. Funded from cash flow generated by its strong trading 
performance over the winter period, the Group has been able 
to open new stores in Chester, York, Stratford-upon-Avon and 
Cheltenham. The Group has identified an attractive and sizeable 
pipeline of future sites to open in major towns and cities in 
anticipation of the successful completion of the equity raising 
announced today. These sites are appropriate for the new, 
proven store formats and are available at competitive rates.
The Group has also commenced its store refurbishment 
programme with the conversion of the Cambridge Millets store 
to the Blacks fascia. 
Following the CVAs, which enabled the Group to rationalise the 
business and focus its efforts on its Outdoor division, the Group 
has secured a stable and positive base from which to deliver the 
significant growth available from the programme of new store 
openings and the modernisation of the current estate.
Finally, I would also like to thank our staff for the huge 
contribution they have made, and continue to make, during what 
has been a very challenging and demanding period.

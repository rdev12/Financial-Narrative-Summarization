Chief Operating Officer’s review 
A strong Group 
performance 
Against the backdrop of global financial 
uncertainty, generally lower disposable 
incomes and political upheaval in some 
parts of the world, the Group delivered a 
strong performance in 2011, achieving all 
the goals set as part of its long-term 
strategy. Reported revenue grew by over 
3 per cent as a result of continued good 
pricing momentum and stable volumes. 
At constant rates of exchange, revenue 
was up 4 per cent, while on an organic 
basis at constant rates of exchange, it 
increased by 7 per cent.  
The reported profit from operations was 
9 per cent higher at £4,721 million with 
an 11 per cent increase in adjusted profit 
from operations, as explained on page 
34. At constant rates of exchange, the 
adjusted profit increase was 10 per cent. 
All the regions contributed to this good 
profit result. Organic adjusted Group 
profit from operations, at constant  
rates of exchange, also increased by  
10 per cent. 
Group volumes from subsidiaries were 
705 billion, down by 3 billion or 0.4 per 
cent. Organic volumes were also 0.4 per 
cent lower. The Group again grew overall 
market share in its Top 40 markets. 
The four Global Drive Brands achieved 
excellent overall volume growth of 9 per 
cent following the successful launches of 
innovations, resulting in the continued 
improvement in market share. Dunhill 
volumes increased slightly as strong 
growth in Brazil, Romania and the GCC, 
and good performances by Malaysia and 
Russia, were offset by a decline in South 
Korea which was affected by competitor 
pricing. Excluding the volumes in South 
Korea, Dunhill volumes were up 8 per 
cent. Kent was 10 per cent higher with 
increased volumes in Romania, Ukraine, 
Russia, Egypt and Japan. 
Lucky Strike increased volumes by  
14 per cent with growth in Spain, 
Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Chile  
and Brazil. Pall Mall volumes rose by  
11 per cent with strong growth in 
Pakistan, Turkey, Russia and Canada, 
partially offset by lower volumes in 
Mexico and Spain. 
The Group announced at the end of  
2010 that as part of the plans to reduce 
complexity, drive efficiency in 
management structures and achieve a 
better balance in the scale of our regions, 
it had decided to reduce the management 
structure from five to four regions from  
1 January 2011. Markets which 
comprised the Eastern Europe region, 
were merged into the Africa and Middle 
East region and the Western Europe 
region. Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, 
Caucasus and Central Asia form part of 
the new Eastern Europe, Middle East and 
Africa region (EEMEA), while Romania, 
Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania 
and Kosovo form part of the Western 
Europe region. The 2010 information has 
been reallocated on the basis of the new 
regional structure.

 18 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Chairman’s statement 
Together with the interim dividend paid in 
January 2016, this will give a total dividend 
for the year of 25.0p per share (2014/15: 
25.0p per share). Subject to shareholders’ 
approval, the final dividend will be paid 
on 3 August 2016 to shareholders on 
the register on 24 June 2016.
Board changes
There have been significant changes 
to both the Board and the executive 
management team in the past year. 
We have welcomed four new Board 
members since the AGM on 23 July 2015. 
Sabri Challah and Maria da Cunha joined 
the Board as Non-executive Directors to 
replace Warren East and Gill Rider who 
stood down after serving eight years and 
nine years respectively. Sabri Challah was 
appointed Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee in July 2015, replacing Gill Rider. 
Jitesh Sodha, appointed in August 2015 to 
replace Colin Child as Chief Financial Officer, 
and the Group’s Chief Operating Officer 
Rupert Middleton also joined the Board 
as Executive Directors after the 2015 AGM. 
Victoria Jarman has informed the Board 
of her decision to step down after the AGM 
having served six years as a Non-executive 
Director. We are in the advanced stages of 
recruiting a new Non-executive Director to 
the Board whom we anticipate will succeed 
Victoria as Chair of the Audit Committee. 
We would like to thank Victoria for her 
significant contribution she has made 
during her time on the Board.
We believe that the current Board 
composition offers the right balance of 
experience and skills to provide insightful 
strategic guidance as well as robust 
corporate governance to the business.
People
To coincide with the organisational 
restructuring, the Group has also 
embarked on a culture change programme 
initiated by Chief Executive Officer 
Martin Sutherland, which aims to forge a 
dynamic, agile and high performing culture 
throughout the Group. 
As always, I would like to acknowledge 
the skills and dedication of our colleagues 
at De La Rue. They have worked hard 
to deliver a solid performance and good 
strategic progress amid volatile market 
conditions and the many changes that 
have taken place internally.
Outlook
The Group’s 12 month closing order 
book of £365m provides good visibility 
for the year ahead. Whilst, as previously 
announced, a material contract came to 
an end, we are confident we can mitigate 
the impact and our expectations for the 
current year are unchanged.
Group results
I am pleased to report a solid performance 
in a year of important changes for the Group.
Against challenging market conditions, 
the Group delivered 7% revenue
1
 growth 
to £454.5m (2014/15: £422.8m) and 2% 
underlying operating profit
1
 growth to 
£70.4m (2014/15: £69.1m). Underlying 
profit before tax
1
 was 2% higher at £58.5m 
(2014/15: £57.5m) and consequently, 
underlying earnings per share increased 
to 48.1p (2014/15: 46.1p). Net exceptional 
charge before tax
1
 in the period was 
£3.6m (2014/15: £16.9m) primarily relating 
to site relocation and restructuring and 
asset impairment, which were offset by 
an exceptional gain from the sale of land. 
As a result, profit before tax
1
 was 35% 
higher at £54.9m (2014/15: £40.6m).
Underlying operating cash flow, comprising 
underlying operating profit adjusted for 
depreciation and the movement in working 
capital, increased by 17% to £100.2m 
(2014/15: £85.6m). Net debt at 26 March 
2016 was at £106.1m (2014/15: £111.0m).
Strategic progress
We have made good progress in the 
first year of the 2020 strategic plan which 
aims to focus De La Rue into growth 
markets while driving operational efficiency. 
During the year, we have completed a 
review of the manufacturing footprint, 
a key component of the Optimise and Flex 
strategy, and have a clear plan to drive 
efficiency and reduce costs in banknote 
manufacturing. In addition, we decided 
to exit the cash processing business as a 
conclusion of the ‘root and branch’ review. 
We have continued to invest in new 
capabilities and technologies to support 
future growth. The number of patent filings 
more than doubled year on year. The 
Group has launched Active™, a lenticular 
technology-based security thread that 
features a colour shifting effect and has 
designed and launched a new UK passport 
featuring one of our latest inventions, 
Continuous Bio-Data Page™, which helps 
to prevent counterfeiting. The Group has 
also made good progress in its digital 
offering with the launch of its first software 
suites for both Identity and Product 
Authentication and Traceability – DLR 
Identify™ and DLR Certify™, respectively. 
Dividend
We continue to focus on maximising 
shareholder value through a combination 
of growing profits, managing working capital 
better and being disciplined on capital 
expenditure. Taking account of all of these 
factors, the Board proposes to maintain 
the dividend at the 2014/15 level and is 
recommending a final dividend of 16.7p 
per share (2014/15: 16.7p per share).

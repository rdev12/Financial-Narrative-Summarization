 STRATEGIC REPORT
Chairman’s 
statement
This has been a momentous year for  
 
announced our recommended merger with 
Janus Capital Group – the beginning of the  
next stage on our 80 year journey to deliver  
value to our clients and shareholders. 
“Now is the moment for a step 
change. The cross-border 
merger of equals between 
Henderson and Janus will 
create a compelling new global 
brand of an independent,  
active investment manager.”
Richard Gillingwater
Chairman
Pioneering history


made his fortune through investments in 

America, Spain and East Africa, and was  
one of the early pioneers of global investing. 
Evidence of his pioneering spirit remains 

our US business over 15 years ago, there was 

Through sound strategy, dedication and 
constant client focus, our team in the US  
grew our AUM to £15bn at the end of 2016. 
They have been extraordinarily successful, 

Now is the moment for a step change. Janus 
Capital Group (Janus) had AUM of US$151bn 
in the US at the end of 2016 – eight times the 
size of Henderson in the US. The proposed 
cross-border merger of equals between 
Henderson and Janus will create a compelling 
new global, independent, active investment 
manager, with pro-forma AUM of US$322bn, 
which matches the industry distribution of 
 
our progress in a fast-changing world.
A transformational merger
The Board thought carefully and diligently 
about the merits of a transformational merger 
for Henderson’s clients and shareholders, and 

Henderson Group on the New York and 
Australian stock exchanges, not London.
At our strategy day in October 2015, we 
 
become a truly global asset manager, and 
asked the executive team to devote more  
time and energy to exploring options for  
a transformational solution. We undertook  
a thorough process, looking primarily at  
North American companies, until it became 
apparent that there was an opportunity  
to create a compelling merger of equals 

which your Board unanimously recommends.
Cultural alignment
Corporate actions in people businesses  
stand or fall on people-related issues. 

it is critical to the success of the proposed 
merger that our investment teams buy into  
its value, that integration is handled smoothly, 
that our people are treated fairly and – most 
importantly – that we deliver minimum

The Boards of both companies were of the 
view that the continuing presence of the 
CEOs of both companies is essential to this 
process, so we are delighted that Andrew 
Formica and Dick Weil agreed to work 
together as co-CEOs, should the merger be 
approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary 
General Meeting. The excellent chemistry 
between Andrew and Dick mirrors a strong 

across our two organisations. This creates  
the strongest possible backdrop against 
which to execute a complex transaction. 
The Board and senior management of  
Janus Henderson will have a vital role  
to play in shaping and embedding a healthy 
corporate culture in the new organisation.  
The introduction of the FCA’s Senior Managers 
 
will help us focus on setting the values and 
standards of behaviour expected, and will  

strong links between governance and a 
culture that supports long-term success.
Continuing our journey
With attention focused on our merger 
with Janus, it would be easy to overlook 
Henderson’s resilience as a standalone 
business. This annual report – which we 
expect to be our last as Henderson Group  
plc – comments on the turbulent year we  
have experienced from a political perspective 
in the UK, Europe, and the US, but also seeks  
to celebrate the fundamental strength of our 
business, which has positioned us well for  
the next stage of our journey. We cover the 
proposed merger with Janus in the opening 
sections, then focus in the rest of the  
report on the key events of this year from  
a Henderson perspective.
This has been a volatile year for markets, 
politics and our business. Among the 
highlights from the Board’s perspective are 
our engagement with our clients to navigate 
political turmoil, our work with our regulators 
to enhance our product governance 
disciplines and product control procedures, 
and our continued disciplined approach  
to the deployment of capital. 
 
careful stewardship of our business in 
 
before tax of £212.7m (2015: £220.0m) 
 
lower performance fees, in light of softer 
investment performance. Our assets under 
management reached a record £101.0bn 
thanks to positive markets and FX 
 
of client money in our Retail business.
Against this backdrop, the Board is 
 
of 7.30 pence per share, bringing the total 
dividend for the year to 10.5 pence per share, 
a 2% increase over 2015 in sterling terms. 
Henderson operates a progressive dividend 
policy, an approach we intend to carry forward 
into Janus Henderson. 

Board members for the thought, care and 
diligence with which they have discharged 
their stewardship duties. We have had  
a series of special meetings this year to 
consider the merger, and the engagement  
of the Board has always been high. 
 
at Henderson for the positive way in which 
they have embraced the proposed merger 
with Janus, and the whole executive team  
at Henderson for the huge amount of work 
they have undertaken to create the Janus 

with the combined forces of Janus and 
Henderson in the coming years, to continue 
to deliver exceptional value to our clients  
and shareholders.

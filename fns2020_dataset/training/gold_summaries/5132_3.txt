Chairman’s Statement
The Company has begun to prosper 
and is now benefiting from the firm 
foundations that have been put in 
place over recent years.
We entered this year with a clear 
focus on continuing to build a 
strong, growing and sustainable 
revenue stream by developing new 
and innovative ways to serve our 
clients. Despite our good financial 
performance, strong recurring 
revenues and continued international 
growth driven by the demand for 
transparency, benchmarking and 
measurement, the various business 
lines have been imbalanced in 
both geographic reach and scale. 
Traditionally it has proven difficult to 
fully exploit the relationship between 
our different activities.
The acquisition in April 2010 of Xtreme 
Information has addressed, in a 
very material way, the geographic 
reach and balance of our data 
capture capabilities and creates 
a business of scale that can rest 
comfortably alongside the domestic 
and international capabilities in our 
analytics business.
I believe our Company is now better 
positioned than any other in our 
marketplace, not only to help our 
clients understand their performance 
in an increasingly complex market 
environment, but also to provide a far 
greater level of insight, thus enabling 
them to improve their competitive 
performance and marketing 
efficiency. 
We have put in place foundations 
upon which our business can now 
grow significantly on a global basis 
mirroring the business models of our 
clients, both corporate and in the 
agency world. We have the chance 
to penetrate and exploit the market 
opportunity that exists currently.
None of this would have been 
possible without the leadership of 
our management team and the 
commitment of our people. I would 
like to thank the Ebiquity team who 
have been with us throughout the 
year, and also the employees of 
Xtreme whom we welcome into our 
enlarged enterprise with a sense of 
excitement and confidence. 
I would also like to welcome Jeff 
Stevenson and Chris Russell who 
have joined the Board following 
the acquisition of Xtreme. We look 
forward to benefiting from their 
insight and experience.
We have a scalable business and 
an experienced management 
team that have the capability to 
run a much bigger business. We are 
excited about the future.

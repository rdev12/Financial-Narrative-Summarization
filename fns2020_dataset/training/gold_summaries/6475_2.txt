* Underlying pro-forma results are presented to provide a better indication of overall financial
performance. They include the results of GWR and IRN as if the Merger occurred on 1 April 2004,
rather than just from the date of the Merger, 9 May 2005. They exclude the amortisation 
of intangible assets, Merger restructuring costs and other Separately Disclosed Items**.
** Separately Disclosed Items in 2007 consist of goodwill impairment in respect of the disposal 
of the Century stations in Manchester and Newcastle and the investment in UBC. In 2006, they
consisted mainly of Merger restructuring costs, goodwill impairment and the profit on disposal 
of Century 106.
*** Adjusted to remove the effect of the Century disposal.

ROBERT WALTERS AT A GLANCE
In what is an increasingly 
complex and ever-changing 
global recruitment market,  
the Group provides our clients,  
from the largest multinational 
corporates through to SMEs  
and start ups, with an  
end-to-end recruitment  
offering on a global basis.
Our business is all about the development of 
long-term and high-quality relationships with our 
clients and candidates. The recruitment industry 
is unique in that we have two very distinct but 
overlapping stakeholders – our candidates are 
our clients of the future and our clients are our 
potential candidates.
Quality (in terms of relationships and service levels), 
integrity and professionalism are the Group’s 
watch-words and we believe provide a clear point 
of differentiation for the Robert Walters Group.

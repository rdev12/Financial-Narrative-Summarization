 Chairman’s Statement
our expectations for the year.  The average
selling price of homes increased to £171,959
from £150,466 in 2005 as a result of
changes in the mix of properties sold and a
4.1% increase in the price per square foot of
units sold in the year.
One of the most significant achievements in
2006 has been the increase in the number
of plots held for future development. The
land bank has risen to 2,850 plots (2005:
2,030) with a further 209 plots under
contract. This expansion in the land bank
has been financed from our existing bank
facilities and those borrowings are
satisfactorily matched against the value of
the land held for development.
We have a strong and skilled management
team and I wish to thank all our employees
for their efforts during the past year.
Board Changes
As we have already announced both
Stephen North and Brian Leesing retired
from the Board during the year and I would
like, on behalf of the Board, to extend our
sincere thanks for their contributions to the
Company. I would also like to welcome
both Malcolm McDowell and Nick
Godfrey to the Board.  Malcolm replaces
Brian as an independent non-executive
director and chairman of the Audit
Committee, whilst Nick assumed the role
of Finance Director and Company Secretary
on Stephen North’s retirement.
Future Prospects
The housing market remains competitive in
our area of operations.  The impact of
recent rises in interest rates on the demand
for new homes is so far uncertain but it is
possible that this monetary tightening will
deter some first time buyers from entering
the market and this will have a knock on
dampening effect on the demand for all
new homes. Recent competitive tenders for
land have indicated that the cost of land is
increasing significantly faster than house
price inflation and this factor, together with
Results
Your Company has continued to grow in
2006 and has achieved record revenue,
completions of new homes and size of land
bank.
Revenue increased by 18.6% to £122.4m
from £103.2m in the previous year from
the sale of 712 homes as against 686 in
2005. 
Profit before taxation was £11.2m
compared with £12.7m in 2005, partly as a
result of an additional £1.8m interest
charge incurred in financing the significant
increase in our future land bank. At the
operating level, Operating Profits increased
to £16.4m from £16.1m, although margins
declined to 13.4% from 15.6%, as the
volume growth was achieved through the
increased use of incentives and we incurred
certain one-off costs within overheads.
As a result Earnings per Share fell by 13%
to 65.4p (2005: 75.2p).
Review of Operations
2006 was a challenging year in our region
of operations with buyers requiring a
higher level of incentives than in recent
years. Against this background the increase
in sales was hard won and slightly short of

Strategic Review
It was announced on 21 February 2007
that the Company is considering its
strategic options, which may or may not
lead to the Company seeking an offer for
the entire issued share capital of Ben
Bailey Plc.
This review of strategic options is ongoing
and the Company is not presently in
discussions with any potential offerors.
There is no certainty that any sale process
will be undertaken or that if it is, any offer
for the Company will be forthcoming. A
further announcement will be made in
due course.

Chairman
the cost of certain raw materials rising at
well in excess of the general rate of
inflation, may impact on our future
operating margins.
The continuing imbalance between the
demand for and supply of homes in the UK
appears no closer to resolution. However, the
Company has a broad range of homes sited in
attractive locations backed by a strong four
year land bank and this gives us confidence 
in the medium term in delivering satisfactory
returns to shareholders in the future. Our
forward order book for 2007 is also
encouraging - at the date of this report we
already have reservations for 41% of our
forecast output for 2007. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend for
2006 of 12p per share, which together with
the interim dividend of 6p per share paid in
September 2006, will make a total dividend
of 18p for 2006. This is an increase of 20%
compared with 2005 and is a reflection of
the Board’s confidence in the future.

close of business on 10 April 2007 will

Chief Executive’s Review
The many changes that the group has embarked on are outlined
in the Chairman’s Statement.
Details of divisional operational performances for 2006 are as
follows:
Divisional structure
The three divisions — Automotive, Engineering Support Services
and Housewares — have been firmly established and recognised
in their markets. As part of the process each division has adopted
a new identity — the “MRX” prefix and logo — which is building
brand strength as it is rolled out further to our marketplace.
The Operational Board has been established with the Chief
Executives from each division, the Group Financial Controller
together with the two group executive directors. The operational
focus of this forum is another positive and significant change for
the Group.
MRX Automotive
Divisional revenue (including intra-group) increased by 15% to
£42.5 million. However, operating profits (before exceptional
items) fell to £2.2 million from £2.6 million as an initial
consequence of the acquisitions of the Romanian operation and
the Belsize Engineering business.
MRX Automotive is fortunate to participate in several niche
market sectors and, as a consequence, is not immediately
vulnerable to the pressures from major customers to manufacture
from a low cost economy in order to drive costs down. 
However, in March 2006 the Group made a significant strategic
step by acquiring a major facility in Romania. The twenty acre site
offers enormous potential for the future. A £1 million
refurbishment of part of the site is coming to completion and
following the transfer of surplus presses from the UK, production
is about to commence. Orders, never destined for the UK, have
already been won and customer reactions to date have fuelled
our optimism.
The Romanian acquisition included an existing business which in
the period produced a small loss. However, this was outweighed
by the fact that the acquisition was not greenfield, came with an
established English-speaking management team and an
experienced workforce.
Belsize Engineering was bought out of Administration in February
2006 to be merged into the division’s existing fine blanking
operation. However, purchasing the business out of
Administration has been more problematic than was envisaged at
the time.
The phased Belsize move was completed at the end of January
2007, and the freehold site that it occupied has been disposed of
in 2007. Full integration of the business is not expected to be
complete until the end of the second quarter. We now have one
of the largest fine blanking operations in Europe, one that is
potentially highly profitable for the future, in contrast to the
losses and significant exceptional costs incurred in 2006.

The relocation and merger of our two presswork businesses was
successfully completed in the second half of the year. The savings
resulting from moving to one site are already beginning to show
through and the vacated freehold property is on the market. The
combined enlarged business will also take up the new logo and is
now trading as “MRX Automotive”. Prospects for 2007 are good.
Of the remaining businesses in the division, both Toolspec and
Weston Body Hardware produced another year of consistent
profit generation.
At the interim stage we highlighted an unsatisfactory
performance from our diecasting operation. Whilst the rest of the
year fared much the same the prospects for 2007 do appear, at
present, a little brighter. However, in the longer term it remains
vulnerable to an inconsistent level of demand and movements in
the price of its prime raw material, zinc.
MRX Engineering Support Services
Divisional revenue (including intra-group) increased by 37% to
£54.2 million. However, operating profits (before exceptional
items) fell to £3.5 million from £3.8 million.
Metalrax (Bordesley Green), one of the founding businesses of the
group and a major profit contributor in recent years, suffered a
significant shortfall in profit in 2006. An overall reduction in
demand in the sector as a whole was exacerbated by three major
retail customers reducing their activity levels for varying corporate
reasons. The sector has been cyclical historically but there are
signs that 2007 should see a level of improvement.
The Commercial Bearings operation, which occupied part of the
Kenham site, was relocated into available space at Metalrax
(Bordesley Green) and had a satisfactory year.
Our coil coating businesses merged management teams during
the year in preparation for the consolidation of the businesses
onto just one coating line during 2007 as set out in the
Chairman’s Statement. Difficult market conditions resulted in a
drop in profits.
The acquisitions of Stackright Building Systems at the end of 2005
and Makespace Mezzanine Floors in February 2006 have bedded
in well. The relatively small Makespace had a record year,
exceeding expectations. Stackright is a business with great
potential. Profits were ahead of expectations and Stackright’s
presence in its market together with the strength of its
management team bode very well for the future.
The acquisition of Advance Handling, a manufacturer of materials
handling equipment, was most notable for it bringing the
Romanian facility into the group. It endured a difficult year due to
over dependence on a small number of customers. However,
work on product development has aroused interest from potential
new customers making the outlook for 2007 encouraging.

Both of our businesses involved in the construction/contracting
area endured difficult years. Premier Stairways, which had enjoyed
an excellent first full year in 2005, suffered from a combination of
factors. Despite an order book at record levels, problems getting
on to major sites were made worse by a series of troublesome
small contracts at the same time as the factory had reached
capacity. There has been a better start to the new year with
significant order levels and access to sites for major contracts now
being given.
Down & Francis, the steel fabricator, is involved in contracts of a
longer term nature. During 2006 a number of contracts which
commenced in 2005 incurred cost and time over runs absorbing
additional working capital. Management changes have been
made and whilst small, the profit contribution represents a
significant turnaround from the previous year’s losses.
Six of the businesses in the division have adopted the new MRX
brand and are sharing a new customer relationship management
(CRM) system to maximise the potential for cross-selling each
other’s products.
The “MRX Support Services” brand and CRM will offer architects
or project managers on particular construction projects a “one
stop shop” for cabins, structural steelwork, mezzanine floors,
staircases, atriums as well as storage. The initiative shows all the
signs of contributing to growth in 2007.
MRX Housewares
Divisional revenue (including intra-group) was 15% down at
£27.6 million with operating profits (before exceptional items) of
£1.3 million compared to £0.3 million the previous year. 2005
included the discontinued businesses of MRX Plastic Moulders and
Anotrim.
The division is dominated by the bakeware business of George
Wilkinson (Burnley) now known as GW International (“GW”). A
number of years ago GW contributed as much as 25% to
significantly higher Group profits overall. However, by 2005 the
business felt the full effect of cheap imports, particularly from
China, and the combined effect of supermarkets driving prices
down whilst at the same time raw material (steel) prices were
increasing. Although 2006’s performance was no worse than
2005, the Board, in conjunction with KPMG, instigated a profit
enhancement review to determine whether previous levels of
profitability were capable of being achieved again.
The Board has now initiated a plan to downsize GW into a
smaller more profitable business. It will vacate one half of the site
it currently occupies, significantly reduce costs including a
reduction of one-third of the workforce and eliminate low margin
contracts. Initial signs are encouraging.
Our catering supply business enjoyed a better year but operates in
a market again under attack from cheap imports. We have
determined to exit the small home accessories business and GS
Smart will be gradually run down during 2007 following the loss
of a major customer. This will release warehouse/factory space for
better use within the group.
Summary
2006 has been a year of transformation that has presented
challenges to our management teams throughout the group that
they have dealt with admirably. The group now has a secure
foundation on which to build for the future with a clear direction
for its growth.
The reorganisation will continue this year. We aim to transform
GW International into a stronger global player in the housewares
marketplace; further consolidation of our automotive operations
will contribute to expansion in Romania; and selected businesses
in our Engineering Support Services operation will become the
forerunners of the new public face of the group.
There will be significant developments ahead to accompany this
new image as we look forward to a future with many
opportunities for organic growth and selective, strategic
acquisitions.

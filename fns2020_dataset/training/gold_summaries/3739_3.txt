Summary of Chairman’s statement
  MASS performed ahead of expectations
  SCS continued to grow strongly
I am pleased to announce the ﬁrst full year of results for Cohort plc 
since listing on AIM in March 2006. Cohort acquired MASS Consultants 
Limited (MASS) in August 2006 and the new business has settled in well 
and performed ahead of expectations in its ﬁrst nine months within 
the Group. Systems Consultants Services Limited (SCS) continued to 
grow strongly. Overall, Cohort has progressed well and achieved its 
ﬁnancial and strategic objectives for the year.

Proﬁt before goodwill amortisation, share-based payments, interest

Dividends
The Group plans to pay a ﬁnal dividend of 0.9p per ordinary share 
(2006: 0.4p), making the full year dividend in respect of the year 
ended 30 April 2007 1.3p per ordinary share (2006: 0.4p). This will 
be payable on 5 September 2007 to shareholders on the register 
at 10 August 2007 subject to approval at the annual general meeting 
on 30 August 2007.
Board and personnel
On 1 May 2007, the beginning of the new ﬁnancial year, we made 
two new appointments. Rick Bounsall was appointed as Managing 
Director of SCS. Rick was formerly a senior ofﬁcer in the British Army, 
with much experience of managing complex equipment projects. 
I am pleased to welcome Rick to the Group. 
Andy Thomis, formerly Group Corporate Development Director, was 
appointed Managing Director of MASS, an appointment which had been 
vacant since the acquisition of the company. As a consequence of taking 
up this role Andy stepped down from the Cohort plc Board on 9 July 2007. 
Both he and Rick Bounsall sit on the Group Executive Committee.
Since ﬂotation Stanley Carter had fulﬁlled the role of Managing Director 
at SCS as well as being Chief Executive of Cohort and supervising the 
integration of MASS. The appointments of Rick Bounsall and Andy Thomis 
have freed Stanley to spend more time on the development of the Group, 
including by acquisition. I am also closely involved in this process.
I would like to add a warm welcome to all the employees of MASS who 
have joined the Cohort Group. It is a cliché that all businesses are people 
businesses, but one that is true in our case. I would like to thank all 
the Cohort employees for the efforts which have helped to make the 
ﬁrst full year of the Group as a listed Company a successful one.
Outlook
The Group order book at 1 May 2007 stood at £38.3m including an export 
order at MASS of £5.8m received in April 2007. SCS continues to expand 
its business, building on the demand from MOD and industry for technical 
advice which is informed by both theory and military experience.
We continue to look for acquisitions to complement the organic 
development of the business. We are also taking steps to restructure 
our remaining joint venture investments, neither of which is core 
to the Group.
Overall the Board is positive about the outlook for the continued 
progress of the Group.
Nick Prest CBE
Chairman

objectives for the year.

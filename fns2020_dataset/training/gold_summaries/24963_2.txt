• Headline profit before tax up 21%
• Strong growth from Huntsworth Health with profits up 33%
• Challenging trading at Grayling but restructuring now complete
• Final dividend maintained at 1.25p
• 52% of revenue now denominated in USD
The Group has delivered a 21% increase in headline profits as a result of 
strong growth in Huntsworth Health, Citigate Dewe Rogerson and Red, 
together with favourable movements in exchange rates. While Grayling 
declined, the restructuring is now complete and as a result the division is 
well-placed to return to profitability in 2017 .
The Group is now positioned for continued growth, led by Huntsworth 
Health and supported by favourable exchange rates.

Our business lines
Since 1 January 2017 , we have organised our operations into 
four global market-facing business lines. This structure aligns 
our organisation with our customers, helping us to meet their 
needs more effectively and efficiently. 
Our structure aligns  
our organisation with 
our customers.
Environment & 
Infrastructure
Our Environment & 
Infrastructure business 
focuses on environmental 
consulting, engineering 
design and programme and 
construction management.
We offer complete solutions 
to public and private-sector 
customers worldwide. 
Our customers benefit 
from experts with a broad 
understanding of local 
conditions, coupled with easy 
access to world-renowned 
technical expertise.
By positioning ourselves 
as a trusted partner at the 
beginning of a project – often 
the early site development 
and permitting stage – we 
can deliver comprehensive 
solutions across the lifecycle 
of our customers’ assets.
Our Environment & 
Infrastructure business 
consists of the following 
sectors: water; transportation; 
civil infrastructure; 
government; and industrial 
and pharmaceutical.
Customers include the  
US Federal Government,  
which is the largest procurer  
of environmental services  
in the world. 
Mining
We provide mining 
consultancy (including ore 
resource estimation, mine 
planning and feasibility 
studies), design, and 
project and construction 
management services to a 
range of mining companies, 
primarily in the Americas  
and Africa. 
The Mining business is 
intentionally diversified 
and we have developed 
technical capabilities in a 
range of commodities, which 
differentiate us from our 
competitors. We have a strong 
position in the recent growth 
commodities of potash, gold 
and lithium, among others. 
The breadth of our capabilities 
allows us to respond to growing 
demand for a particular 
commodity and to mitigate the 
impact of market volatility and 
changing customer focus.
T erra Nova T echnologies 
is a project group within 
the Mining business that 
designs and builds material 
handling solutions, such as 
high speed conveyor belts 
and crushing plants, for new 
and existing mines.
Power & Process
In renewables, our focus is on 
delivering customer projects, 
primarily for local utilities. 
We provide a full-service 
engineering, procurement and 
construction solution for wind, 
solar, biomass and biofuels 
projects. US solar is our 
primary market in Power.
Within the conventional 
power market, we work with 
utilities to upgrade and modify 
their existing assets, often 
in relation to environmental 
or regulatory compliance 
requirements, by providing 
consulting and engineering 
services, as well as project 
delivery solutions.
We also have an extensive 
track record of serving a 
broad range of industrial 
customers, such as the pulp 
and paper industry, with their 
process, steam and power 
needs. We provide them with 
consulting and engineering 
services, as well as project 
delivery solutions.
Oil, Gas & Chemicals
The Oil, Gas & Chemicals value 
chain has three segments: 
upstream, which involves 
exploration and production; 
midstream, which includes 
transportation and natural gas 
processing; and downstream, 
which is mainly the refining 
and petrochemical industries. 
We operate in every part of the 
project delivery phase of this 
value chain, except early cycle 
exploration and drilling. 
The majority of our upstream 
activity is currently in 
conventional oil and gas 
fields, in particular offshore oil 
facilities, providing feasibility 
studies, front-end engineering 
design, detailed engineering, 
project management, hook up 
and commissioning, and asset 
support services. 
In midstream, we support 
assets focused on storage and 
transport for both onshore 
and offshore facilities, as well 
as gas monetisation projects. 
For downstream customers, 
we focus on refinery projects 
and chemicals.
We serve a broad range 
of customers, including 
international oil companies, 
national oil companies  
and independent operators 
in Europe, the Americas, 
the Middle East, Africa, the 
Caspian, Southeast Asia  
and China. 04

Disposal programme
Over the past 12 months, the board has decided to dispose  
of a number of non-core businesses and assets, including:
 X Our Global Power Group (GPG), which offers a full range 
of steam generator equipment, clean air technologies, 
aftermarket products and services to the power, industrial, 
and waste-to-energy sectors 
The sale of GPG, originally announced in March 2016, has 
taken longer than expected. In November 2016, we decided 
to split GPG and pursue a plan to sell the parts to different 
parties. The disposal of the major part, the circulating  
fluidised bed (CFB) boiler business, to Sumitomo Heavy 
Industries, Ltd. for £137m, is expected to close in June 2017 .  
We anticipate selling further parts of GPG before the end of 
2017 . The aftermarket sales business is being retained as  
part of Power & Process.
 X Our Australian-based specialist consultancy, Aquenta 
Consulting, which provides cost, risk, project management 
and asset optimisation services to a broad range of 
customers, mainly in the property and infrastructure space. 
The sale of Aquenta to Jacobs Group (Australia) Pty Ltd  
for £21m closed in early 2017
 X Our equity interests in three infrastructure assets.  
These are PetroPower, a waste-to-energy project in Chile; 
Amec Foster Wheeler Power, which operates two wind farms 
in Italy; and the Incheon Bridge in South Korea. Subject to 
final completion, these are expected to realise proceeds 
totalling £88m 
 X Our nuclear business, which supports the full lifecycle 
of nuclear energy and has experience of a wide range of 
nuclear technology. Its customers include major utilities, 
governments, national regulators, reactor suppliers and other 
significant stakeholders. The sale process is continuing and  
we are on target to sell the business in the third quarter of 2017

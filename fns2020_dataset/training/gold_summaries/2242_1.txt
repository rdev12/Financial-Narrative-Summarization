Overview
I am pleased to report an excellent set of results for
the year. In making comparison to 2007 , it is important
to remember that the 2007 results included the
launch of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the
last volume of JK Rowling’s series, one of the highest
selling books in publishing history. During 2008 the
Group was restructured into two overarching
divisions: Specialist and Trade. This was done to
provide greater focus on the two key strands of

our business and to ensure that the intellectual
property within each division is exploited to its
maximum potential across all territories in which
those divisions operate. At the same time, and as part
of this change in operating structure, we identified
and implemented significant annualised cost savings
net of expansion activities of approximately £2m.
Managing the Group’s cost base continues to be 
a high priority.
Bloomsbury had the two highest selling books of the
year in the Times list of Top Bestsellers of 2008 and
three of the top ten. A Thousand Splendid Suns was
number one, The Tales of Beedle the Bard, published
by the Children’s High Level Group charity, was
number two, and The Kite Runner was number eight.
In 2008 overall sales by value in the UK publishing
industry, through UK retail outlets as tracked by
Nielsen BookScan, showed a year-on-year decline of
1.5%, but a slight increase if Harry Potter is excluded
from the 2007 figures. Other geographical markets
have shown similar trends, although the relative value
for money represented by books has mitigated the
impact of overall consumer spending restraint.
Of greater concern than sales value is the threat to
retailers and the potential reduction of outlets for
book sales. To date, the only significant casualties 
in the UK have been Zavvi and the Woolworths 
Group, but a number of other customers in overseas
territories have also failed. We have so far avoided
material damage from these insolvencies and 
have benefited from our credit insurance where
appropriate. 
It has also been pleasing that both Bloomsbury USA
and Berlin Verlag recorded profits in difficult markets. 
Technology for the marketing and delivery of books 
is having an impact on the industry and opening 
up medium-term opportunities for new income
streams and more effective customer contact. We 
are embracing these changes on many fronts and 
in particular now have a comprehensive digital 
archive for exploitation.

Financial performance
Revenue for the Group was £99.95m (2007 , £150.21m).
In 2007 we published Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows which made a significant contribution during
that financial year. Revenues from Continental Europe,
which were generated by Berlin Verlag, increased
35.6% to £11.57m (2007 , £8.53m). Revenues from the
US operations increased by 29.4% to £17 .32m 
(2007 , £13.39m). 
Profit before tax for the Group was £11.63m 
(2007 , £17 .86m). Basic earnings per share was 
10.67 pence (2007 , 16.06 pence). Diluted earnings 
per share was 10.67 pence (2007 , 15.63 pence).
At the year end the Group had increased its net cash
balances to £51.91m (2007 , £47 .56m) after the net
cash consideration of £7 .43m (2007 , £0.08m) paid 
for the four acquisitions made during the reporting
period. We continue to invest in future growth through
acquiring new authors, new titles and specialist
publishing companies. Our strong balance sheet 
puts us in an excellent position to take advantage 
of these opportunities as they arise. As at 
31 December 2008, the Group had under contract
1,139 titles (2007 , 1,240) for future publication, with
a gross investment of £26.44m (2007 , £27 .58m). 
After payment of the initial tranches of advances 
to authors, our liability for future cash payments 
on these contracted titles at that date was £15.60m
(2007 , £16.32m). 
Specialist Publishing Division
Expansion of the Specialist Division in 2008 has been underpinned
by solid organic growth from A&C Black throughout the world and
by a number of strategic acquisitions and partnerships. Acquisitions
included:
■ Featherstone, acquired in March 2008, a specialist educational
publisher aimed at teachers and professionals who work with 
0-7 year olds. The list is complementary to A&C Black’s leading
lists in primary education and teacher resources and is now
successfully integrated into our schools sales and marketing
organisation.
■ Berg Publishers, acquired in September 2008, a specialist
Oxford-based academic publisher of books and journals aimed 
at students and professionals in the subjects of design, fashion,
anthropology, history and craft.

■ John Wisden & Co, acquired in November
2008, is the UK’s and the world’s best-known
sports yearbook, with its annual Almanack
approaching its 150
th
anniversary. Wisden
Cricketers’ Almanack will join our other famous
reference titles including Who’s Who, Whitaker’s
Almanack, Writers’ & Artists’ Y earbook and
best-selling sports books such as the Know the
Game series. The great names in cricket have
been contributors to Wisden, from Sir Neville
Cardus to Mike Atherton. New books for 2009
include Wisden on the Ashes.
■ The Arden Shakespeare, purchased in December
2008, publishes the premier scholarly editions of
Shakespeare worldwide. It is being integrated into
Methuen Drama, a list which has shown strong
organic growth since its acquisition in 2006, with a
number of important new estates signed, including
Arthur Miller and George Bernard Shaw. We
expect similar growth from Arden which will
benefit from the global sales and marketing
operation already in place for Methuen and in
particular sales being handled through Bloomsbury
USA’s operation.

Chief Executive’s Statement
In September 2008, Bloomsbury launched its own
scholarly imprint, Bloomsbury Academic, specialising
initially in the humanities and social sciences.
Publications will be available on the internet free of
charge and will carry Creative Commons licences.
Simultaneously, physical books will be produced and
sold on normal business terms around the world. For
the first time a major publishing company is opening
up an entirely new imprint to be accessed easily 
and freely on the internet. By supporting scholarly
communication in this way, our authors will be better
served in the digital age.
Bloomsbury Academic

In 2008 Bloomsbury’s activities in database
development and the Middle East were brought
together within the Specialist Division under the
umbrella of a new subsidiary, Bloomsbury Information
Ltd. Excellent progress continues on QFINANCE, the
finance information resource being developed as part
of the strategic partnership with the Qatar Financial
Centre Authority. This is due to launch as a book and
an online portal in Autumn 2009. 
Qatar Finance – The Ultimate
Resource is a unique pr oject
of global significance. It will 
be the first definitive guide
and r efer ence to the financial
world today and will become
the globally r ecognised print
and online first point of
reference for people invol ved
in finance fr om business
leaders to students and 
all levels in between.

Chief Executive’s Statement
In October 2008 Bloomsbury’s new partnership 
with the Qatar Foundation (www.qf.org.qa), the 
Doha-based educational foundation, was announced
at the Frankfurt Book Fair. This second significant
agreement with Qatar is for the development of a
three-fold business plan: firstly to publish books in
Arabic and English, secondly to encourage reading
and writing development initiatives, and thirdly to
transfer publishing skills and knowledge to Qatar. 
We appointed a new Business Development 
Director during the year to develop further database
and IP projects, as these remain an area of focus for
the Group.

We are delighted to announce this partnership
with Qatar Foundation. Our aim is not simply 
to publish in the region, but also internationally,
to identify and nurture literary talent and to 
help to bring new skills and knowledge to 
Qatar. We also want to work in partnership 
with other publishers in the region. This is 
an exciting project for both parties.

Richard Charkin’s appointment has had a hugely
positive impact on the success and leadership of the
Trade Publishing Division since he joined in the final
quarter of 2007 . 2008 has been a year of consolidating
our strategy for acquiring rights across as many
territories as possible, using digital infrastructure 
for the marketing, selling and delivery of titles, and
ensuring our cost base is appropriate for the business. 
In spite of the global downturn, we have been able 
to record good sales across all our publishing genres
in our three key markets of USA, UK and Germany
thanks to carefully targeted marketing, high-quality
sales and distribution and excellent books. Clearly a
number of retailers have suffered cash flow problems,
but we have managed our exposure very carefully in
order to protect our profits.
We have seen the benefits from actions taken in 
2007 and early 2008 to reduce overhead and office
costs and the renegotiation of key print, sales and
distribution contracts. 
On the digital front we have signed a significant deal
for the distribution of our books on the Sony e-reader
and other devices. 
Children’s
JK Rowling’s The T ales of Beedle the Bard, published
by the charity, The Children’s High Level Group using
Bloomsbury’s editorial, design, production, sales and
marketing, was the best-selling title of the year in
many countries of the world. With this venture, 
we have raised a significant amount of money 
for the charity.
Wherever possible, we publish titles in English and in
German for sale throughout the world so that we can
keep prices as low as possible, a vital ingredient for
the success of children’s books in particular.
2009 will see a very strong roster of titles including
new books from Sue Limb, Sally Grindley, Angie Sage,
Debi Gliori, Shannon Hale and Children’s Laureate,
Michael Rosen.

Adult
2008 was an excellent year for the novels of Khaled
Hosseini, even surpassing 2007’s excellent sales. 
The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns
dominated best-seller lists in the UK, Germany,
Australia, South Africa, India and many other 
territories. Other international successes included
Kate Summerscale’s The Suspicions of Mr Whicher, 
Elizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray, Love, Heston
Blumenthal’s The Big Fat Duck Cookbook, Alice
Schroeder’s biography of Warren Buffett, The
Snowball and Jonathan Littell’s controversial novel,
Die Wohlgesinnten.
The strong programme continues in 2009 with
exciting new titles from William Boyd, Margaret
Atwood, David Kynaston, William Dalrymple, Hugh
Fearnley-Whittingstall, Monty Don, Anne Michaels,
Marc Fitten, Roger Boyes and Kamila Shamsie’s
Burnt Shadows which has been long-listed for the
Orange Prize.
Dividend
The Directors are recommending a final dividend 
of 3.47 pence per share (2007 , 3.30 pence) making 
a total of 4.22 pence per share (2007 , 4.00 pence) 
for the year. This represents a 5.5% increase in the
full-year dividend. The final dividend will be payable 
on 1 July 2009 to Ordinary Shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 22 May 2009.
In spite of the global downturn, 
we have been able to record good
sales across all our publishing
genres in our three key markets

Directors’ Report-Business Review
Chief Executive’s Statement
. . . we are in a good position to expand our academic
division, as we make new acquisitions, and to pursue
organic growth for our existing divisions.
Management and staff
I would like to thank our staff for their tremendous
contribution to a very busy year where we have seen
major strategic as well as operational achievements. 
Current trading, developments and
prospects
The Group has a number of strengths and
opportunities in 2009 and also a number of risks 
and areas of caution which have been heightened 
by the recession. Visibility of future revenue has 
been decreased due to the current uncertainty 
in the global market place, though books have 
fared better than many other consumer products.
In terms of potential bestsellers in 2009 our year
started well with the paperback of The Suspicions of
Mr Whicher reaching the number one position, and
our list for the second half is as strong as it has ever
been with new works by some of the world’s greatest
and most successful writers, including John Irving,
Margaret Atwood and William Boyd. Having said this
however, both unit sales of our bestsellers and our
backlist bestsellers might be lower in the later part of
2009 than in 2008 due to caution in the world-wide
booktrade and the possibility of losing whole
distribution channels in the event that more key
customers have liquidity problems or go out of
business entirely.

In terms of rights and database deals and
management contracts, the Company had a strong
2008 with a number of long-term contracts having
been signed. We also have very strong new projects
on offer in 2009 which compare favourably to the
same stage in 2008. Such deals depend on the
strength and appetite of large third-party partners and
it cannot be ruled out that either the number of deals
or the size of them will be affected by the impact of
the global economy on those third parties later in the
year. There is a risk, for instance, of decreased
government spending on books in schools,
universities and libraries.
We have a strong balance sheet with in excess of 
£50 million on deposit, and, though investment
income will be less than in 2008 due to the reduction
in interest rates, we are in a good position to expand
our academic division, as we make new acquisitions,
and to pursue organic growth for our existing divisions.

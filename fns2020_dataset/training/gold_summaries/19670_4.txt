What we provide
Providing high-quality patient care is  
our top priority. To improve our patient

wide range of services and treatments  
at each stage of the care pathway: from 
initial GP referral, through consultation, 
diagnosis and treatment, to recovery  
and rehabilitation.
Market trends
• Demand growth – driven by a growing 
and ageing population – with a higher 
incidence of long-term and chronic 
conditions, such as cancer, obesity  
and diabetes.
• NHS funding gap – funding constraints 
are forecast to continue throughout 
this Parliament. The independent sector 
can help to bridge the gap.
Who we serve
Our hospitals span the country, serving  
a diversified patient mix, made up of 
private medical insurance (PMI), Self-pay 
and NHS patients.

STRATEGIC REPORT
4 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 Five reasons to invest in Spire Healthcare
Attractive and fast-growing market
The UK private healthcare market is expected to  
grow as the persistent supply and demand gap in  
publicly funded healthcare continues to widen, resulting  
in longer waiting lists and increasing the restriction of the 
availability of procedures by the NHS. We have a stable 
platform for the future and are seeing real evidence of 
market growth.
Well positioned to meet market needs
Our broad network of hospitals, aligned with major 
population centres and our areas of speciality and  
acuity, position us to address key market opportunities.  
Our financial resilience and development projects under 
way put us in a strong position to gain market share.
Strategy for diversified growth across 
payor groups
We have a clear and focused plan to grow the business 
across all of our three payor groups. In addition, Spire 
Healthcare benefits from an inherent ‘payor hedge’ 
amongst its payor groups. With these three separate 
groups we are well placed to weather any market volatility. 
On track to deliver significant  
capacity growth
We continue to invest in new operating theatres, hospitals 
and cancer centres to meet the growing demand and  
to fill geographical and speciality gaps in the market. We 
explore investment opportunities in our existing network 
so as to add additional capacity to meet increased demand 
over time.
Strong cash flows and balance sheet
We are focused on ensuring that our sales are converted 
into strong cash flows to finance capital expenditure to 
maintain and improve the current asset base, to grow 
capacity as far as possible out of free cash flow and to 
provide a dividend return to shareholders. All in all, our 
business is highly cash generative, as demonstrated in  
this report.

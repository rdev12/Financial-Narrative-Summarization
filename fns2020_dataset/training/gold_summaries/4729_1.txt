STRATEGIC REPORT
Chairman and Chief Executive’s statement
Overview 
The adoption of LED technology continued through 2014 into many 
market segments, particularly, streetlights and commercial lighting. 
Dialight has continued to focus on its niche markets where LED 
technology builds defensible positions and delivers efficient payback to 
customers. Lighting and the Obstruction business (part of the Signals 
segment) performed strongly and with the exception of our traffic signals 
business, the balance of the Group also performed well.
Group revenue in the year grew by 22% to £159.8m from £131.2m 
in 2013. Underlying operating profit increased by 24.6% to £18.1m 
in the year mainly as a result of the increased profit from Lighting 
and Obstruction. 
Non-underlying net costs of £2.3m (2013: £2.9m) were incurred during 
the year. Profit before tax was £15.5m (2013: £11.2m). 
Underlying earnings per share (“EPS”) was 36.8 pence (2013: 30.8 pence) 
with basic EPS of 29.4 pence (2013: 26.2 pence). 
Net cash at 31 December 2014 was £0.6m (2013: £7.1m). The four year 
unsecured £25m HSBC Revolving Credit Facility, arranged in the year, 
financed the working capital to support the significant growth in lighting.
Dividend
The Board is recommending, subject to approval by shareholders, a final 
dividend of 9.8p (2013: 9.5p) giving a total dividend for the year of 15.0p 
(2013: 14.4p). This will be paid on 2 June 2015 to shareholders on the 
register at 1 May 2015. 
People
Our colleagues are instrumental to the ongoing success of the business. 
We now employ over 2,300 people across the Group and our growth 
ambitions provide our colleagues with rewarding careers. We would 
like to thank everyone for their continued dedication and hard work 
throughout the year and into 2015.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Board changes
As noted last year, Mark Fryer stepped down as Group Finance Director 
at the beginning of 2014. In June 2014, we announced the appointment 
of Fariyal Khanbabi as our new Group Finance Director, who started on 
8 September 2014. During the period until July 2014, Kevin Higginson 
joined us as Interim Chief Financial Officer but was not appointed 
to the Board.
As part of our trading update released on 16 January 2015, we advised 
that Roy Burton, Group Chief Executive, had informed the Board that 
he was undergoing treatment for a medical condition which impacted on 
his ability to travel at that time. Since that announcement, Roy has further 
advised the Board, as a consequence of that medical condition, of his 
intention to step down as Group Chief Executive from 2 March 2015, which 
we announced on 2 February 2015. As part of that announcement we 
advised that Richard Stuckes, a Non-Executive Director of the Company 
since 2009, had been appointed as Interim Group Chief Executive 
and assumed all executive responsibilities from 2 February. 
Richard has extensive and relevant experience which will fully equip him 
to lead the Company in the interim period. Our Nominations Committee 
is undertaking, with the assistance of an external recruitment agency, the 
process for appointing a new Group Chief Executive. Our Board is grateful 
for Richard being available to step into the role at this stage. 
We would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Board to place on 
record our thanks to Roy for the outstanding contribution he has made to 
the development of Dialight during the past 13 years. All who know Roy 
will recognise the extent to which the business has benefitted from his vision 
and relentless energy in building the platform for growth that he leaves as 
his legacy. More importantly we take this opportunity to offer our best 
wishes to Roy for his recovery.
Roy will remain available to provide counsel and assistance.
Outlook 
The adoption of LED lighting in the industrial and hazardous markets is 
still at an early stage and the opportunity for growth remains significant. 
We continue to see strong demand for our LED lighting and the Board 
remains confident in the future prospects of the Group.

Chairman  Interim Group Chief Executive
The results benefitted from continued 
development of our sales channels 
and new product innovation.”

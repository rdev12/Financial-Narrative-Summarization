How we create value
Expand 
Our strategy is to continue to expand 
our revenue and further internationalise 
the Group, through organic growth 
and through bolt-on acquisitions to 
improve the scale of our operations 
in a specific market or expand 
the depth of our services.
Focus
Our strategy is to focus solely  
on niche services that have  
high barriers to entry, significant 
value-added content, and a 
global potential. 
Cost leadership
Our strategy is to exercise Group-wide 
cost leadership, in order to best focus 
our resources on delivering our 
customers’ needs.
Differentiate
Our strategy is to differentiate our 
services through our people, via our 
shared values of achievement, integrity, 
accountability and innovation, and 
through our investments in technology.

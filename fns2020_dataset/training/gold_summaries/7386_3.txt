Overview Annual report 2008
Results
Our businesses in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA ”) region 
continued to thrive and the successful integration of two important acquisitions
signiﬁcantly strengthened our position as the leading regional pharmaceutical
manufacturer. In line with our commitment to become a leading global speciality
pharmaceutical company, we also made excellent progress in our Injectables
business, where revenues grew by 23.2%. W e are making good progress in
implementing our oncology strategy. Against these areas of progress, we faced
some difﬁculties in our US Generics business, where the extremely competitive
trading environment made it difﬁcult for us to offset the completion of a large
government contract. I am pleased to report that we took prompt management
action and successfully restored this business to proﬁtability by the end of 
the year.
For the year we delivered record revenues of $580.7 million and total revenue
growth of 29.4%. The impact of the difﬁculties in our US Generics business 
in the ﬁrst half of 2008 resulted in a lower gross margin for the Group of 
44.2%, compared with 49.4% in 2007, and a decline of 12.7% in our operating
proﬁt to $80.7 million. However, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA) declined by only 1.7% to $113.8 million and 
on an adjusted basis operating proﬁt decreased by 1%. Proﬁt attributable 
to shareholders for the period declined by 8.7% to $57.1 million, but on an 
adjusted basis increased by 4.5%. Diluted earnings per share declined by 16.4% to
29.6 cents per share. Impressively, our operating cash ﬂow reached $75.0 million,
an increase of 40.7%, through a strong focus on working capital management.  
Dividend
In order to pursue our growth strategy and mindful of the difﬁcult economic
times in which the world ﬁnds itself, the Board has recommended that the
dividend should be held this year. Therefore the Board is recommending a ﬁnal
dividend of 4.0 cents per share (approximately 2.8 pence per share), which will
make a dividend for the full year of 7.5 cents per share, the same as paid in 2007. 
The proposed ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 2 June 2009 to shareholders on 
the register on 1 May 2009, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting.
Chairman’s review

Balance sheet developments 
In January 2008 we raised gross proceeds of £81.6 million (approximately 
$160 million) through the placing of 17 million ordinary shares to fund the
December 2007 acquisition of Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co. Ltd
(“ APM”). W e ended 2008 with net debt of $170.9 million, compared with 
$306.8 million at the end of 2007, reﬂecting not only the equity issue but also
higher operating cash ﬂow from improved management of our working capital.
W e are well invested and as a result our balance sheet is strong, with over 
$63 million in cash at the year-end and unutilised loan facilities of $121 million
across multiple geographies.  
Outlook
With 60% of our sales generated in the MENA region, Hikma should continue to
beneﬁt from the overall pharmaceutical market growth in this region, which we
expect will remain much higher than the global market. Our share of the MENA
market should also continue to increase as we further penetrate existing markets,
expand into new markets and grow our portfolio of own-brand and in-licensed
products. With new products and entry into new markets, we believe that there
remains considerable scope for us to grow our global Injectables business,
particularly in the MENA region but also in the US and Europe. W e expect our
performance in our US Generics business, which returned to proﬁtability in the
fourth quarter of 2008, to continue to improve.  
In summary, I am highly conﬁdent in the Company’s prospects for this year
and the years to come. This conﬁdence is based on the strength of our Branded
and Injectables businesses, the recovery in the Generics business that we have
already begun to experience, and the excellent management team that we have 
in place.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 2 This year, as you already may know, we have taken decisive actions

future performance and success of Stem Cell Sciences.

of identifying new and emerging science that can be leveraged into 
both current and future commercial stem cell product offerings. A key

when added to stem cell media, increase the robustness of cells allowing 
the large-scale automated production needed for industrial research  
and clinical applications, an important step forward. SCS now holds  
a worldwide licence for the use of this technology.
Our commercial development was recognised in 2007, reflected in 
agreements with Merck & Co. for use of our mouse neural stem (NS) cell 
technology for research use and a large pharma partner in the diabetes

which will hopefully lead to new advances in CNS research, particularly  
in multiple sclerosis.
A major event for the Company during 2007 was our successful stock 
exchange listing in Australia (ASX: STC). The support received by the 
investment community there has been highly satisfying and appreciated. 
We believe one of our most important tasks is not just to ensure a strong 
current performance, but at the same time to create the conditions for 
long-term success. Last year we took a major stride in that direction, in the 
interest of the Company, our employees and, of course, our shareholders.

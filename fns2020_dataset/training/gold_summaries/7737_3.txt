Chairman’ s Statement
IdaTech made good progress 
towards its long-term goals  
in what was a challenging year 
due to the worldwide economic 
downturn. The key objectives  
of IdaTech during the year  
were to increase the number  
of units sold into commercial 
field deployments, increase  
the number of customers with 
whom IdaTech’s products are 
certified and drive down costs.
In 2008, revenue derived from product 
sales increased 2.5 times to US$2.4 
million over that in 2007, with 83 
ElectraGen™ units and nine iGen™ sold 
(2007 32 and nil respectively), the vast 
majority within Latin America and 
North America. In addition, IdaTech 
doubled the number of customers with 
whom it is qualified as a certified vendor 
to 10.
In October 2008, IdaTech entered into 
an agreement for a large scale order 
with the Indian ACME Telepower Group 
(“ACME”) for the development and 
delivery of 10,000 units commencing  
in 2009 with a possibility for a further  
two orders of 10,000 each for delivery 
between 2011 and 2013. The successful 
delivery of a contract of this size 
inevitably carries significant cost  
and specification challenges. 
Notwithstanding these challenges, 
IdaTech has made huge steps forward 
during the year.
Good progress towards our long-term goals

Financial overview
The prior period reported in the financial 
statements consists of a long period  
of account from 13 July 2006 to  
31 December 2007. In order to present  
a meaningful overview of the Group’s 
activities the following financial 
overview compares the results for 2008 
with the unaudited pro forma results  
for the year to 31 December 2007.
Total sales increased 16.8% to US$5.9 
million in 2008 compared with the 
unaudited pro forma result for the year 
to 31 December 2007 of US$5.1 million. 
The increase in product sales of US$1.4 
million over that in 2007 was offset by  
a decrease in project-related revenue of 
US$0.4 million as IdaTech concentrated 
its focus on the ACME agreement in the 
latter part of 2008.
The operating loss for the year to  
31 December 2008 was US$21.9 million 
(2007 US$16.3 million) as a result of  
the planned investment in operations, 
research and development and sales. 
Cash flow utilised by operations 
increased to US$18.1 million in the year 
(2007 US$13.6 million after a tax receipt 
of US$0.3 million).
Funding
IdaTech’s majority shareholder, Investec, 
has indicated its intention to provide 
financial support for the Company  
for at least 12 months from the date  
of signing these financial statements.  
As a result of this support, these 
financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis.  
The Board believes additional funding 
will be needed in order to reach cash 
breakeven. Further details are included 
in the Director’s Report.
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank everyone at IdaTech for their hard 
work, dedication and ability to rise to 
the numerous challenges that faced the 
Company in 2008.
With the skill and experience within the 
Group, IdaTech is very well placed to 
take advantage of the significant 
opportunities that will arise over the 
next few years.

Global Footprint
United States
In our third full year in the US market, 
GAN continued to secure billion dollar 
enterprises, re-aligning our global 
support structure to continue to better 
serve our clients, and innovating on 
operator-centric platform design.
GAN’s primary growth market is 
the US. With the largest base of 
casinos, loyalty-engaged patrons, and 
casino game centric audience, GAN 
is well positioned to dominate the 
US B2B space for years to come. 
GAN’s early roots were in the 
development of skill and table games 
which were deployed for the real money 
marketplace. Our evolution into being 
an award winning platform and services 
provider has been an epic journey.

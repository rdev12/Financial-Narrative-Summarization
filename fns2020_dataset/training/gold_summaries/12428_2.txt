POUNDLAND AT A GLANCE
Who we are
Poundland is the largest single price value general merchandise retailer in 
Europe by both sales and by number of stores. Poundland operates a network 
of 528 stores across the UK and Ireland. Stores are sited in convenient 
locations, typically with high footfall, across a mixture of high streets, 
shopping centres and retail parks and are all operated on a leasehold basis.
What we do
Poundland is a price driven, volume-led business offering an extensive range 
of products across 17 categories, with the average Poundland store carrying 
approximately 3,000 core range SKUs including over 1,000 branded products. 
These branded products account for the majority of sales, with popular brand 
names such as Cadbury, Mars, Heinz, Nestle and Colgate representing an 
important footfall driver.
How we do it
Poundland is headquartered in Willenhall, West Midlands, and we employed 
on average 12,829 colleagues in the 2014 financial year, of which 
approximately 70% were employed on a part-time basis. We operate three 
distribution centres. A new warehouse is expected to open in 2014 in Harlow 
in the South East of England to replace the existing temporary facility at 
Hoddesdon.

its first application in Tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis. We 
expect to complete the work necessary to enter into the 
Indian TB regulatory process over the coming months in 
preparation for a market launch in the second half of 2014. 
We are also in discussions with prospective distribution 
partners in relation to tests from our broader infectious 
disease and pharmacogenomic portfolio. 
Our key priority at the current time is to resolve the 
outstanding technical and manufacturing issues we have 
had with Genedrive
®
 and we are confident that these 
issues, which are small in number, are resolvable and 
that we will be in a position to have our TB assay 
independently field tested around the end of 2013.
We believe that the launch of our first Genedrive
®
 product 
in TB coupled with the earlier reported India supply 
and distribution agreement with Xcelris provides very 
attractive growth opportunities and we are continuing to 
progress a range of partner discussions across multiple 
potential applications. 
Financial Results 
Further details of the results for the period are covered in 
the Chief Executive’s review, but financially the year to 
30 June 2013 saw the Company deliver revenues of 
£5.4m (2012: £5.6m). Following high levels of investment 
made in our Personalised Medicine (Genedrive
®
) and 
Novel Therapies programmes, the Company reported 
a loss of £1.2m (2012: £0.2m loss after tax). After the 
successful completion of the £4.2m cash placing in 
December 2012, cash reserves at 30 June 2013 were 
£6.5m (2012: £4.7m). Reported cash reserves at the end 
of June 2013 included the BD upfront technology access 
fee payment of £0.6m, subsequently returned to BD on 
termination of the agreement post the year end. Unaudited 
cash reserves at 30 September 2013 were £5.4m. 
The Company continues to make progress across each 
of its 3 Divisions as outlined below: 
•  Preclinical Research Services revenues remained 
steady over the year at £2.9m (2012: £2.9m). We 
continue to develop our range of high-margin service 
offerings alongside our cornerstone US government 
bio-defence contract. The Division is building and 
extending its core scientific strengths, especially in 
the US, to maintain a solid platform for future growth. 
•  Following last year’s significant step up in growth, 
Personalised Medicine revenues remained broadly 
flat at £2.5m (2012: £2.7m), supported by our ongoing 
pharmaceutical collaborations and an increased 
investment in our Genedrive
®
 developments.  
In the results for the year ended 30 June 2013, we report 
a steady trading position which alongside a strengthened 
and accelerated investment in the advancement of our 
molecular diagnostic technology Genedrive
®
 has resulted 
in widening reported losses. It had been our intention 
to finalise the prelaunch stages of our TB assay on the 
Genedrive
®
 platform during the 2013 financial year and to 
recognise milestone payments, but due to technical and 
manufacturing issues we are disappointed that this was 
not achieved as part of the collaboration with Becton 
Dickinson (BD). Whilst we failed to meet the milestones in 
the timescale agreed with BD, resulting in the termination 
of our supply and distribution agreement, we remain in 
dialogue with the group. We are now finalising the technical 
development and scale up of our Genedrive
®
 platform for 
“I remain wholly convinced that 
through our investors’ funding and 
support we have developed a 
strategically valuable asset of real 
importance to those operating in 
the field of molecular diagnostics.”

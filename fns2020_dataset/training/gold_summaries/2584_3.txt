BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Chairman’ s statement
Our strategy is delivering
Our business is robust
Since our last annual report to shareholders 
we have made good progress towards achieving
our near-term objectives, while positioning 
the business to deliver sustainable growth over 
the long term.
We have almost completed the integration of the Protherics
business, which we acquired in December 2008. The ﬁnancial
beneﬁts of the acquisition are evident in our strong results for
the year.
Revenue of £98.5m (08/09: £84.8m) generated a gross proﬁt
of £65.7m (08/09: £47.7m). The Group made a proﬁt before
tax of £9.1m, which compares with a loss before tax of £11.3m
in the prior year. Cash and equivalents increased to £82.6m
at 31 March 2010 from £78.2m at 31 March 2009.
The ﬁnancial review on pages 18 to 21 describes the results 
for the year in detail and provides a ﬁnancial outlook for the
year ahead.
A key objective for the past year was the establishment 
of a sales and marketing capability in the US, which is core 
to our growth strategy. I am pleased to report that we have
now put in place the key commercial operations required 
to enable us to begin marketing our own products in the US.
From October 2010, when the current distribution agreement
ends, we will start selling our two approved products,
CroFab™, an anti-venom, and DigiFab™, for digoxin toxicity, 
in the US ourselves. These established, potentially life-saving
products have limited competition and are well known by the
specialists who administer them. These attributes make them
ideal ﬁrst products for our new US sales and marketing teams.
To deliver sustainable growth we must add products both
to our development pipeline and to our marketed products
portfolio. To this end, we continue to invest in our pipeline and
to review suitable in-licensing and acquisition opportunities;
for the latter, having a US sales capability increases our
attractiveness as a partner.
We have made the decision to take Varisolve
®
forward
ourselves. Completing the development of Varisolve
®
and
marketing it in the US reimbursed sector is a big investment
for BTG. It is also an investment that has the potential to 
deliver signiﬁcant returns and is, we believe, in the best
interests of shareholders.
In addition to Varisolve
®
, our pipeline comprises another
programme we intend to take to market ourselves, which 
is Voraxaze™, for methotrexate toxicity, and four other
programmes we intend to partner. Further details are
provided in the CEO’s review on pages 10 to 12 and in the
pipeline update on pages 17 and 18.
I wish to thank the executives, management and employees
of BTG for another year of hard work and progress across 
the business. I am grateful to my Board colleagues for their
continued guidance and in particular, to Professor Colin
Blakemore, who will retire from the Board at this year’s Annual
General Meeting in July, for his signiﬁcant contributions to the
company’s development during his three years as a director.
I would also like to thank our shareholders for their continued
support of our strategy and team.
We look forward with excitement and conﬁdence to the 
year ahead, in which we start selling our own products 
in the US and take the next step towards becoming a
sustainably proﬁtable specialty pharmaceuticals business.

t he Group has successfully grown 
its Engineering Services business both 
organically and by acquisition. t his has 
increased both revenue and operating 
profit and strengthened its position as 
a provider of multidisciplinary integrated 
engineering support services to critical 
uK infrastructure. Our Specialist Building 
activities have increased operating 
margin and remain focused on niche 
sustainable markets in the South.
Engineering Services
Operating in the Energy, Environmental 
and Infrastructure markets, Renew 
undertakes essential asset support 
providing maintenance and renewal 
services through its directly employed 
multidisciplinary workforce operating from 
local, independently branded businesses.
Revenue in Engineering Services grew 
by 9%, including organic growth of 6%, 
to £232.4m (2012: £214.1m) and now 
accounts for 70% of Group revenue 
(201 2: 63%) and 84% of Group operating 
profit (2012: 82%). Operating margin 
improved to 4.6% (2012: 4.5%).
t he Engineering Services order book 
has seen strong growth of 28% to £301m 
(2012: £235m), securing 83% of 2014 
budget revenue (2013: 66%). t his growth 
has been achieved in all market sectors 
with Energy up 7% to £133m (201 2: £1 24m), 
Environmental up 79% to £59m (2012: 
£33m) and Infrastructure up 40% to 
£109m (2012: £78m).
t he Group continues to deliver its strategy 
of growing its Engineering Services business 
both organically and through selective 
earnings enhancing acquisitions. In the year 
under review, the Group acquired l ewis Civil 
Engineering l imited based near Cardiff. 
l ewis, which specialises in deep sewer and 
water main pipelines, waste water treatment 
and general water utility infrastructure 
works, further strengthens the Group’s 
position in the Water sector adding 
two leading utility businesses as major 
clients in the Environmental market.
Energy
t he Group operates in the nuclear, 
traditional and renewable power generation 
sectors nationally providing planned and 
reactive maintenance and asset renewal 
support for a range of clients mainly through 
long standing framework agreements.
t he Group focuses its activity in the 
nuclear sector with the majority of work 
continuing to be undertaken across the 
Nuclear Decommissioning Authority’s 
(“NDA”) estate where we are active on 
nine sites that command around 70% 
of the NDA’s £3bn annual expenditure. 
Work is concentrated at the Sellafield site 
on which the Group has been operational 
for over sixty years and where the Group 
provides engineering support for the 
care and maintenance of operational 
plant associated with waste treatment or 
processing, decommissioning, demolition 
and clean-up of redundant facilities. 
Sellafield continues to be allocated 
55% of the NDA’s annual budget.
Our position as the leading provider 
of mechanical and electrical services at 
Sellafield and the integrated service offering 
through our subsidiary businesses helped 
the Group achieve a 16% increase in our 
secured nuclear order book to £126m 
(2012: £109m). During the year, the Group 
became the first contractor to receive supply 
chain accreditation for service provision 
at the Sellafield site in recognition of our 
performance to the highest quality nuclear 
standards. Our continued attention to our 
safety performance was also recognised 
when we received the 2013 Sellafield 
Resident Engineers Safety Award for 
‘Outstanding Safety performance’. 
Work at Sellafield continues to be 
undertaken on the Multi Discipline Site 
Works framework which was renewed 
from 1 April 2013 and is valued at up to 
  E n g i n e e r i n g S e r v i c e s

Summary
B W May Chief Executive
08 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 £280m over a four year period. As one of 
the three participants on the framework, 
we continue to be aligned with the largest 
area of spend, delivering production 
operations support work packages. 
One of the major areas of work at Sellafield 
is in high hazard risk reduction and includes 
the Evaporator D scheme, currently the 
uK’s largest nuclear programme. Revenues 
on this project are now expected to exceed 
£60m over its three year duration with 
completion due in 2015. t he £26m four 
year Decommissioning and Bulk Sludge 
Retrievals framework has also experienced 
a substantial increase in scope during the 
period. Work also continues on the £58m 
four year Site Wide Asset Care framework.
We continue to support Sellafield’s 
major projects programmes and are 
the sole mechanical and electrical 
supply chain partner on the fifteen 
year £1.1bn Infrastructure Strategic 
Alliance framework.
Elsewhere in the Energy market, the 
Group provides long term engineering 
support at five of the uK’s traditional 
power generation sites through seven 
framework agreements. t he ongoing 
maintenance and support of these 
sites is critical in ensuring provision 
of the uK’s future energy needs. 
In renewables, we have increased our service 
offering in the wind energy sector where 
we were commissioned by E.On to carry out 
a range of challenging repair works which 
successfully brought a number of turbines 
back on line on a remote site in Scotland. 
We are also engaged to supply a range of 
highly engineered components to one of 
the uK’s largest offshore windfarms for 
the same client. Hydro generation schemes 
are also providing a number of opportunities 
with projects for Scottish and Welsh Water 
on track to commence in 2014 through 
our frameworks with these clients.
The Group’s priority remains the safety of 
our employees and those working with us. 
Our commitment to this can be seen in the 
significant 92% reduction in our Accident 
Incidence Rate over the last 8 years. 
Engineering Services performance
The development of our Engineering Services business has created a platform 
of sustainable revenue generated from over 60 framework agreements with 
major clients, most of which operate in regulated markets.

09 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Chief Executive’s review continued
New Nuclear Power
HM Government’s ‘Strike price’ agreement 
with EDF Energy announced in October 2013 
represents a crucial milestone in the role of 
new nuclear as part of the uK’s future energy 
strategy. t he final investment decision for 
the proposed new station at Hinkley point 
is anticipated by the summer of 2014. t he 
forecast costs of Hinkley point ‘C’ are circa 
£16bn which is to be spent over a ten year 
construction period. t his initial project 
as well as the anticipated increased 
momentum at other proposed new uK 
sites, which also have consents to develop, 
will present opportunities for Renew. An 
established and proven track record of 
service delivery to the highest standards 
within this highly regulated sector will be 
a prerequisite to participation. t he Group 
has demonstrated its attainment of the 
necessary standards over many years 
and continues to be involved in supporting 
proposals for elements of the requirements 
at Hinkley point, including the manufacture 
and supply of high integrity fabricated 
steel components which will be required 
early in the construction phase.
Environmental
t he Group continues to provide operational 
support and maintenance to the water 
infrastructure, flood alleviation, river and 
coastal defence, land remediation and 
engineering renovation sectors where 
much of the work is undertaken through 
long term framework agreements with 
repeat clients.
Our progress in the Water sector has been 
enhanced by the acquisition of l ewis Civil 
Engineering l imited (“l ewis”). Our work for 
Northumbrian Water, Wessex Water and 
Welsh Water includes sewer maintenance, 
clean and waste water rehabilitation, 
strategic mains maintenance and general 
utility infrastructure services under 
the regulated AMp5 programme.
For Northumbrian Water, Seymour has 
been appointed a preferred supplier to 
deliver a number of accelerated flood 
prevention schemes in addition to having 
been awarded their third out of four trunk 
Mains Cleaning projects and continuing 
to provide maintenance support under 
seven frameworks. 
For Wessex Water, l ewis is sole supplier on 
the Networks 1 framework under their AMp5 
investment programme. For Welsh Water, 
l ewis has positions on the pressurised 
pipelines and Major Civil Engineering 
projects frameworks. l ewis also adds 
a particular specialism to the Group with 
their expertise in trenchless technology. 
In l and Remediation, work continues 
for long standing client National Grid 
under a number of established national 
remediation framework agreements. t he 
National Contaminated l and Remediation 
Contractor’s framework delivered the 
award of a major remediation scheme for 
Blackpool Council. Recent project awards 
for Scotia Gas Networks have led to a 
five year framework appointment. 
During the year, the Group has been 
appointed to the Environment Agency’s 
minor works frameworks across all of its 
regions. t he Group is the only contractor 
to have achieved this nationwide position.
In the Engineering Renovation sector, the 
Group has recently commenced work on a 
£9m project at the palace of Westminster. 
t his contract is associated with the repair 
and restoration of the cast iron roofs at 
this World Heritage Site where the Group 
has previously completed work on a similar 
project on the Speaker’s Court section of 
the roof. t his award provides continuity with 
a long established client in a market sector 
where the Group has renowned expertise 
and a proven delivery record. previously, the 
The Group’s strong results 
are a testament to the 
skills and commitment 
of all our employees. 
The Board would like to 
express its gratitude for 
this ongoing effort which 
is vital to the continued 
success of the Group.

Infrastructure
t he Group operates mainly in the Rail 
sector delivering off-track asset renewal 
and refurbishment as well as a wide range 
of planned and reactive maintenance 
services critical to keeping the rail 
network operational.
For our largest client, Network Rail, 
we remain the sole provider of engineering 
maintenance services nationally which we 
deliver under both the Building and Civils 
Delivery partnership (“BCDp”) and Asset 
Management (“AM”) frameworks. In addition 
to ongoing engineering support our local 
delivery teams respond nationally across 
the rail network providing 24 hour 
emergency services. 
We have seen a substantial increase 
in activity during the year across our 
entire work portfolio. t his increase is 
attributable to the responsiveness of 
our local teams which are aligned closely 
with the operational structure of Network 
Rail. During the year, we have carried out 
approximately 4,000 separate instructions 
in AM and been awarded almost 100 
projects in BCDp.
t he Group’s specialist skills in tunnel 
and shaft refurbishment provide a 
differentiator in this market and were 
further enhanced in the year with the 
formation of our National tunnel Delivery 
team. We have recently been awarded 
the £12m Holme tunnel project which 
has now started on site, together with 
further works to reline the crown of 
Whiteball tunnel.
Our increased activity in Rail is reflected 
in a 36% uplift in our forward order book to 
£101m (201 2: £7 4m). t he recently announced 
funding plan for Network Rail over the next 
five years provides excellent visibility of 
future work opportunities in the Rail sector.
Specialist Building
Specialist Building activity remains 
focused on the High Quality Residential 
and New Build Affordable Housing markets 
in the South. Specialist Building showed 
an increased operating margin of 2.0% 
(2012: 1.7%) through maintaining an 
operating profit of £2.1m (2012: £2.1m) 
on revenue of £102.5m (2012: £123.1m). 
Our Specialist Building order book has 
grown by 20% to £115m (2012: £96m) 
and although we anticipate delivering 
growth in revenue during 2013/14, our 
focus in this segment will remain on 
delivering a consistent level of operating 
profit. t he Group has specific expertise 
in these niche markets as well as many 
years’ experience which combined with our 
strong relationships provides a sustainable 
environment for future opportunities. 
In the High Quality Residential market in 
l ondon and the Home Counties we remain 
a leading quality provider. Our extensive 
experience and expertise in innovative 
temporary works engineering solutions 
when carrying out complex structural 
remodelling and extending properties 
below ground provides a key differentiator. 
Over £60m of new opportunities have been 
secured in this strong market which has 
good visibility of future opportunities and 
the business has all of its budget revenue 
for 2013/14 already contracted. 
t he demand for New Build Affordable 
Housing remains high and the Group has 
established relationships with many of 
the leading Housing Associations in the 
South providing access to an advertised 
spend of £700m per annum for the next 
three years. Over £50m of awards have 
been contracted during the year including 
further projects for peabody, One Housing 
Group and Notting Hill Housing securing 76% 
of the business’ 2013/14 budget revenue.
People
t he Group’s priority remains the safety of 
our employees and those working with us. 
Our commitment to this can be seen in the 
significant 92% reduction in our Accident 
Incidence Rate over the last eight years. 
t he Group has a number of safety related 
initiatives in place and is particularly 
focused on ensuring that all incidents, 
not only those which result in reportable 
accidents, are recorded and analysed to 
ensure all possible lessons are learned.
t he Group’s strong results are a testament 
to the skills and commitment of all our 
employees. t he Board would like to express 
its gratitude for this ongoing effort which is 
vital to the continued success of the Group.

Chairman’s Statement
“We have continued
to gain market
share reﬂecting the
compelling nature of
the YouGov offering.”
The 12 months to 31 July 2009
(YouGov’s ﬁnancial year) has clearly
been a very challenging period both
for the economy as a whole and
speciﬁcally for the market research
industry which has experienced
revenue declines to a greater
degree than in previous recessions.
Against this difﬁcult background,
our business succeeded in growing
reported revenue by 10% to £44m
in this last ﬁnancial year although this
represented a fall of 3% in constant
currency terms. This performance,
when compared to the sector’s larger
research groups who reported revenue
declines in 2009, suggests that we
have continued to gain market share
reﬂecting the compelling nature of
the YouGov offering.
Our normalised operating proﬁt was
£3.1m compared to £8.7m in the prior
year . Although this performance was in
line with the expectations set at the time
of the interim results, it is nonetheless
disappointing to report a fall in proﬁt
after eight years continued revenue
and proﬁt growth. The primary reason
for this was the expansion of our
headcount during 2007/08 in
anticipation of higher revenue growth
which did not materialise due to the
subsequent economic slowdown.
In simple terms we let our cost base
get ahead of our income.
As announced in April, we have been
implementing measures to improve
proﬁtability by scaling back investment
in non-core activities and reducing
costs in areas which were not
delivering expected revenue growth.
We expect annual savings of £2.5m
from these actions.
The Group’s balance sheet remains
strong and at the year-end our net cash
balances were £12.5m, compared to
£12.3m at 31July 2008. This will allow
us to support ongoing investment in
new market research products.
The Board remains committed to
growing YouGov’s market share and
focused on investment for future growth.
It therefore does not recommend the
payment of a dividend.
YouGov is a relatively young company
which has been a pioneer in the ﬁeld
of online market research. We have
grown very rapidly and the shock of
the credit crunch and recession has
caused us to pause and take stock.
Over the past year we have had three
main goals:
 to improve ﬁnancial controls
and forecasting;
 to focus on speciﬁc geographies
and market sectors; and
 to invest in improved technology,
panel engagement and
management.
In pursuit of these objectives we have
made a number of senior management
appointments and investments which
are detailed in the Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer’s Report on pages 6 and 7.
In the UK, YouGov has a very strong
brand which is widely recognised for
successful, accurate political opinion
polling and this has opened the doors
for our much larger commercial market
research activity . We are investing to
build similar levels of brand recognition
in our other markets with a view to
repeating the successful UK model
on an international basis.

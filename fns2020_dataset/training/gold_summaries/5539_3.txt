2 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2008
Chairman’s Statement
In the year to 30 September 2008, EBITDA before exceptional items fell by 3.0% to £512 million and profit
before tax and exceptional items fell by 12.6% to £263 million. However, adjusted earnings per share were 39.2
pence, a decrease of only 1% over the prior year due to a reduction in the weighted average number of shares
in issue.
Trading throughout the year has been difficult and became progressively more challenging during the second
half when we would normally have seen an increase in profits compared to the first six months. This year
however, pro forma EBITDA was the same in both half-year periods as consumers responded to the economic
pressures by reducing their expenditure on discretionary items.
At the interim stage we increased the dividend by 12% to 5.8 pence per share and the Board is now
recommending an unchanged final dividend of 10.4 pence per share, giving a total for the year of 16.2 pence
per share, an increase of 3.8% over the prior year. Dividend cover based on adjusted earnings is 2.4 times and
the final dividend of 10.4 pence will be payable on 26 January 2009 to shareholders on the register on
5 January 2009.
During the year, we have witnessed increasingly difficult economic conditions and turbulent financial markets,
which have prompted a comprehensive review of our business plans and financial structure. Our operational
focus, as always, is to optimise trading profit and during the period we remain in recession we will invest both
in our pubs and in support of our licensees whilst disposing of those outlets which no longer have a viable
economic future as a pub. Financially, we enjoy strong cash flows and secure long-term debt with no refinancing
requirement until 2011, in preparation for which we will take opportunities to reduce debt levels.
In July 2008, we announced the appointment of David Maloney as an independent non-executive director of
the Company. His expertise, knowledge and experience gained from senior roles in UK and international based
service industries will further strengthen the Board and be of great benefit to the Company. It is intended that at
the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in January 2009 David Maloney will succeed David Harding as
Chairman of the Audit Committee and Susan Murray will succeed Jo Stewart as Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee. Both David Harding and Jo Stewart will continue as members of the Board and Jo Stewart will
remain as Senior Independent Director.
Given the current economic climate we are likely to see some further decline in trading profit until economic
conditions and consumer confidence improve. Nevertheless, the quality of our pub estate in which we are
continuing to invest alongside our licensees will ensure that we meet the challenges of reduced and changing
consumer demand from a strong platform and be well positioned to benefit from economic recovery when this
occurs.

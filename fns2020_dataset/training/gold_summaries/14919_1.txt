 SThree plc 6
Overview
2010 saw a substantially improved 
market when compared to 
the exceptionally challenging 
environment of 2009. That said, it 
would be misleading to suggest that 
the overall level of demand for our 
services during 2010 was universally 
consistent with a fully recovered 
marketplace. Whilst some parts of our 
business equalled or surpassed pre-
downturn levels of performance and 
all our markets were in growth by the 
last quarter, most were yet to return to 
the very buoyant conditions that we 
would associate with “normality” in 
the specialist staffing market.
Given this specific context it is 
pleasing to report a strong 2010 
performance. The Group delivered a 
substantial improvement in overall 
profitability and a further increase in 
our cash balances whilst at the same 
time continuing to invest in the future 
of the business.
In addition to increasing sales 
headcount substantially, we also 
opened a further six offices, bringing 
the overall total to 52, of which 30 
are outside the UK. Given this strong 
trading platform coupled with steadily 
improving market conditions, we 
believe we are in an excellent position 
to make 2011 another year of progress. 
On this basis the Group intends to 
further grow sales headcount and 
continue the international office roll 
out throughout 2011.
Financial Outcome
During the year the Group saw a 
modest reduction in Gross Profit (GP) 
with the 2010 figure of £166.4m down 
2.8% (2009: £171.2m), largely due to 
the relative weakness of the contract 
marketplace during most of the year. 
However, this converted to a Profit 
Before T ax (PBT) of £21.6m, up some 
20% before prior year exceptional 
items (2009: £18.0m), reflecting a 
continued tight control of costs.
Notwithstanding the fact that 2010 
was a year of investment, the Group 
had another strong performance 
in terms of cash generation. At the 
end of 2010 net cash (including term 
investments) had increased to £55.2m 
(2009: £48.5m).
The strong cash performance, 
combined with steadily improving 
market conditions, support the 
Board’s decision to maintain the total 
2010 dividend at 12.0p (2009: 12.0p) 
which is comfortably underpinned by 
the cash available to the Group.
Geographical Expansion
The Group continued its well 
established strategy of geographical 
expansion opening six international 
offices in the year. In addition 
to further offices in Munich and 
Düsseldorf, we rolled out offices 
in Perth, Delhi, Houston and San 
Francisco, bringing the overall total  
to 52 offices in 12 countries.
In aggregate, Group GP generated 
from outside of the UK was £99.5m 
(2009: £94.2m), up 5.6%. Given the 
more mature nature of the UK staffing 
market and in particular the continued 
relatively subdued demand for 
contract staff, UK GP of £66.8m  
was down 13.1% on the prior year 
(2009: £76.9m).
As a consequence of this difference 
in relative performance, the overall 
non UK/UK business mix underwent 
a marked change. For 2010 the ratio 
was 60:40 in favour of non UK GP 
compared with 55:45 in 2009. It is 
likely that this shift will represent an 
ongoing trend as the Group becomes 
ever more international. However, 
the fact remains that the UK has 
consistently demonstrated very 
robust growth in more typical market 
conditions and we are confident that 
the UK will show a significant bounce 
back as confidence levels build.
There is now ample evidence to 
indicate a rapidly growing opportunity 
to take the proven SThree model into 
an ever wider range of international 
markets, most of which are 
substantially less mature than the 
UK. In the first half of 2011 we expect 
to open offices in Doha, Sao Paulo, 
Abu Dhabi and Antwerp and it is likely 
that the total number of new offices 
opened during 2011 will be similar to 
the six that came on stream each  
year during 2010 and 2009. That 
being said, during 2011 we expect the 
large majority of our new hires to  
be into established SThree locations, 
thereby de-risking the expansion 
programme.
Sector Diversification
In parallel with its greater 
geographical diversity, in recent 
years the Group has made significant 
progress in developing markets 
outside of its historic ICT franchise. 
The ICT market has attractive 
characteristics, not least of all in 
terms of highly paid candidates 
and a structural skills shortage 
in most technical areas, albeit in 
some territories the ICT market is 
particularly competitive.
Over a period of years the Group 
has demonstrated its expertise in 
moving into adjacent specialist 
staffing sectors, many of which are 
both substantially less competitive 
than the ICT market and are also 
characterised by candidates who can 
command rates which are at least 
equal to and in many cases above 
those achieved in ICT.
Chief Executive Officer’s Review 
for the year ended 28 November 2010 SThree plc 7
The result of this sectoral 
diversification is that non ICT 
franchises accounted for 38.3% of 
total GP . This figure of £63.8m was 
up 31.5% on the previous year (2009: 
£48.5m). The major non ICT segments 
for the Group are Banking, Engineering 
& Energy, Accountancy & Finance 
and Pharmaceuticals; the Group also 
has (a relatively modest) presence in 
each of HR and Sales & Marketing.
The ICT franchise performed 
somewhat less robustly than the 
other sectors with 2010 GP of 
£102.6m (2009: £122.6m), down 
16.3% on the prior year. The Group’s 
ICT performance was impacted by 
a number of factors: the relatively 
subdued contract market which is 
disproportionately ICT based; the 
decline in public sector hiring – 
another ICT biased market; and the 
weakness of the Benelux territories, 
our largest ICT franchise outside  
the UK.
It is worth noting that the GP 
breakdowns given above are 
measured by the skill set of the 
candidate rather than the nature of 
the business of the client company. 
By the latter metric, rather than a 
62% exposure to the ICT market, the 
Group has in fact only a 19% exposure 
(2009: 21%) to ICT customers per se 
and hence benefits from a broad client 
base in terms of industry sectors.
“High Margin High Value”
The Group has a stated strategy 
which is focused on the quality of the 
business transacted. We do not buy 
market share or swap value for volume 
as we believe both to be inappropriate 
given the highly fragmented nature 
of the specialist staffing market. We 
are highly selective in terms of the 
type of clients with which we engage 
and avoid the lower margin business 
which is often a condition of dealing 
with many larger employers in more 
mature markets.
In addition, we look to go “up the 
food chain” and place more highly 
remunerated candidates, either 
as a result of increasing the level 
of seniority of the placements we 
make, or by identifying more highly 
paid niche markets. The benefits 
of this approach can be seen in the 
robustness of our fees and contract 
rates, even in a market which 
remained somewhat more price 
sensitive than normal and which  
was not characterised by the level 
of wage inflation typical of a more 
normal market.
The Group’s overall contract margin 
remained broadly flat at 21.6% 
(2009: 22.1%) despite a substantial 
reduction in the number of public 
sector contractors, which were 
typically higher than the average 
margin. Moreover, in absolute terms 
the average gross profit per day rate 
(GPDR) improved somewhat, up 
1.1 % to £85.65 (2009: £84.69) on a 
constant currency basis. Pro rated to 
an annual permanent salary the GPDR 
is the equivalent of £90k (2009: £88k).
A similar but more pronounced 
value theme was seen in the Group’s 
permanent business. The average 
fee recorded in 2010 was £12,340 
(2009: £11,930) up 3.4% on a constant 
currency basis.
Contract/Permanent  
Business Mix
Unlike the early recovery phase of 
previous upturns, the contract market 
did not outperform the permanent 
market in 2010. On the contrary (and 
in common with the peer group), 
our permanent performance was 
markedly ahead of contract. During 
the year the Group made a total of 
6,551 permanent placements (2009: 
6,060) an increase of 8.1%. The 
number of contract runners at the 
end of 2010 had improved to 4,359 
(2009: 4,157) representing an increase 
of 4.9%.
The relative weakness of the contract 
market was exacerbated by the fact 
that the market in Benelux was weak 
through most of the year and after 
the UK this territory is the Group’s 
largest in terms of contract exposure. 
On a similar note GP derived from the 
Public Sector declined by around 50% 
during the year and this is largely a 
contract market. By contrast, some 
of the strongest performing markets 
(e.g. the Far East, Banking, Oil & Gas 
etc.) are for us, disproportionately 
permanent franchises.
The net effect of the above was that 
permanent GP represented 49% of 
the Group’s total in 2010 compared 
with 42% of GP for 2009. Going 
forward into 2011 and beyond, we 
would expect a further increase in 
terms of the permanent share of 
GP as the economic cycle enters a 
more positive phase and the Group 
Chief Executive Officer’s Review 
for the year ended 28 November 2010   (continued) SThree plc 8
becomes increasingly exposed to 
territories and markets in which the 
prime opportunity is in permanent 
recruitment.
Headcount
The improved market conditions 
allowed us to continue with the 
sales headcount growth plan that we 
initiated in the second half of 2009. 
As a result the Group ended 2010 with 
a total of 1,863 staff (2009: 1,597) an 
increase of 16.7% on the prior year. 
The sales headcount growth was 
primarily focused on Rest of World,  
up 76%, and Europe, up 11%, with the 
UK up 6%.
Our 2010 closing headcount of 1,863 
is still 18% below our previous peak of 
2,274 heads in November 2008 and 
given our expansion plans for the year 
ahead it is likely that this historic peak 
will be surpassed during 2011.
Outlook
Ultimately, the global economic 
backdrop will to some extent influence 
the scale of our market opportunity in 
the coming year. However, it is worth 
remembering that the history of the 
Group specifically, and the specialist 
staffing market more generally, 
demonstrates that we do not need 
exceptionally strong economic 
tailwinds as a precondition for strong 
performance. Indeed, it is candidate 
confidence as much as any other 
major factor which drives demand and 
our experience shows that a healthy 
level of candidate confidence is  
not predicated on above-trend 
economic growth.
In addition, we are more exposed than 
ever before to markets with strong 
structural growth characteristics. 
Recent experience in territories 
such as Germany suggest that the 
underlying growth of the specialist 
staffing market can act as a powerful 
counter-balance even when economic 
conditions are dire. Given that the 
balance of opinion suggests at least 
a benign global economic scenario 
for 2011, markets such as these have 
particularly strong potential. At the 
same time our longer established 
franchises had all returned to growth 
by the end of 2010 and we have no 
reason to believe that this is a trend 
which will not continue.
T aking all the available indicators 
into consideration, we feel there are 
justifiable reasons to remain opti-
mistic about the forthcoming year. 
As always, we take confidence that 
our twenty five year track record, 
seasoned management team and well 
established brands to provide us with 
an excellent platform to make the 
most of whatever the market has to 
offer us.

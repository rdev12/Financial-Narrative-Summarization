 Chairman's Statement
D J Callear Chairman
I am pleased to report Group results in line with market
expectations.  
Underlying pre-tax profit improved, despite ongoing product cost
inflation and some softening of sales, particularly in the private
sector. We achieved this result by increasing our market share
through new business wins, retaining all significant contract
customers, effectively managing product cost increases and
accelerating efficiency improvements across the enlarged group.

The external sales environment
remained tough throughout 2009.
Management focus was directed
both to maximise our sales
performance in this environment
and, internally , to improve business
operations further. Planned
efficiency and centralisation
improvements were accelerated
and we believe that all key aspects
of the business are now operating
more efficiently than ever before. 
Results
Group revenue in 2009 increased to
£187.5m (2008: £181.0m).  Underlying
profit before tax rose by 8.8% to £13.1m
(2008: £12.1m), before exceptional and
non-recurring costs of £3.6m (2008:
£1.8m), share option charges of £0.4m
(2008: £nil) and amortisation of
intangibles of £1.0m (2008: £0.6m).
Profit before tax, after all such charges,
was £8.1m (2008: £9.6m) and profit after
tax was £6.3m (2008: £6.6m).  Basic
earnings per share were 17.2p (2008:
18.5p), the reduction being caused by
non-recurring costs. Underlying earnings
per share were 27.1p (2008: 24.1p).
Cash and net debt
Cash generated from operations
increased to £11.7m (2008: £5.6m).  Net
debt , after payment of the 2008 final
dividend of £2.7m (2008: £2.4m), the
2009 interim dividend of £1.3m (2008:
£1.3m), income tax of £2.8m (2008:
£2.0m) and capital expenditure of £2.1m
(2008: £0.3m), was reduced to £27.8m
at 31 December 2009 (2008: £29.7m). 
Our borrowing facilities remain
unchanged at £45.0m.  The facilities,
which are committed until April 2013,
comprise a term loan of £25.0m and an
invoice discounting arrangement of up
to £20.0m on which we are charged
interest at 1.1% over LIBOR and 0.9%
over bank base rate, respectively.
The first repayment of £2.5m on the
term loan is due in April 2010 and will
be repaid out of operating cashflows.
The second repayment is due in April
2011.  Financial covenants are applied
to the committed facilities and the
Group has continued to comply with
these with significant headroom. 
Dividends
The Board recommends a final
dividend of 7.8p per share (2008:
7.5p), which, if approved at the annual
general meeting (AGM), will be paid on
21 May 2010 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 23
April 2010.  Combined with the interim
dividend paid in November 2009, this
makes a total dividend per share of
11.4p (2008: 11.0p) and amounts to a
distribution of £4.1m (2008: £4.0m).
The total dividend, paid and payable
for the year, is covered by earnings 1.5
times (2008: 1.7 times).
Review of operations 
Markets remained challenging during
2009 with continued product cost
inflation combining with both volume
and sales price pressures. Despite this,
both Group sales and underlying profit
grew in the period, reflecting the mix of
new sales wins, contract retentions and
improved efficiencies across the Group.
In addition to our sales focus, we
concentrated our efforts on streamlining
the Group’s operations to reflect the
underlying market conditions and on
integrating all business areas with
central operations and back office
support functions.
A full review of Group operations is
included in the Chief Executive’s Review.
Employees
This was a challenging year and our
employees have had to work hard to
deliver the results outlined above.  They
continue to show commitment to the
Group, despite the necessary pay freeze
implemented in 2009 and I would like to
thank them.
Acquisitions 
On 18 February 2010, we announced
the acquisition of the trade and certain
assets relating to the business process
outsourcing (BPO) division of The Print
Factory London (1991) Limited (in
administration) and The DSR Group
Limited (in administration). These
assets include two leasehold
properties, certain employees of the
BPO business and a wide range of
customer relationships and contracts
recently generating approximately
£20m annualised turnover. This
business will be amalgamated with our
own BPO activity which operates as
AccessPlus. Further details are
provided on page 8 in the Chief
Executive’s Review.
On 1 February 2010, we acquired the
trade and assets of the Newbury branch
of office supplies dealer, Martin Luck
Limited. This business has been
integrated with the Group’s mid market
managed procurement activity.
We shall continue to seek further earnings
enhancing acquisition opportunities. 
Outlook
Trading for the first quarter of 2010 is
in line with management expectations,
having recovered from the adverse
weather conditions at the beginning of
the year.
The Group now has the right infrastructure
and distribution footprint relative to its
size and we are in better operational shape
than we have been previously .  Our aim in
2010 is to capitalise on this efficient
operating structure and focus on growth.
We will strive competitively to deliver the
best available products and services in our
sector as we further develop our emphasis
on the business services portfolio.
The general economic outlook for 2010
remains uncertain. In particular, it
appears inevitable that efficiencies and
cuts in public sector spending will be
made.  This, however, represents as
much an opportunity to the Group as a
threat. We are offering an expanding
range of government compliant office
products and services to both existing
and new customer departments and our
contract model and environmental focus
position us well to benefit from our
inclusion as a supplier on the new Pan-
Government Collaborative Framework.
AGM
The AGM will be held at the Company’s
head office, St Crispins, Duke Street,
Norwich on 18 May 2010 at 11.00 a.m.
Notice of the AGM together with the
proxy forms for use at the AGM, will be
circulated with the financial statements.

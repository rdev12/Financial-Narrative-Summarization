Overview
Centamin is a mineral exploration, development and mining company that has been active in Egypt since 1995. 
The Company’s principal asset is the Sukari Gold Mine, which is located in the Eastern Desert approximately 900km from 
Cairo and 25km from the Red Sea. First gold was poured at Sukari on 26 June 2009, and was followed by four successive 
years of growth, from approximately 150,000 ounces in 2010 to c.357,000oz in 2013. The doubling of plant throughput 
to a nameplate rate of 10 million tonnes per annum (“Mtpa”) will see another significant step‑up in 2014 as Sukari heads 
towards the long‑term target production rate of 450‑500,000 ounces per annum from 2015. Exploration at Sukari Hill and 
over the rest of the Sukari concession area is continuing, with further significant resource and reserve growth expected, 
particularly from the high grade underground mine areas.
Centamin’s management team and Board of Directors have considerable expertise in the gold mining industry. This ranges 
from the early stage identification of deposits, project financing, construction and development, to the operating of large 
mines. Some of the leadership team has been based at Sukari for almost a decade, taking it from an early stage exploration 
project to the operating gold mine it is today.
Centamin’s operating experience gives it a significant advantage in acquiring and developing other gold projects.  
In 2013 Centamin agreed a recommended takeover offer for ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Ltd and formed a joint venture 
with AIM‑listed Alecto Minerals plc, adding highly prospective licence packages in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia respectively. 
Accounting for Sukari Gold Mines
The operating company of Sukari, Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”), is jointly owned by Pharaoh Gold Mines NL (“PGM”) 
and the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority (“EMRA”) on a 50% equal basis. For accounting purposes, SGM is 100% 
proportional consolidated within the Centamin group of companies reflecting the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession. Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, the provisions of which are described more fully below, PGM solely 
funds SGM’s activities. PGM is also entitled to recover the following costs and expenses payable from sales revenue 
(excluding the royalty payable to the Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) (i) all current operating expenses incurred and 
paid after the initial commercial production; (ii) exploration costs, including those accumulated to the commencement 
of commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum); and (iii) exploitation capital 
costs, including those accumulated prior to the commencement of commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of 
total accumulated cost per annum). Legal title of all operating assets of PGM will pass to EMRA when cost recovery is 
completed. The right of use of all fixed and movable assets remains with PGM and SGM.
Since the commencement of commercial production on 1 April 2010, the cash flows generated by SGM through the sale of 
gold are used to fund the ongoing operating expenses incurred in its own right and to fund the cost recovery due to PGM 
for exploration and exploitation capital costs at a rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum. 
In return, ongoing capital expenditure incurred in connection with the Sukari mine is funded solely by PGM out of cash flows 
received from SGM through the cost recovery process as described above. The expenditure incurred by PGM in relation to 
Stage 4 will become recoverable once the infrastructure has been commissioned, which is currently planned at the end of 
2013, at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum. Legal title of all operating assets of PGM will pass to EMRA 
when cost recovery is completed. The right of use of all fixed and movable assets remains with PGM and SGM.
EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM’s net production surplus “profit share” (defined as revenue less payment of the 3% 
production royalty to ARE and recoverable costs). Based on the Company’s calculation there was no Net Profit Share due to 
EMRA as at 30 June 2013, nor is any likely to be due as at 30 June 2014. It is expected that there will be a net production 
surplus (revenue in excess of production royalty and cost recoveries) available for sharing between EMRA and PGM for 
the SGM financial year ending 30 June 2015 (SGM’s accounting period is 1 July to 30 June) based on current gold prices, 
production forecasts and operating expenses. Any disruption to operations or reduction in gold price realised will delay this 
profit sharing. This expected profit sharing takes into account the costs incurred on paying for fuel at international prices.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Any recovery of these prepayments, discussed in Note 20 to the financial statements, will result in further amounts to be 
shared between EMRA and PGM. Any payment made to EMRA pursuant to these provisions of the Concession Agreement 
will be recognised as a variable charge to the income statement of Centamin, which will lead to a reduction in the earnings 
per share. Separate accounts are prepared in respect of SGM. These are independently audited and certified by Egyptian 
certified accountants approved by EMRA. Any expected profit share payable to EMRA and PGM becomes payable on 
completion of the audit of the SGM accounts. Centamin will be working together with EMRA to ensure that these can be 
approved as soon as possible so that the profit share can be paid to EMRA and PGM. Centamin is looking forward to paying 
the first profit share to EMRA. With a view to demonstrating goodwill toward the Egyptian government, PGM has made 
advance payments to EMRA which will be netted off against any future profit share that becomes payable to EMRA.
Highlights for the year
 (1) (2) (3)
Centamin delivered strong operational and financial results in 2013, producing 356,943 ounces of gold (2012: 262,828 
ounces) and generating profit after tax for the year of US$184.0 million (2012: US$199.0 million). Centamin has continued 
to return strong earnings and cash flow generation despite the weaker gold price environment, owing to the Group’s 
emphasis on maximising productivity and maintaining rigorous cost control. Now in its fifth year of production, the Sukari 
Gold Mine remains highly cash generative, with EBITDA of US$234.2 million (2012: US$233.3 million). Centamin has a 
robust cash and cash equivalents balance of US$106.0 million (2012: US$147.1 million) as at 31 December 2013.
2013 saw the Sukari operation performing well across all areas. Most notably, the processing plant operated consistently 
at c.15% above nameplate capacity and the output from the underground mine continued to rise quarter‑on‑quarter to end 
the year at levels significantly above original expectations. The completion of construction of the Stage 4 plant expansion, 
which is currently under commissioning, sets the stage for the next step‑up in production towards Sukari’s long‑term target 
of 450‑500,000 ounces per annum from 2015 onwards. 
An updated resource and reserve statement for Sukari was announced on 18 December 2013, with the total Measured 
and Indicated resource containing 13.4 million ounces (“Moz”) and the total reserve containing 8.2Moz. The underground 
reserve of 2.30 million tonnes (“Mt”) represented a 120% increase on the December 2011 reserve, despite mining 
depletion. We remain confident of further significant reserve expansion, with the 0.52Mt Proven component of 
this reserve showing a grade of 11.4g/t gold, and continued positive results from ongoing drilling into the target 
high‑grade extensions.
The Company progressed its medium and long‑term growth strategy during 2013. In September, Centamin entered into a 
joint venture with AIM‑listed Alecto Minerals plc over their exploration projects in Ethiopia, thus expanding the Company’s 
presence in this important region of focus. A recommended all‑share takeover offer for ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Ltd, 
valued at A$40.9 million, was announced on 10 December 2013. This takeover provides Centamin with an extensive 
licence holding over a highly prospective and underexplored 100km+ trend of gold mineralisation in Burkina Faso. 
Centamin will implement a systematic exploration programme, aimed at developing the potential for further substantial 
growth of the existing resource base comprising 1.92Moz Indicated and 1.33Moz Inferred.
Centamin remains in a robust position to continue delivering on its track record of production growth and solid cash flow 
generation during 2014 and beyond, as shown by the following:
•	 basic earnings per share 16.87 cents, down 8% on prior year;
•	 record EBITDA US$234.2 million, up 1% on the prior year;
•	 full year production was 356,943, a 36% increase on 2012 and above guidance of 320,000 ounces;
•	 cash costs of production of US$663 per ounce;
•	 Stage 4 plant expansion (to nameplate capacity of 10Mtpa) expenditure at the year end was US$327.8 million of the 
reforecast cost of US$331.2 million, including contingency;
•	 Centamin remains debt‑free and unhedged with cash, bullion on hand, gold sales receivable and available‑for‑sale 
financial assets of US$142.5 million as at 31 December 2013; and
•	 the Supreme Administrative Court appeal and Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) Court Case are both ongoing. Both of these 
cases are described in detail elsewhere in this MD&A (refer to the section headed “Egyptian Court Litigation” below). 
Operations continue as normal and any enforcement of the Administrative Court decision has been suspended pending 
the appeal ruling. We remain confident that a satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved in both cases.
With respect to the DFO case, management recognises the practical difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from 
the government and, for this reason, has fully provided against the cumulative prepayment of US$97.0 million as an 
exceptional item (refer to Note 6 to the financial statements). In the meantime the Group is continuing to pay international 
prices for DFO. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Centamin produced 356,943 ounces of gold in 2013, which is a 36% increase on 262,828 ounces in 2012. The higher 
year‑on‑year production was a result of: (a) a 26% increase in tonnes milled (to 5.7Mt) due to the improved plant 
productivity and availability, (b) an 50% increase in production from the underground due to improved underground mining 
contractor equipment availability, and (c) a 4% higher feed grade to the mills (2.12g/t in 2013 compared to 2.04g/t in 2012) 
as underground productivity and head grades increased.
Open pit
The open pit delivered total material movement of 41,718kt for the year, an increase of 66% on the prior year. The increase 
in total material movement was related to increase in the mining fleet capacity during the year. Additional mining 
equipment will continue to be delivered during the first half of 2014.
As part of the implementation of Stage 4, the Company is in discussions with EMRA and other government departments in 
relation to increasing the daily usage of ammonium nitrate (“AN”) in order to increase open pit mining rates to the required 
level to feed the expanded plant. The increase in the daily issue of AN is still outstanding and this has had an impact on 
the movement of waste material compared to the current mining plan. However from recent meetings with the relevant 
authorities, management believe government approval is now in its final stages. 
Ore production from the open pit was 11.7Mt at 0.81g/t with an average head grade fed to the plant of 1.25g/t. The ROM 
ore stockpile balance increased by 1kt to 1.8kt by the end of the year. Mining was primarily from the Stage 3 area, in the 
Stage 2 area mining continued to the 950RL and development work progressed in the Gazelle and Eastern Hills area to 
the 1100RL. 
Underground mine
Ore production from the underground mine was 587kt. The ratio of ore from stoping versus development remained 
consistent year on year, with 52% of development ore (304kt) and 48% of stoping ore (283kt). Ore production from stoping 
and development was in line with forecasts. Development and stoping requirements were increased in the second half 
of 2013. 
A total of 11,620 metres of diamond drilling was completed for both short‑term stope definition and underground resource 
development. During the year 3,786m of development were driven through ore. The project development total to date is 
15,766m, of which 9,200m were through ore.
As part of the development of the Ptah area, the first crosscut to access the 845, 860, 875 and 890 levels has been 
completed. Three exploration drill cubbies have been established where drilling is actively taking place Ore drives have 
been developed on the Ptah 875 level and the exhaust system was extended to the 875 level crosscut. 
Processing
The annual throughput in the Sukari plant was 5.7Mt in 2013, a 27% increase on 2012 (4.5Mt). Productivity of the 
processing plant averaged 700tph for the year, 12% above the nameplate design rate of 625tph, as the operations team 
continued to optimise availability and throughput.
Plant metallurgical recoveries were 88.6% in the year, a 2.6% increase on 2012. Continued optimisation of operational 
controls and improved circuit stability resulted in the recovery steadily increasing throughout the year. Whilst operational 
improvements are being made, recoveries are expected to remain consistent until the new carbon regeneration kiln is 
commissioned in 2014.
The dump leach operation produced 12,382oz in 2013, an 85% increase from 2012.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Operational review continued
Stage 4 expansion
Construction continued on Stage 4 of the process plant expansion, which commenced in late 2011 and will expand Sukari 
nameplate capacity from 5Mtpa to 10Mtpa. The estimated capital cost of the Stage 4 expansion, which is funded by PGM 
out of cost recoveries, is US$331.2 million including contingency, with expenditure to date of US$327.8 million. 
Main plant
The processing plant was 97% completed at the end of December. Electrical instrumentation and piping work remained 
outstanding at the end of the period. Commissioning of the new conveyor to the COSP took place in December together 
with direction testing of various motors and pumps. 
Power station
The new Wartsila plant has been completed, and was handed over to operations in October.
Sea water pipeline
The seawater pipeline was completed in December and handed over to operations.
Tailings storage facility
Construction of the facility is 100% complete and the TSF is in operation.

Exploration update
Sukari Hill
Centamin has resources (as of 30 July 2013) of 13.4 million ounces Measured and Indicated, and 1.9 million ounces 
Inferred, and reserves (as of 30 September 2013) of 8.2 million ounces. Underground drilling continued to be stepped‑up 
during the year as new development provided improved access from below surface to test potential high grade extensions 
of the deposit. Underground drilling is utilising 4 Longyear LM90 rigs. These rigs have been located in the Ptah decline, 
drilling east through both the eastern and the western contact of the porphyry and in the Amun area, drilling outwards east 
and west from the within the porphyry. The ore body has neither yet been closed off by drilling to the north, nor at depth. 
Further exploration of the Sukari deposit will take place during 2014, predominantly from positions within the porphyry in 
both the Amun and Ptah areas. 
Regional exploration
Reverse circulation and diamond drilling programmes have been under way on the Quartz Ridge, V‑Shear and Kurdeman 
prospects to the east, north‑east and south of the hill respectively during 2013. Ongoing drilling to the south at the 
Kurdeman prospect offers the potential to fast‑track near surface high grade ore to supplement the existing production. 
Further regional drilling of the Sukari licence is planned for 2014. 
Growth beyond Sukari
Centamin continued exploration on its four tenements in northern Ethiopia where drilling has confirmed the presence of 
low grade mineralisation.
In September 2013 Centamin entered into joint venture with Alecto Minerals plc to pursue existing and new opportunities 
identified by Alecto in Ethiopia. The initial joint venture projects relate to two exploration licences Wayu Boda and Aysid 
Meketel where exploration activities have now commenced.
A recommended all‑share takeover offer for ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Ltd, was announced on 10 December 2013. 
This takeover provides Centamin with an extensive licence holding over a highly prospective and underexplored +100km 
trend of gold mineralisation in Burkina Faso, as well as further exploration properties in Côte d’Ivoire. Centamin will 
implement a systematic exploration program, aimed at developing the outstanding potential for further significant growth 
of the existing resource base, comprising 1.92Moz Indicated and 1.33Moz Inferred.

Results of operations
The Group recorded net profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 of US$184.0 million 
(2012: US$198.6 million). The decrease is driven primarily by the lower gold price which was offset by higher 
volumes of gold sold and lower costs due to management’s rigorous cost control.

Revenue reported comprises proceeds from gold sales and silver sales. Revenue has increased by 18% to US$503.8 million, 
as a result of a 43% increase in gold sold to 363,576oz offset by a 17% decrease in the average gold price to US$1,384 
per ounce. 
Cost of sales represents the cost of mining, processing, refinery, transport, site administration and depreciation and 
amortisation, as well as preproduction costs incurred prior to commercial production and movement in production 
inventory. Cost of sales has increased by 37% to US$277.4 million, as a result of:
(a) a 35% increase in mine production costs to US$237.7 million, primarily due to an increase in activity year on year with  
tonnes moved increasing by 67% and tonnes treated by 26%; 
(b) a 43% increase in depreciation and amortisation from US$35.6 million to US$50.8 million, a result of an increase in the 
underlying and mine development properties; offset by
(c) a US$11.1 million credit for movement in production inventory a result of an increased addition to the ROM ore 
stockpile and the year on year decrease in gold in circuit at year end.
Finance income reported comprises interest revenue applicable on the Company’s available cash and term deposit 
amounts. The movements in finance income are in line with the movements in the Company’s available cash and term 
deposit amounts.
Other comprehensive income has increased by US$9.6 million as a result of the cumulative loss that had been recognised 
in other comprehensive income being reclassified from equity to profit.

Current assets have decreased by US$13.6 million to US$269.3 million, as a result of:
(a)  US$55.6 million in relation to funds advanced to our fuel supplier, Chevron, to ensure the continuous supply of fuel 
for our operations whilst negotiations are ongoing with the Egyptian government on the path forward for fuel subsidies; 
(b) the self‑funding of the Stage 4 expansion amounting to a cash outflow of US$99.3 million; and

expenditure in relation to Sheba tenements in northern Ethiopia;
(e) available‑for‑sale financial assets have decreased by US$4.6 million to US$1.0 million as a result of:
•	 a US$6.3 million devaluation (including foreign exchange loss) in the shares held in Nyota;
•	 the sale of a total of 60 million shares in Nyota for US$0.8 million; both offset by

of US$252.2 million (comprising US$99.3 million for the Stage 4 processing plant, US$77.4 million for the open pit 
mining fleet expansion, US$16.2 million for open pit development, US$29.5 million for underground development, 
US$1.7 million for mine development properties and US$28.1 million for other sustaining capital expenditure); offset by
(h) a depreciation and amortisation charge of US$50.9 million. 
Current liabilities have increased by US$18.7 million to US$78.2 million as a result of the addition to the open pit 
mining fleet.
Non‑current liabilities reported during the period have increased by US$2.1 million as a result of:
(a) a change in estimate of the future rehabilitation costs; and
(b) the unwinding of the discount on the provision for rehabilitation.
There has been no movement in issued capital.
Reserves reported have increased by US$2.3 million to US$5.7 million as result of the recognition of the share‑ based 
payments expense.
Accumulated profits increased by US$190.7 million as a result of the increase in the profit for the year attributable to the 
shareholders of the Company of US$184.0 million together with a US$6.8 million gain on available‑for‑sale financial assets as a 
result of the cumulative loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income being reclassified from equity to profit.
Current ratio is calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities. The decrease in the current ratio is a result 
of the increase in current liabilities driven by the rise in supply relating to higher production at the Sukari Gold Mine and an 
increase in the payables in relation to the open pit mining fleet.
The return on equity ratio is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of the Company 
for the period by total shareholders’ equity and measures the return on ownership. The return on equity ratio showed a 
decrease from 20 for 2012 to 16 for 2013 as a result of the increase in the shareholders equity.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Net cash flows generated by operating activities comprise receipts from gold and silver sales and interest revenue, offset 
by operating and corporate administration costs. Cash flows have increased by US$24.6 million to US$245.1 million, 
primarily attributable to:
(a) an increase in revenue, due to higher gold sales volumes offset by a lower average realised price; and
(b) an increase in cash flows in relation to receivables and payables; both offset by
•	 a decrease in gross margins as a result of the decrease in the average realised gold price; and
•	 an increase in cash flows in relation to inventories and prepayments, in preparation for the increase of the processing 
plant throughput as Stage 4 comes online.
Net cash flows used in investing activities comprise exploration expenditure and capital development expenditures 
at Sukari including the acquisition of financial and mineral assets. Cash flows have decreased by US$39.0 million to 
US$282.8 million. The primary use of the funds during the year was for investment in capital work‑in‑progress in relation to 
the Stage 4 development. In addition cash used in the purchase of available‑for‑sale financial assets was US$2.5 million, 
offset by proceeds received from the sale of available‑for‑sale financial assets of US$0.8 million compared to an outflow of 
US$6.4 million in 2012.
Net cash flows generated by financing activities in the prior year comprised the exercising of shares issued under the 
Company’s Loan Funded Share Plans (“LFSPs”) and options under the Employee Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) respectively. 
There were no such cash flows in the current financial year.
Effects of exchange rate changes have decreased by US$6.3 million as a result of the poor performance of the A$ to 
the US$.

removal of fuel subsidies which occurred in January 2012 (refer to Note 6 to the financial statements for further details).
The Company’s results over the past several quarters have been driven primarily by fluctuations in gold price and 
increases in gold equivalent ounces produced. Additionally, increases in input costs and foreign exchange rates have 
impacted results.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, revenue increased to US$111.2 million on gold equivalent ounces sold of 88,856 
compared with revenue of US$138.5 million on sales of 82,316 gold equivalent ounces during the fourth quarter of 2012. 
The average realised gold price per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2012 was US$1,697 compared with the average realised 
gold price during this quarter of US$1,384 per ounce. 
Cost of sales decreased by 9% to US$72.4 million in the final quarter of 2013 versus US$79.5 million in the prior year, 
and although there were underlying increased costs in the mining area and processing area as a result of increased 
activity quarter on quarter with tonnes moved increasing by 43% and tonnes treated by 14%, Q4 2012 included the full 
exceptional provision against prepayments to reflect the removal of the fuel subsidy which occurred in January 2012.
Liquidity and capital resources
At 31 December 2013, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$106.0 million compared to US$147.1 million at 
31 December 2012. The majority of funds have been invested in international rolling short‑term higher interest money 
market deposits. The decrease in cash position is primarily due to the payments in relation to the Stage 4 processing plant 
development together with unfavourable gold prices and the inclusion of an exceptional provision against prepayments to 
reflect the removal of fuel subsidies offset with increased production. 
Centamin has a strong and flexible financial position with no debt, no hedging and cash and cash equivalents, bullion 
on hand, gold sales receivables and available‑for‑sale financial assets of US$142.5 million at 31 December 2013. 
Cash and cash equivalents, bullion on hand, gold sales receivables and available‑for‑sale financial assets is a non‑GAAP 
financial measure.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Liquidity and capital resources continued
Liquidity risk is the risk associated with not having access to sufficient funds to meet planned and unplanned cash 
requirements. Centamin manages its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating and strategic liquidity levels 
are well above minimum company requirements.
Trade and other payables increased from US$54.6 million to US$78.1 million reflecting the amounts owed for mining 
equipment, which were needed to move the additional material, in readiness for Stage 4.
In the day‑ to‑ day business, the Group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements. The cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise returns while ensuring that 
capital is safeguarded to the maximum extent possible by investing only with financial institutions with a strong credit rating. 
The Group’ s primary source of liquidity is operating cash flow. The principal risk factor affecting operating cash flow is cost, 
gold prices, timing of gold sales and the legal actions in relation to the Concession Agreement and subsidy for diesel fuel oil.
The Group’s financial commitments are limited to planned and discretionary spending on work programmes at the Sukari 
Gold Mine, planned and discretionary spending on work programmes at the exploration licences owned by Sheba, 
administration expenditure at the Egyptian, Australian, Jersey and Ethiopian office locations and for general working 
capital purposes.
Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash flow from operations to manage 
liquidity risks arising from settlement of current liabilities and non‑current liabilities.
We had no debt for both the 2013 and the 2012 period.

Segment disclosure
The Group is engaged in the business of exploration and production of precious metals only, which is characterised as one 
business segment only. See Note 8 to the financial statements.
Significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3 to the financial statements, 
management is required to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions about carrying values of assets and liabilities that 
are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience 
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of 
making the judgments. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgments that management has made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Litigation
The Group is currently a party to two legal actions both of which could, affect its ability to operate the mine at Sukari in 
the manner in which it is currently operated and adversely affect its profitability. The details of this litigation, which relate 
to the loss of the Egyptian national subsidy for diesel fuel oil and the ability of the Group to operate outside the area of 
3km
2
 determined by the Administrative Court of first instance to be the area of the Sukari exploitation lease, are available 
in Note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed Annual Information Form (“AIF”) which is available 
on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. Although it is possible to quantify the effects of the loss the national fuel subsidy, it is not 
currently possible to quantify with sufficient precision the effect of restricting operations to an area of 3km
2
. 
Management discussion & analysis and business review 
continued CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
41
Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Every action is being taken to contest these decisions, including the making of formal legal appeals and, although their 
resolution may take some time, management remains confident that a satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved. 
In the meantime, however, the Group is continuing to pay international prices for Diesel Fuel Oil. With respect to the 
Administrative Court ruling, on 20 March 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Company’s application to 
suspend this decision until the merits of the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus providing assurance that 
normal operations would be able to continue during this process.
Recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation and development expenditure
The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in exploration and evaluation expenditure 
being capitalised for those projects where such expenditure is considered likely to be recoverable through future extraction 
activity or sale or where the exploration activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the 
existence of reserves. This policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and 
circumstances, in particular whether the Group will proceed with development based on existence of reserves or whether 
an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Such estimates and assumptions may change from period 
to period as new information becomes available. If, subsequent to the exploration and evaluation expenditure being 
capitalised, a judgment is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely or the project is to be abandoned, the relevant 
capitalised amount will be written off to the income statement.
Accounting treatment of Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”)
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin Group of companies, reflecting the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession Agreement (see Note 23 to the financial statements).
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year:
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs
The Group is required to decommission, rehabilitate and restore mines and processing sites at the end of their producing 
lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities. The provision has been calculated taking into account the 
estimated future obligations including the costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration and monitoring of 
the affected areas. The provision for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure 
required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date.
Ore reserve estimates
Estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include assumptions on commodity prices, exchange rates, discount 
rates and production costs for future cash flows. It also involves assessment and judgment of difficult geological models. 
The economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate ore reserves may change from period to period. Changes 
in ore reserves affect the carrying values of mine properties, property, plant and equipment, provision for rehabilitation 
assets and deferred taxes. Ore reserves are integral to the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and the calculation of inventory.
Production forecasts from the underground mine at Sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future resource and 
reserve growth. It is the opinion of management and directors that these estimates are both realistic and conservative, 
based on current information. However, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for 
further reserve definition, the life of this part of the mine remains limited and there is a risk that some or all of this growth 
will not materialise with a consequent negative impact on current production forecasts which affect the unit of production 
used in depreciation calculations.
Depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs
Depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs at the Sukari mine is based on reserve estimates. 
Management and directors believe that these estimates are both realistic and conservative, based on current information. 
However, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for further reserve definition, 
the estimated reserves may change with a consequent negative impact on the carrying value of capitalised underground 
mine development. 
Depreciation of the Sukari plant
Sukari plant, capitalised within plant and equipment, is depreciated on a straight‑ line basis over a 45 year economic life. 
When determining the useful economic life of the plant, management has assumed that its exploration activities will lead 
to future reserves increases at the Sukari mine site which will extend its life beyond the current life of mine, which is 2029 
based on current reserves. Management have the option to extend the concession agreement by 30 years beyond its 
current expiry date of 2035. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
42
Accounting policies
The Group adopted IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements for further details. 
There have been no further changes to the Group’s accounting policies during the year. 
Going concern statement
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position 
are set out in this business review. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are also described in this business review above. In addition, Note 26 to the financial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in Note 26 to the financial statements, the Group meets its day‑ to‑ day working capital requirements through 
cash generated by its operations. The current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over (a) the level of 
demand of the Group’s products; (b) the price at which its products can be sold; and (c) the price at which its main raw 
materials can be procured. 
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that 
the Group should be able to continue generating sufficient cash in order to finance its operations and capital expansions. 
During the year the operation of the mine was affected by two legal actions. The first of these followed from a decision 
taken by EGPC to charge international, not local (subsidised) prices for the supply of Diesel Fuel Oil, and the second arose 
as a result of judgment of an Administrative Court of first instance in relation to, amongst other matters, the Company’s 
160km
2
 exploitation lease. In relation to the first decision, the Company remains confident that in the event that it is 
required to continue to pay international prices, the mine at Sukari will remain commercially viable. Similarly, the Company 
remains confident that the appeal it has lodged in relation to the decision of the Administrative Court will ultimately be 
successful, although final resolution of it may take some time. On 20 March 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld 
the Company’s application to suspend the decision until the merits of the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, 
thus providing assurance that normal operations would be able to continue during this process. A detailed summary of the 
litigation is available at Note 20 to the financial statements.
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are 
restricted to a reduced area, it is the directors’ belief that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.
Non‑GAAP financial measures 
Three non‑GAAP financial measures are used in this report:
(1) EBITDA: “EBITDA” is a non‑GAAP financial measure, which excludes the following from profit before tax:
•	 finance costs;
•	 finance income; and
•	 depreciation and amortisation.
Management believes that EBITDA is a valuable indicator of the Group’s ability to generate liquidity by producing 
operating cash flow to fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA is also frequently used by 
investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is multiplied by a factor or “EBITDA multiple” that is 
based on an observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA and market values to determine the approximate total 
enterprise value of a company. EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and 
does not have any standardised definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for 
measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA excludes the impact of cash costs and income 
of financing activities and taxes, and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from 
operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently. The following table provides 
a reconciliation of EBITDA to profit for the year attributable to the Company.

(1) Profit before tax, depreciation and amortisation and EBITDA includes an exceptional provision to reflect the removal of fuel 
subsidies (refer to Note 6 to the financial statements for further details).
(2) Cash cost per ounce calculation: “cash costs per ounce” is a non‑GAAP financial measure. Cash cost per ounce 
is a measure of the average cost of producing an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing the operating costs in a 
period by the total gold production over the same period. Operating costs represent total operating costs less 
administrative expenses, royalties, depreciation and amortisation. Management uses this measure internally to better 
assess performance trends for the Company as a whole. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional 
measures prepared in accordance with GAAP , certain investors use such non‑GAAP information to evaluate the 
Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. The Company believes that these measures provide an 
alternative reflection of the Group’s performance for the current period and are an alternative indication of its expected 
performance in future periods. Cash costs is intended to provide additional information, does not have any standardised 
meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance

Internal controls
Financial reporting controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is 
gathered and reported to management, including the CEO, CFO and COO, on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions 
can be made regarding public disclosure. Management, with the participation of the certifying officers, has evaluated the 
effectiveness of the design and operation, as of 31 December 2013, of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures 
(as defined by the Canadian Securities Administrators). Based on that evaluation, the certifying officers have concluded 
that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that material information relating to the 
Company and its subsidiaries is made known to them by others within those entities. 
Internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our 
financial reporting and compliance with generally accepted accounting principles in our financial statements. Management 
evaluated at implementation the design of internal controls over financial reporting and has concluded that such internal 
controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) adopted by the European Union (“EU IFRS”). In addition, there have been no changes in the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting during the year ended 31 December 2013 that have materially affected, or are 
reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
Financial instruments
At 31 December 2013, the Group has exposure to interest rate risk which is limited to the floating market rate for cash.
The Group does not have foreign currency risk for non‑monetary assets and liabilities of the Egyptian operations as these 
are deemed to have a functional currency of United States dollars. The Group has no significant monetary foreign currency 
assets and liabilities apart from Australian dollar and United States dollar cash term deposits.
The Group currently does not engage in any hedging or derivative transactions to manage interest rate or foreign 
currency risks.
Foreign investment in Egypt
Foreign investments in the petroleum and mining sectors in Egypt are governed by individual production sharing 
agreements (concession agreements) between foreign companies and the Ministry for Petroleum and Mineral Resources 
or the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority (“EMRA”) (as the case may be) and are individual Acts of Parliament.
Title, exploitation and development rights to the Sukari Gold Mine are granted under the terms of the Concession 
Agreement promulgated as Law No. 222 of 1994, signed on 29 January 1995 and effective from 13 June 1995. 
The Concession Agreement was issued by way of Presidential Decree after the approval of the People’s Assembly in 
accordance with the Egyptian Constitution and Law No. 61 of 1958. The Concession Agreement was issued in accordance 
with the Egyptian Mines and Quarries Law No. 86 of 1956 which allows for the Ministry to grant the right to parties to 
explore and mine for minerals in Egypt.
Whilst the Company is the first foreign company to develop a modern large‑scale gold mine in Egypt there is significant 
foreign investment in the petroleum sector. Several large multinational oil and gas companies operate successfully in 
Egypt, some of which have long histories in the country and have dedicated significant amounts of capital. The Company 
believes that the successful track record of foreign investment established by these companies in the petroleum sector is 
an important indication of the ability of foreign companies to attract financing and receive development approvals for the 
construction of major mining projects in Egypt.
Egyptian court litigation 
As discussed elsewhere in this document the Company was involved in two separate actions. The first followed from a 
decision taken by EGPC to charge international, not local prices (subsidised), prices for the supply of Diesel Fuel Oil, and 
the second arose as a result of judgment of an Administrative Court of first instance in Cairo in relation to the Company’s 
160km
2
 exploitation lease. 
Concession agreement court case
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Court in Egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by, 
amongst others, an independent member of the previous parliament, in which he argued for the nullification of the 
agreement that confers on the Group rights to operate in Egypt. This agreement, the Concession Agreement, was  
entered into between the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority (“EMRA”) and Centamin’s  
wholly‑ owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines (“PGM”), and was approved by the People’s Assembly as Law 222 of 1994.
Management discussion & analysis and business review 
continued CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
In summary that judgment states that, although the Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, insufficient 
evidence had been submitted to Court in order to demonstrate that the 160km
2 
“exploitation lease” between PGM 
and EMRA had received approval from the relevant Minister as required by the terms of the Concession Agreement. 
Accordingly, the Court found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 160km
2
 was not valid although it stated 
that there was in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km
2
. Centamin, however, is in possession of the executed 
original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 160km
2
 exploitation lease was approved by the Minister of 
Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It appears that an executed original document was not supplied to the Court. 
Upon notification of the judgment the Group took various steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine 
at Sukari. These included lodging a formal appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 November 2012. 
In addition, in conjunction with the formal appeal the Group applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to suspend the 
initial decision until such time as the Court is able to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. On 20 March 2013 the 
Court upheld this application thus suspending the initial decision and providing assurance that normal operations will be 
able to continue whilst the appeal process is under way. 
EMRA lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 27 November 2012, the day after the Company’s appeal was 
lodged. Furthermore, in late December 2012, the Minister of Petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and shortly thereafter 
publicly indicated that, in his view, the terms of the Concession Agreement were fair and that the exploitation lease was 
valid. The Minister of Petroleum also expressed support for the investment and expertise that Centamin brings to the 
country. The Company believes this demonstrates the government’s commitment to our investment at Sukari and the 
desire to stimulate further investment in the Egyptian mining industry.
The Company does not yet know when the appeal will conclude, although it is aware of the potential for the process 
in Egypt to be lengthy. The Company has taken extensive legal advice on the merits of its appeal from two leading 
Egyptian law firms who have confirmed that the proper steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km
2
 
exploitation lease. The Company therefore remains of the view that the appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will 
ultimately be successful. 
In the event that the appellate court fails to be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the Group, 
the operations at Sukari may be adversely effected to the extent that the Group’s operation exceeds the exploitation 
lease area of 3km
2
 referred to in the original court decision.
The Company remains confident that normal operations at Sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal process is under way. 
Centamin does not currently see the need to take the matter to a court outside of Egypt as Centamin remains of the belief 
that the Egyptian Court will rule in Centamin’s favour.
Further details about this litigation are set out in Note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed Annual 
Information Form (“AIF”) which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Diesel fuel court case
In January 2012 the Group received a letter from Chevron to the effect that Chevron would not be able to continue 
supplying Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) to the mine at Sukari at local subsidised prices, thereby adding approximately 
US$150 per ounce to the cost of production. It is understood that the reason that this letter was issued was that Chevron 
had received a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). Subsequent to 
this first letter, the Group received a demand from Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”) for LE403 million 
(US$60 million) being the amount of the subsidy received in respect of the diesel fuel supplied from December 2009 
until January 2012.
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter and in consequence in June lodged an appeal against EGPC’s 
decision in the Administrative Courts. Again, the Group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is 
good prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the continuation of supply, the Group has 
since January advanced funds to our fuel supplier, Chevron, based on the international price for fuel. Further details about 
this litigation are set out in Note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed AIF which will be available on 
SEDAR at www.sedar.com. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Overview of Sukari concession agreement
Pharaoh Gold Mines NL (“PGM”) a 100% wholly‑ owned subsidiary of the Company, EGSMA (now “EMRA”) and the Arab 
Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) entered into the Concession Agreement dated 29 January 1995, granting PGM and EMRA the 
right to explore, develop, mine and sell gold and associated minerals in specific concession areas located in the Eastern 
Desert of Egypt identified in the Concession Agreement. The Concession Agreement came into effect under Egyptian law 
on 13 June 1995.
A summary of the main terms of the Concession Agreement is as follows:
•	 PGM provides funding to the Operating Company, Sukari Gold Mining Company, (“SGM”) and is responsible for the 
day‑to‑day management of that company;
•	 PGM is entitled to recover: 
• 	 	 all 	 curr ent 	 operating 	 expenses 	 incurr ed 	 and 	 paid 	 after 	 the 	 initial 	 commer cial 	 pr oduction;
• 		 	 exploration 	 costs, 	 including 	 those 	 accumulated 	 to 	 the 	 commencement 	 of 	 commer cial 	 pr oduction 	 (at 	 the 	 rate 	 of	
33.3% per annum); and
• 		 	 exploitation 	 capital 	 costs, 	 including 	 those 	 accumulated 	 prior 	 to 	 the 	 commencement 	 of 	 commer cial 	 pr oduction 	 (at 	 the	
rate of 33.3% per annum).
•	 the ARE is entitled to a royalty of 3% of net sales revenue from the sale of gold and associated minerals from the Sukari 
Gold Mine;
•	 commencing on the date of commercial production, SGM and PGM is entitled to a 15 year exemption from any taxes 
imposed by the Egyptian government, with an option to file an application to extend this entitlement for a further 
15 years;
•	 after the deduction of recoverable expenses and the payment of the 3% royalty, the profits are shared equally between 
PGM and EMRA (with an additional 10% of proceeds paid to PGM in the first two years that there are net proceeds and 
an additional 5% in the following two years);
•	 PGM, EMRA and the Operating Company are exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect to the importation of 
machinery, equipment and consumable items required for the purpose of exploration and mining activities at Sukari; 
•	 PGM, EMRA, the Operating Company and their respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export 
of gold and associated minerals produced from the Sukari Gold Mine; and
•	 legal title of all operating assets of PGM will pass to EMRA when cost recovery is completed. The right of use of all fixed 
and movable assets remains with PGM and SGM.
In addition, the Concession Agreement establishes a procedure for the conversion of any exploration lease granted 
in favour of PGM into an exploitation lease. Upon following the procedure prescribed by the Concession Agreement, 
the Company was granted such an exploitation lease in respect of 160km
2
 in 2005 and is in possession of the original 
document granting this lease duly signed by all relevant parties. The validity of this lease is, however, the subject of the 
litigation referred to above.
For the accounting treatment of the Concession Agreement refer to Note 23 to the financial statements.
Principal risks affecting the Centamin Group
The exploration for and development of metals and mineral resources, together with the construction and development 
of mining operations is a speculative activity that involves a high degree of risk. 
Centamin conducts a variety of risk assessments throughout the year, which are reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee 
and the Board in accordance with best practice guidelines and in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and relevant Canadian requirements. 
Centamin takes a number of measures to mitigate risks associated with its underlying operational and exploration activity 
which are monitored and evaluated regularly. Due to the nature of these inherent risks, it is not possible to give absolute 
assurance that mitigating actions will be wholly effective.
The table below describes the key risks affecting Centamin and its operational and exploration activities together with the 
measures to mitigate risk and the preserved risk by management.
Management discussion & analysis and business review 
continued CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Single project 
dependency for  
near‑term revenues
The Sukari Project currently constitutes Centamin’s main mineral resource and reserve and near‑term production 
and revenue. Any adverse development affecting the progress of the Sukari Project such as, but not limited to 
unusual and unexpected geologic formations, seismic activity, rock bursts, cave‑ins, flooding and other conditions 
involved in the drilling and removal of material, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, mines 
and other producing facilities, or any other event leading to a reduction in production or closure of mines or other 
producing facilities, damage to life or property, environmental damage, hiring suitable personnel and engineering 
contractors, or securing supply agreements on commercially suitable terms.
Mitigating factors include continued growth and expansion through exploration and acquisition targets both 
inside and outside of Egypt. Until further production growth beyond Sukari is identified the risk remains high.
Sukari Project joint 
venture risk and 
relationship with 
EMRA
SGM is owned jointly by PGM and EMRA, with equal board representation, whilst responsibility for the day‑to‑day 
management of SGM rests with the general manager, who is appointed by PGM. The board of SGM operates by 
way of simple majority. As such, should the board of SGM be unable to reach consensus on a matter requiring 
board‑level approval or in the event of any dispute arising between PGM and EMRA, which PGM is unable to 
amicably resolve, it may have to participate in arbitration or other proceedings to resolve the dispute, which 
could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of operations, financial performance 
and prospects.
Any dispute with EMRA may adversely affect Centamin’s ability to manage the Sukari Project in the most 
effective way. Such a dispute could arise under the cost recovery and profit share provisions of the Sukari 
Concession Agreement.
The successful management of the Sukari Gold Mine is in part dependent on maintaining a good working 
relationship with EMRA. The Group has regular meetings with officials from EMRA and invests time in liaising 
with relevant ministry and other governmental representatives. Management and the Board of Directors believe 
the Group has a positive and constructive working relationship with EMRA. The Group complies with all terms 
and conditions of the Concession Agreement covering the Sukari Gold Mine. EMRA has equal representation on 
the Board of Sukari Gold Mines and is involved to that extent in approving and auditing all work programs and 
expenditures. EMRA inspectors are closely involved in monitoring all aspects of the Sukari operations. Current 
discussions with EMRA are focused on determining the exact timing and quantum of the first payment of Profit 
Sharing for Sukari. Whilst the impact would be high, management believes there is a low probability of a material 
deterioration in relationships with EMRA, particularly following the prepayment in relation to future profit share 
made during the year.
Mitigating factors also include ensuring co‑operative relations with EMRA however the risk identified above 
remains moderate.
Failure to achieve 
production 
estimates
Centamin currently prepares estimates of future gold production for its existing and future development of the 
Sukari Gold Mine. There can be no assurance that Centamin will achieve its production estimates and such failure 
could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s future cash flows, profitability, results of operations 
and financial condition. The realisation of production estimates are dependent on, amongst other things: the 
accuracy of mineral reserve and resource estimates; the accuracy of assumptions regarding ore grades and 
recovery rates; ground conditions (including hydrology); physical characteristics of ores; the presence or absence 
of particular metallurgical characteristics; the accuracy of estimated rates and costs of mining (including access 
to and permitting for sufficient quantities of ammonium nitrate and related blasting products), ore haulage, 
the availability of suitable machinery and equipment, skilled labour and processing capacity and all logistics for 
consumables and parts.
Whilst there can be no certainties, production to date has provided confidence in management’s estimation and 
mine planning methods. The pending commissioning of the Stage 4 process plant means that the current risk 
rating remains high.
Operational failures 
and unscheduled 
interruptions
The achievement of Centamin’s operational targets will be subject to the timely completion of planned 
operational goals on budget and the effective support of Centamin’s personnel, contractors, systems, procedures 
and controls and suppliers. Any failure in this regard or any instances of unscheduled interruptions in Centamin’s 
operations due to mechanical or other failures or industrial relations related issues or problems or issues with the 
supply of fuel and other goods or services including spare parts, machinery and explosives, may result in delays in 
the achievement of operational targets with a consequent material adverse impact on Centamin’s business, results 
of operations, financial performance and prospects to include all logistics for consumables and parts.
Mitigating factors include management’s assessment of critical components on the operational infrastructure on 
a continuous basis and keep a large inventory of critical spares. In addition management closely monitor progress 
of both normal operations and expansion projects and have regular dialogue with key project stakeholders and 
suppliers. Operational risk for a mining project on a remote location is moderate, although the rating at present 
is high due to the commissioning of Stage 4. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
48
Capital and 
operational cost 
inflation may 
reduce anticipated 
returns
The capital costs for the Sukari Project and the development of Centamin’s portfolio assets may be significantly 
higher than anticipated due to, amongst other things, unforeseen delays in supplies, labour and material cost 
inflation, local and international political events, or workforce disruption. In turn, this may result in Centamin 
having to make unexpected calls on its treasury reserves or otherwise seek to raise external financing, for which 
there can be no guarantee of success and which may result in value dilution for current shareholders.
The Sukari Project has a limited operating history upon which Centamin can base estimates of future operating 
costs. The costs, timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote 
location of the Sukari Project, as well as Centamin’s other development opportunities. It is common in new mining 
operations to experience unexpected problems and delays during construction, development, mine operation 
and mine expansion. Accordingly, Centamin’s actual results may be subject to both greater variability and difficulty 
in accurately predicting future operating costs and results than would be the case for a company with a longer 
mining history. Estimates of operating costs are based upon, amongst other things: anticipated tonnage, grades 
and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed; anticipated recovery rates of gold and 
other metals from the ore; and cash operating costs based on a bottom‑up approach utilising historical data.  
Cash operating costs, production and economic returns, and other estimates contained in previous studies or 
estimates prepared by or for Centamin may differ from those estimated costs currently anticipated by Centamin.
Whilst there can be no certainties, capital and operational cost control to date has provided confidence in 
management’s budgeting and cost controls implementation.
Mine construction 
and operational 
risks
Planned construction and commissioning of the remainder of the expansion of the Sukari Project and any further 
expansion projects that Centamin undertakes, may be delayed by a number of factors, which could have a 
material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of operations, financial performance and prospects. 
Mining projects can suffer delays in start‑up and commissioning due to late delivery of components, adverse 
weather or equipment failures or delays in obtaining, or renewing where applicable, the required permits or 
consents or gaining access to suitable skilled labour, as well as cost overruns and cost inflation. Furthermore, mine 
construction raises a range of social and environmental issues, including costs associated with rehabilitation of 
areas which have been mined or otherwise disturbed, addressing areas of archaeological significance, forestry 
and water matters, local social, health and community issues upon construction (including compensation for 
land and crops) and again on closure of operations. Any estimates for such costs made by the Centamin Group 
may be insufficient and/or further issues and costs may be identified. Any underestimated or unidentified social 
and environmental costs related to the development and subsequent closure of a mine could potentially reduce 
earnings and otherwise have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of operations, financial 
performance and prospects.
Construction is now largely complete with the commissioning phase now under way although increased 
throughput is unlikely to increase materially until towards the end of Q2 2014.
Reliance on key 
personnel
The success of Centamin’s operations and activities is dependent to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities 
of the directors and management team, including developing and maintaining or, in the context of the recent 
political changes in Egypt, renewing important relationships with governmental and regulatory authorities in 
Egypt. Investors must be willing to rely to a significant extent on Centamin directors and the management team’s 
discretion and judgment. Centamin’s ability to continue to retain, motivate and attract qualified and experienced 
management personnel is vital to the Group’s business. Factors critical to retaining Centamin’s present staff and 
attracting and recruiting additionally highly qualified personnel include, amongst other things, Centamin’s ability 
to provide competitive compensation arrangements. Centamin does not hold key person insurance in respect 
of any members of its management team. There can be no assurance that Centamin will be able to successfully 
recruit and retain the necessary qualified personnel. The loss or diminution in the services of a member of its 
management team or an inability to recruit, train and/or retain necessary personnel could have a material and 
adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of operations, financial performance and prospects.
The Group regularly assess its staff recruitment and retention policies, including its reward structures and 
incentive plans, to assist with labour stability and maintain appropriate investment in training and development 
to safeguard the skills of its work force and senior management. The risk of disruptions within the work force and 
senior management remain elevated but the impacts are assessed as manageable.
Reliance on external 
contractors
Centamin’s underground mining operations at Sukari are conducted by third party contractor Barminco. Centamin 
shareholders must be willing to rely to a significant extent on the expertise and competence of outside contractors 
or sub‑contractors. When the world mining industry is buoyant there is increased competition for the services of 
suitably qualified and/or experienced sub‑contractors, such as drilling contractors, assay laboratories, metallurgical 
testwork facilities and other providers of engineering, project management and mineral processing services. As 
a result, Centamin may experience difficulties in sourcing and retaining the services of suitably qualified and/or 
experienced sub‑contractors on suitable economic commercial terms. The loss or diminution in the services of 
suitably qualified and/or experienced sub‑contractors or an inability to source or retain necessary sub‑contractors 
or their failure to properly perform their services could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, 
results of operations, financial performance and prospects.
Regular reviews are carried out in order to attract, retain and incentivise key employees, including the expatriate 
workforce. Assessments of arrangements with key contractors are undertaken on a regular basis to ensure that 
contracted services and support meet business requirements and expectations.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Dependency upon 
good employee 
relations
Egyptian employment law affords extensive protection to employees. Although management believes its labour 
relations, with both employees and contractors, are good, there can be no assurance that a work slowdown,  
a work stoppage or strike will not occur at the Sukari Project or at any of Centamin’s possible future development 
projects or exploration prospects, even where the workforce is not unionised. Work slowdowns, stoppages, 
disputes with employees or other labour‑related developments or disputes could result in a decrease in 
Centamin’s production levels which could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results  
of operations, financial performance and prospects.
A workers’ representative group has been established for the purpose of facilitating better dialogue with those 
employed at the Sukari Gold Mine, however, strikes have occurred in the past at Sukari and there can be no 
assurance that a future work slowdown, a work stoppage or strike will not occur here or at any of Centamin’s 
other projects. The risk of disruption within the work force remain elevated but the impacts are judged to  
be manageable.
Currency and gold 
price risk
A significant portion of Centamin’s operating expenses are incurred in US dollars, Egyptian pounds and Great 
British pounds, whilst its revenues from gold sales are in US dollars. Furthermore, Centamin does not currently 
maintain any facilities for hedging its exposure to currencies or the price of gold, which fluctuates as a result of a 
number of factors beyond Centamin’s control.
Any appreciation in currencies other than US dollars in which the Group incurs material expenses or adverse 
fluctuations in the gold spot price, could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of 
operations, financial performance and prospects.
Centamin manages its exposure to gold price fluctuations by retaining a focus on keeping operating costs as 
low as possible. However, the risks relating to gold price reductions remain high. The Group has not entered into 
forward foreign exchange contracts. Natural hedges are utilised wherever possible to offset foreign currency 
liabilities. The Company maintains a policy of not hedging its currency positions and maintains currency holdings 
in line with underlying requirements and commitments.
Egyptian  
political risk
With the exception of Centamin’s small Ethiopian exploration portfolio, Centamin’s production and exploration 
activities are entirely in Egypt, a country which has been subject to civil and military disturbance in the last 
two years. There is no assurance that future political and economic conditions in Egypt will not result in the 
government of Egypt adopting different policies respecting foreign development and ownership of mineral 
resources. Any such change in policy may result in changes in laws affecting ownership of assets, use of 
explosives, tenure and mineral concessions, taxation, royalties, rates of exchange, environmental protection, 
labour relations, repatriation of income and return of capital, which may affect both Centamin’s ability to 
undertake exploration, development and operational activities in respect of future properties as well as its 
ability to continue to explore, develop and operate those properties in respect of which it has obtained mineral 
exploration and exploitation rights to date. Egypt also has limited experience of large scale mining operations and 
current laws do not necessarily reflect current international practices (for example in relation to 24 hour blasting 
techniques).
Centamin actively monitors legal and political developments in Egypt and Ethiopia and actively engages in 
dialogue with relevant government and legal policy makers to discuss all key legal and regulatory developments. 
The potential for serious impact should be balanced against the Egyptian government’s support of Centamin’s 
investment and contribution to both revenue and development of the mining industry.
External 
perceptions 
of Egypt
External perceptions of Egypt with respect to political and economic instability and civil unrest may have 
an adverse effect on: The market value of Centamin’s shares or the ability of Centamin to attract suppliers, 
contractors and skilled workers to its operations in Egypt, which could have an adverse impact on capital projects 
and ongoing operations, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of 
operations, financial performance and prospects.
Reserve and 
resource estimates
Mineral resource and reserve figures are prepared by Centamin Group personnel, with the assistance of 
independent geologists. By their nature, mineral resources and reserves are estimates based on a range of 
assumptions, including geological, metallurgical and technical factors. There can be no guarantee that the 
anticipated tonnages or grades expected by Centamin will be achieved.
Management has implemented processes to continuously monitor and evaluate the current life of the Sukari 
Gold Mine, mine plans and production targets. The most recent Technical update was completed in the 
Form 43‑101F1 dated 30 January 2014 and is available at www.sedar.com. This takes into account the latest drill 
results, higher cost environment and the timing of the Stage 4 commissioning. Whilst there are no certainties, 
production to date has provided confidence in management’s estimation and mine planning methods.
Hazardous 
operating 
conditions
The mining operations of Centamin at Sukari are often carried out in extreme temperatures. Whilst Centamin 
maintains strict health and safety policies, Centamin remains susceptible to the possibility that liabilities might 
arise as a result of breaches of these requirements, accidents, fatalities or other workforce‑related misfortunes, 
some of which may be beyond Centamin’s control. The occurrence of any accidents or any of these situations 
could delay production, increase production costs and/or result in material liability for Centamin.
Safety induction and training programs for staff are an essential component of the policies and procedures at 
Sukari and throughout Centamin. Sukari has a strong safety culture and a good track record with a LTIFR of 
0.36 per 200,000 man hours in 2013, a strong improvement on 2012. The Group manages effectively the risks to 
health and safety and so the risk is low. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Litigation risks Centamin’s finances, and its ability to operate in Egypt, may be severely adversely affected by current and any future 
litigation proceedings and it is possible that further litigation could be initiated against Centamin at any time.
Centamin is currently involved in litigation that relates both to (a) the validity of its exploitation lease at Sukari and (b) the 
price at which it can purchase Diesel Fuel Oil.
In order to mitigate this risk Centamin has:
1.  engaged appropriate legal advice and continues to actively pursue its legal rights with respect to the existing 
litigation and its legal advisers believe that Centamin will ultimately be successful in both of these cases; and
2.  management and the Company’s legal advisers monitor both activity in court and local media for signs of any 
litigation that may threaten its operations, finances or prospects.
The potential for serious impact should be balanced against Centamin’s adherence to local laws and agreements, 
as well as the Egyptian government’s support of Centamin’s investment and its proposals for a new investment 
law that could protect Centamin against litigation of this nature.

tran SForming goal S 
for the future
2016 has been a pivotal year for the 
Company. Early in the year I outlined 
the five key short-term priorities of 
the Company:
 › appoint a new Chief Executive Officer 
and new Non-Executive Directors;
 › complete an in-depth independent 
strategic business review;
 › develop the overall investment case;
 › complete the US business plan; and
 › implement a near-term operational 
improvement plan. 
I’m pleased to confirm that these 
initiatives have now all been achieved 
or implemented and have seen the 
Group return to like-for-like sales 
growth in H2.
During the period, I commissioned key 
members of management and 
independent advisors to undertake an 
in-depth review of the business.
A detailed strategic plan for the Group 
was developed with the intention of 
strengthening the Company’s market 
leading position, improving Return on 
Capital Employed and increasing value 
for shareholders over the longer term. 
The Company set the following four 
strategic priorities:

t he strategy now in place will 
aim to unlock the Company’s 
potential
 › grow and innovate the UK core 
estate – through refurbishment of 
the existing buildings to a new 
upgraded brand format, 
accelerating the Arena 
modernisation programme and 
introducing new innovative 
technology to enhance the 
customer experience;
 › Develop new capabilities and gain 
competitive advantage – through 
developing value added 
propositions aimed at 
underdeveloped growth segments, 
relaunching a quality offering for 
advanced booked customers, 
upgrading IT systems to achieve 
deeper digital connectivity and 
refreshing and reinvigorating the 
operating environment;
 › international expansion of clubs 
and brand – through exploiting our 
early mover advantage in California, 
with a club opened in Pomona, Los 
Angeles in early 2017, and 
investigating market potential to 
leverage the Goals brand in Asia, 
and exploring other regions for 
market entry through capital 
efficient routes; and
 › Unlock underlying asset potential – 
through the development of 
additional revenue generating lines 
of business, exploring development 
potential across the property estate 
and remaining open to potential 
accretive, complementary 
business opportunities.
The results of the Strategic Business 
Review and our strategic priorities 
were announced to shareholders on 
3rd June 2016, following which the 
Company raised gross proceeds of 
£16.75m to deleverage the balance 
sheet and allow us to invest in our 
core proposition.
During the year, we significantly 
strengthened the Board with the 
key appointment of Mark Jones 
as Chief Executive Officer; further 
supported by the appointments of 
Michael Bolingbroke as Senior 
Independent Director and Scott 
Lloyd and Christopher Mills as 
Non-Executive Directors. 
Phil Burks, Keith Edelman and Alex 
Short all stood down from the Board 
during the period. I would like to 
acknowledge, on behalf of the Board, 
our thanks for their contribution 
during their terms.
Morris Payton also stepped down from 
the Board in 2016 but remains an 
executive within the Company. He has 
been a tremendous asset to the 
Company for many years and I thank 
him for his ongoing service. 
Shortly after the financial year end Keith 
Rogers stepped down from the Board. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to 
acknowledge and express our sincere 
gratitude to Keith for his invaluable and 
constructive contribution to the Board 
over the years. 
Finally, I would like to thank all of our 
employees who have provided huge 
support and backing to the changes 
made during this pivotal year for the 
Company. It has been a pleasure to 
work with everyone.

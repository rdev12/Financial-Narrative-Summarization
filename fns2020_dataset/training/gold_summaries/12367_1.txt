Resources and exploration
We have continued our efforts in near-mine exploration in the 
Dukat licence area. In 2014, Dukat flanks and deep levels will 
see additional drilling concentrating on extensions of known 
veins beyond the down-dip limitations of historic exploration. 
We will also attempt to discover a new vein down plunge  
of the host rock formation, under the cover of sedimentary 
rocks. At Olcha, drilling will focus on the underground  
potential of currently known veins with an ore reserve  
estimate expected by the 2014 year-end.

 2014 pRioRities
In 2014, we plan to produce about 400 Koz of gold 
equivalent at Dukat since we expect the strong grade  
and recovery profile to continue. This will be enhanced  
by increased capacity at both Lunnoye and Omsukchan 
plants where throughput of 400 Ktpa and 1,600 Ktpa  
of ore, respectively, is anticipated.
At Arylakh, the transition to underground mining will be 
completed and the open pit is likely to close in Q2 2014.  
At Lunnoye, from Q3 2014 onwards, underground mining 
is expected to shift more towards the Zone 7 mine with 
lower gold and higher silver grades.
We will continue to work with our diversified off-taker base 
in Japan, South Korea and Kazakhstan in order to achieve 
optimum cost performance and recovery for the flotation 
and gravity concentrates produced at Dukat.
In 2014, if the market conditions are favourable, we will 
start development activities at the Olcha satellite deposit, 
where mining is expected to commence in 2015.

Operating review
continued
Despite a significant revision in annual and medium-term  
mine plans triggered by adverse movement of commodity 
prices in the first half of 2013, Omolon demonstrated  
a robust operating performance during the year. It was 
underpinned by flexibility and resilience offered by the concept 
of a processing hub with multiple feed sources. We were 
therefore able to reallocate the mining volumes promptly  
and deliver on our original targets in terms of gold equivalent 
production, producing 158 Koz of gold equivalent during  
the year.
2013 highlights
Mining
With the launch of mining at Dalneye in the third quarter, 
Omolon currently has four sources of ore: higher grade ore 
from Birkachan and ore from Tsokol are processed at the  
CIP circuit of the Kubaka plant; high-grade ore from Sopka  
and Dalneye is trucked to Kubaka and processed at the 
Merrill-Crowe circuit.
2013 saw a significant reallocation of mining volumes at the 
Omolon hub in response to the adverse changes in the gold  
and silver price. Open-pit mining was suspended at the 
Birkachan mine, which had the highest cash cost level, with 
mining volumes reallocated to Tsokol, Sopka and Dalneye, 
where a higher grade profile ensures lower cost levels.  
As a result, ore mined at Birkachan decreased by 55% 
compared to 2012.
At Sopka, the amount of ore mined was 672 Kt, a 47% 
decrease compared to 2012, while average grades for both 
gold and silver increased by 73% and 47% respectively.  
The decrease was largely driven by the availability of existing 
stockpiles and revision of the mine plan as a result of the 
Group’s strategic review. At Sopka, trucking of ore by winter 
road was successfully completed by the end of the first  
quarter of 2013 with 320 Kt of high-grade ore trucked. 
The heap leach project for low-grade Sopka and Dalneye ore 
has been further postponed from 2015 to 2016. Consequently, 
the last pushback in the Sopka pit has also been excluded 
from the mine plan with some loss of reserves below the 
current pushback boundary. The potential for underground 
mining at Sopka will be assessed by Q4 2014.
Mining at Dalneye commenced in the middle of the year  
and is now continuing at full scale. A total of 584 Kt of ore  
was mined in 2013, and the first 42 Kt of high-grade ore  
was trucked by winter road to the Kubaka mill during Q4,  
ahead of schedule. 
At Tsokol, volumes of waste and ore mined have increased 
considerably compared to 2012 as mining volumes  
were reallocated to the deposit following suspension  
of the Birkachan mine. Ore mined grew more than twofold  
to 223 Kt with an average gold grade of 4.8 g/t.

Processing
At the Kubaka plant, total throughput increased by 6%  
to 767 Kt and recoveries for both gold and silver increased  
by 1% to 95.3% and 88.4% respectively. This helped  
to partially offset the decline in average grades processed  
(-13% for both gold and silver) driven mainly by the expected 
average grade decline in ore from Sopka. As a result, gold 
equivalent production for 2013 was 158 Koz, down 9%. 
As part of the strategic review, management decided  
to defer the start of heap leaching at Birkachan (originally 
scheduled for Q2 2013) but to continue ore stacking during 
2013. We are planning to start leaching in 2014 with more  
ore stacked to achieve a better cost profile due to economies 
of scale. The heap leaching will then operate through to 2016.
Reserves, resources and exploration
Our brownfield exploration activities for Omolon in 2013  
were focused on several targets within a range of 150 km  
of the Kubaka plant in order to extend the life-of-mine.  
The reserve attrition at Birkachan and Sopka was partially 
compensated by resource-to-reserve conversion  
at Oroch at 1 January 2014 (+218 Koz of gold equivalent 
reserves). Mining at Oroch is expected to commence  
in 2015. New resource additions from Burgali and  
Nevenrekan (both saw additional in-fill and step-out  
drilling in 2013) are expected in 2014.

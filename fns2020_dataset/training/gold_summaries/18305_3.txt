 Overview 
This has been an extraordinary year , with the
number of deaths changing in percentage
terms by a greater amount than any year since
1952. As a result, the Group’s funeral and
cremation volumes were much higher than
originally expected. However , I am delighted
that across the country our standards did not
falter and that we continued to give families 
we had the privilege of helping, the excellent
client service for which we are known. 
In financial terms, this has resulted in
underlying operating profit increasing 16 per
cent to £98.7 million (2014: £84.9 million) and
underlying earnings per share increasing 34
per cent to 114.8 pence (2014: 85.8 pence).
Dividends
The Board is proposing a final dividend of
14.31 pence per Ordinary Share, bringing 
the total dividend for the year to 21.45 pence;
another increase of 10 per cent on the
previous year . If shareholders approve this
payment at the Annual General Meeting
(‘AGM’) on 9 June 2016, then it will be paid on
24 June 2016 to members on the register at
close of business on 20 May 2016.
Delivering a consistent performance
The high number of deaths in 2015 to some
extent masks the fact that it was another good
and consistent performance by the Group: client
service remained high; costs continued to be
controlled; cash continued to be invested in
corporate activity, including the larger than
normal acquisition of 36 locations from Laurel
Funerals; crematoria opportunities have been
developed; sales of pre-arranged funeral plans
continued;and profits continued to be converted
efficiently into cash to fund these activities.
As such, the investment case for shareholders
of Dignity being a stable, predictable, cash
generative business continues.
Board priorities and changes
During the period, Ishbel Macpherson left the
Board and was replaced by David Blackwood.
Ishbel has supported the Group since 2009
when I became Chairman. I am grateful for 
her contribution over that time, both on the
Board and as chair of the Group’s Audit
Committee since 2012.
David joined us following his retirement as
Chief Financial Officer of Synthomer plc, a
FTSE 250 group. Given his recent experience,
David has been appointed Chair of the Audit
Committee and will also sit on both the
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
I am sure he will make a valuable contribution
in the coming years. 
My thanks extend to the entire Board for its
support and assistance in keeping the Group
focused on its strategic objectives.
Our people
This year has been significantly busier for our
staff than anyone could have imagined a year
ago. Despite this, client service has remained
very high. Each member of staff has ensured
that, in their own way, nothing was too much
trouble for each family we looked after at one
of the most difficult times in their lives. Thank
you to each and every member of staff for 
your hard work.
Outlook for 2016
The Group stated several times during 2015
that, based on long-term historical data, there
is a strong possibility the number of deaths 
in 2016 may be significantly lower than 2015.
The first two months of the new financial year
have not changed this view and therefore the
Group’s financial expectations for 2016 and
beyond continue to remain unchanged. As a
result, current market expectations are that
profit before tax in 2016 will be slightly lower
than that reported in 2015.
Nevertheless, the Group notes that achievement
of current market expectations in 2016 would
mean earnings per share would have increased
by approximately 30 per cent over the period
2014 to 2016, well ahead of the Group’s
continuing medium-term target of increasing
earnings per share by 10 per cent per year .

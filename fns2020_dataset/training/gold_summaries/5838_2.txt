Glossary
Contents “ This has been a particularly active year for the 
Company, with a dramatic boost to production, 
and cash flow, together with a steady, fully  
funded exploration programme. We have  
increased our portfolio significantly through  
a large number of licence awards, including  
our first award in Iceland, and outstanding  
results in the 2012 APA round in Norway and  
UK 27th Round.
“ This success demonstrates Faroe’ s ability to 
continue to deliver solid value for shareholders 
through the drill-bit, licence awards and 
transactions; further differentiating ourselves  
and securing our position as one of the most  
active UK listed explorers. The considerable 
increase in cash flow from our production  
base, combined with healthy cash balances  
and debt facilities ensures we are well financed 
going forward.”

CHAIRmAN’S STATEmENT
ReSult S
Although the challenging macroeconomic 
conditions, which have recently created so 
much uncertainty across the international 
markets in which we operate, persisted 
throughout 2011, I am once again pleased to 
report a very strong set of results for the Group.
Revenue increased to £5,109.5 million  
(2010: £4,829.6 million), an increase of 7%  
at constant exchange rates, due to strong 
organic growth in North America, Continental 
Europe and Rest of the World combined with 
the impact of recent acquisitions, partly offset 
by lower sales in UK & Ireland.
Operating profit before intangible amortisation 
and acquisition related costs was £335.7 
million (2010: £306.7 million), up 10% at 
constant exchange rates, as margins improved 
in all business areas. On the same basis the 
Group operating margin improved by 20 basis 
points to 6.6%. Adjusted earnings per share 
before intangible amortisation, acquisition 
related costs and the loss on disposal of 
business were 68.5p (2010: 60.6p), an 
increase of 13% at constant exchange rates. 
Adverse currency translation movements, 
principally the US dollar, reduced the growth 
rates marginally, by less than 1%.
DiviD en D
The Board is recommending a 13% increase  
in the final dividend to 18.3p. This brings the 
total dividend for the year to 26.35p, also a 
13% increase. Shareholders will again have  
the opportunity to participate in our dividend 
reinvestment plan.
St RAte Gy
We continue to pursue our established strategy 
of developing the business by organic growth 
and improved efficiencies and consolidating 
the markets in which we compete through 
focused acquisitions in both existing and  
new geographies. 
We achieve our organic growth by applying  
our resources and expertise to enable 
customers to outsource to Bunzl the 
purchasing, consolidation and distribution  
of a broad range of goods not for resale. By 
doing so our customers are able to focus on 
their core business more cost effectively by 
achieving purchasing efficiencies and savings, 
freeing up working capital, improving their 
distribution capabilities and simplifying their 
internal administration. Acquisition activity, 
which started to pick up in 2010, continued 
strongly throughout 2011 with £185 million 
invested during the year acquiring businesses 
with annualised revenue of more than  
£200 million. Having pursued our strategy 
consistently over many years, we have built 
leading positions in a variety of market sectors 
across the Americas, Europe and Australasia. 
ven Din G DiSpOSAl
As announced on 30 August, we divested our 
vending business in the UK during the second 
half of the year. This business, originally 
acquired in 1999, no longer met our strategic 
aims and the Board therefore decided to sell it. 
The net cash proceeds amounted to £31 million 
and the loss on disposal was £56 million.
inve Stment
We have continued to invest in the business  
in order to support our growth strategy  
and ensure that we retain our competitive 
advantage, thereby maintaining our leadership 
in the marketplace. Improving and upgrading 
our IT systems and warehouse facilities, both 
as we integrate new businesses into the Group 
and look to improve our existing infrastructure, 
are critical to our success in being able to serve 
our customers in the most efficient and 
appropriate manner.
Bunzl’s success is based on 
the strength and resilience  
of our business model, the 
execution of a consistent 
strategy, understanding our 
customers’ requirements and 
our ability to deliver everyday 
essential products when and 
where they are needed.

CORpORAte Re SpOnSibility
Bunzl is a responsible company which is only 
sustainable if we maintain profitability through 
business practices which positively impact 
stakeholders, whether customers, employees 
or suppliers. Business integrity together with 
committed, well trained employees working in 
a safe environment, focusing on reducing our 
environmental impact, contributing to the 
communities in which we operate, encouraging 
our suppliers to adopt a similar ethos and 
helping our customers to meet their Corporate 
Responsibility (‘CR’) goals, particularly those 
relating to sustainability, are all intrinsic to our 
everyday business. During 2011 we have 
developed and implemented tailored training 
modules covering our CR policies including 
those relating to our business conduct/code  
of ethics such as gifts and entertainment, 
facilitation payments and our whistle blowing 
process. In addition we have enhanced some 
of our existing CR associated controls and 
procedures and the due diligence processes 
undertaken prior to acquiring a business or 
when appointing agents. Our CR policies have 
also been shared with our key suppliers to 
promote similar levels of CR activity in their 
own businesses.

As a service oriented company we continue 
to rely on the quality and efficiency of our 
employees across the world. One of the 
strengths of our business is the enthusiasm, 
loyalty and long service of our employees 
which assists in the continuity and delivery  
of our service offering as well as helping  
to ensure the smooth integration of newly 
acquired businesses into Bunzl. We are very 
grateful for the continuing hard work and 
commitment of all our employees and we 
welcome all the new employees who have 
joined the Group during 2011 whether  
through acquisition or recruitment. 
CReDit FAC ilitie S
The Group remains highly cash generative  
and we continue to have access to diverse 
sources of funding to achieve our strategic 
objectives. In 2011 our net cash inflow was 
£63 million despite cash expenditure of  
£161 million on acquisitions. In April 2011  
we drew approximately £75 million (sterling 
equivalent) of US private placement funds 
which we had agreed in 2010 and during the 
year we also agreed approximately £350 million 
of medium term banking facilities, the vast 
majority of which were renewals of existing 
facilities. Our undrawn committed facilities  
at the end of the year were £621 million. 
bOARD
Charles Banks, who served as a non-executive 
director for almost nine years, latterly as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, 
retired from the Board after our Annual General 
Meeting in April. His independent advice and 
significant contribution to our success were 
greatly appreciated. Peter Johnson, who has 
been a non-executive director since 2006  
and the Senior Independent Director since 
2010, was appointed as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. Eugenia Ulasewicz 
was appointed as a non-executive director  
in April. Currently President of Burberry, 
Americas, she has a wealth of experience in 
the retail sector and has overseen the recent 
growth and successful development of 
Burberry’s businesses in North and South 
America which includes both wholesale and 
retail businesses and an extensive distribution 
network. We welcome her to the Board.

 Chief Executive’s Review Continued

The current year
The redevelopment of the Walton-on-Thames shopping centre has not progressed as we would have wished
and, as a consequence, the expansion and refurbishment of our Walton store has been significantly delayed. 
Despite continued disruption to our trading, I am pleased to report that the store performed well and sales
continue to move ahead of last year.  This achievement is a testament to the hard work and loyalty of all the
Walton team, who are to be congratulated.  It is to be hoped that the development of the shopping centre and
the refurbishment of our store will commence during 2003.
We plan to refurbish the ground floor of our Bedford store in addition to some work on the first and second
floors.  A young fashion department will be introduced and the cosmetic and accessories departments
increased in size to reflect the continued success of these categories.
In Bournemouth, the lower ground floor will be completely refurbished.  The gift department will double in size
and move from the ground to the lower ground floor, which will allow a similar expansion of the stationery
department.  Concurrently, new departments will be added to the ground and lower ground floors.
We shall continue to progress the integration of the three stores acquired in 2002 to ensure that they meet our
assortment and system requirements.
Whilst some of the strategic changes made over past months will take time to be fully implemented and
effective, I am confident that the changes will be to the real benefit of both customers and shareholders. 
Cumulatively, sales in the nine core stores for the first eleven weeks to 18 January 2003 were 1.9% below
previous year.  In the same period, the acquired stores’ sales were 1.1% below expectations.

Results
Group sales for the year ended 2 November 2002 of £88,637,000 were 13.5% above the previous 53 week
period. These included sales generated from the acquisitions.  On a comparable 52 week basis, the core Group
sales from ongoing operations, excluding acquisitions, increased in the year by 1.0%.  As reported at the
interim, the first half like for like sales were 1.6% up.  However, a more difficult trading environment resulted in a
like for like increase in the second half of 0.2%.  The gross profit achieved in the year of £32,091,000 was at a
margin of 36.20% for the Group.  This was a reduction of 0.63% from the previous year, due predominantly to
the substantially lower margin from the acquired stores.  Administrative expenses for the Group of £29,407,000
increased by 18.2% on the previous year.  This sizeable increase resulted principally from direct operating
expenses relating to the acquisitions.  On a like for like basis excluding acquisitions, administrative expenses
increased by 3.1%.
Acquisitions
The purchase of the Ealing, Tonbridge and Worthing stores during the year for a total consideration of
£5,333,000 (including transaction costs) is the Group’s most significant expansion since Beale PLC became a
listed company.  Goodwill relating to the acquisitions of £990,000 is being amortised over 20 years.  The three
stores increased the Group’s trading square footage by 40%.  They provide a strong profit potential for the
Group.  Even though the three stores’ turnover for the part year was £11,258,000, the absence of profitable
Christmas trading resulted in the acquisitions yielding an operating loss of £329,000 for the period.  Since
acquiring the new stores, considerable management focus and planned investment in fixed assets and working
capital should ensure that the investments will prove to be beneficial.
Taxation
The Group’s tax charge for the year was £885,000, an effective tax rate of 35.0% (2001 33.9%).  The tax
charge is based on the standard rate of 30.0% (2001 30.0%) and reflects the adverse impact of non-qualifying
capital spend.
Treasury
Treasury activities are governed by procedures and policies approved by the Board.  The Group’s policy is to
take a conservative stance on treasury matters and no speculative positions are taken in financial instruments. 
The treasury function manages the Group’s financial resources in the most appropriate cost and tax efficient
manner, minimising the Group’s exposure to risk arising from interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations.
Economic and Monetary Union
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of Economic and Monetary Union.  If the UK were to adopt
a single European currency, then the cost to the Group would depend on the relevant policies and timing.

Accounting policies
The Group’s accounting policies are detailed in note 1 of the financial statements.  The implementation of
FRS19 “Deferred Tax” in the year had no impact on the Group results as 100% provisioning had already been
made.  The transitional provisions for FRS17 “Retirement Benefits” give further disclosure as detailed in note 26.
 We are reviewing the impact of International Accounting Standards in anticipation of full adoption for the year
ending October 2006.
Investment and cash flow
In addition to the acquisition purchase of £5,333,000, the Group invested a further £2,919,000 (2001
£2,560,000) in capital expenditure with major projects in Bournemouth, Worthing and Yeovil.
In order to finance the acquisitions, loan facilities of £12.5m were put in place.  The Group generated cash of
£4,228,000 (2001 £5,436,000) from operating activities leaving net debt at the year end of £7,363,000 (2001
£1,423,000).
Earnings, dividends and shareholding
During the year, the Beales Three Year Sharesave Scheme matured, resulting in the exercise of 273,421 share
options by staff at a price of 80.0p per share.
Profit after taxation was £1,644,000 (2001 £2,530,000) resulting in earnings per share of 8.11p (2001 12.39p).
 During the year, an interim dividend of 1.95p (2001 1.85p) was paid.  The proposed final dividend of 4.15p
(2001 3.90p), when added to the interim payment, results in a total dividend per share of 6.10p, an increase in
excess of 6.0% on the previous year.  The dividend distribution reflects the Board’s confidence that the
acquisitions made during the year will enhance shareholder value.

eurodis electron annual report 2002
Our results for the financial year ended 
31 May 2002, before restructuring costs,
were in line with market expectations. 
They reflect the downturn in the electronic
component market which was evident
before the year began and is now the
deepest and longest in the history of the
industry. Utilisation of production capacity
has been at its lowest level ever for most 
of the year and demand has been weak 
in virtually all market segments. We saw
bookings improve a little in our third 
quarter as a consequence of the
inventory correction coming to an end,
but they have slowed again, reflecting
continuing weak demand.
Management has responded decisively 
to these difficult conditions. Operating
expenses have been reduced by some
20% through a series of cuts in the
workforce. This has been a difficult and
expensive process, because of the many
different employment legislation regimes
across Europe. It does, however, improve
potential future profitability once market
conditions improve. The Group’ s net debt
has also been reduced significantly mainly
as a result of lowering working capital.
We have enhanced our position as
Europe’ s third largest electronic
component distributor. The sales of our
components business fell by 26% on a
comparable basis, a smaller decline than
any of our principal competitors, and the
market as a whole which fell by some
32%, illustrating that we continue to build
market share across Europe.
Sale of Data Division
On 25 January 2002, we announced 
the sale to Bechtle AG of Eurodis Data,
our computer products and services
business in Switzerland. After deducting
costs, excluding tax, relating to the
transaction, the net proceeds were 
s11.1 million (£6.9 million), generating a
profit of s6.3 million (£3.9 million). The
proceeds were used to reduce further
the Group’ s borrowings and gearing.
In the year to 31 May 2001, Eurodis Data
contributed sales of s44.1 million
(£27.1 million) and an operating profit of
s2.5 million (£1.5 million), out of a Group
total of s31.3 million (£19.3 million).
The sale completes our strategy of
disposing of non-core activities.
Results and Dividend
For the first time, we are reporting our
results in euro, with a pro-forma
consolidated profit and loss account,
balance sheet and cash flow in Sterling
attached. This is because some two-thirds
of sales are from our operations in the
euro zone, and this is now our operational
currency.
Sales declined to s565.8 million 
(£349.2 million) from s731.8 million
(£450.5 million) in the prior year. 2002
includes only 8 months of the Data division
which was sold on 31 January 2002, 
and 2001 included only 8 months of our
Nordic components business which 
was acquired on 29 September 2000.
“Results reflect market downturn… net debt 
reduced significantly… restructuring reduces
operating expenses… we expect little sign of 
recovery before 2003”.

eurodis electron annual report 2002
The profit before tax, restructuring costs,
goodwill amortisation and non operating
items was s4.5 million (£2.8 million)
compared with s21.9 million (£13.5 million)
in the prior year. This substantial fall in
profitability was the consequence of the
exceptionally difficult market conditions,
partially offset by a reduction in operating
expenses.
The restructuring costs comprise principally
the costs of terminating the employment
of some 200 employees and the non
operating items include mainly the profit
on the sale of the Data division and
goodwill amortisation. We expect to have
further one-off costs in the current year 
as a result of further staff reductions, the
closure of eight warehouses and the
franchise reduction programme, all of
which will increase profitability in the
future. We do not anticipate further
restructuring costs after the current year.
Cash flow was strong in the year, mainly
from reducing working capital but also
from the sale of the Data division. Net
debt at 31 May 2002 was s50.0 million
(£31.9 million) compared with s75.4 million
(£45.1 million) a year earlier. Excluding the
finance leases for the equipment in the
new logistics centre, net bank borrowings
reduced from s69.6 million (£41.6 million)
to s35.7 million (£22.7 million) in the year.
Without the effect of disposals and
exchange adjustments, this would give a
reduction of s23.5 million (£15.5 million).
Despite the decline in profits, the Directors
are proposing an unchanged final dividend
of 2.5 pence per Ordinary share. This
makes a total of 4.23 pence for the year
(2001: 4.23 pence). If approved, the final
dividend will be paid on 1 November 2002
to shareholders on the register on 
4 October 2002. This decision was taken
because the current poor market
conditions are considered to be
exceptional, because some upturn is
expected during the current year and
because the substantial reduction in
operating expenses, which has been
achieved in the restructuring process,
will improve the potential profitability of
the Group’ s business model in the future.
Operations
The Chief Executive’ s report on
operations follows this statement.
The management has taken a radical
approach to restructuring the business
which has not only reduced the
Company’ s cost base significantly to
counteract the effect of the difficult
market conditions, but also lowers
permanently the prospective expense
percentage to sales of the Group. It has
also created a more focussed sales
organisation which will enhance our
momentum of gaining market share,
thereby taking full advantage of our
strategic position.
Prospects
Indications from external factors are 
mixed. Business confidence is low 
which continues to depress corporate
spending. The German economy is
weak, affecting demand in Europe’ s
largest market. On the other hand, global
capacity utilisation has risen from less
than 70% to more than 80% in the last 
six months and is expected to continue
rising. Also, order receipts are now slightly
higher than billings, albeit at a low level.
In the short term, we expect to see little
sign of recovery before calendar 2003. 
We will continue to contain our costs 
and should be able to maintain our
momentum of increasing our market
share through new franchises and focus
on key products and customer
segments. This will maximise the Group’ s
performance during the remaining
months of weak demand while putting 
us in the best position possible to benefit
from the next upturn.

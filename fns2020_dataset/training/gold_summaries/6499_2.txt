Genel Energy plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
OUR RESPONSIBLE APPROACH
Supporting and sustaining the communities in which we operate 
is fundamental to Genel Energy’s success and our commitment  
to being a sustainable business. 
We are committed to conducting operations in an ethical manner 
that embraces safety, responsible environmental management, 
and the development of positive and enduring relationships with 
the people and communities in those areas in which we operate. 
Our operations are supported by an extensive community 
investment programme which aims to improve the lives of the 
communities with whom we work.
OUR MARKETS
The signing of an energy agreement between the Turkish 
government and the Kurdistan Regional Government in 
November 2013 helped to solidify the increasingly close 
relationship between the KRG and Turkey, and clarified the  
route to market for our world-class oil and gas resources. 
The Iraq-Turkey pipeline is currently being commissioned, and  
the Gas Sales Agreement illustrates a clear path to export for  
our internationally significant Miran and Bina Bawi gas resources. 
With a leading resource position, our strong track record in the 
KRI and our Turkish roots, Genel Energy is uniquely positioned  
to convert this resource base into a very valuable, material new 
business. Turkish growth in gas demand has averaged 10% a year 
over the last 10 years – the highest of any country in Europe and 
Eurasia. Miran and Bina Bawi are set to provide this huge market 
with 20% of its total gas need. 
OUR BUSINESS
We explore for, develop and produce oil and gas, focusing on areas 
where we can achieve material positions in world-class assets.
OUR STRATEGY
We aim to maximise the potential from our existing assets in  
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq on a broadly cash flow neutral  
basis, building a high-impact exploration portfolio and creating 
significant value with the drill bit. While maintaining the highest 
level of corporate governance, we retain a clear focus on 
maximising shareholder returns through monetising at all points  
in the exploration, development and production cycle – with the 
potential of returning any excess cash to shareholders. In so doing 
our objective is to build a world-class independent E&P company.
OUR MANAGEMENT
We have a top-quality management team with the operational and 
technical capability to deliver our strategy, from the identification 
of new geographies to increasing production capacity.
GOVERNANCE
We operate our business to the highest standards of corporate 
governance, in full compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We seek the best possible performance in this area and 
continually review our approach.
RISK
We work to manage and appropriately mitigate the risks within 
our control, ensuring we have a deep understanding of the 
countries and regions in which we operate.
REMUNERATION
We have a strong, independent Remuneration Committee  
to ensure that we meet the high standards we have set for 
ourselves. The executive management team is provided with 
appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance  
and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the success of Genel Energy.
OUR REACH
We have material positions in four world-class fields in the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq, where we are the largest independent  
oil producer and largest holder of gas resources, and have 
assembled a high-impact African exploration portfolio.
We have significant positions across Africa, with a portfolio  
of exploration assets in Morocco, Malta, Somaliland, Ethiopia  
and Côte d’Ivoire. A multi-well drilling programme on these  
assets is now underway, targeting world-class finds.
GENEL ENERGY AT A GLANCE
OUR VISION IS TO BUILD A MAJOR E&P COMPANY . DURING 2013 WE HAVE 
CONTINUED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING THIS GOAL.

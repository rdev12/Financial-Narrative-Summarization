Chief Executive’s review
The Group continued its progress in 2014 helped by good growth in 
our automotive and aerospace businesses which more than offset 
the headwinds of adverse currency translation and difficult land 
systems markets. Although management sales declined to  
£7 ,456 million, this represented underlying, organic growth 
of 4%. Earnings per share increased by 1% and the Board has 
recommended an increase to the dividend of 0.5 pence.
Our aim is to create long term and sustainable shareholder value 
through a balanced approach with three elements: growth, trading 
margin and return on invested capital. 
We look to grow sales ahead of our markets, have targeted our 
Group margin to run in the 8-10% range and have a goal for return on 
invested capital (ROIC) of around 20%. I am pleased that in 2014 we 
made progress against all three of these objectives.

Moving forward
Our business
Over the course of the year we have seen the benefit of our business 
model. We are a global engineering business serving the world’s 
leading original equipment manufacturers in three large markets. 
But whichever the market, our approach and strategy are the same: 
using our knowledge of our customers and their needs, combined 
with our leading technology, excellent global footprint and broad 
operational excellence, to design, develop and deliver outstanding 
products. This requires a thorough understanding of market trends 
and a strong capability for product innovation. There are good 
examples of both throughout this report including the case studies 
featured on pages 25-37.
The table opposite summarises some strategic landmarks for the 
Group and in the business review (pages 22-37) we set out the most 
noteworthy divisional achievements. Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
17 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
Leading in our chosen markets – excellent positions in their markets 
helped all four divisions prove successful in winning new business 
during 2014. GKN Aerospace won business for both aerostructures 
and engine systems, with the risk and revenue sharing partnership to 
supply components for the Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW100 Geared 
Turbofan
TM
 engine. GKN Driveline won significant sideshaft business 
with Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, BMW, Renault Nissan, Mazda 
and Hyundai whilst successfully designing and launching several 
all-wheel drive products with Fiat, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover. 
For GKN Powder Metallurgy, new business wins in the year totalled 
£165 million, higher than last year’s equivalent and including a 
good proportion of higher margin ‘Design for Powder Metallurgy’ 
components. For GKN Land Systems, the tough markets limited 
options, but its business in the industrial market continued to do 
well, successfully exploiting its leadership in clutches and brakes.
During the year we sold our stake in the emissions control business 
Emitec, a good business with sound prospects, but which did not 
give GKN a route to a leadership position in that market. 
Leveraging a strong global presence – having manufacturing 
plants and design centres located around the world, close to our 
customers, is an important strategic advantage for GKN. We also use 
the regional presence of one division to help other divisions enter or 
expand in that market. 
Mexico and Asia in general saw the greatest activity in this respect. 
Over the course of 2014, Group capital investment in Mexico and 
Asia was £37 million and £56 million respectively.
China continues to be an important market for GKN. Although the 
country’s economic growth has eased in recent years, growth of 
around 7% remains very attractive. We have continued to build 
our GKN Driveline joint venture company whilst at the same time 
expanding the activities of GKN Land Systems and GKN Powder 
Metallurgy in the country. We are also seeking to establish GKN 
Aerospace in China but this remains a work in progress.
Differentiating ourselves through technology – our excellent 
technology helped win significant business this year. This was clearly 
demonstrated through GKN Driveline’s critical role in the Fiat Chrysler 
small all-wheel drive platform, GKN Powder Metallurgy driving its 
margin through new ‘Design for Powder Metallurgy’ component 
wins and GKN Land Systems winning new business with Claas on 
the back of superior technical offering. GKN Aerospace continued 
building its position as a technology leader and was pleased to be 
awarded leadership of a challenging £30 million future wing research 
programme, backed by the UK’s Aerospace Technology Institute. 
They also delivered an innovative wing leading edge demonstrator to 
the Clean Sky programme, helping bring an ultra-high performance, 
natural laminar flow wing closer to reality.
Increasing investment was made into advanced engineering projects 
looking to the longer term, including development work on additive 
manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), the electrification of 
vehicle powertrains, future wing technologies and energy storage.  
All look likely to drive significant market changes in the future.

Operational excellence – is fundamental to what we do and provides 
the opportunity to differentiate ourselves in our customers’ eyes. 
Employee safety is our number one priority and our performance 
is set out on page 54. In general 2014 saw a good reduction in the 
number of accidents. However, in February 2014 an employee at GKN 
Aerospace Engine Systems’ El Cajon plant in the US suffered a fatal 
injury whilst operating a forklift truck. I deeply regret this loss of life 
and we have provided support to the employee’s family. Lessons 
have been learned from this and applied elsewhere in the Group.
Across the Group, the GKN Lean manufacturing programme enables 
us to continue to drive continuous improvement in manufacturing 
performance and back-office processes.
Listening to the ‘Voice of the Customer’ in a direct way is vital to our 
success. During 2014 we have implemented improved processes 
to ensure all employees keep their eyes focused on our customers’ 
own ratings of us, understand any concerns and work speedily and 
determinedly to resolve them. Although customers’ views have 
always been important in GKN, I am confident the positive effect of 
this direct feedback will prove an advantage in building our business.
Together the successful delivery of these four strategic objectives 
helped deliver the fifth strategic objective of sustaining above 
market growth. In 2014 overall Group sales showed an organic 
increase of 4%, better than average for our markets.
Chief Executive’s review
Doing the right thing 
Underpinning these results is a strong set of GKN Values. We 
call this ‘doing the right thing’ and the effects of this are set out 
in the sustainability report on pages 52-59. At our 2014 internal 
International Leadership Conference, considerable time was spent 
discussing how GKN’s most senior people should demonstrate our 
Group Values.
Supporting this we have introduced new processes for clarifying 
to managers what is expected of them and getting their 
acknowledgment they understand this. In the months ahead we will 
be running a process of re-communicating the GKN Code to every 
employee wherever they are and no matter which of the 27 Group-
wide languages they speak.
Summary
The continued implementation of our strategy in 2014 delivered 
organic growth, improved margins and increased ROIC, together 
bringing increased financial returns to our shareholders. This 
could not have been achieved without the expertise, focus and 
sheer hard work of the 51,400 committed GKN people around the 
world. In closing, I would like to thank everyone in the GKN team 
for their contribution this year. I would also like to thank my former 
colleagues Marcus Bryson CBE and Bill Seeger for their support and 
contribution as members of my Executive team and the Board.
“ The continued implementation of our strategy in 2014

ROIC, together bringing increased financial returns to our 
shareholders.” Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
19 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
Looking ahead
Commercial aircraft production should continue to be strong 
whereas military markets are forecast to decline. GKN Aerospace’s 
2015 organic sales are expected to be broadly flat, reflecting these 
differing trends and the phasing of our programmes. However, a 
strong commercial order book supports attractive growth for GKN 
Aerospace over the medium term.
In automotive, external forecasts predict growth in global light 
vehicle production of around 2% with increases in China and North 
America, and Europe flat. Against this background, GKN Driveline 
and GKN Powder Metallurgy are expected to continue to grow 
organically above the market.
Softer global agricultural equipment markets are likely to more than 
offset the slight improvement in industrial markets. As a result,  
GKN Land Systems 2015 sales are expected to be lower than 2014 
and an £8 million restructuring charge is planned to further reduce 
the fixed cost base. 
Although some markets remain challenging, 2015 is expected to 
be a year of further growth. Beyond 2015, we are well positioned to 
outperform in our large global markets.

GKN DRIVELINE VIGO
Operational excellence founded on Lean manufacturing is a focus for 
GKN sites across the world. This culture of continuous improvement 
enables GKN to deliver quality products and exceptional customer 
service, and GKN Driveline in Vigo, Northern Spain, is one example  
of a site that has seen significant operational improvements in  
recent years. 
The plant, which supplies sideshafts to European automotive 
manufacturers, has implemented a system to reduce waste and 
optimise productivity, created tools for the sharing of knowledge 
and ideas and provided Lean training for all employees. Maximising 
employee involvement, both in the office and on the shop floor, has 
been fundamental in engaging the teams and developing the change 
in culture. 
The site has been recognised by the KAIZEN Institute, a global 
organisation that specialises in the continuous improvement of 
people, processes and systems, winning one of its 2014 awards.

Organic sales increased by £303 million (4%). The adverse  
effect of currency translation on management sales was  
£403 million (5%) and there was a £7 million benefit from 
acquisitions which was more than offset by a £45 million  
reduction due to disposals. 
Organic trading profit increased £66 million, due to the absence  
of restructuring costs (2013: £25 million), the strong performance 
of three of our divisions, lower profits from GKN Land Systems and 
£6 million net benefit from commercial settlements and provision 
releases. Adverse currency translation was £38 million and there 
was a £2 million reduction due to acquisitions and divestments. 
Group trading margin increased to 9.2% (2013: 8.7% or 9.0% 
excluding restructuring charges). Return on average invested 
capital (ROIC) increased to 17.7% (2013: 17.3%).
Basis of reporting
In this report, financial information, unless otherwise stated,  
is presented on a management basis, the definition of which is 
below. The Group uses management measures, which are non-
GAAP measures, to assess operating performance on a consistent 
basis, as we believe this gives a fairer assessment of the underlying 
performance of the business.
The use of management measures allows the Group to chart 
progress, make decisions and allocate resources based on the 
actions for which management is responsible or can influence, 
without volatility arising from significant one-time trading and 
portfolio change transactions or the mark to market valuation of 
currency hedges. 
Definitions 
Financial information, unless otherwise stated, is presented on a 
management basis which aggregates the sales and trading profit 
of subsidiaries (excluding certain subsidiary businesses sold and 
closed) with the Group’s share of the sales and trading profit of 
joint ventures. References to trading margins are to trading profit 
expressed as a percentage of sales. Management profit or loss 
before tax is management trading profit less net subsidiary interest 
payable and receivable and the Group’s share of net interest payable 
and receivable and taxation of joint ventures. These figures better 
reflect performance of continuing businesses. Where appropriate, 
reference is made to organic results which exclude the impact of 
acquisitions/divestments as well as currency translation on the 
results of overseas operations. Operating cash flow is cash generated 
from operations adjusted for capital expenditure, government capital 
grants, proceeds from disposal of fixed assets and government 
refundable advances. Free cash flow is operating cash flow including 
interest, tax, joint venture dividends, own shares purchased and 
amounts paid to non-controlling interests, but excluding dividends 
paid to GKN shareholders. Return on average invested capital (ROIC) 
is management trading profit as a percentage of average total net 
assets of continuing subsidiaries and joint ventures excluding  
current and deferred tax, net debt, post-employment obligations  
and derivative financial instruments.
Exchange rates 
Exchange rates used for currencies most relevant to the Group’s 
operations are:
Average Year end

Euro 1.24 1.18 1.29 1.20
US dollar 1.65 1.57 1.56 1.66
The approximate impact on 2014 trading profit of subsidiaries  
and joint ventures of a 1% movement in the average rate would  
be euro – £1 million, US dollar – £4 million. 22 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

SUSTAINING ABOVE MARKET GROWTH
KEVIN CUMMINGS
Chief Executive GKN Aerospace
The overall aerospace market remained positive in 2014 driven by  
a growing commercial aircraft market partly offset by a declining 
military market. The division’s commercial sales were 73%, with 
military representing 27%. 
Commercial aircraft production is still growing. Both Airbus and Boeing 
continue to benefit from higher deliveries and a record order backlog, 
and both have announced plans to increase production levels for single 
aisle aircraft in the future. There is also more demand for strong global 
suppliers to support their expansion plans.
Military spending remains under pressure, largely driven by cutbacks 
throughout the US and Europe, with the ramp-up of new programmes 
being delayed and overseas military operations reduced.

GKN AEROSPACE
GKN Aerospace is helping lead the way in wing design for future 
aircraft. It is participating in a number of UK research programmes 
focused on using new manufacturing technologies and more cost 
effective processes to create lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft.
Together with industrial partners, research institutions and the UK 
Government, GKN Aerospace is working to develop and demonstrate 
new manufacturing techniques that will enable the UK aerospace 
industry to build wings for tomorrow’s aircraft. 
It is focusing on creating a new generation of automated processes 
and technologies that will extend the boundaries of what we are 
able to manufacture, while at the same time increasing the quality, 
consistency and speed of production. 
The key financial results for the year are as follows:
GKN Aerospace
Change (%)
2014 2013 Headline Organic
Sales (£m) 2,226 2,243 (1) 3
Trading profit (£m) 277 266 4 7
Trading margin 12.4% 11.9% 
Return on average 
invested capital 17.7% 17 .8% 
Overall, GKN Aerospace’s organic sales were £59 million higher (3%). 
There was an adverse £76 million (3%) impact from currency translation. 
Organic commercial aerospace sales were 4% higher, driven by 
increased demand for the Boeing 787 , A350 and engine spares, partly 
offset by lower A330 and A380 sales and a £17 million reduction due to 
the previously announced supply chain contract taken back in-house 
by Airbus in May 2013. Military sales were broadly flat as spares on 
programmes which ceased production were offset by lower sales for 
F/A-18 Super Hornet and UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter. 
The organic increase in trading profit was £18 million, the impact from 
currency on translation of results was £10 million adverse (4%) and 
there was a £3 million benefit relating to losses from the Composite 
Technology and Applications Limited (CTAL) disposal in 2013. 
Each year there are commercial issues and provision movements 
which impact the results. This year they amounted to a £4 million 
net benefit, which included a credit of £11 million as progress was 
made on an onerous contract partly offset by a £7 million charge for 
customer claims. Trading profit also included income of £8 million 
(2013: £5 million) for milestones achieved in relation to CTAL, which 
is not expected to be repeated in 2015. 
Other factors included improved commercial spares sales and 
higher volumes on new programmes offset by lower military sales 
on mature programmes. Further start-up operating losses at the 
new A350 facility were £8 million (2013: loss of £11 million).  
Trading margin was 12.4% (2013: 11.9%). 
Return on average invested capital was 17.7% (2013: 17.8%), 
following the repayment of a Government advance in the first half 
of the year.
 
During the year a number of important milestones were achieved 
including: 
• a new 7% (US$2.5 billion) risk and revenue sharing partnership 
(RRSP) with Pratt & Whitney covering the supply of components  
for the PurePower PW1900 Geared Turbofan™ engine for the  
Embraer 190 and the 195-E2 narrow body aircraft; 
• a long term agreement (LTA) worth more than US$200 million with 
Rolls-Royce to supply components for the latest version of the 
Trent 1000 engine, a capability enhancement of the existing Trent 
1000 engine for the Boeing 787; 
• a contract from Boeing for the final assembly and paint of 
Advanced Technology (AT) Winglets for the new 737 MAX; 
• investment and work being transferred into our low cost 
manufacturing facilities in Mexico; and
• leading collaborative projects backed by the UK’s Aerospace 
Technology Institute for additive manufacturing and future  
wing research. 26 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

The market for electric and hybrid vehicles is growing and consumers 
are increasingly looking for dynamic performance, not just exceptional 
fuel efficiency and low CO
2
 emissions.
GKN Driveline has developed the industry’s first two-speed eAxle, 
which delivers electric power throughout a vehicle’s entire speed 
range. Optimised for weight, packaging and efficiency, the two-speed 
eAxle supports effective hybridisation, contributing to an outstanding 
driving experience.
The technology features on the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid sports car, a 
vehicle that is changing the perception of hybrid vehicles. Working 
closely with BMW, GKN drew on the expertise and knowledge of its 
global engineering network to deliver the project from concept to 
production in just 24 months.

Organic sales increased by £265 million (8%) compared with global 
vehicle production which was up 3%. The adverse effect of 
currency translation was £226 million (7%) and the impact from 
disposals was £11 million, being the proportionate loss of sales 
from a wholly-owned business in China which was transferred into 
our Shanghai GKN HUAYU Driveline Systems Co Limited (SDS) joint 
venture in November 2013. Constant velocity jointed (CVJ) systems 
accounted for 60% of sales and non-CVJ sales were 40%. 
GKN Driveline’s market outperformance was broadly based across  
the main markets reflecting recent market share gains, a stronger 
position in premium vehicles, demand for which continued to be 
good, and GKN Driveline’s broadening product mix, particularly 
with all-wheel drive (AWD) systems. GKN Driveline slightly 
underperformed the market in Japan due to our specific  
programme mix. 
The organic improvement in trading profit was £53 million, 
including the absence of £16 million of restructuring charges 
reported in 2013. The adverse impact of currency translation on 
trading profit was £18 million (8%). Each year there are commercial 
settlements and provision movements which impact the results.  
In 2014, whilst individually larger than usual, they amounted to  
a £2 million net benefit. This £2 million included a commercial 
settlement credit of £14 million and a credit of £5 million as 
progress was made on an onerous contract, partly offset by a 
higher than usual £17 million charge for warranty and quality 
claims. GKN Driveline’s trading margin was 8.1% (2013: 7.2%, or 
7.7% excluding restructuring charges), reflecting higher organic 
revenue growth. 
Return on average invested capital increased to 19.3% (2013: 17 .0%). 
During the year, over £700 million of annualised sales in new and 
replacement business was secured in CVJ and AWD systems and a 
number of important milestones were achieved, including:
• expanding facilities in Mexico and AWD capacity in Newton, US;  
• expanding facilities in China with new Power Transfer Unit (PTU) 
wins and localisation of AWD products from Europe and  
North America;
• design and launch of the world’s first integrated disconnect AWD 
system for Fiat Chrysler’s small SUV platform;
• eAxle new launches on advanced plug-in hybrid supercars, with 
the world’s first two-speed eTransmission on the BMW i8 and 
Porsche awarding GKN Driveline ‘Technology Partner’ status for its 
development of a high-performance eAxle for the 918 Spyder; and
• 11 customer awards, including from Ford, General Motors, 
Mitsubishi, Nissan and Volvo. 30 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Organic sales at GKN Powder Metallurgy were £40 million higher 
(5%). There was an adverse £56 million (6%) impact from currency 
translation. Good growth was achieved in North America,  
China and Europe but sales in South America fell due to weaker 
automotive and industrial markets. 
The organic increase in profit was £13 million, including the 
absence of £5 million of restructuring charges reported in 2013. 
The impact of currency translation was £6 million adverse (7%). 
The divisional trading margin was 11.0% (2013: 10.1%, or 10.6% 
excluding restructuring charges), reflecting the move towards 
higher value ‘Design for Powder Metallurgy’ parts. 
Return on average invested capital was 21.8% (2013: 21.1%), 
reflecting the improvement in profitability. 
GKN Powder Metallurgy continued its strong product and 
development activities in engines and transmissions, being 
awarded £165 million of annualised sales in new and replacement 
business. It also won a number of quality awards including: 
Excellent Supplier Award and Zero PPM 2014 Award from GETRAG 
(Jiangxi) Transmission Co., Ltd.; and four Supplier Quality 
Excellence awards from General Motors.
Reflecting our move into more advanced applications of powder 
metal technologies, GKN Powder Metallurgy is expanding its 
facilities in North America with more complex and efficient tooling 
and presses. It has signalled its commitment to the Chinese  
market with the expansion of its two production facilities there  
and also announced a technology collaboration agreement with 
McPhy Energy to develop solid state hydrogen storage solutions. 
During the year, Hoeganaes made progress in the development  
and commercialisation of high technology powders for additive 
manufacturing. For example, highly alloyed tool steels, nickel 
based alloys and specialised stainless steel powders have been 
developed and the first commercial shipments made. Early 
development work also progressed on titanium powders for 
additive manufacturing. A new research titanium atomizer is 
currently being installed at the Powder Innovation Centre in the  
US and will be commissioned during the first half of 2015.

GKN POWDER METALLURGY
GKN Powder Metallurgy has worked with a global machine 
manufacturer to develop and build a new type of press to improve 
manufacturing efficiency and deliver increased value to its customers.
The advanced compaction presses enable GKN Powder Metallurgy to 
manufacture more complex parts, at a higher speed, with improved 
quality and cost effectiveness. This is especially important when 
applying a ‘Design for Powder Metallurgy’ approach, which requires 
specialist production techniques to cater for the freedom of design 
the process allows. 
The first of these presses in North America was installed at GKN Powder 
Metallurgy, St Mary’s, Pennsylvania, during 2014 to support the product 
launch of a complex gear for an electronic parking brake system. The 
presses are already in use in Europe and Asia, and are now being rolled 
out at a number of GKN Powder Metallurgy plants in North America.

The organic decrease in sales was £84 million (10%) and the 
adverse impact of currency translation was £40 million (5%).  
The organic decrease in sales included £14 million due to the 
previously announced cessation of two chassis contracts in the 
second half of 2013. The acquisition impact of £1 million related  
to our wheels venture in China. 
The organic decrease in trading profit was £27 million, including 
the absence of £3 million of restructuring charges in 2013.  
The negative impact of currency translation was £4 million (6%). 
Trading margin was 5.7% (2013: 8.3%, or 8.7% excluding 
restructuring charges). In 2015, there is expected to be an  
£8 million restructuring charge reflecting actions being taken  
to further reduce the fixed cost base in response to difficult  
market conditions.
Return on average invested capital was 11.4% (2013: 18.3%).
Good progress was made towards winning new business and 
implementing the GKN Land Systems strategy through broadening 
its product offering and geographic footprint, particularly investing 
to support industrial product sales in North America and enhancing 
capacity in China.

GKN LAND SYSTEMS
GKN Land Systems’ Armstrong facility in Iowa, US, manufactures 
wheels for agricultural vehicles in close proximity to key OEMs in 
North America. Substantial investment to replace key components of 
its main rim rolling line has significantly improved its ability to both 
serve its existing customers and attract new customers.
The new technology means the Armstrong facility can now produce 
larger wheels and deliver a 40% increase in production speed, 
improved quality through greater consistency and tighter tolerances, 
and reduced changeover times. These benefits have added value for 
customers and mean that GKN Land Systems has widened its product 
portfolio so it can better serve the North American agricultural market.
Business review / Other Businesses
GKN’s Other Businesses comprise Cylinder Liners (which is a 59% 
owned venture mainly in China, manufacturing engine liners for the 
truck market in the US, Europe and China), our joint venture stake 
in EVO Electric (a developer of axial flux motors) and the activities 
relating to GKN Hybrid Power, acquired on 1 April 2014 from 
Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited. Since the acquisition, 
GKN Hybrid Power has secured orders to fit 750 buses with its 
innovative fuel-saving solution. 
GKN sold its 50% stake in Emitec for a cash consideration of  
£37 million on 31 July 2014. 
GKN’s Other Businesses reported combined sales in the year of  
£94 million (2013: £104 million), reflecting a £23 million organic 
increase in sales and a £6 million benefit from acquisitions, more 
than offset by the £34 million impact from disposals and the  
£5 million adverse currency translation. Trading profit was  
£5 million (2013: £5 million). 38 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
STRATEGIC REPORT
Business review / Other financial information
Corporate costs
Corporate costs, which comprise the costs of stewardship  
of the Group and operating charges and credits associated  
with the Group’s legacy businesses, were £20 million  
(2013: £25 million), primarily due to a lower charge in relation  
to future incentive schemes.
Items excluded from management trading profit
In order to achieve consistency and comparability between 
reporting periods, the following items are excluded from 
management measures as they do not reflect trading activity:  
Change in value of derivative and other financial 
instruments 
The change in value of derivative and other financial instruments 
during the year resulted in a loss of £209 million (2013: profit of 
£26 million).
When the business wins long term customer contracts that are in  
a foreign currency, the Group offsets the potential volatility of the 
future cash flows by hedging through forward foreign exchange 
contracts. At each period end, the Group is required to mark to 
market these contracts even though it has no intention of closing 
them out in advance of their maturity dates. 
At 31 December 2014, the net fair value of such instruments  
was a liability of £180 million (2013: asset of £52 million) and the 
change in fair value during the year was a £232 million charge 
(2013: £19 million credit). 
There was also a £4 million credit arising from the change in the 
fair value of embedded derivatives in the year (2013: £4 million 
charge) and a net gain of £19 million attributable to the currency 
impact on Group funding balances (2013: £11 million net gain). 
Amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising 
on business combinations 
The charge for the amortisation of non-operating intangible  
assets arising on business combinations (for example, customer 
contracts, order backlog, technology and intellectual property 
rights) was £69 million (2013: £75 million).
Gains and losses on changes in Group structure
The net gain on changes in Group structure was £24 million  
(2013: £12 million).
On 31 July 2014, the Group sold its 50% share in Emitec,  
a joint venture company, for a cash consideration of £37 million.  
The carrying value on the date of disposal was £14 million and  
£1 million of previous currency variations were reclassified  
from other reserves resulting in a profit on sale of £24 million.
Impairment charges
Consistent with previous years, goodwill was tested for 
impairment. As a result of difficult markets and reduced sales  
of certain products during the year, an impairment charge of  
£69 million (2013: nil) has been recorded in respect of three cash 
generating units; two in Aerospace and one in Land Systems. 
Additionally, an impairment charge has been recorded against  
the carrying value of an investment balance of £4 million in  
Other Businesses.
Post-tax earnings of joint ventures
On a management basis, the sales and trading profits of joint 
ventures are included pro rata in the individual divisions to which 
they relate, although shown separately post-tax in the statutory 
income statement. 
The Group’s share of post-tax earnings on a management basis 
were £62 million (2013: £54 million), with trading profit of  
£75 million (2013: £64 million). The Group’s share of the tax  
and interest charges amounted to £13 million (2013: £10 million). 
Underlying trading profit increased by £13 million, reflecting a 
strong trading performance by our joint venture companies, 
primarily in China.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs totalled £129 million (2013: £128 million) and 
comprise the net interest payable of £73 million (2013: £73 million), 
the non-cash charge on post-employment benefits of £50 million 
(2013: £45 million), fair value changes in net investment hedges  
of £3 million credit (2013: nil) and a charge for unwind of discounts  
of £9 million (2013: £10 million). The non-cash charge on post-
employment benefits, fair value changes in net investment hedges 
and unwind of discounts are not included in management figures. 
Details of the assumptions used in calculating post-employment 
costs are provided in note 24.
Interest payable was £75 million (2013: £76 million), whilst interest 
receivable was £2 million (2013: £3 million) resulting in net interest 
payable of £73 million (2013: £73 million).
Interest charged on Government refundable advances was  
£7 million (2013: £6 million). Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
39 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
Profit before tax 
Management profit before tax was £601 million (2013: £578 million). 
Profit before tax on a statutory basis was £221 million  
(2013: £484 million). The main differences between management 
and statutory figures are the change in value of derivative and other 
financial instruments, amortisation of non-operating intangible 
assets arising on business combinations, impairment charges,  
and the interest charge on net defined benefit pension plans. Further 
details are provided in note 3 to the financial statements.

Taxation
The book tax rate on management profits of subsidiaries  
was 22% (2013: 20%), arising as a £121 million tax charge  
(2013: £105 million) on management profits of subsidiaries  
of £539 million (2013: £524 million). The book tax rate is likely  
to increase at a similar rate in 2015. 
The Group’s theoretical weighted average tax rate, which assumes 
that book profits/losses are taxed at the statutory tax rates in the 
countries in which they arise, is 37% (2013: 34%). The book tax rate 
was significantly lower, largely because of the recognition of 
deferred tax assets (mainly in the US) due to increased confidence 
in the Group’s ability both to access the losses and realise future 
taxable profits that absorb brought forward tax deductions.
The cash tax rate was 13% (2013: 10%), primarily due to the 
utilisation of prior years’ tax losses. The cash tax rate is expected 
to be similar to the book tax rate in 2015. 
The tax rate on statutory profits of subsidiaries was 29%  
(2013: 18%) arising as a £47 million tax charge (2013: £77 million 
charge) on statutory profits of subsidiaries of £160 million  
(2013: £432 million).
Non-controlling interests 
The profit attributable to non-controlling interests was £5 million 
(2013: £12 million, including £8 million from the pension 
partnership arrangement).
Earnings per share
Management earnings per share was 29.0 pence (2013:  
28.7 pence). Average shares outstanding in 2014 were  
1,640.6 million (2013: 1,634.7 million).
On a statutory basis, earnings per share was 10.3 pence (2013:  
24.2 pence), lower primarily due to the loss on mark to market  
of foreign exchange hedging contracts and impairment charges.

Dividend
In view of the continued improvement in trading performance and 
taking into account the Group’s future prospects, the Board has 
decided to recommend a final dividend of 5.6 pence per share 
(2013: 5.3 pence per share). The total dividend for the year will, 
therefore, be 8.4 pence per share (2013: 7.9 pence per share).  
The Group’s objective is to have a progressive dividend policy 
reflecting growth in earnings per share and free cash flow 
generation. The final dividend is payable on 18 May 2015 to 
shareholders on the register at 10 April 2015. Shareholders may 
choose to use the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) to reinvest 
the final dividend. The closing date for receipt of new DRIP 
mandates is 24 April 2015. 40 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
STRATEGIC REPORT
Cash flow
Operating cash flow, which is defined as cash generated from 
operations of £765 million (2013: £782 million) adjusted for capital 
expenditure (net of proceeds from capital grants) of £403 million 
(2013: £349 million), proceeds from the disposal/realisation  
of fixed assets of £19 million (2013: £4 million) and repayment  
of the principal of a government refundable advance in the  
UK of £38 million (2013: nil) was an inflow of £343 million  
(2013: £437 million).
Within operating cash flow there was an outflow of working  
capital and provisions of £33 million (2013: £47 million outflow). 
Capital expenditure (net of proceeds from capital grants)  
on both tangible and intangible assets totalled £403 million  
(2013: £349 million). Of this, £328 million (2013: £273 million)  
was on tangible fixed assets and was 1.5 times (2013: 1.2 times)  
the depreciation charge, higher than the previous year due  
to additional investment in the automotive businesses in  
North America. Expenditure on intangible assets, mainly  
initial non-recurring costs on aerospace programmes, totalled  
£75 million (2013: £76 million).

Free cash flow
Free cash flow, which is operating cash flow including joint venture 
dividends and after interest, tax, amounts paid to non-controlling 
interests and own shares purchased, but before dividends paid to 
GKN shareholders, was an inflow of £234 million (2013: £346 million). 
The year-on-year change reflects increased capital expenditure of 
£54 million, repayment of a government refundable advance in  
the UK relating to the A350 programme of £54 million (including 
interest) and incremental pension funding of £12 million. 
Net debt
At the end of the year, the Group had net debt of £624 million 
(2013: £732 million) after payment of a government refundable 
advance (including accrued interest) of £54 million. In September 
2014, the Group entered into a series of cross currency interest  
rate swaps to better align its foreign currency income receipts  
with its debt coupon payments. The fair value of these derivative 
instruments at 31 December 2014 was a liability of £26 million 
which is included in the net debt figure of £624 million.

Pensions and post-employment obligations
GKN operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and 
historic retiree medical plans across the Group. 
At 31 December 2014, the total deficit on post-employment 
obligations of the Group totalled £1,711 million (2013:  
£1,271 million), comprising the deficits on funded obligations of 
£1,095 million (2013: £763 million) and on unfunded obligations  
of £616 million (2013: £508 million). The total deficit represents  
a £440 million increase since 31 December 2013 which is due 
primarily to significantly lower discount rates in all of the  
major territories where GKN operates post-retirement schemes.  
New US mortality assumptions have also contributed to the 
increase in the deficit, and these factors have been partly offset  
by strong asset performance. 
The amount included within trading profit for the period comprises 
current service cost of £49 million (2013: £51 million) and 
administrative costs of £3 million (2013: £3 million), offset by a 
settlement credit of £9 million. The settlement credit related to a 
Business review / Other financial information Financial Statements Other Information Governance Strategic Report
41 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014  
voluntary programme run in the US which offered deferred members 
the opportunity to take a cash lump sum in lieu of a future pension. 
Interest on net defined benefit plans, which is excluded from 
management figures, was £50 million (2013: £45 million).
Cash contributions to the various defined benefit pension  
schemes and retiree medical arrangements totalled £108 million 
(2013: £112 million). 
UK pensions
The accounting deficit for UK schemes increased to £1,005 million 
(2013: £714 million), due to the application of lower discount rates. 
Both UK pension schemes (GKN 1, a mature scheme, and GKN 2,  
with a larger active and deferred population) underwent funding 
valuations as at 5 April 2013 and final agreement was reached on 
the valuation and resulting deficit recovery plan for each scheme 
during the year. The agreed deficit recovery plan requires payments 
of £10 million per year and the potential for further additional 
payments commencing in 2016, contingent upon asset 
performance. The first payment of £10 million was made during the 
year. This is in addition to a £30 million (2013: £30 million) annual 
payment made under the Group’s pension partnership arrangement.
Early in the year, a bulk annuity pensioner 'buy-in' was completed 
in relation to the UK pension scheme, GKN 1, as a result of which a 
proportion (c.12%) of GKN 1 liabilities are now fully insured.  
The transaction involved a payment of £123 million, made from GKN 
1’s assets. This gave rise to an additional scheme funding requirement 
of £8 million which the Group will pay to GKN 1 over a four-year 
period. The first payment of £2 million was made during the year.
Defined contribution pension schemes
In addition to defined benefit pension schemes, the Group also 
operates a number of defined contribution schemes for which the 
income statement charge was £35 million (2013: £34 million).
Net assets
Net assets of £1,501 million were £294 million lower than the 
December 2013 year end figure of £1,795 million. The decrease 
includes management profit after tax of £480 million more than 
offset by dividends paid to equity shareholders of £133 million, 
currency on translation of subsidiaries and joint ventures net of  
tax and the change in value of derivative and other financial 
instruments of £182 million and a loss on remeasurement of 
defined benefit plans of £485 million.
Treasury management
All treasury activities are co-ordinated through a central function 
(Group Treasury), the purpose of which is to manage the financial 
risks of the Group and to secure short and long term funding at  
the minimum cost to the Group. It operates within a framework of 
clearly defined Board-approved policies and procedures, including 
permissible funding and hedging instruments, exposure limits  
and a system of authorities for the approval and execution  
of transactions. It operates on a cost centre basis and is not 
permitted to make use of financial instruments or other derivatives 
other than to hedge identified exposures of the Group. Speculative 
use of such instruments or derivatives is not permitted. Group 
Treasury prepares reports at least annually to the Board, and on a 
monthly basis to the Finance Director and other senior executives  
of the Group. In addition, liquidity, interest rate, currency and  
other financial risk exposures are monitored weekly. The overall 
indebtedness of the Group is reported on a weekly basis to the  
Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
Funding, liquidity and going concern
At 31 December 2014, UK committed bank facilities were  
£880 million. Within this amount there are committed revolving 
credit facilities of £800 million (31 December 2013: £837 million) 
and an £80 million eight-year amortising facility from the European 
Investment Bank (EIB). The revolving credit facilities of £800 million, 
renegotiated during the year, mature in 2019, whilst the first of  
five equal, annual £16 million EIB repayments falls due in 2015.  
At 31 December 2014, the £80 million EIB facility was fully drawn 
(2013: £80 million fully drawn) and there were no drawings on any 
of the UK revolving credit facilities (2013: no drawings). 
Capital market borrowings at 31 December 2014 comprised  
a £350 million 6.75% annual unsecured bond maturing in  
October 2019 and a £450 million 5.375% semi-annual unsecured 
bond maturing in September 2022.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had net debt of £624 million  
(31 December 2013: £732 million).
All of the Group’s committed credit facilities have financial 
covenants requiring EBITDA of subsidiaries to be at least 3.5 times 
net interest payable and for net debt to be no greater than 3 times 
EBITDA of subsidiaries. The covenants are tested every six months 
using the previous 12 months’ results. For the 12 months to  
31 December 2014, EBITDA was 11.8 times greater than net interest 
payable, whilst net debt was 0.7 times EBITDA.
The Group entered into a series of cross currency interest rate 
swaps during the year to better align its foreign currency income 
receipts in USD and EUR with its debt and had the effect of 
converting its Sterling bonds into US Dollars ($951 million) and 
Euros (€284 million). The cross currency interest rate swaps have 
been designated as a net investment hedge of the Group’s USD and 
EUR net assets. The fair value of the cross currency interest rate 
swaps at 31 December 2014 was a liability of £26 million (2013: nil).
The Directors have taken into account both divisional and Group 
forecasts for the 18 months from the balance sheet date to assess 
the future funding requirements of the Group and compared them 
to the level of committed available borrowing facilities, described 
above. The Directors have concluded that the Group will have a 
sufficient level of headroom in the foreseeable future and that the 
likelihood of breaching covenants in this period is remote, such 
that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on 
a going concern basis.

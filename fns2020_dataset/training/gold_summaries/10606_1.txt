CHIEF	ExECUTIVE’S	REVIEW
reVieW OF OperatiOnS 
The	 Group	 has	 continued	 to	 make	 good	 progress	 through	 the	 year.	 A	 focus	 on	 brand	 development,	 product,	
operational	delivery	and	cost	control	has	enabled	us	to	grow	profits	ahead	of	market	expectations.	
MULTI-CHANNEL PROJECT
Our	previously	stated	project	to	implement	a	multi-channel	shopping	environment	for	our	customers	is	
nearing	completion.	The	new	Hire	website,	launched	in	November	2013,	marked	the	introduction	of	a	
single	customer	database	across	stores	and	on-line,	including	full	transaction	history	for	customers.	Our	
retail stores and websites will also be incorporated into multi-channel during 2014. Once completed this 
will	enable	customers	to	shop	for	retail	and	hire	across	a	range	of	channels	(in-store,	PC,	tablet,	mobile).	
Once	full	multi-channel	capability	is	in	place,	we	will	leverage	our	new	single	customer	database	using	
customer relationship management software tools so that we can focus customer communications on 
propositions that are relevant and appealing. An option for customers to receive their in store customer 
receipt	via	email	will	also	be	introduced.	As	well	as	improving	customer	convenience,	we	anticipate	that	
this	will	significantly	increase	email	collection	rates	and	therefore	associated	marketing	opportunities.	
RETAIL
We	have	continued	to	implement	operational	improvements	across	the	business,	continuing	our	
programme of streamlining the product range through stock management initiatives. These actions 
impacted	positively	on	the	like-for-like*	sales,	which	were	up	by	6.4%	on	the	previous	year	(2012/13:	4.1%).	
Christmas trading in particular was above expectations and year end residual stock levels were lower than 
in the previous year.
The gross margin performance was enhanced by consolidation into fewer suppliers and the gradual move 
to direct supply from the Far East.
We	opened	two	new	stores	in	the	UK	in	the	year,	as	planned,	and	closed	five	loss	making	stores.	We	are	
looking at a number of new store opening opportunities in the UK in the next 12 months. The Group now 
trades from 133 stores.
The	inherent	flexibility	in	our	property	estate	gives	us	options	in	what	we	anticipate	will	be	a	fast	changing	
retail	landscape.	43%	of	our	property	leases	are	due	for	renewal	within	the	next	36	months	and	the	
average lease length across the store portfolio is 53 months. There will be opportunities to improve terms 
on renewal in some cases. Unlike many high street retailers who are looking to actively reduce their 
store 	 footprint, 	 the 	 underpinning 	 of 	 Hire 	 and 	 the 	 demand 	 for 	 e-commerce 	 ‘click 	 & 	 collect’ 	 and 	 ‘click 
& 	 r e t u r n ’ 	points,	together	with	advantageous	lease	deals,	means	there	is	an	opportunity	to	expand	our	
store	footprint	on	a	selective	and	cost	effective	basis,	with	good	returns.
HIRE
As	reported	in	the	media	2013	was	a	difficult	year	for	the	wedding	hire	market.	This	may	have	been	due,	
in	part,	to	the	widely	reported	‘2013	effect’	of	customers	avoiding	an	unlucky	year,	although	there	is	no	
conclusive evidence of this. 
Overall	like-for-like	Hire	sales	fell	by	6.4%	in	the	year,	the	first	decline	for	a	number	of	years.	The	shortfall	
was	however	confined	to	weddings,	down	9.5%,	with	eveningwear,	Royal	Ascot	and	school	proms	up	3.2%.
We	are	confident	our	position	as	the	leading	hire	brand	will	be	maintained	through	the	product	and	
technology initiatives currently underway.

E-COMMERCE
Mossbros.co.uk	performed	very	strongly,	with	the	rate	of	sales	growth	accelerating	to	209%	up	on	the	
previous	year.	Online	sales	now	comprise	5.1%	of	total	sales	(2012/13:	1.7%).	A	new	retail	platform	was	
launched	in	January	2013,	including	nationwide	‘click	and	collect,’	and	has	seen	a	50%	improvement	in	
the buying conversion rate from visitors to the site since launch. The addition of a mobile enabled website 
in	May	2013	has	had	an	immediate	impact	on	enhancing	our	customer	offer.	Site	traffic,	conversion	and	
retention	rates	are	all	on	improving	trends	and	the	returns	rate	is	steady	at	20%.	E-commerce	has	also	
proved	to	be	a	very	efficient	means	of	clearing	end	of	lines	stock	with	faster	sell	through	rates	and	an	
improvement in prices achieved.
Expansion	into	international	markets	is	underway	with	dedicated	sites	launched	for	Eire,	Sweden,	
Denmark and Netherlands. Further territories are planned for 2014/15. 
E-commerce	will	play	a	key	role	in	maximising	the	benefits	to	be	derived	from	the	capability	to	trade	in	a	
fully multi-channel environment.
SUPPLY	CHAIN	AND	COSTS
The	earlier	clearance	of	residual	stocks	has	allowed	new	seasons	stock	to	be	introduced	to	stores	earlier,	
improving the customer offer and allowing much greater scope for tactical promotions. 
The increase in direct sourcing of stock from the Far East has increased our exposure to foreign exchange 
risk which is mitigated by the adoption of hedging.
PEOPLE
Investment	in	staff	training	in	the	form	of	recruitment,	induction,	performance	appraisal	and	performance	
management continues with a wider range of courses available and increased numbers of staff being 
trained.	Our	customer	insight	project	confirmed	that	excellent	customer	service	is	vitally	important	to	our	
customers,	particularly	given	our	intended	implementation	of	a	multi-channel	shopping	environment.	We	
have	strengthened	our	central	operations,	marketing,	e-commerce	and	merchandising	teams	in	2013.
Financial reVieW
The	improvement	across	the	business	continued	in	2013/14	with	good	like-for-like*	sales	growth	and	
continued	control	over	costs.	Underlying***	profit	before	taxation	and	exceptional	items	on	continuing	
operations	 was	 £4.4m,	 compared	 with	 a	 profit	 of	 £3.0m	 in	 the	 previous	 year,	 an	 increase	 of	 £1.4m	 including	
a	 net	 £0.4m	 credit	 in	 respect	 of	 provisions	 for	 onerous	 property	 lease	 contracts	 (2012/13:	 net	 £0.3m	 credit).
REVENUE
Despite	the	shortfall	on	Hire,	overall	revenue	was	up	4.3%	(up	4.2%	like-for-like*)	on	the	previous	year	to	
£109.1m.	Retail	was	up	6.2%	(up	6.4%	like-for-like*)	on	the	previous	year.	As	reported,	Hire	had	a	difficult	
year	and	was	down	4.7%	(down	6.4%	like-for-like*)	on	the	previous	year.	
GROSS MARGIN
Underlying***	gross	margin	decreased	by	60	basis	points	in	the	year	(59.0%	vs	59.6%),	due	in	part	to	the	
lower	participation	of	Hire,	which	is	higher	margin,	in	the	overall	sales	mix.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic	earnings	per	share,	on	underlying	earnings	(where	underlying	represents	results	before	exceptional	
items	as	defined	in	note	1	of	the	Financial	Statements)	was	3.76	pence	compared	to	2.33	pence	per	share	
last	year.	Diluted	earnings	per	share,	on	underlying	earnings,	was	3.53	pence	compared	to	2.23	pence	per	
share last year.

Basic earnings per share on total earnings was 3.76 pence compared to 2.52 pence per share last year. 
Diluted	earnings	per	share,	on	total	earnings,	was	3.53	pence	compared	to	2.42	pence	per	share	last	year.
DIVIDEND
As	announced	on	14	January	2014,	given	the	strong	progress	made	in	2013/14	and	the	ongoing	cash	
generation	the	Board	feels	it	is	appropriate	to	propose	the	payment	of	a	final	dividend	of	4.7p	per	share	
(2012/13:	0.7	pence)	bringing	the	total	for	the	year	to	5.0p	per	share.	This	compares	with	0.9	pence	
per	share	for	the	year	ended	26	January	2013.	The	final	dividend	is	to	be	paid	on	26	June	2014	to	all	
shareholders	on	the	register	as	at	6	June	2014	(ex	dividend	date	4	June	2014).	
INVESTMENT
Total	capital	expenditure	in	the	year	was	£6.1m	(2012/13:	£5.5m)	and	depreciation	and	amortisation	was	
£4.9m	(2012/13:	£4.5m).	This	included	the	opening	of	two	new	stores	and	the	refurbishment	of	13	stores.	
The	total	capital	expenditure	included	further	investment	in	new	Moss	Bros	Hire	inventory	of	£1.6m	
(2012/13:	£1.4m),	whilst	depreciation	on	hire	inventory	was	£0.8m	(2012/13:	£0.9m).
CASH	AND	LIQUIDITY
The	year	end	cash	balance	was	£28.3m	compared	to	£25.7m	last	year.
INVENTORY
The	mix	of	inventory	in	the	business	was	re-geared	during	the	year	to	ensure	sufficient	inventory	is	
available to support sales across the business and as a consequence residual stocks at the year end were 
£0.3m	lower	than	the	previous	year.	
TRADE	AND	OTHER	PAYABLES
The	terms	and	conditions	with	our	suppliers	are	reviewed	and	adjusted	so	as	to	maximise	the	average	
cash	balance,	whilst	improving	the	product	gross	margin.
Future deVelOpMentS
The	Board	believes	Moss	Bros	has	an	exciting	future,	with	the	growth	of	e-commerce	underpinning	the	
move	to	multi-channel	retailing	in	2014/15.	The	adoption	of	Moss	Bros	as	the	master	brand,	supported	
by complementary sub-brands and introduction of carefully targeted marketing activity to maximise 
opportunities	to	grow	our	business	amongst	target	customers	represents	a	significant	opportunity. 
The	introduction	of	customer	relationship	management	(“CRM”)	following	the	full	implementation	of 
multi-channel in 2014/15 and the ongoing store refurbishment programme will further enhance the 
customer experience and perceptions of the brand. 
The	customer	insight	project,	undertaken	in	2013	revealed	significant	potential	for	the	Moss	Bros	brand.	
Although	Moss	Bros	is	seen	as	having	strong	heritage	and	suiting	expertise,	it	is	still	overwhelmingly	best	
known	as	a	hire	brand.	The	majority	of	men	do	not	initially	think	of	Moss	Bros	for	suit	purchase	and	many	
are	unaware	of	the	strength	of	our	3rd	party	brand	offering.	We	have	identified	the	key	drivers	of	our	brand	
and will implement a new annual brand tracking survey to monitor our progress against these critical 
factors.
There	is	clearly	an	opportunity	to	improve	our	profile	amongst	potential	retail	customers	and	we	plan	to	
develop and implement an improved marketing strategy to deliver this. “Moss Bros” is to be adopted as 
the	master	brand,	in	place	of	“Moss”,	and	our	sub-brands	(Ventuno,	Blazer	and	Dehavilland)	are	to	be	
re-aligned,	with	launch	planned	for	Autumn	2014.	“Moss	London”	will	replace	Ventuno,	“Moss	Esq.”	will	
replace	Dehavilland	and	“Moss	1851”	will	replace	Blazer.
Carefully targeted marketing activities will be introduced to support this initiative. 10 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

RETAIL
As	well	as	improving	the	brand	positioning	and	product	offering,	the	team	continues	the	project	to	
modernise	the	look	and	feel	of	core	Moss	Bros	stores.	We	now	have	36	‘new	look’	stores,	including	new	
store	openings,	relocations	or	refits.	The	wider	implementation	programme	is	being	prioritised	and	
coordinated to coincide with lease renewals so as to secure the best possible terms before committing 
expenditure.	We	are	planning	28	refits	in	2014/15.
HIRE
We will continue to leverage the opportunities to grow our market share through new distribution channels 
including	the	new	transactional	internet	site,	launched	in	November	2013,	which	marked	our	entry	into	
multi-channel,	and	which	has	seen	traffic	levels	above	expectations.	We	will	also	exploit	new	markets	and	
the continued growth of the School Proms hire market is very encouraging. New product areas such as the 
Ted	Baker	morning	suit,	launched	in	May	2013,	and	continued	investment	in	hire	stock	bodes	well	for	the	
future. 
Early	 season	 wedding	 bookings	 for	 2014	 have	 stabilised	 with	 like-for-like*	 sales	 down	 1.2%	 (after	 adjusting	
for	the	Easter	2013	effect)	and	the	month	of	March	has	seen	an	upturn	in	bookings	compared	to	last	year.	
It is too early to say if this upturn will be sustained but the business is in excellent shape to build market 
share.
Moss	Hire	also	offers	one	of	the	most	significant	opportunities	to	develop	our	customer	offering	by	
leveraging	the	rich	source	of	customer	data,	many	of	whom	are	currently	unaware	of,	or	do	not	consider	
the	Moss	Retail	offer.	We	believe	the	opportunities	for	CRM,	in	the	context	of	a	multi-channel	offer,	are	
significant.
E-COMMERCE
We plan to further exploit growth opportunities both in the UK and overseas through building on our 
success and leveraging the advantages that full multi-channel capability will bring. Additional websites for 
overseas markets are planned. 
SUPPLY	CHAIN	&	COSTS
Our	supply	chain	continues	to	be	of	significant	importance	in	delivering	service	and	efficiencies.	
We anticipate central costs will increase in line with turnover in 2014/15 as we increase our investment in 
marketing and our multi-channel capability.
Capital	expenditure	for	2014/15	is	estimated	at	£9.2m,	including	£5.6m	for	28	store	refits.	
INFRASTRUCTURE
Plans	are	in	place	to	upgrade	our	Point	of	Sale,	Stock	Control	and	DC	systems	in	2014/15.	Risk	has	been	
mitigated	through	upgrading	existing	systems,	rather	than	wholesale	replacement.	The	upgrade	is	largely	
cost neutral with lower annual maintenance costs offsetting higher depreciation charges. The upgrade 
project	will	involve	capital	expenditure	of	£0.8m	in	2014/15.	Additional	one	off	revenue	costs	of	£0.2m	will	
be incurred in 2014/15 and 2015/16 during the implementation period.
As	well	as	introducing	latest	technology,	the	upgrade	will	improve	business	efficiency	and	customer	
experience.
With	the	introduction	of	multichannel,	growth	of	e-commerce	and	shortening	of	product	lead	times	the	
efficiency	of	the	Distribution	Centre	is	central	to	our	ability	to	serve	our	customers.	The	investment	in	IT	in	
2014/15	will	underpin	the	operational	efficiencies	introduced	in	2013	and	enable	further	improvements	to	
be made.

OutlOOK
These	results	reflect	another	period	of	good	progress	for	the	Company.	
We continue to make good progress in the delivery of our strategic priorities. The modernisation of the 
store portfolio is achieving the anticipated returns and our plans for the implementation of a multi-channel  
shopping environment are on track. The decision to return to the master brand “Moss Bros” was supported  
by strong and compelling feedback from our customer insight programme and we look forward to the 
realignment and launch of our sub-brands in Autumn 2014. This research is helping us to prioritise how 
best to leverage the resonance the brand has with current and potential customers of all age groups.
Hire,	having	had	a	difficult	2013	for	wedding	related	hire,	is	showing	some	signs	of	some	recovery	and 
we are well placed to maximise revenues in the 2014 Wedding season. The early response to the 2014 
Spring/Summer	retail	range	is	positive,	with	retail	like-for-like*	sales	continuing	to	improve	year	on	year	
as we move out of the winter clearance activity. 
The	Group’s	trading	performance	continues	positively,	in	line	with	the	Board’s	expectations.

In the short time I have been working 
with the senior team at JKX, I have 
been impressed by the management 
skills and operational potential in 
evidence. When I was approached to 
consider the role of Chairman of JKX 
following some 12 years on the 
Board at BP, I was attracted to the 
position because the company 
operates in a challenging area of the 
oil and gas sector, and one where I 
feel I can use my own experience 
and expertise to good effect. In 
addition to my time at BP, I have also 
established in the FTSE 250 index. 
I know from conversations with 
senior management what a 
tremendous contribution Lord 
Fraser made, chairing the JKX 
Board with intelligence and great 
commitment. On behalf of the 
Board I thank him unreservedly.
Dividend
In a period of heavy investment, the 
Board recognises that increased 
taxation in Ukraine and delay in 
start-up of the Russian project 
inevitably impacts available cash flow. 
Consequently, the Board is 
recommending a final dividend of 2.6 
pence per share, giving an unchanged 
total dividend for the year of 5.0 pence 
per share. The dividend will be paid 
on 24th June 2011 to shareholders on 
the Company’s Register of Members 
on 6th May 2011. 
Outlook
The Company is budgeting a strong 
increase in production volumes for 
2011 with higher oil realisations and 
continued increases in gas 
realisations in Ukraine. Despite 
these benefits, the Company is 
absorbing substantially increased 
production related taxes in Ukraine 
which it did not bear in 2010 and this 
will impact 2011 earnings. 
Turning to our prospects for 2011, 
first gas in Russia in the autumn will 
be an important landmark for the 
Company. Ukraine will continue to 
provide the backbone of our cash 
flow and, together with Hungary, also 
provide us with exploration upside. In 
addition, we look forward to entering 
the fast-growing Ukrainian LPG 
market at mid-year and adding value 
to our existing gas business.
Finally, I wish to thank our people for 
their commitment and expertise over 
the last 12 months, as well as our 
shareholders for their continuing 
support.
served on the Boards of several 
other major companies, such as 
GlaxoSmithKline, and believe that 
this background can aid JKX in its 
plans for growth.
Having been in my position for only 
one month at the date of this 
release, it is too soon for me to 
comment on achievements with 
which I have had no involvement. 
Clearly, we benefit from a very 
strong production base in Ukraine, 
complemented by the development 
prospects in Russia and, albeit to a 
lesser extent, in Hungary.
Although considerable progress 
was made in 2010 on the large 
redevelopment project in Russia, 
the Company has experienced delays 
and capital cost increases; the 
commencement date for production 
in Russia is now expected in the 
autumn of 2011. More significantly, 
a delayed convergence of Russian 
domestic gas prices to European 
net-back levels is impacting our 
overall project economics and 
consequently we are making an 
impairment provision of $74.6m. 
Commitment to HSEC
My predecessor commented 
on the importance of protecting 
and nurturing our people, their 
communities and the environment, 
and this is a view which I share 
wholeheartedly. As a resource-based 
company, JKX rightly places great 
value on health, safety, 
environmental matters and 
community liaison (HSEC).
I note that the AIFR (All Injury 
Frequency Rate) figures decreased 
in 2010 and are well below the 
industry benchmark. Furthermore, 
we were successful in our attempt 
to achieve ISO 14001 Environmental 
Accreditation during the year.
Your Board
My appointment has been the only 
change to the composition of the 
Board. I would like to place on record 
my thanks to Lord Fraser, whose 
sterling service of over 13 years saw 
JKX grow into an established 
operator in eastern and central 
Europe, and also become 
 
Clearly, we benefit from a very 
strong production base in 
Ukraine, complemented by the 
development prospects in 
Russia and, albeit to a lesser 
extent, in Hungary.

Our facilities (UK)
The UK business operates from a state 
of the art, purpose built facility situated 
in	a	new	technology	park	in	Swansea,	
Wales  and is the most advanced plant 
of	its	kind	in	Europe.	The	size	of	the	facility	
is in excess of 4,500m
2
 and includes over 
2,000m
2
 of production cleanrooms. 
We have installed the latest generation 
of	tools	available	on	the	mark et,	with	the	
most advanced equipment as used by 
IC and prime silicon producers. With the 
highest	technical	specifications,	we	are	
positioned to offer the most effective 
wafer	reclaim	ser vice	to	our	customers	
with	minimal	silicon	removal.	This	enables	
our customers to maximise the number 
of	times	a	test	wafer	can	be	reclaimed.
Our facilities (USA)
The	facility	in	P rescott,	Arizona	was	
constructed in 1997 and has received in 
excess of $40m of investment since then. 
This high volume high-tech fab has been 
focussed on provision of 100mm, 125mm, 
150mm 	 and 	 200mm 	 wafer 	 reclaim 	 ser vices,	
but	following	the	acquisition	by	P ure	W afer	
in February 2007 capability to reclaim 
300mm	wafers	has	been	installed.
Pure Wafer is a worldwide leader in the provision 
of 300mm wafer reclaim services. These services 
enable semiconductor manufacturers to gain 
efficiencies through the increased re-use of silicon 
test wafers within their production processes.  03 Annual report and accounts 2008  Pure Wafer plc

About wafer reclaim
During the many stages of the manufacturing process of 
semiconductors,	large	quantities	of	test	wafers	are	used	to	check	
the	accurate	calibration	of	equipment.	These	test	wafers	are	a	k ey	
consumable in the manufacture of semiconductors and the ability 
to reclaim them through Pure Wafer’s advanced process provides 
manufacturers	with	the	oppor tunity	to	reduce	costs.
The semiconductor industry is currently seeing a rapid transition 
to	300mm	wafers.	In	order	for	manufacturers	to	continue	to	
increase functionality at a reduced cost, the industry has sought 
to	increase	the	size	of	wafers	on	which	semiconductors	are	
manufactured.	300mm	wafer	processing	now	represents	the	
fastest	growing	area	of	the	semiconductor	industr y .	
However ,	wafer	reclaim	is	a	highly	specialised	and	technically	
sophisticated	process.	Only	a	few	companies	worldwide	are	
able to meet the exacting standards required by semiconductor 
manufacturers	for	the	reclaim	of	300mm	wafers,	of	which	
Pure Wafer is one.

Chairman’s 
Statement 
Overview
I am pleased to report that the gradually 
improving trend in revenue seen in the latter 
part of the first half of the year continued to 
gain momentum with the result that second 
half revenues were up 1.8% compared with 
the corresponding period last year. 
We are encouraged by the positive revenue 
performance of the second half, which 
resulted in a considerably improved operating 
profit, although revenue for the year as a 
whole fell 5% and operating profits were 
£2,415,000 (2009: £3,561,000).
We have reduced net debt substantially at the 
year end to £3,114,000 from £6,218,000 in 
2009. This places the Group in a strategically 
strong position in continuing uncertain  
market conditions.
Our mid-market brands Harlequin and 
Sanderson, which account for 80% of our 
brands’ revenues, have performed well during 
the economic downturn. The quality of design 
and value of the products have helped 
Harlequin and Sanderson to grow annual 
revenues. However in a price-conscious 
market, our premium-end brand, Zoffany, 
has, not surprisingly, experienced a significant 
decline in revenues.

Overview
I am pleased to report that in the UK, 
currently the largest market for our brands, 
retail performance has been relatively robust 
with annual revenues down only 2%, having 
been down 10% at the half year. We remain 
focused on international expansion where  
we see significant opportunity. However, in 
the year, Continental Europe and the USA 
have experienced much tougher trading 
conditions, being down 20% and 25% 
respectively. Encouragingly, we have grown 
our revenues in the Rest of the World by 14% 
particularly in the Far East and Australasia.
Manufacturing significantly improved its 
second half performance, following a first half 
programme to reduce the cost base and a 
second-half return in customer confidence 
leading to increased revenues. Profitability 
was substantially improved, with a first half 
operating loss before exceptional items of 
£84,000 being turned into a full year operating 
profit before exceptional items of £633,000.
Financials
Revenue decreased 5% to £60,378,000, from 
£63,698,000 over the same period last year. 
The operating profit for the year was 
£2,415,000 (2009: £3,561,000) and the profit 
before tax was £1,552,000 (2009: 2,787,000). 
The profit after tax declined to £1,173,000 
(2009: £1,622,000).
Earnings per share were 2.10p (2009: 2.96p).
 
Interest cover on bank borrowings increased 
to 9.2 times, compared with 5.1 times  
last year.
The Group’s net indebtedness at the year end 
reduced to £3,114,000 (2009: £6,218,000). 
This represents a reduction in gearing to 17% 
(2009: 31%). The cash inflow from operating 
activities was £4,338,000 (2009: £2,830,000), 
reflecting lower interest costs and strong 
working capital management. At the year end, 
the Group had available banking facilities of 
£12,395,000 (2009: £12,773,000) 
representing headroom of £9,281,000 (2009: 
£6,555,000).
Dividend
It has been our intention to return to the 
dividend list at the appropriate time, based  
on the strength of our business and our 
confidence in the future. Our decision to pay a 
final dividend for the year ending 31 January 
2010 marks a major milestone in the 
Company’s recent history, reflecting the 
strength of our cash flows and our modest 
level of debt. 
We are now at the point where we can 
continue to invest in the Company’s  
growth and at the same time pay dividends. 
The Directors have therefore decided to 
recommend the payment of a final dividend  
of 0.50p per share (2009: nil) which will be 
payable on 6 August 2010 to shareholders  
on the register on 9 July 2010. 
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all of our management and employees for 
their loyalty and commitment during a 
challenging year. 
Outlook
Whilst the market in which we operate has 
been difficult during the year, we have 
successfully reduced our cost base, improved 
our manufacturing efficiency, and most 
importantly have halved our net debt. The 
strength of our brands, the excellence of our 
product design and the depth of our 
distribution has returned the Group to second 
half revenue growth. The robust nature of our 
balance sheet allows us to invest in our 
business going forward in order to ensure 
strong medium-term growth. 
We have started our new financial year in line 
with internal projections and we look forward 
to the unique opportunity created by the 
150th anniversary of Sanderson during the 
coming year. Whilst remaining cautious we 
are convinced by the potential of the Group, 
which is in a strong position to exploit 
domestic and international opportunities even 
in uncertain market conditions.

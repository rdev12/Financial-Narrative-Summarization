Chairman’s Statement
For the Year Ended 30 September 2009
Growth rates in and investor returns  
from the environmental markets sector  
can be expected to outperform the 
mainstream economy
Principal activities and review of  
the business
The period from the demise of Lehman 
Brothers in mid September 2008 to the 
present will surely be remembered as 
one of the most extraordinary in the 
history of finance and economics.  
Until the spring of 2009, the effects of a 
severe recession, collapsing credit and 
banking markets, high profile corporate 
failures and pronounced risk aversion 
had threatened to decimate the 
investment management sector. 
However, in recent months, following 
radical macroeconomic policy 
interventions, particularly quantitative 
easing and stimulus funding,  
confidence has improved, and at  
present we are in a more benign 
business environment.
In this context, in the financial year 
ending 30 September 2009, while 
Impax’s revenue has not been immune 
to the stock market crash, the Group has 
taken a substantial step forward. Assets 
under discretionary and advisory 
management (“AUM”) started the year  
at £1,098 million. As the market fell, we 
suffered only minimal redemptions and 
AUM reached a low of £889 million in 
March 2009 before rising to £1,263 
million by the end of the Group’s financial 
year. Since then, major new mandates 
from a European institutional investor 
and our new investment trust targeting 
the Asia Pacific region (described in 
more detail below) coupled with broadly 
rising markets have led to a further 
increase in AUM, which reached  
£1,419 million on 30 November 2009. 
This year, in recognition of our 
increasingly complex business, my 
statement is followed by a Chief 
Executive’s Report, in which Ian Simm 
sets out more detail behind our 
performance, current status and plans.
Results for the year and  
proposed dividend
During the year we have undertaken a 
review of the Group’s accounting 
policies, and this has led to a number of 
corrections and improvements. Although 
none of these changes has materially 
impacted upon shareholders’ equity, 
results for 2008 and 2009 now reflect in 
particular an amended basis of 
expensing the Group’s long-term 
incentive scheme and the consolidation 
of one of the funds into which we have 
injected seed capital. Further information 
is included within the Prior Year 
Adjustment Note to the Accounts.
Notwithstanding the significant overall 
rise in assets since the start of the 
period, our results also reflect the sharp 
fall in equity markets in late 2008 and 
early 2009. Turnover for the year was 
£10,391,196 (2008: £11,389,264), an 8.8 
per cent decrease over the year. 
Turnover included £945,620 of 
exceptional non-recurring fees due 
under the management contract of our 
private equity fund. 
Profit before tax excluding minority 
interest was £2,472,992 (2008: 
£3,516,119 (restated)). This result 
included a charge of £551,579 (2008: 
£917,665 (restated)) for the Group’s 
long-term incentive scheme.
The tax charge for the year was lower 
than the standard rate of corporation tax 
for the UK as a result of credits arising 
on recognition of deferred tax assets. 
Earnings per share (“EPS”) were  
2.63 pence (adjusted), a 22 per cent fall 
against last year (3.36 pence (restated)). 
These EPS numbers exclude the 
charges for the Group’s long-term 
incentive scheme and therefore, in the 
Board’s view, represent the most 
relevant measure of the year’s earnings.

increased to £13,849,539 (2008: 
£11,397,770 (restated)). There was no 
long-term debt and cash reserves readily 
available to the principal operating 
activities of the Group were £6,694,182 
(2008: £7,028,619).
A year ago the Group’s shareholders 
approved a proposal to pay a maiden 
dividend of 0.35 pence per share (for 
year ended 30 September 2008). 
Notwithstanding the events of the year 
and the consequent fall in the Group’s 
revenues and profits, I am pleased to 
report that the Board recommends that 
the dividend be increased to 0.40 pence 
per share. This dividend proposal will be 
submitted for formal approval by 
shareholders at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting on 10 February 2010.  
If approved the dividend will be paid 
shortly thereafter on a date to be 
confirmed in the formal Notice of AGM. 
In recognition of the Group’s stage of 
development, the Board does not 
currently intend to propose payment of 
interim dividends.
Name change
In recognition of the Group’s single focus 
on investment management, in 
September 2009, shareholders gave 
their overwhelming support to change 
the name of the Group from Impax  
Group plc to Impax Asset Management 
Group plc. 
Board of Directors
In September this year, I announced that 
Vince O’Brien had agreed to join the 
Group’s Board as a Non-Executive 
Director with immediate effect, taking the 
number of Directors to six. Vince, who is 
currently a Director of Montagu Private 
Equity and has worked in the private 
equity industry for over 20 years, is 
ideally placed to enhance our private 
equity strategy. He is a past Chairman of 
the British Venture Capital Association 
and served on its Council for seven years. 
Prospects  
Governments around the world are 
rapidly building their understanding of 
how to reduce pollution and improve the 
efficiency of natural resource use, while 
realising that the private sector can 
rapidly deliver cost-effective solutions 
within competitive environmental 
markets. Earlier in the decade, 
institutional investors were 
understandably cautious about the 
rationale for long-term allocations to 
investment strategies targeting the 
environmental sector. However, there is 
now an overwhelming body of evidence 
supporting claims that growth rates in 
and investor returns from this sector can 
be expected to out-perform the 
mainstream economy. It is therefore 
logical to conclude that the number of 
attractive investment opportunities for 
the portfolios that we manage will 
continue to expand.
Impax’s investment team has now been 
operating in this sector for over a decade 
and has experienced two full market 
cycles. With strong sector prospects, a 
scalable business model and a 
committed, experienced management 
team, I am confident that the Group is 
well positioned for further growth.

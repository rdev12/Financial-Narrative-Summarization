Chairman’s statement
Strategy
Laird’s strategy is driven by the 
overarching objective of creating 
and growing shareholder value, 
by developing a unique capability 
to provide our customers with a 
wide range of performance critical 
electronics products, systems and 
solutions. Our growth strategy 
encompasses five key elements:
1.  Focus on specialist high 
growth markets
2.  Increase content and value-add 
in each electronic device/unit
3.  Exploit innovation and technology, 
and product convergence
4.  Develop systems and controls 
combining hardware and software
5.  Maintain a culture of operational 
excellence allied to corporate 
social responsibility
Our strategy, developed over a 
number of years is, we believe, 
enduring, and has survived the 
recession. We believe that “breadth 
is strength” and that, together 
with the elements outlined above, 
will over time deliver superior 
shareholder value.
Dividend 
The Board’s dividend policy is to 
increase returns to shareholders over 
time, while taking account of both 
the underlying profitability and cash 
requirements of the business. 
The 2009 full year dividend was 
set at 6.0 pence per share (2008, 
10.31 pence), a level which allowed 
funding of growth opportunities 
while pursuing a progressive 
dividend policy. The Board then 
declared an interim dividend for 2010 
of 2.1 pence, and is recommending a 
final dividend of 4.2 pence per share, 
giving an annual dividend of 6.3 
pence, growth of 5%.
Corporate and Social 
Responsibility
As a forward-thinking business, 
we recognise the need to behave 
as a good corporate citizen 
and therefore corporate social 
responsibility remains an integral 
part of our everyday business. 
We have continued our focus on 
improvement across our business in 
all areas of corporate responsibility 
and have retained our inclusion in 
the FTSE4Good index. Further details 
of Laird’s corporate responsibility 
activities are available in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
section of this report.
Our Employees
In these challenging times I never 
cease to be impressed by the levels 
of enthusiasm and commitment of 
our employees at all levels of the 
organisation. On behalf of the Board 
I would like to pay tribute to our 
global team who have worked 
so hard to make this year’s result 
achievable.
Outlook
During 2010 Laird emerged strongly 
from the global recession and 
financial crisis. The benefits of 
maintaining our spend, during this 
period, on R&D and engineering 
has resulted in our expanding our 
customer base and increasing our 
penetration with most of our existing 
customers. The majority of our 
markets also showed a progressive 
recovery during 2010. We believe 
our strategy to be enduring, the 
fundamentals of our markets remain 
attractive, our financial position is 
strong, and we are well placed to 
pursue further profitable growth.

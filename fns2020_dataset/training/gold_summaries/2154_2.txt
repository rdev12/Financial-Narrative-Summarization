 Asterand plc - Annual Report and Accounts 2010 01
• Revenue $21.3 million, an increase of 14% over 2009. Operating loss $2.1 million (2009: $1.6 million), nearly break-even adjusted
EBITDA (2009: $0.4 million profit).
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) – and excluding exceptional items and share option related charge. See
page 27 for a reconciliation of operating loss to adjusted EBITDA.
• Successfully integrated our first acquisition as a public Company – BioSeek: 2010 revenues of $6.4 million represented a 68%
increase over 2009.
A California-based company with propriety human primary cell based predictive technology. Complementary to Asterand’s existing human tissue based business.
Total consideration of $9.5 million represents a multiple of less than 1.5 times 2010 sales – we believe that this is a favourable arrangement, given BioSeek’s true
value.
• Awarded prestigious contract under The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) – (US National Cancer Institute (NCI) / the National
Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)). Up to $24 million over five years, including an initial base period of $5.4 million
over 17 months. A validation of Asterand’s approach.
• Won key contracts with pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, and government agencies, including with Ono Pharmaceuticals,
Eisai Co. Ltd., Cellzome, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency).
• Invested in science and innovation to lay the foundation for future growth and profitability. Established GLP at Royston (UK
facility). Held successful inaugural annual human tissue conference in Washington DC in April 2010. Appointed Dr Dalia Cohen
as CSO in September.
• Gross margin 56% (2009: 58%), operating expenses increased to $14.1 million (2009: $12.4 million) and cash resources of
$5.9 million (2009: $6.6 million).
Post Year End Events
• $8.5 million of contingent consideration due for BioSeek to be paid entirely in cash – $2.5 million in May 2011 and the remaining
$6 million financed through the issue of loan notes to the BioSeek vendors which mature over the period to December 2013.
• Statement on Japan earthquake and tsunami
We have many close business and personal relationships in Japan and we feel deep sadness over the tragic impact on the Japanese
people caused by the recent earthquake and tsunami. In terms of the Asterand business, 12% of 2010 revenues were from Japan.
However, most of our business conducted in Japan is from long term BioMAP collaborations with companies that were not
significantly impacted by the tragedy due to their geographical locations. Some minor delays in the progression of these contracts
may result in 2011. However, currently, all indications suggest that they will not be significant.

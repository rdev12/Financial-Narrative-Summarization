CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
The financial year to 31 March 2013 saw mixed 
trading conditions, with a slight softening of 
demand in the first half year followed by a further 
slowdown in the second half, particularly in the 
final months of the year. The slowdown was 
especially apparent in the power generation, 
quarrying and mineral processing sectors, and 
there was reduced order levels in turbocharger 
casings and housings. Although underlying 
demand remains subdued, our focus on business 
development is identifying new opportunities and 
I believe that our prospects for the medium term 
remain attractive.
FOUNDRIES
Chamberlin & Hill Castings (“CHC”)
CHC comprises our foundries in Walsall and 
Leicester which, since 2009, we have operated 
as a single business under the control of a single 
management team.
Our foundry at Walsall produces small castings, 
typically below 3kg in weight, in mid-to-high 
volumes. It has well-established expertise in the 
development and production of castings with 
complex internal passages, where the foundry 
process is the only cost-effective means of volume 
production. A major market for the Walsall 
foundry is automotive turbochargers, where 
modern designs require careful alignment of 
cooling and lubrication passages to meet the 
increased performance demanded by modern 
engines. In past reports I have commented that 
legislation to reduce CO2 emissions is promoting 
the introduction of smaller, turbocharged 
petrol engines and this technology shift is 
continuing. New turbocharger original equipment 
manufacturers (“OEMs”) have entered the market 
and are building production capacity to supply 
2014 and 2015 requirements and the existing 
players are defending their market share.
CHC has a long-standing relationship with 
BorgWarner, the global market leader in 
turbocharger manufacture, and in recent years 
we have added IHI Charging Systems, another 
major manufacturer, to the customer base, having 
developed a family of castings for the Company’s 
turbochargers. The production launch of this 
family of castings started in 2010 and the final part 
enters production in the first half of the current 
year. CHC is quoting components for supply to 
both turbo OEMs in 2014/15, and is working on 
developing relationships with new OEMs.
The demand for turbochargers is dictated by 
the number of vehicles built, and our scheduled 
demand reduced in the fourth quarter of the 
financial year as the European car market slowed. 
We expect demand to remain at these levels in the 
first half of the new financial year but, in general 
industry, projections show car build numbers in 
2013 at the same overall level as 2012, implying a 
recovery towards the end of the year.
Our Walsall foundry also supplies turbocharger 
castings for commercial diesel engines and 
demand in this sector remains stable. In 2012, 
we started to supply our first fully-machined 
turbocharger casting to this sector using a sub-
contractor and after proving capability, we have 
been able to increase the number of castings 
where we take machining responsibility. This 
approach fits well with the long-term goal of some 
of the turbocharger OEMs and we are currently 
evaluating other supply arrangements that will 
allow us to extend this offering to passenger car 
components. 
The technical challenges in castings can be 
simplified to issues of geometry and metallurgy. 
Walsall’s focus is on producing small castings 
made of relatively straightforward grades of iron, 
which have complex internal geometry. Our 
foundry in Leicester, which produces mid size 
castings typically around 20kg, produces castings 
with moderately complex shapes which require 
demanding metallurgy to deal with challenges 
from temperature, strength and wear resistance. A 
significant part of the Leicester foundry’s output 
is accounted for by the construction equipment 
industry, and reduced demand from this sector 
adversely affected the foundry in the latter months 
of the financial year. Demand remains subdued 
but Leicester can serve a variety of markets and 
work is underway to broaden the customer base. 
Our most significant opportunity is the initiative 
to enter the market for turbocharger turbine 
casings, a high temperature application where 
Leicester can effectively supply the commercial 
diesel sector through the relationships made at 
Walsall. Development of the first castings has 
proved successful and although final testing 
of our customer’s product has taken longer 
than anticipated we expect to start supplying 
production volumes in the new financial year. 
Russell Ductile Castings (“RDC”)
RDC, located in Scunthorpe, produces heavy 
castings weighting up to 6,000kg and delivers 
castings with complex geometry and challenging 
metallurgy. Applications typically require high 
strength or high temperature performance and 
include castings for large process compressors, 
industrial gas turbines and mining, quarrying and 
construction equipment. A significant proportion

of output is supplied as a finished part, with 
RDC taking responsibility for machining which is 
managed through a range of sub-contractors. The 
foundry is also the only UK producer of cast iron 
tunnel lining segments and I am pleased to note 
that a further contract, worth £0.8m, has been 
won to supply lining segments for an upgrade at 
Bond Street tube station. This follows a two year 
programme, which is now concluding, to supply 
Crossrail for approximately £3.0m of these parts. 
We expect other projects are likely to take place in 
future years.
RDC was adversely affected by a slowdown in its 
key markets in the latter months of the financial 
year and demand remains subdued. However, 
during the past year we completed a structured 
evaluation of potential markets and product 
applications and this has brought increased 
focus to our business development activity. We 
have brought into the business experienced sales 
people from outside the foundry industry and 
although the process for winning new work in the 
engineering sector is seldom rapid, we have seen 
some encouraging progress in developing new 
markets and new customer relationships.
RDC shares a number of customers and potential 
markets with our Leicester foundry, and the two 
sites are working closely to identify and pursue 
these shared opportunities.
ENGINEERING
Exidor
Located in Cannock, Exidor has the leading position 
in the UK market for securing bolts for emergency 
exits, known as panic hardware, and more recently 
has expanded into the related market of door 
closers through the acquisition of assets of a failed 
company. In the past year Exidor has maintained 
its position as UK market leader in panic hardware 
and continues to compete effectively in this 
market. The door closer product saw significant 
margin pressure with increased component costs 
but we have taken remedial action to address this 
and restore profitability. Under the leadership of 
a new Managing Director new applications for 
Exidor’s products have been identified, which can 
be fulfilled by refinements of existing products, 
and a programme to increase exports is underway. 
We expect both initiatives to create new growth 
opportunities over coming years. 
Petrel
Located in Birmingham, Petrel supplies certified 
lighting and control equipment for hazardous 
environments where there is a risk of explosion. 
Petrel has a small share of this market, but is a well 
respected brand with the potential to grow. 
We appointed a new Managing Director to the 
business in September who is driving the focus to 
develop Petrel’s market share. Structured selling 
techniques, improved distributor management 
and increased export activity are underway and 
product opportunities are being created by the 
increased availability of LED light sources. We  
look forward to seeing the results of this effort in 
future results.
OUTLOOK
We expect to see the prevailing softer market 
conditions persist over the first half of the new 
financial year. Nonetheless, we continue to focus 
on business development and on improving 
processes. This will stand us in good stead as 
demand returns and over the medium and long 
term, we believe there are significant organic 
growth opportunities for the Group.

FINANCE REVIEW
Overview
Sales decreased by 7% during the year to £42.3m 
(2012: £45.5m) and gross profit margin decreased 
marginally from 19.5% in 2012 to 19.2% in 2013. 
As a large element of cost of sales is fixed costs 
that are incurred independently of movements in 
sales volumes, this slight reduction in gross profit 
margin masks a year on year increase in variable 
contribution. The year under review includes fixed 
costs of £5.8m (2012: £5.9m and 2011: £5.2m) and 
when these are excluded from gross profit to give 
an internal measure of variable contribution, the 
underlying variable margin has increased from 
31.6% in 2011 to 32.5% in 2012 and 32.9% in 2013. 
This demonstrates the continued improvements 
the Group is making despite challenges in the 
economy.
Foundry Division sales decreased by 10% to 
£33.7m, reflecting reduced demand across all three 
sites. Sales in the Engineering Division increased by 
4% to £8.5m. Underlying Group operating profit 
decreased by 24% to £1.3m (2012: £1.7m).
Financing costs continue to reduce in line with 
borrowings, with bank overdraft interest in the 
current year down 47% to £41,000 (2012: £78,000).
Underlying profit before tax is £1.3m and shows 
a 23% reduction on the prior year (2012: £1.7m). 
Underlying earnings per share reduced by 22% to 
14.0p (2012: 18.3p).
The statutory results show statutory operating 
profit of £1.1m (2012: £1.6m), statutory profit 
before tax of £0.9m (2012: £1.4m) and statutory 
earnings per share of 10.0p (2012: 16.1p).
Tax
The Group’s underlying tax charge for the year 
was £167,000 (2012: £242,000) with an underlying 
effective rate of 13% (2012: 15%). The tax allowances 
relating to our research and development spend 
reduced the Group’s corporation tax liability to nil 
from £145,000 in the prior year. It is the Group’s 
intention to continue to make research and 
development claims for tax purposes where possible. 
T ax payable for 2013 is £95,000. The statutory total 
tax charge for the year was £66,000 (2012: £183,000).
Cash generation and financing
Cash conversion continues to be of high 
importance for the Group and all Group 
subsidiaries are focused on this. Cash generated 
from operations was £2.3m (2012: £2.4m) which 
equates to over 170% of underlying operating 
profit and demonstrates the high level of cash 
generation. This extends the Group’s impressive 
record of consistent positive cash generation in 
excess of underlying operating profits, which was 
maintained during the recession, as illustrated in 
the chart above. 
Capital expenditure for the year increased slightly 
to £1.5m (2012: £1.4m). This was marginally 
above depreciation and amortisation of £1.3m 
(2012: £1.3m) and reflects a departure from the

Performance
normal practice of capital expenditure matching 
depreciation and was due to a deposit for new 
plant to be acquired in the new financial year, as 
referred to in the Chairman’s Statement. 
Group borrowings continue to be reduced with 
financial liabilities down by £0.6m to just under 
£1.0m at the year end (2012: £1.6m). This is the 
lowest year end overdraft since March 2007. 
The Group is funded through a £5.0m overdraft 
facility that is renewable annually. The facility has 
been renewed through to 30 May 2014 and is not 
subject to any financial covenants.
Foreign exchange
In order to protect against future exchange 
rate movements the Group enters into forward 
currency contracts covering 80% of its forecast 
Euro denominated sales for the coming year. The 
Group has adopted hedge accounting in relation 
to these foreign currency contracts, as explained in 
detail in Note 2 to the Financial Statements.
During the period a number of forward contracts 
were identified as being ineffective from an 
accounting point of view as the sales for which the 
contracts were hedged against fell to below the 
level where hedge accounting could be applied. 
As such a charge of £69,000 was taken to non-
underlying items in the income statement where 
this would normally have gone through equity 
in the hedge reserve. A movement in fair value 
of £326,000 in respect of effective hedges was 
recognised in equity. 
Pension
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme was 
closed to future accrual in 2007. Following the last 
triennial valuation, as at 1 April 2010, contributions 
were set at £315,000 per year for the period under 
review increasing by 3% per year thereafter. Based 
on current assumptions, this would eliminate the 
deficit by 2020. A triennial valuation as at 1 April 
2013 is currently underway.
The IAS 19 deficit at 31 March 2013 was £3.9m 
(2012: £3.1m). The increase principally reflects the 
reduction in the discount rate used to calculate 
scheme liabilities, as a consequence of a fall in 
bond yields over the last year.
Share-based payments
During the year a credit of £69,000 (2012: charge 
of £148,000) relating to share-based payments was 
recorded in the income statement. This reflects 
the shares that were forfeited upon the removal of 
Mark Bache from the Board and a reversal of prior 
year charges related to subsidiary management 
who left during the year.
All outstanding share options are exercisable at the 
year end and as such no further amount relating 
to the current share options is expected to be 
recorded in the income statement.
Exceptional items
The current year includes exceptional items 
of £222,000 (2012: £nil). Of the total amount, 
£186,000 relates to the removal of the former 
Finance Director and £36,000 relates to legal costs 
associated with a back pay dispute at Russell 
Ductile Castings Limited. These are explained 
further in note 12.

 Archipelago Resources plc  
Annual Report 2011
08
I am pleased to present my first report 
as Chief Executive Officer of 
Archipelago and articulate our 
strategy for the further successful 
development of the Company. Our 
strategy is a simple one:
 > settle our existing production 
programme and maximise 
efficiencies at Toka Tindung;
 > continue exploration to grow the 
Toka Tindung asset, allowing us to 
also consider options to expand 
our production profile; and
 > develop our corporate presence, 
enabling us to leverage off our 
regional strength in South East Asia. 
The decision to join Archipelago and 
relocate to Singapore in August 2011 
was an easy one for me, given my 
belief in the strength of the 
Company’s assets, the strong support 
of its shareholders and the exciting 
phase that the Company had reached, 
having moved from an explorer and 
mine developer into a gold producer. 
The evolution from developer to 
producer can be a difficult one for 
many companies, with the skills 
required to manage construction 
being somewhat different to those 
required to efficiently and cost 
effectively run a producing mine. This 
transition has meant that the 
Company has had to build not only a 
mine, but also a capable management 
team and a corporate presence to 
enable us to continue to grow.  
I am pleased that the Company 
successfully managed this transition, 
positioning us to take advantage of 
other opportunities as they arise  
both regionally and wider afield.

Achieving full production 09 Archipelago Resources plc  
Annual Report 2011
2011 was a year focused on the 
construction of the mine and the 
ramp up to full production, but we 
also applied significant effort to 
restarting our exploration programme. 
This resulted in our announcement of 
material resource increases last 
December, followed by a significant 
uplift in reserves as published in 
January 2012 (discussed below in 
further detail). This focus will be 
maintained into the future, as we aim 
to grow the Toka Tindung asset and 
consequentially increase our 
production profile. 
Gold price outlook
Archipelago operates in a highly 
prospective pricing industry. The rise 
and strength in the price of gold 
continues to be a talking point in 
many economies and I foresee this 
robust trend continuing over the 
medium term. With high levels of both 
personal and public debt and the 
need for some of the world’s largest 
economies to continue with their 
quantitative easing programmes, the 
investment in physical gold, along 
with its hedge against economic, 
political and social crises, will continue 
to support the gold “currency” for 
some years to come. 
Business Review
Located on the northern tip of the 
island of Sulawesi, Indonesia and 
approximately 34km northeast of the 
regional capital of Manado, our 
flagship operation is the Toka 
Tindung Gold Mine which poured 
first gold in April 2011. Covering an 
area of 400km
2
 (inclusive of 
exploration permitted ground), the 
Toka Tindung Gold Mine comprises 
two mining licences and will 
encompass five open pits – the main 
Toka Tindung pit, along with four 
satellite pits to the south: Araren, 
Pajajaran, Kopra and Blambangan 
pits. We are currently drawing ore 
and blending from three of these pits 
– Toka, Pajajaran and Araren, with 
mined ore being processed using a 
conventional carbon-in-leach 
process.

Archipelago operates in a highly prospective 
pricing industry. The rise and strength in the price 
of gold continues to be a talking point in many 
economies and I foresee this robust trend 
continuing over the medium term.
For the 2011 year, Toka Tindung Gold 
Mine production statistics are as 
follows: 
 Year Ended
 31 December 2011
Ore mined (k/tonnes) 1,263
Waste mined (k/tonnes) 13,766
Total mined (k/tonnes) 15,029
Ore processed (k/tonnes) 877
Average head grade (g/t) 2.54
Process recovery rate 92%
Gold produced (Au Eq oz) 61,191
Since the beginning of April, when 
first gold was poured, operations 
have ramped up smoothly and for 
the nine months up to the end of 
December we produced 61,191  
gold equivalent ounces at a cash  
cost of US$579 per oz. 
We have an average strip ration of 5:1 
and have maintained operational 
throughput during the wet season 
(from December to March). This is  
a significant challenge, but one  
that we overcame by successfully 
implementing a number of strategies 
in anticipation of rain events. 
Ore from the three open pits currently 
in production is blended, allowing  
us to control head grade and already 
we are achieving above plan gold 
recoveries of circa 92%, and we 
anticipate these to remain consistent 
throughout 2012. Operationally, our 
aim in the calendar year 2012 is to 
produce between 135,000 and 
145,000 Au Eq oz at a cash cost of 
between US$540 and US$590 per oz.

Annual Report 2011
I can report there have been no 
material difficulties in commissioning 
the processing plant. Given the nature 
of the mined material, it was 
necessary to replace the rubber mill 
liners with steel liners during 2011. 
This caused some temporary 
processing delays and was a relatively 
minor issue. This has since been 
rectified and production has 
continued to increase, with the focus 
now on improving efficiencies and 
cost control. Since November, I am 
pleased to report that we have been 
running at the nameplate processing 
capacity of 1.7Mtpa. 
Costs remain a key issue within the 
industry. As has been reported by a 
number of our peers previously, 
mining companies are experiencing 
cost inflation over a wide range of 
inputs, no matter where they are 
geographically located. Archipelago is 
no different and we will be focusing 
on continuous improvement initiatives 
aimed at increasing productivity and 
controlling costs. 
Archipelago is a major employer in  
the local region, employing over 1,500 
people with more than 70% of staff 
coming from the near mine region, 
and 95% from Indonesia. The mining 
industry as a whole is experiencing  
a significant shortage in technical 
mining and processing personnel, 
exactly the sort of qualified people 
that Archipelago requires, and with 
this unbalanced supply/demand 
model there is of course the 
associated wage inflation. 
Notwithstanding this, Archipelago  
has been able to retain the majority  
of its key staff in the transition from 
developer to producer. The Company 
will also continue investing the 
necessary resources on training to 
ensure that Archipelago has 
appropriate skills in place for all  
its key functions.

Exploration
As noted above, Archipelago is 
committed to exploration and regards 
this as a key value driver for the 
Company. Our mining licences sit 
within a much larger region and there 
are a number of prospective targets 
which have intercepts near to surface. 
Our current JORC compliant ore 
bodies are also open at depth and 
along strike.
The prospective nature of 
Archipelago’s resource base was 
highlighted subsequent to the end of 
the financial period with a reported 
material increase in our reserve and 
resource, resulting from near mine, 
brown-fields exploration, initially 
focused around the Toka and Kopra 
pits. Key outcomes announced in 
January 2012 (subsequent to year 
end) included the following:
 > the resource increased to 52.6Mt  
@ 1.53 g/t Au for 2.58M contained 
oz Au (and 3.7 g/t Ag for 6.14M 
contained oz Ag) from 15Mt @ 
3.4g/t Au for 1.7M contained oz  
Au (and 8 g/t Ag for 4M  
contained oz Ag);
 > the proven and probable ore 
reserve increased to 27.6Mt @ 1.7g/t 
Au for 1.47M contained oz Au (and 
4.3 g/t Ag for 3.79M contained oz 
Ag) from 7.62Mt @ 3.7g/t Au for 
920k contained oz Au (and 8.9 g/t 
Ag for 2.18M contained oz Ag);
 > excluding silver as gold equivalent 
ounces, contained gold resources 
increased by 52%, with ore reserves 
increasing by 60%; and
 > the increase in ore reserves 
supported extending the mining life 
from six to nine years (with 
additional stockpile processing 
extended from two to seven years).
Archipelago is committed to exploration  
and regards this as a key value driver  
for the Company.

It should be noted that this drilling 
focused primarily on the Toka and 
Kopra pits (comprising 55% and 10% 
respectively of the current Toka 
Tindung mineral reserve). Drilling 
continues at these deposits and also 
at Pajajaran, Araren and Blambangan. 
The announcement of our updated 
reserve and resource estimates was 
welcomed by the market and 
confirms my belief that the Toka 
Tindung mine has significant life of 
mine upside. 
During 2012, we are continuing our 
exploration development programme 
with the objective of further increasing 
our resource and reserve estimates 
during the year. 
Summary & Outlook
Our focus is to grow into a respected 
and regionally dominant mid-cap 
gold producer, managing a portfolio 
of gold mines and delivering 
significant value and returns for our 
shareholders. With the management 
team that we now have in place, we 
are able to achieve this vision and I 
look forward to updating you on our 
progress. In this regard, I am confident 
that Archipelago will continue to grow 
and prosper throughout 2012. 
Finally, I take this opportunity to 
thank all of our stakeholders and in 
particular, PT Rajawali Corporation, 
for their help and support in what  
has been a transformational year  
for Archipelago.

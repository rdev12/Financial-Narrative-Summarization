 Energetix strategy 
The Group’s strategy is to produce products based on 
robust engineering principles, regularly utilising existing 
mass produced components configured in a novel and 
patentable way. Avoiding cutting edge science has enabled 
our businesses to de-risk the new product development 
process which in turn reduces development time and 
costs. This has enabled the Group’s businesses to have a 
lower than normal technology risk whilst still producing 
strong intellectual property. In addition, this facilitates the 
outsourcing of production and assembly, significantly 
reducing the Group’s requirements for investment in capital 
equipment. The body of know-how developed within the 
Group has also enabled our businesses to modify the 
design of existing mass produced components to reduce 
costs, improve efficiency and strengthen the Group’s 
intellectual property position.
What this strategy has achieved
Since the Group’s flotation on AIM in August 2006, our 
strategy of focussing on robust engineering rather than 
cutting edge science has enabled us to transition three 
early stage technologies to the point of product sales, 
utilising only c.£11.0 million over this time. We have now 
substantially completed the development roadmap for our 
first products from these businesses. In addition, it has also 
enabled us to find manufacturing partners for our Genlec 
and VPhase products, and Pnu Power is currently 
assembling its existing orders from outsourced pre-
configured sub-assemblies. This has limited our tangible 
capital investment to only £335,000 in 2008, a figure which 
is not anticipated to materially increase in future years. 
Overall our careful cash control and utilisation in 2008 kept 
expenditure to a minimum. Our recent restructuring has 
also enabled further operational savings. Whilst using 
predominantly mass produced components we are still 
generating new intellectual property with three new patents 
granted and five applications in progress. In particular our 
know-how has led to potentially new inventions in the core 
components that we utilise, further strengthening our 
already robust intellectual property position.

 4 The Rank Group Plc
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I AM DELIGHTED THAT THE GROUP’S PERFORMANCE 
IN 2002 HAS CONTINUED TO DEMONSTRATE THE 
STRENGTH OF OUR BUSINESS STRA TEGY AND RANK’S
EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM BY DELIVERING A 
FURTHER INCREASE IN BOTH EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS 
FOR SHAREHOLDERS
Alun Cathcart 
Going forward, the Group’s ability to continue to deliver consistent
growth in shareholder value will be heavily inﬂuenced by the presence
of a number of key attributes. First and foremost is a committed
executive management team with the necessary skills and experience
to communicate and deliver a cohesive business strategy.This team
has successfully transformed the business over the last three years
into one of Europe’s leading leisure groups. This transformation 
has been driven by strong operational management who have
themselves embraced a programme of change and development.
Second, continuous training and development of employees is
particularly important for businesses operating in competitive markets,
and where constant innovation is required to maintain market position
and increase levels of proﬁtability.The Group prides itself on ensuring
that its employees are fully equipped to learn and develop new
working practices, and provide customers with the best possible leisure
experience. While each of the Group’s divisions operates in different
markets, they share a common philosophy that having the best people
delivers the best results and each continues to invest in a regular
programme of training and development for all its employees.
Third, being able to recruit and then retain the best people is also 
a critical factor behind the Group’s success and is a reflection of 
the various incentive schemes that are now in place across all of 
the Group’s operations. At senior levels, each scheme seeks to align
the interests of management with those of shareholders, thereby
ensuring that personal achievements are rewarded, but always 
in the context of the Group’s overall performance.
While the economic uncertainty continues to affect the immediate
outlook for many international companies, I believe that the Rank Group
has both the necessary management and business structure to continue
to prosper and I look forward to the coming year with conﬁdence.

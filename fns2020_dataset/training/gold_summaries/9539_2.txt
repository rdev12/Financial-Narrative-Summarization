1 Underlying EBIT is calculated on profit for the period excluding special items, as noted on page 118 of this Report.
2 In 2009 we changed our reporting methodology for ore reserve development, in line with industry best practice, to exclude partially
developed ore reserves. We have reported on this basis since then.
3 Lost time injury frequency rate, as measured per million hours worked, is a key safety performance indicator. [ 03 ]

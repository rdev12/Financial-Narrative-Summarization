 08 Silverdell Plc Annual report and accounts 2010
Overview
I am pleased to report another year of progress and 
a strong Group performance for 2010. 
During the last twelve months the Group’s trading 
and financial performance has continued to improve 
and, despite the challenging economic backdrop, 
Silverdell has been able to build on its position as 
the UK’s leading specialist environmental support 
service business. With a much stronger balance 
sheet and reduced cost base, the Group is financially 
in much better shape and ready for the next stage  
of its development. 
Strategy
As part of a widespread review of the business we 
unveiled in June a new strategy, ‘Protecting Lives, 
Creating Value’, which is an exciting strategy 
designed to take the Group forward and, at the 
same time, provide greater resilience in these 
challenging economic times. A greater focus on 
repeat order business and long-term contracts 
should provide us with a higher level of long-term 
earnings visibility.
In his Chief Executive’s Statement, Sean Nutley 
outlines the strategy in more detail and how  
it is already being implemented.
“  I am pleased to report 
another year of progress 
and a strong Group 
performance for 2010.”

Silverdell is now in a strong position to take 
advantage of new opportunities arising from ever 
more stringent legislation governing the industry 
and which should help grow our market position 
both here and overseas where blue-chip companies, 
under their Corporate and Social Responsibility 
obligations, require worldwide asbestos management 
processes to be consistent with those adopted  
in the UK.
Despite concern surrounding the UK government’s 
capital programme for the public sector, we believe 
maintenance and compliance solutions will still be 
required for large existing property portfolios. We 
will seek to exploit our wider geographic coverage  
to its best commercial advantage, particularly  
in light of increasingly onerous legislation and 
regulation governing the handling and treatment  
of asbestos and other notifiable waste.
Results
Revenues for the year ended 30 September were 
£56.7m (2009: £59.5m) with adjusted EBITDA  
of £3.9m (2009: £2.3m) and adjusted pre-tax profit 
of £2.5m (2009: £0.6m). The order book at  
31 October 2010 remains strong with £62m (2009: 
£57m (restated
1
) at 31 October 2009), with £34m 
secured for 2011. At the year end, the Company’s 
net debt was £4.3m (2009: £4.7m) on the back of 
continued delivery of operating cash flows and the 
tight control over capital expenditure.
1
  The Group’s method of calculating the order book was changed during 
the year to include estimates of future revenues for the remaining 
term of framework contracts. Previously, the order book only included 
framework contract revenues for the current financial year. In order  
to aid comparability, the comparative order book figures disclosed in 
the Group’s last annual report have been restated.
Board & People
We have made a great deal of progress over the  
last two years and the Group is well placed to take 
advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.  
We also have a first rate leadership team, led by 
Sean Nutley, and I believe it is an appropriate time 
for me to relinquish my executive responsibilities  
to Sean. I will, therefore, become non-executive 
Chairman with effect from 1 January 2011 and look 
forward to continuing to play a role in the Group’s 
development in that capacity.
Our people and culture are an integral part of who 
we are and embody the duty of care ethos that  
is so important to how we run our business.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our 
gratitude to everyone in the Group for their hard 
work and dedication, and congratulate them on 
delivering an excellent set of results in extremely 
challenging economic conditions. 
Summary
This was a very good overall performance and  
we can be confident that our position in markets 
underpinned by the ongoing need for essential 
remediation and removal work will continue to 
stand us in good stead and I look forward to 
reporting on our progress in due course.

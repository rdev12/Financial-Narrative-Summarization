Chairman 5 Future: Annual Report 2004
Summary
I am delighted to report good trading
progress, a successful change of
financial year and a 20% increase 
in the level of dividend.
Financial performance
This is Future’ s first annual report
based on our new financial year,
ending on 30 September.
For the 12 months to September
2004, the Group generated turnover
of £190.4m and an adjusted operating
profit of £23.6m, producing an operating
margin of 12.4%. Adjusted earnings per
share were 5.9 pence, readily enabling
the Board to recommend an increased
dividend of 1.5 pence per share.
In addition to our audited results 
for the nine months to September,
we have published extensive pro
forma financial information for the 
12 months to 30 September 2004,
together with the equivalent for the 
12 months to September 2003. 
It is pleasing to be able to report 
to shareholders that on the evidence
to date, the management of Future has
been very successful in integrating
recently acquired titles, in particular
Guitar World in the US. It is also
pleasing that early indications are 
that the majority of newly launched
titles are meeting or beating their
budgeted expectations.
Future is a publisher of special-interest
magazines and websites, dedicated 
to serving audiences of enthusiasts.
Future is able constantly to broaden
and refresh its portfolio of titles, both
by launch and acquisition.
Change of financial year end
Future’s Board felt there was 
an overwhelming argument in favour
of changing to a September year end
from a December year end. The final
quarter of the calendar year (October
to December) is by far the busiest in
terms of both revenues – and particularly
operating profits. Having this as the
final quarter of the reporting year 
(as we did before) meant that annual
profits could potentially fluctuate
substantially based on trading right 
at the end of the financial period. 
Choosing the September year end
means that our busiest trading
quarter is now our first.
To assist investors in the analysis 
of our results and to make matters 
as clear as possible, we have published
our pro forma financial information 
for the two years ended 30 September
2004 as a separate section (pages 27
to 41). The audited results for the nine
months to September 2004 are set
out later in this Annual Report.
Board structure and 
corporate governance
During 2004 the Board has, with 
the help of external consultants,
thoroughly reviewed remuneration
practices to bring Future into line 
with other listed media companies.
We have also assessed our own
performance and effectiveness as 
a Board. We believe we are in full
compliance with all aspects of best
practice but as always, I am very keen
to hear from shareholders who have
any concerns or issues.
Proposed change of company name
We propose to shorten the Company’ s
name to Future plc because we are 
so often known simply as Future. 
A resolution to make this change will
therefore be put to shareholders at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Dividend policy and share buy-backs
Future is a highly cash-generative Group
and the Board is very aware that there
are a number of different ways to turn
this into shareholder value. In May
2004 we paid our first ever dividend 
of 1.25 pence per share and we have
recommended an increased second
dividend of 1.5 pence per share,
payable in January 2005 following
approval at our forthcoming AGM.
Having set out on this path, it is the
intention of the Board to continue 
to recommend dividends each year. 
In 2005, we propose to introduce 
an interim as well as a final dividend.
Dividend levels will clearly be
determined by reference to the
Company’ s profitability, distributable
earnings and cash generation.
At the forthcoming AGM the Board 
will again seek approval from
shareholders to buy back shares 
as another mechanism for creating
shareholder value. However at this
time, there is no intention to use 
this authority.
Strategy
Future is a special-interest consumer
magazine publisher serving a large
number of targeted audiences, rather
than being in the general-interest
consumer publishing sector. This
presents a huge opportunity as new
communities of interest are always
emerging and evolving. 
The Company has both the financial
and management resources to
acquire and launch new titles. When
appropriate opportunities arise, we
will continue to expand by both launch
and acquisition. At 30 September
2004 Future had net cash balances 
of £9.8m and unused bank facilities 
of a further £22.0m.
At present, our business comprises
computing, games and entertainment
titles. The Board is investigating 
a large number of possible new
magazines, most of which would
expand our portfolio in the
entertainment sectors.
Current trading and prospects
The year to 30 September 2004 
has been a good one for Future. 
We have succeeded with a number 
of acquisitions, launched some
interesting new titles and refreshed
and improved a number of existing
titles. We have strengthened the
management team in our largest
business, the UK, where trading has
exceeded our previous expectation. 
Current trading is encouraging;
we have made a very promising
start to the first quarter of our new
financial year.
Our prospects are excellent. I am
optimistic that our shareholders’
continued confidence in Future 
will be justified.

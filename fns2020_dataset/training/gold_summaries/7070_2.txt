 Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013/14
01
Strategic Report
Summary
India’s demand for natural gas is expected to more than triple to 500 mmscmd by 
2022. With domestic supply projected to fall well short of expected demand, we see 
the creation of a robust environment in which to monetise the Company’s current and 
potential gas discoveries.
The recent national elections in India have provided a clear majority government with 
an unprecedented mandate to see through its plans, particularly with respect to energy 
supply and security. Realising the full potential of India’s hydrocarbon resources will require 
continued participation of independent operators, service providers and government. 
2013/14 – Operations
Through 2013/14 we have made progress on a number of initiatives set out for our 
India focused portfolio.
• The Company’s activities have been focused on the finalisation of the PY-3 
comprehensive Field Development Plan (FDP) that will enable us to meet our target 
to recommence production in early 2015.
• The GS-01 operator notified the Government of India (GOI) that it intends to 
relinquish its participating interest in the block. Hardy is continuing to pursue the 
acquisition of the operator’s participating interest and the approval of the proposed 
FDP. Dialogue with government bodies continues regarding the approval of this 
transfer, and consideration of the FDP submitted by Hardy in late 2012.
• The CY-OS/2 arbitration award in our favour was a very positive development. 
• The exploration drilling programme at D3 was pushed to 2014 due to the lack of 
rig availability. The joint venture applied for a 12-month extension to exploration 
Phase I and the Declaration of Commerciality for the Dhirubhai 39 and 41 natural 
gas discoveries is with the GOI.
2013/14 – Financial/Corporate
To improve reporting efficiencies the Board agreed to synchronise the Group’s 
accounting reference date to 31 March. 
No revenue was realised due to the continued shut-in of PY-3. Net cash used in 
continuing operating activities was $4.7 million and exploration related expenditures 
amounted to $0.2 million.
Cash and short-term investments at 31 March 2014 amounted to $24.7 million 
(2012: $29.1 million) and no debt.
Loss before taxation for the 15 months ended 31 March 2014 amounted to 
$5.4 million (12 months ended 31 December 2012: loss of $12.7 million).
The Group remains in a strong financial position with no debt.
The Board adopted a new Code of Business Conduct and amended its Committees’ 
terms of reference in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
In February 2014 the Company announced the appointment of Mr Ananth Kumar 
as a non-executive director of HEPI (a wholly owned subsidiary of Hardy).

i am pleased to report that Booker Group 
plc has again performed well. in the year 
to 26 March 2010, sales rose by 6.5% 
while operating profit was up 15.2% and 
the Group ended the year with net cash 
of £7.0m. c ustomer satisfaction continued 
to improve and the financial performance 
was good across the period.
the drive into the catering market  
is working with like-for-like sales to caterers 
up by 9.1% and sales to retailers up  
by 5.3%. 
the plans to ‘broaden’ the business  
are going well. We have converted 91 of our 
173 branches in the uK to the ‘extra’ format. 
the extra format offers a better range and 
delivers a better customer experience.
Booker distributed £797m of product to 
our customers’ premises this year versus 
£679m last year and we continue to expand 
our delivered offering. 
internet sales are £407m compared to 
£250m in the previous year.
We opened our first Booker branch in 
Mumbai, india in september 2009 which 
is trading well.
During the year we moved trading in the 
company’s shares from the aiM market to 
the official list. 
i should like to thank all our staff for their 
contribution to the success of the Group 
in the year just ended.
Basic earnings per share were 3.19 pence up 
from 2.63 pence last year. Given the strong 
operational performance of the business, the 
Board recommends the payment of a final 
dividend of 1.03 pence per share (2009: 
0.67 pence per share) which, together with 
the interim dividend, makes a total dividend 
for the year of 1.27 pence per share (2009: 
0.87 pence).  the final dividend is payable on 
9 July 2010 to shareholders on the register 
on 4 June 2010.
Outlook
the economy is expected to remain 
difficult in the year ahead and the food 
wholesale market remains very competitive. 
nevertheless, we expect to continue 
to make progress in this challenging 
environment. t rading in the first seven 
weeks of the current financial year remains 
in line with expectations.
Annual General Meeting
our annual General Meeting will be held  
on 7 July 2010. the notice of annual 
General Meeting separately accompanies 
this document.

We are consistently building  
a portfolio of high-grade assets, 
despite grade erosion for the  
global gold mining sector as a 
whole. This allows us to achieve 
superior investment returns and 
provides resilience to adverse 
market movements.

Delivering
sustainable
value
Commitment
to responsible
development
Applying strong capital discipline
Focusing on high-grade assets
Investing in exploration
Leveraging our hub-based system
A clear and consistent 
basis for long-term growth
The consistent implementation of our strategy  
is at the heart of our successful track record.
Underpinned by a commitment 
to good corporate governance,  
our business model is the  
key to our success and,  
ultimately, enables us to  
deliver sustainable value  
to our stakeholders.
Maintaining exemplary 
governance
We are committed to upholding good 
governance throughout our operations 
and in our interactions towards and  
on behalf of all our stakeholders, 
including communities, employees  
and government bodies.
Applying strong capital 
discipline
Capital discipline is the key characteristic 
of our investment and funding policy, 
informing the decision-making process 
across every aspect of the business  
in order to deliver healthy dividend 
streams for our shareholders.
Driving operational excellence
We continue to focus on achieving 
improved operational excellence in mining 
and processing technologies, which  
in turn has enabled us to commence  
the development of the third generation  
of high-quality assets.
Investing in exploration
Investment in both greenfield and 
near-mine exploration provides us with  
a cost-effective increase in our reserve 
base and, along with successful 
acquisitions, is the key source of  
our long-term growth.
Leveraging our hub-based system
Our centralised hub-based system 
handles ores from different sources, 
achieving economies of scale by 
minimising processing and logistics 
costs, as well as capital spending per 
ounce. This facilitates production at 
otherwise uneconomical medium-  
and small-sized near-plant deposits.
Focusing on high-grade assets
Return on investment in the precious 
metals industry is reliant on grades and 
mining conditions. We achieve better 
returns and lower risks from our project 
portfolio by setting appropriate thresholds 
on head grades and largely focusing  
on open-pit mines.
Delivering sustainable value
Our business model brings together our 
multi-faceted capabilities for increasing 
our resource base and improving both 
production efficiency and grades in order 
to increase profitability and free cash flow 
to deliver value to our shareholders.
01
Ensure robust  
operating and financial 
performance at our 
operating mines 
Focus on full capacity utilisation and 
robust cost performance of our operating 
mines by driving continued operating 
improvement. Extend our life-of-mine  
by investing in near-mine exploration.
02
Develop third generation  
growth projects 
 
 
With the second generation growth 
assets (Omolon, Albazino, Amursk POX,  
and Mayskoye) completed and fully 
operational, we have now commenced 
the development of the third generation  
of high-quality assets. The highlight of the 
portfolio is the recently acquired Kyzyl 
project, which, along with the Svetloye 
project, will be the key source of 
production growth from 2018.
05
Maintain high standards 
of corporate governance 
and sustainable 
development 
Maintain high standards of corporate 
governance, strictly adhering to the 
principles of sustainable development  
in our interaction with all stakeholders in 
our operations, including communities, 
employees and government bodies.  
Our goal is also to safeguard the health 
and safety of our staff in line with industry 
best practice. We are compliant with  
the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Group is also  
a participant in the UN Global Compact,  
a recognised international standard for 
sustainable development.
04
Remain opportunistic  
in the M&A arena 
combined with own 
exploration efforts 
Pursue further ‘bolt-on’ or other 
synergistic acquisition opportunities with 
a view to leveraging processing capacity, 
infrastructure and operational expertise  
at our existing processing facilities.
03
Maintain capital 
discipline to deliver 
superior free cash  
flow and substantial 
dividends
Deliver superior, strong free cash  
flow by focusing on return on capital in 
investment decisions and maintaining 
safe leverage levels. Deliver the value 
created to shareholders through stable 
and substantial dividend payments.

20 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 21 Stable and resilient operations 
in a volatile market
Market review
In 2015, the gold price is expected to 
continue to be negatively correlated with 
the strength of the US Dollar and the 
speed of recovery of the US and global 
economy, which may lead to an increase 
in interest rates by the Federal Reserve  
in the middle of 2015.
Silver closely followed the price dynamics 
of gold, although given the weaker 
investment demand, the gold/silver price 
ratio continued to increase: from 61/1  
at the beginning of the year to 75/1 at  
the end of 2014. The average silver price 
decreased by 19.8% from US$23.8/oz  
in 2013 to US$19.1/oz in 2014. The 
closing price was down 19.9%, from 
US$19.9/oz at the beginning of the  
year to US$16.6/oz at the year-end.
Demand
The annual total demand, according to  
the World Gold Council, was 3,924 tonnes, 
down 4% year-on-year after 2013’s record 
boost caused by lower prices.
Of that, jewellery demand of 2,153 tonnes, 
although down 10% year-on-year,  
was above the five-year average by a 
comfortable 5% margin. In the second 
half of the year, the Indian government 
relaxed measures designed to restrict 
gold imports, helping the physical 
demand. Jewellery is deemed to be the 
largest component of above-ground 
stocks of gold, accounting for almost half 
of the 177 .2 Kt of gold estimated to be 
held by private owners and central banks.
Central banks bought 477 tonnes of gold 
in 2014. Seeking continued diversification 
away from the US Dollar, these institutions 
continued to bolster their holdings of 
gold. Russia’s central bank was the 
largest purchaser, adding 173 tonnes  
to its already sizable stocks. Russian 
holdings are now estimated at over 
1,200 tonnes, which accounts for 12%  
of Russia’s overall reserves. Kazakhstan 
bought another 48 tonnes during 2014. 
Sales of gold by central banks 
were limited.
Net investment demand was 905 tonnes  
in 2014, up 2% compared to 2013.  
The increase was driven by a slowdown 
in outflows: ETF redemptions slowed 
considerably compared with 2013. 
Demand for bar and coins among smaller 
investors dropped by 40% after an 
abnormally strong demand in 2013.
Supply
2014 was another challenging year for 
gold producers. Many gold companies 
continued to cut costs and postpone  
their development projects to adjust to 
the lower gold price. This should help  
to re-establish market confidence in the 
sector in the longer term as the supply 
pipeline thins. In the short term, however, 
the global gold supply remained flat 
year-on-year. Mine supply rose for the 
sixth consecutive year to a new record  
of 3,114 tonnes, as mines that have been 
developed and become operational in 
recent years added to the supply stream 
and existing producers used high-grading 
to offset price declines. Meanwhile, scrap 
supply slipped by 11% to 1,122 tonnes. 
As a result, total supply at 4,278 tonnes 
was little changed. So, although 
production is expected to stay at this 
record level in 2015, the potential for 
existing operations to generate greater 
volumes of output is limited. The sector 
continues to lack interest in hedging, 
beyond project financing or the 
restructuring or rolling-over of 
existing positions.
Russia became the second largest  
gold producer in 2014 after China,  
having produced more than 270 tonnes. 
A further 2-3% increase in production is 
predicted by the Russian union of gold 
miners. Australia’s production remained 
largely flat, while annual mine production 
has decreased in the US, Peru and  
South Africa.

Price dynamics
Both gold and silver prices demonstrated 
significantly more stability throughout 
2014. Volatility was relatively low; the year 
closed with the price at US$$1,199/oz, 
little changed from the starting price for 
the year. The moderate weakening of the 
gold price was driven by the continued 
strength of US Dollar and equity markets, 
as well as an expected interest rate 
increase by the US Federal Reserve in 
2015. Throughout the majority of the year, 
gold traded in the range of US$1,200 – 
1,300/oz, with the lowest fixing at 
U$1,145/oz in November and highest  
at US$1,379/oz in March 2014. On an 
annual average basis, the gold price 
decreased by 10.3% from US$1,410/oz  
in 2013 to US$1,266/oz in 2014.
After last year’s dramatic 
reversal of a decade-long 
upcycle, the performance 
of the gold and silver  
price in 2014 was far  
less remarkable.

 Average for the period.
Polymetal continued to consistently beat expectations in 2014, 
despite the persisting weakness of commodity prices.
Our gold equivalent production in 2014 increased by 12% to 
1.43 Moz, exceeding its original production guidance of 1.3 Moz 
of gold equivalent by 10% and also the updated production 
guidance of 1.365 Moz by 5%. This achievement was mostly 
driven by the full ramp-up of Mayskoye and strong operational 
delivery at Dukat and Omolon.
Annual gold production for the year increased by 17% to 
945 Koz. Annual silver production increased by 5% to 28.7 Moz, 
led mostly by Dukat’s strong performance. The share of gold  
in revenue composition increased to 69%, compared with  
63% in 2013. Production of copper concentrate at Varvara was 
temporarily shut down due to the persisting weakness of the 
concentrate market, resulting in a significant decline in copper 
production year-on-year.
Production dynamics on a quarterly basis are shown in the 
graph below. With the full ramp-up of Mayskoye, the third  
and fourth quarters were the strongest during the year as 
concentrate was shipped out of the mine for sale or processing 
at the POX plant in the July – November navigation period.

The underlying production trend was emulated very closely by 
sales for the year. Increased sales of Mayskoye concentrate and 
further diversification of the offtaker base for concentrate from 
Dukat contributed to the reduction in working capital and 
improved financial performance.
Analysis of production results
Mining
Stripping volumes in 2014 decreased year-on-year to 77.5 Mt  
of rock moved (2013: 85 Mt). This encompassed the completion 
of the stripping campaigns at Varvara; the move to underground 
mining at Arylakh (Dukat hub) and Avlayakan (Khakanja hub); 
and the completion of open-pit mining at Sopka, with Dalneye 
nearing completion. Underground development increased by  
a further 9% to more than 56 km (2013: 55 km), with increased 
capacity to match processing volumes at Dukat and Mayskoye 
underground mines, while underground development continued 
at Avlayakan (Khakanja hub) and commenced at both 
Birkachan (Omolon hub) and Arylakh (Dukat hub).
Ore mined increased by 32% to 13.7 Mt (2013: 10.4 Mt), mainly 
as a result of the completion of a major stripping campaign  
at Varvara in 2013, increased volumes at Albazino to match 
processing capacity and accelerated completion of open-pit 
mining at Sopka (Omolon hub). Underground mining  
increased at Dukat and Mayskoye in line with the respective 
plant throughputs.
Processing
Ore processed increased by 5% year-on-year to 11.3 Mt 
(2013: 10.7 Mt). The main contributors were Dukat hub and 
Albazino with increased plant capacity, while Mayskoye 
achieved a full year of production at the design throughput.
In line with increased grades in ore mined, average gold 
equivalent grade in ore processed grew by a further 3%  
to 4.7 g/t. This was driven by increased contributions from 
Mayskoye and Albazino, combined with a stronger grade  
profile at Omolon and stable grades at other mature mines  
(with the exception of Khakanja and Varvara).
Production and sales
We exceeded our original guidance with a record production 
level of 1.43 Moz of gold equivalent. Key drivers behind this 
performance were Dukat, Omolon and Mayskoye. At Khakanja, 
where the mine is approaching the end of its mine life, 
production declined due to the decrease in average grade.  
At Varvara there was a 19% decrease in production, due mainly 
to the temporary shutdown of the flotation circuit on the back  
of the continued weakness in the copper concentrate market.
While most of the sales are comprised of refined metals, we 
continue to sell concentrates from Dukat (gold-silver), Varvara 
(gold-copper) and Mayskoye (refractory gold) to offtakers in 
Kazakhstan, Japan, South Korea and China. The offtake allows 
us to maximise the margins compared with in-house processing 
of these materials. In 2014, we continued to diversify our  
offtaker base in order to achieve an optimal combination of 
transportation costs and treatment charges/recoveries. Offtake 
concentrate trading was pioneered by Polymetal in the Russian 
gold sector and has now clearly become one of our core 
competencies. This will be leveraged further in the Kyzyl project.
Exploration
Our sustained investment in both greenfield and brownfield 
exploration, despite the current weak commodity price levels, is 
one of the key components of our business strategy. We believe 
strongly that our long-term growth is reliant on our continued 
efforts in this area.
Our exploration activities are focused on five regions of Russia –  
Khabarovsk, Magadan, Chukotka, Karelia, and Ekaterinburg –  
as well as on Kazakhstan. Polymetal currently has 62 licences 
for geological studies and gold, silver, copper and platinum 
group metals (PGM) mining, covering a total area of 8,624 km
2
, 
and one coal mining licence. Of these, our current exploration 
portfolio includes 42 licences covering 8,130 km
2
. In 2014, 
exploration capital expenditure amounted to US$72 million:  
269 km were drilled; 3 km of exploration underground 
development completed; and an additional 229 km
3
  
of trenching was carried out.
The breakdown of the activities by the stage of the asset is 
presented in the charts on the next page.
Our key exploration objectives in 2014 included:
•	 ongoing brownfield exploration activities aimed at extending 
mine lives at our existing operations: Khakanja (currently the 
shortest mine life), Dukat, Omolon, Varvara and Voro;
•	 completion of exploration at our greenfield gold assets, 
including Svetloye, Kutyn, Maminskoye and – most  
recently – Bakyrchik (Kyzyl project), and getting them ready  
for development;
•	 continuation of exploration for PGM deposits in the Karelia 
and Ekaterinburg regions in order to establish new hard-rock  
PGM resources sufficient for a standalone mining operation;

Continuing to focus on operating 
capacity and investment in exploration
•	 continued exploration activities at Albazino (including 
underground drift, geotechnical studies and in-fill drilling) that 
were aimed at converting the newly discovered resources  
to reserves that would extend the mine life of Albazino; and
•	 further greenfield exploration for new precious metals 
deposits with a potential resource base which would be 
sufficient in grade and size to justify the construction  
of a standalone mine.

 Restated data.
In 2014, our drilling volumes increased by a further 22% 
year-on-year to 268.8 km. The total capital expenditure on 
exploration increased to US$72 million in line with the increased 
volumes, including capital-intensive underground exploration at 
Albazino and drilling at the newly acquired Kyzyl project.
As a result, significant resource to reserve conversions were 
achieved during the year, along with maiden reserve and 
resource estimates completed for several greenfield projects. 
These included:
•	 initial reserve estimate at Svetloye (Khakanja hub) of 677 Koz 
with an additional 80 Koz of resources, which was followed  
by Board approval of the project development decision;

In 2014, we considerably expanded our reserves to 21.6 Moz  
of gold equivalent. This was a result of the Kyzyl acquisition 
(+6.7 Moz), coupled with a significant resource-to-reserve 
conversion and initial reserve estimate completed at several  
of our operating mines and advanced exploration projects 
(including Albazino underground, Svetloye, Kutyn and Veduga). 
Mineral resources (additional to ore reserves) declined by  
12%, mainly as a result of the resource-to-reserve conversion, 
particularly at Albazino, Svetloye and Olcha (Dukat hub). 
Additionally, with the acquisition of Kyzyl, we increased 
resources by 3.8 Moz.
The moderate gold and silver prices, of US$1,200/oz and 
US$17/oz respectively, used in both reserve and resource 
estimates in 2014 (2013: US$1,300/oz and US$22.5/oz) did not 
have a material impact on the final size of either but we felt that 
our more conservative approach was warranted.
Mainly as a result of the Kyzyl acquisition, our average ore 
reserve grade increased by 16% to 4.3 g/t GE and is one of  
the highest in the sector (see chart on page 13). The average 
mineral resource grade also increased by 11% to 4.2 g/t, also 
mainly due to the addition of Kyzyl mineral resources at 6.9 g/t.
•	 initial reserve estimate at Kutyn (completed in 2015) –  
386 Koz with an additional 649 Koz in resources;
•	 initial resource estimate at Tarutin (685 Koz of gold equivalent, 
of which Polymetal now owns 50%), which is now well 
positioned to complement the Varvara resource pool;
•	 initial resource estimate at North Kaluga (171 Koz of gold 
equivalent), previously part of Ural-Polymetal joint venture  
and now a 100% subsidiary of the Group;
•	 conversion of underground resources into reserves at 
Albazino (+1.4 Moz) and Olcha (Dukat hub) (+120 Koz).
In 2015, Polymetal will continue to expand its exploration 
portfolio into new potential areas. The Company filed  
19 applications for licences in 2015 including six gold areas  
in the Urals, nine gold and silver areas – four in the Magadan 
Region and five in Khabarovsk Region, and four PGM areas – 
one in the Urals and three in Karelia.
Our efforts during the year to come will be focused on:
•	 step-out drilling at Kyzyl, including the drilling to establish 
resources for the Bolshevik deposit and Bakyrchik 
exploration area;
•	 continuing brownfield exploration near the Omolon and 
Khakanja operations;
•	 step-out drilling at the flanks of known-ore bodies at Albazino;
•	 in-fill drilling at Svetloye ahead of the expected 
commencement of mining in Q4 2015;
•	 completing the PGM resource assessment at the Semcha 
area and prospecting for new objects with PGM mineralisation 
in the region.
Outlook for 2015
We are confident about the outcomes for 2015. With all of our 
operating mines now running at full capacity, the Company  
is on track to produce 1.35 Moz in 2015 and in 2016. There will 
be a slight decrease in production, mainly due to a reduction  
at Omolon after record levels in 2014 and the ongoing grade 
decline at Khakanja as it approaches the end of its mine life.
Operational plans
Our current year’s operational objectives for existing 
mines include:
•	 commencing mining at Oroch (Omolon hub);
•	 further increasing volumes of underground mining with  
the start of underground mining at Birkachan and further 
expansion at Arylakh (Dukat hub), Avlayakan (Khakanja)  
and Mayskoye; and
•	 materially improving health and safety performance, including 
at underground mines, and enhancing risk management 
activities with particular attention given to underground mining 
and blasting works.
Project development
The key focus of management will increasingly shift towards  
our new projects – Kyzyl being the largest. Our efforts in 2015 
will centre around completion of the full feasibility study for the 
project in Q4 2015 and the start of full-scale construction in  
Q2 2016. We will proceed with the construction of the Svetloye 
mine, approved in 2014, with mining expected to start in  
Q4 2015. We will also continue geological and metallurgical 
studies at Viksha (Semcha) – our PGM project in Karelia.

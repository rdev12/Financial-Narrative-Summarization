1. Net revenue is revenue less the cost of mobile top-ups (where PayPoint is principal), SIM cards and other costs 
incurred by PayPoint which are recharged to clients and merchants.  These costs include retail agent commission, 
merchant service charges for card payments and costs for the provision of call centres for PayByPhone clients.  
Net revenue is a measure which the directors believe assists with a better understanding of the underlying 
performance of the group.

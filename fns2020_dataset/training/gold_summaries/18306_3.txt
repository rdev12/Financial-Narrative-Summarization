“ The Group delivered 
its best ever revenue 
performance with 
revenue up 9% to 
£9.437m.”
Dr Mike Love 
Non-Executive Chairman
Chairman’s Statement
The Group has made 
significant progress in 2015. 
Product development has 
continued to be a priority 
throughout the year with 
a number of upgrades 
and new product launches 
successfully achieved with 
more expected in 2016.
The Group also delivered its best ever revenue 
performance with revenue up 9% to £9.437m. 
The continued investment in the Dillistone 
Systems division meant that, as anticipated 
in the interim statement and despite this 
growth in revenue, the Group saw a 21% fall 
in operating profit to £1.108m. Profit after 
tax rose 6% to £1.212m, benefitting from a 
tax credit in the year. Basic EPS improved to 
6.20p. 
ISV (www.isvgroup.com), which was acquired 
in October 2014, has been successfully 
integrated into the Voyager Software 
division and is investing in its own product 
development with a new product, ISV Online, 
due for launch in 2016.
Dividends
The Board was pleased to increase the interim 
dividend payment in September 2015 to 
1.35p (2014: 1.3p) and has recommended 
an increased final dividend of 2.75p per share 
(2014: 2.7p), subject to shareholder approval, 
payable on 24 June 2016 to holders on the 
register on 27 May 2016. Shares will trade 
exdividend from 26 May 2016. This takes 
the total dividend based on the 2015 results 
to 4.10p (2014: 4.00p), and gives a yield of 
5.1% on a share price of 80.5p. 
This represents our fourth successive year on 
year increase in the dividend, in line with our 
progressive dividend policy, which illustrates 
the Board’s confidence in the future prospects 
of the Group. The business is committed 
to maintaining its policy of investing in its 
products and services whilst rewarding its 
shareholders.
Staff
Our staff are fundamentally important to 
the success of the business. It is through 
their efforts, commitment and determination 
that we continue to be a leading technology 
provider in the sectors we serve. On behalf of 
the Board I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank all of our staff.
Outlook
At the time of our interim statement in 
2015, the Board explained that increased 
competition in the executive search software 
sector in which Dillistone Systems operates 
necessitated an increased investment to 
remain competitive. We stated that we 
believed that we were experiencing early 
signs of improved performance, noting a 
year on year upturn in orders, but warned 
that the increased investment would reduce 
profitability in 2015.
The Dillistone Systems division has continued 
– and will continue – to invest in improving 
products and services, and we are delighted 
to report further success in the market. 
Dillistone Systems’ core product – FileFinder 
Anywhere – has seen new client orders grow 
by more than 70% in the first quarter of 2016, 
when compared to the same period in 2015. 
Pleasingly, this growth is based on significant 
increases in both the number of new client 
wins and the value of those contracts. This, 
combined with continuing demand from 
existing clients, meant that our 12 month 
order book to March 2016 is at its strongest 
since 2013.
Our Voyager Software division has also enjoyed 
a strong start to the year. This Division offers 
a number of products and while performance 
has varied across the range, it is pleasing to 
note that the strong performance by several 
of its leading products has seen orders grow 
in Q1 by around 50% compared to the same 
quarter in 2015.
While the Group is not immune to potential 
economic instability, at this stage the 
expectation is that this strong order growth 
will continue. Both divisions are reporting that 
a growing proportion of incoming business 
is on a recurring basis, which is good for the 
longer term but is less positive in the short 
term. However, the results to date, coupled 
with our strengthening implementation 
pipeline, give us confidence that not only will 
the first half results show improvement over 
the second half of 2015, but we will see that 
trend continuing into the second half of this 
current year.
The Group’s continuing investment in product 
development across all parts of the business 
gives the Board confidence in the future and, 
as a result, we are delighted to propose an 
increase in our final dividend of 1.9% to 2.75p 
(2014: 2.7p).

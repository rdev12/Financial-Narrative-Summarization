 TRANSFORM
In the context of challenging trading 
conditions our overall performance 
for the year was in line with the 
expectations we set out in July 2015. 
It was a year of considerable change 
for Rolls-Royce: in our management, 
in some market conditions and in our 
near -term outlook. At the same time, 
there were some important 
constants: the underlying growth 
of our long-term markets, the quality 
of our mission-critical technology and 
services, and strength of customer 
demand for these, which are reflected 
in our growing order book. While we 
have some near -term challenges, 
these constants provide us with 
confidence in a strong, profitable, 
cash-generative future.”

Strategic Report / Chief Executive’s review Welcome to my first Chief Executive’s 
review for Rolls-Royce. My intention 
is that this report will share with 
you all, in a clear and open way, 
how we performed last year, 
the opportunities ahead of us 
and the clear goals and priorities 
we are setting ourselves to 
maximise value creation.
We are now taking great steps to 
transform the business, adding pace 
and simplicity to what we do, a process 
we started in November 2015. This will 
be covered extensively in next year’s 
report. In the meantime, we have 
significantly enhanced the disclosure 
in this year’s report to present our 
performance in a more transparent 
and understandable way. I hope you 
find it informative.
 
In this Strategic Report, I will describe 
the business in depth and we will provide 
further information on our financial position 
and business performance.

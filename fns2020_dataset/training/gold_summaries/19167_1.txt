 Chief Executive’ s review
4 NHP Plc 
NHP’s financial performance has improved significantly
in the year under review. Progress in both businesses
has increased our reported earnings but more
importantly, has increased the quality and predictability
of future earnings.
The UK care home industry
Over the past year , the sector has
had to deal with a number of changes
in the regulatory regime facing care
homes in the UK. The newly created
Care Standards Commissions for
England, Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland (four separate
organisations) this year took over
the regulation of all care homes.
Government policy with these bodies,
and generally towards the sector ,
has unfortunately proved to be both
confused and confusing, and has
not addressed the fundamental
problem of overall under-funding. 
Introduction 
NHP’ s financial performance has
improved significantly in the year
under review. The operating business,
Highfield Care, has grown its
operations to a national scale, allowing
us to begin to examine how to create,
and take full advantage of, operational
efficiencies. The property business
has successfully consolidated its
tenant base into a smaller , financially
stronger list. Progress in both
businesses has increased our
reported earnings but, more
importantly , has increased the quality
and predictability of future earnings.

The National Care Standards
Commission – regulating only England –
was due to impose over the next five
years a comprehensive package of
physical property , staff and training
requirements contained in the Care
Standards legislation. Disappointingly ,
the property standards will for the time
being only be applied to new-build
homes after a change of mind by the
Department of Health. This U-turn
followed Government recognition that
too many properties, with owners
unable to afford catch-up investment,
would close and possibly thousands of
much needed care beds would be lost
in addition to those already leaving the
market. It remains to be seen what the
situation will be in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
NHP believes that the UK public has a
right to expect high national minimum
standards in caring for our elderly
citizens. However , we recognise that
until the Government provides sufficient
encouragement to local authorities to
pay fees which fully reflect the cost of
care, many operators will not be able to
meet increased property and training
standards. The vast majority of NHP
beds meet the originally proposed
property standards. It is too early to tell
how effective the new regulatory bodies
will ultimately become but we hope that
current problems and long delays in the
registration and inspection processes
will be addressed in the short term.
T urning to fee levels, the Government,
in this year’ s Budget, increased the
budgets of local authorities’ social
services departments by six per cent.
However , none of the increase was ring-
fenced for elderly care – it was merely
hoped that additional funds would be
made available at the home level.
What this has meant in practice is that
beds continue to be lost in the areas
where publicly funded care home
fees remain below the cost of care.
Consequently , NHS bed blocking
and long waiting lists continue to be
serious national problems.
A huge problem facing care home
operators throughout the UK is wage
inflation as labour costs represent
around 60 per cent of the total costs
of running a care home. The rise in
National Insurance contributions next
April will also increase costs further . The
Minimum Wage has increased this year
only in line with inflation (compared to
last year’ s 11 per cent) but one of the
most serious issues facing the care
home industry is a shortage of care staff.
Competition for staff to work in care
homes from supermarkets, retail and
hospitality outlets and the NHS is
intense. Nursing wage costs are
expected this year to outstrip inflation
while additional NHS recruitment of
nurses has created sometimes severe
local shortages of trained staff. The level
of fee increases therefore remains
crucial with particularly low fee increases
being the norm in central and northern
England and Wales.
There is no doubt that the UK needs
substantial on-going investment into the
care home sector if it is to care properly
for its growing elderly population.
However , home closures are continuing
and new-builds are likely to remain at
very low levels because of the barriers to
entry created by the application of the
new physical property standards on
new-build homes. Sooner or later we
believe that the Government will have to
address the problem of this disincentive
to invest in new care homes, perhaps by
recognising that premium quality homes
should be able to charge fees which
reflect the quality of care delivered.

Operating business
Highfield Care
Our operating business has grown substantially during
the year and comprised 181 homes at 30 September
2002, including 23 homes owned by third parties. This
growth was due to the acquisition of Highfield Holdings
Limited in December 2001 and the addition of NHP
owned care homes previously operated by third party
tenants that went into receivership. The management
of Highfield Care has become skilled at minimising the
disruption caused by the receivership process whilst
keeping the homes open for business to ensure the
welfare of residents and staff. 
This year has seen the start of some
serious investment in the care
centres. This will make such a
difference to my residents and staff.
SANDRA GRIERSON HOME MANAGER NHP Plc  7
I’m looking forward to the
challenge of turning Highfield
Care into one of the UK’s premier
care home operators.
JOHN MURPHY CEO, HIGHFIELD CARE
Fifteen homes were taken out of
receivership during the year and
assigned to Highfield Care. We are
continuing the process of integrating
them and bringing their standards up
to ours. Three homes have been
transferred from receivership into
Highfield Care since 30 September
2002. The condition of many of the
homes was disappointing but not
surprising, given the lack of investment
by their former operators. We have
planned and are now implementing
a substantial programme of works
to improve the fabric of buildings,
equipment, gardens and staff training. 
Highfield Care, still in its development
phase, not surprisingly recorded an
operating loss for the year of £3.2 million
after being charged full rent of £15.6
million by the property business. NHP
properties with Highfield Care as the
registered operator were valued at
30 September 2002 on an existing use
basis at £159.9 million, representing an
uplift of £15.1 million over last year’ s
valuation of the same properties.
In order to build Highfield Care into an
operator with national coverage and the
necessary economies of scale, we have
deliberately increased the size of the
operational management overhead to
enable us to address the specific issues
relating to receiverships and to integrate
homes into our business quickly and
efficiently . Once this period of rapid
growth is over we will reduce the
overhead level with consequent benefit
to profitability . The review will be part of
the responsibilities of Highfield Care’ s
new Chief Executive, John Murphy . 
This year saw the beginning of a series
of initiatives to market the Highfield Care
brand to national audiences. We have
just completed the production of
brochures for each Highfield Care centre
– all with a common brand identity but
tailored to individual properties to reflect
the local nature of our business. Local
marketing is vital for the individual homes
and we have commenced a programme
of community sponsorship of school
sports and activities. In addition, we
have undertaken a carefully targeted
campaign of press advertisements
aimed at care purchasers and staff
recruitment.
With the growing size and importance
of Highfield Care, we have upgraded
incident reporting mechanisms and

Chief Executive’s review  continued
The Group’s portfolio of care homes is represented
across the UK with a growing proportion of the total
managed by Highfield Care.
as at 30 September 2002 NHP Plc  9
I’m very proud of the achievements of
my colleagues in reaching the
demanding ISO 9001 standards.
DAVID MCMAHON GROUP QUALITY
ASSURANCE MANAGER
enhanced our quality control
procedures. This has included an ISO
9001 home accreditation programme
under which the first 22 Highfield Care
homes have now received certification.
Looking ahead, one of our major
financial priorities is planning and
executing targeted investment in the
Highfield Care homes. In the year to
30 September 2002, we invested
£4.6 million in Highfield Care operated
properties and a larger amount is
planned for the current year . We will
also invest in extensions and additions
to selected homes and we currently
have a number of extension and major
refurbishment projects at various stages
of the planning process. In addition,
we have targeted specialist care (of the
physically and mentally impaired) as a
sector in which NHP will seek to grow
a much larger presence. T o this end,
we have charged one of our senior
management team, Saleem Asaria,
with identifying opportunities in this
area and bringing recommendations
to the Board to build a significant
specialist care business.
In the short term, Highfield Care will
continue its in-house development
through investment, training and
improved efficiencies. In the medium
term, we will examine all options open
to us to realise value for shareholders
from what, we believe, will become an
increasingly valuable asset.

Property business
NHP Property
NHP’s original business, where we act as landlord to
third party tenants, accounted for 75 per cent of the
portfolio by value at 30 September 2002 and will
account for 65 per cent of the portfolio by value when
the remaining homes which are managed by Highfield
Care are assigned out of the current receiverships.
The business has shown improved financial
performance during the year . 
Chief Executive’s review  continued NHP Plc  11
subsidiaries of Union Healthcare Group
Limited (with 41 homes in total).
Although modestly disruptive in the very
short term, the receiverships bring our
properties under our direct control and
we can ensure that from now on the
assets are cared for appropriately to
maintain and enhance their value. 
The property business should continue
to benefit this year from reduced
numbers of receiverships and lower
levels of rental voids. In addition, there is
the upside available from those homes
paying turnover rent (where NHP
receives a percentage of tenant homes’
turnover above a certain level) as
occupancy and fee levels increase.
Better performance is also expected at
those homes where we have invested
in refurbishment – with NHP funding
£1.4 million in third party tenants’
homes during the period under review
in addition to the £4.6 million spent in
homes operated by Highfield Care.
We will study carefully opportunities for
enlarging properties or even building
new homes in selective parts of the UK
with tenants we consider top class
operators but we believe the economic
case for new build is far from proven in
many parts of the UK.
Staff
We have begun the process of creating
a single unified team from the managers
and staff who worked for the operating
businesses which together form
Highfield Care. The goodwill and desire
to reach this objective was amply
demonstrated at the recent inaugural
Highfield Care Regional Managers’
Conference and I am encouraged by
the enthusiasm of our operational team.
During the year I have visited well over
100 of our care homes in all parts of the
UK. The people I met who are vital to the
successful operation of Highfield Care –
from regional managers and matrons to
nurses, carers and support staff – have
all proved to be dedicated, professional
and caring. Without their efforts, our
progress this year would have been
significantly reduced. I thank them all for
their hard work and dedication.
Bill Colvin
Chief Executive
16 December 2002
NHP owned 261 investment properties
(2001: 324) leased to third parties
which were valued at 30 September
2002 on an investment property basis
at £483.3 million (2001: £535.4 million).
On a like-for-like basis, these 261
properties increased in value by 9.7
per cent, largely due to improved
covenants as two of our largest
tenants, Southern Cross and Idun,
were themselves acquired by venture
capital backed companies.
Our strategy of tenant consolidation has
proved effective in increasing the
amount of rent collected (and therefore
reducing bad debts). The charge for
third party rent void in the property
business was reduced to £4.4 million
(2001: £10.3 million) reflecting the
benefits of consolidating the tenant
base and the inclusion of a number of
currently less profitable homes within
our own operating business. The NHP
independently managed tenant base
has more than halved over the last two
years to eleven companies. 
As we expected, there were a number
of further receiverships. The largest of
these were Harmony Care Homes
Limited (with 16 homes) and six
The new incentives provided
by Highfield Care’s terms and
conditions have really given us
all something to shoot for.

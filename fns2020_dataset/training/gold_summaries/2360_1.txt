Chief Executive’s report
Bovis Homes has made significant progress 
in 2013, delivering a strong improvement in 
revenue, profits and return on capital employed.
The Group has continued to acquire high quality land assets 
in the south of England and in prime locations in the midlands 
and northwest, where it is considered the housing market 
will be more robust. As a result, the Group has grown active 
sales outlets, leading to higher volumes. With an increasing 
proportion of legal completions from post downturn sites, 
average sales price and profit margins have improved.
Furthermore through an improvement in the efficiency of 
capital employed by active management of the land bank and 
work in progress, the Group has increased its capital turn.  
The combination of improved profitability and increased capital 
turn has delivered a strong improvement in the Group’s return 
on capital employed.
Bovis Homes aims to be a quality housebuilder delivering 
high returns generated from a strong land bank, much of it 
strategically sourced, and quality homes sold at a premium 
price. In order to deliver improved returns, the following  
clear strategic objectives for 2013 were set out and have  
been delivered:
• Increase operating profits
• Enhance future returns through targeted land investment
• Improve efficiency of capital employed
As a result of delivering against these three strategic objectives, 
the Group has achieved a significant increase in return on 
capital employed to 10.4% in 2013 from 7.7% in 2012.
Additionally the Group has focused on the following objectives:
• Deliver strong health, safety and environmental standards
• Deliver a strong customer service experience
Increase operating profits
Operating profit increased in 2013 by 46% to £82.8 million, 
as a result of the compound positive effect of an increased 
volume of legal completions sold at a higher average sales price 
generating a stronger profit margin. 
During 2013, the Group achieved 2,773 private reservations, 
a 48% increase on the 1,873 achieved in 2012. Net private 
sales per site per week increased by 34% to 0.59 (2012: 0.44), 
as a result of the improving quality of the Group’s active sales 
outlets and the benefit of a recovering housing market. Active 
sales outlets averaged 90 during 2013, an increase of 10% on 
the 82 achieved during 2012. 
One effect of the positive sales rate was that some sites were 
completed more quickly than expected. Also certain sites were 
launched later than anticipated due to planning delays.  
These two factors led to the Group achieving a marginally 
lower average number of active sales outlets than had been 
expected at the start of 2013.
The higher level of private reservations enabled the Group to 
deliver a 26% increase in private legal completions to 2,330 
(2012: 1,854), as well as carrying forward a significantly 
enhanced private forward order book of 692 private reservations, 
up from 249 at the beginning of 2013. This improved forward 
order book will support the Group’s volume ambitions for 
2014 and enable the Group to deliver a more balanced profile 
of legal completions through the year, with an increased 
proportion of its full year legal completions in the first half. 
Additionally, this will assist in improving the working capital 
cycle of the Group through the year.
During 2013, the Group supported new customers accessing 
the housing market using the Government’s Help to Buy 
shared equity scheme. In the year new homes were handed 
over to 872 customers who were able to use shared equity 
products, including the Help to Buy scheme, as part of their 
home purchase. During 2012, shared equity products (including 
Government backed schemes) were used to support customers 
buying 535 new homes. The Group sees the Help to Buy scheme 
as an attractive replacement for other shared equity products.
483 social homes were legally completed in 2013 (2012: 501), 
constituting 17% of total legal completions (2012: 21%).  
The Group decided to prioritise private build over social, 
particularly during Q4 2013, to ensure that private production 
was not constrained by tightness in the supply of sub-contract 
labour or materials lead times. At the beginning of 2014 the 
Group held 685 forward social reservations (2013: 529).
In aggregate the Group delivered 2,813 legal completions in 
2013, a 19% increase on the 2,355 in 2012. To support this 
significant increase in new home delivery, the Group increased 
its construction output in 2013 by 26% to 2,935 homes  
(2012: 2,322). Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  17
Strategy delivery is on track with further growth in 
returns supported by land investment
The Group achieved a 13% increase in private average sales price 
to £212,700 in 2013 (2012: £188,700). This has been driven 
primarily by changes in the Group’s product mix of private legal 
completions with an increase in larger traditional two storey homes 
and a decrease in townhouses. The Group considers that in its 
areas of operation sales prices have increased by between 2% and 
3% with stronger gains in the south of England offset by modest 
movements in the midlands and north of England. Including 
social homes, the Group’s average sales price was 14% higher at 
£195,100 (2012: £170,700).
Housing gross margin increased from 22.6% in 2012 to 23.5% 
in 2013, resulting from the increased contribution from legal 
completions on stronger margin sites acquired post the housing 
market downturn. This margin progression was impacted by the 
planned incremental year on year cost of circa £3.5 million to 
promote strategic land assets. 
The housing gross margin was also affected for the first time in 
many years by increases in build costs, mainly from labour rates. 
Increased activity in the new homes market has led to demand for 
subcontract labour exceeding supply. As a result, subcontractors 
have seen the ability to renegotiate at higher rates. Given the 
timing of such increases, the Group has been able to limit the cost 
impact well within the benefit from increasing sales prices.
As a result of the compound positive effect of volume growth, 
higher average sales price and improved gross profit margin, 
housing gross profit increased by 41% to £130.2 million  
(2012: £92.1 million). With overheads well controlled, the 
operating margin increased to 14.9% (2012*: 13.3%).
Enhance future returns through targeted  
land investment
The Group applies rigorous criteria for the acquisition of consented 
land, reflecting not only the anticipated margin and return on capital, 
but also site specific risks and geographic concentration risk.
2013 was a successful year for land investment. The Group continued 
to invest in high quality consented land assets, retaining its focus on 
specific areas of search in the south of England and prime locations 
in the midlands and northwest. During the year the Group added 
3,737 plots on 27 sites to the consented land bank at a cost of  
£225 million (2012: 2,651 consented plots at a cost of £161 million). 
The plots added have an estimated future revenue of £841 million 
and an estimated future gross profit potential of £216 million, based 
on current sales prices and current build costs, and are expected to 
deliver a gross margin of over 25% and a ROCE well in excess of  
the Group’s 20% hurdle rate. A further circa 2,800 plots on 12  
sites were contracted at the end of 2013, awaiting satisfaction of 
legal conditions. 
In 2014 to date, circa 2,300 consented plots on nine sites have been 
added to the consented land bank, many of these plots arising from 
the successful completion of the contracts secured during 2013.
Included in the sites added to date in 2014 is a major new settlement 
at Sherford in Devon, where the Group owns 1,658 consented 
plots. The land cost of this site is very low, due to the high level of 
infrastructure spend which is phased over the life of the site. As a 
result, the peak funding on this long term major project is expected 
to be between 1% and 2% of the Group’s net assets. Sherford will 
be an anchor site within the South West region over many years and 
is expected to deliver a strong margin and an excellent return on 
capital employed.
The consented land bank amounted to 14,638 plots as at 31 
December 2013 (2012: 13,776). The Group estimates that the gross 
profit potential on these consented plots at the 2013 year end, based 
on current sales prices and current build costs, was £727 million with 
a gross margin of 24.2% (2012: £600 million at 22.7%).
At the year end, the consented land bank included 9,197 consented 
plots (63% of total), which have been acquired since the housing 
market downturn (2012: 7,368 plots and 54% of total). The average 
consented land plot cost was £45,800 at the start of 2013 and 
increased over the year to £48,900, as a result of a lower number 
of written down plots held in the land bank (10% of land plots 
versus 13% at the start of the year) and the addition of new prime 
traditional housing sites where the average plot cost is higher.
The strategic land bank at 31 December 2013 contained 20,108 
potential plots (2012: 19,318). The Group converted circa 1,200 
plots of strategic land having achieved consent during 2013. The 
Group has continued to invest in new strategic land assets to assist in 
replenishing its consented land bank at strong margins in the future.
In addition, the Group has secured resolution to grant planning 
consent on three of its major strategic land assets at Winnersh, 
Witney and Bishops Stortford. These sites will deliver in aggregate 
over 1,200 consented plots at a significant discount to market 
value. Planning consents will be formally released once the planning 
agreements for each site are signed. Good progress continues to be 
made on a number of other major strategic projects, where material 
promotion costs are being incurred to achieve planning consents. 
This is expected to deliver significant numbers of consented plots 
over the next few years.
Improve efficiency of capital employed
Improving capital turn is critical to the Group’s ability to deliver 
material growth in return on capital employed. Capital turn  
has continued to improve from 0.5 in 2011 to 0.7 in 2013.  
The consented land bank is the key element of capital employed. 
While this has grown in size with the investments made by the 
Group, the average number of plots per active sales outlet has 
continued to decrease from 188 in 2011 to 158 in 2013.  
The average number of plots per site acquired in 2013 was  
138 plots, compared to 147 in 2012. 18  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Strategic report  |  Our performance
Work in progress turn increased to 2.7 times in 2013 from 
2.5 in 2012. Notional units of production at the end of 2013 
increased to 1,040 (2012: 918), as a result of the increase in 
active sales outlets and to facilitate higher legal completion 
volumes in the first half of 2014 over the first half of 2013. 
The value of work in progress has increased to £202.3 million 
from £172.7 million.
With the land investment undertaken to date and the strength 
of the ongoing land pipeline, the output capacity of the 
business is expected to increase. On the basis of current 
market conditions, capital turn should improve further in 2014 
and beyond.
Deliver strong health, safety and  
environmental standards
The Group is committed to delivering strong health and safety 
standards for its employees, subcontractors and other site 
visitors. It maintains a high level of organisational focus on its 
health and safety regime through comprehensive staff training, 
clear and accountable management processes and through 
regular and transparent reporting of performance. 
This is overseen, firstly, through the operational line, which 
takes day to day accountability for this area and, secondly, via 
a Group-wide oversight committee with nominated regional 
directors responsible for safety, run by the Group Director of 
Health and Safety and chaired by a senior Group manager. 
The Group also seeks to ensure that all of its employees and 
subcontractors who operate at or visit sites carry a CSCS card, 
indicating its commitment to a fully trained workforce. 
As the Group increased its build activity by 26% during 2013, 
the health and safety risk incidence rate across the business 
was maintained positively at 22.4 (2012: 23.1), the lower 
rate meaning stronger performance. This reflects a robust 
performance given the magnitude of the increase in employee 
numbers and subcontractor population during the year. 
The Group set itself challenging targets at the start of 
2013 with the ambition to further reduce health and safety 
risk incidence over a five year period. Disappointingly, the 
performance of the Group in the first year of this five year 
period was behind target. The Group continues to develop 
its health and safety processes and controls with the aim 
of improving performance in line with the targets set for 
2014. Health and safety will remain a key focus for regional, 
divisional and Group management.
The Group continues to regard sustainable development as 
critical to the long term creation of value for its shareholders. 
The housebuilding industry has an important role to play both 
in mitigating the impact of its building activities on the local 
environment and in the evolution of building techniques  
and advances, which reduce the carbon usage from new  
build developments.
During 2013, the Group has continued to focus on waste in 
order to drive down the quantity of waste produced in building 
a home. The quantity of active waste generated per home in 
2013 remained at 3.1 tonnes and the amount sent to landfill 
was reduced by 12%.
The Group works with a range of external stakeholders to 
agree and carry out development in a mutually acceptable 
manner, thereby ensuring that its developments take place in 
a way which mitigates the impact on the local environment, 
thereby balancing the needs of local communities for new 
housing with the requirement to avoid environmental damage.
Looking forward, the Group is focusing on ways to ensure 
that its products conform to good environmental standards, 
including the Code for Sustainable Homes. During 2013,  
1,036 of the Group’s homes were constructed to at least  
Code 3 of the Code for Sustainable Homes. Reflecting the 
existing contribution that the Group makes to the communities 
and environments in which it operates, the Group is  
pleased to report that it continues to be a member of  
the FTSE4Good index.
Given the nature of our business, scope of operations in  
the UK, business relationships, supply chains and labour 
practices we have not included information specifically about 
human rights in this report. We have an Ethical Code of 
Conduct and an Equal Opportunities policy which recognise 
the importance of high standards and treating our employees 
fairly. All policies can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk.
Further details of the Group’s efforts and achievements during 
2013 in regards to Corporate Social Responsibility will be 
published in a separate report, available from the Company’s 
website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk).
Deliver a strong customer service experience 
for Bovis Homes customers
The Group is focused on delivering its customers a high quality 
home alongside a good level of service through the period the 
customer is buying the home and thereafter as the customer 
enjoys their new home. During 2013, 93% of customers 
reported that they would recommend Bovis Homes to a friend 
and this was reinforced by the award during February 2013 
of a five star customer satisfaction rating by the Home Builder 
Federation. During the course of 2013, the Group’s score in 
the Home Builder Federation customer satisfaction survey has 
dropped marginally below the 90% benchmark for the five 
star rating at 89%. 
Whilst remaining a robust customer satisfaction score, the 
Group was disappointed to see this deterioration in its external 
customer satisfaction rating and the gap which has opened 
between this external score and the customers’ response to the 
Group’s internal customer satisfaction survey.

The Group has reinforced its Customer Journey processes  
across the business with the view to improving its customer 
satisfaction performance.
The focus of the Group’s customer communication has remained 
digitally based during 2013, with the Group using the power of 
the internet to directly market its products to consumers, utilising 
internally generated mailing lists as well as via intermediaries such 
as Rightmove and Zoopla. Over 70% of customer enquires originate 
via the web.
IT connectivity is provided to the sales operations, enabling efficient 
and effective customer communication and the utilisation of an 
integrated CRM system. The selling process is supported by the 
Group’s bespoke prospect management system, which delivers 
on-site technology whilst integrating the Group’s prospect database 
with brochure fulfilment.
Employee diversity
The following table shows the gender split within the Group as  
at 31 December 2013. At Bovis Homes, 65% of the workforce is 
male, a relatively common proportion in the construction and 
housebuilding industries. While a lower proportion of senior 
management and directors are female, the Group encourages  
and supports gender diversity. As at 31 December 2013, there  
were five senior managers (all male) who were directors of  
Group subsidiaries.

Structure
In anticipation of increasing activity levels in 2014 and beyond,  
the Group is now operating from six regions in two divisions with  
plans for two further regions to become operational in the 
foreseeable future (previously the Group operated through a three 
region structure). This new structure will provide the Group with a 
business capacity of between 4,000 and 5,000 homes per annum, 
whilst maintaining close alignment to the localities in which it 
operates with significant local knowledge. The geographical focus 
of the Group remains exactly as before, being in the south of 
England and in prime locations in the midlands and northwest. 
Although this change will lead to a limited increase in the Group’s 
overhead expenditure in absolute terms, overhead efficiency is 
expected to continue to improve in 2014 and beyond.
The two divisions, South and Central, are led by Divisional 
Managing Directors, Malcolm Pink and Keith Carnegie respectively. 
The strength and experience of the Group’s existing senior 
management is demonstrated by six of the eight regional managing 
directors being internal appointments.
The Board
Colin Holmes has decided to retire from the Board at the 2014 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 16 May 2014 after seven 
and a half years as a non-executive director and seven years as 
Remuneration Committee chairman. The Board would like to thank 
Colin for his valuable contribution during his time on the Board. 
Alastair Lyons will succeed as Remuneration Committee chairman 
following the AGM.
Market conditions
Housing market conditions improved materially during 2013.  
An increase in the number of mortgage products including a 
greater availability of high loan to value mortgages has supported  
a greater number of housing transactions. Bank of England 
mortgage approvals statistics show a significant increase during  
the second half of 2013 with monthly figures approaching a level 
more reflective of a healthy housing market.
Homebuyer confidence appears to have improved materially 
with more positive views on the future direction of house prices, 
employment and security of earnings. With this improving 
backdrop, trading conditions are expected to remain broadly 
positive during 2014, supporting sales rates and sales prices. 
House prices have been rising at a modest rate across many 
regional markets with stronger rises in the south of England, offset 
by more modest changes in the midlands and north of England.  
As expected, with activity and sales prices rising, the cost of 
building houses is also rising as material suppliers enjoy increased 
demand for their products and subcontractors see an ability to 
increase rates.
The Government’s Help to Buy shared equity product, launched in 
April 2013, has provided strong impetus to the new build industry, 
supporting first time buyers in particular. The Help to Buy mortgage 
indemnity product was also launched in Q4 2013 and, given it 
assists not just new build customers, the Group considers this 
Government backed product to be further support to activity in the 
wider housing market.
As a result of the positive activity in the housing market, the 
support provided to banks to facilitate cost effective mortgage 
lending via the Government’s Funding for Lending Scheme is  
being withdrawn. The Group views this development positively, as 
it signals that the mortgage market is beginning to operate more 
effectively without assistance. Current trading
The Group entered 2014 with a forward sales order position of 
1,377 homes, a 77% improvement on the 778 homes brought 
forward at the start of 2013. Of these, 692 were private homes 
(2013: 249) and 685 were social (2013: 529).
The Group has delivered 468 private reservations in the 
first seven weeks of 2014 (2013: 285), an increase of 64%. 
Operating from an average of 93 active sales outlets during this 
period (2013: 90), the Group has achieved a sales rate per site 
per week of 0.72, a 60% improvement on the 0.45 achieved in 
the comparable period in 2013. Sales prices achieved on these 
private reservations to date have been ahead of the Group’s 
expectations by circa 2%.
As at 21 February 2014, the Group held 1,875 sales for legal 
completion in 2014, as compared to 1,064 sales at the same 
point in 2013, an increase of 76%. Of these, private sales 
amounted to 1,160 homes (2013: 534), with social housing 
sales of 715 homes (2013: 530).
Build to Rent scheme – private rental sector
In 2012, the Government announced its Build to Rent scheme, 
with the intention of providing funding support to assist in 
the establishment of PRS vehicles. Whilst not yet contracted, 
the Group has agreed terms and is at an advanced stage in 
finalising agreements to deliver new homes under two separate 
PRS transactions on sites owned by the Group, each using 
support from the Government’s scheme.
The two transactions involve approximately 500 homes, of 
which circa 250 would legally complete in 2014 with the 
remainder in 2015. The profit delivery combined with the 
acceleration of capital turn enabled by these transactions would 
act as a further positive contributor to increasing the Group’s 
return on capital employed in both 2014 and 2015.
Outlook
The successful continued execution of the growth strategy in 
2013 has positioned the Group strongly to continue to grow  
in 2014 and beyond.
The sales achieved in 2014 to date combined with the expected 
growth in active sales outlets should enable the Group to 
deliver a strong increase in total reservations during 2014, 
assuming current market conditions continue. From these 
reservations excluding any potential volume arising from the 
PRS transactions (250 homes in 2014), the Group aims to 
deliver between 3,400 and 3,600 legal completions in 2014 
and a stronger forward order book for 2015.
This legal completion volume will represent major growth in 
the Group’s output and will require a material increase in build 
activity compared to 2013. During a period of constrained 
capacity in the material and labour supply markets, build costs 
for 2014 legal completions are expected to increase by between 
3% and 5%. However with a continuing tight focus on the 
Group’s operational performance, market rises in sales prices 
are expected to at least cover such cost increases.
The Group expects further growth in the proportion of legal 
completions from post downturn sites to increase both the 
average sales price and housing gross margin in 2014.  
When combined with improving overhead efficiency, the 
operating margin is expected to increase to approximately 17%.
With a clear focus on controlling the capital employed of the 
Group through management of the land bank and control 
of working capital, improving capital turn is expected to be 
at least 0.8 in 2014. Based on current market conditions 
continuing and excluding any potential volume arising for the 
PRS transactions, the Group expects to deliver a strong increase 
in return on capital employed to at least 14% in 2014 with the 
expectation of further progress thereafter.

Chairman’s statement
Introduction
In what has been a further period of 
economic challenges, I am pleased 
to report satisfactory operating results 
for the year in line with expectations.
It is our well established strategy to move 
the balance of Group revenue to Specialist 
Engineering, which now accounts for 44% 
compared with 15% four years ago. This 
strategy remains valid with both revenue 
and 	profit 	from 	Specialist 	Engineering	 having	
increased annually over the past four years. 
Results
Group revenue for the year ended 
30 September 2010 was £290.4m 
(2009: 	£316.6m).	 Profit 	before	income	
tax for the year prior to exceptional items 
and amortisation charges was £4.6m 
(2009: 	£5.5m).	Profit 	after 	tax, 	 exceptional 	
items and amortisation charges was 
£2.7m (2009: £0.4m).
The Group remains debt free and at 
30 September 2010 the Group’s net 
cash position was £16.2m (2009: £14.6m). 
Specialist Engineering revenue increased 
by 11% to £127.4m (2009: £114.8m) and 
operating	profit 	prior	 to	exceptional	items 	
and amortisation charges increased by 4% 
to £4.2m (2009: £4.0m). 
In Specialist Building revenue reduced in 
the year to £163.1m (2009: £202.4m) with 
operating	profit 	prior	 to	exceptional	items 	
and amortisation charges of £1.8m 
(2009: £2.5m). 
The Group’s contracted order book at 
30 September 2010 increased by 50% to 
£304m (2009: £202m) and includes 70% 
of revenue secured for 2011 (2009: 59%). 
87% of orders received were in our specialist 
sectors with 63% of engineering orders in 
regulated sectors. 
Office of Fair Trading Investigation 
The result of our appeal remains outstanding 
and during the year an exceptional charge 
of £0.3m has been incurred in respect of 
legal costs.
Dividend
The 	Board	 is	proposing	 to 	 maintain	the	 final 	
dividend at 2.0p per share. This will provide 
an annual dividend of 3.0p (2009: 3.0p). 
The dividend will be paid on 24 February 
2011 to shareholders on the register as 
at 28 January 2011. 
Strategy
Our strategy remains to focus on two distinct 
business streams, Specialist Engineering 
and Specialist Building, progressively moving 
the balance of Group revenue towards 
Specialist Engineering. Our aim is to increase 
revenue in Specialist Engineering both 
organically and by acquisition, whilst 
maintaining operating margins of 3% to 4%. 
In Specialist Building we aim to maintain 
profitability of at least 1% at the operating 
level with a longer term target of 2% as and 
when markets improve.
“It is our well established strategy to move 
the balance of Group revenue to Specialist 
Engineering, which now accounts for 44% 
compared with 15% four years ago. This 
strategy remains valid with both revenue 
and profit from Specialist Engineering 
having increased annually over the past 
four years.”

Chairman’s statement
In Specialist Engineering, the Group seeks 
to exploit its specialist skills in a range of 
industries which offer sustainable earnings 
opportunities and have high barriers to entry. 
In Specialist Building, our focus will remain 
on selectively accessing opportunities in 
targeted markets where we have knowledge 
and experience both of our client and of 
similar projects. 
These operational strategies combine 
to reduce risk and to enhance quality of 
earnings. Our medium term objective is 
to develop a Specialist Engineering and 
Construction Services Group with overall 
operating 	 profits	 of 	 over 	 2% 	 and 	 with	
Specialist Engineering providing at least 
50% of Group revenue by 2012.
Outlook
The Board’s analysis of the impact of the 
Comprehensive Spending Review on our 
activities is that it will be limited. After taking 
this 	 into 	 account, 	 the 	 Board 	 remains 	 confident 	
that the Group will continue to deliver a resilient 
performance in the medium term and is 
positioned to take advantage of opportunities 
when economic conditions improve.
Renew is well positioned with a debt free 
balance sheet, substantial cash resources 
and 	a	strong 	confirmed 	order	 book.	 As	a	
result, the Board expects that the Group will 
return to growth in both revenue and 
operating	 profits 	 in	2011.

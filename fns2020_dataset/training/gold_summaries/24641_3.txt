 Chairman’s statement
Positive results
Summary
Your Board is pleased to report a set of 
encouraging results for 2016 which reflects 
the continued progress in building the portfolio 
of capacity on syndicates at Lloyd’ s to generate 
profits for shareholders. The profits before 
goodwill and impairment for the year were 
£1,334,000 (2015: £753,000), whilst the 
adjusted net asset value of the Group is 
£1.96 per share (2015: £2.01).
Underwriting profits from the two older 
underwriting years, the “off-risk” years, made 
a good contribution but the 2016 underwriting 
year in its first 12 months recognised a loss. 
Other income arising from fees from reinsurers 
and investment income has increased this year. 
T otal costs reduced to £1.8m as the expenditure 
on protecting the portfolio using stop loss 
reinsurance was rationalised.
Strategy
We have continued to implement our strategy 
of building the portfolio of syndicate capacity. 
During 2016 the key developments were the:
 » raising of £5.7m of new capital for the 
acquisition of further limited liability vehicles 
(“LLVs”) and enabling the broadening of the 
shareholder base; and
 » £3.9m of the funds raised have been 
utilised to date.
Underwriting result
The calendar year underwriting profits for 2016 
have been generated from results recognised 
in the portfolio from the 2014 to the 2016 
underwriting years as follows:

Helios retained profits

2014 1,661 939
2015 1,031 5
2016 (484) —
2,208 2,218
During 2016, the 2014 underwriting year 
mid-point estimate increased from 8.7% 
return on capacity to a final result of 15.6%. 
The overall return on capacity for 2014 
benefited from the weaker £/US$ exchange 
rate that weakened by 20% in 2016 and from 
below average loss activity. The mid-point 
estimate for the 2015 underwriting year at 
31 December 2016 was 8.2%. This mid-point 
estimate for 2015 has improved to 9.8% 
with the release of updated estimates.
The level of major claims for the whole of 
Lloyd’s during 2016 at £2.1bn was the fifth 
highest since the turn of the century and 
above the long-term average. These losses 
were incurred mainly as a result of Hurricane 
Capacity acquired
During 2016 a further three corporate members were acquired that increased the capacity for 
the 2014 to 2016 years of account, and a further two corporate members have been bought 
since 31 December 2016. These companies have increased the capacity underwritten on the 
2014 to 2017 underwriting years as shown below.
Year of account – £m
2014 2015 2016 2017
Capacity at 1 January 2016 29.2 26.8 28.1 —
Acquired during 2016 6.3 5.4 5.6 — 
Capacity at 31 December 2016 35.5 32.2 33.7 32.6
Acquired to date in 2017 — 2.2 2.2 2.4
Current total capacity 35.5 34.4 35.9 35.0
These five acquisitions in 2016 and 2017 to date were purchased for a total consideration 
of £8.7m, of which £3.9m was committed from the funds raised from shareholders.
• Adjusted net asset value at 
£1.96 per share (2015: £2.01) 
• Three acquisitions in 2016 
added £5.6m of capacity to 2016 
underwriting year – 20% increase
• Two acquisitions agreed in 2017 
will add £2.4m of capacity to 2017 
underwriting year – an additional 
7% increase
• 5.5p per share total dividend 
payable (2015: 5.0p)
Acquisition strategy continues 
to build the fund of capacity.
We have continued 
to implement our 
strategy of building 
the portfolio of 
syndicate capacity.
Sir Michael Oliver 
Non-executive Chairman Matthew, the earthquake in Japan in April 2016 
and the Fort McMurray Wildfire in Canada. 
Consequently, the 2016 underwriting year 
result in the first 12 months retained by Helios 
made a negative contribution mainly arising 
from this claims experience. The underwriting 
environment remains competitive and pressure 
to reduce underwriting terms and conditions 
is prevalent within most classes of business. 
Nevertheless, we would expect the 2016 
underwriting year to be profitable and early 
indications from the managing agents of the 
syndicates in the portfolio are currently 
forecasting a mid-point estimate of profit 
on capacity of 3.5%.
The underwriting results will remain exposed 
to movements in £/US$ exchange rate due 
to significant underlying US$ exposure.
Other income
Helios generates fees from the quota share 
reinsurers, investment income from the Group 
funds at Lloyd’s and foreign exchange gains.
2016
£’000
2015
£’000
Fees from reinsurers 557 385
Investment income 347 91
Total other income 904 476
Fees and profit commission from reinsurers 
have increased as the capital committed has 
risen to £13m and as the 2014/15 years are 
recognising increased profits. The Group 
Funds at Lloyd’s are invested to produce 
consistent long-term returns. 
Total costs
The costs of the Group comprise the operating 
expenses and the cost of the stop loss 
protection bought to mitigate the downside 
from large underwriting losses. 
2016
£’000
2015
£’000
Pre-acquisition 63 200
Stop loss costs 248 407
Operating costs 1,467 1,334
Total costs 1,778 1,941
The reduction in the stop loss costs reflects 
the rationalisation of the stop loss reinsurance 
policies acquired in 2016. 
Adjusted net asset value per share
The Board views the adjusted net asset value 
per share (“ANAV”) as the key metric to measure 
the success of the Group. It measures the 
combination of the net tangible asset value 
of Helios and the current market value of the 
portfolio of syndicate capacity. The building 
of a portfolio of participations on leading 
Lloyd’s syndicates remains the strategic 
objective of the Group.
2016
£’000
2015
£’000
Net tangible assets 11,787 7,912
Group letters of credit 1,922 1,447
Weighted average 
value of capacity 14,918 11,762
28,627 21,121
Shares in issue 14,604 10,495
Adjusted net asset 
value per share (£) 1.96 2.01
The issue of shares in the year to raise 
additional funds has restricted the growth in 
ANAV per share. Previously the Board relied 
on the Humphrey’ s valuation that approached 
the valuation in a very similar way and the ANAV 
of £1.99 per share was published last year.
Dividend
Following another successful year, the Board 
is pleased to recommend that the final dividend 
remains the same as last year at 1.5p per 
share which, together with a special dividend 
of 4.0p per share (2015: 3.5p), totals 5.5p 
per share (2015: 5.0p). The special dividend 
equates to approximately 20% of the £3m 
cash released from the 2014 year of account. 
These dividends will be payable to shareholders 
on the register on 9 June 2017. If approved, 
the dividend will be paid in a single payment 
on 7 July 2017. 
Outlook
Our strategy of providing access to insurance 
exposures at Lloyd’s continues to develop. 
We see opportunities to both develop access 
to syndicates at Lloyd’s and to build on the 
structure for participation by private capital.
Although the 2015 underwriting year is 
expected to produce a good result, early 
indications for the 2016 underwriting year 
show lower returns on capacity. We see 
lower expected profitability as an opportunity 
to continue to build the portfolio of capacity 
by purchasing LLUs at reduced prices.
Board 
This is my final set of annual results as 
Chairman, and in the years since we 
launched the Company in 2007 we have 
substantially grown the portfolio of capacity 
and our financial strength. I am delighted 
that Michael Cunningham is taking over 
the role of Chairman.

Growth drivers
Brilinta/Brilique revenue rose by 70%  
to $476 million
Diabetes franchise revenue rose by 
139% to $1,870 million, aided in part  
by the acquisition of BMS’s share  
of the diabetes alliance, a strong  
US Farxiga launch and good uptake  
of Bydureon Pen
Oncology became the sixth growth 
platform in January 2015; several 
potential submissions in 2015 to 2016; 
and expected to contribute largest 
proportion of pipeline-driven revenue 
growth, with potential to grow to 
one-quarter of sales by 2023
Respiratory franchise revenue rose  
by 10% to $5,063 million, with strong 
Symbicort performance in the US
Value creation through science-led 
R&D, collaborations and licensing, such 
as the BACE inhibitor alliance with Lilly 
for Alzheimer’s disease

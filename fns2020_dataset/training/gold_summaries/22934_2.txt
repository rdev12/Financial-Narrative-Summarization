Diploma PLC uses alternative performance 
measures as key financial indicators to assess the 
underlying performance of the Group. These 
include adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit 
before tax, adjusted earnings per share, free cash 
flow, trading capital employed and return on 
adjusted trading capital employed (“ROATCE”). 
The narrative in the Annual Report & Accounts  
is based on these alternative measures and  
an explanation is set out in note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements included  
in the Annual Report & Accounts on page 68.

Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Chief Executive’s Review
Highlights of 2003
This year’s results show the resilience 
of our recurring revenue business 
model, together with beneﬁts of the 
cost reduction in 2002. Whilst 2003 was 
a tough year for software businesses, 
with clients’ budgets remaining very 
tight, we have been able to increase 
revenues by 17% to £8.4 million (2002: 
£7.2 million). At the same time we 
have achieved our ﬁrst pre-tax proﬁt 
of £0.1 million (2002: loss of £2.4 
million). It is perhaps more signiﬁcant 
that whilst managing this expansion 
we have generated an operating 
cash inﬂow for 2003 of £1.6 million, 
against an operating cash outﬂow of 
£0.5 million for 2002. 
Regional Performance and Outlook
Sales of our products were made in 
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, 
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Singapore, South Africa, the US and 
the UK. In total there were 39 sales 
including 24 contract extensions.   
Although the absolute level of additional 
sales was lower than in 2002, our 
cancellation rate was also lower. This 
reﬂects the change in culture amongst 
clients from the more aggressive cost 
reductions in 2002, to a more balanced 
approach in 2003, with the lower sales 
reﬂecting their reluctance to take on 
new projects but a willingness to stick 
with existing operations.
We believe that optimism has replaced 
pessimism with the majority of our 
clients. However, we still believe that 
in the short term this may result only in 
increased “window shopping”, rather 
than a signiﬁcant increase in projects. 
That being the case, we are approaching 
2004 with caution and a clear focus on 
cost control, whilst ensuring we remain 
well-positioned to respond positively 
to growth opportunities.
Acquisition
In October 2003, we acquired a 51% 
stake in RiskMap Srl (renamed StatPro 
Italia) and have an option to buy the 
remaining 49% between 31 December 
2006 and 31 December 2013. StatPro 
Italia has two key products – StatPro 
Risk Management (SRM) and StatPro 
Portfolio Insurance (SPI). These have 
been integrated with our Data Hub 
and are being actively promoted to 
our clients and prospects. In February 
2004, we signed our ﬁrst new client for 
SRM and we have built a signiﬁcant 
pipeline of prospects for the product. 
Clients have responded positively to 
SRM and SPI and we believe that both 
products will be successful.
Strategy
Our strategy remains to provide our 
clients with the best value possible 
for their portfolio analysis needs. By 
developing and building on our original 
systems, we now offer a product 
structure that can be conﬁgured to 
suit the needs of any type of asset 
manager, large or small. 
The core of the product strategy is 
the StatPro Data Hub (SDH), which 
centralises, cleans and prepares all 
the data required for analysis. On 
top of SDH, ﬁve other products can 
be added: StatPro Performance & 
Attribution (SPA), StatPro Composites 
(SC), StatPro Risk Management 
(SRM), StatPro Portfolio Insurance 
(SPI) and StatPro Fixed Income (SFI). 
These products produce a very wide 
range of analysis that covers the 
majority of current needs of most 
asset managers. 
At the start of 2004, we implemented 
two revenue sharing partnership 
agreements to create a new reporting 
platform. The ﬁrst is with Artech SA 
(France) to create StatPro Enterprise 
Reports (SER) and the second is with

success
Delve Ltd (UK) to make StatPro Web 
Management (SWM). Rather than 
seeking to build or buy reporting 
solutions, we have taken this route so 
that we can offer our clients a “best 
of breed” range of reporting systems 
that can handle the speciﬁc needs 
of asset managers, whether they are 
hedge funds, private banks, mutual 
fund companies or institutional asset 
managers. By layering these products 
over our data hub and analytics products, 
clients can automate every aspect of 
their reporting requirements.
As asset managers seek to rationalise 
costs and improve their internal 
systems, we believe they will work with 
suppliers who can provide the best 
platform with the broadest array of 
analysis modules. StatPro’s approach 
of acquiring market leading products 
and integrating them through the 
StatPro Data Hub provides both a 
“best of breed” and an integrated 
solution. Therefore, we should be 
well placed to take advantage of any 
upturn in the market.
Market Survey
Shareholders will be pleased to learn 
that a recent independent survey 
conducted by the Spaulding Group 
put StatPro top of the list of 33 
suppliers for Composite, Performance 
and Attribution systems in response 
to the question: “Which three sup-
pliers would you consider in your 
system selection?” We believe that 
this reflects not only our success in 
selling over 150 systems but also 
the quality of our reputation in our 
market place. We are determined to 
maintain our position.
Summary
We achieved our two objectives for 
2003 of generating positive operating 
cash ﬂow and making a proﬁt and 
I would like to thank all the staff 
and directors for all their hard work 
during 2003. However, 2003 was 
difﬁcult and 2004 could also prove 
a challenge. Our objectives for 2004 
are to increase proﬁts and to generate 
further operating cashﬂow. We will 
launch our new reporting platform 
and aim to win clients for each of 
our new products, concentrating on 
building our core revenues through 
organic growth. By strengthening the 
ﬁnancial position of StatPro we hope 
to be in a position to take advantage 
of any opportunities that may occur 
in the market.

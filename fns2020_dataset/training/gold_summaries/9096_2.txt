Welcome to Kemin Resources Plc 
//Strategic report
Kemin Resources Plc (AIM:KEM) is an 
exploration and development company; 
its principal mining assets are located in 
northern Kazakhstan.
Kemin Resources Plc (AIM: KEM) was formed into its present structure  
in May 2013 with the reverse take-over of GMA Resources plc by the  
Joint Venture Kazakh-Russian Mining Company LLP (KRMC).
The Company is focussed on developing its two molybdenum and tungsten 
deposits – Drozhilovskoye and Smirnovskoye. Each of the deposits is assessed 
to have significant value.
Kemin’s 90% owned Kazakh entity, KRMC is the developer and future operator 
of the two subsoil licences that allows mining to take place at each deposit.
Both deposits are located in north west Kazakhstan.

Highlights
• Completion of £2.05m fundraising in June 2014 to advance the work 
programme, and supportive strategic shareholder in place to support 
ongoing activities.
• Drozhilovskoye and Smirnovskoye supported locally and have been 
included in State Programme on Accelerated Industrial Innovative 
Development (SPAIID).
• Progression of Competent Persons Report (CPR) to establish resources 
under JORC (2012). The final CPR results for both deposits are expected 
to be released in Q3 2015.
• Investigation underway as to the possibility of a one million tonne per 
year pilot plant as a quick route to cash flow.
• The Company has also reviewed its ongoing cost commitments and as 
one of the cost-cutting measures undertaken it was decided that it was 
not in the Company’s interests to retain the services of the joint broker 
Peat & Co., at the current time. Kemin Resources Plc  Annual Report 2014 01

The Drozhilovskoye molybdenum-tungsten 
deposit is located in the Denisovski rayon of 
the Kostanayskaya oblast, 55km north east of 
Zhitigara and 31km north west of the rayon 
centre, Denisovka. The small settlement of 
Okrainka lies some 4km from the deposit.
The deposit area covers approximately 6.6km
2
. 
In addition to the molybdenum and tungsten 
content, the deposit is also thought to contain 
quantities of bismuth, beryl, lithium, rubidium, 
caesium, copper, gold and silver.
Since the deposit was discovered in 1964, 
considerable exploration work has taken 
place culminating in the most recent resource 
statement undertaken in 2005 (using the 
former Soviet Union resource and reserve 
classification system common in Central  
Asia), which estimated a GKZ approved 
Category C1 and C2 resource estimate for 
the northern stockwork of 37.2Mt at 0.107% 
molybdenum and 0.086% tungsten trioxide. 
This assumed a 0.05% molybdenum equivalent 
cut-off grade. Importantly, the first resource 
estimate undertaken in 1974 defined a GKZ 
approved estimate for the whole deposit  
at a C2 category of approximately 140Mt  
at 0.188% molybdenum. Subsequently 
additional drilling has been done and  
the latest non JORC resource estimated  
is presented in the Chief Executive  
Officer’s report.

The Smirnovskoye molybdenum-tungsten-
copper deposit is located in the Karabalyksky 
rayon, 120km north west of the Kostanay oblast 
and some 41km north of Karabalyk, the district 
centre in northern Kazakhstan. The village  
of Smirnovka is in the immediate vicinity  
of the deposit. The deposit area covers 
approximately 13.7km
2
.
The deposit has been divided into  
a larger northern and a smaller southern  
zone. Within both zones, the principal ore 
mineral is molybdenite which is associated 
with chalcopyrite and pyrite. Other minerals 
are rare.
The deposit has been studied in less detail than 
Drozhilovskoye, although a 1996, GKZ approved, 
resource estimate produced a combined 
Category C1 and C2 resource for both the 
larger northern and smaller southern zones  
of approximately 109Mt at a grade of 0.1378% 
molybdenum using a 0.05% molybdenum 
equivalent cut-off grade.
A further estimate was undertaken in 2007 
which gave an estimate of 108Mt at a grade  
of 0.1056% molybdenum using the same  
cut-off grade. Subsequently, additional drilling 
has been undertaken and the latest non  
JORC resource estimated is presented  
in the Chief Executive Officer’s report.

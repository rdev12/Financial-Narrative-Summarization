After my first year as Chairman, I am pleased  
to report that 2014 has been another year of 
sales and earnings growth for Elementis. Since 
becoming Chairman I have enjoyed getting to 
know the Group through visits to our various 
sites around the globe, meeting our people and 
engaging with the management team and my 
fellow directors. I have found the Group to be 
well managed, with a clear strategy and people 
around the world who are hardworking, talented 
and enthusiastic about the Group and its 
prospects. 
In 2014, Group sales were $790.4 million, an 
improvement of 2 per cent over the previous 
year, largely driven by the further progress 
achieved in Specialty Products while Chromium 
and Surfactants delivered sales and cash 
generation in line with their respective strategies. 
Group operating profit* for the year was  
$150.1 million compared to $146.6 million in  
the previous year, whilst the Group’s operating 
margin* remained stable at 19 per cent. Diluted 
earnings per share* for the year improved by  
8 per cent to 24.8 cents. 
The Group is recording a number of pension, 
tax and legacy items under the heading 
‘Exceptional items’ in this year’s income 
statement. These items are discussed more fully 
in the Finance report on page 12. After taking 
account of these items, Group operating profit 
for the year was $156.4 million, compared to 
$144.9 million in the previous year, and diluted 
earnings per share was 37.7 cents, compared  
to 23.0 cents in 2013.
Balance sheet
One of the Group’s core strengths is its strong 
balance sheet, supported by positive cash  
flow generation. In 2014 this was once again 
demonstrated with the Group’s net cash 
position increasing from $54.1 million at the end 
of 2013 to $64.2 million at the end of 2014. This 
was achieved despite financing a robust capital 
expenditure programme and an additional one 
time UK pension contribution. Under our current 
dividend policy, this increase in net cash results 
in a similar increase in the special dividend. 
Once again the deficit on Group retirement 
plans, under IAS 19, improved in 2014, going 
from $99.3 million at the end of 2013 to $65.8 
million at the end of 2014. The improvement was 
largely the result of favourable asset returns and 
Company contributions.
Dividends
The Board is continuing with the dividend  
policy introduced in 2012, which is to pay 
approximately one third of earnings, before 
exceptional items, each year in a combination of 
interim and final dividends. In addition, a special 
dividend is paid each year of up to 50 per cent 
of the net cash balance at the end of the year, 
provided there are no immediate investment 
plans for that cash. Consequently, the Board is 
recommending a final dividend for 2014 of 5.75 
cents per share (2013: 5.50 cents) and a special 
dividend of 6.95 cents per share or $32.1 million 
(2013: 5.86 cents or $27.1 million). These will be 
paid on 22 May 2015, in pounds sterling at an 
exchange rate of £1.00:$1.5429 (equivalent to a 
sterling amount of 8.2313 pence per share), to 
shareholders on the register on 24 April 2015. 
This brings the total dividends for the year to 
15.40 cents per share (2013: 13.93 cents), 
representing an increase of 11 per cent over  
the previous year.

Health, safety and the environment
Since becoming Chairman, it has been 
gratifying to learn that the Group is achieving 
high standards of performance, compared  
to the industry, in this important area of our 
business and has developed a culture 
throughout the organisation that recognises  
that zero incidents must be the ultimate goal.  
As such, lessons learned from even the most 
minor incidents are used to continuously 
improve our processes and activities, ensuring 
that the protection of our employees and the 
environment remains a high priority.
Board changes
As previously announced, Ian Brindle and  
Kevin Matthews retired as Board members on 
15 December and 31 October 2014 respectively. 
Both Ian and Kevin were key members of  
the Board since their appointments in 2005. 
Kevin served as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee from April 2008 to September 2013, 
while Ian served as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, Senior Independent Director and, 
more recently, Chairman of the Board. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank both of them 
for their dedication and support during their 
tenure as Board members.
To replace Ian and Kevin, I am delighted to 
welcome Nick Salmon and Steve Good to the 
Board as from 20 October 2014. Both Nick  
and Steve have impressive backgrounds as 
successful executives and directors and I look 
forward to working closely with them in support 
of the Group’s continuing success.
 
Governance
The Board considers that it has applied all  
the principles and provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code (2012 version) in 2014, with 
one exception on audit tenders explained on 
page 28. Further information about this and 
other aspects of our governance arrangements 
are set out in the Corporate governance report 
on page 28.
People
The Group’s continued success is due in no 
small part to the hard work, dedication and skill 
of its people and I would therefore like to give 
them my sincere thanks on behalf of the Board.
 
Outlook
As the new Chairman, I have inherited a Group 
with a clear and ambitious strategy that focuses 
on profitable growth, attractive returns on capital 
and shareholder value. These are all themes 
that I wholly support and the Board is fully 
engaged in helping the Group to deliver on this 
strategy. The quality of our existing businesses, 
combined with its strong cash flow generation 
and balance sheet, ensures that we have both 
the platform and the flexibility to make progress 
and to pursue profitable opportunities, both 
organic and inorganic as they arise.

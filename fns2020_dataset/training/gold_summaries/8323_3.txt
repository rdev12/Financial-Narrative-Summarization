 Chairman’s statement
Last year I said we expected 2006 to be a year of further growth and 
I am glad to report that it was. In 2006 our profit from operations*
increased significantly from £536 million in 2005 to £773 million, an
improvement of 44% and earnings per share* (EPS) increased from 14.6p
to 22.4p, an improvement of 53%. In addition, free cash flow increased 
by 60% from £285 million in 2005 to £456 million in 2006.
In 2004, when we announced our first dividend payment, we stated
that our dividend policy was to commence paying a dividend
representing a pay-out ratio of 30% of pre-exceptional EPS progressing
towards a pay out of 40% in the medium-term. This year the Board is
proposing a dividend of 7.9p per share which reflects a pay-out ratio of
35%*, and an increase of 75% on last year’s payment.
The financial results reflect the good operational performance of 
our assets, the improvement in the UK and US merchant markets 
and the continued growth of the business. In 2006 we completed the
acquisition of a 40% interest in the 910 MW and 30 MIGD (gross)
Hidd power and water plant in Bahrain, the coal fired 632 MW Coleto
Creek power station in Texas, the 140 MW Indian Queens oil fired
peaking plant in Cornwall, UK and the 436 MW Levanto wind farm
portfolio, which has wind farms that are currently operating or under
construction in Germany and France plus further potential growth from
a pipeline of development opportunities. These acquisitions all met our
financial criteria whilst fitting in with our strategic aims. The Hidd
acquisition continued our growth in the Middle East in a new market for
us – Bahrain. Coleto Creek increased our presence in Texas and added
good fuel diversification. The Indian Queens peaking plant increased our
ability to provide system support. Levanto represented our first major
renewables business in Europe and, in addition to providing fuel
diversification, gives the business immediate scale and credibility in 
this increasingly important area of electricity generation.

and cash flow, and expansion 
by acquisitions and greenfield
developments. The business is
well placed for further growth 
in 2007.

testament to the strong leadership of the Chief Executive Officer, 
Phil Cox, and his executive team and the professionalism and efforts 
of all the Group’s employees. On your behalf I would like to thank them
all for their contribution to the continued success of the Company.
Whenever I visit our assets (and in 2006 I visited plants in Australia 
and the Middle East), I have been very impressed by the enthusiasm
demonstrated by the employees for our business and the obvious 
pride they all take in their work.
We take our commitment to safety very seriously. One of our core
values is to instil safe behaviour in everything we do. We therefore
decided to ask DuPont, an acknowledged world authority in this field, 
to carry out a safety review at a selection of our assets around the globe
to ensure that our commitment to excellent health and safety standards,
across our portfolio, is checked and challenged and that best practice 
is shared by all our plants. Health and safety is of vital importance in 
our business and therefore the accident frequency rate is one of the
non-financial key performance indicators we use in managing 
our business.
Once again, I would like to express my thanks to our Non-Executive
Directors, whose guidance, challenge and support continues to be
invaluable. During the year there were changes at Board level. Following
the retirement of Jack Taylor, as a Non-Executive Director, at last year’s
Annual General Meeting, John Roberts, formerly Chief Executive of
United Utilities plc, has been appointed as a Non-Executive Director.
John brings related power industry and international experience to the
Board and has already made a positive contribution to the business.
Our broadly based international portfolio has been strengthened by 
the successful integration of acquired assets and the addition of new
greenfield projects commissioned in 2006, and provides a solid platform
for our business. This, coupled with a largely forward contracted position
for our merchant capacity, gives us confidence that 2007 will be a year
of further growth. We will continue with our disciplined approach to
pursuing value enhancing growth opportunities in our core regions,
alongside our commitment to increase our dividend pay-out ratio 
over the medium-term.

Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  Annual Report 2014
19
2014 was another year of good 
growth across the business – both 
operationally and financially. AMS 
continues to progress as a leading, 
international provider of high quality, 
high value innovative and 
technologically advanced products 
for the woundcare and wound 
closure markets.
Operationally, the performance of 
LiquiBand® in the U.S. was 
particularly strong and we made 
considerable progress towards our 
goal of building a 20% market share. 
We also launched our LiquiBand® 
Fix8™ hernia mesh fixation device for 
use as a medical adhesive inside the 
body. This was an important 
development for the Group, opening 
up potential new markets as we seek 
to extend the application of our 
tissue adhesives to other internal 
procedures. 
Financially, we are pleased to  
report a 6% increase in revenue to 
£63.0 million (2013: £59.5 million), 
representing growth of 9% on a 
constant currency basis and an 
increase in adjusted profit
1
 before  
tax of 15% to £15.6 million  
(2013: £13.5 million). 
The Group continues to work on a 
number of significant opportunities 
to drive growth resulting from 
existing products and geographic 
markets as well as from new 
products in development.
The Group ended the year with  
net cash of £17.3 million (2013: £5.3 
million), and has taken advantage of 
the favourable terms available for 
borrowing to put in place a new, 
five-year, unsecured, multi-currency 
credit facility for £30 million. This 
facility is as yet unused. AMS 
continues to be in robust financial 
health and is well positioned to 
invest in internal development 
projects as well as potential licensing 
opportunities and acquisitions in line 
with the Group’s strategy. 
Dividend 
The Board is proposing a final 
dividend of 0.48p per share, making 
a total dividend for the year of 0.70p 
per share, a 16.7% increase on 2013.  
If approved at the Annual General 
Meeting on 21 May 2015, this will be 
paid on 29 May 2015 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of 
business on 8 May 2015.
People
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank all our employees, 
customers, suppliers, business 
partners and shareholders for their 
continued support over the past year.

 SPORTS MARKETING 
The Sports Marketing division had a strong year 
with revenue increasing 283% to $29.3 million 
(2014 $7.7 million) and Headline EBITDA increas -
ing by 116% to $9.8 million from $4.6 million in 
2014. Operating income increased to $21.2 million 
(2014: $7.7 million), growth of 175% year over 
year. Its client base grew by 11% to 595 (2014: 534, 
excluding the acquisition of ESP). Organic operat-
ing income growth was 51% to $11.6 million (2014: 
$7.7 million) and Headline EBITDA grew 38% to 
$6.3 million (2014: $4.6 million). 
In 2015 TLA ran and delivered three 
events: the first International Champions Cup 
in Australia, the USA v Canada Ice Hockey 
tour of Australia and the USA v Australia 
Rugby test match in Chicago. In addition 
TLA was successfully able to develop its 
portfolio for 2016 by securing an expand-
ed roster of events for this calendar year: 
The USA Sports Marketing business continues 
to grow with its client base increasing from 207 
to 228. There was growth across all segments of 
the US business, including pleasing progress in 
the rights sales business that the Group estab-
lished the last quarter of 2014 and the media 
advisory business launched earlier in that year.
ELITE SPORTS PROPERTIES
TLA acquired the business and assets of ESP, 
an Australian and UK based sports marketing 
business, for up to $19.5 million in March 2015. 
This is part of the Group's strategy to enhance its 
organic growth prospects with selective acquisi-
tions that complement TLA’s current activities. 
The seamless integration of ESP has diversified 
TLA’s offer and expanded its reach in regions 
such as Australia and the UK. 
ESP is reported within the Sports Marketing 
division. The acquisition increased TLA’s client 
base by 327 at acquisition and added key cli-
ents such as the Australian Football League, 
the National Australia Bank, Cricket Australia, 
Adidas, Rugby World Cup 2015 and a great roster 
of high quality athletes in the UK and Australia.
BASEBALL REPRESENTATION
Revenue increased by 15% to $15.1 million and 
Headline EBITDA for the year was $6.9 million 
(2014: $7.4 million). Operating income was $13.8 
million (2014: $13.1 million). The cost base in this 
business increased as TLA invested in agents 
and developed a pipeline of clients as the Group 
continue to build the long term future of the 
business. These development costs have been 
expensed in the period. 
TLA negotiated $174 million worth of con-
tracts for player-clients during 2015 (2014: $194 
million). The reduction reflects the fact that 
fewer players in our portfolio came off contract 
in 2015. On a four-year cycle, since 2012, TLA has 
secured over $700 million worth of contracts for 
clients, giving Baseball Representation excellent 
 First ever Aviva Premiership Rugby match on US soil 
when London Irish played Saracens in March 2016;
 Tottenham Hotspur, Atlético Madrid and Juventus 
to play in the 2016 International Champions Cup 
tournament in Australia in July 2016. For the first 
tournament TLA partnered with the State Government 
of Victoria and following the success of this event the 
partnership with the State Government of Victoria has 
been extended to 2018; 
 Sydney to host opening match of 2016 American College 
Football season in August 2016, the first time an opening 
match has been played outside the USA;
 2016 Ice Hockey Classic across Australia in June 2016; 
and
 New Zealand All Blacks against the Irish National Rugby 
Union team at Chicago's Soldier Field in November 2016

short to medium term. 
22 additional baseball players were 
added to TLA’s client list in 2015 bringing 
the total baseball client list to 289 (2014: 
267). The two recently recruited senior 
agents, mentioned previously, are expect-
ed to add additional high quality clients 
during 2016 and thereafter. 
TLA now represents 94 MLB clients (2014: 
83) and 195 Minor League baseball (MiLB) clients 
(2014: 184), with 17 MiLB clients moving up to 
the majors and several older clients retiring. The 
players called up to an MLB roster is the start 
point from which their initial three-year service 
period starts. At the expiry of this period they 
become eligible for market-related salaries via 
arbitration which TLA assist them to negotiate 
their salaries in return for fees. TLA’s client base 
continues to mature with 6 clients (2014: 3) mov -
ing into arbitration for 2016.

is an area of continued focus for the Group. TLA 
have further built out the teams in the divisions

events, sponsorship and consulting businesses. 
TLA Australia has been invaluable in the delivery 
of the Group’s events programme. 
TLA UK won the UK licensing Award for their 
excellent delivery of the master licensing pro-
gramme for the Rugby World Cup, 2015.
Pleasingly in the US this year, the Group was 
short listed for the prestigious Sports Business 
Journal Awards top five list of “Best in Talent

to join the Baseball Representation division. 
Management are delighted that they have joined 
TLA and we expect their established client lists 
to follow them to TLA.

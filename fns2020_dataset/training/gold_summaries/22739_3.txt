Chairman’s Statement
Results and strategic progress
This was a transformative year as the new 
management team prepared the business for the 
planned increased pace of expansion and at the same 
time delivered a record sales performance with total 
sales increasing by 51% to £37.1m. I am delighted 
with the progress that has been made so far with 
a number of key milestones being achieved, most 
notably the acquisition, integration and rebranding 
of the Gabbotts Farm Ltd business in H1 and the 
opening of six new Crawshaws stores. Both of these 
growth drivers have contributed positively to our 
EBITDA development and are performing in line with 
our expectations.
I am therefore pleased to report a 45% increase in 
our adjusted EBITDA performance as the strong sales 
growth is being converted into strong profit growth. 
A particular highlight has been the gross margin 
progression which strengthened further to 45.1% 
(2015: 44.4%). EBITDA post accelerated opening costs 
reduced as expected to £1.0m (2015: £1.6m) as we 
increased our overhead to invest in growth.
In the year under review we report a statutory loss 
before tax of £0.3m (2015: £1.2m profit before tax).  
It’s worth reiterating the reasons for this loss. Opening 
in excess of 15 new stores a year is no simple task, 
especially bearing in mind our stores are quite 
complex having both a fresh and food-to-go element. 
So we have built an internal resource in advance 
to allow us to find the retail sites, recruit and train 
the new staff, manage the pre-opening tasks and 
marketing, and to ensure that for each opening we hit 
the ground running.
This resource is now largely in place, and so our 
accelerated opening programme is in full force. But 
this resource cost us £1.6m in the year under review, 
and so it needs to be identified separately so that the 
true underlying performance of the business becomes 
visible. It’s also worth highlighting that new shops are 
expected to trade profitably from day one and, when 
mature, produce, on average, over £1m of sales per 
year, and an EBITDA contribution of £140,000.
Cash
The cash position of the business continues to 
be extremely robust. Operating cash flow and 
movements in working capital generated £2.2m 
which almost entirely funded the £2.3m of capital 
investment in new stores, refurbishments of legacy 
stores and investment in our factory production 
“ Another strong year for the business with 
record sales growth and our accelerated store 
rollout programme very much on track. ”
equipment in the year. The net £4.2m decrease  
in cash balances was a function of our acquisition  
of Gabbotts Farm Ltd, dividend payments and tax 
payments in the year. With a closing cash balance 
of £4.9m and continued focus on working capital 
improvements, we have the funds in place to deliver 
on our growth plan.
People
I would like to thank all of our 562 colleagues for 
their effort and commitment during this exciting 
time for our business. Since Noel joined Crawshaws 
as Chief Executive Officer in March 2015, he has 
successfully and carefully restructured and expanded 
the management team to ensure that we have the 
appropriate balance of expertise and dynamic to 
deliver our growth plan.
Outlook
Since my last statement, we continue to see strong 
sales growth on last year. T otal Group sales for the 
first seven weeks of the new financial period have 
increased by +64%. The cash gross margin in LFL 
stores has increased by 3.8% in the same seven week 
period, 3.7% through an increase in margin rate and 
0.1% through an increase in sales volume.
Our model continues to perform well. The business 
is at a very exciting stage with the strengthening 
of the legacy estate supplemented by the addition 
of a rapidly expanding new store estate. The newly 
opened stores are trading well, and profitably, in line 
with our expectation. The business is in great shape 
to deliver the planned scale rollout at pace and we 
have a strong pipeline of stores for 2016, so we look 
forward to reporting on our progress during the year 
ahead. In fact we have already opened five new stores 
during the current year, and these are also performing 
as expected.
We are pleased to declare the payment of a final 
dividend for the year of 0.47p per share, which 
together with the interim dividend of 0.10p per share, 
paid on 30 October 2015, takes the total dividend for 
the year to 0.57p per share (2015: 0.57p per share). 
Shareholder approval will be sought at the Annual 
General Meeting, to be held on 29 June 2016, to pay 
the final dividend on 5 August 2016 to shareholders 
on the register 8 July 2016. The ex-dividend date will 
be 7 July 2016. As with last year, shareholders will have 
the opportunity to elect to reinvest their cash dividend 
and purchase existing shares in the Company through 
a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”).
In summary, the foundations for our accelerated 
growth are in place and the rollout is very much 
underway. We now have a strong resource that will 
enable us to deliver another year of rapid expansion 
and profitable growth. We are therefore very confident 
and excited about the future.

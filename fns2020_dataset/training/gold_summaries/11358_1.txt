 4 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Chief Executive’s review
Nostra Terra is a UK-based oil and gas producer with interests in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and
Kansas. We aim to increase shareholder value by using advanced technology to find new
hydrocarbon reserves in already established fields. Our strategy is to put a diverse portfolio of
interests in place in low-risk geographies that will consistently grow production and revenues. To
this end, 2013 saw the company make steady progress. We extended our portfolio; we significantly
increased the volume of production; and we finally settled a long-running legal action. The year
placed Nostra Terra in a very strong cash position and has set us up for further more accelerated
growth in 2014.
Extending our portfolio
In 2012 we acquired a 20% interest in the Chisholm Trail Prospect in Oklahoma, assessing it as
low-risk and moderate-return. This is exactly what it has turned out to be. Our investments here
were consistently successful in 2013, yielding excellent results and justifying our decision to
concentrate resources on Chisholm Trail. 
Revenues from the first four wells helped us pass the landmark of operational breakeven, before
central costs, in January 2013. In particular well CT4 more than doubled our expectations. We
decided to exploit the Chisholm Trail opportunity further by partnering in additional wells and in
mid-year we acquired additional acreage, giving us access to 21 new potential drilling locations. 
Subsequently we’ve made investments in a further 11 wells to date, bringing the total up to 15
wells. The three new wells that are producing already – CT7, CT8 and CT9 – have increased our
total daily production by 57%. 
Chisholm Trail continues to allow room for growth and we expect it to yield further significant
increases to our net production. It already supplies an extremely valuable revenue stream that
supports our ability to pursue other opportunities. Moreover the strength of activity and results
have de-risked the Hunton Limestone formation where the Chisholm Trail Prospect is located, and
this helped us attract new investment (see Financials below). 
In March 2013, we identified an opportunity in Texas with similar potential to Chisholm Trail, and
purchased a 5% working interest (“WI”) in the High Plains Prospect. This Prospect covers 66 square
miles, and is operated by Brown and Borelli, a highly experienced and respected firm. 
We subsequently increased our interest to 20% following re-entry of a previously drilled well in
the prospect. Work is now ongoing to integrate detailed subsurface mapping and 3D seismic data
that will prioritize the prospect areas for drilling. We have assessed High Plains as being more risky
than Chisholm Trail, but with the potential for higher rewards. In fact the dependable revenue
streams from Chisholm Trail mean we are more comfortably positioned to enter into higher-risk
opportunities to strengthen our portfolio. Meanwhile, the geophysical results indicate that High
Plains might provide the opportunity to build a healthy pipeline of drilling locations for some years
to come. 
Net production in 2013
With the expansion of our portfolio, net production to Nostra Terra has risen as detailed in the
following table.  5 Annual report 2013
Financials 
As the chairman said, in 2013 Nostra Terra’s revenue grew considerably to £851,000 in 2013,
against £352,000 in 2012, due to greatly increased production volumes. This represents an increase
of 142%. Gross profit (before depletion, depreciation and amortisation) increased to £551,000,
against £192,000 in 2012.  
In respect of capital, Nostra Terra raised £750,000 before expenses by way of a placing of
187,500,000 new ordinary shares of 0.1p each with existing and new investors. 
I am very pleased to report that the legal action against Richfield Oil and Gas Company was finally
resolved in Nostra Terra’s favour and the monies owing to us were paid. In all we received over
US$1.6 million. Richfield has also voluntarily dismissed all counterclaims against Nostra Terra. 
After the balance sheet date we also secured a US$25 million credit facility with Texas Capital 
Bank, which includes provisions to increase the borrowing base as additional wells are brought 
on production. We agreed an initial borrowing base of US$500,000 which has increased to 
$1.1 million following a stabilisation of production rates, as announced on 7 May 2014. This strong
credit line will give us the ability to quicken the pace of growth through non-dilutive funds. 
An exciting future
We achieved a great deal in 2013. We made careful decisions to expand our interests in the
lucrative Chisholm Trail Prospect and diversify into High Plains, broadening our production base.
We increased revenue, with our focus now on free cash flow so that we can support more rapid
growth in 2014 and beyond. 
In the background we have also been building up our operational capabilities to prepare Nostra
Terra for a transition towards operating more of our own prospects. We have an exciting future as
we look to take much larger steps in growing production and reserves. A very solid foundation
has been built from which to accelerate growth.
It only remains for me to thank all Nostra Terra’s shareholders for their continuing loyal support. 
I look forward to giving you regular good news about our company in the months ahead.

 Booker Group plc
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2008
3
I am pleased to report the merger of 
Blueheath Holdings Plc and Booker 
to form Booker Group plc has been a 
success.  The merger was completed 
in June 2007.  Since that time market 
conditions have been challenging due 
to the cooling in the economy and the 
smoking ban in public places.  Despite 
these issues, Booker Group plc has 
performed ahead of expectations.  
Sales are up 2.3% in the year.  
Operating proﬁ t is up 29% and net 
debt was cut by 38%.  Customer 
satisfaction has improved and the 
ﬁ nancial performance is good.
The drive into the catering market 
is working with like-for-like sales to 
caterers having increased by 2.2%.  
Sales to retailers declined by 1.5% due 
primarily to the smoking ban.  Despite 
product cost inﬂ ation in some sectors, 
our prices have remained competitive 
and stock availability has been good.
The plans to ‘Broaden’ the business 
are going well.  We converted a further 
24 branches to the ‘Extra’ format 
during the year.  We now have 34 
‘Extras’ which offer a better range and 
customer experience.  The payback 
on the conversion costs is less than 
one year.
Blueheath is being successfully 
integrated into the Booker network.  
The cash and cost beneﬁ ts are being 
delivered in line with plan.  Through 
combining Blueheath’s technology 
and distribution expertise with Booker’s 
scale and operations capability we are 
starting to win proﬁ table business in 
the delivered wholesale market.
I am pleased that Lord Karan Bilimoria 
and Andrew Cripps have joined the 
Board as independent non-executive 
Directors. Their experience in relevant 
market sectors is of great value to 
the Board.
I should like to thank all our staff for 
their contribution to the success of the 
Group in the year just ended.
Basic earnings per share at 2.04 
pence is up from 0.94 pence last 
year. Given the strong operational 
performance of the business the 
Board recommends the payment of 
a £8 million full year dividend on 11 
July 2008 equivalent to 0.5375 pence 
per share.
Outlook
The economy is expected to 
slow in 2008/09 and the food 
wholesale market remains very 
competitive. Despite these challenges 
we remain optimistic and expect to 
continue making good progress in a 
challenging market.
For the ﬁ rst period of 2008/09 
turnover, inventory levels and costs 
are in line with plan.  Overall, Booker 
Group plc continues to trade in line 
with management expectations.
Annual General Meeting
Our Annual General Meeting will be held 
on 9th July 2008 and I look forward to 
welcoming shareholders then.

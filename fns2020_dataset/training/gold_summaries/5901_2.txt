“Our performance throughout the year reflects the strength and
resilience of the businesses we have built, with AEP achieving record
annual revenues and profit.The first half of the financial year saw a
robust response by both ECS and AEP to difficult trading conditions in
certain key markets. Our financial performance recovered strongly in the
second half of the year as conditions showed some signs of improvement.
Fenner is well positioned as we enter our 2014 financial year, with the
benefit of the investments made in both divisions over recent years, a
strong financial position and a mixed but generally improving global
economic environment. Overall, we continue to expect that the current
financial year will see a return to growth.”

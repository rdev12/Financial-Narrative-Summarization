Dairy Crest produces leading 
spreads and butter brands at two 
factories in the UK and one in 
France. These brands have strong 
distribution through retailers in both 
countries. We focus on three key 
brands, St Hubert in France and 
Clover and Country Life in the UK.
Dairy Crest has the leading cheese 
brand in the UK, Cathedral City, 
and a world-class cheese supply 
chain. Cathedral City is made at our 
Davidstow creamery in Cornwall from 
milk supplied by local dairy farmers. 
The cheese is matured, cut and 
wrapped at our purpose-built facility in 
Nuneaton from where it is despatched 
to retailers. We also have a smaller 
cheese packing facility at Frome, 
Somerset which provides the business 
with additional flexibility.
We process and deliver fresh 
conventional, organic and flavoured 
milk to major retailers, ‘middle ground’ 
customers including smaller retailers, 
coffee shops and hospitals and 
residential customers.
 We also manufacture and sell FRijj, 
the leading fresh flavoured milk brand, 
cream and milk powders.

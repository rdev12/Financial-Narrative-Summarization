Annual report and accounts 2006
History
The Debenhams name was first used in 1813 when Thomas Clark and William Debenham began retail
operations as the Clark and Debenham partnership on Wigmore Street in central London. The business
grew to include a number of retail outlets across the UK and in 1905 Debenhams opened its first
department store. In 1928 Debenhams listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange and traded as an
independent company until 1985, when it was acquired by The Burton Group. By 1985 Debenhams had
a portfolio of 65 department stores.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s Debenhams began to reposition its business, introducing exclusive
ranges of own-bought merchandise in key product areas and significantly increasing its portfolio of
stores. In 1997, Debenhams introduced its first international franchise store in the Middle East.
Debenhams was demerged from The Burton Group and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1998.
In December 2003 Debenhams was acquired by Baroness Retail Limited, a company owned indirectly 
by a group of funds managed or advised by CVC Capital Partners, Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity and
Texas Pacific Group, other institutional investors and the management team and ceased trading on the
London Stock Exchange.  In May 2006 Debenhams returned to the stock market.

Strategy
Debenhams’ strategy is to maintain and build on its core strengths and to leverage these further
through organic, new space and other channel growth:
Organic growth
• Sales and margin growth from design, buying and merchandising initiatives: Increasing customer
differentiation through further growth of Designers at Debenhams, enhancing own brands and making
logical extensions to existing ranges.
• Supply chain transformation: rationalisation to fewer, better suppliers driving improved margins and
payment terms alongside shortening lead times to improve customer availability and lower markdown.
• Store refurbishment programme: 14 stores completed in 2006 and roll-out across the portfolio 
is continuing.
New space growth
• New department store openings: extending the reach of the brand, increasing availability of the 
offer to customers with the potential for 240 stores.
• New small store format Desire by Debenhams: unique concept of “one-stop shop” for women 
focusing on own-brands and designers with the potential for 100 stores.
Other channel growth
• International franchise roll-out: high growth potential with plans for 70 stores by the end of 2010.
• Multi-channel and web growth: significant investment to upgrade Debenhams’ internet site 
improving the offer content and functionality. 3

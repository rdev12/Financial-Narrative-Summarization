 Anite_Annual report and accounts 2010     3
Anite had a good finish to the financial 
year in both its divisions. We believe that 
the success and leadership of our products 
in their respective markets will result in 
future profitable growth.
Overview
The highlights of the year were the launch of 
our new wireless 4G LTE (LTE) product range 
(Anite 9000) and the continuing development 
handset and chipset customers. This success 
is being underpinned by focusing on LTE as 
the global 4G wireless technology of choice.
Although still in its early development phase, 
LTE is beginning to be widely adopted. The 
smartphone revolution, and the pressure that 
is putting on operators’ networks, means LTE 
is a much more vital technology upgrade 
than was the transition from 2G to 3G.
of our successful @comRes travel reservation 
system. These products, the leaders in their 
respective markets, are the foundations for 
our future profitable growth.
The changes we made to our LTE product 
strategy have put us in a much stronger position 
to control the pace of the commercialisation 
of our offer. They have resulted in early 
success for our product with Tier 1 global

Group summary 
Although we had a difficult start to last year 
there were signs of recovery in the second 
half. During the year we continued to invest 
in our products and are now well positioned 
to move forward.
Trading in the opening part of this year has 
started well, in line with our expectations, 
and we look forward to making progress 
through the year.

As a consequence of these factors, results  
for 2009/10 are generally lower than those  
for the previous year, although they still 
demonstrate the strength of our divisions: 
adjusted operating margins of 14% were 
reported by the Wireless division and 24% by 
the Travel division. Encouragingly, the Group 
closed the financial year well: performance in 
Q4 meant that full-year orders were up 6% 
on the previous year and the book-to-bill 
ratio was just over one times.
Adjusted profit before tax for the Group was 
£9.9m (2009: £18.1m) on revenues down 
13% at £78.8m (2009: £90.1m).
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 
down 45% to 2.4p (2009: 4.4p). We are, 
however, proposing to maintain the final 
dividend at 0.65p per share (2009: 0.65p), 
giving an unchanged total dividend of 0.95p 
(2009: 0.95p). The dividend will be paid on 
26 October to shareholders on the register 
at 17 September 2010.
Balance sheet and cash
The Group has a strong balance sheet, with 
net cash resources and significant undrawn 
bank facilities. Net cash as at 30 April 2010 was 
£29.8m (30 April 2009: net cash of £27 .3m).
As previously announced, the Board took 
action towards the end of the year to cap 
the currency swap liability that had built  
up since we acquired the Network Testing 
business in 2006. Full details are given in  
the Financial review. The important point  
is that the maximum liability is now certain, 
at £21.6m, with some potential for this to 
decrease if the euro weakens significantly 
against sterling over the next 18 months. 
The level of net cash, reported above, is 
before taking account of the liability on  
the Group’s currency swap.
At the end of a particularly testing year, 
Travel was stronger and better positioned  
as a result of the progress it made with  
@comRes, and with its key customers in the 
UK and Germany.
Strategy
Our strategy is to position Anite as a global 
leader in Wireless test solutions, and to take 
advantage of the future opportunities that 
will emerge from the development and 
roll-out of LTE technology.
The Board believes that Wireless is a 
long-term growth market, which has high 
barriers to entry and limited competition  
in those areas in which Anite operates.  
This makes it possible to achieve good margins 
and returns on the investments needed to 
maintain our technological leadership.
In Travel, our strategy is to optimise the 
business’s long-term value. To achieve this, 
we will continue to strengthen and improve 
its market position through the successful 
development of @comRes. 
Results
The backdrop against which Anite’s results 
were delivered in 2009/10 provided many 
challenges. In addition to the well-documented 
recessionary pressures around the world,  
our specific markets also faced a technology 
change, as customers reduced spending  
on legacy technologies in anticipation of their 
need to invest in the launch of the 4G market. 
In recognition of the pressures this placed on 
revenue and profitability, Anite’s Wireless 
division rightly pressed ahead with 
development plans to ensure that it is well 
placed for the beginning of the 4G cycle.  
The resulting record investment made in the 
year also had an impact on profitability. At the 
same time, the Travel division was faced with a 
reduction in the scale of its business as a result 
of the customer consolidation and losses that 
occurred in the previous financial year.

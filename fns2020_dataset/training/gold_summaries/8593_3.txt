 Phytopharm plc 04 Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Mr Alistair Taylor Non-Executive Chairman
Chairman’s review
2010 was a year which saw some significant 
changes in Phytopharm’s business and outlook. 
The business is now focused solely on the 
development of its pharmaceutical pipeline. 
In December 2009 the Company completed 
an equity financing of £24.09 million net 
of expenses. This financing will allow the 
Company to make significant progress in 
the development of its product pipeline. 
This was followed by the appointment 
of a new management team headed by 
CEO Tim Sharpington and Research and 
Development Director Roger Hickling. Both 
Tim and Roger bring significant pharmaceutical 
and biotech industry experience. Having taken 
the decision to focus on our pharmaceutical 
products, the Company has curtailed 
expenditure on its functional food products 
and has subsequently restructured the 
business, reducing internal head count and 
costs. Phytopharm now operates as a virtual 
biotech company. With a strong financial 
position and a product pipeline reaching key 
development milestones in the next two years, 
Phytopharm is well placed to deliver value to 
shareholders in the coming period.

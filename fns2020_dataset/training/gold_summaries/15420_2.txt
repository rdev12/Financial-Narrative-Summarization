AdEval™
An advertising pre-testing system,
which evaluates an advertisement's
performance using unique and
powerful diagnostics, to show how
advertising can be optimised.
Client issue If I haven’t seen an
immediate result, will my advertising
improve over time?
TNS insight If an advertisement
doesn’t show results quickly it is
unlikely ever to work. A media plan 
will naturally contribute to an ad’s
success, however if the creative is
flawed, you cannot compensate by
extra media spend. A so-called ‘slow
burn’ usually turns into a ‘no burn’.
AdEval offers guidance on how to
rectify an ad that could otherwise fail. 
MarketWhys™
The brand and advertising tracking
system that goes beyond basic
awareness measures to understand
the real impact of marketing activities.
Client issue What should I be
measuring in my advertising tracking?
TNS insight Advertising awareness
alone is no guarantee of a positive
impact on the brand. TNS goes
beyond simple awareness measures 
to get to the real advertising effect, 
by understanding the impact of both
media and creative on the brand. 
It helps you understand how your
advertising is working to retain 
existing and acquire new customers.
Miriad™
The advanced data integration,
analysis and delivery tool for all types
of research studies.
Client issue How do I make sense of
the many diverse sources of marketing
information available? 
TNS insight You need an intelligent
data integration analysis and delivery
system to assist in decision-making at
both the strategic and tactical levels.
Miriad is custom built to your
specifications and available via
desktop or web. It is used across
nearly 500 tracking studies and in
more than 40 countries. 
NeedScope™ System
A system for measuring consumer
needs and motivations, which uses a
proven psychological framework to
uncover the fundamental elements
linking successful brands and their
consumers.
Client issue How can I tap into
consumer needs to uncover marketing
opportunities?
TNS insight NeedScope identifies
profitable consumer need segments 
so that clients can manage global
brand portfolios, prevent other brands
cannibalising an existing range and
identify new brand opportunities.
Optima™
A brand portfolio management tool
that offers an understanding of 
market structure, based on how 
and why consumers choose the
brands they do. 
Client issue What do I do if my brand
needs to operate and be positioned at
both a local and global level?
TNS insight By analysing the key
drivers contributing to the brand share,
Optima can achieve both global and
local positioning. It identifies the key
choices driving the market and the
strengths of the brand. It then
recommends what messages can 
be applied at both levels.
The Conversion Model™
A psychological measure of human
behaviour that analyses customer
commitment. It identifies which
customers are committed to the brand
or service, which are likely to defect
and what the future direction for the
brand will be. 
Client issue How strong is my brand
relative to its competitors?
TNS insight We enable you to improve
market share by identifying how 
to strengthen your brand. Some
marketers complain that they operate
in commodity markets and that their
brands don't count. We have found
that in every market, there will always
be people who become attached to
brands. Brand commitment is
something every brand can achieve.
TRI*M™
An integrated stakeholder
management system. 
Client issue How do customers
perceive my products and services?
Which of my branches/departments
are the best performing ones in terms
of customer retention or employee
commitment?
TNS insight Measuring, managing 
and monitoring your stakeholder
relationships - levels and drivers 
of customer retention, as well as
strengths and weaknesses, compared
with your competitors.

 BrainJuicer’s progress during 
the year has been strong, and 
the Company has continued to 
grow organically with revenues 
up 42% to £9,322,000 (2007: 
£6,566,000) and operating 
profits up 53% to £1,290,000 
(2007: £844,000). The Company  
did not experience softening 
in the market in 2008 and, as 
we have observed in the past, 
research spend from our core 
client base, multi-national 
consumer goods and services 
companies has tended to 
remain relatively stable. The 
research market has continued 
to grow, with the global spend 
on market research reaching 
$28bn (ESOMAR Global 
Market Research Report 2008). 
However, given the current global 
recession, we have to be realistic 
and expect the market in 2009 to 
be flat at best. 
It is innovation that sets 
BrainJuicer apart. We have 
continued to develop our products 
in pioneering directions, for the 
benefit of our existing blue chip 
customers and in order to attract 
new ones. Our new products, 
although quite different from 
the established offerings of our 
competitors, are beginning to be 
adopted within our large clients 
and we are delighted with the 
progress that has been made. 
The Company has expanded its 
geographic footprint with the 
appointment of highly regarded 
country managers in Germany 
and Switzerland and, through 
licensing agreements, in Canada 
and Australia. This expansion 
requires little investment and 
is low risk, as the Company’s 
overseas offices are supported 
by its UK operations technically 
and operationally. The Company 
is deliberately and steadily 
increasing its geographic 
coverage, particularly in the 
largest research markets, to 
further align itself with its large 
multi-national target market. 
The Company is in the mainstream 
of global market research spend 
and, in spite of its small size, is 
competing successfully with the 
major research firms. BrainJuicer 
continues to receive a positive 
reaction to its innovative new 
products and it is in this area 
that we continue to focus our 
efforts. Significant new client 
wins have underpinned a strong 
financial year and have enabled 
ongoing investment in the team 
and BrainJuicer’s technology 
platform. We are pleased with 
the way the Company has further 
strengthened its market position 
and its reputation during 2008.

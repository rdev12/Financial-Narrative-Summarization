CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S Q&A
Q
 How does StatPro sell to 
prospects who have a 
competitor solution ingrained 
in their processes?
Every company is looking to gain a 
commercial advantage and in the asset 
management business, that frequently 
comes down to the level of service that is 
provided to clients. If company A provides 
its clients with daily access to online 
analysis of their portfolios and company B 
only sends their clients standard reports 
once a month, two weeks after the month 
end (this is predominantly the current 
standard), then company B is in danger of 
losing business to company A. StatPro R+ 
and StatPro Revolution necessitates a 
rethink about processes and this applies to 
our prospects and clients alike.
Q
 Are there some clients  
of StatPro Seven who 
wouldn’t naturally migrate  
to StatPro R+?
When the cloud was first mentioned, many 
people said ‘never’. However, things are 
changing rapidly and most people can now 
see that architecturally and technically, 
cloud-based solutions are better for pretty 
much everything, including security. StatPro 
is proud to have Deutsche Bank and Credit 
Suisse Private Bank amongst its clients for 
StatPro Revolution and they would not have 
subscribed if they had concerns about 
security. Nevertheless, there are some 
organisations, such as sovereign wealth 
funds, that will be the most reluctant to 
make the switch. However, we believe that 
in a few years even they may well be ready 
for migration.
The path to revolution 13
Q
 What is the market 
perception of StatPro R+ 
creating ‘efficiencies’ for 
performance teams?
Currently the larger asset managers have 
quite large teams of performance 
measurers, yet all of them work on a 
monthly data production cycle. We believe 
that StatPro R+ will make it possible to flip 
that to a daily production cycle. That is more 
than a 20-fold increase in productivity 
(assuming weekends are excluded). There 
will be no need for them to have the IT 
infrastructure, nor to manage market data. 
A big change will be not needing to manage 
complex performance report production, 
but rather using StatPro Revolution’s 
self-service capability to improve client 
service. So roles will change, but the 
quantity of work may stay the same.
Q
 How is revenue affected 
by the realignment of the 
client services teams to 
StatPro Revolution?
We have seen the number of StatPro Seven 
clients adopting StatPro Revolution greatly 
increase in 2013 and we expect this to 
continue. StatPro Revolution enables our 
clients to extract more value out of their 
performance function and so the client 
service teams need to help our clients 
realise these gains. We have found that 
thanks to StatPro Revolution we are getting 
exposure to more parts of our clients’ 
businesses and, as we understand our 
clients better, so we can help them more. 
We expect the realignment of the client 
service teams to boost revenue. 
Q
 How can StatPro identify 
the tipping point for StatPro 
Revolution?
We cannot be certain when or if this might 
happen. What we do know is that by sheer 
hard work, we are getting more and more 
recognition in the marketplace. We have 
gone from being a relatively anonymous 
back office provider to a new name in the 
front office with a distinctive brand. We now 
need to translate that into hard currency, 
but that will also take more hard work. 
Judging by the huge increase in cold calling, 
webex calls and meetings, we are getting 
the message out to the market, but there is 
always more to do.
Q
 Are the fund 
administrators happy with 
the price point of StatPro 
Revolution?
I think that we have established a price 
norm for portfolio analytics. It is a 
considerably lower price point than most 
other solutions can provide it for except 
for very high volumes of portfolios (and 
we offer volume discounts). Our fund 
administrator partners tend to pass on 
the cost of StatPro Revolution, but also 
charge a data management fee on top. 
This is perfectly reasonable from our 
perspective as there is a lot of value in 
managing the data properly. We hope that 
when StatPro R+ is fully ready, fund 
administrators will use it to provide 
additional services to asset managers.
Q
 Will we change the $100 
per month model for StatPro 
Revolution?
We already have four tariffs for portfolios: 
Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze. The price 
per portfolio, per month is $300, $100, $15 
and $5. You have to buy Silver in packs of 10 
and Bronze in packs of 50 portfolios. The 
distinction between the portfolio types is 
the level of functionality you get. In essence, 
the Silver and Bronze are suitable for the 
private wealth market and the Platinum and 
Gold portfolios are designed for the asset 
management and hedge fund community. 
We have no current intention of changing 
these price points, although volume buyers 
can get discounts on a per portfolio basis.

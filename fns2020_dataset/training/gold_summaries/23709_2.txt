Our Vision:
To become Europe’s partner of choice for
investment solutions.
Our Mission:
We seek to differentiate ourselves by:
• Building business partnerships with
clients, intermediaries and
consultants.
• Providing them with solutions that
deliver superior performance and
service.
• Combining the benefits of centres of
excellence and expert local teams.
We aim to create value for clients,
shareholders and staff.
The merger last October that created F&C Asset
Management plc, has enabled us to achieve that goal
two years ahead of target. This was the largest
transaction in the global asset management industry
in 2004

as well as the most significant in the UK for
many years.”

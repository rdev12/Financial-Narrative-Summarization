we saw a full year impact of 2014 mid-year 
contract renewals and wins, as well as the

Dividend
As a result of the growth in underlying 
Group profitability and the Board’s positive 
view of future prospects for the business, 
an increase in the final dividend of 3.6% to 
8.6 pence per share (2014: 8.3 pence per 
share) will be proposed to Shareholders at 
the forthcoming AGM, increasing the total 
dividend for 2015 by 2.4% to 12.6 pence 
per share (2014: 12.3 pence per 
share). The proposed dividend 
payment is at the upper end 
of our previously stated 
policy of applying a dividend 
payout ratio of between 
30% to 40% of Group 
Underlying Operating Profit 
after interest and tax and 
reflects our confidence in 
the future.

the final dividend is 24

Introduction
In my first year as Chairman, I am 
pleased to report the continued progress 
of the Group with record financial results 
posted in 2015. Group Underlying 
Operating Profit
1
 of £42.9m (2014: £42.0m) 
was higher than LSL achieved in the 
property market peak of 2007. Group 
revenue grew by 4.6% to £300.6m (2014: 
£287.5m) and profit before tax grew by 
20.8% to £38.6m (2014: £31.9m).
Performance
After a slower first half in the Estate Agency 
Division, reflecting the overall market,  
we continued to execute on our strategy, 
delivering a strong second half. As a result, 
in 2015 we delivered full year growth of 12% 
in the counter-cyclical Lettings business, 
Financial Services revenue growth of 16% 
and revenue growth in Marsh & Parsons 
of 9% against a challenging prime Central 
London market.
The Surveying Division delivered an 
excellent performance with 3% revenue

Board Update
On 1
st
 January 2015, I was appointed as 
Chairman and Bill Shannon was appointed 
Deputy Chairman in addition to his role

Audit Committees in May and September 
respectively and Adam Castleton as Group

appointment as Regional President, Europe 
at Reed Exhibitions which is part of RELX 
Group plc.
Adam Castleton joined LSL from French 
Connection Group PLC. He previously held 
leadership roles at a number of market 
leading companies, including O2 UK, eBay 
and The Walt Disney Company. Adam has 
over 24 years’ experience in finance, having 
started his career with Price Waterhouse 
where he qualified as a Chartered 
Accountant in 1989.
In December 2015, we announced 
that Mark Morris, who has been a Non 
Executive Director and member of the 
Nominations, Remuneration and Audit 
Committees since November 2006, will 
retire from the Board and its Committees 
and that David Stewart, will, subject to 
his election at the 2016 AGM, take on the 
role of Chairman of the Audit Committee 
with effect from the AGM, in addition to 
his existing appointments as a member 
of the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees.
Corporate Governance
The Board remains committed to high 
levels of corporate governance and during 
2015, LSL has complied in all respects 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(September 2014 edition) save that due to 
my previous roles on the Board, I did not 
satisfy the independence requirement prior 
to my appointment as Chairman. Further 
details relating to my appointment are 
contained in the Corporate Governance 
Report.
In respect of 2015, the Board has again 
conducted an annual review of its 
effectiveness and that of its Committees, 
taking into account the balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge 
of our businesses. Following this exercise, 
we concluded that the Board and its 
Committees are effective and are able 
to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities appropriately.
The Board has during the year also 
reviewed its composition, which at the date 
of this Report includes five independent 
Non Executive Directors (due to reduce to 
four independent Non Executive Directors 
at the 2016 AGM) and three Executive 
Directors and myself as Chairman. Further, 
the Board continues to recognise the 
benefits of diversity in the boardroom, 
including gender and racial diversity. The 
current Board composition includes two 
female Directors, Helen Buck and Kumsal 
Bayazit Besson, who are both independent 
Non Executive Directors.
Whilst we remain of the view that the 
setting of targets for the number of female 
directors on the Board is not necessary and 
that we will continue to appoint on merit, I 
will continue to ensure that our searches for 
new directors take into account diversity, 
including gender and race.
LSL remains committed to promoting 
diversity throughout the Group and in 
2015 we continued to build on the diversity 
reviews conducted during the previous 
years. During 2015, we have commenced 
a range of employee training initiatives, 
including courses relating to gender bias 
training and assertiveness training. Further 
details of LSL ’s studies and its conclusions 
are set out in our Corporate Social 
Responsibility Report.
As Chairman, with the responsibility 
for leadership of the Board, I review its 
effectiveness on all aspects of its role and 
encourage feedback.
Our market position
LSL holds a market leading position in its 
core Estate Agency business comprising 
12 Estate Agency brands, including Your 
Move, which is the largest UK single 
brand estate agent with 282 branches 
nationwide and has the UK’s most visited 
estate agency website
2
. The businesses are 
organised to deliver integrated Residential 
Sales, Lettings and Financial Services from 
a single operating structure.
We continue to invest in our brands and in 
January 2016 we launched a national media 
campaign to further invest in our Your Move 
Estate Agency brand. This demonstrates 
our commitment to supporting and 
protecting our valuable brands and has 
started well. We also invested in 2015 to 
drive future growth by increasing branch 
headcount to support our successful 
Lettings and Financial Services businesses 
and also in our growing Land and New 
Homes businesses.

residential property market, which is 
characterised by on-going new entrants. 
We continue to develop and evolve our 
offering to ensure our competitiveness in 
this marketplace.
Ultimately the success of our business 
model has always been underpinned by our 
strong brands and excellence in delivery 
by our knowledgeable local colleagues. 
In 2016 we will continue to invest in 
technology to widen the digital offering to 
our customers whilst improving our internal 
efficiency at the same time.
We continue to selectively acquire 
businesses. To drive growth in the counter-
cyclical Lettings business, we acquired 
30 lettings books in 2015 (2014: 10), with 
internal disciplines in place to ensure 
successful integration into the Group. 
It is also pleasing to note the strong 
performance of Thomas Morris, a multi 
award winning seven branch estate agency 
which we acquired during the first quarter 
of 2015.
Post our 2015 year-end, we acquired a 
65% interest in Group First Limited (GFL) in 
February 2016 which provides mortgage 
and protection brokerage services to the 
purchasers of new homes. This is a value 
enhancing opportunity which further 
strengthens LSL ’s relationships with its key 
housebuilder clients.
In Financial Services, the Group arranged 
total mortgage lending of £14.5bn (2014: 
£11.6bn), representing 6.6% of the overall 
market

. Measured by the number of 
appointed representatives, LSL ’s overall 
network is the second largest in the UK

We continue to hold a leadership position in 
Surveying, maintaining strong relationships 
with many of the major lenders.

Our people
The number of Group employees at 31
st
 
December 2015 was 5,181 (2014: 5,222) and 
our success is ultimately dependent on the 
customer service provided by our staff in all 
parts of our business across the entire UK. 
I would like to thank all of our staff for their 
continued hard work and commitment which 
they have demonstrated throughout 2015.
Current trading and outlook
We have started the year positively across 
the Group.
In the Estate Agency Division, trading is in 
line with expectations and there are good 
activity levels with quality buyers and good 
availability of mortgages. Whilst there 
remains a shortage of stock, our sales 
conversion remains strong and we are 
maintaining our market share. The January 
2016 launch of the Your Move national 
media campaign has started well.
In our Surveying Division, trading is in line 
with expectations and the technology 
refresh is progressing well.
The forthcoming year is expected to see a 
flat housing market in terms of transactions, 
with continuing house price inflation outside 
prime Central London.
Underpinned by a series of strategic 
initiatives, the business is well placed to 
deliver a solid performance in 2016. We 
are positive regarding the outlook for 2016, 
committed to driving profitable organic 
growth across the business, and will 
continue to evaluate selective acquisitions.
The Group has a robust balance sheet 
with relatively low levels of gearing and 
is very cash generative at an operational 
level. The business is therefore well placed 
to capitalise on the market conditions to 
increase Shareholder value.

 PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT    06
We are already working with our customers 
and partners on the ‘next-generation’ of set-top 
boxes and new technologies.
through their payTV subscription or 
through free-to-air services such as 
the UK’s recently-launched Freeview 
HD service, which will utilise our latest 
DVB-T2 set-top box development. 
At the same time there will be a 
continued requirement for low-end 
adapter products in the Americas and 
other markets that will support cable 
networks in a complete transition from 
analogue to digital. 
Pace has been instrumental in the 
current growth that the payTV industry 
is experiencing in digital related 
products. We have been successful in 
targeting the world’s most successful 
payTV operators, providing them 
with products to enable the market 
for digital. By 2013 global payTV 
revenues are forecast to reach $14bn, 
in an overall market for digital TV that 
will see annual set-top box shipments 
at over 124 million units.
We also continue our long-term 
commitment to minimise the 
environmental impact of our business 
operations and set-top box products. 
For example, over the last three years, 
total power consumption in our high 
deﬁnition PVRs has been reduced by 
over 70%. 
A trusted partner
Many of our 100+ customers 
consider Pace their supplier of 
choice and technology partner. 
Because our customers operate in 
highly competitive entertainment 
and communications markets, they 
turn to new technology to deliver 
differentiated and engaging services 
to attract and retain subscribers. 
There are opportunities in all our 
markets, in terms of new products 
and new customers. This includes 
markets where we have been strong 
for a number of years in Europe and 
North America, but also in territories 
where we are less established, such 
as South America and Asia.
The underlying theme in all our 
geographic markets is that demand 
for our products has grown, in 
particular for HD. This is an area 
where Pace is an industry leader and 
in 2009 we were in the global top 
two for overall box shipments. Today 
only 4% of global households have 
so far made the switch to HD. But 
researchers expect over 273m HD 
households by 2013, with over 10% 
of global TV households subscribing 
to a HD service. 
We are well placed to capitalise on 
the increasing requirement from 
payTV operators, as HD becomes 
“the norm”. We are delighted that our 
technology will be enabling millions 
worldwide to watch the 2010 football 
World Cup in amazing quality either 
3D; all of this is creating tremendous 
consumer demand for our products 
and services as well as creating new 
revenue streams for our customers. 
Global penetration for most of these 
amazing advancements is still only 
single digit so there is a great deal to 
play for. Over the past year we have 
also seen a shift for payTV from being 
a luxury to almost utility status, as it is 
in the USA. 
As part of our diversiﬁcation 
strategy we began deliveries of our 
MultiDweller
®
 product to two new 
customers, each one using the 
product for very different applications. 
We also recruited ﬁve new distributors 
to our Networks Approved Partners 
programme. In 2010 we will add 
customers and distributors to 
increase our routes to market, grow 
volume shipments and expect to 
breakeven. This will be followed by a 
major market push in 2011 bringing 
return on investment.

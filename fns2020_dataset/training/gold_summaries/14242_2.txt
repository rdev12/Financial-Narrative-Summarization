Highlights of 2009
Operational
  Silence initiated a Phase I clinical trial of Atu027, its lead drug candidate for the 
treatment of advanced solid tumours. The trial, being conducted at the Marienhospital, 
Herne, Germany, is an open‑label, dose‑finding study to address the safety, tolerability 
and pharmacokinetics of Atu027. It is expected that results from the trial will be available 
in the second half of 2011. 
  Silence’s licensing partner, Quark Pharmaceuticals, commenced Phase I/II clinical 
trials with QPI‑1002, a short interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic product candidate in 
development for use in kidney transplants. QPI‑1002 is based on Silence’s proprietary 
AtuRNAi chemistry.
  The European Patent Office (EPO) granted a patent on protein kinase N3 (PKN3), 
the target gene for Silence’s lead compound Atu027.
  The Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office revoked in its entirety 
European patent EP1 214 945, which is a fundamental competitor patent owned by 
Alnylam Europe AG.
  Silence entered into a delivery collaboration with Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd 
of Japan to demonstrate the functional delivery of Silence’s proprietary siRNA molecules 
to specific targets. The collaboration is evaluating Silence’s proprietary AtuRNAi, a novel 
proprietary siRNA molecule which is chemically modified to improve stability, reduce 
manufacturing costs and increase yield. The collaboration is also making use of Silence’s 
AtuPLEX delivery technology, which has been shown to improve functional intracellular uptake. 
  The Opposition Division of the EPO upheld Silence’s core AtuRNAi patent EP 1 527 176 
(’176) in amended form. The amended form of patent ’176 covers Silence’s proprietary 
blunt‑ended siRNA molecules containing alternating 2’‑O‑Methyl modifications.

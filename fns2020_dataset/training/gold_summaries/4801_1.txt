 Strategy and Performance
The Group comprises a number of high quality,
specialised businesses supplying technical products 
and services and operating in the three broad industry
sectors of Life Sciences, Seals and Controls. The
businesses aim to achieve stable revenue growth
through the focus on essential products and services
funded by customers’ operating, rather than capital
budgets. Attractive margins are sustained through the
quality of customer service, depth of technical support
and value adding activities. The Group’s strategic
objective is to build more substantial, broader based
businesses in the chosen sectors through a combination
of organic growth and acquisition.
This year has proved a real test of this strategy as the
Group’s operating businesses, while demonstrating 
their resilient characteristics, still felt the effects of the
dramatic downturn in the global economy. The Group’s
revenues from the continuing businesses increased by
2% over the prior year; underlying revenues reduced by
12%, after adjusting for currency translation effects and
contributions from acquisitions.
The downturn impacted early in the year and the
Group’s businesses reacted quickly and decisively to re-
focus efforts on optimising performance at the reduced
revenue levels. Cost reduction programmes implemented
in the first half of the year, reduced the total headcount
and net monthly costs for the continuing businesses by
10% and 6% respectively by the end of the year. 
Operating margins were held to a creditable 16.0%
(2008: 17.0%) and operating profits of the continuing
businesses reduced by 4% to £25.6m (2008: £26.6m).
After adjusting for currency effects, acquisitions and
costs of specific overhead reduction programmes,
underlying operating profits reduced by ca. 10%.
Close attention has also been applied to maximising
cash flow and reducing balance sheet exposure.
Working capital and in particular inventory, was sharply
reduced in those businesses with reduced revenues and
this resulted in a strong increase in operating cashflow.
The Group’s total free cash flow from continuing
businesses increased by 33% to £23.5m (2008: £17.7m)
and the Group closed the year with cash balances at
30 September 2009 of £21.3m (2008: £15.7m).
Sector developments
At the sector level, in addition to the focus on short term
performance, the businesses have continued to invest
selectively in new growth initiatives which will position
them well to gain early benefit from any market
recovery. Key developments in each sector are
summarised below.
Life Sciences
The Healthcare businesses in Canada, now managed
together through the newly formed Diploma Canada
Healthcare Inc. (“DCHI”), continued to make good
progress, increasing revenues by 10% in Canadian
dollars and 20% in UK sterling. The DCHI businesses
supply into the public sector funded Healthcare sector
where overall funding has grown steadily over many
years, but with increased focus now on the cost-
effective use of public sector health funds.
Capital expenditure budgets in hospitals have been more
tightly controlled this year and instrument purchases
have been limited to those which can demonstrate 
clear performance and/or efficiency benefits. The DCHI
businesses have responded by taking a pro-active
approach to renewing existing supplies contracts and
targeting new contracts. Through these initiatives, there
has been a strong growth in the underlying supplies
component of the businesses, which represents the
larger part of DCHI revenues.

Chief Executive’s Review
DCHI continues to look for opportunities to accelerate
growth by securing new suppliers for the existing
businesses, or by acquiring complementary businesses
which bring these new product lines. The bolt-on
acquisition of Meditech in November 2008, consolidated
DCHI’s position as a leading supplier of products and
services to the growing in-vitro fertilisation (“IVF”)
market, represented by the ca. 30 dedicated IVF clinics
across Canada.
In the European environmental businesses, sales of
consumable products and services have again held up
well, but capital equipment sales have suffered from
decisions by customers to defer capital expenditure. 
In response to the 9% reduction in revenues, 
operations have been restructured to increase the 
focus on segments which offer long term growth
potential, while reducing costs.
Where the growth potential for any Group business is
limited for market or supplier reasons, consideration has
to be given to whether the business may perform better
under different ownership. This was the case with the
Manual Liquid Handling (“MLH”) business of Anachem
Limited. In October 2009, after the year end, a contract
was signed for the disposal of the MLH business to one
of its principal suppliers; the transaction is due to
complete in January 2010.
Seals
The Seals sector businesses have been most impacted
by the downturn in the global economy, since the
principal market drivers are the growth in the industrial
economy and in particular heavy construction. The 
core Aftermarket business demonstrated its resilient
characteristics with revenues reducing less than the
broader market. However, the major impact of the
downturn was felt by the Industrial OEM businesses
(RTD Seals and M Seals) and those businesses which
primarily supply to construction equipment dealers
(Bulldog and HKX).
With underlying revenues reducing by 21% (after
adjusting for currency effects and acquisitions), 
the main short term priority has been to optimise
performance at the reduced revenue levels. Substantial
cost reduction programmes led to a reduction in the
headcount and monthly operating expenses of 15% 
and 9% respectively. Working capital has also been
reduced sharply which generated free cash flow of
£8.6m, an increase of 76% over the prior year.
As in previous cyclical downturns, the Seals businesses
have maintained focused investment in a small number
of strategic projects to ensure that they emerge
stronger and well placed to exploit growth opportunities,
as the markets recover. This year, advantage was taken
of the reduced activity levels to complete the installation
of the new warehouse automation and carousel system
in Hercules’ main Clearwater operations. The investment
in the project this year has been £0.9m and results will
be seen in improved operational leverage, as volumes
increase.
In addition, continued investment has been applied to
establishing the Hercules Europe Aftermarket business,
despite unfavourable current market conditions. A
further £0.3m has been invested in relocating the
business to a new facility, building appropriate inventory
and distributing a new 4-language seal and seal kit
catalogue. As market conditions improve, Hercules
Europe will be well placed to build market share.
Finally, HFPG completed the acquisition of RTD Seals in
January 2009 for a consideration of £10.1m. RTD Seals
is a good sized, long established supplier to industrial
OEMs with a strong market position in the Mid-Western
states in the US. RTD Seals made a positive contribution
of £0.7m to operating profits in very difficult trading
conditions and is well positioned to gain early benefit
from any market recovery.
Controls
With a large proportion of revenues generated in the UK
and Germany and a wide range of product applications,
the underlying market drivers are the growth of the UK
and German industrial economies. In both countries, real
GDP and manufacturing output fell markedly over the
year, with the UK entering recession in late 2008 and
Germany following early in 2009. 
While strongly influenced by the general industrial
economic environment, the Controls businesses 
focus on more specialised, technology driven market
segments. The businesses have benefited in particular
from the stronger market conditions in the Defence and
Military Aerospace sectors. With a larger part of the
revenues generated from repair, refurbishment and
upgrade programmes, the Controls businesses have
been less exposed to cut-backs and delays in major
capital programmes. 
The Medical equipment sector has also remained
strong, but other sectors have performed less 
well, including general Industrial, Motorsport and
Commercial Aerospace. Against this market
background, the Controls businesses saw revenues
reduce by 10% in UK sterling terms, a reduction of 
15% in local currency terms. As with other sectors, 
the Controls businesses have reacted quickly by
implementing cost reduction programmes. Sector
headcount and monthly operating expenses reduced by
10% and 8% respectively over the course of the year.
Further progress was made during the year in building a
more substantial, more integrated business around the
IS-Group. The Cabletec manufactured products were
made available to the IS-Group’s European network of 6 Diploma PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009
sub-distributors. In addition, the portfolio of high
performance wiring and interconnect products, which
share common suppliers, was aligned under a single
management team which will bring benefits in
purchasing, stock management and cross-European
sales opportunities.
Key Performance Indicators (“KPI’s”)
EPS and TSR Growth
The principal metrics used in measuring Group
performance over the longer term are growth in
adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) and total
shareholder return (“TSR”).
Adjusted EPS for the continuing businesses fell back
this year by 8% to 14.8p (2008: 16.0p), but measured
over a longer period, adjusted EPS has grown by an
average of 16% p.a. over the last five years. Over 
the same five year period, TSR has grown by 81%
compared with growth of 68% in the TSR for the 
FTSE 250 index.
The Group uses four further financial KPI’s which drill
down through the organisation and are used as the
principal quantitative elements in the short and long
term incentive programmes for senior management of
the operating businesses. Performance against these
KPIs is summarised below.
Revenue Growth
In 2009, the operating businesses were impacted 
by the dramatic downturn in global economies and
markets, but benefited from currency translation effects
and contributions from acquisitions. Revenue from
continuing businesses increased by 2% in the year,
though on an underlying basis adjusted for currency
effects and acquisitions, revenues declined by 12%.
Over five years, revenue has grown at 14% p.a. through
a combination of organic growth and acquisitions.
Operating Margin
As revenues reduced in 2009, cost reduction
programmes were quickly initiated. However, the impact
of these programmes has lagged the revenue reduction
and has not been sufficient to offset the effects of
operational leverage. Operating margins therefore
reduced in the year but remain at a healthy 16.0%, 
close to the average of 16.3% over the last five years.
Free Cash Flow
The Group is strongly cash generative over the business
cycle; over the last five years, an average of 99% of
adjusted profit after tax has been converted into free
cash flow. In 2009, in response to the reduction in
trading levels, working capital was reduced sharply
which resulted in a strong increase in operating
cashflow. With capital expenditure focused on a small
number of strategic projects, free cash flow of £23.5m
was generated, an increase of 33% over the prior year.
Return on Trading Capital Employed
Over the previous five years, return on trading capital
employed has remained consistently above 20%. 
In 2009, this has reduced to 19.0%, partly because of
the impact of the weak UK sterling on overseas trading
capital employed.
Non Financial KPIs
In the operating businesses, non financial KPIs are used
which are tailored to the particular requirements and
characteristics of each business. At the Group level, non
financial KPIs measure the success in managing two key
elements of the strategy, the management of human
resources and acquisitions.
In 2009, the key employee statistics were broadly
maintained in a year when there were significant
headcount and cost reduction programmes. Two
acquisitions were also completed in a difficult environment
where the supply of good quality acquisitions, with owners
who are ready to sell, has been limited.
The Group has delivered a resilient revenue and profit
performance, together with exceptionally strong free
cash flow, despite the recessionary environment
impacting most of its key markets. The Group has
reacted quickly and decisively in bearing down on
operating costs and working capital, while still investing
in selected growth initiatives. The Group is well
positioned to benefit from any market recovery.

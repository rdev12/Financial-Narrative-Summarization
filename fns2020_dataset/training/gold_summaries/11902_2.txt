1. Net revenue is revenue less the cost of mobile top-ups (where PayPoint is principal), SIM cards and other 
costs incurred by PayPoint, which are recharged to clients and merchants. These costs include retail agent 
commission, card payment merchant service charges and costs for the provision of call centres for mobile 
parking clients. Net revenue is a measure which the directors believe assists with a better understanding of 
the underlying performance of the group.
2. The reported period of 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014 contains 365 days. In the 2012 annual report, we 
announced we would move reporting to a calendar year basis from the last Sunday in the month of March. 
Comparative data is given for the 371 day period reported last year (i.e. 26 March 2012 to 31 March 2013). The 
impact of the extra week last year is generally to reduce stated growth by between 1 to 3 percentage points.
3. Operating profit including our share of joint venture results and excluding the £0.2m (2013: nil) costs 
associated with the acquisition of Adaptis Solutions Limited in the year.
4. Excludes special dividend in 2013.

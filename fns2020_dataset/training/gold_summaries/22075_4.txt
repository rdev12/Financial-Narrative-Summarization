differentiated and integrated 
education and care model 
focusing on children with  
high severity needs across 
three divisions:
Learning difficulties 
Supporting children and  
young people with conditions 
such as autism and learning 
difficulties, including care  
and education needs. 
Social, emotional and 
mental health 
Providing residential care and 
education to children with a  
range of complex conditions 
arising from challenging  
social circumstances or 
traumatic experiences such as 
abuse, neglect or exploitation. 
Helping children and 
adolescents with mental  
health needs and challenging 
behaviours to function in  
the community without  
ongoing support.
Providing specialist care  
for children who are deaf  
or have significant hearing 
impairment and associated 
challenging behaviours. 
Providing therapeutic fostering 
care and emotional support 
to children and young people 
with the highest needs who 
cannot be cared for by their 
own parents or family.
We provide these services  
in specialist residential 
homes, care homes, schools 
and colleges with specialist 
staff to support each  
setting. We also support 
these children through  
foster placements.

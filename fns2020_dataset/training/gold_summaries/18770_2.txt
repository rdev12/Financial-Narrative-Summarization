Financial and Operational Highlights

activity with 55 (2012: 9) homes sold 
generating revenue of £11.4 million

association demand for consented land; 
375 (2012: nil) plots sold generating  
revenue of £16.4 million. Drayton Garden

revenue of £5.3 million (2012: £6.7 
million)
•	 Land bank increased to 2,306 plots with 
1,057 consented
•	 Planning permission granted at Carter’s 
Quay, Poole and St John’s Hospital, 
Chelmsford

successful fundraisings totalling  
£13.7 million

conversion site in Gerrards Cross,

Outlook:
The Group’s housebuilding activity has had 
a strong start to the year; forward sales 
(Inland and DGVL) of £46.3 million secured 
and 486 units under construction; expect 
significant increase in number of homes

Chairman’s Statement
“It has been a very good year 
for Inland Homes. Our strategic 
move to increase the Group’s 
housebuilding activity has proved 
to have been well timed, while 
we continue to make progress in 
growing our land bank in terms of 
both size and quality.
“The Group is well financed and  
with market conditions in our  
favour, we are confident that 
we will make further progress 
throughout the course of this 
financial year and beyond.”

 RESULTS
Despite mixed macroeconomic conditions persisting throughout 
the year in many of the countries where we operate and challenging 
market conditions continuing to affect some of our sectors, I am 
pleased to report another excellent set of results at constant exchange 
rates. Significant currency translation movements, principally in the 
US dollar and euro, reduced the constant exchange Group growth 
rates by between 6% and 7%.
Group revenue increased to £6,156.5 million (2013: £6,097.7 million), 
and adjusted operating profit before intangible amortisation and 
acquisition related costs was £429.8 million (2013: £414.4 million). 
Adjusted earnings per share before intangible amortisation and 
acquisition related costs were 86.2p (2013: 82.4p).
At constant exchange rates revenue increased by 7%, due to organic 
growth of 3% combined with the impact of acquisitions, and adjusted 
operating profit rose by 10% as the Group operating margin improved 
from 6.8% to 7.0%. Adjusted earnings per share were up 11%. 
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 24.5p. This brings 
the total dividend for the year to 35.5p, up 10% compared to 2013. 
Shareholders will again have the opportunity to participate in our 
dividend reinvestment plan.
STRATEGY
Our consistent and proven strategy of developing the business 
through organic growth, consolidating our markets through 
focused acquisitions and continuously improving the efficiency 
of our operations has delivered another successful year of growth for 
the Group with all four business areas ahead of 2013 in both revenue 
and profits at constant exchange rates. 
Organic growth is achieved by continually redefining and deepening 
our commitment to our customers. By enabling our customers to 
outsource to Bunzl the purchasing, consolidation and distribution 
of a broad range of goods not for resale, they are able to benefit 
by achieving purchasing efficiencies and savings while at the 
same time freeing up working capital, improving their distribution 
capabilities, reducing carbon emissions and simplifying their 
internal administration. 
Acquisition activity continued at a good pace throughout 2014. 
Including Tillman, which we agreed to acquire in December 2014 and 
completed at the beginning of January 2015, we made 17 acquisitions 
with a total committed spend of £211 million, thereby adding 
annualised revenue of over £220 million. These acquisitions have 
helped to strengthen our position in many of the market sectors 
that we serve. 
INVESTMENT
Over time we have steadily invested in the business to support our 
growth strategy and to expand and enhance our asset base. During 
the year we have extended and improved our warehouses and opened 
new ones, both as a result of acquisitions and by consolidating our 
existing warehouse footprint. Our ability to serve our customers in 
the most efficient and appropriate manner is critical to our success 
and, as a result, we continuously upgrade our IT systems as we 
integrate new businesses into the Group and increase the 
functionality of our existing operations, thereby enhancing our 
customer offering.

£430m CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Sustainable business practice is important to Bunzl and refining 
our processes and operations to ensure improvements in this 
area is ongoing. Our ability to measure the improvement in our 
performance relies on the availability of high quality data for our key 
indicators and in this regard our environmental and accident data are 
now both subject to external assurance. We continue to engage with 
our suppliers to encourage them to adopt appropriate sustainable 
practices and ensure compliance with regulations. In this connection, 
our quality assurance/quality control team based in Shanghai 
regularly undertakes supplier audits to assist our suppliers in 
meeting our required standards.
EMPLOYEES
Although we are a large group, we strive to preserve the advantages 
and style of a small business, maintaining a flat organisation 
structure with decentralised decision making and clear lines of 
responsibility. In this way we are able to provide a responsive and 
tailored service offering to our customers. Bunzl is a service 
business and accordingly our employees across the world are our 
ambassadors. We are therefore very grateful for the knowledge, 
experience and continued enthusiasm shown by our employees who 
have played an important part in our strong performance. Further, 
we have welcomed a number of new employees through acquisitions 
we have made. In our view, the retention of employees post 
acquisition is key to the successful integration of newly acquired 
businesses and to bring in new ideas and improved processes that 
can then be applied elsewhere in the Group.

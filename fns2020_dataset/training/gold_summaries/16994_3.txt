48723 MG Annual Report - Front  17/4/08  11:39  Page 2 Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to announce that Wellstream
has achieved a record financial
performance during 2007. 
In addition, we successfully completed
the Initial Public Offering (IPO) and
listed our shares on the London Stock
Exchange on 1 May 2007.
Financial performance
In the 12 months to 31 December 2007,
Revenue increased by 81% to £266.8m
(2006: £147.2m), Adjusted EBITDA
increased by 136% to £56.9m (2006:
£24.1m), and adjusted earnings per
share reached 34.7p against 11.4p for
2006. We maintain a strong backlog
which has increased by £109.1m during
2007, ending the year at £335.9m.
Improved utilisation in Newcastle
High utilisation rates have been achieved
throughout the year in Newcastle and we
achieved a record throughput of 237 nkm.
This contributed substantially to our
buoyant performance this year. Following
a programme of process improvements,
we also revised our capacity in Newcastle
to 260 nkm and plan to further expand
that capacity.
Successful start-up of our new
production plant in Brazil
We officially opened the Niterói plant in
July 2007 having started production in
May and I am pleased to report that the
plant is already making a contribution in
excess of our expectations. In total we
achieved a throughput of 52 nkm, which
was ahead of our ramp-up plan. On
29 November 2007 we announced plans
to further expand capacity at Niterói,
recognising the Board’s confidence in
future demand for our products. 
Establishment of Seastream JV
In July 2007, we successfully established
a Joint Venture called Seastream. It has
secured a major contract from BHP Billiton,
in which we offered our products on
an installed basis for the first time.
This project is progressing to plan
and we look forward with confidence to
securing additional contracts for
installation of our flexible pipe products.
Board additions
I welcome the addition to the board of
three industry specialists, Neil Gaskell,
the former Treasurer of Royal Dutch Shell,
Francisco Gros, former CEO of Petrobras
and Pat Murray the former CEO of
Dresser Inc. I also welcome Chris Gill as
Finance Director, who joined us on
7 January 2008. Marek Gumienny, of
Candover Partners, resigned as a non-
executive director at the IPO and Andrew
Turk, Finance Director, left the Company
on 31 December 2007. I thank them both
for their contribution during a period of
rapid growth and considerable change
in the Company. 
Outlook
With our new investment in capacity, 
we have set the foundations to take
advantage of the anticipated demand for
flexible pipe. The market fundamentals
remain strong and we have confidence
that we are well positioned to capture a
significant share of this growing market.
Finally, I pay tribute to the professionalism
of our staff, whose hard work and
dedication have helped bring about these
record breaking results.

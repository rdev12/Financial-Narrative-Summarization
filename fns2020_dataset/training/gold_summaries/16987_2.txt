Market overview 
Market conditions improved in 2010 
underpinned by strong demand for com-
modities, particularly from emerging mar-
kets and a growing sector confidence. 
Most mothballed mines were re-started 
and increased activity was evident in the 
Canadian oil sands. Increases in capital 
expenditure were announced by some 
customers with a number of “mega-
projects” likely to get underway in 2011/12 
principally across South America and the 
Asia-Pacific region.
Weir Minerals is the global leader in the 
provision of slurry handling equipment 
and associated spare parts for abrasive 
high wear applications. Mining and min-
erals is the division’s largest sector but 
it has aligned product sales into niche 
markets, including oil sands and flue gas 
desulphurisation equipment. Products 
include pumps, hydrocyclones, valves, 
dewatering equipment and wear resistant 
linings and following the Linatex acqui-
sition – rubber products and screen-
ing machines. The partnership with KHD 
Humboldt extends the reach into high 
pressure grinding rollers, a new break-
through in milling technology.

Market overview 
The North American upstream mar-
ket experienced a substantial rebound 
in on-shore horizontal drilling with sig-
nificant investment in existing and new 
shale fields, requiring more intensive 
fracturing techniques. Average horizon-
tal rig counts increased 81% on 2009. 
International shale opportunities started 
to gain momentum in China, Europe and 
Australia. Downstream customer activity 
remained low while Middle East services 
market rebounded off 2009 lows in the 
second half.
Weir Oil & Gas designs and manufac-
tures pumps and ancillary equipment for 
the global upstream and downstream 
oil and gas markets and provides sub-
stantial aftermarket service and support. 
The upstream operation specialises in 
high-pressure well service pumps and 
related flow control equipment along 
with repairs, parts and service of pres-
sure control and upstream rotating equip-
ment. Downstream focuses on design 
and manufacture of centrifugal pumps, 
mainly for the refining industry. Principal 
operations are in North America, Europe 
and the Middle East, with an expanding 
geographic footprint in Asia Pacific and 
South America.

Market overview 
Demand for original equipment for the con-
ventional power market was strong in Asia 
but weak in Europe and North America. 
The Chinese nuclear market represented 
the majority of global nuclear new build, 
although procurement began for the first two 
new US nuclear plants in 25 years. Hydro 
and wind markets grew as demand for 
renewable power increased. Existing fossil 
and nuclear plants postponed non-essential 
maintenance, although new build delays will 
increase potential for life extension projects. 
Industrial markets remained weak.
Weir Power & Industrial designs, manufac-
tures and provides aftermarket support for 
specialist and critical-service rotating and 
flow control equipment mainly to the global 
power sector. The division includes valve 
operations; specialist pump, hydro and 
steam turbine businesses and aftermar-
ket operations in Europe, North America, 
Asia Pacific, Middle East, and South Africa. 
Three facilities hold nuclear certification 
making the business one of a few globally, 
capable of providing safety critical valves 
into the nuclear islands of the 3rd and 4th 
generation nuclear power stations. The 
BDK acquisition expanded the valve port-
folio, while American Hydro and Ynfiniti 
Engineering Services added to the renewa-
bles market position.

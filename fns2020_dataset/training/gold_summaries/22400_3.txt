Chairman’s statement
The transformation 
into a ﬁnancial 
services investment 
group is now 
virtually complete. 
The transformation into a ﬁnancial services 
investment group is now virtually complete. 
Four key platforms are now established and 
provide a well balanced business which is 
focused on lending to the SME market. The 
legacy mining and energy equity investment 
portfolio will continue to be steadily 
unwound to fund the development of these 
new platforms. Our target is to apply our 
investment policy to this equity portfolio so 
that it represents no more than 20% of gross 
assets of the Company.
































This industry background is 
important to the repositioned 
City of London Group because 
our strategy is to invest in 
platforms targeted at providing 
alternative sources of ﬁnance 
including asset based ﬁnance 
to the SME market. City of London Group plc

Chairman
25 June 2012
I expect the impact of the 
developments achieved in 
2011/12 to become apparent 
during 2012/13 as our 
platforms gain traction in 
each of their markets.

 Highlights 
Ubisense is a global leader in Enterprise Location Intelligence Solutions 
Operating through two divisions - Real-time Location Systems (RTLS) and Geospatial - we deliver best-in-class 
enterprise location intelligence solutions that significantly improve operational effectiveness and profitability for 
businesses around the world. 
Strategic highlights 
• 2015: A challenging year with lower than anticipated revenues against an increased, but now restructured, 
cost base 
• Restructuring complete: Decisive action taken to re-align and reduce costs by focusing on core geographies 
and markets, reassessing marketing strategy and reducing staff numbers 
• Key customer wins in both divisions: BMW Group, Ford, GM, John Deere, Magna Steyr, Nissan, Telus, 
Comporium and Nagoya Water. 
• Deeper customer relationships: Substantial deployments into existing Utilities and Telecoms customers in 
North America and across a number of global Manufacturing clients 
• Geographic consolidation: Further developed presence in Japan achieving first myWorld contract, while 
transitioning the South Korea and Singapore operations into partners 
• Partner channel successes: Worked successfully with Atlas Cop co across three major Automotive OEMs 
• Continued product development: Investment in both product lines maintained, with the next generation 
Dimension 4 RTLS platform fully deployed in three major production environments, and the mobile enhanced 
Geospatial myWorld 3.0 released in February 2016. 
Financial highlights 
• Revenue declined 37.3% from £35.1m to £22.0m with the results achieved in the higher margin solutions 
revenues in both divisions failing to offset the reduction in Geospatial sales, particularly in Europe 
• Gross margin decreased to 35.0% (2014: 39.9%) driven by the timing of new contracts and the revenue mix 
between new solution sales, installation projects and the scale of Geospatial services 
• Adjusted EBITDA* loss of £5.2m (2014: £1.8m profit) and further non-recurring costs of £4.1m (2014: £1.1m) 
and impairment charges of £4.1m (2014: £1.3m), led to an operating loss of £17.0m (2014: £4.6m) 
• £10m was raised from new and existing shareholders in May 2015 of which £2m was used to pay down a bank 
loan. The remainder was used for restructuring, and the support and development of the business 
• Cash balance was £5.4m (2014: £3.7m) and net debt£0.2m (2014: £3.2m) 
* Measured as operating profit excluding depreciation, amortisation/impairment and non-recurring costs such as reorganisation and 
acquisition costs.

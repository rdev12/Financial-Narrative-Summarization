 Homeserve has made signiﬁ cant progress in 
its ﬁ rst 12 months following the demerger of 
its Water Supply operation. The core home 
emergency businesses have continued to deliver 
outstanding organic growth in both proﬁ tability 
and policy membership. T o support this, we have 
been investing in the depth of management we 
require to continue to deliver sustained growth 
both in the UK and overseas.
We have completed our programme of disposals 
relating to the Commercial Outsourcing 
businesses. These have been replaced in the year 
with investment in a number of complementary 
acquisitions, principally relating to our Emergency 
Repair businesses, broadening the range of 
skills that we offer to our Household Insurer 
customers. We have also recently rebranded our 
Emergency Repair businesses as Homeserve, to 
provide increased clarity of service delivery for 
our customers.
Results
Turnover from continuing operations, including 
share of joint ventures, increased by 31.8% 
to £223m (2004: £169m). Proﬁ t before tax
*
increased by 29.3% to £42.0m (2004: £32.5m) 
and earnings per share
*
 increased by 29.7% to 
46.7p (2004: 36.0p).
When the impact of the discontinued 
operations is included, turnover including 
share of joint ventures decreased by 12.3% to 
£283m (2004: £323m) and adjusted earnings 
per share
*
 decreased by 4.7% to 48.7p (2004: 
51.0p). Exceptional costs totaling £41.9m 
principally result from the execution of our 
strategic decision to dispose of our Commercial 
Outsourcing operations. These changes will 
enable us to focus on our Home Emergency 
businesses, where we see better opportunities 
for growth and higher operating margins. These 
exceptional costs combined with goodwill 
amortisation of £10.4m (2004: £7.2m) result in 
a statutory loss before tax for the year of £8.6m 
(2004: proﬁ t £37.8m).
The Board is proposing a ﬁ nal dividend of £6.8m 
(being 10.9p per share). This, combined with 
Homeserve’s interim dividend of £3.2m (being 
5.1p per share) brings the total for the year to 
£10.0m, representing a total dividend per share 
of 16.0p. In 2004, total dividends payable were 
£12.7m, of which the demerged Water Supply 
operation paid £5.9m. After taking into account 
the share consolidation on 6 April 2004 and the 
dividend paid by the Water Supply operation, 
the current year dividend per share of 16.0p 
represents a 19.4% increase compared to the 
prior year.

*  pre goodwill and exceptional items (see proﬁ t & loss account and  “The core home emergency businesses have 
continued to deliver outstanding organic growth 
in both proﬁ tability and policy membership.”
Net cash at 31 March 2005 amounted to 
£11.2m (2004: net debt of £93.5m, of which 
£94.1m related to the Water Supply operation).
In line with Homeserve’s current internal 
reporting structure, we have now analysed our 
core Home Emergency businesses between 
“Policy Membership” and “Emergency Repair”.
Policy Membership 
The Policy Membership business has increased 
turnover to £131m (2004: £100m), with 
operating proﬁ ts
*
 increasing by 26.3% to £37.5m 
(2004: £29.7m). This increase is principally the 
result of continued organic proﬁ t growth in the 
utility branded businesses.
International is progressing well, with France 
reporting a full year operating proﬁ t for the ﬁ rst 
time having achieved policy growth of 75% to 
0.28 million. In the US we have just signed our 
third partner, United Water, which included the 
acquisition of 41,000 existing service line policies.
As reported at the interim results, our furniture 
warranty business has been affected by the 
difﬁ cult trading conditions in that market. In 
particular, the appointment of an administrator 
to Courts Plc has resulted in an exceptional 
operating cost of £2.8m relating to provisions 
against amounts owing to Homeserve. We 
do however believe that there continue to be 
signiﬁ cant new business opportunities in both 
retail and manufacturer warranty schemes.
Emergency Repair 
The Emergency Repair business has increased 
turnover to £100m (2004: £73m), with 
operating proﬁ ts
*
 increasing by 80.7% to £4.8m 
(2004: £2.7m). This increase is principally due to 
the continuation of the improved performance 
in our directly employed network for glazing, 
locks, plumbing and drainage repairs, resulting 
in an operating proﬁ t
*
 in that business of £3.1m 
(2004: £0.3m). The improvement has been 
achieved by better branch management and 
engineer productivity, together with growth in 
the directly employed network of plumbing and 
drainage engineers working for our Household 
Insurer customers. 
We have made progress this year in extending 
our service offering to insurers through two 
key acquisitions. In December 2004 we invested 
£11.4m in the acquisition of Sergon BRM, one 
of the UK’s leading home insurance sub-contract 
repair networks for water, ﬁ re, storm and other 
accidental damage. 
Additionally, in April 2005, we acquired Chem-
Dry, one of the UK’s leading ﬁ re and ﬂ ood 
disaster restoration and carpet and upholstery 
franchise cleaning networks, for £18.9m. 
The integration of these trades into our overall 
service offering is progressing well.

The Water Supply operation was demerged on 
6 April 2004, and in the period to demerger, 
contributed turnover of £1.0m (2004: £72m), 
and an operating proﬁ t
*
 of £0.2m (2004: 
£21.3m). The Commercial Outsourcing 
businesses contributed turnover of £59m (2004: 
£81m) and operating proﬁ t of £1.7m (2004: 
£5.0m). The sale proceeds from the disposal of 
the Commercial Outsourcing businesses amount 
to £22.4m.
Board Changes
On 30 November 2004 Ian Carlisle was 
appointed to the Board as an executive director, 
with responsibility for the Emergency Repair 
business. Ian joined Homeserve in 2003 as Chief 
Executive of the glazing and locks network 
and was previously the Managing Director of 
Autoglass Ltd.
Following the disposal of the Commercial 
Outsourcing businesses, Robert Harley stepped 
down as a director of Homeserve on 24 March 
2005. On behalf of the Board, I should like to 
thank Robert for his signiﬁ cant contribution to 
the business during his four years as a director.
Employees
The commitment of our employees has ensured 
that this has been a very successful year and I 
should like to thank them for their hard work 
and dedication.
Prospects
Homeserve is now focused on developing its 
Home Emergency businesses where we believe 
there are substantial opportunities for continued 
growth.
Our Policy Membership business is expected to 
continue to increase its market penetration in 
the UK and expand its international operations, 
particularly in the USA. This policy model 
continues to generate high levels of recurring 
revenue which provide good visibility of future 
proﬁ ts.
Our Emergency Repair business is continuing 
to generate improved margins. The broader 
range of services we now provide support both 
our Policy Membership operation and create 
a unique offering for our Household Insurer 
customers.
Over the coming year we will seek to 
complement our expected organic growth with 
strategic acquisitions both for Policy Membership 
and Emergency Repair operations. We will 
continue to invest in our International businesses 
and in strengthening our management teams to 
support sustained growth in the longer term.

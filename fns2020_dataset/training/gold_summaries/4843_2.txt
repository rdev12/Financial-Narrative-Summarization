Business Overview

Europe

Highlights
Despite the economic instability across Southern Europe, Unieuro’s  
customer offer has improved and the turnaround of the business has enabled 
Unieuro to trade ahead of its competitors. In the difﬁcult trading environment, 
further cost reduction has been identiﬁed to strengthen the business. 
A difﬁcult trading environment in Greece remains challenging for Kotsovolos. 
The business, however, remains the market leader and further actions  
to reduce costs in the business have limited the impact of the weak  
sales environment. 
Electroworld in Turkey continues to expand in an exciting growth market.
Highlights
PIXmania has experienced a difﬁcult year with a number of factors impacting 
performance, some of which could not have been foreseen. The natural 
disasters in Japan and Thailand severely limited the supply of key product 
lines in photography and digital storage.
PIXmania has been transforming its operating model and widening its 
product categories. PIXplace, its market place, continues to grow strongly 
with over 1,500 active third party resellers offering over 1.5 million products  
in 26 countries. PIXmania now operates 27 stores giving customers more 
ﬂexibility for reserve&collect. Further investments in E-merchant, its market 
leading e-commerce platform for third party customers, has seen it win the 
Carrefour account, launched in November 2011 and more recently Celio,  
one of France’s largest menswear brands with a launch planned for summer 
2012. It has also been streamlining processes and reducing costs.

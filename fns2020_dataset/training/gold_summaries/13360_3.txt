 Mavinwood plc annual report and financial statements 2007 4
Mavinwood plc
Strategy
Our objective is to acquire and develop
specialist support services businesses that have
the potential for growth, either organically or
in combination with other complementary
businesses. We are very much focussed on the
Emergency Repair and Document Handling
sectors.
Results
Revenue in 2007 was £68,153,000 (2006:
£42,453,000) and the profit before tax was
£5,047,000 (2006: £3,751,000). The profit
before amortisation of intangible assets, share
based payments charge and notional interest
on contingent consideration was £7,289,000
(see Chief Executive’s review for analysis)
(2006: £5,044,000). The basic earnings per
ordinary share were 0.56p (2006: 0.66p).
However, the measure we focus on as a Board
is the fully diluted earnings per share before
amortisation of intangible assets, share based
payments charge and notional interest on
contingent consideration. At this level, the
earnings per share for 2007 were 0.96p
compared to 0.81p in 2006, an increase of
19%. At 31 December 2007, net debt of the
Group amounted to £30,917,000 (2006:
£17,649,000).
Dividends
Mavinwood intends to re-invest profits in the
business and the Board do not recommend
declaring a dividend (2006: Nil).
Board
There were several changes to the Board
during 2007. Bob Guthrie was appointed as a
Non-Executive Director on 13 June 2007. Bob
was managing director of UK retail at the
international insurance broker, Willis Group
Limited, for 15 years. He has an in-depth
knowledge of and excellent relationships with
the UK insurance industry.
Also on 13 June 2007, Steve Watkins at that
time a Non-Executive Director, agreed to
become an Executive Director. Steve became
the Divisional Director responsible for the
Emergency Repair business. He was managing
director of ANSA, which specialises in drainage
surveys and repairs, for four years to 2005
when the company was acquired by
Mavinwood.
John Minton resigned on 26 October 2007 due
to ill health. John developed Restore with his
business partner prior to acquisition by
Mavinwood and assisted the expansion of the
Document Handling division. We all wish him
well with his early retirement. Ed Marshall,
Managing Director of Document Control
Services, has assumed John’s executive
responsibilities for our Document Handling
Division comprising Restore, Wansdyke and
Document Control Services.
People
The Group employed 1,262 people at 31
December 2007 (2006: 880 people). I would
like to express my thanks to all of them for
their respective contributions in 2007. 
Outlook
The Mavinwood Group ended the year with
two well established divisions and a current
market capitalisation in excess of £70 million.
Integration benefits are coming through in
the two divisions as well as good underlying
organic growth. After a few months of lower
than normal volumes at the end of 2007,
particularly in drainage, the Emergency Repair
business has started 2008 well with
instructions back to their early 2007 levels. The
Document Handling industry continues to
grow strongly in 2008 and our business is well
placed within the industry. 
We plan to add further complementary
businesses to divisions on a selective basis and
given the cash generative qualities of the
Group, there is scope over time to acquire
further businesses for cash.

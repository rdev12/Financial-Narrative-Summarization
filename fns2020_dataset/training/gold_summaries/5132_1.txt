Our Performance
OVERVIEW
During the last twelve months we 
have made significant progress in 
developing our Company. We are 
pleased with these financial results 
and are excited by the opportunities 
that exist in our marketplace, 
opportunities that we now feel better 
equipped to exploit than at any time 
in our history.
Total revenue on an organic basis 
(excluding the impact of acquisitions) 
for the year to 30 April 2010 was up 
10% on the prior year to £20.2 million. 
Analytics revenue increased by 18% to 
£15.2 million and now represents 75% 
of total organic revenue. Within this 
sales from international assignments 
grew 32%. 
We are also pleased with the 
renewal rate in our platform business 
which during the period was 80%, 
demonstrating the resilient nature of 
this business. 
Group underlying operating profit 
(before highlighted items) was up 7% 
to £2.5 million on an organic basis. 
Excluding the impact of non-trading 
foreign exchange movements, 
underlying operating profit (before 
highlighted items) showed an 
organic increase of 30% to £2.7 million 
compared to the prior year. 
This strong performance took place 
in the face of the continuing impact 
of the economic downturn, which 
required us to manage our costs 
carefully whilst ensuring that we 
continued to develop our business 
in line with the needs of our clients. 
As a result we have increased our 
organic gross margin from 53% to 54% 
and we have significantly increased 
our underlying operating margin 
(excluding non-trading foreign 
exchange movements) from 11.2% to 
13.3% on an organic basis.
 
COMBINED GROUP RESULTS 
The acquisitions of Xtreme and TMC 
have had a marginal impact on 
this year’s results given that these 
transactions were completed just 
17 days before our year end. In 
combination with the Ebiquity full 
year results, revenues were £21.2 
million (£20.2 million on an organic 
basis) and operating profit was £2.6 
million (£2.5 million on an organic 
basis).
Our cash position improved 
significantly during the year with 
a strong conversion of profits into 
cash. Cash flow of £2.4 million was 
generated from operating activities. 
At the time of the acquisition, net 
debt was £1 million.
Fully diluted underlying earnings per 
share increased from 5.28p to 5.55p.
THE NEW ECONOMIC REALITY HAS 
RESET THE MARKETING AND MEDIA 
AGENDA
In recent years, media and marketing 
spend has come under pressure as 
never before. The new economic 
reality facing most companies 
means that marketing executives 
are now being asked to justify every 
pound they spend in terms of value, 
effectiveness and financial return. 
“In the coming year we plan to create a powerful company 
capable of delivering our unique set of services to a growing 
number of international clients.”

Corporate procurement in particular 
is playing a large and growing part in 
the increasing trend to benchmark 
expenditure against clearly defined 
objectives and key performance 
indicators. 
In the USA, the CMO Council’s ‘State 
of the Market’ review stated that: 
‘31% of marketers expect to initiate or 
undertake marketing performance 
measurement programs in 2010’. 
Here in the UK, Marketing Week said: 
‘Insight and analytics have to be at 
the heart of how marketing addresses 
a transformed marketplace in 2010... 
marketing has no choice.’
EBIQUITY IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS 
TREND
This increasing need for 
accountability and transparency 
within the marketing community 
continues to be the key driver of our 
growth. Already a global leader in 
marketing and media analytics, our 
ambition is to become a dominant 
player in this growing market, and as 
the marketing and media landscape 
evolves, so our business opportunities 
will increase.
Media and marketing choices 
confronting our clients have 
expanded rapidly, and as media 
channels multiply, brand-owners 
demand integrated multi-channel 
solutions with the ability to measure 
the effect of their activities across 
platforms. The continuing growth of 
digital media in particular means that 
our clients now seek faster, higher 
quality and more actionable insights 
that ever before — and they expect 
the same from traditional media too.
Significantly it is global companies, 
operating in multiple geographies, 
which are the most focused on this 
agenda. As Western markets begin 
to recover from recession at different 
speeds, and greater opportunities 
appear in the BRIC markets, so the 
allocation of marketing and media 
funds across geographies has 
become one of the most important 
business decisions faced by our 
clients.
Chief Executive’s Review
It is for this reason that the 
development of our international 
business has continued throughout 
the year (see below). In particular, 
the acquisition of Xtreme Information, 
completed in April 2010, along with 
the acquisition of the outstanding 
interest in TMC (a German advertising 
monitoring business, in which we 
already held a 50% equity position) 
is set to transform our Company into 
a leading media and marketing 
analytics and insight business with 
unsurpassed global reach.
XTREME INFORMATION
Xtreme captures and archives 
over 25,000 new TV and press 
advertisements every month from 
over 60 countries worldwide. In 
addition, Xtreme captures internet 
banner advertisements for Western 
Europe as well as cinema, radio and 
outdoor advertisements for the UK 
and Germany.
The addition of Xtreme’s international 
data platform to Ebiquity’s UK and 
German advertising monitoring 
businesses, and in combination with 
Ebiquity’s international analytics and 
consultancy business, will enable 
the Company to offer a genuinely 
distinctive global offering. In addition, 
the combination of international 
competitive monitoring and media 
and marketing analytics will help to 
increase the Company’s penetration 
of this significant global market 
opportunity.
Xtreme Information
The benefits of our recent acquisition
In combination, our two companies provide us with the opportunity 
to build a company with:
• Greater global scale
• A wider and more comprehensive range
of products and services
• A more integrated customer service offering
• A stronger management team

Our Performance
The acquisition of Xtreme is part of 
our longer-term vision to build an 
integrated media and marketing 
intelligence business with global 
reach. Together, our companies 
provide us with the opportunity to 
build a Group with:
• Greater global scale;
• A wider and more comprehensive 
range of products and services; 
• A more integrated customer 
service offering; and
• A stronger management team.
In the coming months we will continue 
to focus on the smooth integration of 
our two businesses and I am pleased 
to report that we have made a good 
start. Our management teams are 
working closely together and we 
have begun to take the first steps to 
ensure that we can deliver the cost 
synergies that we have built into our 
projections, which are currently in line 
with our expectations.
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
For reasons described above, our 
international business has continued 
to expand significantly during the 
last twelve months, with revenue 
increasing by 32% to £8.0 million. We 
have also taken steps to ensure that 
we have strong representative offices 
in a growing number of geographies. 
In March 2010 we completed the 
acquisition of 82.5% of Excellence 
Media in Paris and have recently 
acquired a majority stake in Media 
Advisor in Milan.
 
In Germany, we are in the process of 
merging TMC with Xtreme Information 
GmbH, which will create a powerful 
competitive monitoring business in 
Europe’s most important advertising 
market. This step, together with 
the acquisition of a 51% majority 
stake in Billetts Germany (which we 
formalised in May 2010), will enable us 
to combine competitive monitoring 
and marketing and media analytics, 
a combination which has already 
proven successful in the UK.
In the US, Billetts America in New 
York is now beginning to partner with 
Xtreme’s office in Chicago to bring a 
combined analytics and monitoring 
and insight capability to our US-
based clients.
OUTLOOK
Looking forward, we plan to focus 
on completing the integration of 
Xtreme Information in order to create 
a powerful company capable of 
delivering our unique set of services 
to a growing number of international 
clients.
The process of integration has started 
well and we are confident that we will 
deliver the growth and cost synergies 
that will drive earnings.
The Company is now well positioned 
to exploit the global opportunity 
created through the development 
of market leading media monitoring 
and analytic businesses. We are 
excited by the opportunity that the 
next phase of our development 
affords.

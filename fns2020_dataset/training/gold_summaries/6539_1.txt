LAYING THE 
FOUNDATIONS 
FOR GROWTH
c hie F executive’s r ePOr t
Kari M Bitar
Last	year,	I	set	out	our	new	vision,	
strategy	and	organisation.	In	2013,	
we	made	substantial	progress	
implementing	the	strategy	and	
laying	the	foundations	for	growth.	
Aligning	the	organisation	by	species,	
giving	more	focus	to	research	
and	development	and	Asia,	and	
strengthening	our	core	capabilities	
have	been	very	well	received	by	
both	customers	and	employees.	
I am	encouraged	by	the	energy	and	
pace	of	change.	The	opportunity	for	
Genus	is	large	and	we	are	now	better	
placed	to	capture	a	growing	share.	
We	made	these	changes	in	a	
challenging	year	for	the	global	
agriculture	industry,	with	record	
feed	costs	holding	back	customer	
demand.	Despite	this,	Genus	was	able	
to	fund	its	investment	plans	while	
surpassing	last	year’s	record	results.
Group Performance
Revenue	was	1%	higher	than	in	2012,	
at	£345.3m.	Porcine	volumes	grew	by	
6%,	with	strong	increases	in	Asia	and	
particularly	in	China.	Bovine	volumes	
rose	5%,	driven	by	semen	produced	
in	India	at	lower	price	points.	Sales	of	
our	globally	produced	semen	grew	
1%,	held	back	by	poor	conditions	
in	Latin	America	in	the	first	half.
Adjusted	operating	profit	including	
joint	ventures	increased	by	1%	to	
£49.1m.	Higher	porcine	volumes	
drove	double-digit	profit	growth	
in	Asia.	Genus	PIC	grew	4%,	with	
positive	contributions	from	all	
regions	and	particular	strength	in	
Latin	America,	where	we	continue	
to	transition	customers	to	our	
royalty	model.	In	Genus	ABS,	
trading	was	challenging	and	profit	
declined	by	5%.	Drought	affected	
key	markets	including	Brazil	and	
North	America,	leading	to	subdued	
demand.	Research	and	development	
costs	increased	by	12%,	as	we	
invested	in	key	research	projects	
and	were	affected	by	high	feed	
costs	in	our	genetic	nucleus	farms.	
strategy 
The	strategy	we	defined	in	2012	
is	designed	to	deliver	our	vision	
of	‘Pioneering	animal	genetic	
improvement	to	help	nourish	the	
world’.	Our	focus	in	2013	has	been	
on	implementing	this	strategy.	
increasing Genetic c ontrol 
and Product Differentiation
In	2013,	we	became	the	first	
company	to	implement	single-
step	genomic	evaluation	across	
a	full	range	of	animal	traits	in	our	
porcine	business.	The	early	results	
are	very	encouraging,	with	the	
much	higher	accuracy	in	breeding	
programmes	more	than	doubling	
the	rate	of	genetic	improvement	
in	key	traits	such	as	litter	size.
In	dairy	product	development,		
we	have	established	a	very	
large	animal	database,	enabling	
us	to	produce	proprietary	and	
economically	focused	indices	
of	bull	merit,	specific	to	our	
customers’	needs.	In	North	
America,	we	launched	Real	World	
Data
TM
,	a	genetic	index	focused	
on	economic	traits	such	as	milk	
production,	fertility	and	lifetime	
feed	efficiency.	We	initiated	an	elite	
female	programme	to	gain	greater	
genetic	control	and	increased	the	
proportion	of	genomic	young	sires	
in	our	dairy	product	portfolio.
Our	research	programmes	focus	on	
areas	that	can	produce	step	changes	
in	product	differentiation,	including	
genomic	evaluations,	disease	
resistance	and	gender	skew.	Our	
‘discovery	without	walls’	approach	
has	continued	to	bring	the	best	
genetics	into	Genus	from	wherever	
we	find	them.
t argeting Key Markets and s egments
Over	half	the	world’s	porcine	market	
is	in	China.	To	build	a	business	
to	address	it	effectively,	we	have	
invested	in	high-health	production	
capacity	and	strengthening	
customer	relationships.	In	2013,	
we	opened	a	new	porcine	nucleus	
farm,	Chun	Hua,	stocked	with	the	
latest	North	American	genetics,	
to	reduce	the	genetic	lag	of	our	
Chinese	product	offering.	We	
recruited	a	general	manager	for	
our	porcine	business	in	China	and	
significantly	grew	the	team’s	size	
and	capability	across	all	disciplines.	
We	also	announced	two	joint	
ventures	with	customers,	to	provide	
multiplication	capacity	and	to	serve	
these	growing	integrated	pork	
producers.	The	first,	Besun,	is	now	
operational	and	delivering	very	
good	performance.	The	second,	with	
Shennong,	is	on	track	to	establish	
operations	in	a	new	farm	in	2014.	We	
continue	to	have	active	discussions	
with	other	customers	and	partners.	
Genus	also	made	good	progress	
in	a	wide	range	of	other	growth	
markets	in	2013,	including	the	
Philippines,	Russia	and	Mexico,	while	
in	the	important	North	American	
market	our	performance	was	solid	
in	both	porcine	and	bovine.
In	dairy,	we	are	focusing	on	ten	key	
markets	and	targeting	the	rapidly	
growing	large	commercial	and	
enterprise	farms.	This	segment	
requires	profit-focused	indices	
and	high-touch	technical	services.	
We	are	steadily	introducing	this	
model	in	the	US,	with	plans	to	
expand	it	in	other	key	markets.
t ailoring the Business Model
Our	focus	here	is	to	ensure	our	
products	meet	the	needs	of	our	
target	markets	and	to	implement	best	 Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 13

practices	to	maximise	value	capture.	
For	example,	to	provide	differentiated	
high-merit	genetics	in	the	large	
Indian	dairy	market,	we	imported	
embryos	from	North	America	and	
now	have	four	young	bulls	and	a	
pipeline	of	further	pregnancies.
In	porcine	in	Europe,	we	have	
moved	away	from	direct	sales	of	
parent	gilts	and	rebuilt	our	team	to	
create	the	skills	and	structure	for	
an	indirect,	royalty-based	business,	
similar	to	our	successful	Americas	
porcine	business.	We	are	making	
clear	progress	and	this	transition	
will	gather	momentum	over	time.
strengthening c ore c ompetencies
We	have	implemented	globally	
consistent	organisations	
and	practices	in	key	account	
management,	technical	services	
and	supply	chain.	This	has	enabled	
us	to	spread	best	practice	to	
customers	around	the	world.	We	
have	strengthened	these	teams	with	
targeted	hiring	and	international	
assignments.	In	addition,	we	created	
a	marketing	organisation	to	improve	
product	branding	and	pricing.	
Lastly,	we	introduced	a	consistent	
performance	management	process	
across	geographies	and	functions,	to	
ensure	we	embed	our	values	and	to	
strengthen	our	performance	culture.
Our People
In	March	2013,	John	Worby	
retired	from	Genus.	I	would	like	
to	pay	tribute	to	his	outstanding	
contribution	and	to	thank	him	for	
helping	my	induction	to	the	Company	
and	for	assisting	Stephen	Wilson,	our	
new	Group	Finance	Director,	with	his	
seamless	transition	into	the	role.	John	
was	a	source	of	great	knowledge	
and	wisdom	and	we	wish	him	well.	
The	Genus	Executive	Leadership	
Team	(‘GELT’)	welcomed	three	
new	members	during	the	year.	In	
addition	to	Stephen,	Saskia	Korink	
Romani	joined	us	as	Chief	Marketing	
Officer	and	Tom	Kilroy	is	our	new	
Group	General	Counsel	&	Company	
Secretary.	Each	brings	a	wealth	
of	experience	and	talent	and	I	am	
delighted	with	the	way	that	they	
have	integrated	with	the	team.	In	
July	2013,	Ricardo	Campos,	the	
Chief	Operating	Officer,	Genus	ABS,	
decided	for	personal	reasons	to	step	
down	from	GELT	and	refocus	on	
the	important	Latin	America	ABS	
business.	His	passion	and	energy	will	
continue	to	be	valuable	to	Genus.	
Saskia	Korink	Romani	has	assumed	
the	role	of	acting	Chief	Operating	
Officer,	Genus	ABS,	to	provide	
leadership	to	our	bovine	business.
Over	the	course	of	the	year,	we	
introduced	new	Company-wide	
performance,	development	and	
talent	processes.	We	also	added	
strength	and	depth	by	recruiting	
many	talented	individuals.	I	would	
like	to	thank	all	employees	for	
their	commitment	to	our	new	
strategic	direction	and	for	delivering	
results	in	challenging	markets.	
Outlook
Good	harvests	are	predicted	in	the	
northern	hemisphere	which	should	
result	in	lower	input	costs	and	an	
improvement	in	profitability	in	the	
dairy,	beef	and	porcine	industries.	
We	expect	this	to	lead	to	a	gradual	
improvement	in	market	conditions	
for	our	customers	and	demand	for	
our	products.	We	therefore	expect	
the	second	half	of	this	fiscal	year	
to	be	stronger	than	the	first.	
Our	strategic	initiatives	better	
position	Genus	to	capture	the	
significant	growth	potential	in	
the	animal	genetics	market.	I	am	
confident	that	2014	will	be	a	year	
of	accelerating	progress,	both	
operationally	and	financially.

Helping Customers to 
Benefit from Our Genetic 
Improvements
Genus PIC’s Genetic Services team works 
with more than 150 customers around 
the world. 
It ensures customers understand the value that genetic 
improvement brings, helps them to optimise their use  
of our genetics, and encourages them to multiply our 
genetics quickly, so they can rapidly realise the benefits. 
Finally, the team manages on-farm implementation of  
our genetic programme in our customers’ herds.
Our commitment to delivering results for customers  
is evident in Genetic Services’s approach to hiring and 
training its people. In the last two years alone, the team 
has added five highly talented PhD geneticists from 
Asia, Europe, North America and Latin America. This 
focus on quality helps Genetic Services achieve notable 
results, with the rate of genetic improvement in North 
American boar studs doubling in 2013, compared with 
the three previous years.  Genus plc Annual Report 2013 | 15

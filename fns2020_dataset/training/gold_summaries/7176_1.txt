Introduction
In June 2013 I wrote about the 
15 month period to 31 March 2013 being 
one characterised by tumultuous change.  
As I write this a year later and looking 
back at the 12 months to 31 March 2014 
the period can be characterised by 
successfully managing signiﬁ cant growth.  
Our 2014 ﬁ nancial year has been a “cracker” 
and I am encouraged by the progress that 
has been made across the Group and 
the foundations which have been laid for 
continuous improvement and growth. Against 
an improving market environment we are 
well positioned to capitalise on whatever 
opportunities we may seek to pursue. It is 
our people who make this possible and who 
have successfully managed this transition 
so a special thank-you to you all for your 
continued dedication, perseverance, sense 
of humour and hard work.
Performance Review
For reporting purposes we split our business 
into two segments, Original Equipment (“OE”) 
and Aftermarket (“AM”). During the year the 
Group successfully increased the proportion 
of revenues which it derives from OE and 
delivered an overall increase in margins. This 
is a strategically important target as the Group 
looks to seed its markets with new units which 
will provide the source of future AM business.  
The trend gives a clearer picture with the OE:AM 
split moving from 30%:70% in 2012-13 to 
35%:65% in the ﬁ rst half of 2013-14 and 
45%:55% in the second half giving a mix for 
the full year of 41%:59% (against a longer 
term target of 50%:50%).

 Chief Executive’s 
Business review
In headline growth terms revenues were up in 
both segments, up 77% in OE and 14% in AM 
(on a like for like basis), both signiﬁ cant increases 
in their own right but particularly so when set 
against the backdrop of the reduced footprint 
initiative at our main manufacturing facility in 
Luton. The ability of the team in Luton to manage 
this whilst delivering such a signiﬁ cant increase in 
the number of units shipped (from 32 during the 
15 month period to 41) is testament to them, the 
processes which they have put in place and a 
real example of our Strategy in Action. This has 
manifested itself through not only a signiﬁ cant 
jump in the “beat-rate” at the factory but also in 
a reduction in unit arrears of 32% during the year. 
This improvement is obviously helping greatly in 
the development of our strategic relationships, 
both with our customers but also with our supply 
chain. On the customer side, during the year 
we announced a strategic relationship with our 
biggest customer in the oil and gas market, 
Eureka and we are in active discussions with 
other customers to develop closer ties more 
aligned with their requirements and our focus 
of “On Time in Full”. On the supply chain side we 
have continued to develop our supply chain so 
that we have a deeper relationship with a smaller 
number of suppliers again working on the basis 
to deliver “Quality at Cost” and “Right First Time”. 
This is already leading to beneﬁ ts in terms of 
reduced lead times and improved and more 
consistent quality.
Given the operational improvements across 
both OE and AM the segment operating proﬁ t 
performance was up signiﬁ cantly against the 
last period by 61% on a like for like basis. 
A year of signiﬁ cant
growth with more 
to come”
Our 2013-14 focus
•  Continue to drive operational 
improvements at our main manufacturing 
facility in Luton;
•  Improve margins whilst growing revenues 
and moving the mix towards a more 
balanced split between “OE” and “AM”;
•  Generate sufﬁ cient cash internally to 
fund the growth of the business; and
•  Improve communication across 
the business. 
What happened
�  Revenues increased by over 30% with an 
improvement in gross and operating margins 
whilst completing the reduced footprint initiative 
in Luton; 
�  Split between OE:AM moved from 30%:70% 
to 41%:59%;
�  Growth delivered using internally generated 
cash and within new banking facilities; and
�  Improved communication through a number 
of forums within the Group and sharing of best 
practice.
Priorities for 2014-15
�  Manage the longer-term growth prospects whilst 
maintaining the short-term output requirements 
particularly in light of the Luton led grant funding 
opportunities;
�  Continue to generate sufﬁ cient cash internally 
to fund expected growth and the related 
investment; and
�  Continue to improve communication across the 
Group and with our customers and supply chain.
Setting Hayward Tyler’s priorities 9 Hayward Tyler Group PLC Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014

This was driven by a combination of growth of 
18% in AM but also the elimination of operating 
losses in OE, which have long been a hindrance 
to the overall Group performance. Therefore 
whilst the absolute amount of segment operating 
proﬁ t generated by OE was relatively small, the 
Board believes there is still scope for further 
improvement.
Order intake
Against this backdrop of increased revenues, 
operational and margin improvements it was 
very encouraging to see continued growth in 
order intake which ended the year up 16% on a 
like for like basis. More importantly this represents 
an increase of over 1.4x historical revenues 
against the Company’s target of 1.1x (see KPIs). 
The order intake remains broadly spread across 
a range of geographies with China growing in 
relative importance based on the strength of the 
OE business. Power remains the largest sector 
(which includes both OE and AM) representing 
57% of order intake followed by Nuclear (15%) 
and Oil & Gas (12%). This reﬂ ects a renaissance 
in the nuclear sector driven by a strong AM 
performance in South Korea, Sweden and the 
US. Whilst Oil & Gas fell from 19% last period 
to 12% this year the outlook remains positive 
and the Board’s expectations are that this will 
grow as a percentage of overall order intake in 
the coming years. 
All of the above gave the Company an order 
book at 31 March 2014 of £28.8 million, a ﬁ gure 
broadly in line with the position at the end of 
the last period despite the underlying increase 
in revenues of 33% on a pro rata basis.
Stakeholders
As highlighted above, the business continues 
to develop and grow from strength to strength.  
This is still very much work in progress and we 
would not have been as successful in this regard 
if we didn’t have the support and patience of all 
our stakeholders; our suppliers, our customers 
and especially our employees. Thank-you.
The Future
As the expression goes, the future is bright. 
The business is on a much stronger operational 
footing and therefore better placed to take 
advantage of the opportunities which are 
presenting themselves in the energy market 
globally. With our Luton facility having the 
potential to participate in both the Regional 
Growth Fund and Civil Nuclear Sharing in 
Growth programmes our operational ability to 
deliver growth will be ﬁ rmly underpinned. There 
are numerous game-changers which the Group 
is now able to invest in and work on including 
the offshore oil and gas market, the civil nuclear 
market and the wider growth of cleaner fossil 
ﬁ red power generation in China and India.
This overall positive market outlook combined 
with our improving ability to deliver gives me 
signiﬁ cant conﬁ dence in our ability to turn our 
200th anniversary year in 2015 into a very 
special one to celebrate.

I am pleased to report that for
the year ended 30 June 2008
the Group has performed
ahead of the prior year and in
line with expectations
notwithstanding an
increasingly challenging
operating environment.
The Group’s performance reflects
management’s actions in recent years
to develop Davenham’s infrastructure
and risk controls, and the continued
strengthening of the Group’s position
as the leading, independent asset-
based lender to the UK SME sector. 
Our Performance
These are the first full year results to
be prepared under International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and all figures for the comparative
period are restated under IFRS. 
In the year ended 30 June 2008,
Group revenue increased by 27% to
£53.1m (2007: £41.8m). Operating
profit before taxation and before
exceptional items, rose by 13% to
£13.1m (2007: £11.6m) and earnings
per share increased by 7% to 35.75p
(2007: 33.44p).
At the year end, £211m had been
drawn down from the Group’s £300m
funding facilities and the loan portfolio,
including letters of credit, stood at
£284m (2007: £271m). 
The IFRS impairment charge for the
year rose to £7.4m (2007: £6.3m),
primarily driven by the weakness of
the property market and the falling
number of redemptions resulting from
lower sales volumes.
Group net assets increased by 12% 
to £58.2m (2007: £51.9m). 
Dividend Policy
The Board’s stated progressive
dividend policy takes account of the
underlying growth in long-term
earnings and the capital base of the
Group, while acknowledging the
requirement for continuing investment
to underpin growth over the longer
term. However, and as indicated in 
the Chief Executive’s Statement below, 
the current economic downturn is
expected to have an adverse effect 
on the Group’s business, impacting
earnings and the capital base of the
Group. The Board has, therefore,
concluded that it is prudent to take
action ahead of an anticipated
reduction in profitability and,
accordingly, the Board is
recommending a reduction in the final
dividend to 7.00p (2007: 10.38p) per
share. The total dividend for the year
will be 11.68p per share (2007:
14.83p).
Subject to shareholder approval at the
Group’s Annual General Meeting, the
final dividend will be payable on 31
October 2008 to shareholders on the
register at close of business on 3
October 2008. 
In future years, the Board intends to
resume its progressive dividend policy
from a lower base.
Our People
Our people are our most valued asset
and on behalf of the Board I would like
to thank all of our employees for their
tremendous contribution and
continued focus during these
challenging times. We are confident
that the professionalism of our high
calibre and well-trained staff will
continue to deliver the strong service
and risk management culture which is
the cornerstone of the Group’s
development. 
Summary
We have made significant investment
in the business over the past few
years, continuing to strengthen our
credit and risk processes following the
appointment of our Risk Director,
David Bowles, 18 months ago.
Against the background of a
challenging economic climate and an
increase in the level of impaired debt,
we have taken decisive action to
consolidate the business, to control
costs and to concentrate our
resources on effectively managing the
business through these conditions. 
We remain cautious for the medium
term, but will continue to focus on
achieving longer term shareholder
value.

Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s Strategic and Performance Overview
Our strategic positioning and growth initiatives have 
enabled the Building Products division to outperform 
growth rates in the UK construction sector by around 
3% per annum for the last five years.
Strategic overview
Alumasc’s strategic objectives are to continue 
to develop and invest in our market leading 
building products businesses, primarily through 
organic growth but also through selective 
acquisitions. In addition, we will continue  
to grow and develop Dyson Diecastings  
by winning new work and improving 
operational efficiencies.
Over the last year the Board concluded  
its review of where Alumasc’s best 
opportunities lie for focusing and directing 
group resources in building value for 
shareholders. The outcomes were:
1. The decision to focus the group’s strategy 
for future profitable growth on our market 
leading building products businesses;
2. Strategic reviews of each of our businesses 
during the year identified a number of 
exciting opportunities for further organic 
growth and synergy:
• Alumasc Rainwater and the existing 
Harmer and Gatic drainage brands, 
complemented by the introduction  
of new products, were combined on  
1 July 2015 to form one holistic rainwater 
and drainage business, Alumasc Water 
Management Solutions;
• there is increasing evidence in our order 
books of the anticipated recovery of 
Levolux towards mid-cycle revenues and 
operating margins. This will be leveraged 
by the development of balcony products 
and growth in export sales;
• a planned major product range expansion 
at Timloc; and
• further growth potential in our roofing 
and walling businesses, including new 
product introductions and investment 
in additional high quality sales and 
commercial resources; and
3. The decision to sell: 
(a) Alumasc Precision Components (“APC”), 
the group’s loss making engineering 
products business. The sale of APC,  
which was completed on 26 June 2015 
for cash consideration of £5.8 million,  
will be significantly earnings and cash flow 
enhancing for the group in the 2015/16 
financial year; and 
(b) Pendock Profiles, a small non-core building 
products business, sold in September 2014 
for £1.5 million.

The initial results from this more focused 
strategic approach began to be evident in  
the financial year to 30 June 2015 when  
the group’s rate of revenue and profit growth 
from continuing operations accelerated, with 
group revenues ahead by 10% and underlying 
profit before tax increasing by 16%.
The business model and KPIs for Alumasc’s 
building products activities, which in 2014/15 
represented over 90% of group revenues and 
profit from continuing operations, are set out 
on pages 6 and 7. This highlights:
• our strong strategic positioning in sustainable 
building products market niches, particularly 
those connected with the management of 
the scarce resources of energy and water  
in the built environment;
• our continuing investment in people and 
innovation to underpin the delivery of the 
medium to longer term growth potential  
of our business. The related average annual 
incremental cost of this investment absorbed 
within operating profit over the last five 
years is approaching £1 million per annum, 
with an investment of just over £1 million 
planned for the 2015/16 financial year;
• our increasing penetration of higher growth 
markets within the UK such as London and 
the South East where some of our businesses 
were historically under-represented;
• a better balance of end-user markets for our 
building products sales, particularly through 
penetration of refurbishment markets 
(illustrated by the chart on page 11);
• our ability to leverage existing routes  
to market with new products and 
development of e-commerce channels; and
• the continuing expansion of our international  
reach, particularly through Levolux and Gatic.
These strategic initiatives have enabled our 
Building Products division to outperform 
growth rates in the UK construction sector by 
around 3% per annum over the last five years, 
see page 7.
In view of the actions being taken to 
exploit the organic growth and synergistic 
opportunities described above, management 
believes Alumasc can continue to outperform 
forecast UK construction market growth over 
the coming years.
Performance overview
Once again, the Board is pleased to report the 
group’ s highest annual profit from continuing 
operations since 2007/08. Underlying profit 
before tax advanced to £8.4 million compared 
with £7.2 million in 2013/14, an increase of 16%.
This improved performance was driven entirely 
by our building products activities, with every 
operating segment in the building products 
division recording better results than a year ago.
Group revenues from continuing operations 
increased by 10% to £98.1 million (2013/14: 
£88.9 million), driven by a £10.0 million increase 
in Building Products revenues partly offset  
by a £0.8 million reduction in Dyson  
Diecastings’ revenues.
The group’s underlying operating profit 
increased to £9.0 million (2013/14: £7.8 million) 
and operating margins improved to 9.2%, some 
0.5 percentage points above the prior financial 
year, as sales revenue growth allowed better 
leverage of Building Products’ overheads.
Interest costs on borrowings were similar  
to the prior financial year. However, net bank 
financing charges in total were a little higher 
than in the prior year at £0.6 million due to  
the accelerated amortisation of banking fees  
as we completed our routine refinancing of  
the group (discussed in the Financial Review)  
earlier than anticipated.
The resultant group underlying profit before  
tax from continuing operations improved to 
£8.4 million (2013/14: £7.2 million).
Total profit for the year (after discontinued 
operations and tax) improved from £4.0 million 
in 2013/14 to £4.4 million in 2014/15. A 
reconciliation between underlying profit before 
tax and profit for the year is shown on page 14. 
Group cash generation for the year was  
again strong with EBITDA (earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) 
from continuing operations increasing to  
£10.6 million (2013/14: £9.1 million). Following  
the sale of APC just prior to the financial year 
end, the group finished the year in a debt-free 
position. A more detailed review of the group’s 
cash flow performance is provided in the 
Financial Review on page 14.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share from continuing 
operations improved by 19% to 18.4 pence 
compared with 15.4 pence in 2013/14, 
reflecting the higher underlying profit before 
tax combined with a reduction in the group’s 
underlying tax rate from 24% to 22% in line 
with the reduction in UK corporation tax rates. 
The number of shares in issue was unchanged 
in the year.
Basic earnings per share from continuing 
operations increased from 13.4 pence to  
15.0 pence, reflecting improved underlying 
profits and also higher non-cash pension 
scheme financing costs calculated under IAS19.
Basic earnings per share (after discontinued 
operations) improved by 9% from 11.3 pence 
to 12.3 pence. 
Future prospects
The group’s order books at 30 June 2015 were 
£26.5 million, 27% ahead of 30 June 2014. 
Whilst the timing of larger construction 
contracts can impact the outcome in any 
one year, and two large multi-million pound 
contracts (Kitimat and Chiswick Park Building 
7) completed in the second half of 2014/15, 
Alumasc is increasingly well positioned to 
benefit from the current forecast growth in both 
the UK economy and UK construction output. 
Dividends
In view of the improved results for the year 
and the exit from APC, the Board is proposing 
an increased final dividend of 3.5 pence per 
share (2013/14: 2.8 pence), to be paid on 28 
October 2015 to shareholders on the register 
on 2 October 2015. This would give a total 
dividend for the year of 6.0 pence per share 
(2013/14: 5.0 pence), an increase of 20%. The 
Board confirms its previous intention to grow 
the dividend broadly in line with the growth in 
underlying earnings, having regard to the cash 
required to invest in the business to support 
delivery of the group’s growth ambitions and 
its pension scheme funding commitments.

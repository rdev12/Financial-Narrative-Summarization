* With effect from 1 December 2009 the Company and the Trustee of the Travis Perkins’ defined benefits pension scheme agreed to cap future pensionable salary increases at a 
maximum of 3% per annum. This created a curtailment event. The resulting exceptional reduction in the benefit obligation of £32.7m has been included in other operating income. 
In 2008 the Group incurred an exceptional charge of £56.2m associated with the severe downturn in the construction market. Throughout these financial statements the term 
“adjusted” has been used to signify that the effect of these exceptional items has been excluded from the disclosure being made.

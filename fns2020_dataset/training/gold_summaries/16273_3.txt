I am pleased to report that, in the year ended 31
March 2005, Business Post enjoyed continued
success.
FINANCE
On turnover up 21% at £233.3m, operating profit increased
by 9% to £20.8m, pre-tax profit by 7% to £20.5m, and
earnings per share by 9% to 26.6p, in all cases before
deducting goodwill amortisation of £0.5m (2004: £0.4m).
Statutory operating profit, pre-tax profit and earnings per
share were £20.3m, £20.0m and 25.7p respectively.
After-tax returns on average net assets increased further, 
to 26.9% (2004: 26.5%).
DIVIDENDS
A final dividend per share of 12.8p, up 6%, is proposed,
payable on 21July 2005 to shareholders on the register at
the close of business on 1 July 2005. The ex-dividend date 
is 29 June 2005.  Together with the interim dividend per
share of 6.4p, proposed dividends per share are 7% higher
at 19.2p.
BUSINESS
Progress across the Group during the year was again in line
with the strategy articulated in 2001.  
The core Express business, representing our UK business-
to-business parcel activity,  grew its turnover ahead of
expectations and, in so doing, increased its market share to
around 8%.
Amongst the newer and smaller businesses, of special note
again was the strong growth in HomeServe, operating in the
business-to-consumer market.  HomeServe’s turnover
increase of 54% means that it has grown eight-fold since it
was relaunched in April 2002.
The most recently launched business, UK Mail, which
commenced trading in May 2004, had an outstanding first
year and is on track to achieve the Group’s prediction of a
3% share of the mail market by the end of its third year.
FTSE 250
Since 2001, turnover has increased by 89%, pre-tax profit by
61% and earnings per share by 57%.  Reflecting this
sustained progress, and strong prospects for the future, I am
delighted to report that Business Post became a member of
the FTSE 250 index in January 2005.
PERSONNEL
We announced at the beginning of May that Russell Hodgson,
the director responsible for Parcel Services, would be leaving the
Group on 30 September 2005, for health reasons. Following a
restructuring within Parcel Services, the Express, International
and HomeServe business units and Network Services will report
directly to Paul Carvell, Chief Executive.  Russell has contributed
substantially to the considerable success enjoyed by Business
Post since 2001, when he joined us as Group Operations
Director, and we shall be sorry to lose him.  
As reported in the 2004 Report & Accounts, Philip Stephens
was appointed a non-executive director on 1 April 2004,
whilst Richard Saville retired as a non-executive director on
31 May 2004.
To the Group’s employees and associates throughout our
parcel, mail and other specialist distribution networks, I
extend my thanks on behalf of all shareholders.
PROSPECTS
The Board expects substantial progress in the current year and
remains very confident about the Group’s long term potential.

10% increase in revenue:
Revenue increased by 10% to £132.8 million.  The growth is attributed to an increase in revenue
of £12.7 million in the Vantage division resulting from improved revenue margins, increased
assets under administration and a full year’s revenue on assets secured in the previous year.  
The proportion of recurring revenue i.e. management fees, renewal commission and interest,
remained high at 70% (2008: 72%). 
Operating profit margin of 52.5%:
Costs have been well controlled during the year.  The Group’s operating margin has increased to
52.5%.  The increase resulted from 10% revenue growth coupled with an increase to operating
costs of just 1%.
£11.9 billion total assets under administration:
The 7% growth in asset values is attributable to strong new business volumes which more 
than oﬀset the signiﬁcant market decline. There was a 24% fall in the FTSE All-Share index

2011 Results
UBM had a strong year in 2011. Revenues grew 9.3% 
to £972.3m (2010: £889.2m) and adjusted operating 
profit increased 17.5% to £201.9m (2010: £171.8m). 
The adjusted operating profit margin over the year 
was 20.8% (2010: 19.3%), reflecting the strong 
performance in our events businesses and also the 
consistent on plan delivery of our other businesses. 
Adjusted profit before tax* increased to £177.4m 
(2010: £156.4m). Fully diluted adjusted EPS 
was 56.8p, an increase of 6.6p over the prior year 
(2010: 50.2p).
2011 Achievements
W e have made great progress across all our businesses 
in the course of 2011. Further acquisitions, notably 
of events businesses, and disposals of print assets 
together with organic growth initiatives continue our 
strategy of focusing on attractive communities and 
growing economies. Product investment around PR 
Newswire and our Data Services businesses will raise 
the value of our business in the coming years.
The strength and resilience of our Events business 
continues to underpin overall Group performance, 
accounting for 40.9% (2010: 34.9%) of Group 
revenue and 62.5% (2010: 51.7%) of Group 
operating profit excluding corporate costs. In 2011 
we successfully delivered over 400 events (2010: 
over 300). Events were organised in 31 different 
countries (2010: 21 countries) and there were 11 new 
geo-adapted events. Events floor space for our annual 
events was 1.2 million m
2
 in 2011 compared to 
0.9 million m
2
 in 2010, and the number of attendees 
at our events grew from 1.2 million to 1.5 million (up 
25%) further illustrating our determination to offer 
an ever bigger and better face-to-face experience to 
the business communities we serve.
Our ‘GEM’ initiative, driving best practice across 
both new and geo-adapted events, is focused on 
enhancing the performance of our ‘live media’ 
business both around the quality of our product 
offering and the resulting customer experience. 
Underlying growth in the Events business was 
14.6% and this reflects the growing strength of our 
core franchises. 2011 also saw the acquisition of eight 
events-related businesses for £71.2m. The most 
notable acquisition was Ecobuild, the world’ s leading 
sustainable building exhibition and the fastest 
growing trade event in the UK for an initial cash 
consideration of £31m and a performance based 
consideration of up to £20m. Ecobuild fits well with 
the existing UBM Built Environment portfolio with 
strong potential for multiple geo-adaptations. A first 
edition has now been launched for China in 2012. 
Ecobuild will run in March 2012 and is on track with 
our acquisition case. Other acquisitions in the Events 
space during the year have helped to consolidate our 
drive to leverage markets and communities exhibiting 
long-term structural growth characteristics.
Biennial events in 2011 have delivered £36.2m in 
revenues compared to £18.5m in 2010. Comparing 
our 2011 biennial events (including Marintec and 
FIE) to the same portfolio’ s performance in 2009, 
revenue for these shows has grown by 27%. Section 1: 2011 Review „

PR Newswire revenues increased by 3.6% during 
2011 to £187.8m (2010: £181.2m). Our US 
Distribution revenue increased 0.6% to £88.7m while 
US revenues other than distribution (comprised of 
Engagement, W orkflow/Data and Filing Services) 
decreased by 1.8% to £39.3m. 
PR Newswire’ s global operating margin was 
21.8% which, while down on the previous year’ s 
23.2%, was ahead of the target we had set of 20.8% 
and reflected a shift in mix as well as significant 
investments in our products, our technology, and 
in sales and marketing to drive continued growth 
in the changing competitive and technological 
environments. Expansion of our newer businesses in 
Europe, China and in other Emerging Markets affects 
PR Newswire’ s margin. Similarly, growth in Vintage 
printing and filing revenues also has a dilutive effect 
on margins. PR Newswire’ s non-US revenue 
increased to 31.8% of total global revenues from 
29.3% in 2010 and this represented a 12.6% growth 
over the year. 
Overall Data Services revenues of £187.0m 
(2010: £184.7m) were robust in 2011. Operating 
margins achieved were 16.2% (2010: 18.5%), in line 
with guidance provided to the market. Softness in 
the margin was partially driven by the anticipated 
ongoing decline in higher margin print directory 
advertising together with the continuing focused 
investment in developing online and workflow 
products. Continued weakness in T rade & T ransport 
was somewhat offset by strong advances elsewhere, 
most notably in T echnology & IP but also in Health 
and Pulp & Paper. 
Importantly the structural migration from print 
data to digital formats continues to be a prominent 
feature of the revenue mix, with online data and 
services this year accounting for 69.5% of Data 
Services’ revenues (2010: 66.7%). 
In 2011, as with the previous year, the Online 
segment was one of our fastest growing segments, 
up by 27.9% to £88.5m (2010: £69.2m), driven 
primarily by strong banner advertising and continued 
traction in the roll out of our attractive new online 
communities and digital environments. 2011 has 
been another exceptionally strong year for Digital 
Environments with the successful delivery of over 250 
(2010: 103) discrete events across the globe. 
Digital Environments continue to expand from the 
initial virtual events that delivered online trade shows 
to delivering digital experiences across multiple 
environments and communities including 
recruitment and in-company communication. 
W e continue to see digital environments as symbiotic 
to our live, in person events business.
Print revenues fell 22.2% during the year in line 
with previous guidance to the market. As a segment, 
Print now accounts for 11.6% (2010: 16.2%) of total 
Group revenues, reflecting the success of our strategy 
to rationalise our print business. Disposals during the 
year included the French healthcare newspaper 
‘Quotidien du Medecin’ and its related weekly 
and monthly titles as well as the UK ‘Publican’ , 
and two US healthcare journals. As a result of the 
rationalisation process, segmental margins now stand 
at 5.4% (2010: 6.9%). Subsequent to the year end we 
made further disposals, notably of Farmers’ Guardian 
and Pulse. Decreases in print-related operating profit 
are now being made up by increases in operating 
profit derived from digital subscriptions.
UBM has gone through tremendous change 
in the past five years – in its business mix, the 
geographies in which it does business and also in 
developing an increasingly distinctive and open 
culture. I would like to state my personal thanks to 
our Chairman John Botts, who will stand down later 
in the year, for his advice and support to me over the 
past five years while we have gone through all of these 
developments. UBM has benefitted hugely from his 
infectious energy, his deep understanding of the 
business and his huge passion for its people and 
I personally have benefitted from his counsel.

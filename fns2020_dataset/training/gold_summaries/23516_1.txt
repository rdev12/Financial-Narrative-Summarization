 Entu (UK) plc Annual Report 2014 04
Overview
This has been a significant year of development for the 
Group, culminating in our admission to AIM in October 
2014. We have strengthened our leading positions in our 
target markets across the UK, buoyed by our strong brand 
reputation, our national coverage, and by steadily 
improving consumer demand. 
Our primary strategy is to focus on driving organic growth 
from our diversified, fully integrated product portfolio, and 
also, over time, through the development of new product and 
service offerings, in particular, energy efficiency products and 
services, whilst continuing to strive for the highest levels of 
customer satisfaction across all the product range. 
CHIEF Ex ECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT
IAN P BLACKHURST 
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER
This growth will be enhanced by leveraging the  
unified, nation-wide Entu brand to drive cross-selling 
opportunities, as well as a greater proportion of sales 
through our website. 
As a Group we have benefitted over the years from 
acquisitions and, to complement our organic growth, we 
are always exploring the potential to enhance our product 
offering through carefully targeted acquisitions which 
meet strict value enhancing criteria.
Results and Operational Review
For the year ended 31 October 2014, profit before tax 
increased to £9.0m (2013: £6.1m) on revenues of £119.0m 
(2013: £95.5m), giving adjusted earnings per share of 
12.3p (2013: 7.8p). Net cash at year end was  
£5.8m (2013: (1.8m)). 
Home improvement products
Our home improvement products – doors, windows, 
conservatories and roofline – are sold through separate 
brands which are market leaders in their regions. The 
division has performed robustly as we have built on our 
market share, and as consumer confidence has increased 
and homeowners have decided to make replacements or 
improvements to their homes. In the year to 31 October 
2014, the division reported sales of £84.3m (2013: £71.2m), 
representing 71.0% of Group sales (2013: 74.6%).  
Net margin for the division was 4.5% (2013: 5.0%).
During the year, the Home Improvement Products 
segment was strengthened through the acquisition  
of the Europlas brand in December 2013.
Energy generation and energy saving products
Products sold include solar photovoltaic installations, air 
to air heat pumps, voltage regulators, remote heating 
controls and boilers. For the year ended 31 October 2014, 
sales were £23.9m (2013: £20.8m), representing 20.0% of 
Group sales (2013: 21.8%). This is a segment in which we 
see significant opportunities for growth with the 
increasing adoption of energy efficient products and 
technologies, as I outline further below.
Insulation products
Demand for this relatively new product segment  
is driven by a growing recognition of the financial and 
environmental benefits of home insulation. Products in 
this segment include cavity wall insulation, external wall 
insulation and loft insulation. Sales in the year were  
£8.4m (2013: £1.2m) or 7.0% of Group sales (2013: 1.3%).  Strategic report

Repairs and Renewals Service Agreement  
(“RRSA”) Programme 
Our RRSA programme is an annual warranty plan  
offered to customers on the vast majority of our products. 
It represented £2.4m of Group sales during the year  
(2013: £2.2m), 2.0% of Group sales (2013: 2.3%). This  
gave the segment a gross margin of 78.7% in 2014  
(2013: 82.5%), and at year end around 60% of our 
customers were members of the programme (2013: 60%).
National installation
Our national installation service, Job Worth Doing (“JWD”), 
has comprehensive nationwide coverage, with 80% of the 
population living within one hour’s drive of a JWD centre.  
It therefore unites all our brands and products, and 
facilitates cross-selling and in the roll-out of new products 
and services.
The opportunity in energy efficiency
UK homes are becoming increasingly energy efficient. 
Households are now using around 20% less energy  
than they were in 2004 (Source: Delivering UK Energy 
Investment July 2014, www.gov.uk) and the growing 
recognition, from Government to household level, of the 
long term economic advantages of energy efficiency is 
continuing to drive adoption. For example, in the UK there 
are 24 million homes which would be suitable for loft 
insulation, 19 million suitable for cavity wall insulation and 
27 million suitable for high efficiency boilers (Source: 
Delivering UK Energy Investment July 2014, www.gov.uk). 
 
This is a major growth opportunity for Entu, and one of 
which we are well positioned to take advantage. 
There is a gap in the market for a supplier which offers 
expert advice and guidance about energy efficiency, as 
well as practical installation services, to the consumer. 
With our unique offering, we are well placed to establish  
a market leading presence in the home efficiency market, 
as part of our integrated portfolio of services. Entu already 
has an established foothold in this market through our 
energy efficiency brands Energy Hypermarket, Staybrite 
Solar and Zest, and we are actively looking to grow this.
Our aim now is to build by leveraging our knowledge of 
our customers’ requirements from our 1 million strong 
Group database, engaging with our customers and 
showing them how they can realise tangible benefits from 
adopting energy saving products, and then offering 
affordable solutions tailored to them. 
We are currently at an early stage of developing a 
technology that will allow our customers to monitor their 
energy usage online on a daily, weekly and monthly basis 
to understand where they are consuming most energy 
and how energy efficient products can save them money. 
From this we can offer energy assessments and bespoke 
energy efficient solutions. 
We are also actively seeking to grow our existing product 
line, especially in energy efficient boilers and in solar 
photovoltaic installations, and to capitalise on emerging 
trends by entering into partnership agreements with other 
players in the sector, for example, in the “smart energy 
control” solutions. We look forward to providing updates 
on our progress in these initiatives in due course. 
Financial Review
During the year, total Group revenues increased 24.6%, to 
£119m, compared to the prior year (2013: £95.5m), which 
was primarily driven by significant revenue increases in 
our Home Improvements and Insulation business 
segments. Within our Home Improvement segment, 
revenues increased to £84.3m compared to £71.2m  
in 2013, and within the Insulation segment revenues 
increased to £8.4m from £1.2m in 2013.
Profit before taxation and exceptional items during 2014 
was £10.3m, a 69.5% increase from £6.1m in 2013. During 
the year, the Group saw a significant increase in profit 
before tax and exceptional items generated by its Energy 
Generation and Saving Segment from £0.2m in 2013 to 
£1.8m in 2014. 
In 2014, the Group incurred exceptional costs of £1.32m, 
which related to costs associated with the listing on AIM. 
Post exceptional items, the Group achieved profit before 
tax of £9.0m in 2014, compared to £6.1m in 2013, a 47.9% 
increase. Within this growth in profits, the Group also 
witnessed a significant shift in its profitability splits  
in 2014 compared to previous years, with a more equal 
distribution of profits among the different business 
segments, giving our earnings greater resilience.
During the year, the Group also successfully negotiated an 
increased credit facility with Barclays Bank, which will give 
the Group additional capacity for further acquisitions  
and developments.
At 31 October 2014, the Group had cash and cash 
equivalents of £5.8m compared to a £1.8m overdraft  
at 31 October 2013. Entu (UK) plc Annual Report 2014 06

OUR STRATEGY AND PROGRESS
OUR BUSINESSES
While the roll-out of LTE 4G commercial 
networks continues – and far outstrips  
the rate at which previous 3G technology  
was taken up – the speed of adoption is 
inﬂuenced by a number of factors: spectrum 
allocation from governments; legacy 
technology on networks; and economic 
pressures that constrain the investment 
necessary to upgrade the infrastructure. 
LTE 4G roll-out has begun in North America,  
Asia Paciﬁc and in some countries in 
mainland Europe. While we do not expect  
LTE 4G to be implemented in the UK until 
2013/14, this slow roll-out will not affect  
our business since our customers are based 
all over the world, from the US to China. 
Indeed, 97% of our Wireless revenue last  
year came from outside the UK.
Despite the growth in LTE 4G there are, 
however, still relatively few LTE 4G 
subscribers worldwide; the majority of the six 
billion mobile phone subscriptions are still 2G 
(GSM). Only 15% (890 million) are 3G 
(WCDMA) devices and, at the time of writing, 
only just over 17 million are LTE 4G, the 
majority of which are in North America3. 
While production of the now-dominant 2G 
phones will slow down, shipments of 3G and 
4G devices will continue to increase.
In time, we expect manufacturers to 
rationalise the number of different models 
they produce. Advances in technology will, 
however, always result in new models and 
devices that are more complex to design and 
produce and that need more tools to test 
them effectively, and bring them to market 
quickly. Despite the efﬁciency of the new 
testing systems, we estimate that a typical 
LTE 4G device requires 20-25% more testing 
than a 3G one; each new technology has to be 1 Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Trafﬁc

MARKET TRENDS
The mobile telecommunications market 
continues its relentless growth; people 
throughout the world are moving from 
desktop computers to mobile devices – 
smartphones and tablets – to send emails, 
access the internet, shop, transfer money, 
control other devices and watch videos, and 
constantly expect those devices to do more, 
and more quickly.
As a result, the volume of data trafﬁc 
generated by mobile devices is increasing 
dramatically; it has grown 33-fold in the past 
ﬁve years and is projected to grow a further 
18-fold in the next ﬁve. In particular, changes 
in content-viewing habits have resulted in a 
surge in video trafﬁc – currently 50% of mobile 
data trafﬁc; it is expected to be 70% by 2016¹.
The number of handsets sold around the 
world is forecast to reach 3 billion a year  
by 2020 – up from 1.7 billion today. It is also 
forecast that smartphones will continue to 
replace feature phones: by 2020 the number 
of smartphone units sold each year is 
expected to reach 2.5 billion – up from 
0.4 billion in 2011².
LTE 4G – a new, more efﬁcient technology – 
is not only expected to alleviate the network 
overload caused by this increase in mobile 
data trafﬁc, but also to meet network 
operators’ constant need to reduce costs and 
improve the quality of experience for their 
customers; 327 operators, in 99 countries, 
are currently investing in LTE 4G, and at least 
144 LTE 4G networks are expected to be in 
commercial service in 59 countries over 
the next few years³.

OUR STRATEGY AND PROGRESS
us to maintain our leadership and will deliver 
further growth in revenue and proﬁt as the 
market continues to develop.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH
We will offer an increasing range of products 
to enable our wireless customers, worldwide, 
to exploit changes in technology. In Handset 
Testing, this includes maintaining our 
market-leading CT capability, increasing  
our IOT offer as we expand the number of 
new operator eco-systems worldwide, and 
ensuring that our Development Testing (DT) 
solutions continue to anticipate and meet  
the demands of end-customers and industry 
bodies. We will develop into adjacent 
markets, as appropriate, to meet our major 
customers’ demands.
In Network Testing, we augmented our 
testing tools when we launched 
benchmarking and scanner products, with  
the objective of establishing them as 
market-leading products. While there will not 
be a signiﬁcant volume of LTE 4G business for 
Network Testing until commercial networks 
are rolled out, we are in the enviable position 
of having the most comprehensive LTE 4G 
product portfolio on the market. We have 
already sold LTE 4G equipment to network 
equipment manufacturers and operators  
in North America and mainland Europe,  
and expect to make progress in this area  
in the coming year. 
We continue to support products that 
address legacy technologies, the demand 
for which has proved to be more sustained 
than expected. Our current focus is,  
however, principally on LTE 4G, although  
we are already planning for the next 
generation, LTE-Advanced. 
compatible with legacy technology, and work 
on different frequencies around the world. The 
industry is only now entering the mandatory 
testing phase for LTE 4G devices and, to date, 
only 19 LTE 4G devices have been certiﬁed 
this year whereas 300 to 400 2G/3G devices 
were certiﬁed in each of the past three years4.
This phase will require each manufacturer to 
signiﬁcantly increase its testing capacity as 
network roll-outs accelerate.
Nor is the industry standing still: it is 
anticipating future demands that will result 
in more testing opportunities. LTE-Advanced 
(LTE-A) – the next stage in LTE’s evolution 
– delivers even faster data rates. It will 
provide super-fast wireless broadband, 
delivered in gigabytes rather than megabytes. 
The industry is currently building consensus 
on the capability and features of LTE-A and 
deployment is expected to begin during 2013.
STRATEGY
Our strategy in both Wireless businesses is  
to position Anite as a global leader in wireless 
test solutions by focusing on the areas in 
which we specialise. We will continue to 
invest in early R&D, to keep our highly 
specialised products at the leading edge and 
to have the latest technology available for 
our customers as soon as they need it. In 
addition, we will look to expand our testing 
capabilities into adjacent markets, as we have 
already achieved with IOT, benchmarking and 
scanners. In meeting customers’ and market 
demands, our primary focus will be on 
internally developed products, but we may 
supplement these with carefully selected 
small acquisitions, as appropriate. 
We believe this commitment to our 
customers, and to the market, will enable

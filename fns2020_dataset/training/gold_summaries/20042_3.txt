 GoldBridges Global Resources Plc  Annual Report 2014 02
Chairman’s statement 
//Strategic report
During 2014, the Company took significant steps in its ambitious plans  
to become a large scale gold producer.
I am pleased to report that the plans for the future 
development of the mine in Sekisovskoye are now 
well developed with significant milestones achieved in 
2014 including the publication of a Competent Persons 
Report (CPR) with updated reserves and resources in 
November. This was followed by the Company’s shares 
being admitted to dealing on the standard segment of 
the London Stock Exchange in December, increasing the 
profile and attractiveness of the Company to investors, 
both current and future, as well as increasing the profile 
and reputation of the Company in Kazakhstan.
The CPR was seen as a key component forming the basis 
of building investor confidence and underpinning any 
future funding requirements that the Company is seeking 
in order to fulfil its development plans. At present, the 
underground production is being carried out in addition 
to open-pit mining, although it has now been decided 
that it makes economic sense to phase out the open-pit 
mining during Q3 2015. At this point, all production 
will be from the underground mine, with feed to the 
processing plant being complemented by the use of 
existing ore stock piles. The detailed development plans 
and funding options are currently being finalised which 
will lead to an increase in the production capacity of the 
underground workings. During the year, a significant part 
of the funding raised from the placings undertaken in 
January and February 2014 which raised cash resources  
of US$22.7m was used to enhance and develop the 
current underground operations. Further funding of 
US$5.0m was raised in April 2015 to provide interim 
funding for working capital and to progress the 
development of the underground mine.
Gold poured for the year increased from last year by  
7.5% to 32,994oz (2013: 30,669oz) with an increasing 
amount being delivered from the underground 
operations. During the year the increased level of activity 
was slowed by the flow of work during the processing 
plant improvements as well as by future developmental 
work. Our 2014 gold sales amounted to 27,959oz  
(2013: 29,712oz), a decrease of 1,753oz. However, there 
was an increase in the inventories of finished goods 
which increased by 5,283oz to 7,307oz at the year-end. 
The significant difference from the prior year has been  
in the price of gold, with an average market price of gold 
in 2014 of US$1,198/oz, compared to an average market 
price in 2013 of US$1,418, a 15% reduction. This has had 
an inevitable impact on profitability, particularly in the 
second half of the year with the gold price finishing at 
US$1,183/oz. The actual average price the Company 
achieved (including the silver as a by-product) was 
US$1,258/oz (2013: US$1,427). The current consensus  
is that gold will trade at an average between US$1,200 
and US$1,235/oz throughout 2015.
Given the economic model currently being developed 
by the Company, we feel that the Company has sufficient 
headroom in profitability to cope with any further 
downward pressure on gold prices.
As reported last year , the Company acquired the  
geological data in relation to the Karasuyskoye Ore  
Fields, located adjacent to the current operations at 
Sekisovskoye. The Company successfully obtained  
the necessary permits to exploit the site and conduct 
further testing to validate the initial resource estimates. 
The Company is expecting to conclude testing and 
obtain the subsoil user licence for the area in 12-18 
months following the completion of further testing.
I am also pleased to report that the final material legacy 
issue was resolved in 2014, resulting in the Company 
receiving US$2.27m, being the total amount claimed  
(which includes interest and costs) . This amount related 
to the settlement of an outstanding claim made against 
Akmola Gold LLP for the return of funds invested by the 
previous management in the project.
2015 will be a year of transition and development for  
the Company with the Sekisovskoye operation starting 
on the road to achieving its full potential and the 
development of the Karasuyskoye project providing 
a future stepping stone for greater growth in the 
Company’s fortunes.
Finally, may I thank all our employees and our 
Management team for their hard work and also  
thank our shareholders for their continued support.

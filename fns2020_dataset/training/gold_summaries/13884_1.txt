Sceptre Leisure plc 09
Annual report and accounts 2009
It gives me great pleasure to present my
first annual review for Sceptre Leisure plc.
Since our interim report earlier this year
the Group has continued to grow its
business in the licensed trade whilst
maintaining improvements in our machine
revenue and utilisation averages. 
The businesses acquired in the reverse
takeover earlier this year have now been
fully integrated, and we are beginning to
see the benefits of being able to offer our
full range to a wider customer base.
The drive for growth continues into the
new financial year; our successful placing
of £5.5m in new shares on AIM in June
2009 will provide the financial resources
needed to increase penetration in all of
our target markets.
Performance overview
The results for the 12 months to the end 
of April 2009 showed turnover up 83% 
to £39.2m, with a similar rise in both 
gross profit and operating profit before
exceptionals. Net cash from operating
activities also increased to £12.8m from
£9.4m in the prior year . 
The Group’s performance continued to
build on the strong start reported in 
our interim statement; all of the above
measures improved in the second six
months of the year .
We continue to work hard at maximising
the revenue achieved from our assets,
with our machine utilisation ratio (the
percentage of our total machine estate 
on active hire) continuing to hold at our
target rate of 95%. This, coupled to the
growth of our average weekly rental
income per machine over the period
under review, has allowed us to increase
profitability despite the challenging
environment in which we operate.
The Group won significant new business
with high-quality customers during the
year , allowing us to increase both machine
numbers and average income levels in the
face of continued pub closures. Again, this
momentum has continued into the new
financial year with further contract
awards being won by Sceptre Leisure
Solutions in the first quarter .
Our three main trading divisions are now
fully established within the Group, and
continue to work towards our strategic
objectives in a co-ordinated manner . 
I would like to take this opportunity to
summarise the main achievements in 
the year under review.
Sceptre Leisure Solutions
The Directors believe that Sceptre
remains the second-largest operator of
amusement and gaming machines in the
UK’s licensed retail sector , and the only
national operator with fully staffed depots
across the country. During the year we
opened a new depot in Cardiff, allowing us
to offer an average two-hour service
response time across the UK.
During the year , the number of machines
operated grew by 19% to 18,000, with
average weekly rental also increasing
23% during the period. Whilst pub
closures continue to affect the lower end
of the market, our experience is that at
the top end our customers will continue to
do well where their offering includes our
market-leading machine portfolio to help
them achieve their financial targets. 
We have continued to grow both the
quantity and quality of our machine estate
whilst many of our competitors have 
failed to do so.
The Group won signiﬁcant
new business with high-
quality customers during the
year , allowing us to increase
both machine numbers and
average income levels.

Customer Service T eam
Our unrivalled commitment to
customer service has been
reinforced with the addition of a 
new state-of-the-art call centre
located at our head office. This has
led not only to enhanced service for
our customers, but also generates
technical data and operational
statistics for our internal 
KPI measurements.

Annual report and accounts 2009
Sceptre Gaming (the fixed odds betting
terminal (FOBT) sub-division of Sceptre
Leisure Solutions) signed a new
partnership with Videobet, a subsidiary
of the Playtech group, in November 2008.
The partnership gave Sceptre Gaming
exclusive supply of Videobet’s multi-
game software in the UK, including
revolutionary games and industry-first
loyalty features, and will strengthen
Sceptre Gaming’s position in the UK
FOBT market.
Sceptre Gaming experienced strong
growth with FOBT machines in licensed
betting offices over the year and will
continue to roll-out the product across
the UK. This partnership with Videobet
highlights Sceptre Gaming’s strong
position in the UK FOBT market and
commitment to supplying our customers
with the highest quality product available.
We aim to achieve a significant share of
the estimated 40,000-piece FOBT market
in the UK which has traditionally been
dominated by two machine and software
suppliers. Our FOBT s are currently
undergoing trials in a number of national
and regional licensed betting office
operators’ premises, and both players
and operators have received the product
extremely well.
The Videobet platform offers unique
player tracking and customer loyalty
functionality, which can be utilised by our
LBO customers to increase revenues and
introduce cross-platform marketing.
Videobet’s software is not confined to the
FOBT market, and can easily be adapted
for digital category C AWP (Amusement
With Prizes) machines for use in pubs and
clubs. Sceptre has traditionally operated
analogue AWPs in all of its markets, but
this partnership will allow us to supply
a digital offering for our customers
which will complement our existing
product range.
We continue to concentrate on Sceptre
Leisure’s operating ratios, and particularly
that between the numbers of machines
operated to staff employed. This ratio is
analysed monthly, and during the course
of the year we continually rebalanced
our staffing levels between the depots
according to need. This ensures that not
only are we employing the right number
of people across the business, but that
they are employed in the correct part of
the country.

Annual report and accounts 2009
Lotteryking
Following the reverse takeover in
September 2008, we rebranded and
relaunched Lotteryking within the club
market in which it operates around 3,000
instant-win lottery machines. We have 
also introduced a number of new lottery
games, some offering a higher level of
payout to increase player involvement,
and others being based on well-known
club fruit machines. Initial sales figures 
of these new games are encouraging, 
and they are a valuable aid to gaining 
new lottery sites.
In addition to this traditional product base,
Lotteryking now offers the Group’s full
range of coin-operated gaming and
amusement machines to the registered
club market through a strengthened 
sales team. These efforts should result in
increased density and operational benefits
as we begin to win market share in the
new product groups.
In my interim review, I announced a 
new trial of around 100 regional brewer-
operated sites in the North-West into
which we would be installing lottery
vending terminals. The trial involved 
an estate-wide roll-out, with the lotteries
being sold supporting a single charity
nominated by the pub operator . 
The model has proved popular with
players, sites and charity alike, and we will
extend the trial to a further 200 locations
in different regions during the course of
the new financial year .
Kelly’s Eye
Following an extensive rebranding
exercise, Kelly’s Eye was launched online
in the first quarter of 2009. As well as
generating sales, the website has proven 
a valuable tool to communicate the full
range of available products to our Group
customers in other divisions, and Kelly’s
Eye products are now being distributed
through both Sceptre and Lotteryking
sales channels.
The Kelly’s Eye product line has expanded
to include newly popular indoor games
such as poker whilst retaining perennial
favourites such as bingo and darts. 
These activities offer pub operators the
opportunity to attract and retain a client
base both through themed evenings and
team-based competitions, and Sceptre is
well-placed to capitalise on the growth of
this market in pubs across the UK.
Support division
The support and technical functions 
of the Group are now fully integrated.
Machine service, installation, collection,
warehousing and distribution were all fully
consolidated two months after the reverse
takeover . Administrative, Finance and ICT
functions were also centralised at our
Preston head office within six months of
the transaction date. As I have stated
before, however , the value to be derived
from the expanded group will come 
from revenue enhancement rather than
cost reduction.
The consolidation of warehouse and
production into our Preston head office
resulted in the closure of premises
previously operated in the North-East 
and Cardiff, and we successfully sublet 
or terminated the leases on these two
locations in Spring 2009, reducing our
cost base in these areas.
The Group’s new customer service centre
opened at our head office in Spring 2009,
allowing our technical team to view and
manage service calls in real time across all
of our depots. Each service call, which is
communicated electronically to our team
of 90 field-based engineers, is tracked 
and monitored to ensure that our target
response times are met. This continued
investment underlines our commitment to
customer service, and will allow us to keep
Sceptre’s response times to a minimum,
ensuring that our assets are earning
money for our customers more of 
the time.

Sceptre Leisure plc grew strongly during
the year under review, increasing market
share by attracting high-quality customers
from our competitors. We aim to continue
that organic growth during 2009–10, and
have made a positive start to the year
with further contract awards from
Whitbread Leisure for approximately 
50% of their nationwide business, and
also from regional pub operator Larder
Leisure in the North-East of England.
These new machines will be installed
during the second quarter of the current
financial year .
Our FOBT operation continues to expand
with a new sole-supply agreement for
Scotbet from 1 September , to whom we
were previously contracted for 50% of
their terminals. Our continued trials with
Coral have also now moved into a more
advanced six-month extension period.
We have increased the number of pub and
club lottery terminals since April, with a
5% uplift in numbers across the country
in the last five months.
In summary, in the first few months of the
current year trading levels have continued
the established trend of year-on-year
growth, and we remain in line with our
performance expectations.
We will also look to grow through
acquisition if suitable targets can be found
that complement our existing business.
Our recent share placing for £5.5m gives
us the ability to follow this dual strategy 
of organic and acquisitive growth.
The increases in stakes and prizes in June
2009 provided a welcome boost to the
AWP market, and Sceptre has benefited
from increased rentals on the new and
converted machines. Our customers are
also now seeing benefit from the roll-out 
of machines offering increased stake and
prizes through increased machine takings.
Our partnership with Videobet and
Playtech gives us exclusive access to
market-leading technology, and we will
work with them to develop our digital
offering in the coming months.
We will also continue to increase revenue
through the cross-selling of our full
product portfolio into our Group-wide
customer base of over 10,000 locations.
As we have demonstrated over the past
year our business continues to improve
operating margins and grow despite 
the general economic conditions and
continued pub closures. We are confident
that we can not only maintain, but build
on, our strong performance last year in
the coming 12 months.

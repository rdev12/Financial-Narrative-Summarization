 Essar Energy plc Annual report + accounts 2010
02
W 
elcome to Essar Energy’s  
first annual report as a publicly 
listed company. Despite listing in 
volatile market conditions against 
a backdrop of a challenging global 
economic and financial environment, 
we are pleased to report that your 
Company has performed well. At 
the end of 2010 our share price had 
risen 38.1% from the listing price of 
420 pence, compared with a rise of 
6.2% for the FTSE 100 over the same 
period – a creditable performance.
The global economic outlook is 
improving even though the recovery in 
the developed world remains fragile. 
India however, continues to stand apart, 
along with other emerging economies, 
and deliver solid growth due to its 
high domestic consumption demand. 
As demand in India grows, so will its 
energy needs and we are creating 
energy assets that are critical to the 
economic development of India. We 
believe that the fundamentals driving 
Indian growth are robust and as a result, 
it is clear that the long term outlook 
for Essar Energy remains strong. 
Government projections indicate that 
the Indian economy is set to grow at 
over 8% this financial year. All policies 
of the Government rest on the premise 
that the domestic economy will see a 
high demand for goods and services 
as India modernises and industrialises 
further. While there is some concern 
regarding inflation, the Indian Chief 
Economic Advisor recently made a 
statement that food inflation will come 
down to 7% from the present 10%. 
Most macroeconomic analysts continue 
to believe the India growth story is 
intact and the only possible threat is an 
uncontrolled increase in global oil prices.
strategy
Our strategy is clear; to create a 
world-class, low-cost, integrated 
energy company focused on India 
and positioned to capitalise on India’s 
rapidly growing energy demand. While 
the focus is on India, Essar Energy will 
also pursue opportunities overseas 
which support our strategy and deliver 
value to our shareholders. To deliver 
our strategy we will; optimise the 
performance of all our existing assets; 
deliver growth through a variety of 
green-field and brown-field power and 
oil and gas projects; leverage our skills 
and Indian asset base to identify further 
growth opportunities; and, act as a 
good corporate citizen with respect to 
the health and safety of our employees, 
the communities in which we operate, 
and the environment. The delivery 
against this strategy will provide a more 
predictable business performance 
over time which in turn, underpins the 
creation of value for our shareholders, 
customers, employees and, importantly, 
the communities around our operations. 
We are happy to inform you that during 
the year, your Chief Executive, Naresh 
Nayyar, and his team have successfully 
focused on delivering in line with 
the above stated strategy. This has 
resulted in a strong production and cost 
performance as well as progress on our 
significant pipeline of growth projects.
We are also happy to share that as 
a part of seeking opportunities in 
c hairman and vice c hairman’s statement
“We are creating 
energy assets 
that are critical 
to the economic 
development 
of India.”

overseas markets, we announced an 
exclusivity agreement with Shell UK 
Limited in February 2011 in relation to 
an offer for the proposed purchase of 
the oil refinery and other associated 
assets at Stanlow, near Ellesmere Port, 
Cheshire, for a cash consideration of 
US$350 million. The acquisition of the 
high complexity Stanlow refinery, which 
is the second largest refinery in the UK, 
will give Essar Energy direct access 
to the UK market, is aligned with the 
Company’s strategy to provide options 
for the export of refined products 
from the Vadinar refinery in India, and 
is being acquired at a competitive 
price when compared to other recent 
comparable refinery transactions. 
The acquisition will be conditional on, 
amongst other items, the approval 
of Essar Energy’s shareholders at a 
general meeting and is expected to be 
completed in the second half of 2011. 
While we continue to deliver well against 
our plans, we are seeing some delays 
in certain regulatory approvals that 
could impact the financial and operating 
performance of the Company. However, 
timely receipt of approvals is a key risk 
for all companies operating in India, 
and other developing economies. 
More details on some of these items 
are given in the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties section of this report. 
While the health and safety 
performance at our operational plants 
was satisfactory, our overall progress 
in this critical area can be further 
improved. 2010 was declared as the 
Year of Safety and during this period 
the Vadinar refinery achieved more 
than 1,000 days and over 18 million 
man hours without a lost time incident. 
While the Board is pleased with these 
results at our operating plants, our 
progress in the area of health and 
safety, in particular, remains a focus at 
both our construction and operating 
sites, and we remain committed to 
improving our performance in this area.

creating world class assets, but our

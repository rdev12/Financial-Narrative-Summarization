Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.com
The Group is now in a strong financial and 
operational position, which will enable 
MOG to actively seek strategic growth 
opportunities while progressing its portfolio 
of production, development and 
exploration assets.
Looking back, 2011 was a difficult year due 
to unexpected regulatory developments 
affecting Ombrina Mare, which is a key 
asset for the Company, and the uncertain 
economic environment. However, the 
Group retained a clear focus on securing 
value from its operational structure and its 
extensive and diverse asset base; and it is 
now reaping the benefits, following the 
Group recapitalisation and the significant 
increase of gas production. 
The Company has a broad asset base 
across the exploration, development and 
production phases of the business. These 
assets have significant upside potential 
and we now have the financial strength to 
de-risk and mature these assets over the 
coming years, while also looking for 
valuable opportunities for asset acquisition.
William Higgs
Chief Executive
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc (‘MOG’ or the 
‘Company’) is pleased to announce its 
results for 2011.
The year 2011 has seen transformational 
developments on the financial and 
operational fronts. 
The Group recapitalisation completed in 
May left MOG free of financial debt with  
a cash and cash equivalent position of 
€17 .5m at 30 June and €3.7m at 
31 December 2011. This was a positive step 
in enabling the Company to embark on its 
growth objectives by funding first gas at 
Guendalina while remaining debt free. 
The development of the Guendalina gas 
field (20% MOG W.I.) has been completed 
successfully and gas production started on 
25 October 2011, providing the Company 
with a sound revenue base going forward.

Gas Production and Prices
All gas production of the Group currently 
occurs in Italy.
In 2011, gas production was approximately 
17 .6 MMscm (0.62 Bcf), which represented a 
44% increase relative to the prior year. This 
was largely due to the commencement of 
gas production at the Guendalina gas field 
in late October 2011. 
During 2011, the Brent oil price has been 
relatively constant at around $110/bbl,  
while the Euro vs US Dollar exchange rate 
has experienced significant fluctuations 
which have strongly influenced the gas 
price received by the Group under its gas 
sales contracts. The average gas sales 
price achieved during the period was 
€0.32/scm ($12.7 per thousand cubic feet); 
higher than in 2010, when the average gas 
sales price was €0.28/scm ($10.7 per 
thousand cubic feet). 
The Company’s forecasts for future gas 
prices indicate that this positive trend is 
expected to continue in 2012. 
The gas offtake contracts currently in 
force are:
• Repower Italia SpA, covering the Group’s 
entire Guendalina net gas production 
offtake (which represents about 75% of 
the Group’s current gas production)
• Gas Plus Italia SpA, covering the largest 
part of the Group’s onshore gas 
production offtake
• Rimini Gas Spa, covering production 
offtake from the Misano Adriatico 
concession
• Eni SpA, covering production offtake 
from the San Andrea concession 
• Seicogen SpA, covering production 
offtake from the Masseria Vincelli field 
inside the Torrente Cigno concession

Asset Overview
Italy – Onshore gas
In Italy, the Company has a large number 
of onshore production and exploration gas 
assets. In this E&P acreage the existing 
production is not the only value. In fact, 
several interesting development and 
exploration projects are also present, 
mainly within existing production 
concessions that have the potential to 
unlock approximately 12 to 14 Bcf net 
unrisked prospective resources to the 
Group and achieve new near to mid-term 
gas production. 
During the period:
• a review of residual onshore gas 
exploration potential has been 
undertaken. In the first half of 2012, 
management will complete the ranking 
of the prospects with the goal of drilling 
wells over the next three years to 
regenerate reserves and production 
from this element of the portfolio
Oil & Gas Reserves and Resources 
The Group’s reserves and resources  
are reviewed on an annual basis by 
independent certifiers (Proven, Probable and 
Possible Reserves) and/or by the Company 
(Contingent and Prospective Resources). 
The following tables summarise the 
evolution of the Group’s hydrocarbon 
reserves and resources since 2006 and 
includes the latest update, as at 
31 December 2011.
At the end of 2011:
• 2P Oil Reserves & Resources remained 
substantially unchanged 
• the ‘2P RRR’ (Reserves Replacement 
Ratio) for the gas is around 105%, which 
means that the Company has 
successfully replaced all production 
from 2011 in the reserves ledger
• the Company’s R/P ratio for gas is 14.7
• 2P Gas reserves increased due to the 
annual revision of the Group’s onshore 
gas fields reserves performed by SIM 
and the new independent certification of 
Guendalina Gas Reserves by RPS 
• Gas Prospective Resources also 
increased, on average 42%, as a result 
of the review of the gas exploration 
potential performed on the Italian and 
French E&P Assets

• some field revamping and new 
development projects have progressed, 
which will enable 2 to 3 Bcf net 2P 
reserves to be progressively placed on 
production within the next 12 to 24 
months
Italy – Offshore
The Company’s development efforts during 
the period under review were all focused 
on the Guendalina gas field offshore Italy in 
the northern Adriatic.
Guendalina Gas Field (MOG W.I. 20%,  
ENI W.I. 80% and Operator)
At Guendalina:
• the development activities included the 
installation of the production platform, 
drilling of two production wells, 
installation of all production 
infrastructure and start-up of gas 
production
• the drilling campaign confirmed the 
previously discovered gas-bearing sand 
levels and identified some minor new 
gas-bearing intervals 
The Company:
• entered a gas sales contract with the 
Italian Utility Elettrogas SpA to cover all 
the Company’s net gas produced from 
the field
• undertook an independent certification 
of the field gas reserves that post 
reporting date:
• revised 2P recoverable reserves of 
31.2 Bcf (6.2 Bcf net to MOG), 
representing an increase of 42% 
relative to the previous 
pre-development valuation of 22 Bcf 
(4.4 Bcf net to MOG)
• estimated P3 reserves of 40.3 Bcf (8.1 
Bcf net to MOG)
• provided an economic valuation of 
MOG’s 2P net reserves, in which the 
NPV, using a 10% discount rate, is 
€27 .2 million
The Guendalina gas field is located 47km 
offshore of the north-east coast of Italy, in 
42m of water. 
The field is performing in line with our 
pre-development forecasts, with an 
average gross production of 580,000 scm/
day for the 1st Quarter of 2012 (MOG 116,000 
scm/day). 
The Guendalina project represents a ‘game 
changer’ milestone for the development  
of the Company. It significantly increases 
the Company’s net production up to the 
equivalent of about 950 boe/day and 
provides revenues for at least the next  
4-5 years, with further potential upside  
to follow.
Other North Adriatic Gas Discoveries 
(MOG W.I. 15%)
The Guendalina project is inside one of the 
most important gas exploration and 
production areas in Italy and is situated 
70km to the south of four other discovered, 
but still undeveloped, offshore gas fields in 
which the Group has a 15% interest (ENI, 
Operator). 
These four gas discoveries amount to 
between 19 to 48 Bcf net contingent gas 
resources to the Group and represent an 
important growth opportunity for the 
Company. Their reclassification from 2C 
(Contingent Resources) to 2P reserves is 
expected to take place following 
authorisation of the development plans for 
the fields. 
Development activity for these fields has 
been frozen since 2001, pending the 
resolution of environmental concerns about 
developing the offshore region. The Italian 
Government indicated in 2009 that it is in 
favour of a positive resolution of these 
issues in this area of the Northern Adriatic. 
A portion of the Company’s A.C 19.PI 
concession lies within 12 miles of nature 
reserves and therefore may, in part, be 
impacted by the 2010 offshore restrictions 
introduced by the Italian Government for 
the offshore E&P activities. As the majority 
of the fields lie outside the 12 mile 
boundary, the Company expects the 
operator, ENI, to review the status of the 
concessions and subsequently, to present 
a field development plan.
Ombrina Mare Oil & Gas Discovery  
(MOG W.I. 100%)
The Ombrina Mare discovery is an 
important asset for the Company that, 
despite the offshore restrictions introduced 
for offshore E&P activities by the Italian 
Government in 2010, represents an 
important future growth opportunity. 
Following the successful drilling of two 
exploration/appraisal wells in 2008, the 
completion of a well as an oil producer and 
the set-up of a tripod platform in preparation 
for the development phase, the Company 
applied for a production Concession (d 30 
B.C-MD) in December 2008.
On 23 June 2009, the FDP project received 
technical approval from the Italian Ministry 
of Economic Development (‘MED’). 
On 3 December 2009, the project was 
submitted to the Italian Ministry of the 
Environment (‘ME’) for issuance of the 
relevant Environmental Impact Assessment 
(‘EIA’). Issuance of the EIA by the ME is a 
precondition for the MED to grant the 
production Concession. The Company 
obtained in early 2010, an independent 
certification of 40 MMbbls 2P oil reserves, 
of which proven (P1) oil reserves were just 
over 12 MMbbls. These oil reserves 
establish the Ombrina Mare field as a 
significant European oil project. 
Since June 2010, following the issuance of 
Italian Legislative Decree no. 128/2010 (the 
‘Decree’) prohibiting E&P activities in certain 
sea and Italian coastal areas, there 
remains some uncertainty over the Group’s 
ability to progress the Ombrina Mare 
project. The Decree provides, among other 
things, that the limitation does not apply to 
titles that, as at the date it came into force, 
had already been granted (i.e. ‘enabling 
titles’). The Italian Government has yet to 
clarify whether the Company’s interest held 
at Ombrina Mare falls within the exemption 
of an enabling title. 
The Company is continuing its active 
dialogue with the Italian Government, with 
a view to securing positive clarification of 
the Group’s title and/or obtain appropriate 
modifications to the text of the Decree. In 
addition, the Company is also working with 
external legal counsel on the analysis and 
implementation of alternative courses of 
action as a contingency plan.
In February 2012, Law Decree 5/2012, 
regarding ‘simplifications and economic 
growth’ was published in the Official 
Journal of the Republic of Italy clarifying that 
the limitations provided by Decree 128 do 
not apply to either existing mining titles or 
‘relevant extensions’. This Decree was 
ratified in law on 6 April 2012 (Law 35/2012). 
Following this, we were pleased to receive 
a 3 year extension to our exploration 
permit BR269 GC, where the Ombrina Mare 
field is located, in May of this year and see 
this as a positive sign in our ongoing 
discussions with the Italian authorities 
regarding the issuance of a production 
concession for our proposed development 
of the Ombrina Mare field.  12
Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc Annual Report 2011 www.medoilgas.com
Chief Executive’s report continued
Since 2008, the Company has completed  
a detailed G&G assessment of the area, in 
order to de-risk the prospects and verify the 
presence of technically and commercially 
valuable exploration drilling opportunities. 
With this objective in mind, in late 2011 the 
Company acquired 1,012 sq km of high 
resolution long offset 3D seismic data on 
the most prospective sector of Area 4. The 
Company believes that this 3D data will  
be fundamental to completing the G&G 
assessment and de-risking the exploration 
potential. A comprehensive CPR has been 
commissioned. The results of this study, 
which are expected early in the 3rd Quarter 
of 2012, will underpin the Company’s 
strategy to seek a farm-in partner  
and progress the exploration of this 
interesting acreage.
France
The St. Laurent permit is located in southern 
France in a known gas and oil prone 
province. The Company has an 11% W.I. in 
this asset. In 2011, a detailed review of the 
gas play was completed in the permit area, 
which showed the presence of a number of 
high risk but high potential gas leads. The 
acquisition of 400km of infill 2D seismic has 
been planned for 2012 to supplement 
existing seismic data and complete a more 
proper definition of the leads and de-risk 
this exploration potential. The strategy for 
the licence will be decided following the 
analysis of this data. 
Health, Safety and the Environment 
(‘HSE’)
The Company continues to be committed to 
maintaining the highest standards in HSE 
management. No injuries or environmental 
incidents have been reported for the period 
under review. 
Since 2008, the Company has set up 
policies and procedures to conduct 
business in a safe, healthy and ethical 
manner. In 2011, the Company developed 
policies and procedures to achieve 
compliance with the UK Bribery Act and 
extended these principles to all the 
subsidiaries of the Group. 
 
Wildcat Exploration
Italy
In the Southern Apennines, the Group 
operates the Monte Grosso project, holding 
a 22.89% interest. The project is a high 
quality near field exploration opportunity 
close to one of the largest onshore oil 
producing areas in Western Europe. The 
Monte Grosso 2 exploration project 
presently remains on hold, pending 
resolution of residual permitting issues, 
which the Group presently believes should 
be positively resolved and allow a project 
start-up in mid 2014 (subject to rig 
availability). The Monte Grosso 2 well  
is targeting 280 MMbbls of unrisked 
prospective resources (64 MMbbls net to 
the Group) at a depth of 6,500m. Permitting 
and existing well site maintenance works 
were the main activities conducted during 
the period.
Offshore Malta
The Group operates Area 4 Offshore  
Malta (MOG W.I. 90%). Area 4 comprises 
approximately 5,700 sq km of deep water 
acreage north of the internationally-
recognised border between Malta 
and Libya.
The area is frontier exploration where no 
drilling activity has occurred and it is one of 
the rare areas that still remains to be 
explored in the Mediterranean basin. It is a 
high risk, but potentially a high reward 
geological environment where 9 prospects 
have been identified by RPS with a total of 
1,500 MMbbls of unrisked prospective oil 
resources. 
The Malta Production Sharing Contract 
(‘PSC’) was signed with the Maltese 
Government in July 2008. In May 2011, the 
Company agreed an 18 month extension  
to the first exploration period of the PSC 
with the Maltese Government, thus 
extending the first exploration period  
until mid-January 2013. The Company  
also announced the planned farm-out  
of a 75% W.I. to Dominion Petroleum Limited 
(‘Dominion’), subject to the approval of 
Dominion’s shareholders. Dominion was 
unable to secure the necessary approval 
and exercised its right to terminate the 
transaction.  13

Operational Overview
MOG has a broad portfolio of production, development and exploration assets and a 
secure financial position. Revenues from gas sales are now providing a sound financial 
position going forward.
Over the next 12 months, MOG intends to progress its key assets and pursue attractive and 
material strategic growth opportunities that we expect to identify.
One of the strengths of the Company is the wide international experience of its senior 
managers, in particular in the Mediterranean area and the operational capability of its staff 
and organisation. This has been preserved during the critical period of financial uncertainty 
in 2011 and we believe that it is now a key strength for the ambitious growth objectives of 
the Group.

DRS Data and Research Services plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015
AT A GLANCE
DRS is a specialist provider of automated data capture 
technology and solutions in the UK and overseas to 
three market sectors: Education, Elections and Census.
DRS specialises in providing sophisticated scanning and software data capture technologies, and solutions for 
education, elections and censuses all over the world. Our many years of experience in the field of data capture 
and our unique combination of skills enables us to deliver complete solutions designed to meet market and 
customer demands. 
As a business we continue to focus on solutions that provide for large-scale secure capture and processing of high-stakes data, 
primarily from manually completed, paper-based forms and the output of the results to a fixed schedule. These results might 
be election counts, census results or examination marks. Two of the markets, Census and Elections, offer opportunities that, 
while they are high value are, by their nature, non-recurring and tend to be project based requiring specific customisation. 
By contrast, events in the Education market such as examinations are regular and repeatable and offer the opportunity for 
recurring revenue streams. We have a particular objective to maintain a stable UK revenue stream and increase revenue from 
the international Education market.

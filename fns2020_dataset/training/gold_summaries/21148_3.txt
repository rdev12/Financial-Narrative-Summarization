The year 
The last 12 months have been ones of 
considerable success for Auto Trader.  
These results are our strongest yet.  
We grew revenue by 10% year-on-year to  
£281.6 million. Underlying operating profit 
was £171.3 million, representing an increase 
of 19% over the previous year. From the 
growth in value we have provided to both 
retailers and manufacturers, to the increase  
in our consumer engagement and audience 
metrics, Auto Trader continues to lead the 
way in the digital automotive classified sector.
Life as a public company 
This was Auto Trader’s first year as a  
public company. The transition has been 
relatively smooth and is, in effect, complete. 
Fortunately, as the results indicate, it has  
not distracted the business from its focus  
on driving value for our customers.
Our Board 
Since our stock market flotation in March 
2015, we have appointed three Independent 
Non-Executive Directors to our Board. 
We welcome them all and appreciate the 
contribution they have already made. David 
Keens, formerly Group Finance Director of 
NEXT plc, has taken on the roles of Senior 
Independent Director and Audit Committee 
Chairman. Jill Easterbrook, until recently  
a senior executive at Tesco plc, has taken  
on the role of Remuneration Committee 
Chairman. Jeni Mundy, a senior executive  
at Vodafone Group plc, completes our new 
Board, bringing a huge depth of knowledge 
of the fast changing mobile data environment. 
All three serve on our Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination committees.
Tom Hall and Nick Hartman resigned from 
the Board in March 2016 under the terms of 
the relationship agreement with our previous 
major shareholder. The Board would like to 
acknowledge the major contribution they 
have made to the Auto Trader business, not 
least in migrating Auto Trader from a primarily 
print based business to an entirely digital 
business. At a personal level, Tom and Nick 
have been outstanding Board members and 
will be missed. 
Chip Perry, Independent Non-Executive 
Director, resigned from the Board in March 
2016. Chip has returned to a full-time  
CEO role at TrueCar Inc. Regrettably,  
he felt that the responsibilities of a CEO  
of a public company based in California  
were incompatible with the obligations of 
consistently attending Board meetings in  
the UK. However, he has kindly agreed to 
give us access to his unparalleled industry 
knowledge by continuing to help us in an 
advisory capacity.
The composition of the Board is now  
fully compliant with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
Capital structure
As indicated at the time of our stock market 
flotation, we commenced paying a dividend 
in the year, with surplus cash being used to 
pay down debt towards a two times debt 
leverage target. Most of the cash generated 
this year has been used to pursue that goal, 
which we have achieved following the end  
of the financial year. 
Shareholders can anticipate a significant 
increase in the dividend during the coming 
financial year in line with our prior guidance 
and the Board aims promptly to return to 
shareholders the majority of the surplus  
cash generated by way of a share buyback 
programme, with some surplus cash being 
used to further reduce indebtedness.
Employee contribution 
I would like to take this opportunity to express 
my thanks to all the employees of Auto Trader 
for what has been an extremely busy, as well 
as successful, year.

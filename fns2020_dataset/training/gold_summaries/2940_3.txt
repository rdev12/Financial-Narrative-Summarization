 Total revenue, including Joint Ventures, increased by 13 per cent 
to nearly £4 billion (2006: £3.5 billion), primarily due to organic
growth in support services and Middle East construction services
together with a full twelve months revenue contribution from the
businesses acquired with Mowlem in February 2006.
Underlying profit before tax from continuing operations increased
by 23 per cent to £101.8 million (2006: £82.6 million) and
underlying earnings per share from continuing operations on 
the same basis rose by 22 per cent to 28.9 pence per share 
(2006: 23.7 pence). 
Underlying cash flow from operations of £135.7 million 
(2006: £99.1 million) comfortably exceeded underlying operating
profit. Net borrowing at 31 December 2007 was £44.9 million 
(2006: £108.0 million) and average net borrowing in 2007 
was £130.3 million (2006: £148.0 million post the acquisition 
of Mowlem).
The Group has continued to develop the strong positions it holds
in a wide range of growth markets, winning new orders during
the year worth some £4.0 billion. At 31 December 2007 the Group’s
forward order book stood at £16.0 billion (2006: £16.0 billion)
and its pipeline of probable new orders had increased significantly
to £3.6 billion (2006: £1.6 billion).
Given the strength of the Group’s performance in 2007 
and prospects for 2008 and the medium term, the Board is
recommending a final ordinary dividend for 2007 of 7.5 pence 
per share, making the total full-year dividend for 2007 11.0 pence
per share, an increase of 22 per cent on the total paid in respect 
of 2006 (9.0 pence). The final dividend will be paid on 
20 June 2008 to shareholders on the register at close of business
on 25 April 2008.
As I announced in my 2006 report to shareholders, Chris Girling
retired from the Board in April 2007 and was succeeded as Group
Finance Director by Richard Adam who joined the Board from
Associated British Ports Holdings plc where he had been Group
Finance Director since 1999. In January 2008, we were delighted
to welcome David Hurcomb to the Board as an Executive Director.
David joined Carillion in 2005 having held a number of senior
positions in our industry. With extensive experience of our key
market sectors, David will make a valuable contribution to
Carillion’s development.
The credit for what Carillion has achieved is due to the 
leadership of our management team and the commitment and
professionalism of our people. On behalf of the Board I should 
like to thank all our employees for the contribution they have
made to Carillion’s success in 2007. 
The acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in February 2008 has
further strengthened Carillion’s position as a leading support
services and integrated solutions business and the Board
expects the Group to make further strong progress in 2008
and deliver materially enhanced earnings in 2009.

2007 was another strong year for
Carillion. The Group delivered record
profits and continued its strategic
development to support sustainable,
profitable growth. In particular, the
successful integration of the Carillion 
and Mowlem businesses has created 
a stronger, more resilient business, 
with enhanced positions in selected
growth markets.

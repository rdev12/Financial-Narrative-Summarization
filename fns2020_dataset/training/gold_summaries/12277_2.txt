 CaT	 technology	 is	 a	 calcium	 	
absorption	 aid.	
In trials it has been found to deliver 
calcium to the plant up to 50 times  
more effectively than traditional  
calcium products and with fewer  
applications and less input.
InCa
InCa	 –	 5	 per	 cent	 calcium,	 1	 per	 cent	
zinc	 (w/w)	 incorporates	 Plant	 Impact’s	
CaT	 chemistry.
InCa is the new global calcium delivery 
system. It can be applied as a foliar 
spray or through drip irrigation or 
fertigation systems.
PiNT	 technology	 is	 a	 yield	 	
maximiser.	
It is a unique controlled Nitrogen 
release technology that promotes 
improved growth habit and vigour.  
It slows the natural breakdown of 
desirable amine and ammonium 
nitrogen to undesirable nitrate and 
minimises leaching.
PiNT	 calcium
PiNT	 calcium	 is	 a	 unique	 controlled	
uptake	 nitrogen/calcium	 fertiliser	 for	
quality,	 yield,	 root	 promotion	 and	
stress	 tolerance.	
It is especially valuable in arid/
semi-arid regions, high pH soils, saline 
soils, high sodium soils or where 
irrigation water is of low quality.  
PiNT calcium improves yield, quality, 
homogeneity extends the productive  
life of the crop.
PiNT	 potassium
PiNT	 potassium	 is	 a	 unique	 controlled	
uptake	 nitrogen/potassium	 fertiliser	
for	 quality,	 yield,	 root	 promotion	 and	
stress	 tolerance.	
It is especially valuable in crops with a 
high K requirement such as tomatoes, 
fruit, vegetable and palm crops.

What we do
Plant Impact specialise in 
plant stress relief and a 
dynamic and uncompromising 
new approach to crop nutrition 
and crop health. This gives 
growers significantly 
increased marketable yields, 
more consistent quality with 
reduced environmental 
impact, leading to the ethically 
grown food demanded by 
consumers and the food chain.
Our technologies and products
Plant Impact at a glance
CaT technology PiNT™ technology Speedo	 technology	 accelerates	 	
plant	 maturation.	
Speedo technology has the ability to 
increase the efficacy of nutrient 
products. It accelerates reproductive 
growth leading to faster and better 
colour, flowering, sugar production and 
maturity. Earlier yielding crops give the 
option for additional harvest and or 
prolonged harvests of extra crops.
Balance
Balance	 delivers	 larger	 and	 more	
uniform	 produce	 with	 improved	
colouring.	 It	 also	 reduces	 fruit	 drop.
Balance now also utilises Pi’s Speedo 
chemistry, which gives much quicker 
activity than conventional fertilisers. 
Speedo chemistry improves colour, 
flowering, and sugar content of fruit  
and vegetable crops.
Saxon
Even	 in	 ideal	 conditions	 soil	 nutrients	
can	 become	 ‘locked	 up’	 and	 unavailable	
to	 the	 plants	 roots.	
In adverse conditions growth, yield  
and quality is reduced by poor soil 
conditions, drought, salinity, and pest 
and disease damage. Speedo Saxon 
contains high levels of all nutrients  
in highly available forms to feed the 
plant when the roots cannot.
Alethea	 technology	 is	 a	 powerful	 plant	
stress	 reliever.	
Alethea is a unique abiotic stress 
tolerance chemistry that together with 
plant nutrients improves growth during 
stressful climatic conditions. Disease 
resistance has also been observed in 
crops grown with this technology 
Alethea has been used in combination 
with our PiNT technology for a three 
year trial on the cocoa crop in  
Costa Rica.
CST	 –	 Cocoa	 Stress	 Tolerance
A	 new	 class	 of	 product	 that	 allows	
cocoa	 plants	 to	 increase	 yield	 in	 the	
presence	 of	 disease.
CST is a product based principally on 
Plant Impact’s Alethea stress relief 
technology in combination with PiNT 
technology. It enables cocoa plants to 
withstand disease attack by increasing 
nutrient levels and plant health.
Scope
Scope	 is	 a	 powerful	 anti-stress	 product	
that	 works	 exceptionally	 well	 across	 a	
wide	 variety	 of	 crops.
It is a high analysis glycine amino acid 
chelate combining secondary and trace 
elements with Plant Impact’s Alethea 
technology.
BugOil
®
	 is	 a	 benign	 insect	 and	 mite	
control	 agent.	
BugOil
®
 is plant essential oil technology 
that offers highly effective control  
in a non-toxic environmentally friendly 
method. This technology has been 
trialled extensively across a broad 
spectrum of crops on a wide variety  
of target pests against the current 
leading synthetic standards with 
exceptional results.
BugOil
®
BugOil
®
	 is	 based	 totally	 on	 food	 grade	
materials	 already	 in	 the	 human	
food-chain.
BugOil
®
 is a natural insecticide which 
combats sap sucking insects in an 
environmentally friendly manner. 
Fewer applications combined with 
greater efficiency make BugOil
®
 a 
world beating product.

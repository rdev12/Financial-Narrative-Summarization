Our business model
Our vertically-integrated operations
We own and operate a vertically-
integrated supply chain, from 
production through distribution to 
point-of-sale. This means we can  
make great tasting, high quality 
bakery food at great prices offering 
value for our customers.
Our target market 
Food on-the-go is a growing market. 
Greggs is a brand with broad appeal, 
attracting customers of all types and 
we have the opportunity to fulfil more 
of their needs by focusing on great 
tasting food-on-the-go, at all times  
of the day. 
Our market locations 
Convenience is key in the food-on-
the-go market and we continue to 
open and relocate shops to ensure 
that our estate is well positioned.  
A high proportion of our openings  
are in areas away from traditional high 
streets as we diversify our portfolio in 
line with market trends. Working with 
franchise partners, we have extended 
the Greggs offer to previously 
inaccessible travel, workplace and 
other convenience locations.

Our offering to customers
Our vision
… is to be a winning brand  
in the food-on-the-go market. 
How will we achieve this?
Our people... are what makes our 
business successful. We aim to provide 
them with a great place to work, where 
they feel valued.
Our food... is made with high quality, 
wholesome ingredients. Our daily-fresh 
sandwiches and freshly-baked savouries 
ensure that we deliver food that is both 
high quality and great value for money  
to our customers.
Our shops... are being remodelled and 
relocated to meet the demands of busy 
food-on-the-go customers.
Our vertically-integrated supply 
network... currently comprises 12 
bakeries, one distribution centre and one 
manufacturing centre of excellence for 
savouries. This allows us to make and 
deliver great value, fresh products to our 
shops every day.
Our values... commit us to being 
enthusiastic and supportive in all that  
we do, open, honest and appreciative, 
treating everyone with fairness, 
consideration and respect.
Our commitment to sharing the 
benefits of our success... is deep-
rooted and was cemented by the 
establishment of the Greggs Foundation 
in 1987. Along with our values it forms 
the bedrock of our approach to social 
responsibility.

Officer’s Review
We have built a truly international reputation in 
the research community for the reliability of our 
products and the support we offer. 
The development of our 
systems and the power of the 
internet enable us to focus our 
marketing effectively and to 
provide a targeted, high-value 
service at the individual 
researcher level. At the same 
time, our product range has 
expanded to more than 44,000 
products and sales have 
increased by 49.7% to £36.7m. 
We continue to strike a balance 
between current year growth 
and investment for the future. 
Even so, profit before taxation 
increased by 48.2% from £5.5m 
to £8.2m before charging 
£250k in costs associated  
with the potential offer process 
last summer. 
What is also very exciting is the 
29.8% growth achieved in the 
number of products in the 
catalogue and the breadth 
covered by the new products. 
One of the strengths of the 
team that sources externally 
manufactured antibodies from 
original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs) is the 
diversity of deals that they can 
cover in building the catalogue. 
This year, deals range from one 
adding almost 3,000 antibodies 
immediately to those on 
individual products from niche 
researchers. It is encouraging 
also that we have built a 
sufficient market share such 
that the desirability of pursuing 
exclusive product line 
acquisition (PLA) deals has 
reduced. We do not rule out 
doing more PLA deals in the 
future, if the deals are lucrative; 
however as a source of growth 
and capturing market share 
their role and importance has 
diminished. Overall, we are now 
managing relationships with 
more than 250 suppliers and 
see growth both from new 
products that our established 
suppliers bring to us and from 
the continued addition of new 
suppliers. We are also 
expanding the breadth of 
antibody-related reagents that 
we can cover, giving us access 
to new markets; for example, 
this year we have almost 
doubled our proteins range.
Our HTP facility is now well 
established in its new building. 
The production levels of 
polyclonal antibodies now 
exceed the levels achieved in 
our old facility, with the capacity 
to increase this in line with 
market demand. We are also 
seeing the monoclonal 
antibodies coming out of the 
developmental stages of the 
facility, and showing good initial 
sales. 
A further, particularly satisfying 
achievement is the introduction 
of high-throughput screening 
assays into the HTP facility, 
leading to increased levels and 
quality of characterisation 
which we can now provide with 
all our products. This is a key 
driver of our growth and we are 
delighted with the amount of 
characterisation data that is 
being generated.  
Both our OEM product sourcing 
strategies and HTP product 
development are driven by our 
approach to the segmentation 
of the research market into 
Core Focus Areas (CFAs). This 
year we have continued to build 
our CFA strategy through the 
development and integration of 
product, marketing, events and 
support teams within each CFA. 
We have found that the CFA 
approach is very effective in 
capturing market share and 
continue to add further CFAs in 
order to maintain this momentum. 
We started the year with six 
CFAs and we added two further 
to take our total number to eight 
fully established CFAs. 
A key area of development 
based around the CFAs is in the 
activities of the scientific events 
team, which organises and runs 
conferences and seminars. To 
help across all our CFAs we 
have also been developing an 
expert system – the Target 
Selection Database (TSDB) – to 
help in the quality of candidate 
targets that we can select. The 
TSDB is a powerful data-mining 
tool that integrates both internal 
and external scientific data 
sources to provide a 
comprehensive profile of the 
commercial potential of a target 
in half the time taken previously.
We have a highly efficient 
business, with end-to-end 
systems linking the public 
website directly through to 
product ordering, inventory 
management, logistics and 
accounting. The resulting real-
time data gives us strong 
operational and financial 
control and enables us to adopt 
an agile and responsive 
approach to the management of 
the business.
Since the creation of the 
company ten years ago our 
strong focus has been on 
serving the researcher and our 
business philosophy and 
processes are all based around 
their needs and the 
achievement of their objectives. 
During that time our products 
have been used in ground-
breaking research and 
referenced in thousands of 
publications, thus enhancing 
our international reputation. 
This commitment is also core to 
our future as through the 
development of our systems we 
build on our relationships, 
offering an ever more relevant 
service to each individual as 
our product range and 
geographic reach expand.

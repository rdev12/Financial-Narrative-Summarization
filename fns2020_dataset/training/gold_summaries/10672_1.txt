ANNUAL REPORT 2007
2007 significantly exceeded 2006’s record result and, if palm-oil prices and crops continue
as favourably as they have proved so far this year, 2008 should turn in another excellent result.
Good progress continues to be achieved in the implementation of the Group’s strategy of
diversifying out of Malaysian plantations and real estate and into Indonesian palm oil and
Australian beef cattle. The prospects for both palm oil and beef cattle continue to look positive
for the foreseeable future.

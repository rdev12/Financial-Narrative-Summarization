Delivering returns 
to shareholders
Archipelago achieved impressive results in its ﬁrst 
full year of production. Our strong cash generating 
proﬁle means we can start delivering concrete 
returns to our shareholders.
“ A key management objective is Archipelago’s 
focus on strong cash generation. Our capacity 
to generate strong cash ﬂows provides an 
opportunity to pursue a number of corporate 
initiatives, including the payment of dividends.”

Archipelago Resources plc 
Annual Report 2012
I am pleased to report that Archipelago 
generated exceptional results in FY2012, 
our ﬁrst full year of production at our Toka 
Tindung gold mine.
In line with our focus on shareholder value, 
we successfully delivered on our goals and 
milestones. We met our initial production 
targets set at the beginning of 2012 at a 
competitive cash cost, demonstrating our 
ability to deliver consistent results from our 
operating activities. These positive outcomes 
resulted in the Company posting a robust 
proﬁt and generating strong cash ﬂows.
Our most important objective is ensuring 
that our employees work within a safe  
and healthy environment. During 2012,  
the Company had no lost-time injuries.  
We intend to build on this positive outcome 
and maintain our focus on safety and health 
as a management priority.
We continue to achieve encouraging 
exploration results from our highly 
prospective Toka Tindung gold mine,  
with a material increase to our JORC 
compliant mineral Resource and Reserve 
reported in Q1 2012. In addition, our low 
risk brownﬁelds exploration programme 
generated impressive intersections, 
adjacent and ‘down-dip’, to our high 
grade southern deposits and at our main 
Toka pit. We will continue to invest capital 
on a targeted near-mine exploration 
programme, with the aim of delivering 
further increases to the mine life.
The ability to expand the mineral reserve 
and achieve consistent operating results  
at Toka Tindung provides the foundation 
for our organic growth strategy and  
we are assessing mining and plant 
expansion options to increase production. 
We have already commenced the process 
of expanding our CIL tank capability and 
will be ﬁnalising a review of other options 
in the near future.
The outlook for our industry remains 
a positive one. Despite global economic 
volatility, we see signiﬁcant opportunity  
for Archipelago in the near term and  
we continually review opportunities for 
collaboration and consolidation in what  
can only be described as a fragmented gold 
sector. We adopt a prudent approach to all 
corporate activity, with the focus being on 
quality and on transactions that are clearly 
accretive from a shareholder perspective.
In the context of our delivery against our 
2012 objectives, I am now pleased to 
provide a further detailed review of our 
business and direction.
Social Licence
The Toka Tindung gold mine, Archipelago’s 
core operating asset, is located on the 
northern tip of the island of Sulawesi, 
Indonesia. It is approximately 35km 
northeast of the regional capital of 
Manado. Covering an area of 400km
2
,  
the mine comprises two Contract of  
Work arrangements and ﬁve open pits – 
the main Toka Tindung pit and the four 
satellite deposits of Araren, Pajajaran, 
Kopra and Blambangan.
As a growing economic entity and the 
largest employer in the region, Archipelago 
makes a signiﬁcant contribution to local 
communities from an employment, 
procurement, investment and cultural 
perspective. There are 11 villages within 
the vicinity of Toka Tindung and a 
population of over 10,000 people live 
in locations surrounding our operations.
In support of these communities, 
Archipelago continued to make signiﬁcant 
investments in infrastructure, schools, 
medical services and fresh water supply 
systems during 2012. In this regard, 
Archipelago has excellent relations with 
local community leaders and the regional 
government. Maintaining our strong social 
licence remains a cornerstone of our success 
as a gold producer in South East Asia.
Throughout 2012, Archipelago maintained 
its adherence to best practice environmental 
standards. Given the high rainfall location  
in which we operate, Archipelago is focused 
on maintaining superior water management 
and treatment systems; ensuring the quality 
of supply to downstream communities.
Operational Performance
In 2012, Taka Tindung recorded production 
of 1 39,012 Au Eq oz. Over the full year, the 
average head grade for Au Eq oz was 2.79g/t.
Throughout 2012, Archipelago continued  
to mine from the main Toka pit. Ore was  
also accessed from the higher grade satellite 
deposits, initially at Araren and Pajajaran; 
with mining commencing at Kopra towards 
the end of the year. By accessing these high 
grade deposits with ore near the surface, 
Archipelago achieved a decline in the strip 
ratio as the year progressed (reporting a full 
year strip ratio of 5.64:1).

Drier seasonal conditions towards the end of 
2012, coupled with the sourcing of higher 
grade ore, meant that our production proﬁle 
was skewed towards greater output rates in 
the second half of the year. This is a trend 
which I expect to be repeated in future 
years, given the historically high levels of 
rainfall during the January to March wet 
season at Toka Tindung (and the ﬂow on 
impact of this on mining activities). 
In 2012, our processing plant operated in 
line with nameplate capacity of 1.7mtpa. 
Recovery rates also remained relatively 
constant throughout the year at 90.3%. 
Meeting production targets and maintaining 
a strong focus on input costs were key 
contributors in Archipelago achieving industry 
low cash costs of US$635 per oz (net of  
silver credits). Cost management remains  
a key focus for Archipelago, as we explore 
continuous improvement initiatives aimed at 
increasing productivity and cash margins.
In 2013, Archipelago anticipates production 
of 140,000 to 155,000 Au Eq oz, as we 
continue to mine at Toka, in addition to the 
high grade deposits of Kopra and Pajajaran; 
with ore also planned to be sourced from  
a newly opened pit at the Blambangan 
deposit later in the year. 2013 cash cost 
guidance is US$620 to US$680 per Au oz. 
Revenue
Revenue from gold sales for the year was 
US$225 million (201 1: US$93 million) with 
129,305 (201 1: 60,367) ounces sold at an 
average price of US$1,676 (201 1: US$1,675) 
per ounce.
Gross Proﬁt 
Gross proﬁt in 2012 was US$102 million 
(2011: US$45 million), reﬂecting increased 
volumes and strong management of 
operating costs.
Earnings before Interest & Tax (EBIT)
EBIT was US$84 million (201 1: US$31 
million), after accounting for US$18 million 
(201 1: US$14 million) in administrative & 
other costs. The increase, namely for 
administrative costs, has been due to higher 
employment costs associated with increased 
head count.
Proﬁt before Tax
The Group reported a proﬁt before  
tax of US$76 million in the year ended 
31 December 2012, compared with a 
proﬁt of US$26 million in the year ended 
31 December 2011. 2012 was our ﬁrst year 
of full production.
Taxation
The Group’s taxation charge amounted to 
US$28 million in 2012 (201 1: US$13 million), 
analysed as follows:
Year ended 31 December 
2012 
US$000
2011 
US$000
Indonesia
 Current year 18,750 5,757
 Deferred 9,620 7,489
Total 28,370 13,2 46
The higher income tax expense is reﬂective 
of increased proﬁtability; however the 
Group’s effective tax rate for 2012 
declined to 37% (2011: 51 %), favourably 
impacting income tax expense.
Exploration
The Toka Tindung mine is highly prospective 
and remains open at depth and along strike. 
In 201 1, Archipelago conducted a targeted 
exploration programme which, in early 2012, 
led to the announcement of a material 
increase to our Resource (up 52% ) to  
2.58M Au oz and Reserve (up 60% ) to  
1.47M Au oz. Based on the expanded 
Reserve, Archipelago was also able to justify 
extending the life of mine to sixteen years; 
being nine years mining plus seven years of 
stockpile processing.

Building on the successes of 2011, 
Archipelago’s 2012 exploration 
programme focused on further targeted 
drilling activities at depth along known 
deposits and adjacent mineralised zones. 
Our aim was to increase the level of 
conﬁdence of the Resource, thereby 
allowing further conversion of additional 
ounces to the Reserve category. 
Concurrent to this, testing for further 
mineralisation at depth and along strike 
was aimed at expanding the overall 
Resource base. 
For a spend of US$12 million over the  
2012 year, Archipelago drilled 581 reverse 
circulation and diamond drill holes for 
82,391m at Toka Tindung. A series of 
exceptional results were released throughout 
the year. For prospects at or adjacent to the 
southern deposits, results included:

Kopra
– 27m at 5.56g/t Au (KIP020, 169-196m)
– 9m at 5.32g/t Au (KIP012, 135-144m)
 Blambangan 
– 3. 1m at 49.76g/t Au (BPD042,  
205.9-209m)
– 24m at 5.64g/t Au (BP020, 16-20m)
– 14m at 8.03g/t Au (BP015, 0-14m)
 Jipang
– 10m at 16.6g/t Au (JIP89A, 52-62m)
– 7m at 10.00g/t Au (JIP102, 46-52m)
 Pajajaran 
– 13m at 9.44g/t Au (PJJ032, 1 73-186m)
– 8m at 8.8g/t Au (PJJ003, 143-151m)
 Semut 
– 2m at 1 1.70g/t Au (SMB038, 145-147m)
At Toka East, adjacent to the Toka main 
pit, further impressive results were 
released, including:

25m at 2.45g/t (TITO058, 106-131m)
 12m at 4.96g/t (TITO078, 87-99m)
 14m at 3.34g/t (TITO015A, 101-1 15m)
The results demonstrate the prospective 
nature of Toka Tindung and the high 
likelihood that we will further expand the 
Resource and Reserve. In 2013, Archipelago 
will continue to invest in targeted near site 
exploration, with further drilling to occur at 
Toka East, Toka North and the southern high 
grade deposits. In addition, Archipelago 
expects to commence drilling the nearby 
Marawuwung prospect during the course  
of the year. 
Dividend
A key management objective is 
Archipelago’s focus on strong cash 
generation. Our capacity to generate  
strong cash ﬂows provides an opportunity  
to pursue a number of corporate initiatives, 
including the payment of dividends. 
Further to this objective and subsequent to 
year end, we announced the adoption of  
a dividend policy with the intention to pay 
shareholders interim and ﬁnal dividends  
of at least 10% of operating cash ﬂows. 
This provides our shareholders with 
exposure to the upside of an increase  
to the gold price and signiﬁcant leverage 
on cash operating margins. Where 
appropriate, the Company may also  
pay special dividends from time to time. 
In recognition of Archipelago’s ﬁrst full year 
of production, I am pleased to conﬁrm our 
intention to pay a dividend for the 2012 
ﬁnancial year, subject to shareholder 
approval and completing a court approved 
reduction of the share premium account. 
Speciﬁcally, Archipelago anticipates paying 
an “interim dividend” of 1.25p per ordinary 
share and a further one-off “special 
dividend” of 1p per ordinary share.

Archipelago Resources plc 
Annual Report 2012
The proposed payment of an inaugural 
dividend demonstrates the transformation 
of Archipelago from an explorer/developer 
to an emergent stable cash producer, 
generating healthy cash ﬂows and 
providing real returns for shareholders. 
Outlook and Strategy
In 2013, Archipelago’s focus remains on 
delivering production and operational 
outcomes in line with our guidance and 
performance expectations. We will 
continue exploration initiatives to expand 
our Resource and Reserve, which will 
support plant expansion and the ability  
to increase production rates in the 
foreseeable future. Archipelago will also 
pursue opportunities for collaboration in 
the gold sector, with particular emphasis 
on the Asia-Paciﬁc region. 
In this regard, I am grateful for the ongoing 
support of our major shareholder, PT Rajawali 
Corporation, which is held in high esteem for 
its leadership role across the region, fostering 
a culture of transparency and strong 
corporate governance in South East Asia. 
Archipelago continues to beneﬁt from the 
association with Rajawali and the network 
this brings. This collaboration is a key point  
of differentiation for Archipelago relative  
to other miners operating in the region. 
In conclusion, I take this opportunity to 
thank our employees and shareholders  
for their contribution to our success.

 6 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2002 
Chief Executive’ s
review
Overview of continuing business
We began 2002 with a more focused
Group and in a much stronger position
than 2001. This enabled the Group 
to concentrate on what it does best –
publishing and launching specialist
consumer magazines. Each of our four
businesses in the UK, US, France and
Italy improved in 2002. 
Business activities
Our diverse portfolio of 82 specialist
consumer magazines is focused around
computer games, computing and other
specialist sectors and it is worth
commenting on these before considering
their progress geographically.
Computer games
In 2002, 45% of revenues derived 
from computer games magazines,
a sector which has been growing
strongly. The computer games sector
is estimated to have had worldwide
hardware and software sales of 
$27bn in 2002. The larger players in
this market are Sony, Microsoft and
Nintendo, with combined sales of their
latest games consoles (PlayStation 2,
Xbox and GameCube) of an estimated
60 million since their products were
launched over the last two years or so.
Future is the worldwide leader in
computer games magazines, with
2002 revenues of £76m and monthly
average sales of owned and licensed
magazines of some 2.5 million. We
have Official magazine relationships
with Sony (UK); with Microsoft
(worldwide Official Xbox magazine
rights, excluding Japan); and Nintendo
(France and Italy). Additionally, we have
a strong portfolio of unofficial titles,
including the world’ s biggest-selling 
PC games magazine, PC Gamer.
Future’ s Official magazines benefit from
a close relationship with the console
manufacturers, though Future retains
full editorial control. PlayStation 2 and
Xbox Official magazines also feature
an exclusive disc of playable game
demos. The detailed financial terms 
of our Official magazine relationships
are not disclosed but usually represent
a form of royalty payable in relation to
numbers of magazines sold. 
During the year, Future strengthened
its worldwide leading position, with
gains in market share in the UK, US
and France. We have launched the
Official Xbox Magazine in our four
countries and licensed it in a further
three. We have announced that subject
to regulatory approval, we have agreed
to acquire three computer games
magazines from Hachette in France.
Computing
Computing titles provided 33% of our
2002 magazine revenues. Future is 
a significant publisher of computing
magazines in its four territories, with
2002 revenues of £54m. In 2002 
the computing sector continued to
experience difficult market conditions.
This has been more pronounced in the
business and professional sector than
in the consumer PC sector where
Future largely operates. 
Against this background, we feel that
our performance has been relatively
robust: our total computing revenue
increase was 2%. This was driven by an
entrepreneurial determination to seek
out new revenue streams, including
launches, and to take market share. 
Chief amongst the launches was
Microsoft Windows XP: The Official
Magazine, which we published from
January under an agreement with
Microsoft in the UK, quite separate from
our Xbox relationship. Later in 2002,
we launched this successfully in France.
Other specialist titles
These titles are published in the 
UK, and also represent a very
significant, and growing, part of 
our licensed portfolio. These other
specialist titles provided 22% of 
Group 2002 magazine revenues.
These titles are published by our
Entertainment division, which is
responsible for about half of the 
UK’ s 54 titles. The division covers

10 separate sub-sectors, including
technology, music and music-making,
film, mountain-biking, stitching, football,
and motoring. The majority of these
sub-sectors are aimed at young male
readers, and Future holds leading
positions in several of them.
Review of business by territory
UK performance
Our UK business remains by far the
largest of Future’s operations and
provides much of the original editorial
material which is used in our licensing
activities and also by our mainland
European subsidiaries. The business
returned to launching new magazines
in 2002, and increased revenues and
improved profitability.
The UK business is the heart of 
Future, representing 58% of the
Group’ s continuing revenues and 
the clear majority of its profits. 
It publishes 54 magazines and
employs just over 600 staff. It is 
also the most diversified business
within the Group, covering computer
games (13 magazines), computing 
(16 magazines), and entertainment
(25 magazines). Continuing revenue
split: 72% circulation, 23% advertising,
5% other (primarily licensing). By
sector, the revenue split is: computer
games (34%), computing (29%) and
entertainment (other specialist) (37%).
The UK business (Future Publishing
and the smaller Xbox magazine
publishing business FXM International)
increased adjusted operating profits
from £13.3m to £16.7m and increased
margins from 15% to 17% in terms 
of adjusted operating profit as a
percentage of turnover.
Overall computer games magazines
sales, including launches, increased 
by 23% year-on-year to 690,000 
copies per month. Future’ s share 
of the UK computer games magazine
market increased from 55% to 61%
year-on-year by volume and from 60%
to 67% by value. Future estimates it
gained more than three-quarters of 
the overall sector increase in copy
sales value during the year.
In computing, the launch of Microsoft
Windows XP: The Official Magazine
offset circulation declines elsewhere 
in the UK computing division, which
achieved an overall portfolio increase
in copy sales of over 5% year-on-year.
The Entertainment division (other
specialist) delivered a solid performance
overall – in particular the music titles,
where six out of our eight magazines
recorded year-on-year growth.
UK advertising revenue increased 
by 1% (advertising revenue compared
with continuing 2001 business). 
In addition to some impact from the
1. PC Gamer is the Group’ s biggest-selling
magazine. It is the market leader in the
US and the UK and is published in France
(PC Jeux) and Italy (Giochi per il Mio Computer).
2. The Group has published Official PlayStation
magazines since 1995. Overall Future’ s
share of the UK computer games magazine
market increased from 55% to 61%
year-on-year by volume.
3. PSM is an unofficial PlayStation magazine
that the Group sells in the US. It is the
biggest-selling PlayStation magazine of 
any type in the US.

well-documented general advertising
difficulties in 2002, we were also
affected by continuing toughness 
in technology-related advertising. 
The UK business includes high margin
revenues from licensing editorial
content to third parties and to Group
companies in France and Italy. In 2002,
third party licensing revenues for the
UK were £1.8m (2001: £2.3m) and
intra-Group, £1.2m (2001: £1.4m).
US performance
In the US we have seen dramatic
progress in our operations. This has
been led by a 24% revenue increase,
primarily due to the success of our
computer games magazines, and 
also by a much tighter management
focus on costs.
The US business represents 24% 
of the Group’ s continuing revenues,
publishing five magazines and
employing some 100 staff. The
business publishes computer 
games and computing magazines,
with revenues split: 49% circulation,
48% advertising, and 3% other.
I am grateful to Jonathan Simpson-
Bint, who became Managing Director
of Future Network USA during 2001
and who, together with his team very
ably led it to profitability in 2002. 
The adjusted operating profit margin 
of 11% reflects both the active
management of costs and an ability 
to take full advantage of the rising
games market. 
Future US gained market share in 
both computer games and computing
sectors in 2002. The portfolio had
growth of 25% and 21% in circulation
and advertising respectively. Future 
US now publishes the biggest-selling
PC games, PlayStation and Xbox
magazines in the US. The computing
magazine Maximum PC was the only
one in its sector in the US to show
growth in advertising pages in 2002
over 2001.
The October 2001 launch, Official Xbox
Magazine, performed well in 2002,
both on circulation and on advertising.
We increased its ratebase (guaranteed
copy sales to advertisers) from
250,000 to 325,000 copies sold per
month. This will be increased further 
in 2003 to 400,000.
Mainland Europe performance
Our European operations in France 
and Italy made progress in 2002. They
increased their revenues by 18%, but
have not yet reached the desired level
of profitability. We have strengthened
the management of both businesses.
Mainland Europe represents 18% 
of the Group’ s continuing revenues. 
We now publish 23 magazines in 
the computer games and computing
sectors, and employ around 220 
staff. Continuing revenue split: 
74% circulation, 26% advertising.
We were pleased to welcome in the
spring of 2002 Sari Zaimi and Bernardo
Notarangelo as Managing Directors of
our French and Italian businesses. They
have been effective in leading change.
Revenues in both France and Italy 
grew strongly during the year. On 
the cost side, expenditure arose 
in relation to the completion of 
our 2001 restructuring, and also 
in making selected changes in senior
management. The net impact on 2002
results of these changes was £0.7m.
Intra-Group licensing paid to other
Group companies amounted to 
£1.4m during the year (2001: £1.4m).
Our French business publishes
13 magazines and we have recently
agreed to purchase three computer
games titles and one other magazine
from the French company, Hachette.
The transaction is subject to regulatory
approval in France. If successful,
the proposed acquisition provides
added scale, helping us to build 
a better business in France. It is 
clear that, overall, our French and
Italian businesses have improved
compared with 2001 but work 
remains to be done.

Strategy
Our strategy is both to maximise 
our position within computer games
magazines, whilst at the same 
time broadening our overall 
magazine portfolio. 
Consistent with this strategy, in 2002
we launched a total of 13 magazines –
nine computer games magazines 
and four others. We have agreed to
acquire four magazines in France 
from Hachette, subject to regulatory
approval. We will launch several 
new titles this year, and may make
further acquisitions. 
Future employs a large number of
creative and commercial people,
and I am proud to have led the Group
through what has been a successful
year. I am grateful to our management
teams for harnessing the many 
talents which lie at the heart of 
this successful publishing Group. 
We are in good shape and look 
forward with confidence.

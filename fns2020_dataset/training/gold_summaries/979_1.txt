chiEf ExEcUtivE’s REviEw Mining operations 
During the course of 2010, we were primarily 
focused on the efficiency of our flagship 
Gedabek mine, ensuring that gold production 
continued to increase quarter on quarter and 
that we realised our internal management 
target of 60,000 oz of gold for the first full 
year of production to 31 December 2010. 
As shareholders are aware, we began 
construction of the Gedabek open pit mine 
in 2008 and the mine poured its first gold 
and silver in May 2009. As is often the 
case with the start-up of a new operation, 
we experienced a few technical problems, 
however we implemented a number of 
initiatives in July and August 2009 to rectify 
these problems, expand production and 
improve efficiencies, which ideally positioned 
us for gold production growth at the 
beginning of 2010. 
As discussed in our Chairman’s statement, 
gold production exceeded management’s 
expectation for the period. For the 12 months 
to 31 December 2010, Gedabek produced 
67,267 oz of gold, of which 57,398 oz 
was sold and completed at an average of 
US$1,241 per oz for the year. It should be 
noted that Anglo Asian is currently entitled 
to 87.25% of metal production. Also, there 
will always be short-term timing differences 
between gold production for the account 
of Anglo Asian and sale of that production.
The summary table 1 of gold production 
and prices highlights the quarter-on-quarter 
gold production at Gedabek over 2010 
and post-period. 
Gedabek is a low-cost producer relative to its 
peers. For the year to 31 December 2010 we 
produced gold at a cash cost of US$412 per oz, 
excluding the Government of Azerbaijan’s share, 
and at a cash cost of US$358 per oz including 
the Government of Azerbaijan’s share.
In terms of processing, Table 2 on page 5 
summarises levels of dry ore that have been 
transferred to the leach pad on a quarterly basis 
from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010 
and post-period to 31 March 2011. In order 
to improve economic recovery, blending of 
high and low grade ore has been carried out 
in a ratio that will increase tonnes whilst 
maintaining the grade quality.
Extreme winter weather conditions during the 
first quarter of 2011 at Gedabek have resulted 
in the leaching process, which extracts gold 
from the crushed ore, becoming sluggish. 
This has affected gold production for Q1 2011 
resulting in production of 14,028 oz, below 
that of Q4 2010. However it represents a 3% 
“ We implemented a number of initiatives in July and 
August 2009 to expand production and improve 
efficiencies, which ideally positioned us for gold 
production growth at the beginning of 2010.”

increase on the comparable period for 2010, 
which saw gold production of 13,660 oz. 
The other significant factor in reduced 
production was that gold grade in Q1 2011 
was 3.32 g/t compared to 4.79 g/t in the 
equivalent period in 2010.
Copper and silver production from our 
SART operations has performed well with 
the total copper concentrate produced from 
February 2010 to 31 December 2010 containing 
183 tonnes of copper, 1,460 kg (46,940 oz) 
of silver and 25.9 kg (833 oz) of gold. The SART 
plant was fully operational in September 2010. 
See Table 3 for SART copper, silver and 
gold production.
Copper and silver recovery from our SART 
operations improved during the first quarter 
of the current year seeing us produce copper 
concentrate that contained 104 tonnes of 
copper and 762 kg (24,499 oz) of silver. 
The plant’s designed capacity is calculated 
to produce 1,800 tonnes of copper concentrate 
per year with copper recoveries projected 
to be 50–70% and silver recoveries of 4,000 
to 6,000 g/t. Further optimisation work is 
planned to reach the designed capacity.
Maintaining high health, safety, social and 
environmental standards is very important 
to us at Anglo Asian. We have approximately 
427 personnel working for the Company 
including a local management team, Azeri 
mining and earthworks contractors and 
experienced operations personnel from 
surrounding countries, of which 367 are based 
at Gedabek, where there is a permanent mine

that there have been no major or serious 
accidents during 2010 and to date in 2011.
Best environmental practice is also a top 
priority for the Company and accordingly 
Gedabek has been constructed to the highest 
environmental standards. In terms of power 
and water, we use our own diesel-powered 
generators and water supply is readily 
available from nearby streams. 
On the same theme, we were delighted to 
announce that in March 2010, the Company 
was awarded the following certificates: 
ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System, 
ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management 
System and OHSAS 18001:2007 Occupational 
Health and Safety Management System. 
Exploration
Exploration of our portfolio of gold and copper 
assets in Azerbaijan remains central to our 
growth strategy as we develop our future 
production profile to establish ourselves as 
a leading gold producer in Central Asia. 
Our portfolio, which spans 1,062 sq km, 
consists of the Gedabek Contract Area 
where we currently have gold/copper mining 
operations and the grassroots Gosha and 
Ordubad Contract Areas. All three Contract 
Areas run across the Tethyan Tectonic Belt, 
one of the world’s significant copper and 
gold bearing areas. Additionally, we hope 
to develop the 900 sq km prospects in three 
additional Contract Areas located in the 
region in Azerbaijan occupied by Armenia 
when the political situation permits.  Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2010

Exploration continued
Gedabek
We have implemented a defined exploration 
strategy aimed at increasing Gedabek’s 
resource, proving reserves and in turn 
extending Gedabek’s life of mine which 
currently stands at six years with a target 
production in excess of 300,000 oz of gold.
Whilst developing the Gedabek mine in 
2008–2009 we discovered the orebody 
had higher grades than originally forecast by 
SRK and reconnaissance work also indicated 
that there were extensions of the orebody 
beyond the predicted final pit boundaries. 
Ore mined as of 31 March 2010 amounted 
to 468,000 tonnes at a grade of 4.18 g/t of 
gold. Out of this amount, 212,000 tonnes 
with an average grade of 3.0 g/t of gold was 
not included in the original reserve estimations 
undertaken by SRK in 2006. In order to help 
clarify the situation, we enlisted the help of 
SGS Mineral Services and a re-modelling and 
geometallurgical study was commissioned 
to create a more accurate ore body model 
of the Gedabek deposit. 
In April 2010 initial results were received for 
Phase 1 of the Realistic Mineral Resources 
Model (a non JORC compliant report) which 
indicated significant increases in the overall 
quantities of gold, silver and copper from 
the original 2006 SRK resource estimate of 
702,000 oz of gold, 37,500 tonnes of copper 
and 6,100,000 oz of silver. 
On 7 June 2010, further structural geological 
information including topographic surveys 
and geological mapping and data became 
available and were included to calculate a 
JORC compliant resource report at Gedabek. 
In October 2010 we were delighted to 
announce a resource upgrade of 791,000 oz 
of gold, 49,300 tonnes of copper and 
7,597,000 oz of silver at cut-off grade of 
0.3 g/t gold for all categories, which, after 
taking account of ore already mined as of 
7 June 2010, which was excluded from 
the resource report, gave a total gold uplift 
across the Measured and Indicated resource 
categories of 31.2%.
Phase 2 of the resource development 
programme is now underway with a further 
6,000m diamond drilling programme 
completed at Gedabek within the boundaries 
of the existing pit, which aims to increase the 
confidence of the revised JORC compliant 
resource and will add valuable close spaced 
information for mine planning purposes. Results 
for the 6,000m of diamond drilling are due 
imminently and we will update the market 
accordingly on this development.
A further 17,500m of drilling is now underway 
concentrating on underground exploration, 
areas within close proximity to the mine, such 
as the Choplan discovery and the Maarif target 
area, as well as other targets within the Gedabek 
Contract Area. The work programme has been 
divided as follows:
E  7,500m to be drilled in an area that 
borders the existing mine and will 
concentrate on an area underground 
at a depth of 200 to 350m; 
E  3,000m of drilling at Cholpan, a highly 
prospective area in close proximity to 
the existing mine; and
E  7,000m of drilling at Maarif and other areas 
in the Gedabek Contract Area – in 2009 
3,000m of drilling was undertaken at 
Maarif which yielded encouraging results.
Gosha
The 300 sq km Gosha Contract Area is 
situated 50 km north-west of Gedabek and 
contains three prospects: Gosha, Itkirlan and 
Munduglu. After active exploration in 2010, 
which included 3,000m of drilling and 300m 
of adit and sampling work, we were pleased 
to announce in February 2011 that we had 
Ore stacking on heap leach pad Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2010
www.aamining.com 07
submitted a Notice of Discovery for Gosha. 
Following the issue of the Notice of Discovery, 
the Company has six months to submit a 
Development and Production Programme 
to the Government of Azerbaijan. 
Gosha has more than 6 km of exploration 
adits from the Soviet era and our 2010 work 
programme highlighted that one of its 
mineralisation zones, which was designated 
during Soviet times as ‘Zone 13’, has the 
potential to become a small narrow vein gold 
mining operation. In addition to this zone, there 
are several other vein type mineralisation zones. 
We are now planning to extend the adits at 
Gosha and implement a 1,500m underground 
diamond drilling programme to further explore 
the economic potential of this discovery. 
Ultimately, we aim to define new resources 
at Gosha and replicate our success at Gedabek 
with the development of an underground 
mining operation. 
Ordubad
The 462 sq km Ordubad Contract Area in the 
Nakhchivan region contains numerous targets 
including Shakardara, Piyazbashi, Misdag, 
Agyurt, Shalala, Daste Bashi and Diakchay, 
which are all located within a 5 km radius. 
A preliminary remote sensing study of the 
Ordubad Contract Area was conducted in 
2010 as well as adit cleaning and re-sampling 
of adits in two regions, Piyazbashi and Agyurt. 
Trenching and sampling was also undertaken 
in the Daste Bashi region. The Company believes 
that the Piyazbashi, Agyurt and Daste Bashi 
prospects warrant further exploration. The 
Company recently announced that the licence 
has been extended for another year through 
to April 2012.

Outlook
Looking ahead, we anticipate gold and copper 
production from Gedabek to continue to 
perform solidly, resulting in strong revenue 
generation when combined with a strong 
gold price, which will enable us to rapidly 
pay off our loans. Indeed, we are on target 
to hit our goal of being a debt-free, profitable 
gold producer by 2012 with a portfolio of 
highly prospective advanced projects that 
could also be developed into new revenue 
streams. I therefore believe that we are in 
a strong position to generate value for 
shareholders during the coming year and 
look forward to updating shareholders 
regularly on our progress.

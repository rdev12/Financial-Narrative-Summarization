The business began in the 1990s with online and 
subscription, and our first physical store followed in 2004. 
Our store roll-out plan is informed and supported by a 
database showing the buying patterns of our loyal multi-
channel customers. Our store formats range from 100 sq 
ft to 6,000 sq ft and trade profitably across the UK. We 
are also developing our international retail knowledge with 
three stores in Copenhagen.

The IPO in May 2016 represents just one milestone  
in a journey that began in 1997 with the launch of  
our first consumer facing website.
Our business model has evolved and grown by making natural extensions to our existing products and services, testing them and once 
proven investing in roll-out. There is significant growth headroom in the UK and we will continue to open new stores. Our current website 
is successful with digital revenues growing +20% in FY16, but there remains opportunity to add new features and services. We design and 
make our own chocolates; investing in manufacturing capacity and capability will allow us to keep pace with sales growth, improve product 
margins and develop innovative new products.

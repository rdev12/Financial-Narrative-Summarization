 •Establishment of our North American yellow school bus joint
venture, which successfully commenced operations in August 2010
•Disposal of the majority of our aviation services division
Our ground handling and cargo business is now classified as
discontinued and is excluded from the results discussed throughout this
report. Overall, revenue increased by £14.4m, or 0.7%, to £2,201.6m
(2009: £2,187.2m), consisting of £194.3m due to a change in access
charge regime subsidy and an underlying increase of £208.7m, or 9.5%.
Operating profit* was some £5m ahead of our expectations at
£102.0m, albeit £26.8m, or 20.8%, below last year’s strong result (2009:
£128.8m).Adjusted earnings per share* was 128.3p (2009: 161.6p),
basic earnings per share, including exceptional items and discontinued
operations, was 40.1p (2009: 14.7p) and profit attributable to members
was £17.2m (2009: £6.3m).
Dividends
We recognise that our dividend policy is a key part of the
investment decision for many shareholders. Maintaining the amount
of dividend per share through the economic cycle, including those
times when earnings may reduce, is a high priority for us and is
supported by the Group’s strong balance sheet and cash generation.
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 30.0p per share (2009:
55.5p) to maintain the total dividend for the year at 81.0p (2009:
81.0p), following a one-off change to the proportion of full year
dividend paid at the interim stage this year.The final dividend is
payable on 19 November 2010 to registered shareholders at the
close of business on 5 November 2010.
The Board of Directors and Governance
The Board of Go-Ahead continuously reviews the way in which the
Group is managed against best practice corporate governance.
Following such a review during the year, Rupert Pennant-Rea was
appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 30
October 2009. Katherine Innes Ker joined the Board as a Non-
Executive Director and a member of the Audit, Remuneration and
Nomination Committees on 9 July 2010.These two changes
demonstrate our commitment to good corporate governance and
full compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code
(published in June 2008).
In May 2010, the Financial Reporting Council issued a new edition
of the Combined Code, renamed the UK Corporate Governance
Code, which outlines a number of changes that are designed to
reinforce Board quality, focus on risk and improve accountability to
shareholders. The Board welcomes the new Code and although
not applicable to Go-Ahead until the financial year ending June

DIRECTORS’ REPORT:BUSINESS REVIEW
We have made good progress in delivering our strategy which leaves us well placed for the future.
Our bus and rail operations remain fundamentally strong and we look forward to working closely with
the new Government.
CHAIRMAN’S ST A TEMENT
Sir Patrick Brown, Chairman
We are pleased with the progress we have made this year in
challenging economic conditions. All of our bus and rail operations
have increased passenger revenue, highlighting the quality and value
for money of our services.
We have sold most of our aviation services division and started
our yellow school bus joint venture in North America.We have
also acquisitively grown our bus operations in the UK, leading to
more than one billion annual passenger journeys on our bus and
rail operations for the first time in our history.We are working
closely with the new Government and welcome its review of future
rail franchising announced in July 2010. In summary, we are in good
financial shape and continue to believe in the fundamental
strengths of public transport.
Business development and acquisitions
We made significant progress in delivering our Group strategy this
year, namely:
•Successful launch of the new Southern rail franchise
•Introduction of the UK’s first domestic high speed rail service
•Investment of over £35m in five UK bus acquisitions 5 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
2011, we are already considering and working towards
implementing the changes appropriate to our own corporate
governance arrangements as soon as possible. In particular, at the
forthcoming AGM, all Directors will be subject to annual election
by shareholders.
Corporate responsibility
As a public transport operator, corporate responsibility is integral
to the way we run our business and is a key part of the Group’s
strategy. Our responsibility is centred around five key areas: Safety,
Environment, Passengers, Employees and Community.The safety
and security of our passengers, our people and the general public is
an absolute priority for the Group and we continually strive to
improve our already high safety performance.
We are committed to improving the energy efficiency of our bus
and rail operations as this not only has important environmental
benefits, but also helps to reduce operating costs.This year we
launched our ‘Driving Energy Further’ campaign which sets out a
five year target to reduce our CO2 emissions per passenger
journey by 20% by 2015.Through investment, innovation and the
commitment of our employees we have made good progress this
year as we continue towards our target.
Employees
The number of employees in the Group averaged 22,570 for the
financial year, below last year’s 27,177, primarily due to the disposal
of the majority of our aviation services division. I would like to
thank our employees for their dedication and hard work through
these challenging economic conditions to ensure that we remain
a strong and successful Group.
Outlook
We have made good progress in delivering our strategy which
leaves us well placed for the future. Our bus and rail operations
remain fundamentally strong and we look forward to working with
the new Government.
However, we continue to be cautious on the near term prospects
for the UK economy and the outlook for the next financial year
remains difficult to predict, including any impact from the
Government’s Comprehensive Spending Review expected to be
announced in October 2010.

At this stage, we have not changed our outlook for the next financial
year since our trading update in June 2010, and are assuming that
the broad operating trends experienced in the second half of the
financial year ended 3 July 2010 continue throughout the next
financial year. In bus, we therefore expect lower fuel costs and a
small additional contribution from acquisitions to be partly offset by
the full year effect of lower operating profit* margins in London. In
rail, we expect a small reduction in operating profit* margin next
year compared to the financial year just ended.We will continue to
take management action accordingly, focusing on service quality,
cost control and financial discipline.
Our cashflow, balance sheet and financing are strong and the
maintenance of the dividend per share will remain a priority.We
have started the new financial year well and trading has been
in line with the Board’s expectations.

exploration
Our sustained investment in both greenfield and brownfield 
exploration is one of the core pillars of our strategy as our 
continued growth is conditional on the replenishment and 
further increase in our ore reserves and mineral resources. 
We continue to explore areas adjacent to our processing  
and potential hubs (brownfield exploration) in order to extend 
the life of mine of existing operations. at the same time, we 
maintain an active portfolio of greenfield exploration projects 
with the potential to become sizeable standalone operations. 
The advancement of each exploration project is subject  
to a rigorous review through pre-established project stages 
that are linked to our estimate of its resource potential  
and economic prospects. at any stage, a project may  
be terminated, suspended or moved to the next 
exploration stage.
Our key greenfield exploration targets for 2015 were: 
•	 continued exploration for platinum group metals (Pg M) 
deposits in the Karelia and ekaterinburg regions in order  
to establish new hard-rock Pg M resources sufficient  
for a standalone mining operation; and 
•	 exploration at key greenfield gold assets (including  
the newly acquired l ichkvaz (armenia) and Dolinnoye 
(Kazakhstan), n orth Kaluga and Tarutin (u rals).

Key greenfield projects 
Karelian pGM 
Our key Pg M asset, v iksha, is very well-positioned for 
establishing a large Pg M resource in Karelia, an accessible 
region with developed infrastructure. Currently, we are 
awaiting a conversion from exploration to mining licence  
at v iksha in 2016, which will allow us to publish the maiden 
JOr C resource estimate for the project and open up 
pathways to further project development. Our exploration 
programme in Karelia extends well beyond v iksha, involving 
a number of nearby licence areas. 
Dolinnoye (Kazakhstan)
at the Dolinnoye deposit, where Polymetal currently holds 
25% with a further earn-in option for additional 25%, we  
have conducted in-fill and step-out drilling. We are currently 
preparing the deposit for a pilot mining project with ore sold 
to a third party. 
Lichkvaz (Armenia) 
Polymetal acquired an initial 25% stake in l ichkvaz in  
april 2015. l ichkvaz is located in the Meghri area of the 
Syunik-Marz province of southern armenia, 380 km south  
of Yerevan. The infrastructure in the area is developed, with 
the availability of power, water, accommodation and a skilled 
labour force. a previous resource estimate (not JOr C 
compliant) put the total mineral endowment of the property  
at 2.4 Mt of material at 6.9 g/t in the inferred category for 
approximately 0.5 Moz of gold equivalent contained.
Following successful exploration drilling, performed during 
the surveying season in 2015, a decision was taken to 
increase the Company’s interest to 100%. Drilling has  
been completed, with 15.8 km drilled across 70 diamond  
drill holes. We plan to complete a resource estimate  
(JOr C compliant) for release in Q2 2016.

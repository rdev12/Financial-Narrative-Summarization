 Introduction
In a testing year, with reduced insurance claims
and a decrease in higher margin, light-damage
repair work, I am pleased to report that the
business has performed robustly. Nationwide
continues to generate high levels of cash and
profits and our dividends are comfortably
supported by earnings.  
I am especially encouraged by the recovery in 
the Group’s gross margins in the second half of
the year as the actions we took to manage the
downturn delivered the anticipated benefits.
Managing work flow efficiently through our
bodyshops is important in protecting gross
margins and our IT and integrated operations,
which include accident management call centres
and a mobile repair fleet alongside our national
network of bodyshops, are key to this. We aim to
lead our industry in service levels and customer
satisfaction and our focus on internal efficiency
also helps us to do this.  
The overall accident repair market is substantial
and, according to market analysts, generates five
million repair opportunities per year.  This equates
to a market spend in excess of £5 billion. As our
current market share is modest, the opportunity to
increase our market penetration remains exciting.
Currently, our core repair customers are motor
insurers and over the next three years, we aim to
broaden our customer base outside the insurance
marketplace, targeting consumers as well as fleet
operators. At the same time, we will continue to
develop our insurance relationships and to
capitalise on operational efficiencies.
Operations and Customer Relations
The accident repair market is mature and price
sensitive. Operating in such markets requires 
a methodical, measured approach to both
continuous business improvement and to
acquisitions. In 2009, as well as managing the 
downturn, our focus was on business
improvement and integrating previously acquired
sites. The six sites we acquired in 2008,
Scunthorpe, Gravesend, Redruth, Bristol, Kettering
and Perth, demonstrate the enhanced returns that
can be generated by the Nationwide model. In
2008, these sites incurred aggregate losses of
£230,000; by contrast, in 2009, the same sites
cumulatively contributed £273,000 to Group
profits. This process of looking for ‘continuous
improvement in performance’ is a key part of 
our culture and across our network of over 70
bodyshops, we see significant scope to continue
to raise performance levels to the benefit of both
customers and the business.
Our Operational Team focuses on delivering our
customers:-  
� Quality    � Value    � Speed    � Service
Our 2009 Customer Satisfaction Survey, which
contacts approximately 17,000 customers annually,
shows that the overall satisfaction of our customers
has increased to a record 87%, from 85% last year.
The same customers rated the “quality of the
repair” at 93%, reinforcing our confidence that we
deliver in this important area. The integrity of our
vehicle repairs is important to all of our customers
and to support this, in 2009, we took the decision
to implement, where appropriate, the industry’s
recently adopted British Standards Institution
Kitemark Standard (PAS 125). This standard allows
us to verify and demonstrate independently the
integrity of our repairs and equipment, the quality
of components used and the skill and competence
of our team. At the time of writing, out of a total
of 637 approved sites in the UK, 66 are Nationwide
bodyshops, representing some 10% of the total.
Value remains more difficult to quantify.  Insurance
companies are, by nature, price sensitive and our
ability to offer value remains a key factor in our
continued success. The 2009 account renewals

Chief Executive and wins suggest that we continue to offer value
and the recently released average repair cost data
confirms that we remain competitive.
The speed and the efficiency with which we repair
our customers’ vehicles is important to both car
owners who naturally want their vehicle repaired
and returned speedily and to insurers who can
often mitigate claim costs by rapid settlement and
repair. Our “cycle time” (key to key) measures the
time taken to complete a repair, from the day we
receive a vehicle on site to the day it is returned to
the customer. In 2009, this cycle time increased
marginally, from 12.5 days in 2008 to 12.7 days.
This increase is partially attributable to the slightly
larger types of repair we carried out in the period
but remains an area we can further improve.  
We believe that our planned expansion of our
currently small Mobile Restore operation (enabling
off-site repairs at customers’ premises), will assist
in the achievement of this objective, as will the
planned operational improvements at our sites.  
Offering a high level of customer service remains
at the heart of our offer and a key focus for us all.
The average satisfaction level confirms that we
continue to improve in this area. It remains our
objective to be a trusted and reliable provider of
automotive related services whether it be to
insurers, fleet operators or retail consumers.  
2009 also saw the continued development of our
Fast Fit+ offer, which provides MOTs and other “bolt
on” services, such as exhausts and tyres. Currently,
Fast Fit+ is being offered on a pilot basis at two of
our sites, at Kettering and Leicester. The move has
given us significant market knowledge and it
remains a potential area for further expansion.
Our national network of 71 wholly-owned
operational sites, linked by a single IT platform,
offers us unique capability in a highly fragmented
marketplace. This industry leading capability 
continues to prove attractive to existing and new
customers. As a result, 2009 saw the renewal and
expansion of our relationship with RSA as well as
new contracts with Equity Light Commercial
Vehicles, Broker Direct, Newline Insurance and BSM.
Network Services
Network Services provides our national network of
sites with important support. Key to this support is
its accident management service, which captures
new repair business for us and, critically, also enables
us to deploy repair work across our bodyshops in an
efficient manner. Our ability to direct work flow into
our national branch network continues to offer us
considerable market advantage.
Network Services also manages our Mobile Restore
and Mobile Solutions operations. Mobile Restore
currently operates a small fleet of vans which are
able to complete certain kinds of repair work ‘off-
site’ at customers’ premises or other preferred
locations. Typically this repair work comprises light
cosmetic damage, such as scratches, dents and
scuffs. We have now finalised our three year growth
plans for this business and will be launching a
‘business-to-consumer offer’, branded as ‘mobile
restore’ in the early summer. This business is
targeting, in particular, the ‘retail’ market, which 
we broadly define as those repairs not paid for by
insurers.  The retail market is estimated at £540
million and is currently growing, partly as a result of
increased excesses passed on by insurers. In 2009,
our retail sales generated £5 million of revenues and
the major part of this was achieved “on-site” i.e. at
our bodyshops. We are very confident that the
scope for us to increase our penetration of the retail
market through our ‘Mobile Restore’ operations and
our bodyshop network is significant.  
Our Mobile Solutions operations focus on glass,
electronic and air-conditioning related repairs,
which require specialist equipment and skills.

Originally established as a shared resource for
our bodyshops, this unit has potential for
growth and we have established a three year
plan for the business. As part of our growth
strategy, we have refined and enhanced its
offer and in the early summer, we will be re-
branding and launching it as ‘motorglass’.
Leading the development of both ‘mobile
restore’ and ’motorglass’ will be Steve
Thompson, one of our Executive Directors. We
will be strengthening our operational team to
support the growth plans of both businesses.
Looking Ahead
Nationwide has a sound balance sheet and its
model is highly cash generative.
Our unique operating platform gives us
considerable advantages in a market in which
we can significantly increase our penetration.
In the medium term, our objectives are:-
� to continue to improve our operations, 
increasing our ability to offer value, service, 
quality and speed to the benefit of our 
customers and our shareholders;
� to increase our share in the motor insurance 
company repair market and
� to identify and secure additional, and for us, 
largely new market opportunities in the fleet 
and retail market.
We are assuming that the economy will remain
challenging but are confident that the Group is
well placed for medium term growth.

Comment High returns achieved representing a signiﬁcant 
improvement in performance against the 
previous year. This performance reﬂects both 
good management to ensure increases in ﬁxed 
and variable costs do not overtake revenue 
growth, and the quality of acquisitions.
High returns maintained in excess of our 
long-term Weighted Average Cost of Capital 
(WACC) of 8.5% (2010: 8.5%).
Earnings increased faster than our asset base 
due to good operational management and 
acquisitions at sensible values.
201 1/12 target We aim to achieve a Return on Sales within the 
18% to 22% range whilst continuing to deliver 
proﬁt growth. 
The target of 12% was set in 2005 when the 
Group’s ROTIC was 12.1% and WACC was 
7.9%. A range of 12% to 14% is considered 
representative of the Board’s expectations 
over the long term.

Generating sufﬁciently high levels of cash 
provides the Group with freedom to pursue its 
strategic goals of organic growth, acquisitions 
and progressive dividends without becoming 
highly-leveraged.

Target >100%
Performance 108%
Very high returns above the target level achieved. 
The signiﬁcant increase in recent years is due to 
concerted efforts to improve proﬁtability and 
improve efﬁciency in our operations.
Cash conversion of 108% was above the target, 
an excellent performance across the Group. 
The target of >45% is set in order to ensure the 
efﬁcient generation of cash at all levels to fund 
organic growth, closely targeted acquisitions 
and sustained dividend growth without Halma 
becoming a highly-leveraged group. 
The goal of cash inﬂow exceeding 100% is a 
metric that has relevance at all levels of the 
organisation and aligns management action 
with the strategic goals of organic growth, 
acquisitions and progressive dividends.

 proﬁt increased by 21% to 
£104.6m (2010: £86.2m), including strong 
underlying organic growth of 19%, and a 2% 
contribution from recent acquisitions. 
There was a minimal (<1%) positive impact 
on proﬁt and revenue growth due to 
currency exchange rate movements.
Revenue grew 13% to £518m (2010: £459m). 
Organic growth of 11% underlined the fact 
that our continued investment in 
management development, innovation and 
emerging markets is enabling us to achieve 
and sustain higher rates of growth. 
Acquisitions contributed 2% to growth.
Cash generation and operational 
management were excellent across the 
Group. We ended the year in a strong 
ﬁnancial position with net debt of £37m 
(2010: £9m net cash) after having spent 
£82m (2010: £2m) on acquisitions and 
paying a total of £33m (2010: £30m) to 
shareholders in dividends. We have core 
borrowing facilities of £165m in place until 
2013 and therefore have the capital 
resources available for further acquisitions 
in 2011/12, should we ﬁnd the right 
opportunities.
After a strong ﬁrst half year it was 
encouraging to see order intake growth 
momentum maintained throughout the 
second half, continuing to run slightly 
ahead of revenue, giving us a positive 
start to 2011/12.
Halma’s sustained high level of performance 
over the past four decades has been 
achieved through the commitment, 
innovation and excellence of our employees. 
However, I believe their achievements 
during the recent ﬁnancial downturn have 
been outstanding. I would like to thank all 
Halma employees for both their contribution 
to these successes and in ensuring that we 
are well placed to achieve even greater 
things in the future.
Record results and increased strategic investment
Halma has had a terriﬁc year , achieving strong organic growth and 
adding greater product and market strength to our existing business 
sectors through acquisitions. We are creating value for customers and 
shareholders in the short term, yet we are also increasing investment 
for growth in the future. We have a proven product, market and operational 
strategy which adapts as technology and mark et needs change.

Higher rates of return
Return on Sales
1
 increased to 20.2% 
(2010: 18.8%) reﬂecting excellent operational 
management across the Group, an 
impressive recovery in Industrial Safety and 
the increasing proportion of our revenue 
coming from the Health and Analysis sector. 
Our strategic objective is to operate in the 
18% to 22% range for Return on Sales and 
recent acquisitions support this goal.
All Halma companies are incentivised to 
deliver both proﬁt growth and high return 
on capital. This year, the average Return 
on Capital Employed
1
 of our operating 
companies increased to 71.9% (2010: 61.3%) 
demonstrating the strength of our 
operational management and the beneﬁts 
of decentralised, light-assembly 
manufacturing operations.
The combination of strong earnings growth, 
effective operational management and 
paying sensible prices for acquisitions 
resulted in Halma’s post-tax Return on 
Total Invested Capital improving to 15.5% 
(2010: 13.6%).
Growth in all regions and sectors
Revenue from the USA increased by 18% to 
£150m (2010: £127m) and Europe was up by 
2% to £138m (2010: £136m). We achieved 8% 
growth in the UK, which now represents just 
20% of total revenue at £106m (2010: £98m).
Revenue from outside our largest markets 
in Europe and the USA increased by 26% to 
£124m (2010: £98m), contributing 24% of the 
Group’s total. The strongest performance 
came from the Far East and Australasia 
region, which increased by 29%. China grew 
by 28% to £23.6m (2010: £18.4m).
Health and Analysis is now Halma’s 
largest sector
Health and Analysis performed strongly to 
become our largest sector. Revenue was up 
by 23% to £218m (2010: £178m) whilst proﬁt
2
 
was 33% higher at £46m (2010: £35m), 
representing 42% of the Group. All four 
sub-sectors increased revenue and proﬁt. 
Growth was stronger in the USA and UK 
than Mainland Europe, with revenue outside 
these core territories increasing by 34% to 
£53m (2010: £40m). Here Photonics, Fluid 
Technology and Health Optics made the 
major contributions whilst Water made 
greater progress in the developed countries. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Infrastructure Sensors made 
good progress
Our Infrastructure Sensor sector has 
continued to increase proﬁt throughout the 
downturn with demand largely driven by 
safety regulation globally and increasing 
urbanisation of population in developing 
countries. This year revenue was up by 8% 
to £197m (2010: £183m) whilst proﬁt
2
 grew 
by 10% to £39m (2010: £36m). Steady growth 
was achieved in the UK, USA and Mainland 
Europe with an encouraging 20% increase 
from outside these three regions. All four 
sub-sectors increased revenue and proﬁt. 
Elevator Safety and Door Sensors 
performed very well in the Far East and 
Australasia whilst our Security business 
made good progress in all regions, most 
notably in South Africa. Fire Detection had 
a positive year, especially in the USA.
Industrial Safety achieved high proﬁt 
growth and Return on Sales
Industrial Safety maintained the positive 
momentum it had coming into the year to 
deliver an excellent performance. Revenue 
improved by 5% to £103m (2010: £98m) 
whilst proﬁt
2
 grew by 20% to £25m (2010: 
£20m) giving a Return on Sales of 24%, 
the highest of our three sectors. All four 
sub-sectors increased proﬁt whilst all, 
except Safety Interlocks, grew revenue. 
Revenue grew steadily in the UK and USA. 
In Mainland Europe, there was a slight 
decline in revenue due to the non-repeat 
of a major order for Safety Interlocks 
last year although this was more than 
compensated for by 34% growth in the 
Far East and Australasia.
Clear strategic priorities
We aim to operate in global specialised 
markets offering long-term growth and 
establish strong market positions with 
products and technology that can sustain 
high returns. Our strategic priorities guide 
our activities and resource allocation at both 
a corporate and subsidiary company level 
ensuring a balance between organic and 
acquisition led growth in the medium term.
Organic growth
We aim to continue to deliver organic 
growth above the blended medium-term 
growth rates of our end markets, which 
we believe to be at least 5%. Over the past 
ﬁve years, the average of our annual organic 
growth rates has been 8% per annum 
(revenue) and 10% per annum (proﬁt) 
reﬂecting our ability to consistently 
outperform our markets by building 
sustainable competitive advantage through 
our products and customer service.
International expansion with a focus on Asia
Our strategic objective is for at least 30% of 
revenue to come from outside the UK, USA 
and Mainland Europe by 2015 (2011: 24%) 
and, by that time, for China to be 10% of the 
Group total (2011: 4.5%).
Since 2006, we have made a series of 
strategic central investments in China and 
India to accelerate the rate at which Halma 
subsidiaries can establish a local presence 
to design, sell and manufacture their 
products in these faster growth economies.
In the past year, we opened three new 
regional ofﬁces in China (Guangzhou, 
Chengdu and Shenyang), expanded our 
Door Sensor manufacturing facilities and 
acquired the assets of a Beijing based 
business to give us a local manufacturing 
base for our Fire Detection products.
In India, 10 companies now have a direct 
presence in our Halma hub in Mumbai 
compared with ﬁve at the start of the year. 
During the past year, revenue from India 
grew by 32% to £6.4m.
More Halma companies are investigating 
establishing a direct presence in South 
America. In the coming year, we will 
determine whether any central investment 
is appropriate to accelerate this process.
High rate of innovation
Product and process innovation enables us 
to build competitive advantage, gain market 
share and sustain high ﬁnancial returns. 
All Halma businesses measure the direct 
contribution of major innovations in their 
business each month and increasingly are 
collaborating more with each other to share 
best practice or ﬁnd new solutions to 
technical and operational problems. In May 
2011, we held our second Halma Innovation 
and Technology Exposition in Orlando, 
Florida. The focal point of HITE is a two-day 
exhibition where every Halma company 
exhibits transferrable technology and 
processes to each other. This ability to 
transfer state of the art technology from one 
sector to another is something most of our 
competitors simply don’t have.
Innovation excellence in Halma is recognised 
through the monthly Eureka award and the 
Halma Annual Innovation Award. Both are 
open to all employees, and award a top prize 
of £1,000 and £20,000 respectively.
The Halma Annual Innovation Award for 
2011 was won by an employee from Ocean 
Optics who developed a new way of testing 
products, resulting in superior product 
quality, faster lead times for customers 
and a £400,000 annual cost saving for the 
company. The runners-up included the 
Ricochet wireless security sensor system 
from Texecom and the Memcom elevator 
emergency telephone from Memco.
R&D expenditure in 2010/11 increased 
by 20% to £26m (2010: £21m), equivalent 
to 5% of revenue and well above our 
minimum spend target of 4% of revenue. 
R&D investment is greater in our higher 
technology businesses where the execution 
risk on new product development is higher 
too. In response to this challenge, we 
have established a training programme 
for our technical engineers called Halma 
Certiﬁcate in Applied Technology (HCAT). 
HCAT provides engineers with training 
in ﬁnance and project management as 
well as providing them with the opportunity 
to visit and network across other 
Halma companies.
Management development
Halma’s decentralised operating structure 
relies on local managers making good, 
timely decisions in the best interests of their 
business. R&D, manufacturing, sales and 
administrative resources are controlled 
locally where the intimate knowledge of 
market dynamics and customer needs 
resides. Strategic objectives, annual 
performance, goals and management 
incentives are aligned together with a real 
commitment to attract and develop high 
quality talent at all levels.
Halma offers a range of training 
programmes for employees including the 
Halma Executive Development Programme 
(HEDP), Halma Management Development 
Programme (HMDP) and Halma Certiﬁcate 
in Applied Technology (HCAT). During 
2010/11, over 130 employees attended these 
Halma-run programmes and many more 
beneﬁted from training provided by their 
subsidiary company. The value of this 
investment is shown both in our excellent

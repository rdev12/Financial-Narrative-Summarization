 Generating growth  
through...
Ilika’s unique process is far 
quicker and more efficient 
than traditional materials 
discovery processes.
Ilika uses high throughput, 
or combinatorial, techniques 
which involve the rapid 
synthesis of a large number 
of different structurally 
related materials in a few 
automated steps.
High throughput materials 
discovery
What we do
High throughput materials discovery:
•  10–100x faster and more reliable than 
traditional discovery methods
•  Creates output equivalent to 100s  
of individual materials
• Unique patent-protected platform
•  Rapid identiﬁcation of materials  
suitable for industrial scale-up
Combinatorial synthesis
Ilika’s High Throughput Physical Vapour Deposition 
facility (‘HT -PVD’) can deposit large numbers of 
films of different composition in one automated 
experimental run. The deposition of all elements 
occurs simultaneously and the composition profile 
can be carefully varied across the substrate in a 
controlled manner. 
Characterisation/screening
Large numbers of samples are screened and 
characterised using automated, high throughput 
techniques. Unique sample arrays allow the many 
different compositions synthesised to be analysed 
in a rapid manner for specific, sought-after, 
behaviours.
Infomatics
A range of specialised, in-house software 
controls the instrumentation associated with 
our workflows and also enables the rapid, 
simultaneous collection of large datasets which 
are then processed, analysed and presented 
so that meaningful conclusions about material 
properties can be drawn.
Business review
02  Ilika plc  Annual report 2012
 Ilika at a glance Ilika can cover a wide range of different 
market applications within the energy 
sector to help customers advance their 
materials discovery programmes. The 
great breadth and large numbers of 
samples that can be synthesised and 
screened with respect to an identified 
capability means that Ilika can optimise 
materials in a much shorter timeframe. 
For hydrogen storage applications, 
different compositions can be 
characterised with respect to their 
hydrogen adsorption and desorption 
behaviours including their hydrogen 
storage capacity and cyclability.  
For fuel cell and battery applications, 
the candidate materials can be 
measured for catalytic activity. For 
the photovoltaic market it is possible 
to screen materials for greater energy 
conversion efficiency.
Energy
We are developing innovative new materials for lithium-
ion batteries, developing high capacity hydrogen storage 
materials, developing cheaper alternatives to platinum 
electrodes for use in fuel cells, and carrying out in-house 
research on film photovoltaic solar cells.
We cover a wide range of different 
market applications within the 
electronics sector to help customers 
advance their materials discovery 
programmes. The fast throughput 
approach to materials synthesis 
coupled with high throughput 
characterisation and screening means 
that Ilika can optimise materials with 
respect to a desired property in a 
much shorter timeframe. For phase 
change memory applications, we can 
monitor the phase change behaviour 
of different alloys such as GeSbTe as 
a function of temperature. The optical 
and electrical behaviours of interesting 
compositions can then be studied in 
more detail.
Electronics
We are developing lead-free piezoelectric materials 
and phase change memory materials for high capacity 
memory chips.
Ilika has developed an extensive library 
of bio-functional materials specifically 
designed to promote or deter cell 
binding, enrich specific cell types from 
diverse populations and promote cell 
growth on tailored surfaces. We are 
working together with medical device 
companies to create valuable products 
through the application of cell-specific 
functional coatings optimised using 
our high throughput techniques. 
Application areas include:
•  Skin Wound Care
•   Cell Replacement for Organ 
Regeneration
•  Implants 
•  Diagnostic Devices 
•  Cell Purification
Biomedical
We are developing polymers to enable the filtering of 
somatic stem cells from blood, have been selling our 
Cryoskin
®
 and Myskin
®
 products for the treatment of 
burns and wounds in the UK and intend to commence 
clinical trials of our corneal bandage candidate.

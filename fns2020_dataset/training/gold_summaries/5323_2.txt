Reasons to invest
Well-established 
global market leader
Growing markets
Structural growth 
opportunity
Ambitious targets
Our two well-established 
brands, RS Components 
(RS) and Allied Electronics 
(Allied), have existed for 
more than 75 years and 
have grown to produce 
a Group that is a global 
leader in its marketplace, 
covering around 90% of 
the world’s GDP .
The markets we operate 
in grow faster than GDP 
on average. This is driven 
by electronic components 
demand, which grows at 
around twice GDP through 
the business cycle, with 
continued innovation 
increasing the proliferation 
of electronic components 
in everyday life.
The marketplace we 
operate in is highly 
fragmented, with 
numerous smaller 
competitors. There are 
clear benefits to being a 
large, global competitor 
in this marketplace, 
meaning we are well 
placed to take a greater 
share of this fast-growing 
market over time.
We have raised our 
growth ambitions for 
the Group. We expect 
that the execution of our 
global strategy will deliver 
market share gains in our 
international markets, 
leading to higher sales 
growth and improved 
financial performance 
over the medium-term.

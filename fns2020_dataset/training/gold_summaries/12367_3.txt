•	greenfield exploration for new precious metals deposits with 
a potential resource base which would be sufficient in grade 
and size to justify the construction of a standalone mine; and
•	 exploration for platinum group metals (PGM) in the 
Ekaterinburg and Karelia regions in order to establish  
new hard-rock PGM resources.

In 2013, despite a significant decline in gold and silver prices, 
we continued to invest in exploration with total metres drilled 
increasing 72% year-on-year to 194.9 km. Total capital 
expenditure on exploration declined by 13% to US$59 million, 
mostly due to a decrease in the unit costs of drilling and  
a reduction in early-stage activities such as trenching.
We have made solid progress on all key advanced  
greenfield and brownfield exploration projects. As a result, 
material additions to ore reserves are expected in 2014  
at Svetloye (Q2), Albazino (Q4) and Kutyn (Q4), with further 
likely additions at near-mine properties at Omolon and Voro.

  Mineral resources and ore reserves are reported in accordance with the JORC Code 
(2012). Mineral resources are in addition to ore reserves. Discrepancies in calculations  
are due to rounding.
Production
For the second consecutive year, and despite commodity  
price fluctuations, we have exceeded the original guidance, 
achieving 1.28 Moz of gold equivalent production in 2013. 
Dukat, Mayskoye and Albazino/Amursk were the key 
contributors to this growth. Voro and Varvara demonstrated 
resilient performance. Production decline at Khakanja was  
a result of scheduled grade decline and the decrease at 
Omolon was a result of expected average grade decline  
in ore from Sopka.
In 2013, Polymetal continued to reflect seasonality in its 
production profile. Production dynamics on a quarterly  
basis are shown in the graph below. The strength of the 
second and the third quarters of the year was driven by:
•	 shipment of concentrates from Mayskoye and Albazino 
during the navigation period;
•	ore transportation at Omolon (trucking of ore from  
Sopka by winter road in the first quarter, processing  
in the second and third quarter); and
•	seasonal heap leaching operation at Voro.
In 2014, with the full volume of Albazino concentrate  
to be processed at the Amursk POX, the level of seasonality  
is expected to reduce. However seasonal navigation  
at Mayskoye and seasonal high-grade ore processing  
at Omolon will continue to influence the production profile,  
with peak production expected in the third quarter.

In 2013, Polymetal decreased its ore reserves by 12%  
to 13.3 Moz of gold equivalent while mineral resources 
(additional to ore reserves) declined by 11%. These reductions 
were driven mostly by more stringent economic evaluation,  
using the same prices of US$1,300/oz gold and US$22.5/oz 
silver for both reserves and resources.
The key material additions to ore reserves were due to 
resource-to-reserve conversion at Oroch (241 Koz of gold 
equivalent) and acquisition and subsequent revaluation  
of Maminskoye (913 Koz of gold equivalent). Decreases  
in ore reserves, in addition to regular depletion (1,517 Koz), 
resulted mostly from the response to changes in mine plans 
and were mainly comprised of the following:
•	 re-optimisation of open pits at Birkachan and Sopka;
•	 exclusion of remote ore zones and ore bodies requiring 
significant additional investment in access at Dukat; and
•	 indefinite postponement of underground mining at Khakanja 
due to adverse assessment of geotechnical conditions.
Mineral resources decreased, mostly as a function  
of the lower gold price used in the year-end estimates 
(US$1,300/oz in 2013 vs US$1,500/oz in 2012).
Average ore reserve grade remains high at 3.7 g/t GE,  
a decline of 7% compared with 2012, while average mineral 
resource grade increased by 14% to 3.7 g/t as a result  
of lower-quality resources being excluded from the estimate.
Acquisitions remain an important pillar of our strategy
We believe that the current weakness in precious metal  
prices represents both a challenge and an opportunity.  
Growth through synergistic, value-driven M&A has always 
been an integral part of our strategy. In 2013, apart from  
the acquisition of Maminskoye, we undertook no major 
transactions. However, we are still keen to investigate potential 
acquisition opportunities, and have both the financial and 
operational flexibility to respond should such opportunities 
arise. In our acquisition strategy, we remain focused on 
high-quality development stage assets, with high-quality 
resources/reserves and long mine life to justify the construction 
of a standalone mine at current commodity price levels.
Metal sales in 2013 were 1,295 Koz of gold equivalent,
1
  
and grew by 19% compared to 2012. Sales volumes  
slightly exceeded production for the full year.
While most of the sales are comprised of refined metals,  
we continue to sell concentrates from Dukat (gold-silver), 
Varvara (gold-copper) to off-takers in Kazakhstan, Japan, 
South Korea and China. For Dukat and Varvara, the off-take 
allows us to maximise margins compared to in-house 
processing of these materials. During 2013, we diversified  
the off-taker base considerably in order to achieve an optimal 
combination of transportation costs and treatment charges/
recoveries. Off-take diversification is also an important element 
of Polymetal’s strategy aimed at strengthening our commercial 
independence from key customers. 
Due to the temporary setback in the ramp-up schedule for the 
Amursk POX plant and in order to avoid build-up of excessive 
concentrate stockpiles, we resumed concentrate sales from 
Albazino in the second and third quarters of 2013. Sales to 
off-takers in China during 2013 increased by 25% year-on-year 
and comprised 79 Koz. This has now been fully completed, 
with no further off-take required from 2014. 
Shortly after the start-up of the Mayskoye concentrator  
in April 2013, Polymetal signed two export sales contracts  
with Chinese off-takers for refractory gold concentrate 
produced at Mayskoye. A total of 30 Kt of concentrate  
with 48 Koz of payable gold was shipped to off-takers  
during the navigation period in 2013.
Exploration
Polymetal’s exploration activities are focused in five regions  
of Russia – Khabarovsk, Magadan, Chukotka, Karelia and 
Ekaterinburg – as well as in Kazakhstan. Polymetal currently 
has 54 licences for geological studies and gold, silver and 
copper exploration and mining, and one coal mining licence. 
Our current exploration portfolio includes 40 licences  
with a total area of approximately 10,240 km
2
. Of these,  
our exploration activities in 2013 covered 28 licence areas, 
including 20 areas in the scoping stage and eight areas  
in the advanced exploration stage.
Our exploration targets for 2013 included:
•	ongoing brownfield exploration activities aimed  
at extending mine lives at our existing operations:  
Khakanja (with the shortest current mine life), Dukat,  
Omolon, Varvara, and Voro;
•	continued exploration activities at Albazino (including 
underground drift, geotechnical studies and in-fill drilling)  
with a view to converting the newly discovered resources  
to reserves and preparing the Albazino expansion project  
for the development decision; 
•	 advanced exploration activities and preparation for  
resource/reserve estimates and development decisions  
at key greenfield projects (Svetloye, Kutyn and Maminskoye)  
which may form the next generation of our growth assets;

Outlook for 2014
The key operational focus in 2014 will be to deliver a full  
year of robust performance at two of our newest plants – 
Mayskoye and Amursk POX – and sustain robust operating 
performances at the Dukat hub and other mature mines.  
In doing so, we expect to achieve a production level  
of 1.3 Moz of gold equivalent, which will be further improved  
to 1.35 Moz in 2015 and 1.4 Moz in 2016, based on the  
current asset base.
Operations
Achieving our targets at Mayskoye will be key to delivering  
on this guidance. This will include trial processing of concentrate 
from Mayskoye at the Amursk POX plant in the first quarter  
and negotiation of the potential terms of long-term off-take.  
The split between own-processing at the POX plant and 
off-take sales will be driven partially by the relative economics 
of each of these routes and partially by the prospects  
of an Albazino expansion, which, if undertaken, will require 
additional POX capacity.
At the Amursk POX plant, the key objective is to deliver a full 
year of sustainable performance and further optimise it in terms  
of costs. Another important goal is to deliver a robust recovery 
and cost profile on the processing of Mayskoye concentrate. 
While the past year was challenging in terms of the POX plant 
performance, we believe that the internal expertise gained  
as a result of the ramp-up process will enable us to deliver 
both of these targets successfully.
Our operational objectives for other existing mines are:
•	 further de-bottlenecking at the Dukat hub underground  
mines and achieving total throughput of 2 Mtpa;
•	commencement of stoping at the Avlayakan underground 
mine and achieving an increase in the amounts of ore  
mined and shipped to Khakanja;
•	 increasing volumes of ore mined at Varvara after completion 
of the pushback and pit optimisation;
•	 a further increase in the amounts of ore trucking by winter 
road at the Omolon hub from Sopka and Dalneye; 
•	commencement of ore leaching at Birkachan heap leach 
facility (Omolon hub); and
•	an increased focus on enforcement of health and safety rules 
and risk management, with particular attention to key risk 
areas and rollout of our systems to suppliers and contractors.
Barring any further deterioration of commodity prices, we are 
also set to advance the development decisions for the third 
generation of growth assets, including potential expansion  
at Albazino and development of Svetloye in the second half  
of the year. In 2015 we will also consider development 
decisions for our Kutyn and Maminskoye projects.
Exploration
In 2014, our exploration activities will be focused on:
•	continued resource-to-reserve conversions and resource 
category updates at our advanced standalone exploration 
targets and brownfield targets through in-fill drilling;
•	 additional drilling at the flanks of Ozerny and Avlayakan  
with a view to extend life-of-mine at Khakanja;
•	further increase of resource potential at Albazino through 
additional underground development and drilling in the  
Olga zone, in-fill drilling in the Ekaterina-1 and Ekaterina-2 
zones, and additional step-out drilling at the flanks of the 
Albazino field;
•	completion of a resource estimate at Burgali and continued 
exploration at the other brownfield targets in the Omolon  
hub area;
•	 in-fill drilling and finalisation of resource estimates  
at Olcha with preparation for open-pit mining and  
exploration for new ore bodies in the area;
•	 continued exploration at the two key greenfield targets  
of Kutyn and Svetloye, followed by resource estimates  
and preparation of oxidised ores for open-pit mining;
•	 continued scoping and exploration at the Elmus and Semcha 
areas in Karelia, with a view to developing a new standalone 
gold/PGM asset in the region; and
•	 preparation of Maminskoye resources for open-pit mining 
and step-out drilling at the flanks of the deposit.
Our focus on exploration is a conscious strategic preference  
in the current market environment. With a high-quality portfolio 
of operating assets, we continue to generate robust operating 
results and healthy cash flows at lower commodity prices.  
We would, therefore, like to be fully prepared for the next  
stage of the commodity cycle by developing a new generation 
of Polymetal’s assets, both from reserve additions from 
exploration and from potential acquisition opportunities.  
The year ahead will be important for progressing both routes.
For the second year in a row, Dukat takes the lead among our 
mature mines in terms of both production growth and robust 
cost performance. Silver production in 2013 was 22.1 Moz,  
up 15% year-on-year, and was further supported by 
improvements in average grades at the Dukat and Goltsovoye 
mines and increased recovery rates. Despite the full switch  
to underground mining, the Dukat hub achieved a further 
reduction in total cash costs of 5% to US$11.6/silver  
equivalent oz. 
2013 highlights
Mining
In 2013, underground development at Dukat increased by 26% 
year-on-year to 30.7 km, with more than 1.25 Mt of ore mined 
from underground, and average silver grade in ore mined 
increasing by 9% to 423 g/t. This compensated for the 6% 
decrease in the total amount of ore mined after the completion 
of open-pit mining. Within the mine, we commenced 
development of the Eastern zone and further improved  
dilution levels by fine-tuning the parameters of blasting  
and drilling works. 
At Goltsovoye, following a significant amount of development  
in 2012, ore mined nearly doubled year-on-year to 168 Kt,  
and the average grades increased by 14% to 624 g/t silver, 
contributing to the increased grades in the Omsukchan 
concentrator feedstock. Underground development continued 
to accelerate and comprised 7.1 km in 2013, a 35% increase. 
The successful implementation of the drift-and-fill mining 
method has contributed to a significant reduction in dilution 
and improved average grades in ore mined.
At Arylakh, volumes of stripping and ore mined from open pit 
continued to decline due to depletion while being substituted 
by higher grade ore from underground. At Lunnoye works 
progressed steadily across ore zones 7 and 9 in accordance 
with the mine plan. Total ore mined increased by 7% year-on-
year to 394 Kt, although there was a slight decrease in average 
silver grade to 367 g/t due to the depletion of the open pit  
at Arylakh.
Processing
The amount of ore processed at the main Omsukchan 
concentrator grew by 9% year-on-year and comprised 1.57 Mt, 
with a further increase to 1.6 Mt expected in 2014 as a result  
of de-bottlenecking and increased capacity of the underground 
Dukat mine. Average grades processed followed the positive 
dynamics at Dukat and Goltsovoye mine, with the silver grade 
processed increasing to 425 g/t (+6% year-on-year). The 
average recoveries also trended up by 3% for gold and 2%  
for silver to 83.7% and 86.3% respectively. As a result, silver 
production grew by 18% year-on-year to 18.3 Moz, of which 
the majority was sold to third-party off-takers.
The new SAG mill was successfully commissioned at Lunnoye 
plant, which now has the capacity to process 400 Kt of ore  
per annum. Additional feed will come from existing stockpiles 
and potentially from the new satellite mine at Olcha in 2015.  
In 2013, the amount of ore processed was up 1% at 338 Kt 
and, despite some grade decline in the ore feed (see above), 
silver production was up 2% at 3.8 Moz due to increased 
recoveries which comprised 89.3% for silver.

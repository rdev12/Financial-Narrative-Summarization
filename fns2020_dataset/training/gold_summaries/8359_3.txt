 While economic headwinds have been 
tougher and more enduring than most  
of us expected, I am encouraged by  
the progress we have made in delivering 
our strategy. In addition to achieving 
strong organic growth in mixed 
economic conditions, we realised 
significant latent value from our PFI 
portfolio and started to invest this  
cash in growth markets, new sectors 
and strengthening the funding position 
of the pension scheme.
In line with our growth strategy, we 
continued to expand our frontline 
services capability though the 
acquisition of a welfare-to-work business 
in May, a home healthcare business in 
December and in January 2013 a Middle 
East oil and gas services provider. 
Organically we have invested in new 
territories through our Equipment 
Services division and new markets 
for the Construction division, such as 
energy from waste, as well as creating 
a new Justice business unit. Justice 
remains an important market for us 
and while the appointment of a new 
Secretary of State for Justice in 2012 
signalled a short-term delay in the 
outsourcing programme, there are clear 
indications this will lead to accelerated 
outsourcing activity in the medium 
term from which we expect to see 
opportunities emerging in 2013.
The breadth and scope of our operations 
is of significant benefit to the business. 
Our Support Services business has grown 
strongly, as the trend towards increased

8504 Interserve AR 2013 Chairmans Statement_5 CS5_5 tp.indd   2 19/03/2013   15:41 outsourcing in the UK accelerates and 
opportunities emerge in the oil and gas 
sector internationally. Our Construction 
division has been resilient, despite low 
demand in the UK and high levels of 
competition internationally, because 
of our continued focus on recurring 
business under framework contracts and 
our ability to innovate and differentiate 
ourselves from peers. Equipment 
Services, our most geographically 
diverse business, has experienced a 
wide range of local market conditions 
during the year. Active management 
of our global fleet has ensured that 
we have been well-placed to take 
advantage of the strongest markets, 
while making best use of our invested 
capital. We are now looking to increase 
levels of investment in this business  
as future demand progresses.
During the year, we completed a major 
review of the Interserve brand, giving 
a better understanding of and a new 
emphasis on the unique strengths of 
the Company, which will help drive 
performance and improve the focus of 
our marketing. This is summarised by 
the phrase, “Ingenuity at Work”, which 
describes the intelligent approach our 
people take when designing solutions 
and dealing with the day-to-day 
challenges of meeting and hopefully 
exceeding, our customers’ expectations. 
Having redefined our vision and core 
values, we are engaged in a major 
communications programme across  
the business. 
We have developed plans for the 
imminent launch of a far-reaching and, 
in our view, bold sustainability strategy 
– SustainAbilities. This plan builds on 
our longstanding credentials in this 
increasingly important area: we have 
long recognised the need to develop not 
only financial capital, but also to look to 
areas such as environmental, social and 
knowledge ‘capitals’, to build a truly 
resilient, sustainable business. During 
the course of the year we have shaped  
this into a sustainability plan which 
underpins our corporate strategy.
In addition, clear communication of 
both our brand and of SustainAbilities, 
will help ensure that potential 
customers and stakeholders have a 
better understanding of Interserve and 
the full extent of our capabilities. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all of our people for their 
continued hard work in bringing their 
ingenuity and commitment to providing 
great service to our customers and to 
furthering their individual as well as 
our corporate development. During 
the last 12 months the Company has 
won numerous awards, including 
Learning and Career Development 
from the British Institute of Facilities 
Management, gold and silver awards for 
health and safety from RoSPA, the UK 
Excellence Award, the British Quality 
Foundation’s Achievement Award for 
Leadership, Project of the Year Award 
from the Chartered Institute of Building  
and the National Engineering Award, 
presented by the Association for 
Project Safety. 
A number of Board changes were 
announced in January which were 
brought about by the retirements  
of David Paterson and David Trapnell.  
I would like to thank them  
both for their long years of excellent 
service to the Company, and to 
welcome their successors, Anne  
Fahy as non-executive director to 
the Group Board and George Franks 
and Ian Renhard as members of the 
Executive Board. 
We remain confident in the  
delivery of our strategy and our 
medium-term outlook and we  
are therefore recommending an 
increased final dividend of 14.1p  
(2011: 13.0p), bringing the total 
dividend for the year to 20.5p  
(2011: 19.0p), an increase of 7.9  
per cent. The final dividend  
will be paid on 20 May 2013 to 
shareholders on the register at the  
close of business on 5 April 2013.

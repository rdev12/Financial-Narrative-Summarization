Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Chairman’s  
statement
Peter Erskine considers 
business performance, 
the r ole of corpor ate 
governance and how 
Boar d changes position 
Ladbrokes for 2013.
In addition to growth in the UK our 
retail businesses in Ireland, Belgium 
and Spain posted a combined  
51% increase in operating profit

.  
This reinforces the sustainability of 
these often unsung parts of our 
business and there is good future 
potential too with the possibility of 
increased opening hours in Ireland,  
the addition of machines to our shops 
in Belgium and ongoing expansion  
into new regions for our Spanish joint 
venture, Sportium. 
Moving to our Digital business, whilst 
experiencing a frustrating delay to the 
launch of our new sportsbook website 
in the summer , we end 2012 having 
taken significant steps forward.  
Our investment in new trading 
technology is starting to pay back 
through significant progress in our 
trading and liability management, 
which has contributed to an underlying 
increase in our sportsbook margin  
and improvement in the quality of  
our earnings. We expect to sustain  
this improvement going forward. 
We have also continued to expand our 
product range with more Bet in Play 
events and markets, new slots and 
more gaming opportunities. We have  
a clear road map of further product 
improvements going forward and are 
increasingly focusing on improved 
customer relationship management.
It is also pleasing to begin 2013  
with a genuine opportunity to further 
differentiate our customer offer from 
that of our competitors, with the 
acquisition of the Betdaq exchange 
business allowing us to offer the  
full spectrum of sports betting 
opportunities to customers.
Ladbrokes remains highly cash 
generative and we are pleased to see  
a further reduction in debt this year  
as well as an increased dividend. 
Board Changes
Christopher Rodrigues has decided  
to retire at the 2013 Annual General 
Meeting having served nine years as  
an independent non-executive director .  
We thank Christopher for his 
considerable contribution over the 
years and wish him well for the future. 
During 2012 we further strengthened 
the skills and diversity of the Board,  
with the appointment of two new 
non-executive directors, Richard Moross 
and Christine Hodgson. Richard’s 
experience in online businesses and 
Christine’s knowledge in the technology 
Dear Shareholder 
2012 has seen Ladbrokes continue  
on its upward path with record 
revenues in our UK Retail business, 
continued improvement in our Digital 
offering, some advances internationally 
and the continued strengthening of  
our balance sheet. 
Over the years many have questioned 
the sustainability of high street betting, 
so to secure a record year in terms of 
revenues is a real highlight. This is the 
third consecutive year of growth in 
profit per shop and we owe a particular 
note of thanks to our shop colleagues 
for their dedication and hard work.  
With our new operational structure, an 
increased focus on local competition 
and continued improvements in our 
machine offering, we are confident of 
further progress and we will continue 
to invest in new shops in 2013. 
field have added to the expertise of the 
Board and we value their input to our 
deliberations and decision making. 
Corporate Governance
The Board strives to provide the  
right leadership, strategic oversight 
and control environment to sustain 
delivery of value to our shareholders 
over the long term. The Board receives 
a detailed operational update on  
key strategic priorities at every  
meeting and holds the executive  
team accountable for the execution  
of these. 
We remain committed to high 
standards which is fundamental to 
ensuring the confidence and support  
of our shareholders, with whom  
I maintain an ongoing and open 
dialogue, meeting with many of  
them over the course of the year . 
Full details on how the Board and its 
committees apply the principles of 
good corporate governance can be 
found in the Corporate governance 
report on pages 30 to 36.
Dividend
The Group recommends paying a final 
dividend of 4.6 pence per share taking 
the full year dividend to 8.9 pence per 
share, an increase of 14.1%. This is in 
line with our policy of a target dividend 
cover of approximately 2.0 times 
underlying earnings.
The dividend will be payable on  
9 May 2013 to shareholders on  
the register on 22 March 2013.
Summary
Ladbrokes is showing clear  
and pleasing signs of improved 
performance as we deliver  
against our strategy and goals. 
With the reinvigoration of our Digital 
business gathering pace we look 
forward to making further advances  
in 2013.

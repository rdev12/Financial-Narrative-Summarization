A compelling  enterprise
“ As we move into the new  
financial year we are confident  
that we have firmly established a 
strong base to continue to grow 
the business. We have a strong IP 
portfolio and a number of joint 
development agreements with 
major partners that continue to 
make good progress.”
Jack Boyer
Chairman
Chairman’s  
statement
These are our third set of full year results as a public company. 
During the year we have seen significant operational progress 
with our IP development programmes and this is outlined in 
the Chief Executive’s review. We also experienced a number of 
challenges during the period, including delays with a number of 
potential contracts and the decision by Energizer to close one of 
its business units, which impacted on our development 
collaboration. This has been reflected in the reduced revenues 
for the Company and has, no doubt, had a significant impact on 
our share price.
Notwithstanding the above, we believe that the Company’s 
strong relationships with existing development partners should 
mean that contracts which were delayed in 2013 will be 
converted or replaced in 2014. Furthermore, the Company 
generated a significant number of new leads with major 
companies during the period. This should allow us to continue 
to broaden our commercial pipeline, further diversify our global 
customer base and deliver significant financial growth over the 
coming years. 09

Disposal of non-core wound care 
business
In December 2012 we disposed of our 
wound care operations allowing us to 
focus on our core activities of developing 
energy conversion and storage materials. 
This resulted in a reduction in overheads 
and the discontinued revenues in the  
7 months to 30 December 2012  
of £0.10 million (2012: £0.16 million) 
which are not included in the reported 
figures below. I would also like to thank  
Dr. Werner Braun, who has been a 
Director of Ilika since May 2007 , for his 
contribution to the Company over the 
years. Dr. Braun, who has extensive 
experience in the medical device sector, 
has stepped down at the end of his fixed 
term in office following the disposal  
of Altrika.
Financial results 
In line with the guidance provided in our 
statement from 16 April 2013, revenues 
from continuing operations for the year 
ended 30 April 2013 fell to £1.00 million 
(2012: £1.85 million), for the reasons 
explained above. Revenue in the year 
does not include any grant income  
(2012: £0.17 million) as the Carbon Trust 
funding was provided as a direct equity 
investment of £0.15 million rather than 
as a grant. 
Gross profit reduced to £0.44 million 
(2012: £0.81 million) and with 
administrative expenses increasing  
to £4.0 million (2012: £3.4 million) as  
a result of increased research and 
development activities, and zero grant 
income (2012: £0.17 million), we 
recorded an increased loss before tax on 
continuing operations of £3.5 million 
(2012: £2.4 million), resulting in a loss per 
share of 0.07p (2012: Loss of 0.07p).
Cash
As at 30 April 2013, the Group’s cash 
position was £1.9 million (2012: £5.3 
million). Post period end, we raised an 
additional £709,000 through a share 
placing which, coupled with securing and 
commencing a number of contracts with 
customers presently being finalised will 
provide sufficient cash to fund our 
requirements for the foreseeable future. 
Additionally, this placing has improved 
our shareholder register with new 
investors whose investment horizons are 
better aligned with our long-term 
corporate objectives.
Outlook
Although last year’s financial results did 
not meet market expectations, the new 
financial year has already seen the 
conversion of one of the delayed 
contracts and we hope to see other 
opportunities convert throughout the 
year. Whilst development work in Japan 
remains the largest contributor to 
revenues and we are encouraged by a 
strong pipeline of opportunities through 
our recently appointed business 
development director based in Frankfurt, 
Germany, as well as further 
opportunities in the US.
The development of our solid-state 
battery technology, co-developed with 
Toyota, for man-portable applications 
has progressed through the first phase  
of the programme in-line with our 
expectations and we have submitted a 
proposal to the US army for the funding 
of technology to full development  
and whilst this assessment process is 
ongoing we are also exploring additional 
commercial support for the technology 
in the consumer electronics and 
automotive sectors.
Finally I would like to thank the staff and 
Board for their hard work over the last 
year and their undoubted contribution to 
the growth of the business. I look forward 
to reporting on the developments of the 
Group over the coming year.

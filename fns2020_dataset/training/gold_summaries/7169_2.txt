 driven by a strong performance by our International 
business, in the context of increasingly challenging conditions in many of our markets. 
The year saw fast-changing, volatile market conditions around the world, with sentiment amongst 
our clients and candidates varying from quarter to quarter. As such, our approach to managing 
the business has been nimble and responsive to reflect this volatility, most notably in terms of 
prioritising appropriate areas of investment.
We have continued to grow our business to maximise fees in more buoyant markets, such as the 
resource-based regions of Australia and our global IT, Engineering, Life Sciences and Oil & Gas 
specialisms. Equally, we have continued to invest in order to capitalise on structural growth markets 
such as Germany, Japan and Brazil. At the same time, we have taken appropriate action to defend 
the profit of the Group by focusing on strong cost control in more challenging markets, and 
leveraging our best-in-class IT systems to drive consultant productivity. 03 directors’ report business review 253.8

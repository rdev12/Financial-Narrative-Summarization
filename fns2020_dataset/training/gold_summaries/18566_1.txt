 Strategy – transforming G4S
In November 2013 we set out  
our strategy to transform G4S  
and build a business capable of 
delivering sustainable, profitable 
growth. During 2015 we made 
substantial progress implementing 
this strategy and the G4S group 
now has three distinct components:
• Businesses sold or to be sold  
or closed under the portfolio 
programme;
• Legacy contracts to be managed 
to an effective conclusion; and
• Continuing businesses, which  
are making tangible strategic, 
operational and financial progress 
as we implement G4S’s strategy. 
The first two components do not 
form part of the long-term future  
of G4S, whereas the continuing 
businesses form the core of G4S 
today and in the future. Each of 
these components of the group  
is described in further detail below.
Businesses sold or to be sold 
or closed – portfolio programme
In November 2013 we announced 
the start of a portfolio review 
programme, the aim of which  
“ During 2015 we made substantial 
progress with the strategic and 
operational transformation of  
G4S. Our portfolio management 
programme combined with our 
investment in sales, innovation and  
re-structuring is reflected in the 
results of our underlying operations 
where the group’s revenues rose  
by 4% and earnings rose by 14%.”

was to improve the strategic focus  
and performance of the group. 
Since 2013, we have sold or are 
exiting 61 businesses, with aggregate 
revenues of around £1.2 billion and 
pre-tax losses of £30 million. We 
have completed the sale or closure 
of 23 businesses and raised £281 
million in disposal proceeds. Since 
31 December 2015 we have 
identified a further four businesses  
to be sold, with aggregate revenues 
of around £400 million.
The implementation of our portfolio 
programme is fundamentally changing 
the shape of G4S, improving the 
strategic, commercial and operational 
focus and strengthening the financial 
position and performance of our 
continuing businesses.
Legacy contracts
Between 2005 and 2012, G4S 
entered into a number of multi-year 
contracts which contained obligations, 
terms and conditions that make 
these contracts inherently unprofitable 
for G4S. Virtually all of these relate 
to UK public service contracts. In 
addition, we have invested substantial 
time, resource and capital in the 
corporate renewal programme

Chief Executive’s review which we agreed with the  
UK Government following the 
overbilling for services under the  
UK Electronic Monitoring contract.
Since 2013 we have set aside 
around £250 million to cover the 
cost of legacy contracts, including 
the UK Electronic Monitoring 
contract, of which around £150 
million has been paid to date. We 
have also identified a contingent 
liability of £57 million relating to the 
UK Compass contract, should the 
contract be extended to August 2019.
Managing these contracts to an 
effective and efficient conclusion 
remains an important element of 
our business plan. Over the next 
two to four years we expect this to 
become significantly less important 
as these contracts come to an end. 
In the meantime we have materially 
strengthened controls over the 
approval of major contracts to 
prevent such contracts from  
being signed in future.
Continuing businesses
We continue to make substantial 
investments in these businesses and 
in 2015 we saw these investments 
producing tangible strategic, 
operational and financial benefits.  
It is important to recognise that we 
have much further to go to realise 
the full potential of our strategy.
Our investment in continuing 
businesses is focused on a number 
of key strategic priorities which  
are described below and set out  
in more detail on pages 16 to 35:
• Investing in people and values
• Investing in growth and innovation
• Investing in customer relationships 
and service excellence
• Investing in operational excellence 
financial discipline
Effective 1 January 2016, we created 
two new regions – Asia Pacific and 
Middle East & India (replacing Asia 
Middle East) which brings additional 
executive resource and focus to 
these important markets. T o lead 
these regions we made two new 
appointments to the group executive 
team: Claude Allain joined our 
executive team in January 2016  
and took up the position of Regional 
President for the Middle East and 
India region, based in Dubai. Claude 
has a strong and proven track  
record working in global service  
and technology businesses (see 
biographical details on page 58).  
Jon Corner was appointed as 
Regional President for Asia Pacific, 
based in Hong Kong. Jon was 
formerly Commercial Director,  
Asia Middle East and has extensive 
business experience in the Asia 
Pacific region (see biographical  
details on page 58).
People and values: Our people and 
values are critical to the successful 
execution of our strategy. We are 
strengthening our organisation by 
investing in talent via recruitment, 
internal development, promotion 
and training. 
In 2015 we undertook a global 
employee survey and were 
delighted that 449,000 colleagues 
took the opportunity to provide  
us with their feedback on working 
for G4S. Around 80% of participating 
employees provided favourable 
scores, confirming that they would 
recommend G4S as an employer. 
Whilst these are comparatively 
good results, we have no room  
for complacency and the survey 
provides us with invaluable 
information which we can use to 
actively engage with our colleagues 
across the group. I am grateful to 
each and every colleague who 
contributed to this important  
work in 2015.

Strategic report In 2015, we welcomed Jenni Myles  
to the group executive team as 
group HR Director (biographical 
details page 59). Mel Brooks, already 
a member of the executive team, 
was appointed as Regional President 
for Africa. 
At the end of 2015, Jesus Rosano 
moved from his role as COO of  
our Latin America region, to join  
the group executive committee  
in the role of Group Commercial  
& Strategy Director.
We have a stronger senior leadership 
team in place across the group and 
we are better placed to achieve our 
strategic goals in the coming years. 
At the start of 2016 we launched 
our new group values. These values 
are the standards we set for ourselves 
and through our behaviours and 
actions, we are working to embed 
them in the culture of our organisation. 
These values help us to retain and 
attract employees and to meet and 
exceed our customers’ expectations. 
They are vital to the long term 
success of G4S and are described  
in further detail on page 19.
We re-launched our ‘Speak Out’ 
service for employees to raise any 
concerns they have about conduct 
which is inconsistent with our values. 
Recent events at our UK Medway 
facility underline the importance  
of this on-going programme.
Growth and Innovation: Against  
a backdrop of macro-economic 
volatility and challenging trading 
conditions in some of our markets, 
demand for our services remained 
resilient and we won new contracts 
with an annual value of over £1.3 
billion and total contract value of 
£2.4 billion. At the same time, we 
replenished our pipeline which now 
has an annual value of £5.7 billion.
We sustained average contract 
retention rates of around 90%, 
although lower volumes drawn 
under contracts in some markets 
have partially offset the positive 
impact of new contracts. In the 
current economic environment we 
expect demand for our services to 
grow by around 4-6% per annum 
over the medium term.
We continued to invest in product 
and service innovation and made 
substantial progress with services 
such as Symmetry (access control 
system), Symmetry-Connect (visitor 
management), CASH360™ and 
Deposita (cash management).  
New services in these areas of  
our business are gaining commercial 
traction in the marketplace, both as 
stand-alone and integrated offerings 
and we are excited about the 
potential to grow these services 
over the coming years.
Customer relationships and service 
excellence: During 2015 we 
continued to invest in progressively 
embedding a rigorous approach  
to sales operations, strategic account 
management and customer service 
management. We use a standard 
sales management tool, Salesforce, 
across the group and this has improved 
the visibility and management of our 
sales pipeline. We have also adopted 
a Net Promoter Score model to 
measure and respond to customer 
satisfaction scores. Alongside these 
measures we continue to invest in 
strategic account managers to ensure 
that we anticipate and serve our 
customers’ needs.
Operational excellence: We 
continued to invest in improving our 
efficiency through the execution of 
our restructuring and productivity 
programmes and the positive effects 
of this are reflected in the group’s 
commercial, operational and financial 
performance for 2015. We expect  
to extract further benefits in 2016.
Health & Safety: The safety and 
wellbeing of our employees and 
those in our care is a key priority  
for the group executive team and 
the global leadership team. Our goal 
is zero harm and to achieve that we 
are striving to ensure that each and 
every employee at G4S understands 
and complies with safe and secure 
working practices. We work in an 
inherently hazardous industry: many 
of our colleagues travel extensively 
and many are trained to protect  
our customers and their property. 
As a result, road traffic accidents  
and criminal attacks are inherent 
risks we face in delivering some  
of our services. We have therefore 
invested in considerable improvements 
to our health and safety policies, 
practices, training and resources 
across the group. Whilst we have 
made progress in these areas, we 
remain dissatisfied with safety 
performance in some parts of the 
company and I regret to report that 
46 colleagues lost their lives in the 
line of duty in 2015. We pay tribute 
to the courage and service of 
colleagues who lost their lives  
and we remain whole-heartedly 
committed to our goal of zero harm.
Financial discipline: We have 
strengthened capital investment 
processes and we are applying 
capital with greater consistency  
and rigour.
Our working capital processes are 
improving, but this remains an area 
where much greater consistency  
and discipline is required. Our 
management of this area fell short 
of our standards in the final quarter 
of 2015 and this is a key priority for 
our finance and line management 
teams in 2016. T o that end we have 
increased the weighting of operating 
cash flow in our annual incentive plans.
Underlying performance
Revenue growth was positive in  
all regions apart from the UK, where 
our revenues fell by 3% reflecting 
the loss of a cash services contract 
in the retail sector and the UK 
Electronic Monitoring contract in 
2014. Compared with 2014, our 
revenues grew by 8.6% in emerging 
8 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015
Chief Executive’s Review continued Watch the CEO Review online 
at: www.g4s.com/investors
markets and by 5.8% in North 
America, whilst our business in 
Europe returned to growth with a 
2.6% increase in revenues. Overall 
group revenues increased by 4%.
Underlying PBITA (profit before 
interest, tax and amortisation) of 
£427 million was 5.7% higher than 
2014, which reflects revenue growth, 
operational gearing, and the benefits 
of our restructuring and productivity 
programmes. Underlying earnings 
and EPS increased 14% to £227 
million and 14.7p respectively.
Cash flow from operating businesses 
was £460 million, down by 13% on 
last year mainly due to a £69 million 
increase in working capital in 2015, 
related to revenue growth and the 
transition to a shared service centre, 
which reversed in the first two 
months of 2016.
Although the group made good 
progress on an underlying basis, our 
statutory earnings of £8 million were 
adversely impacted by a number of 
significant factors described below:
Onerous contracts: as described 
above, the group continued to incur 
significant costs in relation to legacy 
contracts and we provided a further 
£65 million, principally in relation  
to the Compass contract with the 
UK Government (asylum seeker 
accommodation) and a UK PFI 
contract (NHS). 
Goodwill impairment: a net  
charge of £66 million in relation to 
businesses acquired prior to 2013 
and businesses expected to be sold 
or closed.
Exchange rates: the sterling value of 
emerging market revenues (around 
one-third of group revenues) was 
adversely affected by the sharp falls 
in many emerging market currencies 
and this reduced our statutory PBITA.
During the year, we continued to 
invest in restructuring programmes 
which improved the competitiveness 
of some of our key businesses by 
reducing their cost structures. These 
programmes have payback periods 
of 12-36 months and deliver attractive 
double-digit returns. The cost of 
these programmes (2015: £44 
million (2014: £29 million)) is 
excluded from underlying results.
The board is recommending that the 
final dividend is maintained at 5.82p 
per share (DKK 0.5615), bringing the 
total dividend for the full year to 
9.41p per share, a 1.8% increase.
Outlook: Against a backdrop  
of global economic uncertainty, 
demand for our services remained 
resilient and growth accelerated in 
the second half of 2015, providing 
good support for further operating 
and financial progress in 2016. In the 
current economic environment we 
expect medium term demand for 
our services to grow by around 
4-6% per annum.
Finally, I would like to thank all of  
our colleagues across the world 
whose expertise and dedication to 
our customers and our group is 
reflected in the substantial progress 
made by G4S in 2015.

 This time last year we were looking
for an improvement in trading
conditions. In the event we were
disappointed. Indeed, with slow
trading continuing, combined with
pressures to lower selling prices and
significant upward pressure on
costs notably insurance, but also
material prices, we were faced with
a year when although we held our
own we made no overall progress.
With both turnover and margins
down, operating profit fell to
£1,373,000 (2002: £2,545,000)
and adjusted earnings per share
(before restructuring costs) to
13.3p (2002: 24.0p). The Directors
are recommending a maintained
final dividend of 8.00 pence. The
balance sheet remains strong with
net cash in the bank of £692,000 at
the year end. Whilst last year was
a disappointment, we are now one
year nearer to an upturn if past
experience of engineering business
cycles is a reliable guide, and we
certainly see no evidence that the
economy is behaving that much
differently to the way it has
behaved over the years.
In a year when trading is tough it is
tempting to avoid difficult decisions
in order to protect short term
results. Cutting costs, particularly
reducing the number of employees,
is both unwelcome and expensive
as our restructuring costs of
£451,000 demonstrate. On the
other side of the coin, a
continuance of capital expenditure
and vigorous product development
also limits short term results. As
we see it, we have no sensible
alternative but to continue with an
aggressive policy of improvement.
The world does not stand still just
because we have a pause in trading
progress. Last year was no
exception. Not unexpectedly one
product which has stood us in good
stead over the years has gone to
imports from the Far East, and
we are ourselves now importers
of the product. We have also
been affected by business failure in
circumstances when we believed it
right to support a customer who
faced similar problems, but in the
event could not contain them.
These judgements are not easy to
reach and it would be a bold
Chairman who claimed that we will
always get them right. Any more
than we are certain to be right
about exchange rates as we trade
in Euros with our French and
German customers. Nevertheless,
your Board is certain that under
Barrie Williams’ leadership we are
pursuing sound policies with
confidence and good judgement
and the proof that the mixture is
right comes out in a strong balance
sheet and a positive cash position
with nil net borrowings. We are
pursuing tomorrow’s opportunities
with determination.They will emerge
and we will be able to take them
with confidence.
Meanwhile it is too soon to call an
upturn. The pressures on costs and
prices remain. We are winning new
business but schedules are not yet
sufficiently buoyant. There will
come a day when the cycle turns
and when it does I am confident
that we will break new ground. We
have a good team well led, and
with a strong balance sheet to
back sound market positions we
have every prospect of resuming
progress.

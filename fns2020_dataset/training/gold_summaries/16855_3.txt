 I am pleased to report on another successful year with
turnover and profit up by 11% and 13% respectively. 
This demonstrates our commitment to achieving 
continued success and increasing shareholder value.
Chairman’s statement
Martin Jay Chairman
2004/5 was another strong year for VT Group
with turnover increasing by 11% to £744m
(2004: £671m). Profit before tax and the
amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items
improved by 13% to £52.0m (2004: £46.2m)
with the corresponding earnings per share also
improving by 15% to 20.8p (2004: 18.1p).
This performance has enabled the board to
recommend a final dividend of 7.00 pence
giving a total dividend for the year of 9.75 pence
per share, an increase of 8% over last year.
The group has a high visibility of earnings and
finished the year strongly with an order book
valued at £2.7bn (2004: £2.4bn). During the
year the most notable orders were to manage
the Royal New Zealand Navy’s dockyard in
Auckland (£100m), to build, operate and
maintain the South Wales Fire Brigade Training
Centre (£70m) and to construct an Offshore
Patrol Vessel (OPV) (Helicopter) for the Royal
Navy (initial value of £30m).
Our Support Services business continues to
perform well, growing both organically and
through acquisition. We completed two
acquisitions in the year, in the Education 
and Skills sector and in the US Defense 
sector, both of which fit with our strategy in
these areas. 
Our Shipbuilding business has had a strong
year with productivity at our new Portsmouth
facility up by over 20% compared with the
Woolston shipyard. This business has now
turned a corner in terms of performance and
the outlook is positive as we embark on one of
the largest planned UK warship building
programmes for many years.
During the year Terry Madden stepped down as
a director following the sale of certain trade and
assets of VT Engine Controls Limited. Terry had
been with the group since 1988 and we wish
him much success in the future. 
This will be my last chairman’s statement due 
to my imminent retirement from the board.
Having been with the group since 1989, I am
proud to have served first as chief executive
and then as chairman with a company that
continues to achieve such success and which
has an enviable reputation for both quality and
service. This can only be a mark of the
commitment and dedication of the people that
have worked and continue to work within VT.
I am delighted to be handing over the reins as
chairman to Michael Jeffries on July 5th 2005.
Michael was previously employed as chief
executive officer of WS Atkins plc from 1995 
to 2001 and was chairman from 2001 to 2005.
He is currently chairman of Wembley National
Stadium Limited and Wyless plc and a 
non-executive director of De La Rue plc.
Michael’s strong track record in building
successful Support Services businesses will, 
I am sure, prove extremely valuable to VT. 
I leave the group well placed and in a strong
position to take advantage of market
opportunities in the longer term.

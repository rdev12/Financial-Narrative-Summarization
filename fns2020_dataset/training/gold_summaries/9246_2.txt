Financial highlights
 Explanatory notes:
(i)  Laird uses underlying results as key performance indicators. Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share 
are stated before exceptional items, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible 
assets and goodwill, the gain or loss on disposal of businesses and the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial 
instruments. The narrative that follows is based on underlying operating profit, underlying profit before tax and underlying 
earnings per share, as the directors believe that these provide a more consistent measure of operating performance. 
(ii)  Excludes a special dividend of 50p per share paid in June 2007.

 Abcam plc Annual report and accounts 30 June 2007 02
Abcam plc is a producer and distributor 
of research-grade antibodies and 
associated products.
Our vision is to build the largest online 
catalogue of the best antibodies in  
the world.
Our Business at a Glance
How we work
1. We source and develop
We produce our own antibodies and 
source other excellent antibodies from 
institutes, academic laboratories and 
primary manufacturers.
Established in 1998, Abcam now has an 
online catalogue of over 25,000 antibodies 
and 8,000 related products (such as 
proteins, peptides and kits). A growing 
percentage of our products are produced  
in-house and investment in a new high 
throughput facility will see this increase 
substantially in the future. Other products 
are supplied by more than 200 leading OEM 
partners and sold under the Abcam brand.
2. We add value
Our scientists have built a catalogue  
of the best antibodies in the world and 
they provide technical support on all 
of our products to help our customers 
achieve results.
The unique relationship Abcam has with 
the scientists who use our products means 
that we can obtain a wide range of testing 
data from their feedback and enquiries.  
We publish this information in the form of 
Abreviews
SM
, which support the purchasing 
decisions of researchers looking for 
reagents. Taken across the catalogue, 
average unit sales continue to increase  
the longer they have been in our catalogue, 
a trend we attribute in part to the sheer 
quantity of product information we are  
able to gather and publish over time.
3. We deliver
We distribute Abcam products across 
the world using our fully automated 
web-enabled stock-management 
system. Our size means that we can 
invest in state-of-the-art storage and 
handling facilities, which have enabled 
us to speed up shipping times and 
increase our output. We are able to 
operate at high levels of efficiency, 
with lower handling costs.
Customers can directly access the website 
to find the status of their orders so they can 
plan their experiments more effectively.
4. We support
Our products come with an Abpromise, 
giving customers the reassurance of 
knowing that:
Our antibodies are of the highest quality 
and are backed up by an expert technical 
team, who are available to assist in initial 
product selection.
Customers can, at any time, contact 
other customers using the same antibody 
via our unique Abreviews
SM
 system.
If, after optimisation, any product does 
not perform as described on the 
datasheet, customers can contact our 
expert team to ask for advice and 
assistance.
In the unlikely event that a product is 
faulty, we will replace or provide a full 
refund if reported within 120 days  
of purchase.

Where we operate
Abcam plc is headquartered 
in Cambridge, UK. We have 
a US office in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, and have 
recently opened an office  
in Tokyo, Japan.
In the UK, we recently completed 
construction of a new high-throughput 
production (HTP) laboratory that will 
broaden our portfolio of high-margin 
products developed in-house. We 
continue to benefit from close links to  
the University of Cambridge, from which  
a large number of our PhD recruits 
are drawn.
Our US office has made a substantial 
contribution to sales since it was opened 
four years ago. Over the last 12 months 
we have improved service to our US 
customers by extending opening times 
and introducing Saturday working.
The opening of our Japanese office in 
December 2006 reflects our determination 
to expand in East Asia, one of the fastest-
growing antibody markets in the world. 
With a physical presence in Tokyo, we  
are radically improving the quality of the 
service we provide to customers in 
the region.

USA
The US is Abcam’s largest market, 
accounting for over 50% of sales last 
year. This is the largest market in the 
world and we have recently launched a 
new sales and marketing programme 
to further drive sales growth.
Europe
In Europe our renewed focus on 
marketing has propelled a 58.8% 
year-on-year increase in the volume  
of business. Our virtual offices are 
promoting the use of French and 
German so that many European 
customers can now contact us directly 
in their own language.
Japan
It is still early days for our Japanese 
business but we are delighted with  
its performance to date, which saw 
sales in the second half of the year of 
¥160m (£680k). We have also recently 
launched a Japanese version of our 
website.

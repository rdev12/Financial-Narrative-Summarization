In addition, the Group gained valuable 
new clients from its acquisition of NGS, 
all of which continue to use the best 
security testers in the market regardless 
of the economic uncertainty.
The Site Confidence operation 
encompassing the web site monitoring 
and load testing business had a good  
year in which revenues grew by 9%.  
This is before the Group started on its 
product upgrades which will further 
improve the competitiveness of the 
products and services. 
The market place for the Site Confidence 
products has been more affected by 
the recession than the other areas 
of Assurance Testing, as customers 
have been more willing to switch off 
the Group’s services and risk falling 
behind their competitors’ web site 
performances. However the recurring 
income renewal rates remain consistent 
at 90%.
The acquisition of NGS broadened  
the Group’s appeal in the ethical  
security market by further increasing the 
technical expertise and adding forensics 
skills and research to the already strong 
set of propositions.
Group Strategy
The Group strategy remains to develop 
further the two core strands of Escrow 
and Assurance organically by developing 
new ideas and looking for new 
opportunities in the IT and Information 
Security markets, geographically and by 
acquisition when appropriate. 
The Group has always viewed profits, 
margins and cash generation as the 
most important features of its business 
model and we do not intend to change 
that approach. Escrow’s margin has 
continued to increase and it is normal 
for us to use a combination of effective 
selling and price increases to improve it 
further. The Board does not expect this to 
change although price increases will be 
lower than seen in the past.
In Assurance Testing, the Group has 
been growing rapidly and has historically 
built revenue and market share at the 
expense of margin. Over the last 12 
months, the Board set about realising 
scale and established market position 
and changing the focus onto margin 
improvement. The margin has improved 
and is expected to continue going 
forward. Further with the acquisition of 
NGS, the premium service offering, the 
Board expects to gain higher day rates.
The strength of the Group’s proposition  
is that it is independent; the Group 
delivers the right solution for the client 
without being biased towards a  
particular vendor or solution. The  
Group would not consider entering the 
already over populated reseller market 
other than to sell its own tools, as is the 
case with the Site Confidence monitoring 
and load tools and the NGS database 
security tools.

CONSULTANCY 
REVENUES GREW  
BY 36% TO
£6.7M
Consultancy
Consultancy revenues grew  
by 36% to £6.7m (2008: £4.9m) 
as the Group continued to grow  
its presence in the Information 
Security marketplace. With 
the increased presence of 
Information Security and the 
synergies that are being achieved 
from being part of the Assurance 
division, the Board expects to be 
able to continue growing both 
profits and revenues despite 
dropping certain types of work.
Acquisitions 
The Group has consistently 
complemented its organic growth by 
carefully adding accretive acquisitions. 
The Group successfully completed 
two acquisitions in the financial year: 
NGS and the remaining shareholding in 
Escrow Europe Switzerland. In addition it 
concluded the earn out and integration of 
Escrow Europe.
Acquisitions are still very important to the 
Group. Seven have been completed and 
have all been successful and at fair prices 
reflecting their strategic importance. NGS 
is now firmly part of the Group and is 
adding a tremendous amount of value. 
Agreeing a price is always the hardest 
part of any negotiation and there is a 
misconception that there are bargains to 
be had for people businesses. Clearly, 
the disappearance of the overinflated 
private equity-led pricing models will 
make acquisition pricing ease, but 
bargains are unlikely to be found.
 
The strategy is to look at the highest 
quality businesses and pay a full and fair 
price for them. As importantly, the Group 
typically buys small or mid-size people 
businesses. The Group will continue 
to invest in appropriate complementary 
businesses by way of company or asset 
based acquisitions. NCC Group remains 
involved in a number of dialogues with 
suitable target companies but will always 
remain cautious, as the integration 
and extraction of enhanced value is of 
paramount importance to the Group. 
Employees, Recruitment  
and Retention
Recruitment and retention remains the 
biggest challenge to growth for a people 
business such as NCC Group and the 
management has made good progress. 
The Board is committed to employing 
the best people in the market wherever 
possible. The Group had a headcount of 
421 employees worldwide at the end of 
the last financial year.
The Group has seen a good intake 
of new testers and well qualified 
Information Security consultants in 
Assurance Testing as it capitalised  
on its market leading position. In  
Escrow worldwide all sales teams  
have grown, even in the UK, where  
at the year end the Escrow sales team 
reached a record 95. 
As important as recruitment is retention. 
The management believes that its all 
round packages place it in the top 
quartile of remuneration in the locations 
from which the Group operates. 
Therefore as in all previous years, the 
Group has reviewed all salaries and 
bonuses in the normal way. NCC Group 
has resisted the temptation to implement 
a cap or freeze on pay, so as to ensure 
that its people remain motivated and 
valued so that the Group is able to retain 
them when there is an economic upturn.
The Way Forward
We continue to make a virtue of 
acting independently and operating 
as trusted, equitable advisors. To date 
we have successfully acquired and 
integrated seven businesses that have 
complemented our service and delivery 
offerings. Combining that with our 
outstanding track record of organic 
growth, we have a sound business  
model that we will continue to evolve  
and develop to grow the Group further.

REVIEW
Group Revenue
Group revenue for the year ended 31 
May 2009 increased by 31% to £46.8m 
(2008: £35.7m), with the previous year’s 
acquisitions of Secure Test and Escrow 
Europe successfully integrated into the 
Group. The Group has continued to be 
acquisitive in the year, purchasing the UK 
based NGS and the remaining 76% of 
Escrow Europe Switzerland in November 
2008 and May 2009 respectively. Excluding 
these acquisitions, Group revenue grew by 
19% to £43.4m.
The Group half year split saw 44%  
of revenue delivered in the first half  
(2008: 46%) and 56% in the second  
half (2008: 54%). 
The geographic split of revenue has 
continued to evolve with the acquisition 
of NGS which has a global presence. 
However, the majority of Group revenue 
is derived from the UK. UK revenue was 
£36.6m (2008: £29.2m) representing 78% 
(2008: 82%) of the total of the Group, with 
the rest of the world increasing by 48% to 
£5.6m (2008: £3.8m) within which Europe 
contributed £4.6m (2008: £2.7m).
Profitability
Adjusted Group operating profit, excluding 
the amortisation of acquired intangibles, 
as set out in the table opposite, grew by 
19% to £12.7m (2008: £10.7m). Adjusted 
operating margins were, as expected, 
slightly lower at 27% (2008: 30%) 
reflecting the change in the Group’s margin 
mix as a result of the acquisitions.  
Non-escrow businesses’ margins are 
typically closer to 15%. The adjusted 
operating profit includes £1.0m (2008: 
£0.7m) of share based charges and related 
costs. Excluding the share based charges, 
adjusted operating profits grew by 21%.
The half year split of adjusted operating 
profits was H1 43%: H2 57% (2008: H1 
44%: H2 56%). 
Currency fluctuations resulted in a £28,000 
positive impact on the Group’s profits in 
the financial year ended 31 May 2009.
Adjusted pre-tax profit increased 17% 
to £12.3m (2008: £10.5m). The Group’s 
reported pre-tax profit was up 25% to 
£10.9m (2008: £8.7m) after the inclusion 
of the unwinding of the discount on the 
acquisitions deferred consideration and 
amortisation of intangible assets.
Escrow
The worldwide Escrow businesses  
are the cornerstone of the Group’s 
profitability and provide a notably high 
degree of recurring revenue due to the 
high contracts renewals base. Group 
Escrow remains the largest division, 
accounting for 45% of total revenue 
(2008: 50%). It increased revenue  
by 17% to £21.0m (2008: £18.0m). 
47% of revenue was delivered in the  
first half (2008: 47%) and 53% in  
the second half (2008: 53%). Organic 
revenue growth in the year was 13%, 
with strong performances from the 
overseas operations.
Escrow UK increased revenue by 6%  
to £16.6m (2008: £15.7m). UK growth  
in the first half of the year was slower 
than the Board would have liked, as 
clients were affected by the severity  
and speed of the economic downturn 
which curtailed their investment in IT 
software and services. The business  
also experienced a fall off in demand  
for verification services. In the first six 
months overall growth was 1%. In the 
second six months, due to swift action 
taken to refocus the sales message, new 
contract and verifications growth was 
once again 10%. 
Escrow US increased its revenue  
by 70% to £2.0m (2008: £1.2m)  
and Escrow Europe increased  
revenues by 121% to £2.4m (2008: 
£1.1m) of which £0.5m was derived 
from Escrow Germany.
Escrow UK contract terminations as 
anticipated at the interim results  
increased in the year to 11.5% (2008: 
9.2%) - more details on page 18. 
However recurring revenues obtained 
through renewals increased by 22%  
to £13.6m (2008: £11.2m).
Group Escrow operating profit increased 
15% to £11.7m (2008: £10.2m) with 
Escrow UK contributing 88%. Escrow  
US and Escrow Europe continued to 
increase profitability and contributed  
5% and 7% of total Escrow operating 
profits respectively with all geographies  
seeing double digit growth. 
Group Escrow operating margins 
remained strong as a consequence 
of focused control over contract 
terminations and new business wins 
at 55% (2008: 56%) with Escrow  
UK increasing its margins to 62%  
(2008: 60%).

Assurance Testing
Assurance Testing now accounts for 
41% (2008: 36%) of Group revenues 
due to the full year contribution from 
Secure Test and the acquisition of NGS 
during the year. Revenue increased 
by 49% to £19.1m (2008: £12.8m) 
and, excluding the acquisition of NGS, 
Assurance Testing revenues increased 
22% to £15.7m.
Operating profit increased 67% to 
£2.8m (2008: £1.7m) and it is expected 
that both revenues and operating profits 
will increase further in the current 
financial year as the demand for ethical 
security testing and performance and 
load testing continues to grow.
Assurance Testing continues to benefit 
from the integration of the various  
units acquired to date and is focusing  
on improving its operating margins,  
which grew to 15% from 13% in the 
previous year.
Consultancy
Consultancy accounted for 14% of 
Group revenue (2008: 14%). Revenues 
grew by 36% to £6.7m (2008: £4.9m), 
and operating profit for the year 
increased by 4% to £0.8m (2008: 
£0.7m) as the general IT consultancy 
market, which we have been moving 
away from during the last two years, has 
continued to be very competitive. 
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate is 29.2% 
(2008: 26.9%). The increase in the 
effective tax rate is largely due to the 
impact in the prior year of the tax 
allowance in relation to the exercise of 
share options granted in 2004. This 
exceeded the reduction in the tax rate  
from 30% in 2008 to 28% in 2009.
The effective tax rate is above the 
standard UK rate of 28% largely due  
to the impact of foreign tax and items  
not deductible for tax purposes. 
Earnings Per Share
The adjusted fully diluted earnings per 
share increased 17% to 26.1p (2008: 
22.4p). The basic earnings per share 
increased 21% to 22.9p (2008: 18.9p), 
whilst fully diluted earnings per share 
increased 20% to 22.1p (2008: 18.3p). 
The table on page 24 analyses the 
effect on the Group’s fully diluted 
earnings per share of the amortisation 
of acquired intangibles, unwind of the 
discount on the deferred consideration 
for acquisitions and the effect of the 
exceptional costs.  
 
Dividends
In line with the continuing progressive 
dividend policy, the Board is 
recommending a final dividend of 6.25p 
per ordinary share, making the total 
9.25p for the year. This represents cover 
of 2.5 times (2008: 2.7 times) based on 
basic earnings per share. 
Shareholders’ funds at the end of the  
year were £44.8m (2008: £39.5m).

Cash
The Group continues to be highly  
cash generative with operating cash  
flow before interest and tax of £16.1m 
(2008: £11.2m) which is 140% of 
operating profit before interest and  
tax (2008: 122%).
After accounting for net cash  
outflows of £11.4m for acquisitions 
and deferred acquisitions payments 
made during this year, the Group  
ended the year with net debt of  
£5.6m (2008: £3.4m). 
Capital expenditure remained  
tightly controlled at £1.4m (2008: 
£1.5m). In the current financial  
year as the Group upgrades its  
core IT systems to SAP, there will  
be a one-time capital expenditure  
increase of approximately £1.8m.
In the year, the Group underwent a 
refinancing deal to secure a £15m 
multi-option facility term loan which 
at the year end was 59% utilised at 
£8.9m. This facility along with the highly 
cash generative nature of the Group’s 
businesses, provides flexibility for 
future acquisitions and expected capital 
projects. It expires in July 2010 when the 
Group expects to be almost debt free.
Balance Sheet
Following the acquisitions of NGS and 
Escrow Europe Switzerland, goodwill 
increased by 18% to £52.2m (2008: 
£44.1m) and the cost of intangible 
assets relating to customer contracts 
and associated relationships increased 
by 15.7% to £10.1m (2008: £8.7m). The 
value of goodwill has been assessed and 
no impairment has been evidenced. The 
contracts and customer relationships 
have been assigned a useful economic 
life of between three and twenty years 
and are to be amortised over that period.

W e continued to deliver against our strategy in 
2016 which resulted in a successful year across 
both our mines and exploration programmes.

CHIEF ExECuTIVE OFFICER
We also saw a substantial fall in our all-in sustaining costs (‘aISC’)  
to uS$958 per ounce, which was 14% below 2015 levels and at the 
bottom of our guidance range of uS$950 to uS$980 per ounce. This  
was a result of the changes that were made to the business in late 
2015, improved operating efficiencies at the assets and the increased 
production profile. If we were to focus purely on asset performance, and 
remove the impact of the increase in the share price on the valuation of 
share-based payments, our aISC would have been uS$921 per ounce, 
17% below 2015 and well below our guidance range.
I was especially pleased with the return to free cash generation during 
the year, which is our primary focus. Over the past 12 months we 
doubled our net cash on the balance sheet to uS$218 million which 
provides significant flexibility for us going forward. at the same time,  
the success of North Mara meant that a corporate tax charge amounting 
to uS$55 million was incurred, which included a uS$20 million cash 
prepayment agreed with the Tanzanian Revenue authority in Q1 2017. 
year in review
2016 was a very strong operational year as we saw the benefit of  
the first full year of operations at the Gokona underground at North 
Mara. This deposit was previously mined as a high-grade open pit  
and commenced underground mining in mid 2015 after we made the 
strategic decision to go underground in 2014. The mine delivered ahead 
of expectations in 2016, partly due to a 61% increase in mined grade 
compared to the resource model. This drove additional ounces and  
the overall mine achieved a record production year of 378,443 ounces,  
a 32% increase over 2015. at Bulyanhulu, we overcame an extended 
process plant shutdown in the third quarter which led to a loss of 
approximately one month of milling capacity to deliver 289,432 ounces, 
a 6% increase on 2015. This demonstrates the increased operational 
resilience as part of our ongoing programme to unlock the geological and 
operational potential of the asset. at Buzwagi, production was behind 
expectations at 161,830 ounces, 5% below 2015 as a result of lower 
mined grades due to a change in pit sequencing in order to enhance 
operational efficiencies as part of the extension of mining in 2017. 
On the cost side, we demonstrated further improvement in aISC as  
the operational efficiencies and increased production rates took effect. 
North Mara was again the standout performer, with an aISC of uS$733 
per ounce, which was 20% lower than 2015 driven by the increased 
production base. at Bulyanhulu, aISC fell by a further 16% to uS$1,058 
per ounce as a result of the restructuring that took place in Q4 2015.  
at Buzwagi, we saw aISC above expectation at uS$1,095 per ounce  
due to the lower ounce profile, though this was still 8% lower than 2015. 
Together, this led to a 14% fall in the headline aISC to uS$958 per 
ounce, over uS$150 per ounce lower than 2015. On an annual basis  
this now represents a 43% reduction in aISC from its peak in 2012.
The strong performance meant that we ended the year with uS$318 million 
of cash on our balance sheet, an increase of uS$85 million over the previous 
year. This includes the uS$20 million corporate tax cash prepayment, 
uS$28 million on debt repayments, uS$20 million on dividends and uS$36 
million on share-based payments as a result of the vesting of awards during 
the year. as a result, net cash on the balance sheet more doubled from 
uS$106 million, ending the year at uS$218 million.
Introduction
2016 was a landmark year for acacia as we delivered 
record Group production of 829,705 ounces, which 
was almost 100,000 ounces ahead of 2015. It also 
exceeded our initial guidance range for the year  
of 750,000 to 780,000 ounces and revised guidance 
given in October 2016 of approximately 820,000 
ounces. Performance was driven by North Mara, 
where the mine had a record year, and at Bulyanhulu, 
which registered its highest production year for ten 
years, testament to the work we have undertaken  
to turn the asset around.

Our business has been transformed over the 
past few years as we have redesigned each  
of our assets.
a key part of our strategy has 
been to ensure that each of our 
assets is set up to deliver to their 
potential. at Bulyanhulu, this has 
meant changing the mining 
method to a modern mechanised 
way of mining, which is both safer 
and more productive. at North 
Mara, we have converted one of 
our open pits, Gokona, into an 
underground operation, which has 
significantly outperformed in its 
first full year of operations. at 
Buzwagi, we have looked at how to 
optimise a short life and extended 
mining until the end of 2017, with 
stockpile treatment for at least 
two further years. Together, these 
changes have driven a step 
change in production and similar 
reduction in costs.

Acacia Rainbow 
Programme
18 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 Total revenue for the year amounted to uS$1,054 million, which was 21% 
ahead of 2015 as a result of the increased production profile and the 
uS$86 per ounce higher average realised gold price. EBITDa was similarly 
strong at uS$415 million, up from uS$175 million in 2015. We had net 
earnings of uS$95 million, which were primary impacted by a uS$69.9 
million provision as a result of historic tax cases, but were still significantly 
ahead of 2015’s loss of uS$197 million. adjusted net earnings amounted 
to uS$161 million, which was uS$154 million above 2015. 
r eserves and r esources
Notwithstanding the strengthening of the gold price in 2016, we have taken 
the decision to maintain the 2015 gold price assumptions in our Reserve  
and Resource calculations. This not only brings consistency of planning  
on an annual basis but it also helps underpin the financial robustness of our 
long-term planning. Our Reserve pricing is maintained at uS$1,100 per ounce 
and our Resource pricing has been maintained at uS$1,400 per ounce. 
On a Group basis, our overall Reserves and Resources declined by 4% 
from 28.6 million ounces to 27.5 million ounces during the year. at our 
operating mines, total Reserves and Resources declined by 861,000 
ounces, which was primarily a result of depletion. at our exploration 
properties, we had a marginal reduction of 112,000 ounces as a result 
of the inclusion of our share of the South Houndé Resource in Burkina 
Faso, which largely offset the change in the methodology of how we 
account for the Nyanzaga joint venture Resource, which has been 
converted from a large-scale low-grade Resource to a smaller high-grade 
Resource from a combined open pit and underground.
Whilst total Reserves and Resources were largely flat, Reserves fell by  
1.1 million ounces to 7.6 million ounces. In addition to depletion, this is 
largely a result of the reclassification of approximately 583,000 ounces 
of Reef 2 material at Bulyanhulu from Reserves into Inferred Resources 
as a result of the change in the required drill spacing for underlying 
Resource classifications. Prior to recent drilling programmes, the search 
radius for Reef 1 and Reef 2 was the same, with a 100 metre search 
radius around each drill hole used for indicated Resources (which can 
then be converted into a probable Reserve) and a 200 metre search 
radius used for Inferred material. Following the recent drilling, the 
variography has shown that due to the different geometries of the Reef 2 
series, the 100 metre search radius is not appropriate and has been 
reduced to 50 metres. This has meant that some ounces previously 
classified as probable Reserves (based on the underlying indicated 
Resource) have now largely been moved to Inferred Resources. We are 
undertaking drilling programmes during 2017 to reduce drill spacing in 
available areas to bring material back into the indicated category and  
will continue this programme over the coming years. 
This change to the classification of Resources at Bulyanhulu, together  
with depletion, has meant that Reserves in the underground mine declined 
by 1.0 million ounces to 4.9 million ounces. However, the grade of the 
Reserves has increased from 8.85g/t in 2015 to 9.75g/t as a result  
of the change to cut-off grade calculations and the reduction in the mill 
reconciliation factor which had previously been included as a result of  
mill performance in 2015.
at North Mara, we largely replaced Reserves in the Gokona deposit despite 
mining approximately 225,000 ounces from the underground in 2016, at a 
significantly higher grade than included in the prior year Reserves 
declaration. This Reserves replacement was a result of changes to the 
underground grade control model due to our improved understanding of the 
ore body which included additional stope designs. We expect to complete 
the technical work to better estimate the future impact of the positive 
reconciliations received during 2016 in Q2 2017. as such, the results of this 
work have not yet been incorporated into the current Reserves statement.  
In the Nyabirama pit we saw depletion of 170,000 ounces during 2016,  
of which approximately 111,000 ounces were replaced as a result of grade 
control model updates. Together, this led to Reserves at North Mara falling 
by 83,000 ounces to 1.9 million ounces.
We believe that the current Reserves position at North Mara does not 
reflect the potential of either of the ore bodies at the mine and in 2017 
we are commencing extension programmes to identify new Resources 
and upgrade existing Resources at both Gokona and Nyabirama. We are 
targeting significant upgrades to the Reserves and Resources at the 
mine over the next several years as part of our target to produce more 
than 300,000 ounces per annum for at least ten years at North Mara. 
at Buzwagi, the extension of mining by a further six months led to the 
inclusion of 152,000 ounces of Resources into Reserves which meant 
that the mine fully replaced Reserves. Buzwagi now has 6.0 million tonnes 
of in-pit Reserves at 1.7 grams per tonne which will be mined during 2017, 
with lower-grade material stockpiled for processing in 2018 and beyond.
discovery
We had a very positive year in exploration and in February 2017 we were 
able to announce the maiden Inferred Resource at the Liranda Corridor 
on the West Kenya Project. We believe the Resource of 1.31 million 
ounces at 12.1g/t, one of the highest-grade projects in africa, is the first 
step in delineating a multi-million ounce Resource at the project and are 
targeting increasing the Resource to over 2 million ounces during 2017.
We also made progress in West africa and continued to expand our  
land package on the highly prospective Houndé Belt in Burkina Faso.  
We now have a licence area of 2,700 square kilometres through four 
joint ventures which provides access to 125 strike kilometres on the 
belt. as part of this programme we have completed the first stage of  
the earn-in on the South Houndé joint venture with Sarama Resources  
and as a result now own 50% of the joint venture and have taken over 
operatorship of the project. Due to this we have consolidated 50% of  
the 2.1 million ounce Inferred Resource on the project into our Resource 
statement. In Mali, we took our first steps in exploring the licences we 
have acquired with promising initial results and will continue to look to 
expand our land package on the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. 
The joint venture with OreCorp Limited to progress our Nyanzaga Project 
in Tanzania continues to move forward. OreCorp took over management 
of the project for a three-year period in late 2015. This structure allows 
the project to be progressed whilst giving acacia the optionality to 
maintain a 75% stake in the project once it reaches a development 
decision. During the year, OreCorp completed a scoping study on the 
project which outlined a combined open pit and underground project  
that produces 2.4 million ounces of gold over a 13-year life at an aISC  
of uS$798/oz and requires pre-production capital of uS$248 million 
(inclusive of contingency). OreCorp are now undertaking a pre-feasibility 
study which is due to be completed in the coming months.

Safety
Safety performance during 2016 was disappointing as regrettably in January 
2016 one of our contractors at North Mara passed away as a result of a 
haul truck accident. We also saw an increase in our total reportable injury 
frequency rate (‘TRIFR’) of 9% to 0.74. This was driven by an increase at 
Bulyanhulu, although we saw an improvement in safety performance in the 
fourth quarter at the mine. Despite these disappointing results we did see 
areas of improvement, with Buzwagi’s TRIFR reducing by 44%, as we fully 
embedded our behavioural safety programme, “Tunajali” or “WeCare”, into 
the business and at North Mara we saw safety performance remaining in 
line with 2015 levels despite the increased level of complexity of operations. 
We also saw a 46% reduction in the number of high potential incidents 
(incidents that could under slightly different circumstances have led to a 
fatality or permanent disability). We continue to target zero injuries and 
having every person going home safely every day.
operating environment
as a major contributor to the Tanzanian economy we were pleased to  
be able to increase our fiscal contribution during 2016 through incurring 
a corporate tax charge amounting to uS$55 million. This was a result  
of the strong performance at North Mara and included our agreement  
to pre-pay uS$20 million of cash corporate taxes. Our increase in tax 
payments, when added to royalties of uS$47 million, payroll taxes of 
uS$40 million and other taxes of approximately uS$20 million, provides 
a significant contribution to the Tanzanian Government’s aim of 
self-funding the national budget. 
During 2016 there have continued to be a number of tax cases that  
are being dealt with in the court system in Tanzania which we are seeking  
to resolve. as communicated earlier in the year, we recorded a tax provision 
of uS$69.9 million in respect of historic capital deductions at Bulyanhulu, 
North Mara and Tulawaka as a result of a Court of appeal ruling. We are also 
dealing with claims to levy taxes in Tanzania on the uK registered acacia 
Mining plc which we believe have no basis in law given this company is tax 
resident and permanently established in the uK. Given the materiality of the 
amounts being claimed, we are also addressing a constructive resolution of 
these issues as part of our ongoing engagement with the Tanzania Revenue 
authority (‘TRa’) as well as at a senior level in the Government.
During the year we also saw a build-up in the total indirect tax receivables 
from uS$110.2 million as at 31 December 2015 to uS$136.4 million as at 
31 December 2016. The increase was mainly due to a significant delay in 
VaT refunds in the second half of 2016 as a result of ongoing audits by the 
TRa on submitted VaT. We continue to engage with the TRa in order that 
they approve the payment of outstanding amounts as well as returning to 
the previously agreed timeline of three months for dealing with ongoing 
claims for refund.
outlook
The Group delivered another year of strong performance in 2016 and  
we expect that we will further improve on this in 2017 with production 
increasing to between 850,000 to 900,000 ounces at a lower aISC of 
between uS$880 to uS$920 per ounce. Cash costs per ounce are also 
expected to decline from uS$640 per ounce to between uS$580 to 
uS$620 per ounce in 2017. We expect production to increase through 
the year and as such we expect a production ratio of 45:55 in terms  
of the first half versus the second half of the year, which will have a 
commensurate impact on our cost profile and our cash generation. 
The further improvement in operating metrics is primarily driven by the 
revision to the mine plan at Buzwagi, where mining has been extended  
by approximately six months. This will lead to the mining of approximately 
2 million tonnes more of higher-grade ore during 2017 than previously 
planned and will drive a step up of approximately 40% in production over 
2016 and a reduction in aISC of up to 30%. 
at Bulyanhulu, we expect production to be in line with the previous year 
and aISC to reduce by up to 5%. We expect to see a reduction in cash 
costs, but will see an increase in sustaining capital as we invest to 
enhance the operation of the process plant and undertake a targeted 
fleet renewal programme to improve operating efficiencies amongst the 
older equipment within the underground fleet. We will continue to invest 
in underground development and in support of this will be upgrading 
ventilation and paste line infrastructure as we focus on creating greater 
flexibility underground. This investment in core infrastructure is a critical 
element in optimising the value delivery from this long life, high-grade 
asset in combination with continuing to drive cost savings and improve 
mining efficiencies.
North Mara performed ahead of expectations during 2016 and as a 
result we expect production to reduce by up to 10% during 2017 as an 
increased proportion of underground ore is sourced from the lower-grade 
West Zone which will offset the impact of the increase in underground 
tonnes mined. The reduction in production, together with an increase in 
capital spend as we invest in the delivery of increased underground 
mining rates, together with a step up in open pit waste stripping will 
mean that aISC will increase by up to 10%.
as a result of the investments into both Bulyanhulu and North Mara 
outlined above we expect to see capital expenditure in 2017 of between 
uS$210 to uS$230 million. This is comprised of approximately uS$75  
to uS$85 million of sustaining capital, uS$120 to uS$130 million of 
capitalised development/stripping and uS$15 million of expansion 
capital, made up predominantly of capitalised drilling at North Mara  
as we look to delineate additional Resources to support a ten-year life  
of mine producing in excess of 300,000 ounces per annum. 
as previously indicated, we plan to increase our greenfield exploration 
spend to approximately uS$25 million, as we look to build on the 
excellent progress made in Kenya during 2016 and we step up our 
exploration activity in Burkina Faso and Mali on our expanded land 
packages there. 
Finally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their commitment, 
enthusiasm and hard work throughout what has been a year of continued 
delivery at acacia. We have made further progress on the journey to 
making acacia a leader in africa and I am looking forward to an even 
better year in 2017. I would also like to thank our Board for their support 
and guidance through the year.

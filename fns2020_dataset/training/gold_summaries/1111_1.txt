STRATEGIC REPORT
ChIEf ExECUTIVE’S REVIEW
•	 Revenues ahead by £2.3m (2.0%) 
to £114.7m (2013: £112.4m).
•	 Another good performance from Laminates 
and further progress at Foils Europe.
•	 Holographics back to breakeven in final 
quarter, Foils Americas operating margin 
maintained, but lower revenues.
•	 Profit before tax unchanged at 
£5.6m (2013: £5.6m).
Overall financial results
Group revenues for the twelve months 
to March 2014 increased by 2.0%, at 
both actual and constant FX rates, 
to £114.7m (2013: £112.4m). Sales 
volumes were higher by 2.7%, with 
second half volumes up 7.1% on the 
prior year compensating for a small 
decline in the first six months. 
In spite of the higher sales levels, 
added value margin declined slightly 
due to sales mix between the business 
units, the impact of less favourable 
exchange rates and higher levels 
of production scrap at Laminates. 
This, together with slightly higher 
variable costs, more than offset the 
contribution from higher sales to 
leave pre-exceptional operating profits 
down by 4.8% at £7.4m (2013: £7.8m). 
Operating margin was also lower, by 
0.4%, at 6.5%.
At segment level, full year profits 
advanced at Laminates (£0.2m) and 
Foils Europe (£0.1m) on the back of 
stronger volumes. Holographics losses 
increased by £0.4m, due to lower 
external sales, and Foils Americas 
profits declined by £0.2m, due to 
lower activity in the last quarter. 
Further details are provided in the 
divisional review on pages 10 to 25.
INTRODUCTION
In spite of a slightly weaker profit 
performance, results for the year 
demonstrate further strengthening 
of the Group’s financial position 
combined with continued investment 
in the operating assets of the business.
A number of key operational 
improvement projects were completed 
and, as the next step in this process, 
the Board has approved significant 
capital investment in additional 
capacity for the foils businesses. 
Managing this programme, along with 
the continued roll-out of the Group’s 
new ERP solution and building on the 
improved profit performance achieved 
in the second half of the year just 
ended, comprise the key operational 
agenda items for the year ahead. 09

  Shareholder Information
In a reversal of the pattern experienced 
in the last two years and as anticipated 
in our interim results statement, 
profitability improved significantly 
in the second half; up £0.5m (+15%) 
on the first half. Progress at Foils 
Europe (+£0.3m) and reduced losses 
at Holographics (+£0.4m), as a result 
of cost reduction measures, more 
than compensated for the weaker 
second half at Foils Americas (-£0.4m). 
Operating margin for the second half 
improved to 6.9% compared to 6.1% 
in the first half. 
For the year as a whole, profit 
before tax was unchanged, at £5.6m; 
although a small tax charge led to 
a marginal fall in diluted earnings 
per share to 7.1p (2013:7.2p).
Exceptional costs of £0.7m 
(2013: £1.0m) have been separately 
disclosed and relate to one-off 
costs and expenses associated 
with organisational change in three 
business units. Interest costs, including 
the new IAS 19 pension interest 
charge, were £0.1m lower at £1.1m 
(2013: £1.2m). On a pre-exceptional 
basis, profit before tax was 4.5% 
lower at £6.3m (2013: 6.6m) and 
diluted earnings per share were 7.8p, 
compared to 8.4p for the prior year.
Cash from operations, post 
exceptional items, converted at 91% of 
EBITDA (2013: 86%), with a net cash 
inflow of £2.8m compared to £1.2m 
for the previous year. 
Whilst cash capital expenditure of 
£3.5m was lower than the previous 
year (2013: £5.3m) capital additions 
still represented 1.4 times depreciation 
and will remain above depreciation for 
at least another two years as additional 
capacity is introduced into the Foils 
businesses. The Group completed 
its investment in the Czech Joint 
Venture after a further £0.5m transfer 
of funds on top of the £0.4m paid 
last year. With working capital broadly 
unchanged, the Group reported a 
small net cash position at the financial 
year end of £0.2m (2013: £2.6m debt).
Outlook
The Board expects a continuation of 
the second half trading momentum, 
with progression in results for the 
first half and for the financial year as 
a whole. 
At this stage, it is unclear how long 
Foils Americas will be affected by 
the reduced demand from metallic 
pigment customers, but any impact 
on the Group’s results should be more 
than compensated by the elimination 
of trading losses at Holographics and 
the benefit of last year’s restructuring 
at Foils Europe.
In respect of general market 
conditions, Foils Europe continues 
to experience steady overall 
demand, whereas recent activity in 
the decorative foils market in North 
America appears somewhat slower 
than usual. At Laminates, the new 
financial year has started strongly 
and there is a good pipeline of new 
business development projects.
Management is pressing ahead with 
its operational improvement and 
growth agenda, including the roll-out 
of the Group’s new ERP platform and 
investments in additional capacity for 
the Foils businesses. These initiatives 
will strengthen API’s ability to service 
customers in key markets and 
enhance the Group’s prospects over 
the medium term.
The Strategic Report as set out on 
pages 7 to 33 has been reviewed and 
approved by the Board of directors.

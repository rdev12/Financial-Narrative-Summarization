INDITHERM at a glance
Based near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, Inditherm designs and manufactures heating solutions
using the Company’s innovative low voltage polymer. The technology provides a flexible heating
surface that can produce uniform working heat output to +120°C, powered by a low voltage
(typically 24v) power supply . Applications for the technology are wide spread, though the business
is initially focused on key markets which will enable the establishment of a premium brand 
for heated products. To achieve this goal the Company is organised into the following 
operating groups. 
Specialises in heating solutions for critical temperature management and frost protection for
pipelines and storage containers. Principal markets include confectionery, utilities, food and
chemical processing. Inditherm provides a complete solution of design, build and installation.

and wound treatment, plus the recently launched Speedheat range of physiotherapy products.
In partnership with Pegasus Ltd, the Inditherm range of Operating Theatre products combine
effective patient warming performance with reduced operating costs to hospitals throughout 
the UK.

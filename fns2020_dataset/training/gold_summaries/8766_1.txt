Jessops plc
Annual report and financial
statements 2004
1978-1981
1978 Company re-located to
Hinckley Road in Leicester
to become the world’s
largest photographic store.
1979 Jessops invested in the
complete computerisation
of the business.
Began manufacturing and
marketing studio flash
equipment under the
Powerflash brand.
1981 The first branch store of
Jessops was opened in
Finchley Road, North London.
During the next six years 
a further 18 stores were
opened.
Continuing our track record of strong sales
2004 was another strong year for Jessops and
our results show the continuing impact of growing
consumer demand for digital photography
p r oducts. Our expanding store portfolio and
marketing effort have incr eased awa reness of
the Jessops brand and of our offer of value for
money , impartial advice and the widest range
of photographic products, placing Jessops at
the forefr ont of the digital camera revolution.
Sales for the year to 30 September wer e u p 1 1 % to £319 million and up 6.1% on a p roforma
like-for -like basis. EBIT A w a s u p 1 4 % t o £19.5
million, a new record for the Company . Jessops
was a venture capital owned business thr oughout
the financial period and the Gr oup’ s financial
structur e, and ther efor e inter est charges,
r eflected this. After exceptional items, goodwill
amortisation and inter est charges, the Gr o u p r ecor ded a p r ofit befor e tax of £1.3 million.
These excellent results continue our track record
of strong sales growth and demonstrate the
benefits of our strategy to increase Jessops’
p r ofile and pr esence on the high str eet. They
also r eflect the growing mass market appeal of
digital photography , a s technological impr ovements
and lower prices make digita l a mor e attractive
option for consumers.
Digital sales growth
Jessops’ share o f the digital camera market is
weighted towar d s m o r e sophisticated cameras,
with a higher megapixel capacity , wher e our
commitment to offering consumers unbiased
advice, high levels of customer service and
value for money are particularly important to
customers. Digital camera sales represented over
75% of all cameras sold by Jessops in the year
and this in turn has driven sales of digital-r elated
accessories, har dwar e and printing services.
T otal camera sales in the year incr eased by 14%
to £150 million, representing 47% of tur nover . Sales of accessories, hardwar e and camcorders
wer e u p more than 10% to £136 million.
Developing & Printing (D&P) increased by 5% to
£33 million and accounted for 10% of total sales.
The growth of camera phones has also been a featur e o f 2004 as technological advances have
improved camera quality . Camera phones offer a complementary product line to digital cameras
and we have significantly enhanced the range
of mobile camera phones available in our store s f r o m t h r ee to 13 handsets. These phones are
available fr o m Jessops on “pay as you go”
contracts with O2, Orange, V odafone and 3.
At the forefront of digital printing
Jessops has been at the for e f r ont of in-stor e digital
printing and, as at 30 September , had163
minilabs, capable of both analogue and digital
printing, installed in stor es acro s s t h e country . Every
Jessops store also ha s a digital kiosk, which allows
customers to download and manipulate their
digital images and send them
to the minilabs or wholesale developers for
p r ocessing.
Chief Executive’ s r eview
None of these achievements in 2004 would have been possible
without the dedication, professionalism and commitment of the
2,800 people who work for Jessops up and down the country . They ar e ambassadors for the business and it is their knowledge
and passion for photography that has been the cor nerstone of
the Jessops success story . page 5
Jessops continues to explore ways of enhancing
its D&P service and during the year undertook a trial of Instant Kiosks, which is a while you wait
kiosk allowing customers to print digital images
by inserting their memory car ds, rather than
p r ocessing through a minilab. Following this trial,
Jessops has ordered 60 Instant Kiosks, which
p r oduce a 6”x 4” colour print every 3.5 seconds.
As the digital D&P market evolves, we believe
that consumers will increasingly have a p r efer ence
for convenient, high-quality printing services
that allow them to have their images printed
in a short time, without having to give up their
memory card t o the processor . I t i s against this
background that we launched a two store trial
in the summer of a new D&P store concept called
“Jessops photoexpress”.
Using the Jessops brand values of quality , convenience and value for money , Jessops
photoexpress will of fer digital and analogue
photo pr ocessing from high street locations.
If successful, we will develop this service further . Momentum of new store openings
In addition to the photoexpr ess s tore openings,
we continued to pro g r ess our core store
expansion programme, adding a further
14 Jessops stores in the period. We ended the
financial year with a total of 262 stores located
a c r oss the UK. These stores fall into five main
formats: 239 high street locations, four W orld
Camera Centres, ten out of town stores, seven
stores in retail shopping centres and two
Jessops photoexpress stores.
Our strategy is to open approximately 20 new
stores per year and we believe that we have the
opportunity to trade from up to 450 Jessops store s acr oss the UK and Ireland.
Enhanced operational efficiencies
The rapid growth of Jessops over recent years,
together with our o ngoing expansion plans l ed
to the decision, in March, to reorganise and
upgrade our distribution operations. This
involved the relocation of all warehousing
activities onto a c entral site at W eedon,
Northamptonshire, and the outsourcing of our
distribution activities to Unipart Logistics. The
transfer was completed on 6 September and
the new arrangements ar e operating well.
2004 also saw the continued development and
roll-out of our new computer system. The software
was installed within the distribution war ehouse
initially , with head of fice functions, including
finance and buying, added in November 2003.
The softwar e was upgraded to incr ease
functionality in June this year and following a successful trial in 20 stores, the new EPOS software
has commenced roll-out to all stores at a rate of
15 store s p e r week. W e expect to have all
stores fully converted before the end of 2005.

Industry recognition
W e wer e delighted once again to r eceive the
awar d for Best Photo Retailer Of The Y e a r 2004
fr om Practical Photography and Digital Photo
magazines. It was the 9th year in succession
that we have r eceived this awar d, and it was
accompanied by their Best Photo Pr ocessor
Of The Y ear 2004, the second year running
we have r eceived this awar d . Both are r ecognition of the importance we
place on customer service and most pleasingly
ar e voted for by readers of these magazines.
People 
None of these achievements in 2004 would
have been possible without the dedication,
p r ofessionalism and commitment of the 2,800
people who work for Jessops up and down the
country . They are ambassadors for the business
and it is their knowledge and passion for
photography that has been the cor nerstone of
the Jessops success story . At the beginning of 2004 we announced that we
had linked up with a national charity for the first
time, choosing to help CLIC (Cancer and Leukaemia
in Childhood) in its fundraising efforts.
In the first year of activity we have raised a total
of £50,000 for the charity and I would like to
thank everyone who has contributed for their
support for this worthwhile cause.
Stock Market debut
At the beginning of October , w e announced
our plans to float the company on the main
market of the London Stock Exchange. Despite
uncertain stockmarket conditions for IPOs, this
p r oject was completed on 3 November 2004.
The flotation of the business achieved our two
primary objectives of raising funds to r e pay a substantial proportion of our d ebt a nd providing
a partial exit for our V enture Capital shareholders.
W e believe that the added pr ofile of being a listed company will benefit the business and we
ar e delighted that our customers and staff will
now have the opportunity to invest in the
business, should they so wish.
As part of the flotation, we welcomed Gavin
Simonds to the Board a s our new Non-executive
Chairman and W illiam Rollason, as a new
independent Non-executive Dir ector , with a further
new Non-executive Dir ector planned to join in
due c ourse. Their combined plc, management
and financial experience in large service businesses
will be of enormous benefit to Jessops as we
embark on this new and exciting phase in our
development and I look forward t o working
with them.
They replace T i m B rookes, Dominic Collier and
Simon T uttle w h o stepped down from their
r espective positions a s Non-executive Chairman
and as Non-executive D i r ectors prior to the
flotation. Their good counsel, enthusiasm and
support for the Board has been of great value
over the past two years and I would like to
thank them for their contribution to the
development of the business.
Outlook and current trading
W ith our flotation now behind us and our debt
reduced to more sustainable levels, the Gr oup’ s consistently high level of conversion of ear nings
to cash flow gives us the ability to continue to
pursue our gr owth strategy . Market forecasters
ar e p r edicting that the digital camera market
continues to offer considerable growth potential.
Household penetration levels for digital cameras
ar e still considerably below those for analogue
cameras and technological innovations are
shortening the replacement cycle.
Such opportunities will, inevitably , ensur e that
the market r emains competitive, particularly at
the lower value end of the market. We ar e r eady to face these challenges and believe that
ther e i s n o single competitor that competes
acr oss the range of products we offer or who
can match the levels of staff knowledge and
customer service we provide.
T r ading i n the first two months o f t he financial
year has been encouraging and has continued
t h e t r end of last year . Thus whilst it remains
early days, we believe we ar e well positioned to
maintain our momentum and view the future
with confidence.

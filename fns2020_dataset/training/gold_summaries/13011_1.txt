Introduction 
 
I am pleased to announce RDF Group’s fourth successive year of revenue growth. Whilst I am 
disappointed at the small post-tax loss incurred in the year, your Board and I are pleased that the 
decisions that we took in December 2007 and January 2008 have significantly reduced the impact of one 
of the Managed Services division’s major customers being adversely affected by the credit crunch.  
 
Financial Results 
 
Revenue has increased by over 37.2% to £30.489m (2007: £22.227m). Operating profit, before 
amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items was £0.968m (2007: £1.402m) and the overall operating 
profit was £0.162m (2007: £1.193m). 
 
The exceptional items referred to were all related to the Managed Services business and are discussed in 
more detail below and in note 4 to the financial statements. 
 
Review of Operations and Key Performance Indicators 
 
Managed Services 
The year started very well with a number of new business wins, an increase in demand for our services 
and new contracts being awarded from two of our major customers. Throughout the first half, your 
Board were very confident of achieving not only record growth in terms of turnover in this division but 
also in terms of contribution to the Group’s profits. The Board was also focussed on developing a broader 
client base in order to spread the financial risks of this side of the business as well as fully leveraging the 
significant investment in infrastructure and an expanded management team. 
 
In September 2007, one of our major clients had an unprecedented collapse in its business model. As a 
result, the agreement previously reached was renegotiated following lengthy discussions with senior 
management within the client. Your Board took the decision to fully support the client and as a result 
RDF remains one of a much smaller group of suppliers to that business with strong relationships and a 
longer term contractual commitment.  Had the Board not taken this supportive action, the exceptional 
costs of unrecoverable “down time” of £326,000 would have resulted in staff redundancies and a much 
smaller business unit (less viable for disposal or for future development within the Group). 
  
Overall the division generated revenues of £10.426m (2007: £9.858m) and contributed an operating 
profit, before amortisation of intangible assets and goodwill, of £5,000 (2007: £357,000).  Exceptional 
costs of £510,000 were incurred, detailed in note 4 to the financial statements, and amortisation of 
intangible assets totalled £224,000 (2007: £75,000), including an accelerated charge of £75,000. Overall 
the division incurred a loss before interest and tax of £729,000. 
 
Recruitment Services 
The Recruitment Services division continues to grow strongly with revenues up by 62.2% on the previous 
year to £20.063m (2007: £12.369m). The division continues to win new business from existing clients and 
to develop new clients. During the financial year, this division billed over 150 clients. 
 
The temporary contract side of the division has income of £18.792m (2007: £11.722m) but margins have 
fallen slightly to 12.8% (2007: 13.1%), reflecting tightening market conditions. The permanent placement 
side has also grown significantly with income up to £1.271m (2007: £0.647m). 
 
Overall, the division contributed profit before amortisation of intangible assets of £1.340m (2007: 
£1.391m) and a profit before interest and tax of £1.268m (2007: £1.379m).

Corporate Social Responsibility 
 
Your Board is aware that business can have a significant impact on the community and, being a company 
built on our staff, I feel that it important to support local and national organisations as part of our 
corporate social responsibility. 
 
As discussed in last year’s report, the Group became the major sponsor for Sussex County Cricket Club in 
2007. This has proved to be a great success for both the Club and RDF. In 2007 the team won the County 
Championship for the second successive year and for the third time in five years. This success on the 
field meant that RDF had extensive coverage in many local, regional and national newspapers, as well as 
on television and radio. Your Board is very pleased with the agreement, which lasts for three years, and 
is expecting to continue to build awareness of the Group’s brand and services.  
 
In addition to the Sussex County Cricket Club sponsorship, each branch is able to sponsor local charities 
and employees are encouraged to match the contributions with personal donations. 
 
Future Developments 
 
As mentioned in the Chairman’s Statement, the Board has taken the decision to sell the Group’s 
Managed Services division if an acceptable price can be achieved.  The Board remains confident in the 
future of the Managed Services division in the medium to long term.  However, the Board’s strategic 
decision has been driven by:  
 
• the recent growth and significant contribution that has been achieved by the Recruitment Services 
division, and 
• the investment required in terms of staff, infrastructure and working capital to produce significant 
growth in the Managed Services division at a time when the Group is not in a position to seek new 
external investment. 
 
In the event that the Managed Services division is not sold, the Board will continue to invest in it, 
utilising the profits generated from the Recruitment division. 
 
In the last quarter of the financial year, the Group returned positive results.  However, as previously 
mentioned in the Chairman’s Statement the economic climate remains uncertain and your Board does 
not expect the growth rates achieved in the last few years to continue on an organic basis. 
 
Finally, I would like to thank our staff for their work and commitment to your company over the last 
year. For many, the uncertainty created during the credit crisis at one of our major clients was very 
worrying, but, despite this, they have continued to work to the highest levels of ability and dedication.

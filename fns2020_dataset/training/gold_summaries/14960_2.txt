 Operational Performance

Highlights
We achieved our 2012 objectives in full, as Strategic Minerals
transitioned from project developer to magnetite supplier to
the global marketplace as operations at our Cobre stockpile
moved into full-scale production.  Sales to United States
domestic customers at mine gate commenced in 2012 and our
first export shipment was completed in November.

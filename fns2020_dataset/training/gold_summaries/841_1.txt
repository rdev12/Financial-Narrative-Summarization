These results confirm the transformation
of AMEC from its history in traditional
construction to a focus on services, with
two-thirds of total operating profit 
now generated by Services and
Investments activities.
After the difficult markets of 2002 and
much of 2003, AMEC has not only returned
to earnings growth, but has reached the
end of this testing time in good shape and
is well positioned to maintain momentum
in earnings growth.
Further strategic restructuring took place,
together with acquisitions and disposals in
the year . The acquisition of the outstanding
54 per cent interest in SPIE strengthened
AMEC’ s position in Continental Europe, whilst
the subsequent disposal of a majority stake
in Spie Batignolles, the France-based
regional construction business, demonstrated
a focus on higher value-added services.
Growth in earnings resumed during 2003,
despite continuing weakness in industrial
markets generally and poor performance
in the US Construction Management
business. Pre-tax profit increased by seven
per cent to £112.5 million and was in line
with the board’s expectations, established
in December 2002. Average weekly net
debt during 2003 increased to £360 million,
largely reflecting the net cash impact of
acquiring SPIE.
Market sectors
Total turnover in AMEC’s market sectors
was as follows:
2003* 2002*
£ billion £ billion
Regional Services 1.3 0.7 
Oil and Gas 1.2 0.8 
Transport 0.8 0.7 
Infrastructure 0.6 0.5 
Industrial 0.5 0.7 
4.4 3.4 
Full consolidation of SPIE for 10 months
of 2003 makes year-on-year comparisons
difficult. Following the acquisition of the
outstanding 54 per cent interest in SPIE,
Regional Services becomes AMEC’s
largest market sector, with annualised
total turnover in 2003 of some £1.4 billion. 
North American industrial markets
Since 1 January 2004, AMEC has either
been awarded contracts or has been
confirmed as preferred bidder on projects
expected to be worth about £100 million.
Levels of front-end activity in North
America are ahead of this time last year,
with the dollar value of feasibility studies
currently being worked on up by over 50
per cent. The directors expect that this
will lead to an improvement in industrial
activities during the course of 2004, but
timing remains difficult to predict.
Iraq
AMEC is now working in Iraq on the
restoration of damaged power generation,
transmission and distribution systems,
acting as prime subcontractor to 
Fluor on task orders currently worth
US$140 million under the CETAC II
contract. AMEC will share the profit 
from this work with Fluor on a 49 per
cent: 51 per cent basis.
Through the AMEC Fluor LLC joint venture,
AMEC is actively bidding for seven “second
round” contracts in various sectors, including
power and water, that are expected to 
be worth some US$4 billion. AMEC is also
bidding for task orders worth about US$140
million under AMEC Earth and Environment’ s
AFCEE contract. The outcome of these
various bids, all of which are on a cost-
reimbursable basis, is anticipated during
March or early April 2004.
Safety remains of paramount importance
and all activity in Iraq calls for absolute
vigilance. To this end, AMEC continues to
invest considerable effort in implementing
detailed safety arrangements for its
involvement in Iraq. 
Rail
On 24 October 2003, Network Rail
announced that it was to take all UK 
rail maintenance activities in-house. 
The announcement affected AMEC’s 
two infrastructure maintenance contracts
in the West Anglia and Sussex regions,
which together generated total turnover
of some £130 million and a margin of
about five per cent in 2003. AMEC now
expects these two contracts to be
transferred by 24 July 2004 and is presently
negotiating compensation with Network
Rail. No material impact on 2004 group
performance is anticipated.
Although disappointed to be losing its UK
rail maintenance activities, representing
around a quarter of its total turnover in
rail, AMEC has a wide range of railway
infrastructure skills and remains
committed to the UK market. AMEC
remains confident that, with its ongoing
activities in the UK and its secure position
in France, the rail business has excellent
prospects, not least in the fast developing
European urban light rail market. 
Wind energy
AMEC is one of the leading UK wind
energy development companies.  
AMEC’s business covers all aspects 
of design, delivery, finance and operations
and has a strong track record in both
onshore and offshore development,
together with a portfolio of 17 evelopments
being worked on at present. This means
AMEC has the potential to deliver more
than 1,000 MW of operational assets 
by 2010. With its completed, early-phase
developments sold off to utility companies,
AMEC is now exploring opportunities for 
a long-term investment position in the
larger wind energy projects, building on
its experience in PPP and property
development.

In the offshore wind sector, AMEC was
awarded two licences in the recent UK
government grant. These will be developed
with Centrica, with whom AMEC continues
to work on the Lynn development, a first
round licence, the rights for which it recently
acquired from AMEC. This market provides
prospects for a substantial business to
emerge for AMEC in the future.
Order book
The year-end order book, excluding
Regional Services and non-core activities
in UK rail maintenance, Spie Batignolles
and US Construction Management, stood
at £3.0 billion (2002: £2.7 billion). 
As expected, industrial orders declined
over the period, but were offset by an
increase in infrastructure orders. Oil and
gas and transport orders were maintained,
with order intake having been matched by
the high levels of activity in the year . 
Regional Services activities are characterised
by large numbers of small, short-term
contracts with the relationship between
order intake and total turnover providing 
a more meaningful indicator of prospects
than the absolute level of order book. 
In 2003, order intake exceeded sales by 
seven per cent (2002: three per cent).
Strategy
The board’s overall aims are:
Continued growth in the proportion 
of earnings from higher margin 
services activities
Increased volume of business with
existing clients and
Continued development of the 
business portfolio. 
Continued growth in the proportion 
of earnings from higher margin 
services activities
During 2003, AMEC improved its 
services capability and geographical
spread through a number of acquisitions
including SPIE, and, through SPIE, the
French oil services company Ipedex.
Ipedex’s presence in West Africa was a
key factor in securing the first two year
maintenance contract for Shell’s Bonga
facility and provides a good example of
group cross selling and project delivery
leading to a services contract.
The acquisition of the assets of Kamtech
enables AMEC to offer a wider range 
of services to North American clients 
in the forest industry and power sectors, 
to whom it had previously offered only a
consulting and design service. Not only
can AMEC now provide clients with a more
integrated project delivery service, but it 
is also better placed to increase services
activities in the maintenance and repair
side of the industrial sector .
The North American and European regional
services markets are fragmented, providing
significant opportunities for growth through
increased geographical spread. During
2003, AMEC strengthened the position of
its Denver operation as a regional water
resources hub, whilst in Continental
Europe, SPIE continued to strengthen 
its network of over 300 locations through
the acquisition of six new businesses in
France, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain. Further such geographical
expansion is anticipated in 2004.
Increased volume of business 
with existing clients
Through developing its portfolio of
services and increasing its geographical
spread, AMEC aims to secure a greater
share of existing clients’ annual spend
across all areas of activity, from consulting
and design through project delivery to
support services.
During 2003, AMEC strengthened 
its relationships with major clients
including Shell, the UK Ministry of
Defence, BAA and Network Rail through
the award of major long-term services
contracts. The aggregate value of these
contracts is expected to be over £1 billion,
although only £440 million has been
recorded in the order book, reflecting
AMEC’s policy of only booking value 
up to the first potential break point 
in the contract. 
In addition, AMEC reached agreements
with important clients including the 
US Air Force Center for Environmental
Excellence, GlaxoSmithKline, EADS and
INEOS Chlor Enterprises (China), which
are on a call-off basis, but where real
value is expected to be secured over 
the next few years. 
Continued development of the 
business portfolio 
Over the last few years, AMEC has pursued
a strategy of substantially downsizing its
US Construction Management business,
which has made it possible for AMEC now
to consider various strategic options. 
A strategic review of this business is 
well advanced and is expected to be
concluded shortly.
In September 2003, AMEC announced 
the disposal of a majority holding in the
French regional construction business,
Spie Batignolles, which had generated
total turnover of about £500 million in
2000. This transaction reduces AMEC's
overall risk profile and results in greater
focus on engineering services and higher
margin project delivery activity, where
there is the ability to add value through
consultancy, design and project
management services. 
AMEC will continue to expand its
geographical coverage and invest in
growth markets such as wind energy 
and PPP . More will be done to fill in 
the value chain, through investing in
businesses that help AMEC provide 
a more integrated service and project
management capability to a greater
number of clients in a wider range 
of growing end markets.
Outlook
AMEC’s oil and gas, transport and
infrastructure markets remain steady,
and there are important new opportunities
in Iraq. 
Despite continuing uncertainty in
industrial markets, the board is confident
that AMEC will make further progress in
2004 and, at this early stage, is maintaining
its earlier expectations for the year .
In summary, AMEC starts 2004 in good
shape, having achieved further strategic
restructuring with acquisitions and
disposals over the last 12 months. With
these developments and the first signs 
of recovery in industrial markets in North
America, AMEC is well positioned to
maintain momentum in earnings in the
coming year . The company’s strategy 
for growth will increase focus on higher
margin services and project delivery
activity only where AMEC has the ability 
to add value, whilst reducing its overall
risk profile. The end result is expected 
to be a better quality of earnings.

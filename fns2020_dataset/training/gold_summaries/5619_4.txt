essar energy at a glance
2010 saw the creation 
of Essar Energy as the 
holding company for the 
Essar Group’s power and 
oil and gas interests. 
Essar Energy was listed on the 
main market of the London Stock 
Exchange through an initial public 
offering which raised US$1.9 billion 
gross proceeds (US$1.8 billion 
net proceeds) and at that time 
was the largest primary offering in 
the London market since 2007 . 
Subsequent to the Listing, Essar 
Energy entered the FTSE 100 on 
21 June 2010. Essar Energy also 
entered the MSCI UK index on 30 
November 2010 and on 1 December 
2010, Futures and options contracts 
were made available for trading 
on LIFFE CONNECT
®
 and within 
Bclear. These events have created 
additional interest in the shares of 
Essar Energy and we have seen 
an increase in the liquidity of the 
Company’s shares since Listing.
The Company’s strategy is clear; 
to create a world-class, low cost 
Indian energy company, positioned 
to capitalise on India’s rapidly 
growing energy demand. While the 
focus is on India, Essar Energy will 
also pursue opportunities overseas 
which support our strategy and 
deliver value to its shareholders.

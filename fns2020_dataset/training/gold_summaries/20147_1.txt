 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
SUMMARY
 - Multiple framework renewals secured 
with major customers
 - Strengthened technical capability 
and R&D
 - Introduced innovative solutions, 
aimed at reducing customers’ carbon 
footprint and operational expenditure
We continued to make progress on our 
strategy implementation and the goals set 
out in last year’s report: 
 - improve customer service;
 - increase technical capability;
 - empower management;
 - secure positive outcomes from contract 
negotiations and renewals;
 - develop new lines of business 
and diversify client base; and
 - preserve cash.
The performance and progress on the first 
four points has been good, as evidenced in 
our operational headlines. Establishing new 
lines of business and preserving cash 
remain priorities. 
We have strengthened our sales and marketing 
functions, consolidated many operations into 
a single location in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, unified 
the brand under the 21
st
 Century banner and 
currently operate through two segments: 
Passenger Systems and Fleet Systems. 
Principal activities
The Group’s principal activities are being a 
specialist provider of tailored solutions to 
the transport community, solving complex 
operational requirements both on and off 
the vehicle. 
Fleet Systems solutions include video 
surveillance to improve passenger and driver 
safety, vehicle and driver performance 
monitoring and automatic passenger counting.
Passenger Systems information solutions 
include the necessary hardware and software 
for electronic passenger information systems, 
off-vehicle smart ticketing and wayfinding.
Business model
The business model is to compete in the 
market as an open provider of technology 
solutions, working with global-scale product 
companies and local specialists to deliver 
highly reliable and cost-effective solutions for 
the transport community over the lifecycle 
of the systems. The service offering includes 
design, tailoring, installation, on-site support 
and back-office systems.
We compete by striving to offer better 
integrated solutions at reduced costs to our 
customers. We carefully select niche markets 
where we can generate significant market 
share to generate the economies of scale 
needed. Our customers in the transport 
community include fleet operators, vehicle 
manufacturers, local authorities and 
Passenger Transport Executives (PTE).

Fleet Systems
In the bus sector we continue to support 
Arriva, First UK Bus, Keolis, Translink and 
Nobina, our major fleet asset clients. We 
were delighted that First UK Bus renewed its 
framework agreement for 5 years in August 
2016 and this was followed later in the 
year with a 2 year extension to the Arriva 
framework agreement with a customer option 
of an additional year extension through to 
February 2019. These commitments are 
tangible endorsements of the value we 
deliver to our major fleet customers.
Major projects completed in the year included:
 - vehicle power systems upgrade to 1,800 
vehicles for a large bus fleet customer;
 - fleet-wide deployment of IP and cloud-
based bus CCTV and Wi-Fi solution; and
 - the design and supply of 130 ruggedised 
digital video recorders for one of London’s 
light rail services to satisfy an urgent 
operational requirement.
Our development initiative to enter the 
market for small and medium-sized vehicle 
operators had some success in specialist 
niche applications towards the end of the 
year and this is where we plan to concentrate 
in future. Notable contract wins included:
 - a c. £1m contract to upgrade CCTV and 
associated equipment for an Antipodean 
bus operation; and
 - a landmark project for OF J Connections 
Gatwick Airport to provide integrated 
real-time passenger information and 
connected bus systems, with ongoing 
support, at c. £1m. 
I am particularly pleased with the Gatwick 
order as it is the first example of 21
st
 Century 
combining its Fleet and Passenger Systems’ 
design capabilities. A major rationale for our 
acquisition of the Passenger Systems business 
was the potential to enter new markets. In this 
case we were able to offer an innovative and 
cost-effective solution which delivers real 
operational benefits to our operator customer 
and in turn enhances the passenger travel 
experience for its customers. 
Our core strength in rail is mainly in CCTV 
technology and engineering where we have 
market leading solutions for both forward-
facing and in-carriage systems in freight and 
passenger rail, with associated support and 
maintenance. The year started well with the 
London light rail project mentioned above as 
well as winning the first major design contract 
for Abbey Wood, a Crossrail station. Whilst 
this design has been a success, anticipated 
follow-on orders were slower to come 
through than expected, and due to our 
capital constraints we took the decision to 
refocus on multimodal customers and their 
fleets. The withdrawal from design works 
has allowed us to move to a much lower 
cost base for our rail activities. 
At an operational level we secured renewals 
of ISO 9001, ISO 18001 and RISQS approvals 
across 2016.

Financial statements Overview Strategic report CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT continued
“ Active trials of solar-powered passenger information 
systems and working examples of E-ink displays are 
being viewed with encouraging initial feedback.”
Passenger Systems
The acquisition strategy for the division 
remains sound, as it allows us to broaden 
our customer base into the much larger PTE 
and local authority customer base where 
we can offer hardware and software design 
capabilities. While we continue to work with 
many local authorities, in our Interim Report 
we highlighted that the performance in the 
Passenger Systems business was well 
below expectations. This was the result of 
a shortfall in order intake that resulted from 
a combination of delayed or reduced spending 
by local authorities and the rebuilding of 
the sales and marketing functions following 
the acquisition. 
In order to ensure that the lower sales levels 
would no longer produce a loss we took 
immediate action to adjust the cost base and 
accelerated the integration of the Passenger 
Systems business into the wider Group. 
In the meantime, a new sales team was 
recruited, supported by an experienced interim 
Sales Director with a focus on building sales, 
exhibitions, trade PR and customer relations.
We identified maintenance of real-time 
information estates and associated data 
processing as clear areas for growth. With 
the introduction of our national service team 
we were pleased to see a 6% increase in 
maintenance revenues when annualised 
against the previous year. PTEs and local 
authorities continue to look to improve the 
travel information provided to the public and 
it is essential that the investment they have 
made in the hardware is supported by a robust 
service both on the street and in the cloud.
The business continues to drive innovation 
with a number of newly developed solutions 
designed to deliver long-term cost efficiencies 
and reduced carbon footprints. Active trials 
of solar-powered passenger information 
systems and working examples of E-ink 
displays are being viewed with encouraging 
initial feedback from our customer base.
Our developments in smart ticketing solutions 
have started to gain market traction following 
the installation of our first fully integrated 
system, iPoint, in Weston-super-Mare and 
ticket vending machines in Blackburn and 
Accrington bus stations, both of which have 
been positively received. We now have a 
platform to further develop and display our 
capabilities to the industry and have secured 
a further contract in 2017 for multiple systems.
We now have a growing pipeline of 
opportunities, greater technical capabilities, 
a lower cost base and a more appropriate 
structure on which to grow. 
Central services
We began the year comprising two separate 
businesses: Fleet Systems, our original bus 
and rail CCTV business, and Passenger 
Systems, following the acquisition of RSL 
the year before. Our plan to migrate the 
two businesses in a programme covering 
18 months was accelerated due to the 
performance issues across 2016. 
In order to reduce the cost base it was clear 
that we needed to centralise the majority 
of operations and remove any duplicated 
staffing costs. A key part was negotiating 
an early exit from the 25,000 sq ft Croydon 
facility enabling us to centralise into a new 
and more affordable head office in the 
Midlands at Ashby-de-la-Zouch.

Strategic report This has been a major reorganisation involving 
the merger and relocation of operations. Our 
new Ashby head office serves as the centre 
of our activities and is the base for all our 
sales, service and central support functions. 
We maintain a serviced office in Croydon to 
provide a local service to our important London 
customers and as a base for key staff. Our 
Coventry centre has been expanded to serve 
as our national production and logistics 
centre and we maintain offices in Stockholm 
to service our Scandinavian customers. 
Business review and results
The performance of the Group was affected 
by challenging marketing conditions leading 
to an underlying loss of £1,397k (2015: profit 
of £52k). These results were at the higher 
end of management expectations due to 
lower than expected order intake in H2, 
particularly in the Rail element of our Fleet 
Systems segment and in Passenger Systems.
Total revenue fell in the year by 6% despite 
the additional four months of Passenger 
Systems sales in its first full year where 
turnover increased 30% to £4,715k 
(2015: 8 months £3,631k). 
Basic loss per share is 2.47p (2015: loss 
per share of 5.17p).
The results include the first full year trading 
of our Passenger Systems operating segment 
(2015: eight months) and the segmental 
results as seen opposite on Table 1: 
Segmental results.
Fleet Systems sales overall were down 20%, 
with the varying reductions in the elements 
of the segment being Bus 11%, International 
23% and Rail 38%. Bus and International 
sales recovered in H2 after a poor H1 but 
Rail H2 sales were down £586k on H1 as 
no major on-board project sales were won 
in the year.
In H2 Passenger Systems sales slowed 
markedly and the small underlying loss in 
H1 of £41k finished the year at a £460k loss. 
The business was right-sized across H2 with 
significant cost-cutting, but the H2 drop in 
gross profit of £601k could not be offset.
Overall gross profit fell 14% in the year but 
again Passenger Systems increased 27% 
with the full year effect. Fleet gross profit 
was down 36% and again this was across 
all elements of the segment: Bus 19%, 
International 37% and Rail 64%. The bulk 
of the fall in Bus and International was due 
to the reduction in sales but also there was 
a reduction in gross profit margins. The 
magnitude of the margin fall in Rail was 
£686k, which came from the reduced sales 
and a margin fall from 53% in 2015 to 31% 
in the current year. The margin fall came 
about from particular lower margin projects 
and the move to design works with greater 
outsourced content and lower margins.
Underlying administrative costs increased by 
15%, which is mainly the effect of the full year 
of Passenger Systems. The overall underlying 
loss of £1,397k (2015: profit of £52k) is mainly 
attributable to the £601k margin reduction 
in H2 in Passenger Systems and the £686k 
reduction in Rail margins in Fleet Systems.
The underlying operating profit reconciles 
to the IFRS operating loss as seen below 
on Table 2: Reconciling segmental results 
to IFRS operating loss.
The operating loss before impairment was 
£2,298k (2015: £486k).

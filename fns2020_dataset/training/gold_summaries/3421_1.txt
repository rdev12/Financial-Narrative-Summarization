 Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
During the year we have made considerable progress towards our goal of becoming a leading designer, assembler and
marketer of mobile handsets in China (“PRC”). The new funding gained from the reverse acquisition has allowed ZTC to
accelerate its development of new models, the lifeblood of the business, and to implement systems that will enable the
Group to manage strong future growth.
Financial Performance
The Group’s net sales increased 63% to £22.16m (2006: £13.57m). ZTC branded mobile phones shipped increased 111%
to 512,600 (2006: 242,400) units, whilst OEM handsets produced under contract fell, in accordance with strategy, 84.7%
to 62,500 (2006: 406,900) units. 
Gross margins were 21.5%, an increase of 13.5% over the previous year. This increase was primarily driven by our ability
to rapidly introduce unique products to market, commanding higher initial margins and a relatively long shelf life, assisted
by upgrades which have sustained attractive margins. The forward purchases of certain strategic components have also
contributed to controlling production costs. 
Total administrative and general expenses increased to £1.431m (2006: £312,000) which includes non-recurring costs in
respect to the reverse acquisition and admission to trading on AIM amounting to £280,000 (2006: nil). Excluding these
costs, expenses were £1.15m. The increase in these costs is primarily attributable to two factors. Firstly the increase in
overhead relating to the listed parent company, and secondly, an increase in personnel reflecting a substantial increase in
sales and new models.
Profit before tax increased 10.9% to £2.02m (2006: £1.82m). Excluding the acquisition and admission costs, profit before
tax was £2.29m, an increase of 26.2% over 2006. Whilst Group profits increased, earnings per share decreased to 2.4p
basic and 2.3p diluted, compared to 4.2p basic and 4.2p diluted in the previous financial year. This decrease in earnings
per share is a result of the increased number of shares in issue following the reverse acquisition.
Taxation paid increased to £128,000 (2006: £2,000). This is attributable to the fact that the operating subsidiary, which is
based in the Special Economic Zone of Shenzhen, commenced payment of tax at a rate of 7.5% from 1 January 2007.
The Company receives a favourable taxation policy being located in Shenzhen, which is a Special Economic Zone.
Following this initial tax rate concession, the Company expects the tax rate of the Company’s operating subsidiary to
increase to 15% in 2010. 
Operating cash outflow for the year ended 30 June 2007 was £1.40m (2006: inflow of £1.47m) and total combined cash
and other liquid assets were £7.63m (2006: £4.10m). As at 30 June 2007, our net debt to equity ratio (gearing) was 0.29.
Cash at bank or in hand at the period end was £2.49m.
Operating Highlights
During the year under review ZTC introduced 24 new models compared to 16 in the previous period. These models
typically catered for the middle to lower end of the market with a focus on the lesser developed markets of China including
the second to fourth tier cities and rural areas.
Utilising its local knowledge and ability to bring new products rapidly to market, the Group has successfully capitalised on
a number of new consumer trends. Importantly, to diversify product portfolio risk, ZTC was able to develop a number of
successful models catering for differentiated markets.
Successfully launched handsets include:
● December 2006: ZT2688 – One of the first large screen (2.8”) models to be launched in the PRC. Initial specifications
included a camera, MP3 and MP4 players, touch screen functionality and ability to play games. This model was an
excellent performer achieving high margins. Since its introduction additional features such as Bluetooth, dual SIM
cards and ultra-long standby battery life have allowed this model to continue to have robust sales beyond the financial
year end. 
6 ● February 2007: ZT3328 – One of the first models including two SIM cards to be introduced in China. Every province
in the PRC has a separate China Mobile subsidiary resulting in significant roaming charges beyond provincial
boundaries. The dual SIM card model has effectively reduced roaming charges which has proved popular with the
ever cost conscious Chinese consumer.
● March 2007: ZT8810 – Packed with functionality such as touch display, MP3, MP4, camera (including PC camera)
and a flip light, targeted at the low end of the price market it has appealed to the youth market.
● June 2007: ZT3158 – Dual SIM card facility but with more sophisticated design and more expensive finish targeting
higher income markets than the ZT3328, which caters to much broader population.
Our People and Systems
The average number of people employed in the Group was 422 in 2007 compared to 283 in the previous year. All full time
employees are located in the PRC. The Group’s production facilities are credited with ISO9001 (2000 edition) and we
ensure that our staff are trained to meet the requirements of this standard and the technical demands of our equipment.
During the year ZTC has also invested capital and significant effort to upgrade the financial reporting procedures and
systems, which has been accompanied by significant staff training and education. These systems will provide a stable
platform to better manage the rapid growth of the Group.
Market
ZTC’s primary focus continues to be China’s domestic market. The overall mobile penetration rate was at 39.9% at the end
of the third quarter 2007 and substantially lower in the rural and less developed areas of China. The PRC now has more
than 500 million mobile phone subscribers and has witnessed an average monthly increase of 7 million new users since
the start of 2007, presenting an excellent market opportunity for ZTC.
The country is not only the largest mobile handset market worldwide but is home to approximately 50% of the global
handset production with Shenzhen a major centre. This brings to ZTC the possible exposure to benefits of scale and
centralisation of component production, design expertise and talent.
Given the current strong growth in demand for handsets both in China and the worldwide emerging markets, major
potential market opportunities are available for innovative developers in the mobile phone sector over the next few years.
We are currently evaluating a number of export opportunities primarily in emerging market countries in the Middle East,
Asia and Africa.
Outlook
At this point in time we believe the PRC will continue to experience relatively strong economic growth over the balance of
this financial year. We also anticipate that the handset market should continue to enjoy robust sales throughout the same
period.
Going forward, our strategy will continue to focus on new product development with the view to developing a balanced
portfolio, a necessity to diversifying product risk. We will also continue to concentrate on existing and new markets by
developing our marketing channels both through national and regional distributors in China with the latter focusing on the
second to fourth tier cities and rural markets. 
We look forward to demonstrating continued growth and building shareholder value in 2007/2008.

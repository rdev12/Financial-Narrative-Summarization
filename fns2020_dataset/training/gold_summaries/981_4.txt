 Our gold-copper-silver operations are located in Azerbaijan, 
which lies within the Tethyan Tectonic Belt, one of the world’s 
most significant gold and copper bearing trends that extends 
from Pakistan to the Balkans, passing through Iran, Azerbaijan, 
Georgia and Turkey.
Anglo Asian’s key operations span three Contract Areas in Azerbaijan covering 
1,062 sq km. The Company also holds three additional Contract Areas covering 
900 sq km in territories occupied by Armenia, which it hopes to develop when 
access is obtained.

Our operations
Gedabek operations
The Company operates a gold, copper and 
silver mine in western Azerbaijan, which 
produced 50,215 ounces of gold in FY 2012. 
Anglo Asian is currently building a new 
agitation leaching plant at Gedabek, which 
will complement the existing heap leach 
processing operation to help further improve 
the gold recoveries and production rates of the 
mine. Gedabek also has a SART processing 
facility which produces a copper concentrate. 
Gosha operations
The 300 sq km Gosha Contract Area is 
situated 50 km north-west of Gedabek and 
contains at least nine mineralised zones.
Exploration work at Gosha is on-going aimed 
at defining new resources and developing a 
small underground mining operation by 2014.
Ordubad operations
The 462 sq km Ordubad Contract Area 
is in the Nakhchivan region and contains 
numerous targets.
Exploration activities are on-going at the 
Contract Area including a preliminary remote 
sensing study , adit cleaning and re-sampling 
of adits in two regions, Piyazbashi and Agyurt, 
and trenching and sampling in the Daste 
Bashi region.

 Azerbaijan is situated in south-western Asia, bordering the 
Caspian Sea between Iran and Russia, with a small European 
portion north of the Caucasus range. 
It borders Armenia, Georgia, Iran, Russia and Turkey and is 
split into two parts by Armenia; the smaller part is called the 
Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan.
The country has an established democratic government, 
which is fully supportive of international investment initiatives. 
Infrastructure is reasonably extensive and as Azerbaijan is an oil 
producing country , diesel is cheap, which also results in low costs 
for explosives. Low cost labour is also available.

EBITDA is our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items, excluding our share of the operating profits and
losses of our joint ventures and associates. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under UK GAAP and may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures of other companies, because EBITDA is not uniformly defined. EBITDA should not be considered by investors as
an alternative to Group operating profit/(loss) or profit/(loss) on ordinary activities before taxation as an indication of operating performance,
or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as an indication of cash flows. EBITDA is one of the key financial measures used by
the Group for evaluating financial performance, and is discussed in the operating and financial review and prospects on page 23.

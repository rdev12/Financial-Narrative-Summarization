 Results
The number of retail outlets increased to
186 from 144. The quality of new openings
remained high in sales terms, and like-for-
like improvement in established outlets 
was 4.2%. This strong underlying trading,
combined with the increase in scale of
operations, generated turnover up 25% 
to £144.1m (2001: £115.2m). 
Retail margins improved further , generating
a 29% higher trading contribution at outlet
level of £42.6m (2001: £33.1m). Central
costs were again managed tightly , and
EBITDA increased 28% to £36.4m (2001:
£28.4m). Pre-tax profits were 22% higher at
£20.0m (2001: £16.4m), on a comparable
basis before FRS10 amortisation
*
. This was
after an increase of £2.1m in interest which
was covered 3.5 times. Both EBITDA and
pre-tax profit exclude property disposal
profits of £264,000.
Cash generation continued to be significant.
Cash flow per share rose 26% to 48.7p
(2001: 38.5.p). Operational cash flow
increased 25% to £33.2m (2001: £26.7m)
with free cash flow 21% higher at £20.6m
(2001: £17.0m). Earnings per share
increased in line with sales, 24% higher 
than last year at 17.2p (2001: 13.9p). We
have adopted the new FRS19 accounting
standard, fully providing for deferred tax, with
a necessary restatement of comparatives. 
I believe this progress is an outstanding
achievement in a period that has been
challenging for leisure businesses. Once
again, SFI’ s primary objective of creating
shareholder value was delivered, with an
increase in economic value added (EVA) 
of £5.6m. One reason that explains this
performance is that SFI has positioned its
businesses in the key growth area of this
industry . In addition, it shows that SFI is
managing positively the process of industry
and consumer change, and is continuing 
to exploit the commercial opportunities that
change offers.
Dividend
Y our board is recommending an increased
final dividend up 10% to 1.87p (2001: 1.7p)
to be paid on 29 November to shareholders
registered on 27 September with an 
ex dividend date of 25 September . This
brings the total dividend for the year to
2.78p (2001: 2.525p). As in previous years,
a dividend reinvestment scheme will again
be available.
2002 achievements
Our strategy has been focussed clearly
upon achieving a scale of business that
positions SFI as a major force in the high
street bars sector of licensed retailing.
Positive progress in 2002 has substantially
achieved this objective, and extended 
SFI’ s presence nationally as a mainstream
multiple retailer . 
Management
I was delighted in April to pass executive
responsibility for SFI into the safe hands 
of Andrew Latham. He was previously
Managing Director-Retail and led day-to-day
operations with flair and enormous personal
commitment. He has managed the
complexities of rapid growth with assurance,
and has made a significant strategic
contribution. He is the architect of many of
the SFI retailing innovations, and has shaped
our operations into the complementary
brand strategy that differentiates SFI with a
strong competitive advantage in the market.
When the board invited Andrew to rejoin 
the Group in 1999, it was with succession
planning in mind. However , as a matter 
of policy he was asked to compete with
external candidates, and after an
independent executive search process,
established himself as the clear choice 
to become Chief Executive.
MAKING IT HAPPEN
SFI GROUP HAS NOW ACHIEVED 11 YEARS OF CONTINUOUS GROWTH,
WITH PRE-TAX PROFITS HAVING INCREASED IN THAT PERIOD FROM JUST
£18,745 TO OVER £20M
*
. IN ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL YEAR, THE COMPANY’S
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS ARE ALL POSITIVE. I AM PARTICULARL Y
PLEASED THAT THE STRONG GROWTH IN SALES IS REFLECTED IN SIMILAR
EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH OF 24%.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Tim Andrews is now established as Finance
Director . We welcome his depth of relevant
market knowledge and specific financial
expertise. Sound management of the
finance function is essential and the SFI
structure is well established. Tim adds the
professional quality that is essential for an
ambitious company , particularly one that
expects to move to mid-cap status.
We were sorry to lose Nick Irens recently ,
due to his leading involvement in the
successful bid for Esporta plc. Nick has
made a significant contribution to SFI as
non-executive director both in corporate
governance and in making the function of
the board more rigorous. I thank him
sincerely and we will miss his counsel.
Performance over a long period of time,
such as SFI’ s, is achieved through a talented
and committed management team, both 
in the bars and at the centre. I warmly
extend the board’ s appreciation of their
achievement and contribution.
Outlook
The new year has begun strongly , with total
sales in the first seven weeks increasing
31% and like-for-like accelerating to 5.6%
above last year . 
As the new financial year began, the World
Cup was having a marked effect on leisure
trading. SFI was one of the companies that
benefited strongly . Major matches created
remarkable trading peaks and sales shifts.
Consumers spent heavily but the timing of
major events resulted in some cutback later .
Overall, there was a material increase in
sales but not every pub or bar was able or
equipped to exploit the opportunity . Most
SFI bars benefited strongly from detailed
planning well in advance. This generated an
uplift in sales and has ensured a strong start
to the year .
The executive team under Andrew’ s
leadership has demonstrated the ability to
be at the forefront of industry development. 
I am confident of another positive outcome
for the year and continuation longer term.

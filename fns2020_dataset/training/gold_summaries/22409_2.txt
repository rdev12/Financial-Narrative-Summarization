Highlights
“The Board believes that a transfer to the main market in London will
widen the potential universe of investors in City of London, both
institutional and private individuals. We also believe that a main market
listing could enhance the Group’s reputation and brand with the large
and sophisticated institutional investors that account for the largest
proportion of our current client base.”
Andrew Davison, Chairman
“The past six months, running up to the most recent month end of
31st August, have been the most profitable period that we have experienced.
Operating profit, measured before profit-share, share option charges and
tax, has averaged close to £1.4 million per month.”

2010 Proposed listing on the main market of the London Stock Exchange
Our shares were admitted to the AIM market of the London
Stock Exchange in April 2006 and since then we have grown
the business significantly with funds under management
increased to US$4.4 billion, a new office opened in Dubai and
a market capitalisation that has risen by 50% to £73 million.
As a result of this progress we expect to upgrade to a full
listing on the London Stock Exchange later this year,
enhancing our status with our institutional clients and
widening the Group’s appeal to international investors.
The way in which we run
our business has remained
essentially the same since our
inception and it is worth
restating our key strengths
that we set out in last year’s
annual report.
Expertise
At City of London, we focus not
on gathering assets, but on building
products that reflect our expertise.
Initially, and for many years since
the firm was founded, that
expertise was very specific to closed-
end funds which offered emerging
markets exposure.  This was
subsequently complemented by
research into the underlying
equities, both via natural resources
and via country specific emerging
markets stocks, which in turn
spawned regional and global
emerging market equity funds.
Most recently, we have applied
our unrivalled knowledge of City of London Investment Group Plc  Annual Report 2010 3
1. Investment performance drives our business
2. T echnology leverages our capabilities
3. Focus on profits, margins, costs
4. Aversion to risk in the management of our business
5. 1-4 above create opportunities for further growth
6. CoL differentiation and diversification
City of London’s operating philosophy can
best be represented by the six key drivers:
  
         
Other 
Institutions 9%
Retail 1%
Endowment 22%
Foundation 20%
Pension 48%
Client type 
As a percentage of total assets as at 31st May 2010
closed-end funds around the world
to the development of a global
(ex US) closed-end fund product.
So today, while we remain both
proud and protective of our
“boutique” status, we offer a range
of products which are defined by
the twin pillars of our expertise:
emerging markets and closed
end funds.
Process
We have always striven to develop
and nurture an investment process
which does not rely on ‘star’ fund
managers, but rather upon a series
of analytical procedures that can
produce repeatable and sustainable
first or second quartile performance
versus our peers. Our process
employs an array of proprietary tools
for analysing and identifying value.
These quantitative tools supplement
both macroeconomic analysis and
the trading expertise that has been
developed over a period of nearly
20 years. Whether it is taking
advantage of discount anomalies in
closed-end funds, or company
specific valuations in our equity
business, our aim is to deliver
consistent relative outperformance
combined with low volatility relative
to the applicable emerging markets
benchmarks.
Client service
Our clients are our business.
If performance is our first priority,
then client service is a close second.
We understand that a “one size fits
all” approach is not appropriate.
Our aim is to be open and
accessible to each and every client,
and while we have a designated
client service team we also expect
and encourage our institutional
clients to enjoy direct contact
with fund managers and other
key individuals within the
investment management team.
We acknowledge that our industry
has faced some difficult issues in
recent times, both with respect to
the opaque practices of a few, and
with respect to volatile market
conditions. We are, and always have
been, an open book to our clients.
While we would never seek to
impose, we try to anticipate the
concerns of our clients, and with
that in mind we offer personal visits
by our senior investment officers to
all of our institutional clients and
achieve a significant take up rate.
We believe that our focus on client
service is a key driver of our long
term client retention.

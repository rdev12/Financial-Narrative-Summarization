The business: 
We are Britain’s largest  
operator in the installation and 
maintenance of domestic central 
heating and gas appliances 
employing around 9,500 
engineers. We also provide 
comprehensive maintenance 
and breakdown services for 
electrical white goods, home 
wiring and, through our Dyno 
brand, drains, plumbing and 
home security services. 
The market and our position:  
We have seen a rise in 
competition in the contract 
cover market, from insurance 
and other energy companies. 
We have ensured we are 
offering customers greater 
choice by growing our range of 
products outside the original 
central heating care range. Our 
performance in the emergency 
‘on demand’ market remains 
strong with over 65% of call outs 
converting to a contractual 
product. As energy prices rise 
and concern about emissions 
increases, new technologies 
become more attractive, and 
interest in home energy 
efficiency increases. So we 
expect customer demand to 
grow significantly for more 
integrated propositions. In 2008 
we supported British Gas 
Residential in the launch of a 
bundled product, Dual Fuel 
Extra, and aim to expand such 
cross-selling during 2009.
The business: 
We are the biggest energy 
supplier in Britain’s domestic 
market. Operating under our 
British Gas brand (Scottish Gas 
in Scotland), we had 15.6 million 
gas and electricity customer 
accounts at the end of 2008, 
representing just over 40% of 
the gas market and 20% of the 
electricity market.
The market and our position:  
British Gas Residential operates 
in the fully competitive energy 
supply market in Britain. 
Competitive positioning is based 
on brand recognition, the range 
of product propositions on offer, 
customer service quality, and 
retail price. The market has 
strong regulatory oversight.  
The deteriorating economic 
environment and unprecedented 
volatility in wholesale energy 
prices has led to increased focus 
on energy bills and the need for 
additional support for those 
defined as fuel poor. 
British Gas has the largest 
programme in Britain to support 
vulnerable and in-need 
customers. Our range of 
fixed-price products has proved 
popular with customers seeking 
stability and certainty in their 
future energy bills. We now have 
over 3.5 million customers on 
fixed-price deals.

The business: 
We are Britain’s leading supplier 
of energy to businesses, from 
small to medium-sized 
enterprises (SME) through to 
large industrial and commercial 
users. We offer a range of 
options from open tariffs to 
fixed-price contracts, and by  
the end of 2008 we had over  
1 million customer supply points.
The market and our position:  
The business market is highly 
sophisticated and there has been 
a rise in intermediaries – advisers 
who help customers manage the 
impact of volatile energy prices. 
With the prospect of tighter 
regulation around businesses’ 
carbon emissions, we will be 
offering help to our customers to 
cut their energy usage and 
reduce their carbon footprint. 
British Gas Business has a loyal 
customer base in part due to 
our dedicated account manager 
service, which provides a 
personalised customer service. 
Our recent acquisition of BMSi 
(an installer of specialist control 
systems to improve energy 
efficiency in commercial 
buildings) has added to the 
range of services that we  
can offer.
The business: 
British Gas New Energy (BGNE) 
was established in 2007 to  
offer low-carbon solutions to 
customers. We now supply 
more energy efficiency products, 
such as insulation, than any 
other UK utility. We provide 
advice on saving energy and 
install a range of renewable and 
low-carbon microgeneration such 
as solar panels and heat pumps. 
We also provide two industry 
leading green energy tariffs.
The market and our position:  
Many consumers understand 
that better energy efficiency  
and using cleaner energy are 
priorities in tackling climate 
change. This also remains a high 
political priority, with increasing 
Government policies to reduce 
carbon emissions from homes 
and businesses. We have 
responded to this evolving 
market by developing a range of 
low-carbon customer solutions. 
During 2008, more than half a 
million customers completed  
our Energy Savers Report. The 
energy efficiency measures we 
provided to homes delivered 
lifetime carbon savings of 17.87 
million tonnes. We acquired  
a business that designs and 
installs solar photovoltaic 
systems and a low-carbon 
consulting business. We gained 
exclusive distribution rights for 
several combined heat and 
power technologies and invested 
in one of these developers.

The business: 
We provide energy and 
energy-related services to 
residential and business 
customers in Texas and the 
north and east of the United 
States, as well as across 
Canada. We own and operate 
approximately 3,000 natural gas 
wells in Alberta while in Texas, 
we own three gas-fired power 
plants and have power 
purchase agreements totalling 
813MW of wind power.
The market and our position:  
North America has seen a year 
of change during 2008; energy 
markets have been affected by 
volatile wholesale gas prices 
and the economic downturn. On 
top of this, deregulation 
continues to be a hot topic with 
potential changes to carbon 
legislation under the new 
Obama administration. We are 
continuing to invest to grow and 
in 2008 acquired upstream gas 
assets from Rockyview and 
TransGlobe Energy in Canada. 
We also added to our customer 
base in the United States 
through the purchase of 
Strategic Energy. This makes 
Direct Energy one of North 
America’s largest energy and 
energy-related services 
providers with more than 5 
million customer relationships.
OUR MARKETS AND PROPORTION OF GROUP REVENUE
The map on the left illustrates how much revenue each of the regions contributed 
to the Group’s total.
We can also take the Group as a whole and look at the contributions made by our 
downstream, customer-facing operations compared to the contribution made by our 
upstream assets and trading operations, as illustrated in the pie charts on the right.

The business: 
We are involved in power 
generation, energy management 
and retail energy supply in 
Europe, with operations in 
Belgium, Germany, The 
Netherlands and Spain.
The market and our position:  
The European energy landscape 
is continuing its slow 
transformation, with ongoing 
merger and acquisition activity, 
significant evolution of wholesale 
markets, and increased 
unbundling activity, most notably 
in Germany and The Netherlands. 
Regulatory changes have also led 
to further unbundling and 
restructuring in Belgium, where in 
January 2009 we increased our 
shareholding in the generation 
and supply company SPE to  
a controlling 51%.
We are well positioned to take 
advantage of opportunities that 
may emerge in Europe. However 
the pace of deregulation is key 
and the returns will need to  
be competitive with other 
opportunities across the Group. 
The business: 
We source gas and electricity 
from our own production and 
from third parties, mainly to 
supply British Gas Residential 
and British Gas Business. Our 
gas fields can supply around 
29% of our UK gas requirements, 
and we produce around 58% of 
our peak electricity requirements 
from our seven gas-fired power 
stations, four wind farms and 
major contracts.
The market and our position:  
Both oil and gas prices saw 
record highs during 2008, and 
the UK power market tightened 
sharply with capacity shortfalls 
due to station outages in the UK 
fleet. We are investing in new 
gas assets by acquiring more 
fields in the North Sea, and  
also in developing our power 
generation and renewables 
fleet. Our Langage power 
station (one of the UK’s cleanest 
fossil-fuelled power plants) is 
due to begin operation in 2009, 
and our investment programme 
to develop renewable energy 
from offshore and onshore wind 
farms is progressing. We have 
enough import capacity at the 
Isle of Grain liquefied natural  
gas (LNG) terminal to supply 
over 10% of our annual gas 
requirement, and have also 
announced our intention to 
acquire a 25% stake in the 
nuclear generator British 
Energy, which would add 
significantly to our portfolio.
The business: 
Centrica Storage operates the 
Rough storage facility which is 
the largest in the UK providing 
approximately 70% of current 
UK storage capacity. It consists 
of a partially depleted gas field 
under the North Sea, supported 
by a gas processing terminal at 
Easington, which we also 
manage. We sell gas storage 
and other services to Centrica 
Energy and a range of third 
parties. Centrica Storage  
also operates the Langeled 
terminal receiving Norwegian 
gas from the world’s longest 
undersea pipeline.
The market and our position:  
With the UK rapidly becoming 
more dependent on imported 
gas, increasing the country’s 
gas storage capacity is essential 
in order to ensure security of 
supply. To meet these future 
requirements and develop 
Centrica Storage into a 
multi-asset, multi-product 
business we are planning to 
convert the largely depleted 
Bains gas field (near our 
Morecambe Bay fields) into  
a storage facility and have  
also acquired the onshore 
Caythorpe gas storage project 
in East Yorkshire. 
In February 2009 we announced 
our intention to create an 
additional 60bcf gas storage field 
in the UK North Sea following the 
acquisition of a 70% share in the 
Baird gas field.

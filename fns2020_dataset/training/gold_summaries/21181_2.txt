AVEVA Everything3D™
Adoption of AVEVA Everything3D™ (AVEVA E3D™) by existing and 
new customers accelerated in the second half of the year. We saw 
growing activity around brownfield engineering products, playing 
to AVEVA’s strengths in laser modelling, which sits at the heart of 
AVEVA E3D as a key capability.
Global Accounts
We have extended our relationship with key Global Accounts 
to include broader solutions and we continue to work in 
close alignment with our most important customers on 
product innovation.
Partners
The development of solutions together with key partners remains 
critical to our market strategy. During the year we have deepened 
these relationships, adding new partners and capabilities as we 
seek to address new markets and broaden our solution offering.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions are a key enabler of AVEVA’s growth strategy and 
this year we added FabTrol to our organisation, an important 
strategic move that completes our end-to-end offering in 
steel-detailing and fabrication.
Innovation
We have an enviable reputation for providing creative software 
solutions. The past year has seen further ground-breaking 
developments spanning the entire solution portfolio, 
particularly in 3D visualisation, decision support and 
advanced laser modelling.
Efficient organisation
We are focused on ensuring the most efficient allocation of 
resources and during the year we undertook a number of 
initiatives to reduce costs and create organisational efficiencies, 
enabling us to optimise our investment in future opportunities.
Maximising our investment for future development
As we develop the business, investment in innovation remains key 
for our customers, as well as how we deliver our solutions most 
effectively, making the best use of new technologies such as 
cloud-enablement and software as a service licensing models.

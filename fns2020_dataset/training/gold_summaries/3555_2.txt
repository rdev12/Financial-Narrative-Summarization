“We strive every day to create
the highest quality service in
home care”
The summary of the Group presented on the facing page and on pages
2 to 3 illustrates the range of services now offered by the Group to people 
receiving or providing care at home. This range of services underpins the
Group’s strategy to achieve growth both organically and by developing new
revenue streams by cross-selling new services to our growing service user
base. We believe that this approach places us in a strong position to grow.
The Group achieved revenue growth of 136% in the year, largely through 
the two acquisitions made in the year ended 30 September 2008 and the 
eight acquisitions made in the previous year. Growth in operating proﬁt
was not as pronounced, and was less than had originally been expected. 
The Group experienced a number of challenges earlier in the year, and in 
response to those challenges the Board has initiated and delivered on a
number of key strategies which have strengthened the Group’s ability to 
respond to more challenging environments now and in the future.
The Group’s largest acquisition to date was the acquisition of the Complete 
Group in November 2007, which expanded the Group’s activities into the
provision of complex, specialist care. The newest addition to the Group is
PharmAssured, a business which the Group established in November 2008 
to provide safer medication management for service users and
care workers.
With the expanded range of services now available, the Group is well positioned
to beneﬁt from the increasing demand for its services in the different sectors of
social and health care in which it participates. There
is signiﬁcant opportunity for the businesses
within the Group not only to increase
substantially the cross-selling of
their services to each other’ s
customers but also for the
core business themselves
to expand organically.

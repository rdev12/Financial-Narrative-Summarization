Chief Executive’s Statement
Chris Meredith
Chief Executive Oﬃcer
I am pleased to report that much of the progress 
highlighted at the interims continued through 
the second half of 2012, and AMS has delivered 
another strong year of growth. In particular, 
ActivHeal®, silver alginate and our converted 
foam portfolios all showed solid year-on-year 
progress and we are also pleased that the now 
completed integration of RESORBA® went to 
plan.
Business Restructure
With AMS now having multiple product 
portfolios, six manufacturing sites in four 
countries, several routes to market, and a 
number of diﬀerent growth opportunities to 
pursue, the Group has been restructured to 
ensure the business continues to operate 
eﬃciently whilst retaining critical focus on each 
of our growth drivers. This has resulted in the 
reorganisation of the Group into four discrete 
business units - Branded Direct, Branded 
Distributed, OEM and Bulk Materials - each 
responsible for two key value streams, namely a 
focused route-to-market and a core part of our 
R&D programme.
Each of the four business units will consist of a 
mix of sales, marketing, business development 
and R&D teams, led by individual business unit 
Directors, all of whom are appointed and in place. 
Linked to the above changes, our operational 
sites will focus on manufacturing their specialised 
products for any unit, with the focus being on 
sustained improvements in quality, eﬃciency, 
cost and service. Each operational site has a Site 
Manager who reports into our Group Operations 
Director. To complete the senior management 
team, a Group Quality and Regulatory Director 
will be starting in May 2013 to ensure that a 
consistent strategy and policy is adhered to 
throughout the Group, and a Site Manager for 
Germany has joined in March 2013.
I am pleased to report that the completion of 
the reorganisation marks the ﬁnal stage of the 
integration of the RESORBA® business and we 
now have the focused organisational structure 
to deliver on the numerous opportunities across 
the Group. 
OEM 
With revenue in 2012 of £22.0 million (2011: £18.5 
million), our Original Equipment Manufacture 
(‘OEM’) business unit is the largest in the Group 
and has responsibility for driving our OEM 
contract manufacturing sales through 
business-to-business partners, as well as the 
R&D value stream associated with advanced 
woundcare dressings. Within this unit, 
accounting for nearly 50% of its revenue in 2012, 
are our silver alginate technologies which 
delivered 22% growth compared to 2011. After 
the destocking eﬀect we previously saw with 
one of our major partners in 2011, it was pleasing 
to see our sales of silver alginate products grow 
by 26% in the UK and Europe and by 17% in the 
US. Silver alginate continues to be a key growth 
driver of this business unit. The rest of this 
business unit consists of alginate and foam-
based ﬁnished dressings for our partners, 
together with the collagen OEM business 
acquired with RESORBA®.
R&D is working on a range of new anti-microbial 
dressings with launches scheduled during 2013.
Branded Direct 
Our Branded Direct business unit is the next 
largest with 2012 revenue of £20.1 million (2011: 
£5.7 million) and has responsibility for driving 
our own brand sales direct to end users in 
Germany, the UK and the Czech Republic, 
together with our suture and collagen R&D 
value stream as most sales based on these 
technologies are included in this unit. Other key 
growth drivers in this division are ActivHeal® 
sales to the NHS, up 29% in 2012, LiquiBand® 
sales into direct territories, up 5% in the UK and 
up 15% in Germany, and RESORBA® branded 
sutures and collagen dressings which grew by 
5% in 2012 to £12.3 million.

Branded Distributed 
Our Branded Distributed business unit reported 
2012 revenue of £6.8 million (2011: £3.6 million) 
and has signiﬁcant potential for growth given it 
has responsibility for driving our own brand 
sales through our third party network of global 
distribution partners, as well as managing our 
adhesives and sealants R&D value stream. This 
unit’s key growth drivers are LiquiBand® and 
sealants into the US which accounted for 29% of 
this unit’s total 2012 revenue (including sales to 
Russia), up by 10% over 2011.
Our progress into the US market with LiquiBand® 
was mixed in 2012. Latest data shows that we 
now have 13% of the alternative site market, a 
strong improvement from the 10% we had at 
the end of June 2012. We are pleased with this 
progress which is well in line with the targets 
that we set on launch two years ago. Our 
progress in the acute care or hospital sector has, 
however, been disappointing with our market 
share slipping back to 4% from the 6% we had at 
the half year. In this regard, LiquiBand® received 
less focus than we expected from one of our 
key partners in the second half of the year and 
this resulted in the partner not meeting their 
contractual minima in 2012. This has however 
given us an opportunity to reassess and refocus 
our US growth strategy for LiquiBand®, as outlined 
elsewhere in this report, and we remain positive 
about LiquiBand®’s overall prospects in the US. 
This business unit also includes sales of 
RESORBA® products into Russia, along with 
RESORBA® and LiquiBand® products into new 
geographies through distributors, together 
with any ‘co-branded’ initiatives we choose to 
progress in order to get any of our technologies 
successfully established into new markets.
Bulk Materials 
Our ﬁnal business unit handles our bulk 
materials, mainly roll-stock foam, through 
third-party partners who have their own 
converting and packaging capabilities. It also 
manufactures foam for AMS’s own operational 
requirements. Revenue in 2012 was lower at £3.8 
million (2011: £6.6 million) due to the previously 
ﬂagged pipeline ﬁlling from customer product 
launches that took place in 2011. Foam rollstock 
is the key growth driver in this unit, with 2012 
revenue of £3.6 million (2011: £6.4 million), 86% 
of the total. We anticipate that revenue growth 
will resume in 2013.
Prospects for 2013
I believe we have signiﬁcant growth 
opportunities across all four of our new business 
units. Our strategic focus remains unchanged on 
our goal of establishing a leading global position 
in the woundcare, wound closure and sealants 
arenas, and the work done in 2012 ensures we 
have an organisation ﬁt for purpose, with the 
RESORBA® business fully integrated.
Our silver alginate partners continue to make 
gains in the anti-microbial market segment, and 
planned product upgrades in 2013 will help 
strengthen our proposition in this area. 
Our ActivHeal® success is expected to continue 
to build and deliver another year of solid double 
digit growth as we convert more hospitals and 
improve compliance in existing Trusts.
Our trial investment in a direct UK OR sales team is 
starting to deliver results with some notable recent 
LiquiBand® gains. This team will be strengthened 
further in 2013 and has also been trained on the 
RESORBA® products. With the tender awards that 
were granted in Q4 2012, we are well placed to 
grow our UK direct business in 2013.
The failure of a key US LiquiBand® partner to 
meet their contractual commitments in 2012 has 
allowed us to re-think our growth strategy in the 
US. Our alternate site partner has demonstrated 
what can be achieved with our formulations and 
designs. We have carved out individual areas of 
focus for our existing partners and will allow 
these to progress in 2013. Over and above these, 
we are seeking approval for a new formulation 
and plan to launch this by July 2013 with an 
additional new partner, giving them their own 
unique position and product and thereby 
further strengthening our ability to capture 
market share in the US tissue adhesive space.
Regulatory approvals are progressing for 
LiquiBand® in Russia and China, and we have a 
strategy that could see us introducing RESORBA® 
sutures into the US market for the ﬁrst time, by 
the end of 2013.
On the new product front, we are still on track to 
gain approval for our Hernia Mesh Fixation 
device before the end of 2013 and will launch 
this initially through our own teams in the UK 
and Germany.
We are conﬁdent 2013 will be another strong 
year for the Group.

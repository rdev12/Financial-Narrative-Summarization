The Group has three main service lines, 
temporary and contract recruitment, 
permanent recruitment and offshore 
recruitment services. Overall we aim for a bias 
in temporary recruitment, which is generally 
more stable throughout the economic cycle, 
but this also depends on the maturity of the 
staffing sector in each country, with less mature 
markets focused purely on permanent sales.
We target professional and specialist job levels 
where our brands can offer a higher value 
added service to clients.
AT A GLANCE
The Group operates in 19 countries across four 
geographic regions and across seven key sectors, with 
each brand an expert in their niche market. We focus on 
growth markets, whether this is country or sector based. 32%

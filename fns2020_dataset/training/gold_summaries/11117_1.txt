 10 Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive Officer’ s review
Back in 2001 when the dotcom bubble 
was bursting our business faced a very 
difficult road ahead. I was, however, 
optimistic about our prospects, as I 
believed we had a strong talent-base 
and a sound and quite simple strategy–
focus on building a global consultancy 
that does great work. I felt a similar level 
of optimism as we approached the 
winter of 2008 when banks were being 
rescued almost daily and governments 
around the world were forced to inject 
vast amounts of capital into their 
economies. In 2001 we emerged a 
stronger business. Today, despite recent 
events, the Company is much larger than 
it was in 2001, and has an even stronger-
talent base and a client list that is the 
envy of the industry. For the record,  
the simple strategy remains.
Despite the climate, we grew
Last year we achieved modest revenue 
growth of 3.6%, to £65.4m (2008: £63.1m). 
This derived from a stronger US dollar 
and euro relative to sterling. Profit fared 
less well, with adjusted profit declining 
to £5.2m from £6.6m the previous year. 
That said, the Group did have to incur 
some significant losses from foreign 
exchange contracts, which resulted  
in a £1.7m charge to the profit and loss 
account. As several analysts noted, had 
these not occurred, then adjusted profit 
would actually have risen year on year.
A client base that keeps  
getting better
Beyond the financial metrics there are 
several other measures that investors 
should look at. These include the quality 
of the Company’s client base. On this 
front I am pleased to report that the 
business has maintained an excellent list 
that includes IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, AMD, 
salesforce.com, Facebook, Yahoo!, Xerox, 
Sony, Unilever, Coca-Cola and Boots.  
I’m also pleased to note that the Group 
has added some additional blue-chip 
clients, including Hitachi Data Systems, 
Autodesk, VMware and HP .
Platforms for future growth
Another important measure of the 
Group’s performance is its ability to 
deliver growth in the future. While many 
businesses have simply hunkered down 
and focused on survival, we have 
continued to invest in our future. Shortly 
after our year end, we made a series of 
announcements. Firstly, we announced 
the acquisition of M Booth, a New York-
based consumer agency that includes 
Unilever and JC Penney amongst its 
clients. Secondly, we announced that we 
have acquired the PR assets of Upstream 
Asia, which will become Bite Asia and 
will give Bite offices in Beijing, Shanghai, 
Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney. 
Thirdly, we announced that we now  
own 70% of 463 Communications,  
a public policy consultancy based in

Lastly, we announced that in the next 
few months we will be opening a digital 
communications consultancy to service 
clients in the US and Europe.
All you need is LUV
As you can see, we have been busy 
during these difficult times and I’m 
proud of the great progress we have 
made. That said, the economic impact  
of this latest recession is still being felt  
in many parts of the world. However,  
I believe our business is set for what  
is being described as a ‘LUV’-shaped 
recovery, i.e. where the models of 
economic recovery are L -shaped  
in Europe, U-shaped in the US, and 
V-shaped in Asia. This would certainly 
match the signs we have seen during 
the last six months.
This last year placed some strong 
challenges in front of our people. They 
experienced clients being forced to cut 
back on marketing expenditure due to 
their declining sales. They witnessed an 
increasingly active merger and 
acquisitions market that had clients 
disappearing (and also appearing) from 
nowhere. They were engaged in the 
accelerating trend towards using social-
media as a major part of PR campaigns, 
as traditional media continue to struggle. 
In all this, they maintained one constant 
belief: that doing great work is what 
really matters. I’m delighted to say that  
in these difficult times they did a lot of 
great work, which is why today we have 
a customer base that keeps getting 
better and an outlook that suggests that, 
as the world economy emerges from the 
uncertainty that has enveloped it in the 
last year, we will be presented with some 
wonderful opportunities, which we 
intend to take advantage of.

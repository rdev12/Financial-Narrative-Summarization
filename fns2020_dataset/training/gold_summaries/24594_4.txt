 At a Glance
Who we are
Headquartered in Waterlooville 
(Hampshire), Harwood Wealth 
Management Group was created by 
bringing together Compass Wealth 
Management Group, which was 
founded in 2001 by Neil Dunkley and 
Mark Howard, and Wellian Investment 
Solutions, led by Alan Durrant.
What we do
Through our FCA-regulated entities 
and our vertically integrated model, 
we offer a broad range of wealth 
management and financial planning 
services to mass affluent retail 
investment and corporate clients, 
including investment management, 
pension and retirement planning, 
inheritance planning, life cover  
and family protection. In addition, 
we offer Discretionary Investment 
Management services, the Wellian 
investment administration platform 
and operate the Discovery range  
of Multi Manager Funds, which 
supports our investment 
management offering to our clients.
We currently have in excess of 
£2.1bn of assets under influence.
Where we 
operate
We operate a centralised, scalable 
infrastructure from our Waterlooville 
headquarters, supporting multiple 
offices, predominantly throughout  
the South of England.
Our approach
The majority of our 83 FCA-regulated 
financial advisers are self-employed, 
and are remunerated based on a share 
of the annual fee income that they 
generate. The Group is supported by  
a team of more than 50 investment 
management, operations, compliance 
and IT infrastructure staff.
Our acquisition 
model
Historically the majority of our growth 
in client assets has arisen through 
acquisition, with 53 financial services 
businesses acquired to 31 October 
2016. We adopt a formulated and 
structured approach to acquisitions, 
focusing on small to medium-sized 
financial advisory and wealth 
management businesses with between 
£10 million and £100 million of AUI. 
We intend to continue to pursue this 
acquisition-led strategy, supplemented 
with organic growth from referrals and 
marketing initiatives.
Harwood Wealth Management Group is a leading financial planning 
and discretionary wealth management firm. We have grown by 
applying our simple and scalable, acquisition-led model.

Depth of infrastructure knowledge
Customers turn to us for our technical expertise. But increasingly we must augment technical expertise 
with local knowledge, ability to manage the complex needs of our customers and the skills to integrate a 
host of stakeholders from contractors to owners, end-users and regulators. Our balanced, global strength 
in all these core skills gives us crucial competitive advantage.
Breadth of capability
With more comprehensive capabilities than our international peers, we can access a broader range 
of markets and customers. While we are organised along capability lines – infrastructure investments, 
professional services, construction services and support services – the breadth of capabilities across 
the Group create a strong platform for growth and delivering shareholder value.

Strength of balance sheet
Infrastructure projects are long term and large in value. Being able to demonstrate that we have the 
financial strength to complete them is fundamental. Hence, we maintain positive cash and PPP assets 
to balance against our pension deficit and negative working capital.

Chief Executive’s statement
I am pleased to report that from a ‘standing start’ in 2003,
Healthcare Locums PLC (HCL) is now one of the largest health
and social care agencies in the UK. Specialising in niche 
high-margin businesses, HCL has established a strong position 
in the marketplace and gained a substantial number of contracts
within both the NHS and private healthcare markets.

Overview
The last year has seen significant
growth, development and change
for HCL, including the acquisition
of RS Locums and its integration
into the group, and the listing 
of HCL on AIM. The main
challenge for the group in 2005
was to achieve integration 
of systems and management
whilst maintaining strong organic 
growth in a dynamic and 
changing marketplace. 
HCL has now broadened its
product offering by acquiring in
early 2006, Medical and Social
Work Professionals, and BBL
Medical. The BBL Medical
acquisition gives the group a 
small but strategically important
place in the locum GP market.
All of our newly acquired
businesses have been successfully
integrated in line with our plans.
A significant achievement in 2005
was to gain accreditation for
Investors in People. As a people
business our investment in staff 
it is a key strength. We aim to
make HCL the Company of choice
for those working in the healthcare
recruitment sector. Our employee
rewards programme (VIP), share
option scheme, and quarterly
and annual awards are innovative,
market leading and encourage
loyalty and commitment from our
staff who are highly incentivised 
to achieve strong organic growth
for the group. We now have over
240 employees, most of whom
are based in our two call centres
in Wembley and Loughton.
Financial performance
HCL maintains a strategic 
mix between temporary and
permanent placements. The
temporary locum business
accounted for £42.9m of the
turnover at 21.5% gross margin.
In addition, £1m of permanent
placement sales improved 
the group’s gross margin to
23%. Whilst in 2005 permanent
placements accounted for 
just over 2% of total sales, we
envisage that this will grow to
nearer 4% of sales in 2006,
resulting in further gross margin
improvements.
The business split by turnover 
is as shown on the opposite page.
Allied Health Professionals
and Pharmacists
Allied Health Professionals* 
(AHPs) and Pharmacists
accounted for 63% of the HCL
business in 2005. The value 
of this market in the NHS in
the UK is worth approximately 
£350m and HCL has around 8% 
market share. HCL has recently
been awarded the latest NHS
Framework Agreement for Allied
Health Professionals and 
Health Science Service Staff,
which will run to 2009 and it 
is anticipated that HCL will
become a key supplier to this
contract. According to a recent
survey carried out by the NHS,
AHP vacancies are currently 
the most hard to fill vacancies 
in the NHS.
Increasing demand from the
private sector for both diagnostic
and surgical support staff has
meant that HCL now has a
significant number of contracts
with ISTCs and diagnostic
providers to source and supply
staff from outside the UK. This 
is a key driver in the anticipated
increase in permanent 
placements within the group. 
*Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) 
refers to a distinct grouping of 
highly trained, specialist staff who 
work within the healthcare sector.
This group includes therapists such 
as Physiotherapists, Occupational
Therapists, Speech and Language
Therapists, Dietitians, Podiatrists 
and Radiographers.

Doctors
Doctors accounted for 32% 
of the HCL business in 2005. 
With £14m turnover in this
specialty, HCL has approximately
3.5% of an NHS market that is
worth around £400m per annum. 
The addition of BBL medical 
will increase this market share 
to around 8%, but there remains
significant opportunity for growth
in this area.
Late 2005 saw the introduction of
the new NHS national framework
agreement for doctors. New
contracts have been negotiated
with the Trusts that have signed
up to this framework. HCL 
has been successful in gaining 
a substantial amount of new
business for Thames Medics.
However, the handover from the
old to the new contract saw a
slow down in the medical locum
market in the last quarter of 
2005. This trend has now started
to reverse in the first quarter of
2006 as the new contracts start
to impact positively on trading.
We anticipate synergistic benefits
as a result of the acquisition 
of BBL, who are a first 
tier supplier in a number of 
contracts where Thames Medics 
is the second tier supplier, and
vice versa. This will ensure 
that we are able to maximize 
the fill rates without recourse to
subcontracting outside of the
group. The fill rates, and 
therefore customer satisfaction 
will increase accordingly. 
ISTCs are increasingly a source 
of revenue for our doctors 
division both for permanent and
temporary placements. 
Social Workers
Social Work is a relatively new
business line for HCL, as it
was acquired with the acquisition 
of RS Locums, and accounted 
for only 5% of the HCL turnover
in 2005. RS Locums has
approximately 2.6% of a market
that is worth about £170m per
annum. RS Locums has historically
concentrated its efforts on
supplying staff in and around 
the South East of England, and
we have identified that there is 
a large market outside of this
geographical area, which for HCL
has largely remained untapped.
HCL has now developed 
a new specialist Business
Development Team for 
this sector, and we anticipate 
that this will lead to significant
expansion of this division 
over the next twelve months.
General Practitioners
The acquisition of BBL gives 
HCL approximately a 5% market
share in the locum GP market
which is worth circa £90m 
per annum. Due to the ageing
population, the shortages of 
GPs, the number of GPs who 
are due to retire over the next 
few years, and the increased
spending and focus by the NHS
on Primary Care, it is anticipated
that this specialty will present 
a substantial growth opportunity 
for HCL over the next few years.
BBL provides HCL with an
established position in the 
locum GP marketplace, on 
which it can build over the 
next twelve months. 
HCL currently provides 
GPs to out of hour services 
(run either by the NHS 
or the independent sector), 
NHS GP surgeries, and to the
increasing number of private 
GP providers in the UK.
International recruitment
Due to the rising demand for
specialist staff in the UK, and 
the shortages that exist, we 
have an increasing need to 
source staff from international
sources. We have therefore
developed an international
recruitment division, which now
employs seven staff dedicated to
recruiting, vetting, credentialing
and placing staff from abroad.
International staff currently
account for approximately 40% 
of the locum staff that we place.
As a result of the ‘additionality’
requirements, (i.e., staff working
on ISTC contracts cannot 
have worked within the NHS
for the last six months), we 
have a growing dependence on
attracting well qualified specialist
staff to the UK. 
Strong team. Incentivised sales.
Extensive resource pool. Higher margins.
1 Healthcare Locums  9
In order to achieve this HCL 
has developed a network 
of international recruitment agents
across the world: these agents 
are key to our success in bringing
staff into the UK from abroad.
As a result of our development 
of the international team, 
we have identified shortages 
of specialist staff in other parts 
of the world which we are being
asked to fill. This represents 
a new business opportunity for
HCL which we intend to pursue
during 2006.
Integration
At the heart of our success 
has been the smooth integration 
of newly acquired businesses 
into the HCL group. The
management’s strategy for
quickly introducing centralised
systems, procedures and financial
structures has supported 
both the businesses growth 
profile and reassured staff as
to future direction. 
All of the newly acquired
businesses are now utilising
the group’s dedicated IT systems 
and taking advantage of enhanced
central support functions such 
as HR, Business Development
and Marketing. This additional
support provides access to
immediate advantages and
opportunities, providing greater
scope for development and
earnings enhancement.
Delivering the strategy
HCL has within three years
developed into an established
provider of specialist staff 
to the health and social care 
sectors. It has put together
a senior, middle management, 
and recruitment team which 
we believe is unrivalled in 
the sector. It has achieved 
rapid and full integration of all
acquisitions made. We are now
well positioned to gain market
share from our competitors 
in each of the markets in which 
we operate. Whilst consolidation
opportunities remain, HCL has
focused in 2005 and early 2006
on the integration of acquisitions 
made, and placing the individual
businesses on a sound footing 
to maximise their potential for
strong organic growth.
The healthcare market is always
challenging, and changing. To
succeed in this sector requires
vision, the ability to be responsive,
a diverse offering with high
margins, and a low cost base.
HCL has these attributes at 
the core of its business model 
and we are confident of 
achieving further success 
in 2006.

through strategic acquisitions and strong organic growth.

Investment in staff through
training, infrastructure and 
support systems, remuneration
and incentive programmes, 
has positioned HCL increasingly 
as the employer of choice within
the industry. Recent awards of
Investors in People accreditation
and a national award for our 
staff incentive programme,
has further reinforced this, and 
the management are confident 
that this position will be further
enhanced in the coming year.
This has all been achieved within 
three years from a standing start.
Further organic growth, strategic
acquisitions and investment in
its people will enable HCL to
increase its market penetration
within the medical and social 
care sectors. The recent
acquisition of BBL Medical has
launched HCL into the locum
General Practitioner market, 
an area which is expected 
to see significant growth over 
the next few years.
HCL’s cross-sector strategy,
focusing on specialist niche
markets in health and social
care, continues to drive 
the business forward.
State-of-the-art call centres

for an agile, highly trained
sales force to take advantage

Delivery.
The Directors have recognised the opportunities that exist 
within the large but fragmented market that HCL operates in. 
They believe that the group has the potential to achieve further
significant growth in a market that is now worth over £1bn 
per annum in the public sector alone.
In 2005, the group invested
significant resources in developing
its international reach. The group
has established relationships 
with 23 international partners
across Europe, the Middle East,
Australia, New Zealand, the 
USA and Canada, providing
access to a pool of international
healthcare professionals with
highly prized transferable skills.
The Company believes that
demand for overseas professionals
will continue to grow due to
sustained shortages of suitably
qualified staff available within
the UK, and the need for 
private sector clients to comply
with additionality requirements. 
HCL’s experience within this 
field will deliver even greater
opportunities for the group. 
The market is consolidating 
as smaller operators find the
increasing regulations in this
market onerous. HCL has
outsourced its credentialing 
and verification of locum staff 
in order to increase efficiency 
and to reduce costs.
“The Nationwide Accreditation
Bureau provides an efficient,
independent and cost effective
method of vetting locum staff 
on behalf of HCL. This has
enabled HCL to concentrate 
staff on sales improvement, 
whilst significantly reducing 
their administrative burden.”
Kate Bleasdale CEO
Historically the group’s largest
customer has been the NHS.
However, with over £3.5bn
of contracts being tendered to 
the private sector over the next 
five years, we are increasingly
developing both permanent and
locum opportunities with private
providers of healthcare and
diagnostic services. Often these
contracts require staff to comply
with ‘additionality’ requirements,
which effectively require new staff
to be sourced from overseas.
HCL has developed strong links
with the Independent Sector
Treatment Centres (ISTCs) and
diagnostic providers. The group
believes that these contracts,
along with increased permanent
placement business, will result 
in gross margin improvement
across the business over the 
next few years.
Over £3.5 billion of contracts
are being tendered by the
government to the private
sector over the next 
five years. Our areas of

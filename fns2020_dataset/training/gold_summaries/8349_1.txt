Overview
During 2003 solid progress was made
in positioning the Group to deliver
increasing shareholder value from
sustained organic growth across 
its operations. Changes to the
business mix, achieved through
discontinuing four activities
1
, will
provide the Group with increased
focus and improved quality of
continuing revenue streams for 
the future.
Total operating profit from
continuing operations (excluding
exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation) was £33.9 million
(2002: £51.9 million), absorbed
within which was a pension charge
of £8.9 million (2002: nil), increased
National Insurance and general
insurance costs of over £4 million
and a provision of £5.5 million on
the contract with Liverpool City
Council, now transferred to a 
third party.
After exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation the Group
made a pre-tax loss of £2.9 million
(2002: £37.2 million profit).
Cash flow remained a priority during
the year. Year-end net debt was
reduced to £22.5 million (2002:
£42.8 million) through improved
cash management in the continuing
businesses and accelerated timing
on the disposal of assets from the
discontinued businesses. The resulting
average bank debt was £67.3 million
(2002: £82.1 million). Included within
this performance is the resumption
of cash contributions to the 
pension scheme of approximately
£10 million (2002: nil).
The Group reports operations 
under six main headings: Facilities
Services, Industrial Services, Project
Services, Equipment Services, PFI
Investments and Group Services.
Group Services’ operating costs
totalled £9.6 million (2002: £9.2
million) principally comprising the
costs associated with head office,
centrally-provided services and 
PFI bid costs.
Reviews of the Group’s five 
trading divisions follow. The term
“divisional operating profit” used
hereafter excludes exceptional
items, goodwill amortisation 
and any UK defined benefit 
pension charges.

The chart shows the turnover associated with Interserve's future workload for each of the years up to 2041
(when our longest contract – the PFI with Dudley Hospitals NHS Trust – expires). The chart is structured such
that it is possible to make a direct comparison between how the workload stood at the end of 2002 and the end
of 2003. For example, the workload at the end of 2002 for 2005 (i.e. three years ahead) should be compared
with the workload at the end of 2003 for 2006 (also three years ahead). These two bars are placed adjacent to
each other in the chart.

 02 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2015
REPOSITIONING 
THE BUSINESS 
We are focusing our business on our core portfolio of  
world class assets (as highlighted in the map opposite) – in 
diamonds, platinum group metals (PGMs) and copper – that 
provide the raw materials to meet growing consumer-driven 
demand in the world’s maturing and developed economies. 
We are focused on making a real difference, through safe  
and responsible mining, to provide the ingredients to meet 
those aspirations – from homes, vehicles, household 
appliances and electronics to luxury goods such as jewellery.
Our mining operations, future growth projects and exploration 
and marketing activities will extend across southern Africa, 
South and North America, Asia and Europe. Our portfolio  
of competitive, long life mining assets will be positioned to 
deliver robust profitability and cash flows through the  
price cycle.
We are adapting to create a greatly streamlined and agile 
business, with the technical and marketing expertise and 
critical mass to compete effectively for, and to deliver, future 
opportunities, both within and beyond our portfolio.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

I am delighted to present the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2012.   
 
The Group increased revenue to £9,203,453 (2011: £7,776,362) producing an increased gross profit of 
£4,678,074 (2011: £3,963,959).  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation increased to 
£2,737,967 (2011: £2,222,411) resulting in a substantial pre-tax profit for the year of £834,758 (2011: £227,219) 
after finance charges of £585,611 (2011: £532,404) and amortisation relating to the acquisition of back books 
and other intangibles of £1,199,481 (2011: £1,388,809).  Profit after taxation was £591,257 (2011: £71,036). 
 
During the first quarter of the financial year the Group acquired a further tranche of new IVAs for £259,880 
resulting in a gain on bargain purchase of £27,089.   
 
At the year end the group had net assets of £5,827,562 (2011: £5,150,582) including cash of £462,459 (2011: 
£336,636) after spending £259,880 on back book acquisitions (2011: £1,088,783) in the year financed out of 
cash flow. In addition £700,000 of loans was repaid in the year (2011: net new loans of £315,000). 
 
Following the Paymex ruling the Group received some £750,000, including interest, prior to the year end in 
respect of our claim to recover VAT which had been incorrectly charged on IVAs. The money has been placed 
into a client account although we have since the year end refunded the VAT due to the open cases and the 
element of VAT that is due to the Group in respect of nominee fees. We will shortly commence the process of 
distributing the VAT on closed cases. At the 30 June 2012 the Group had accrued revenue of £338,000 based 
upon estimates of the revenues expected to arise to the Group out of the VAT refund process. 
 
I am pleased to say that, excluding acquired back books of debt management clients, Abacus has started again to 
grow the number of clients under debt management despite current market conditions. 
 
The numbers of new IVAs have, however, particularly in the second half of the year, been disappointing with 
only 1,459 new IVAs passed in the year (2011: 1,601).  Whilst sales of new IVAs have been disappointing the 
Group has benefitted from significant income in the year generated from consultancy services related to the IVA 
business. This income includes items which are one off in nature and whilst it will continue in the current 
financial year we expect it will be at lower levels than have been seen previously.  
 
We continue to invest in various marketing activities to increase the number of new IVAs being passed and 
continue to concentrate on managing overheads as we accumulate cash in readiness to repay the convertible 
bond due in April 2013.

Servelec group plc
annual report and accounts 2015
Chairman’s statement
Servelec Group has produced a good performance in 2015, reflecting the 
benefits of its diversified revenue model. Organic growth is on target overall 
and the Group has continued on its acquisition path delivering further growth. 
The Group enters 2016 with a strong order book, an improving pipeline and  
an improved cash position.
Overview
Overall, the Group has performed well in 2015, with revenue for the  
year ended 31 December 2015 at £63.1m (2014: £51.8m), an increase of 
22% driven largely by performance across Health & Social Care. 
Underlying operating profit increased by 32% to £16.2m (2014: £12.2m) 
13% of which was organic. Profit before taxation increased 26% to 
£13.4m (2014: £10.6m) due in part to the performance of Corelogic 
which was acquired in December 2014. Earnings per share was 17.1p 
(2014: 12.7p), fully diluted EPS 16.7p (2014: 12.5p) an increase of 35% 
and 34% respectively compared to the previous year.
Health & Social Care delivered a 95% increase in revenue compared  
to 2014, which includes a full year of trading from Servelec Corelogic. 
This result included the full exit from the London Refresh which was 
delivered on time and on budget for 21 Trusts and Provider 
organisations. 2015 also saw Servelec win a major deployment in the 
Acute market with its Oceano product for a multi-site Trust covering 
three hospitals and 13 minor injury units. This is significant as it heralds 
Servelec’s expansion into the Acute market. Within Social Care 
significant market share was gained through the delivery of 13 new 
Mosaic systems and the continued upgrade of Frameworki customers 
to Mosaic. Operating profit in Health and Social Care increased to  
£12.1 million, in line with expectations and a 60% increase on 2014. 
Health and Social Care delivered an extremely positive performance in 
tender activity in “North New”, creating a strong order book for 2016. 
As the anticipated Converged Care agenda comes to the fore from 2016 
onwards, Servelec remains well positioned to take advantage of this 
with its strong customer relationships and diverse product portfolio.
The challenging macro market conditions within which the Automation 
division operates have been well publicised. The downturn in the oil and 
gas industry has had a significant impact on both segments as each is 
exposed to this sector. 2015 has been a year of diversification and 
product investment to counteract the downturn in oil and gas and the 
slower than anticipated upturn in investment by the UK water industry. 
Servelec Controls reported a 4% decrease in revenue to £14.4m (2014: 
£15.0m) with a slight reduction in operating profit to £3.4m (2014: 
£3.5m). Within Controls - Power and Nuclear the investment in the new 
management team is reaping benefits of identifying and targeting a 
larger addressable market in existing and additional sectors. This is 
starting to gain momentum specifically with Servelec’s move into the

refurbishment of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants for export  
to Turkey and an increased focus on winning business in the Nuclear  
and Power sectors. Servelec Technologies reported a 20% reduction  
in revenue to £16.1m (2014: £20.1m) and through rationalisation of the 
consolidated business reported a 10% reduction in profit to £3.5m 
(2014: 3.9m). Within Technologies, RTU sales have been impacted by 
both the oil and gas industry and the UK water market however we see 
this as a temporary dip and believe the opportunities for business 
optimisation solutions and investment in products will bring benefits  
in 2016 and beyond. 
As at 31 December 2015, Servelec had gross cash balances of £9.9m 
compared with £6.0m in 2014. During the year the Group had excellent 
profit to cash conversion at 115% (2014: 141%) due in part to the 
favourable timing of monies received from customers, but also 
demonstrating the Group’s focus on strong cash management.
Corporate development
In May 2015, Servelec acquired Aura Limited, a leading developer of 
healthcare software that helps automate bed management across 
hospitals, clinics and primary care centres, thereby enabling the 
improved patient care. Aura's suite of products is sold on a standalone 
basis and also integrated into Servelec's Oceano and RiO products 
thereby adding to their functionality. The acquisition has already 
provided Servelec with a valuable entry point into the Republic of 
Ireland and Northern Ireland markets through existing contacts and 
customer relationships.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 3.5p per ordinary share which, 
together with the interim dividend of 1.65p paid in October 2015, 
equates to a total dividend of 5.15p per ordinary share for the year 
ended 31 December 2015. The final dividend, which is subject to 
approval at the company’s AGM, will be paid on 27 May 2016 to 
shareholders registered at the close of business on 6 May 2016.
Board and employees
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees for their 
continued hard work and support during 2015. This has been another 
strong year for Servelec as a whole and this is down to the dedication 
and enthusiasm of individuals across the Group. 
“This is an excellent set of results, 
delivered alongside important 
operational steps forward, positioning 
the business well for 2016 and beyond.”
Outlook
The Board looks forward to 2016 with optimism as Servelec is well 
positioned for further growth and expansion despite the continuing 
challenges in the Oil and Gas market. Our Health & Social Care division 
will benefit from its strong order book and we look forward to winning 
new business in the North New and North Refresh programmes. We 
expect the business will build upon its major Oceano win in 2015 
providing a strong case study that will, we believe, support further 
growth opportunities in this sector. We anticipate a strong year to come 
from Servelec Corelogic as the market continues to replace older social 
care software systems and we will continue to invest in our relationships 
with new and existing customers.
The Automation division should start to reap the benefits of our 
investment in people and products. For Servelec Controls, our expertise 
in brownfield oil and gas sites and move into remote operations through 
automation is becoming well known within the sector and we are 
experiencing a greater level of interest from prospective clients. Given a 
slow expected rate of recovery in the oil and gas market we have been 
active in diversifying the use of our skills into other relevant sectors and 
we see strong opportunities with valuable addressable markets. 
Servelec Controls performed well in the second half of 2015 and we 
anticipate this continuing during 2016. Servelec Technologies have 
started to witness the upturn in AMP6 related orders, as evidenced by 
the significant recent wins with Southern Water and others. We believe 
our Technologies business will continue to make gains in international 
markets as the investments we have made in our products gain traction 
in the market place. 
The Board believes Servelec is positioned well within its core markets 
and is making gains in new sectors with strong growth potential. The 
Group has the necessary foundations to grow, develop its businesses 
and generate good returns for shareholders and other stakeholders.

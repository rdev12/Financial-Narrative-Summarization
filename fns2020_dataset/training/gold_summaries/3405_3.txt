 Review of operations
Overall the Group has continued to perform well. The Group
acted for 1,381 clients in 2008 compared with 1,379 in 2007.
Of these clients, 256 used more than one of our businesses
(236 in 2007), which represented 66% of total operating
income (2007 – 62%).
In 2008, 170 clients paid us over £100,000, compared with
164 in 2007. Our top 30 clients represented 48% of total
operating income (2007 – 45%).
Our two largest clients represented 18.4% of our operating
income. Both clients have been retained since 2003, are high
margin and have normal renewal terms. No other client
represented more than 3% of our operating income.
Average fee income per client in 2008 was £81,000
compared with £70,000 in 2007. Average income per
employee was £111,000 in 2008 compared with £105,000
in 2007. In 2008, 37% of our income came from overseas
work compared with 34% in 2007.
Bell Pottinger retained its position as No. 1 in the PR Week
League Table, Fast Track remains No. 1 in the Marketing
Sponsorship League Table and VCCP won the Marketing
Week Effectiveness Award for the launch of the O2 arena.
Divisional performance
Trading conditions deteriorated in the second half of 2008
for some of our businesses, whilst others performed ahead
of our expectations. The Public Relations Division was
ahead of budget for 2008, whilst the Advertising and
Marketing Services and Research Divisions were
behind budget.
Public Relations continues to be our largest division, being
55% of operating income (2007 – 56%), Advertising and
Marketing Services was 39% (2007 – 36%) and Research
6% (2007 – 8%).
Public Relations – Bell Pottinger Group including
Good Relations, Harvard and Insight
The Public Relations Division had an extremely good year
with a particularly strong second half. Costs were very
carefully controlled and the 13% increase in operating
income has therefore resulted in a 30% increase in operating
profit. Our geopolitical, brand, technology and Middle East
businesses all performed ahead of our expectations.
Advertising and Marketing Services – VCCP Group,
Fast Track and Teamspirit
Our Advertising and Marketing Services Division had a flat
year with the first half better than the second half. Our sports
marketing, direct marketing, digital, search and brand identity
businesses all performed ahead of 2007.
Research – The Research and Engagement Group
The Research and Engagement Division was budgeted to
improve in the second half of 2008 following the restructuring
we did in the first half. However, due to postponed and
cancelled projects their performance continued to
deteriorate. We still have confidence in the restructuring
we have done and the first quarter of 2009 is looking
encouraging with a healthy new business pipeline.
In addition the launch of Caucus World, our new
digital platform, was delayed due to hold-ups
in software development.

Board changes
On 2 July 2008 The Hon Richard Alston joined the Board.
He previously served as Australian High Commissioner to the
United Kingdom from February 2005 until March 2008, after
a distinguished career in the Australian Parliament as Minister
for Communications, Information, Technology and Arts from
1996 to 2003.
On 16 December 2008 David Allen resigned from the Board
and we thank him for his contribution over several years.
Outlook
We had an excellent 2008 based on our diversified Group,
with particularly strong performances from Public Relations
(Bell Pottinger Group) and Sports Marketing (Fast Track).
The company’s strategy for 2009 is to control costs,
generate cash and focus on new business. We are
concentrating on the growth opportunities we have,
which are mainly in international, sports marketing,
digital, geopolitical and public sector work.
So far the impact on businesses affected by the economic
downturn has been offset by growth in other businesses.

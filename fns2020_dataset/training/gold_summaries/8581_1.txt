2013 was another strong year for ITV, both operationally 
and financially, as we continue to make progress with our 
strategy of growing and rebalancing the business. External 
revenues were up 9%, with non-NAR revenues up £175 
million (17%), and for the fourth year in a row we delivered 
double digit profit growth. 
2013’s performance builds on the consistently strong 
results we have delivered since we announced our strategy. 
Since 2009 we have increased Group external revenues 
by 27%, EBITA before exceptional items (EBITA) by 207%, 
adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 522% and improved 
our cash position by over £750 million, even after returns to 
shareholders and investment in the business. 
Our Broadcast business remains in good shape. In 2013 we 
had the best year-on-year viewing performance for ten years 
with ITV Family SOV up 4%, and the television advertising 
market returned to growth. Online, Pay & Interactive 
revenues continue to grow strongly and are now a material 
part of the business. ITV Studios, which again delivered 
significant revenue growth, is becoming an increasingly 
international business as it grows both organically and 
through selective acquisitions.
Our vision remains to create world-class content, which 
we can make famous on our channels, before exploiting its 
value across multiple platforms, both free and pay, in the UK 
and internationally. While there is still much to do and good 
potential for growth, the progress we are making is clearly 
evident in our results.

2013 operating and financial performance
ITV’s financial results reflect a good performance across the 
business. ITV NAR grew 2% and, in line with our strategy, non-
NAR revenues grew £175 million or 17% to £1,211 million. 
Good revenue growth, together with our tight cost control, 
has led to 21% growth in EBITA before exceptional items 
(EBITA) to £620 million, 27% growth in adjusted profit before 
tax (PBT) to £581 million and 23% growth in adjusted EPS 
to 11.2p. Group margins have improved by three percentage 
points to 26% and we delivered £28 million of cost savings, 
£8 million ahead of our original target.
Broadcast & Online revenues grew by 3% to £1,896 million 
(2012: £1,834 million) and EBITA increased by 20% to £487 
million (2012: £406 million). This was driven by 2% growth in 
ITV Family NAR and 16% growth in Online, Pay & Interactive 
as we have increased the quality and distribution of ITV 
Player and further developed our pay opportunities. 
On-screen we have had a very strong year with ITV share 
of viewing (SOV) up 3% and ITV Family SOV up 4% as we 
have continued to increase the quality and variety of the 
schedule. 
ITV Studios delivered 20% growth in total revenue to £857 
million (2012: £712 million) and 24% growth in EBITA to 
£133 million (2012: £107 million). This was driven by the 
international studios business, with growth coming both 
organically and from the acquisitions we have made in the 
UK and internationally. 
Our continued focus on cash and costs and our strong profit 
to cash conversion, saw us grow our free cash flow by over 
£100 million. We generated £433 million of free cash before 
investment and shareholder returns to end the year with net 
cash of £164 million. We have taken further steps to improve 
the efficiency of the balance sheet with additional debt 
buybacks and the redemption of the convertible bond. 
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 2.4p (2012: 1.8p) 
giving a full year dividend of 3.5p (2012: 2.6p) – an increase 
of 35%. The Board is committed to a progressive dividend, 
taking into account the outlook for the business, while 
balancing the need to invest for growth and to maintain a 
robust financial position.
In addition to the final dividend, the Board is proposing a 
special dividend of 4.0p per share (£161 million). The cash 
distribution reflects the Board’s confidence in the ongoing 
growth and cash generation of the business. Going forward 
we will continue to show capital discipline and balance the 
need to invest for future growth with increasing returns to 
shareholders.

Our strategy and the changing  
media environment
We are now four years into our five year Transformation 
Plan which is based on our four key priorities. We remain 
committed to this strategy as the progress we have made 
over the last four years shows it is the right strategy for ITV.
The demand from viewers for quality content is strong not 
just in the UK but globally. Linear viewing remains healthy 
and we must ensure that our Broadcast business continues 
to be strong, generating significant profits and cash. 
However, we must not be complacent and we must adapt 
to the challenges and opportunities of the dynamic media 
environment in which we operate. 
While on demand is still a relatively small part of total 
viewing, we must make sure that our digital offerings are 
high quality, competitive and widely available so we can keep 
up with changing consumer behaviour and demands. We 
continue to experiment with new free and pay offerings to 
explore how viewers want to consume our content.
In such a rapidly evolving market, creating and owning high 
quality content is more important than ever , so we will 
continue to invest in a quality creative pipeline and exploit 
our advantage as an integrated producer broadcaster .
2014 and beyond
The television advertising market continues to show signs 
of improvement with ITV Family NAR expected to be up 5% 
to 6% in the four months to the end of April. We expect 
to outperform our estimate of the television advertising 
market over the full year . Our good on-screen performance 
in 2013,  the strong 2014 schedule including the FIFA World 
Cup in June and the advertising deals we have done to date, 
puts us in a good position to achieve this. 
Online, Pay & Interactive should deliver another year of good 
revenue growth as we continue to exploit opportunities in 
digital media and drive new revenue streams. Our new pay 
channel, ITV Encore, which will launch on Sky in 2014, will 
contribute towards this. 
We anticipate good revenue growth in ITV Studios, primarily 
driven by the recent acquisitions we have made in the UK 
and internationally. Key to our success is creative content 
and therefore we will continue to invest in the pipeline of 
ideas and look at potential acquisitions and partnerships. 
We remain committed to our strategy of rebalancing ITV 
and expect all parts of the business to see further growth 
in 2014. While a healthy broadcast business remains at the 
core of ITV, going forward we expect growth to increasingly 
come from Online, Pay & Interactive and from ITV Studios 
internationally.

Since 2006, Cape has pursued a 
strategy of value creation through 
growth. This strategy has focused on:
capturing increasing levels of 
maintenance and capital spending to 
maintain and extend the life of ageing 
energy infrastructure in the UK (eg 
British Energy fl eet-wide maintenance 
contract signed in Q1 2009);
building strong positions in high growth 
international markets such as Gulf/
Middle East and Far East/Pacifi c Rim 
(eg Pluto module access and hook up 
in Thailand and Karratha, Western 
Australia in Q3 2008 and Q3 2009);
  capitalising on the increasing 
industry trend towards sourcing 
cost effective bundled multi-
disciplinary services from a single 
source provider (eg BP Federal 
Contract UKCS in Q1 2010); 
maintaining our uncompromising 
safety proposition with an ambition 
to provide injury free project 
execution; and
Chairman’s 
statement
Cape’s businesses delivered a 
robust operating and fi nancial 
performance in 2009.
Sean O’Connor – Chairman
Cape’s businesses delivered a robust 
operating and fi nancial performance 
in 2009 with record revenue of 
£655.1 million (2008: £622.7 million) and 
record adjusted PBT
(1)
 of £60.7 million 
(2008: £48.3 million). Adjusted diluted 
earnings per share
(3)
 increased by 25% to 
37.5 pence (2008: 30.0 pence). With fi ve 
consecutive years of growth, the Group 
has delivered compound annual growth 
in adjusted diluted earnings per share
(3)
 
of 41%.
The cash generative qualities of the 
business were again evident in the 
Group’s performance with strong 
operating cash fl ows of £84.4 million 
(2008: £70.9 million). This solid result was 
achieved despite some intense pricing 
pressures in more mature markets and 
refl ects the rapid and decisive actions 
taken by our business unit heads in 
response to the downturn.
Gearing
(12)
 at 31 December 2009 reduced 
to 42.4% compared to 67.2% at the end 
of 2008, with a further 31% reduction 
in net debt
(6)
 to £113.6 million (2008: 
£165.5 million). This reduces the Group’s 
ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA
(8)
 
to 1.3 times
(7)
 (2008: 2.1 times) and 
represents signifi cant progress towards 
the Board’s current target range of up to 
one times adjusted EBITDA
(8)
.
Market view
Cape largely serves downstream 
energy and resources related markets 
whose longer-term growth prospects 
are robust. We won some important 
milestone contracts with International Oil 
Companies (IOCs), power generators and 
global mining customers last year which 
again showed the compelling nature of 
Cape’s intelligent bundled service 
solution, tailored to meet the needs 
of our clients.
Whilst the Gulf/Middle East market 
remained particularly strong, the 
slowdown in the global economy 
clearly delayed the pace of new orders 
in certain of our markets. However, the 
fundamentals of Cape’s business remain 
strong. The defensive nature of the 
maintenance business, some 48% of 
revenues (2008: 48%), combined with 
the longevity of the typical large industrial 
projects we work on provides excellent 
revenue visibility. 
Rapid response to downturn
Although strong trading continued in 
certain markets, a range of short-term 
initiatives were implemented to conserve 
cash and ensure that all Cape’s 
operations remained profi table and 
robust, even in a prolonged downturn. 
The peripheral Hire and Sales operations 
in the UK together with certain marginal 
operations in Australia and Malta were 
closed, capital expenditure was tightly 
controlled and overhead cost savings 
initiatives were implemented across 
the Group. 
The devolved nature of Cape’s business 
model emphasises accountability and 
responsibility at the local level and 
encourages an entrepreneurial approach 
to running operations. Nowhere is this 
approach more apparent than in the 
timely and decisive actions taken and 
innovative responses to conserving 
cash and cutting cost without impairing 
safety performance, operational integrity, 
or future growth opportunities.

building on Cape’ s world class 
reputation and track record for 
consistent project execution and 
delivery on time and on budget.
In 2006 and 2007, Cape’s strategy was 
delivered through a combination of both 
organic and acquisition-led growth to 
build a portfolio diversifi ed by geographic 
region and service offering and with 
the scale, capacity and capability to 
compete for large-scale, new projects. 
This transformational period was 
completed in 2007 with the three 
acquisitions in Australia. These 
acquisitions were supplemented by the 
targeted bolt-on acquisitions of specialist 
cleaning businesses DBI and Endecon 
and further broadened Cape’s service 
offering. The transformation of acquired 
operations and the development of an 
integrated, international business under 
the Cape brand is now well advanced 
across our existing footprint. 
The successful delivery of this strategy 
to date has created an international 
industrial services group, focused on 
the energy and mining services sectors 
with a strong track record and reputation 
for successful project execution, and 
winning awards for innovation and 
safety from major international clients.
Delivering future growth
The ongoing focus on ROMA
(13)
 
enhancement and operational excellence 
will continue to play a signifi cant role in 
Cape’s strategy. 
Overseas, a number of substantial 
announced projects are now reaching 
the fi nal approval and construction 
stage in the Far East/Pacifi c Rim, Gulf/
Middle East and North Africa and should 
provide Cape with real organic growth 
opportunities over the medium term.
Whilst we see few opportunities for 
substantial growth in the UK in the short 
to medium term, we have reinforced our 
positions both onshore and offshore in 
the mature maintenance led UK market 
and are increasingly well placed to 
benefi t from the onshore new build 
power generation opportunities 
and North Sea asset abandonment 
programmes that are likely to come 
through towards the end of the decade.
With the de-gearing of the Group 
nearing the Board’s (1x adjusted 
EBITDA
(8)
) target, selective bolt on 
acquisitions in international markets 
will be considered.
Industrial Disease Claims (IDC) 
Scheme and provision for 
future claims
Following further work from independent 
actuaries in the fi nal quarter of last year, 
the Board considers that the value of the 
total future asbestos-related liabilities 
can be estimated with suffi cient reliability 
to enable a provision to be recorded. 
The Group has previously provided for 
the estimated costs of notifi ed claims 
only and disclosed by way of note 
details of actuarial assessments of 
the total discounted aggregate liability. 
The recent actuarial work conducted 
by the Scheme’s independent actuaries 
concluded that a reasonable estimate 
of the net discounted reserve would lie 
in the range of £60 million to £100 million 
with a central estimate of £79 million. 
Further detail is provided in note 26 to 
the Group fi nancial statements. With 
the increased confi dence this study 
provided, the Board has recognised an 
additional provision of £70.5 million and 
considers that in making this change to 
the Group’s fi nancial statements they are 
now more informative and meaningful. 
It should be noted that whilst we are 
making full provision, on the basis of the 
information currently available Scheme 
funds currently equate to eleven years 
of anticipated claims.
In addition, the Emphasis of Matter 
paragraph with regards to the 
fundamental uncertainty of IDCs is 
not required in respect of the 2009 
fi nancial statements. The total provision 
for Industrial Disease related liabilities 
at 31 December 2009 is £80.2 million 
and includes estimated costs of 
£9.7 million (2008: £9.7 million) in 
respect of notifi ed claims.
Board
With the increasing international focus 
of the business, we recognise it would 
be benefi cial to broaden the Board. 
A process has therefore commenced, 
overseen by the Nomination Committee, 
to appoint two additional Non-Executive 
Directors to assist the Group’s objectives 
of growing its international business and 
also of returning to the Full List. Although 
I shall be remaining on the Board, it is 
my intention to step down as Chairman 
later this year.
People
Cape now has over 17,000 people and 
again delivered in excess of 41 million 
man hours in 2009. I would like to thank 
them all for their continuing dedication 
and commitment and also the Executive 
Board and regional management teams 
whose leadership once again delivered 
a record fi nancial performance.
Outlook and prospects
The ongoing investment in large 
industrial projects in the Gulf/Middle East 
combined with our rapid but measured 
response to the downturn in other 
regions in the early part of the year 
delivered a creditable result in 2009. 
Whilst we continue to be suitably 
cautious about growth in 2010, we 
believe the swift resumption of E&C 
contract awards and investment in key 
growth projects offers a more favourable 
environment to drive sustainable organic 
growth in 2011 and beyond.
Cape’s investments over the last three 
years have delivered a focused business 
with real scale and internationally 
recognised capability and the Board is 
confi dent the Group is ideally positioned 
to benefi t from the increasing capex 
spend of our energy and resources 
sector clients.
Our increased confi dence in the medium-
term outlook and Cape’s encouraging 
prospects and fi nancial position, have 
enabled the Board to signal a fi rm intent 
to reinstate dividend payments later 
this year. Cape last paid a dividend to 
shareholders ten years ago, and it would 
be particularly pleasing to mark another 
step in Cape’s rejuvenation and recovery 
with a return to the dividend list.

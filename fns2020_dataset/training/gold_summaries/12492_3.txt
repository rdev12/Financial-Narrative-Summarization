Chairman’s statement
Overview
Market share gains and some 
large customer contract wins 
attest to a year of achievement 
in difficult economic circumstances.
Markets for the most part, remained
slow particularly in North America
but, despite this, we have continued
to improve our ability to service 
our customers. Gross margins 
have been maintained and costs
tightly controlled, so that net margins
have remained robust while working
capital has continued to be closely
managed.
We have gained major financial
benefits through the capital
restructuring announced in April
2002, including increased earnings
per share and dividend cover,
improved cash flow of £9 million 
for this and future years, reduced
financial gearing and a more
balanced capital structure.
We have developed comprehensive
skills to capitalise on the accelerating
demand by major companies to
improve the effectiveness of their
indirect materials procurement and
inventory management. These skills
have opened access to large
customers and we are achieving
significant success which would
previously have been beyond our
reach. There remains significant
potential to gain market share and the
Group is in a strong position for further
progress when markets improve. 
Financial results
Group sales for the year were 
£759.0 million (2002: £806.4 million)
reflecting the tough market
conditions, although on a sales per
day basis the Group’ s businesses
returned to year on year growth in
the second half of the year and were
up 2.8 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Profit before tax and goodwill
amortisation and loss on disposal 
of businesses was £67.2 million
(2002: £72.5 million), with adjusted
earnings per share of 11.2 pence
(2002: 9.2 pence). 
Statutory profit before tax was
£59.8 million (2002: £60.0 million)
and basic earnings per share were
9.3 pence (2002: 4.6 pence).
The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 5 pence (2002: 5 pence),
making a total for the year of 9 pence
(2002: 9 pence). The dividend is
covered 1.1 times. The final dividend
is payable on 25th June 2003 to
shareholders on the register on
30th May 2003.
Strategic progress
The Group has continued to 
execute its strategy of forging 
closer relationships with customers
by understanding and satisfying 
their needs. The Group has
strengthened its competitive position
in all its major territories by improving
performance and introducing new
products and added value services.
Work has been focused on winning
additional sales in the absence of any
help from the market. This has been
achieved through concentrating on
improving operational effectiveness
and increasing share by targeting
specific market segments. Closer
customer relationships are being built
using the newly installed customer
relationship management software.
Added value services are helping
customers increase their own
productivity and reduce the overall
cost of indirect material procurement.
Evidence of the success of this
strategy is demonstrated by the
agreements signed with Vauxhall,
Lockheed Martin and the US
Government in 2002 and
Rolls-Royce in March of this year. Premier Farnell plc Chairman’s statement

Business portfolio
Early in the year, the Group sold
D-A Lubricants, the specialist oil
blending business based in
Indianapolis. This resulted in a loss
before tax on the disposal of
£4.9 million, including £2.6 million of
goodwill previously eliminated against
reserves.
Buck & Hickman, the leading UK
distributor of tools and industrial
products, acquired in July 2001, 
has been successfully integrated 
into the Group. The Buck & Hickman
product range and its expertise in
vendor managed inventory services
both contributed to the Group being
awarded important supply contracts
by Vauxhall and Rolls-Royce. 
Balance sheet
In April 2002, the Company
announced a special right, 
for a limited period, for Preference
Shareholders to convert their
Cumulative Redeemable Preference
Shares into Ordinary Shares, 
at an enhanced conversion rate. 
This resulted in 70 per cent of the
Company’ s Preference Shares 
being converted and 89.8 million
new Ordinary Shares, arising from
the conversion, were issued. 
The conversion has resulted in
increased earnings per share and
reduced financial gearing. It has also
improved cash flow by more than 
£9 million this year, enhanced
dividend cover and provided a more
balanced capital structure. 
The Company’ s borrowings include
$155 million 7.0 per cent Senior
Notes, repayable in June 2003. 
In anticipation of this repayment, 
the Company has secured additional
funding, to be drawn in June 2003,
of $225 million, comprising
$159 million Senior Notes payable
2013 at an effective interest rate 
of 5.9 per cent and $66 million
Senior Notes payable 2010 at an
effective interest rate of 5.3 per cent.
The additional funds will be used to
repay other loans. This refinancing, 
at investment grade interest rates,
demonstrates the financial
soundness of the Group. 
Staff
On behalf of the Board, I particularly
wish to thank all our employees 
for their hard work and commitment
during what has been another
challenging year. It is their
determination and effort that has
resulted in the quality of the Group’ s
businesses being further enhanced
and it is the reliability and
resourcefulness of our employees
which encourages our customers 
to buy repeatedly from the Group.
We have pleasure in welcoming
William Korb to the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. Mr Korb, 
a US citizen, was President and 
CEO of Gilbarco Incorporated, 
the leading manufacturer of retail
petrol pumps, from 1988 to 1999.
He is a non-executive director of
Cambrex Corporation, which is 
listed on the NYSE.
Outlook
The Group’ s principal businesses
have secured market share gains
against a background of harsh
economic and industry conditions.
This progress has been supported
by important initiatives in many areas,
including customer eProcurement
arrangements, vendor managed
inventory installations, increased
product ranges, improved service
levels and geographic expansion.
The Group has further enhanced its
proposition to customers during the
year, enabling them to increase
productivity. Notwithstanding the
global political and economic outlook
and the lack of confidence in major
industrial markets, the Board remains
confident that it is pursuing the
appropriate strategy.

increased regulation, more complex 
investment strategies, cost reduction and 
demands for better communication.
Carl Bacon
I look forward to leveraging  
your Company’s substantial 
investment in StatPro 
Revolution to assist asset 
managers achieve their 
objectives, reduce costs, meet 
complex regulations, improve 
data management and replace 
legacy systems with more 
flexible and scalable solutions 
delivered via the cloud.
Progress
I am pleased to report that your Company increased total annualised revenue  
by 4% to £29.4 million at constant currency (2013 actual: £28.7 million) including  
a 68% increased contribution from StatPro Revolution of £5.4 million  
(2013: £3.2 million). Total revenue increased by 6% at constant currency but  
was 1% lower at actual rates at £32.0 million (2013: £32.5 million). As a result  
of continued investment in StatPro Revolution, sales and client services,  
profit before tax decreased by 24% to £2.4 million (2013: £3.1 million).  
StatPro Revolution related recurring revenue now amounts to £12.0 million  
(2013: £9.1 million), representing 46% of total software recurring revenue (2013: 37%).
Dividend
Your Board is proposing a final dividend of 2.05p per share for 2014 payable  
on 27 May 2015 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on  
1 May 2015 taking the total dividend to 2.9p per share (2013: 2.8p per share). 
Products
In 2014, total research and development expenditure increased by 12% to  
£5.0 million (2013: £4.4 million) representing 16% of Group revenue. The total cash 
expenditure in 2014 on StatPro Revolution, including marketing and other costs, 
amounted to £5.5 million (2013: £4.9 million).
Regulation continues to drive client requirements and hence product 
development. In November 2014, StatPro won the Waters Buy-Side Technology 
award for ‘Best Risk Initiative’ for our Risk Limits and Commitment Leverage 
Monitoring Module. This premium module, available as part of StatPro Revolution, 
is aimed at managers who need to report data for the UCITS and AIFMD 
regulations. 
People
I am delighted, once again, to congratulate our employees, our greatest asset,  
for their commitment to achieving your Company’s objectives, whilst they manage 
the transformation to a pure, cloud-based analytics provider.
Prospects
Asset managers continue to grapple with increased regulation, more complex 
investment strategies, cost reduction and demands for better communication.  
I look forward to leveraging your Company’s substantial investment in StatPro 
Revolution to assist asset managers achieve their objectives, reduce costs, meet 
complex regulations, improve data management and replace legacy systems 
with more flexible and scalable solutions delivered via the cloud.

Alpha Airports Group Plc
Annual Report 2004/05
Innovation
Exceptional new consumer experiences
have transformed our business in recent
years. Despite EU enlargement, which
reduced our UK retail sales potential by
an estimated 2% in the year, our newly
branded UK retail offers enjoyed sales
growth of nearly 9%. For example, our
latest ‘pink, everyone can buy’ Alpha
Airport shop at Newcastle International
Airport generated an excellent 24%
sales advance in its first year . Our airline
customers continually seek to upgrade
and streamline their inflight catering
offers, and we are delighted to have
launched the ‘trayless meal’ concept,
Blue Sky Service, with MyTravel Airways
on a globally back-catered basis. Blue
Sky Service provides major benefits to
airline and consumer alike, and will be
offered to customers as the basis of
future growth in our UK and emerging
European marketplace.
It’s always rewarding to be recognised
for our innovation and service excellence,
and last year Alpha won two Frontier 
and two Mercury Awards for innovation. 
We were equally delighted to be
recognised as the leading global flight
caterer by United Airlines and All 
Nippon Airways for Heathrow, and by
Continental Airlines for Edinburgh.
Compliance
Compliance remains critical to our
focus. With our accredited training
manuals and ongoing involvement 
in the IFCA/IFSA food safety code 
of practice for the worldwide airline
catering industry, we are among the
highest achievers in hygiene and food
safety. Foreign body incidents from
supplied products were down 24.5% 
in the year, with Alpha’s own attributable
rate down from 22.3% to 17.0%.
The Department for Transport has
maintained tight security procedures,
and renewal of our operating licences
depends on compliance. So we are
constantly monitoring our performance,
and have introduced upgraded training,
policies and procedures for all our staff.
Our rigorous compliance policies and
training have also reduced RIDDOR
accidents by 33.3%, and reduced reported
total or potential accidents by 29.5%.
Our business
Air travellers do not have to eat or
shop in transit; it is only by offering
outstanding retail and catering
experiences that we will achieve our
vision of building an exceptional,
international, world-class service
company. Experience tells us that
if the offer represents good value, 
the choice is genuine, the buying
appropriate for the market, and the
experience enticing, more and more
customers will stop, shop and eat.
Our exciting growth market
83% of our sales still come from
airports across the UK. With EU
deregulation in full force, lower fares
and wider choice have created an
explosion in passenger numbers,
with a particular focus on the growth
of regional airports. This is a thriving
and continually developing market,
which has given us more than 8%
passenger growth in the year . It
continues to be the key driver for our
major UK business – and therefore
that of the Group.
Chief Executive’s review
“Alpha’s business is retail and catering for airlines
and airports, and our essence is ‘people making
travel special’ . ”

Our people
Creating a great place to work remains
a critical strategic priority. Alpha
Heroes, our successful reward and
recognition programme, has been
extended to cover all our UK, Eire and
Jersey staff, with a complementary
Local Heroes scheme at local unit
level. Our employees have endorsed
these initiatives wholeheartedly, with
almost 3,000 nominations for staff who
‘go the extra mile’.
Our confidential, independent annual
UK staff survey registered a 76%
overall satisfaction score: an excellent
upper quartile performance when
benchmarked against other UK
employers. Staff turnover continues 
to decline, from 24.3% to 21.9%. Once
again, the Board would like to extend
its thanks to all our staff for their
contributions to our success during 
the year . Without them, it would not 
be achievable.
Always improving
Ours is an exciting and challenging
marketplace. We must continually
improve and innovate to position
ourselves for future growth and
financial success. In our UK Retail and
Flight bond network, we are focusing
on IT improvement and upgraded
supply-chain capabilities. In our UK
Flight Services business, we improved
productivity by a further 6%, giving a
total improvement of 58% over the past
five years. This gives us the cost base
and practices to be fully competitive,
both in the UK and internationally. 
We have centralised assembly of the
fresh, high-quality food offers for our
new Blue Sky Service in Birmingham,
and established a national distribution
service. We plan to commercialise this
new offer with other UK and
international customers.
After a good first half performance,
our sales growth temporarily 
dipped in the second half from 
11.9% to 9.4%. With higher targeted
development costs and start-up
losses, underlying profits in the
second half were disappointing. 
A return on sales of 3.3% in the
second half, with a full year return on
sales of 3.9%, down from the previous
year’s 4.9% was below our target 
of 5% plus. However, we are 
confident of further growth in 2005/06,
and are anticipating an improved
return on sales.

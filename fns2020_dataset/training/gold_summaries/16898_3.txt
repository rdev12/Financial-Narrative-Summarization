 Walker Greenbank PLC, Annual Report & Accounts 2014
02
Overview
It is pleasing to report a further year of progress at Walker 
Greenbank and to announce another significant increase in 
profitability and dividend payments. Looking back over the 
past four years, we have delivered double digit growth in 
underlying profitability each year. This track record has been 
achieved in a mixed global economic environment. As we 
begin our current financial year, it is encouraging to see 
positive trends in the UK economy, which is of particular 
importance as the UK, where we are market leader, is our 
largest market by sales. We are also encouraged by the 
economic backdrop in many of our overseas markets.
We have achieved the past four years of growth through the 
delivery of our strategy, in which continued investment in 
product, marketing and manufacturing is a recurring theme. 
During the year we extended the capabilities of our UK 
factories, including a £1.75 million investment in a hybrid 
rotary/gravure machine at our wallpaper printing factory in 
Loughborough. This custom-built machine has allowed the 
creation of a highly innovative textured wallpaper, which 
Harlequin launched earlier this month under a new brand 
named Anthology. Anthology marks the first time that we 
have specifically designed wallpaper for overseas markets. 
Our strategy of licensing our designs for use in lifestyle 
products, such as bedlinen, has been an important 
contributor to growth. Last year, our global licensing income 
grew by £256,000 to more than £2.1 million. This has made 
a significant contribution to our profit growth but, because 
licence income is essentially a royalty payment, this income 
is not proportionally reflected in turnover growth. When we 
created the Scion brand, which was launched in early 2012, 
licensing was an integral part of the brand’s development. In 
the short period of time since Scion’s launch we have already 
seen successful ranges of Scion bedlinen, rugs, towels, and 
other products. 
International sales were up 6.6% during the year at 
£23.8 million, which represents 39% of our Brands sales. 
Economic recovery in the US helped fuel strong growth, which 
we continue to see as a major opportunity for the Company. 
During the year we commenced the extension and redesign 
of our New York showroom, which, along with other initiatives,

will continue to drive US sales. We have also opened a 
new showroom in Dubai, complementing our existing 
international showrooms in New York and Paris and our 
partnership showrooms in Russia and China. 
Financials
Total sales increased 3.6% to £78.4 million (2013: £75.7 
million). The operating profit before an accounting charge 
relating to the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) rose 14.2% 
to £7.51 million (2013: £6.58 million). The profit from 
operations was up 12.2% to £6.54 million (2013: £5.83 
million). The interest charge has reduced from £193,000 to 
£180,000. The net defined benefit pension charge has risen 
from £704,000 to £868,000 as a consequence of costs 
associated with the triennial valuation and a reduction in the 
expected return on scheme assets.
Profit before tax excluding the LTIP accounting charge and 
the net defined benefit charge was £7.33 million (2013: £6.38 
million) an increase of 14.9%. The profit before tax after the 
two charges was £5.50 million (2013: £4.93 million). The profit 
after tax was £5.04 million (2013: £3.96 million) and basic 
adjusted earnings per share were up 20.1 % after removing 
the LTIP accounting charge, net defined benefit charge and 
the deferred tax credit arising from LTIP.
The cash inflow from operating activities was £5.95 million 
(2013: £5.80 million), reflecting strong operating profits and 
continued investment in product. The Group has continued 
to invest with capital expenditure of £4.74 million (2013: 
£3.12 million). Despite this investment, the Group had net 
funds at the year end of £1.49 million (2013: £1.16 million). 
Dividend
During the year, the Group has paid a final dividend for the 
year to 31 January 2013 of 1.25p per share and an interim 
dividend of 0.28p per share. The Directors recommend the 
payment of a final dividend of 1.57p per share (2013: 1.25p) 
which will be payable on 8 August 2014 to shareholders on 
the register on 18 July 2014. This brings the total dividend 
for the year to 1.85p per share (2013: 1.48p) an increase 
of 25.0%. 
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our 
management and employees for their contribution to 
another successful year. Post the year end, I was delighted 
to welcome Mike Gant to Walker Greenbank as Chief 
Financial Officer. He brings a depth of international, financial, 
and brand experience to the Company. I would like to thank 
Mike’s predecessor, Alan Dix, for his valuable contribution 
during his nine years as Group Finance Director.
Outlook
The current financial year has started well. In the first 12 
weeks our total Brands sales are up 6.7% compared with the 
same period last year helped by sales in the UK, our largest 
market, up 9.4%. Overseas Brands sales are up 2.8% in 
reportable currency and, encouragingly, 7.1 % ahead in 
constant currency. Manufacturing has performed strongly 
during the first 12 weeks, driven by digital printing.
We have recently launched some exciting and innovative 
products, including Anthology and Scion’s third collection, 
and are continuing to develop our export business. With an 
improving economic environment, we expect to drive sales 
growth in both UK and international markets and look 
forward to the year ahead with confidence.

Going concern
After making enquiries and reviewing forecasts, the directors have, at the time of approving the financial
statements, concluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these
financial statements.
Application of principles
Directors
The group supports the concept of an effective board, leading and controlling the group. The board is responsible
for approving group policy and strategy. It meets regularly and has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to
it for decision. Management supplies the board with appropriate and timely information and the directors are free
to seek any further information that they consider necessary. All directors have access to advice from the
Company Secretary and independent professionals at the group’s expense. 
Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
Company law in the United Kingdom requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year,
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the group and of the profit or loss of the
group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
n select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently
n make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
n state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply
with the Companies Act 1985, for safeguarding assets of the group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are also responsible for the preparation of the directors’
report and other information in the annual report.
The board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the group maintains systems of internal control to provide 
it with reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial information used within the business and for
publication and that assets are safeguarded. 
Remuneration policy
The group’s policy on executive directors’ remuneration is to:
n attract and retain high quality executives by paying competitive remuneration packages relevant to each director’ s
role, experience and the external market. The packages include contribution to private medical insurance
n give incentive to directors to maximise shareholder value through annual bonus schemes
Service agreements
No director has a service agreement with a notice period that exceeds three months.

 4 Weatherly International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Overview
In a pivotal year, we have made 
significant progress towards 
bringing our Tschudi operation into 
production. I want to be extremely 
clear to our investors, customers 
and staff about the significance 
of Tschudi. Once in operation, it 
will transform the performance of 
Weatherly and, at the time of writing, 
we are ahead of schedule and looking 
forward to Tschudi producing its first 
copper in the second quarter of 2015.
As well as our ‘on the ground’ 
progress we should not overlook 
the significant achievement of 
delivering the successful funding 
of the Tschudi project. We used 
operating and ‘build own operate’ 
(BOO) contracts to both reduce the 
capital requirement and minimise our 
own operational risk and then funded 
the remainder entirely through a 
debt facility of US$88m from Orion.
This funding arrangement was 
a significant achievement for a 
company with a market capitalisation 
(at the time) of around US$20m and 
I should like to pay tribute to our 
CEO Rod Webster and his team for 
a job very well done. Looking to the 
future, and once Tschudi is up and 
running, your Board will examine 
the possibilities of developing some 
of the potential copper deposits 
in the Windhoek area; we believe 
these may offer us an excellent 
opportunity to make the most of 
our Concentrator’s idle capacity.
We should also note the benefits 
of operating in Namibia. The 
internationally-respected Fraser 
Institute (which ranks countries 
according to their disposition 
towards mining companies) says 
that Namibia is one of the top three 
countries in Africa. The country is a 
stable multi-party democracy with a 
long-established Mining Act and we 
can be very proud that, during our 
eight years in the country, Weatherly 
has developed strong relationships 
with all our stakeholders.
Once Tschudi is  
in operation it  
will transform  
the performance 
of Weatherly

Financial Performance
While copper output and costs 
were largely unchanged from the 
previous year, copper prices declined 
by some 15% further reducing 
already tight margins. Despite this, 
the operations remained cashflow 
positive throughout and were able 
to meet all ongoing capital and debt 
repayments. To reduce costs and 
restore margins in a lower copper 
price environment, the Company 
undertook a radical overhaul of 
its operations aimed at boosting 
productivity in the second half of 
the year. Unfortunately, this year 
investors will only see the costs of 
these changes while the benefits will 
accrue in the following year. However, 
the changes we have introduced 
should help us take Central 
Operations closer towards our goal 
of 7,000 tonnes of copper per year 
and in doing so restore profitability.
To further improve the Company’s 
cash position, two equity 
placements totalling $4.6m were 
made during the year, the second 
tranche at a significant premium 
to the prevailing share price.
The Board remains confident about 
the long-term prospects of copper. 
Countries around the world will 
continue the now established trend 
of urbanisation and, in so doing, 
will continue to drive demand for 
copper and its applications in wire, 
cables, electronics and electric 
motors. Global copper production 
is currently running at around 17 
million tonnes per year. Worldwide, 
consumption of copper over the 
next 24 years is predicted to exceed 
all of the copper ever mined! 
Management
On 31 December 2013 Max Herbert 
retired as Company Secretary after 
five years of excellent service. The 
Board’s thanks go to Max and we 
wish him every success in the future. 
The Company Secretary duties have 
now been taken over by our Chief 
Financial Officer, Kevin Ellis. I would 
like to thank all of Team Namibia 
where our local Board and strong 
management group continue to 
work diligently to take the Company 
into its exciting next phase.
China Africa Resources
During the year, China Africa 
Resources plc, in which Weatherly 
holds a 25% stake, completed a pre-
feasibility study for the development 
of the Berg Aukas lead/zinc mine, 
also in Namibia. The pre-feasibility 
study conclusions were that a 
mine would be viable and that the 
Company should proceed with 
the next stage of development. 
Finally, it just remains for me to 
thank all our shareholders for their 
support during the year. I hope you 
will share the Board’s confidence as 
we look towards the next 12 months 
and the successes it should bring.

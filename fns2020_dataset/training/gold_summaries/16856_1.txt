VT recognises its obligations and takes responsibility for
the wider impacts of our operations on society. Part of
delivering that responsibility is open communication and
this year we have widened the scope of our reporting on
Corporate Responsibility (CR).
A major part of VT’s operations has connections with 
the defence industry. We recognise that this places an
ethical responsibility on the group to ensure that in all our
dealings we not only meet legal requirements but ensure
our own internal values are not compromised. In 2005 
we introduced a new suite of policies to assist us in
addressing these issues.
Last year also saw continued focus on health and 
safety including the alignment of our operations with
detailed management requirements and expectations.
Next year we will further consolidate our health and 
safety governance processes and focus on delivering
improvements around specific areas supporting 
our overall group visions and values.
Our employee feedback is very positive on the action
programme to deliver our values. I am very encouraged 
by this progress and by the openness of the culture 
within the group. 
The excellent financial results in this report have their roots
in outstanding performance by the individuals who make
up the group, all of whom we thank for their efforts. We
will continue to ensure sharing in success through the
development and tailoring of our reward programmes.
Making CR part of the way we do business requires
focus and resource and 2006 saw the appointment of
Barbara Harrison as Director for Health, Safety and
Environment to lead our efforts in this field. As well 
as improving governance, we are giving priority to
quantifying our environmental aspects and impacts and
to the robustness of our data collection processes. 
Also next year we will be re-affirming CR on the boardroom
agenda and further developing our supporting polices
and frameworks. The engagement of our stakeholders in
identifying the issues that really matter and the development
of our CR strategic plan will be paramount.

 HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT  / 15
The Group enjoyed another year of significant progress, 
particularly in expanding capacity across the world, adding critical 
mass in underutilised locations and opening up new markets. 
Where trading conditions were favourable, such as in the USA and 
UK, the Group increased revenues and profits while investing in 
future growth by adding to headcount. 
Despite weak demand for permanent hiring in Mainland Europe, 
the Group increased profit contribution from Sweden and Belgium 
and improved financial performance in Germany in the second 
half. In markets where trading conditions were challenging, 
management focused on restructuring the businesses affected. 
In Norway the recruitment business was restructured following 
a sharp downturn in the domestic economy, and in Germany 
a strategic review of the outsourcing business is under way, 
re-aligning it towards growth markets and making investment 
available to develop innovative software products.
Currency headwinds and sterling-based reported results mask 
a strong operational and financial performance particularly at 
local currency level in relation to the prior year. For example, the 
depreciation of the euro and the Swedish krona were two main 
factors in translating underlying growth in turnover of 3.9%* 
and therefore growth in market share into a reported decline in 
revenues in Europe of 1.9%. Currency depreciation was gradual 
over the period with the impact increasing towards the end of 
the year. Until exchange rates stabilise year-on-year this effect 
will continue to mask the underlying strength of the Group’s 
performance.
In addition, the Group has been investing in Asia with the 
longer-term strategic goal of deriving new sources of revenues 
and profits to add to its European and US footprint. With the 
exception of Vietnam, progress at the contribution level was 
slower than expected, as the Group had planned breaking into 
profit earlier than is now realistic. The main driver for this was 
the continued challenging Australian market caused by the 
decline in the resources sector and the slowdown in Hong 
Kong and China. Finally, the office in Tokyo benefited from the 
acquisition of Beaumont KK, an executive search team, resulting 
in synergies between the existing outsourcing service and the 
new recruitment team.
More detail about the performance of the business is set out 
below by region.
United Kingdom and Ireland 
 
Revenue in the UK and Ireland increased by 2.7% to £229.8m 
(2014: £223.7m) and gross profit increased by 8.4% to £36.2m 
(2014: £33.4m). Operating profit was up 16.6% at £3.7m** 
compared to £3.2m the previous year. 
This was a strong performance, as the business capitalised on 
market share gains and continued with investment to expand 
capacity during the recession. 
Demand for contingent technology professionals continued to 
be the strongest area of the market. London, and the Finance 
and Banking sectors in particular, were buoyant. It has been 
widely reported that broader demand for executive and higher-
salary positions did not demonstrate similar growth and this has 
been the Group’s experience too. However, Education, Health, 
Consumer and Board recruitment has been active. We have also

seen clients recruit strategic hires with an emphasis on gender 
balance and diversity. Interim management reported a steady 
performance with an increasing pipeline of opportunities as the 
economy continued to improve.
Growth came from the recently established locations in the UK, 
Newcastle, Bristol and Warrington, with the larger hubs such as 
Birmingham and Manchester broadly flat against record results 
in the prior year. In Scotland, the referendum reduced demand 
for permanent hires, but the number of contractors out at the 
year-end was up by 87% compared to the previous year. In 
Ireland, continued strong demand from mainly US and European 
multinationals for IT contractors drove overall growth up 22%* in 
gross profit on the prior year. The recently established office in 
Cork also delivered good growth albeit from a low base, up 94%* 
on the prior year.
Gross profit from Offshore IT Services was once again the fastest-
growing service, up 17% following a strong year of new business 
sales, underpinning the UK profitability and cementing key 
recruitment client relationships. 
Mainland Europe
 
Revenue in Mainland Europe was £413.2m (2014: £421.2m) and 
gross profit was £37.4m (2014: £40.2m). On a constant currency 
basis, revenue increased by 3.9% and gross profit remained level. 
Operating profit was materially aligned to the prior year at £5.5m 
(2014: £5.6m) but increased by 3.0% on a constant currency basis. 
Currency headwinds were the key feature of the eurozone results. 
The decline in revenue was mainly due to the impact of the 
weakening euro, a change in the mix in favour of higher-margin 
contract recruitment and a decline in permanent revenues in 
the eurozone with the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and 
Germany all reporting declines. 
Results from the Benelux countries were robust, with revenue 
overall increasing 7.5%* as clients continued to favour temporary 
recruitment over permanent recruitment. The business acquired 
in 2012, Talent IT in Antwerp, delivered a strong result in its final 
earnout year with gross profit up 25%*. The Netherlands reported 
a small decline of 2% in gross profit* mainly related to lower 
permanent recruitment. 
In the Nordics, gross profit declined overall as a result of the 
weak performance in Norway. The Group’s business in Sweden 
performed well with overall gross profit up 16%* despite 
challenging trading conditions, with the interim management 
business reporting the strongest growth, up 43%*. Finland and 
Denmark, although small, both reported strong increases in gross 
profit. Norway’s economy has been impacted by weakening 
domestic demand in the first half of the year and a significant 
decline in the price of oil in the second half such that gross profit 
was down by 37%*. The downsizing of the operation and property 
was not sufficient to return the Norwegian business to breakeven 
by the end of the year although we expect a smaller loss going 
into the 2016 financial year.
The results from Central & Eastern Europe, which include 
Germany, Switzerland and Poland, were also mixed. In Switzerland 
and Germany, recruitment gross profit declined by 4%* and 6%* 
respectively. However, in Germany a weak first half was offset by 
a much stronger second half mainly due to increasing demand for 
engineering and employed IT consultants. Executive recruitment 
in Poland was lower than the previous year, however technology 
recruitment was strong with a 94% increase in gross profit*.
United States
Revenue in the USA increased by 1.6% to £47.7m (2014: £46.9m) 
and gross profit increased by 3.7% to £11.8m (2014: £11.4m), 
while operating profit remained flat. 
The US economy was the strongest economy across the Group 
during the year to January 2015. The business invested in 
headcount (+11%) as confidence in the recovery grew stronger. 
Permanent recruitment was robust as the pipeline of orders for 
permanent hires continued to improve with net fees up 10.9%* 
on the prior year, with the Seattle office generating the highest 
proportion. Executive search was up 15%* boosted by demand 
for senior executives to drive technology-based digital business 
strategies in larger companies, reflecting the strength of the US 
jobs market.
A natural swing in demand occurred during the year from contract 
to permanent as clients switched their resourcing strategies to 
filling long-term permanent positions. This impacted contribution 
and led to a small decline in core, higher-margin, contracting gross 
profit over the year. This decline was offset by strong growth 
in the new Enterprise Technical Delivery Service, which grew by 
31%*. This service provides contract resources to large enterprises 
mainly through a vendor management programme using the 
Group’s unique offshore sourcing strategy. 
The acute skills shortage combined with investment in digital 
resulted in many clients, mainly in the media sector, resourcing 
projects with offshore skills based in Vietnam, resulting in an 
increase of 26% in gross profit* from this service.

Asia Pacific
 
Revenue in Asia Pacific increased by 8.8% to £6.0m (2014: £5.5m) 
and gross profit increased by 11.4% to £4.0m (2014: £3.6m). 
Operating loss was £0.3m (2014: £0.1m profit) due to investment 
in fee-earning headcount and new offices.
Although progress was slower than initially expected, results from 
the region were still encouraging with core revenues, excluding 
business process outsourcing, up 33% in reported currency. 
Continued investment in headcount organically in Hong Kong 
and Vietnam, and by acquisition in Tokyo, resulted in a 16% 
increase overall. While Australia remains challenging, Hong Kong 
and Vietnam continue to grow their pipelines and headcount. 
The Tokyo team have experienced a mixed six months with the 
integration process a distraction as they settle into the Group. 
However, we are confident that the business will be back on track 
in the year ahead.
Future 
During the 2015 financial year, the Group expanded fee-earning 
capacity by a significant 10% overall as the recovery gradually 
took hold. With stronger economic growth, low unemployment 
and rising business confidence in the USA and the UK, stability 
in Europe and a return to growth in Asia, the jobs markets will 
continue to improve. In Mainland Europe, stability appears to 
be returning to the sector after the uncertainty in the latter part 
of 2014. A strategic review to explore options going forward is 
under way in relation to the German outsourcing business. In 
Asia, pipelines are indicating an improving trend into the second 
quarter of the 2016 financial year. 
By continuing to invest in the Group’s capacity, including its ability 
to source and recruit anywhere in the world from its offshore 
location in Vietnam, there is confidence that, subject to further 
volatility in the currency markets, the Group has every prospect of 
growing now and in the future.

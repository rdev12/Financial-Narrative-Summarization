Advent Communications
Vislink plc
Advent revolutionised television news 
with the world’s first commercial “flyaway”
satellite news-gathering (SNG) system 
in 1989. For the first time, TV news crews 
were within hours of providing live coverage
of almost any major story, anywhere in the
world. A member of the Group since 2000,
the company manufactures world-class
carbon fibre antennas, up-link trucks and
electronics, and has offices in London,
Singapore and Dubai. Their customers
include Reuters, the BBC and most major
international broadcasters. Their equipment
has also been used extensively by the 
UK armed forces to provide tactical 
and strategic communications in Iraq 
and Afganistan.
Link Research
Link’s unique encoding technology 
and modulation techniques enable the 
vast volumes of data generated by an 
HD camera to be transmitted over a 
wireless link with almost no delay. While the
appeal of this technology goes far beyond
broadcasting, the company also provides
many of the broadcast technology
components that drive the Group’s
electronic subsystems. The London-based
company won the Queen’s Award for
Enterprise: International Trade in 2007 . 
Link has been an active member of 
the Group since 2005 and customers
include BBC Regions, Sky News and many
broadcasters and professional TV
equipment hire companies around 
the world.

Operating Performance Overview
EVRAZ groups its operations into four 
principal operating segments: Steel, 
Mining, Vanadium and Other. Within 
each of these operating segments 
there are dedicated management 
teams which focus on particular 
geographies and/or product lines. 
The steel operating segment represents the 
core of EVRAZ’s business with operations 
spread over 4 continents. The Company is a 
prominent participant in multiple steel product 
markets with a specialised focus on the 
infrastructure sector. In 2012, consolidated 
output of crude steel totalled 15.9 million 
tonnes, a 5% decrease compared to 2011, 
while gross production of steel products fell by 
4% to 15.7 million tonnes. These decreases in 
steel output were the result of a variety of both 
internal and macroeconomic factors.
The most important of these internal factors 
was the large scale modernisation programme 
implemented at the Company’s Russian 
assets, which included an upgrade of the rail 
mills at EVRAZ NTMK and EVRAZ ZSMK, an 
overhaul of the electric arc furnace at EVRAZ 
ZSMK and the implementation of PCI projects 
at both EVRAZ NTMK and EVRAZ ZSMK. The 
completion of this ambitious investment 
programme will allow EVRAZ to benefit from 
superior prices, an increased volume of high 
value added products in the product mix  
and improved efficiency and safeguard the 
competiveness of the Company’s long run  
cost position. 
EVRAZ’s North American steelmaking facilities 
enjoyed a healthy demand for all product 
groups in 2012, which led to a strong 
performance, particularly in tubular and long 
products. Meanwhile, EVRAZ’s European 
operations suffered from temporary 
suspensions and the Company’s South  
African operations were adversely impacted by 
labour strikes and the subdued macro outlook 
in the region. EVRAZ mining operations cover a 
substantial portion of Company’s consumption 
of iron ore and coking coal, with major mining 
facilities located in Russia, Ukraine and South 
Africa. In 2012 EVRAZ’s self-coverage in iron 
ore was almost 100% and 73% (excluding 
Raspadskaya) in coking coal. Following the 
completion of acquisition of Raspadskaya, the 
Company’s self-coverage in coking coal 
increased to 142% (based on 2012 results).
In 2012, EVRAZ’s total iron ore products’ 
output decreased by 2% to 20.8 million 
tonnes, predominately due to a lower output  
of saleable concentrate in Russia, where 
processing of third party raw iron ore was 
terminated due to unfavourable economic 
conditions, and the suspension of  
Evrazruda’s Irba mine. The Company’s 
Ukrainian iron ore operations demonstrated  
a strong performance in 2012, recording a  
7% growth in output of lump iron ore  
following improvements to the mine’s 
processing facilities. Raw coking coal 
production at Yuzhkuzbassugol increased by 
35% to 8.5 million tonnes in 2012 and 
Raspadskaya also demonstrated strong 
growth with production increasing by 12% to 
7.0 million tonnes (on 100% basis). 
The agreement on acquisition of a controlling 
interest in Raspadskaya was a significant 
milestone for EVRAZ’s coal mining business in 
2012, and following completion of the 
transaction in January 2013 the effective 
interest of EVRAZ increased to 82%. The 
Raspadskaya’s coal mining business 
complements the Company’s existing coal 
operations, enhances EVRAZ’s self-coverge in 
raw materials for steelmaking and progresses 
the Company’s strategy of growing its mining 
presence. 
EVRAZ’s vanadium business experienced a 
mixed 2012, with labour issues in South Africa 
and shortages of third party feedstock in the 
United States negatively affecting operations, 
while Russian operations ran at full utilisation 
rates to meet demand. Total production of 
vanadium slag increased by 2% and exceeded 
21,000 tonnes in 2012, while total 
ferrovanadium produced at EVRAZ’s own 
facilities reached 7,259 tonnes.
Operational highlights at EVRAZ’s other 
businesses during 2012 included the 
expansion of cargo handling capacity at EVRAZ 
NMTP (Nakhodka Trade Sea Port) in the Far 
East of Russia, which is the main route for 
exports of EVRAZ’s steel products and coking 
coal to Asian markets. In 2012 the trading  
and distribution arms of EVRAZ focused on 
improvements to the customer experience 
across the whole product range and in all  
key local markets. A further highlight during 
the year was the sale of EvrazTrans as part of 
the continued effort by EVRAZ’s management 
to streamline the business and optimise 
capital allocation. 
In November 2012, following the careful review 
of the Company’s strategic priorities the Board 
decided to consider options with respect to 
EVRAZ Highveld and EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel.  
As of 31 December 2012, these subsidiaries 
were classified as assets held for sale. In 
March 2013 the Company announced the 
execution of a non-binding term sheet in 
respect of the sale of its 85% stake in EVRAZ 
Highveld to a consortium of South African 
investors for an indicative cash consideration 
of approximately US$320 million. The 
consolidated operating results of EVRAZ for 
2012 include 454,000 tonnes of crude steel 
and 638,000 tonnes of steel products 
produced by EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel. In addition 
to this, in 2012 EVRAZ Highveld’s output 
totalled 572,000 tonnes of crude steel and 
461,000 tonnes of steel products.

Group highlights
Advancing our 
strategic plans 
We achieved a good set of results and hit our financial targets 
while continuing to deliver our strategic priorities.
Notes:
1. Return on tangible equity (“RoTE”) is adjusted profit after tax from ongoing operations and the International division (discontinued operations) divided by the 
Group’s average tangible shareholders’ equity. Profit after tax is adjusted to exclude the Run-off segment, restructuring and other one-off costs and gain on disposal 
of subsidiaries, and is stated after charging tax (using the UK standard tax rate of 21.5%; 2013: 23.25%). For 2012, pro forma RoTE is based on the return on 
tangible equity, but assumes that the capital actions taken by the Group prior to the initial public offering (£1 billion dividend payment and £500 million long-term 
subordinated debt issue) occurred on 1 January 2012.
2. Ongoing operations include the Group’s ongoing divisions: Motor, Home, Rescue and other personal lines, and Commercial. It excludes the International division 
which is classified as discontinued operations, the Run-off segment and restructuring and other one-off costs.
3. Combined operating ratio is the sum of the loss, commission and expense ratios. The ratio is a measure of the amount of claims costs, commission and expenses 
compared to net earned premium generated.
4. Operating expenses and claims handling expenses from ongoing operations and International. It excludes the Run-off segment and restructuring and other  
one-off costs.
5. For 2014 and 2013, continuing operations includes all activities other than International.

Strategic report
Notes:
1. The Board has resolved this year to pay an interim dividend in lieu of a final dividend, see page 45, and references in this document to ‘final dividend’ for 2014 
are to be construed as references to this interim dividend. In this document the second special dividend is referred to separately from the final dividend. This 
enables more appropriate comparison of the 2013 final dividend. Both the second special interim dividend and the final dividend will be paid together as one 
payment. For 2012, pro forma full-year dividend is based on the final dividend of 8.0 pence per share, representing two-thirds of the full-year payout ratio.
2. Cash sale proceeds received in Euros have been converted to Pound Sterling using the rate within the designated foreign currency hedge contract.
3. Adjusted earnings per share – diluted, includes ongoing operations and the International division (discontinued operations) and excludes the Run-off segment, 
restructuring and other one-off costs, and the gain on disposal of subsidiaries (using UK standard tax rate of 21.5%; 2013: 23.25%).
4. For 2014 and 2013, basic earnings per share is presented for continuing operations and excludes discontinued operations. 2012 is for total Group.

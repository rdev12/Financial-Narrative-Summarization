Why do companies 
choose WANdisco?
Our patented active-active 
replication technology provides 
a range of performance and 
consistency benefits.
1. Continuous availability
Removes the bottleneck of a single active 
store of essential data across data centres, 
and enables local speed read/write at any 
global location without downtime or data 
loss – even during upgrades and maintenance.
2. 100% utilisation
Eliminates read-only backup servers 
by making all servers fully readable 
and writeable, to take full advantage 
of the hardware at each location.

3. Cluster zoning
Delegates the most resource-intensive 
data load and applications to high-spec 
servers while running less critical batch 
applications on commodity servers. 
Eliminates the need for costly hardware.
4. Multi-data centre ingest
Ingests data at any number of locations 
simultaneously, automatically replicates 
where chosen and enables analysis from 
anywhere with no single point of failure. 
5. Selective replication
Replicates only the specific data 
required or permitted by regulations. 
Across several locations, we have architects, engineers and technologists who are among 
the best in the industry.

rowth”
I am delighted to report that
Egg has achieved substantial
growth once again in 2002 and
has made important steps in
developing an international
business of scale. Our progress
has been rapid and today, we
are ranked as the world’s
largest pure online bank
(Nielsen Net Ratings). This is 
a responsible position but also
further strengthens our belief
that customers are demanding 
a better relationship with 
their money.
In the UK we acquired 610,000 
net new customers during the
year, principally through our 
credit card business, which has
now captured over 5% of total
balances in the UK card market.
The UK business has
demonstrated it is sustainably
profitable, successfully growing
customer numbers and revenues
each quarter in a challenging 
and increasingly competitive
marketplace, whilst at the same
time reducing both unit operating
costs and marketing acquisition
costs. Credit quality remains 
strong and benchmarks continue
to show Egg’s card portfolio
significantly outperforming the 
rest of the industry in terms of
lower arrears rates.
During the year we refreshed
the Egg branding which has
proved to be a very positive move,
resulting in achieving increased
momentum to our customer
acquisition campaign in the
second quarter. There were three
key reasons behind our decision
to refresh. Firstly, to have a design
that was capable of being used
globally. Secondly to position Egg
as firmly on the consumers’ side 
and thirdly, to communicate our
desire to make things simple and
straightforward for customers. 
We sought to do all of this 
without losing the edge that Egg
advertising has become known 
for and while still using the
intelligent humour that customers 
found engaging.
We made significant
developments in innovation during
the year, specifically in the area of
helping our customers understand
and manage their money more
effectively. We launched our
aggregation service, Egg Money
Manager, which to many of our
customers has already established
itself as an essential tool for
handling their financial affairs. We
continue to introduce enhanced
functionality to this service.

offer a choice
We offer a wider range of services Egg aims to offer a 
portfolio of leading banking and investment products, 
supported by state of the art technology.

In France, we launched
successfully in November 2002,
and we are satisfied with our
achievements to date. We are
particularly pleased that brand
awareness and consideration,
which were the key focus for us in
this launch phase, have reached
55% and 23% respectively, both
metrics above their UK equivalents
two months after launch. We have
had 69,000 people apply for our
first product, la Carte Egg, in the
first two months. Of these 44,000
have been accepted, subject to
completing all verification
requirements, and we expect
27,000 of these to become
customers following that process.
This gives us a total Egg customer
base in France of approximately
90,000, following the selective
migration of customers from the
acquired Zebank portfolio. 
We are pleased with the
quality of customers we have
attracted to date; early findings
from our research shows
customers using their card 
an average of 15 times per 
month, and that la Carte Egg
is establishing itself as 
“front of wallet”. 
Outlook
We remain committed to delivering
long-term value to shareholders
through building an international
business of scale and leading the
industry for innovation in financial
services to the ultimate benefit of
our customers.
In 2003, Egg UK remains
committed to its key strategic
goals of maximising value from 
our unsecured lending business 
in what we believe could be
challenging market conditions. 
We take our responsibility as a
lender seriously and believe we
offer customers simple, flexible,
good-value products to help them
manage their finances. In addition,
we will seek to implement
innovations, particularly in
technology, to deliver the best
possible service to, and
relationship with, our customers.
We are also looking to revamp 
our investments business to
address the increased challenge
facing consumers with regard to
saving for their futures. 
In France, we intend to
enhance and extend our product
range in line with developing a
profitable business of scale in this
market. Our next major product, to
be launched next month, will be a
new loan account. We are excited 
about the opportunity to continue 
to revolutionise the credit market in
France, building on la Carte Egg,
and are determined to help
customers to understand how to
manage their borrowing more
productively and to get better value
than is currently available from 
our competitors.
We remain committed to
developing Egg as a global
business and have been
researching different territories
throughout 2002. Specifically, we
have been exploring potential
entry strategies for the US market
and have embarked on some
qualitative and quantitative
consumer research in Q1 2003 
to establish the scale of the
opportunity available.
Finally, I would like to thank 
all Egg People for their continued
hard work, good humour and
dedication during what has 
been another challenging and
productive year.

move with
the times
We are continually updating our technology T echnology has to be
relevant – not technology for technology’s sake. But we remain firm in
our view that technology can help people understand and manage their
money better. This is why we have introduced services such as Egg
Money Manager this year – a secure one page personal balance sheet
which can show you all your financial holdings. 16 Egg plc Annual Report 2002 06
be distinctive
17 Egg plc Annual Report 2002
Strong, distinctive and effective marketing Egg was launched to provide
customers a different, and better, way of managing and understanding 
their money. We try to communicate with customers in an engaging and
distinctive way; using simple, clear language. In the same way that we strive
to offer customers a different – better – relationship with their bank. 07
be passionate
A well managed business Ambitious companies require strong
leadership, particularly at Board and senior management levels. 
Of equal importance to us, however, is to ensure that all Egg people 
are empowered, motivated and rewarded – making Egg a company 
for whom they want to work.

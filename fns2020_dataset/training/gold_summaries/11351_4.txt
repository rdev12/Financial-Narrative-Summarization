Northumbrian Water Group plc
NWG owns a number of companies which, together 
with NWG, form the Group. The largest of these 
companies, Northumbrian Water Limited (NWL), is one 
of the ten regulated water and sewerage businesses  
in England and Wales. The emphasis given to NWL 
throughout this report, reflects its importance to the 
overall performance of the Group. 
Northumbrian Water Limited
NWL operates in the north east of England, where it 
trades as Northumbrian Water, and in the south east  
of England, where it trades as Essex & Suffolk Water.

NWL is licensed to provide these services and currently 
supplies over 1,250 megalitres of water per day. This 
water is drawn from reservoirs, where it is collected and 
stored, rivers and groundwater sources. It is treated at 
our works before it is delivered by a network of pipes to 
homes and businesses. 
In the north east of England, where NWL also provides 
sewerage services, waste water is then collected from 
these properties via the sewerage network and treated 
at our works before it is returned to the environment as 
either clean water or sludge which can be recycled as 
fertiliser or used to generate energy.
Our water and sewerage services in the north east cost 
an average householder 92 pence per day and in Essex 
and Suffolk area, 66 pence for a water only service.
The Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat), as the 
economic regulator, sets price limits for companies in 
England and Wales every five years. 2010/11 was the 
first year in the current five year investment plan. This 
regulation is performance based and companies are 
measured in terms of efficiencies related to operating 
costs, capital programmes and financing as well as  
their general operations. The regulated revenue of the 
company is set by reference to the rate of inflation, 
measured by the Retail Price Index (RPI), as well as an 
adjustment factor referred to as ‘k’. The profile of ‘k’  
for the current five year period is shown below:
2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15

NWL has a long term agreement with RWE npower  
for it to operate and sell the energy from NWL ’s 
hydroelectric power station at Kielder Water, which  
is the largest in England.

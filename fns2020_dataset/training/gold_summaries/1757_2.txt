statutory basis
- Strong cash performance
- Record order book at £46 billion
- Good performance from North America with underlying organic sales growth of 11%
- Customer Solutions & Support again delivered a robust performance
- Good progress towards stabilising the UK MoD Programmes business
- Turnaround in International Partnerships, driven by second half performance in MBDA and AMS and exit from Astrium
- Airbus results maintained in difficult market
- Avionics business impacted by reduced throughput and rationalisation activity
Good sustained underlying growth is anticipated across the company’s operations in North America and in International Partnerships
with some recovery in the Avionics business. The performance of the Programmes business is expected to continue to be restrained
with some UK MoD production programmes still in early phases of maturity. Margins in Customer Solutions & Support are likely to
continue to trend downwards. Overall, underlying performance of the company’s defence businesses in 2004 is expected to be
slightly ahead of 2003.
Airbus plans a volume of activity for 2004 similar to 2003, with a slightly lower value mix of deliveries.

The Group has continued to invest in research and development for new 
products together with improvements to existing products as well as 
testing and compliance protocols. 
Costs have been carefully monitored with increases to support the 
growth in revenues. The Group has reduced its interest bearing debt by 
£0.34 million leading to a reduction in finance costs. This reduction in 
debt was limited due to a substantial increase in trade toward the end of 
the last quarter resulting in higher working capital balances reported at 
the end of the year , including amounts payable on invoice discounting.
Working with our distributors, we continue to monitor and have an 
influence on legislation in certain parts of the world and we are making 
considerable efforts to maximise awareness of d

 products.
These reported figures reflect the impact of the considerable work  
and investment being made as well as the achievements to date in 
expanding sales and markets for d

and products.
Trading results
I am pleased to report Group revenues increased by 31% during the year 
from £5.36 million to £7 .04 million. Group gross profit margins increased 
from 44% to 55%. These factors resulted in a 63% increase in the 
contribution from gross profit from £2.37 million in 2008 to £3.88 million  
in 2009.
The Group made an operating profit of £0.83 million compared to an 
operating loss of £0. 15 million in 2008, resulting in the Group’s maiden 
profit before tax of £0.64 million compared to a loss before tax of £0.40 
million in 2008. 
Development costs of £0.23 million were capitalised in 2009. A £0.01 
million research and development tax credit was received during  
the year.

 division made a profit before 
taxation of £0.98 million and has recognised further deferred tax credit 
resulting in a carried forward deferred tax asset of £0.99 million at the  
end of the year . Losses within the non-degradable division reduced to  
£0. 16 million in 2009 compared to a loss of £0.47 million in 2008.
The Group primary selling currency is the US Dollar . The Group hedges 
where possible by purchasing in US dollars and has banking facilities  
in place in order to secure rates going forward. As at 31 December 2009 
the Group had a net balance of US Dollar assets totalling $1.29 million. 
 
Chief Executive’ s Review 11
Symphony Environmental 
Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
As a result of this financial performance, the Group reports a profit  
for the year of £0.92 million with basic earnings per share increasing  
to 0.80 pence (2008: 0.35 pence) 
Cashflow
The Group has recorded an improvement in cash-flow of £1.21 million 
from 2008 by generating £0.57 million from operations (2008: £0.64 
million loss). £0.04 million was invested in plant and equipment together 
with £0.23 million in product development which has been capitalised. 
Further research and development spend is included within expenses 
and was not capitalised as it does not meet the appropriate accounting 
criteria.
Debt was reduced by £0.34 million in 2009. The amount payable on the 
invoice discounting facility increased from £0. 16 million in 2008 to £0.32 
million in 2009. This was due to increased revenues in the last quarter  
of 2009 resulting in high levels of amounts receivable and hence 
financeable at the end of the year .
The Headstart loan has been repaid in accordance with the terms 
renegotiated in January 2009. At 31 December 2009 the balance of  
the loan was £40,000. This has been settled in full since the year end.
Invoice financing and banking facilities remain in place for 2010 which 
together with the current trade profile show adequate resources are 
available for the foreseeable future. 
Operations 
Total costs increased in 2009 due to the level of support required to 
service the growth in revenue and number of distributors.
Having developed a strong distributor base, the main function for the 
Group continues to be product support and development, marketing  
and brand-recognition. 
On 19 March 2010 the Group moved its head office within Borehamwood 
UK to premises more suited for the next five to ten years of operations.
Symphony Energy
The Group currently absorbs annual running costs of £0. 18 million. The  
RµPERT project is in its second year out of three and the Group is actively 
pursuing commercial outlets for the elements within the project. 
Outlook
As stated above, the Group has moved its global headquarters to a 
modern facility that is more than twice the size of the Group’s original 
premises as a result of the growth in activities. Further investments will 
be made in technical support services, research and development, and 
also marketing activities. These investments, which are essential to a 
growing business of our size, will be undertaken carefully so as not to 
materially undermine short term expectations.
The Symphony distributor network has a busy year ahead with 
exhibitions, product development and other related projects on a global 
basis. So far in 2010, d

 representatives have participated in six major 
events. In the coming months, we will be at The Master Investor Show, 
London; Chinaplas 2010 Plast, China; exhibitions in Central America and 
Latin America, and towards the end of the year at one of the world’s 
largest plastic events in Germany; the K T rade Fair . Product launches 
and other events are planned for the UK and other markets in the coming 
months. Details of these events will be communicated through our 
normal commercial channels.
The current year has started well and in line with management’s 
expectations. The Board is confident that further expansion will be  
achieved during this year and that long term debt will continue to reduce.

“ Rethink has made good progress in 2013, both 
financially and operationally. During the year 
the Group added several prestigious clients 
to its already impressive roster and achieved 
record levels of contractor numbers and 
permanent recruitment placements. These 
achievements led to an increase in revenues, 
profits and cash for the Group. The refreshed 
Group strategy, although still in its early 
stage of implementation, is being executed 
successfully and delivering results. We look 
forward to 2014 with increasing confidence.

 5 ASHMORE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
The Group results for the year ended 
30 June 2008 are satisfactory from a
number of perspectives. Firstly in
absolute financial terms they
demonstrate the further progress made
against the results of prior periods and
our own forecasts. Secondly we have
continued to make progress from an
operational point of view with fund
launches, further product innovation 
and the implementation of significant
infrastructural initiatives aimed at
developing an even more robust
platform for the Group’s continued
development. Finally , we have
undertaken further steps to begin to
develop a network of local asset
management operations in some of the
world’s key emerging markets. This has
all taken place in global financial market
conditions judged by many
commentators to be as difficult as any
they can remember which have both
made the execution of an active style of
investment management a greater
challenge and generally reduced
investor appetite for risk. I will expand
upon these in my report and then
outline the strategic rationale and some
of the emerging market dynamics that
we believe position the Group well for
future success.
Assets under Management
(“AuM”) and financial
performance
At the end of the previous financial year ,
30 June 2007, AuM stood at US$31.6
billion. Through net subscriptions of
US$3.0 billion and investment
performance of US$2.9 billion we have
reached a closing level for AuM at 
30 June 2008 of US$37.5 billion.
As we forecast the AuM growth has been
strongest in our local currency theme
where overall levels of AuM were 70%
higher (at US$8.5 billion at the end of
the period) than a year earlier , followed
by special situations where AuM have
grown by 62% to US$5.5 billion over the
period. The AuM growth within these
two themes is in line with our view of the
significant future opportunity they
present. Our dollar debt theme has
seen gross subscriptions exactly
matched by redemptions so growth in
this theme arises from investment
performance of US$1.5 billion, and,
as anticipated and targeted several of
the redemptions in this theme have
been prompted by reallocation into local
currency mandates where there are
opportunities for higher returns.
The equity theme has completed a
difficult year in line with global equity
markets and whilst the investment
performance has been flat, there have
been redemptions as investors have
allocated away from equities resulting in
a US$1.2 billion reduction in AuM.
The overall growth in AuM has driven
the Group’s 44% increase in net
management fee income to 
£182.0 million in the year to 30 June
2008 (year ended 30 June 2007: £126.4
million). The Group remains focused on
the delivery of a high proportion of its

overall revenue from high margin
management fees. Performance fee
income has also increased significantly
to £44.7 million, an increase of 119%
from £20.4 million in the previous year
which has been delivered across all our
investment themes.
These two principle sources of revenue
together with other income result in
strong growth in our overall net revenue
by 50% to £240.0 million (year ended
30 June 2007: £159.8 million).
After costs of £58.8 million (year ended
30 June 2007: £38.1 million) and
interest income of £15.0 million (year
ended 30 June 2007: £9.7 million) this
results in a profit before tax of £196.2
million, an increase of 49% in the year
(year ended 30 June 2007: £131.4
million). Basic earnings per share for
the year was 21.0p (2007: 13.7p), a
53% increase in the year .
Operational delivery
From an operational perspective in the
area of fund launches and product
innovation the year began with the
launch of our fourth global special
situations fund (“GSSF4”) which closed
with commitments totalling US$1.4
billion. Thereafter , developments in
emerging markets corporate debt,
following significant repricing in these
markets, provided Ashmore with the
opportunity to launch a dedicated
corporate high yield fund and establish
it as a new investment theme in October
2007 offering enhanced levels of return
with a low correlation to the dollar debt
theme. We expect this to grow over time
as the credit markets stabilise.
In December 2007 we completed the
launch of a permanent capital vehicle
Ashmore Global Opportunities Limited
through which we raised €500 million via
a listing on the London Stock Exchange.
This fund was established to focus on
the special situations theme enabling a
new client base to invest in this theme
via a listed vehicle with daily liquidity
and pricing. It contributed US$250
million of the GSSF4 commitments and
will be provided allocations in future
special situations funds.
In January 2008 we launched a
dedicated Brazilian local currency fund
domiciled in Guernsey managed by our
newly established fund management
subsidiary in Sao Paulo. This was
followed in April by the launch of a
Brazilian onshore local currency fund
targeting domestic institutional investors
which, in line with the strategy

previously outlined, the Group seeded
in the amount of BRL49.3 million 
(£15.1 million).
Investment activity within the special
situations theme had resulted in GSSF4
being 70% drawn down at 30 June
2008 and it has since become fully
drawn. Given the significant ongoing
investment opportunities within this
theme, we announced in June 2008 the
beginning of marketing the next special
situations fund GSSF5 which we expect
to close in the new financial year .
The year has also been a busy one in
the area of infrastructure projects, the
implementation of a new fund
accounting system, the migration of
fund administration services for the
Group’s global public funds to a single
service provider and in May 2008 the
relocation of the entire London based
staff to a new office. In all cases these
projects were executed following
months of planning by multi-disciplinary
teams and are aimed at providing the
Group with development, continuity and
expansion to enable us to execute our
strategic plans.
Strategic positioning
The Group’s strategy remains
consistent; to deliver long term
investment outperformance; generate
and diversify net management fee
income through the attraction of net
subscriptions across an increasing
variety of investment themes; and
develop the Ashmore brand and
business. In evaluating our progress
toward the achievement of our strategic
goals and evaluating the future
opportunity available we consider all of
these across three phases of
development – establishment,
diversification and emerging market
capital mobilisation.
The first of these phases is largely
completed: establishing the emerging
market fixed income asset class;
educating the investor base; refining the

investment processes and creating the
performance track record to attract the
investment of developed world capital
into the emerging markets.
The second phase continues to apply
to the management of developed world
capital into emerging markets as we
grow our AuM diversifying by
investment themes, product structures,
investor type, investor geography and
distribution route. This is an ongoing
process where we have a great deal
more to do in all areas and which offers
much potential for growth.
The third phase of our strategy
diversifies the origin of funds that we
manage looking toward the capital pools
that we consider will grow the most and
we believe can be mobilised within the
emerging markets themselves. In this
phase we first use the existing Ashmore
central investment processes and funds
to manage capital from the largest
emerging world sources of capital cross
border into other emerging markets.
Initially this comes from central banks,
governments/reserve managers and
sovereign wealth funds and gradually
expand to other domestic institutions.
Thereafter we expect to progressively
establish local asset management
operations in a number of the world’s
key emerging economies using our
expertise, investment processes and
track record to manage domestic
capital within these markets. This will
enable us to participate in the significant
long term growth opportunity available
in these markets both by investing funds
from offshore but also developing
onshore investment management by
Ashmore and its subsidiaries.
Investor allocations to emerging
markets
Whilst the first phase – establishment –
is largely complete, there is significant
future potential for strong growth in the
second - diversification - phase.
One of the major driving forces of
future growth is the macro one, based
on the low allocations that investors
from the developed world have so far
made to emerging markets, and how
these will change in the future as those
markets outgrow the developed world.
We believe that an average institutional
investor may currently have an
emerging market allocation across
investment themes anywhere in the
broad range of five to fifteen percent
whilst a progressive investor may have
an allocation at double these levels.
This compares with the emerging
markets contribution to the global
economy at between fifteen and 
twenty-five percent when measured by
either GDP , equity or bond market
capitalisation levels. Over the next ten
years or so we would expect the
emerging market contribution to
increase to over 50% of the overall
global economy by all these measures
so the opportunity for current and 
future allocations to grow dramatically 
is very clear . We are well positioned to
benefit from this allocation shift as we
have a long history of total focus on
emerging markets across all available
asset classes and a commitment to
broaden our capability in these and
new asset classes.
Another driver for growth in this second
– diversification - phase is the
development of the local currency
One of the major driving forces of future growth is
the macro one, based on the low allocations that
investors from the developed world have so far
made to emerging markets, and how these will
change in the future as those markets outgrow the
developed world.
Over the next ten years or
so we would expect the
emerging market
contribution to increase to
over 50% of the overall
global economy by all these
measures so the
opportunity for current and
future allocations to grow
dramatically is very clear .

markets, and this is also one of the
principal areas we see having a
significant impact upon the pace with
which emerging markets capital
mobilisation – our third phase - is
progressing.
Local currency debt and local
asset management operations
Ashmore’s local currency theme AuM
are undergoing the strongest absolute
growth of any of our themes. We
believe that this is set to continue and
should establish it as our largest theme
by volume within three years. In fact, we
continue to encourage our dollar debt
investors to diversify with us into this
theme. The underlying local currency
debt markets are believed to total over
US$6 trillion at the end of 2007 –
already five times the size of the
external debt market in which
Ashmore’s dollar debt theme invests. As
local currency markets mature and their
liquidity and duration measures
increase we expect to see increased
international investment into these
markets coming from both developed
world investors and intra-emerging
market flows. These latter flows typically
form the first part of our mobilisation 
of emerging markets capital phase.
As highlighted above, the earliest
movers in this phase are the largest
sources of capital from central banks,
reserve managers and sovereign wealth
funds. Ashmore is already managing
local currency funds for a number of
such organisations and we see further
growth in the number and scale of
these mandates in the future. Thereafter
we would expect this trend to develop
to include the larger institutions and
pension funds in these economies.
In order to capitalise on this trend,
we believe that local asset management
operations on the ground in a number of
key emerging markets represent the
other key to participating in the growth
and development of the local currency
and other markets.
Our operations now include subsidiaries
in Turkey and India that are active in the
local mid-market private equity markets.
During this year we have established a
subsidiary operation in Brazil managing
offshore and onshore local currency
funds. Immediately after the financial
year ended in July we received final
stage approval in Turkey from the
Capital Markets Board to establish and
operate a regulated portfolio
management business which began
operations on 1 August 2008. Whilst 
the financial impact of these operations
was not material in context of the 
overall Group result for the year ended
30 June 2008, we believe going 
forward that the contribution from the
local asset management operations 
that the Group establishes will gradually
and progressively contribute
meaningfully to the Group’s results 
and valuation.
Special situations: Opportunities
and performance fees
Ashmore’s team were investing in the
special situations asset class, in both
distressed debt and private equity
forms, even before the Group’s first fund
was established in 1992, and the
investment into this theme from all
funds, where the investment mandate
allows, has continued ever since.
Our operations now include
subsidiaries in Turkey and
India in the local mid-market
private equity markets and
in Brazil, managing offshore
and onshore local currency
funds. 10 ASHMORE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
This long history , resultant specialist
transaction experience and network of
relationships throughout the emerging
markets are keys to our strength in the
area. As I have described above, the
financial year ended 30 June 2008 saw
the closing, drawing down and
deployment of our fourth global special
situations fund (GSSF4) and the launch
of fundraising for our fifth global fund
(GSSF5). The investment opportunity
presented for this asset class going
forward is very strong with a significant
pipeline of attractive potential
transactions, and particularly following
the broad reduction of easy credit in 
the market.
Our first global special situations fund
(GSSF) matured after the financial year
ended in July five years after its closing
in July 2003, and the mechanics of the
fund wind up are underway with first
stage payments made to fund
shareholders. As a result of strong
investment returns the fund has
generated a performance fee of
between £15.6 million and £21.0 million
which will be recognised in the 
financial year ended 30 June 2009,
the final level being determined by the
finalisation of the few remaining asset
realisations.
Our people and culture
The operational highlights described in
this report share many common
features. Most striking amongst these is
the role of the team at Ashmore, spread
broadly throughout the organisation,
in making the business a success.
At 30 June 2008 the Group’s headcount
stood at 93, an increase of 24 or 35%
on the figure a year earlier , with
additions across the Group’s global
functions in London, and in particular
within local asset management
operations. The Group places a
tremendous focus on the process of
recruiting like minded individuals from
different backgrounds with a common
desire to specialise in their field within
the emerging markets. This takes time
but is critical to our success. I should
like to add my own thanks to those
expressed in the Chairman’s report for
the dedication and commitment that all
those already in the Ashmore team have
made into making the year and the
business a success.
Now we move onto next year and as the
Group grows we continue to work hard
in ensuring that this growth occurs in a
controlled manner . Part of this is
achieved through the recruitment of a
broad team of varying talents and the

systems aimed at further strengthening
our processes and controls. This is

I believe that we retain and develop the
Ashmore culture and work ethos which
will enable us to execute on and benefit
from the significant strategic
opportunities that lie ahead. We have
much to do, and execution will always
be the key , but we continue to look
forward to the challenges ahead.
August 2008 annual performance
fees
Unaudited annual performance fees for
the funds with annual performance years
ended 31 August 2008 (including EMLIP
and LCD) were £31.0 million (August
2007: £17.6 million) which will be
recognised in the financial year ended
30 June 2009 in addition to the GSSF fee
detailed above.
Outlook statement
The world has not been the most
comfortable place this year . The general
market outlook continues to be difficult,
deleveraging has been significant and
continues and many investors are doing
what they often do in times of stress....
as little as possible, as a precursor to
working out where to allocate their
capital as things settle down.
Against this market backdrop, since the
year end the Group has experienced
slightly lower subscription activity and
some redemptions which, coupled with
negative market performance, has
resulted in a modest reduction in AuM.
Given the margin profile of these assets,
we remain confident that the revenue
impact of this has been offset by the
increased levels of fees elsewhere
including those performance fees
already recorded, demonstrating the
Group’s robust business model.
It is these dynamics which provide us
with both challenges and our major
opportunity . We have more value and
transactional scope available to us to
invest for strong medium term returns
over the next 12-24 months than at any
time over the previous 5 years. Our task
is to continue persuading investors to
allocate us capital and allow us to
execute strategies to capture that value
particularly from local currency , in our
special situations theme (in both
distressed debt and private equity) and
in corporate high yield as well as in our
local asset management businesses.

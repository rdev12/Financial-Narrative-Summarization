Chairman’s Statement
This is our fifth year as an AIM-listed company and it is with great pleasure that I announce
another record year of turnover and profits for our company. This year has seen strong progress 
in a number of areas, the most notable of which are:
 Significant evolution of our product offering in the direction of more healthy, premium and
branded. 
 Continuing strong cash generation and improving operational efficiency.
 Strengthening of our senior management team with a number of key appointments.
 The post-year end acquisition of Dormen Foods.
Results
During the year to June 2007 Glisten plc achieved turnover up 5% to £58.6m (2006: £55.6m),
EBITDA before exceptional costs up 15% to £8.4m (2006: £7.3m) and operating profits up 18%
to £6.6m (2006: £5.6m). Profit before tax, amortisation and exceptional items increased by 18%
to £5.65m (2006: £4.84m). 
Adjusted basic earnings increased by 8% to 30.5p (2006: 28.3p) and diluted earnings per share
increased by 10% to 29.7p (2006: 27.0p). 
Dividend
The Board is pleased to recommend the payment of a final dividend for the year ended June 2007
of 1.1 pence (2006: 1.0 pence) per ordinary share, making 2.1 pence (2006: 1.75 pence) for the
year, an increase of 20%. It is our intention to grow the dividend distribution sensibly going
forward. If approved, the final dividend will be paid on 9 November 2007 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 12 October 2007.
Management and Board
Our management style continues to place the emphasis on leadership and innovation within a
framework of robust cost and capital control. We encourage new ideas in all areas of our
operations, test them, evaluate and implement quickly where there are clear benefits. We promote
an incentive culture, thus rewarding success and encouraging those who deliver and challenge.
We aim to be a good neighbour in the areas of the country where our businesses are located,
helping to create a stable prosperous local economy in which our business can grow while
supporting sensible Corporate and Social Responsibility (CSR) and environmental initiatives.

Over the course of the year we have expanded the role of our remuneration committee to
encompass the appointment of Board members and senior staff within Glisten plc. We believe 
it is appropriate for a company of our size to bring the responsibility of the appointment and
remuneration committees under one umbrella.
It is with great pleasure that I welcome Angela Megson to our Board. Angela has a wealth of
experience in the food sector and joined us on 1 July 2007. Angela has been appointed with
immediate effect to our Remuneration and Appointment Committee and our Audit Committee.
Paul Simmonds and Robert Davies who were members respectively of these committees 
resigned at the same time. We believe these actions demonstrate good corporate governance 
for a business of our size and at this stage of its development. 
Shareholders
Our private shareholder base has increased in number by around 6% to 765 shareholders (2006:
720). It is the Board’s intention to communicate fully with all shareholders, current and future, and
in so doing continue to build awareness and understanding of Glisten plc.
Staff
We really value the contribution of our 616 people, including several new
employees who have joined us during the year and we wish to thank them
for their continuing hard work and enthusiasm. 
Outlook
We have another strong plan for the year ahead and we are
excited about the prospects for the business. The
current year has started in line with our expectations.
Within this, sales of ice cream inclusions have been
depressed due to the poor summer but above plan sales on
retail confectionery have compensated. Our acquisition of
Dormen Foods, new business starting later this half and our
brand plans which run throughout the remainder of the year give 
us real confidence for the year ahead.

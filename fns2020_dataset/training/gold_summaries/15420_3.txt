 20 TNS annual report and accounts 2003
While we have been working hard to achieve the considerable cost synergies presented
by this merger, this move was made primarily for the growth opportunities it would
bring to the group. As you will read elsewhere in this report, we are already starting to
realise these opportunities.
2003 results
The results of NFO Worldgroup, Inc. (NFO) were consolidated from 10 July 2003, the
date the acquisition was completed.
Turnover
During 2003, the enlarged group’s reported turnover including joint ventures increased
by 30.1 per cent to £805.2 million (2002 £618.9 million). Acquisitions contributed
growth of 26.6 per cent, substantially all of which came from NFO (£162 million).
Turnover excluding joint ventures was £789.5 million (2002 £603.2 million).  
With a strengthened performance in the second half, underlying growth in the original
TNS business for the full year, excluding the effect of currency translation, acquisitions
and discontinued operations, was 1.7 per cent. Currency had a positive impact of 
1.8 per cent, which was partially offset by the negative impact of 1.0 per cent from
discontinued operations. 
Operating profit and margin 
For the enlarged group, operating profit including joint ventures and operating
synergies, before goodwill charges and integration costs, grew by 35.1 per cent to 
£80.8 million (2002 £59.8 million). Operating margin was 10.0 per cent compared 
with 9.7 per cent in 2002. 
In 2003, operating synergies arising from the integration of NFO were approximately
£2 million. Integration costs charged in 2003 to achieve these and additional ongoing
synergies were £9.0 million. Goodwill charges of £23.9 million (2002 £20.2 million)
comprise amortisation of £17.4 million (2002 £13.9 million) and impairments of 
£6.5 million (2002 £6.3 million). 
Group operating profit before joint ventures, after goodwill charges and integration
costs increased by 19.3 per cent to £45.7 million (2002 £38.3 million). 
Profit before tax
Profit before tax including operating synergies, before goodwill charges and integration
costs grew by 33.8 percent to £65.3 million (2002 £48.8 million). Profit before tax
increased by 13.3 per cent to £32.4 million (2002 £28.6 million).
Earnings and dividend per share
Based on a weighted average of 413.1 million shares, adjusted earnings per share before
goodwill charges and integration costs were 10.5p, an increase of 22.1 per cent 
(2002 8.6p). Basic earnings per share decreased by 6.1 per cent to 3.1p (2002 3.3p). 
The board is recommending a final dividend of 2.05p (2002 1.7p), giving a 15.4 per cent
increase in total dividend for the year of 3.0p (2002 2.6p). 
Chairman’s statement
2003 was a landmark year in the development of TNS, when we
significantly strengthened the group’s competitive positioning 
by combining our custom operations with those of NFO, the
business we acquired in July.

Strengthening the board
As part of the integration of NFO into the TNS group we restructured our senior
management, to ensure that we bring an appropriate level of management focus to our
expanded activities. At board level, we created the new position of Chief Operating
Officer. David Lowden, who has made a significant contribution to the successful
development of the group since he joined us as Finance Director in 1999, took on that
role in October 2003. He has direct responsibility for the group’s regional operations
and the regional heads in our new structure report to him. Our global sectors and
central support functions report directly to Chief Executive Mike Kirkham, who will
now devote more time to the strategic development of the enlarged group.
In July 2003, following completion of the acquisition, Bill Lipner, Chairman and CEO of
NFO, joined the board as Vice Chairman. He has played a valuable role in helping to
merge the two operations, particularly in the US. 
In November 2003, Sharon Studer was appointed to the board as a non-executive
director. Following the extension of our activities in the US, her experience in US
industry and public affairs is particularly relevant, as is her specialisation in the use of
technology, which is an important factor in the market information industry.
The board was further strengthened in January of this year, when Andy Boland joined
TNS as Finance Director. He brings to the group extensive and highly relevant
experience in the financial and treasury management of international media companies.
The contribution of our people
TNS is a fast-growing, dynamic company, which remains a people business. Thanks to
their skill and dedication, we have achieved much over the past few years in an
environment that offers many rewards and challenges. A lot of people worked very hard
to enable us to integrate TNS and NFO successfully and, at the same time, maintain the
momentum of our business.  The board is extremely appreciative of the efforts of
everyone within the group. 
Our task now is to ensure that our people are given every chance to build from the
platform for growth that 2003 has given us and to benefit from the very real
opportunities that are offered by being part of one of the world’s leading market
information companies.

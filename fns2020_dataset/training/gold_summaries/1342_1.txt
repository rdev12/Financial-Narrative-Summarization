Chief Executive
Overview
The Group closed its year to 30 April 2004
with a strong last quarter performance.
Operating profit before exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation for the quarter
was £12.0m compared with a loss of £0.8m
in the previous year and the profit before
exceptional items, goodwill amortisation
and tax for the quarter was £3.1m (2003 –
loss of £10.6m). There were particularly
encouraging figures for both Sunbelt, the
Group’s US division, where dollar revenues
grew by 13.8% and divisional operating
profits increased from $3.0m to $20.2m
(£1.8m to £11.0m in sterling terms) and 
for A-Plant whose divisional operating profit
was £1.5m compared with a loss of £2.4m
in the previous year.
For the full year to 30 April 2004, 
Group profits before exceptional items,
goodwill amortisation and tax were £7.6m
(2003 – loss of £1.8m). At constant
exchange rates profits would have been
33.5% higher at £10.1m. Turnover before
exceptional items, which declined by 1.6%
at constant exchange rates, was further
reduced at actual exchange rates by the
weakness of the dollar to £500.3m 
(2003 – £539.5m), a 7.3% decline.
The Group, which started the year in
default with its bankers, ended with the
achievement of financial stability through
the closing of our ten year bond issue in
April and the extension of our facilities with

Review of trading
Sunbelt
Sunbelt enjoyed a strong recovery in the
year with dollar revenues up $25.8m or
4.7% to $572.8m. Tight control of costs
maximised the benefits of operational
gearing so that $21.8m of the increased
revenue fell to the bottom line. As a result
divisional operating profit was up 42.3% 
to $73.3m (2003 – $51.5m). 
Although the weakness of the dollar 
transformed the 4.7% increase in dollar
revenues into a 4.6% decline in sterling,  06 Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2004
Chairman’s statement Chief Executive’s review 
3 5
divisional operating profits in sterling were
still up 28.9%. EBITDA margins improved
from 28.4% to 30.9% and operating
margins from 9.4% to 12.8%.
Utilisation levels, which in the first half had
trailed the previous year, averaged 65.1%
for the year as a whole, compared with
64.5% in the previous year, thanks to a
strong last quarter. Rental rates improved
with an estimated uplift of 4% for the year
as a whole. As the year progressed and the
US economy strengthened there was also
evidence of accelerating recovery in the
non-residential construction market,
Sunbelt’s principal customer base, and in
the equipment rental market itself. This
coupled with improved utilisation and
pricing produced year on year growth in
total quarterly revenues of -1.0%, +3.2%,
+4.0% and +13.8% over the four quarters
indicating that Sunbelt continued to take
market share.
Capital expenditure in the year was kept
under tight control, with fleet investment
being largely matched with disposals in a
market where improving second hand
pricing gave further evidence of economic
recovery. There were three new profit centre
openings in the year bringing the total
number to 200.
A-Plant
For A-Plant the past year was one of
transition as its business refocusing
programme was completed. Three non-core
activities were disposed of – Mast Climbing,
Big Air and its businesses in Ireland. In
addition the final stages of the move from
five geographic regions to three product
focused divisions, Main Plant, Specialist and
Tool Hire Shops, was put in place. These
changes, coupled with the network
rationalisation begun in 2003 under which
over 20 profit centres have been closed,
contributed to a 12.6% decline in turnover
to £155.9m. Same store turnover was
down 5.3% in the year. Costs excluding
exceptional items and amortisation were
reduced by 10.9% so that the £22.5m
turnover decline was restricted to a £3.9m
reduction in divisional operating profit 
to £4.0m.
A-Plant enjoyed a much improved fourth
quarter. Same store turnover was almost in
line with last year (down 0.9%) and
utilisation rates, which for the year as a
whole averaged 59.9% compared with
60.7% in the previous year, were 63.6% 
in the last quarter, significantly above the
comparable 2003 figure of 59.6%. 
As mentioned above, divisional operating
profit for the quarter was £1.5m (prior 
year loss £2.4m).

Ashtead Technology – Offshore and
Environmental
Ashtead Technology achieved an 8.0%
improvement in its divisional operating
profit in the year to 30 April 2004 despite
difficult trading in many of its markets.
Tight cost controls saw operating margins
increase to 23.9% from 20.8% in 2003.
The US businesses, both offshore and
environmental, saw growth in the year and
a new environmental profit centre was
opened in the San Francisco area. Since the
year end the first such business in the UK
has been opened in Hitchin and there are
further planned openings in Atlanta and
Chicago in the coming 12 months.
Interest and exceptional items
Interest costs before exceptional items
declined to £36.6m (2003 – £40.9m)
reflecting lower average borrowings and the
weakness of the US dollar. Exceptional items
totalled £31.5m and principally related to
costs incurred in connection with the
extension of the maturity of the Company’s
senior debt facilities.
Cash flow
The Group continued to generate strong
cash flow. Net free cash inflow (as defined)
for the year was £56.6m up 45.5% from
£38.9m in the previous year. Net debt was
reduced by £95.6m reflecting this cash
generation and the weakness of the dollar.
At constant exchange rates the reduction
was £53.6m.
Capital expenditure during the year was
reduced in line with market conditions. 
The total for the year was £72.3m (2003 –
£85.5m) of which £64.1m (2003 – £71.0m)
was spent on the rental fleet. It is anticipated
that capital expenditure in the coming year
will rise to approximately £100m, in line
with the depreciation charge. The average
age of the Group’s fleet at 30 April 2004
was 46 months (43 months in the UK and
48 months in total for the US but, when
the longer-life aerial work platform fleet is
excluded, the average fleet age for the rest
of the US fleet reduces to 35 months).
Profits on disposal of fixed assets were
£6.2m up from £3.0m in the previous year.
Current trading and outlook
The improving turnover performance, seen
in the last quarter of the financial year,
continued in the months of May and June.
Sunbelt’s dollar revenues grew 10.9% 
while A-Plant achieved like for like growth
of 2.4%. 
While a further weakening of the US dollar
and the prospect of higher interest rates
could have some negative impact, the
Board is encouraged by the improving
trends in its businesses and in the markets
in which they operate, and believes that
further progress should be achieved in the
coming year.

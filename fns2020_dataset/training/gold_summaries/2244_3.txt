Chairman’s Statement
The world, particularly in the West, is inching its way back to 
recovery, weighed down by public debt and fiscal imbalances 
in the aftermath of a financial crisis which has done lasting 
damage to business confidence. In the aftermath of the 
economic earthquake, a new world is emerging. 
At the same time, the publishing world is handling its own 
revolution. Digital competence is undermining old business 
models, spawning new ones and allowing major new forces to 
transform – or render irrelevant – traditional relationships.
Charles Darwin observed that “It is not the strongest of the 
species, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is 
the most adaptable to change”. Bloomsbury is undergoing one 
of the most significant periods of adaptation in its 25 year history. 
The Chief Executive’s Report covers the re-organisation 
of the Group to exploit the global horizons opened in the 
publishing industry by digital technology; the continued 
pace of acquisitions; the move into new premises later this 
year; the overhaul of key internal systems; and Bloomsbury’s 
adaptation to meet the needs of the growing population of 
e-readers who are provoking one of the most profound re-
assessments of the conventional publishing industry since the 
development of the printing press.
The Board of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc has also been  
re-positioned. 
Ian Cormack and Sarah Jane Thomson have joined the Board 
as non-Executive Directors following the retirement of Charles 
Black and Mike Mayer, and Wendy Pallot has joined the Board 
as Group Finance Director replacing Colin Adams. 
Ian Cormack has had a successful City career in leading 
international and UK roles at AIG, Citigroup and Citibank, 
where he spent over thirty years. A former member of the 
Chancellor’s City Advisory Panel, he has served on committees 
for the London Stock Exchange, CHAPS, APACS, the European 
Securities Forum, Cedel and the Bank of England. Ian Cormack 
is Senior Independent Director of Bloomsbury and Chair of 
the Audit Committee. He brings to Bloomsbury the experience 
and discipline of a career with some of the finest corporate 
institutions in the world. 
Sarah Jane Thomson founded Thomson Intermedia Plc in 
1997 (now Ebiquity Plc), a media information business using 
internet and technology to capture and deliver real-time 
advertising creatives and expenditure data for businesses. The 
company was floated on AIM in 2000 and she remains on the 
Board. In 2006 she founded First News, the weekly newspaper 
for children which has become the most widely read children’s 
“The publishing world is handling 
its own revolution. Digital 
competence is undermining old 
business models, spawning new 
ones and allowing major new forces 
to transform – or render irrelevant 
– traditional relationships.”

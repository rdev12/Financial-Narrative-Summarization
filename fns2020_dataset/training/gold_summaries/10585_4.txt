Wolseley
Wolseley is the leading supplier of construction products,
materials and services across Europe and North America. 
The company’s historical success and future growth
objectives has resulted in its continued investment in key
business improvement initiatives such as the management of
IT service delivery across the business. In support of this,
Morse was chosen to assist in delivering a common global
Systems and Service Management solution founded on ITIL
best practice.  
Working in partnership with Wolseley, Morse provided
independent advice and guidance in selecting the technology,
developing the architecture and implementing the global 
end-to-end solution. Morse delivered a single global Service
Desk instance and integrated Systems Management solution.
The Service Desk is tightly integrated into a Knowledge
Management system presented through a self-service portal,
empowering the client’s end-user community and resulting in
a reduction of Service Desk support costs.

Convergence - customers win through PlusNet
Convergence - myth or reality?
In the main, convergent services are being delivered by bringing 
together disparate technologies within the home and it is 
generally left to the consumer to resolve and manage the 
complex interoperating of multiple services using multiple 
devices. This leads to the consumer having to deal with disparate 
suppliers and therefore having to negotiate multiple experiences 
which increases the hassle factor and the general apathy towards 
convergence as being too hard and difficult to achieve. Coupled 
with this is the disadvantage of creating a world of multiple bills 
being received by the customer.
PlusNet uses Workplace to aggregate networks and technologies 
without the cost associated with ownership of infrastructure. 
By providing a single customer experience to the customer 
and crucially, one bill, PlusNet will use Workplace to enable 
convergence to its true potential.
Workplace enables a converged world:
A web based transactional relationship with PlusNet 
customers, providing the most effective mechanism of 
delivering maxium choice of new products and services.
A web based customer support system which puts the 
customer in control, driving an excellent customer service 
experience.
Low-cost of operation allowing PlusNet to offer new products 
and services at highly competitive prices whilst maintaining 
profitability.
Cost effective aggregation of third party networks giving 
flexibility in a converging communications world and 
minimising capital expenditure requirements.
Comprehensive automated network traffic management 
allowing PlusNet to assure quality of service to its customers  
while optimising network costs.

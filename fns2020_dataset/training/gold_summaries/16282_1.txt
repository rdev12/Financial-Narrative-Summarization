UK Mail Report & Accounts 2014          Strategic Report
These results reflect an excellent year for UK Mail, with increased revenues and
strong margin progression.  We have also achieved profitable growth across all
areas of the business.  Such a robust performance shows that we have
accomplished almost all that we set out to achieve through the programme of
investment and change over recent years.
We continue to benefit from our strong market positions across our business
thanks to our efficient integrated network and high service levels.  During March
2014 we experienced the highest ever daily volumes across our combined
parcels and mail businesses; given the Group’s continued focus on network
management we maintained our strong customer service levels.
Reported Group revenues for the year at £508.5m were up 7.0% compared to the
previous year.  Adjusting for there being four extra working days than in the
previous year, underlying Group revenues increased by 5.3%.  Group profit
before tax increased by 28.2% on the previous year to £22.8m. We estimate that
each extra working day equates to some £0.5m of contribution.  Adjusting for
this factor the underlying increase in profit before tax was some 17.0%.
Our Parcels business (43% of group revenues) continued to deliver a good
performance, with high volumes throughout the year, leading to an increase in
market share and a double-digit operating margin of 10.2% (2013: 8.6%). This
volume growth was partly driven by an increase in home deliveries related to
online shopping, with a continuation of the mix change towards B2C that we
have previously seen.  Revenues grew by 16.2% to £219.9m (2013: £189.3m)
and operating profit grew strongly by 37.2% to £22.4m (2013: £16.3m) as we
continued to focus on innovation and operational efficiency to help drive margin
improvement.
Our Mail business (48% of group revenues) showed a 1.5% increase in revenues
for the year alongside a positive uplift in volumes, driven by strong customer
retention and new business wins. Our mail volumes increased by some 2.0%
compared to the prior year, while the overall UK mail market has seen a decline
in transactional volumes of some 5% per annum in recent years. Operating profit
increased by 18.0% to £12.7m (2013:  £10.7m) and the operating margin
increased to 5.2% (2013: 4.4%).  Our Mail business remains well positioned in
its market with a healthy pipeline of new business opportunities.  We again saw
good progress from imail and other new product innovations.
Our Courier business (3% of group revenues) saw an improving trend of revenue
throughout the year, however for the full year revenues declined by 1.9%. Strong
operational management reduced operating costs, helping to increase the operating
margin to 17.0% for the period (2013: 15.5%), leading to 7.2% growth in operating
profit to £2.7m (2013: £2.6m).
In our Pallets business (6% of group revenues) revenues declined by 3.2%, however
operating profit increased by 18.8% to £0.9m (2013:  £0.8m).
The move of our head office and national hub to a newly constructed site in 2015
will be a major change for our business.  The new automated hub will be a
significant major step forward in how we operate, creating extra capacity and
reducing operating costs. The move however will create challenges as we relocate
with a key objective being to retain the knowledge and experience of our teams. We
have instigated a programme to manage this change which will involve substantial
engagement with our staff.
Our cash generation and financial position remains strong with net cash balances
at the period end of £27.0m (2013:  £27.0m).

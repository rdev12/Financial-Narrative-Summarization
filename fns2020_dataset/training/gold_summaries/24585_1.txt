CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  
HEADLINES
The year to 30 June 2016 saw a return to 
profit growth, allied to substantial new assets 
and new clients in what was an eventful geo-
political financial year.
Profit before tax for the year grew 10% to 
£218.9 million, aided by revenue from new 
and existing assets and clients, increased 
net interest income, strong flows into new 
Hargreaves Lansdown funds and energetic 
client equity trading, particularly towards the 
end of the financial year. 
Net new business was £6.0 billion (2015: 
£6.1bn), representing 11% growth in Assets 
Under Administration (AUA). At 30 June 
2016 AUA stood at £61.7 billion, up 12% (30 
June 2015: £55.2bn). Assets broke through 
the £60bn level for the first time, despite 
lower stock markets, with the FTSE All-
Share averaging 5.1% lower than last year 
and ongoing depressed investor confidence, 
which always makes gathering new business 
more challenging.
We welcomed 100,000 new active clients, 
up 19% on last year (2015: 84,000). Active 
client numbers were 836,000 at 30 June 
2016 (30 June 2015: 736,000). Hargreaves 
Lansdown remains the largest business of 
its type in the UK, with 37.5% of the direct 
investment market at 31 March 2016 (Source: 
Platforum*), up from 35.9% in September 
2015 and its market share of UK execution 
only stockbroking rose from 24.1% to 
27.3%** over the past year. 
Continued high service levels were rewarded 
through our high asset retention rate of 
93.5% (2015: 92.7%) and client retention 
rate of 94.3% (2015: 93.4%). Hargreaves 
Lansdown continues to win substantial 
numbers of awards for client service. Our 
Net Promoter ScoreSM of 54.7% is excellent 
and a reflection of our commitment to client 
service excellence.
WE ARE PLEASED TO PRESENT OUR RESULTS FOR THE 
YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016, REPORTING A STRONG 
PROFIT INCREASE, ALONGSIDE EXCELLENT GROWTH 
IN CLIENTS AND CLIENT ASSETS, WHICH NOW EXCEED 
£60BN FOR THE FIRST TIME.

HARGREAVES LANSDOWN’S 
2016 RESULTS
Profit before tax for the year was a record 
£218.9 million. High client satisfaction drove 
strong client recruitment and retention, 
with associated additional fees and income. 
Our Multi-Manager funds continued to be 
popular, generating £44.1 million of fund 
management income and our new initiatives, 
particularly new fund launches, also proved 
successful. Whilst bank deposit rates 
continued to fall, measures put in place in 
2015 to stabilise interest income for both 
Hargreaves Lansdown and clients paid off, 
delivering increased returns from this source. 
Client equity trading volumes during the 
year were considerably higher, up 9% at 3.7 
million (2015: 3.4 million), driven particularly 
by speculation and volatility around the 
EU referendum, with a record 63,000 
trades conducted on 24 June 2016. This 
additional trading drove higher stockbroking 
commission. 
We are well positioned to take advantage 
of the structural opportunity for growth 
in the savings and investments market. 
We continue to see opportunities for 
controlled, selective investment where we 
are confident in delivering attractive returns 
for our shareholders. In this context, we 
demonstrated good cost control in the second 
half of the year with 7% growth in operating 
costs in the second half, compared to 19% 
in the first half. Given the macro-economic 
backdrop, we are very pleased with the profit 
growth achieved.
By far the most substantial profit headwind 
was the level of stock markets through the 
year. Although by 30 June 2016 the FTSE 
All Share Index finished down only 1.5% 
on the year before at 3515.45, a late “post 
Brexit” rally at the end of June 2016 masked 
considerably depressed stock market levels 
throughout the year. On average during 
the financial year to 30 June 2016, the 
Index traded at a level 5.1% lower than the 
comparative period in 2015, and investor 
confidence was subdued. Our platform and 
management fee income is directly linked 
to client asset values, and had markets 
remained flat profit growth would have been 
even higher.
Clients and assets again grew substantially, 
with the year-end assets of our 836,000 
active clients valued at £61.7 billion. Net new 
pension (SIPP) assets were £2.7bn (2015: 
£2.3bn), up 17%, reflecting the continued 
popularity of the Pension Freedom rules. 
Individual Savings Account (ISA) net new 
business was down 15% at £2.2 billion (2015: 
£2.6bn) and Fund and Share account net new 
business flat at £1.1 billion (2015: £1.1bn). 
ISA and Fund and Share account business 
tends to be more reflective of stock market 
performance and given the difficult markets 
and low investor confidence, we are not 
surprised by levels of net new business in 
these areas. Deals with JP Morgan and Jupiter 
led to the acquisition of 6,588 new clients 
and £264 million of new assets added to our 
Vantage service.
There continued to be considerable demand 
for Hargreaves Lansdown’s expanding 
asset management capability amongst our 
clients. At 30 June 2016 assets in Hargreaves 
Lansdown Multi-Manager funds stood at 
£6.3 billion (2015: £5.6bn), up 13%. Two new 
fund launches, “High Income” and “Strategic 
Assets”, had a combined total of £380 million 
in assets at 30 June 2016. Our HL Portfolio+ 
online “robo” investing service continued to 
attract assets, with £311 million of assets at 
the year-end (2015: £26m). 
The Corporate Vantage service had 335 
schemes live or in implementation by the 
year end (2015: 256), a 31% increase. An 
additional 15,242 net new members joined 
the service (2015: 11,134), up 29%, and 
assets in our Corporate Vantage service 
stood at £1.76 billion by 30 June 2016 
(2015: £1.30 bn), up 35%. Annual premiums 
invested by employees and companies were 
£244.1 million (2015: £197.0m), up 24%. 
Growth in this service, particularly in the 
first half of last year, was constrained by the 
effect of new auto-enrolment rules on our 
key markets, with many companies focusing 
on achieving compliance rather than selecting 
new schemes. New corporate business has 
benefited from the absence of that drag this 
year.
The interest rate environment remains 
depressed, and therefore income from cash 
balances continued to reflect low interest 
rates. However, in April 2015 we completed 
changes to our SIPP which allowed us 
to place client money on term deposit, a 
significant development as over 50% of cash 
held by clients with Hargreaves Lansdown is 
held in the SIPP . This allowed us to increase 
both revenue and deposit rates paid to clients 
holding cash in their SIPP . Whilst interest 
rates remain low we expect to continue 
to experience subdued margins on cash 
balances.

2016/2017 MARKET OUTLOOK
A major impact on market outlook is 
uncertainty caused by the UK’s referendum 
decision on 23 June 2016 to leave the EU.
Hargreaves Lansdown remained neutral 
throughout this debate, believing it a matter 
for the British people to decide. In the 
short term we have seen elevated levels of 
equity trading in response to volatility, and 
weakness in the pound leading to strong 
relative performance of overseas funds and 
investments. The long-term implications of 
the vote are unknown. However, we remain 
confident about the future and consider our 
business to be robust. Hargreaves Lansdown 
is the largest business of its kind in the UK 
and not dependent on any single asset class 
or investment to prosper. The requirement for 
individuals and corporates to commit to long-
term savings remains.
Throughout 2015/2016 UK stock markets 
were depressed, but despite this we 
have reported strong results. The words 
“headwind” and “low investor confidence” 
seem to have featured throughout recent 
annual reports. Whilst in the short-term 
volatility and uncertainty may continue, as 
more clarity develops on the execution path 
for leaving the EU we hope 2016/2017 may 
see better markets. 
We have already seen a cut to base interest 
rates. Further changes to rates are also 
possible and would have a commensurate 
effect on our interest income. 
GROUP OUTLOOK
Hargreaves Lansdown is well positioned to 
sustain its growth within the UK savings and 
investments market. Retail clients continue 
to need to manage their finances using a 
trusted, safe and secure platform that is easy 
and efficient to deal with in an increasingly 
complex economic environment. 
Our 2016 performance has delivered a return 
to healthy profit growth, as anticipated in the 
2015 report. We remain confident in investing 
in our strategy to develop products and 
services which will complement the future 
growth of Hargreaves Lansdown. Business 
in the first two months of the new financial 
year has been in line with management’s 
expectations, with stockbroking activity from 
investors taking advantage of recent volatility 
and fund investment relatively quiet over the 
summer months. The Board’s confidence in 
the business model is reflected in its approval 
of a total dividend for 2016 of 34.0p (2015: 
33.0p), representing 3% year on year growth 
and a pay-out ratio of 91% (2015: 99%). 
In the year to 30 June 2017 we look forward 
to the launch of HL Savings, our cash man-
agement service. A “soft” initial launch will 
allow us to test and refine the service. We 
therefore do not expect HL Savings to have 
a material bearing on financial results for the 
year to 30 June 2017. However, this project 
remains on track and will mark our entry into 
an asset sector of significant interest to all 
our clients – cash deposits – as well as Peer 
to Peer lending which will follow in 2017. 
We intend to expand our fund management 
range and to grow the Portfolio+ service. 
The Corporate service has also again shown 
good growth and, whilst a long term project, 
is adding assets apace and deserves the 
continued investment we are making in its 
distribution capability.
Mobile services remain important and we 
have invested in replacing our mobile phone 
apps. We have always been at the forefront 
of mobile investing and our new version of HL 
Live for iPhone and Android will launch during 
the coming year, building on our data and 
experience of our clients’ mobile investing 
needs. The strong position we have in the UK 
savings and investments market, together 
with the selective investment we have 
undertaken to further enhance our customer 
proposition, underpins our confidence in 
continuing to deliver attractive growth and 
returns for our shareholders.

THE IMPACT OF REGULATION 
AND GOVERNMENT POLICY
Looking forward, we see further growth in the 
direct investment market. 
 
Regulation is an ever present theme in 
financial services. Addressing regulatory 
change takes up a considerable amount of 
our time and resources. However, Hargreaves 
Lansdown is well-placed to address these 
challenges. Whilst there are always further 
regulatory changes coming down the track, 
we have not identified any likely to have an 
unusually material impact. 
CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
Hargreaves Lansdown is an ethical company 
and champion of the retail investor. We 
campaign tirelessly on behalf of retail 
investors to improve their lot and their 
wealth.
We continue to encourage price competition 
within the fund industry which has resulted 
in reduced costs of both active and passive 
funds for investors. We have negotiated 
market leading discounts on some of the best 
UK funds to the benefit of our clients.
This year will see the launch of the HL 
Charitable Foundation to further aid our 
charity and community work. The Foundation 
is explained more in the corporate social 
responsibility section and I wish it every 
success. We have also invested considerably 
in our people this year, making Hargreaves 
Lansdown an even more exciting place to work.
As in previous years, Hargreaves Lansdown 
continues to pay its tax in full in the UK.
CONCLUSION
I would like to thank our clients, shareholders, 
colleagues and my fellow Directors in what 
has once again been a very busy year 
of significant progress. The support and 
dedication they have shown has delivered 
another set of strong results.
We have also announced I shall be stepping 
down as Chief Executive of Hargreaves 
Lansdown no later than 30 September 2017.
I have been proud to work with, and therefore 
give my thanks to the exceptional clients, 
colleagues and shareholders of Hargreaves 
Lansdown who have supported the Group as 
it has risen to become an admired, mature 
and established FTSE 100 business.  I believe 
the Group is in excellent hands and that the 
business shall be best served by natural 
succession as it pursues its exciting future.

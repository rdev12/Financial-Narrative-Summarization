Competent person statement 
The resource information in this report is based on information reviewed by Mr Pierre Charlent, Chief Operating Officer of Toledo Mining Corporation, who is a Member of the Australasian Institute of Mining &
Metallurgy. Mr Charlent has sufficient experience, which is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activities undertaken, to qualify as a Competent Person as defined 
in the 2004 Edition of the “Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves” (the JORC Code). Mr Charlent consents to the inclusion in this report of the matters
based on this information, in the form and context in which they appear. page 3

1 Potential Resources are extracted from estimates  by previous explorers and tenement owners, and are defined as being conceptual in nature with insufficient exploration to define the Mineral Resources
and with uncertainty as to whether further exploration will result in the confirmation of the Mineral Resource.
The Company has strategic interests in four large nickel deposits 
on the island of Palawan. These deposits contain a total potential
resource of approximately 3.8 million tonnes nickel metal.
The Berong nickel mine, in which Toledo has an economic interest of 56.1%, exports saprolite and limonite ores to customers in China
where it is used in the production of ferronickel and nickel pig iron, both utilised in the manufacture of stainless steel. 
As the nickel deposit at Berong is relatively shallow, the mining technique used is essentially free digging i.e. it only requires the use of
basic equipment (excavators, tractors and dump trucks). There is no chemical treatment process and consequently there are no complex
waste management issues. The ore contains 40% water when it is first mined and has to be assayed, sorted, dried and blended before
being sent to the coastal stockpiles prior to shipping. The mine’s proximity to the sea enables relatively straightforward trucking, 
barging and shipping. The Company does not have a port facility large enough, nor is the water deep enough to allow sizeable vessels 
to dock near the mine. Instead the ore is loaded on to barges from a causeway and transported out to the waiting ship for onward
transportation to China.
Rehabilitation of the areas that have been mined is an important part of the whole process and we are proud that Berong has achieved
recognition for the considerable efforts it has made in this area. 
Moorsom and Long Point are two other properties that lie to the north east of Berong. Some drilling has been carried out at Moorsom
but both projects are currently awaiting permitting.
The Company has interests in an additional laterite property – Ipilan – in which the Company holds a 52% economic interest. Ipilan 
is also located on Palawan Island. It covers an area of 2,835 hectares and permitting is at an advanced stage.

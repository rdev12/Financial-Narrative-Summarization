Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s review
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
MARK DIXON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Following a record year of growth we 
have ﬁ rmly established ourselves with an 
unrivalled global network. At the same 
time we also strengthened our presence at 
both a local and national level across the 
100 countries in which we now operate. 
As we embed our business more deeply 
into local communities, we take seriously 
our commitment to support them. The 
endeavours of our team members, with 
the backing of the business, have helped 
thousands of individuals around the world 
and I thank them for their efforts. 
Group revenues increased by 23.3% to 
£1,533.5m (2012: £1,244.1m) reﬂ ecting 
the signiﬁ cant expansion of our network. 
In total £301.1m was invested in growth 
(2012: £178.4m), the result of which 
was a 30% increase in business centre 
locations to 1,831 (2012: 1,411). At the 
same time operating proﬁ t was marginally 
up at £90.8m (2012: £90.2m). Given the 
scale, pace and costs of growth, this is a 
strong result.
Our Mature business remains the 
proﬁ t and cash engine of the Group. 
Operating proﬁ ts rose by 33% to £205.3m, 
in part due to further improvements to 
yield management, with free cash ﬂ ow 
(after tax, ﬁ nance costs and maintenance 
capital expenditure) at £156.5m (16.6p 
per share), on the back of revenues up 
3.7% to £1,226.3m. Mature EPS also 
increased by 34% to 17.0p (2012: 12.7p).
Costs remain ﬁ rmly under control, 
notwithstanding the signiﬁ cant investment 
required to support growth. Improved 
efﬁ ciency and scale continued to deliver 
beneﬁ ts, with overheads (excluding 
Research & Development) on a per-
available-workstation basis down by 3.8%.
We have been able to deliver this 
performance in large part due to the 
fundamental improvements to our country 
management structure. These results 
clearly reﬂ ect the quality of our team 
and their skill in making the right, often 
tough, decisions to drive performance 
in what remained a challenging 
macro environment.
We continue to respond to the 
fundamental changes affecting how we 
all work, namely the shift from a ﬁ xed to 
a ﬂ exible mode of working. Our fortunes 
are inextricably linked to progress and 
developments in this high-growth market. 
Among the core drivers of growth for 
Regus are the signiﬁ cant cost savings 
associated with moving to more ﬂ exible 
workplace arrangement and outsourcing 
this to specialist providers such as Regus, 
as well as continued technological 
advances, which allow us to work 
from anywhere. Other drivers include 
demographic changes, sustainability 
and the growing societal importance of 
work-life balance. As a result, ﬂ exible 
working has come to be viewed as a 
core element of the way organisations 
operate and conduct business.

Our business model has continually 
evolved to reﬂ ect the changing work 
needs of business and individuals. 
Our over-arching aim has always been to 
provide our customers with the best 
possible help and support in deciding 
where and how they work. In doing so we 
have created a strong and vibrant business 
which generates signiﬁ cant long-term 
shareholder returns.
I will now review the performance of 
our business. 
It has been another year of signiﬁ cant achievement for 
Regus. These strong results underline the fundamental 
strengths of our business and its forward momentum in 
a growing market. 16 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Performance against our strategic 
objectives
Improve profi tability
The performance of our core Mature 
Centres business (centres opened on or 
before 31 December 2011) underpins 
all growth activity within the Group. 
We remain pleased with the levels of 
occupancy, averaging 83.8% through the 
year, and the improvement of REVPOW 
to £7,750, an increase of 4.3% (up £321), 
a sign of robust yield management. 
This healthy occupancy and increased 
REVPOW drove incremental revenue 
growth which, with operational gearing, 
is then reﬂ ected in the improvement in 
mature gross proﬁ t margin to 29.3% 
(2012: 27.8%).
The 2011 new centres, which joined the 
mature estate in 2013, signiﬁ cantly closed 
the gap with the existing mature estate 
and are now performing at a similar 
gross proﬁ t before depreciation and 
amortisation margin. 
Our New Centres business (centres 
opened on or after 1 January 2012) has 
equally performed well and in line with 
expectations. Our primary objective is to 
ensure that all new centres perform in line 
with the rest of the mature estate as soon 
as possible.
• The ﬁ nancial maturity proﬁ le of our 2012 
centres is in line with expectations. 
These generated £139.4m of revenue 
and made a positive centre contribution 
of £6.9m. This translated into a gross 
proﬁ t margin before depreciation and 
amortisation of 15.1%.
• The 448 centres that we added during 
2013 generated revenues of £159.4m 
and made a centre contribution of 
£7.3m, in line with our expectations. 
Within this the acquisition of MWB has 
contributed strongly at the gross 
proﬁ t level.
• The heavy overhead investment required 
to open and support these new centres 
resulted in a drag of £114.0m on the 
Group’s operating proﬁ t (2012: £62.6m). 
Develop national networks
This has been a record period of growth 
for Regus. We have opened more than 
500 locations – 448 business centres and 
76 third place. In doing so we expanded 
our reach and enhanced our long-term 
earnings potential.
It is a testament to the fundamental 
strength of our business model, the 
robustness of our systems and processes 
and the skill and determination of our 
teams around the world that we have been 
able to execute this part of our strategy 
whilst also maintaining our day-to-day 
operational performance at such a 
consistently high level.
When a business looks to outsource its 
workplace requirements, location is 
typically the primary consideration. It is 
for this reason that we are investing in 
local and national networks, taking the 
products and services we provide closer 
to where business needs us to be. 
Growth, therefore, both in our core 
business centre network and into third 
place locations such as airports, retail 
outlets and community centres, is a key 
objective for the Group. 
This year we expect to add at least 300 
new business centres, and many new 
third place locations. We continue to ﬁ nd 
plenty of opportunities, both organic 
and through acquisition, to grow our 
network on terms that meet our stringent 
investment criteria and which are capable 
of delivering long-term sustainable returns. 
The integration of MWB into our UK 
business, achieving all identiﬁ ed synergies, 
provides a clear demonstration of 
our ability to deliver value through 
incremental acquisitions.
As we grew we also continued to improve 
the composition of our business with 84% 
of leases now either ﬂ exible or variable 
(2012: 82%).
Our growing network is attractive to the 
increasing numbers of businesses looking 
to outsource their workplace needs and 
adopt more ﬂ exible working practices in 
general. As a consequence, end user 
demand for Regus products and services 
remains strong. Over the course of 2013 
customer numbers increased by more than 
200,000 to 1.58m.

Attracting more large corporate customers 
to our business remains a key priority. 
We believe our network scale and reach is 
an important and crucial differentiator as 
these organisations seek to rationalise their 
small-ofﬁ ce networks, move towards more 
ﬂ exible work arrangements and reduce 
ﬁ xed costs. Notable new wins and contract 
extensions amongst many include: Twitter, 
whom we helped open in 12 new countries 
over the year; Toshiba, supporting 1,000 
of their Retail Point-of-Sales team across 
14 countries; and, Electronic Arts, 
supporting them in markets such as China 
and Russia as well as opening in new ones 
across Europe and Asia. We also extended 
our relationships with Apple, Accenture, 
EDF Energy and RBS amongst others.
Industry leading innovation
The quality and breadth of Regus locations 
and associated products and services 
are core to our differentiation and, are 
why customers choose to work with us. 
We recognise that innovation is at the core 
of maintaining our market-leading position 
– we invest in Research & Development 
to ensure we stay ahead of the curve 
and continue to develop the locations, 
products and services that attract 
customers to Regus. Over the period 
we invested £7.2m in Research & 
Development (2012: £4.5m). This ensures 
we are best placed to anticipate and 
respond to the needs of our customers. 
It also helps us deﬁ ne the workplace 
sector, thereby enhancing our leadership 
position.
During 2013 we continued development in 
a number of important areas, not least with 
regards to the IT and telephony services 
we provide to customers. One of the core 
attractions of Regus to mobile workers 
is the way that we can improve their 
productivity while they are on the move; 
our cloud printing solution DocStation has 
proved popular and continues to be rolled 
out globally. We also concluded market 
testing of the WorkBox concept. This is 
a self-contained, fully resourced private 
workspace with a footprint of four square 
metres, ideal for locations with high 
transient footfall such as airports and 
service stations. We intend to begin 
deployment in 2014.
Third place continues to make encouraging 
progress and is a fundamental part of our 
growth strategy. Over the last year we 
extended our relationship with Shell and 
signed agreements to add additional 
locations to the UK motorway network. 
Since year-end we signed our ﬁ rst deal 
outside Europe with the Singapore 
Government for the placing of facilities 
in public libraries. We have also signed 
agreements to open drop-in business 
lounges at Heathrow and Gatwick airports. 
Given the scale of the market opportunity 
we are encouraged by both end user 
adoption and interest from potential new 
partners. This is driving rapid growth; 
however, in the context of our signiﬁ cant 
business centre operation it remains small 
at this stage.
Cost control
One of the fundamental strengths of 
our business is its ability to grow and 
leverage the beneﬁ ts of additional scale. 
Despite signiﬁ cant investment in growth, 
total overheads (excluding investment in 
Research & Development) as a percentage 
of revenue reduced marginally to 18.0%. 
Against an increase in the network of 30%, 
total overheads (excluding investment 
in Research & Development and MWB 
related transaction and restructuring costs) 
increased by 19.0%. In addition to the 
scale beneﬁ ts mentioned earlier two 
other factors are driving this improvement, 
namely the delayering and strengthening 
of management and automation of our 
back-ofﬁ ce processes. The standardisation 
of repeatable tasks in our back ofﬁ ce 
allows us to concentrate activities within 
our single service centre in Manila and 
harmonise service levels, bringing 
signiﬁ cant productivity gains and freeing up 
centre teams for higher-value-add tasks.
A high performing team
No commentary on our business 
performance would be complete without 
reference to our dedicated workforce, 
without whose efforts we could not have 
achieved the progress we have made 
so far. Our ability to deliver at the local 
level becomes ever more dependent 
on the strength of our local, in-country 
management teams. In many respects 
this performance is a direct result of the 
management and structural improvements 
we have made at both a Group and a 
country level and the devolution of 
day-to-day operational decision making. 
This process continues and we are 
making signiﬁ cant hires within all country 
management teams as we expand.
As a service-based business the strength 
and capabilities of our increasingly 
geographically diverse team are critical to 
achieving our objectives. We recognise the 
importance of people development and the 
Regus Online Learning Academy together 
with a wide range of additional initiatives 
gives our team members the opportunity 
to learn and enhance the skills that will 
ensure they are capable of achieving their 
career ambitions. We are committed to a 
fair approach and equal opportunities in all 
areas of our business.
Culturally we employ more than 100 
nationalities and, with regard to gender, we 
aim to achieve broadly equal outcomes for 
women and men. For the Group as 
a whole our workforce is 70% female: 
30% male; at a Group operational level 
the breakdown is broadly equal, and at a 
senior management level 30% of positions 
are held by women. We successfully 
recruit, train, promote and retain skilled 
and motivated team members with very 
diverse backgrounds. This is a core 
strength and critical to the successful 
development of our business.
Operational Review
Over the year the Group added 448 new 
centres (2012: 243) with the total number 
as of 31 December 2013 standing at 1,831 
(2012: 1,411). This growth resulted in an 
increase in total workstation capacity 
(including non-consolidated workstations) 
of 26.9% to 304,774 and the number 
of consolidated workstations as at 31 
December 2013 by 27.5% to 292,655.
To review our business more meaningfully, 
we will concentrate on our Mature 
business performance development, 
which represents like-for-like business.

This business posted another good 
performance. Mature revenues were up 
4.2% at constant currency to £534.0m 
(up 4.8% at actual rates), with average 
mature occupancy of 85.5% during the

196 centres. This increased our network 
to 875 business centre locations and 
took us into 83 new cities and markets 
including: Beverly Hills, California; 
St Pauls, Minnesota; and Langley, 
Canada. This growth contributed to a 
27% increase in the average number 
of consolidated workstations from 
90,617 in 2012 to 114,984 in 2013.

This geographically diverse business 
also delivered a strong performance in 
spite of challenges in some markets. 
Mature revenues were up 2.2% at constant 
currency to £298.3m (up 5.2% at actual 
rates), and achieved an average mature 
occupancy of 81.4% (2012: 80.9%). 
Mature gross margin remained stable at 
27.7% (2012: 27.6%). During the year, 
we added 126 centres, increasing our 
network to 450 business centre locations, 
and opening in 23 new cities including: 
Pretoria, South Africa; Naples, Italy; and 
Dortmund, Germany. This contributed to 
a 13% increase in the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 41,531 in 
2012 to 46,973 in 2013.
Asia Pacifi c
Our APAC business continued its robust 
performance delivering mature revenues of 
£181.6m, up 3.2% on constant currency 
(down 1.7% at actual rates) and achieved 
an average mature occupancy of 83.5% 
(2012: 83.3%). Mature gross margins 
improved to 32.3% (2012: 31.2%). 
During the year we added 58 new centre 
openings, increasing the network to 290 
business centre locations, and opening in 
ten new cities, including: Ningbo, China; 
Penang, Malaysia; and Kathmandu, Nepal, 
our 100th country. This contributed to a 
37% increase in the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 34,557 in 
2012 to 47,188 in 2013. 
UK
Our UK business made further strong 
progress delivering mature revenues of 
£210.7m, up 3.8% on 2012. Mature gross 
margins improved to 23.9% (2012: 18.5%) 
and average mature occupancy remained 
healthy at 82.8% (2012: 83.1%). Including 
the acquisition of MWB, 68 new business 
centre locations were added increasing 
the network to 216. This resulted in a 
34% increase in the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 37,754 in 
2012 to 50,630 in 2013. It is important to 
note that the integration of MWB went as 
planned and we remain on track to achieve 
the identiﬁ ed synergy savings.
Outlook
Our business is in a strong position. We 
are well positioned to continue to grow our 
networks, customer base and earnings 
in 2014.
Strengthening and expanding our network 
is core to ensuring we continue to generate 
incremental returns over the medium term. 
At this early point in the year it is difﬁ cult to 
predict precisely how many locations we 
will add, but we expect to grow by at least 
300 new business centres during 2014 as 
well as add more third place locations.
Growth, when coupled with increased 
investment in innovation, will create 
additional demand for Regus’ products 
and services, especially from large 
corporates as they seek help in 
transitioning from ﬁ xed to ﬂ exible working. 
The overriding focus, therefore, remains on 
ﬁ nding opportunities that meet our strict 
ﬁ nancial returns criteria and are consistent 
with our strategic objectives.
Current trading is good, although the 
strengthening of sterling in recent months 
will affect the translation of our results. 
Notwithstanding this, we remain conﬁ dent 
in our business model and our prospects 
for the year ahead.

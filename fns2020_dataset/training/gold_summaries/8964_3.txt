Overview
I am pleased to report that K3 has 
delivered excellent results for the year 
to 30 June 2011 in a difficult trading 
environment. They demonstrate 
the strength of K3’s business model, 
with continued new business wins 
underpinned by high levels of recurring 
income. Revenues rose 20% to £52.80m 
(2010: 12 months £43.84m) and adjusted 
profit before tax
*1
 increased 29% to 
£8.68m (2010: 12 months £6.72m). Our 
long term recurring contracted income 
delivered 46% of the Group’s total 
income and has increased by 39% to 
£24.18m. A further 43% of income came 
from existing customers through the 
sale of additional services or products. 
The Group also continued to generate 
good cash flows.
Of particular note this year were 
the performances of the Managed 
Services Division and our international 
software operations. Both areas 
saw significant growth during the 
year. The strong performance at our 
international software operations, 
based in The Netherlands, was helped 
by significantly increased activity with 
Inter IKEA Systems B.V. (the owner and 
franchisor of the IKEA concept, the 
largest customer in the Group) as well 
as strong sales from our Pebblestone 
business unit and a significant increase 
in sales of our retail solutions in Holland 
and across Europe. Our core UK Retail 
and Manufacturing Software Divisions 
continued to win new customers 
and generated good profit and cash 
contributions in particularly tough 
domestic trading conditions.
The level of major contract wins which 
the Group secured was encouraging. 
We closed a total of £11.10m of major 
contracts during the year (2010:  
12 months £12.40m). Notable deals 
signed by our UK business included 
Hobbycraft, Topps Tiles and Sam 
McCauley, the chemists. 
We completed four acquisitions 
(Panacea, FDS Sage 200, Sense and 
Clarita) during the year. These have 
added additional technical skills, IP 
and new customers to whom we can 
cross-sell our products and services. 
Importantly, two acquisitions, Panacea 
and FDS Sage 200, have enabled us to 
complete our strategic move into the 
Sage marketplace. After the year end, 
we added a further two acquisitions and 
we will continue to seek suitable targets 
which will, in particular, increase the 
Group’s recurring income and provide 
sales opportunities for our Managed 
Services Division. 
The Managed Services Division almost 
quadrupled its revenues during the 
year (helped by the acquisition of 
Panacea during the first half) and we 
saw strong demand for these services 
across the Group. In the second half of 
the financial year, we signed an exclusive 
worldwide hosting agreement with 
SYSPRO, a leading developer of ERP 
solutions for the manufacturing sector 
globally. Managed Services represent a 
substantial growth opportunity for K3 
and the investment we made in the year 
has established a platform for growth. 
We will continue to focus on this major 
opportunity over the new financial year 
and beyond.
More broadly, the Group’s profitability 
continues to benefit from our strategy 
of developing our own library of 
Intellectual Property (“IP”). By enhancing 
the core business software products 
we resell, with our own IP , we enrich 
and tailor these solutions to the specific 
markets we serve. This improves both 
our competitive positioning and our 
operating profit.
While the economic climate remains 
challenging, we view K3’s growth 
prospects very positively. We see 
substantial, long-term growth 
opportunities, especially in hosting 
and managed services, which will 
drive recurring revenue growth and 
cash generation. The acquisitions we 
have made in the financial year under 
review, as well as in the prior year, have 
strengthened the Group and we expect 
K3 to make further strong progress in 
the new financial year. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2011

Financial Results
K3 changed its accounting year end to  
30 June (from 31 December) in December 
2009 to align its financial year end with 
Microsoft Corporation, with whom K3 
has a strong trading relationship, and to 
provide shareholders with greater visibility 
of likely year end results as K3 generates 
the greater proportion of its revenue in the 
latter half of the calendar year. 
The comparative audited figures for 2010 are 
for the 18 month period ended 30 June 2010, 
referred to throughout as “2010: 18 months” .
Unaudited results for the 12 months ended 
30 June 2010 have been extracted from the 
2010 financial statements (note 30). The 
Directors consider these provide a more 
meaningful comparison and are referred 
to throughout as “2010: 12 months” . 
Group revenues over the year ended 
30 June 2011 rose by 20% to £52.80m 
(2010: 12 months £43.84m; 18 months 
£59.78m). The four acquisitions 
completed in the year made a combined 
contribution of £7.98m to sales. Adjusted 
profit from operations

 over the year 
rose by 27% to £9.58m (2010: 12 months

to £8.68m (2010: 12 months £6.72m; 
18 months £7.66m). After taking into 
account amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, acquisition costs and 
exceptional reorganisation costs listed 
above, profit before taxation rose by 
10% over the year to £4.91m (2010:  
12 months £4.46m; 18 months £4.77m). 
The tax charge for the year ended 30 
June 2011 was £0.43m (2010:  
12 months £1.0m; 18 months £1.02m). 
The lower charge for 2011 against 2010 
reflected the greater proportion of 
earnings in Ireland and the Netherlands 
where tax rates are lower than in the UK, 
a reduction in the UK Corporation tax 
rate to 26% in the final quarter of the 
year and the deferred tax credit arising 
on acquisition intangible assets.
Adjusted earnings per share

 increased 
by 34% over the year to 27.5p (2010:  
12 months 20.5p; 18 months 23.7p) and 
basic earnings per share increased by 
20% to 17.5p over the year (2010:  
12 months 14.6p; 18 months 15.2p).
Cash flows and banking
K3 generates good cash flows, with 
a seasonal weighting in October-
December. Net cash generated from 
operating activities was £5.64m 
(2010: 12 months £6.86m; 18 months 
£7.33m). Operating cash flows in 
the year included £1.69m in respect 
of regularising liabilities that were 
significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at 
the date of acquiring companies and 
trades, £0.49m of acquisition costs and 
£0.45m of exceptional reorganisation 
costs. The underlying adjusted cash 
flow from operations therefore was 
£8.28m. During the year the Group 
made debt repayments of £2.87m, paid 
£0.98m of interest, paid tax of £1.37m 
and received proceeds from share 
issues of £0.17m. In addition, £5.10m 
was paid to the vendors of the four 
cash-based acquisitions, together with 
outstanding earn out payments from 
earlier acquisitions. Additional funds 
of £7.5m were received by way of bank 
loan to fund the acquisitions and the 
associated liabilities. Net debt at 30 June 
2011 has increased by £4.51m year on 
year, to stand at £15.49m (30 June 2010: 
£10.98m).
In September 2010, the Group agreed 
additional banking facilities including 
£5.0m of revolving credit facilities 
(“RCF”) for working capital purposes 
and a further £7.5m of RCF to fund 
acquisitions. After the year end, in July 
2011, an additional RCF of £1.05m for 
acquisitions was also made available. In 
July 2011, we also raised £5.09m net of 
costs in a placing of shares. 
Group reorganisation
We completed a reorganisation of the 
Group during the year which enabled 
the full integration of the acquired 
businesses to create a platform for future 
growth, at a cost of £0.45m (accounted 
for as an exceptional cost). Now that 
the reorganisation is complete we have 
four main trading divisions, Microsoft 
UK, International, SYSPRO and Sage, 
and Managed Services, together with 
Head office. Our financial reporting will 
reflect the Group’s new structure from 
1 July 2011 and comparative results for 
the year to 30 June 2011 under the new 
structure will be as follows:

Dividend
The Board is pleased to propose 
a final (and total) dividend for the 
financial year of 0.75p per share (2010: 
12 months 0.5p; 18 months 0.75p). 
Subject to shareholder approval at K3’s 
General Meeting, this dividend will be 
become payable on 12 January 2012 to

Outlook
K3 made very good progress in the 
financial year under review against 
challenging conditions in its core 
markets. Results demonstrate again the 
strength and resilience of K3’s business 
model, with strong cash flows, high 
levels of recurring income (46%) and 
existing customers generating a further 
43% of Group revenues a year. The 
strategic acquisitions we made, both 
this financial year and last, have added 
new IP , customers, technical skills and 
a global distribution network, and will 
benefit us in the current financial year 
and beyond.
Managed Services represents a 
significant opportunity for K3. We have 
been investing to create a platform for 
growth and further investment will be 
needed to fully exploit the potential.  
The Sage marketplace has opened 
up additional hosting-related growth 
opportunities, which we will also be 
focusing on.
K3 is well-positioned operationally and 
financially to continue its development. 
With the opportunities we see ahead of us, 
we view both short and long term growth 
prospects for the Group very positively.

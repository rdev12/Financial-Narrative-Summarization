 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 2
Chairman’s Statement
Sir Michael Heller
Turnover for the year to 30 September 2014 
was £5.51 million compared with £5.83 million 
the previous year. As we reported in May, 
sales during the first half of the year were 
impacted by delays to a number of discrete 
customer orders. However, sales in the 
second half returned to more normal levels 
in an environment which remains competitive.
Adjusted operating profit was £553,000, 
compared with £835,000, reflecting the 
reduced revenue in the first half. This 
underlying cash-based measure of our 
performance excludes non-cash IFRS 
charges and credits and represents an 
operating margin of 10.0% (2013: 14.3%). 
Statutory pre-tax profit for the year was 
£401,000 (2013: £794,000).
We have continued to move forwards our 
main products, Quantum VS and Vecta, in 
terms of their functionality, increasing R&D 
expenditure during the year to £981,000, 
up from £940,000 the previous year. 
Hosting revenues represented 52% of total 
revenues during the year under review. This 
is the first time they have exceeded half of 
our turnover. Contracted recurring revenues, 
which include annual software licence fees 
and hosting charges, amounted to 80% of 
total revenue compared with 77% in the 
previous year.
We have previously reported that we 
had accepted an offer for our property 
in Milton Keynes which is surplus to 
requirements. Regrettably this sale is 
now looking unlikely to proceed. Whilst 
we are actively exploring other opportunities 
to dispose of this property it is appropriate 
to transfer it from current assets back into 
fixed assets. At 30 September 2014 it is 
included in the Group balance sheet at 
£1.39 million net of depreciation. We will 
report any further progress in due course. 
We have one further surplus freehold property 
in Sheffield which is also included in fixed 
assets in the Group balance sheet at 
£303,000 and which is currently being 
marketed for sale.
Year-end cash balances were £5.0 million 
(2013: £5.7 million). This is after dividends 
paid during the year of £631,000. We continue 
to be interested in using our cash balances 
should opportunities to acquire similar 
software producing businesses arise.
Net assets at 30 September 2014 were 
£5.3 million compared to £6.1 million. 
The difference principally reflects a £619,000 
actuarial loss on the defined benefit pension 
scheme following a decrease in the discount 
rate used to value liabilities under IAS 19. 
This is explained more fully in the Chief 
Executive’s Statement.
The Board is proposing to maintain the 
final dividend at 2.0p per share giving a total 
for the year of 5.0p (2013: 7.0p). The total 
dividend paid to shareholders will therefore 
be £631,000. If approved by shareholders, 
the final dividend will be paid on 7 April 2015 
to those shareholders on the register at 
6 March 2015. The shares will be ex-dividend 
on 5 March 2015. 
We will review future dividends according 
to the acquisition opportunities that arise 
and our overall cash position at the time. 
However, in view of our relatively large cash 
balances and as reported at the time of our 
half year results, it is our current intention to 
pay an interim dividend of 2p per share and 
a final dividend of 3p per share in future years. 
I would like to thank all our members of 
staff and my colleagues on the Board for 
their contribution during the year.
Whilst we expect to face a number of 
challenges in the coming year, which are 
addressed in the Chief Executive’s Statement, 
we have made appropriate changes within 
the business in anticipation of this and 
I remain confident about the future.

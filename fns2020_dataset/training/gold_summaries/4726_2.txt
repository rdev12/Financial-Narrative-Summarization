Innovation
Products are specifically 
developed for our chosen 
markets. With product 
lifecycles currently 
less than two years we 
intend to remain ahead 
of our competition.
Value creation

energy savings of 60%, the 
reduction in CO
2
 emissions 
as well as zero maintenance 
costs through extended 
warranties and attractive 
payback periods all result 
in LED applications providing 
a lower cost of ownership.

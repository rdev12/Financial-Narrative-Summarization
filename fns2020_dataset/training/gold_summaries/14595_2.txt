“We are very pleased with our 
performance in 2011. The progress 
we made on all aspects of our 
strategy was fundamental to 
delivering these results. 
Whilst the current macro-economic 
outlook remains uncertain, the 
Board is confident that, as a result 
of continued investment in new 
products and applications, together 
with the growth opportunities 
and resilience which our recent 
acquisitions provide, Spectris is 
strategically well positioned for the 
year ahead.”
John O’Higgins 
Chief Executive

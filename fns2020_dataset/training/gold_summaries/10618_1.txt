Chief	Executive’s	
statement
Overview
One year into our three-year 
Transformation and Growth plan we 
have made good progress, but this is 
only the start of what we can achieve. 
In our three-year plan we outlined four 
things we needed to do:
1.	Operate	a	lean	retail	structure;
2.	Return	the	UK	to	profi 	tability;
3.	Drive	International	growth;	and
4.	Build	a	multi-channel	business.
I am pleased to say we have made 
progress against all of these. 
We have improved value, choice, service 
and delivery for our customers both in 
store and online and these are themes 
that we will continue to build on in the 
years ahead. Most importantly, I am 
pleased to say that we now have a full 
executive team that will lead Mothercare 
on the journey we started a year ago. 
The team brings together expertise in 
product development, merchandising, 
marketing and retail management both 
in the UK and Internationally; all of 
which is underpinned by a strong 
fi nance and people capability.
This executive team structure now 
refl ects the global nature of our business. 
Our operating model needs to ensure 
we develop the right products for all our 
customers at the right price and in the 
right quantities. Every transaction with 
each customer in all of our markets 
needs to help them on their special 
journey of parenthood. We now operate 
from 4.1 million sq. ft. globally and have 
1,324 stores across 61 countries. Nearly 
60 per cent of Worldwide network sales 
are generated outside the UK, which 
mirrors our footprint in terms of space. 
Our business is dependent on sourcing 
from Asia and includes countries like China, 
India and Bangladesh. As a mother and 
baby specialist, at Mothercare we take the 
safety and wellbeing of all those involved 
in the manufacture of our products very 
seriously. We have an ethical sourcing 
policy and a team in place, which regularly 
inspects all factory premises and ensures 
that our suppliers’ factories are safe and fi t 
for purpose. Recent events in Bangladesh 
highlight the importance of improving 
standards. Whilst our suppliers are not 
impacted, we have signed up to the 
Accord on Fire and Building Safety in 
Bangladesh to support the improvement 
in the safety and conditions of all those 
employed in the manufacture of goods.
Our people are fantastic ambassadors for 
our brands and, when we do things well, 
our customers respond very positively. As 
a true specialist, we are uniquely placed 
with parents and need to continue to 
make the most of this advantage globally. 
When we offer better value, unit sales 
increase signifi cantly. When we introduce 
product innovation with new launches like 
Innosense, Xpedior and a new Happyland 
toy range, our customers switch to us. And 
when we improve our in store experience 
our customers are delighted. These results, 
a year into our Transformation and Growth 
plan, have shown progress but there 
remains a lot to do and signifi cantly 
more opportunity ahead.

Overview
Space across both our UK and International 
businesses was down 1.8 per cent during 
the year with International space up 2.8 per 
cent at 2.3 million sq. ft. and the UK down 
7.2 per cent at 1.8 million sq. ft. Adjusting for 
Australia and New Zealand, where all 
74 stores (0.2 million sq. ft.) were closed 
during the year, total space was up 
3.4 per cent with International space 
up 13.5 per cent and UK space down 
7.2 per cent.
In January we announced that the directors 
of Mothercare Australia Limited, in which 
Mothercare plc (through its subsidiary 
Mothercare Finance Limited) had a minority 
23 per cent shareholding, had taken 
the decision to place the business into 
administration. Having assessed various 
potential strategies, the administrators 
decided to close the business. As a result 
all 74 stores in Australia and New Zealand 
have now been closed.
Group underlying profi t before tax was 
up at £8.3 million (FY2012: £1.6 million) 
with International profi ts up 20.3 per cent 
at £42.0 million (FY2012: £34.9 million), UK 
losses reduced to £21.7 million (FY2012: 
£24.7 million) and corporate expenses 
broadly fl at at £7.8 million (FY2012: 
£7.6 million). After exceptional items 
and other non-underlying charges of 
£29.8 million (FY2012: £104.5 million), the 
reported loss before tax was reduced to 
£21.5 million (FY2012: £102.9 million). These 
exceptional costs are: £15.6 million for UK 
property restructuring, £11.1 million for 
Australia, £4.3 million for onerous leases 
and £4.7 million for other restructuring costs.
We end the year with net debt of 
£32.4 million (FY2012: £20.1 million), which 
partly refl ects the investment in stock for 
new product lines across Clothing and 
Home & Travel. This is well within our 
committed banking facilities of £90 
million, which cover the life of our 
three-year plan and expire in May 
2015. No dividend has been declared 
for FY2013.

Our International business continues 
to deliver encouraging growth in terms 
of space and revenues, with profi ts 
up 20.3 per cent to £42.0 million.
International now trades from 2.3 million 
sq. ft., with 1,069 stores across 60 countries. 
During the year our International partners 
opened 115 stores and some, with our 
help, made further progress towards 
establishing multi-channel businesses. 
Our partners now have transactional 
online sites in Indonesia, Ireland, Kuwait 
and two in Russia for both Early Learning 
Centre and Mothercare. In addition, our 
partner in China has a transactional site 
on TMall, the largest online trading 
platform in China, and will in time have 
its own online platform. We now have 
a global e-commerce platform in place, 
which will be rolled out to help our 
franchise partners develop their 
multi-channel strategies. The growth 
opportunities in our newer markets is 
clear, but even our longer established 
markets are benefi ting from the trend 
of moving to larger units whilst also 
establishing multi-channel offers 
ahead of other retailers in the region.
Our continuing International business 
is impacted by an ongoing weaker 
performance from our Eurozone markets, 
which has been offset by a stronger 
performance from our Eastern European 
markets, particularly Russia. All four of 
our regions saw positive growth in both 
like-for-like and retail sales. Despite the 
negative contribution from our Eurozone 
markets, International saw like-for-like 
sales growth of 5.6 per cent.
Europe is still our largest market with 
433 stores in 28 countries. A net 24 stores 
were opened and space grew by 
4.4 per cent, which indicates that this 
region still continues to see growth 
opportunities despite the continuing 
Eurozone challenges.
The Middle East and Africa is our oldest 
region and has 309 stores in 14 countries. 
A net 19 stores were opened and space 
grew by 15.9 per cent, refl ecting the 
ongoing transition to larger stores as the 
business matures. This increase in space 
means our franchise partners in these 
markets are taking advantage of a 
greater proportion of our product offering 
to increasingly become the one-stop-shop 
for mums in these markets. 18	 Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Asia remains a high growth market with 
290 stores across 12 countries. India and 
China continue to deliver rapid growth 
and our partners in the region, excluding 
Australia and New Zealand, opened 46 
stores and increased space by 23.7 per 
cent during the year. The year also saw 
the closure of all 74 stores in Australia 
and New Zealand as Mothercare 
Australia Limited was put into 
administration by its directors.
Latin America now has 37 stores in six 
countries. It is early days with some  
new partners here but the results so  
far are very encouraging. We have  
also identified great quality potential 
new partners for further roll-out in the 
region and have confidence in the 
opportunity ahead.
Total International sales were up 8.4 per 
cent at £728.7 million (FY2012: £672.4 million) 
with International Wholesale sales up 11.6 
per cent at £7.7 million (FY2012: £6.9 million) 
and International Retail sales up 8.3 per 
cent at £721.0 million (FY2012: £665.5 million). 
Reported International sales of £249.7 million 
were down 1.2 per cent during the year.
On a comparable basis, total International 
sales were up 15.0 per cent in constant 
currency for the year, whilst in sterling 
terms revenues were up 11.8 per cent.
International profit growth has remained 
robust at 20.3 per cent to £42.0 million 
(FY2012: £34.9 million) with retail profits  
of £43.4 million (FY2012: £38.1 million)  
and joint venture losses reduced to  
£1.4 million (FY2012: loss of £3.2 million).
Our International results are testament 
to the hard work and knowledge 
offered by our International team and 
the strength of the relationships they 
have with our franchise partners. 
We work closely with all our partners 
who offer invaluable local knowledge 
and expertise. They help us leverage 
the benefits that our brands and 
products offer. I am pleased to say  
that we continue to see good growth 
opportunities across all our regions.

Underlying loss (£21.7m) (£24.7m) +12.1%
Against the backdrop of continuing 
pressure on the UK consumer, we are 
making progress towards reducing 
losses in the UK. Over the last 12 months 
we have closed 56 loss-making stores, 
refurbished our Edmonton, Nottingham 
and Dudley stores, improved value 
across Clothing and Home & Travel, 
introduced new and innovative product 
like Innosense, Xpedior and extended 
the range of Happyland toy characters, 
relaunched our online platform and 
invested in service. These initiatives are 
beginning to have a beneficial impact 
and we will build on these themes over 
the years ahead.
We have, over the last year, reduced  
our UK footprint by 7.2% and now 
operate from 1.8 million sq. ft. with 255 
stores (196 Mothercare and 59 Early  
Learning Centre). We closed 56 stores 
(13 Mothercare and 43 Early Learning 
Centre), ahead of our target of circa 50, 
as we were able to negotiate deals with 
our landlords while also closing stores 
as their leases came up for renewal.
As expected these store closures have 
impacted UK sales, which were down 
10.8 per cent at £499.7 million (FY2012: 
£560.0 million). On a comparable basis 
total UK sales were down 9.2 per cent.  
This decline in store-based sales was 
mitigated by the improvement in Direct 
in Home sales of £93.8 million, up 2.3 per 
cent on a statutory basis and up 4.0 per 
cent on a comparable basis. The migration 
to a new online platform together with 
the improvement in navigation, content 
and delivery options has delivered 
good results, but there is more to do.
In May 2013, we made ‘click and collect’ 
available through all our Mothercare 
stores. This service is free and allows 
customers to order from home and 
collect from any Mothercare store the 
very next day, and makes up circa 20 
per cent of Direct in Home sales. Our 
iPhone Mobile App, which we launched 
at the end of November 2012, has been 
downloaded circa 140,000 times and 
was voted ‘Best Mobile App 2013’ by 
Mobile Retail Awards. We will also be 
launching an Android App to further 
help our customers access our products 
in the most convenient way to them. We 
are becoming more competitive online 
and offering the services that many 
other businesses have been doing for 
some time. Whilst our Direct in Home 
sales have responded well to the 
improvements we have made during 
the last year, Direct in Store sales have 
been disappointing and at £33.9 million 
were down 11.5 per cent. This is an area 
that we will be focusing on during the 
year ahead. Together, total Direct sales 
were down 1.8 per cent at £127.7 million. 
UK Wholesale sales of £31.5 million were 
up 0.6 per cent. Miniclub, our partnership 
with Boots, continues to perform well 
and we are beginning to make progress 
towards extending the Early Learning 
Centre range as a Wholesale offer 
where appropriate.
We have refurbished some of our larger 
stores and have gained real insight into 
what works for our customers and we 
will use these insights as we continue  	 Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2013 19

to reshape our store portfolio. Building 
on our experiences from last year, we 
have just completed refurbishing Leeds 
and plan at least a further two stores  
in the year ahead. A year since the 
investment in our Edmonton store, 
customers are reacting well as it is  
still performing ahead of the rest  
of the store portfolio.
We have made good progress with 
Clothing, reducing overall pricing by  
low double-digit per cent for two 
successive seasons now. We launched 
the Value range, for AW12, which sold 
out soon after it was launched and 
prompted reordering of product for  
the first time in several years. We 
increased both the range and volume 
for SS13 such that our Value range now 
makes up circa 20 per cent of the Clothing 
ranges. We relaunched ‘Blooming 
Marvellous’ for AW12 offering our 
customers better maternity quality, 
fashion and value and have seen 
reduced levels of markdown. At the 
premium end of our Clothing range,  
we launched ‘Little Bird’ by Jools  
Oliver, which complements ‘Baby K’  
by Myleene Klass.
Home & Travel is the more challenging  
of our product categories. Third-party 
branded product makes up approximately 
50 per cent of the range and so is more 
exposed to competitive pricing pressure. 
Our work with key brands and price 
matching has improved our price 
perception on these products, but we 
aim to move the sales mix towards our 
own-brand ranges. We have started  
the process by introducing new and 
innovative own-brand products that are 
relevant to our customers. This will also  20	 Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2013 20 20 Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Mothercare plc Annual report and accounts 2013

help us re-establish our credentials as 
the leading mother and baby specialist 
in the UK. In January we launched 
Innosense, a complete feeding range 
with 47 SKUs, 21 of which were newly 
designed. Key items include a breast 
pump with three adjustable positions, 
a wide-neck bottle with an off-centre 
teat and clever stacking design of the 
lozenge shaped steriliser. In March 2013 
we launched the Xpedior our own-
brand pram and pushchair travel system, 
which at £250 is very competitively 
priced. It complements the Orb, which 
was launched in November last year. 
This is just the beginning and we aim 
to continue the good work started over 
the last 12 months.
Our Early Learning Centre range has 
also been improved. Early Learning 
Centre is synonymous with learning and 
our AW12 ranges saw a complete refresh 
with many new products focusing on 3D 
playing aimed at encouraging fi ne 
motor skills and hand-eye coordination. 
Innovation and newness, particularly in 
own-brand, have been a key area of 
focus. New product accounted for over 
30 per cent of our own brand ranges for 
AW12 and SS13. In addition, the relaunch 
of our Happyland toy characters 
making them collectable items for 
children at affordable prices has also 
delivered good results.
Our customers want more than great 
product at great prices. They want 
better service and they also want us to 
engage more frequently with them. 
We have extended our customer survey 
to Direct and so are able to build a 
complete picture of how our customers 
view us both in store and online. Earlier 
this year we were an offi cial partner 
of the highly successful Channel 4 
series ‘One Born Every Minute’ with 
an average of 3.4 million viewers per 
episode, many of whom were either 
looking forward to a birth or had 
welcomed a baby into their families 
in the previous 12 months. Our weekly 
Twitter parties during the show offered 
customers the opportunity to get advice 
from our expert midwife and proved 
very popular. We are also engaging 
more readily with opinion-forming groups 
and last month, in April 2013, I held my 
fi rst direct Q&A session with Mumsnet.
Whilst we still have a long way to go, 
I am encouraged by the progress we 
have made in the UK over the last year. 
We are taking positive action by closing 
loss-making stores, driving effi ciency 
across the organisation, creating more 
excitement in store and making step 
changes in our product ranges and 
architecture. We are laying the foundation 
for a stronger, more relevant and more 
responsive business for our customers.
Summary	and	outlook
My fi rst year as Chief Executive of 
Mothercare has been both exciting 
and challenging. I have overseen the 
fi rst steps towards returning Mothercare 
to its rightful position as the leading 
multi-channel mother and baby 
specialist both in the UK and across 
all our 60 International markets. 
Importantly, with a full executive team 
now in place, I can look forward to 
building on the progress made over 
the last 12 months. I am also pleased 
to announce my new arrival, Nieve 
Elizabeth, who came into the world 
in December and is already a great 
tester for all our new innovations.

Retail
71% of revenue (2012: 68%); generated from 206 mainline 
stores, 214 concessions within department stores, digital 
commerce and 49 outlets. 
 · Retail sales increased by 12% on an underlying  
and reported FX basis.
 · Comparable store sales increased by 5%  
(H1: 3%; H2: 7%).
 · New space contributed the balance of growth (7%). 
 · Average retail selling space increased by 13%  
(2012: 14% excluding China acquisition).
During FY 2013, retail trading was uneven, with comparable 
store sales growth of 6%, 1%, 6% and 8% by quarter, achieved 
against double-digit growth throughout the previous year.
Product, marketing and customer service initiatives drove 
strong performance in the second half festive periods 
including Christmas and Chinese New Year. Digital was 
further optimised, with innovative marketing and monthly 
global messages leveraged and synchronised online and 
offline, responding to rapidly changing consumer behaviour.
Overall, store traffic was soft, offset by increased 
conversion rates and higher average transaction values. 
Online traffic and conversion were up significantly.
With continued focus on the execution of proven retail 
strategies, the drivers of growth were consistent with 
previous years.
 · Outerwear and large leather goods remained at about 
half of mainline revenue.
 · Replenishment remained at about half of mainline revenue.
 · Burberry Prorsum and London penetration increased  
by four percentage points to reach 49% of mainline 
apparel revenue.
 · Mens and men’s accessories accounted for over half  
the growth in mainline revenue.
There was positive comparable store sales growth  
in all four regions during the year.
Asia Pacific
Nearly 90% of Asia Pacific revenue came from retail. China 
and Hong Kong both delivered double-digit comparable 
store sales growth in the year, while Korea remained weak. 
A net seven stores were opened in the region, focused on 
upgrading the store portfolio in China and in flagship markets 
including Hong Kong, with new stores in Pacific Place and 
Russell Street. 
Europe
Retail accounted for nearly 70% of Europe revenue. Following 
a strong first quarter, comparable store sales growth was 
broadly unchanged for the remainder of the period. France 
and Germany were robust and Italy remained weak. The 
United Kingdom, Burberry’s home market, accounted for 
over 40% of Europe retail revenue and delivered good 
overall growth, driven by the investment in London stores 
(Regent Street and Knightsbridge mens).
New store openings were largely in flagship markets, 
including London, Milan and Rome, which typically benefit 
more from travelling luxury customers.
Americas
About two-thirds of Americas revenue came from retail. 
Low single-digit comparable store sales growth in the  
year was weighted towards the second half. Approaching 
10% of Americas retail revenue came from outside the 
United States, with five stores in Canada, seven in Brazil 
and two in Mexico at the year end. 
Store openings included the rebuilt Chicago flagship,  
a further store in San Francisco and four openings in Brazil.
Rest of World
Retail accounted for nearly 60% of revenue for Rest of World, 
with 30 stores at the year end (23 in the Middle East  
and seven in India). Although uneven, high single-digit 
comparable store sales growth was achieved in the year, 
led by India. 
55
Financial Review Wholesale 
24% of revenue (2012: 26%); generated from sales  
to department stores, multi-brand specialty accounts,  
65 franchise stores and Travel Retail. 
 · Wholesale revenue increased by 1% underlying  
(down 1% at reported FX).
 · H1: up 5% underlying; H2: down 3% underlying  
as guided.
 · Growth in North America, Asia Travel Retail  
and emerging markets offset by continued planned  
account and product rationalisation.
 · Outerwear and mens outperformed other products.
Asia Pacific
Good growth was achieved during the year in Travel Retail, 
despite weakness in Korea. 
Europe
Europe remains the Group’s largest wholesale region at 
nearly 40% of wholesale revenue. Revenue was impacted 
by weak demand from domestic customers, especially in 
Italy, coupled with continuing planned rationalisation of 
small specialty accounts for brand and credit reasons.
Americas
The Americas is about one-third of Group wholesale 
revenue. Sales to North American department store 
customers again performed strongly, despite the greater 
impact of withdrawing entry price point products in core 
accessories and outerwear than in other regions.  
There was a further expansion of dedicated shop-in-shops  
during the year, reflecting brand segmentation initiatives 
with key customers. 
Rest of World
Wholesale revenue in Rest of World, which is mainly  
to franchise partners, saw good growth. 
At the year end, Burberry had 65 franchise stores,  
a net increase of eight during the year, including  
in Jordan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Estonia and Georgia. 
 
Licensing 
5% of revenue (2012: 6%); of which just over 60% is from 
Japan (split roughly 85% apparel and 15% from three 
remaining short-term accessories licences), with the 
balance from global product licences (fragrance, eyewear 
and watches) and European wholesale childrens. 
 · Licensing revenue down 1% on an underlying basis  
(up 1% at reported FX).
 · Consistent with full year guidance.
 · Fragrance and beauty taken in-house from 1 April 2013.
At constant exchange rates, royalty income from Japan  
was down compared to last year. Income from the apparel 
licence, which expires in June 2015, increased slightly, 
reflecting higher minimum payments, offset by the planned 
termination and downsizing of the remaining short-term 
accessories licences in Japan.
Global product licences delivered double-digit percentage 
growth. Product launches included Body Tender fragrance, 
the Aviator and Splash sunglasses collections and  
The Britain watch, starting the realignment of Burberry 
watches with the brand’s luxury positioning. 
Burberry began directly operating fragrance and beauty 
from 1 April 2013. The royalty revenue (£27m in FY 2013) 
from this product category will no longer be received.

Financial Review On 8% revenue growth, retail/wholesale adjusted operating 
profit increased 17% to £335.6m, resulting in a 140 basis 
point improvement in operating margin to 17.8%. This 
included a £12m benefit from a lower performance-related 
pay charge, due in part to the external environment being 
more challenging than budgeted. Without this benefit, 
adjusted operating margin would have been 17.1% compared 
to 16.4% in FY 2012. 
Gross margin increased by 250 basis points, driven by 
modest price increases, FX benefits on sourcing, improved 
inventory management and the mix shift to retail. 
The operating expenses to revenue ratio increased by 110 
basis points, driven in part by the shift to retail. Of the £94m 
increase, over half related to net new space. Spending by 
the largest corporate functions (marketing, IT, product  
and design) was tightly controlled, falling marginally as  
a percentage of sales, funding further investment in areas 
including digital.

Termination of licence relationship (82.9) –
Restructuring credit 0.6 –
China put option liability  
finance credit/(charge) 5.2 (10.2)
(77.1) (10.2)
During the year, £82.9m has been recognised as an 
exceptional item relating to the termination of the  
fragrance and beauty licence relationship. 
 · Of the Euro 181m termination payment, £70.9m has been 
capitalised as an intangible asset and will be amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the period 1 April 2013 to  
31 December 2017. This intangible asset relates to the 
present value of the anticipated incremental income from 
fragrance and beauty which will be earned by the Group 
up to 31 December 2017. The annual amortisation charge 
is expected to be £15m.
 · The remaining £71.3m has been recognised as  
an expense, together with related costs of £2.7m.  
It is anticipated that this value will be recovered through 
increased income from fragrance and beauty beyond  
31 December 2017.
 · Set up costs of £8.9m were incurred during the second 
half of the year as Burberry prepared for the transition  
to direct control. These included marketing, product 
registration and headcount costs.
The restructuring credit of £0.6m relates to the release  
of a provision held in respect of the cost efficiency 
programme announced in January 2009.
The China put option liability finance credit/(charge) relates 
to fair value movements on the put option liability over the 
non-controlling interest in the acquired Chinese business. 
The credit in the full year was £5.2m (2012: £10.2m charge).
Taxation 
In FY 2013, Burberry had a tax charge of £91.5m  
(2012: £100.6m), giving a tax rate on adjusted profit  
of 25.8% (2012: 26.7%). Tax on exceptional items has  
been recognised as appropriate. The resulting effective  
tax rate on reported profit is 26.1% (2012: 27.5%).
The tax rate on adjusted profit for FY 2014 is currently 
expected to be about 25%.
Net cashflow 
Cash inflow from operations was £523m, an increase of 
£40m over last year. This funded significant investment 
during the year, with capital expenditure of £176m  
(2012: £153m) and £144m to terminate the fragrance  
and beauty licence relationship. Other major outflows  
were dividends (£114m) and tax (£99m). Net cash at  
31 March 2013 was £297m (2012: £338m).
Inventory at 31 March 2013 was £351m. Excluding Beauty 
(£9m), this was a 7% increase year-on-year at constant 
exchange rates, compared to 12% retail sales growth.

Financial Review Outlook 
Retail
In the year to 31 March 2014, Burberry plans to open  
about 25 mainline stores and close about 15, while opening 
about ten concessions and closing about the same number. 
Openings are biased towards the evolution of the portfolio  
in China and further expansion in Latin America. Following 
two years of above average space growth, net new openings 
are planned to contribute low to mid single-digit percentage 
growth to retail revenue in FY 2014.
Wholesale
Excluding Beauty, Burberry expects underlying wholesale 
revenue to decrease by about 10% in the six months to  
30 September 2013 (2012: £253m). Wholesale customers 
globally planned more conservatively for Autumn/Winter 
2013 and there is a continuing impact from Burberry’s 
strategic rationalisation of wholesale accounts (particularly 
in Europe) and entry price products (particularly in  
North America). 
In addition, and as previously guided, with Burberry directly 
operating Beauty from 1 April 2013, wholesale revenue of 
about £140m and incremental retail/wholesale operating 
profit of around £25m is still expected in FY 2014. This will 
be weighted towards the second half, reflecting the impact 
in the first half of the move from licence to direct operation.
Licensing
In the year to 31 March 2013, licensing revenue, excluding 
£27m royalty income from fragrance and beauty, was £82m.  
In the year to 31 March 2014, Burberry expects growth from 
this level to be slightly positive at constant exchange rates  
and broadly unchanged at reported exchange rates, with  
the difference in growth rates largely reflecting the impact  
of the Japanese Yen hedge rate. 
In FY 2014, royalty income from Japan is expected  
to be broadly unchanged at constant exchange rates  
year-on-year, with higher minimum payments from the 
apparel licence offset by ongoing rationalisation of the  
three remaining accessories licences. The two global 
product licences (watches and eyewear) are expected  
to deliver double-digit percentage growth.
Retail/wholesale profit
For FY 2014, the aim is to modestly increase on the 
operating margin achieved in FY 2013, which was 17.1% 
without the £12m benefit of a lower performance-related  
pay charge. Reflecting the evolution and phasing of the 
business, adjusted PBT for the six months to 30 September 
2013 is currently expected to be below the level of the prior 
year (£173m):
 · Revenue continues to be weighted to the second half.
 · First half wholesale revenue, excluding Beauty,  
expected to be down 10% underlying, as guided.
 · H1 2012 benefited from a £15m lower performance-
related pay charge, as previously disclosed.
 · Beauty is expected to be dilutive in H1 2013, reflecting  
the short-term impact of the transition to direct operation.

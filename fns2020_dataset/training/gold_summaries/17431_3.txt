THE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Overview
It is a pleasure to report good results for Wyndeham for the year to 31 March 2005.  The strong start to the year, 
that we announced at the interim stage in November 2004, was maintained during the second half of the year 
and this performance reﬂects good progress despite the absence of any improvement in market and economic 
conditions and the well publicised increase in energy costs.
The Group’s improvement in performance is in part a direct result of corporate action taken both during 2003 and 
2004.  Of particular relevance was the successful integration of Graphic Facilities, which won the pre press company 
of the year award, acquired a year ago and the success of our new centralised sales operation.  Wyndeham has 
continued to invest in state-of-the-art technology and as a result has beneﬁted from new contract wins. 
Results and Dividend  
Group turnover increased 14% to £141.3m (2004: £123.6m) and proﬁt before tax, exceptional items and amortisation 
of goodwill increased substantially by 70% to £7.5m (2004: £4.4m),  continuing the improvement achieved in 
2004.
In recognition of the long term strategy for growth and the overall improvement in margins throughout the Group 
the Board is recommending a 10% increase in the ﬁnal dividend to 3.03p (2004: 2.75p).  Subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM the ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 31 August 2005 to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 5 August 2005.
The increase in ﬁnal dividend, if approved, will result in a total dividend for the year of 4.68p (2004: 4.25p) which 
is covered 1.4 times (2004: 0.7 times) by earnings.
The Group continues to be cash generative and net debt has fallen to £28.2m.  Interest cover has risen to 3.8 times 
(2004: 2.2 times).
Board and Employees
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our staff for all their efforts during the year.
Just after the period under review, on 1 April 2005, the Board announced the appointment of Paul Utting as Chief 
Executive.  Having joined Wyndeham as Group Managing Director in October 2003 from St. Ives PLC, Paul has 
had a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial impact on the Group driving the restructuring forward successfully.  His considerable 
contribution has been recognised by the Board and his appointment to Chief Executive is much deserved.
To support Paul in his new role as Chief Executive, I have agreed to continue as Chairman. 
Additionally, Roy Kingston who joined Wyndeham from St. Ives PLC shortly after Paul Utting has also made a 
signiﬁcant contribution to the Group as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer.  He continues to bring new operating techniques 
and ideas to the Group which are having a beneﬁcial impact on improving efﬁciencies.
Current Trading and Prospects
The current structure of Wyndeham has been established following careful analysis of the needs of our markets 
and considerable change has already been implemented to arrive at this position.  Wyndeham is now more efﬁcient 
and is now set to beneﬁt from the reorganisation of the business.
To drive Wyndeham’s growth in 2005 and beyond, the Board has been strengthened, supported by a very able 
management team and our new integrated offering is set to reap further rewards for our customers.
The installation of the second 64 page press at Wyndeham Heron is on track and on budget.  The press will have a 
good base load of new work, following contract wins, when it comes on line in September this year.
In 2005 Wyndeham has started to show the beneﬁts of the changes undergone in previous years.  Despite ongoing 
challenging conditions the Board is cautiously optimistic of further progress this year and thereafter.

 4       Pure Wafer plc   Annual report and financial statements 2013
Operational review
The	much	improved	financial	performance	for	the	year	to	30	
June	 2013	 demonstrates	 significant	progress	 has	 been	 achieved	
by Pure Wafer with further increases in revenue, EBITDA and 
a	 substantial	 return	 to	 pre-tax	 profitability.	 The	 period	 also	
presented Pure Wafer with the challenge of reclaiming record 
volumes of wafers both in Swansea and Prescott as the global 
semiconductor industry continued to grow.
Volume sales for the Group grew during the period, with 
300mm wafer reclaim up by 21% compared to the prior 
year.  Encouragingly, the second half of the year showed 
even stronger growth with 300mm volumes increasing a 
further	 7%	 over	 the	 first	 half,	 demonstrating	 a	 continuing	
growth pattern. Such increases in volumes in themselves 
present a real challenge to the operational teams in Swansea 
and Prescott. However, when coupled with industry analysts 
forecasting continued growth through 2015 and beyond, this 
would undoubtedly put a strain on our existing manufacturing 
capacities. 
Pure Wafer’s operations are currently running at high levels of 
utilisation, and whilst current demand can be accommodated 
within the existing facilities in Swansea and Prescott, forecast 
demand will exceed current capacity. Pure Wafer’s Board has 
therefore agreed a capital investment programme to increase 
300mm capacity by up to 40% across both manufacturing sites 
both to supplement the existing 300mm production lines and 
to enable us to meet continued and foreseeable demand. This 
additional capacity will be installed and partly utilised during 
the year ended 30 June 2014.
Following	 the	 successful	 Share	 Placing	 and	 Open	 Offer	 in	
November 2012 enabling Group debt to be substantially 
reduced and allowing the successful re-banking of our facilities 
at commercially competitive rates, Pure Wafer will be funding 
the capital expenditure for the increased capacity programme 
from our own cash generation.
Once	again	our	operational	teams	met	the	significant	challenge	
of achieving increasing volumes whilst maintaining the cost 
reductions	and	benefits	gained	during	prior	periods,	not	least	
against a market backdrop where our major suppliers were 
seeking price increases for the majority of our consumable 
items.  I am therefore very pleased to report that we were able 
to build on our past successes and reduce costs per wafer 
even	further	which	fell	by	4%	compared	with	the	prior	financial	
year.  These cost savings were in part a result of economies of 
scale as well as successful engineering innovations introduced 
to reduce consumables usage and costs within our processes, 
all	without	affecting	the	quality	of	the	Group’s	product	offering.
As volumes increased our operational teams processed them 
with	 only	 a	 modest	 increase	 in	 headcount.	 	 Pure	 Wafer	 benefited	
from	 these	 cost	 efficiencies	 as	 record	 levels	 of	 productivity	
were once again achieved in both the Swansea and Prescott 
facilities.  I would like to thank all of our employees throughout 
the Group for their hard work and support during the year, 
enabling Pure Wafer to continue to trade competitively and 
profitably	throughout	this	period.
Highlights
• Sales volumes have seen continued growth 
- 300mm up by 21% when compared to prior year 
- Strong increases in volumes in the 2nd half over  
  1st half
• Cost reductions continued leading to 4% reduction in 
cost per unit compared to prior year
• Record levels of productivity at both Swansea and 
Prescott sites
• Business now with low cost of manufacture, in a 
growing	market,	with	significant	installed	capacity	and	
planned capacity increases

Market
With the world’s insatiable appetite for faster, multifunctional 
hand held devices, especially from the heavily populated new 
and emerging economies, industry analysts are forecasting 
continued growth through to 2015 and beyond. Our major 
customers have committed and completed substantial new 
investment in 300mm silicon chip manufacturing facilities 
amounting to tens of billions of US Dollars, demonstrating 
their	own	confidence	in	sustainable	market	growth.	These	new	
manufacturing facilities give rise to further, very substantial 
wafer reclaim opportunities both currently and in the future 
and	support	our	confidence	in	the	exciting	long	term	growth	
prospects for Pure Wafer and upon which our strategy of 
increasing capacity is based.
Solar PV
Trading in our solar division proved to be challenging during 
the	period.	The	UK	Government	once	again	changed	the	levels	
of	the	Government	backed	feed-in	tariff,	which	had	an	adverse	
effect	 on	 orders	 from	 domestic	 customers	 as	 returns	 were	
perceived to become less attractive.
The	 change	 in	 market	 dynamics	 together	 with	 the	 influx	 of	
Chinese	solar	panels	and	solar	cells	into	the	UK	and	European	
market at selling prices below manufacturing costs has resulted 
in many corporate casualties in the industry throughout 
Europe.	 During	 the	 period	 we	 therefore	 significantly	 scaled	
back the solar headcount and operations.
We have also re-focused our marketing towards commercial, 
industrial and local authority customers who have high power 
usage during the daytime and other installations with double 
digit returns on investment and this strategy has resulted in a 
large enquiry list with a successful conversion rate into orders.  
Outlook
With the Group’s current and proposed capacity for 300mm 
and smaller diameter wafers, our leading-edge facilities in 
Swansea and Prescott, Arizona, together wih some of the 
lowest production costs per wafer in the industry, a much 
strengthened	financial	position	and	a	positive	market	outlook,	
the	Board	firmly	believes	that	the	Company	is	well	placed	for	
future growth.

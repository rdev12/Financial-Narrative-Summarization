2014 Performance
Current trading, outlook and dividend
• T rading in the first eight weeks of 201 5 was broadly in-line  
with expectations; a lower than expected gross win margin  
in sports betting meant that average daily net revenue  
was down 12% year-on-year and up 6% versus Q4 2014 
• Board remains confident in the Group’s full year prospects
• Recommended final dividend of 1.89p per share, a 5% increase 
over the prior year making 3.78p per share for the full year –  
a 5% increase over 201 3

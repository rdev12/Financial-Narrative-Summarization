Welcome to GoldBridges Global Resources Plc 
//Strategic report
Goldbridges Global Resources Plc 
(LSE:GBGR) is an exploration and 
development company, which  
successfully listed on the standard  
segment of the London Stock  
Exchange in December 2014. 
The Company’s main asset is its 100% interest in the Sekisovskoye gold 
mine in North East Kazakhstan with reserves of 2.26Moz. The Company has a 
strategy to deliver transformational growth at Sekisovskoye, through its switch 
from open pit production, due to cease in Q3 2015, to the development of the 
underground mine, which has significantly higher gold grades. Gold poured  
is targeted to increase from the current 33,000oz achieved in 2014 to  
an annual production of over 100,000oz of gold by 2018. 
The mining contract for the Sekisovskoye mine is valid until 18 July 2020  
with an automatic contractual right to extend after this period. 
In addition to Sekisovskoye, the Company has been awarded the tender 
to conduct further testing at the site at Karasuyskoye ore fields and this 
is expected to lead to a sub-soil user licence in the near term. The site 
encompasses an area of approximately 198km
2,
 and geological data 
purchased by the Company indicates that there are several mineralised  
zones, with the potential to contain significant gold resources.
Throughout 2014, the Company worked on a Competent Persons Report 
(CPR), and the results of the findings were announced in November 2014,  
and the significant highlights are summarised in the mineral resources 
statement on page 12.
The Company’s principal shareholders, the Assaubayev family (through their 
investment vehicle African Resources Limited), have provided strong financial 
support and commitment to the current development of the Company. 
Significant equity placings were undertaken in the year, raising in excess  
of US$22.7m (after costs) and the family’s shareholding currently stands  
at 61.69%.

The Sekisovskoye deposit is the Company’s flagship 
asset and is located close to the village of Sekisovka, 
approximately 40km from the North East Kazakhstan 
regional capital, Ust Kamenogorsk. 
The mineral rights at Sekisovskoye are held by a 100% 
owned subsidiary of the Company, TOO Sekisovskoye, 
and the processing plant is held by the 100% owned 
subsidiary of the Company TOO Altai Ken-Bayitu.
The Sekisovskoye deposit was discovered in 1833 with 
surface mining taking place between 1833 and 1847, 
1932 to 1935, and 1943 to 1946. From 1975 to 1986,  
a range of exploration work was carried out and between 
1978 and 1982 “AltaiZoloto” of the Ministry of Non-Ferrous 
Industry, KazSSR, mined the oxidised area of the ore body.
In 2003, under Hambledon Mining’s ownership, further 
exploration work was undertaken and gold production 
from the mine and processing plant commenced in 2008. 
In 2008, about 15koz of gold were produced and this has 
broadly increased throughout the last seven years with 
almost 33koz of gold produced in 2014.
In 2014, the Company released the findings of the  
mining consultant, Venmyn Deloitte’s Competent  
Persons Report on the mine, which demonstrated  
JORC reserves of 2.26Moz, JORC resources of 5.14Moz  
and a solid underground mine development plan to 
increase production in excess of 100koz in 2018.
This is to be achieved by accessing higher grade 
reserves through the continued development of the 
underground mine and by increasing the processing 
plant’s throughput capacity from the current 850,000t pa 
to 1Mt pa.

In January 2015, the Company was awarded the tender 
to perform further confirmatory testing in order to gain 
the subsoil user licence to the Karasuyskoye Ore Fields. 
The final subsoil licence terms and conditions, including 
the new financial incentives now offered specifically to 
the Company through the state programme on forced 
industrial-innovative development (SFIID), are expected 
to be finalised in the near-term. These additional terms 
are expected to include investment incentives and tax 
reductions.
The geological data that the Company acquired indicates 
that there are several mineralised zones and leads the 
Company to believe that Karasuyskoye has the potential 
to contain significant gold resources. The Company plans 
to validate this geological data by twinning previous drill 
holes and undertaking additional metallurgical test work. 
This work will facilitate the preparation of an independent 
Competent Persons Report (CPR) to international 
standards, and the Company will work on this  
programme throughout 2015 to 2016.
On completion of the (CPR), the Company envisages 
progressing towards mining from the Karasuyskoye 
Ore Fields, primarily using cash generated from 
existing operations. There is also the potential to use 
the Company’s existing mining fleet, at Karasuyskoye, 
when Sekisovskoye progresses from open-pit to a solely 
underground operation.

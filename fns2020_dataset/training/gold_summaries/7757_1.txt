Business Review
“The turnaround in profitability of Ideal will 
be based on the business fundamentals 
that made it successful – retail 
entertainment, great products and 
customer service.” 
Chief Executive’s  
Review
The 2008 financial year witnessed a very 
challenging economic environment and sales 
fell by 2.0%. This is a disappointing 
performance given the optimism that existed 
through the first three quarters of 2008. At the 
end of the financial year, Fashion and Jewellery 
categories had declined with sales down 18% 
to £9.0m and 45% to £3.8m respectively. Home, 
Leisure, Health and Beauty remained broadly 
flat at £47.3m and Craft showed strong sales 
growth, up 23% to £21.0m.
Profitability declined during the year to a net loss of £13.2m: this 
includes an underlying trading loss of £4.0m and exceptional 
costs of £9.2m. The exceptional items include stock, doubtful 
debt and returns provision increases following policy review, 
costs associated with decisions made by previous management 
such as investments in IT systems not deemed to be wholly  
fit for purpose, impairment of goodwill associated with the 
acquisition of Superstore TV (since renamed Ideal Sourcing 
Limited) and costs associated with the aborted planned building 
of a new warehouse. They also include legal, professional  
and staff costs in the restructuring of the Board and Senior 
Management and ensuring that the business is appropriately 
structured for the future. Finally, they include the expected loss 
of deposits with Kaupthing, Singer and Friedlander.

Business Review
Market trends
TV shopping as a market continued to grow at c.3% during 
2008 (source: Electronic Retailers Association). The market is 
driven primarily by consumers gaining access to TV shopping 
channels as they switch over from analogue to digital television. 
We estimate that the size of the market is now approximately  
£1.4bn at retail sales value of which we have a share of 
approximately 6%. 
Our internet sales in 2008 were £22.7m. Our customer profile is 
predominantly in the age 50+ category, which in internet sales is 
the fastest growing consumer area of the market. We see this as 
a significant area of potential growth and a key part of our 
strategy is to reposition the business as a multi-channel retailer, 
rather than predominantly as a TV shopping company.
Craft is now the largest category at Ideal Shopping, representing 
26% of total product sales in 2008. The market for crafting in 
the UK exceeds £2bn and we see this as a major area of 
opportunity in a fragmented market place.
Operational review
During 2008 our Ideal World channel was launched on Freesat, 
thereby increasing our potential audience. Our Sky Vitality 
channel was also re-branded as Ideal World 2 and Ideal World 3 
was launched on Sky. Together with Freeview, Sky and Virgin 
Cable we now broadcast to approximately 23 million homes, 
representing 89% of all UK households.
The Ideal World and Create and Craft websites were 
re-launched in mid 2008. Both sites however will require  
further investment and operational focus to establish them  
as destination sites.
The introduction of new IT systems in 2007 caused significant 
operational problems throughout 2008. The systems fall short  
of the functionality required for the range of products that we 
offer and options, including possible replacement, are currently 
under consideration.
We have had success with a number of products during  
the year but have become over reliant on a small number  
of successful lines. More airtime has been given to products 
that sold well but this has resulted in a lack of variety in our 
scheduling. We have already started to address this, by 
expanding our branded range and broadening our categories.
We continue to recruit new customers to our TV channels  
and websites at the rate of almost 1000 new customers  
a day. 330,000 new customers were recruited in 2008,  
up 6% on 2007.

Brother 
sewing machine
Our Brother 
computerised sewing 
machine is both 
convenient and easy to 
use. As our customers 
look for ways of saving 
money, we demonstrate 
how even the most 
inexperienced sewing 
machine can customise 
clothing, spice up scatter 
cushions, and create 
off-the-catwalk inspired 
outfits in no time.
Fly Flots
The Italian brand of Fly Flot shoes have been 
developed with the specific aim of creating 
footwear that is stylish, comfortable and 
durable. Fly Flots have been with Ideal World 
since 2001 and continue to be one of our 
flagship brands.

Business Review
Chief Executive’s  
Review continued
To improve our poor customer service experience our call 
centre operation was moved back to the UK from India in 
October 2008. An automated phone ordering system was 
introduced in September 2008 and customer feedback has 
indicated that this is an unpopular initiative. As a result we have 
reintroduced the option of customer agents for call handling 
from March 2009. Improving service to customers will be a key 
focus of the management team in order to increase customer 
retention in 2009. For example, a revised process for handling 
new customers will be introduced in April 2009 and improved 
delivery times are expected from May 2009.
We have reviewed our sourcing strategies and logistics 
solutions. With regard to sourcing we are now minimising firm 
sale purchases and proactively working with suppliers on sale  
or return, direct dispatch and supplier held stock business 
models. This strategy reduced our reliance on Ideal Sourcing 
Limited and has reduced gross stock levels to £6.1m in  
February 2009 from £9.5m in February 2008.
By reducing stock levels we have been able to withdraw from  
a number of warehouse facilities and now operate from 3 sites 
compared to a maximum of 9 sites in 2008. Annualised cost 
savings from this are around £0.5m.
During 2009 we will work with our ‘final mile’ delivery carriers  
to improve delivery times and the overall customer experience. 
Throughout 2008, promotions offering free postage and 
packaging were consistently run to drive sales. In contrast, 
during 2009, free postage and packaging will be restricted as  
a promotional tool and consequently overall gross margins will 
show improvement.
In order to maximise profit, some overnight airtime is sold  
to third parties. During 2008, overnight Freeview airtime was 
sold to Smart TV Broadcasting but this arrangement ended in 
November 2008. A new contract with Game Network BV has 
been agreed to replace the Smart TV contract and this should 
begin in May 2009.
Future prospects
The scale of losses in 2008 has led to a re-evaluation of strategy 
and direction. We have restructured our Board and Senior 
Management team, and strategically we remain well placed to 
exploit the convergence of broadcast and online media. Our 
Create and Craft brand is showing exciting growth potential. 
To grow our business profitably we need to focus on the 
business qualities that initially made the Company successful: 
customer service, retail entertainment and excellent product.  
In doing this we will ensure that the Company operates with the 
appropriate controls and with a focus on cash management.

Business Review
We know that our customers want us to provide engaging  
and demonstrable products, exclusive deals and a convenient 
shopping experience across a range of price points. We have 
already introduced new branded products such as Sony, Apple, 
Ann Harvey, Littlewoods, Vitamix and Polti, and this activity  
will continue in 2009. We are also extending our gardening and 
food categories and trialling broadcasts with a number of other 
high street and catalogue retailers. This enables us to offer our 
customers extended ranges of branded products without 
stocking the products ourselves, thereby avoiding stock risk.
Our primary growth opportunity lies with the internet, and we 
will focus on driving our existing TV shopping audience to our 
websites, as well as employing other established marketing  
and e-commerce tools. As Ideal Shopping develops from a  
TV shopping business to being a multi-channel retailer, we  
will implement best practice home shopping strategies that 
maximise sales from all customer touch points, whilst at the 
same time reinforcing our brand values of family, friendship  
and fun.

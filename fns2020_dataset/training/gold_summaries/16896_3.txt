WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Overview
The year to 31 January 2012 was an excellent year during which 
we continued to exploit the potential of our brands, both in the UK 
and internationally. 
Sales for the year grew by 7 .6% to £7 4.0 million with all segments of the 
Group achieving year on year growth leading to an increase of 24% in 
operating proﬁt before exceptional items at £5.56 million.
Our Brand sales grew by 7 .3% to £57 .4 million with international sales 
growing strongly by 1 1% to £22.0 million. In our largest market, the UK, 
sales grew by 4.6% to £33.8 million. Our global licence income grew 
1 1%, led by Japan and our UK bed linen licensee.
Our UK manufacturing operations had another successful year with 
third party sales growing by 8.8% helped by international sales growth 
of 32% as existing customers developed their ranges and new 
customers were attracted by our innovative printing techniques. 
These results demonstrate further progress towards our vision of 
creating a highly proﬁtable international luxury brands group. We have 
built strong market positions in our core sectors of wallpaper and fabrics 
and our brands have stretched into lifestyle categories such as rugs, 
tableware and lighting through our worldwide licence partners.
Financials
Overall sales increased 7 .6% to £7 4.0 million (201 1: £68.8 million). The 
operating proﬁt for the year was up 24% to £5.56 million (201 1: £4.47 
million before an exceptional gain of £0.50 million from a loss of proﬁts 
claim). Proﬁt before tax grew 9.7% to £4.89 million (201 1: £4.46 million). 
The proﬁt after tax increased 26% to £3.83 million (201 1: £3.03 million).
Earnings per share were 6.76p (201 1: 5.36p) a growth of 26%.
The cash inﬂow from operating activities was £4.28 million (201 1: £4.26 
million), reﬂecting strong operating proﬁts partially offset by a continued 
signiﬁcant investment in new product. The Group’s net indebtedness at 
the year end reduced to £0.67 million (201 1: £1.82 million). 
Dividend
During the year, the Group has paid a ﬁnal dividend for the year to 
31 January 201 1 of 0.80p per share and an interim dividend of 0.20p 
per share. The Directors recommend the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 
1.00p per share (201 1: 0.80p) which will be payable on 10 August 2012 
to shareholders on the register on 13 July 2012. This brings the total 
dividend for the year to 1.20p per share (201 1: 0.95p) an increase of 26%. 
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of our management and 
employees for their contribution to an extremely successful year. 
Outlook
We remain focused on opportunities to develop our international 
business, where our brand assets and UK manufacturing base bring 
signiﬁcant potential to build on our strong position in established markets.
After three months of the current year Brand sales are 5% ahead of the 
same period last year. We are conﬁdent of delivering a positive outcome 
for the year.

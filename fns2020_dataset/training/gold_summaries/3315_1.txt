Chief Executive Officer’s Report
“I believe Chariot 
presents a real value 
add opportunity. 
Our Namibian 
acreage is a solid 
platform from which 
to develop, and over 
the coming years  
I believe that Chariot 
can grow from 
being a junior 
exploration 
company  
into a mid-tier E & P 
player with both 
exploration and 
production success.” 
Paul Welch 
Chief Executive Officer
I am very pleased to report on my first 
set of full year financial statements as 
CEO and I am delighted with the 
progress we have made since I joined 
Chariot. I am also honoured to be part  
of a company that I believe has the 
potential to deliver a great deal of value 
to shareholders and to put Namibia 
firmly on the oil producing map. I am 
pleased to recount our progress and look 
forward to continuing developments 
throughout the coming year. 
Progress to date 
Since our interim results, published in 
November 2009, we have completed 
all planned seismic acquisition 
programmes across our blocks of 
interest, the final programme in the 
Northern block concluded in January 
2010. Such acquisition programmes 
were extensive, in some licences 
significantly exceeding the requirements 
as agreed with the Namibian Ministry, 
providing a strong indication of our 
commitment to developing our assets. 
Due to our large acreage position and 
the substantial amount of newly 
acquired seismic data, we negotiated 
licence extensions for our blocks in the 
second quarter of last year in order to 
have the time to pursue our exploration 
efforts to the best of our ability. All of 
our licences are in good standing.
With the completion of the 2D 
acquisition and interpretation 
programme, we were very pleased to 
announce resource volumes for our 
Central blocks. Three new leads have 
been identified with 3.3 billion barrels 
of prospective resources. This increased 
our previous estimate of gross unrisked 
prospective resources by 62 per cent  
to 8.5 billion barrels (net prospective 
resources of 7.4 billion barrels) and 
underscored our belief in the oil 
potential of the Namibian margin. 
We announced in February the opening 
of a dataroom in London in order to 
seek out further farm-outs for our 
blocks of interest. Having partners 
alongside us will help to mitigate the risk 
and expedite our exploration activity. 
Since the dataroom opened, we have

COMPANY OVERVIEW
“I was delighted  
to welcome new 
technical staff to the 
Group; all of whom 
have worked in the 
industry for many 
years and whose 
experience is 
proving invaluable.  
I look forward to the 
coming year with 
confidence as we 
continue to deliver 
on our strategy  
and objectives.”
welcomed a number of interested 
international oil companies and we 
expect further visitors over the coming 
quarter. The expressions of interest have 
significantly increased from the visits to 
our first dataroom with parties keen to 
view the newly acquired 3D seismic 
information. As we have previously 
stated, this is a key part of our strategy 
as we look to secure industry partners 
to share in the costs and rewards of 
exploration going forward. We continue 
to liaise closely with Petrobras on block 
2714A in the south and look forward  
to working alongside other interested 
parties in due course.
Our new business opportunity 
evaluation efforts continue across  
the African continent as we seek out 
additional prospects. As previously 
stated, we are looking to balance  
our current portfolio with nearer  
term production potential in order to 
introduce production cash flows and 
reduce our risk profile. This process  
is ongoing using our in-house skills  
and expertise.
I was delighted to welcome new 
technical staff to the Group during the 
period: Matthew Taylor (Director  
of Exploration), Julia Kemper (Senior 
Staff Geophysicist), Martin Richards 
(Development Engineering Manager) 
and Alex Green (Commercial Manager), 
all of whom have worked in the industry 
for many years and their experience is 
proving invaluable.
Operating in Namibia
Namibia is a country that I am very 
familiar with from my earlier activities 
with Shell and Hunt Oil – both early 
entrants into the country. As well as the 
interesting geology that the offshore 
basins offer, Namibia is a superb place 
to do business. Namibia has recently 
celebrated the 20th anniversary of  
its independence and inaugurated 
President Hifikepunye Pohamba for a 
second five-year term. It has a stable 
democracy with a competitive fiscal 
regime and sound investment profile. 
The government has pursued free-
market principles designed to promote 
commercial development, has good 
relations with its neighbours, and 
actively encourages international foreign 
investment. We have an excellent 
working relationship with the Ministry  
of Mines and Energy and Namcor and  
it is a continuing pleasure to work there.
Chariot – the future
I believe Chariot presents a real value 
add opportunity. Our Namibian acreage 
is a solid platform from which to 
develop, and over the coming years  
I believe that Chariot can grow from 
being a junior exploration company  
into a mid-tier E & P player with both 
exploration and production success. 
Whilst securing new opportunities is  
a priority for us, our position offshore 
Namibia remains our key focus. The 
team that we have in place now is  
one that I am extremely pleased to  
be working with and I value their input 
immensely. We now possess the 
in-house skills to both further develop 
the Namibian potential and expand the 
business by acquiring additional assets. 
We believe that we have an enviable 
strategic position within one of the  
few remaining high impact exploration 
frontier regions off the West African 
coast. I relish the prospect of an  
exciting year ahead which will see 
significantly increased activity levels  
and I look forward to updating 
shareholders accordingly.

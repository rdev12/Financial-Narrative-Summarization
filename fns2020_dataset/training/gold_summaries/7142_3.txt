Financial Overview
For the 12 months to 31 December 2013, the Group made a pre-tax profit of £0.6m 
(2012: loss from continuing operations of £0.5m). This turn around to profit was as 
a result of improved gross margins, tighter cost control and lower interest charges. 
However, lower levels of activity in the educational sector resulted in Group revenues 
from continuing operations for the year reducing by 3% to £89.6m (2012: £92.5m).
 
Financial Position
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had net debt of £0.3m (2012: £2.4m). Shareholders’ 
funds increased to £20.5m (2012: £18.0m) resulting in gearing of less than 5% at the 
year end. During the year, as previously announced, we sold Fontana House for a total 
consideration of £1.1m. Fontana House is situated at Letchworth and is occupied by the 
Showcard Print business which we sold in April 2012. The proceeds from the sale of this 
property have further enabled us to reduce debt.
We were delighted to be able to invest £0.7m during the year in a new laser cutting 
machine for the factory which has enabled us to achieve significant productivity 
improvements.
Since 31 December 2009, the Group has reduced its finance facilities from £35m 
to £5.5m. Its bank facility, which has been finalised since the year end, is, with further 
agreed reductions, committed until April 2016.
 
Dividends
No dividend is proposed for this year. When the Group’s profitability has further 
improved, the Board will consider the resumption of dividend payments.

Future Strategy
We continue to focus on growing the Interiors business around four main sectors. 
Retail customers now account for 20% of our revenues; the improving sentiment 
in retail has allowed us to diversify our revenue streams and, encouragingly, gain some 
new customers which should bode well for the future. Financial services (mainly banks) 
accounted for 43% of our revenue in 2013 and this continues to be a significant area of 
business for us. Education, which has historically been a significant part of the Interiors 
business, has been subdued over the last year and accounted for 37% of our revenue in 
2013, but there are encouraging signs as evidenced by recently announced government 
spending plans. Finally, we are starting to build a presence in the healthcare market.
We are continuing to grow our overseas retail business and we expect that revenues from 
outside the UK, which amounted to 5% of 2013 revenue, will shortly exceed 10% of our income. 
We continue to concentrate on driving efficiencies through the business and enhancing 
our margins. We intend to support all of this through further investment and will continue 
to offer a full range of services including design, procurement and installation. 
The Board
I am pleased that Andrew Burgess agreed in November 2013 to join the Board as a 
non-executive director. Andrew is our largest shareholder and is committed to the future 
success of the business. He brings with him extensive commercial experience which will 
assist the Company as we look to take it to the next stage of its development.
I would also like to take this opportunity to formally record the Board’s thanks to all of 
our colleagues for their contributions to the improving health of the business. The last 
few years have not been easy and it is gratifying for all of us to be able to report these 
more positive results.
Outlook for 2014
The UK economy is showing signs of recovery and growth and I believe we are now 
well positioned to take advantage of this. Although we are a Scottish based business 
and many of our employees live in Scotland, we have a UK wide customer base and a 
number of overseas customers. It is hoped that the economic recovery (and with it, our 
growth prospects) that is currently taking place across the UK will not be destabilised 
by the outcome of the Referendum on Scottish Independence.
The retail sector in the UK is improving and there are positive signs of renewed consumer 
confidence; this is reflected in our new business wins. Recent announcements of increased 
government spending on education are also encouraging, the results of which will be seen 
in the business in 2015.
The Board is pleased with progress made in both debt reduction and the move into profit 
in 2013 and we look to the future with confidence.

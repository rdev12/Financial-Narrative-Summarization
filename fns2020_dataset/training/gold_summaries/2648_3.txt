 Chairman’s Statement
02 Business Direct Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2005
“We have seen an increase in new business and have added a number of new blue
chip customers to our client base.”
I am pleased with the progress made by the
group in the year as we begin to achieve critical
mass in our market. During 2005 we have
continued to expand the business, introducing
a number of new offerings to the field-engineers’
market. As a result we have seen an increase
in new business and have added a number
of new blue chip customers to our client base.
Acquisitions
During the year the opportunity arose to acquire
two businesses offering a range of services
complementary to our ParcelXchange intelligent
locker distribution system.
Concord
The acquisition of the business and assets
of four associated companies, Concord Couriers
Limited (“CCL”), Concord Logistics Limited
(“CLL”), Concord Welwyn Garden City Limited,
and the entire issued share capital of Bcomp
236 Limited (‘Concord’) were completed
in January 2005. This has enabled the group
to offer a full portfolio of service logistics
including field engineering, specialist logistics
and strategic warehousing to its existing and
new clients. The rationalisation and integration
of the Concord business is now complete.
The total cost of the Concord acquisitions
is expected to be £1.6 million over three years.
The bulk of this acquisition has been satisfied
in equity, with £266,482 incurred on pre acquisition
expenses and costs. The vendors are entitled
to an earn-out, based on achieving specific
revenue and profitability targets on the acquired
businesses. This is payable monthly up to
December 2007 and is projected at £108,000
with a cap of £360,000.
Esprit In Night Express
The business of Esprit In Night Express (“ANC”)
was acquired in March 2005. ANC’s business
delivers components directly to engineers’
vehicles. The acquisition has accelerated
Business Direct’s pace of growth and the
customers of ANC have the opportunity
to migrate to the ParcelXchange intelligent
locker solution in the future.
The total cost of the ANC acquisition is expected
to be £450,000. During the year £281,000
was paid with the balance payable monthly
through to April 2007, contingent upon
future performance.
Exceptional costs of £459,000 were incurred
during 2005 relating to the fundamental
restructuring of part of the group following
the acquisitions. This covered the rationalisation
of the group’s delivery network, locations
and management.

Financial review
Turnover for the year ended 31 December 2005
was £13.5 million (2004: £3.8 million) with gross
profit of £3.7 million (2004: £1.1 million).
The operating loss was £2.4 million (2004:
£1.0 million) and administrative expenses rose
to £6.2 million (2004: £2.2 million) following
the acquisitions. Operating losses have reduced
throughout the year as the acquisitions have
been integrated.
During the year the company raised an
additional £1.4 million through a placing
to assist with the roll out of ParcelXchanges
and to finance the investment made
in integrating the acquisitions.
During March 2006 the company secured
£1.7 million of additional banking facilities,
giving overall banking facilities of £4.5 million.
These will fund the roll out of further
ParcelXchanges and finance the additional
working capital needs of the business
as it continues to grow.
Outlook
The market in which we operate continues
to expand and the outlook for the next 12 months
is positive. Customers continue to look for cost
effective solutions to their distribution needs
and our range of products fulfils this criteria.
Trading in the first two months across the group
is in line with budget. We are confident that the
investments we have made in 2005 combined
with our clear market focus will stand us in good
stead in the next 12 months.
Finally, I would like to thank the staff for their
significant contribution over the year. Their
efforts have enabled the group to make the
considerable progress in the year.

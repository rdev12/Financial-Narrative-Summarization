 Chief Executive’s Review
04 Business Direct Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2005
The year got off to a busy start with the
acquisition of the Concord businesses
in January 2005; this was followed with
the acquisition of ANC in March 2005. Both
companies were fully integrated into the group
by August 2005. During the year we reviewed
our structure and now operate through three
divisions, providing our customers with a total
approach to their logistic requirements
and offering services that suit various budget
and operational requirements. The breakdown
of revenue by division is:
2005
£m
Turnover
ParcelXchange 4.8
Technical 2.3
Express 6.4
Total turnover 13.5
ParcelXchange (ParcelXchange and ANC)
This division provides services to clients that
have logistics issues with the expensive last mile
delivery; typically this would be a requirement
to distribute parts to field engineers. The group
provides an end to end service and charges
a rental fee for the ParcelXchange or per unit
fee for deliveries into engineers’ vehicles.
Daily sales within the division have grown
by 200% between January 2005 and December
2005, as shown below:
January June December 
2005 2005 2005
£8.8k £20.5k £26.7k
The ParcelXchanges currently operate at 39%
capacity each month up from 35% in 2004 with
1,200 lockers added in the year. At 31 December
2005 there were 279 ParcelXchange sites
located throughout the UK giving a total
of 3,900 (2004: 2,600) individual lockers.
This proliferation of sites along with our delivery
to vehicle offering enables us to provide our
customers with national coverage.
ParcelXchanges have been installed in Northern
Ireland and will be further expanded in 2006.
Technical (formerly CLL)
The Technical Division specialises in servicing
the field engineer market through a nationwide
network of technicians and forward stocking
locations. Focusing primarily on the computer
support sector the division is also carrying
out engineering and maintenance work
for our ParcelXchanges.
“The investments made in 2005 have put us in an excellent position to continue
to make progress.”

The services provided by the division are often
complementary to those offered to ParcelXchange
customers. It is often the case that those
customers who are looking for last mile engineer
delivery solutions also require technical mobile
engineer support and strategic stock holding
close to the point of use.
Express (formerly CCL)
The Express division provides our customers
with a range of distribution solutions. Principal
service offerings include National Next Day
Parcel Delivery, Same Day Urgent Deliveries
and International Shipping. Recently the
division has developed specialist computer
handling delivery solutions that focus on high
value deliveries.
Client acquisitions
We continue to make significant progress
in securing additional blue chip clients, attracted
by the broad range of solutions we are able
to offer. During the year we have continued
to promote our brand and within the market
we operate we are seen as an innovator and
market leader, offering higher value solutions
than our competitors through our use of
sophisticated IT solutions.
The number of clients using ParcelXchange
is currently 30 against 15 in January 2005,
an increase of 100%.
We have continued to invest in the direct
sales team during the year adding additional
sales and account managers. Wayne Crew,
who joined in 2005, was promoted to the
board on 20 February 2006 as Sales Director.
Estates department
In order to roll out further ParcelXchanges
we need to continue to develop a national
portfolio of available sites, we are making
excellent progress on this. We now have
four major site owners (two petrol forecourt
operators and two supermarkets) as business
partners which should provide us with the sites
we need in 2006.
Sales and cross selling
Following the acquisitions made during the year
the sales team has undergone comprehensive
training enabling them to sell the portfolio of
product offerings. The sales teams of Concord
and ANC have been merged with ParcelXchange.
Summary
The field engineer market is continually looking
for innovative solutions to the last mile delivery
problem. We are becoming widely recognised
as the business to bring these solutions
to the market. The investments made in 2005
have put us in an excellent position to continue
to make progress.

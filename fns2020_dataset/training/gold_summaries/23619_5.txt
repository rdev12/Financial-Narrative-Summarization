 RECONCILIATION OF 
CONSOLIDATED INCOME 
STATEMENT TO ADJUSTED RESULTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 
SEPTEMBER 30 2016
The directors believe that the adjusted proﬁt 
and earnings per share measures provide 
additional useful information for shareholders 
to evaluate the performance of the business. 
The group’s non-IFRS measures are intended 
to remove from reported earnings volatility 
associated with the following types of one-off 
income and charges:
Adjusted ﬁgures are presented before the 
impact of amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets (comprising trademarks and brands, 
databases and customer relationships), 
exceptional items, share of associates and joint 
ventures’ acquired intangibles amortisation, 
exceptional items and tax, and net movements 
in deferred consideration and acquisition 
commitments. In respect of earnings, adjusted 
amounts reﬂect a tax rate that includes the 
current tax effect of the goodwill and intangible 
assets. Many of the group’s acquisitions, 
particularly in the US, give rise to signiﬁcant 
tax savings as the amortisation of goodwill and 
intangible assets on acquisition is deductible 
for tax purposes. The group considers that the 
resulting adjusted effective tax rate is therefore 
more representative of its tax payable position. 
Further analysis of the adjusting items is 
presented in notes 5, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 14 to the 
group ﬁnancial statements.
The group has consistently applied this deﬁnition 
of adjusted measures as it has reported on its 
ﬁnancial performance in the past and it is the 
group’s intention to continue to consistently 
apply this deﬁnition in the future. 
UNDERLYING RESULTS
When assessing the performance of the group’s 
businesses, the board considers the adjusted 
results. The year-on-year change in adjusted 
results may not, however, be a fair like-for-like 
comparison as there are a number of factors 
which can inﬂuence growth rates but which do 
not reﬂect underlying performance.
When calculating underlying growth, 
adjustments are made to give a like-for-like 
comparison. For example, the adjusted results 
in 2016 beneﬁted from the strengthening of 
the US dollar relative to sterling. To calculate 
underlying growth, the comparatives are 
restated using 2016 exchange rates. Similarly, 
adjustments are made to exclude acquisitions 
and disposals from both years. The timing of 
events can also be a distortion. To give a fair 
like-for-like comparison when calculating 
underlying growth, biennial events are 
excluded from the year in which they were 
held.
The reconciliation below sets out the adjusted 
and underlying results of the group and 
the related adjustments to the statutory 
Income Statement that the directors consider 
necessary to provide useful information about 
the group’s trading performance.

Cash conversion % 102% 105%
Underlying cash conversion % 105% 104%
Cash conversion measures the percentage by which cash generated from operations covers adjusted operating proﬁt. The underlying basis is after 
adjusting for signiﬁcant timing differences affecting the movement in working capital and exceptional items. Exceptional items are the payments 
relating to the strategic review including one-off acquisition and integration costs, the major reorganisation of certain businesses and other professional 
fees relating to development of the group’s new strategy. The other working capital movements relate to the favourable effect of the rent-free period 
in the London ofﬁces. The 2015 underlying cash conversion has been restated for the impact of exceptional items.

Chief Executive’s review
I am very pleased with the trading results of the Group in 2011. On 
all measures of performance, whether it be sales and operating 
profit growth, profit margins, cash generation or order intake, the 
result has been very good.
It is gratifying to see the sales growth momentum in the business 
increasing in the second half of the year, reflecting continuing 
market improvements and the benefits of the active programme of 
capital investment, supported by a healthy pipeline of new product 
introductions. 
The Energy division had another excellent year in 2011. Order 
intake in the year was very good and continued to build through the 
period as the benefits of the competitiveness and energy efficiency 
of Brush Turbogenerators’ main product, the gas turbogenerator, 
produced good gains in market share. Significant capital investment 
continues to be made in both Brush’s new build and aftermarket 
facilities in order to increase capacity to meet projected demand 
and to achieve productivity gains. The absorption of Hawker 
Siddeley Switchgear into Brush will produce significant operational 
savings and in addition will result in a more targeted and focused 
sales function, given the customer overlap between Hawker 
Siddeley Switchgear and Brush Transformers. Marelli reported 
healthy increases in sales, orders and operating profit in the year, 
with a greater proportion of higher margin, more specialist business 
feeding through in the second half. The new plant in Malaysia is 
now operational and is an important step in reconfiguring Marelli’s 
manufacturing footprint.
In the Lifting division, Bridon performed creditably in 2011, 
underpinned by good demand in its onshore oil & gas and mining 
markets. In view of the favourable prospects in most of its markets, 
Bridon invested heavily in 2011, with capital expenditure of 
“On all measures of performance, 
whether it be sales and operating 
profit growth, profit margins, cash 
generation or order intake, the result 
has been very good.”

approximately £13 million (2.8 times depreciation). This, together 
with a strong commitment to new product development, is a key 
part of Bridon’s strategy to be the leading global solutions provider 
for high specification rope applications.
Crosby reported very strong results in 2011, nearly matching its 
record year in 2008, with good demand in its core oil & gas and 
mining markets, supported by its excellent relationships with its 
distributor base. In addition to its investment programme in the 
US to increase capacity and efficiency, Crosby continues to invest 
actively in its European and Chinese operations to enable it to take 
advantage of its market-leading brand name and the promising 
opportunities that have been identified in these markets.
In the Other Industrial division, the trading performance overall was 
satisfactory, reporting increased revenue and operating profit in the 
year. While Truth struggled in the face of challenging conditions in 
its markets, Harris performed well as demand for scrap recycling 
machines recovered in the year. MPC reported a strong trading 
performance as the results of its investment in the highly successful 
Range Rover Evoque programme started to come through.
OUTLOOK
Although conditions in the world economy remain uncertain, albeit 
with some signs of improvement, a large proportion of Melrose 
Group companies’ sales derive from good market positions in the 
global power generation, oil & gas and mining sectors which are 
forecast to remain strong.
The visibility and positive momentum of our order books, supported 
by an aggressive capital investment programme, together with a 
strong pipeline of new products, give us confidence for another 
good year in 2012.

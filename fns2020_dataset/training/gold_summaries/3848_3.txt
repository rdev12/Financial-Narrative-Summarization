Hot Tuna (International) PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The Directors of Hot Tuna (International) PLC have pleasure in presenting 
the Company and Group’s results for the year ended 30 June 2007. 
Over the last twelve months, we have made significant progress in re-establishing 
Hot Tuna as a leading global surf and youth lifestyle brand. Despite challenging 
market conditions and a particularly poor summer in 2007 resulting in sales 
for the period being lower than expectations, we are encouraged nonetheless 
by the fact that retail sales of surf and related products have climbed by over 
15% in the last two years and that this sector still remains one of the fastest growing 
sectors within the apparel industry. Surfing, today, is no longer seen as a ‘rebel’ 
pastime but another healthy fun sport and lifestyle that everyone can enjoy. 
We believe that our strategy to position Hot Tuna as a global surf and youth 
life style brand will benefit from this sector growth.
During the past twelve months, there have been many affirmations of 
the Company’s growing strength and presence in the industry including 
the addition of fashion entrepreneur and brand management leader, 
Elle Macpherson, to the Company’s Board of Directors. Also on 1 June 2007, 
we were privileged to be able to appoint Niels Juul as Chief Executive Officer. 
Niels joins us from the world renowned Von Dutch apparel business where 
he was Managing Director and within three months of joining the Company 
implemented clear leadership and direction that we believe will take Hot Tuna 
to the next level in our quest to rank shoulder-to-shoulder with the biggest names 
in surf fashion and youth lifestyle.
FUNDRAISING
As a result of the successful fundraising in December 2006, the Company 
has been able to expedite the strategic plan to improve the distribution and 
manufacturing process. The capital raising exercise generated £4.2m (before 
expenses) via a placing of 28,024,994 new ordinary shares of nominal value

£0.01p each, at £0.15p per share. These shares were issued together 
with warrants, in the ratio of one warrant for every two placing shares. 
In March 2007, the Group also agreed a maximum £2.5m equity-based credit 
facility with Cornell Capital Partners LLP. Cornell Capital Partners LLP also 
subscribed to convertible loan notes worth US$450,000. 
RESULTS SUMMARY
The Group operating loss for the year of £3.7m included employee costs of £1.5m 
(2006: £0.7m), production and manufacturing costs of £0.5m (2006: £0.1m) 
and marketing costs of £0.6m (2006: £0.1m). The high cash expenditure 
reflects the Group’s commitment to commissioning the right management 
and personnel to drive the Group into the next phase of its strategy. 
Hot Tuna has incurred approximately £2m of non-cash expenses up to 
30 June 2007, including £0.2m bad debt and inventory write-offs and £1.7m 
of exceptional share-based payment charges incurred in accordance with IFRS 2 
requirements and £0.1m outside equity interests were absorbed in recognition 
of the fact that these amounts would not be re-couped in the future. The 
share-based payments, which have been charged as an “exceptional item”, 
were incurred in order to appoint key personnel to the Hot Tuna team during 
the year. This charge does not affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends 
going forward nor does it affect the net assets of the Group. It is strictly 
a charge to reserves in accordance with current accounting standards. 
As at the 30 June 2007, the Group had cash reserves of £1.9m (2006: £1.5m) 
and a net current asset position of £2.2m (2006: £1.5m).
COLLEAGUES AND PARTNERS
On behalf of the Board I wish to thank my fellow Directors, our employees 
and our partners for their energy and commitment and to extend our sincere 
thanks to all of them for their hard work and dedication. We look forward to 
driving the business forward and taking the business of surf to new heights 
through the merits of Hot Tuna.

How we’ve delivered
We beat our original production guidance for the second 
consecutive year and delivered 1.28 Moz (2012: 1.06 Moz) 
of gold equivalent in 2013, up 21% year-on-year and 7% 
above original expectations. This robust achievement was 
driven by the successful ramp-up of our key growth 
projects, Amursk POX and Mayskoye, and exceptional 
operational delivery at the Dukat hub.

What sets us apart
Strong capital discipline 
As demonstrated in 2013, we are able to react dynamically  
to the changing market environment. This has allowed  
us to maintain free cash flow generation and sustain  
a significant dividend stream to our shareholders.
High-quality assets
Our high reserve grade supports relatively low cost profile  
and lower capital spending per ounce, which taken together 
drive better returns on invested capital and resilience  
to price shocks.

  The Company defines adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) as profit for the period 
adjusted for depreciation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, write-downs of inventory  
to net realisable value, share-based compensation, listing expenses, additional mining  
tax, penalties and accrued interest, income on disposal of subsidiaries, bargain purchase  
gains, foreign exchange gains/(losses), changes in fair value of derivatives, changes  
in fair value of contingent considerations, finance income, finance costs, and income  
tax expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.  
See Note 5 to the financial statements.

  Total cash costs comprise cost of sales of the operating assets (adjusted for depreciation 
expenses, rehabilitation expenses and write-downs of inventory to net realisable value)  
and general, administrative and selling expenses of the operating assets. Gold equivalent 
sales volume is calculated based on average realised metal prices in the relevant period. 
Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated as total cash costs divided  
by total gold equivalent unit ounces sold.

  Mineral resources and ore reserves are estimated in accordance with the JORC Code 
(2012). Mineral resources are additional to ore reserves.

Record production volume
Polymetal achieved an all-time record 
production volume with 
810 Koz
of gold equivalent. This strong performance 
was bolstered by: 
•	de-bottlenecking of the Omsukchan 
concentrator (Dukat hub);
•	the expansion of the Kubaka plant; and 
•	mining and processing commencing  
at Albazino.
Premium listing on the LSE
Polymetal was admitted to the London  
Stock Exchange in November and included 
in FTSE 100 listing.
Strong operational performance
Metal sales for the full year exceeded 
production for both gold and silver.  
Polymetal produced
 1, 063 Koz
of total gold equivalent, up 31% compared to 
2011 and exceeding original guidance by 6%. 
Resource base increased
There was a dramatic increase in the resource 
base at Albazino. Successful exploration  
has also identified potential new growth 
assets at Kutyn and Svetloye. As a result,  
total gold equivalent resources grew by 35%.
Increased dividend pay-out 
Polymetal’s inaugural dividend payment,  
in respect of 2011, was made in June 2012.  
A new dividend policy was adopted,  
raising the payout ratio to 30% and 
introducing an annual consideration  
of special dividends in order to ensure  
value is delivered to shareholders.
Mayskoye mine started  
and ramped up
The Mayskoye plant was started up in April 
and achieved design capacity by Q4. This 
marked the completion of a major investment 
cycle to bring the second generation of assets 
into production, and the first 48 Koz of gold 
were sold to off-takers.
New dividend policy in action
A total of US$0.82 per share was paid  
in dividends in 2013, resulting in an industry-
leading dividend yield. The increased dividend 
payments were underpinned by commitment 
to capital discipline and strong free cash  
flow generation.
De-stockpiling on track
Progress made with scheduled stockpile 
reductions and with total gold equivalent  
sales exceeding production. De-stockpiling 
was driven mainly by the Dukat hub  
and Albazino. 
Net debt decreased
Positive cash flows resulted in a stable net 
debt at US$1,045 million, driven by continued 
strong operating cash flow and decreased 
capital spending. 
Production guidance exceeded
Polymetal exceeded its original annual 
production guidance for the second 
consecutive year and produced  
1 ,282 Koz
of gold equivalent, up 21% year-on-year. 
Amursk POX ramp-up  
successfully completed 
The Amursk POX plant delivered a full 
quarter at design throughput and recovery 
(averaging 93% in Q4). This is an important 
strategic milestone for Polymetal, which 
now possesses a unique competitive 
advantage in the FSU. Listing on the London Stock Exchange
First operating POX plant in the  
Former Soviet Union launched
The first operating pressure oxidation plant 
(POX) in Russia’s gold industry, Polymetal’s 
Amursk POX was started up and produced 
its first gold in April 2012.

We are fully on track to meet  
production guidance for 2014  
of 1.3 Moz total gold equivalent, 
increasing to 1.35 Moz in 2015. 
In 2014, we expect total cash costs  
of US$700-750/gold equivalent  
(‘GE’) oz, all-in sustaining cash costs  
of US$975-1025/GE oz, and capital 
expenditure of US$250 million 
(including exploration and  
capitalised stripping).

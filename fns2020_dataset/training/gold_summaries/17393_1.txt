 CHIEF EXECUTIVE – OUR STRATEGY
WS ATKINS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007
PAGE EIGHT 
Plan, Design, Enable is what we do. We now have a focused 
company, extremely well positioned to both improve our 
consultancy services and continue to grow in a whole range of 
sectors where our depth in design, engineering and planning 
skills can be brought to bear. The complexity of our client 
capital programmes continues to increase and skills from 
all our business segments are absolutely key to our ability 
to address them successfully. Internal boundaries are being 
eroded to enable greater collaboration by people across 
teams, business segments and countries. 
Identity and Excellence is our shorthand for how we are 
taking the Group forward. It is about keeping the balance 
between our development of technical and design skills, staff 
retention and recruitment, generation of cash, the winning 
of the work we want to have and, most importantly, the 
successful completion of the work we have won. All must  
be continually kept in balance as the Group goes forward.  
But the last point is absolutely fundamental. 
We have successfully done this for the past three years and 
are confident growth will continue to be the consequence 
of this strategic focus. While we continue to have a strong 
balance sheet which could position us well for acquisitions, 
our focus is on organic growth with excellence as the driver. 
With selective bolt-on acquisitions to supplement, it is vital 
we keep our ethos clearly intact as we continue to grow in 
both capability and size. Our size means we must continue 
to decentralise and build local management strengths and 
simultaneously glue the Group together to allow not only  
staff mobility and flexible career development within the 
whole Group, but also to ensure resources are focused  
on projects that transcend business segment boundaries.  
The protocols we applied to the Dubai Metro project have 
been an excellent first example of how we wish to achieve  
this as a matter of course.
A significant challenge for us is to continue to attract 
talented people to the Group and to retain them. We are 
establishing links with academia and are looking to recruit  
a broader cross-section of talent and experience. We are  
also accelerating recruitment in our Global Design Centres  
in Bangalore and Sharjah – not to save costs, but to enable  
us to recruit some of the brightest engineers in the world  
to our organisation.

The next half decade will see the most radical changes 
to the design process (including procurement) we have 
ever seen. It will be a far greater impact than the advent of 
Computer Aided Design (CAD) or climate change. The need  
to move rapidly towards a sustainable society will introduce 
extra complexity. This is not about bolt-on green initiatives, 
nor offsetting, but introducing at the very start of the 
conceptual planning of all projects – whether buildings, 
utilities, urban design or infrastructures – a different set of 
values. Atkins with its breadth and depth of skills is ideally 
placed to tackle such complex projects if we keep to our 
strategy of Identity and Excellence. Within this context and 
exciting future we must not lose sight of leadership on health 
and safety, and not just Atkins’ staff but of the construction 
industry as a whole. 
To conclude, we have a great position, good markets, 
opportunities to lead change and a proven track record  
with a strong reputation.

8 Annual Report 2014 OUR INVESTMENT CASE
World-class assets
Our oil and gas fields are of the quality 
of those owned by larger integrated oil 
companies. We are the largest producer 
and the largest holder of reserves and 
resources in the Kurdistan Region of 
Iraq, with our production in the region 
now making us one of the largest 
independent oil producers listed on the 
London Stock Exchange.
Low-cost, growing  
oil production
Our production in the KRI during 2014 
averaged 69,000 boepd, an increase  
of 58%. This is set for further material 
growth in 2015. Our oil reserves and 
resources are being developed and 
produced at some of the lowest costs  
in the industry today – testament to 
their size, onshore location and prolific 
reservoirs. This contributes to a low 
breakeven oil price relative to other  
oil developments.
Transformational  
gas business
Our world-class Miran and Bina Bawi 
fields contain an estimated 11 tcf of 
mean raw gas resources, the value  
of which has been unlocked through  
an agreement reached with the KRG  
in November 2014. The agreement 
reduces our capital expenditure to 
first production, generates attractive 
returns for Genel, and will provide 
domestic gas production to power 
continued industrial and economic 
growth in the KRI, while also assisting 
the KRG to fulfil the gas sales agreement 
signed between Turkey and the KRG in 
November 2013.
Turkish heritage and strong 
local relationships
Genel’s decade-long operations in the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq have allowed 
us to build meaningful and beneficial 
relationships, and our Turkish heritage 
plays an important part in assisting us 
in expanding our footprint across our 
chosen regions of operation.
Financial strength
Genel has a robust balance sheet, 
strengthened in 2014 through the  
issue of our senior unsecured bond. 
Maintaining this strength is a core 
element of our strategy, and we expect 
the revised commercial structure for 
our gas business to deliver significant 
free cash generation once Miran and 
Bina Bawi are on-stream. We will be 
disciplined in our capital investment 
across the portfolio while we continue 
to look for growth opportunities. 
Focused and disciplined 
exploration
Taking advantage of the significant 
flexibility in our portfolio, our exploration 
strategy has been reset to focus on 
lower-cost onshore potential within our 
existing KRI and Africa licences. Adding 
resource through exploration remains  
a key objective for Genel and we will 
continue to add new opportunities 
where appropriate. 
Strong management team 
and responsible operations
The strength of our management team, 
and an experienced board, provide the 
expertise to grow the business and the 
governance necessary to maintain the 
integrity of the Company and 
effectively manage risk. Our reputation 
is built not simply on our business 
achievements, but on the way we 
conduct ourselves with our employees 
and partners, our engagement with our 
host communities and governments, 
and our approach and record on health, 
safety and the environment.

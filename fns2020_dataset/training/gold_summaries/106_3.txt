Chairman’s Statement 
On behalf of the Board of 888 Holdings plc, I am pleased to present 
the financial results for the year ended 31 December 2009.
These results again demonstrate the resilience of our brand, the 
breadth and depth of our product offering and our increasing 
geographic reach, in what was a challenging year for all consumer 
facing businesses. 
Financial Results and Dividend
Total Operating Income (‘TOI’) decreased 6% to US$247 million 
(2008: US$263 million) impacted by difficult trading conditions 
and unfavourable exchange rates. EBITDA* was US$46 million 
(2008: US$56 million). Our financial position remains strong as 
ever due to the continued cash generative nature of the Business. 
Our cash position as at 31 December 2009 was US$87.5 million 
(31 December 2008: US$98.4 million). The Board is therefore 
recommending a final dividend of 3.0 cents per share in addition to 
our interim dividend of 1.0 cent per share and special dividend of 2.6 
cents per share, both paid in October 2009.
We are in a strong position to take advantage of the ongoing 
industry consolidation and will participate in M&A opportunities as 
and when they become available.
B2C
888 is more than just a place that offers a first class online gaming 
experience to its players. It is fast becoming an entertainment 
destination, a place where people can enjoy a truly interactive 
experience and be part of an online community that shares common 
interests. 
We continue to innovate across the range of our offering providing 
players with a dynamic gaming experience. Cutting edge products 
such as Live Dealer targeted at European customers are growing 
in importance, and a constantly updated suite of instant games 
integrated across the portfolio helps to keep customers coming back 
to the site with increasing spend. Localisation remains a core focus 
for 888 as we deliver regionally targeted and appealing content in an 
increasing number of languages.
* Before share benefit charges of US$7 million (2008: US$8 million).
During the year we also made a significant change to the 888 brand 
architecture as well as our continuous drive to provide the best offering 
and customer service possible. The look and feel of our umbrella brand 
has been updated and we have refocused our sub-brands to reflect 
the four core gaming products — 888casino, 888poker, 888sport and 
888bingo. The new sites were launched in early 2010 and have proved 
popular with both existing and new players.
The acquisition of the Wink Online Bingo business added to our 
tremendously successful emerging offering, and the relaunch of Reef 
Club Casino introduced a product ideal for the recession, helping 
888’s casino segment to retain a market leading position.
Dragonfish
Early in the year we rebranded and relaunched the B2B business 
as Dragonfish, crystallizing its position as a stand-alone, but 
complementary, part of the Group. The Dragonfish brand is highly 
visible and has achieved significant cut-through in the competitive B2B 
market. A number of new agreements were signed during the year. 
Significantly, in September we signed a landmark deal with Harrah’s  
International Entertainment, to provide services to its non-US facing 
customers, marking the first ever B2B deal with a major US Casino 
operator.
The signing of a partnership with Linden Lab
®
 for payment service 
provision extends our reach outside the online gaming market for the 
first time.

Responsible Gaming and CSR
Responsibility has always been a cornerstone of our business. The 
importance of responsible gaming and corporate responsibility was 
illustrated through the publication of our first stand-alone Corporate 
Responsibility report, which is available on our dedicated website 
www.888responsible.com. 
The Group was saddened by the untimely passing of one of its 
founders, Dr Aharon Shaked late last year. Aharon continued to 
contribute his wisdom and advice to 888 throughout his illness and 
our thoughts and prayers are with his family.
In December, Shay Ben-Yitzhak, one of the founders of the 
business, decided to step down from the Board to devote more 
time to his family. On behalf of the Board and all staff, I would like 
to express our appreciation of Shay’s contribution in growing the 
Company from its infancy and his continuing contribution to date. We 
wish him all the best for the future.
I would also like to add my thanks to all our employees who have 
worked hard to drive the performance of the business in a challenging 
operating environment.
Outlook
2009 was a testing year but we have continued to drive growth 
in both our B2C and B2B businesses, organically and through 
acquisition.
As the economy moves on from the global financial crisis the wider 
online gaming industry can look to the future with confidence. The 
strength and diversity of our offering leaves us well positioned to 
continue to create sustainable value for our shareholders.
The Board remains confident about the prospects for the business.

 Chairman’s statement
4 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Results and dividend
The increasingly widespread adoption of ARM technology in consumer
electronic devices was illustrated in 2005 by the 31% increase in the
reported total shipments of ARM Powered
®
products to 1.7 billion units,
up from 1.3 billion units in 2004. The strong cash generation resulting
from this robust operational performance, together with our confidence
in the Company’s long-term prospects, enabled us to increase
investments in research and development by 20% and to acquire Keil,
a microcontroller tools business, in October 2005.
The combination of ARM microprocessor IP with the physical IP
acquired through the acquisition of Artisan in December 2004 has
accelerated ARM’s momentum towards becoming the architecture for
the digital world. ARM’s strong financial performance continued with
revenue growth at twice the rate of the semiconductor industry, 
year-on-year dollar revenue growth of 14% and operating margins 
up to 33%.
The board decided at the end of 2003 to initiate the payment of an
annual dividend. It is the board’s intention to increase the dividend
over time, taking into account the opportunity for continued
investment in the business and the Company’s underlying operational
performance. With this in mind, the board is recommending a final
dividend of 0.5 pence per share, bringing the total for the year to 
0.84 pence per share, an increase of 20% over the dividend paid in
respect of 2004.
We see a return of cash to shareholders through a dividend as part of
a package of measures to make the best use of the business’s cash
resources. The board also initiated a share buyback programme in July
2005 and purchased a total of 13.9 million shares at a total cost of
£16.2 million in the period up to the end of 2005. The buyback
programme is ongoing.
The market
2005 was expected to be a year of flat growth for the semiconductor
industry although the year ended with growth of approximately 7%. 
In face of a slow first half and an improving second half of 2005, ARM’s
revenue growth of 14% was at a rate double that of the industry. 
Looking to 2006, the industry has started the year with a general
feeling that the growth seen in 2005 would continue at a similar 
level in 2006, with the possibility of some further improvement. 
In the light of this industry backdrop, ARM is well positioned to outgrow
the semiconductor industry once again in 2006. Our confidence in 
the growth of our business is underpinned by a healthy technology
portfolio of both processor and physical IP , consisting of both new and
mature products, the prospect of more synergistic deals for the 
Physical IP Division and continued acceleration of penetration of ARM IP
into royalty-generating designs in both the mobile and non-mobile
market segments.
Geographic expansion
In 2005, ARM continued to strengthen its position as a global entity
across all regions. In the year, 43% of revenue emanated from  ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 5
North America, 43% from Asia Pacific and 14% from Europe. ARM
received its first royalties from China-based chip designers and ended
the year with four Chinese design teams shipping ARM technology-
based designs. ARM also signed the first processor licence with a design
team in India and expects continued success in that country in 2006.
Not only did ARM continue to expand its commercial presence around
the globe in 2005, but the engineering diversity within the Company
also expanded during the year. We now have 11 design centres,
located in Cambridge, Maidenhead, Sheffield and Blackburn, England;
Sunnyvale, California and Austin, Texas in the USA; Bangalore, India;
Sophia Antipolis, France; Leuven, Belgium; and Aachen and Munich,
Germany. During 2005, ARM doubled the capacity of its design team 
in India to more than 100 people and expects to increase it to at least
150 people by the end of 2006.
People
On behalf of the board, I thank all employees worldwide for the
contribution they have made to the excellent results achieved in 
2005 in the increasingly demanding market in which we operate. 
At 31 December 2005, we had 1,324 full-time employees, compared
with 1,171 at the end of 2004. Of these, 576 are based in the UK, 
486 in the US, 101 in continental Europe, 116 in India and 45 in the
Asia Pacific region.
Board changes
Simon Segars and Philip Rowley joined the board in January 2005
which brought the number of directors to 14. Peter Cawdron has been
a member of the board since 1998 and had planned to step down at
the 2005 AGM. He has, however, kindly agreed to stand for re-election
this year for a further period of up to one year, which will provide
valuable continuity following the appointment of four new directors
since December 2004. Lucio Lanza, who joined the board following the
acquisition of Artisan in December 2004, and has considerable
experience of US reporting requirements, joined the audit committee
with effect from February 2006.
Current trading and prospects
During 2005, we integrated Artisan into ARM and began to accelerate
new product development in physical IP . We also brought three 
new processor designs to market, completed the acquisition of 
a microcontroller tools company and invested further in product
development. As a result, we enter 2006 well placed to build 
on our market leadership position.
A broad technology portfolio for licensing, increasing royalty
momentum, growth in development systems sales and the prospect of
more synergistic revenues arising from the combination of processor IP
and physical IP underpin our confidence in our ability to achieve
another strong performance in 2006.

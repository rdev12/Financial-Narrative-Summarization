Trading Performance 
The Board is pleased to report a strong 
performance by the Group, with both 
net fee income (NFI) and pre-tax pro t 
over 20% up compared with last year. 
Total revenues were £371.4m, an increase 
of 23% on the previous year, NFI of 
£36.1m was up 21% and pro t before 
tax of £8.0m was up 25%.
We were pleased to have achieved 
another record year for contractors 
on assignment, which at 31 July 2012 
stood at 6,700, a rise of 12% on the 
previous year. Contract recruitment 
across engineering and technology 
sectors exceeded our initial expectations. 
Permanent recruitment continued to be 
sensitive to economic conditions and 
consequently some clients and candidates 
took longer to commit to new roles, 
which lengthened the time to hire.
The Group’s growth stemmed from 
successfully taking advantage of our 
established presence in growth niche 
markets, strong client retention based 
on consistently rst-class service 
delivery, and from the much improved 
performance by the professional services 
brands, which were created in the last 
2 years. 
Further information on our trading 
performance is provided in the Chief 
Financial O cer’s Report on page 16.
Dividend
Re ecting the year’s good performance, but 
mindful of prevailing economic conditions, 
the Board is pleased to recommend to 
shareholders that the nal dividend is 
maintained at last year’s level of 10.6 pence 
per share, which makes a total dividend for 
the year of 15.6 pence per share (2011: 15.6 
pence) covered 1.6 times by earnings per 
share (2011: 1.3 times).

DESCRIPTION 2012 PROGRESS 2013 OBJECTIVES   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 08
BUSINESS REVIEW
People 
The Group has spent the last 2 years 
creating its new brands around the 
recruitment of experienced sta . With the 
brands now established and management 
in place, resourcing in these areas 
will return to our traditional graduate 
recruitment programme. 
We have a strong tradition of developing 
graduate employees who are mentored by 
senior colleagues, and have clear career 
paths that will encourage them to develop 
within the Group. 
As a people business, we work hard to 
o er our employees an enjoyable and 
stimulating workplace, which the Board 
recognises is important when having to 
remain exible to a wider marketplace 
that demands constant innovation and 
the ability to respond quickly to secure 
opportunities. 
The Board wishes to pay tribute to all 
our sta and to our contractors for their 
continued hard work and dedication.
We were especially pleased to be placed 
25th in the 2012 Sunday Times Best 
Companies to Work For survey. This is an 
award which is entirely based upon the 
feedback of our sta and re ects the high 
importance we place upon employee 
engagement.
Board and Corporate Governance 
During the year Richard Bradford and Rudi 
Kindts joined the Board as Non-Executive 
Directors. We welcome them both and the 
contribution they are already making.
In September I was pleased to announce 
the appointment of Keith Lewis to the 
Board with e ect from 5 September 2012. 
Keith has been with Matchtech for 19 years. 
He is currently responsible for Matchtech 
UK, the largest business within the Group. 
Chairman’s Statement continued   Matchtech Group plc Annual Report 2012  page 09
BUSINESS REVIEW
Keith’s elevation to the Board re ects the 
pivotal role that he plays. He has a long and 
consistent track record of success in driving 
forward our engineering business, and his 
executive experience and character will 
complement what is already a strong Board. 
On behalf of my colleagues, I congratulate 
him on his new role.
I would like to pay a special thanks to David 
Rees, a colleague of the highest integrity, 
who has worked with me for 20 years and 
contributed a substantial amount to the 
success of the business over that time. 
David stepped down as Group HR Director 
and left the Group in September. I wish him 
the very best for the future.
I have also reported separately on 
Corporate Governance in a Letter from 
the Chairman on page 34 of this report.
Strategy
The Group’s traditional strength in 
segmenting the market and delivering 
highly skilled candidates to a largely blue 
chip engineering and technology client 
base gives us continuing competitive 
advantage. 
From this strong platform we have 
identi ed many opportunities to continue 
to grow the business by nding new niches 
to supply and by further internationalising 
our sales e orts. Our strategy is to nd 
and analyse opportunities, but only move 
forward where we can largely de-risk any 
new business propositions. 
Diversifying into new sectors under the 
Professional Services brands of Barclay 
Meade and Alderwood has provided 
opportunities for further growth. In just 2 
years both brands have made signi cant 
inroads into their markets and have 
quickly positioned themselves as experts 
in their elds. Professional Services’ NFI 
was £5.7m, up 33% on the previous full 
year, representing 16% of the Group’s NFI 
(2011: 14%). 
Our international growth strategy is partly 
de-risked by supplying candidates to 
existing clients for their new international 
projects. This lowers the risks associated 
with opening o ces in new countries, 
and has the additional bene t of further 
cementing relationships with our client 
base by helping meet their needs. 
Of course, there are still challenges in 
 nding the right candidates, almost all of 
whom are specialists. To increase our talent 
pool we have invested considerably in our 
technology, brands and websites. We plan 
to strengthen our online presence so that 
our websites are one of the rst places 
where new candidates register when 
looking for new roles. 
Outlook 
Since our Pre-close Trading Update on 
2 August 2012 trading has remained in 
line with the Board’s expectations, with 
contractor numbers at record levels 
continuing to grow well, up 2% in the 2 
months to 30 September 2012. Permanent 
recruitment continues to be sensitive to 
global market news and has started the 
year on a par with last year.
The Group delivered 21% growth in 
NFI in the year ended 31 July 2012. Our 
diversi cation strategy is continuing to 
bear fruit and we are seeing unprecedented 
demand for contract sta within the 
engineering markets with a record 
number of contractors on assignment. 
The changes we have introduced over 
the past 2 years to the Group’s structure, 
position us well for continued growth, 
particularly by supplying more contractors 
to UK clients who have global demand 
for their services or are working on large, 
multi-year engineering infrastructure 
projects in the UK and overseas markets.
Whilst we remain mindful that any 
deterioration in the global economy has 
the potential to impact on our business, 
we look forward with con dence to the 
year ahead.

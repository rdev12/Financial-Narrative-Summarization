 18 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Chairman’s 
statement
I am delighted to announce that 
2008 has been another year of 
strong growth for MITIE. This year 
was our 20
th
 year of revenue and 
proﬁ ts growth.
Throughout the last year we have 
continued to forge new relationships 
and build on long-term partnerships 
with our clients and are delighted to 
welcome thousands of new people 
to MITIE.
We are now well positioned for 
the next stage in our development 
with an excellent management 
team and a well developed 
strategy in place targeting our 
three markets of facilities, property 
and engineering services.

MITIE has had another excellent year , 
with 14.5% growth in our revenue 
to £1,407.2m (2007: £1,228.8m). 
Operating proﬁ t before amortisation 
rose by 20.5% to £72.2m (2007: 
£59.9m) with proﬁ t before tax 
increasing by 20.0% to £67.9m (2007:

reported operating proﬁ t margins 
increased from 4.9% to 5.1%.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a 
ﬁ nal dividend of 3.2p per Ordinary 
share making a total of 6.0p per 
share for the year , a 17.6% increase 
on 2007. This increase is in line with 
our dividend policy to maintain 
dividends in line with underlying 
earnings growth at a cover ratio 
of 2.5 times adjusted earnings.
The dividend will be paid on 
4 August 2008 to shareholders 
on the register at 4 July 2008. 
Pensions
The Group contributes to a range 
of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned 
contribution pension schemes. I am 
pleased to report that the surplus 
within the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes 
has continued this year with a net 
surplus of £7.5m (2007: £0.5m). 
Board changes 
This will be my last year as non-
executive Chairman of MITIE as I 
will retire at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) on 31 July 
2008. I have thoroughly enjoyed the 
last six years with MITIE. I will leave the 
Company in a very strong ﬁ nancial 
position and with excellent prospects 
to succeed in the future under the 
stewardship of Roger Matthews, who 
will be appointed as non-executive 
Chairman at the close of the AGM. 
Roger has been a non-executive 
director since December 2006 and 
brings with him a wide range of skills 
and experience from his previous 
positions as Group Finance director of 
J Sainsbury plc and Group Managing 
director and Group Finance director 
of Compass Group PLC.
Cullum McAlpine, who has been 
a non-executive director of MITIE 
since April 2003 and is Chairman 
of the Audit Committee and senior 
independent non-executive director , 
will also retire from the Board at 
the Company’s AGM. I would like 
to thank Cullum for his support to 
MITIE and the Board over the past 
ﬁ ve years.
The following Board changes will 
also take effect from 31 July 2008. 
David Jenkins will be appointed as 
senior independent non-executive 
director and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. Roger Matthews will 
assume the chairmanship of the 
Nomination Committee. 
The recruitment of a new non-
executive director will commence 
during the year.
Corporate governance
We are committed to maintaining 
high standards of corporate 
governance. The Board recognises 
that MITIE is expected to act to the 
highest standards of responsibility at 
all times and we therefore have in 
place a set of governance structures 
and practices designed to ensure 
that MITIE is run responsibly in the best 
interests of all its stakeholders. 
Outlook
In this my last year as Chairman 
of MITIE, I would like to wish the 
management team every success 
for the future. We enter the new 
ﬁ nancial year with our business 
aligned to meet the needs of our 
ever changing markets. Current 
economic conditions are requiring 
businesses to re-evaluate their cost 
base and to focus resource and 
attention on reducing risk and 
uncertainty in volatile markets. This 
provides us with opportunities as 
organisations seek to reduce costs 
through outsourcing.
We are conﬁ dent that we are well 
positioned to continue our strategy 
of delivering stakeholder value by 
focusing on sustainable, proﬁ table 
growth through 2008 and beyond.

announc ement 	 t o 	 ac quir e 	 BSG.	
adastra is the market leader in the 
provision of software and services 
for the management of out-of-Hours 
(ooH) and unscheduled healthcare in 
the nHs . Bsg provides hosting and it 
services which will support adastra’s 
new product offerings to the health care 
market as well as bring other not-for-
profit customers to the group.
adastra, our first acquisition, was 
very successfully integrated and we 
significantly improved organic growth 
opportunities and we doubled monthly 
eBitda within six months (compared to 
adastra’s prior financial year). 
on acquisition of adastra in august 
2008, our priorities were to implement 
proven sales methodologies, focus the 
marketing strategy, prioritise product 
development to where demand is 
highest, and implement efficient 
processes, particularly across product 
training and service utilisation. 
 
 
 
adastra is building on its core ooH 
business (which includes nHs direct 
and nHs24) and has developed organic 
solutions for other new Primary care 
markets, including walk-in centres, 
polyclinics, and community nurses. 
three new offerings based on the core 
software have been piloted and are 
ready for launch:
iNurse:	 » a mobile solution for 
district nurses, palliative care and 
other community workers
End- o f -Lif e	R egist er:	 » allows the 
treatment preferences of terminally ill 
patients to be registered 
Summary	C ar e	R ec or d: » instant access 
to a patient’s basic health data to help 
to avoid misdiagnosis 
on 8 may 2009, we announced the 
intention to acquire Bsg a managed 
services company that provides hosting 
and outsourcing services to small and 
medium size businesses. Bsg’s services 
will support other offerings in the group 
in particular, inurse and end-of-l ife 
r egister, allowing adastra to bring these 
products to market more quickly and 
with a considerably experienced team. 
 
 
the acs management team believe 
that the combination of adastra and 
Bsg’s hosting services creates a very 
strong platform on which we can now 
build. we are actively identifying further 
businesses to acquire and our selective 
criteria include: strong products and 
services that can further meet the 
needs of Primary care customers 
or provide new channels to market 
for existing products; high levels of 
recurring revenues; the opportunity to 
enhance shareholder value by improving 
efficiencies in a similar way to adastra.
i believe we have an exciting 
opportunity.

Chairman’s statement
“ We made phenomenal progress during 
2013. We delivered record production 
and financial results, as well as taking 
our first steps in M&A.”
Delivering  
continued growth
With strong cash flows, low leverage 
and operational control, we are in  
an excellent position to achieve  
our targets. I am delighted with  
the performance of the management 
team in 2013 and look forward to 
achieving further success in 2014.
Strong financial performance
From a financial perspective, our 
performance was beyond all our 
internal expectations. The record 
levels of revenue and EBITDA in  
2013 were the result of many years  
of front-loaded investment and 
geological work. With EBITDA of more 
than US$550 million and margins still 
above 60%, I am delighted with the 
strong financial position we are in. We 
have continuously reduced leverage 
since our inaugural bond transaction  
in 2010, and are now able to enjoy 
access to the debt capital markets  
at far lower rates than before. 
We continue to manage our cash 
position prudently, whilst also  
looking to maintain a balance  
between shareholder distributions  
and investment in growth. I believe  
in the current oil price environment  
we can sustain these financial results 
over the coming years and provide  
an excellent platform from which to 
deliver our vision. 
Our vision 
Our vision is to become the leading 
independent oil and gas company  
in the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  
We have all the necessary skills to 
create a high-quality and complementary 
portfolio of assets in the FSU, and our 
strategy is built on extracting as much 
value as possible from the front-loaded 
infrastructure investments. I believe 
the management team has all the 
knowledge, experience and skill 
needed to deliver this vision over  
the coming years.
A clear strategy 
We are working to realise our vision 
through a clearly defined strategy, 
balancing organic development with 
opportunistic expansion through 
acquisitions. Our main priority 
remains, as always, to continue to 
deliver growth and shareholder value  
in a responsible and efficient way. 
A very successful year
We made phenomenal progress 
during 2013. We delivered record 
production and financial results as well 
as taking our first steps in M&A. We 
now have a portfolio of assets that  
will further prolong the lifespan of  
our infrastructure at full capacity.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  A solid operational basis
Our financial performance was built  
on another record year of operational 
results. Production of 46,178 boepd 
was above the targeted 45,000 boepd. 
We are now entering a period of 
sustained production at levels above 
45,000 boepd. This steady production 
and associated cash flow will allow us 
to invest in further infrastructure and 
drilling to reach production of 100,000 
boepd by the end of 2016. During 
2013 we have refocused on the 
Chinarevskoye field appraisal, with a 
programme aiming to convert more 
Probable and Possible reserves into 
the Proven reserves (1P) category  
over the next three years. In addition 
to this organic growth, the cash flows 
we are generating allow us to grow 
reserves and extend production 
through our recently established  
M&A strategy. 
Our M&A strategy
We took our first steps in M&A during 
2013 by acquiring three additional 
licences in close proximity to our gas 
treatment facility (GTF). This was the 
first step in broadening our strategy  
to combine organic growth from  
the continued development of the 
Chinarevskoye field with growth 
achieved through M&A. Our M&A 
strategy has two clear elements.  
Firstly, we remain focused on the  
area around our GTF, where we can 
enjoy economies of scale by feeding 
our infrastructure with additional 
reserves to prolong the period of  
peak production. Secondly, we are 
looking further afield to other areas  
of Kazakhstan where we can build  
on our first-class track record of 
appraising and developing Kazakh  
oil and gas assets. I am delighted  
that we were able to add 98 million 
boe 2P reserves through the new 
fields, increasing our total 2P  
reserves to 582 million boe. I look 
forward to developing this aspect  
of our strategy in 2014 and beyond. 
t he highest corporate  
governance standards
At Nostrum, we are committed to 
implementing exemplary standards  
of corporate governance, which we 
recognise as key to our business.  
As such, we have voluntarily adopted  
a Group-wide corporate governance 
code based on the best practice of  
the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
In addition, we have introduced 
internal control provisions in line  
with the Code, ensuring that we are 
fully compliant with our ongoing 
obligations under the UK Listing  
Rules and the UK Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules. As Chairman,  
I recognise that it is my role to  
provide the leadership to the board  
to ensure that it delivers on its 
responsibilities. The board takes  
its role very seriously in ensuring 
Group values are promoted. We have  
a zero tolerance approach to corrupt 
practices and we have a commitment  
at board level to maintaining a culture 
focused on our core principles of 
respect, honesty and transparency. 
This is based on our belief that  
good governance is fundamental  
to protecting value on behalf of  
our shareholders. The board sets  
the standard for the rest of the 
Company and works with 
management to embed these  
values throughout the organisation.

Nostrum Oil & Gas Annual Report 2013  Rewarding exceptional performance
We have continued to witness a 
tightening recruitment market as well  
as increased demand and competition 
for skilled and experienced employees. 
Our growth and success revolve around 
the quality and commitment of our 
people. We maintain a competitive 
remuneration policy by industry 
standards, to ensure that we can 
attract and retain the best people. 
It rewards exceptional performance 
with a balance between short- and 
long-term rewards and a 
comprehensive benefits scheme. 
We continue to grow our local content; 
more than 98% of our employees were 
Kazakh nationals as of the end of 2013. 
We will continue to develop our 
employment practices and policies  
to ensure we can attract and retain  
the best talent. 
Conclusion
2013 saw record operational and 
financial performance across our 
business. We benefited from a  
strong oil price environment,  
which helped the momentum of  
our financial growth and sustained  
our track record of shareholder 
distribution, which increased by 5% 
over 2012. Strategically, we made 
excellent progress in expanding our 
portfolio of assets within north-west 
Kazakhstan. In 2014, I expect our  
focus to shift towards ensuring the 
timely completion of our next GTF  
and building the feedstock in order  
to double production by the end of 
2016. We enter this next investment 
phase with a very strong cash position, 
low leverage and healthy margins.  
We have the platform to execute all 
our strategic initiatives, and this gives  
me great hope for Nostrum in 2014 
and beyond.

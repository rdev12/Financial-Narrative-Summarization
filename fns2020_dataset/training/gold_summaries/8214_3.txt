InTechnology plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006
The past year has seen some important
changes for InTechnology and I am pleased
that the Company has ended the year in a
strong position for sustained growth and
profitability in the future.
The reorganisation programme which we
initiated in the first half of the year enabled
us to achieve operating profit before
amortisation of goodwill and exceptional
items in our continuing operations of £6.0m
(2005: £4.0m) despite a fall in turnover to
£215.0m (2005: £220.3m). Total Group
turnover was £284.7m (2005: £283.5m) and
the operating loss for the Group after the
reorganisation was £6.2m (2005: £0.3m loss).
Our Managed Services Division has shown
robust performance with an increase in sales
to £25.3m (2005: £22.1m), operating profit
before amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items of £1.8m (2005: £2.0m
loss), and an expanding range of services.
The operating loss for the Division was
£1.5m (2005: £4.3m). In order to build on 
the rapidly-growing market in IP telephony,
we have set up a new team to increase 
sales focus in this area. Other parts of the
Division have been re-organised for
maximum effectiveness and customer
satisfaction. Organisations of all sizes
subscribe to these services in order to
achieve efficiency gains and mitigate risk in
the management of the IT infrastructure
which underpins their operations.
Pressure on margins in our UK Specialist
Distribution Division has been severe and 
we therefore implemented a cost control
programme in the first half of the year. In
the second half of the year we achieved
operating profit growth compared with the
first half of the year, which we plan to build
on in the year ahead.
Our European Specialist Distribution
business delivered disappointing results
throughout the year and on 31 March 2006
it was sold to Magirus International GmbH.
This will allow us to focus management
effort in the UK.
The clear objectives for the coming year 
are to continue to grow our Managed
Services business and to focus on key 
areas of profitability in our UK Specialist
Distribution business.
I would like to thank the staff whose loyalty,
energy and professional skills have kept 
pace with the many developments in the
Company in the past year and also our
partners in all areas of the business.
I look forward to an exciting and successful
year ahead.

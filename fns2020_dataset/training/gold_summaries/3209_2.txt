We source gas and electricity from our own production and
from third parties, mainly to supply British Gas Residential. Our
Morecambe gas fields can supply around 6% of the UK’s peak
day gas demand; we produce approximately 67% of our peak
domestic demand for our electricity customers from our seven
gas-fired power stations and major contracts; and we are
expecting to invest up to £1 .5 billion in renewable assets over
the next few years.

The map illustrates how much revenue each of the regions
contributed to the Group’s 2007 total. The UK, our home market,
continues to contribute the majority. North American revenues 
are growing every year (in local currency) and we expect our
operations here to become even more significant in the future. 
Our businesses in Europe remain small but we expect to see
growth once the markets they are in open fully to competition.

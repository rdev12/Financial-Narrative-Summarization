Our culture, of course, comes from our people and I am 
proud of the business we have built together. We strive to 
make Rightmove a great place to work and this enables us 
to attract and retain the best talent and provide the best 
service for consumers and customers. I am delighted that in 
our 2014 ‘Have Your Say’ people survey, again over 90% of 
respondents think Rightmove is a great place to work. I would 
like to thank everyone for everything they have done over the 
past year .
We have seen increased adoption of our additional 
advertising products and packages as customers invest 
more to drive their brand exposure and gain the competitive 
edge. Average revenue per advertiser (ARPA) increased by 
13% in 2014 with around 70% of the ARPA growth driven by 
customers spending more on these products and packages. 
Spending on additional products and packages now 
accounts for 40% of Agency and New Homes revenue. 
With an increase in both the number of agency offices 
and the number of new home developments, our 
membership base grew by 5% in the last 12 months. 
This, coupled with the increase in ARPA, has driven our 
significant revenue and profits growth in the year.
Business model
Rightmove is the UK’s largest property portal and operates  
a two-sided model that benefits from strong network effects. 
On the one side we have the UK’s largest and most engaged 
property audience and on the other side we have the largest 
inventory of properties from over 19,300 advertisers.
Consumers engage with Rightmove when searching and 
researching the property market and when selling or letting 
their property. Rightmove is a free consumer service that is 
compelling to buyers and renters as they can see nearly the 
whole of the market and is compelling to sellers and landlords 
as it is where nearly all buyers and renters are searching and 
researching the market. 
Rightmove’s popularity with the British home moving  
public has gone from strength to strength, as more home 
movers visited more often and spent more time on 
Rightmove than ever in 2014. Today they come to search 
and research the only marketplace with over one million 
properties in the UK.
We count nearly every agent in the UK as a customer 
and we care about all of our customers’ business success 
and focus on building strong relationships that support their 
ambitions. This approach continues to serve us well as we 
have grown our customer base by 5% during 2014 to a 
record high. 
The importance and trust in our brand was highlighted by 
figures released by Google showing that Rightmove was the 
most searched for business in the UK in 2014 and a national 
survey showing that 94%
(1)
 of home sellers expect their 
property to be marketed on Rightmove. The ubiquity of our 
brand coupled with our commitment to ongoing innovation 
has significantly increased consumer engagement. Traffic 
increased by 10% to 15.4 billion pages and consistent with 
being a multi-platform digital leader, over half of our visits 
now come from mobile devices.
On the back of this record traffic the number of leads we 
generated for our customers increased to 43 million, up 
19% on 2013 and more than double the number of leads we 
generated in 2012. Our market share of leads has increased 
and the share of sales from our leads remains at over 80% 
meaning vendors are five times more likely to find a buyer  
on Rightmove than any other website.
Our culture of restlessness has driven further 
improvement and innovation in the year. We launched 
Instant Property Alerts which alert home movers within 
minutes of a property coming to the market. We send over 
one million alerts every day and a quarter of our registered 
users with property alerts have already signed up to get 
them instantly. We also launched a number of new products, 
including Property Alert Sponsor to enable agents to 
advertise in our Property Alerts, in addition to a series of 
enhancements to our existing products.

We also have a number of smaller business units, including 
advertising overseas and commercial properties, providing 
property related data and valuation services, and providing 
a platform for property related advertisers such as mortgage 
providers and removal companies.
Our strategy 
We have a disciplined focus on the UK property advertising 
market. We focus on increasing the size and engagement 
of our audience of property consumers to provide great 
value for our customers. We focus on growing organically 
through our customers investing more in their presence on 
Rightmove and by broadening our offering to cover more of 
the consumer journey.
Our brand
Our strong brand recognition with the public and the 
simplicity of the core service we provide make Rightmove 
the public’s first choice to help them find their next home. 
Much of our success comes from the positive experience  
that home hunters have in using our services in addition to 
our considerable investment over 15 years in promoting the 
Rightmove brand.
We have continued to invest in our brand in 2014 with our 
new ‘find your happy’ campaign. The campaign plays on the 
theme that finding the ‘right’ home creates one of life’s most 
positive emotions…happiness. And there’s a happy out there 
for everyone. A ‘walk to work’ happy, a ‘close to a good 
school’ happy, a ‘smell the sea air’ happy. We are using the 
campaign to empower people to search and research homes 
on Rightmove that means they will ‘find their happy’.
Our brand building has focused on national TV , more 
recently through our partnership with Channel 4 across all of 
their property content. We also specifically target London 
through additional outdoor media, 400 Rightmove branded 
taxis and our Time Out partnership. We launched refreshed 
material at the start of 2015 across all our media, including 
national TV , building on the largest consumer themes of ‘more 
indoor space’, ‘more outdoor space’, ‘a place of my own’ 
and ‘minimal commute time’.
Our customers are primarily estate agents, lettings agents 
and new homes developers advertising properties for sale 
and to rent in the UK. We offer the most significant and 
effective exposure for their brand and properties, the largest 
source of high quality leads together with best in class tools, 
market insight and support.
Our principal sources of revenue are the monthly 
subscription fee paid by customers to advertise all their 
properties and the monthly subscription fee paid for 
additional advertising products and packages that promote 
their properties, brand and proposition more strongly.
Our model benefits from a strong network effect with the 
growth of home movers and property advertisers providing 
a ‘virtuous circle’ enhancing the Rightmove value proposition.
Our growth potential comes from continuing to realise 
the value embedded in our market leading audience through 
product innovation and pricing, helped by the ongoing 
structural shift of property advertising spend from offline 
to online with further opportunity afforded from a cyclical 
recovery in the UK housing market.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Rightmove’s position is strong when measured by traditional 
classified advertising metrics, with brand awareness close to 
90% and over ten million unique users. Our commanding 
position is revealed when one looks at how often consumers 
visit and what they do. The depth of consumers’ engagement 
with Rightmove not only leads to more consumers turning to 
Rightmove first and spending more time on Rightmove, but 
most importantly to more and better quality leads leading to 
better outcomes and value for our customers.
We have over 60% market share of visits and leads, over 
70% share of page impressions, over 80% share of sales 
generated from our leads compared to our  nearest competitor 
and over 90% of sellers expecting their property to be 
marketed on Rightmove.
Innovation
Our mission is to empower the UK’s decisions around  
property. We want to continue to be the place that consumers 
turn to first and engage with the most when searching and 
researching property to ensure we are the brand they insist on.
To that end, in addition to our ongoing investment in our 
brand, we continue to innovate and invest in our market 
leading desktop, mobile and tablet platforms to deliver the 
most engaging experience for consumers. Our focus is on 
having the largest, most up to date and accurate property 
inventory in the UK coupled with the best search and research 
capability and fastest property alerts.
We are the most up to date site and over one third of  
our agents are now using the real-time data feed, which we 
built last year and has become the industry standard, to get 
their vendors’ properties onto Rightmove immediately. To 
complement this we launched Instant Property Alerts to alert 
consumers within minutes of a property coming to market. 
Via Property Alerts alone, we have 1.4 million highly engaged 
subscribers to whom we delivered over a quarter of a billion 
property alerts in 2014.
We serve by far the most pages of property pricing 
information in the UK and we have an opportunity to grow this 
advantage further by extending our offering to consumers 
researching the market. We added our popular ‘Sold Prices’ 
functionality to our mobile and tablet platforms in 2014. 
This functionality is unique in that it matches our unrivalled 
catalogue of current and archived properties, containing over 
two billion property images, to Land Registry sold prices.
We also launched a new ‘Market Info’ section to help 
consumers better understand their local market. In the first 
month alone this new content was viewed over two million 
times. Looking forward, our innovation lab is launching a 
new valuation app early in 2015. 
The infrastructure that underpins Rightmove is critical 
to our success and in 2014 the team achieved an enviable 
99.995% for availability and a webpage load time of 
just over one second which is twice the speed of our 
nearest competitor.
Competitive edge
We want to offer the most significant and effective exposure 
for our customers’ brands and properties, be the largest 
source of high quality leads and empower our customers’ 
decisions through best in class tools, market insight 
and support.
In addition to the valuation opportunities within the 
43 million leads we generated, over 70,000 individual  
home sellers used our Local Valuation Alert product to 
request a valuation directly from their local agents.
We launched an upgrade to our popular market 
intelligence tools under the banner of ‘Rightmove Intel’ to 
provide further insight into local markets for our agents and 
ensure they have the competitive edge. Drawing on the 
most comprehensive dataset available, Rightmove Intel 
builds on our existing set of tools which are used by 90% of 
our customers who generate over half a million reports using 
these tools every month.

We care about our customers’ business success and building 
strong relationships is vital in order to support their ambitions. 
We are spending more time with customers than ever before 
as we expand and segment our account management team 
and increase their efficiency through better sales and 
administrative tools and back-office support. We have also 
provided more training and introduced new tools to facilitate 
better conversations with customers.
We refreshed our ever popular seminar programme 
focusing on the 21st century home mover, their digital 
footprint, and how agents can use Rightmove to better 
identify and understand the consumer and their evolving 
property-related needs. We ran over 25 seminars across the 
country for more than 2,000 participants and also introduced 
more specialised content in the form of webinars. Already in 
2015 we’ve run six seminars across the country from Torquay 
to Inverness.
Other businesses
Our overseas homes advertising business has grown strongly 
with customer numbers up 70% in the year to over 2,000. 
Audience figures set new records with over 80 million 
overseas searches, up 33% on last year. Rightmove now has 
170,000 overseas homes advertised for sale, an increase of 
over 50% compared to a year ago.
Our commercial property advertising business has 
established itself as the UK’s largest commercial property site 
with over 45,000 properties advertised and close to 70 million 
commercial searches in 2014, up 75% on last year.
Our data services business continues to grow as we help 
a wide range of customers, including banks and surveyors 
to leverage Rightmove’s UK property database, which is the 
largest of its kind covering nearly two-thirds of the UK owner 
occupied and privately rented housing stock.
Current trading and outlook
The outlook for the UK online property advertising market 
remains positive as consumers and customers become ever 
more digital and the market continues to shift from traditional 
advertising channels. We are well positioned to benefit from 
this transition due to our market leading position which is 
strengthening on both sides of the network.
Our customers choose to spend money with Rightmove 
based on the value we deliver. We are delighted that nearly  
every agent in the UK has chosen to remain on Rightmove 
following the recent launch of a new entrant, OnTheMarket.com, 
cementing Rightmove as the best property advertising option in 
the UK. As at the end of February customer numbers were 
unchanged from our record year end position.
With our market leading position strengthening, average 
spend per advertiser continuing to grow and record January 
traffic numbers, the Board remains confident of making 
further progress in growing the business organically in 2015 
and beyond.

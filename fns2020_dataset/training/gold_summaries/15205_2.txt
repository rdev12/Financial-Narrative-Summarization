d

w is a masterbatch 
which, when included at the 
manufacturing stage, turns 
ordinary plastic at the end of 
its useful life into a material 
with a different molecular 
structure. At that stage it is 
no longer a plastic and has 
become a material which is 
inherently biodegradable in 
the open environment in 
the same way as a leaf.

determine in less than 60 
seconds whether or not a 
plastic product contains d

Waste-to-value. Symphony 
has identiﬁed the disposal of 
scrap tyres as a major issue, 
and we are asked to provide 
solutions for the millions of 
scrap tyres dumped around 
the world. Symphony 
Recycling Technologies 
has launched SymTyre-S300 
as a ﬁrst step solution 
which “ﬂat-packs” the 
tyres, making them easier 
and more cost-effective 
to store and to transport. 
Symphony is currently 
working on further solutions 
for scrap tyres and other 
waste products.

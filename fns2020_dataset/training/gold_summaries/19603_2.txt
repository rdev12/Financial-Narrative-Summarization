Board succession planning
We continued the work we started in 2014 in 
refreshing the Board following the retirement 
of some longer-serving directors. Vinita Bali 
joined the Board at the end of 2014. She was 
followed by Erik Engstrom in January 2015 and 
Robin Freestone in September 2015. After the 
changes to Board composition made over the 
past two years, we are confident that we now 
have a Board with the appropriate balance of 
skills, experience and diversity to lead Smith & 
Nephew through the next stage of our history.
Olivier Bohuon
In February we announced that our Chief 
Executive Officer, Olivier Bohuon, had been 
diagnosed with a highly treatable form of 
cancer . Olivier will remain Chief Executive 
Officer and be actively involved in running 
the Company through much of his treatment 
period, which is expected to be completed 
by late autumn. The Board has approved 
provisional governance procedures to ensure 
the effective operation of Smith & Nephew 
during the treatment period, and I will provide 
executive oversight if required.
Sir John Buchanan
It is with great sadness that we learnt of the 
passing of our former Chairman of the Board, 
Sir John Buchanan, during the year . Sir John 
was a wise, distinguished and respected 
colleague who served Smith & Nephew and 
many other companies with great distinction. 
His legacy of integrity, strong values and high 
standards will live on here at Smith & Nephew.
Thank you for placing your trust in us as a Board 
by holding shares in Smith & Nephew. The 
Board takes our responsibilities very seriously 
and look forward to continuing to govern the 
Company in 2016 and returning good results for 
you, our shareholders.
Yours sincerely,
Roberto Quarta
Chairman

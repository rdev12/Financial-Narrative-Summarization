 EMBEDDED SYSTEMS
Embedded Systems integrate multiple
technologies to perform predefined tasks, 
an automotive example would be an in-car
navigation system. Our market potential is
created by demand for increased design
productivity, driven by customer demand for
reduced product design cycles, product
complexity and product differentiation.
ACCELERATED COMPUTING
Accelerated Computing is enabled by the
application of ESL solutions and programmable
semiconductors to massively reduce the time
taken by compute-intensive programs. Our
market potential is to simplify the migration of
existing software algorithms into high
performance programmable semiconductors.
This solution satisfies the demand for rapid
scientific analysis such as genome sequencing.

La Tasca Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2006
We are pleased to report another
strong set of results for the year ending
30 April 2006, which was our first full
year as an AIM listed Company.
Results 
The Company’s financial performance
was good. Turnover grew by 13.8%
from £48.8 million in the year ending
30 April 2005 to £55.6 million in this
latest year. Earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA) increased by 18.5% from 
£8.4 million to £10.0 million. 
Operating profit (pre amortisation 
of goodwill) rose by 16.8% from 
£6.1 million to £7.1 million. Pre-tax
profit before goodwill amortisation was
up by 55.3% to £6.1 million and fully
diluted earnings per share (EPS) before
goodwill was 7.88p, a 50.1% increase.
At the year end, net debt was £16.7
million representing gearing of 68.2%.
Strategic overview
During the year we have made good
progress in strengthening the position
of La Tasca as the leading Spanish
restaurant brand in the UK, while
broadening the base of the Company 
by developing new brands and markets.
We opened 8 new La Tasca restaurants
in the UK to reach 54 in total. We
have targeted our openings at the
economically strong South East of the
country, particularly central London
where we have been underrepresented.
The team have worked particularly 
hard to improve our management
retention rates which are key to
growing customer loyalty and
shareholder value in this industry.
Our second Spanish concept called 
La Viña Bar and Restaurant has
progressed well. Designed to appeal 
to a different customer demographic, 
it is allowing us to make further inroads
in to the Spanish market segment and
raise our sights on the number of
restaurants and bars we can open in 
the UK. 
Our development and testing of 
La Tasca in the USA market is showing
promising signs. Both the Washington
and Clarendon Virginia restaurants 
are competing in the toughest casual
dining market in the world and yet
delivered excellent sales and operating
profits. This not only confirms the
strength of our unique brand but is
providing valuable insight for our UK
operations. Baltimore which opened 
in March in a spectacular site on the
harbour front is our third outlet, 
in a plan to open 7 before we seek
partners to support further growth. 
Finally we are delighted to have
initiated a fourth new potential income
opportunity. Specifically our team have
created a new concept Sam and Maxie’s
Bar, Grill and Smokehouse. This is a
premium casual affordable dining offer
and is targeted particularly for leisure
parks and shopping centres – trading
locations which are known well by our
management team. The first outlet at
Stevenage Leisure Park is off to a good
start and two prime locations have
been acquired, one in the Trafford
Centre in Manchester and the other 
in Milton Keynes. The total number 
of restaurants in operation at the year
end was 64.
Dividend 
A final dividend is proposed of 0.74p
per share (nil in 2005) to be paid to 
all shareholders on the register at 
1 September 2006. On top of the
interim dividend paid of 0.37p per
share, the total for the year will be
1.11p per share.
Prospects 
We have had a slow start to the new
financial year as the football World Cup
has negatively impacted traditionally
strong summer trading weeks.
Moreover up to 14 new site openings 
will not offset these shortfalls as the
openings and their pre-opening 
costs occur towards the end of the
financial year.
However with the people, systems, and
strong brand line up we have in place,
we remain fully confident of delivering
further good growth in the year ahead.

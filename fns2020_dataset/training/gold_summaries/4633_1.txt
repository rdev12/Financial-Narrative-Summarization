Densitron Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st December 2012
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
We began 2012 with optimism that the economic climate was 
improving and together with the changes that had been made 
to the business over the previous few years and the plans to 
strengthen the business further the prospects were good that 
the progress the business had made during the previous 12 
months would continue. Unfortunately, in the markets in which 
we operate, rather than seeing confidence return we saw a 
continuation of uncertainty and consequently caution from 
our customers. This has had the result of customers delaying 
placing new orders, placing new orders at lower levels and more 
importantly, delaying bringing new products to market. Right 
up to the end of the year we were expecting certain additional 
revenues to be delivered but ultimately this did not happen and 
have been delayed into 2013. We are now beginning to see 
some of these projects being finalised and the orders starting to 
come through.
With this backdrop it would be very easy to write the year off as 
a bad year and emphasise that 2013 will improve but despite the 
issues faced during 2012 there have been some very important 
and positive progressions in the business. We have continued 
to expand geographically, introduced new product offerings that 
contain our own intellectual property and developed additional 
services to attract new and retain existing customers. This 
demonstrates the continuing development of the business and 
will ensure that it is positioned to enable it to deliver growth into 
the future.
Performance for the year
Overall the results for the year were disappointing with 
the growth that was expected at the start of the year not 
materialising. Revenues decreased by 2% from £23.1 million 
in 2011 to £22.6 million in 2012 and gross profit by 6% from 
£6.9 million in 2011 to £6.5 million in 2012. The gross margin 
percentage decreased from 29.6% in 2011 to 28.6% in 2012 
primarily reflecting the mix of business being conducted during 
the year but also indicating the pressure the business is under 
to offer competitive pricing to customers. Combining this with a 
small increase in operating expenses, operating profit decreased 
from £1.1 million in 2011 to £0.6 million in 2012.
Orders booked during the year increased by 9% from £21.2 million 
in 2011 to £23.1 million in 2012 indicating the potential for future 
growth.
Regional review
European business — The European business describes the 
location of where business is managed from so can incorporate 
sales outside the region. It is made up of four subsidiaries, three 
local offices and a number of distributors located throughout 
Europe and in other key locations.
Densitron Europe Ltd is the Group’ s UK subsidiary responsible 
for sales in the UK, management of offices in Italy, India and the 
Netherlands, management of the Group’ s distribution network, 
providing support to other European subsidiaries and direct sales to 
other regions where the Group does not have a physical presence.
During 2012 the revenues remained flat at £6.1 million while 
gross profit decreased by 19% from £1.9 million in 2011 to £1.7 
million in 2012. Order intake increased by 17% from £5.4 million 
in 2011 to £6.3 million in 2012. As a result of a decrease in gross 
margin and an increase in administrative expenses following a 
decision to invest in the future of the business, the UK generated 
a small loss before taxation compared with a profit of £338,000 
in 2011. For the medium and long term future of the business it 
was essential that investment was made in the business during 
the year and the benefit of this is reflected in the increase in 
orders booked which will enable the UK business to return to 
growth during the coming year.
The office that was opened in India at the beginning of 2012 
has been slower than expected in delivering business. However, 
during the year a strong pipeline of business opportunities has 
been developed and we would expect to see those being turned 
into revenues during the coming year. India is undoubtedly 
an excellent opportunity for the business but is a very difficult 
market to operate in and is taking longer to develop than we 
had hoped. We expect that the new products and services that 
have been developed will be particularly attractive to the Indian 
market and remain confident that it will be a region that will 
deliver significant business to the Group in the future. Towards 
the end of 2012 the UK appointed a commissioned agent in 
the Netherlands to promote the Group’s products in that region 
further demonstrating the Group’s commitment to expanding the 
business geographically.

During 2011 France made a number of higher volume sales at 
lower margin; in 2012 these sales were not repeated resulting 
in a fall in revenues from £3.5 million in 2011 to £2.4 million in 
2012. The margin percentage achieved on external sales in 2012 
improved from 23.3% in 2011 to 26.9% in 2012. Together with 
the control of administration expenses this has resulted in the 
operating profit of the business remaining similar to that achieved 
in 2011.
Germany is the largest market for displays in Europe but as 
a result of this it is also the most competitive. During the year 
revenues declined in Germany from £2.3 million in 2011 to  
£2.1 million in 2012. Following a year of declining revenues in 
2011 action was taken to restructure the business in Germany 
during 2012 and we now believe that the structure is appropriate 
to be able to effectively service the market. Despite the decline 
in revenues the restructuring enabled savings in administration 
expenses which resulted in a small increase in operating profit. 
Orders booked in the year increased from £1.7 million in 2011 
to £2.2 million in 2012 indicating that the restructuring that was 
done has made the business more effective.
Finland achieved a similar result to that achieved in the previous 
year of revenues of £0.5 million and a small loss. Opportunities 
remain in Finland but competition in certain product lines has 
increased markedly in the last few years. As such the business 
will benefit from the differentiation the new product lines and 
services that the Group is able to offer will bring over the next  
12 months.
US business — The US business continued to perform 
extremely well with revenues increasing 2.6% from £7.8 million 
in 2011 to £8.0 million in 2012. However, due to a decrease in 
gross margins and an increase in administrative expenses the 
operating profit reduced from £774,000 in 2011 to £656,000 in 
2012. Orders booked in the year fell by 1.3% from £7.7 million in 
2011 to £7.6 million in 2012.
The US business identified Brazil as a growing economy and 
one which the Group could expand into successfully. It has tried 
several ways to penetrate this market but as yet with limited 
success, it continues to believe that there are opportunities in 
Brazil and will continue to pursue them in the future.
Asian business — The Asian business is made up of the 
Group’s subsidiary located in Japan selling display products into 
the Japanese market and a subsidiary that is located in Taiwan 
that acts as a facilitator to the Group for product that is sourced 
and manufactured in Taiwan and mainland China. It also has a 
limited amount of sales into the Taiwanese domestic market.
Japan continued to grow during the year increasing revenues 
by 20% from £2.4 million in 2011 to £2.9 million in 2012. It also 
increased its profit from operations from £307,000 in 2011 to 
£331,000 in 2012, an increase of 8%.
Densitron Display Taiwan Ltd provides the Group with a support 
operation that provides project management, engineering 
support and supplier relationship services to the rest of the 
Group. It also provides some direct sales into the Taiwanese 
market and the management of the Bonding Facility opened 
at the end of 2012. In the current year external revenues 
remained at a similar level but due to a fall in intra Group trading 
Densitron Display Taiwan returned an operating loss of £100,000 
compared with a profit of £71,000 in 2011. The introduction 
of the Bonding Facility is a key component to generating more 
external business in Taiwan and China and the early indications 
are that this will be a service that is marketable directly to Far 
East customers.
Developments
I identified in my report in the 2011 Annual Report that it was 
essential that in order for the business to move to another level it 
needed to create its own products and consequently intellectual 
property. Over the last 12 months we have developed Ripdraw™ 
and opened our own Optical Bonding Facility. There are detailed 
case studies on both of these developments in this Annual

Densitron Technologies plc 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st December 2012
Report so I will not explain in great detail what each is but I will 
explain the reasoning behind the development of them and what 
they will offer the business going forward.
Optical Bonding — The Group has offered optical bonding to 
its customers for some time through a third party manufacturer. 
However, there have been a number of issues involved with 
the process which has limited its effectiveness. The volumes of 
displays for bonding that the Group has subcontracted to third 
party manufacturers have been small and consequently have 
not been prioritised by the manufacturer causing excessive 
lead times between order and delivery. In addition the process 
used by the manufacturer has led to yield problems causing 
substantial quantities of displays to be destroyed during the 
process. The main reason for the yield rate was the inability to 
rework any errors which resulted in displays being scrapped. 
We identified that most manufacturers that offer this service are 
targeting the mobile phone and tablet markets so the volumes 
that our customers and our competitors’ customers were 
ordering were always going to be a low priority. We considered 
that if we could offer this service ourselves at a cost effective 
price it would enable us to provide a greater service than our 
competitors making the business more attractive to potential 
customers. We spent some time reviewing the options and found 
a solution that is far simpler than that used by our manufacturer 
which reduces the yield issues considerably as any problems 
can be reworked and means that smaller sample orders can 
be delivered to customers as well as larger production orders. 
We have already seen interest from manufacturers that aren’t 
currently offering optical bonding which is the reason we have 
confidence that this will enhance the opportunities to generate 
additional business in China and Taiwan.
Ripdraw™ Software — A barrier to small businesses including 
a display in their product is the cost of the development of the 
software required to project the images required. In most cases 
software houses are employed which can be very expensive. 
The software suite developed by the Group enables a user to 
develop the way in which they project the information on their 
display quickly and easily. The fact that a customer can do this 
for themselves means that they can develop a product and 
get it to market far quicker than they would be able to if they 
employed a software house. In the past the decision as to which 
display to put in a product may have been taken on price which 
would have often meant that the Group could not compete with 
the distribution arms of the major manufacturers. By offering 
software with the display it means that a new range of customers 
will be open to the Group.
Ripdraw™ Hardware — this provides a total plug and play 
solution for customers requiring a certain quality of display 
(guaranteed for three to five years) with touchscreen and pcb 
(printed circuit board) built in. This niche product will be a major 
requirement in certain markets.
Outlook and future strategy
The development of any business rarely runs smoothly and the 
performance of the business in 2012 is a case in point. At the 
end of 2011 we were confident that the growth we had seen 
in the previous years would continue and invested to take the 
business forward. The continuing lack of confidence in the 
economy shown by our customers has undoubtedly held the 
development of the business back but within these constraints 
we have been able to deliver most of the strategies outlined in 
my 2011 report. The overall strategy of organic growth remains in 
place and within that there are four key strategies for developing 
the business:
•	 Increasing market share from the existing business — as a 
result of the lack of confidence in the markets in which the 
business operates we were unable to achieve this during the 
year but it will be an area of key focus during 2013. Each 
of the subsidiaries has targets that they themselves have 
set as being achievable and the cost bases have been set 
accordingly to meet the targets;
•	 Geographical expansion of the business — in 2012 we 
opened offices in India and the Netherlands. In 2013 we do 
not have specific plans to open new offices but will continue to 
try and address the Brazilian market;
•	 Introduction of new products to the current product offerings 
— during 2012 we introduced a range of our own TFT displays 
and will continue to develop products as we see a need for 
them within the business; and
•	 Creation of more value by development of the Group’s own 
products and consequently intellectual property — we have 
developed Ripdraw™ and opened the Bonding Facility. Neither 
of these opportunities brought any revenue to the business 
during 2012 so we would expect to see additional revenues 
from these business streams going forward. We are committed  
to increasing the intellectual property within the business and 
to that end will continue to identify areas where we can add 
value to the products that we offer our customers.
I would like to thank all of the staff within Densitron for their hard 
work during what was a very difficult year and look forward to the 
business returning to growth during the forthcoming year.

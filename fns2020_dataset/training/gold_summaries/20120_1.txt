Chief Executive’s review
 Co m p u tac e n t e r  
– 20 years on 2014 was my twentieth 
year as Chief Executive 
Officer of Computacenter.  
During that time the  
Group has changed 
beyond recognition, 
becoming a public 
company in 1998, and 
subsequently continuing  
to grow its revenues, 
operational locations  
and the services that it 
provides to its customers. 
Whilst the Group has 
continued to evolve and 
mature over that period, 
there are two of our 
stakeholders who  
have been, and continue  
to be, fundamental to  
our success: our people  
and our customers.
Computacenter has always recognised  
that people matter. I have been privileged  
to witness the talent and dedication of our 
employees at close proximity over a long 
period of time, and without their support the 
Group would not be where it is now. I would 
like to offer my thanks to all for their ongoing 
efforts. We also recognise that the growth 
and development of the business over recent 
years would not have been possible on our 
own, and the relationships we have with our 
vendors, sub-contractors and other external 
stakeholders have been, and remain crucial 
in any success that we have. 
We have always been clear about the need  
to put our customers first, which includes 
being straightforward and transparent in  
our dealings with them. Our relationships 
with our customers have been aided by the 
longevity and continued relevance of our 
client director management model, which 
allows our empowered and accountable  
client directors to respond flexibly, quickly 
and decisively to the needs and wants of  
our customers. 
Computacenter’s ideology has always  
been to grow with our customers, and  
whilst we are looking to build value for  
our stakeholders across all time horizons,  
we continue to consider the long term in  
all aspects and at all levels of our decision-
making. This allows us to recognise, take 
responsibility for and improve levels of 
service where we fall short of the high 
standards that our customers expect from  
us, and that we expect from ourselves.  
Our customers put their faith in us to  
deliver for them, and we understand the 
importance of keeping our promises to them. 
Moving forward as a Group
However, we realise that in some areas the 
Company cannot remain the same, and that 
there is an inherent need to keep developing. 
The competition in our markets remains 
fierce and unrelenting, technology is 
continuously developing and the end-users  
of our customers are becoming increasingly 
sophisticated and demanding. The significant 
strategy work undertaken by the Group’s 
Board and Management over the previous  
24 months has allowed us to bring further 
clarity to what we want to deliver, and who 
we want to do business with. Computacenter 
cannot be, and should not be, all things to  
all people. Through our clarity of strategic 
ambition and the operating stability that  
we have now achieved through the 
implementation of our Group Operating 
Model, we will focus relentlessly on our 
execution across all of our operating 
geographies, which will have access to the 
Group’s best people, processes and tools. 
When I look back over the last 20 years,  
I am pleased with the progress that the Group 
has made, and in dealing with our future 
challenges we should be confident and 
recognise that there is much to build on. 
Whilst I am pleased, I am not satisfied.  
There remains much to do and improve, 
many opportunities to exploit and our passion 
to deliver for our customers remains as 
strong as ever.
I would like to thank you, our shareholders  
for your consistent and unwavering support 
during the period. I look forward to seeing 
you, and hope to receive your support at our 
Annual General Meeting on 19 May 2015.

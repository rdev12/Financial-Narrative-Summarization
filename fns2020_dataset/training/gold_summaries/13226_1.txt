Directors’ Report: Business Review
Chief Executive’s review
A strong track record of delivery
2010 was a solid year of performance 
made possible by the delivery of key 
strategic initiatives rather than any 
noticeable pick up in the world economy. 
That the business remained proﬁ table and 
in 2010 generated more cash than in 2009 
demonstrates our strong and deep 
foundations. 
We are now a much ﬁ tter and more 
nimble business which will be to the 
beneﬁ t of our customers and 
shareholders. The strategic initiatives of 
2010 were focused on orientating the 
business to recover occupancy and 
margin in 2011 regardless of the rate of 
economic recovery. This includes having 
the right business centres in the right 
places on the right terms; generating 
more enquiries and increasing the sales 
conversion; streamlining processes and 
structures; continually innovating our 
product and service mix; and, crucially, 
investing in our people. Such investments 
have come at some cost but it is 
important to highlight these investments 
are fully self funded and we expect to see 
a return in 2011.
We continue to experience broad-based 
demand across all markets and market 
sectors but especially from large 
multinationals for our assistance in 
supporting their move to lower cost ﬂ exible 
working models. This accelerating trend is 
one of the key drivers of our business and 
we believe will be so for years to come. 
With renewed focus we have delivered 
the growth we set out to achieve at the 
beginning of 2010; we opened 125 new 
centres, which led us into seven new 
countries. It is our intention to sustain this 
growth rate into 2011 as we look to 
extend our global reach and strengthen in 
country networks giving us an ever 
greater addressable market. 
Strategy 
Our vision is clear; to be where people 
and businesses want to work and to be 
the platform from which they work, be it 
mobile or ﬁ xed, virtual or physical, large 
company or small. As a result our 
strategy is equally simple: to be in as 
many of those locations as quickly as we 
can. That we are the only business that 
can aspire to this demonstrates the scale 
of the opportunity in a world of more than 
a billion mobile workers. 
Strategic highlights
In 2010 we delivered a number of key 
strategic initiatives which have 
transformed the business. These are:
2009 and 2010 have been 
momentous years for 
the world economy and 
all businesses have had 
to respond and adapt in 
order to progress. We 
have been no different.

• Strengthened Management Structure
– To better manage our growing 
business, within our regions, we have 
started the process of organising day-
to-day management of 30 country/
market groupings. With supervisory 
oversight from our new global 
management centre in Geneva, 
decision making is being accelerated 
and improved. In 2010 key hires 
and internal promotions were made 
across all our major geographies 
including Canada, Brazil, Mexico and 
Japan amongst others. It is of crucial 
importance that the business continues 
to add to this cadre of its management 
population throughout 2011.
• Refocused Marketing – Spend was 
increased by 27% over the course 
of 2010 vs. 2009 to £33.3 million. 
The marketing management team 
was reorganised to deliver in-country 
planning and global campaign 
integration moving us away from a 
regional approach. Additionally, a 
number of tasks were brought back 
in-house, including web and search 
engine marketing. Together this 
resulted in a 32% increase in overall 
global enquiries but more importantly 
a dynamic approach to generating 
enquiries in the locations that most 
need them.
• Improved Sales – Signiﬁ cant changes 
to our sales structure, supporting 
systems and improved customer 
targeting, together with comprehensive 
bespoke training and development, 
resulted in deal volumes that were 
12% higher in 2010 than 2009. 
Good progress was made with our 
corporate accounts team, refreshing 
our entire product offering, providing 
targeted marketing support and 
systems, increasing headcount (from 
30 to 79) and making four key senior 
management hires. As a result our 
sales picked up strongly in H2 and this 
team now has momentum into 2011. 
• Streamlined Operations – 2010 saw 
further signiﬁ cant progress with our 
eCommerce rollout, speciﬁ cally TITAN, 
Peoplesoft and Oracle which are now 
ﬁ rmly embedded within the business. 
A signiﬁ cant number of centre routines 
and procedures were redesigned, freeing 
up centre team time to dedicate to 
customers. The centralisation of our back 
ofﬁ ce service functions to our shared

Strategy and objectives 
service centres was completed in Q4. 
It is already delivering both operational 
and ﬁ nancial efﬁ ciencies; for example, 
centralising our IT support desk has 
already resulted in annualised savings 
of £1.5 million. 2011 will see further 
centralisation including parts of the 
marketing, price and inventory functions.
• Delivered Procurement, New Centre 
cost efﬁ ciencies – Over 2010 we 
continued our proactive approach to 
driving cost and realising efﬁ ciency gains 
throughout the business. Centralised 
procurement programmes were put in 
place and key hires made, the beneﬁ ts 
of which we believe will be felt in 2011 
and beyond. Excluding the extra costs 
that have been incurred increasing the 
capacity of the business and some 
speciﬁ c investments, since the second 
half of 2008 annualised savings have 
been made of circa £135 million. 
Operational Review 
Operationally 2010 has been a busy year 
for the Group. During Q4 alone we 
averaged a centre opening a day. Our 
strategy of controlled and disciplined 
growth has resulted in an increase in total 
capacity (including non-consolidated 
workstations) of 9% to 188,567 
workstations in the year and the number of 
actual workstations by 8.8% to 178,084 
workstations as at 31 December 2010. 
The group opened 125 new centres during 
the year with the total number now 
standing at 1,084. Of these, 61 were as a 
result of organic growth of which 37 were 
opened on ﬂ exible, low risk leases.
On a regional basis, revenues and centre 
contribution can be analysed as follows:

* The mature business is deﬁ ned as the performance from centres owned and operated at 1 January 2009.
Americas 
Our business in the Americas comprises 
Canada, USA and the countries of Latin 
America, some 517 centres across 15 
countries. Our main business in the USA 
operates 411 centres. At actual exchange 
rates, the region delivered revenues of 
£436.9 million – up 3.1% on 2009 with 
average mature occupancy of 80% during 
the period (2009: 79%). During the year, 
we added 46 centres which contributed 
to the increase in the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 72,277 in 
2009 to 74,265 in 2010. 
The business made two key acquisitions in 
November 2010; one in Dallas adding nine 
centres; and one in Brazil adding 16. The 
latter acquisition makes us the number 
one workplace provider in that market. 
EMEA
Our business in EMEA encompasses 278 
centres across 49 countries. The region 
delivered revenues of £281.2 million, down 
8.2% on 2009, and achieved an average 
mature occupancy of 77% (2009: 80%). 
During the year we opened 36 centres, 
including 16 through acquisition. This 
contributed to the increase in the average 
number of consolidated workstations from 
34,260 in 2009 to 36,120 in 2010. We 
opened our ﬁ rst centres in Ghana, Oman, 
T anzania and Lithuania (new cities Porto 
and Basel).
Asia Paciﬁ c
Our business in Asia operates in 133 
centres across 16 countries. The region 
delivered revenues of £141.7 million, up 
7.1% on 2009, and achieved an average 
mature occupancy of 80% (2009: 76%). 
During the year we opened 20 centres, 
which increased the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 21,390 in 
2009 to 23,437 in 2010. 
UK
Conditions during 2010 continued to be 
extremely challenging with renewed 
pressure on key performance indicators 
and particularly price. Set against this 
backdrop, the region delivered revenues 
of £178.9 million, down 6.5% on 2009 
and achieved an average mature 
occupancy of 76% (2009: 78%). During

the year, we opened 23 centres of which 
15 were through acquisition. This 
increased the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 33,528 in 
2009 to 34,851 in 2010. 
In Q2 we embarked on a signiﬁ cant 
restructure of our UK lease portfolio; 
working in partnership with our landlords 
many were renegotiated and re-geared 
and only three centres were closed. This 
process concluded in Q3 and will result in 
annualised savings of up to £15 million per 
annum. We are conﬁ dent that in 2011 our 
UK business will return to operating proﬁ t.
Market opportunities – how 
we help our customers 
Our extensive geographic network offers 
a broad range of opportunities for Regus, 
as organisations of all sizes begin to 
seriously address structural inefﬁ ciencies 
in their property portfolio and as pressure 
from workers increases to make work 
more ﬂ exible, in terms of both time and 
geographic location.
Businesses around the world, from the very 
largest to the newest start-up, are 
increasingly recognising the beneﬁ ts of 
being property-light; reducing the number 
of ofﬁ ces they lease. This then enables their 
people to work where they need to, rather 
than where they always have been and for 
their business to realise the immediate 
beneﬁ ts of increased productivity and 
decreased costs. As such, a move to 
Regus is very much a commercial and 
ﬁ nancially driven decision; with the Regus 
advantage regularly delivering savings of 
50-80% vs. a comparable traditional leased 
ofﬁ ce model. We are attractive to any size 
of business and not just small and medium 
sized businesses on a short term basis. 
60% of our customers use us for more 
than 30 months; 40% of our customer 
base is large corporates; and, 20% sole 
traders and micro businesses. 
The scale and density of our ever 
expanding network, our strong track 
record of delivery, and our constant ability 
to innovate both product and service 
mean we are well placed to help our 
customers, both current and future, 
address the challenges of work, wherever 
they need us. For example:-
Yell – UK based business 
directory service
Closed 18 under-utilised sales ofﬁ ces and 
transferred circa.700 sales consultants to 
Regus through our Businessworld model. 
This approach is more cost effective, 
lower risk, ﬂ exible, sustainable and is 
gradually increasing productivity as less 
time is spent commuting and working in 
poorly equipped places. 
7-11 – Leading US franchised 
food retailer
Since year end we have signed a deal with 
7-11 whereby they will close more than 35 
under-utilised regional ofﬁ ces. More than 
250 franchise managers will use the Regus 
network establishing ﬂ exible zone ofﬁ ces in 
Regus centres coupled with 250 days of 
meeting rooms per month and several 
hundred Businessworld cards. 7-11 will 
reduce overhead by eliminating small ofﬁ ces 
from their property portfolio and franchise 
managers will have more time to spend with 
their customers as they leverage more than 
400 Regus business centres.
AT&T – Leading telecommunications 
service provider
Use Regus ofﬁ ces in 18 countries 
including Canada, China, Vietnam, 
Denmark and Peru. Coupled with 500+ 
businessworld cards AT&T rely on Regus 
to ensure ﬂ exibility and speed of response 
especially when working on major new 
contracts in new or challenging markets.
Network growth 
In an ever more mobile, nomadic world of 
work, our primary asset, our business 
centres, will remain the foundation for our 
growth. Indeed it is our extensive 
network, virtually impossible to replicate in 
the medium term, which is so attractive to 
our customers and prospects and from 
which we will create signiﬁ cant 
shareholder value.
A larger network is necessary because:
• Our addressable market grows; locally 
from the businesses immediately 
surrounding the new location and 
globally for multinational businesses that 
want to do business in that location;
• We can leverage operational efﬁ ciencies;
• Additional brand exposure;
• We become an ever more attractive 
partner to other high proﬁ le global 
brands; and
• The barriers to competitive entry 
become greater. 
As such continued growth is core to our 
strategy.
It is important to state that our growth 
strategy is based upon making our past 
successes repeatable. We focus on 
projects that we can do again and again, 
moving us from one level to the next. 
Growth is always low risk and balanced. It 
is never growth for its own sake.
The acquisitions we have made and the 
organic growth which has happened 
alongside have expanded our served and 
addressable market. We now have 1,084 
centres worldwide
Outlook
Against a tough economic backdrop the 
business delivered solid ﬁ nancial results in 
2010, driven almost entirely by execution 
of a range of key strategic initiatives; we 
have seen little beneﬁ t from any economic 
upturn. We have continued to invest in 
growth, mature margins have held up well 
and cash ﬂ ow continued to be strong, 
reﬂ ecting the underlying health of 
the business.
We remain cautious on the economy, 
however we have been encouraged by 
recent positive trends that reﬂ ect the 
continued strategic delivery of the group. In 
2011 we are well positioned for a year of 
solid revenue growth business improvement 
with strong underlying cash-ﬂ ow generation.
Arguably the recession of the last two years 
has been good for our business; it made us 
take a long hard look at everything we did, 
improve it and in doing so we have been 
transformed. That we have emerged from 
2010 for the better is a testament to the 
hard work and dedication of our global 
team of highly motivated individuals. We 
have restructured and streamlined our 
management; we have grown and opened 
up new markets; we have continued to 
innovate; we have radically improved our 
sales and marketing; and we have 
continued to automate and improve our 
processes. We are a better business than 
we were when the recession started and 
we will realise the beneﬁ ts of the many 
improvements made over the years to 
come.
Finally, I would like to thank our employees, 
customers, shareholders, suppliers and all 
other partners for their continuing support. 
We look forward to an improved 2011 and 
the opportunity to grow our business and 
in doing so lead our industry.

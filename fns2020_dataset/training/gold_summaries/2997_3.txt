Annual Report & Accounts 2004
Chairman’s Statement by David Newton
It is a pleasure to report a sixth successive annual
increase in adjusted earnings per share.
Financial review
On turnover up 4.7% at £155.7 million (2003: £148.7
million), total operating profit increased by 22.0% to
£5.77 million (2003: £4.73 million), whilst pre-tax
profit was 26.0% ahead at £5.13 million (2003: £4.07
million), despite a £0.4 million increase in pension
costs. Basic earnings per share advanced by 30.8% 
to 39.9p (2003: 30.5p). If 2003’s £0.50 million
exceptional reorganisation costs are disregarded, 
the increases in operating profit, pre-tax profit and
earnings per share are 10.4%, 12.3% and 15.0%,
respectively.
Year end equity shareholders’ funds increased by 8.1%
to £24.04 million (2003: £22.24 million), representing
net assets per share of 297.7p (2003: 275.4p). Net
debt increased slightly to £5.76 million (2003: £5.62
million), giving gearing of 24.0% (2003: 25.2%). Net
interest payable is similar to last year at £0.65 million
(2003: £0.66 million) and was covered 8.9 times
(2003: 7.1 times) by profit before interest and tax.
Dividends
A final dividend per share of 9.0p (2003: 7.5p), up
20.0%, is proposed, payable on 21 January 2005 to
shareholders on the register at close of business on
17 December 2004, with an ex-dividend date of 
15 December 2004.
Together with the interim dividend per share of 
4.5p (2003: 4.0p), proposed dividends per share 
are 17.4% higher at 13.5p (2003: 11.5p), covered 
3.0 times (2003: 2.7 times, or 3.0 times if exceptional
items are disregarded).
If approved at the AGM to be held at 11.30 a.m. 
on 6 January 2005 at the Crown Hotel, Wetheral,
Carlisle, the final dividend will be paid on 21 January
2005 to shareholders.
Business
Agriculture achieved an operating profit of £5.73
million (2003: £5.03 million, after one-off costs 
of £0.26 million) on a turnover of £124.4 million 
(2003: £120.8 million). This outcome reflected
further improvements in the performance of UK
The results we have achieved are due to
the commitment

animal feed and fertiliser outweighing a decreased
contribution from US animal feed after an
exceptionally good previous year.
Food’s operating profit was halved at £0.27 million 
(2003: £0.60 million) on a turnover of £22.0 million 
(2003: £20.3 million) following the exceptionally
large rise in raw material costs, in particular in the
first half.
Engineering broke even (2003: made an operating
loss of £0.68 million, after one-off costs of £0.24
million) on an increased turnover of £9.3 million
(2003: £7.6 million). This result benefited from the
closure of Keytor in March 2003 and the subsequent
consolidation of R Hind from three sites to one.
Board
In May 2004, Ian C. Carr died, aged 75, following a
brief illness. Ian Carr, a great grandson of Jonathan
Dodgson Carr, who founded Carr’s in 1836, was
appointed Chairman of Carr’s in April 1964, aged 35,
and remained in that position until his retirement on
his 70th birthday in August 1998. Thereafter, he was
President of Carr’s, representing the Company on
many occasions. Ian was a model of good practice,
acting as an example of what we should all aspire to
be. Together with his wife, Rilla, they formed a
partnership which was well known locally and one
we shall all miss.
In September 2004, Lord Inglewood, aged 53, 
was appointed a non-executive Director of Carr’s.
Richard Inglewood was a Conservative member of
the European Parliament for ten years until his
retirement in 2004, and has been a member of the
House of Lords since 1989. He brings to the Board
wide experience, in particular of EU and
Westminster politics, allied with a knowledge of
farming and of Carr’s north west England heartland.
Outlook
Despite having to absorb higher energy costs across
the Group, mainly for electricity, the current year is
expected to show further growth in all three
Divisions, especially in Food, where gross margins in
flour have returned to a more normal level following
unprecedented wheat price increases last year. With
the growth of the existing business combined with
the Meneba UK acquisition, the Board considers that
Carr’s is well placed for further progress.

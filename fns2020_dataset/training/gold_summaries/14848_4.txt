Star Energy at a Glance
WITH 156 EMPLOYEES, WE 
OWN AND OPERATE THE  
10 BCF GAS STORAGE 
FACILITY AT HUMBLY 
GROVE AND 26 OIL AND 
GAS FIELDS IN THE WEALD 
BASIN AND THE EAST 
MIDLANDS AREAS OF  
THE UK. 
Our portfolio of onshore UK fields 
includes five potential gas stores,  
which we are actively developing
to the planning application stage.
We have recently acquired an 
opportunity to assess the viability
of a depleted offshore gas field for
gas storage purposes.
Gas Storage
The fundamentals for additional gas storage in the UK remain 
firm with increasing import dependence in the context of UK gas 
storage capacity as a percentage of annual demand well below 
our European peers. 
Star Energy remains focussed on developing those fields in its 
portfolio which have geology suited to gas storage, with current 
development activities on Albury Phase 1, Gainsborough, Welton 
and Bletchingley. Our intention is to contract future gas stores  
to blue chip customers, securing a stable base cash flow, while  
retaining the ability to share in the upside in the longer term  
if winter/summer gas price differentials widen.
Oil & Electricity 
Star Energy continues to be the second largest onshore oil and 
gas producer, producing 4,595 boepd for 2006. The produced gas 
is used to generate electricity.
The portfolio of 26 oil and gas fields provides the Group with  
a strong cash flow, helping to fund the development of the 
Groupâ€™s gas storage opportunities. Our strategy is to continue  
the development of this portfolio to maintain the associated  
cash flow.

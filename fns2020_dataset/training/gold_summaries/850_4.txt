From 2013 – new structure supports additional growth
From 2013, reporting will be on a geographic rather than divisional basis. This reflects our new structure, introduced 
to strengthen our customer focus and so maximise potential growth opportunities. The 2012 figures on this basis are 
shown below. Restated 2010 and 2011 comparatives can be found on page 34 and on our website. 
Overview
Americas Our largest geography , with 
the best balance across our markets. 
Our oil & gas position is growing, with 
recent investment in Brazil; we are the 
market leader in mineable oil sands; 
a leader in consulting and EPCM in 
mining; have good positions in solar 
and bioprocess; and are a major 
player in the diverse E&I market. See 
page 30.
Europe Principally UK-based with 
some smaller activities elsewhere. 
Strong position in oil & gas, with 
market-leading position in North Sea 
brownfield activities. Leading position 
in the nuclear market, where services 
range from new build right through 
to decommissioning.  See page 31.
Growth Regions We expect each 
of our geographies to grow, but see 
Growth Regions as the area with 
the greatest potential. We want to 
apply our global skills base to create 
a sustainable, localised presence in 
these regions.  See page 32.

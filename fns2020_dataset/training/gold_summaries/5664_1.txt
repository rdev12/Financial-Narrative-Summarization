Group Overview
“In 2009 the Group’s advantages, 
particularly its proximity to China, low 
cost base and business diversification, 
underpinned a robust performance in 
the face of a marked industry downturn. 
Swift measures taken by the 
management allowed us to mitigate the 
weaker demand and lower prices and 
deliver an improved performance in the 
second-half of 2009. During the year we 
were pleased to be able to use our 
strong balance sheet to grow our 
commodity base by acquisition. Our 
entry into copper and cobalt, with the 
purchase of CAMEC, opens up an 
exciting new opportunity and 
implements our strategy of 
diversification. We are increasingly 
confident that strong growth in 
emerging markets and a recovery 
coming in the rest of the world will 
sustain growth in the demand for our 
products in 2010.”

We are pleased with the Group’s financial and operational 
performance in 2009, which exceeded our initial expectations held 
at the beginning of the year. The Group’s resilience reflected its 
strategic location, its low cost advantages and the benefits of our 
integrated business capabilities. Our performance also reflected the 
success of measures implemented by management in response to 
the general downturn. In addition, the Group benefited from the 
strength of the Chinese economy and its robust metals demand. 
Commodity prices were generally stronger than we originally 
anticipated. Going into 2010, conditions for recovery in our main 
markets now seem to be firmly established, although we recognise 
that there remain some points of vulnerability in the global economy.
In late 2008 and into 2009 management responded rapidly and 
decisively to the crisis, cutting ferroalloys and iron ore production to 
match customer demand, reducing inventories and receivables, 
re-evaluating capital expenditure and focusing on the control of 
costs. Progressively during 2009, management was able to advance 
production levels across those businesses, and particularly in 
Kazakhstan where the labour force had been retained through the 
downturn. By the end of 2009, production had been restored to 
effectively full available capacity across most of our principal 
product lines. In 2009, the Group’s resilient operating performance 
and balance sheet strength opened up opportunities to diversify the 
business. 
The results achieved are a particular credit to the operational 
management in Kazakhstan. We are also grateful for the 
commitment of the workforce through the challenging times and to 
the efforts of our Sales & Marketing operation. The Group offers to 
all its employees its sincere thanks for their loyalty, commitment and 
continued efforts. In 2010 we are reviewing wage rates for our 
Kazakhstan employees across each of the Divisions.
We remain positive on the medium- and long-term prospects for the 
growth of the Chinese and Russian economies and elsewhere in 
emerging markets. The prospects for ENRC in these markets are 
enhanced by structural capacity shortages, notably in China, and 
supply constraints that are expected to emerge with an economic 
recovery. ENRC in Kazakhstan is well positioned to exploit 
opportunities in China and Russia. For the Group this is 
supplemented by the acquisitions of CAMEC, and more recently, 
Chambishi, which offer geographical and commodity diversification 
as well as a broader range of growth opportunities. In addition our 
capital expenditure initiatives are directed towards providing a solid 
platform for growth, inside Kazakhstan and elsewhere around the 
world, to deliver value for all our shareholders. GROUP OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RESERVES CORPORATE INFORMATION

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
2009 Production performance
The Group’s production performance in 2009 was broadly similar to 
2008 for ferroalloys and iron ore, notwithstanding the cutbacks 
initiated by management in Q4 2008, with improved aluminium 
production and electricity generation. Through 2009, the Ferroalloys 
and Iron Ore Divisions experienced a progressive recovery in 
capacity utilisation and sales. In the Ferroalloys Division 2009 
high-carbon ferrochrome production was ahead of 2008 (2009: 
1,073 kt; 2008: 1,054 kt), although weakness in chrome ore sales 
and in the low- and medium-carbon ferrochrome markets persisted. 
By Q4 2009 Kazchrome – the key Kazakhstan business of the 
Ferroalloys Division – had restored its capacity utilisation to 97%. 
In the Iron Ore Division, primary iron ore concentrate production 
progressively recovered through 2009 and was broadly in line with 
2008 (2009: 15,197 kt; 2008: 15,487 kt), although with proportionately 
more saleable concentrate production. Capacity utilisation reached 
97% in Q4 2009 and there was a strong recovery in pellet production 
in H2 2009. In the Alumina and Aluminium Division, 2009 alumina 
production was 1,608 kt, steady at its capacity run rate. Production 
volumes were supported by the long-term alumina contract with 
United Company RUSAL (‘US RUSAL’). Aluminium production 
amounted to 127 kt (2008: 106 kt), with the smelter running at its full 
Phase 1 capacity (125 kt per annum) and with half of the Phase 2 
smelter pots being charged with alumina and put into operation in 
December 2009. Also pleasing was that in 2009 the London Metal 
Exchange (‘LME’) approved the listing of our aluminium ingots.
The Energy Division was bolstered in 2009 by a recovery in demand 
and reinstated capacity, as well as the onset of adverse winter 
weather in Q4 2009. Coal extraction rose to 20,059 kt (2008: 
19,790 kt) whilst electricity generation increased to 13,478 GWh 
(2008: 11,640 GWh). Logistics maintained its transportation tonnage 
broadly steady on 2008 (2009: 58,181 kt; 2008: 58,549 kt). In 
addition, we had the first-time contribution of copper and cobalt in 
the Other Non-ferrous Division.
2009 Financial performance
The Group’s 2009 Underlying EBITDA (which excludes the benefit of 
the one-off Kazakhstani tenge devaluation gain, US$210 million) 
declined 65% to US$1,462 million (2008: US$4,161 million). The 
decline was predominantly driven by significantly lower average 
commodity prices resulting in a fall in revenue of 44% to $3,831 
million (2008: US$6,823 million), notably for ferrochrome, iron ore 
and aluminium. 
The impact of the decline in revenue was partially offset by 
reductions in the Cost of sales, 7%, and total costs, 17%. The 
reductions were driven by management’s cost saving initiatives, 
along with a reduction in Distribution costs and favourably impacted 
by the general weakening of the Kazakhstani tenge as some 75% of 
the Group’s Cost of sales were denominated in the local currency. 
Adversely impacting Underlying EBITDA were inventory destocking, 
with higher inventory costs carried over from 2008, losses incurred 
on foreign currency hedges and the introduction in 2009 of a Mineral 
Extraction Tax (‘MET’) in Kazakhstan.
Management maintained its ongoing focus on working capital and in 
2009 achieved a reduction in inventories to levels that better 
matched the lower sales volumes, while managing credit risks such 
that we have had no material default among our customers. We had 
a strong balance sheet with gross available funds of US$1,021 
million as at 31 December 2009 (2008: US$2,768 million), including 
cash and cash equivalents of US$830 million (2008: US$2,493 
million). During 2009 we paid a total of US$1,144 million for 
acquisitions, while property, plant and equipment expenditure 
amounted to US$912 million (2008: US$1,479 million). Outstanding 
debt as at 31 December 2009 amounted to US$428 million (2008: 
US$727 million), principally a trade finance facility to be repaid by 
December 2010. Operating cash flow was significantly impacted by 
market conditions, decreasing 56%, resulting in a net inflow of 
US$1,209 million (2008: US$2,766 million). We see our balance sheet 
and positive operating cash flow as key competitive advantages in 
the current environment and continue to manage this position 
prudently. 
Health & safety
Health and safety is a key priority for the Group. In 2009 we 
intensified our efforts with the implementation of a new safety 
management system which has improved the quality and coverage 
of our reporting. The total number of fatalities unfortunately rose, 
totalling 12 in 2009 (2008: 9). Any deaths are regrettable to us and 
we express our condolences to the families involved. The number of 
work-related injuries decreased to 64 (2008: 74). The Lost Time 
Injury Frequency Rate (‘LTIFR’) declined to 0.63 (2008: 0.68) per one 
million hours worked. As the fatalities show, we still have some way 
to go before we can feel satisfied with our safety performance. The 
Group focused on improving its approach to health and safety based 
on its adoption, in 2008, of an aspiration of ‘zero injuries’ and in 
2009 launched a Safety Culture Improvement project which will be 
rolled out in full through 2010. 08

Group Overview
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in 2009 was a little below 2008, amounting to 
US$1,147 million (2008: US$1,294 million). 2009 reflected the revision 
of our project plans in response to the changed market environment, 
with priority given to replacement and productivity capital expenditure. 
Project highlights in 2009 included: Ferroalloys Division – a second 
700 kt per annum pelletiser (operational July 2009); Alumina and 
Aluminium Division – the construction of the 125 kt per annum Phase 
2 of the aluminium smelter, to be completed in Q2 2010; and Energy 
Division – the installation of overburden stripping equipment, 
completed in Q1 2010, and an additional power unit. In July 2009, for 
commercial reasons, we withdrew from the concession for the 
construction of the China Gateway Project. 
In 2010 we reviewed our capital expenditure projects and reflected 
both our improved confidence in the future and the broadening 
range of opportunities. Only the ferroalloys expansion at Aksu 
currently remains a deferred project. Including new projects, mostly 
arising on acquisitions, total ‘in progress’ and ‘under review’ capital 
expenditure amounts to US$5.8 billion. Projects include: Ferroalloys 
Division – expansion and replacement of smelting capacity at 
Aktobe; Iron Ore Division – pelletiser and DRI/HBI plant, a conveyor 
complex and a mine expansion; Alumina and Aluminium Division – 
Phase 2 of the aluminium smelter, an alumina expansion and an 
anode plant; Energy Division – construction/reconstruction of two 
power units and new generating capacity of 1,200 MW. In the Other 
Non-ferrous Division we have reviewed the capital expenditure 
following the completion of the acquisition and have increased the 
planned capital expenditure on the copper and cobalt operations to 
US$455 million.
 
For the full year 2010, capital expenditure is expected to amount  
to approximately US$1.5 billion, including US$0.4 billion for  
capital repairs.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions are an important element of our strategy. By leveraging 
our knowledge of mineral extraction, as well as our integrated 
energy and logistics capacity where possible, the Group will look  
to diversify its presence into other natural resources, both in the 
Eurasian region and elsewhere in the world. The Group remains 
interested in its core products, ferrochrome and iron ore, but is  
also looking at opportunities in other industrial metals, certain 
precious metals and in the energy sector, with a focus on low  
cost opportunities and projects close to being cash generative.  
We continue to maintain our tight financial discipline in  
evaluating opportunities.
In February 2009, we completed the acquisition from a related party 
of a 25% interest in Shubarkol Komir JSC (‘Shubarkol’) for a cash 
consideration of US$200 million less 25% of net debt. We believe 
that the acquisition of this stake strengthens the Group’s integrated 
business model, through securing a reliable and cost effective 
supply of semi-coke and relatively high quality thermal coal, and 
also enhances the Group’s position as a low cost producer. On 9 
November 2009 the Group declared unconditional the acquisition of 
CAMEC for a cash consideration of US$931 million. With CAMEC we 
acquired an African-focused emerging market mining company, with 
operations centred on copper and cobalt, a trucking and haulage 
businesses and a portfolio of potential development projects in coal, 
bauxite and fluorspar and platinum prospects. 
On 18 February 2010, the Group announced a cash offer to related 
parties for the acquisition of Enya Holdings BV (‘Enya’) which holds a 
90% interest in Chambishi Metals PLC (‘Chambishi’), a Zambian 
copper and cobalt producer, together with Comit Resources FZE 
(‘Comit’), a Dubai-based marketing and sales company. The 
aggregate cash consideration amounts to US$300 million. The 
Chambishi acquisition was completed in early April and the 
transaction overall was expected to be completed in April.
Taxation 
With effect from January 2009, the Republic of Kazakhstan 
introduced a new Tax Code including a reduction in the rate of 
Corporate Income Tax (‘CIT’) to 20% in 2009, the abolition of 
Royalties in conjunction with the introduction of MET and revisions 
to the basis of calculation of Excess Profits Tax (‘EPT’). In November 
2009, in response to the adverse changes in the global economic 
environment, the 2009 CIT and MET rates were extended for the 
period from 2010 to 2012. In 2009 the Group’s Effective Tax Rate 
was 26.2% – including a dividend withholding tax and EPT – broadly 
in line with previous guidance.
Exchange rate
On 4 February 2009 the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
announced that the tenge would be devalued against the US dollar 
by approximately 25% to about KZT150/US$. On 30 December 2009 
the Central Bank of Kazakhstan announced that, going forward, it 
would seek to maintain a wider currency range of KZT127.5/US$ to 
KZT165/US$. If the tenge were to appreciate this would add to the 
reported cost base of the Group, as it represents approximately 75% 
of the Group’s Kazakhstani businesses Cost of sales. 
Industry overview
The key driver of ferrochrome demand remains stainless steel 
production which in 2009 was believed to be 26.2 million tonnes

ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
worldwide, below its 2007 peak of 28.5 million tonnes and around 
1% lower than the 26.4 million tonnes in 2008. Around 65% of 
ferrochrome is consumed by the stainless steel industry. Like many 
other metals markets the largest growth in recent years, in terms of 
both consumption and production of stainless steel, has been 
China, with the country emerging as the world leader in stainless 
steel. With China’s economic growth forecast to continue in 2010 
and beyond this situation is set to remain. In 2007, the record year 
for stainless steel production, China accounted for some 7.5 million 
tonnes; in 2010 China is forecast to produce almost 11 million 
tonnes. Even with only a limited recovery in the traditional markets 
2010 could emerge as a strong year for stainless steel production. 
Although fiscal stimulus packages are likely to be reduced during 
2010, and as initiatives such as car scrappage schemes are ended, 
some recovery in developed world consumption is forecast to 
continue. We had said in the past that a sustainable recovery in 
prices will only be possible when demand results in a significant 
increase in capacity utilisation in the ferrochrome industry. The 
recent price increases and more confidence in the economic 
recovery again turned attention to supply side constraints, such as 
electricity and logistics in South Africa. Overall, with uncertainties 
remaining for both demand and supply, some volatility can be 
expected to continue, but the overall outlook is positive.
For iron ore, our major competitive advantage is our low cost access 
to Northwest China, which facilitated a doubling of our shipments in 
2009 versus 2008. The ongoing industrialisation of our traditional 
markets in Northwest China, along with the improved access offered 
by the new China Gateway rail link in due course, will provide us with 
further opportunities to develop iron ore sales in China. In addition, 
the current improvement in the Russian steel industry is providing us 
with a recovery in iron ore sales volumes to The Magnitogorsk Iron 
and Steel Works Open Joint Stock Company (‘MMK’). 
Also, due to our low cost logistics position, as well as steady 
demand, shipments of alumina to Rusal in Russia were not materially 
affected by market conditions in 2009. However, in 2010, 
proportionately more of our alumina production will be absorbed by 
our aluminium smelter with the launch of Phase 2. 
In energy, our low cost position and market insight in electricity 
allowed us both to sell greater volumes into the region’s recovering 
market and utilise our own secure power in value-added metals 
production. Our current position in copper and cobalt is limited. 
However, we believe that the longer term demand fundamentals  
of copper are sound. This is underpinned by a weakening longer 
term supply outlook in the face of increasing demand from  
emerging markets.
Outlook 
Our confidence for 2010, in the sustainability of Chinese domestic 
demand growth and in the growth of other emerging markets, has 
improved, and is likely to offer a sustained increase in commodities 
demand. In addition, although signals remain mixed and short-term 
prospects are subdued, there are signs of stabilisation and even 
some growth emerging in the United States and Europe, whilst the 
outlook for Russia is better for 2010. 
We anticipate that product prices for the full year 2010 will be ahead 
of the averages that prevailed in 2009. We expect that production in 
2010 for our principal products will be at, or near capacity. 
Into 2010, with near full capacity production restored across our 
Kazakhstani businesses, maintaining our 2009 cost level will be 
difficult. We would anticipate some increase in costs: labour costs 
are set to rise broadly in line with local inflation; raw material and 
other input costs are increasing more significantly as the industry 
and global economy recover; whilst there is also the potential 
negative impact of a tenge appreciation. We do, however, expect to 
retain our advantaged relative low cost position. 
Save as set out in this report, there have been no material events, 
transactions or changes to the financial position of the Group since 
31 December 2009.

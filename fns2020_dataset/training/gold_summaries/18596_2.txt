GoldBridges’ main asset is its 100% interest in the 
Sekisovskoye gold mine in North East Kazakhstan 
with probable reserves of 2.26Moz. The Company 
has a strategy to deliver transformational growth  
at Sekisovskoye, as it completes the move from an 
open pit mine to a solely underground operation. 
The mining licence for Sekisovskoye is valid until  
18 July 2020 with a contractual right to extend after 
this period. 
In addition to Sekisovskoye, the Company has 
been awarded the tender to conduct further 
testing at the site of Karasuyskoye ore fields and 
this is expected to lead to a sub-soil user contract 
in the near term. The site encompasses an area 
of approximately 198km
2
, and geological data 
purchased by the Company indicates that there are 
several mineralised zones, each with the potential 
to contain significant gold resources. 
Throughout 2014, the Company worked on a 
Competent Persons Report (CPR), and the results  
of the findings were announced in November 2014, 
and the significant highlights are summarised in 
the mineral resources statement on page 12. 
During 2015 the Company reviewed its approach 
to mining Sekisovskoye, and decided to adopt  
a decline strategy rather than sinking a shaft. The 
development plan was adjusted accordingly with  
a revised mining method and an updated capital 
expenditure budget. 
The Company’s principal shareholders, the 
Assaubayev family (through their investment 
vehicle African Resources Limited), have provided 
strong financial support and commitment to the 
current development of the Company. The family’s 
shareholding currently stands at 61.69%.
Our focus 
The focus in 2015 shifted from production from the open pit to the 
underground development. Inevitability, this has had an effect on 
current year results as time, money and resources were spent on 
re-positioning the Company to unlock the significant potential of the 
underground mine. The key highlights are documented below: 
Welcome to GoldBridges 
Global Resources Plc
Once the underground 
mine is operating at full 
capacity, the Company 
expects gold poured 
annually to increase  
from the current level 
achieved in 2015 to 
100,000oz by 2019, 
with the initial increase 
expected in H2 2016.

 ■ Detailed plans developed internally using advice from 
external consultants leading to a revised approach to 
the development of the mine and a reduction in capex 
requirement – expansion capex now reduced to an external 
funding requirement of US$20-US$30m, of which US$10m 
was raised in 2016.
 ■ Approximately 570m of development undertaken on second  
 transportation decline to date.
 ■ Transportation decline on track for completion by May 2016  
 allowing an underground production run rate  
 of 500,000t/year.
 ■ The Company is actively pursuing the balance of funds,  
 the expected requirement is in H2 2017. 
 ■ Loss of US$(10.2m) (2014: US$(0.25m)), and a total 
comprehensive loss to include exchange differences  
of US$(40m) (2014: US$(9m)).
 ■ Equity raising of US$5.1m completed in April 2015.
 ■ Turnover decreased in the year to US$24m (2014: US$35.2m), 
 principally a reflection of the time and resources spent  
 on the development of the underground workings. 
 ■ 20,890 oz of gold sold (2014: 27,959oz), a reduction  
 of 7,069oz. 
 ■ Decrease in finished gold stockholding to 1,819oz  
 (2014: 7,307oz), a reflection of decreased production.
 ■ Average gold price achieved (including silver as a by- 
 product), US$1,151/oz, (2014: US$1,258/oz). 
 ■ Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation  
 and amortisation), of US$(2.3m) (2014: positive US$5.3m).
 ■ Net asset value decreased as the Kazakh Tenge devalued  
 against the US dollar – however, no practical impact on the  
 Company’s value.
 ■ Gold poured 15,534oz, (2014: 32,994oz) a 52.9% decrease  
 year-on-year, principally due to the winding down of the  
 open pit and development of the underground.
 ■ Gold grade 1.12g/t, (2014: 1.81g/t). The reduction is  
 a reflection of the processing of the lower grade ore from  
 the open pit and use of low grade ore stock piles, in order  
 to maximise throughput while the underground  
 developments continue. 
 ■ Cash cost of production US$837/oz (2014: US$834/oz). 
 ■ Gold recovery rate 76.04% (2014: 83.3%) was due to variable  
 grade and ore composition, it is expected to increase to  
 over 80% after plant improvements.

Financial Statement
In January 2015, the Company was awarded the 
tender to perform further confirmatory testing 
in order to gain the subsoil user contract to the 
Karasuyskoye Ore Fields. The final subsoil contract 
terms and conditions, including the new financial 
incentives now offered specifically to the Company 
through the state programme on forced industrial-
innovative development (SFIID), have taken longer 
to finalise than originally anticipated but should  
be forthcoming in 2016. These additional terms  
are still expected to include investment incentives 
and tax reductions. 
The geological data that the Company acquired 
indicates that there are several mineralised zones 
at Karasuyskoye and this leads the Company to 
believe that this project has the potential to contain 
significant gold resources. The Company plans to 
validate this geological data by twinning previous 
drill holes and undertaking additional metallurgical 
test work. This work will facilitate the preparation of 
a feasibility study and an independent Competent 
Persons Report (CPR) to international standards  
in the longer term. 
During 2015, the Company performed data 
validation exercises to confirm the accuracy of the 
existing geological data. The results obtained did 
not indicate that the value of the asset as shown  
in the financial statements should be impaired.
The Company was granted all required approvals 
to include legal, environmental and economic 
expertise reviews. The project, including the 
working programme, was updated for the technical 
comments of the Central Mining Exploration and 
Development Commission of Kazakhstan. The 
subsoil contract is expected to be approved  
in H2 2016.
On completion of a (CPR), the Company envisages 
progressing towards mining from the Karasuyskoye 
Ore Fields, primarily using cash generated from 
existing operations. 
The Sekisovskoye deposit is the Company’s 
flagship asset and is located close to the village of 
Sekisovka, approximately 40km from the North East 
Kazakhstan regional capital, Ust Kamenogorsk. 
The mineral rights at Sekisovskoye are held by 
a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company, TOO 
Sekisovskoye, and the processing plant is held by 
the 100% owned subsidiary of the Company TOO 
Altai Ken-Bayitu. 
The Sekisovskoye deposit was discovered in 1833 
with surface mining taking place between 1833  
and 1847, 1932 to 1935, and 1943 to 1946. 
From 1975 to 1986, a range of exploration work 
was carried out and between 1978 and 1982 
“AltaiZoloto” of the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Industry, 
KazSSR, mined the oxidised area of the ore body. 
In 2003, under Hambledon Mining’s ownership, 
further exploration work was undertaken and gold 
production from the mine and processing plant 
commenced in 2008. In 2015, 15,534oz of gold  
was produced. 
In 2014, the Company released the findings 
of the mining consultant, Venmyn Deloitte’s 
Competent Persons Report on the mine, which 
demonstrated JORC reserves of 2.26Moz, JORC 
resources of 5.14Moz and a development plan to 
increase annual gold production to 100,000oz. 
This is to be achieved by accessing higher grade 
reserves through the continued development 
of the underground mine and by increasing the 
processing plant’s throughput capacity from  
the current 850,000t per year to 1 million tonnes  
per year.
During 2015, the open pit mine closed, and 
increased decline access to the deeper underground 
reserves has commenced at Sekisovskoye, with 
production from the underground mine planned  
to increase incrementally between 2016 and 2019.

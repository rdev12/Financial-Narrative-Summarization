CHIEF EXECuTIvE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
“The management 
team remains 
committed to 
improving the 
performance of all 
areas of the business 
still further. ” 
Ian Bowles,  
Chief Executive Officer
“The MAPS Healthroster Solution 
stood out somewhat from the 
competitors – staff liked it and 
felt it was intuitive and liked the 
company’s understanding of the 
differences and complexities of 
rostering in different areas of the 
hospital, whether it be Midwifery 
A&E or a general ward.”
Assistant Director of Nursing, 
Addenbrooke’s Hospital, 
Cambridge university Hospitals 
NHS Foundation Trust
I am pleased to announce that 2008 
saw a further improvement in the 
performance of the Company.
OPERATIONAl REvIEw
In the half-year report I suggested 
that the outlook for the Company 
was positive, a view now confirmed 
by the year-end results. 
In FY08, we made our first 
acquisition, signed three new 
partnership agreements and 
strengthened the team, attracting 
more talented and experienced 
individuals to the Company. As 
our reputation grows, so we 
are receiving unsolicited job 
applications from people employed 
within the market sectors in which 
we operate, who are keen to join 
our team in a variety of roles. We 
have also received requests from 
sales led organisations who are 
keen to partner with us. We are 
able to be selective about the 
people we take on as employees 
and the companies with which we 
will work as partners in each case.
The management team remains 
committed to improving the 
performance of all areas of the 
business still further. In particular, 
we will continue to invest in and 
grow those areas of the business 
which showed the most positive 
momentum during FY08. The 
continued improvement in 
execution and a relentless expense 
management focus will enable us 
to continue the drive into FY09  
and beyond.
MARkETS 
Market conditions in our chosen 
sectors remain resilient and we 
believe we are to a large extent 
shielded for a number of reasons as 
outlined in this business review.
HEAl THCARE
At the half-year, our Healthcare 
business had become our fastest 
growing sector. By the end of the 
financial year, it had also become 
the largest in terms of revenue 
generation, accounting for 57% of 
our total revenue.
During the year the MAPS 
Healthroster customer base of 
NHS Trusts increased from 15 to 
38 across Acute, Primary Care and 
Mental Health Trusts. This still 
represents less than 10% of the 
addressable Acute, Mental Health 
and Primary Care market in the UK. 
We will continue to expand into the 
sector, both in the UK and overseas. 
It is significant that the increase 
in customers during the year 
was more than double the total 
number of Healthcare customers 
secured over the previous 
three years. In all cases MAPS 
Healthroster was selected because  Manpower Software Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 05
of a combination of its unique 
functionality, the size of potential 
time and cost savings identified, its 
intuitive nature, and our growing 
track record for the delivery of a 
Trust-wide solution. As reported 
previously, two of our customers 
have been selected by the 
National Audit Office as examples 
of good practice in managing the 
use of temporary nursing staff. 
During the year we also gained as 
customers both the first Academic 
Teaching Trust to be created in the 
UK (Imperial College Healthcare 
NHS Trust) and an established 
ambulance service (Isle of Wight 
NHS Primary Care Trust).
We have successfully integrated 
MAPS Healthroster with the 
National Human Resources and 
Payroll System – NHS Electronic 
Staff Records (“ESR”). This 
means that Trusts using MAPS 
Healthroster can now pay staff 
electronically without the need 
for paper timesheets. This gives 
them significant time savings and 
dramatically increases the accuracy 
of payment records. Over 100,000 
shifts are now being accurately 
processed each month using 
MAPS Healthroster.
We are also increasing our 
coverage in the NHS as we move 
from nurse rostering into all 
medical staff groups.
Our commitment to the NHS 
was further strengthened by the 
acquisition of Key Information 
Technology Systems Limited, the 
leading temporary staffing solutions 
provider. Having now merged the 
two customer bases, Manpower 
Software is represented in 
approximately 33% of all NHS Trusts 
across the UK, a position we plan to 
build on in the current fiscal year. 
Our NHS customers are generating 
strong referenceable results and 
more Trusts are evaluating our 
rostering and temporary staffing 
solutions under contract. We have 
increased further the resources 
allocated to the healthcare sector 
to take continuing advantage of the 
momentum in the market for MAPS 
Health Suite.
We anticipate that the increasing 
spotlight on improving productivity 
throughout the NHS, controlling 
temporary staff spend and 
improving patient care, allied 
with the Company’s increased 
geographical expansion 
throughout the UK and the 
completion of current pilots, will 
lead to continued growth in sales. 
dEFENCE
We have a long-standing and 
vital relationship with the Defence 
market, which remains a key 
strategic sector for the Company. 
“At the first half of the year  
our healthcare business  
had become our fastest 
growing sector.” 
“Throughout the time we have 
been involved with Manpower 
Software, we have been 
particularly impressed with their 
customer focused approach and 
the way they have engaged with 
us in an open and constructive 
manner that have delivered 
considerable benefit to our 
business. We now look forward  
to furthering the relationship  
as we embark upon more 
ambitious projects seeking to 
bring greater coherency to our 
force preparation and generation 
processes.”
Brigadier M F N Mans, 
HQ land, British Army
“We have a long-standing  
and vital relationship with  
the Defence market, which 
remains a key strategic sector 
for the Company.”
“The Company continues 
to supply some of the 
world’s foremost maritime 
organisations in shipping, 
offshore engineering, cruise 
and ferry.” Manpower Software Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 06
CHIEF EXECuTIvE OFFICER’S STATEMENT continued
“After an extensive evaluation we 
selected Manpower Software’s 
Maritime Suite because of the 
company’s proven expertise and 
implementation experience in 
large, complex organisations.”
Len Webster, IMS Engagement 
Manager, HR Systems, Acergy.
Over the past year Manpower 
Software has enjoyed considerable 
success with the British Army, 
the RAF, Royal Fleet Auxiliary 
(“RFA”) and the Defence Medical 
Services (“DMS”). The RFA have 
worked closely with the Company 
to exploit the utility of the MAPS 
Defence Suite products, thereby 
enabling their applicability to 
other defence customers. DMS  
are managing medical personnel 
from all three services within their 
MAPS implementation. 
In NATO use of the MAPS 
Defence Suite was extended 
when the NATO Special Forces 
Coordination Centre became the 
latest MAPS user. More generally, 
the Allied Nations are now able 
to receive access to the MAPS 
Force Generation Management 
Tool. It is planned to interface this 
application to a wide range of 
NATO IT systems, enhancing its 
usefulness to the NATO nations  
still further. 
In Asia Pacific, we concluded 
an effective trial of Whole Ship 
Coordination with the Royal 
Australian Navy. 
Over the coming year the Defence 
Sector will focus on expansion within 
the UK MOD, Europe, North America 
and the Asia Pacific region where 
defence spending remains robust.
MARITIME
The Company continues to supply 
some of the world’s foremost 
maritime organisations in shipping, 
offshore engineering, cruise and 
ferry. As a result, we will bring 
to market a new application 
“Onboard” during the current 
fiscal year. “Onboard”, developed 
in conjunction with one of the 
world’s leading container shipping 
companies, where it is being 
deployed before being made 
available to the broader shipping 
market, will provide vessel masters 
with an application for managing 
crew, itinerary and accounts. The 
new application can be deployed 
stand-alone or integrated with 
MAPS Maritime Suite.
At the same time, we have 
identified the Offshore oil and gas 
sector as a potential new source 
of revenue to grow our maritime 
revenues and client base during the 
course of the next two years. 
PARTNERSHIPS
Our partner strategy produced 
positive results during FY08. 
In our Healthcare sector, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers in the UK 
and ACS Healthcare Solutions in 
the USA became official partners of 
Manpower Software. Both partners 
have begun introducing Manpower 
Software into their respective client-
lists for the MAPS Healthroster 
application. In Defence, through 
Singapore Technologies Electronics 
we have supplied a prototype 
of MAPS Defence Suite to the 
Singapore Ministry of Defence. We 
anticipate that these partnerships 
will deliver significant benefits to 
the Company over the coming 
years. We will continue to select 
important partnerships to deliver 
our MAPS software suites into new 
geographical territories.
ClIENT SER vICES
Client Services continues to be a 
fast growing and profitable part of 
our business. We expect continued 
growth in the current fiscal year as 
there is a strong pipeline of work 
to be delivered across all three 
market sectors.
Within Healthcare there are now 
712 wards in 44 Trusts using MAPS 
Healthroster, a 100% increase 
over last year. The Defence 
sector has installations within all 
three Front Line Commands of 
the British Armed Forces (Army, 
Navy and Air Force), where there 
are approximately 3,500 users 
of MAPS Defence Suite. Other 
worldwide installations include 
NATO (Belgium) and the Royal 
Australian Navy (Canberra, 
Australia). The MAPS Maritime 
Suite is being used by twelve  Manpower Software Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 07
different maritime brands to 
manage the workforce planning of 
over 100,000 personnel operating  
on over 500 vessels throughout 
the world.
At the same time as managing 
the expansion of our client base, 
we have maintained high levels of 
client satisfaction with regards to 
our staff, products and effective 
approach to implementation. 
RESEARCH & dEvElOPMENT
The MAPS software platform 
continues to provide the 
foundation for our product 
portfolio, with MAPS Health 
Suite, MAPS Defence Suite and 
MAPS Maritime Suite customised 
and branded for their particular 
market sector. In each core sector, 
enhanced releases of the MAPS 
software platform have been 
developed, with an increasing focus 
on delivering functionality to users 
via the web. The R&D organisation 
once again renewed its IS9001 
TickIT accreditation and its 
Microsoft Gold Partner status. We 
continue to invest in both product 
development and delivering tools 
to enable successful applications 
development and deployment. 
ACQuISITIONS
During the year, Manpower Software 
successfully completed its first 
acquisition, that of Key Information 
Technology Systems Limited (“Key 
ITS”). The staff of Key ITS are now 
contributing to the development of 
the enlarged organisation and its 
product offerings. 
While we remain focused on strong 
organic growth, further acquisition 
opportunities are being considered 
against well defined criteria that 
support our strategic objectives. 
OuTlOOk
The opportunity for increasing 
sales in our Healthcare business, 
in both the UK and overseas 
markets, supported by the Defence 
and Maritime market sectors, will 
maintain our growth momentum. 
We will continue to attract and 
retain the very best talent as we 
deliver against our objective of 
providing an increasing return on 
investment for our shareholders, 
customers and partners. While 
the global economic outlook is 
uncertain, Manpower Software 
is well positioned to continue to 
deliver profitable growth. I remain 
confident in the Company’s future.

 I am delighted to announce our second 
strong set of full year results as a public 
company. The ﬁnancial year ended  
30 April 2012 saw another year of 
substantial growth in joint development 
and contract research revenues, and  
we are well positioned to broaden our 
commercial pipeline and deliver full 
commercial success for our portfolio.
Financial results 
Revenue from operations for the year 
ended 30 April 2012 rose 30 percent to 
£2.01 million (2011: £1.54 million), and 
were supplemented by £0.29 million of 
grant income (2011: £0.36 million). As a 
result total revenue rose 21 percent to 
£2.30 million (2011: £1.90 million).
Revenue from operations relate to the 
payments made by Ilika’s partners for 
research and development activities. 
The majority of these payments are 
associated with the development of 
materials for applications in energy 
storage and conversion, but projects  
in the electronics sector have increased 
signiﬁcantly in the year. The Group  
also has a subsidiary that handles all 
biomedical products and development 
programmes. The revenue breakdown  
of the segmental performance is  
given opposite:
‘ As we move into the new 
ﬁnancial year we are 
conﬁdent that we’ve ﬁrmly 
established a strong base  
to continue to grow the 
business. We have a strong IP 
portfolio and a number  
of joint development 
agreements with major 
partners that continue  
to make good progress.’

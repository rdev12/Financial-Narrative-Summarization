“The Group won its first combined 
Bespak and Aesica opportunity, 
covering both device development/
manufacturing and fill/finish services”
jonathan glenn
Consort has again delivered strong 
organic growth. in Bespak, this has 
once again been delivered through 
strong revenue growth and operating 
leverage. in its first full year under 
Consort ownership, Aesica has now 
been largely integrated, and delivered 
improved operating performance 
resulting in strong organic growth. The 
Group has achieved continued progress 
with opportunities in development and 
innovation.

Further commentary on the financial 
results is contained in the Bespak and 
Aesica business reviews below and 
within the Financial Review.
j oint Bespak/aesica 
Commercial activities
A core objective of the acquisition 
of Aesica was to harness, over time, 
significant cross-selling opportunities, 
and to secure development and 
manufacturing opportunities for 
combined drug and device services. 
The Bespak and Aesica commercial 
teams have continued working closely 
together in a joint mission, to facilitate 
introductions for their sister division’s 
commercial teams to access their core 
customer relationships, and to work 
together jointly to secure combined 
formulation and device contracts.
since the acquisition, a number of 
joint Bespak and Aesica meetings 
have been held with customers and 
the consequent reaction has been 
encouraging.
in addition, cross-selling introductions 
have led to firm enquiries in a variety 
of device opportunities for Bespak, for 
both customer and Bespak iP platforms.
in October 2015, the Group launched 
its new branding at the CPHi exhibition 
in Madrid. This is the largest global trade 
event for the pharma services industry 
and Bespak and Aesica exhibited 
together on the same stand drawing a 
significant amount of new and existing 
customer interest and enquiries.
in February 2016, the Group won its 
first combined Bespak and Aesica 
opportunity, securing an important 
development and supply agreement, 
covering both device development/
manufacturing and fill/finish services 
with Precision Ocular for their novel 
ocular device and drug applications. 
This exciting new partnership will 
draw on the skills and expertise of 
both Bespak and Aesica, and is an 
important demonstration of the value 
of our single solution for device and 
drug combinations. in addition, it 
extends our competencies into the 
ocular therapeutic area in line with our 
stated strategy. A significant attraction 
for Precision Ocular was Consort’s 
ability to offer a “one stop shop” for 
development and eventual commercial 
manufacture of the final filled, finished 
and packaged product.
investment in precision o cular
Following the signing of a development 
agreement with Precision Ocular for the 
development and manufacturing of 
the novel delivery device technology 
and fill finish, Consort subscribed to an 
equity financing completed by Precision 
Ocular. The financing will raise a total 
of £13.5m. investors include imperial 
innovations, Hovione, neoMed and 
Consort. Of the £13.5m equity raise, 
Consort’s investment is expected to 
be a total of £3.3m, of which the first 
tranche was £2.0m, giving the Group a 
12.2% shareholding, rising to 13.7% after 
the second tranche. Consort Medical 
also has a Board seat at Precision 
Ocular. 
We believe Precision Ocular’s 
proprietary drug products and drug 
delivery system has the potential to 
be a platform technology with broad 
applicability. Precision Ocular’s novel 
drug products and drug delivery 
system is designed to access specific 
small spaces in the eye and to provide 
unique drug distribution to tissues 
specifically involved in retinal diseases. 
This unique approach effectively 
optimizes the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of both existing 
and new ophthalmic therapeutic 
agents. it may also increase therapeutic 
effectiveness, reduce side effects and 
minimize the frequency of treatment for 
certain patient groups.
Consort is a leading company in 
innovation and our participation in 
Precision Ocular’s equity financing 
once again highlights our commitment 
to investing in companies that are at 
the forefront of the development of 
new treatments, new markets and new 
opportunities.

Strategic Report 24576.04    18 July 2016 10:59 AM   PROOF 8
Bespak has a well-established and 
diverse core business of products in 
volume manufacturing. Once again, 
the business performed strongly in 
the year with the production of the 
2 billionth HFA pMdi valve, as well 
as winning two new development 
contracts.
Revenue grew 10.8% to £117.2m with 
growth in all segments. Mdi produced a 
particularly strong revenue performance 
with 7.1% growth, especially in valve 
sales. dPi grew revenue 1.6% with 
continuing growth from the Chiesi 
nexThaler. Other sales continued this 
trend with growth of 49.3%, including a 
doubling of sales in injectables. included 
in these segments, service revenue 
also continued its strong contribution 
given the growing development and 
innovation pipelines.
Overall, with all segments growing, 
the positive diversification trend has 
continued, with the proportion of sales 
by segment for Mdi at 51.1% (FY2015: 
52.9%), dPi at 31.2% (FY2015: 34.0%), and 
Other 17.7% (FY2015: 13.2%). in 2012, 
Other sales were just 8.0% of Bespak’s 
total sales, and have therefore more 
than doubled in the last four years, 
delivering on our diversification strategy.
The strong revenue performance 
significantly translated to eBiT growth, 
which increased 20.4% to £25.2m, 
delivering strong operating leverage 
from the increased volume and 
further benefits driven from continuous 
improvement initiatives as eBiT margin 
increased 170bps to 21.5%.
Product Development
in line with our strategy, we have 
assembled a full and broad product 
development pipeline of organic 
growth opportunities, which will add to 
the strength of the core business going 
forwards. successful conversion of these 
opportunities will provide progressive 
revenue and profit growth, in both 
contract manufacturing and products 
with our own proprietary iP and across 
a range of therapeutic areas, including 
commercial drug handling.
Our published development portfolio 
provides an update on the key business 
development projects in the business. 
We guide that for inclusion in the 
published portfolio, projects must have 
a reasonable expectation of success, 
though timescales are difficult to 
predict, and be expected to produce 
peak annual sales of at least £3m  
per annum. 
in the period, we successfully added 
two new projects to our development 
pipeline. These include one respiratory 
project and one ocular, which is 
Bespak’s first project in this therapeutic 
area:
•	 VAl050 is a significant new 
development and supply agreement 
for our proprietary pMdi valve and 
actuator technology for Aeropharm 
GmbH, a sandoz company
•	 OCU050 is a development contract 
for Precision Ocular for their novel 
drug products and drug delivery 
system, which is designed to access 
specific small spaces in the eye and 
to provide unique drug distribution to 
tissues specifically involved in retinal 
diseases

 2.25 
Auto-injector
in november 2015, Bespak unveiled 
its latest addition to the syrina
®
 range 
of auto-injectors at the PdA europe 
2015 exhibition/conference. The new 
syrina
®
 2.25 is one of the most compact 
auto-injectors available today, utilising 
a standard 2.25ml pre-filled syringe, 
and based on Bespak’s proprietary 
Vapoursoft
®
 technology. 
its benefits include:
•	 self-administration, which reduces the 
treatment cost to the health system as 
the patient does not need to attend 
a clinic and
•	 simple adaptability of dose size/
power source dependent on drug 
and viscosity, providing lower 
configurability/adaptability risk and 
a simple delivery mechanism for 
pharma clients
The target drug market includes 
biologics, where the viscosity and 
volume of some drugs means that there 
is significant benefit from powered 
injection. The platform incorporates our 
proprietary Vapoursoft
®
 technology to 
“power” the injection for large dosage 
volumes and a very wide range of 
viscosities.

FY2016 saw Aesica’s first full year within 
Consort. in order to provide a means of 
monitoring Aesica’s development on a 
like-for-like basis, a bridge of FY2016 to 
FY2015 is provided in the table above, 
showing organic and acquisition growth 
and currency exchange rate effects. 
Aesica was acquired by Consort in 
november 2014, hence FY2015 only 
consolidated six months of Aesica’s 
financial performance.
Aesica revenue grew 102.1% to 
£159.7m, which included organic 
growth of £1.4m (1.8%) and acquisition 
growth of £80.1m (101.4%) at constant 
exchange rates. Aesica has grown 
its business in anaesthetics during the 
year, with both customer and product 
diversity, mainly from its Queenborough 
facility.
Aesica has made solid progress in 
the year in improving its operating 
performance into increased eBiT and 
eBiT margin. eBiT in FY2016 grew by 
185.0% to £11.8m, with eBiT margin 
growing 210bps to 7.4%, reflecting 
strong organic growth from volume 
and improved operating performance 
of £2.7m (64.9%) and acquisition 
growth of £5.0m (121.5%), at constant 
exchange rates. This follows sustained 
and growing improvements in 
operational performance across the 
network from upgrades to teams and 
processes, as well as a continued focus 
on the elimination and management 
of low margin products. in addition, 
restructuring actions (see below) have 
begun to deliver operational savings in 
the current year, with further benefits to 
be received in the forthcoming year. 
This has propelled the eBiT margin to 
7.4% in FY2016, an increase of 210bps 
over the prior year (FY2015: 5.3%).
Post-acquisition integration restructuring 
actions signposted 12 months ago have 
been completed at a cost of £6.5m – 
within the previously communicated 
budget of £7.7m:
•	 The newcastle corporate office has 
been closed, with the remaining 
shared service functions moved to 
smaller local facilities
•	 The restructuring in Germany has 
completed, with consolidation of 
warehousing and a move to cell 
based manufacturing
•	 The nottingham site has closed and 
the Finished dose development 
activities have been relocated to 
existing refurbished facilities at the 
Queenborough site

Consort MediCal plC 
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016 
Aesica has maintained a solid 
regulatory track record during the 
year with successful FdA and MHRA 
audits at some of its sites, as well as 
ongoing customer audits. A large 
pharmaceutical company and major 
customer awarded Aesica an external 
supplier Award, reflecting Aesica’s 
strong focus on reliability, service and 
quality. 
Business Development  
and Innovation
Following the closure and relocation of 
the Finished dose development Centre 
from nottingham to Queenborough, 
it has received its first new contract 
at the newly recommissioned facilities 
and has generated a high level of 
interest and site visits from both large 
pharmaceutical and small “virtual” 
pharmaceutical customers. its initial 
business focus will be on Potents and 
other high demand areas.
in FY2015, Aesica concluded a product 
development programme for a 
product manufactured using the first 
semi-continuous processing line and 
technology installed at a CdMO. The 
product is now approved and launched 
in the first major market, with others 
expected to follow over the next 24 
months. 
Aesica has been working with a leading 
Japanese pharmaceutical company 
to provide the active ingredient for 
an anti-inflammatory formulation 
containing s+flurbiprofen. The patch 
has received market approval from the 
Ministry of Health, labour and Welfare in 
Japan for the indication of osteoarthritis. 
Aesica is in the process of supplying 
APi materials for launch stock under 
a new long term supply agreement, 
with demand for the new formulation 
expected to grow steadily from 2016.
Aesica provides an integrated supply 
chain management service to some of 
its customers and has announced the 
extension of this service. in addition to 
providing its finished dose, packaging 
and release operations to the 
customer, the service model provides 
management of product supply chains 
of upstream and downstream processes 
at third party suppliers on the customer’s 
behalf. This additional service enables 
the customer to reduce the overall 
number of CdMO partners it deals with. 
Aesica has been routinely offering this 
service to two of its customers and 
market feedback clearly points to other 
opportunities with existing and new 
customers.
during the year, the business has 
identified a number of attractive 
business development opportunities 
from investment in additional 
capabilities, or upgrade and expansion 
of existing ones. These incremental 
capex programmes will take place over 
the next 24 months.
Pipeline
Aesica is primarily focused on two pools 
of business development: development 
services and manufacturing services, 
with some overlap between the two. 
•	 development services applies 
know-how in APi/formulation 
development to a wide range of 
project opportunities for a wide range 
of customers at different stages of the 
clinical trial cycle
•	 Manufacturing services revenue 
mainly comes from the application 
of its process technology and know-
how to specific APi and drug product 
manufacturing opportunities, many 
of which may be different from 
those APi/formulation development 
opportunities
The Aesica commercial team is 
focused on a growing pipeline of 
APi/formulation development and 
manufacturing opportunities. There is 
significant contractual and commercial 
confidentiality as to the identity of 
specific projects and contracts.

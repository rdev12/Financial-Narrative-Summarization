CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
During 2003 we have made considerable
progress in a number of areas:
• We outperformed most of our 
principal markets.
• We continued our investment in
manufacturing excellence through our
programme of strategic manufacturing
initiatives and lean manufacturing.
• We initiated further investment in Asia
and China, building on our global reach.
• We acquired Stackpole to enhance 
further our position in the rapidly
growing outsourced market for
automotive powertrain systems and
components and have since invested 
to expand capacity to meet the 
growing demand in that business.
• We continued to encourage the
development of an entrepreneurial
culture with a focus on growth in value. 
• We progressed the disposals of 
non-core businesses.
• We achieved underlying growth 
in sales and operating proﬁt.
Our principal objective must be to 
achieve long term sustainable growth 
in the economic value of Tomkins through
strategic development of our businesses.
Through effective communication to 
the ﬁnancial markets, this translates 
into growth in equity value for our
shareholders. We describe “Managing 
for Value” on page 18.
We see the main drivers for growth 
in the intrinsic value as:
• improving our competitive advantage
through technology and innovation;
• proﬁtable growth in sales;
• increasing the cash margin; and
• investing where we can earn an 
after tax return in excess of our 
weighted average cost of capital.
All our businesses recognise the need 
for growth and are pursuing strategies
aimed at maximising their potential. 
We have previously outlined our plans 
to develop three of our business areas
where we see the greatest potential for
long term growth in value: the automotive
powertrain, the industrial and automotive
aftermarket and Air Systems Components.
Automotive powertrain
The automotive powertrain, which consists
of the engine, transmission and related
accessories, is currently a $150 billion 
global market, of which only approximately 
$30 billion or 20 per cent is currently
outsourced by automotive original
equipment manufacturers (“AOEs”) to
third party suppliers like Tomkins. This
compares with around 60 per cent for the
rest of the vehicle. 
The AOEs are seeking to reduce their
cost base by outsourcing more of the
powertrain and are embracing new
technologies and production techniques
that are being developed by suppliers. 
At the same time, global automotive
production is increasing and the overall
value of the powertrain is rising due to
ever stricter emission regulations and
consumer demands for performance 
and economy. These factors combine to
create a signiﬁcant increase in the size 
of the market for outsourced powertrain
components and systems. Through Gates
and our recent acquisition of Stackpole,
Tomkins is already a major player in this
market and we intend to participate 
fully in this future growth.
Industrial and automotive aftermarket 
The Group already has a signiﬁcant 
position in the North American industrial
and automotive aftermarket, supplying
products such as accessory drive and
synchronous belts, tensioners, wipers, high-
pressure hydraulic hoses and connectors
and other automotive accessories. We are
building upon this strength by increasing
sales of new products, adding products
manufactured by third parties and further
developing our rapidly growing presence 
in Europe and Asia.
Air Systems Components
Our Air Systems Components businesses 
are already the US market leaders in air
handling products for the commercial and 
“ALL OUR BUSINESSES RECOGNISE THE NEED
FOR GROWTH AND ARE PURSUING STRATEGIES
AIMED AT MAXIMISING THEIR POTENTIAL.”
JAMES NICOL, CHIEF EXECUTIVE residential markets. As well as participating
in the anticipated recovery in the US
commercial and industrial construction
market, we are seeking to make bolt-on
acquisitions that add new products or
markets to our existing US businesses. 
We intend to expand internationally,
particularly in Asia where we are in
discussions with a major US customer 
on a co-operative marketing effort.
Our ﬁve pervasive themes that
encapsulate the drivers that I believe 
will lead to growth in economic value are:
Building an entrepreneurial culture
We have introduced a new management
incentive scheme that more closely aligns
the interests of management with those

of shareholders. The new scheme bases
managers’ bonuses upon a percentage of
“Bonusable Proﬁt”, which is based upon
their businesses’ operating proﬁt, less tax,
and a charge for the capital invested in
their businesses (based upon the Group’s
weighted average cost of capital). This
moves individual managers’ focus from
performance measurement against an
arbitrary annual budget to the absolute
performance of their business and year 
on year improvement. Salaries are ﬁxed 
in real terms and bonuses will only rise 
if absolute performance improves. The
scheme included around 30 senior
managers during 2003 and has been
extended to approximately 50 additional
individuals for 2004. 5 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003
People development is key to achieving our
goals and therefore we have initiated the
Tomkins College, in conjunction with the
University of Indiana in the USA. The
College will focus upon ensuring that all
our management teams have the necessary
and most up-to-date skill sets to enable
them to optimise their own and their
businesses’ performance. 
Developing innovative products
All our businesses realise that product
innovation is key to maintaining the
competitive advantage that allows them 
to grow their businesses. Progress in this
area is monitored closely on a quarterly
basis. Examples include the following:
• In Industrial & Automotive, the
electromechanical drive “stop-start”
technology using our patented belts 
and tensioners goes into production 
this year with a major European car
manufacturer. This has also attracted
considerable interest from other
manufacturers across the world.
• In Air Systems Components, Lau’s
proprietary PropSound software helps 
fan designers to minimise noise, placing
us at the leading edge of this increasingly
important point of differentiation in the
commercial and industrial market.
• In Engineered & Construction Products,
Dexter Axle has had great success with 
its electro-hydraulic actuator, which
signiﬁcantly improves trailer braking
distances and reduces the risk of 
jack-kniﬁng.
Achieving manufacturing excellence
Our aim is to be the lowest cost producer
of quality products through excellence 
in manufacturing. We will achieve this
through strategic manufacturing initiatives
(“SMIs”), which address the location 
of manufacturing activities and lean
manufacturing, which makes the
manufacturing processes more efﬁcient.
We are reaching the end of a three-year
programme of SMIs, having accelerated a
number of projects during 2003. Since the
start of the programme, we have
consolidated facilities, moving production
to optimal locations. Projects undertaken
during 2003 were the closure of the
Elizabethtown, Kentucky transmission belt
plant and the transfer of its production to
other US plants, the relocation of hose
production from two plants in the USA to
a plant in Cohisa, Mexico and the second
phase of the reorganisation of 
our Wiper Systems operations in Europe,
following the recently completed closure
of the Dunstable plant in the UK. 
The overall investment of around £200
million in operating costs and capital
expenditure during the past three years
has resulted in annual cost savings of 
the order of £50 million.
A signiﬁcant exercise for the staged
implementation of lean manufacturing is
taking place across all our facilities. During
2003, we estimate that we have saved
around £25 million in operating costs 
and these savings are in addition to the
signiﬁcant beneﬁts arising from reduced
inventory levels, the release of
manufacturing space and the freeing 
up of machine capacity.
Expanding our global position
Some developing countries such as China
are expected to experience growth rates
during this decade well above those
achievable in the developed world. For
example, China is expected to become the
third largest car manufacturer in 2005,
overtaking countries such as Germany and
South Korea. We already lead the Chinese
market for transmission belts and, together
with our partner, we are making a £50
million investment over the next three
years to create a second production plant.
Commercial construction in China will grow
signiﬁcantly, driven in part by the Olympic
Games in Beijing in 2008, and our Air
Systems Components businesses are
working to establish a larger presence in
this market. Several of our other businesses
are seeking expansion in Asia, both as a
market for their products and as a lower
cost source of product.
Making value-creating acquisitions
Our ﬁnancial strength enables us to
supplement organic growth with
acquisitions in our areas of business focus.

Stackpole, which brought us expertise in
powder metal and engineered components
for powertrain, is an example of what 
we look for when assessing acquisitions,
namely, the ability to achieve double 
digit growth and double digit margins,
proprietary technology, good management
and, above all, the ability to create value.
We continue to look to make further
acquisitions in Powertrain, Air Systems
Components and Aftermarket.
Market outlook
Overall, our main markets are expected 
to show some improvements in 2004.
The global industrial and automotive
aftermarket, our most proﬁtable market
(around 29 per cent of Group sales), is
expected to show further modest growth 
in 2004 but we expect to outperform that
market through new product introductions
and geographical expansion.
According to CSM, a leading industry
forecaster, the global automotive original
equipment market (around 27 per cent of
Group sales) is expected to grow in 2004 
by 4.7 per cent to 59.3 million units, with
modest growth in North America and
Europe and 16 per cent growth in Asia.
The US commercial construction market
(around 11 per cent of Group sales) has
experienced a signiﬁcant decline since its
peak in 2000 but is forecast to grow by
around 2 per cent in 2004.
The US residential construction market
(around 14 per cent of Group sales), which
measured by new housing starts grew by
8.4 per cent in 2003, is forecast by the
National Association of Home Builders to
show a modest decline of 3.2 per cent in
2004 but will remain at what are
historically high levels.
The actions that we have taken will
ensure that we will be a much better
company in 2004 than we were last year. If
our markets perform as forecast, our ability
to outperform our competitors should
ensure that we achieve good underlying
growth in performance during 2004.

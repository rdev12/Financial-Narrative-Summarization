 HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 5
During the year, we transferred those 
parts of our claims handling and 
network operations that support 
our UK policy customers into UK 
Membership from Emergency Services. 
Our original intention for Emergency 
Services was to develop a unique, 
national, multi-trade network in the 
UK to support our growing policy 
membership base and to provide an 
integrated claims fulfilment solution for 
household insurers. 
Whilst we have validated the benefit 
to insurers of such an integrated hub 
proposition, we have not progressed 
strategic partnerships of this type 
at a rate consistent with our original 
objectives. On the back of this and 
ongoing challenges within the 
insurance sector, we have decided to 
reposition the Group to focus on our 
membership businesses which we 
believe is in the best long-term interest 
of our shareholders. Accordingly, we 
have decided to exit UK Emergency 
Services and are currently progressing 
a number of approaches. 
The decision to exit this business 
is one we have considered very 
carefully in light of our dedicated 
employees, customer relationships 
and investment of time and resources 
in building the business since 2002. 
In addition, as a result of ongoing 
trading challenges and deteriorating 
financial performance, we have taken 
the difficult but necessary decision to 
write down the value of UK Emergency 
Services assets resulting in an 
impairment charge of £97m and a 
statutory pre-tax loss for the year for 
the Group of £21.7m.
Core Membership Operations - 
business development
We are very pleased with the strong 
performance of all our membership 
businesses. Our UK Membership 
business has delivered another year 
of strong growth with gross new policy 
sales of 1.83m (2008: 1.68m) and our 
retention rate for the year remained 
high at 83% (2008: 85%). Our decision 
to focus on driving value per customer 
has been successful through continued 
conversion of existing members to 
Combined Policies and income per 
customer growing by 18% to £59. 
The reorganisation of our UK 
operations has created a fully 
integrated membership business 
including claims management and 
policy repair networks resulting in 
improved customer service and more 
focused and efficient service delivery 
with one division taking ownership for 
the entire customer journey.
We have also reached a significant 
milestone in our international 
operations which delivered an 
operating profit
*
 for the year of £5.1m 
compared with a loss of £0.5m last 
year. 
Chairman’s statement
HomeServe’s core policy membership 
operations have delivered another strong 
performance. Across the UK, Continental 
Europe and US we have seen 14% policy 
growth to 9.2m, 8% growth in customers 
and 22% operating profit
*
 growth to 
£92.3m. 6
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Overview
Our European business has trebled 
operating profit* to £5.3m (2008: 
£1.8m) with Doméo, our French joint 
venture with Veolia, having another 
very successful year and doubling 
total (100%) profits* to £14.0m (2008: 
£6.8m). In Spain, Reparalia continues 
to progress well, growing revenue 
and helping to facilitate agreements 
with new affinity partners. Our 
Spanish policy business ended the 
year with 47,700 policies on the back 
of an encouraging start to full-scale 
marketing with Endesa. We have also 
expanded geographically through the 
acquisition of SPT, Belgium’s leading 
claims handling and repair network 
business.
In addition, the USA has made 
excellent progress, generating a profit 
in the second half and is now profitable 
on an ongoing basis. During the year 
the business increased customer 
numbers by 50% and the retention 
rate to 80% (2008: 78%). We are also 
pleased to announce the signing of 
a 10-year marketing agreement with 
SEMCO Energy Gas Company, a gas 
utility based in Michigan, which will 
provide us with access to an additional 
250,000 households and includes the 
acquisition of 26,300 policies.
Results
Revenue for the Group declined 7% 
to £517.4m (2008: £554.9m) as a 
result of a fall in volumes within UK 
Emergency Services and the change 
in underwriting arrangements in the 
UK and operating profit* increased by 
10% to £100.3m. Group profit before 
tax* increased by 13% to £96.1m and 
earnings per share^ increased by 14%.
We are delighted with the continued 
strong performance of our membership 
businesses.
Revenue for our three membership 
businesses increased by 8% to £284m, 
or 25% excluding the impact from the 
change in underwriting. Operating 
profit* increased by 22% to £92.3m.
Revenue within UK Emergency Services 
decreased by 20% to £233.6m (2008: 
£291.7m) and operating profit* by 47% 
to £8.0m (2008: £15.1m).
As reported in our interim results, we 
incurred £1.5m of costs in relation to 
the aborted second hub deal and 
£5m of costs have arisen from the 
reorganisation of our UK businesses 
(of which £2.7m relates to non-core 
operations). The total exceptional costs 
of £6.5m together with the write down 
of UK Emergency Services assets of 
£97m result in a statutory loss before 
tax of £21.7m and loss per share of 
56.2p.
HomeServe continues to have a strong 
balance sheet, ending the year with 
net debt of £34m and with significant 
headroom on lending facilities.
Dividend
Continuing our policy of increasing 
dividends in line with earnings^ 
growth, the Board is proposing a final 
dividend of 25p per share to be paid on 
4 August 2009 to shareholders on the 
register on 3 July 2009. This brings the 
total dividend for the year to 35.5p, a 
year on year increase of 14%.
Employees
We now have approximately 3,000 
employees in our core operations and 
5,500 employees in the total Group. 
Our employees remain committed 
and dedicated and have once again 
contributed significantly to another 
excellent year and I should like to thank 
them for their hard work. 7

Organisational changes
We have also announced that our 
Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan 
Simpson-Dent has decided to leave the 
business to pursue other opportunities. 
Jonathan is being replaced as CFO 
by Martin Bennett, currently Finance 
Director of our UK Membership division, 
who has been with HomeServe for six 
years. I would like to thank Jonathan 
for the significant contribution he has 
made to HomeServe over the last two 
years and congratulate Martin on his 
appointment. 
Prospects
We are delighted with the continued 
strong performance of our membership 
businesses.
Our UK Membership business 
continues to perform well and has 
demonstrated its resilience with high 
levels of gross new policy sales and 
increasing value per customer. Our 
focus on targeting new customers 
through initiatives like One Contact, 
new product development and 
broadening our relationships with 
affinity partners will help to maintain 
strong growth in UK Membership 
going forward.
Overall, HomeServe is well positioned for 
future growth and we are committed  
to a membership-focused strategy. 
Our International operations are 
becoming increasingly significant 
contributors to Group performance 
with comparatively low household 
penetration in these countries 
providing further growth potential. We 
have a firm foundation in Spain through 
the strong performance of Reparalia 
and 47,700 live policies and, with the 
acquisition of SPT, we now have a 
platform to develop a policy business in 
Belgium and the Netherlands.
HomeServe is focused on delivering 
long term growth and continues 
to explore selective investment 
opportunities to support the 
development of the three membership 
businesses. The performance of our 
policy businesses has demonstrated 
the resilience of the business model 
and attractiveness of our products to 
our customers.
Overall, HomeServe is well positioned 
for future growth and we are 
committed to a membership-focused 
strategy.

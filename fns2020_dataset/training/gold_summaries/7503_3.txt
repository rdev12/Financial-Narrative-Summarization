Chairman, HomeServe plc
Overview
3 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
In the UK, having significantly improved our 
customer service over the past year, we are 
focusing on the effectiveness of our sales 
and marketing as we increase activity and 
enhance our existing sales channels. Our 
International businesses have delivered 
strong growth over the past year with 
customer numbers up 19% to 2.6m, and 
these now represent 53% of the Group’s total 
4.9m customers. 
HomeServe’s policies and services continue 
to free customers from the worry and 
inconvenience of home emergencies and 
repairs, with over 1.6m repairs carried out 
over the past twelve months.
Chairman’s statement 
Over the past twelve months HomeServe has made progress in transitioning 
its UK business to a more customer focused operation and has grown its 
International businesses.

Results
In the year, revenue was up 2% to £547m 
(2012: £535m) and adjusted profit before 
tax
2
 was £105.0m (2012: £126.0m). Lower 
profit in our UK business was partially offset 
by a £6m increase from our established 
International businesses. Adjusted earnings 
per share
3
 was 23.0p (2012: 28.0p). The 
Group continues to generate high levels of 
free cash flow
4
 with net debt at 31 March 2013 
reduced to £43m (2012: £66m). 
On a statutory basis, revenue was £547m 
(2012: £535m), profit before tax was £67m 
(2012: £138m) and earnings per share was 
12.9p (2012: 35.4p). The reduction in profit 
before tax is principally due to lower UK 
earnings in FY2013 and the prior year £54.9m 
gain recognised on the re-measurement 
of joint venture interest following the 
acquisition of full control of Doméo. The 
FY2013 statutory result includes exceptional 
expenditure of £25m relating to our UK 
business (£10m) and our French warranty 
business, Société Française de Garantie 
(SFG), (£15m). In the UK, the exceptional 
expenditure includes an estimate of a fine 
arising from the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) investigation and associated costs 
amounting to £6m, together with the costs 
relating to the reduction in the UK headcount 
announced in March 2013 of £4m. There 
remains uncertainty as to the nature or extent 
of the action that the FCA may seek to take 
following the conclusion of its investigation 
and accordingly any related financial effect. 
In respect of SFG, we have recorded a 
£15m charge related to the reduction in the 
carrying value of that business, reflecting the 
challenging conditions in the electrical retail 
market in France. 
UK
In the UK we have strengthened our controls 
and governance, enhanced our focus on the 
customer and have made good progress 
improving customer service and customer 
satisfaction, with 40% fewer complaints 
received over the financial year compared to 
the previous period. The UK business is now 
focusing on the effectiveness of its sales and 
marketing activity and we are starting to see 
better results. 
We have also identified areas for improved 
operational efficiency and are redesigning 
processes and systems, as well as ensuring 
that our resources are aligned with our 
customer numbers. 
The UK management team maintains 
a positive and constructive day-to-day 
relationship with the FCA. We are making 
good progress in completing the business 
improvement initiatives; with our customer 
re-contact exercise on track and in line with 
our expectations. The FCA’s investigation 
into our past issues is making progress and 
as a result we have now recorded exceptional 
expenditure of £6m, which is our estimate 
for the costs and fine arising from this 
investigation. We still expect the investigation 
to take a number of months to complete.

5 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
International business development
We have continued to achieve strong growth 
in our established International businesses. 
HomeServe USA has increased its customer 
numbers by 25% over the past 12 months 
and now has 1.3m customers with over 
2m policies. In Spain, Reparalia increased 
its customer numbers by 50% and policy 
numbers were up 43%, while in France, 
Doméo has increased its retention rate  
to 89%.
We are also continuing to invest in the 
development of new overseas businesses.  
In Italy, we are pleased to have signed  
long-term affinity partner agreements with 
Enel Energia and Veritas and are planning to 
significantly increase our marketing activity 
in FY2014. In Germany, we are focusing on 
developing affinity partnerships. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 
7.67p per share bringing the total dividend for 
the year to 11.3p (2012: 11.3p). 
Board changes
I would formally like to welcome Johnathan 
Ford to the Board. Johnathan joined the 
Group as Chief Financial Officer in September 
2012 and was previously the Group Finance 
Director of NWF Group plc, an AIM listed 
specialist distribution group. He is already 
making a strong contribution to the business.
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all 
our employees for their contribution over the 
past year. 
I would like to particularly note our UK 
employees’ professionalism and commitment 
during a period of significant change, whilst in 
our International businesses our teams have 
again delivered strong growth.
Summary and outlook
HomeServe’s products continue to meet 
clear customer needs and our business 
model continues to deliver long-term 
value. Our financial results in FY2013 are 
in line with expectations. While it remains a 
challenging time for HomeServe in the UK, 
we are confident that the actions we are 
implementing will deliver long-term value to 
all our stakeholders.
HomeServe continues to be a profitable 
business with a strong balance sheet and 
a cash generative business model. We 
expect to stabilise UK customer numbers 
at around 1.9m by the end of FY2014 and 
are planning for continued strong growth 
in our International businesses. While our 
performance in FY2014 is expected to reflect 
the impact of lower UK customer numbers, 
we remain confident that the plans we are 
implementing will allow the Group to return to 
modest growth in FY2015.

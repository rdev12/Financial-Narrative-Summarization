 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 5
Fulmar plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004
While market conditions in the group’s principal activity, commercial printing, remain highly competitive, it is pleasing to
announce substantially improved underlying results.
The figures in this paragraph exclude the exceptional items in both 2003 and 2004 referred to below. Turnover for the year
increased by 7% to £42.73m from £39.93m. Operating profit increased by 39% to £4.00m from £2.89m, representing an
operating margin of 9% (2003 – 7%). Profit before tax increased by 54% to £3.41m from £2.22m, representing a pre-tax
margin of 8% (2003 – 6%). Earnings per share increased by 57% to 8.5p from 5.4p.
The £0.34m exceptional charge in 2004 relates mainly to the costs of reorganisation and relocation of W E Baxter in May 2004
and related loss on sale of fixed assets, together with the costs of closure of the specialist greetings card finishing department
within Royle Corporate Print. The £0.90m exceptional gain in 2003 relates mainly to the sale of unused freehold properties.
After exceptional items, operating profit was up 28% at £3.70m from £2.89m, pre-tax profit was down 1% at £3.08m 
from £3.12m, and earnings per share were down 13% at 7.7p from 8.9p.
Year end equity shareholders’ funds were £24.94m, up from £24.77m, giving net assets per share of 92.5p, up from 
89.4p, following the purchase by the company for cancellation of 750,000 of its ordinary shares at 71.5p per share, for 
a total consideration of £0.54m. Year end net indebtedness reduced to £9.10m from £12.95m with resultant gearing of 
36% (2003 – 52%), reflecting lower than normal levels of capital expenditure at £1.13m (2003 – £3.53m) and the £1.6m
proceeds from the sale in 2003 of a freehold property in Lewes. Net interest payable at £0.59m (2003 – £0.67m) was 
covered 6.8 times (2003 – 4.3 times) by operating profit before exceptional items.
Our commercial and financial printing businesses successfully reversed the decline in sales experienced in 2003, increasing
turnover by 4% to £28.94m (2003 – £27.74m) despite the continuing weakness of demand and pressures on prices. Our 
book related businesses continue to do well, also increasing turnover, to £13.79m (2003 – £12.19m), up 13%; this reflects
good levels of demand for both our jacket and cover services as well as for mass market paperback books.
Our group continues to achieve awards success with Royle Corporate Print being voted ‘Environmental Company of the Year’
and highly commended in the ‘Report and Accounts’ category in the Printing World magazine annual awards. Fulmar Colour
similarly achieved awards success, being voted overall winner in the McNaughton Review.
The improved trading results, together with the continuing awards success, have been achieved through the strenuous efforts
of our staff and I commend them for their commitment in this competitive market.
The directors are recommending an unchanged final dividend of 3.4p per share, which, if approved at the AGM on 11 May
2005, will be paid on 18 May 2005 to those shareholders on the register at the close of business on 22 April 2005. Together
with the unchanged interim dividend per share of 1.8p paid on 8 November 2004, dividends per share total an unchanged
5.2p, which are covered 1.6 times (2003 – 1.0 times) by earnings per share before exceptional items.
Our commercial printing businesses have benefited from some increase in demand, but price pressure remains. Our book
related businesses operate in a more benign commercial environment. All our businesses have under-utilised capacity and 
as a result would benefit from any upturn in activity.

23 March 2005  Our COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL PRINTING businesses successfully reversed the decline in sales 
experienced in 2003, INCREASING TURNOVER BY 4% despite the continuing weakness of demand and
pressures on prices.

Seaborne trade reached an all time high in 2011 and the demand for
dry bulk commodities remains strong, especially from emerging
markets. However the unprecedented dry bulk ﬂeet expansion has
resultedinthecurrenttradeimbalancethemarketisexperiencing.Our
management strategy together with our ﬂeet employment proﬁle
places the Company in the position to strengthen our revenue stream
by seeking out market opportunities in the short term.
In addition, we plan to continue with our ﬂeet renewal and expansion
program, acting prudently and aiming to build long term shareholder
value. Our expansion into the Kamsarmax sector with the two new
buildings that arrive in 2013 is an example of our focus on having a
diversiﬁed ﬂeet which oﬀers wider employment opportunities.
Our moderate leverage and healthy cash position coupled with the
long-standing relationships with our lenders can support our ﬂeet
growth plans. In order to optimize the use of cash when market
opportunities arise, but also to reinforce the Company’s liquidity, the
Directors of the Company have recommended that the dividend
payment for the year 2011 be suspended.
We are conﬁdent that with an experienced management team and an
eﬃciently run ﬂeet, Hellenic is well positioned to navigate through the
current depressed market and continue building long term value and
growth for our shareholders.

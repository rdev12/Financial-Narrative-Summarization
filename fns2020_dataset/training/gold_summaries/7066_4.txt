The goal of Hardy’s India focused exploration activity is to discover 
commercial quantities of hydrocarbons (oil and gas). The Company 
creates value for its shareholders by undertaking activities that 
reduce the overall risk of the exploration cycle.
This is accomplished by conducting extensive geological and 
geophysical studies, acquiring seismic and other data, and the 
implementation of robust, modern technology and scientific analysis 
to identify prospects and select optimal drilling locations.

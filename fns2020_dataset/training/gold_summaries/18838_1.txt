 Chief Executive’s Review
In 2015 ITV delivered another 
strong performance as we continue 
to strengthen and grow the business. 
We achieved good revenue growth 
across all parts of the business, with 
external revenue up 15%, and for the 
sixth consecutive year we delivered 
double-digit growth in our key 
profit measures. 
ITV’s performance in 2015 builds 
on our consistent record of strong 
results since we launched our strategy 
six years ago. Since 2009 we have 
increased Group external revenues by 
58%, adjusted EBITA by 328%, adjusted 
earnings per share (EPS) by over 800% 
and basic EPS by over 400%. We have 
improved our cash position by turning 
this profit into cash, which has allowed 
us to significantly invest in the business 
while at the same time returning over 
£1.1 billion to shareholders to date, 
with more proposed for 2016. We will 
also maintain financial flexibility to 
continue to invest in the business. 
ITV today is a demonstrably better 
business creatively, commercially and 
financially. We’ve made significant 
progress in reducing our dependence 
on UK spot advertising and in growing 
new revenue streams. In 2015, 49% of 
ITV’s total revenues came from sources 
other than traditional spot advertising.
Our global production business, ITV 
Studios, continues to grow in the UK 
and internationally, both organically 
and through acquisitions in key creative 
markets, and is now a global player 
of scale with over half of its revenues 
coming from outside the UK. Our 
Broadcast business is robust and 
growing as we continue to deliver 
unrivalled audience reach for advertisers, 
and further strong growth in Online, 
Pay & Interactive, which is a material 
and profitable part of the business. 
We are committed to our original vision 
of ITV as an owner and producer of 
world-class content. We are confident 
that our strategy to maximise our value 
as an integrated producer broadcaster, 
making our content famous on multiple 
platforms before distributing it around 
the world, is the right long-term path 
for ITV.
We will continue to strengthen the 
business and grow new revenue 
streams both organically and through 
acquisitions, as we see investment 
opportunities across the business. 
There will be an increasing emphasis 
on building a global pay and distribution 
business as we seek to deliver and 
monetise our content on multiple 
platforms, free and pay. 
We remain focused on delivering 
against our three strategic priorities 
in the areas where we can achieve 
most growth:
 maximising
maximise audience and 
revenue share from 
free-to-air broadcast 
and VOD business

ITV delivers another strong 
performance
In 2015 we grew external revenue by 15% 
to £2,972 million (2014: £2,590 million), 
reflecting 6% growth in NAR to 
£1,719 million (2014: £1,629 million) and 
over £300 million growth in non-NAR to 
£1,664 million (2014: £1,327 million), up 
25%. Together with our continued focus 
on cash and costs we delivered another 
year of double-digit profit growth 
with total adjusted EBITA up 18% 
to £865 million (2014: £730 million), 
corresponding to an improved adjusted 
EBITA margin of 29% (2014: 28%). 
Adjusted EPS in the year increased 20% 
to 16.5p (2014: 13.8p) and statutory EPS 
increased 7% to 12.4p (2014: 11.6p).

Maximise audience and revenue 
share from free-to-air broadcast 
and VOD business
Against the backdrop of a rapidly changing 
media environment, our Broadcast 
business has performed consistently well 
over the last few years and has generated 
significant profit and cash, supported by 
our strong programme schedule, tight 
cost control and a sustained recovery 
in the UK advertising market.
In 2015 Broadcast & Online revenues 
were up 6% to £2,146 million (2014: 
£2,023 million), with adjusted EBITA up 
16% to £659 million (2014: £568 million), 
which reflects 6% growth in highly geared 
NAR and 23% growth in high margin 
Online, Pay & Interactive revenue.
Continued strong advertising growth
In 2015 ITV again outperformed its 
estimate of the television advertising 
market. ITV invests over £1 billion annually 
in programming and has unique scale 
and reach which is much in demand from 
advertisers, delivering mass audiences 
on the ITV main channel as well as more 
targeted demographics on the family of 
channels and on the ITV Hub. This scale 
and strength of our brand underpins 
the success of our free-to-air and on 
demand platforms. 
ITV is also driving more value from its 
brands and for advertisers through 
partnerships and sponsorship deals, 
increased consumer interactivity, and 
by developing new and more targeted 
advertising initiatives to extend 
advertising campaigns beyond the 
television spot, such as AdSync+ and 
ITV AdVentures.

The business remains highly cash 
generative and profit to cash conversion 
was 91%, even after increased 
investment in our scripted business. 
We ended the year with net debt of 
£319 million (2014: net cash £41 million) 
after acquisitions of £406 million (net 
of cash acquired), dividend payments 
of £459 million and pension deficit 
contributions of £90 million. 
With a strong balance sheet we are 
able to continue to invest in the assets 
underpinning our strategy, developing 
our content, our people and our brand. 
As a people and talent business we 
also continue to drive high employee 
engagement and attract a diverse 
workforce to support the success of ITV. 
Reflecting ITV’s strong performance in 
2015 and in line with its policy, the Board 
has proposed a final dividend of 4.1p. 
This equates to a full year dividend of 
6.0p, up 28%, which is well ahead of 
earnings growth and is a significant step 
forward in taking ITV’s dividend cover 
closer to its policy range.
The Board is also proposing a 
£400 million (10.0p per share) special 
dividend, which comes after a year 
of significant investment at ITV and 
reflects ITV’s strong cash generation and 
the Board’s confidence in the business. 
Following this distribution ITV’s leverage 
remains well below the 1.5x net debt 
to EBITDA ceiling and gives ITV the 
flexibility to continue to invest across 
the business for further growth.
Focus on strengthening viewing 
performance
In 2015 ITV Family Share of Viewing (SOV) 
declined by 3%. While there were many 
successful programmes in the first half, 
our viewing performance was impacted 
by the launch of a number of new 
free-to-air digital channels, some of 
our shows, particularly in the factual 
genre, not performing as well as we 
had expected and relatively strong 
competition from BBC. ITV Family 
Share of Commercial Impacts (SOCI ) 
was down 4%.
We have new creative leadership in place 
and we remain focused on strengthening 
our viewing performance to ensure we 
continue to deliver standout content 
that drives mass audiences for our 
advertisers. We believe that around 
£1 billion is the right level of investment 
for our programme budget and we have a 
strong slate of programmes for 2016 with 
many new and returning programmes 
across all key genres. 
Responsive to a dynamic environment
The market environment in which we 
operate is constantly changing which 
provides both opportunities and 
challenges. Viewers, and particularly the 
younger generation, are changing the 
way they consume content and the digital 
revolution has dramatically increased 
the number of devices and platforms on 
which content is viewed. As a result online 
is one of the fastest growing businesses 
within ITV and we will continue to invest 
in the quality and accessibility of the 
ITV Hub, the new digital home for all our 
channels and services, as well as seeking 
new ways to monetise and distribute 
our content. 
However, while online viewing is growing 
rapidly in the UK, it remains a small 
proportion of total viewing at 7%, with 
the majority of television watched live.
Broadcast markets differ internationally 
and therefore there cannot necessarily 
be a direct read across. However, what 
is common to all markets is that at the 
heart of a successful Broadcast business

 Chief Executive’s Review is owning and exploiting the rights to 
high-quality, ‘must have’ content. That 
is why growing an international content 
business remains central to our strategy 
as an integrated producer broadcaster.
Grow international content business
In 2015, reflecting the strength of our 
global production labels, ITV Studios 
delivered good revenue growth both 
organically and from our acquisitions, 
with growth across the business. Total 
revenue was up 33% to £1,237 million 
(2014: £933 million), of which organic 
revenue was up 8%, while adjusted 
EBITA increased 27% to £206 million 
(2014: £162 million). 
Our vision is to be a scaled international 
business, owning and exploiting rights 
in key genres that travel. In line with 
this, we continue to strengthen our 
position as the UK’s largest commercial 
production company, as well as creating 
an increasingly international business 
with production bases in America, 
the Netherlands, France, Germany, the 
Nordics and Australia. Over half of ITV 
Studios total revenue is generated 
outside the UK and we have become 
a top independent producer across 
Europe and the US.
It is clear that there remains strong 
global demand for high-quality content 
from both broadcasters and platform 
owners. We estimate that the global 
content market is growing at about 5% 
per annum. Capitalising on this demand, 
ITV’s strategy continues to be to 
develop, own and manage content 
with international appeal in the key 
creative markets.
Over the last few years we have built 
scale in production markets with solid 
creative track records both organically 
and through acquisitions. This year we 
have strengthened our business, with 
the acquisitions of T alpa Media in the 
Netherlands and Twofour Group and 
Mammoth Screen in the UK. 
We continue to build scale internationally 
and develop a larger portfolio of 
successful series and formats across 
genres and across their content lifecycle. 
We will focus on programmes that 
return and travel internationally, namely 
drama, entertainment and factual 
entertainment. We have a good slate 
of new and returning programmes 
with 166 new commissions and 176 
recommissions delivered in 2015 and 
many more in the creative pipeline for 
2016 and beyond.
Building a global pay  
and distribution business
As we grow our investment in content 
and own more hit shows that can be 
exported around the world, we are 
creating new windows to extend the 
reach of that content and monetise it 
across more platforms and markets.
Capitalising on growing demand 
for video on demand
Growth in Online, Pay & Interactive 
remains strong with revenue up 23% 
to £188 million (2015: £153 million) as 
viewers are changing the way they 
consume content. We continue to 
see good growth in long-form video 
requests, up 14% while total video 
consumption, which is the measure of 
how long viewers are spending online, 
was up 42%. 
In Autumn 2015 we successfully 
launched our new online service the ITV 
Hub, through which audiences can access 
ITV broadcast content both live and on 
demand. This is a major step forward in 
the quality, innovation and ease of use of 
our online service. Live content is central 
to the Hub and live simulcast viewing 
is becoming increasingly popular 
particularly around sporting events and 
large entertainment shows, as viewers 
are using connected devices as a 
television set. The new service has been 
very well received with consumption 
growing strongly since launch. To 
continue to drive growth in our online 
audiences and advertising revenues, we 
will continuously invest in improving the 
user experience, technology and the 
reach of the ITV Hub, which is now 
available on 27 platforms. 
Further developing pay opportunities
We have built a fast-growing and 
profitable pay business in the UK from 
licensing our channels, including our 
pay channel ITV Encore, and content to 
platforms such as Sky and Virgin. Outside 
the UK we have established a number of 
smaller pay propositions including Cirkus 
and ITV Choice.
Going forward we are looking to explore 
new models for content creation and 
distribution, through a mix of pay 
channels and online. We have invested 
in a number of digital media companies 
and will continue to develop a greater 
expertise and scale in monetising our 
content through a mixed economy 
of organic growth, partnerships 
and acquisitions.
Expanding our global distribution 
network
Global Entertainment’s revenues grew 
9% in 2015 to £157 million (2014: £144 
million) as we have driven value from the 
investments we have made in creating 
and owning content with international 
appeal. In 2015 we invested £163 million 
in scripted content, up £60 million and 
we continue to strengthen our portfolio 
including acquiring third-party content. 
As ITV grows in scale, we will further 
enhance our distribution network, 
benefiting from our increased rights 
ownership and from the stronger 
network relationships we build.

Strategic Report  Strategy and Operations Our acquisitions have also strengthened 
Global Entertainment’s position as a 
leading international distributor of 
content and our focus is now on 
leveraging our creative talent and 
distribution network to build on these 
successes and develop new ways 
to package and sell our content 
internationally. 
Confident of delivering further 
good growth in 2016 and beyond
We expect to deliver another good 
performance in 2016 with continued 
revenue growth across both businesses.
Over the full year we expect to 
outperform our estimate of the 
television advertising market but 
the phasing of NAR over the year is 
expected to be different in 2016, driven 
by the timing of major sporting events. 
We expect ITV NAR to be flat in Q1, 
marginally behind the market, against 
12% growth in Q1 last year. Q2, which 
will benefit from the Euros, should 
be positive. 
We remain focused on strengthening 
our viewing performance and we have 
started 2016 well, with ITV SOV up 5% 
and ITV Family SOV up 2%. Online, Pay 
& Interactive will deliver double digit 
revenue growth, driven particularly by 
Online and Pay as we continue to invest 
in the ITV Hub and further develop our 
international pay model. ITV Studios is 
on track to report double-digit revenue 
and profit growth, primarily driven by our 
recent acquisitions. 
Overall, we see clear opportunities for 
investment in all parts of the business. 
And because of our strong financial 
position and cash conversion, we are 
confident in delivering both continued 
growth and shareholder returns. ITV 
remains well positioned to drive value 
from its talented and creative people, 
our commercial scale, and our global 
network in the creation and distribution 
of content. 
Our people and our responsibility
Building a responsible business that benefits all stakeholders
The success of our strategy depends 
not just on our operational efficiency, 
but also on the way we interact with our 
stakeholders, the wider community and 
the environment. ITV’s social purpose is 
to use the power of the nation’s most 
loved and most watched programmes 
to create change for good. Our 
responsibility strategy is at the heart 
of everything we do with the aim of 
building a responsible and sustainable 
business. As well as complying with our 
legislative and regulatory requirements 
we recognise that our actions can have 
an impact and our reach can positively 
influence society. We therefore work to 
identify issues that are material to ITV 
and matter to our stakeholders, helping 
us to manage reputational risk as well 
as leverage our audience reach to 
benefit our communities.
Our responsibility priorities
Our responsibility strategy is focused 
around three priorities: people, planet 
and partnerships. 
People
T o continue our success as an integrated 
producer broadcaster, we want to 
attract the largest possible audiences 
to our channels and content and attract 
the best people to work for us. To do 
this we need to portray the diverse 
makeup of modern society on-screen 
and ensure our workplace is inclusive.

We recognise that diversity and 
inclusion goes beyond gender and 
we are committed to monitoring and 
reporting progress on other protected 
characteristics. 
Our programmes and services also 
need to be accessible to all and we 
exceed the Ofcom targets for subtitling, 
audio description and signing. 
Planet
We rely on energy and often depend 
on the resources of local communities 
to help in the production and 
broadcast of programmes. In 2015, 
we used 100% renewable energy in all 
the buildings we own and Coronation 
Street leads the industry in producing 
a television drama of the highest 
quality with the lowest possible 
environmental impact. See page 88 
for our greenhouse gas disclosures.
Partnerships
We strive to tackle social topics in an 
authentic way and leverage our reach 
to mass audiences to raise awareness 
and money for charity. In 2015, over 
30 hours of airtime were dedicated 
to social action. ITV contributed more 
than £24 million in cash and in-kind 
to support charitable causes, which 
equates to 2.8% of adjusted profit 
before tax. More locally, our people 
volunteered over 1,000 hours of their 
time for a cause they care about.

We aim for continuous improvement 
in our responsibility strategy, actions 
and performance. More information

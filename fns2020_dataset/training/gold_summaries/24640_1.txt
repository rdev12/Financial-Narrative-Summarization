Highlights
Growth in capacity through acquisitions
The strategy of building a portfolio of underwriting 
capacity at Lloyd’s has continued through the 
purchase of further corporate members. There 
remains a steady flow of vehicles for sale as 
existing owners wish to cease underwriting due 
to a change of circumstances. This acquisition 
strategy has increased the portfolio from £13m 
at the start of the 2013 underwriting year to 
£33m currently. Since 1 January 2015 over 
£10m of capacity has been acquired. We 
remain selective on the purchases and have 
encountered increasing competition from other 
potential purchasers. There remains a risk to 
the implementation of our strategy if suitable 
vehicles are not available at attractive prices.
Quality of portfolio
We continue to focus ruthlessly on the 
quality syndicates. So participations on weaker 
syndicates in acquired portfolios are sold to 
• 70% of the portfolio managed 
by leading managing agents 
at Lloyd’s 
• Helios portfolio underwriting 
results outperform Lloyd’ s 
average return on capacity by 3%
• Helios cedes 70% of portfolio at 
the start of the underwriting year
• Helios expects to retain 
approximately 50% of 
overall underwriting result 
Maintaining the quality of the portfolio.

maintain the overall quality. The seven largest 
syndicate participations account for over 70% 
of the portfolio. These syndicates are managed 
by the leading managing agents at Lloyd’s 
and represent shares in the better managed 
businesses at Lloyd’s. 
The underwriting results of the Helios portfolio 
have consistently outperformed the Lloyd’s 
market average. Helios’ average return on 
capacity over the last four years is 11% and 
is on average 3% higher than the average 
of the Lloyd’s market. 
The combined ratio of the portfolio (before 
Helios corporate costs) has been 4% higher 
on average over the last four calendar years. 
These incremental returns demonstrate the 
diversity and the breadth of underwriting 
expertise within the businesses comprising 
the portfolio of syndicate capacity.

The use of quota share reinsurance to provide 
access to the Lloyd’s underwriting exposures 
for reinsurers and private capital has been 
expanded. For the 2016 underwriting year the 
panel of reinsurers was expanded to include 
private capital, a potential significant source 
of underwriting capital in the future. The core 
of the panel of reinsurers remains XL Group plc 
and Everest Reinsurance Bermuda Limited.
This reinsurance reduces the exposure of 
the portfolio and assists in the financing of 
the underwriting capital. Helios will seek 
to reinsure a significant proportion of the 
capacity at the start of the underwriting 
year to mitigate the open year underwriting 
exposures. For corporate members acquired 
during the year, a proportion of the “on-risk” 
capacity will be ceded to reinsurers whilst 
the capacity on older years will be retained 
100% by Helios. Therefore the proportion 
of the overall capacity that Helios retains is 
expected to rise as further corporate members 
are acquired in the future. The profits earned 
after the company has been acquired will be 
recognised by Helios.
The table shows that the Helios retained capacity 
increases significantly in Years 2 and 3 as 
further corporate members are acquired 
and the older years are not reinsured. 
Capacity on underwriting years after 18 months 
of development is substantially “off risk” as 
the underlying insurance contracts have 
mostly expired. Therefore the profits from 
the capacity on the older years are retained 
100% by Helios. The proportion of overall 
capacity retained by Helios for the 2015 
and 2016 underwriting years is expected 
to increase to approximately 50% as further 
corporate members are acquired.

Development of profit estimates
As Helios has no active involvement in the 
underwriting or management of the syndicates 
on which it participates, it relies on information 
on forecast profitability of the portfolio that is 
released on a quarterly basis by the managing 
agents of the syndicates. The managing 
agents have traditionally been conservative 
in the estimation of the profitability of a year 
of account, waiting until the development of 
the underlying reserves for the claims can 
be assessed with greater certainty. 
The capacity acquired on the “off-risk years” 
that is retained 100% by Helios contributes 
a significant part of the profits of the Group. 
The chart below indicates that a significant 
proportion of the improvement in the estimates 
of profitability of syndicates are declared by 
the managing agents in the last 12 months 
to the close of an underwriting year. Helios 
benefits from the conservative nature of 
the managing agents.
Risk management
Helios continues to ensure that the 
portfolio is well diversified across classes of 
businesses and managing agents at Lloyd’s. 
The purchase of quota share reinsurance cedes 
70% of the risk on the younger or “on-risk” 
years which has remained consistent for the 
last three years. The market conditions 
continue to soften as the incidence of insured 
natural disasters and large loss events has 
been below normal expectations. This has 
allowed the insurance industry to generate 
adequate returns on capital and thereby 
attract new capital to the industry. 
There is today a strong consensus in 
the insurance industry that it would take a 
catastrophe, or series of catastrophes, on a 
very large scale to materially turn the market 
for short tail lines of business. The high 
aggregation of coastal exposures in the US 
and other developed markets is one reason 
why such massive dislocations cannot be 
ruled out.
The biggest single risk faced by insurers 
arises from the possibility of mispricing 
insurance on a large scale. This is mitigated 
by the diversification of the syndicate portfolio 
and by the depth of management experience 
within the syndicates that Helios supports. 
These management teams have weathered 
multiple market cycles and the risk management 
skills employed should reduce the possibility 
of substantial under-reserving of previous 
year underwriting.
We assess the downside risk in the event 
of a major loss through the monitoring of the 
aggregate net losses estimated by managing 
agents to realistic disaster scenarios (“RDSs”) 
prescribed by Lloyd’ s. The RDS events comprise 
16 compulsory events to assess the potential 
impact across the portfolio from the type of 
event proscribed. The nature and the size of 
the prescribed events have remained similar 
and the individual syndicate net exposures 
will depend on the business underwritten 
during the year and the reinsurance 
protections purchased at syndicate level.

which serves as a guide to the portfolio aggregate though the correct approach would involve combining the underlying distribution curves which are not provided in the SBFs.

6                  Helios Underwriting plc  Annual report and financial statements 2015 The estimated aggregate net largest exposure 
for the Helios portfolio, before quota share 
and stop loss reinsurance, remains two separate 
hurricanes to affect the US Northeast Coast. 
The aggregate net loss has reduced to 
23% (2015: 28%) of stamp capacity as the 
syndicates have reduced both their gross 
and net exposures. All the largest natural 
catastrophes would be substantial insured 
losses in excess of US$100bn, events that 
would generate a great deal of publicity.
Helios continues to buy stop loss reinsurance 
that will reduce the impact of a significant 
loss to the portfolio. 
Capacity value
The value of the portfolio of the syndicate 
capacity remains an important factor in delivering 
overall returns to shareholders. The Enterprise 
value, being the value of the net tangible assets 
of the Group, together with the current value 
of the portfolio capacity, is a key management 
metric in determining growth in value 
to shareholders. 
The Board recognises that the average 
prices derived from the annual capacity 
auctions managed by the Corporation at 
Lloyd’s could be subject to material change 
if the level of demand for syndicate capacity 
reduces. Notwithstanding the average prices 
derived from the auction process, each of the 
syndicates will have a track record of trading 
profitability and generating cash.
The impairment charge for this year of £63,000 
indicates a small reduction in the fair value 
of the syndicate capacity as a result of the 
fluctuations in the auction values of the 
syndicates in the portfolio.
Capital position

portfolio is supplied as follows:

Reinsurance panel 10.8
Helios 3.9
Total 14.7
Helios has generated free cash of £1.8m 
in 2016 from the distribution of its share of 
the final underwriting profits for the 2013 
underwriting year and early releases from 
the 2014 and 2015 years. These profits have 
assisted in funding the recent acquisitions 
and will provide working capital for the next 
12 months. A bank facility is in place to fund 
cash shortfalls. 
Corporate costs
Given the reduction in risk assumed and 
the associated reduction in underwriting 
profits, it remains essential to manage the 
central costs of Helios effectively. The fees 
and profit commissions receivable from the 
reinsurance panel offset a proportion of the 
costs incurred. 
Corporate, social and 
environmental responsibility
Helios aims to meet its expectations of its 
shareholders and other stakeholders in 
recognising, measuring and managing the 
impacts of its business activities. As Helios 
manages a portfolio of Lloyd’s syndicate 
capacity, it has no direct responsibility for 
the management of those businesses. 
Each managing agent has responsibility 
for the management of those businesses, 
their staff and employment policies and the 
environmental impact. 
Therefore, the Board does not consider 
it appropriate to monitor or report any 
performance indicators in relation to 
corporate, social or environmental matters.

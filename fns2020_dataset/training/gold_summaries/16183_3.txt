 T wo years on from the formation of TUI Travel, we
have made substantial progress in implementing
our strategic imperatives and delivering our roadmap.
We are on track to achieve our synergy target and
have successfully resolved a number of key strategic
issues identified at the time of the merger. Some
underperforming businesses remain and we are
confident that we can turn these around. We are
focusing increasingly on the significant growth
opportunities identified within both the Mainstream
and Specialist Sectors, which I believe will deliver
superior and sustainable long term growth.
Results
The Group has achieved an 11% increase in
underlying operating profit to £443m, (2008:
£398m) on slightly lower revenue of £13,863m
(2008: £13,932m). Underlying profit before tax 
is up 15% to £366m, (2008: £319m). Underlying
earnings per share increased by 17% to 23.8p,
(2008: 20.4p). The Group statutory loss before
taxation was £52m (2008: £267m).
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 7.7p
per share. On 19 May 2009, the Board recommended
an interim dividend of 3.0p per share, thereby
resulting in a full year dividend of 10.7p per share
(previous year 9.7p). The Group has a progressive
dividend policy and will look to maintain underlying
dividend cover at just over two times.
Board
Christoph Mueller resigned as Aviation Director 
and subsequently left the Board in May 2009. 
In October 2009, Horst Baier was appointed as a
Non-Executive Director. The Board is composed of
a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors.
Colleagues
Providing special holiday experiences to our
customers is down to the hard work and enthusiasm
of our colleagues. Our colleagues are at the heart of
achieving our objectives and successes and we have
outstanding talent at every level of the business. 
I thank them on behalf of the Board.
Sustainable development
Sustainability is important to our customers,
colleagues and ultimately our shareholders. We are
aware of our responsibility to manage our impacts
on the environment and people. Climate change is
the greatest environmental challenge facing humanity
and we recognise that we contribute to global
carbon emissions, particularly through our aircraft
operations. We work hard to reduce this impact and
I am pleased to report that our emissions compare
favourably with our peers.

Growing in strength
We have again delivered a strong set of results against a backdrop of challenging economic
conditions and exceptional cost inflation from jet fuel prices and currency movements. 
Our performance in 2009 proves that the flexibility and diversity of our model works and 
is testament to the strength of our management team and our market-leading brands.

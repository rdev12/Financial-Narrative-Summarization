4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 07
The 2015 results represent another successful year in the delivery of 
our strategy to maximise organic revenue growth at a broadly 
stable operating margin percentage. 
Group revenue increased by 20% over 2014. Comprising more than 
96% of Group revenue, the North American business continues to 
be the primary growth engine for the Group. Revenue growth in 
North America remained strong despite being affected by economic 
pressures and adverse currency movements in Canada. Our 
percentage growth rates remain significantly higher than those in 
our industry as a whole, which are estimated to be in the low-to-
mid single digits. The UK operation produced an increase in revenue 
in reporting currency of 7%, but in underlying currency the growth 
rate was 16%, showing excellent progress and further gain in 
market share.
Revenue benefited from 2015 being a 53 week accounting period 
for the Group, compared to the usual 52 weeks. This “extra” week 
contributed roughly one percentage point to sales growth over the 
prior period. 
Overall, the Group operating margin percentage for 2015 was 
6.74%, compared to 6.68% in 2014, delivering on our strategy to 
maintain a broadly stable operating margin percentage.
Underlying operating profit in Direct Marketing operations 
increased by 16%, compared to a 20% revenue increase. Several 
factors contributed to this slight margin dilution, the largest being 
the impact on gross profit of adverse US and Canadian dollar 
currency movements. Other factors were the assimilation into the 
cost base of the Oshkosh office and distribution centre expansion 
projects, and the 53 week accounting period which resulted in a 
negative profit effect due to a full week of payroll and overheads 
outweighing the gross margin generated from a quiet week of 
revenue during the holiday season. We do not anticipate that these 
factors, taken together, will result in a permanent diminution in 
operating margin. 
Head office costs reduced by 15% in 2015 compared to prior 
period, reflecting the current structure and activities of the  
central function. 
In total, 945,000 individually customised orders were processed in 
2015, compared to more than 780,000 in the prior period.
More than 220,000 new customers were acquired in the period and 
orders from new customers were up 18% over 2014. Prospect 
marketing remains a key priority and we continue to invest a 
significant part of our marketing budget into testing and developing 
innovative techniques for reaching potential customers.
Orders from existing customers were 21% higher than the prior 
period, demonstrating consistent customer retention patterns. A 
key element in maintaining the productivity and reliability of the 
customer file is our Blue Box™ sample mailing programme. More 
than 1.75 million boxes were sent to customers during 2015 as we 
continue to improve the depth and sophistication of this 
programme.
Following the pattern of recent years, online marketing increased at 
a faster rate than offline marketing. Rapidly evolving online 
techniques and media are a major focus for our marketing teams. 
Offline marketing, however, remains a very effective medium. 
Catalogue circulation was increased by 6% over the prior period.
The overall effectiveness of the marketing effort is expressed in the 
revenue per marketing dollar statistic. This was in line with 
expectations at $5.92 for the period, compared to $6.01 in 2014, as 
we continue our aggressive pursuit of organic revenue growth. 
There were two major infrastructure projects in 2015 at our US base 
in Oshkosh. We made a major expansion at our distribution centre, 
more than doubling the footprint of that facility to accommodate 
volume increases in our sample, Blue Box™ and embroidery 
operations. In addition, around 25,000 sq. ft. of office space was 
added to our main office facility. The total capital cost was $9m and 
both projects were delivered on time, on budget and with no 
operational disruption. 
We continue to expand our product range, including products 
exclusive to 4imprint and an increasing number of items available on 
24 hour turnaround. 
For the eighth year in a row, the North American business was 
named on the prestigious list of the Top 25 Best Medium Sized 
Workplaces in the USA. The UK business maintains its Investors in 
People accreditation. Our workplace culture is fundamental in 
sustaining the remarkable customer service that marks us out from 
our competition.
The infrastructure investments and operational improvements made 
in 2015 leave us in a strong market position. Moreover, we are very 
proud of our well-trained, dedicated and talented team. As a result, 
we are confident in our ability to achieve further organic growth.

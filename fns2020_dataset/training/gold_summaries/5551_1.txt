Statement
Nick Phillips Chief Executive Officer
Entertainment Rights has a business model 
that is the envy of many in the media sector.  
What makes ER unique is that it owns, controls 
or manages rights to its key intellectual 
property assets, enabling the Company to 
generate revenue across all forms of media, 
including television content, consumer 
products, home entertainment, feature films, 
computer gaming, digital rights, stage shows 
and music.  This is a significant contrast to 
other specialist media companies where the 
exploitation of rights is often limited to more 
narrowly defined revenue streams.
The ER business has undergone a tremendous 
amount of change during the past 12 months.  
I see a lot of strength in the business and I 
intend to spend time reviewing the business 
over the coming months in order to fully 
understand the opportunities available to 
the Group and, working with the Board, 
to determine where the Group’s future 
investment should be focused.
I am looking forward to working with the ER 
team.  The brand portfolio is second to none 
and, with footprints in the world’s two largest 
media markets, the opportunities for further 
growth in the evolving media landscape are 
apparent.

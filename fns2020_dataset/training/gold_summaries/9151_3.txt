I believe is now beginning to bear fruit.
I am encouraged by B&Q’s momentum
into 2007, in both adapting to an ongoing
tougher market and developing its offer
for the future.
At the same time, Kingfisher’s
increasingly important international
businesses have continued to grow and
develop. Outside the UK, sales rose by
15.1% in the year and profits rose by
2.7%, in constant currencies. Within
the UK, consumer spending on home
improvement was held back by rising
interest rates and utility bills, inevitably
impacting B&Q’s trading. However, B&Q’s
ambitious development programme and a
progressive stabilisation of the UK market
during the year combined to show
encouraging signs of progress in the
second half.
Overall, total reported Group sales
grew 8.3% to £8.7 billion in the year, with
adjusted pre-tax profit down 11% to
£396.6 million. Net debt was reduced

I was delighted to become Chairman of
Kingfisher in May 2006, during an
important and challenging period for both
the Group and its shareholders.
The sharp decline in the UK home
improvement market over the last two
years has seriously impacted sales and
profits at B&Q, Kingfisher’s biggest
business. However, vigorous and sustained
management action has been taken which

there was a 9% increase in the valuation
of the Group’s property portfolio, in
constant currencies, and a significant
reduction in the pension fund deficit to
£28 million, compared with £211 million in
the previous year. Despite the fall in profits,
the Board has recommended a maintained
dividend for the year of 10.65p per share,
after considering the Group’s medium-
term trading outlook, its overall financial
strength and current investment needs.

visited most of Kingfisher’s businesses
around the world and been very
encouraged by what I have seen.
With strong corporate and operating
management, a focused and well-balanced
family of leading businesses in both large,
well-established markets like the UK
and France, and younger, faster-growth
markets across Europe and Asia,
Kingfisher is a top tier international retailer
with enormous potential. There are
challenges too, not least the fragility of
the UK market and the need to invest in
equipping our two largest companies with
the modern and attractive stores they
need to meet our customers’ changing
needs – an absolute requirement for any
retailer aspiring to sustainable leadership.
Strategically, I believe Kingfisher is
doing the right things, building on its
established businesses in the UK and
France, whilst investing in growth
opportunities in other markets in Europe
and Asia. You can read more about this
strategy in the Chief Executive’s review
on pages 6 and 7 and the Operating
review on pages 20 to 29.
Kingfisher has continued to make the
most of its scale and international reach,
developing its Group buying programmes
and sharing ideas and management talent
around the businesses. From my own
experience I know that this is not easy,
but I share our management’s conviction
that we have the opportunity to build
a truly world-class company if we can keep
things simple and really focus on delivering
quality and value to our customers.
I would like to welcome two new
non-executive directors to the Board.

Chairman, bringing with him a wealth of
international retail experience from his
13 years as Chairman and Chief Executive
of Carrefour, the second largest retailer in
the world and one of the most successful
internationally. Janis Kong joined the
Board in December after a successful
career with BAA, the leading UK airports
operator. I would also like to take the
opportunity to thank Margaret Salmon,
who stepped down from the Board during
the year after nine years of excellent
service. We will miss Margaret’s counsel
and we wish her well.
Finally, I would like to thank Kingfisher’s
80,000 staff around the world for their
continued hard work, loyalty and
professionalism and, as I have seen for
myself, their wonderful enthusiasm. As
always, it is their efforts on behalf of the
customers in our stores that really make
the difference.

In November 2015, we entered into a Transaction which will, when completed, involve the disposal 
of our global hybrid voice broking and information business, including our associated technology  
and broking platforms (including i-Swap and Fusion), certain of our joint ventures and our associates 
(IGBB), to Tullett Prebon. ICAP shareholders and ICAP Newco plc (Newco) will together own 
approximately 56% of the issued shared capital of the enlarged Tullett Prebon with 19.9% retained 
by Newco, which will be renamed NEX Group plc.
For the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group’s performance is therefore reported in the Group consolidated 
income statement separately for continuing and discontinued operations (net of tax). Discontinued performance 
for the year includes IGBB’s performance, adjusted for certain provisions in the sale and purchase agreement. 
The continuing income statement is not reflective of the financials of Newco going forward. The Group expects to 
receive dividend income for its investment in the enlarged Tullett Prebon, which is expected to be named TP ICAP .

consolidated balance sheet. The continuing balance sheet is not reflective of the balance sheet of Newco  
going forward. On completion, the Group will receive £330 million of cash from TP ICAP and will recognise  
an investment in TP ICAP.

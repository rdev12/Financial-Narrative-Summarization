Return of Capital
In July 2012 Booker Group plc issued £124m of shareholder equity to acquire Makro in the UK. Following the successful integration 
of Makro into the Group and a period of strong cash generation, the Board implemented a capital return to shareholders of 
3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of approximately £61m) in July 2014. Given the continued successful development 
of the Group, the Board is proposing a second capital return to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of 
approximately £62m, based on the current issued share capital of the Company). It is again proposed that this is achieved by the 
issue of a new class of ‘B’ shares which shareholders will be able to redeem for cash. The return of capital requires the approval 
of shareholders, which will be sought at the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2015. Further details of the proposed return of 
capital will be set out in a circular to shareholders which will accompany the notice convening this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
We currently anticipate returning a similar amount to shareholders in July 2016 and will provide an update on this at the 2016 Final 
Results announcement in May 2016 in light of circumstances prevailing at that time.

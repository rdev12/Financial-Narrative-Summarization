 Product and service range
The Group is split into seven
divisions, primarily active in online
advertising and online market
research. We have two offices in
London, as well as offices in Holland
(TAPPS) and Spain and the US
(AffiliateFuture), with some 200 staff
across our five locations.
Our various divisions give the
levels of scale and quality which the
largest clients are seeking online.
We believe in the synergies between
our businesses, with encouraging
signs that once our clients are
utilising one area of the Group, they
are quick to utilise further divisions,
giving us a true “multi-service,
single-source” offering. 
Affiliate marketing
AffiliateFuture, which brings together
more than 800 advertisers with over
100,000 website publishers,
generated in excess of £130 million
of sales for retailers in 2007, often
pushing up to five million visitors to
advertisers in peak months. With our
clients under contract and our
reputation with the website
publishers strong, our strength was
recognised when we were recently
highly commended for services to
affiliates through the A4U industry
awards. We have a good sense of
visibility over potential revenues.
Following the IBG acquisition, we
also launched our new tracking
technology, Veracitag TM which sits
alongside the more traditional
“cookie” tracking, which resulted in
an increase of more than 7% in the
number of sales being tracked. Such
service and competitive edge
through technology gives us a great
foundation from which to build. We
also appointed Tom Morgan as
Managing Director from his role as
MD at EDR where his business
building skills have driven the agency
forward. 
Our agency division, EDR, now
under the management of Kevin
Rice, is also active in the affiliate
marketing space, with over 40
clients utilising its affiliate marketing
management services. 
Email marketing
Our list owner/manager divisions,
TMN Media in the UK and TAPPS in
Holland now manage over 20 million
email records across some of the
most prestigious email databases
from MTV to RTL, Handbag to
thetrainline.com. 
The key to successful email
marketing continues to be strength
of delivery platforms combined with
relationships with the world’s largest
ISPs such as AOL and Hotmail. The
relevance of the advertising and the
recognition of the brand resulted in
over 15 million visitors to our
advertisers last year. Despite the
challenges of the financial sector,
EDR continues to make an impact as
the UK’s largest email marketing
agency, booking in excess of 200
million email sends last year. Our
knowledge of the market combined
with a focus on using the strongest,
most acceptable email lists, many of
which sit within our media divisions,
has resulted in good retention of
clients, along with some key wins. 
Website publishing
Following the acquisition of IBG, we
placed all of our websites within one
division, TMN Publishing, led by Mark
Ash, formerly of DoubleClick. These
websites include MutualPoints, one
of the largest online rewarded
shopping portals in the UK and
Plum-Prizes, a fast growing and
recently relaunched competition
portal which has seen record
revenues month on month. This

ÈÈÈ
ÈÈÈ division also manages our travel
sites, notably Henoo.com and
CheapHolidayDeals.com, and a
number of new opportunities,
including Freequotes.co.uk and
SurveyCentral, the latter being the
UK version of a Dutch product, PBS
(Premium Brands Survey). Our
websites are attracting over eight
million users each year. 
Lead generation
Early in 2007, with our knowledge of
data management we launched Pure
Lead, our data cleansing and
management tool. Over one million
leads were managed by the product
in the financial year for a number of
clients and its run-rate entering this
year suggests that we will increase
this figure significantly. 
TAPPS also have their own lead
generation product in the
Netherlands, Premium Brands
Survey. Again, we are seeing strong
growth in the number of leads it is
generating and have moved it to a
six weekly cycle, from a quarterly
cycle, to deal with demand.
Research
Our dual approach to online market
research has yielded encouraging
results and continued growth,
despite the expansion and number
of new players in the market. The iD
Factor, having over 25 specialist
panels in the UK and a global reach
through partnerships, generated
nearly one million responses to
surveys last year. With our growth in
Europe and the US, we are now in a
strong position to build our own
panels in these territories. ICD
Research grew strongly throughout
the financial year, resulting in long-
term deals with a number of media
and banking clients which act as a
foundation for its revenue
expectations for the year. 
In all, the Group generated over
75 million visitors for its clients last
year, which is the sort of scale and
breadth which gives us a sound
platform going into the end of the
decade. 
Outlook
Recent figures from the IAB suggest
that UK online ad spend grew to
£2.85 billion in 2007, and predicts
£3.5 billion spend in 2008, followed
by £4 billion spend by 2009. Some
verticals have been hit by global
economic events, notably financial
and automotive. Although we have
felt some of this impact throughout
our divisions, we believe our
increase in scale puts us in a
stronger position to handle the more
demanding economic environment
and continue to grow the overall
business.
We have no doubt that the market
is changing around us, and how we
adapt will dictate our ability to grow.
We have promoted from within to
take up senior roles in EDR,
AffiliateFuture and TMN Publishing.
Our MDs in TAPPS, Research and
TMN Media have continued their
successful growth and I believe we
have the management to meet these
challenges and continue on our
journey towards our vision of
becoming a powerful digital
marketing player throughout Europe
and beyond.

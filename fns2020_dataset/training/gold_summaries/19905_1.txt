 Strategic report
Chief Executive’s strategic review 
A year of progress 
Throughout 2013 we continued to deliver the clear, 
consistent strategy that has underpinned performance  
since 2010. This strategy has been based on three priorities:
• To grow recurring profit and cash flow through a 
combination of rental growth, new openings and cost 
savings, while building an increasingly strong brand
• To enhance portfolio quality through a programme of 
highly selective developments, focusing on London and 
strong regional locations, together with the disposal of 
non-core assets, and
• To strengthen the Group’s capital base.
We made good progress on all fronts and this is reflected 
in our key financial indicators:
Financial highlights
2013 2012
NPC £25.6m £19.1m
EPRA earnings per share 18.0p 9.9p
Adjusted earnings per share (pre 
UCC performance fee)
13.6p 9.9p
NAV per share (adjusted, fully diluted) 382p 350p
Full year dividend declared 4.8p 4.0p
Total return (NAV growth plus 
dividends) 10.5% 1 1.3%
See-through LTV ratio 49% 52%
Operating cash flow £23.2m £17.2m
The business has now delivered an average total return on 
equity of 10.4% per annum over the past four years. This is 
in line with our stated objective of delivering low double digit, 
balanced total returns and has been achieved against a 
difficult economic backdrop. 
Adjusted earnings (pre UCC performance fee) now account 
for 37% of returns, compared to 6% in 2010, and we are on 
track to achieve our strategic target of a 4.5% EPRA EPS 
yield on opening NAV for 2015. Dividends for the full year 
are 4.8 pence per share, a 20% increase on 2012, and  
are 2.7 times covered by operating cash flow.

Capital structure
The substantial progress we made in 201 3 with our financing 
activity was particularly encouraging. Across the course of the 
year our team secured £ 1. 1 billion of new debt facilities either 
on behalf of co-investment vehicles or on the UNITE balance 
sheet, with a further £124 million arranged since the year 
end that has brought our principal refinancing activity to  
a conclusion. This has enabled us to take advantage of 
historically low interest rates for the longer term while  
also improving the diversity and flexibility of our funding. 
Taking into account the post year end activity, our average 
cost of debt is now 4.7% (2012: 5.5%), materially accretive 
to ungeared investment yields at an average 6.5% and 
development yields at 9- 10%. The weighted average 
period to expiry has been extended to 7.1 years (2012: 4.1 
years), providing certainty of financing costs for the longer 
term. Our loan-to-value ratio fell to 49% from 52% at 
December 2012 and we intend to continue reducing  
this over time towards 40% as future capital growth and 
development profits increase the Group’s equity base.
Simplification of our co-investment vehicles remains a priority 
for 201 4. In December we crystallised our UCC performance 
fee which will be re-invested into additional units and increase 
our stake in UCC from 30% to 34%. We are progressing  
the planned sale of our OCB joint venture, the proceeds of 
which will be invested in increasing our stake in UCC 
further, and once our stake in UCC reaches 50% it will 
be merged with LSAV, thereby reducing the number of 
co-investment vehicles from four to two. We have entered 
into an exclusivity agreement with a credible prospective 
purchaser of the OCB assets at a level supportive of current 
valuations. Due to its relative complexity, the planned sale 
has taken longer than originally expected but we are 
confident that a sale will be concluded later in 2014.
Portfolio activity
In June we raised £51.2 million of new equity by way of a 
share placing to part-fund a highly targeted £125 million 
regional development programme. We have subsequently 
made very good progress in committing this new capital 
with approximately 70% already committed to three new

1420-1 UNITE AR_1.Strategic_v14.indd   12 02/04/2014   17:59 projects, subject to planning and expected to be delivered 
in 2016. The remainder is allocated to a fourth project 
where we are in exclusive negotiations. The prospective 
returns from this activity are attractive, with yields on cost 
in the region of 9.5% to 10%.
This regional development programme supplements our 
ongoing London development activity being undertaken by 
LSAV, our 50/50 joint venture with GIC. LSAV also made 
good progress in the year with additional sites and planning 
consents secured. Its target £330 million development 
programme is now 60% committed with all funding in place 
and returns expected to be in the region of 9% yield on cost.
The combined effect of our London and regional 
development programme on future growth prospects is 
significant. If our return expectations are achieved, the 
secured development pipeline will add 39 pence (10%)  
to adjusted NAV per share and 13 pence per share (96%) 
to recurring EPRA EPS once completed. Projects where 
the Group is in exclusive negotiations could add a further  
6 pence and 1 pence to NAV per share and EPS respectively.
Development costs in London are increasing (both  
for land and build) whereas in strong regional locations 
they remain low and are currently showing little sign of 
inflation. As a result of this and the encouraging demand 
outlook we currently favour new development in strong 
regional locations over London. We expect these 
favourable conditions to persist in the regions for  
the next 12 to 18 months.
Investor interest in the student accommodation sector is 
broadening and deepening and 2013 was another year of 
healthy transaction volumes. We expect to see continued 
activity throughout 2014 and this is likely to translate into 
stronger yields as the year progresses. However the relative 
lack of liquidity in the sector when compared to other sub 
sectors of the property market mean that yield movements 
in general are likely to lag the wider market to some extent.
Brand and operating platform
Over the past few years we have increased the levels of 
recurring profit and cash flow from our operating business 
materially, evidenced most clearly by the increase in NPC 
from £4.1 million in 2010 to £25.6 million in 2013. Over 
this period the operational portfolio has only increased  
in size by 3%; the improvement in profitability has been 
delivered through a combination of rental growth, portfolio 
recycling and cost efficiences. However, most importantly 
our improvements have been supported by consistent 
enhancements to service levels.
Our cost base has been tightly controlled but has 
significant capacity. Since 2010, our NOI margin has 
improved from 69.8% to 71.4% and net overheads (after 
deducting fees received from co-investment vehicles) 
have fallen by 25%, from £1 1.2 million to £8.4 million. 
These efficiency gains have been achieved without 
impairing operational capacity and we continue to  
believe that our operating platform is capable of managing 
approximately 60,000 beds at minimal additional cost. 
Service satisfaction levels again increased to highest  
ever levels in 2013, reflecting students’ appreciation of  
the improvements we have made. Targeted investments in 
technology and processes, such as mobile working, have 
allowed us to free up front-line staff to spend more time on 
high customer impact duties, such as longer opening hours 
and more rapid maintenance response, while also reducing 
overall operating costs. We have also invested consistently 
in our estate, including the installation of high speed Wi-Fi 
throughout our buildings and our ongoing lifecycle investment 
programmes, again improving customers’ experiences.
For 2014 we have a clear plan of further upgrades to our 
service proposition, all of which is deliverable within the 
framework of our financial plans. These improvements 
are built on our brand promise to provide a ‘Home for 
Success’ and we are confident that they will further 
differentiate us positively from our competitors.
Outlook
The substantial progress we have made in the areas of 
capital structure, portfolio quality and operating platform 
combine to support our growth prospects for the next few 
years. We have a strong capital base, attractive secured 
development pipeline, scalable operating business and 
market leading brand.
At the same time, the market outlook for the student 
accommodation sector is the most positive that it has 
been for a number of years. UCAS applications data 
shows an increase in University applications of 4% year 
on year and applications from non-EU students and UK 
school leavers, both core markets for UNITE, are at record 
highs. Government policy is supportive of rising student 
enrolment, Universities are increasingly looking to the 
private sector for solutions, investor interest is increasing 
and development costs remain comparatively low. 
The performance of the business in the early part of 201 4 
supports this outlook. In particular, reservations for 201 4/15 
stand at 64% (2013: 62%) and we are experiencing 
increased demand from all customer segments (re-
bookers, new customers and University referrals) through 
both on-line and off-line channels. Pricing is supportive of 
our 3% rental growth guidance for the full year, our cost 
reduction activity has been largely concluded and we 
have three new properties on schedule to be opened for 
the 2014/15 academic year. The combination of these 
factors gives us confidence that in 2014 we will continue 
to deliver strong performance and growth.

Before one-off charges in 2007/08 SSL has achieved its financial targets 
for the past three years – you must be pleased.
I am delighted with the progress we have made. Our target
was to achieve double digit operating profit growth in each
of the three years until 2008/09, and we have achieved
that comfortably in difficult trading conditions. A testament
to the strength of our brands, our continued investment 
in innovation to bring new products to market, our ongoing
ability to control costs, and astute investment in future
growth opportunities.
Y ou have set new targets. How 
confident are you of meeting them in the current
economic downturn?
We believe we are well positioned to build on our strong
operating and financial platforms. Our core brands, Durex
and Scholl, continue to meet consumer needs regularly
bringing new products to the market. The restructuring 
of our supply chain over the past few years has improved
efficiency and is increasing capacity; and our increased
presence in emerging consumer markets provides real
opportunities for long-term growth. Of course, we
acknowledge and understand that we are operating in 
one of the toughest recessions in living memory – but 
we remain optimistic. Many sectors within the personal
care market are comparatively resilient to the current
economic climate, we have limited exposure to the
American consumer market, and our ongoing investment
in training and staff development is producing some
outstanding individual and team performances.
Y our new condom factory in China opens in
July 2009. How will this and other developments to
your operating platform contribute to sales growth?
Our new factory in Qingdao, China will enable us to scale 
up condom production for supply to the Chinese domestic
consumer market and our planned expansion into Russia
and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
In addition, we have invested in our condom factory 
in Thailand, to increase global productivity and flexibility.
New, state-of-the-art facilities at our Peterlee factory 
in the United Kingdom will support growth of our
pharmaceutical products.
SSL recently gave notice to exercise its 
option to increase its stake in the company that
owns Contex, which is sold in Russia and the CIS.
What role does this and other acquisitions have 
for the business?
We have said for some time now that organic growth 
of the business will be supplemented by key acquisitions 
– either of products to develop our brand portfolios, or 
of businesses to gain exposure to new consumers and
markets. In April this year, we gave notice to exercise our
option to increase our stake, from 15.5 per cent to 50 per
cent plus one share, in BLBV, the company that distributes
the Contex condom brand in Russia, as well as exercising
the option to acquire the company that distributes Contex
in Ukraine. We have a final option to buy the remaining
shares of BLBV to take us to 100 per cent ownership, 
which is likely to be exercised in February 2010.
W e have been delighted with our initial investment
in BLBV, and the underlying performance of the business 
has been in line with our expectations. We believe that the
Contex brand, backed by excellent distribution across the
region to a growing number of consumers, has the potential
to take SSL to a new level of success.
This year has also seen us acquire the Swiss
condom brand Crest, the number two brand in that
country with a market share of 32 per cent.
It has been another good year for Scholl
Footcare. What is driving the brand’s strong
performance?
There are a number of factors. The innovation team,

growth professionals and research institutes, have an in-depth
understanding of consumer needs and how to meet them.
New product development is quick to the market, and
backed by marketing and advertising campaigns that not
only position products effectively but also educate users
on their key benefits. This year, Scholl Deo-Activ Fresh, a
deodorising footspray that kills 99 per cent of the bacteria
known to cause foot odour, has been launched successfully,
while Scholl Perfect Nail T reatment/Nail Brightening System
continues to sell well across key markets. Our acquisition 
of Orthaheel in late 2007 has now been integrated into the
footcare portfolio, and is performing well for us. 
What are your plans for Durex?
T o continue delivering consistent sales growth across 
the brand’s product categories and commercial regions,
and look for opportunities to bring new products to our
consumers. This year has seen the successful launch of
Durex Play O, a gel that helps women orgasm more easily , the
extension of our Durex Play 2in1 Massage range, and steady
growth in condom sales. The market for Durex products
remains buoyant despite the credit crunch, and we expect
this year to be another year of success for the brand.
Y ou appear to be a business on the move 
– how do you ensure that staff are aligned with the
group’s wider strategic objectives?
This is a subject we take very seriously. SSL continues to
invest in its employees’ training and development, and strives
to create a positive and supportive working environment
that fosters strong performance and entrepreneurial flair.
We also want our staff to understand what the business as
a whole is trying to achieve and, crucially, their part in helping
it to meet its objectives. Our internal communications,
employee development initiatives and working culture 
are all structured with this in mind.

It’s this combination 
of strong brands, innovation,
expanding distribution
capability and a motivated 
team that makes SSL such an
exciting place to be. Our new
target, to grow EPS by 50 per
cent over the next three years, 
is aggressive (particularly in 
the present climate) but we 
are optimistic that we can
achieve it.

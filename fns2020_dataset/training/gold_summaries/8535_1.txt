ITE Group plc 
Annual Report 2006
This business review has been prepared for ITE
Group as a whole and highlights matters which are
relevant in the context of the Group’s business and
financial results.
Results for 2006 financial year
T urnover for the year was £82.4 million (2005: £78.5 million).
After making adjustment for the effect of biennial events this 
is a 16% improvement over last year’ s comparable turnover .
This year’ s turnover includes an initial £2.7 million contribution
of revenue from the Footwear and Kiev AgriHort acquisitions
made in the last financial year . These events contributed 
£1.2 million to gross profits. The ‘like for like’ revenue growth
(excluding the effect of biennial events and acquisitions in the
year) achieved this year on our portfolio of events was 13%.
The direct costs of exhibitions were well controlled in 2006 and
as a result the gross margin of 46.7% was circa 1% higher than
the gross margin achieved on last year’ s portfolio of events.
Operating costs before amortisation charges of £14.1 million
were 10% higher than the comparative charge for last year
(2005: £12.8 million). Operating costs this year include the
higher costs of expensing Performance Share Plans and Option
Plans of £1.6 million (2005: £1.1 million), but this is partially
offset by the release of a £0.3 million provision, originally 
made in 2003 against a venue loan.
The associate business in T urkey delivered a result of £0.6
million (2005: £0.4 million) despite a reduced contribution
from its textile exhibitions.
Income from interest and finance was reduced following the 
£30 million share buyback executed in August 2005. Interest
income was consequently reduced by approximately £1.3
million. Finance income includes the release of £0.4 million 
of ‘notional imputed interest receipts’ relating to certain venue
loans under IFRS fair value accounting standards.
Headline profit before tax this year of £26.0 million was ahead 
of last year’ s headline profit before tax of £25.3 million and,
after adjusting for the effect of biennial events, represents a
25% increase over the comparable result for 2005.
The Group’ s overall operating metrics for its events business
(excluding publishing) are set out below:

Non annual 2006 45.0 2.3 0.4
2006 Results from Events 425.6 80.6 37.7
In 2006 the Group organised 146 events (2005: 152 events) 
in fifteen countries (2005: sixteen countries) from its nineteen
dedicated offices. There were sixteen new launches in the year
contributing a total £2.0 million in revenue and £0.5 million in
gross profits. 
The Group sold 425,600m
2
of exhibition space in 2006 (2005:
340,900m
2
). After adjusting for the effect of biennial events the
Group achieved a 20% increase in volume sales, a 16% increase
in revenues and a 21% improvement in gross profits from the
events it organised in 2006.
The average yield across the Group achieved on comparable
sales was 3% lower this year at £206 per m
2
(2005 comparable
yield: £212 per m
2
). This was expected as half of the dilution 
in yield was attributable to the average yields of the new
acquisitions; a quarter of the dilution in yield related to the 
re-pricing of the Moscow International Motor Show , and the
remaining quarter was caused by strong volume growth 
from regions outside Moscow , where in general, average 
yields are lower .

Business to business specialists
Business to business (‘B2B’) exhibitions and conferences
are modern marketplaces for business. Face to face
meetings to conduct business are a key marketing
medium for international and local businesses to 
open sales channels in new territories. 
B2B exhibitions and conferences generate the majority 
of their revenues in advance of the event and do not rely
upon a consumer audience for their success. 
ITE is a specialist in organising B2B exhibitions and
conferences, and its focus on emerging and developing
markets adds an extra dimension to its position in the media
industry . These markets are by definition dynamic, and their
fast moving, constantly changing nature means that trade
events are in high demand as participants maximise their
exposure to new commercial opportunities and stay one
step ahead within their field.

The market conditions in Moscow and St Petersburg were strong
with most exhibitions reflecting higher demand. In Moscow the
second pavilion at Crocus, which was completed in 2005, added
an extra 60,000m
2
of available gross space to the market’ s
international quality exhibition space. Accordingly there was
resultant change in the Moscow market with new launches and
venue changes across the industry , as organisers responded to
the increase in space and increased choice of venue. In St Petersburg
there has been relative stability and little change in established
trading patterns. However the draw of Moscow’ s large events 
for the major international exhibitors is causing St Petersburg 
to evolve into a more regional exhibition business.
In ITE’ s Moscow business the highlight of the year was the
further expansion of the market leading construction event,
MosBuild. At 68,300m
2
(2005: 54,400m
2
) across the two
leading exhibition venues this event is now Moscow’ s, and
Russia’ s, largest trade exhibition.
Of our other major international events in Moscow the Moscow
International T ravel and T ourism exhibition held in Expocentr
was solid in response to competition this year from a new
event launch at Crocus. It recorded marginal growth to
19,600m
2
(2005: 19,300m
2
) at a slightly reduced overall yield.
The Moscow International Motor Show , focused on the B2B
motor accessories, service and parts industries, took place 
for the first time in the new Crocus venue alongside the OICA
consumer motor show , Autosalon. As part of this re-positioning
the Moscow International Motor Show agreed a common
pricing policy with the Autosalon event together with a lower
venue cost to ITE. The event was bigger at 17,700m
2
(2005:
16,900m
2
) but yields were lower than the 2005 comparatives. 
However the new format was well received by visitors and
exhibitors alike. Following the move to Crocus, pricing for the
Moscow International Motor Show is likely to stabilise.
Worldfood Moscow , held in Expocentr , continues to perform
well and has become the leading specialist event in the trade
food sector now occupying 22,200m
2
of space (2005:
20,300m
2
). Expoelectronica, the leading electrical components
event, moved to the Crocus venue to secure more and better
quality space. The event grew by over 20% to 9,000m
2
(2005:
7,400m
2
) and is now one of ITE’ s top five contributing events 
in Moscow . 
There have been a number of successful new launches in
Moscow this year . Babytime is a consumer focused event; MIBS
Autumn an ‘on the water’ summer boat event supplementing
our Spring Boat Show . Since the year end a new launch of an
Autumn travel event, Select T ravel, and the transfer of our
pharmaceuticals event to Crocus have both proved successful
initiatives. Additionally ITE acquired two new events in June this
year . Expoclean Moscow has a focus on the industrial cleaning
industry and Bytchimexpo focuses on household chemicals.
Expoclean took place in November and performed ahead of
expectations; Bytchimexpo will take place in March next year .
In St Petersburg most of the exhibitions reported steady 
growth. The major event in the calendar is BalticBuild which
was unchanged in size at 10,200m
2
(the event is space
constrained), but improved its revenues and profits. There 
was one small new launch, Subcontracting, supported by 
the City Government.
Looking forward there is a new pavilion being built at
Expocentr which will provide much needed space for our
Expocentr based events to expand. This will add a further
8,000m
2
gross space and is due for completion in early 2007.
Crocus has also commenced construction of a third pavilion,
designed to provide at least 60,000m
2
gross. With more new
space available the Moscow exhibition business is well
positioned to deliver further growth.

All offices in Central Asia experienced strong demand and
excellent year on year revenue growth of more than 25% was
achieved across the whole region. There have been no marked
changes in the competitive environment. In Almaty , Atakent,
the venue owner , successfully completed a new pavilion ready
for our use in September 2006, but there have been no other
significant changes in venue facilities elsewhere in Central Asia.
A new office was opened in Kyrgyzstan in the year . 
One highlight of the year was the new launch of KazBuild
Spring in Almaty which delivered 4,100m
2
. Our regular
KazBuild (Autumn) event was able to utilise the newly
constructed pavilion and grow to 10,800m
2
(2005: 8,300m
2
).
T otal sales to the construction sector in Almaty have almost
doubled in this financial year , testimony to the underlying
strong demand. The strength of the construction sector was 
in evidence throughout the region with revenue growth at
AtyrauBuild (10%), AstanaBuild (21%), BakuBuild (30%) and
UzBuild (14%) all recording positive year on year growth. 
In October 2005, the Kazakhstan International Oil & Gas
exhibition and conference grew by 7% to 7,900m
2
(2005:
7,400m
2
). Since the year-end the October 2006 edition has
been held and grew by 20% into the newly constructed pavilion.
Oil & gas events have again been strong performers
throughout the region with the North Caspian event in Atyrau,
Kazakhstan, Oil & Gas Uzbekistan and the Caspian Oil & Gas
exhibition in Azerbaijan all recording good year on year
revenue growth.
New launch activity continued its momentum. The eight small
start up events and conferences across the regions will assist to
secure ITE’ s future presence in these markets as the economic
infrastructure evolves. Events were launched in construction,
banking and financial services and the power industry
(Kazakhstan); and telecoms and travel (Uzbekistan). 
The current pattern of business growth in line with economic
growth and assisted by venue development looks set to
continue for the foreseeable future.

ITE staff by region
ITE was established in 1991 and since its early years has
been a pioneer amongst trade event organisers through 
its expertise in launching and organising new events to
international standards in places where the exhibition 
and conference industry is under developed.
ITE retains its innovative spirit today , but now the
Company benefits from the depth of experience of its
many staff who have worked at the forefront of their
profession for several years.
ITE has a flat management structure and a philosophy 
of promoting responsibility throughout the workforce.
Working for ITE is a rewarding experience and staff
retention levels are high. 
ITE’ s operational management is decentralised, with
emphasis placed on local offices managing their own
business with international support. This structure is
designed to recognise the value of the expertise that has
been developed throughout the Group and allows ITE to be
more aware of, and responsive to, local market conditions. 08/09

In the Ukraine the second phase development of ITE’ s preferred
venue, IEC, was completed in January 2006 allowing the newly
acquired AgriHort event to expand into the new space. The
2006 edition of the event was 9,500m
2
, significantly larger
than the 2005 pre-acquisition edition. The construction event,
KievBuild, also benefited from the new space and reported
strong growth of 47% over last year’ s show to 7,750m
2
. The
Ukraine International T ravel and T ourism event reported 
growth of 20% in revenue and profit in selling 5,100m
2
(2005:
4,200m
2
). A strong overall result from the Ukrainian business
was achieved in delivering 20% ‘like for like’ growth in revenues
over the year .
In T urkey our wholly owned business delivered its best
contribution to date. The construction plant and machinery
exhibition, Ankomak was held, for the first time since 2003;
this event is over 40,000m
2
but at relatively low yields. The
T urkish business saw good growth in its other exhibitions and
in its outbound sales activity into ITE events across the regions.
Our 50% owned associate business reported total sales of
200,000m
2
and made a contribution to ITE Group’ s profits after
tax of £0.6 million. The furniture, house textiles and machinery
tools events all grew well but the decline in the textile fabric
exhibition, as previously advised, held back the overall result.

The principal businesses carried out in the UK are the Spring
and Autumn Fashion events, MODA, held at the NEC Birmingham
and the related magazine publishing business. During the year
the recently acquired Footwear UK events were integrated into
the MODA UK business and operational structures. The core 
UK fashion events having enjoyed a successful February show ,
recorded a decline in demand in the Menswear section of its
August event, reflecting seasonal patterns as well as circumstances
in the UK retail market. The shortfall was more than compensated
for by strong growth in the Footwear event over its pre-acquisition
size. Magazine publishing also recorded a good result with revenues
up 7% over the prior year on its portfolio of titles. 
This ITE business unit has established a successful model of
complementing magazine advertising and exhibition participation.
The business has been quick to adapt to industry trends and 
to grow and consolidate exhibition and magazine revenue. 
36 staff are employed in the North England office running 
the exhibition and magazine business. 
Of the total staff employed in Western Europe and the UK, 
28 are based in Germany contributing specialist sales onto
Russia and the CIS. The London office of ITE employs 91 staff
split evenly between sales teams and corporate ‘head office’. 
Rest of the World 
Offices: Algeria (Algiers), China (Beijing)
The principal event running in Africa this year was in Algeria
where we continued our relationship with U.N.C.T .A.D.
Following on from our initial success we opened a small office
in Algiers and entered into a joint venture with Sonatrach to
organise the national oil & gas exhibition and conference in
Oran in November 2006.
ITE has recently opened a small sales office in Beijing with 
a view to developing a greater participation from Chinese
exhibitors into ITE’ s Russian and CIS events. Initial successes
have been encouraging.

Annual Report 2006
Future outlook
ITE’ s strategy of focussing on achieving maximum organic
revenue growth by leveraging its market leading position in
markets where we have expertise advantage has yielded
another strong set of results.
The growing strength and stability of the Russian and the CIS
economies, underpin the growth of domestic and international
trade business conducted within these regions. International
and local businesses are increasingly looking to exhibit their
goods and services at the exhibitions which ITE owns. Growth
in the exhibition business has been constrained until recently ,
by the lack of suitable international quality exhibition space. In
2006 the completion of 75,000m
2
of new venue space across
Moscow , Kazakhstan and Ukraine will help support growth of
our exhibition portfolio into 2007 and beyond. We anticipate
further additional space will become available for use in 2007
in Moscow and Ukraine. ITE has, in its markets, a series of
recognised market leading brands across a number of
international exhibition sectors. The Group’ s well established
office and infrastructure network throughout the region means
that it is well placed to fully participate in the anticipated
growth of the exhibition business. 
The new financial year has started well with trading in line with
the Board’ s expectations. As of 1 December 2006 advance sales
for the 2007 financial year were £54 million (2005: £43 million)
an increase in excess of 10% on the comparable forward sales
position this time last year . The Board remains confident of the
prospect for the current financial year .

Strong brands in key sectors
Brand strength at group and event level is a growing 
asset for ITE. This strength is built on a sustained 
record of presenting high quality events which meet 
customer expectations.
Acknowledged and growing brand recognition combined
with positive brand values is helping ITE to realise the true
potential of its leading exhibitions and conferences and
leverage its leading brands to quickly develop new events
across the Group’ s sectors and territories.
ITE events serve many key industries such as oil & gas,
food & drink, construction & interiors, motor & transport,
travel & leisure, medical & healthcare and IT & telecoms.
Many of these sectors are critical to the continued
development of the domestic economies where 
ITE operates. 
Consequently , ITE occupies a favourable position
organising market leading events in key industry 
sectors with significant long term prospects.

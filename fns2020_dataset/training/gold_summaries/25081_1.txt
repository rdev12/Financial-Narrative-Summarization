Chief Executive’s Report
Chief Executive’s Report
For the Year Ended 30 September 2010 
Impax has continued to make significant 
progress in developing its status as a 
leading investment manager in the 
environmental sector
After a year of considerable uncertainty 
in the global economy and financial 
markets, it is encouraging to report that 
equity markets appear to have stabilised 
and are positioned for expansion. As 
described below, Impax has continued 
to make significant progress in 
developing its status as a leading 
investment manager in the environmental 
sector and has further demonstrated the 
attractions of its business model.
Sector developments
Just over a year ago, the international 
community was riveted by the prospects 
for an agreement in Copenhagen on 
limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Risk 
appetite was starting to return to equity 
markets, and many investors were 
betting on a strong year ahead for the 
environmental sector. However, the 
actual performance during 2010 of 
Impax’s chosen sector was largely driven 
by a number of unconnected factors. 
Between January and June, concerns 
about the health of European economies 
undermined valuations of all stocks with 
regional exposure, and environmental 
markets, with their relatively high 
dependence on public sector 
expenditure, were particularly badly 
affected. In addition, the rapid adoption 
by power generators in the United States 
of low cost shale gas reduced power 
prices significantly, undermining the 
prospects for companies in the domestic 
renewable power generation and energy 
efficiency sectors.
Over the same timescale, Asian 
environmental markets continued to 
develop rapidly, particularly on the back 
of positive policy statements from 
governments in the region. China 
reconfirmed its commitment to securing 
15 per cent of its electric power from 
renewable energy sources by 2020, a 
target that is expected to require at least 
US$180 billion of capital expenditure. 
Meanwhile, India announced a similar 
target of 10 per cent of power from 
renewables by 2015, and Japan 
introduced tariff support as part of its 
policy to source 10 per cent of primary 
energy from renewables by 2020.
Notwithstanding weakness earlier in the 
year, environmental sector stocks have 
again out-performed general equity 
markets: during calendar year 2010 the 
FTSE Environmental Opportunities All 
Share Index grew 22 per cent, while the 
MSCI World Index expanded by 15 per 
cent (both priced in Sterling). Stocks 
exposed to the Asia Pacific region, 
stocks of larger companies and stocks in 
the water sector were typically strong 
contributors, while small cap stocks and 
those in the renewable energy sector 
tended to under-perform.
Assets under management and 
fund flows
The Company’s principal divisions Listed 
Equity and Private Equity, have made 
substantial contributions to Impax’s 
increase in AUM since 1 October 2009.
During the Period, Listed Equity funds 
that we manage or advise secured 
net inflows of £401 million, comprising 
£151 million into “Impax-Label” funds, 
which we typically manage for UK 
investors, and £250 million into Third 
Party Funds/Accounts. 
In the former category, our second 
investment trust, Impax Asian 
Environmental Markets plc (“IAEM”), 
launched in October 2009 with £104.5 
million of assets. IAEM subsequently 
attracted £131 million additional capital 
in a C Share completed on 22 October 
2010, i.e. after the Period end. 
In the latter category, the development of 
our Institutional and Segregated 
Accounts business has been particularly 
encouraging. In October 2009 we 
commenced management of a second 
account for Russell Investments, a 
further endorsement of our reputation 
among international investors. In April 
2010 we received the final tranche of 
funding for a €150 million mandate from 
a European institutional investor, and in 
August 2010 we began to manage a 
A$50 million account for Local 
Government Super, our first major client 
in Australia. In November 2010 i.e., after 
the end of the Period, we announced 
that Lønmodtagernes Dyrtidsfond 
Pension Fund of Denmark had appointed 
us to manage €75 million in a segregated 
account following our Environmental 
Leaders strategy; we expect this 
mandate to commence later this month.  34%

Our Third Party Funds business has 
also made progress. In June, Skandia 
Investment Group appointed us as 
manager of the £74 million Skandia 
Ethical Fund, which was refocused on 
our Environmental Leaders strategy, 
albeit with an additional ethical screen. 
In view of Skandia’s powerful distribution 
capabilities in the UK retail market, we 
decided to wind up the IFSL Impax 
Environmental Leaders Fund, which 
had attracted ca. £7 million of capital. 
Our Private Equity division has also had 
a very successful year. In March we held 
a first closing of Impax New Energy 
Investors II LP (“Fund II”) with €141 million 
of capital from ten limited partners, the 
majority of whom had invested in Fund I. 
Fund II has a similar objective to Fund I, 
i.e., to provide strong capital growth by 
investing in renewable energy power 
generation and related assets in 
Europe. Subsequently, we have raised 
additional capital for Fund II, taking 
total commitments to €275 million and 
we expect to expand this fund further 
before its final closing, which is 
scheduled for March 2011. As described 
further below, we made the first 
investment for Fund II in December.
Cash flow
Operating cash flow before movements 
in working capital increased over the 
Investment performance
Listed equities
We continue to see strong investment 
performance as a top priority, and I 
am pleased to report that our track 
record of long-term out-performance 
has continued. During the Period, 
we completed our adoption of Global 
Investment Performance Standards 
(“GIPS”), which enhances considerably 
our ability to report investment 
performance with a methodology 
that is accepted worldwide by 
institutional investors.
Over the past few years we have 
widened our range of listed equity 
strategies to capitalise on new 
investment opportunities and respond 
to demand from clients. We now have 
four distinct long-only investment 
strategies: Environmental Specialists, 
which focuses on companies that have 
a majority of their business in the 
environmental sector; Environmental 
Leaders, which comprises specialists 
plus more diversified companies; 
Asia-Pacific, with stocks based in the 
region; and Water. 
As shown in Table 1, we remain 
very encouraged by the investment 
performance of the portfolios that 
we manage. Over five years, our 
Environmental Specialists strategy 
has delivered an annualised 
performance, measured in Sterling, 
of 10.6 per cent, significantly ahead 
of the MSCI World Index, which has 
returned 4.3 per cent (annualised). 
In order to prepare for future growth, we 
have also been working hard to generate 
out-performance in more recently 
established long-only strategies. As 
discussed in previous statements, our 
Environmental Leaders strategy is 
designed to capture the upside from our 
full investment universe of stocks; the 
resulting portfolio typically has a lower 
volatility and tracking error against global 
equity indices than the Environmental 
Specialists strategy, and is therefore 
suitable for an investor seeking broad 
exposure to environmental markets. The 
Environmental Leaders strategy has an 
annualised performance of 18.4 per cent 
over two years which is ahead of the 
MSCI World Index, up 15.5 per cent over

(as at 30 September 2010)
Range of investment strategies
“Impax-Label” funds AUM (£m) 
(as at 30 September 2010)
Period to £4.3 million (2009: £2.7 million), 
which was equivalent to £354,000 per 
month on average (2009: £225,000). 
Given the recent increase in AUM, 
monthly operating cash flow has 
improved further.
As reported in the Interim results for the 
six month period ended 31 March 2010, 
the Group disbursed additional funds to 
Impax New Energy Investors LP, and to 
date has paid in €2,750,000 out of its 
total commitment of €3,756,000. 
The closure of the IFSL Impax 
Environmental Leaders Fund released 
£1.4 million of seed capital to the Group.
Final redemption proceeds of 
$3,695,000 were received after the 
period end in respect of a secured loan 
note from All American Oil and Gas 
Incorporated (“AAOG”). The note, which 
was payable in full on or before 31 July 
2011, was issued to Impax by AAOG in 
July 2004 as part of AAOG’s purchase 
of Impax’s legacy oil operations. The 
proceeds represent £1,241,000 more 
than the previous book value of the note 
on Impax’s balance sheet; in accordance 
with IFRS, £1,002,000 has been included 
in profit before tax for the year ended  
30 September 2010.

Chief Executive’s Report
AUM by geographic region (source of funding) AUM growth across business channels
the same period, with a very similar 
measure of risk (as measured by 
volatility). The strategy will have a three 
year track record in March 2011, after 
which we expect it to be of interest to a 
wider group of investors.
Private equity
During the Period, we completed the 
investment programme for Impax New 
Energy Investors (“Fund I”), our first 
private equity fund, which has €125 
million of commitments, by allocating 
capital to a multi-project solar 
investment programme in Italy. During 
August, Fund I acquired an Italian project 
company with the right to build 9MW 
in the Lazio region, while in November, 
the Fund invested in a company 
developing 10.9MW in Puglia. These 
commitments have provided the 
portfolio with further diversification. 
In parallel, during calendar 2010 Fund I’s 
portfolio of Spanish solar projects 
again beat its budget and produced 
an attractive cash yield. At the time of 
writing, we are analysing the implications 
for Fund I of a new Royal Decree passed 
unexpectedly in Spain on 23 December 
2010, which, if formally ratified by the 
Spanish parliament later in January 2011, 
will cap the subsidies to solar power 
generators. Meanwhile, we expect to 
complete Final Acceptance Testing for 
these assets during the first half of 2011.
In December we completed the first 
investment for Fund II through the 
purchase from the German company 
Conergy AG, of 23MW of operating wind 
farms as well as a development pipeline 
of 93MW in Germany and 285MW in 
France, some of which we expect to be 
ready target for construction in 2011. 
We expect to use the business as a 
platform for growth in these markets.
Distribution
During the Period, our external 
distribution network has developed 
significantly in line with our policy of 
focusing internal resources on our 
core skill of investment management. 
The merger of BNP Paribas Investment 
Partners (“BNPP IP”) with Fortis 
Investment Management, which was 
completed in April 2010, has extended 
the sales team that is able to promote 
Impax’s products. For example, the 
expanded BNPP IP now has much 
stronger coverage in the Scandinavian 
and Benelux regions, both of which 
have historically shown a willingness 
to commit capital to environmental 
markets. BNPP IP is now able to 
represent Impax in most parts of 
continental Europe and the Asia-Pacific 
region. At the end of the Period, funds 
raised by or managed for BNPP IP 
represented 21 per cent of our 
total AUM.
In the United States, we have continued 
to support Titanium Asset Management, 
who have been acting as our non-
exclusive distributor since January 2010.

US investment management sector, 
we have been focusing on educating 
leading investment consultants in the 
characteristics of and potential for the 
environmental sector, logging our 
credentials and track record on key 
databases and engaging with receptive 
asset owners. We expect this systematic 
approach to produce results during 2011. 
Meanwhile, the fund that we sub-advise 
for Pax World, which currently has 
ca. US$31 million of assets, has 
sustained its strong investment 
performance. Once this fund reaches its 
third anniversary in March 2011, we 
expect it to pick up positive independent 
ratings and to attract additional capital.
In the United Kingdom we have 
continued our long and successful 
partnership with Collins Stewart’s closed 
ended companies team. Collins Stewart 
helped us to launch IAEM in October 
2009, and then, as described above, to 
expand the same trust in October 2010. 
Separately, since May 2010, we have 
been directly promoting an open ended 
version of IAEM to UK investors (through 
our funds platform in Ireland).
In parallel, we are continuing to engage 
with representatives of the major 
investment consultants around the 
world. After many years of dialogue, we 
believe we are well regarded by many of 
these “gatekeepers”, and several of them 
actively recommend one or more of our 
investment strategies to their clients. In 
particular, we have secured all of our 
Segregated Account clients after positive 
endorsement by consultants.
Infrastructure and support
Behind any successful investment 
management team is an experienced 
and well resourced support team. As 
our business has expanded, we have 
continued to invest in this key area. 
During the Period, we hired additional 
staff into our compliance, operations, 
marketing, and finance teams, taking the 
headcount in this area from 17 to 20.
In consultation with some of our larger 
clients, we decided during summer 2010 
to seek external validation of the internal 
controls for our listed equities investment 
activity using the widely recognised 
SAS 70 format. KPMG are currently 
finalising their reports, and we expect 
to be able to share the results with 
investors and prospective investors in 
the near future.
At the end of the Period, our total 
headcount was 40 permanent and four 
temporary staff, up from 34 permanent 
and four temporary staff at the start of 
the Period.
Hong Kong subsidiary
In recognition of the rapidly growing 
demand for our investment expertise in 
the Asia-Pacific region, during summer 
2010, we decided, in consultation with 
our local partner Ajia Partners Asset 
Management (“APAM”), to incorporate 
a subsidiary in Hong Kong. Impax 
Asset Management (Hong Kong) 
Limited (“Impax Hong Kong”), which 
was incorporated in October and is 
100 per cent owned by Impax Asset 
Management Group plc, is currently 
applying to the Hong Kong Securities 
and Futures Commission for a licence as 
an asset manager. Subject to regulatory 
approval, we expect that, for the 
foreseeable future, Impax Hong Kong 
will employ a small number of investment 
analysts and will share an office with 
APAM, who will continue to provide 
regional expertise and oversight. 
Outlook
After a volatile year for equity markets, 
expectations for 2011 are positive, 
although there is significant downside 
risk, particularly over financial stress in 
the Euro area, stagflation in developed 
countries and over-heating in China. 
Against this backdrop, although a 
handful of sub-sectors, particularly 
renewable energy, are struggling to 
recover, environmental markets, in 
general, are well positioned for 
sustained growth. 
I am delighted to be able to report on 
such a strong year for Impax. With over 
a decade of experience and a robust 
investment process, we are confident 
of being able to generate compelling 
returns for clients, and with our scalable 
structure and network of distribution 
partners we are in an excellent position 
to create significant further value for 
shareholders.

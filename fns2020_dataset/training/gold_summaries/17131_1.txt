Taking transformational steps
Offering a broad product range
In our shops, we offer an extensive 
range of betting opportunities, 
including UK horse racing, greyhound 
racing, football, overseas horse racing 
and numbers betting. Since 2001, 
when a change in the tax regime 
made lower-margin products more 
commercially attractive, we have 
been able to offer a greater range  
of products on gaming machines  
in our shops, which now generate 
around one third of the gross win  
from the high street retail channel.
Capitalising on opportunities created 
by fiscal and regulatory changes
We have successfully grown our retail 
channel by capitalising on fiscal  
and regulatory changes and we  
will continue to adapt to such 
opportunities as they arise. To date, 
these include responding to the 
change from a turnover-based tax 
system to a gross profit tax system by 
expanding the number of products 
offered by gaming machines  
and responding to the growth 
opportunities of the internet.
Managing our costs
Given the relatively high fixed costs 
necessary to operate this business 
effectively, changes in gross win  
can have a significant effect on  
operating profit. We, therefore, place 
considerable emphasis on cost 
control. For example, we have  
recently adopted a more efficient  
LBO staffing model and undertaken a 
detailed analysis of the effectiveness 
of extended winter evening opening. 
Our retail business
William Hill is one of the UK’s largest 
bookmakers and also operates in 
Ireland, with a total of approximately 
2,300 LBOs that provide betting 
opportunities on a wide range of 
sporting and non-sporting events  
and, in the UK only, offer gaming 
machines. In this consolidated market, 
we aim to maximise the significant 
cash generation from this business  
by growing gross win while carefully 
managing costs.
We believe we can continue to grow 
our retail business by: 
• developing our retail estate;
• offering a broad product range; and 
•  capitalising on any opportunities 
created by fiscal and regulatory 
changes. 
Developing our estate
Through an ongoing development 
and modernisation programme, we 
continue to expand our estate in  
the UK and to upgrade the location, 
facilities and size of our LBOs in  
order to deliver incremental growth. 
We operate a rigorous process for 
prioritising capital expenditure for 
both maintenance of the estate and 
value-creating investments in order to 
achieve our target returns on capital. 
Overview
Our strategy aims to deliver 
sustainable earnings growth and  
value for shareholders by:
•  Continuing to enhance the  
earnings of our core retail business 
by maximising organic growth 
opportunities and effectively 
managing costs;
•  Exploiting the growth opportunity  
in online betting and gaming; and
•  Selectively pursuing value-
enhancing acquisitions.
“ The core of our business is an 
extensive retail estate of around 
2,300 shops that generate around 
82% of our total net revenue.”

Our online business
Initially, we benefited from a first-mover 
advantage in this market and built  
a market-leading position in the UK. 
During the last two years, our lead was 
eroded and we lost market share as a 
result of aggressive competition. Since 
coming in as Chief Executive, one of 
my key changes has been to refocus 
the business on this opportunity and,  
in October 2008, we announced a 
significant step forward in the shape  
of an agreement with Playtech Ltd. 
Under this agreement, we acquired 
certain assets, contracts and 
businesses from Playtech, including 
around 30 gaming websites, a 
customer services operation and  
an online marketing organisation.  
The transaction combined two highly 
complementary businesses. We 
brought a strong brand, sports betting 
expertise and an established UK 
customer base and profit stream.  
The acquired assets brought online 
marketing and customer retention 
expertise, an extensive affiliate 
network to drive customers to our 
websites and an established European 
customer base and profit stream. 
We have an option to acquire 
Playtech’s interest in William Hill  
Online on an independent fair-value 
basis, exercisable at either four years 
or six years after completion of the 
original acquisition.
“ The internet-based gaming and 
betting market is expected to continue  
to grow at double-digit rates for at least 
the next three to five years.”
We believe that, following this 
transaction, William Hill Online has 
several strengths that can support 
significant growth, including: 
•  a large, geographically diverse 
customer base; 
•  improved marketing and  
customer management; and 
•  an extensive affiliate network.
In addition, we expect William Hill 
Online to benefit from Playtech’s 
improved poker and casino software, 
in relation to which we have entered 
into a software agreement for a 
minimum of five years. We expect this 
software to provide greater liquidity  
for poker and to support activities to 
increase customer retention, customer 
reactivation and player lifetime values. 
We launched a new casino website 
and a new poker website on the 
highly liquid Playtech poker network  
in January 2009.
Our strategy for William Hill Online is to:
•  integrate our existing business and 
the acquired assets within six to nine 
months of completion of the 
acquisition on 30 December 2008; 
•  seek to retain customers for a longer 
period by applying the specialised 
online marketing and customer 
management skills and by cross-
selling the full range of sports betting 
and gaming products;
•  exploit the improved Sportsbook, 
poker and casino offerings, which 
were launched in December 2008 
and January 2009; and
•  acquire new customers in the  
UK and Europe and, over time,  
expand our customer base in  
other key countries.
Acquisitions
We believe we can continue to  
deliver further shareholder value  
from selective acquisitions, although 
the scale of our existing UK retail 
channel is likely to preclude further 
substantial acquisitions in this area.  
We have a good track record, 
including the acquisition of Stanley 
Leisure’s UK retail betting operations  
in 2005, which established William Hill 
as the leading UK retail betting and 
gaming company by number of LBOs, 
and numerous, smaller bolt-on LBO 
acqusitions. The Playtech, transaction 
announced in October 2008, 
established William Hill Online as  
one of the leading European online 
betting and gaming businesses.

Q&A – The first year

Business Review
Ralph Topping was appointed  
Chief Executive of William Hill in 
February 2008. He reflects on his  
first year in charge.
Q  How would you describe the  
last year?
A  Our task is to give our customers 
what they want, when they want it, 
where they want it. For me, the last 
year has been about putting the 
company back on that track. I’ve 
taken big decisions. I scrapped  
our internal IT development project 
and moved our Sportsbook to  
Orbis’ platform. I pulled out of Italy 
because that wasn’t going to go 
anywhere quickly.
And I turned the focus on gaming  
as a driver of growth. Our future is  
in betting and gaming, which led  
us to do the deal with Playtech that 
established William Hill Online. We 
are no longer just a bookmaker. 
Between our internet sites and the 
machines in our betting offices, 
gaming accounted for 37% of  
our net revenue in 2008.
Q  What’s changing at William Hill 
with you in charge?
A  After 37 years in this company, I 
believe I know what can put us at 
the top of the league, and brains 
and talent are a big part of that.  
I’m a team builder so I’ve been 
changing structures, moving people 
around and recruiting new people. 
The biggest change came with the 
deal we did with Playtech, which 
brought us brands and brains. To 
give you some idea of what I mean, 
we had 10 marketing people in 
Leeds but the marketing team in 
Israel that we acquired has 160 
people. If you want internet brains 
these days in abundance, you  
go abroad.
Q  How resilient do you think  
your business will be during  
this recession?
A  We would never claim to be 
‘recession proof’ but there are 
reasons why we would expect 
trading to be resilient. In the last 
recession in 1991, our top line 
declined by 7% but we’re a very 
different business today – we have  
a wider geographical base, a  
more extensive product range, a 
broader customer base and we’re 
competing against fewer shops. 
We’re also online and have gaming 
machines in the shops. Plus, it should 
not be forgotten betting is a low-
ticket form of entertainment for a  
lot of people in the UK. In the shops, 
the average bet is around £8 but  
the most frequent bets are around 
£2 to £3. 
Q  What was the thinking behind  
the deal with Playtech?
A  Before the Playtech deal, we had 
the top flight brand, the betting 
expertise, established UK customers 
and good profits. But, on the 
downside, our e-gaming capacity 
was marginal and we were weak 
internationally. That’s why I was 
determined to change the business.
The assets we acquired from 
Playtech have given us websites, 
terrific online marketing and 
customer retention expertise, a  
vast affiliate network that will drive 
customers to our websites and an 
established European customer 
base and profit stream. On top  
of that, we get a continuing 
partnership and software deal  
with Playtech, the world’s largest 
gambling software provider, and  
the high-quality, deep-liquidity poker 
network we needed. We’ve put 
those assets together with the things 
we already do online to create a 
new entity – William Hill Online, one of 
the leading European online gaming 
and sports betting businesses. 
I was in at the start of the internet  
at William Hill. I’ve always said I 
wanted us to be a top three 
European player in online betting 
and gaming, and the clear leader 
among the traditional UK operators. 
Having been there at the beginning, 
I am passionate about turning 
around the fortunes of this part of  
our business. 
“ We are no longer just a bookmaker. Between 
our internet sites and the machines in our 
betting offices, gaming accounted for 37%  
of our net revenue in 2008.” The launch of William Hill Online
William Hill Online is now one of Europe’s leading 
betting and gaming businesses following the 
combination of our existing online sports betting and 
gaming products with assets acquired from Playtech 
in return for a 29% stake in the new online business. 
As a result of this transaction, which we successfully 
completed in December 2008, William Hill Online 
has a market-leading position in Europe, a larger, 
geographically diverse customer base, improved 
marketing and customer management, and an 
extensive affiliate marketing network.

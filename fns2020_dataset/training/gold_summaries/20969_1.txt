GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER REVIEW
I am delighted to have  
been appointed as Group 
chief executive officer. 
In every part of the  
Group, I have been 
impressed and inspired  
by my colleagues and  
the work that they  
do for our customers  
and clients. I would  
like to thank them for  
their contribution  
to the delivery of an  
outstanding year.
I am excited by the 
prospect of leading the 
next phase of Arrow’s 
growth, building on the 
Group’s momentum,  
high growth prospects,  
our operational and 
financial excellence and  
the strong financial  
returns we can deliver  
as we continue to expand  
in our chosen markets.
2016 review
We have expanded our European footprint 
and client offering across attractive markets 
where the Group is targeting leadership 
positions. This coupled with a high quality 
and diversified investment portfolio  
has enabled us to deliver another strong 
financial performance. 
A strong financial performance
Total revenue grew 42.6% to £235.9 million 
driven by core collections 30.9% higher  
at £286.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA was up 
36.7% to £209.2 million. We continue to  
see an increase in the income from asset 
management, with revenues now constituting 
20% of total revenues. The growth of these 
results was partially as a result of the Vesting 
acquisition in May 2016.
Our diversification across geographies 
and asset classes enabled us to deliver a 
strong increase in underlying profit after tax, 
up 28.7% to £45.6 million (2015: £35.4 million), 
and underlying return on equity (ROE)  
now stands at 29.1%. Due to post tax 
non-recurring items of £19.3 million, arising 
from restructuring the Group’s long-term 
financing and acquisition costs, profit after 
tax decreased to £26.3 million (2015:  
£31.7 million).
Our underlying basic EPS has increased 
28.5% to 26.1p (2015: 20.3p). The strong cash 
result for the year is pleasing and allows us  
to continue to deliver good returns to our 
shareholders while allowing for future 
investment and growth. As such, the full-year 
dividend for 2016, including the proposed 
final dividend of 6.4p, will increase to 9 .1p, up 
28.7% and represents a 35% payout ratio. 
A more detailed commentary can be 
found in the Group chief financial officer’s 
review on pages 34 to 39, including 
reconciliations between IFRS, cash metrics 
and underlying results. Definitions of 
frequently used terms can be found in  
the glossary.
A landmark year for the Group
2016 was a year of many important 
milestones for the Group. 
We made a number of acquisitions  
and continued to add to our loan portfolios 
through carefully considered purchases. 
Building from our strong UK base, we have 
made material progress in expanding  
our capabilities and the range of services we 
offer to financial institutions in all of our 
markets. In addition to the UK, we now have 
leading positions in the Netherlands and 
Portugal, with a presence in France, and 
from 2017 , on completion of the Zenith 
acquisition, we will enter the Italian market. Overview

Acquisitions in the Netherlands and Italy
During 2016, we acquired a market leading 
business in the Netherlands.
In May, we completed the acquisition  
of Vesting, which has operations in the 
Netherlands and Belgium. Our relationship 
with Vesting commenced in 2015, when 
they started servicing portfolios on our 
behalf. As we got to know the management 
team and came to respect their collections 
capabilities, including the benefits of 
access to the Focum credit bureau, it was  
a natural progression to purchase the 
business outright. 
In September, we strengthened our 
Dutch offering with a transformative deal. 
We acquired the servicing capabilities  
of RNHB Hypotheekbank and co-invested, 
alongside a credit fund, in loan portfolios 
with a face value of approximately €1.7 billion; 
resulting in an investment in loan notes of 
£21.3 million. The loan book comprises 9 ,300 
high quality real estate loans, with an 
average loan-to-value of 66%. It builds on 
the secured asset expertise and real estate 
capabilities of our Portuguese business, and 
offers an attractive model for future deals. 
For some time we have been evaluating 
the Italian market, which has the highest 
non-performing loan volumes in Europe 
along with a strong securitisation and 
structured finance market. We were 
delighted to mark our entry into Italy by 
agreeing terms to acquire Zenith, a leading 
master servicing business that has an 
excellent reputation for securitisation and 
structuring services. The transaction is 
subject to regulatory approval by the Bank 
of Italy, and we expect this to complete  
in the first half of 2017 . On completion, it will 
offer us a strong and established client  
base of leading Italian and international 
banks and funds, increase the weighting of 
asset management revenues across the 
Group, and provide a valuable insight into 
the Italian market and the performance  
and administration of credit portfolios. We 
consider Zenith to be a low-risk business, 
with stable revenues, and is a sensible entry 
into the Italian market.
Record year for investment and 
strengthened funding
2016 was a record year for investment.  
We acquired purchased loan portfolios and 
loan notes with a face value of £2.2 billion 
for a purchase price of £258.4 million. Of this, 
£223 million related to the purchase of 
organic portfolios and £35.4 million for the 
Vesting back book. Of the purchase price 
invested, 52% related to secured portfolios.
During the year, we also took the 
opportunity to strengthen and secure our 
long-term funding. In July, we refinanced 
our revolving credit facility reducing the cost 
by 100bp and extending its term to July 2021. 
In September, we successfully refinanced 
our £220 million bond, securing a coupon 
reduction of 275bp. Our average debt facility 
term is now just under six years and our 
average cost of debt is now less than 5%.
Reshaping our earnings
Our market entry strategy has been to target 
leading operating platforms in countries 
that meet our criteria. 
Our increased diversification, by both 
geography and asset class, provides a good 
platform to diversify our earnings as we 
balance our strength in debt purchase with 
that of asset management. 
Asset management is attractive as it is 
capital-light and helps us grow both earnings 
and return on equity (ROE) through 
long-term contracted revenues. Our ability 
to provide servicing on behalf of third parties 
has strengthened our partnership with 
credit funds, which has become a key part 
of our origination strategy.
Over time, we want to increase the 
percentage of our Group revenues derived 
from asset management. We made good 
progress in 2016, ending the year with asset 
management constituting 20% of total 
revenues, and we expect this to strengthen 
further in 2017 to approximately 25%.
Arrow now services 9.3 million customer 
accounts. The access we have to historic 
credit performance data in the markets in 
which we operate, provides us with 
significant insight into customer behaviours. 
This, in addition to a number of Group-
wide initiatives, such as a new servicing 
platform in the Netherlands and our  
UK digital portal, will enable us to improve 
customer engagement.

Our people
As Arrow has expanded, we have welcomed 
new colleagues. Our philosophy is to attract 
and retain the best talent. In 2016, we added 
considerably to our expertise across the 
Group. We now have over 1,500 colleagues, 
and it is their hard work, combined with a 
strong Group culture, that will continue to 
drive our success. 
As a result of our continued expansion we 
introduced a new management structure 
during the year. In addition to creating a small 
Group function that will have oversight for 
the whole Group, we appointed new country 
chief executive officers. Phil Marsland was 
appointed in the UK, Joost van Rens in the 
Netherlands and Belgium and John Calvão  
in Portugal. John will take responsibility for 
Italy on completion of the Zenith 
acquisition and will be replaced in Portugal 
by João Bugalho, who is currently the CEO 
of Whitestar in Portugal. 
From 2017 , responsibility for each country 
profit or loss will sit with each country  
chief executive officer and their senior 
management teams, which will ensure that 
we maintain strong local ownership and 
delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives. 
Outlook
Economic and market conditions
With stricter capital adequacy requirements 
and continued regulatory and government 
requirements, European banks have a 
continuing need to divest non-performing 
and non-core credit portfolios. In doing  
so, banks can lower their costs, release 
capital and focus on their core business. 
This generates opportunities for Arrow to 
purchase and manage portfolios and 
increase our asset management business. 
This will be a strong driver for growth 
across the markets in which we operate.
Looking ahead, consensus forecasts  
are for UK and European interest rates to 
remain low with a continuation of low,  
but steady economic growth in European 
economies. As such, whilst we are by no 
means complacent, it is reasonable to expect 
a small improvement in consumer and 
business confidence with a corresponding 
increase in lending. 
Regulation and compliance
We think the regulatory oversight in our 
European markets will continue to evolve. 
In the UK, FCA regulation has required 
investment across the industry in improved 
risk, governance and compliance 
frameworks. We believe that this will favour 
businesses such as Arrow that have scale, 
strong funding and a focus on the right 
customer outcomes. Arrow received its full 
FCA authorisation in August 2016. 
We are constantly evaluating and evolving 
risk and compliance activities across the 
entire Group, regardless of geography, and 
wherever possible, share best practice. 
Our clients are increasingly looking for 
respected partners, who meet all regulatory 
requirements and who have a strong track 
record of doing the right thing for customers. 
Our status as a regulated business in all  
of our markets and our strong purpose and 
social responsibility, means that we are well 
positioned to continue to take advantage of 
the opportunities that this presents.
Hilversum, Netherlands Overview

Pricing and competition
We maintain a positive outlook in each of 
our markets where supply has grown in 
recent years and all the indicators suggest 
that this trend will continue, especially in 
financial services. 
While competition is evident across  
all markets, our ability to secure off-market 
purchases coupled with a disciplined 
approach to investment, and in particular, 
to diversification, by both asset class and 
geography, means we are well placed to 
continue to grow our business profitably.
We have begun to see portfolios coming 
to market earlier in the cycle and we expect 
this trend to continue as financial institutions 
continue to adopt changes arising from 
new accountancy standards, such as IFRS 9.
UK economy and Brexit
In the UK, we have used our deep insight 
into customer payment behaviour under 
macro-economic stress to simulate  
the potential impacts of any downturn in 
macro-economic factors, due to Brexit  
or otherwise. 
During the year, we asked Jaywing 
Consulting to review and challenge our 
analysis. The analysis considered the impact 
on our forecast Estimated Remaining 
Collections (ERC) of the following drivers:
>  Breakage rates: the proportion of  
customers paying over time
>  Payment values: the proportional growth  
in arrangement value 
>  Cumulative settlement rate: the  
cumulative proportion of customers 
making a one-off settlement
>  Settlement liquidation rate: the  
proportion of current balances made as  
a settlement 
The analysis showed that, whilst increases  
in payment values observed in non-
recessionary times are suppressed, the other 
three metrics did not exhibit significant 
shocks within the last recession.
The UK’s EU referendum on 23 June 2016 
created additional concerns for part of  
the UK financial services industry. However, 
these are not expected to impact our  
ability to operate and purchase portfolios in 
Europe, since we are licensed in our own 
right in each of our chosen markets and, as 
such, are not reliant on the UK’s continuing 
membership of the EU.
Summary
We will continue to enhance our position as 
a leading partner to primary lenders and 
credit funds, where our relationships support 
both additional portfolio purchases and  
the growth in asset management revenues.
We start 2017 with a strong origination 
pipeline. We expect to complete the 
purchase of Zenith in the first half of the year, 
following which, we intend gradually to 
expand our Italian operations further. 
We are a well-funded business with a 
strong financial profile, which will support 
our growth opportunities.
We are confident in maintaining portfolio 
investments at approximately twice our 
average annual replacement rate. This, 
combined with the value we can add from 
our expanded Group, supports continued 
earnings growth in 2017 .
We are improving our Group capabilities 
to support the added complexity of a  
more diversified business and to continue 
to support its growth in a disciplined and 
safe way. This includes embedding our Group 
risk framework, investing in improving 
systems and processes across the Group and 
developing our capital allocation and 
portfolio management capabilities. In the 
short-term, this will lead to some additional 
cost, but will help drive sustainable earnings 
growth into the future.
We remain confident of our ability  
to deliver a medium-term underlying ROE 
percentage in the mid-twenties, high-teen 
EPS growth and a progressive dividend policy.

It has been another successful 
year for Pets at Home. I am 
pleased to report a year  
of excellent progress across  
the Group, delivering upon  
our goals in our first year  
as a public company. 
Market dynamics continue to be  
positive, supported by the themes of  
pet humanisation, the move towards 
premium Advanced Nutrition foods and the 
increasing use of pet services, such as 
veterinary treatment and pet grooming. 
Whilst the market offers supportive 
dynamics, our Executive Team has also 
executed successfully upon our strategy, 
enabling us to outperform the pet market. 
All three pillars of the strategy have shown 
positive progression; we have grown 
like-for-like sales through a number of 
commercial levers, we have achieved gross 
margin expansion, and we have increased 
our portfolio, opening 25 new stores,  
61 vet practices and 50 grooming salons.
During the year we have continued to  
take market share across the key growth 
segments; Advanced Nutrition, pet 
accessories, veterinary services and pet 
grooming. We also reached some important 
milestones; opening our 400th store,  
our 300th vet practice and our VIP loyalty 
scheme surpassed three million members. 
In the financial year 2015, revenues grew 
by 9.6% to £729.1m, supported by our 
store and services rollout and like-for-like 
growth of 4.2%. This growth was 
underpinned by strength in a number  
of areas; Advanced Nutrition, Health and 
Hygiene products, VIP club, pet services 
and omni-channel. Gross margin expanded 
by 40bps to 54.2% and underlying EPS  
was 13.5 pence. We have continued  
to deleverage the business as a result  
of strong cash flow and underlying free 
cashflow generation at the end of the  
year was £92.8m. 
Based on the successful financial 
performance of the business, the Board  
is recommending a total dividend for the 
year of 5.4 pence per share, at the top end 
of our commitment.
One of our most important values is to  
put pets before profit, which touches every 
area of our business, from strategy through 
to the daily activities of our colleagues  
in stores. Charitable initiatives therefore 
remain a key priority. Support Adoption  
For Pets, which we helped to establish and  
is widely supported across the business,  
is the largest animal rehoming charity in 
the UK and raised over £3m during the year. 
Our VIP loyalty club also generates charity 
lifelines every time a customer swipes their 
card, resulting in £1.4m raised for customer 
chosen animal charities in 2015.
 
Looking ahead, we believe growth in the  
UK pet market will be supportive to our 
business. We also have strong strategic 
levers that will enable us to deliver another 
year of expansion and profitable growth. We 
are confident in the outlook for the Group. 
 
Finally, I would like to express my thanks 
and admiration for all our colleagues.  
We are at heart a people business;  
reliant on the expertise and passion of our 
colleagues, and the bond they have with 
our highly engaged customers and their 
pets. Without them, we would be unable  
to deliver the exceptional customer service 
and advice that is essential to our success.

The leadership team
In our first year as a

we have dedicated considerable 
time to discussing the Group’s 
strategy, understanding  
progress against strategic 
priorities and confirmed those 
areas which require ongoing 
Board oversight.

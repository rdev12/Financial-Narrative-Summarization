OUR BUSINESS EXPLAINED
You may not always see our 
products, but they invariably add 
key performance characteristics 
to our customers’ products.
Raw Materials Yarn Production Fabric Production
Low and Bonar plays at several points 
along the industry value chain
PE/PP/PET Resin
Monofilament Yarns Needle-punched non-wovens
Tapes Spun-laid non-wovens
Fibrillated yarns Woven fabrics
Bi-component yarns Thermal bonded 3D 
profiles and Grids
Other materials: 
(PVC, PA6, PET, PP)
Additives for specific 
performance and colour 05 LOW & BONAR  ANNUAL REPORT 2008 www .lowandbonar.com
Our activities begin with the sourcing of widely 
available polymers including polypropylene, 
polyethylene, polyester, and nylon and combining 
these with specialty additives and colours which 
influence performance, aesthetics, and processing 
efficiencies. Using proprietary intellectual property 
these polymer mixes are extruded to form a variety 
of yarns which can be sold but more usually are 
transformed into fabrics using a broad range of 
technologies, which can then be coated or combined 
with other materials to form composite products. The 
products sold are typically components which are 
important determinants of the performance and/or 
efficiency of our customers’ final product or process.

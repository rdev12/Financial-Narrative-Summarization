1. Net revenue is revenue less the cost of mobile top-ups (where PayPoint is principal), SIM cards and other costs incurred by PayPoint, which are recharged to clients and 
merchants.  These costs include retail agent commission, card payment merchant service charges and costs for the provision of call centres for mobile parking clients.  
Net revenue is a measure which the directors believe assists with a better understanding of the underlying performance of the group.

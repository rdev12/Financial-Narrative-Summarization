Our performance
Our core market is the second 
largest video games market in 
the world, and we are the market 
leaders by some way.
In 2008 revenues increased by 26 
per cent to £1.4 billion, like-for-likes 
(lﬂ ’s) rose by 10.7 per cent, and 
we saw good margin increases.
Customer focus
Our dual brand strategy of GAME 
and Gamestation means we are 
able to appeal to all gaming 
consumers and compete more 
effectively. GAME has mass 
market appeal, and Gamestation 
appeals to the core gamer.
Evolving market
In the UK and Ireland we opened 
net 47 stores in 2008, taking the 
total to 696 stores. 52 GAME 
branded concession stores are in 
strong retail destinations such as 
Debenhams, Selfridges, Fenwick, 
Hamleys and Borders stores, and 
all make a positive contribution.
UK and Ireland
We are an international business 
of scale. International operations 
delivered a strong trading 
performance in 2008 with total 
sales growth of 51 per cent and 
operating proﬁ t increasing by 
54 per cent to £20 million. 
Our international sales represented 
nearly 30 per cent of the total 
Group sales.
Customer focus
We pride ourselves on having 
a leading and consistent offer 
in every market we trade. 
Each operating division has 
developed the GAME consumer 
offer with a particular focus on 
trade-in and preowned. Each 
territory has a dedicated buying 
team, Reward Card programme, 
and eCommerce operation.
Evolving market
We opened net 134 stores in our 
International business in 2008, 
and made a small acquisition 
in the Czech Republic. We are 
now trading from 646 stores. 
We plan to add 60 to 70 stores 
outside of the UK this year in the 
markets with opportunities for 
market share gains and good 
return on investment. We will also 
continue to invest in eCommerce 
in each territory.
International
Our multi channel strategy is 
a central focus for the Group. 
We trade from three brands – 
GAME, Gameplay and 
Gamestation. 
Our eCommerce operations 
showed excellent growth in 2008, 
with sales up 85 per cent to 
£106 million and operating proﬁ t 
up by 109 per cent to £6 million.

Customer focus
In 2008 we had around 49 million 
unique visitors to our websites, 
an increase of 39 per cent. 
We invested £8 million in our 
eCommerce operations in two 
core areas, our direct to home 
distribution infrastructure and our 
IT development to further improve 
our sites for our customers. 
Evolving market
The combination of our online 
and in-store offer is an important 
differentiator. We are investing 
in improved search capability 
to enhance the customer journey, 
and shopping experience. We also 
offer a pc digital distribution service 
on our game.co.uk website, and 
although it’s a very small part of 
our online operations, we continue 
to learn and monitor its progress.

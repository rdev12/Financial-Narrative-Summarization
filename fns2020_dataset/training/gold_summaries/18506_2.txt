…it means we’re becoming 
a diversiﬁed business in channels, 
product and customers.
It is satisfying to look back on a successful year.
Progress is born of an enormous amount of hard work,
a characteristic endemic throughout the business. 
I would like to take this opportunity to express my
thanks to my fellow Directors and to all our members
of staﬀ across the Group.

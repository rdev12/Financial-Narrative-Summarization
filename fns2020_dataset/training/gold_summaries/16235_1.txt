Business Review
Building Products
1
The Building Products division comprises the Group’s door 
and window hardware and seals operations. The division’s 
businesses are market leaders and operate across the 
Americas, the UK, Europe and Australasia. In 2011, trading 
in our Building Products businesses declined as markets 
continued to be difficult. 
While Building Products sales have decreased in 2011 
compared to the prior year, they have stayed relatively flat 
(+2%) compared to 2009. However operating profit in 2011  
is up 22% on the level achieved in 2009 as operating profit 
margins have been maintained closer to the level achieved  
in 2010, which is significantly above the margin achieved  
in 2009.
During the year, we completed an organisational 
restructuring of our Building Products division outside of 
North America with separate MD divisional roles created 
for the UK and Ireland business and the International 
business. External hires have been appointed to these 
key management roles and this reorganisation and 
strengthening of our divisional management team will 
enable us to provide increased focus to each region and 
facilitate expansion into new products and geographies. 
During 2011 we remained focused on maintaining tight 
controls over costs in all our businesses. Headcount at 31 
December 2011 in the Building Products division of 1,880 
was lower than the prior year (2010: 1,956) as we flexed 
labour where necessary and permitted limited selective 
hiring of permanent personnel only where merited by 
business activity levels. Raw material prices of steel and oil 
derivative products increased during the first half of the 
financial year but ameliorated during the second half. We 
continued to adopt a structured and disciplined approach 
to increases to our cost base, ensuring that we multisource 
product wherever possible and remain diligent in passing 
permanent cost increases on to customers.
US Building Products
1
Amesbury, our North American Building Products business, 
had an encouraging start to the financial year, however saw 
demand soften across the remainder of 2011 as US window 
shipments fell year on year. Quoting levels across Amesbury 
increased in the fourth quarter as customers continue to 
look at consolidating their supply base and consider new 
product development opportunities.

We remain positive about the long-term prospects for 
Amesbury and in 2011 continued to invest in the North 
American business. Towards the year end we started the 
fit out of our new extrusion plant in Atlanta which came 
on stream in February 2012 and, in December 2011, 
we announced the US$15 million acquisition of Overland 
which adds a number of complementary stamping 
products to the Amesbury offering.
We have started a significant programme of investment 
in IT systems in Amesbury that will move all our North 
American businesses onto a common platform, 
streamlining reporting and improving our customer and 
supplier interface. Over the next three years we expect 
to invest approximately US$5 million in this programme.
New products launched into the American market in 2011 
included our initial casement winder offering, microbial 
pile, intumescent seals, as well as numerous bespoke 
products developed for individual customers.
Novaseal 
The top two seals in the picture 
above are Novaseals, which are 
timber window weatherseals.  
These seals are designed to be  
cost effective, high performance 
weatherseals that are simple and  
fast to insert. Combining the 
benefits and performance of 
urethane foam with the design 
functionality of extrusions, along 
with a supple TPE lip for ease of 
insertion, the result is a seal with 
excellent memory and very low 
compression force. 
Moaf seal
The bottom seal in the picture above 
is a Moaf window seal. Moaf seals 
combine improved compression 
compared to EPDM, excellent 
durability, maximum flexibility and 
do not require a labour intensive 
fitting process. Combining a variety 
of QLON profiles with a number of 
extruded bases we have a wide 
range of options to suit all rebate 
sizes and seal gaps. These seals are 
now fitted in over 30 million 
windows worldwide.

Business Review
Chief Executive Officer’s review 
continued
In the UK and Ireland, grouphomesafe’s smaller portfolio 
businesses – Balance, Ventrolla and Linear – each exhibited 
very strong growth and continued to take market share, 
with our differentiated product offering partially offsetting 
weaker demand from larger customers such as window 
fabricators and social housing contractors. 
The distribution sector held up well during the year as 
consumers continued to undertake small scale repair 
projects, however, the OEM sector saw marked declines 
as homeowners appeared reluctant to commit to larger 
scale refurbishment projects. The social housing sector 
continued to contract as Housing Associations and Local 
Authorities reduced expenditure. 
There were significant movements in input costs during 
the year with increases coming through in the first half 
which eased in the second half. We successfully continued 
our policy of passing on cost increases as they occurred  
in order to defend margins. Despite input cost volatility  
and continued losses incurred within our composite  
doors business, the underlying operating margin  
for grouphomesafe improved slightly in the year  
as we successfully flexed our cost base.
Our composite door business had another difficult year 
with further declines in its key social housing markets, 
and remained loss making across the year as a whole. The 
business had some initial success in the year in selling direct 
to the trade and retail composite door markets and will look 
to develop this route to market further in 2012 following the 
introduction of our online door configurator. In 2011, 
further actions were taken to reduce the cost base, 
streamline manufacturing processes and review the 
operational footprint. 
During the period we continued the development 
of “grouphomesafe” as the umbrella brand for our UK 
Building Products business and maintained our focus 
on improving our customer service within the UK market, 
as we seek to differentiate ourselves from the competition 
by setting industry leading standards for delivery on time 
and in full.
New products launched into the UK and Ireland market in 
2011 included a door offering from Ventrolla, a range of 
suited hardware and a biometric lock offering from ERA 
and an intumescent seal from Schlegel.
International Building Products
1,2
Our International Building Products division, which goes to 
market under the Schlegel brand, has seen sales decrease 
in 2011 compared with the corresponding period last year.
Northern and Eastern European markets remained strong 
and demonstrated growth year on year, however Southern 
European markets remained subdued. Our Brazilian 
business continued to gain market share and position. 
In Australasia, the year started slowly following the various 
natural disasters in the region but showed some signs 
of improvement towards the year end. Profitability in the 
division was affected by a combination of operational 
gearing and product mix.
The new management structure we have put in place for 
the International division enables us to provide increased 
focus to the division and should facilitate expansion into 
new products, applications and geographies.
Discontinued operations – Oil and gas services
2
In 2011 our Oil and gas services division comprised  
the Gall Thomson and Klaw businesses. Gall Thomson 
Environmental is the world’s leading supplier of marine 
breakaway couplings (“MBCs”) and, through its KLAW 
subsidiary, is a supplier of industrial couplings including 
quick release and breakaway couplings.

Challenger Plus Hinge
The Challenger Plus hinge builds on 
the principles of the tried and tested 
Challenger, which has become the 
industry standard door hinge. 
Incorporating increased adjustability 
and a reduction of components, the 
Challenger Plus provides superior 
fitting tolerances and reduced 
fabrication time. Additionally, the 
unique lift off feature allows for 
simple one person installation of 
door sets. 
Suitable for PAS 24 specifications, 
the Challenger Plus is available in  
an extensive range of finishes. 
Outlook
2012 has started with sales and orders broadly in line  
with 2011, which is encouraging considering the relatively 
strong start we saw last year. However our view is that our 
end markets will remain relatively subdued across this year 
as a whole as market conditions remain challenging across 
all our geographies.
In 2012 the consensus view is for UK and Irish markets to 
show further decline compared with 2011, reflecting lower 
consumer spending on RMI and continued downward 
pressure on social housing budgets. In North America we 
expect markets to be broadly flat across the year and in 
Continental Europe we believe markets overall will be 
slightly down with Southern European markets remaining 
difficult. In Australasian markets we expect to see a return 
to growth this year and continued development in South 
American markets.
We continue to see opportunities for profitable investment 
that distinguish us from the competition across all of our 
businesses, as evidenced by the acquisition of Overland 
Products in December 2011, and will continue to deploy 
capital selectively where we believe it will enhance 
shareholder value.
